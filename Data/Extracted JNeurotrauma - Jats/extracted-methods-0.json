    "PMC10902499": "MethodsStudy design and settingThis retrospective multi-center observational cohort study included adults (\u226515 years) with moderate-to-severe TBI treated in an intensive care unit at two neurosurgical centers in Sweden between 2006 and 2021 (Center 1) or between 2008 and 2018 (Center 2). Moderate-to-severe TBI was defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale13 (GCS) score of 3\u201313 on hospital admission. The study hospitals are the only neurosurgical centers in their regions and serve a combined population of 4,500,000 (43% of the Swedish population). Patients were excluded if they did not show any contusions, follow-up data were missing, primary treatment was initiated at another hospital, injury was penetrating, the first computed tomography (CT) scan was conducted >12 h post-injury, there was absence of a second CT scan, or if they underwent contusion evacuation before a second CT scan was performed. Both centers generally adhere to the guidelines established by the Brain Trauma Foundation,14 where unconscious patients are mechanically ventilated and intracranial pressure is monitored.The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Center 1 Dnr: 2019-04476, Center 2 Dnr: 2022-06526-02). Informed consent was not required for Center 1. In Center 2, written informed consent was obtained from most patients or their relatives during treatment or follow-up, but the requirement was waived if the patient or relatives could no longer be contacted.Outcome and exposureThe primary outcome was the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS),15 assessed at a median of 8.0 months (interquartile range [IQR] 6.0\u201312) after injury, and subsequently dichotomized into unfavorable (GOS score \u22643, representing severe disability, vegetative state, or death) or favorable (GOS score \u22654, indicating moderate disability or good recovery). The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality, evaluated at the same time point as the primary outcome.The exposure of interest was CE, defined as the absolute or relative increase in contusion volume between the first and second CT scan. The second CT scan was normally conducted 6\u20138 h after the initial CT scan or earlier if clinically indicated. For patients who did not have a contusion on their initial CT scan (n = 77), only absolute CE could be calculated. If a patient was initially admitted to another hospital and then transferred to one of our centers, the CT scan performed at the first hospital was analyzed. If multiple contusions were present, their volumes were combined.Data collection and contusion volume calculationPatients were identified through local databases that included all those admitted to each department with a TBI. Clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records software, and imaging data were retrieved from the radiological management software Sectra Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) IDS7 (Sectra AB, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden). Dedicated research nurses prospectively collected GOS data via validated questionnaires through mail and telephone interviews. Contusion volumes were calculated using semi-automated threshold-guided planimetry, excluding the surrounding edema. In Center 1, this was performed using the IDS7 software, as previously described,1 while the BrainLab\u00ae elements software16 was used in Center 2 (BrainLab Germany Headquarters, Munich, Germany). Each center had one assessor who was blinded to patient outcomes, but was made aware of whether the CT scan they were analyzing was the initial or follow-up one. The latter was considered essential to ensure consistent definition of hematoma boundaries across scans.Statistical analysisAs all continuous data deviated from a normal distribution pattern (Shapiro\u2013Wilks test p value <0.05), we present them as median (IQR), and categorical data are presented as counts (percentages).To assess the agreement between the IDS7 and BrainLab\u00ae elements methods for measuring contusion volume, we calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for 30 randomly selected patients from Center 1, in whom volumes were determined by a single assessor using both methods. We employed a two-way mixed effects model based on single measurements and absolute agreement for the ICC calculation,17 using the R-package \u201cirr\u201d.18Multivariable logistical regression analyses were performed to determine the association between CE and outcome, adjusting for baseline contusion volume and variables from the core and CT International Mission for Prognosis and Clinical Trials in Traumatic Brain Injury (IMPACT) model (age, GCS, pupillary status, Marshall CT classification, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and epidural hemorrhage19). Listwise deletion was used to handle missing variables.To compare the predictive value of absolute and relative CE for unfavorable GOS and all-cause mortality, we generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and compared their discriminatory performance using the DeLong method.20 Sensitivity, specificity, and Youden's index for several commonly used cutoff definitions of CE were also calculated. In a sensitivity analysis we then conducted subgroup evaluations in patients with baseline contusion volumes \u22651 mL, severe TBI (GCS \u22648), and for each center separately. A univariable logistical regression model with interaction-term analyses was also used to investigate potential effect modifiers. Isolated TBI was defined as a moderate-to-severe TBI with an extracranial Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)21 \u2264 2.All statistical analyses were conducted using R software version 4.1.2, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
    "PMC11071087": "MethodsPatient selectionmTBI patients were enrolled from a tertiary care center and level I trauma center, Memorial Hermann Hospital at the Texas Medical Center, Houston, TX, between December 2017 and August 2019. The study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at the University of Texas McGovern School of Medicine (HSC-MS-12-0637). All patients were evaluated by an attending neurointensivist and diagnosed with mTBI, defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of \u226513 and LOC <30 minutes. Each patient received a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head as part of routine clinical evaluation. Of the 84 TBI patients, 6 had no acute CT findings (7.14%), while the rest had intracranial findings including traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 50, 59.5%), subdural hemorrhage (n = 47, 56.0%), epidural hemorrhage (n = 3, 3.57%), or contusions (n = 20, 23.8%). Multi-compartment hemorrhage was common (n = 31, 36.9%). No patients had significant mass effect or midline shift, and none required surgical intervention. A description of the types of hemorrhages found in each patient is provided in Table S1. Healthy volunteers were enrolled from outpatient clinics at the University of Texas Health Science Center and the University of Maryland Medical Center, and had no neurological diagnoses.Demographic, clinical, and outcome dataDemographic data were collected for each subject including age, sex, and medical comorbidities. The modified Rankin Score (mRS) at discharge was assessed by the attending physician taking care of the patient.26 The GOSE is one of the most widely used metrics of disability and recovery after TBI.27 GOSE outcomes range from 1 to 8 (1 = dead, and 8 = upper good recovery); the full scale is shown in Table S2. GOSE was assessed at discharge by the attending physician caring for the patient. GOSE and mRS at 6 months post-injury were assessed via follow-up phone call by trained research personnel using standardized questionnaires.Sample collection and processingBlood samples were collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing tubes and centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove circulating cells and isolate the plasma fraction. All mTBI subjects had a plasma sample collected within 24 h after injury. Thirty-two of these mTBI subjects returned 3 months after injury (3.16 \u00b1 1.05 months) to provide a second sample. For the healthy volunteer subjects (n = 35), a single blood draw was obtained and processed at enrollment. Plasma samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until used.MetabolomicsMetabolomics was performed by Metabolon, Inc (Morrisville, NC) using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) as previously described.28 Metabolites were identified based on comparisons of each ion with a reference library.29 The AUC for each metabolite peak was quantified and used in the fold-change calculations. A total of 318 lipid metabolites were identified and analyzed (Table S3). Lipid metabolites included sphingolipids and ceramides; acyl-carnitines; intermediates of fatty acid metabolism (acyl-choline, acyl-glutamine, acyl-glycine); fatty acids (short, intermediate, and long chain fatty acids; dicarboxylate, dihydroxyl, and monohydroxyl fatty acids; long-chain polyunsaturated (n3 and n6) fatty acids; PC, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine; and lysoplasmalogen and plasmalogen. Nomenclature for lipids includes the backbone and acyl chains in parentheses. Chemical structures were drawn with PubChem Sketcher V2.4 (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//edit3/index.html).Bioinformatics analysesFor each metabolite, fold change between comparison groups (e.g., \u201cgood\u201d vs. \u201cbad\u201d dichotomized GOSE; mTBI vs. control) and corresponding raw and false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p values were calculated in R using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca).30 FDR corrected p values were considered to be significant at p < 0.05. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for metabolites of interest.Statistical analysisDescriptive statistics (medians and interquartile ranges [IQR] or percentages) were calculated for each subject. Categorical variables were compared using Pearson \u03c72 test, while continuous variables were compared using a Mann\u2013Whitney test. For descriptive statistics, p values were two-sided and considered statistically significant if p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, version 4.1.2).Predictive modelsFunctional outcomes at discharge and 6 months after discharge were quantified using GOSE scores dichotomized as a binary response: \u201cgood\u201d (GOSE \u22657) and \u201cbad\u201d (GOSE \u22646). Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on metabolites comprising a particular pathway producing a new set of variables named \u201cprincipal components,\u201d and eliminating redundant dimensions, with original variables combined in each principal component.31,32 PCA prevents overfitting by reducing the number of dimensions within the predictors. The \u201cPCAtools\u201d package in R was used to generate scree plots with the \u201celbow\u201d method used to select the number of PCs needed to account for at least 80% of the variation in the data set.33,34 We developed a baseline logistic regression model for mTBI patients (including age and sex) and predictive models (logistic regression models that included individual lipid metabolites or principal components in addition to baseline parameters). Models were developed to predict functional outcomes at discharge and 6 months after discharge. The area under the receiver operating curves (ROC) of the predictions was calculated, and the ROC curves were statistically compared using the DeLong test.35 Models were developed using the \u201cscikitlearn\u201d toolbox available in Python (v3.6). Statistical analyses comparing ROC curves was performed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, version 4.1.2).",
    "PMC11005384": "MethodsParticipantsParticipants included U.S. Active Duty military volunteers recruited from military treatment facilities in the San Diego area. The TBI groups consisted of adults (>18 years old) with persistent self-reported symptoms related to TBI sustained more than 3 months before study participation; the control group consistent of adults with no history of TBI or other neurological conditions (noTBI). Participants were divided into groups based on VA/DOD guidelines, defining mild TBI as <30 min loss of consciousness, <24 h confusion/disorientation, and/or <24 h post-traumatic amnesia; moderate TBI as 30 min-24 h loss of consciousness, >24 h confusion/disorientation, and/or >24 h post-traumatic amnesia; and severe TBI as >24 h loss of consciousness, GCS 3-8, and/or >7 days post-traumatic amnesia. Ninety participants (n = 21 noTBI, n = 52 mTBI, n = 17 msTBI) met full eligibility requirements and were included in analysis. After determining that there were no significant differences in brain metrics between the two groups, the moderate (n = 12) and severe (n = 5) TBI groups were combined for the purposes of this study. Participants were excluded from this study if they had a neurological condition, psychiatric disorders, contraindications for MRI, or a history of a medical condition that would be expected to affect cognitive or motor abilities.Experimental procedureAfter providing written informed consent, participants provided demographic information and medical history (Table 1). History of TBI was obtained using the Ohio State University TBI Identification Method (OSU TBI-ID)55,56 and verified using available medical records. Participants completed a brief screening battery of standardized self-reported symptom surveys, including Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI),57 PCL-5 (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition),58 and Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT6).59-61 Participants then completed structural and functional MRI.

A T1-weighted high-resolution image was acquired using a 3D T1w Turbo Field Echo (TFE) pulse sequence (TFE factor = 256, repetition time (TR) = 6.7 msec, inversion time (TI) = 890 msec, TE = 3.0 msec, shot interval time = 3000 msec, 218 shots, flip angle = 8\u00b0, 256 \u00d7 256 matrix, phase encoding direction = y). One hundred and seventy slices covering the entire brain were acquired with a voxel resolution of 0.94 \u00d7 0.89 \u00d7 1 mm. Total scan time was 10:57. Diffusion tensor images were acquired with a pulsed gradient-spin echo sequence with an echo-planar imaging readout in 32 directions (TR = 6853 msec, TE = 103 msec, acquisition matrix = 112 \u00d7 110, slice thickness = 3.00 mm, flip angle = 90\u00b0, EPI factor = 55). Forty-eight slices covering the entire brain were acquired with an inplane resolution of 2 \u00d7 2.04 \u00d7 3 mm. Total scan time was 8:46.MRI data analysisStructural MRI analysisMRI structural images were first analyzed using FSL's fMRI analysis tool, FEAT version 6.0.1 (FMRIB's Software Library http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/).62-64 The skull was removed from the T1 images using the BET brain extraction tool65 with a fractional intensity thresholding of 0.4, specifying the voxel that represented the approximate center of the brain. Next, the T1 was registered to the standard MNI atlas with a 12 degrees of freedom affine transformation. This transformation was refined using FNIRT nonlinear registration with a warp resolution of 10 mm.66Cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation were performed with the FreeSurfer image analysis suite (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu), using the built-in command recon-all with default settings. The technical details of these procedures are described in prior publications.45,67\u201379 Processing included motion correction, removal of non-brain tissue using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure,69 automated Talairach transformation, segmentation of the subcortical white matter and deep gray matter volumetric structures,45,75 intensity normalization,80 tessellation of the gray matter white matter boundary, automated topology correction,74,81 and surface deformation following intensity gradients to optimally place the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders at the location where the greatest shift in intensity defines the transition to the other tissue class.67,72,73 Once the cortical models were complete, surface inflation77 was performed to match cortical geometry across subjects.78 A variety of surface-based data including maps of curvature and sulcal depth were created using both intensity and continuity information from the entire three-dimensional magnetic resonance volume. Cortical thickness was calculated as the closest distance from the gray/white boundary to the gray/CSF boundary at each vertex on the tessellated surface.73 The maps were created using spatial intensity gradients across tissue classes and were therefore not simply reliant on absolute signal intensity. Volume, surface area, and thickness for the Desikan-Killiany atlas cortical structures, as well as volume for subcortical structures and white matter segmentations, were extracted for each subject and scaled by total intercranial volume, where appropriate.Voxel-wise DTI analysis of fractional anisotropyDTI data were analyzed using FSL's FDT toolbox. Voxel-wise statistical analysis of FA was carried out using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS),82 within FSL.63 First, FA images were created by fitting a tensor model to the raw diffusion data using FDT, and then brain-extracted using BET.65 All subjects' FA data were then aligned into a common space using the nonlinear registration tool FNIRT,66,83 which uses a b-spline representation of the registration warp field.84 Next, the mean FA image was created and thinned to create a mean FA skeleton with a threshold FA value of 0.2, representing the centers of all tracts common to the group. Each subject's aligned FA data was then projected onto this skeleton and the resulting data were fed into voxel-wise cross-subject statistics. Statistical analysis was performed using the \u201crandomize\u201d command in FSL. The number of permutations was set to 10,000, and correction for multiple comparisons was achieved using threshold-free cluster enhancement with a family-wise error rate of p < 0.05.Region of interest DTI analysis of fractional anisotropyTo evaluate average FA in pre-defined white matter regions of interest, the brain was separated into 48 white matter regions based on the ICBM-label atlas.85-87 Average FA was extracted for each region for each participant using the mean FA image created in the FDT process described above. Following FA value extraction, the three participant groups were compared using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine regions of significant difference.Pothole DTI analysisBecause of the heterogeneous nature of white matter damage in TBI, additional analyses were implemented examining DTI \u201cpotholes.\u201d Potholes represent white matter with FA values that are abnormally low compared with a healthy control group. Pothole analysis has been shown to be sensitive to white matter changes,88 specifically in mTBI, in previous studies.31,89,90 To begin, a normative template based on the MNI-registered DTI volumes of the noTBI participants was generated using tools available within FSL. FSL FAST91 results were used to restrict the calculations to white matter voxels common among noTBI participants. Volumes representing the mean and standard deviation (SD) of each white matter voxel were then calculated via fslmaths. For each TBI participant, their own FAST white matter map was used to restrict their DTI volume to white matter, and a z-score map was generated by subtracting the control group mean volume and dividing by the control group SD volume. The resulting z-maps were thresholded at z = -3, and FSL cluster was used to label contiguous voxels below this threshold. These resulting clusters are considered potholes. These potholes were then thresholded at \u226510 mm3.90 The sum of pothole clusters for each participant was then used as the measure of reduced white matter organization in further analyses.Statistical analysisSPSS 28.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analysis. An independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney test was used to compare group differences depending on data normality. A one-way ANOVA was used when comparing differences among all 3 groups, with post hoc Bonferroni analysis for significant difference between two-group pairs. Chi-square analyses were used to compare groups on categorical variables. Effect sizes (d) were computed to demonstrate the magnitude of observed differences. Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to examine associations between white matter and gray matter metrics. The significance level was adjusted by using the Bonferroni correction with p < 0.05.",
    "PMC11005383": "MethodsTherapy Intensity Level (TIL) and alternative scalesTIL refers to the 38-point scale developed by the CDE scheme for TBI.8 The domain or construct (i.e., targeted concept of a scale) of TIL is the therapeutic intensity of ICP management. The TIL scale has 12 items, each representing a distinct ICP-targeting treatment from one of eight modalities, as defined in Table 1. TIL was developed by an international expert panel, which discussed: 1) the relevant ICP-treatment modalities of modern intensive care; 2) the relative risk and efficacy of individual therapies to derive scores; and 3) practical and statistical limitations of previous TIL scores.8 In this way, TIL is a formative measurement model in which the construct (i.e., ICP treatment intensity) is not unidimensional but rather defined by the combination of items (i.e., ICP-targeting treatments).17 TIL was shown to have high inter-rater and intra-rater reliability by Zuercher and colleagues.9 If a decompressive craniectomy was performed as a last resort for refractory intracranial hypertension, its score was included in the day of the operation and in every subsequent day of ICU stay. TIL scores can be calculated as frequently as clinically desired. For our analysis, we calculated the following TIL scores from the first 7 days of ICU stay:Table 1.Scoring Configurations for TIL and Alternative ScalesICP-treatment modalityItemTILuwTILTIL(Basic)aPILOTbTIL(1987)bSub-itemScoreMaxScoreMaxScoreaScoreMaxScoreMaxPositioningHead elevation for ICP control or nursed flat (180\u00b0) for CPP management11111\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013Sedation and neuromuscular blockadeSedation 5 3 5 4 Low dose sedation (as required for mechanical ventilation).1 1 11 1 Higher dose sedation for ICP control (but not aiming for burst suppression).2 2 21 1 High dose propofol or barbiturates for ICP control (metabolic suppression).5 3 45 4 Neuromuscular blockade (paralysis).3311\u20132211CSF drainageCSF drainage volume 3 2 5 2 Low (<120 mL/24h)2 1 24 1 High (\u2265120 mL/24h)3 2 35 2 CPP managementFluid loading for maintenance of cerebral perfusion.11112\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013Vasopressor therapy required for management of cerebral perfusion.1111222\u2013\u2013Ventilatory managementHypocapnia for ICP control (PaCO2 [mm Hg]) 4 3 4 2 Mild (35 \u2264 PaCO2<40)1 1 21 1 Moderate (30 \u2264 PaCO2<35)2 2 32 1 Intensive (PaCO2<30)4 3 44 2 Hyperosmolar therapyMannitol administration 3 2 3 6 \u22642g/kg/24h2 1 22 3 >2g/kg/24h3 2 33 6 Hypertonic saline administration 3 2 3\u2013\u2013 \u22640.3g/kg/24h2 1 23 >0.3g/kg/24h3 2 33 Temperature controlTemperature control (T [\u00b0C]) 5 3 5\u2013\u2013 Fever control (>38 or spontaneous <34.5).1 1 1 Cooling for ICP control (\u226535)2 2 33 Hypothermia (<35).5 3 45 Surgery for intracranial hypertensionIntracranial operation for progressive mass lesion, NOT scheduled on admission.4411444\u2013\u2013Decompressive craniectomy.5511455\u2013\u2013Maximum total possible score 38 214 38 15The TIL scale was developed by Maas and colleagues.8 For each calendar day, the highest score for each item was summed to derive the TIL score. a TIL(Basic) is the maximum score (up to 4) among all administered sub-items over the calendar day.

The 21-point, unweighted TIL (uwTIL) scale replaces each sub-item score in TIL with its ascending rank index (i.e., 1, 2, 3, \u2026) within each item (Table 1). The five-category TIL(Basic) was also developed by the CDE scheme for TBI and takes the maximum score, from zero (i.e., no ICP-related intervention) to four, amongst all included sub-items over the calendar day.8 We adapted the 38-point PILOT7 and 15-point TIL(1987) scales6 with minor adjustments to fit the items of TIL with a daily assessment frequency. PILOT also was shown to have high inter-rater and intra-rater reliability by Shore and colleagues.7 For the four alternative scales, daily (i.e., uwTIL24, TIL(Basic)24, PILOT24, and TIL(1987)24), maximum (i.e., uwTILmax, TIL(Basic)max, PILOTmax, and TIL(1987)max), and median (i.e., uwTILmedian, TIL(Basic)median, PILOTmedian, and TIL(1987)median) scores were calculated in the same way as TIL24, TILmax, and TILmedian, respectively.Study design and populationsOur study population was prospectively recruited for the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) core and high-resolution studies. CENTER-TBI is a longitudinal, observational cohort study (NCT02210221) involving 65 medical centers across 18 European countries and Israel. Patients were recruited between December 19, 2014, and December 17, 2017, if they met the following criteria: 1) presentation within 24 h of a TBI; 2) clinical indication for a CT scan; and 3) no severe pre-existing neurological disorder. In accordance with relevant laws of the European Union and the local country, ethical approval was obtained for each site, and written informed consent by the patient or legal representative was documented electronically. The list of sites, ethical committees, approval numbers, and approval dates can be found online at https://www.center-tbi.eu/project/ethical-approval. The project objectives and design of CENTER-TBI have been described in detail previously.18,19In this work, we applied the following inclusion criteria in addition to those of CENTER-TBI (Fig. 1): 1) primary admission to the ICU; 2) at least 16 years old at ICU admission; 3) invasive ICP monitoring; 4) no decision to withdraw life-sustaining therapies (WLST) on the first day of ICU stay; and 5) daily assessment of TIL.FIG. 1.Flow diagram for patient enrollment and validation population assignment.

Patients with end-hour ICP (ICPEH) values, which were recorded by clinicians at the end of every other hour, constituted the TIL-ICPEH sub-population. Patients with high-resolution ICP values (ICPHR), which were automatically stored with monitoring software, constituted the TIL-ICPHR sub-population. All patients in the TIL-ICPHR sub-population were also members of the TIL-ICPEH sub-population (Fig. 1).Data collectionData for the CENTER-TBI study was collected through the QuesGen electronic case report form system (QuesGen Systems Inc, Burlingame, CA, USA) hosted on the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) platform (INCF, Stockholm, Sweden). All data for the validation populations, except high-resolution signals, were extracted from the CENTER-TBI core study19 (v3.0, ICU stratum) using Opal database software.20ICP management data for TIL calculationSince TIL24 was found to be a reliable summary of hourly TIL,9 clinical data pertinent to the component items of TIL (i.e., ICP-guided treatments, Table 1) were recorded daily through the first week of ICU stay. We extracted all daily TIL item values for our population, and calculated TIL24, uwTIL24, TIL(Basic)24, PILOT24, and TIL(1987)24 as defined in Table 1. For patients who underwent WLST after the first day of ICU stay, we only extracted TIL item information from before the documented date of WLST decision.ICPEH and related valuesEnd-hour ICP (ICPEH), systolic blood pressure (SBPEH), and diastolic blood pressure (DBPEH) were recorded by clinicians every 2 h for the TIL-ICPEH sub-population. Mean arterial pressure (MAPEH) was calculated as MAPEH = (SBPEH + 2DBPEH)/3, and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPEH) was calculated as CPPEH = MAPEH \u2013 ICPEH. From ICPEH and CPPEH, we calculated the following values: ICP24 or CPP24, the mean ICP or CPP value over a calendar day of ICU stay,ICPmax or CPPmin, the maximum ICP24 or minimum CPP24 value over the first week of a patient's ICU stay,ICPmedian or CPPmedian, the median ICP24 or CPP24 value over the first week of a patient's ICU stay.ICPHR and related valuesHigh-resolution signals were collected using either ICM+ software (Cambridge Enterprise Ltd, Cambridge, U.K.; http://icmplus.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk), Moberg CNS monitor (Moberg Research Inc, Ambler, PA, USA; https://www.moberg.com), or both. Blood pressure was obtained through arterial lines connected to pressure transducers. High-resolution ICP (ICPHR) was acquired from either an intraparenchymal strain gauge probe (Codman ICP MicroSensor, Codman and Shurtleff Inc., Raynham, MA, USA), a parenchymal fiber optic pressure sensor (Camino ICP Monitor, Integra Life Sciences, Plainsboro, NJ, USA; https://www.integralife.com/), or an external ventricular drain. Detailed data collection and pre-processing methods (i.e., artefact cleaning and down-sampling to ten-second averaged time series) applied to high resolution signals in our study have been described previously.21 Ten-second averaged ICP (ICPHR_10sec) and CPP (CPPHR_10sec) time-series were retrieved for this analysis, and, from ICPHR_10sec and CPPHR_10s, we calculated ICP24/CPP24, ICPmax/CPPmin, and ICPmedian/CPPmedian as described above.Physician impressionsAttending ICU physicians were asked to record their daily concerns with the patient's ICP and CPP, separately, on a scale from 1 (not concerned) to 10 (most concerned). Moreover, on each patient's ICU discharge summary, physicians were asked to record whether the patient experienced refractory intracranial hypertension during his or her ICU stay. Refractory intracranial hypertension was defined as recurrent, sustained (i.e., of at least 10 min) increases of ICP above 20 mm Hg despite medical ICP management. We extracted the daily ICP/CPP concern ratings and refractory intracranial hypertension impressions which coincided with the ICU stays of our population.Baseline characteristics, prognosis, and outcomeWe extracted baseline demographic characteristics, Marshall CT classifications,22 and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)23 scores from ICU admission.24 We also extracted Glasgow Outcome Scale\u2014Extended (GOSE) functional outcome scores at 6 months post-injury,25 with imputation of missing values as previously described.26 Finally, we extracted ordinal functional outcome prognosis scores, calculated from a tokenized embedding of all available clinical information in the first 24 h of ICU stay, as described previously.27ValidationWe appraised the validity of TIL according to recommendations of best practice from clinimetric literature.28 Based on the identified domain of TIL, we evaluated the construct and criterion validities of TIL. Our qualitative and quantitative assessments of TIL were performed against those of alternative scoring configurations (Table 1) for comparison.Construct validityConstruct validity is the extent to which a clinical scale matches expectations of associations with parameters within or outside the identified domain. Construct validity is further broken down into convergent validity (i.e., associations with similar constructs), discriminant validity (i.e., associations with divergent constructs), and differentiation by known groups. In this work, statistical associations between study variables were measured with:Spearman's correlation coefficients (\u03c1) for static (i.e., measured once) variables,repeated measures correlation coefficients (rrm)29\u2014interpreted as within-individual strength of association\u2014for longitudinal (i.e., measured over time) variables,linear mixed effects regression (LMER) coefficients (\u03b2LMER) of daily scale scores (e.g., TIL24) when regressing ICP24 or CPP24 on daily scale scores and the day of ICU stay (DayICU), accounting for inter-patient variability with random intercepts. Therefore, \u03b2LMER were interpreted as the expected difference in ICP24 or CPP24 per unit increase of daily scale score, independent of time since ICU admission or inter-patient variation.For convergent validity, we expected therapeutic intensity to correlate at least mildly (i.e., |\u03c1|\u22650.2, |rrm|\u22650.2, |\u03b2LMER|>0) with markers of injury severity (i.e., baseline GCS and baseline outcome prognoses), functional outcome (i.e., six-month GOSE), clinical concerns of ICP status, and ICP itself. Accordingly, we calculated: 1) \u03c1 values between TILmax and GCS, ordinal prognosis scores, GOSE, and ICPmax; 2) \u03c1 values between TILmedian and GCS, ordinal prognosis scores, GOSE, and ICPmedian; 3) rrm values between TIL24 and physician concern of ICP and ICP24; and 4) \u03b2LMER of TIL24 when regressing ICP24 on DayICU and TIL24 (i.e., ICP24\u223cDayICU+TIL24), accounting for inter-patient variability with random intercepts.For discriminant validity, we expected therapeutic intensity to be more strongly correlated with ICP and physician concerns of ICP than with CPP and physician concerns of CPP, respectively. Even though CPP control through fluid loading or vasopressor therapy is a component modality of TIL (Table 1), we expected TIL to capture ICP management (i.e., the construct) more accurately than CPP management. We compared: 1) \u03c1 values of TILmax versus CPPmin to those of TILmax vs. ICPmax; 2) \u03c1 values of TILmedian versus CPPmedian to those of TILmedian vs. ICPmedian; 3) rrm values of TIL24 versus CPP24 to those of TIL24 vs. ICP24; and 4) the \u03b2LMER of TIL24 when regressing CPP24\u223cDayICU+TIL24 to the \u03b2LMER of TIL24 when regressing ICP24\u223cDayICU+TIL24.For differentiation by known groups, we expected TILmax and TILmedian to effectively discriminate patients who experienced refractory intracranial hypertension during ICU stay from those who did not. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which, in our case, was interpreted as the probability of a randomly selected patient with refractory intracranial hypertension having a higher TILmax or TILmedian score than one without it. We also compared the AUCs of TILmax and TILmedian to ICPmax and ICPmedian and determined the sensitivity and specificity of refractory intracranial hypertension detection at each threshold of TILmax and TILmedian.Criterion validityCriterion (or concurrent) validity is the degree to which there is an association between a clinical scale and other scales measuring the same construct, particularly a gold standard assessment. Since there is no extant \u201cgold standard\u201d for assessing ICP management intensity, we tested the concurrent criterion validity of TIL by calculating its associations with its predecessors (i.e., PILOT and TIL(1987)), mindful of their limitations as described above. More specifically, we calculated: 1) \u03c1 values between TILmax and prior scale maximum scores (i.e., PILOTmax and TIL(1987)max); 2) \u03c1 values between TILmedian and prior scale median scores (i.e., PILOTmedian and TIL(1987)median); and 3) rrm between TIL24 and prior scale daily scores (i.e., PILOT24 and TIL(1987)24).Component item analysisWe evaluated inter-item (i.e., inter-treatment) and adjusted item-total associations of TIL24, uwTIL24, PILOT24, and TIL(1987)24 by calculating rrm values. Item-total correlations were adjusted by subtracting the tested item score from the total score prior to calculating the correlation. We measured Cronbach's alpha (\u03b1) to assess internal reliability amongst scale items at each day of ICU stay. Moreover, we calculated the median score contribution of each item per total TIL24 score. The association between each TIL24 item score and ICP24, CPP24, physician concern of ICP, and physician concern of CPP was calculated with rrm values. Finally, we trained LMER models regressing ICP24 and CPP24 on all TIL items (with categorical dummy encoding) and DayICU concurrently. The \u03b2LMER values from these models were interpreted as the average change in ICP24 or CPP24 associated with each treatment when accounting for all other ICP-guided treatments, time since ICU admission, and inter-patient variability with random intercepts.TIL(Basic) information coverageWe examined the distributions of TIL(Basic)24 per TIL24 and TIL24 per TIL(Basic)24 to derive thresholds for categorizing TIL24 into TIL(Basic)24. We also calculated the information coverage (IC) of TIL(Basic) by dividing the mutual information (MI) of TIL(Basic) and TIL by the entropy of TIL. IC was calculated with TIL(Basic)24 and TIL24 for days one through seven of ICU stay, with TIL(Basic)max and TILmax, and with TIL(Basic)median and TILmedian.Statistical analysisMultiple imputation of missing values. Five of the static study variables had missing values for some of the patients in our study: GCS, GOSE, baseline prognosis scores, Marshall CT classifications, and refractory intracranial hypertension status. We assessed the patterns of missingness (Supplementary Fig. S1) and multiply imputed (m = 100) these variables with independent, stochastic predictive mean matching functions using the mice package30 (v3.9.0) in R (v4.2.3). We assumed these variables to be missing-at-random (MAR; as previously reported on CENTER-TBI data)31 and supported this assumption by training imputation models on all study measures as well as correlated auxiliary variables (e.g., raised ICP during ICU stay).For daily longitudinal study variables, we considered a value to be missing if the patient was still in the ICU and WLST had not been decided on or before that day. We assessed the longitudinal patterns of missingness (Supplementary Fig. S2) and multiply imputed (m = 100) these variables with the multivariate, time-series algorithm from the Amelia II package32 (v1.7.6) in R over the first week of ICU stay. The algorithm exploits both between-variable and within-variable correlation structures over time to stochastically impute missing time series values in independently trained runs. We validated the MAR assumption by identifying characteristics significantly associated with longitudinal variable missingness (Supplementary Table S1) and included auxiliary information associated with value missingness (e.g., reasons for stopping ICP monitoring) in the imputation model.Statistical inference. We calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) for \u03c1, rrm, \u03b2LMER, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, \u03b1, and IC values using bootstrapping with 1000 resamples of unique patients. For each resample, one of the 100 missing value imputations was randomly chosen. Therefore, confidence intervals represented the uncertainty due to patient resampling and missing value imputation.Code availabilityAll statistical analyses were performed in Python (v3.8.2) or R, and all visualizations were created in R.

    "PMC10698859": "MethodsEthical declaration and animal husbandryAll experiments were approved by the Institutional Care and Use Committee at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Cleveland. Animals were housed in groups of two or three, and exposed to a normal dark\u2013light cycle with free access to food, water, and environmental enrichment ad libitum. The health and welfare of the animals was monitored daily by the study investigators and veterinary staff at Case Western Reserve University.Behavioral training and assessmentsAnimals were acclimated to the laboratory room testing environment and cereals in the home cage for five consecutive days. The animals were also handled by the researchers twice a day to minimize any stress/anxiety prior to exposure to behavioral testing. The following week, the animals were acclimated to the various testing apparatuses, which included a 10-min session each day in the glass cylinder used in the cereal eating assessment. The animals were trained to eat at least three of each cereal type (sphere-shaped: i.e., Cocoa Puffs or donut-shaped: i.e., Fruit Loops) within the 10-min session. For acclimation to the forelimb locomotor testing platform, rats were placed on top of an open field platform \u223c10 cm in diameter and allowed to explore for 5 min. Forelimb locomotor and cereal eating pre-training was conducted for five consecutive days. Baseline behavior performance was acquired following training and before LC2H (Fig. 1A).FIG. 1.(A\u2013D) Incomplete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) severely impairs forelimb function during walking and eating behavior at chronic stages. (A) Timeline of the experimental protocol. Representative image depicting surgical SCI procedure at C2. All animals received a left hemi-lesion at C2 removing ipsilateral descending motor inputs. (B and C) Lateral cervical level two hemi-section (LC2H) severely impairs forelimb walking ability and cereal eating behavior at 3 days post-injury (DPI), 1 week post-injury (WPI), and 12 WPI. There were no significant differences across the experimental treatment groups compared with controls. Color image is available online.Forelimb function assessmentsForelimb function was determined through assessments that involved monitoring behavior that the animals performed naturally. This included the Forelimb Locomotor Scale (FLS)65 and the Irvine, Beattie, and Breshnahan (IBB) forelimb recovery scale.64 Baseline values were taken prior to injury and at 3 months after injury just prior to daily subcutaneous injection of high dose ISP or saline alone or combined with Nutella \u00b1 PNNi oral gavage administration (for 60 days) and then weekly following treatment application (Fig. 1A). Statistical comparisons were made between treatment groups and within behavioral measurements using two-way, repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with recommended post-hoc correction (Bonferroni) (GraphPad Prism).Forelimb Locomotor Scale (FLS)We used established methods detailed by Singh and colleagues to assess forelimb locomotion.65 Briefly, rats are encouraged to continuously walk on top of an elevated circular platform \u223c10 cm in diameter. Rats that remained stationary for longer than 10\u201315 sec were enticed to move by having them follow a pencil or a piece of paper, or by lightly tapping or scratching on the side of the open field. If the animal failed to respond to these stimuli, it was picked up by the forequarters and placed in the center of the open field or opposite its previous position, which usually caused it to move. Rats were recorded during locomotion using a high-speed (60 frames/sec [FPS]) camera for offline scoring to assess forelimb walking functionality. Videos were scored in a blinded fashion in slow-motion (at least 50%) playback using the Lightworks video editing software. Recorded videos containing 3\u20134 min of the animal freely walking on the elevated platform were measured using an 18-point scale (0\u201317). Animal locomotor behaviors were assessed for impairments and assigned a score reflecting the ability of the animal to perform steps that were consistently plantar, parallel, and weight-bearing.65IBB Forelimb Recovery ScaleThese testing methods were established previously.64 Briefly, animals were placed in the 25 cm H \u00d7 20 cm W clear glass cylinder that was used for previous acclimation and training. Each rat was given one sphere-shaped (Cocoa Puff) and one donut-shaped (Fruit Loop) cereal to eat. Their manipulations of the cereals were recorded using a high-speed (60 FPS) camera for offline scoring to measure forelimb and digit abilities during eating. Videos were scored blinded in slow-motion (at least 50%) playback using the Lightworks video editing software. Recorded videos containing the animal eating one sphere-shaped cereal (i.e., Cocoa Puff) and one donut-shaped cereal (Fruit Loop) were measured using a 10-point scale (0\u20139).64 The animal's ability to dexterously manipulate the cereals was assessed for impairments and assigned a score reflecting the ability of the animal to grasp the cereal with subtle adjustments made using the second, third, and fourth digits and wrist movements.64Stimulation of forelimb utilizationAll animals were placed in a pool (4\u2019 diameter) filled to a depth of \u223c46 cm at a temperature of 35\u201338\u00b0C to match the rat's natural internal temperature. Animals were placed in the pool for 1 min. Two to four rats were placed in the pool at one time. After swimming, rats were partially dried with a cotton towel and then placed in empty cages lined with paper towels and allowed to further dry and groom themselves uninterrupted for 1 h at room temperature. The rats were then replaced back into their home cages. Swimming took place 5 days a week beginning 2 weeks after treatment application began, excluding the day prior to and the day of behavioral acquisition using the FLS and IBB assessments described (Fig. 1A).LC2H injury and systemic treatmentsSCI surgeries were performed as previously described.53 Adult female Sprague Dawley rats (280 \u00b1 20 g; Harlan Laboratories Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA) were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine + xylazine cocktail (70 mg kg\u22121/7 mg kg\u22121). The dorsal neck-shoulder area was shaved, cleaned, and sanitized using Betadine and 70% ethyl alcohol, and analgesics were administered through subcutaneous injection of meloxicam (1 mg kg\u22121). Body temperature was maintained and monitored throughout the surgery at 37 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. A dorsal midline incision \u223c3 cm in length was made over the cervical region. After the skin and paravertebral muscles were retracted, a laminectomy was performed over C2 and the rostral spinal cord was exposed (Fig. 1A). A 21G syringe needle was positioned at the midline of the spinal cord, and a left lateral durotomy and hemi-section were performed caudal to the C2 dorsal roots making certain that the needle tip extended to and was dragged along the ventral bony lamina surface. This process was repeated five times and ranged from the midline to the most lateral extent of the spinal cord. The muscle layers were sutured together with 3-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using wound clips. The animals were given meloxicam (1 mg kg\u22121) and sterile saline subcutaneously for up to 5 days post-surgery along with nutritional support if their weight dropped >5% of what it had been pre-injury. The anatomical completeness of the injury was confirmed through microscopy and behavioral assessment. Post-injury animals exhibited no signs of malnutrition or infection, but those that exhibited persistent autophagy as a result of the injury before or during the systemic treatment phase were excluded from the study. Before initiating any systemic treatments, all animals were confirmed to have achieved a performance score \u22644.5 \u00b1 1 out of 17 at 3 days post-injury (DPI) as described in the locomotor assessment, and a score of 8 \u00b1 1 12 weeks post-injury (WPI) (Figs. 1C and 2; see Forelimb Locomotor Scale section).65 For cereal eating assessments, all animals were confirmed to have received a performance \u22640 \u00b1 1 out of 9 at 3 DPI, and 2 \u00b1 1 at 12 WPI (Figs. 1B and 4; see IBB Forelimb Recovery Scale section).64FIG. 2.(A\u2013C) The Forelimb Locomotor Score (FLS) is significantly improved following systemic treatment to remove chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the perineuronal net (PNN) and/or modulate receptor PTP\u03c3. (A) Chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) rats were measured for forelimb locomotor function before and after lateral cervical level two hemi-section (LC2H) and systemic intracellular sigma peptide (ISP) \u00b1 perineuronal net inhibitor (PNNi). Both ISP \u00b1 PNNi significantly improved weight-bearing stepping after chronic PTP\u03c3-PNN binding perturbation (average FLS score ISP analysis of variance [ANOVA], p = 0.037). (B, C) At 24 weeks post-injury (WPI), animals receiving either systemic drug showed an average improvement in walking behavior, with combinatory recovery showing the greatest significance and rate of recovery (p* < 0.05, p** < 0.005, p*** < 0.0005). Bonferonni post-hoc analysis, data are reported as average \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Color image is available online.Three months after LC2H, the rats were randomly assigned to begin a systemic treatment protocol that included a daily 0.5 mL subcutaneous injection of 500 \u03bcg of intracellular sigma peptide (ISP) under the skin of the back near the lesion, combined with oral gavage feeding of Nutella mixed with sunflower oil with or without the small molecule (0.2 g/mL) perineuronal net inhibitor, PNNi. Experimental animals were fed PNNi mixed with hazelnut spread thinned with sunflower oil twice daily at a dose at 2 g/kg based on weight. Control animals were injected with saline and fed hazelnut spread thinned with sunflower oil not containing PNNi. Two separate cohorts received ISP or PNNi alone. These systemic treatments were administered with the goal of simultaneously disrupting the interaction between would-be sprouting axons and the rPTP\u03c3 receptor as well as to reduce the density of inhibitory extracellular perineuronal net components. Each cohort (n = 8\u201310) received the treatments daily for 60 days and were tested and assessed blindly each week for arm and hand function for the duration of treatment, and continuing 4 weeks following the termination of treatments. Our assessments (see details subsequently) of forelimb/paw function were conducted using the FLS65 and the IBB forelimb recovery scale.64 Both are rating scales similar to the well-known Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scoring method for overground walking, but are focused on the forelimb and digits.66Low-magnification histology of serotonergic fibers, PNNs, and confirming completeness of the cervical injuryAt 24 WPI, animals received an overdose of anesthesia prior to cardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Spinal tissue containing regions of interest were dissected and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. Prior to sectioning, the tissue was cryoprotected with sequential treatments first in a solution of 30% sucrose in PBS and then in a 1:1 mixture of 30% sucrose in PBS + OCT for 2 days; 30 \u03bcm coronal sections of tissue were prepared rostral to caudal from cryoprotected cervical spinal cords (C5\u2013C8) using a Leica Cryostat. Immunofluorescence staining was performed using standard protocols. (Refer to Table 1 for a detailed list of primary antibodies.) In each case, primary antibodies were conjugated to an appropriate Alexa Fluor-containing secondary antibody for microscopic visualization. Nuclei were visualized using Hoechst a 33342 staining. Following the antibody staining, tissue sections were mounted to slides, protected with ProLong Diamond Mounting Medium, cover-slipped, and examined either with an inverted Leica SP8 confocal microscope or a Zeiss Axio Imager microscope.Table 1.Antibodies Used in This StudyAntigenHost speciesDilutionVendorCatalog numberGFAPChicken1/1000EnCor BiotechnologyCPCA-GFAPBiotinylated-WFA lectin-1/500Vector LaboratoriesB-1355Cat 301 (ACAN)Mouse1/1000MilliporeMAB5284SERTRabbit1/1000EnCor BiotechnologyRPCA-SERTIba1Rabbit1/1000EnCor BiotechnologyRPCA-IBA1Neuro Filament (NF)Rabbit1/1000EnCor BiotechnologyRPCA-NF-H5 HTRabbit1/1000Immuno Star20080Strepavidin; Alexa Fluor 555-1/500Invitrogen (Life Technologies)S32355Mouse; Alexa Fluor 488Donkey1/500Invitrogen (Life Technologies)A21202Chicken; Alexa Fluor 488Donkey1/500Jackson Immuno Research703-545-155Rabbit; Alexa Fluor 488Donkey1/500Invitrogen (Life Technologies)A21206Mouse; Alexa Fluor 555Donkey1/500Invitrogen (Life Technologies)A31570Chicken; Alexa Fluor 555Goat1/500Invitrogen (Life Technologies)A21437Hoechst 33342, trihydrochloride trihydrate-1/3000Invitrogen (Life Technologies)A21437Quantification of Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA)+ aggregatesTissues from three separate animals per treatment condition were evaluated. For a given animal, 12\u201315 representative images were captured (\u223c 5 images per section per anatomical segment). The number of WFA bright inclusions were totaled using the Cell Counter Plugin of the FIJI Image Analysis Software. In Figure 8P\u2013R, each dot represents the number of inclusions counted in a single image.Lesion area and volumeSixteen spinal cords were selected for analysis from the total available using a random number generator. Sections were obtained using a cryostat at 30 \u03bcm/section spanning a \u223c15-mm-long cervical segment containing the LC2H. Spinal cord lesion area and volume were analyzed through fluorescent Nissl staining (ThermoFischer) performed on cross-sectioned tissue of each spinal cord at 500-\u03bcm intervals. The coverage of the lesion as well as the location was determined using a Zeiss Axio Imager microscope and quantified blindly using National Institutes of Health (NIH) ImageJ software analysis of three to four sections per animal that included the lesion epicenter by using monochromatic image and background readings subtracted at the defined area of interest. In all subjects, the left half of the cervical spinal cord was completely severed from the midline to the lateral-most extent of the tissue, and there were no deviations (Fig, 1A).Statistical analysisFor statistical analysis, divergences where p < 0.05 were considered significant. Sample size for the in vivo behavioral studies was based on a power calculation in which \u03b1 = 0.05 and \u03b2 = 0.80, resulting in n = 8. Power analysis was conducted prior to all experiments to ensure that numbers (n) of animals per group were sufficient. The data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). To ensure a normal distribution, data were subjected to the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test for normalcy prior to analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni correction (GraphPad Prism). At the time of processing and analyses of all experiments and assessments, investigators were blinded as to the treatment group of each animal. The functional and behavioral recordings from every animal in each group were analyzed without exclusion based on the outcome.",
    "PMC10902500": "MethodsStudy sampleData for this cross-sectional study were obtained from the Naval Health Research Center's (NHRC) MilCo Study, an ongoing Department of Defense (DOD) study. Sampling and recruitment methods are described elsewhere.55\u201359 In brief, MilCo enrollment began in 2001, with a new round of service members recruited in panels every three years until 2011, with a total of four recruited panels.59,60 These analyses included participants from panels 2 (2004), 3 (2007), and 4 (2011).To be included in the MilCo study, panel 2 required service members to have one to two years in service, panel 3 required one to three years, and panel 4 required two to five years. This study utilized data from the most recent follow-up survey (wave 4 for panel 2, wave 3 for panel 2, and wave 2 for panel 4) conducted in 2014, which was the first to assess TBI. To be included in these analyses, service members needed to be on active duty or in the Reserves/National Guard (e.g., not veterans) with complete TBI data.Participants enrolled in the study while they were still on active duty or Reserves/National Guard. Since enrollment of each panel, some participants have retired or completed military service. There were 112,655 participants who completed the 2014 survey, including 29,286 (26.0%) participants still serving on active duty or in the Reserves/National Guard including 5100 (17.5%) from panel 2, 8565 (29.2%) from panel 3, and 15,621 (53.3%) from panel 4. There were 1023 participants missing TBI and PCS data who were excluded from analysis resulting in a final sample size of 28,263.Data collectionThe MilCo study did not use a specific tool to assess PCS; however, participants were asked questions about various health conditions and symptoms consistent with several, but not all, questions included in the RPCQ.43 This survey guided our operationalizing of individual symptoms based on the following: Participants were asked how often, in the last four weeks, they were bothered by (1) fatigue, (2) restlessness, (3) sleep disturbances, (4) poor concentration, and (5) irritability or being easily angered on a Likert scale with possible answers \u201cNot at all,\u201d \u201cSeveral days,\u201d or \u201cMore than half the days.\u201d For the analysis we collapsed \u201cSeveral days,\u201d or \u201cMore than half the days,\u201d versus \u201cNot at all.\u201dParticipants were also asked the frequency, in the previous two weeks, that they had been bothered by: (1) depression, (2) sleep disturbances, (3) fatigue, (4) poor concentration, and (5) slowed thinking on a Likert scale of \u201cNot at all,\u201d versus \u201cSeveral days,\u201d \u201cMore than half the days,\u201d and \u201cNearly every day,\u201d which were combined for the analysis.The questions, \u201cHas your doctor (in the last 3 years), told you that you have any of the following conditions? (yes/no)\u201d and \u201cHave you had persistent or recurring problems with the following? (yes/no)\u201d captured depression, headaches, memory loss or impairment, confusion, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and forgetfulness. An answer of \u201cyes\u201d to any of these questions was defined as having that symptom. If the participant answered \u201cno\u201d to similar symptoms in one question stem, but yes in another, they were categorized as having that PCS (i.e., if they said they were not bothered by depression, but said a doctor had diagnosed them with depression, this was categorized as \u201cyes\u201d for depression).For the analysis, we created the dependent variable as the total count of PCS by summing up all the PCS for which participants answered \u201cyes.\u201d Nine total PCS were identified and defined for this study.Total lifetime TBI was assessed through self-report, with participants being asked, \u201cHave you ever had an injury, such as from a fall, blow to the head, blast exposure, motor vehicle crash, sports, or any other cause that resulted in any of the following: (a) Being dazed or confused right after the injury?; (b) Being confused or not thinking clearly right after the injury?; (c) Not remembering the actual injury right after it happened?; (d) Not remembering things that happened right after the injury?; and/or (e) Losing consciousness or being knocked out?\u201d Participants were categorized as ever having a TBI if they answered \u201cyes\u201d to any of these questions.Those who experienced a TBI were then asked the number of times they experienced this before and during military service. For our TBI variable, those who reported never having a TBI were categorized as none, while the summation of those who did was categorized as one, two, three, and four or more.Covariates included years of age, sex (male/female), and race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Other), military rank (enlisted/officer), military occupational category (MOC\u2014 Administration & Executives, Infantry/Tactical Operations, Electronics Repair & Engineering, Communications & Intelligence, Health Care, Technical & Professional, Craftworkers & Supply, Other/Not Specified), military status (active duty, Reserve, National Guard), and military branch (Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Navy).We also included post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which was assessed using the validated Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Civilian Checklist (PCL-C). The checklist measures PTSD symptoms on a scale of 17 to 85 and requires a summed score of at least 50 for an individual to be categorized as experiencing PTSD. We categorized PTSD as yes/no based on the cutoff score of at least 50. Participants were also asked about negative combat experiences that included eight questions about experiences such as seeing dead bodies or knowing someone killed. The total experiences were summed and categorized as 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4+.Time in service for each panel was calculated by estimating the midpoint for time each panel likely would have entered the military based on enrollment criteria for the MilCo Study up until the survey was released to participants in 2014.Statistical analysesFrequencies and means were used to describe the sample population demographics and occupational characteristics. The frequencies of service-related lifetime TBIs were calculated for each participant as well as the overall and individual PCS. Bivariate analyses were conducted for the total number of TBIs, as well as the number of negative combat experiences, by the number of PCS (grouped as 0, 1-2, 3-5, \u22656), with associations examined using chi-square testing.We also examined the total lifetime TBIs by the mean and standard error of the total number of PCS using Kruskal-Wallis testing. To examine the associations between lifetime TBIs and counts of PCS, we calculated unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using multi-variable zero-inflated negative binomial regression models; the offset was time in service. Any variable changing the adjusted relationship between TBI and PCS by more than 10% was retained in the final model.Further, variables were evaluated for inclusion in the model using purposeful selection, as described by Hosmer and Lemeshow.61 Model fit was evaluated with likelihood ratio tests and Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). All included variables improved the model fit and were statistically significant by the likelihood ratio test. The variance of PCS at each level of TBI was more than twice the mean at each level, and the alpha parameter indicated overdispersion was present, indicating Poisson count models were likely to be a poor fit of the data.Further, 28% of participants reported zero PCS, indicating zero inflation may be present. Based on the AICs, a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model was a better fit compared with negative binomial and Poisson models. Therefore, we report findings obtained from the ZINB models used for final reporting. Statistical analyses were conducted using R54 (univariate, bivariate, Kruskal-Wallis testing) and Stata version 14.255 (model building and analysis) statistical software programs.",
    "PMC10698787": "MethodsReview of clinical standard of careIn this review, our goal is first to summarize current standards of clinical care for adults with acute SCI in the human population. Thus, we referenced the most recent \u201cGuidelines for the Management of Acute Cervical Spine and Spinal Cord Injuries\u201d published by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons as well as the clinical practice guideline entitled \u201cEarly Acute Management in Adults with Spinal Cord Injury\u201d published in 2008 by the Consortium for Spinal Cord Medicine.6\u201310In addition, we referenced UpToDate,\u00ae an online database for clinical care standards described as an \u201cEvidence-Based Clinical Decision Support System\u201d offered by Wolters Kluwer. UpToDate\u00ae is widely utilized by physicians and healthcare providers for point-of-care reference as they make clinical decisions and so substantively contributes to a summary of practices currently utilized to manage acute SCI.We utilized UpToDate\u00ae both to cite its peer-reviewed and edited content directly and also to find journal articles from its cited sources provided for each healthcare summary. The primary summaries cited were \u201cAcute traumatic spinal cord injury,\u201d \u201cAnesthesia for adults with acute spinal cord injury,\u201d and \u201cOverview of inpatient management of the adult trauma patient.\u201d11\u201313 We also referenced other UpToDate\u00ae summaries concerning care for medically related complications as are reported completely in our Works Cited list.2,14\u201320Finally, we searched PubMed\u00ae for published, peer-reviewed journal articles describing healthcare guidelines for acute care of adults with SCI. We prioritized reference of the most recent guidelines, reviews, and meta-analyses available for a better understanding of current care standards. Our evaluation of PubMed\u00ae results generated by our search queries was not intended to be exhaustive, but qualitative. Our collaborator and co-author, practicing spinal neurosurgeon, and researcher Dr. H. Francis Farhadi, provided oversight of our description of current standard of care for SCI.Review of high cervical SCI surgery veterinary aftercareOur focus for this portion of the review was on commonly utilized rodent models of high cervical SCI defined as C4 and above. Thus, we conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed\u00ae to find publications describing aftercare protocols for contusive and hemisection injuries in mice and rats. Search inputs were as follows: (C2 hemisection rat) OR (C2Hx rat) OR (C2 hemisection mouse) OR (C2 hemisection mice) OR (C2Hx mouse) OR (C2Hx mice) OR (high cervical contusion rat) OR (high cervical contusion mouse) OR (high cervical contusion mice). Literature reviews, clinical studies, and articles not written in English were excluded.After closer evaluation of study content, articles were also excluded if they did not utilize a contusive or hemisection injury model, if the level of injury fell caudal to the C4 spinal segment, if the induced SCI was a terminal procedure, or if a description of aftercare methods was omitted. We analyzed at least five of the most recent qualifying publications from each senior author included in the initial list of publications compiled by our search. In cases wherein a particular senior author had fewer than five publications meeting our criteria, all were evaluated. Of the 192 entries returned by our initial search criteria, 98 were ultimately included in this review.Clinical care for spinal cord injuryThe first recorded description of medical treatment of spinal cord injury can be found in the Edwin Smith-translated surgical papyrus thought to be written by the Egyptian physician Imhotep in the 30th century B.C.21 The writer described SCI as \u201can ailment not to be treated,\u201d and such a bleak assessment of SCI prognosis remained in essence unchanged for almost 5000 years until the 19th century A.D.21,22 Once medical professionals began to propose and develop treatments for persons with SCIs, their efforts targeted prevention of additional central neurotrauma after the initial insult through surgical decompression and, peripherally, on managing or preventing complications.22Even now, promising pre-clinical and clinical therapies targeted at the reversal of functional loss induced by SCI have not yet become a part of standard clinical practice.23 Today, the standard of care still consists exclusively of treatments that seek to preserve remaining neurological function and prevent complications, but these are now better defined and standardized according to the history of injury as well as clinical signs and symptoms. These standards of care can be categorized and discussed as below with findings summarized in Table 1.Table 1.Summary of Clinical Care Standards for High Cervical SCIInterventionPurposeClinical CareAirway & breathingMaintenance of respiratory functionIntubate at first indication of respiratory dysfunction, ventilating with 10 mL/kg body mass & PEEP of 0-5 cmH2O.

Maintenance: For somatosensory evoked potentials I.V. propofol, inhaled sevoflurane, and I.V. opioid (remifentanil, sufentanil, or fentanyl) with any neuromuscular blocking agent.Motor evoked potentials (MEP) or electromyography (EMG) no neuromuscular blocking agentsFor MEP: propofol, sevoflurane, and an opioidFor EMG: sevoflurane and an opioidElectroencephalogram or electrocorticography I.V. remifentanil and a muscle relaxant with either inhaled anesthetic (nitrous oxide or sevoflurane) or I.V. dexmedetomidine and propofol. Urinary and bowel careBladder voiding and defecationUrinary catheterization and bowel assistance as needed for prevention of bladder distension and \u22651 bowel movement per day.SteroidsNeuroprotectionMethylprednisolone not recommended as first-line SCI treatment.Airway and breathing interventionsRespiratory failure is common after cervical or high thoracic SCI as signified by increasing respiratory rate, decreasing forced vital capacity, increasing pCO2, or decreasing PO2 and necessitates urgent intubation and mechanical ventilation.11 Special care should be taken in cases of cervical immobilization.11 Even in patients who do not require mechanical ventilation, hypoxemia is common and must be recognized and addressed via administration of supplemental oxygen.8 Because of the common need for intensive cardiopulmonary monitoring and ventilation, the intensive care unit (ICU) is the most appropriate hospital setting for cervical SCI care.6,8It is best to perform intubation for ventilation in controlled, non-emergent circumstances, so it is preferred to intubate at the first signs of respiratory distress in persons with SCIs at C5 or above.8,24 For patients likely to require long-term ventilation, tracheostomy is recommended as an early intervention, and orotracheal is preferred to nasotracheal intubation in the short-term.24 For the most part, ventilator settings are left to the judgment of the attending physician, but it is important to balance the concerns regarding ventilatory-induced lung injury at higher tidal volumes and increased collapse of small airways (atelectasis) at lower volumes.14 As a guide, care standards suggest a tidal volume of 10 mL/kg of body mass.14Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) consists of residual positive pressure at the end of each inspiration imposed by mechanical ventilation to prevent atelectasis because the inflation generated by positive pressure ventilation decreases with each expiration.14,25 Optimal settings in patients with SCI who have respiratory failure are not fully standardized, but typical practice is to use 0-5 cm H2O of PEEP, avoiding overinflation.14 Exogenous surfactant administration also can serve to prevent atelectasis.25 Even in spontaneously breathing patients, positive pressure is often administered through nasal cannula to enhance airway opening.Anesthesia for intubationFor facilitation of intubation induction of anesthesia via propofol and thiopental is common in patients who have no hemodynamic instability, but etomidate and ketamine are viable alternatives and are likely safer for patients at risk for hypotension.6 If within 48 h of injury, a short-acting neuromuscular blocker such as succinylcholine should be used, but after 48h a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent is the paralytic of choice.6Chest physical therapy for patients with respiratory motor dysfunctionBeginning as soon as possible after injury, all persons with cervical or thoracic SCI are recommended to undergo chest physical therapy whether intubated or not to assist with improving respiratory function and health.6,14 Techniques employed include deep breathing, glossopharyngeal breathing, and accessory muscle training, positioning changes, postural secretion drainage, manually assisted (quad) coughing, percussion, vibration, and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation.6,14 Suctioning is also performed, through the tracheostomy if present or via the nasotracheal or orotracheal route.6,14 Suctioning in non-intubated patients, however, misses the left mainstem bronchus 90% of the time because of anatomical orientation, and is also uncomfortable for the patient and could damage the larynx.14Oral hygiene care for mechanically ventilated patientsGood oral care significantly reduces the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia by reducing the prevalence of mouth flora that could be aspirated while the epiglottis is bypassed by an endotracheal tube.26,27 The specific care protocol is not standardized, however, with different sources indicating different frequencies of tooth brushing and varied application methods for the various types of antimicrobial paste used.26,27 In the ICU, nurses typically perform their hospital's oral care procedures at least once per day, often including chlorhexidine application.26,27Cardiovascular managementAfter a high traumatic SCI, there is great risk of hemodynamic and/or neurogenic shock stemming from blood loss or interruption of sympathetic tone, respectively.8,11 Shock manifests as inadequate cardiac output and/or hypotension that worsen neurological outcome and can lead to death by hypoperfusion of vital tissues.8,11,28 Many post-SCI patients able to breathe without mechanical ventilation still experience hypoxemia despite adequate alveolar ventilation likely because of ventilation/perfusion mismatch.8 Thus, the ICU is the most appropriate care setting for patients with SCI because of the close monitoring necessary to identify and manage cardiopulmonary issues.6,8Early infusion of intravenous fluids and/or blood transfusions are vital to maintain an appropriate mean arterial blood pressure (BP), which is considered to be 85\u201390 mm Hg by most guidelines.6,8,11,28,29 Other therapeutic targets include systolic blood pressure of 90\u2013100 mm Hg and heart rate (HR) of 60\u2013100 beats per minute.11,29 Fluid status must be monitored (target of urine output >30 mL/h) to avoid exacerbation of spinal cord swelling, kidney dysfunction, and edema, as well as other relevant pathologies.11,29 In addition to fluid resuscitation, sources of cardiovascular dysfunction apart from neurogenic shock (e.g., blood loss) should be determined and remedied.Cervical or high thoracic SCIs (above T6) often lead to loss of sympathetic innervation and might require treatment with norepinephrine for its chronotropic and vasopressor activity at both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors.6,28,29 Vasopressors with only alpha-adrenergic activity such as phenylephrine or midrodine are more appropriate for management of hypotension caused by more distal SCIs, but caution should be used with midrodine because of its propensity to cause urinary retention.6,28,29 Close monitoring is required to avoid inducing elevated intracerebral pressure and cerebral edema via vasopressor treatment.28Bradycardia might require management with external pacing, atropine, or other pacemaker drugs,6,11 During anesthesia, ephedrine is preferred because of its alpha and beta-1 agonist activity that increases BP and cardiac output in persons with bradycardia.18 Norepinephrine and epinephrine are alternatives, but either requires central line placement for administration or is more suited for acute hypotensive episodes such as cardiac arrest or anaphylaxis, respectively.18 Phenylephrine or vasopressin/terlipressin can be used during anesthesia in persons with elevated or normal HR, but vasopressin and its analogues are most appropriate for refractory hypotension and are used as a last resort in context of neurological injury because of their propensity to induce cerebral vasoconstriction.18AnalgesicsAnalgesia is important to ameliorate individuals' pain after SCI. Ideally, the chosen analgesic will have fast onset, no risk of causing dependence, allodynia, or hyperalgesia, and have no side effects.19 All of these criteria are not to be met in any single agent, so a multi-modal approach is usually taken.19 Overall, intravenous administration is preferred acutely after SCI. Opioids are the first-line treatment for pain in the critically ill patient, but their use after SCI, especially at the cervical level, might be limited because of their respiratory depressive effects because patients' respiratory function is often impaired after injury.19In addition, opioids' sedative effects tend to impair neuromonitoring, which is often necessary acutely after SCI for diagnostic and surgical purposes.6,11,17 For these patients, a short acting opioid is most appropriate, such as fentanyl or remifentanil.19 Morphine is also commonly used, but has increased proclivity toward causing pruritis and has a longer duration of action.For non-opioid analgesia, acetaminophen is most commonly utilized, while non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen are uncommonly used.19 The primary contraindication to acetaminophen is hepatic insufficiency while the list of contraindications to NSAIDs is much more extensive, including recent surgery and surgical bleeding, non-surgical bleeding, renal dysfunction, platelet abnormality, heart failure, cirrhosis, asthma, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy.19Further, cell culture and animal studies have indicated that NSAID use can inhibit bone healing\u2014a risk worth considering for human cases of SCI, despite some conflicting clinical data discussed in recent meta-analyses.30\u201332 Patients with SCI often undergo surgery, need unimpaired bone regrowth, and are likely to have other comorbidities that contraindicate NSAID therapy, rendering acetaminophen a more appropriate analgesic.19For refractory pain, ketamine has shown promise and can reduce the necessary opioid dosage to attain an appropriate level of pain control.6,19 Gabapentinoids such as gabapentin or pregabalin are additional options available for management of specifically neuropathic pain, or to reduce dependence on other analgesics in the long term.6,19 For persons with SCI unable to control their own analgesic administration via manipulation of a button, breath controlled methods can be used.6AntibioticsMore rostral SCIs confer greater risk of pneumonia than more caudal injuries.33\u201335 In addition, SCI in general renders patients more susceptible to infections of various sorts, a phenomenon thought to be influenced by a neurogenic mechanism termed spinal cord injury-induced immune deficiency syndrome (SCI-IDS).33\u201335 In addition to pneumonia, other common infectious pathologies associated with cervical SCI include urinary tract infections (UTIs) and infections at the site of a penetrating injury.28The use of antibiotics is not indicated as prophylaxis for infection related to SCI per se because of guidelines intended to minimize antibiotic overuse and antibiotic resistance.26 Prophylaxis can become necessary, however, if surgery is needed, or if there is polytrauma involving open fractures or penetrating injuries to the thorax.13 When antibiotic prophylaxis is warranted or when management of infection from a penetrating injury is necessary, the empiric antibiotic therapy is highly dependent on the specific context and anatomical location of injury or surgery type.Empiric therapy for hospital or ventilator-associated pneumonia should cover Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other gram-negative bacilli while the specific antibiotics utilized depend on hospital-specific prevalence of bacterial strains and patient characteristics.16 For UTIs in patients with SCI treated within the ICU, recommended empiric therapy should be instituted with both an antipseudomonal carbapenem and either vancomycin or a combination of both linezolid and daptomycin to cover methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).15 For all empiric regimens, treatments should appropriately change as analysis of patient samples and hospital-specific characteristics dictate.AnticoagulationPersons with SCI are designated as a population at high risk for blood clot formation because immobilization after SCI often causes venous stasis leading to hypercoagulability and possibly life-threatening complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.29 Thus, anticoagulative prophylaxis with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the standard of care after SCI.The LMWH is usually accompanied by mechanical prophylaxis that includes use of compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression.14,29 In cases wherein there is a heightened bleeding risk, mechanical measures can be used without pharmacological intervention. It is recommended to implement LMWH therapy as soon as possible after SCI and for at least 12 weeks, with brief interruption for necessary surgery.14,29 Unfractionated heparin is an alternative if LMWH cannot be used, but evidence indicates lower efficacy.14 Treatment with warfarin or direct anticoagulants is not recommended for acute SCI because of the heightened bleeding risk.14Dermatologic careMeasures to prevent pressure sore formation are required for every immobilized patient with SCI and especially those with loss of somatosensation. Once patients' injuries are stabilized, logrolling is the standard technique utilized to shift the patient such that one aspect of the body is not constantly weight bearing.6,11 Use of pressure-reducing cushions and bedding is also effective. Alternatively, a specialized rotating bed for patients with SCI can be used where available.11 Frequent inspection of the skin integrity, especially at dependent areas overlying bony prominences, is vital as well as elimination of excess moisture and heat applied near the skin.6NutritionSwallow function must be evaluated before beginning oral feeding in any patient with cervical SCI.6 Only if risk of aspiration is low can oral feeding safely occur. Enteral feeding is preferred above parenteral whenever possible and should begin early, ideally within 72h of injury, once the patient is stable and able to tolerate it.6,7,9,13 Contraindications to enteral nutrition include progressive ileus, bowel obstruction, massive bowel resection, malabsorption, splanchnic hypoperfusion, fistulae, and insufficiency of enteral nutrition to meet caloric requirements.7,13 Total caloric requirements should be calculated by a 30-min energy expenditure measurement via indirect calorimetry, although it is important to correct for its propensity for overestimation.6,7,9Blood glucose levels should be monitored and treatment instituted to prevent hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia in patients with SCI is common and is associated with greater death and disability at one year after injury.6,13,36,37 The standard for control of hyperglycemia is intensive insulin therapy, with a target range for blood glucose of 80\u2013110 mg/dL.6,13,36 Hypoglycemia is best prevented through nutrition according to guidelines described above to prevent exacerbation of neurological injury.Stress ulcer prophylaxisCurrent standards define traumatic SCI patients and those on mechanical ventilation for >48h as high risk for stress ulcers and ulcer-associated gastrointestinal bleeding and thus recommend that all such patients receive prophylaxis for 4 weeks.6,11,13,20,38 Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are more protective against gastrointestinal bleeding than histamine receptor 2 (H2) blockers, and pantoprazole is the most common enterally administered PPI prescribed.6,11,20 There is an increased risk of Clostridioides difficile colitis, however, associated with PPI prophylaxis, that could recommend prescription of H2 blockers as a possible alternative.6,13,20Temperature regulationPoikilothermia, or an inability to maintain core body temperature, is common in cervical and high thoracic SCI and especially during anesthesia.6,12 Thus, body temperature must be measured and regulated appropriately until the individual is able to maintain appropriate body temperature \u223c37\u00b0C.6,12 Hypothermia is the most common manifestation of temperature dysfunction in persons with SCI, and so blanketing (heated or not) and warming of intravenous fluids are common and effective interventions.12 Continued monitoring is important to avoid accidental hyperthermia, because sweating function is often impaired below spinal cord lesion.Timing of spinal surgeryFor penetrating SCIs, surgery is often indicated for foreign body removal and disinfection.11 To prevent neurological deterioration and achieve mechanical stability of the spine, surgical stabilization, reduction, or decompression is indicated if spinal instability, ligamentous damage, or neurological dysfunction is severe or progressive enough.6,11,29For cervical SCI, these metrics can be assessed through the Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Classification (SLIC) scales determined by analysis of imaging and clinical findings wherein a score >4 indicates a need for operative management.29 A T2 MRI is the gold standard for evaluation of spinal cord compression and vascular or ligamentous injury when available and clinically appropriate, while CT is the first-line imaging modality but cannot image spinal cord or other soft tissue as well as MRI.11,25,29Closed reduction is a management option for cervical spine fractures with subluxation, but not for thoracic or lumbar injuries.11 Irrespective of the neural complete or incomplete nature of the SCI as assessed by the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS), current evidence supports early neural decompression within 24h of SCI when medically feasible.6,11,25,29,39Anesthesia for spinal surgeryFor facilitation of spinal surgery, there are particular considerations with respect to appropriate anesthesia. Closed reduction can be facilitated through administration of a muscle relaxant or analgesic such as diazepam or meperidine. Induction of general anesthesia for open surgical approaches is intravenous, commonly consisting of propofol, ketamine, and etomidate.12 Of note, inhalable anesthesia is not commonly utilized for induction.12Maintenance protocols for general anesthesia differ according to the type of neuromonitoring that is performed during the procedure.12,17 All inhaled agents tend to affect neuromonitoring to a greater degree than intravenous drugs, but many neuromonitoring modalities can tolerate low-dose sevoflurane.6,17 For cases indicating measurement of somatosensory evoked potentials, an appropriate maintenance protocol consists of intravenous propofol, inhaled sevoflurane, and intravenous opioid (remifentanil, sufentanil, or fentanyl) with any neuromuscular blocking agent (succinylcholine, rocuronium).6,17No neuromuscular blocking agents can be used during motor evoked potentials (MEP) or electromyography (EMG).17 Specific protocols for MEP consist of propofol, sevoflurane, and an opioid while EMG requires low-dose sevoflurane and an opioid.17 Testing with an electroencephalogram or electrocorticography indicates intravenous remifentanil and a muscle relaxant with either inhaled anesthetic (nitrous oxide or sevoflurane) or intravenous dexmedetomidine and propofol.17Urinary and bowel careUrinary dysfunction is common acutely after SCI, and indwelling urinary catheterization is part of the initial patient assessment unless contraindicated or in cases wherein there is no suspicion or sign of urinary retention.6,11 Bladder distention can be assessed by palpation or ultrasound.6,11 After 3 or 4 days post-injury, indwelling catheters can sometimes safely be removed in preference for intermittent catheterization to decrease infection risk.6,11 For persons with SCI and gut dysmotility, one bowel movement per day is the goal.6SteroidsMethylprednisolone (MP) was observed to have efficacy in reducing peritumoral cerebral edema and inspired MP's off-label use in the clinic to reduce edema in SCI beginning in the 1960s.40 Promisingly, animal experiments demonstrated that MP treatment reduced edema, prevented intracellular hypokalemia, and improved neurological recovery after SCI because of its inhibition of lipid peroxidation and other mechanisms.11,40 Multiple randomized controlled trials in the human population, however, have since evaluated MP after SCI, but any neurological improvement attributed to MP treatment has tended to be small and inconsistent while adverse effects attributable to MP were more robust and repeatable.6,9,11,41 Thus, MP is no longer recommended as a first-line treatment for SCI.6,9,11,41 If used despite recommendations, the best MP protocol for SCI seems to begin within 8h of injury and last for no more than 24h.25Veterinary care standards after C2 hemisection and high cervical contusion injury in mice and ratsThe C2 hemisection (C2Hx) is a well-established animal model of a controlled, laceration-type incomplete SCI that generates consistent respiratory motor deficits ipsilateral to the lesion.42\u201346 While the C2Hx is vital for the study of treatments to ameliorate a controlled, unilateral functional deficit, cervical contusion utilizes a clinically relevant forceful impact to model SCI.47\u201350 High cervical spinal cord contusions, however, lead to less consistently severe respiratory motor deficits than hemisections.47\u201350Because of these two injury models' complementary strengths and weaknesses, studies using C2Hxs and cervical contusions together portray a more complete picture of high cervical SCI than either approach alone. Thus, both experimental models in mice and rats are vital to our comparison of veterinary care protocols to the clinical treatment of spontaneous SCI in humans.In the following sections, we will summarize veterinary care protocols used by the various laboratories studying C2Hx and high cervical contusions in mice and rats, organizing (where applicable) each intervention into the same categories we used to describe clinical care standard for SCI (Table 2). Where protocols substantively differ between various laboratories, we will list the specific interventions used by each research group.Table 2.Summary of Veterinary Care for Experimental High Cervical SCI in Murine AnimalsInterventionPurposeClinical CareAirway & breathingIntraoperative blood gas controlSome laboratories intubate and ventilate animals during SCI surgery.Cardiovascular managementReplace blood lossFluid injections during and after surgery.AnalgesicsPain reliefMost common:.

No additional considerations of PEEP, chest physical therapy, or oral hygiene are described for either intraoperative or post-injury intubation or mechanical ventilation.Cardiovascular managementAfter SCI surgery, subcutaneous fluids (physiological saline or lactated Ringer solution) are often administered to maintain hydration.43,47,48,51,54,55,59,65\u2013106 Murine subjects are usually provided access ad libitum to drinking water immediately after surgeries with accommodations for limited mobility such as extended waterspouts.AnalgesicsThe Askew, Baekey, Bonay, Chang, Fehlings, Gonzalez-Rothi, Goshgarian, Hsu, Lane, Lee, Lepore, Mansart, Tsai, and sometimes the Alilain, Decherchi, Fuller, Nantwi, Reier, and Vinit laboratories implement post-SCI systemic analgesic monotherapy with buprenorphine (a partial mu opioid receptor agonist).47,48,51,69\u201371,74\u201377,80\u201383,86,90,92-96,99\u2013101,106\u2013113 The Gauthier laboratory used pentazocine (an opioid), the Luk\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1 laboratory utilized metamizole (a non-opioid analgesic with activity at central cyclooxygenase-3), and the Novikov laboratory utilized flunixin (an NSAID) as monotherapy.60,91,114,115 For the Descherchi laboratory, their aftercare protocol sometimes consists of a combination of dextropropoxyphene (an opioid) and acetaminophen administered through drinking water.87 Post-SCI analgesic treatment for Kastner laboratory animals included acetaminophen with codeine and/or morphine sulfate.84,116\u2013118Drs. Sieck and Mantilla usually post-operatively treat their experimental rats and mice with either acetaminophen and buprenorphine together or acetaminophen alone.119\u2013128 In one rat contusion study, the Sieck and Mantilla group administered the NSAID carprofen ad libitum through the drinking water in addition to injectable buprenorphine.79 In other studies, the Alilain, Bolser, Dale, Fuller, Mitchell, Mateika, Reier, Sankari, and Vinit laboratories utilize a dual systemic approach consisting of both buprenorphine and NSAID administration (either carprofen or meloxicam).43,5256,58,59,61\u201365,67,68,73,78,88,89,97,103,129\u2013133During and immediately following Alilain and Kastner laboratory SCI surgeries, bupivacaine or procaine (sodium channel blockers) are often used for short-term, localized paralytic and analgesic effects.47,48,84,132 The recent cervical hemi-contusion publication from the Fern\u00e1ndez-Mu\u00f1oz laboratory stated that they treated animals with analgesics, but the specific protocol was not detailed.104 Notably, the publications from the Cox, Feron, and Xu groups included no analgesic protocol for their post-SCI animals.98,102,105AntibioticsNo systemic prophylactic or responsive antibiotic treatment was included in the cervical SCI care protocols described by the Alilain, Askew, Baekey, Bolser, Chang, Dale, Fehlings, Gonzalez-Rothi, Hsu, Lane, Lee, Mateika, Nantwi, Reier, Sankari, Tsai, or Xu laboratories, or in the majority of Lepore, Fuller, and Goshgarian laboratory publications. Some Fuller and Goshgarian laboratory articles, however, do include enrofloxacin treatment after surgery.72,78 One Lepore lab publication induced their C2Hx injury in immunosuppressed rats and thus included cephazolin in their post-operative treatment regimen.81 In addition, the Alilain laboratory applies topical triple antibiotic ointment to subjects' minor skin wounds as they arise, according to veterinary staff instruction (personal communication).In their past experimentation, Drs. Sieck and Mantilla have pre-emptively treated their post-SCI animals with penicillin G, the Descherchi laboratory has used amoxicillin, the Luk\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1 group used amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, the Mitchell group has often used enrofloxacin, and the Novikov laboratory has used benzylpenicillin for infection prophylaxis.52\u201356,58\u201360,79,86,91,120,125,130,131 The Feron and Kastner laboratories post-operatively treat animals with oxytetracycline and the Bonay, Mansart, and Vinit groups used trimethoprim and sulfadoxine.64,84,86,98,111\u2013113,116\u2013118The Cox laboratory treated animals with gentamicin, although because their study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of MP treatment, their prophylactic antibiotic treatment might have been motivated more to combat the risks of MP-induced immunosuppression than as part of standard post-SCI aftercare.105 Although the specific agent(s) were not mentioned, the Fern\u00e1ndez-Mu\u00f1oz laboratory described that they implemented responsive antibiotic therapy if their post-surgery rats showed signs of infection.104Dermatological careDuring cervical SCI surgery, ointment is applied to the anesthetized animals' eyes to prevent ocular damage.67,132 Other skincare provided to experimental animals across all literature surveyed was limited to preparation of the sites for aseptic or sterile procedure, closure of the surgical incision, nail trimming, monitoring and prevention of autophagy, and cleansing of the animals' surgical site, fur, eyes, and mouth as needed post-surgery.42,43,47,48,51,53,56\u201374,77\u201384,86\u201397,99\u2013104,106,107,109-113,116\u2013121,123,129,132\u2013135 Experimenters did not employ any treatment as prophylaxis for pressure sores.NutritionMurine subjects are usually provided access ad libitum to normal chow immediately after surgeries with accommodations for limited mobility such as food pellets placed on the cage floor. Animals' weight is monitored and diet supplemented with salient food choices at least until volitional feeding and normal defecation resumes.43,53,54,57,66,67,71\u201374,77\u201379,83,84,86,92\u201397,99\u2013102,104,106,108\u2013110,133 The Kastner laboratory includes parenteral glucose as standard post-operative treatment, and in one contusion publication the Mantilla and Sieck groups treated subjects with intravenous dextrose.79,84,116\u2013118Temperature regulationDuring spinal injury surgeries, murine subjects usually are placed on a heating pad to maintain body temperature54\u201356,67,68,71\u201373,77,78,85,97,106,111 After surgery, animals are often allowed to recover with access to heat for at least a short time.43,47,48,55,70,72,73,78,79,81\u201383,85\u201387,106,107,109,114,119,121,123Anesthesia for SCI surgeryAll murine subjects discussed in this review received an experimentally induced SCI and thus underwent anesthesia to facilitate the surgery. For many of their studies, laboratories led by Drs. Alilain, Chang, Cox, Fern\u00e1ndez-Mu\u00f1oz, Fuller, Gonzalez-Rothi, Goshgarian, Gonzalez-Rothi, Hsu, Lane, Lee, Lepore, Mantilla, Mateika, Nantwi, Novikov, Reier, Sieck, Tsai, and Xu utilized an injectable cocktail of xylazine and ketamine for anesthesia and the Alilain, Chang, Gonzalez-Rothi, Hsu, Lane, Lee, Lepore, Reier, Tsai, and Xu laboratories further often apply a reversal agent for xylazine (yohimbine or atipamezole) after procedure completion42,43,47,48,51,66,69\u201372,76,78\u201383,90\u201396,100\u2013102,104,105,108\u2013110,119\u2013128,133,136\u2013139The Lepore laboratory sometimes adds a dopamine antagonist (acepromazine) to their xylazine/ketamine cocktail for its properties as a muscle relaxant and sedative.80,81,138 The Roman laboratory utilized pentobarbital and the Kastner group utilized either pentobarbital, medetomidine/ketamine, or xylazine/ketamine injections for induction and maintenance of anesthesia and administered acetaminophen with codeine and/or morphine before surgery for sedative and analgesic effect.84,116\u2013118,140In some studies, the Goshgarian, Kastner, and Nantwi laboratories also pre-operatively used atropine sulfate to decrease airway secretions and promote adequate hemostasis.84,108,109,136 In some studies, the Fuller group induced and maintained anesthesia exclusively with inhalable isoflurane instead of injectables, and the Askew, Baekey, Bolser, Bonay, Dale, Decherchi, Fehlings, Mansart, Mitchell, Reier, Sankari, and Vinit laboratories followed a similar protocol for many of their SCI surgeries.53\u201355,58,59,61\u201365,67,68,73\u201375,77,85,86,88,89,97,99,103,106,111\u2013113,129 In their one publication studying the C2/3 hemisection, the Luk\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1 laboratory anesthetized rats solely with halothane.60In some experiments, the Bolser, Mitchell, and Vinit laboratories injected animals with medetomidine or dexmedetomidine before isoflurane induction and used atipamezole to reverse the medetomidine once the C2Hx surgery was complete.52,58,59,61\u201364 In some of their work, the Decherchi, Feron, and Gauthier groups utilized injectable chloral hydrate as the sole anesthetic, and in one publication, the Feron and Gauthier laboratories added atropine to their regimen.87,98,114,134 The Ishii laboratory anesthetized their rats with both midazolam and fentanyl injections before C2Hx.135 For mouse studies, the Alilain and Lane laboratories induced and maintained anesthesia on isoflurane alone.107,132Urinary and bowel careWhile no consistently severe or long-lasting bladder or bowel impairment commonly results from models of incomplete cervical SCI in rats and mice, some research groups such as the Alilain, Cox, Decherchi, Goshgarian, Lee, Mitchell, and Sankari laboratories have included urinary and bowel monitoring and/or care as part of their post-surgical animal care.47,48,72,73,86,87,95,97,105,109 The Alilain, Decherchi, Lee, Mitchell, and Sankari laboratories performed checks daily and manually expressed bladders when needed until subjects became capable of spontaneous voiding (usually within a week).47,48,73,86,87,95,97,105 In the Goshgarian laboratory, urinary and gastrointestinal aftercare included manual urinary voiding and bowel evacuation while rats were still anesthetized to prevent urinary retention or bowel impaction.72,109 In those studies, bladder and bowel function were evaluated in the days after surgery and returned to normal within 2 days or less.72,109Anticoagulation and stress ulcer prophylaxisNo published study of high cervical SCI includes any prophylactic or responsive anticoagulative intervention or stress ulcer treatment as part of standard aftercare for murine animals.SteroidsJust as MP therapy is excluded from the current standard of care for clinical SCI, it is excluded from veterinary aftercare protocols for experimentally induced cervical SCI in murine animals.",

    "PMC10698778": "MethodsAnimalsAll procedures were approved by the University of Kentucky's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All mice were group housed at 3\u20135 mice per cage under a normal light cycle. Female 3- to 4-month-old C57/BL6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) were used for all experiments.Spinal cord injuryFor the SCI surgery, anesthesia was induced using 5% isoflurane and mice were maintained at 2\u20133% during the procedure. Mice received a surgical laminectomy followed by a 75 kdyn vertebral level T9 contusion SCI (Infinite Horizons Impactor; IH) as previously described.13,14 Based upon a priori exclusion criteria, any mouse receiving an SCI with abnormalities in the force versus time curve generated by the IH device was excluded from analysis. Abnormalities meriting exclusion include bone hits or instability in the spinal cord at the time of injury and occurred in four mice (two from each group). After exclusion criteria were applied, force and displacement were similar between groups (force: vehicle = 76.42 \u00b1 1.83 kdyn, ethanol = 77.17 \u00b1 2.59 kdyn, p = 0.421; displacement: vehicle = 724.3 \u00b1 119.7 \u03bcm, ethanol = 655.0 \u00b1 99.0 \u03bcm, p = 0.137). After injury, muscle and skin incisions were closed using monofilament suture. Mice that opened their incision more than once were excluded from the study. One mouse was excluded from the vehicle group for this reason. Mice received an analgesic (Buprenex SR, 1.0 mg/kg) and antibiotic (1646RX, Enrofloxacin, 5.0 mg/kg, Enroflox), as well as saline (1.0 mL/day for 5 days) following surgery. Mice in the ethanol metabolism experiment did not receive analgesic or antibiotic until after the blood was collected to prevent hemodilution. Bladders from all SCI mice were manually expressed twice per day during the study.Ethanol administration and plasma ethanol concentration measurementsTo achieve a rapid and reproducible plasma ethanol concentration (PEC) of approximately 250\u2013300 mg/dL, ethanol was delivered via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection 40\u201350 min prior to SCI; i.p. administration was chosen over oral administration because compared with oral gavage i.p. injections of ethanol are more reproducible, safer for the animal, and cause a higher PEC.15,16 A 250\u2013300 mg/dL PEC range was ideal because it has been used previously in rodent models of SCI and it effectively models a binge-drinking episode in rodents.7,12 It is important to note that PEC is 1.09 to 1.18 times higher than BAC because serum and plasma samples contain more water than whole blood and alcohol is distributed uniformly throughout body water.17To determine the effect of SCI and isoflurane anesthesia on ethanol metabolism, 14-week-old female mice (ethanol [etoh] group n = 8, isoflurane [iso] + etoh group n = 11, SCI+iso+etoh group n = 12) were given an i.p. injection of 20% (v/v) ethanol in saline at a dose of 3 g/kg. The same dosing paradigm was used to assess functional recovery and tissue pathology. In the cohort of mice used to measure ethanol metabolism each mouse in the iso+etoh group was paired with a mouse from the SCI+iso+etoh group. Both mice were anesthetized for the same length of time and received the isoflurane dose via a dual output nose-cone system. Blood was taken approximately every hour after dosing and only one sample was taken from each mouse. Blood was collected from the facial vein into heparin-coated capillary tubes (16.440.100, Sarstedt) and transferred into 1.5 mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-coated tubes. Plasma was separated from whole blood via centrifugation for 10 min at 1500g at room temperature. Plasma was isolated and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until plasma ethanol concentration was measured using the Analox AM1 Analyser (Analox Instruments). The Analox AM1 Analyser uses an alcohol oxidase enzyme-based detection assay to quantify ethanol concentration in a sample. The alcohol oxidase enzyme catalyzes the reaction of ethanol and oxygen into acetaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. The instrument measures the rate of oxygen consumption, which is directly proportional to sample ethanol concentration. All samples were run in triplicate and an average of the three values were used as the PEC.Behavioral analysisLocomotor assessments were made using the CatWalk XT Gait Analysis System (Noldus) and the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS).18 For CatWalk analysis, mice underwent three testing sessions: 1 week prior to injury and 4 and 6 weeks post-injury (wpi). The CatWalk features a red overhead light and green illuminated walkway that reflects light in response to the contact of the mouse's paw that is then captured via calibrated video recordings. Gait analysis was performed by the same researcher in a dark room. Animals were acclimated in the room for 30 min prior to testing. For a single run, the mouse was first placed in the open end of the CatWalk under the red ceiling light and allowed to walk across the walkway to the darkened escape enclosure. Each mouse completed three continuous runs on each analysis day and a minimum of three valid runs, or complete walkway crossings, were obtained for each subject. Trials in which the mouse stopped or turned around during a run were excluded from analysis. Mice that did not complete three continuous runs after 25 attempts were excluded from analysis.The BMS utilizes a 9-point rating scale to characterize gross locomotor functions ranging from complete paralysis (score 0) to normal functions (score 9) as mice explore an open field for 4 min.18 BMS scores were obtained at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days post-injury (dpi) by two experimental raters who were blinded to treatment groups. In the week prior to injury animals were acclimated to the sandbox used for BMS scoring once for 5 min. Each hindlimb was scored separately based on movement (e.g., ankle placement and stepping), coordination, and trunk stability. Averaging both hindlimb scores generated a single score for each mouse. BMS sub-scores were derived from observations made during BMS scoring. BMS sub-scores are based on features of locomotion such as trunk stability, coordination, and paw placement that are observable in higher-functioning mice.18 BMS sub-scores permitted a better resolution to differentiate between mice with higher BMS scores.Hargreaves thermal sensitivity assessmentThe Hargreaves test of thermal hypersensitivity was used as previously described19 and modified for mice20,21 (37370, Ugo Basile, Germany). Mice were acclimated to testing boxes (37370, Ugo Basile, Germany) for 2 h/day for 2 days prior to testing and acclimated for 1 h prior to data acquisition. Testing was performed pre-SCI and at 42 dpi. For each test, an infrared laser was aimed at the plantar surface of each hindpaw. The laser is calibrated to reach a maximum temperature of 55\u00b0C over a 25-sec period. The time at which the animal responded to the thermal stimulus was recorded. Responses were only counted if they were a deliberate flinch, indicated by an abrupt lifting and replacement of the paw, sometimes followed by licking of the paw. Responses in which mice moved without an explicit reaction to the heat were not considered valid. Each mouse's paws were given at least 1 min of rest in between trials. Many mice were tested simultaneously, which enabled the experimental tester to switch between mice regularly. Three response times were obtained per hindfoot and the six recorded times for both feet were averaged to generate one score per mouse per time-point.ImmunohistochemistryAt 42 dpi mice were anesthetized using an overdose of ketamine (4.0\u20135.0 mg) and xylazine (0.4\u20130.5 mg) and euthanized via transcardial perfusion using phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% formaldehyde (Millipore Sigma). Spinal cords were extracted and post-fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 2 h at room temperature before being transferred to 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) overnight. Spinal cords were dehydrated in 30% sucrose for a week and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (4583, Sakura Finetek USA, Inc.). Five spinal cords were embedded in each OCT block with 2\u20133 cords per group randomly selected. Serial 10 \u03bcm coronal sections were collected on ColorFrost Plus Microscope Slides (22-037-246, Fisher Scientific). Ten sets of tissue were generated that spanned the length of the lesion and the distance between each section on a single slide was 100 \u03bcm.All slide-mounted sections received antigen retrieval at 80\u00b0C in sodium citrate buffer with 0.1% Tween-20 (pH 6.0) for 5 min. Sections were then treated with 0.3% H2O2 in 40% methanol and PBS for 30 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. Next, sections were blocked in 5% normal goat serum in PBS/0.1% Triton-X 100 for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then stained overnight at room temperature with neurofilament-200 kD (1:1500; Ck x NF200; NFH, Aves Labs). Sections were washed twice in PBS followed by 1-h long incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:500; Goat anti-chicken, BA9010, Vector Laboratories). Sections were then incubated in avidin biotin complex solution (ABC; 1:200; PK-6100, Vector Laboratories) and developed using 3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine (DAB; SK-4100, Vector Laboratories). Sections were counter-stained with eriochrome cyanine to visualize spared white matter. Stained slides were dehydrated using graded ethanol dilutions, cleared using Histoclear (101412-878, VWR Scientific), and coverslipped using Permount (SP15-500, Fisher Scientific). Slides were imaged using Axioscan (model Z1, Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, GE) at 20 \u00d7 magnification and visualized and quantified using Halo software (Indica Labs, Albuquerque, NM, USA).Tissue sparing was assessed by tracing intact white and gray matter at 100 \u03bcm intervals throughout a 1.4 mm span of the lesion centered on the lesion epicenter. The lesion epicenter was quantitatively defined as the section containing the least amount of spared tissue. All analyzed sections were oriented with respect to the lesion epicenter. Lesion length was defined as the total span of the spinal cord in which at least 5% of the cord area was negative for both myelin and axons (i.e., 5% damaged).Exclusion criteria summarySixteen mice were originally included in each group. Of the 16 original mice in the vehicle group: 4 mice were excluded because of abnormalities in the force \u00d7 displacement curve during injury and 1 mouse was excluded for reopening its sutures multiple times; n = 11 from the vehicle group for behavioral evaluation. Of the 16 mice in the ethanol group, 2 were excluded for abnormalities in the force \u00d7 displacement, 1 did not survive the surgery, and 2 were euthanized for extremely poor recovery after SCI at 1 dpi; n = 10 from the ethanol group for behavioral evaluation. During analyses of tissue pathology, one block of 5 mice was excluded due to excessive tissue loss due to spinal cord sections falling off the slides. This block included 2 previously excluded subjects and 2 additional mice from the vehicle group and 1 from the ethanol group. Final numbers for anatomical analyses: n = 9 for vehicle and n = 9 for ethanol group.Statistical analysisAll statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism software (v9.4.1, Boston, MA, USA). Simple linear regression was used to quantify ethanol metabolism rate. Metabolism rates were compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). AUC comparisons were made using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Holm-Sidak post hoc tests. BMS scores, sub-scores, and regularity index scores between treatment groups and over time were compared using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA also with Holm-Sidak post hoc tests. Paw withdrawal latency, stride length, print area, and regularity index comparisons were made with a two-way ANOVA. The lesion area at the epicenter and lesion length were compared using a Student's t-test. The lesion area over the length of the lesion was compared using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Fischer's post hoc tests. P \u2264 0.05 was considered significant.",
    "PMC11001960": "MethodsAll procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Virginia (UVA) and the study protocol was approved by the Naval Medical Research Center Institutional Review Board in compliance with all applicable federal regulations governing the protection of human subjects. The investigators have adhered to the policies for protection of human subjects as prescribed in AR 70-25.Informed consent was provided by all participants and procedures were performed during a 1-day evaluation at UVA. A total of 21 SMs were recruited into experimental and control groups for the study. SMs were screened for inclusion in the study by a SOCOM nurse practitioner located at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida. SMs within the experimental group must have had a prior history of blast exposure in training or operations. Subjects in the control group must not have had a history of previous exposure to explosives, including but not limited to explosive entry (breacher) operations/training, heavy weapons use, and/or explosives ordinance disposal (EOD). A history of moderate or severe TBI as defined by the American Congress of Rehabilitation, MRI contraindications, current severe medical condition, current diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) disorder other than mild TBI, and any cardiac, respiratory, or other medical condition that may affect cerebral metabolism were all criteria for exclusion from the study.Demographics, clinical history, and neuropsychological assessmentParticipant history was acquired, including demographics, military history, and medical history, along with a head injury questionnaire. The head injury questionnaire included eliciting a history of cause of injury, age of injury, loss of consciousness, presence of amnesia related to the event, changes in mood, sleep problems, or other associated clinical symptoms. Additionally, subjects were administered the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) Blast Exposure Threshold Survey (BETS).22 The BETS elicits information on exposure to weapons and explosives, injury history, auditory symptoms, vestibular symptoms, mood issues, sleep issues, and cognitive symptoms. Neuropsychological testing and administered inventories included the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics 4 TBI-MIL (ANAM4 TBI-MIL), Combat Exposure Scale (CES), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWI), and Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI).Generalized blast exposure value (GBEV)The BETS with the accompanying GBEV was recently developed specifically for military SMs to relate the type and amount of blast exposure to reported symptomology.22 This value is analogous to the Cumulative Head Impact Index (CHII) for former high school and college football players.23 The motivation for such measures is to simultaneously characterize a specific population and identify brain trauma exposure, relate that exposure to outcomes, and determine a threshold for increased risk of long-term problematic health outcomes. Analogously, the GBEV is determined by the following formula: GBEV=0.9761BEC+2882BEC+413BEC+774BEC4freq+755BEC5freq where BEC is the \u201cblast exposure count\u201d defined as the product of 1) years of experience with a weapon, 2) months of experience per year, 3) days of experience per month, and 4) number of exposures per day. Categorization of Light arms, Artillery, Recoilless rifles, and Explosives (CLARE) are denoted for each term in parentheses: (1BEC) small arms; (2BEC) large arms (including shoulder-fired); (3BEC) artillery (or large weapons carried by a vehicle); (4BEC) small explosives; and (5BEC) large explosives. freq refers to the daily frequency variable for each category.Serum biomarkersAll samples were measured in a fully blinded manner. Blood samples were collected into tubes with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and centrifuged before being aliquoted and placed in the freezer at \u221280\u00b0C for long-term storage. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from thawed samples as previously published.24 Of thawed samples, 500 \u03bcL were defibrinated with thromboplastin D and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before centrifuging for 5 min at 10,000g at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was transferred into fresh tubes with added ExoQuick exosome solution, mixed, and incubated for 60 min at 4\u00b0C before centrifuging. The resulting pellet containing all EVs was resuspended in 500 \u03bcL ultra-pure water and placed at \u221280\u00b0C for long-term storage. EVs were precipitated by using ExoQuick plasma prep and exosome precipitation kits (System Bioscience, Inc.). Five microliters of thrombin (5000 U/mL in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) were added to 500 \u03bcL plasma to a final concentration of 5 U/mL thrombin. Tubes were incubated at room temperature (25\u00b0C) for 5 min while gently mixing prior to centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was transferred to a new tube with ExoQuick to precipitate EVs for 30\u201360 min at 4\u00b0C. Then, vials were centrifuged at 1500g for 30 min. The resulting EV pellet at the bottom of the tube was resuspended in 500 \u03bcL of PBS.BDEVs were enriched in aqueous solution by precipitating with neuronal-specific antibodies SNAP25, PSA-NCAM, and CD171 from total circulating EVs from the plasma. Exosomal and plasma levels of tau, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were analyzed using a high-sensitivity Simoa HD-X analyzer (Quanterix, Lexington, MA, USA) and a paramagnetic bead-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Coefficient of variation (intra- and inter-plate) values were below 15% for all analytes. Coreplex cytokines panel of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF\u03b1 were analyzed using an SP-X Imaging and Analysis System (Quanterix). Because the array volumes are approximately 2 billion times smaller than an ELISA, a rapid buildup of fluorescent product is generated if labeled protein is present, and it provides detection ability between 100 and 1000 times that of ELISA methods. With diffusion defeated, this high local concentration of product can be readily observed. Samples were distributed randomly across plates and all assays were run in duplicate.Radiotracer synthesis[18F]DPA-714 was synthesized in accordance with U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP)<823> guidelines by the University of Virginia Radiochemistry Core, as previously described.25 [18F]DPA-714 was synthesized in a 13.5 \u00b1 3.04% radiochemical yield (EOB) with a molar activity of 34.3 \u00b1 9.9 Ci/\u03bcmol (1258 \u00b1 366 GBq/\u03bcol; n = 3) in a total synthesis time of 90 min. In all cases, radiochemical purity was >99%.NeuroimagingPET-CTImaging was performed with a Siemens Biograph mCT (PET-CT) scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Knoxville, TN, USA). Measurements of body height and weight were performed before scan acquisition. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed with a 100 mAs tube current, 100 kV voltage, 64 \u00d7 0.6 mm collimation, pitch of 0.55, reconstruction at a 2-mm slice thickness, and scanning time of 17.3 sec. Subjects received an intravenous, bolus injection of [18F]DPA-714 (296 \u00b1 17 MBq) at the onset of a 90-min dynamic list mode PET acquisition. Genotyping was performed to determine TSPO polymorphism status for each subject. PET image reconstruction was performed at an image size of 400 with a 2.0 amplification factor and Gaussian filter with a full-width half maximum of 2.0. The TrueX + time of flight (TOF) method was used with five iterations and 21 subsets. Attenuation correction was performed using the NeuroAC calculated attenuation correction method.26 Using MiM version 6.9.7, (MiM Software, Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA), reconstructed and attenuation corrected images underwent motion correction, and static images binned at 20\u201390 min were generated using SumIP.MRIMRI neuroimaging was employed and the protocol included three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted imaging (isotropic 1.0-mm spatial resolution), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI; (isotropic 1.5-mm spatial resolution, multi-shell with b-values of 1500 and 3000 s/mm2; 98 directions), resting state blood oxygen dependent (BOLD) imaging (10-min resting state acquisition, isotropic 2-mm spatial resolution, and 800-msec temporal resolution), susceptibility weighted imaging (3D gradient echo), and 3D arterial spin labeling (ASL; gradient-and spin-echo [GRASE] acquisition module and pseudo-continuous blood tagging). In addition, calibration/correction data were acquired to characterize spatial distortions in echo-planar-based acquisitions (BOLD and diffusion) and static field inhomogeneity. All data were collected on a state-of-the-art 3 Tesla MR scanner (Prisma, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) using a 64-channel head radiofrequency coil. The total acquisition time was roughly 1.5 h.Data processingProcessing and quantification of the previously described imaging data employed multiple packages including MRtrix3 and the various libraries available within the ANTsX software ecosystem (Fig. 1). Derived imaging data used in this study included cortical thickness maps from T1-weighted MRI, diffusivity-based scalar images (e.g., fractional anisotropy) from diffusion-weighted MRI, functional scalar activation summarized via amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and network correlation maps. Summary perfusion and PET scalar images were also generated for each subject. ANTs tools27 were used to register each T1-weighted image to an average population template as used in previous studies.28 Subsequently, each subject-specific scalar image was aligned to the corresponding T1-weighted image, thus providing a set of transformations to warp each image to the common template space.27FIG. 1.Neuroimage processing diagram for this study. Following image acquisition, computational processing generates several derived images per subject, which are registered to the study template via each subject's T1-weighted MRI. These aligned images are organized per modality, which are reduced in terms of dimensionality to representative bases using the SiMLR framework. CT, computed tomography; FA, fractional anisotropy; fALFF, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; PET, positron emission tomography; SiMLR, Similarity-driven Multi-view Linear Reconstruction.Details concerning modality-specific processing are as follows.Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)The standard MRtrix3 pipeline29 was used for diffusion tensor reconstruction and subsequent generation of diffusivity maps, specifically those corresponding to fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD). Pre-processing steps included denoising,30 whole-brain extraction,31 and tensor reconstruction.32 The average diffusion-weighted MR image was normalized to the corresponding T1-weighted MR image. Motion and eddy current correction were incorporated into the pipeline using the dwifslpreproc MRtrix3 program, which interfaces with the underlying FMRIB Software Library commands eddy, topup, and applytopup.33,34Cortical thicknessANTsX employs a registration-based framework for estimating cortical thickness35 that has been tailored and evaluated for both cross-sectional and longitudinal36 MR data. More recently, a deep-learning-based framework has been developed and evaluated37 demonstrating both superior measurement quality and increased computational efficiency. Briefly, processing includes brain extraction, brain parcellation based on six tissue types (i.e., cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], gray matter, white matter, deep gray matter, brainstem, and cerebellum), and application of the diffeomorphic registration based cortical thickness (DiReCT) cortical thickness algorithm.35 This yields a scalar image with non-zero values in the cortical gray matter providing a voxelwise estimate of thickness (in millimeters).Resting-state fMRIResting-state functional MRI (fMRI) processing, performed in the R-based ANTs interface (ANTsR), has been described previously.8,38 Briefly, motion correction was applied to each time series. Nuisance parameters included the transformation parameters, the framewise displacement,39 and component-based method (CompCor) contributions.40 Summary images from the corrected time series included fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF).41,42Cerebral blood flow (CBF) from first-pass perfusion imagingSimilar to the other image time series, the mean spatial image was generated and used as the reference image for motion correction. CBF images were generated using a singular value decomposition technique43 with the arterial input function generated automatically.44 Visual inspection of the CBF images revealed non-biological artifacts that persisted after standard confound modeling and processing. Consequently, CBF was excluded from the statistical analysis.PETPET images were also motion-corrected using ANTsX tools. The toolbox for partial volume correction (PVC) in PET (PETPVC),45 which provides several published methods for performing PVC, was used for additional pre-processing. Finally, after inspecting several anatomical regions and the range of PET activity, values were normalized for each subject based on the corresponding PET values in the left and right caudate. These segmented regions were identified using the corresponding T1-weighted image and the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville labeling protocol available in ANTsXNet.37Statistical analysisThe multifaceted neurological effects stemming from blast exposure necessitate multiple observations/measurements to characterize the associated structural, functional, and metabolic sequelae. In this study, the battery of measurements included multi-modal neuroimaging, self-reported or clinical neuropsychological assessment, and blood biomarkers. Such measurements can be inherently noisy and incomplete while simultaneously mutually overlapping and complementary. A recently developed statistical framework, known as similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction (SiMLR),46 has been employed for exploring and analyzing such data. Successful application includes a recent investigation into a career breacher cohort characterized by repetive low-level blast exposure8 where the use of SiMLR permitted identification of significant group effects spanning multiple modalities, including those mentioned previously.Briefly, SiMLR is a multi-view extension of earlier techniques (i.e., single-view eigenanatomy47,48 and dual-view sparse canonical correlation analysis [SCCAN]).49,50 Each of these techniques is rooted in principal component analysis (PCA) with additional spatial constraints specifically tailored for neuroimaging data.46 Akin to PCA, these techniques are used for principled data dimensionality reduction\u2014an important consideration in the context of neuroimaging where a single image can contain several orders of magnitude of statistically dependent data. In this way, and in contrast to standard mass voxelwise univariate51 or region of interest (ROI)-based approaches,52,53 statistical power is conserved by clustering data prior to statistical testing and adjustment for multiple comparisons, analogous to principal components regression.54SiMLR's default setting identifies low-dimensional embeddings that optimize the joint predictive power between all modalities equally. We instead use a path modeling approach46,55 where SiMLR optimizes the predictive power from PET to the other modalities and from each MRI modality to PET. This strategy guarantees that the PET neuroinflammation modality drives the nature of the learned features across all modalities.Formally, through SiMLR optimization, the ith modality, Xi, is represented by a pair of matrices Ui,Viwhere the columns of Ui are the low-dimensional bases spanning Xi and the columns of Vi are the regularized, sparse representation of each modality component. As mentioned previously, this permits principal component regressions of the form: Ui,l\u223cd0+d1+\u2026+dn where the set of dj represents the explanatory variables (e.g., age, gender, and brain volume) and l denotes the specific basis vector of the ith solution.To explore the relationship between GBEV, control, or exposed status (denoted as armt below) and the imaging modalities, the following quasi-Poisson regression model was used:56\u201358 gGBEV\u223c\u03b2aAge+\u03b2cotherCon+\u03b2tarmt+\u03b2mlUmodality,l where each \u03b2 is a coefficient, g is the log link function,56 Age is subject age, and otherCon represents the number of reported concussions from non-blast-related events. Quasi-Poisson regression models are appropriate for count or frequency data such as GBEV that is often non-Gaussian/overdispersed.58 The modality is one of PET, CT cortical thickness from T1-weighted MRI, FA (fractional anisotropy from DTI), fALFF (resting state), or Jacobian (a measure of localized volumetric change relative to a study template).59Critical GBEV threshold analysisThe above equation allows modeling the non-linear relationship between imaging variables and GBEV while controlling for baseline exposure level (armt), age, and concussions. The discrete control/exposed variable armt defines a split of the cohort based on a GBEV threshold t where t varies between 9875.6 and 177,424 at discrete points determined by the values of our cohort. The threshold 65,309 corresponds to the original operator (n = 9) versus non-operator (n = 9) grouping. The regression parameter \u03b2ml on the term Umodality,l is our key outcome of interest for statistical testing; it represents the degree to which the relationship between the modality's lth feature embedding and the total GBEV score accelerates in exposed subjects. In particular, we test for significant relationships between imaging variables (primary outcomes from PET with secondary outcomes from MRI) and GBEV after controlling for the other covariates. We assess significance of the \u03b2ml coefficients via permutation testing where the GBEV score is permuted 50,000 times per model. This empirical approach to p-value calculation is generally more conservative than model-based methods and leads to a minimum p-value of 2e-05.Analysis of biomarker and cognitive measurementsWe adopt the same quasi-Poisson model as described above but instead use BDEVs or cognitive measures as predictors instead of SiMLR imaging components. In addition, we analyze these relationships only at a single threshold of \u226565,309, which is consistent with the original control versus exposed grouping.",
    "PMC11071085": "MethodsOverall study designThe CARE4Kids research program uses a two-cohort longitudinal methodology. The DC will undergo testing using the Developmental Test Battery (DTB) of multi-modal biomarkers developed in the three Research Cores. The DC sample will be recruited from multiple sources including emergency departments, urgent care centers, primary care clinics, and specialty clinics. These DC markers were chosen based on differential time course, potential for treatable targets, and longitudinal correlation with PPCS outcome. These biomarkers include autonomic nervous system measurements, MRI neuroimaging, and biofluid tests. The most predictive and scalable DC measures will be incorporated into the Validation Test Battery (VTB) and collected in the second phase, the Validation Cohort (VC). The VC will be recruited from the same Care4Kids consortium sites but expanded to include additional primary care clinics/networks and emergency departments (acutely/subacutely at T1) and followed to 3 months post-initial assessment. In this more generalizable VC, the endophenotype clinical and biomarker measures will be validated as prognostic tools in a risk stratification algorithm, which will set the stage for future studies of treatment for PPCS.We will also enroll a cohort of 100 typically developing, non-concussed youth ages 11.00-17.99 years who will be used to develop normative data of autonomic function for comparing typically developing youth and youth with concussion.Study population, eligibility criteria, and recruitmentThe study subjects are enrolled at each of the six sites across the Care4Kids consortium (University of California at Los Angeles, University of Washington/Seattle Children's, Children's National Research Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, University of Rochester, and Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Hospital). They are being recruited from concussion subspecialty clinics, primary care clinics, emergency departments, athletic trainers who work for the institutions of the investigators, and athletic teams through presentations to teams and parents. Study participants are adolescents of any gender with the following inclusion criteria: 1.Ages 11 to 17.99 years, and2.Diagnosed with a concussion by a health care provider using Concussion in Sport Group criteria,5 and3.English speaking (parents can be English or Spanish speakers), and4.Able to be scheduled for the first research visit (T1) < 35 days post-injury, and5.Continuing to experience post-concussion symptoms at T1, defined as experiencing at least one symptom \u201cmore than usual\u201d relative to pre-injury status.Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria are further screened for any of the following exclusion criteria:1.Diagnosis of severe autism or other significant developmental delay limiting active participation in the protocol, or2.Significant neurological disorder (any neurodegenerative disorder, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, epilepsy) but migraine not excluded, or3.Severe psychiatric illness or substance abuse (actively suicidal, psychosis), or4.History of moderate or severe TBI (other than concussion), or5.Concussion within the last 3 months if asymptomatic at time of evaluation, or any prior concussion if still symptomatic, or6.Inability to read or sign assent/consent.In addition to screening at the sites mentioned above, study information is also distributed at local athletic leagues, schools, and community outreach events to raise awareness of the study. After screening subjects, informed consent and assent is obtained either in person or through electronic consent. Approximately 370 subjects will be enrolled during the DC and approximately 350 subjects will be enrolled during the VC; this is further explained below in the section on \u201cExpected power.\u201dScreened and eligible patients are enrolled by research staff using institutional review board\u2013approved parent consent and teen assent forms. Enrolled participants then proceed with the longitudinal research design as outlined in the Participant Flow Diagram (Fig. 1); each of the T1 and T3 assessments takes approximately 5 h to complete. Individuals with metal braces are eligible but will automatically be assigned to the non-imaging group. Financial incentives are offered to both the child and the parent for each visit at T1 and T3; youth completing 6 of 7 days on MyCap (an application that allows outcome data capture via mobile device) are entered into a weekly lottery for an additional $50 incentive.FIG. 1.Patient flow diagram for the Discovery Cohort. T0, Date of injury; C, Screen, consent; R, imaging opt out/in; i, neuroimaging conducted; T1, Study visit, labs drawn; T2, Remote engagement with app; T3, Study visit, labs drawn; T4, Remote engagement with app.We will also recruit a control group of typically developing youth ages 11.00-17.99 years who are English speaking but who do not have a history of concussion. The same exclusion criteria for the concussed youth will also apply to them. These individuals will only be studied once and receive the same baseline assessments as the concussed group, but will not receive any MRI examination or blood tests.Baseline assessmentsThe baseline assessment (T1) is administered between 7 and 35 days post-injury. Participants undergo the complete test battery, including participant and parent questionnaires, autonomic protocol, headache phenotyping examination, neurocognitive assessment, and blood sample. We also document through parent questionnaire whether other injuries occurred at the time of the event resulting in concussion. Participants undergo MRI neuroimaging at the baseline time-point in addition to the other tests above. A summary of the visit schedule is shown in Figure 2 and the flow through the procedures of the visit is shown as Figure 3.FIG. 2.Study visit schedule for the Discovery Cohort.FIG. 3.CARE4Kids study visit timeline. Target timeline for a CARE4Kids study visit including a 15-min break.Neuropsychological and headache protocolPersistent cognitive problems following mild TBI (mTBI) in adolescents likely reflect central nervous system (CNS) and autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction, and may be influenced by psychosocial factors, and individual variations in pre-injury function. We therefore collect a rich set of information on premorbid psychosocial function, injury characteristics, and CNS and ANS markers to identify risk factors for adverse cognitive outcomes that can be used to guide timely and effective interventions. The neuropsychological protocol for the study encompasses standardized neurocognitive testing, standardized questionnaires, and a demographic/clinical history questionnaire devised for this protocol.Cognitive measuresThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Cognition measures assess the participant's neurocognitive functioning (Table 1A). Fluid, crystallized and overall cognitive abilities will be assessed, including attention/executive functioning, working memory, episodic memory, language, and processing speed. The specific subtests administered include the age-appropriate versions of the Picture Vocabulary Test, List Sorting Working Memory Test, Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test, Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test, and Auditory Verbal Learning Test. The total time allocated for the Toolbox is approximately 20 min. The NIH Toolbox cognitive measures have shown robust reliability and validity compared to gold standard cognitive measures in children.14Table 1A.NIH Toolbox Subtests AdministeredTest NameTypeDomainTime (min)DescriptionNotesPicture VocabularyCrystallizedLanguage4Identify one of four photos that matches the word heard presentediPadFlanker TaskFluidAttentional Control/Executive3Identify the orientation of a fish or an arrow in the middle of the screen and while inhibiting (ignoring) the orientation of the stimuli around itiPad Home BaseList SortingFluidWorking Memory7Recall a list of animals, foods, or foods and animals from smallest to largestKeyboard and Answer Sheet for RA inputPattern ComparisonFluidProcessing Speed3Compare 2 pictures and decide if they are the same or different as quickly as possibleiPadRey Auditory Verbal LearningFluidVerbal Memory3Recall a list of words presented over three trialsRA records responses on iPadNIH, National Institutes of Health; RA, research assistant.In coordination with the NIH Toolbox, the Children's Exertional Effects Rating Scale (ChEERS), a 7-item dimensional rating scale of key post-concussion symptoms, will be administered immediately before and after the cognitive tests (NIH Toolbox) to measure changes in symptoms attributable to cognitive exertion.15 Exertional effects have been shown to be predictive of outcome above and beyond cognitive performance and Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI) symptom ratings.16Symptoms Reports (Table 1B). The primary post-concussion tracking tool in the study is the PCSI,17,18 which was designed for patients in our age group. Both self and parent reports are collected at each study time-point (in person and remote visits). At T1, both participant and parents are asked to rate the participant's pre-injury symptoms to allow us to obtain a baseline of symptom load unrelated to injury. In addition, the Post-Concussion Executive Inventory (PCEI), validated for concussion, is administered to both participants and parents to identify real-world deficits in executive functioning. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)19 modified for concussive symptoms is administered to measure how catastrophizing about concussive symptoms might negatively impact experiences of those symptoms and potentially impact recovery. This measure has been used to identify negative cognitions that predict poor outcome following concussions.20 We will also assess the child's exposure to adverse childhood events (ACEs), using the adolescent self-report Pediatric ACEs and Related Life-events Screener (PEARLS). Additional measures of personal, psychological, and family factors to measure the biopsychosocial tapestry of concussion risk are administered (see Tables 1A and 1B for full list of measures). The participant questionnaires take approximately 35-45 min to administer. The parent questionnaires take approximately 30 min to complete.Table 1B.Neuropsychological Battery Administered MeasureSelf (min)Parent (min)# itemsTypePost-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI)44 SetPost-Concussion Executive Inventory (PCEI)44 SetShort STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), State1\u20136SetK-CAT (psychiatric symptoms)75 CATPain Catastrophizing Scale (modified)2213SetCLASS-3 (school probs and stress response)44 SetPROMIS - Sleep224 or 10CATDemographic/Clinical History45variableSetPubertal Development Scale (PDS)2\u2013 SetHIT 6 (migraine severity and PEDS MIDAS (migraine related quality of life)2\u2013 SetMulti-dimensional Assessment of Parenting Style (MAPS)\u2013534SetParenting Style Inventory-II (PSI-II)4\u201315SetConnor-Davidson Resilience Scale4\u201325SetPACE Self-Efficacy4\u201317SetFamily Resources Scale (FRS)\u20135 SetAdverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) 2 SetMinutes (total)4438 MAPS measures family functioning (e.g., dimensions of warmth, supportiveness, hostility, etc.).CAT, computer adapted test.HeadacheThis portion of the study is targeted towards better defining endophenotypes leading to post-traumatic headache (PTH). Classification based on current International Classification of Headache Disorders-3 criteria (which only broadly classifies post-traumatic headache)21 may not reflect complexities of PTH pathophysiology in the setting of concussion. A better understanding of PTH and associated neurological dysfunction may require a finer granularity of phenotypic characterization\u2014distinct from what has been developed for primary headache disorders. Determination of PTH phenotype may have practical importance not only in terms of predicting persisting symptoms, but also as an indicator of potential benefit of phenotype-specific therapies.We postulate that migraine-like post-traumatic headache may be a unique post-concussion endophenotype with a distinct recovery timeline and markers that could be inferred from physical, imaging, autonomic or blood biomarkers. There are numerous components that will test this hypothesis. Extensive headache questionnaires are obtained at the T1 and T3 visits (Table 2). Headache questions were designed to integrate with the Headache and Concussion NINDS Common Data Elements (CDEs). We also chose to use the MyCap platform22 to longitudinally monitor headache and associated features, medication use, and a basic indicator of sleep quantity to more fully characterize headache burden and characteristics from recruitment and the first study visit (T1) until the recovery visit (T3). We are also utilizing validated migraine disability assessment tools at the T1 and T3 research visits, the Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment (PedsMIDAS),23,24 and Headache Impact Test 6 (HIT 6).25Table 2.Symptoms and Examination Checklist for Headache AssessmentT1 symptoms:Presence of headacheYes/noHeadache temporal featuresOnset of headache after injury (days), frequency (or continuous)Headache Severity1-10 pain scaleHeadache QualityPulsating/constant/stabbingHeadache LocationUnilateral/bilateral, frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, vertex, globalAssociated symptomsLight/sound sensitivity, Nausea/anorexiaMigraine aura symptomsVision, sensory, language, motor symptomsCranial autonomic symptomsEye redness/tearing, nasal dischargeOther associated symptomsCognitive dysfunction, fatigueNeck painWith or without headacheDizziness, vertigo, and/or lightheadednessWith or without headacheVisionBlurred vision, double vision, difficulty focusing, difficulty readingExacerbating/relievingMovement/activity, upright vs. supine posture, menstrual period if applicablePrior headache historyPrevious history of migraine diagnosis/ severe headache of any kindFamily historyFamily history of migraine diagnosis/severe headache of any kindMedication useAnalgesics, oral contraceptives, stimulants, antidepressantsCaffeine use Cannabis use Examination Vital signs Screening neurological examEvaluation of eye movements Test of convergence functionNormal/abnormal Occipital nerve tendernessYes/no Anterior radiation of pain with occipital nerve pressureYes/no Ipsilateral/contralateral neck pain on flexion, extension, rotation w/extension (facet load)Yes/noHeadache Impact/Disability Metric: Headache Impact Test \u2013 6 (HIT-6)Between T1 and T3 - Daily Phone Diary:Presence/absence of headacheYes/noDuration of headacheHours or continuousHeadache severity1-10 scaleLocation of headache NauseaYes/noLight or sound sensitivityYes/noDizziness or lightheadednessYes/noBlurred or double visionYes/noFlashing lights or wavy lines in visionYes/noMedication intakeSpecifySleepHoursT3 (second in-person visit)Clinical features: Same as T1 without historical featuresExamination: same as T1Associated with these headache features, we are characterizing blood-flow pathophysiology through advanced neuroimaging (arterial spin labeling; ASL) and white matter microstructure with diffusion tensor imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). The prospective measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) using ASL in this project has the potential to provide highly meaningful information regarding changes in blood flow as a mechanism of PTH and as an indicator of PPCS outcomes. Fluid biomarker data will also supplement this analysis, we are investigating pathophysiologic associations with pain neuropeptides such as calcitonin gene-related peptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, and Substance P.To assess for physical examination markers that correlate with outcomes, research coordinators have been trained in a standardized head and neck examination, tailored for headache disorders, to assess for cervical and neurologic components of persistent posttraumatic headache (Table 2).Autonomic biomarker protocolThere is growing interest in the role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in concussion because of major overlap in symptoms of concussion and dysautonomia. Many patients with concussion present with classic dysautonomic signs such as postural orthostatic tachycardia, headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and anxiety.26\u201329 Conversely, many patients with autonomic disorders without brain injuries have similar symptoms as patients with concussion, including dizziness, vertigo, nausea, mood swings, anxiety, fatigue and intolerance to exercise, concentration and memory problems, and photophobia and phonophobia.5 Brain regions that may be particularly vulnerable to head impact forces, such as limbic cortex, hypothalamus, and midbrain nuclei, are all key structures in the central autonomic network. In a recent review, 33 of 36 studies identified ANS anomalies in concussed athletes not found in non-athletes.26 Given the dearth of treatments for persistent concussion symptoms, autonomic dysregulation may be a promising target for new mechanistically grounded treatments.Given the limitations in prior research, we designed a protocol to measure psychophysiological responses (heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory dynamics) under conditions shown in prior research to activate sympathetic and/or parasympathetic activity. In addition, we include a non-cardiovascular measure of autonomic function-the pupillary light response. A potentially important innovation is the use of an inexpensive wearable device (Scosche Armband)30 to collect heart rate data in parallel with one of the most widely used electrocardiography systems to assess cardiac function in autonomic function research\u2014the Biopac system. If the data from the Schosche Armband provide heart rate data comparable to the Biopac system we will consider using it in the validation phase.The autonomic assessment protocol continuously measures psychophysiological responses during several conditions designed to stimulate sympathetic and/or parasympathetic activity. The conditions (Fig. 4) include heart-rate deep breathing, pupillary light response, cognitive/emotional challenge (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test), hand-grip test, and an active standing test. Each of the stressors is followed by a post-activation recovery period to measure the stress-response and recovery. The protocol is complicated, requiring presentation of instructions to participants about how to respond to a variety of tasks and different stimuli. To standardize the administration of instructions, presentation of stimuli, and acquisition of psychophysiological data across six data collection sites, stimulus presentation software (E-Prime) is used to deliver the instructions to participants, as well as the visual and auditory stimuli for all conditions, task timing and recording response. This approach reduces the burden on research staff allowing them to focus on ensuring proper signal acquisition. E-Prime directly interfaces with continuous data acquisition software (Biopac AcqKnowledge) and automatically time-locks task events. The Scosche Band collects data concurrently, but on a separate application.FIG. 4.Autonomic protocol.Human factors were strongly considered given the challenge of training research staff at six sites, anticipated staff turnover, and the need for ongoing quality control. To support research staff in navigating the detailed training and competency required for this project, all training information is housed on an interactive, online smart board, Miro.31 This website allows centralized hosting of training manuals, videos demonstrations, informational documents, updates to the protocol, and monitoring systems easily accessible through a visual format, which we believe facilitates training and protocol fidelity across sites. Research assistants undergo extensive training in how to connect electrodes, blood pressure cuffs, etc., to participants to acquire biologically accurate signals, and protocol administration using E-Prime. Since research sites are distributed across the country, experiment fidelity and data quality are ensured by verifying signal accuracy of the psychophysiological data and then by multiple live observation of study protocols conducted via zoom. This allows the research coordinators at UCLA to monitor both the participant and the data coming in.Imaging biomarker protocolMulti-modal MRI can reveal and measure a wide spectrum of brain alterations in mTBI, beyond gross anatomical changes (Table 3). Diffusion MRI (dMRI) can model white matter (WM) tracts, and is acutely sensitive to microstructural alterations that result from mTBI, including axonal damage, glial and inflammatory responses, and edema.32 Some studies using dMRI after sports related concussion show poorer WM organization after injury, correlated with plasma biomarkers of injury-related inflammatory processes.Table 3.Imaging Modalities ModalityScan parametersDerived MeasuresUsefulnessAnatomical MRI (T1w and T2w)Voxel size = 1 mm3, 176-225 slices (T1w), 176-256 slices (T2w), scan time = 9-14 min for bothRegional cortical thickness and surface area, subcortical volumes for 96 regionsMorphometry can be altered in children with concussion and TBI relative to neurotypical controlsdMRIVoxel size = 1.7mm3, diffusion weighting = 500 (6), 1000 (15), 2000 (15), 3000 (60), 81 slices, scan time = 7-9 minStandard (tensor) and advanced DKI and NODDI metrics of WM microstructure; diffusivity metrics for 14 major WM tractsExamines tracts that have previously shown atypicality in children with concussion and TBISWI/QSMVoxel size = 0.5-1.0 \u00d7 0.5-1.0 \u00d7 2.0-3.0 mm3, scan time = 6 minMagnetic susceptibility of biological tissue; regional T2* valuesReflects venous vasculature, hemosiderin microbleeds, and aspects of microstructure (e.g., iron, calcium, and myelin).rsfMRIVoxel size = 2.4 mm3, 60 slices, TR = 800 msec, TE = 30 msec, scan time = 20 min (4 \u00d7 5 min runs)Functional connectivity metrics using seeds from the 20-component analysis of the BrainMap activation database and rsfMRI datasetExamines functional activity and connectivityASLVoxel size = 1.8 \u00d7 1.8 \u00d7 4.0 mm3, 26 slices, scan time = 5 minRegional measures of cerebral blood flowMeasures perfusionMRI, magnetic resonance imaging; TBI, traumatic brain injury; dMRI, diffusion MRI; DKI, diffusion kurtosis imaging; NODDI, Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging; WM, white matter; SWI, susceptibility-weighted imaging; QSM, quantitative susceptibility mapping; rsfMRI, resting-state functional MRI; TR, repetition time; TE, echo time; ASL, arterial spin labeling.The timing of assessment is critical for dMRI, however, as swelling and bleeding can alter measures.33 With resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), researchers can quantify disruptions in coordinated functional activity across the brain. In acute mTBI, alterations in functional connectivity have been detected,34,35 and may be predictive of cognitive performance months later.34 Similar results have been shown in sports-related mTBI, with acute alterations that resolved later.36,37 Although rsfMRI studies can identify disruptions in acute mTBI, challenges in interpreting the blood oxygen\u2013level dependent signal mean that rsfMRI on its own cannot determine whether disruptions are due to disconnection (site or network specific), poor perfusion, disruption of cerebrovascular reactivity, or a hybrid of these.38 ASL maps changes in CBF at a fine scale across the brain, revealing direct vascular contributions of rsfMRI alterations. To date however, studies of ASL in mTBI have been inconclusive: some studies show lower CBF 24-48 h after injury39 while others show higher CBF (2 and 6 weeks post-injury),40 potentially with an interaction with sex.41 Lastly, QSM is modality whose application to TBI has accelerated in the last decade, aiming to noninvasively estimate the magnetic susceptibility of biological tissue.42 QSM noninvasively estimates the magnetic susceptibility of biological tissue, which can be altered by macro- or micro-hemorrhage. QSM images can also be used to derive quantitative measures of white matter hyperintensity burden and for qualitative grading of lacunar infarctions and evidence of closed head injury (e.g., cortical contusions). In the CARE4Kids project, we modeled our protocols on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) neuroimaging protocol which has been successfully used to scan over 10,000 adolescents,43 supplemented with specialized scans ideal for clinical assessment of concussion (ASL and QSM).Fluid biomarker protocolSeveral key physiologic processes likely related to the persistence of PPCS are detectable in peripheral blood. Concussion-related axonal injury, inflammatory activity, membrane turnover and oxidative stress result in altered neurotransmission leading to a disruption of neural networks.44 These physiologic processes can be assessed in peripheral blood by measuring neuronal/glial proteins, lipids, inflammatory cytokines, and neuropeptide neurotransmitters. A group of blood-based proteins reflecting these processes was selected based on evidence of diagnostic and/or prognostic capability and availability of commercial assays (Table 4). While most published blood biomarker studies involve adults, several involving EMAs underscore their potential in this age group.45-47Table 4.Proposed Fluid-Based Biomarkers to be Measured in EMAsTBI Physiologic processMarker TypeMarkerAxonal injuryNeuronal/glial InjuryGFAP, UCH-L1, total Tau, NF-LInflammatory activityCytokinesTNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, VEGFMembrane turnover and oxidative stressLipidsLPA, FA 2-OH C16:0, FA C18:0, TUDCA, PE ae C36:4, PE aa C38:6, LysoPC a C20:4Altered neurotransmissionNeuropeptidesCGRP, PACAP, Substance PEMA, early and middle adolescents; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; UCH-L1, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase isoenzyme L1; NF-L, neurofilament light chain; TNF-\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor alpha; IL, interleukin; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; FA 2-OH C16:0, 2-hydroxypalmitic acid; FA C18:0, stearic acid; TUDCA, tauroursodeoxycholic acid; PE ae C36:4, phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen; PE aa C38:6, diacyl-phosphatidylethanolamine; LysoPC a C20:4, lysophosphatidylcholine; CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; PACAP, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide.Quantification of fluid biomarkers (FBMs) at a single, acute post-injury time-point, as well as changes across two time-points, can aid in the early identification of EMAs most vulnerable to PPCS. Importantly, these biomarkers have different temporal dynamics,48 which suggests that a combination of these markers (or changes in marker values over time) might be the most effective in identifying EMAs at risk for poor recovery and chronic symptoms.Using markers in blood to assess physiologic vulnerability to PPCS in EMAs has several advantages. The processes of drawing, shipping, and storing blood are well known world-wide and the equipment required relatively inexpensive. In addition, blood-based protein assays are readily scalable. The blood drawing procedure is well known and accepted by the general public, although EMAs may be more likely to be adversely affected by the anticipatory anxiety and distress associated with venipuncture.49 To address this barrier, a needle-free, lancet-based device shown to improve the acceptability of phlebotomy in pediatric populations50,51 is also be tested as part of this protocol.Non-fasting blood samples will be collected at T1 and T3 by certified phlebotomists via venipuncture using specimen collection kits provided by the NINDS BioSEND Repository following established protocols. Serum and plasma will be collected from whole blood following BioSEND standard processing procedures. Within 30 min of collection, samples will be centrifuged at 2000 G for 15 min and stored locally at -80\u00b0C and then shipped overnight on dry ice to BioSEND Repository for long-term storage. Assays will be batched to minimize variability, with each batch run with appropriate standards and controls to ensure reliability.It is anticipated that integration of FBMs, along with imaging and autonomic biomarkers, into a clinically practical risk-stratification algorithm will be critical for accurate prediction of EMAs at high risk for PPCS.Remote assessment\u2014T2Following the T1 test battery, participants and parents will respond to questionnaires from home using their mobile devices. This study employs MyCap, a mobile application developed by Vanderbilt University, that integrates with the REDCap study database. A mobile device will be provided to those parents and/or participants who do not have one of their own. Over the approximately 2-month period between the T1 and T3 test batteries, participants and parents will receive the following questionnaires:Participants:1.Daily questionnaires querying headache phenotype and exercise2.Weekly questionnaires querying additional behaviors such as napping and stress3.Bi-weekly administration of the PCSIParents:1.Bi-weekly questionnaire about changes in medications, treatment, and other interventions2.Bi-weekly administration of the Parent-PCSIT2 questionnaire distribution begins starting the day after T1 and proceeds until the T3 timepoint (3 months post-injury).Three-month follow-up assessment\u2014T3Three months after injury, the participants complete the entire test battery administered during the baseline assessment, T1. Participants in the imaging arm will undergo neuroimaging again at this time-point. It is anticipated that some participants will not be willing or able to return for an in-person assessment at this time. For those participants, a remote T3 is available, which includes questionnaires but without biomarker assessments. All participants are encouraged to attend the T3 in person for full data acquisition.Recovery discovery assessment\u2014T4To collect complete recovery data, parents will receive monthly questionnaires at 4-, 5-, and 6-months post-injury to ask whether their child has recovered from the concussion. Once the parent indicates complete recovery, which is defined for them as \u201call of the symptoms that were caused BY THE INJURY have GONE AWAY and DO NOT RETURN when doing physical or mental activities such as exercise or studying for school,\u201d they will estimate a date of recovery and will no longer receive surveys. Parents who indicate \u201cno, not recovered\u201d will complete additional questions about the nature of the persistent symptoms and will continue to receive monthly queries up to 6-months post-injury.Data analysisDevelopment cohort analysisAnalytical approachOur overall approach will involve iteratively fitting models to predict PPCS as defined by a PCSI Retrospective Adjusted Post-Injury Difference (RAPID) score (pre-injury PCSI score subtracted from the post-injury PCSI score) greater than 5 at the T3 visit.52 Benchmark predictability will be determined with clinical factors alone; next we will test predictability of individual biomarkers alone; the third step will combine clinical, biomarker and psychosocial variables; finally, we will examine the effects of confounders and effect moderators such as medication and treatment, gender, mechanism of injury, and comorbidities. For each model we will estimate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). We will employ 10-fold cross validation to avoid overfitting. Point estimates will be the average of the estimates from each of the ten folds and we will calculate bootstrapped confidence intervals.Benchmark modelClinical variables previously shown to be related to developing PPCS13 include: age, gender, prior concussion history and symptom duration, history of physician-diagnosed migraine, physician-diagnosed anxiety, physician-diagnosed depression, self-reported headache, self-reported sensitivity to noise, and self-reported fatigue. We will test for differences between participants with and without PPCS using chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate. We will fit separate logistic regression models using each variable as well as varying combinations of variables. Models will be ranked in terms of AUC with the model producing the best testing characteristics serving as the benchmark for evaluating improvements at predicting PPCS with the addition of biomarkers.Individual biomarkersFor each biomarker, the AUC and Youden's index will be calculated in univariable logistic regression models to predict PPCS. One model per imaging modality will be developed. For modalities producing many predictors, we will use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality prior to modeling. The optimal dichotomization of each multi-level or continuous biomarker will be selected using a combination of Youden's index and clinical judgment.Benchmark + individual biomarkersNext, we will separately add each biomarker and psychosocial variables to the benchmark model and assess changes in testing characteristics. Biomarkers will be ranked from most to least improvement in AUC. Any biomarker with a marginally significant p value (p < 0.20) for either a main effect or interaction will be eligible for the risk stratification model and continued in the Validation Phase.Expected powerWe will enroll 370 EMA in the Development Cohort. With an expected loss to follow-up rate of 15%, we project having data from 315 EMA available for this analysis. We project 35% of males and 50% of females to have PPCS at follow-up.53 Assuming an equal split between males and females, we estimate we will have 268 PPCS participants in the Development Cohort. Based on the results of the 5P study, we expect our benchmark model to achieve an AUC of 0.68. Our expected sample size will provide a power of 0.78 to detect an increase in AUC of 0.06.Risk stratification algorithmUsing all clinical factors and biomarker passing the above threshold, we will develop a risk stratification tool for predicting PPCS. A common rule of thumb for logistic regression models is to have at least 10 participants per predictor. It is likely we will have more than 26 clinical and biomarker candidate variables; therefore, we will apply a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty to our logistic regression model. We will use 10-fold cross validation to estimate the optimal value of the tuning parameter, t*. We will then choose the value of t, t\u2032, which produces the least complex model and has a prediction error within one standard deviation of the t* model. Our clinical risk score will be developed from our final model by assigning points to each predictor variable with the final point total corresponding to the risk estimate, following the method described by Sullivan and colleagues.54 High, medium, and low risk cut points will be determined by a consensus meeting of the investigators. We will report standard testing metrics such as AUC, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, likelihood ratio negative, and likelihood ratio positive.Validation cohort analysisWe will use the Validation Cohort to test the predictive ability, sensitivity, and specificity of our algorithm. If we are unable to demonstrate acceptable performance of the risk stratification rule (AUC <0.65) on the validation cohort, we will create a new algorithm which incorporates 66% of the development and validation cohorts for derivation and validate it on the remaining 34% of participants.EndophenotypesLatent class analysis (LCA) will be used to classify multi-dimensional clinical and biomarker variables into phenotypic groups. Continuous variables and biomarkers will be dichotomized or broken into three groups (i.e., high, medium, low) according to clinical and biological cutoffs. To avoid fitting a model with too many variables we will conduct screening on all potential clinical, biospecimen, autonomic, and imaging variables. We will compare distributions of predictors between the PPCS and non-PPCS groups using two-sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous predictors and chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests for categorical and binary predictors. Predictors achieving a marginally significant p value of 0.10 or less will be included in the LCA model. The number of classes will be selected by comparing the log likelihood ratio, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and p values. Models producing sparse groups will be rejected in favor of models with fewer groups of sufficient size. Models will be assessed for clinical plausibility and goodness of fit will be examined using entropy r-squared, univariate residuals, and bivariate residuals.If too many variables pass the screening method and threaten the stability of the LCA model, we will first perform dimension reduction via PCA within each domain: clinical, FBM, autonomic, and imaging. We will investigate the use of previously published scores, as well as perform PCA within domains before rerunning the LCA. In order to capture any interactions potentially excluded from the LCA approach, we will build a Classification and Regression Tree (CART). Different paths through the tree will be examined for combinations of variables and identification of phenotypes. Ten-fold cross validation will be used to determine the optimal value for the complexity parameter. Variables determined to be most important for class selection will be examined. Any biomarkers important for identifying phenotypes will be continued in the Validation Phase. This analysis will be repeated for two specific endophenotypes of interest migrainous headache and anxiety/mood disorders by replacing the general outcome of overall PPCS with each specific symptom cluster.As an alternate approach, we will apply a group LASSO procedure where categories of predictors are included or excluded together. In this fashion, we will be able to assess the importance of each type of biomarker or clinical variable. Additionally, LASSO can sometimes perform poorly in the presence of many correlated predictors. We will explore utilizing an elastic net procured for deriving our final logistic regression model as well. All models will be compared in terms of AUC and sensitivity.Anticipated productsThere are several major deliverables that will arise from this project. The primary goal will be an algorithm to improve prediction of one or more endophenotypes of PPCS. By linking clinical symptom phenotypes to objective markers (neurocognitive, PTH, autonomic, imaging and/or molecular), it is hypothesized that different biological categories of PPCS will be identifiable as early as possible. This will have implications for clinical management: 1) mechanism-based therapies may be directed toward specific endophenotypes; and 2) different endophenotypes may have different prognosis and recovery trajectories. Further, the potential to identify these subtypes of PPCS will likely enhance research efforts by focusing future clinical treatment trials to endophenotypes with specific biological targets, as well as open the possibility of preventive interventions to interrupt ongoing processes that may lead to chronic symptoms.This effort will also contribute substantially to the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research (FITBIR) database, providing not only clinical data (symptoms, neurologic examination and neurocognitive) but linked to deep biomarker phenotypes based on each of the three cores. Importantly, much of the extant data in FITBIR comes from adult TBI subjects (TRACK-TBI, CARE Consortium), and a major contribution of CARE4KIDS CONSORTIUM will be the addition of hundreds of adolescent mTBI/concussion subjects. In addition to the repository of individual multimodal data, CARE4KIDS CONSORTIUM will also collect, organize, and store individual blood/serum samples in the NINDS biorepository at BioSEND. This will be a resource for future investigations.Another important contribution of CARE4Kids Consortium will be the innovative use of different remote data collection methods. This study is collecting interim symptom and treatment data from both subjects and parents during the remote T2 data collection, using prompts from the MyCap app, which interfaces with the REDCap database. In addition, we are monitoring data entry compliance and using compliance as a retention/motivational tool to keep subjects engaged between their in-person T1 and T3 study visits. We are also using a follow-up questionnaire, Recovery Discovery (piloted during the 4CYC data collection that preceded CARE4Kids Consortium) to help identify more precisely when a subject symptomatically recovers from their concussion. Remote blood collection will be explored through a comparative study of the Hemolink device with conventional venipuncture. If validated, this could provide an important additional means to capture blood-based markers without the subjects having to be in-person. And lastly, while the autonomic biomarker core currently requires a complex, highly monitored data collection protocol, promising remote autonomic data collection devices (like the Scosche armband) will be validated against a gold standard of in-person physiological monitoring. Such devices offer the potential to collect daily changes in activity, sleep, and autonomic function.",

All animal experiments were compliant with the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines and experiments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH publication #8023, revised 1978). Male (\u223c260 g average weight) Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River) were used at 8 weeks of age.Animals were randomly assigned to groups, using random number generators (n = 8/group). Researchers were blinded to treatment groups during outcome assessment and data analysis. Six experimental groups were included in the study: Sham Vehicle, rmbTBI Vehicle, rmbTBI MP201 Early 8 mpk, rmbTBI MP201 Delayed 8 mpk, rmbTBI MP201 Early 80 mpk, and rmbTBI MP201 Delayed 80 mpk. Early treatment groups received MP201 after the first mbTBI procedure and then daily, whereas delayed treatment groups received vehicle after the first mbTBI procedure and then MP201 after the second mbTBI procedure daily (Fig. 1). Experiments were performed in four distinct cohorts of 12 animals each. Each cohort contained n = 2 from all six experiment groups. The animals were housed two per cage and maintained in a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Confounding factors were minimized by including various treatment groups in the same cage, ensuring all experimental groups were operated on/analyzed at the same time (especially if the assay required multiple cohorts of animals), and all animals were housed in the same room. All animals were fed a balanced diet ad libitum and water was reverse osmosis generated. The exact number of animals per study is reported within the figure legends. For additional details on common data elements used, see the publication by Hubbard and colleagues.12 For all assays, technical replicates were included.FIG. 1.Experimental design and rmbTBI effects on key physiological parameters.

Pressure parameters (Table 1) were based on recordings from a pitot probe (face-on/reflected and side-on) pressure (custom built, Stumptown Research & Development, LLC, Black Mountain, NC, USA; XTL-190S-100A, Kulite Semiconductor Products, Inc., Leonia, NJ, USA) and piezo-resistive side-on sensors (model #XTEL-100-190S-100A; Kulite). Data from each sensor were routed directly to the TMX-18 (AstroNova, Inc., West Warwick, RI, USA) and analyzed using AstroView software (AstroNova, Inc.).Table 1.Parameters of Blast Exposure Based on Experimental GroupExperimental groupBlast dayPeak static overpressure (psi)Positive overpressure duration (msec)Positive impulse (psi*msec)Peak total overpressure (psi)Peak dynamic overpressure (psi)Blast Vehicle1st Blast11.81 \u00b1 1.296.63 \u00b1 0.3237.40 \u00b1 3.4724.02 \u00b1 4.4412.22 \u00b1 3.212nd Blast11.99 \u00b1 0.676.44 \u00b1 0.1637.49 \u00b1 1.6424.28 \u00b1 1.7012.29 \u00b1 1.23 Early 8 mpk1st Blast11.56 \u00b1 1.386.59 \u00b1 0.2036.45 \u00b1 3.0623.17 \u00b1 3.2411.61 \u00b1 1.982nd Blast10.99 \u00b1 1.336.51 \u00b1 0.2635.15 \u00b1 2.3821.62 \u00b1 3.5210.63 \u00b1 2.25 Delayed 8 mpk1st Blast11.98 \u00b1 0.646.50 \u00b1 0.2338.21 \u00b1 1.4124.87 \u00b1 2.1512.89 \u00b1 1.412nd Blast10.45 \u00b1 2.436.74 \u00b1 0.4335.90 \u00b1 3.0421.58 \u00b1 3.9911.13 \u00b1 1.69 Early 80 mpk1st Blast11.45 \u00b1 1.186.64 \u00b1 0.3338.16 \u00b1 1.8622.72 \u00b1 3.7311.26 \u00b1 2.592nd Blast11.03 \u00b1 0.846.50 \u00b1 0.2536.17 \u00b1 2.0621.58 \u00b1 2.7010.55 \u00b1 1.89 Delayed 80 mpk1st Blast11.03 \u00b1 1.956.69 \u00b1 0.3836.58 \u00b1 3.3221.48 \u00b1 5.8010.44 \u00b1 4.002nd Blast11.83 \u00b1 0.366.46 \u00b1 0.1337.04 \u00b1 1.8523.52 \u00b1 2.3611.68 \u00b1 2.20Sprague-Dawley rats were transported and temporarily housed in a climate-controlled room enclosed away from the blast tests and had access to food and water ad libitum throughout the course of the experiment. Immediately prior to injury, the rats were anesthetized with isoflurane using a SomnoSuite Low-Flow Anesthesia System (Kent Scientific Corp., Torrington, CT, USA). Rats received 900 mL/min flow at 4.0% isoflurane until fully anesthetized and then were placed on a nose cone (400 mL/min at 2.5% isoflurane) for physiological recordings. Rats were placed into a mesh netting support (Industrial Netting, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and secured into the MBD (2 ft from open end of tube) laterally with the left side facing the blast.54 Once loaded into the MBD, the rat's body was protected from direct forces by a steel tube that surrounded the body but left the head completely exposed to the blast. The rats were subjected to compressed helium-driven blasts at 11 psi peak static overpressure (blast parameters for each group are detailed in Table 1) to model mbTBI. Physiological recordings were taken using SomnoSuite technology (MouseSTAT) 5 min before and 5 min after the mbTBI procedure. Sham animals had all procedures performed, except for blast exposure. Rats were monitored and recovered before return transportation.MP201 administrationMP201 was formulated at either 8 or 80 mg/kg in the vehicle solution (mixture of 99% 0.5% methyl cellulose and 1% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO; CHEBI:28262]).38 Rats were given 10 mL/kg or approximately 2.5 mL of solution (depending on weight) at each dose of MP201, or vehicle depending upon group designation. MP201 was administered by oral gavage according to the experimental design (Fig. 1). MP201 was given 15 min post-mbTBI on the days of blast exposure.Fractionated mitochondrial magnetic separationFMMS was completed to fractionate synaptic and glia-enriched mitochondria based on recent publications50\u201352 with key modifications for rat brain tissue. Unilateral hippocampus, PFC, and AEP regions were dissected following CO2 exposure. Tissues were homogenized and centrifuged at 1300g for 3 min. This homogenate contains free-floating glia-enriched as well as intact synaptosomes. The supernatant was placed in a fresh tube and the pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer to be spun again at 1300g for 3 min. The supernatants from the first and second spins were incubated with anti-Tom22 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) at a concentration of 8 \u03bcL for every 1 mg of starting wet-tissue weight for 30 min. Brain tissue of 8 \u03bcL/mg was determined as the optimal concentration that ensured all free mitochondria were captured.The mixture was then added to MACS separation LS columns, attached to a Quadro MACS Separator (catalog #130\u2013097-040, Miltenyi Biotec) to capture free mitochondria (glia-enriched fraction). The column was plunged and the resulting sample was transferred to a 1.5 \u03bcL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 13 ,000g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Meanwhile, the eluate (containing synaptosomes) from the LS columns was spun at 13, 000g for 10 min before being placed into the pressurized nitrogen cell disruptor. Once the synaptosomes burst, the resulting solution was incubated with anti-Tom22 microbeads (3 \u03bcL for every 1 mg of starting tissue) for 30 min. The mixture was then added to new MACS separation LS columns, attached to a Quadro MACS Separator, plunged, and spun down for protein quantification.Mitochondrial respirometry using Seahorse XFe96Mitochondrial bioenergetics were assayed in isolated mitochondria according to previous studies.51,52 Briefly, Seahorse XFe96 Flux Analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to determine oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) in the presence of mitochondrial substrates, inhibitors, and uncouplers. On the day before the assay, the sensor cartridge was hydrated. On the day of the assay, injection ports A to D of the sensor cartridge were loaded to measure the OCR in various mitochondrial respiration states. Chemical stocks were diluted appropriately in respiration buffer (RB; 125 mM KCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl2, and 2.5 mM KH2PO4, adjusted pH 7.2) to make the final concentration of the chemicals 5 mM pyruvate, 2.5 mM malate, and 2 mM adenosine diphosphate (ADP; via Port A; State IIIC1), 2.5 \u03bcM oligomycin A (via Port B; State IV), 4 \u03bcM carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP; via Port C; State VC1), and 1 \u03bcM rotenone and 10 mM of succinate (via Port D; State VCII).Next, 3 \u03bcg non-synaptic and 6 \u03bcg synaptic mitochondrial protein, as measured using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (#23227, Pierce), were loaded per well in a volume of 30 \u03bcL. Plates were centrifuged and RB was gently added for a total volume of 175 \u03bcL in each Seahorse XFe96 well. OCRs were measured based on additions in each injection port. Raw OCR values were used for analysis within a given experiment and reported in all figures. Plate-to-plate and day-to-day variation may result in variable absolute OCR values between experiments, which necessitated the use of blocking factor in statistical analysis.Oxidative damage measurementsMitochondrial homogenate aliquots (unused during respiration assays) were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until utilization for oxidative stress dot-blots. In these samples, 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) were assessed as previously described.19,52 Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (catalog #23227, Thermofisher). Dot-blots were made from 500 ng of mitochondrial lysate per sample in a 96-well Bio-Dot microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad). Nitrotyrosine polyclonal antibody (1:2500; catalog #A-21285, Thermofisher) and anti-4 HNE antiserum (1:2500; catalog #HNE11-S, Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX, USA) were used along with IRDye 800 CW goat anti-rabbit IgG (1: 10,000; catalog #926-3221, LI-COR Biosciences, USA) secondary antibody to detect 4-HNE and 3-NT expressions from mitochondrial lysates. The membranes were scanned and dot-blot intensities were quantified using a LI-COR DLx Odyssey imaging system.Mitochondrial complex activity quantificationMethods were adapted from those of Kalimon and colleagues.55 Frozen mitochondrial aliquots were utilized for the assessment of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes in the Seahorse XFe96 Flux Analyzer. Mitochondria were thawed on ice prior to dilution in Mir05 buffer (0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2, 60 mM lactobionic acid, 20 mM taurine, 10 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES, 110 mM sucrose). Mitochondria (1.5 \u03bcg) were resuspended in 75 \u03bcL of Mir05 buffer and spun at 3000g for 10 min. The OCR measurements were carried out using Seahorse XFe96 after topping up the wells with 100 \u03bcL of MiR05 to final concentrations of alamethicin (35 \u03bcg/mL), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH; 3.5 mM), and cytochrome c (17.52 \u03bcM). Remaining substrates and inhibitors of the electron transport chain were prepared in RB without BSA and loaded into the injection ports as followed: (A) rotenone (0.8 \u03bcM) and succinate (10 mM), (B) antimycin A (1 \u03bcM), (C) ascorbate (20 mM) and N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD; 5 mM), and (D) sodium azide (549.3 mM). Complex I activity was derived from the NADH reading minus the antimycin A reading. Complex II activity was calculated from the succinate reading minus the antimycin A reading. Complex IV activity was derived from the ascorbate/TMPD reading minus the sodium azide reading.Statistical analysisPower analysis was conducted (using G*Power statistical software, version 3.0.10) for all experimental data and was based on previous published literature from our group. Analysis was completed based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical tests and output of F score. A priori analysis was performed and effect size was calculated based on expected mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) within each group. Sample size was calculated using the following parameters: \u03b1 = 0.05, 1 \u2212 \u03b2 = 0.8, and SD 20% of mean for experimental groups. Primary outcomes for sample size determination were State III mitochondrial bioenergetics. Statistical analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, CA, USA) or JMP 12 (SAS, NC, USA). For all analyses, a significant difference among groups was defined as p < 0.05. For each measure, data were measured using interval/ratio scales. The Brown-Forsythe and Bartlett's tests were performed to ensure homogeneity of variance. Further, the Shapiro-Wilk test was completed to ensure normality. As these criteria were met for all experimental data, parametric statistics were employed for all analyses.

We have reported previously on our data sources, methods for cohort creation, variables, validation strategies, and analysis plans.11 Additional details are provided in Supplementary Appendix SA1.Patient sampleAll adult patients who were treated for acute cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral or cauda equina tSCIs in the province of British Columbia (BC) in Canada from 2001 to 2017 were identified by scanning the Discharge Abstract Database (Hospital Separations) using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes by Population Data BC.12 The tSCI case definition was validated by mapping ICD-10 CA codes to International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) descriptions of tSCI by level and severity.11 The eligible patient sample represents all tSCIs over this 17-year period in a geographic population estimated to be more than 5 million.13Population Data BC provides research access to linkable, longitudinal, de-identified patient-level datasets. Over the 17-year period of the study, the attitudes of the treating spine surgeons at the specialized center with regard to treatment of patients with acute tSCI did not change substantially. For example, early surgery was always advocated while use of methylprednisolone was not, and intensive multi-disciplinary rehabilitation was always provided.We excluded patients who had an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of less than 9 (considered minor injuries).6 We excluded patients with sensorimotor complete (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale [AIS] A) injuries because almost all individuals with such complete injuries were treated in specialized care (93% of 563), thus precluding a comparison against non-specialized care.Data sourcesData were linked from the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database (Hospital Separations),12 BC Provincial Vital Statistics Agency (Deaths),14 the BC Trauma Registry, Medical Services Plan (MSP) Payment Information File,15 MSP Consolidation File (MSP Registration and Premium Billing),16 and the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry (RHSCIR).17,18Interventions\u2013specialized versus non-specialized acute SCI hospital careWe defined specialized acute hospital according to recommendations reported by Parent and associates3 (Table 1). Only one acute care hospital in BC met these criteria over the study duration, which was also the only acute care hospital in BC accredited under the Accreditation Canada SCI Standards of Care program.2 All other hospitals in our dataset (n = 11) were considered non-specialized care. Patients whose acute care occurred at a non-specialized center but whose subsequent rehabilitation occurred at a specialized SCI rehabilitation center were analyzed in the non-specialized acute hospital care group.Table 1.Components of Specialized Acute Hospital Care for Patients With Acute Traumatic Spinal Cord Injuries According to Recommendations Reported by Parent and Coworkers3 1. Location within or in close proximity to a Level 1 trauma center 2. 24-h on call availability of a dedicated spine surgery team 3. 24-h rapid access to magnetic resonance imaging and an operating room 4. A dedicated \u201cspinal unit\u201d for patient care that involves a physical space with a wide range of multi-disciplinary specialists (spine surgeons, physiatrists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurse coordinators, social workers, psychologists) 5. A streamlined referral partnership to an in-patient spinal cord injury rehabilitation centerStatistical analysisWe present unadjusted survival using Kaplan-Meier curves. We tested for unadjusted and adjusted associations between type of care and the primary outcome event of death at one year from the time of first tSCI admission after injury using univariate and multiple logistic regression. Candidate variables were initially selected based on clinical importance, and adjusted models. Candidate variables were: age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, ISS, spine surgery, traumatic brain injury, injury level, transfer from another hospital, and time to admission.1,3,4,6,18\u201322We evaluated model fit using the coefficient of determination (Nagelkerke R2), and we also performed Hosmer-Lemeshow \u201cgoodness-of-fit\u201d tests, which showed satisfactory performance for all models. Odds Ratios (ORs) are reported with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). We removed the spine surgery variable from our final models because it was highly colinear with specialized care.We performed a priori subgroup analyses investigating the effects of specialized care among patients with age <65 years and ISS of \u226516 (major trauma) and \u226525 (critically injured19) because prior literature suggested differential prognosis among these patients.6,20\u201322 We performed secondary analyses using Cox regression to account for censoring and propensity-score matching to alternatively control for potential confounders. Propensity score matching used a 1:1 greedy technique with the same variables as the logistic regression models (age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, ISS, surgery, traumatic brain injury [TBI], injury level, transfer from another hospital, and time to admission).Caliper distance was 0.25 and no particular variables were set to be exact matches between groups. Mortality rates between matched groups were compared using a chi-square test. We also report on death at 30 days as a secondary outcome.All tests of significance were two-tailed and p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Missing data were managed by substitution from other data sources within the linked cohort when available. We report Relative and Absolute Risk Reductions (RRR and ARR) and Numbers Needed to Treat (NNT = 1/ARR) to prevent one death to aid interpretation of treatment effects, based on the propensity score matched analyses. Standard Differences are reported for continuous variables. Cells with less than five events were not reported to protect privacy.

    "PMC10458363": "MethodsParticipantsThe Football Players Health Study (FPHS) at Harvard University12 recruited 31 former ASF players between the ages of 33 and 60 who: (1) contracted with professional ASF leagues after 1960, the year hard plastic helmets were adopted13; (2) completed the FPHS Health and Wellness survey between the ages of 29 and 55 years; and (3) had previously self-reported a diagnosis of cardiometabolic, neurocognitive, chronic pain, and/or sleep disorder or as unafflicted by any of those conditions.14These participants underwent PET scanning on the Discovery MI-5 (GE Healthcare) PET/CT scanner at the Gordon Center for Medical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA) between 2019 and 2020. We examined p-Tau tracer uptake among 27 former professional ASF players after exclusions based on tracer failure, compromised cerebellum data, or lack of corollary MRI data.A convenience sample of 11 white male controls (age range: 47\u201360) was recruited from the Framingham Heart Study15 cohort to characterize molecular signatures of pre-clinical and clinical Alzheimer disease using PET. These control participants were unexposed to RHI and scanned on the same Discovery MI-5 (GE Healthcare) PET/CT scanner at the Gordon Center for Medical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA) between 2018 and 2020. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and approval was granted by the Human Research Protection Program at Mass General Brigham.CovariatesAge and race were determined as described previously.1 Only players who endorsed either \u201cBlack\u201d or \u201cwhite\u201d were included, because of the limited ASF participation of other race groups. The FPHS Health and Wellness survey queried age of first football exposure and years of youth, high school, collegiate, and professional play.These were used to categorize four football exposure measures: (1) age of first football exposure, (2) total years of football, (3) total National Football League (NFL) seasons, and (4) self-reported total number of concussion signs and symptoms (concussion signs and symptoms score) accumulated during football play or practice.As described previously,1,16,17 the concussion signs and symptoms score was quantified by summing the frequency of each of 10 concussion signs and symptoms (included headaches, nausea, dizziness, loss of consciousness, memory problems, disorientation, confusion, seizure, visual problems, and feeling unsteady on one's feet) reported to have occurred after a blow to the head or neck. Total NFL seasons was used as a continuous variable in models adjusting for age, race, and position. Position was divided into defensive back, defensive line, kicker/punter, linebacker, offensive line, quarterback, running back, tight end, wide receiver, and special teams only.For comparison with the football player sample in Stern and associates,6 we conducted sensitivity analyses only in players with subjective cognitive complaints. Consistent with previous work,6 perceived neurocognitive function was measured (Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders [Neuro-QOL18]-Applied Cognition-General Concerns [short form]). Specifically, to create a subsample of football players selected for reporting subjective neurocognitive dysfunction, participants scoring more than one standard deviation below the mean (i.e., T-score <40) were considered to have subjective cognitive dysfunction, and they were included in sensitivity analyses. An additional sensitivity analysis was conducted in ASF players over the age of 43 to match ASF participants in the Stern and associates6 study.Neuroimaging data acquisitionMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)All subjects underwent structural MRI procedures for anatomical reference. A three-dimensional (3D) structural T1-weighted multi-echo magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MEMPRAGE) image was acquired using a 3 T Skyra (Siemens Medical Systems) scanner and root-mean squared image calculated for the population of former ASF players. A 3D structural T1-weighted turbo field echo (TFE) was acquired using a 3 T Achieva (Philips) scanner for the control population. All MRI scans had a matrix size of 256 \u00d7 256 and a slice thickness of 1 mm and 1 mm isotropic voxel dimensions.Positron mission tomography (PET)All subjects underwent PET procedures on the same scanning equipment in the same location. Each participant received A\u03b2 and p-Tau PET imaging measured by C-Pittsburgh Compound B([11C]-PiB) and [18F]-FTP (Avid Radiopharmaceuticals), synthesized and administered onsite. [11C]-PiB imaging was acquired in dynamic mode with an injection of 15mCi (555 MBq) intravenous bolus, and [18F]-FTP was measured 75 min after a 10mCi (370 MBq) bolus injection for a duration of 30 min.Prior to each PET scan, a low-dose X-ray computed tomography (CT) scan was performed for attenuation correction. Each PET scan used the full width at half maximum (FWHM) spatial resolution, measured at the center of the axial field of view (radial position = 1 cm), was 4.3 mm and 5.1 mm in transverse and axial directions, respectively.PET data were reconstructed using a validated 3D time-of-flight iterative reconstruction algorithm with five iterations and 16 subsets while applying corrections for scatter, attenuation, deadtime, random coincident events, and scanner normalization. Final reconstructed images contained voxel dimensions of 256 \u00d7 256 \u00d7 89 and voxel sizes of 1.173 \u00d7 1.17 \u00d7 2.8mm.Image processing and analysisPET data processing was performed using Matlab software,19 based on code and function from SPM1220 and FSL21 software packages. The MRI images were processed and manually edited on FreeSurfer (FSv6.0).22 All MRI and PET images were registered into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space as described previously.23The PET images were motion-corrected and rigidly co-registered to the structural MRI image, transformed into the MNI space using a 12-parameter affine transformation followed by nonlinear warping. The transformation matrices were combined and applied inversely on MNI, Harvard\u2013Oxford atlases (available in FSL), and FreeSurfer regions to warp the regions of interest (ROI; Supplementary Table S1) into the native PET images for extraction of radioactivity time\u2013activity curves.The PiB and FTP retentions were expressed by distribution volume ratios (DVR) and 80\u2013100 min standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR), respectively, with the cerebellar grey matter as reference.23,24 Subjects were defined as A\u03b2 positive if the PiB DVR global A\u03b2 burden in a large neocortical aggregate (FreeSurfer-derived \u201cFLR\u201d regions composed of frontal, lateral parietal and temporal, and retrospenial regions) was \u22651.2.25The ROIs surveyed were bilateral superior frontal, bilateral medial temporal, and left parietal from the MNI and Harvard\u2013Oxford atlases to compare with published findings.6 We additionally utilized FreeSurfer parcellation results to examine more precisely brain regions from the medial temporal cortex known to be involved in AD and CTE-NC,26 such as the entorhinal cortex,27,28 hippocampus,29 parahippocampus, and amygdala.30 We calculated correlations between choroid plexus and hippocampal FTP uptake separately in Black and white players to explore evidence of potential off-target neuromelanin FTP binding.Neuropsychological TestingIn-person neuropsychological tests were selected to approximate testing conducted by Stern and associates,6 including measures of depression (PHQ-9),31 memory (Neuropsychological Assessment Battery [NAB] List Learning Test Delayed Recall),32 and executive function (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Category Fluency Test [D-KEFS]33).The PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess symptoms of depression experienced during the previous fortnight.31 Participants rate the frequency of depression-related symptoms and/or behaviors on a 0\u20133 scale, with higher scores representing greater symptoms, and the cutoff score for screening positively for depression is 10.34,35 The D-KEFS Category Fluency Test33 involves naming as many words that belong to a specific category as possible within one minute (i.e., first names for a specified gender). The number of correct words produced are age-corrected (mean = 10, standard deviation [SD] = 3).The NAB List Learning Test32 involves three learning trials of a 12-word list, followed by an interference list, and then free recall testing immediately after the interference list and after a 10\u201315 min delay. Participants who obtained a low score on a performance validity test (Test of Memory Malingering or TOMM,36 Trial 1 score \u226435) were excluded from analyses using the cognitive test scores, but imaging data and mood scales for these participants were included.Statistical analysisBetween group differences were calculated with voxelwise linear regression models of FTP SUVR maps using SPM12 (p < 0.005; uncorrected for multiple comparisons) and restricted to \u2265100 voxel clusters to increase comparability with similar studies. Between group comparisons for region-based analyses was performed with Mann\u2013Whitney tests. Spearman age-adjusted partial correlations were used to illustrate relationships between regional FTP SUVRs and total years of football exposure.We utilized a two-step residual method adjusting for age, race, and position37 to assess associations between SUVR values and football exposures. First, we used demographic and football-relevant variables from the questionnaire administered to 2265 FPHS participants within the age range of the PET subjects (29 years to 60 years). We extracted the residuals from separate linear regression models of each football exposure predicted by age, race, and football position.We then tested linear models to predict PET SUVR values using the residuals from the first stage model for each exposure. By design, the residuals reflect the variation in each football exposure variable independent of age, race, and position, thus adjusting for age, race, and position. Age- and race-adjusted multi-variable linear regression was used to measure associations between SUVR and neurocognitive and mood outcomes (the dependent variables). Exposure analyses were conducted using R Statistical Software.38All sensitivity analyses on subsets of the former player sample were conducted and analyzed as described previously. Distributions were reported using means and SD measures, and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.",

    "PMC10541942": "MethodsStudy design and patientsThe Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) core study is a prospective longitudinal non-randomized observational study, registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT02210221, which included patients with TBI from 18 countries across Europe and in Israel between 2014 and 2017. Inclusion criteria were: (1) a clinical diagnosis of TBI, (2) a clinical indication for a computed tomographic (CT) scan, (3) presentation within 24 h of injury, and (4) informed consent obtained according to local and national policies. Patients were excluded if they had a severe pre-existing neurological disorder that would confound outcome assessments. For this particular study, patients from Israel and those <16 years of age were excluded. Ethical approval for the CENTER-TBI study was obtained from all responsible medical ethical committees, and informed consent procedures followed applicable regulations.23Clinical dataClinical data were prospectively collected by local research staff using electronic case report forms (eCRF). Data were de-identified using a randomly generated Global Unique Patient Identifier (GUPI) and stored on a secured database by the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) (www.incf.org) in Stockholm, Sweden. Data were extracted in January 2021 (version 3.1) and included demographic characteristics, trauma and injury information, results of neurological assessment, imaging, and patient outcomes. Using the baseline Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, patients were classified into three categories of TBI severity: GCS 13\u201315 (mild TBI), GCS 9\u201312 (moderate TBI), and GCS 3\u20138 (severe TBI).24 The baseline GCS score is a derived variable and represents the total GCS score for baseline risk adjustment. The systemic injury severity score (ISS) was categorized into three groups: ISS \u226416 (minor injury), ISS 17\u201325 (major injury), and ISS >25 (critical injury).25 Pre-injury health status was classified using the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification.26 Brain injury is further described according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and classified as minor, moderate, serious, severe, critical, or unsurvivable.27Healthcare consumptionHealthcare consumption data were extracted following the same procedure as with clinical data. The healthcare consumption of patients included seven main healthcare service categories: (1) pre-hospital care, including ambulance transportation and, for secondary referral patients, costs of TBI-related admission and any emergent surgical interventions in the \u201creferring hospital,\u201d before admission to a CENTER-TBI study hospital; (2) hospital admission, including initial assessment and care at the emergency room (ER) and length of stay (LOS) in days at the ward or ICU; (3) all surgical interventions, both intra- and extra-cranial; (4) imaging of the brain; (5) laboratory; (6) blood products; and (7) rehabilitation; including only LOS at an inpatient rehabilitation center. Healthcare consumption of outpatient rehabilitation care facilities was not included. The transitions of care forms, in which the care pathway of patients was registered, were used to extract the in-hospital LOS of patients. Inpatient rehabilitation LOS was extracted using the transitions of care forms and patient-reported outcome forms. Missing LOS at the ward, ICU, and rehabilitation were imputed using single imputation. All healthcare services registered within CENTER-TBI and included in this study are reported in Supplementary Table S1.Healthcare costsBecause of the unavailability of country-specific unit prices for each healthcare service, Dutch reference prices were used as fundament for this study. In addition, definitions, calculations, and sources of country-specific unit prices may vary (e.g., unit prices can differ based on the inclusion/exclusion of personnel costs), which could potentially lead to an over- or underestimation of costs when such unit prices are used. For example, it was found that the reported monthly salary for a senior resident ranged from a low between \u20ac500 and \u20ac800 in Eastern Europe to a high of \u20ac7900 in Norway.28 By using a uniform price list, this study focuses on differences in healthcare consumption rather than price differences among countries.Reference prices were extracted from the Dutch Guidelines for economic healthcare evaluations.29 Reference prices not mentioned in the Dutch Guidelines were complemented using unit prices reported by the Netherlands Healthcare Authority or by using the average national price, based on declared fees30,31 (Supplementary Table S1). First, using the Dutch national general consumer price index, all reference prices were corrected to EURO 2017, the last year of patient inclusion (Supplementary Table S2).32 Second, in order to calculate the economic burden of a patient with TBI within Europe, the Dutch reference prices were converted to country-specific unit prices by correcting the Dutch reference prices for the purchasing power parity (PPP) for the general domestic product (GDP) (Supplementary Table S3). The GDP-PPP is the standard measure when comparing differences in life standards among countries.33Third, the total intramural healthcare costs were calculated by multiplying the number of healthcare units (e.g. length of days at ward and ICU for hospitalization costs) with the corresponding reference price, according to country of admission. See Supplemental Methods, Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 for further details about the calculations. Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Baseline characteristics of patients are based on crude data and presented as absolute numbers and percentages. Continuous variables are presented as medians (interquartile range [IQR]) and means (standard deviation [SD]). Median and mean prices were rounded to hundreds. To compare continuous and categorical variables across all subgroups, the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test and the \u03c72 test were applied respectively. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Healthcare consumption (i.e., LOS at ICU, ward, and rehabilitation unit) and total healthcare costs were presented for the total study population, including all severities, and according to TBI severity.Missing data were statistically imputed based on correlations among baseline characteristics, healthcare consumption, in-hospital mortality, and Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) score at 6 months using the mice package in R.34 To determine between-country differences in ICU and ward LOS, a mixed linear regression model was applied, with results presented in forest plots. The country effect was included in the model as a random intercept, and case-mix adjustment was performed using variables in the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) prognostic model: age, pupils, GCS score, hypoxia, hypotension, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, epidural hemorrhage, Marshall CT classification, hemoglobin, and glucose measurements.35 Countries including fewer than five patients per severity group were excluded from this analysis.We used a mixed general linear model (GLM) with gamma distribution and log link function to determine which baseline characteristics were associated with the total intramural healthcare costs. GLM models are recommended for use in linear regression of costs data, as they provide parametric methods of analysis in which non-normal distributions can be specified.36 A random effect for country was added to both the univariable and multi-variable models to account for between-country differences in costs. Statistical analysis were performed in STATA and R version 4.0.4.37,38",
    "PMC10458380": "MethodsStudy populationThe study population consisted of participants from the prospective longitudinal observational Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study (registration number: NCT02210221). The data version used for this study was Core 3.0.27 Patients were enrolled from December 2014 to December 2017 in 63 centers across Europe and Israel. Ethical approval was obtained for each recruiting site and informed consent was obtained from all patients and/or their legal representative/next of kin: https://www.center-tbi.eu/project/ethical-approval. Inclusion criteria for the core study were a clinical diagnosis of TBI, presentation within 24 h after injury, and an indication for CT scanning according to local rules. Patients were excluded if they had severe pre-existing neurological disorder that could confound outcome assessments.2 In CENTER-TBI, participants were differentiated by care pathway and assigned to the emergency department (ED) stratum (discharged from an ED), admission stratum (admitted to a hospital ward), or intensive care unit (ICU) stratum (admitted to the ICU).2We selected participants who were 16 years or older with a baseline GCS 13 to 15 and available outcome assessments. The majority of predictors measured at presentation were missing in <5% of included participants, but post-traumatic amnesia duration (15-17%), loss of consciousness (7-8%), education levels (9-13%), and employment (5-6%) had higher percentages of missingness (Table 1; Supplementary Table S1). CT variables were missing in 5-7%, early symptoms in 26-29%, and biomarkers in 17-20% of participants (Table 1; Supplementary Table S1). Missing predictor data were imputed to allow for fair comparison between model variants using multi-variate imputation by chained equations assuming a missingness at random mechanism.28 The imputation model contained all predictor and outcome variables, and predictive mean matching was used for continuous, logistic regression for binary, proportional odds logistic regression for ordinal, and polytomous regression for categorical data. For the development of models containing 2-3\u2013week symptoms, we only selected participants for whom this assessment was obtained. By the CENTER-TBI study design, these assessments were performed in ED stratum and a subgroup of patients admitted to a hospital ward.2Table 1.Characteristics of Mild TBI Patients With Available 6-Month Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE; N = 2376) and Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ; n = 1605), and 2-Week RPQ (n = 640; n = 476) in the CENTER-TBI Study 6-month GOSE 6-month RPQ 6-Month GOSE +2-3-week RPQ 6-Month 2-3-week RPQ n2376Missing %1605Missing %640Missing %476Missing %Age median [Q1, Q3]53 [34, 68]053[35, 66]049[31, 62]051[34.75, 63]0Sex male (%)1519 (63.9)01018 (63.4)0378 (59.1)0279 (58.6)0Pre-injury health ASA-PS (%) 0.8 0.4 0 0No systemic disease1292 (54.8) 909 (56.9) 383 (59.8) 383 (59.8) Mild803 (34.1) 538 (33.7) 2024 (31.9) 158 (33.2) Severe261 (11.1) 151 (9.4) 53 (8.3) 39 (8.2) Psychiatric history (%)312 (13.3)1202 (12.6)0.586 (13.5)0.262 (13.0)0Cause of injury (%) 1.8 1.6 1.1 1.3fall and other1353 (58.0) 888 (56.2) 373 (58.9) 268 (57.0) Traffic846 (36.2) 613 (38.8) 226 (35.7) 185 (39.4) violence135 (5.8) 78 (4.9) 34 (5.4) 17 (3.6) Glasgow Coma Score (%) 0 0 0 013161 (6.8) 103 (6.4) 15 (2.3) 12 (2.5) 14421 (17.7) 269 (16.8) 56 (8.8) 39 (8.2) 151794 (75.5) 1233 (76.8) 569 (88.9) 425 (89.3) Total Injury Severity Score (ISS)median[Q1-Q3]10 [5, 18]0.910[5, 18]0.75 [2, 9]0.25[2.75, 9]0ISS extra-cranial3[0,9]04[0,9]01[0,4]01[0,4]0Head AIS3[2,3]13[2,3]0.82[1,2]0.32[1,2]0.2Any intracranial abnormality (%)1028 (46.3)6.6718 (47.4)5.5113 (18.6)5.298 (21.4)3.6NFL \u226448 hmedian [Q1, Q3]13.5 [7.2, 28.5]20.412.8 [7.3, 25.7]18.28.4[5.2, 14.4]16.48.8[5.6, 14.4]13.7RPQ Total Score at presentation1median [Q1, Q3]8 [2, 15]29.48 [2.75, 15]26.28 [2, 15.75]10.98.50 [2, 16]11.3RPQ Total Score at 2-3 wks2 median [Q1, Q3]8 [0, 20]73.18[2, 21]70.38[0, 20]08 [2, 21]0RPQ Total Score at 6 months median [Q1, Q3]6 [0, 16]32.56 [0, 16]04 [0, 14]25.64 [0, 14]0GOSE at 180 days 0 0.1 0 0189 (3.7) 0 1 (0.2) 0 399 (4.2) 42 (2.6) 8 (1.2) 4 (0.8) 474 (3.1) 53 (3.3) 1 (0.2) 1 (0.2) 5174 (7.3) 119 (7.4) 27 (4.2) 21 (4.4) 6247 (10.4) 205 (12.8) 53 (8.3) 49 (10.3) 7517 (21.8) 410 (25.6) 133 (20.8) 118 (24.8) 81176 (49.5) 775 (48.3) 417 (65.2) 283 (59.5) 1 At median 1 day post-injury [Q1:Q3: 0-1]. 2 At median 20 days [Q1-Q3:15-28]).TBI, traumatic brain injury; CENTER-TBI, Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury; ASA- PS, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status classification; AIS, Abbreviated Injury Score; NFL, neurofilament light.Outcomes assessed at 6 monthsWe analyzed associations with 6-month GOSE and PPCS. The GOSE13 has the following categories: 1) dead; 2) vegetative state; 3) lower severe disability; 4) upper severe disability; 5) lower moderate disability; 6) upper moderate disability; 7) lower good recovery; and 8) upper good recovery. The GOSE was collected using structured interviews and patient/caregiver questionnaires. The categories vegetative state and lower severe disability were combined in one group, as these could not be differentiated in the postal questionnaire. Overall, \u223c22% had GOSE scores outside of the pre-specified 5-8-month window.2 We used GOSE ratings imputed to exactly 180 days based on the GOSE recorded at different time-points (from 2 weeks to 1 year) based on a multi-state model.29 The imputed GOSE variable was made by the CENTER-TBI statisticians and directly extracted from the CENTER-TBI dataset.29,30PPCS were assessed by the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ).31 The RPQ consists of 16 common symptoms that can appear after mTBI/ concussion. Participants are asked to rate how problematic symptoms were compared with symptoms before the injury on a 5-point rating scale (0\u20134). A score of 0 indicates \u201cnot experienced at all\u201d; 1 indicates \u201cno more of a problem (than before)\u201d; 2 indicates \u201ca mild problem\u201d; 3 indicates \u201ca moderate problem\u201d; and 4 indicates \u201ca severe problem.\u201d The total score is calculated as the sum of items, with a range from 0 (representing no change in symptoms since the injury) to 64 (most severe symptoms). When calculating the total score, \u201c1\u201d responses were rated as 0. The questionnaire was translated and linguistically validated in languages of the participating centers.32 When using a binary end-point, we dichotomized the RPQ Total score based on a cutoff \u226516.33Candidate predictorsQuestionnairesThe RPQ was assessed in the hospital center (at presentation or before discharge, median 1 day [Q1-Q3:0-1]), and after 2-3-weeks in participants from ED stratum and in a subgroup of Admission stratum (median 20 days [Q1-Q3:15-28]). The Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM)-5 (PCL-5),34 Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7),35 Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)36 were administered at 2-3 weeks, and were considered as predictors in the \u201c2-3\u2013week\u201d prognostic models. The PCL-534 measures symptoms of PTSD according to DSM-5 criteria. It consists of 20 items that can be answered with 0 = not at all to 5 = extremely, and it can have a score range of 0-80. The GAD-735 measures severity of a general anxiety disorder. It comprises seven items that can be answered from 0 = not at all to 3 = nearly every day, and it can have a score range of 0-21. The PHQ-936 measures the severity of major depressive disorder symptoms. It contains nine items using a 4-point rating scale (from 0 = not at all to 3 = nearly every day), and it can have a score range of 0-27.Clinical and sociodemographic characteristicsSociodemographic, pre-injury, and injury-related variables were prospectively collected as follows: age, GCS, total injury severity score (ISS), sex, psychiatric history, pre-injury health (American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status [ASA PS] Classification), prior TBI, history of migraines or headaches, education level, employment, living alone, cause of injury, alcohol intoxication, pupillary reactivity, post-traumatic amnesia, loss of consciousness, vomiting, and headache (Supplementary Table S1). GCS is the total GCS at baseline (post-stabilization value at emergency department). ISS can range from 0 to 75 (in brain-injured population from 1 to 75)37 and is calculated as the sum of the squares of the three body regions with the highest Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). If any AIS is scored 6, the ISS is automatically 75. Additionally, we calculated extra-cranial ISS (considering the AIS of the face, abdomen, chest, extremities, and external injuries, and excluding the head AIS) and head AIS (the highest AIS out of brain injury, head, neck, and cervical spine).CT variablesWe included the following CT characteristics, scored upon central review of the CT scans obtained at presentation: traumatic axonal injury (TAI), cisternal compression, midline shift (> 5 mm), subarachnoid hemorrhage, contusion, (non-) evacuated hematoma, and a composite variable any abnormality on CT (Supplementary Table S1).BiomarkersWe included the following biomarkers sampled \u226448 h after injury: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), serum neurofilament light (NFL), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), total-Tau (t-tau), and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase -L1 (UCHL1). The median sampling time was 14 h (Q1-Q3: 6-20 h). The sampling was within 24 h for the majority of patients (91%).The sampling of blood-based biomarkers has been described in previous studies.21 S100B and NSE were measured with a clinical-use automated system, using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay kit (ECLIA; Elecsys S100 and Elecsys NSE assays) run on the e602 module of Cobas 8000 modular analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) at the University of Pecs (Pecs, Hungary). Serum GFAP, UCHL1, NFL, and t-tau were analyzed with an ultrasensitive immunoassay using digital array technology (Single Molecule Arrays, [SiMoA]-based Human Neurology 4-Plex B assay (N4PB) run on the SR-X benchtop assay platform (Quanterix Corp., Lexington, MA) at the University of Florida (Gainesville, FL). Medians and interquartile ranges were shown for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables (Table 1; Supplementary Table S2).Model developmentBased on a systematic review,38 a recent review and validation study,12 subsequent studies,17,39,40 and clinical expertise, we selected candidate predictors and easily obtainable core variables. The selection of \u201ccore variables\u201d was guided by the most frequent predictors from prognostic models that satisfied our methodological quality criteria.12 For GOSE, the core model included age, GCS, and ISS. For RPQ, the core model included sex, psychiatric history, and pre-injury health. We extended the core models with: 1) other clinical and sociodemographic variables available at presentation; 2) RPQ total score measured at presentation or before discharge; 3) CT variables; 4) blood-based biomarkers; and 5) RPQ total score, CT results, and biomarkers (Fig. 1); and 6) in the subgroup of participants in whom symptom assessments were performed at 2-3 weeks, 2-3\u2013week post-concussion and mental health symptoms.FIG. 1.Modeling strategy.We used ordinal logistic regression to model the relationship between predictors and the GOSE, and linear regression to model the relationship between predictors and RPQ total score. We assessed nonlinear effects of age, ISS, and biomarkers. We assessed non-linear transformations with polynomials of log-transformed ISS and log-transformed values of biomarkers for both outcomes, and non-linear transformations with polynomials of age and of log-transformed GFAP for prediction of RPQ. When we examined extra-cranial and head injury severities separately, we assessed nonlinear transformations with polynomials for head AIS for prediction of GOSE.In the first model extension, the Core model was extended with other clinical variables (Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics). Core variables were included (\u201cforced\u201d) into the model and clinical predictors were selected based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC; Fig. 1; Fig. 2A). The AIC was used to select the best model fit with the smallest number of parameters: a higher AIC indicates better predictive ability (how much a predictor adds to the model) penalizing for the complexity of the model (as expressed by the degrees of freedom). AIC strikes a balance between identifying predictors and preventing overfitting. In the second phase, the Clinical model was extended with other categories of variables (i.e., variables 2-6 as listed above). The additional predictors were selected based on the AIC for individual factors, and core variables were always included (\u201cforced\u201d) into the model (Fig. 1). The AIC for candidate predictors in examined models was reported graphically.FIG. 2.The Core and Clinical models for prediction of Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) and Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire (RPQ). Black circles indicate selected predictors based on Akaike's Information Criterion. Black triangles indicate pre-specified core predictors. Alcohol, alcohol intoxication; ASA-PS, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status; Cause, cause of injury; GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; ISS, Injury Severity Score Total; Neuropain H, history of migraines/headaches; PreTBI, prior traumatic brain injury; PsychiatricH, psychiatric history; PTA, post-traumatic amnesia; LOC, loss of consciousness.Bootstrap validation with 500 repetitions was used to estimate a uniform shrinkage factor (corrected calibration slope) and optimism in performance. We report model equations for which the regression coefficients of the final models were multiplied by a shrinkage factor and the model intercept was re-estimated. We also report the equations of models that were refitted to a dichotomized GOSE (cutoff GOSE = 8), using the same shrinkage factor. The performance of ordinal logistic regression models was quantified with the concordance index (C), which quantifies the ability of a model to discriminate between patients with different levels of outcome. Overall performance was quantified with partial Nagelkerke R2, which represents the scaled difference in the log-likelihood of a model with and without the prognostic factor(s). The performance of the models was also reported for different cutoffs of the GOSE. The performance of linear regression models was quantified with the proportion of explained variance (R2). For comparison with other studies, we also reported C obtained in logistic regression analysis that modeled the relationship between predictors and a dichotomized RPQ Total score. Performance was calculated across imputed datasets and confidence intervals were estimated using 200 bootstrap samples.To examine calibration of the models for predicting complete (upper-good) recovery (GOSE = 8) and significant post-concussion symptoms (RPQ \u226516) in different European regions, we performed cross-validation with a leave-one-region-out approach: The regions West, North and South-East (Supplementary Table S1) were consecutively left out for model fitting and were then used for model validation. The R-package rms41 (Regression Modeling Strategies) was used for all regression analyses.",
    "PMC10541943": "MethodsAnimalsMale and female C57BL/6J (WT) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Two to five mice of same-sex groups were housed in standard room conditions with 12 h light and dark cycle and allowed to access free food and water ad libitum. The total number of mice used after sham or injured procedures was: 20 mice (15 male; five female) in the rmTBI group and 15 mice (13 male; two female) in the sham group. All animal procedures were approved by the University of Florida's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) by Closed-Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational AccelerationThe rmTBI procedure was followed as suggested by Namjoshi and colleagues 2014; 2.5-3 months old male and female WT mice were subjected to two mild closed-head injuries (0.6 J) at 24 h intervals using Closed-Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration (CHIMERA) impactor. Number and temporal spacing of injuries mimic our previous findings using a closed-head injury model of TBI.12 Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (induction 3-4% and maintenance 1-2.5%). Meloxicam (10 mg/kg body weight) was administered subcutaneously for 2 days prior to impact procedure to mitigate pain in the test animals. Animals were positioned supine in the holding bed of the impactor. After impact, animals were transferred immediately to the recovery chamber until fully ambulatory. Sham mice were exposed to all these procedures, except for the impact. At 7 days post-injury (dpi), transcardial perfusions were performed with sterile ice-cold 0.9 % saline and the brain tissues were harvested. One hemi-brain was micro-dissected and stored for further analysis. The remaining hemi-brain was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for further histological analysis.T2 and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquisitionAnatomical T2-weighted, diffusion weighted and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) scans were collected between 5-7 dpi for rsfMRI and DTI analyses. Sham and rmTBI mice were anesthetized with a mixture of isoflurane (induction 4%, maintenance: 1%) and medical grade air (70% N2 and 30% O2) and positioned prone on a custom-built holder with a radiofrequency (RF) coil was placed atop the head. Images were acquired using an 11.1T MRI scanner (Magnex Scientific Ltd, Oxford, UK) with high power gradient sets (RRI BFG-240/120-S7; maximum gradient strength of 1000 mT/m at 325 Amps and a 200 msec rise time; RRI, Billerica, MA). A custom-made 2.0 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm quadrature RF surface transmit/receive coil tuned to 470.7 MHz (1 H resonance) was used for B1 excitation and signal detection (RF engineering lab; Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy Facility, Gainesville, FL).For rsfMRI study, a T2- weighted Turbo Rapid Acquisition with Refocused Echoes (TurboRARE) sequence was acquired with the following parameters: effective echo time (TE) = 41.42 msec, repetition time (TR) = 4 sec, RARE factor = 16, number of averages = 12, the field of view of 15 mm \u00d7 15 mm and 0.9 mm thick slice, and a data matrix of 256 \u00d7 256 with 14 interleaved ascending coronal slices. Resting-state images were collected using a single-shot spin-echo echo planar imaging (SE-EPI) sequence with the following parameters: TE = 15 msec, TR = 2 sec, 600 repetitions, and a data matrix of 64 \u00d7 48 with 14 interleaved ascending coronal slices in the same space as the T2 anatomical. Two additional single repetition SE-EPI scans were collected, one with phase encode gradient lobes (\u201cPE blips\u201d) collected along the positive gradient direction and the other collected with PE blips reversed to the negative PE direction (Bruker Paravision binary method for distortion correction is kindly provided by Dr. Matthew Budde, Medical College of Wisconsin).For DTI images, 4-shot, 2-shell spin echo planar diffusion imaging sequence in Bruker Paravision, with TR = 4 sec, TE = 19 msec, number of averages = 4, gradient duration \u03b4 = 3 msec, diffusion time \u0394 = 8 msec, 54 images with three different diffusion weightings, two b = 0, 6 directions with b = 600 sec/mm2, and 46 directions with b = 2000 sec/mm2. Image saturation bands were placed on either side and below the brain to suppress non-brain signal during image acquisition. A navigator signal was used by the Bruker reconstruction software to improve signal stability in the 4-shot EPI. Diffusion images had the same field of view (FOV) and slice thickness as the anatomical scan but with a lower resolution data matrix size of 128 \u00d7 96 and 17 slices (resolution: 0.117 mm \u00d7 0.117 mm \u00d7 0.7 mm) in the same space as anatomical scans.rsfMRI and DTI image pre-processing and analysisFunctional connectivity of rmTBI mice brain was analyzed by graph theoretical analysis.13 SE-EPI distortions were corrected using TOPUP in FSL.14 The pair of opposite phase-encode blip scans were used to estimate the susceptibility-induced off-resonance field, which is used to unwarp subsequent EPI volumes.14 Image pre-processing and analysis was carried via in-house UNIX terminal using Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI),15 FMRIB Software Library (FSL)16-18 and Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs).19,20 Anatomical and distortion-corrected functional scan masks outlining mouse brain boundaries were generated in MATLAB using Three-Dimensional Pulsed Coupled Neural Networks (PCNN3D).21 3dDespike in AFNI was used to remove time series spikes and 3dvolreg for image volume alignment. Preprocessed scans were cropped and a high-pass temporal filter (< 0.009Hz) was used (3dTproject) to remove slow variations (temporal drift) in the fMRI signal. Independent component analysis decomposition was then applied using Multivariate Exploratory Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components (FSL MELODIC version 3.0) to preprocessed scans to assess noise components in each subjects' native space prior to spatial smoothing and registration. Noise-related signal along brain edges, in ventricular voxels, and large vessel regions were suppressed using a soft (\u201cnon-aggressive\u201d) regression approach using fsl_regfilt.16 A low-pass filter (> 0.12 Hz) and spatial smoothing (0.4 mm full width at half maximum [FWHM]) were then applied to the fMRI scans.Preprocessed anatomical and fMRI scans were aligned to a parcellated mouse common coordinate framework (version 3, or CCFv3) template.22 Bilateral region of interest (ROI)-based nodes (64 total) were created with the guidance of the annotated CCFv3 parcellation and using tools in ITKSNAP and FSL. In ITKSNAP, the template with overlaid parcellation was used to find the left hemisphere voxel coordinates for each of the nodes included in this study, which were distributed as evenly as possibly without overlap across the mouse brain template. The node coordinates were positioned in subregions of all areas for example the optic tract and thalamus. We created 0.6 mm diameter spherical nodes (resolution: 0.05 mm3) centered on the voxel coordinates. The right hemispheric representations of the same nodes were then created to complete left and right representations for each node. For subject-to-atlas registration, fMRI scans are up-sampled from a native space 0.234 \u00d7 0.3125 \u00d7 0.9 mm resolution (spatially smoothed at 0.4 mm FWHM) to a down-sampled template resolution of 0.1 mm3.Anatomical scans were cropped and N4 bias field correction23 applied to T2 images to correct intensity variations due to RF field inhomogeneities.24 The extracted brain maps were linearly registered to the mouse template using FSL linear registration tool (FLIRT).16 The linear registration output was then nonlinearly warped to the template space using ANTs (antsIntroduction.sh script). Anatomical-to-atlas linear and nonlinear transformation matrices were applied to fMRI scans at a later stage. Brain extraction using a mask was first applied to fMRI scans and the cropped scans were then aligned to their respective higher resolution anatomical scans. Timeseries functional images were split into 600 individual volumes and the first in the series was linearly aligned to the anatomical scan using FLIRT (same parameters as above, except 6 degrees of freedom was used in this step). ANTs (antsRegistrationSyNQuick.sh script) was used to warp the lower resolution functional images to their structural (using a single stage step deformable b-spline syn with a 26-step b-spline distance). Linear and nonlinear warping matrices for fMRI-to-anatomical alignment were applied to individual scans in the time series, then the merged 4-D functional timeseries were moved to the atlas space using the prior anatomical-to-template transformation matrices.A total of 64 ROI masks, divided into 32 left and 32 right ROIs, were included in our analyses. Center voxel coordinates were used for 3D network visualizations in BrainNet viewer in MATLAB.25 Signal timeseries were extracted resulting in 64 individual ROI text files per subject with L2-normalized resting state signals as a vector of 600 data points. The timeseries files were used in cross-correlations and in calculations of Pearson r coefficients for every pairwise combinations of ROIs (1dCorrelate in AFNI). The resulting number of pairwise correlations was 1952 per subject (after removing 64 self-correlations). Correlation coefficients were imported to MATLAB and Fisher's transform applied to ensure a normal distribution of z values prior to analyses.Diffusion MRI scans were processed as previously described using tools FMRIB software library FSL.26,27 Tensor element reconstruction and estimates was performed using weighted least squares regression on DTIFIT in FSL.28 Regions of interest were manually selected in ITK-SNAP to estimate their mean intensity and volumes. These included thalamus, optic tract, fimbria, corpus callosum, hippocampus, and amygdala.Functional network analysisFunctional network analysis was completed as previously reported.29 Briefly, the Brain Connectivity Toolbox30 and MATLAB were used to determine weighted matrices. Edge densities thresholds were set in a range from 2 to 40% to calculate the following global network metrics: Clustering Coefficient (tendency of nodes to cluster and connect within the network), Characteristic Path Length (average of shortest path length between all pairs of nodes in the network), Transitivity (probability of neighboring nodes to be interconnected within the network), Global Efficiency (efficiency to communicate across distant brain regions), Louvain Modularity (density of connections within a neural cluster), and Small World Index (high local clustering with shortest path length). Unless otherwise indicated in the figures, a 10% threshold was used for all the node-specific measures.13,29ImmunohistochemistryFormalin-fixed, Paraffin-embedded coronal brain sections (5 \u03bcm) were used for the immunohistochemistry (IHC) study. Both sham and rmTBI slides were processed simultaneously. The slides were deparaffinized in xylene twice for 5 min each and rehydrated sequentially in the gradient of ethanol followed by water for 3 min each. The antigen retrieval was performed by immersing slides in 10 mM citrate with 0.5% Tween 20 (pH 6.0) and 30 min incubation in the steamer. The endogenous peroxidases were removed by incubating the slides with the mixture of 0.3% H2O2/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 10% Triton X-100 (100 \u03bcL for 200 mL of 0.3% H2O2 solution) for 20 min. Blocking was performed with 10% normal goat serum/phosphate-buffered saline with Tween (PBS-T; 0.05% Tween) for 30 min at room temperature (RT). After blocking, the brain sections were incubated overnight with the following antibodies: Iba1 (1:1000, PA5-27436, Invitrogen) and GFAP (GA5; 1:1000, 3670S, Cell Signaling) at 4\u00b0C for microglia and astrocytes, respectively. After incubation, the slides were washed with PBS-T and incubated for 30 min with corresponding biotinylated secondary antibody (Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG Antibody [H+L], Biotinylated-[BA-1000]; Goat Anti-Mouse IgG Antibody, Biotinylated, R.T.U. BP-9200; Vector Laboratories).Further, the sections were incubated with avidin-biotin complex (ABC) reagent for 20 min (VECTASTAIN Elite ABC-HRP Kit, Peroxidase Standard), PK-6100) following washes with PBS-T and developing with 3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) kit (KPL DAB Reagent Set, SeraCare cat no. #5510-0031). The slides were then washed twice in PBS, 5 min each, and counter-stained with hematoxylin for 1-2 min. The slides were washed briefly in water and dehydrated with the gradient of alcohol (70% ethanol, 90% ethanol, and 100% ethanol) for 3 min each and incubated in xylene twice for 5 min each. The sections were mounted with Cytoseal Mountant 60 (Epredia 83104) and air dried. The slides were scanned using an Aperio image scanner (20 \u00d7 objective lens, Scan Scope\u2122 XT, Aperio Technologies, Inc. Vista, CA) and quantified using Image Scope software (v12.4.3.5008) positive pixel count program. Three sections per mouse at 55 \u03bcm apart were averaged to calculate the expression of Iba1 and GFAP.Spatial proteomics analysis using the NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Protein profiling (DSP) platformFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded brain tissues were sectioned on the coronal plane at 5 \u03bcm thickness. DSP staining and assay procedures were conducted according to the manufacturer-directed protocol. Nuclei were fluorescently labeled with SYTO 13 (GeoMx Nuclear Stain Morphology kit, Item no. 121300303, Nanostring, Seattle, WA), and microglia cells were labeled with an Iba1 (GeoMx Alzheimer's Morphology Kit, Item no. 121300306, NanoString, Seattle, WA) antibody. The regions of interest (ROIs) were selected based on visual identification of anatomic regions using SYTO 13, aided by Iba1 expression. The following ROIs were selected: primary somatic sensory area, dentate gyrus polymorph layer, thalamus, and the optic tract. The following protein cores and modules were used for multiplexed protein quantification: Neural Cell Profiling (Item no. 121300120), Parkinson's disease pathology (Item no. 121300122), Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (Item no. 121300121), AD pathology extended (Item no. 121300123), Glial cell subtyping (Item no. 121300125), and autophagy (Item no. 121300124) markers. Samples were processed on the NanoString GeoMx system and the nCounter max system following manufacturer's instructions. Data were analyzed using GeoMx DSP analysis suit Version 2.4.0.421 as suggested by manufacturer instructions. Briefly, the Field of view registered-quality control (FOV-QC) was adjusted to 45% to check the low count score. All the QC passed segments were normalized to housekeepers such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and histone H3. Background corrections were performed with the negative background targets. Background corrected files were changed to tab-delimited files, and custom scripts with slight modifications were used to generate volcano plots.Statistical analysisGraphPad Prism 9 software was used to perform all the statistical analysis. Mann-Whitney test followed up with FDR-Benjamini Hochberg correction (q = 5%) to determine significant differences in nodal properties between control and injured mice. Grubbs' test was performed (Alpha = 0.05). Outliers, data beyond the outlier boundary with mean \u00b1 1.5 standard deviations, were removed from global, regional, and efficiency analyses data sets. Repeated measures two-way analysis of variance was performed to measure the global differences and differences between density thresholds in rsfMRI data. An unpaired t-test was performed within the GeoMx DSP analysis suit to analyze the NanoString GeoMx Spatial Profiling data. Uncorrected P-values and effect size are reported using methods previously described for functional connectivity network visualizations.29 All the results were represented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation; p < 0.05 is considered statistically significant.",
    "PMC10541940": "MethodsSelection of studiesWe selected studies underlying the CDC Guideline,33 which were identified through a systematic review.34 We collected the articles identified for four of the six clinical questions from the systematic review (Questions 1, 4, 5, and 6 on the topics of diagnosis, short-term prognosis [within 1 year of injury], longer-term prognosis [beyond 1 year post-injury], and treatment/rehabilitation, respectively). Our focus was on diagnosis and management; thus, we did not examine the studies relevant to the two clinical questions that addressed neuroimaging. A total of 38 studies were identified; one study was excluded because it was a conference presentation, resulting in a final sample of 37 published studies.39\u201375Data extractionWe developed a coding sheet to identify SDoH and associated subcategories derived from both the Healthy People 20205 and Healthy People 20304 websites. Each of these websites lists the same five SDoH domains: Economic Stability, Education Assess and Quality, Health Care Access and Quality, Neighborhood and Built Environment, and Social and Community Context. Healthy People 2020 provided a bulleted list of these five domains, with several key issues and underlying factors within each domain. For example, a key issue listed under Economic Stability is \u201cpoverty.\u201d We included each of the key issues and underlying factors as separate variables to code. We then cross-referenced this list with the information on Healthy People 2030, which provides a separate webpage for each SDoH domain, with an \u201cOverview and Objectives\u201d section that presents brief text descriptions. Three authors (NEC, AKK, BCL) read each text description and extracted any additional key issues or underlying factors that were not included in the Healthy People 2020 bulleted list. For example, in the Health Care Access and Quality domain, health and/or dental insurance was listed in Healthy People 2030, but it was not on the Healthy People 2020 list; therefore, it was added to the coding sheet.The coding sheet also included summary information about the study sample including the sample size, average age, age range, as well as the gender, racial, and ethnic composition of the sample (coders collected the exact sample details or identified that the information was \u201cNot Reported\u201d by the study authors). The coding sheet also included study design, whether studies included exclusionary criteria based on demographic, sociocultural, or health factors, and whether studies mentioned future directions/research needs regarding social determinants or health equity. Lastly, we added summary variables to characterize whether, or the extent to which, each study analyzed or provided information about the following five key health equity variables: race, ethnicity, culture/acculturation, SES, and language. Coders could indicate whether the study: 1) provided no mention of the variable; 2) included the variable as a demographic category only; or 3) examined the variable in depth (e.g., the health equity variable was a primary variable of interest in the study or outcome/prognostic results were stratified and reported across levels of the variable). The study coding sheet is included in the online supplemental materials.After the coding sheet was developed, four authors (NEC, AKK, BCL, IAI) reviewed the 37 articles. Five studies were assigned to all four raters as training articles and the raters met as a group to discuss and calibrate ratings. The remaining 32 articles were assigned to two raters each. Authors performed a content analysis independently by extracting details for each study and completing the coding sheet described above. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Lastly, two authors (NEC and AKK) independently determined whether articles addressed SDoH by examining the variables in an inferential or intentional way (e.g., the SDoH variable represented a primary focus or emphasis of the study, or the SDoH variable served as a primary predictor of outcome), or in a descriptive or demographic way (e.g., the SDoH variable was summarized as a demographic variable only, mentioned in the discussion section as an area of future study, or utilized as a design feature of the study such as might pertain to recruitment, inclusion/exclusion criteria).Data analysis and synthesisThe percentages of studies that were identified as including each of the five SDoH domains and each of the five key health equity variables were calculated and summarized descriptively. No statistical significance testing or quantitative synthesis/meta-analytic techniques were used.",

    "PMC10722895": "MethodsParticipantsThis study was reviewed and approved by the local Institutional Review Boards of Northwell Health and participating institutions. This study was listed on clincaltrials.gov #NCT02731027. Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals, or their proxies, before study enrollment. Participants were recruited from 2016-2020 at Level One Trauma Centers associated with: Northwell Health, The Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation, University of Louisville, Thomas Jefferson University, University of British Columbia, and the Ohio State University Medical Center. All samples included in this analysis were collected prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. For inclusion in the control group (CTL), individuals without SCI were: (1) >18 years of age, (2) without current or history of cancer, (3) without a history of SCI, autoimmune or neurodegenerative diseases, and (4) were similar in age range and sex distribution as the participants with SCI. Inclusion criteria for participants with SCI were: (1) > 18 years of age, (2) initial SCI 0-3 days prior, (3) classified with an American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade of A to D, and (4) neurological injury level of cervical (C)4-thoracic (T)10. The presence of a SCI was determined by clinical and radiographic presentation. Neurological level of injury (NLI) and severity of injury were classified according to the International Standards for Neurologic Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI), resulting in the AIS of A, B, C or D. AIS A indicates motor and sensory function below the NLI is absent (motor complete), AIS B indicates some sensory, but not motor, function below the NLI is present (motor complete), AIS C and D indicate motor function is partially preserved below the NLI (motor and sensory incomplete), with greater motor function preserved in AIS D as compared to AIS C(36). Patients with active infections at the time of a study visit were asked to reschedule it as soon as possible and/or to complete any remaining study visits when their infections had resolved.For this report, samples from individuals with acute motor complete injuries (AIS A or B, N = 6) were analyzed as a group and compared to samples from individuals with acute motor incomplete injuries (AIS C or D, N = 6). While individuals with AIS B injuries have better physical and psychosocial health outcomes than individuals with AIS A injuries at 12 MPI(37), here we included the single individual with an acute AIS B injury in the motor complete group because their biochemical profile clustered with the other samples from individuals with motor complete (AIS A) injuries. Potential participants were excluded if there was documented medical history of cancer, autoimmune disease, other neurologic disease, or for any reason that a physician felt their participation was contraindicated. The data presented here are from the first 12 participants with SCI who had blood samples collected at a minimum of three study visits, including the acute sample.Blood samples from participants with SCI were scheduled for collection at study visits 0-3 days post injury (DPI, \u201cacute\u201d), and again at 3 MPI, 6 MPI, and 12 MPI. For participants without SCI (CTL), blood samples were obtained once. Due to logistical challenges and medical events, not all blood samples were available for analysis by all three biological outcomes presented here. If an individual had an active infection or pressure injury at the time of a study visit, no blood sample was drawn at that time. The number of participants with SCI included in each analysis were: RNA-sequencing (N = 10), ELISA (N = 12), and flow cytometry (N = 7, only from Northwell Health participants). CTLs were recruited at Northwell Health and their samples were used for RNA-sequencing (N = 9) or flow cytometry (N = 12) analyses.RNA-sequencingWhole blood was collected in PAXgene tubes (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) and stored at -80C until analysis. Total RNA was isolated by QIAcube, using the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands). RNA quality was determined on the Agilent Bioanalyzer, mRNA-Seq libraries were prepared (Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with RiboZero Globin (Catalog #20020612) and 100 bp paired-end reads were collected on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Northwell Health). Using Partek Genomics Flow software (St. Louis, MO, USA), trimmed reads were aligned using STAR to the human genome (hg38 genome assembly), filtered for expression >50, normalized using the Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) method using the edgeR package embedded in Partek Genomics, and log2 transformed. Differential expression of transcripts was determined by one way ANOVA with a fold change greater than 1.5, using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg FDR <0.05 or <0.001, as indicated (Partek Genomics Flow). For functional analysis of differentially expressed (DE) genes, if multiple transcripts for the same gene symbol were DE, then the transcript with the lowest p-value for that gene symbol was included for further analyses. Venn diagrams were created in Venny to determine distinct or shared genes by study visit(38). Functional analysis of DE genes was performed using the bioinformatics platform Enrichr(39). Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed using default parameters (Partek Genomics Flow) for the determination of the component number.Flow cytometryPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified from fresh whole blood using Ficoll Paque Plus (GE Healthcare) and the manufacturer's standard protocol. PBMCs were labeled with fluorescently labeled multicolor antibody panels (Supplementary Table S1) and then fixed with 4% PFA. One-two million cells were stained in each antibody cocktail and approximately 150,000 total events were collected using a BD LSRII Flow Cytometer. Analysis was performed using FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC). Cells were first gated as leukocytes using forward (FSC) versus side scatter (SSC), and then the singlet population was selected. Cell types and activation states were defined by standard gating strategies (Supplementary Fig. S1).Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for protein profilingCytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were measured in plasma samples from participants with SCI using commercially available single analyte ELISAs and multiplex bead-based assays. Single analyte ELISAs were used to measure C Reactive Protein (CRP, IBL International #EU59131), and High Mobility Group Box 1 protein (HMGB1, IBL International # ST51011), according to manufacturers' recommended protocols. ELISA data were collected on a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices) and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9. A multiplex assay (Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine Screening Panel, 48-plex, #12007283) was used to measure an additional 48 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Assays were performed according to manufacturers' recommended protocols. Data was collected on a Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using Bio-Plex manager software. Plasma samples were assayed in duplicate. Assay ranges were essentially as specified by the manufacturers. Kit controls were within expected concentration ranges, %CV across all samples and all analytes were 7.3%, with an average recovery of 100% and a range of 70-130%. For statistical analysis, measurements below the limit of detection were assigned a value of half the lowest detectable value (LLOQ). Analytes (N = 34/50) that were detectable in >50% of the samples were compared between samples from participants with SCI (motor complete vs. incomplete injuries).",

    "PMC10294565": "MethodsIn this narrative review, authors performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed and as a group, arrived at a cohesive description and set of recommendations for diagnosing and treating post-TBI GHD. As part of this review, authors investigated reported prevalence rates of post-TBI PTHP and GHD. Search terms used were \u201cTBI\u201d or \u201ctraumatic brain injury\u201d and \u201cGHD\u201d or \u201cgrowth hormone deficiency\u201d or \u201cPTHP\u201d or \u201cpost traumatic hypopituitarism.\u201d (This review was not intended as a meta-analysis, as there is a lack of sufficient literature to power such an analysis.)Studies included in the analysis of PTHP prevalence rates were those that reported only anterior pituitary deficiencies in pediatric and adolescent patients in the chronic phase after TBI. Studies that reported non-anterior pituitary deficiencies, including diabetes insipidus, were excluded. If possible, for studies that reported both anterior and non-anterior pituitary deficiencies, prevalence rates for anterior pituitary deficiencies were extracted and reported here. GHD was required to be diagnosed using a stimulation test, adhering to the cutoff value of <10 \u03bcg/L suggested in the Growth Hormone (GH) Research Society guidelines published in 2000.9 For studies that reported GHD prevalence rates based on more or less stringent thresholds, these guidelines were retroactively applied and the resulting prevalence rates are reported.Studies included in the analysis of GHD prevalence rates were those that reported rates of GHD in pediatric and adolescent patients in the chronic phase post-TBI. As above, reports of GHD were limited to those that were diagnosed using a stimulation test and that adhered to the cutoff value of <10 \u03bcg/L suggested in the GH Research Society guidelines published in 2000.9 For studies that reported GHD prevalence rates based on more or less stringent thresholds, these guidelines were retroactively applied and the resulting prevalence rates are reported.The results of these analyses are presented in Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Table S2. Although there was insufficient literature to power a meta-analysis, these analyses are nonetheless beneficial for the understanding of PTHP and GHD following TBI in pediatric and adolescent patient populations.TBI events in children and adolescentsIn recent years, TBI has been increasingly recognized as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children and adolescents.10,11 A TBI is defined as a change in brain function or pathology as a result of an external force.12 It is accompanied by impairments in neurologic function (e.g., alterations in balance, weakness, altered vision) or mental disturbances (e.g., confusion, disorientation).13 TBI may also be accompanied by a number of additional sequelae, including loss of consciousness, neuroinflammation, epilepsy/seizures, hydrocephalus, brain swelling, headache, olfactory dysfunction, motor disturbances, cognitive deficits, attention and memory difficulties, sleep problems, and endocrine changes.6,8,13\u201323One meta-analysis estimated that the occurrence of TBI is approximately 110 per 100,000 in pediatric populations (< 15 years of age) and 618 per 100,000 in adolescent and adult populations.24 In older adults and young children, TBI is most frequently caused by falls, while in young adults, TBI is most frequently caused by motor vehicle accidents.25 Other increasingly reported causes of TBI in young adults include domestic abuse or violence and sports injuries.25,26 The rate of TBI may be up to twice as common in males, although it is difficult to estimate the precise incidence in any given population due to underreporting of mild and moderate injuries.24,27Altered brain function can stem from head injuries of any severity, ranging from concussion and mild TBI to severe TBI. Concussion is largely a clinical diagnosis, relying on balance testing and neuropsychological evaluations to indicate cognitive deficits.12 The severity of TBI is typically classified using the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), which assesses performance in three domains: eye, motor, and verbal. Individual scores from each domain are added together for an overall GCS score.13 Scores between 3 and 8 indicate severe TBI, while scores of 9 to 12 and 13 to 15 indicate moderate and mild TBI, respectively (Table 1).25 While the GCS system is useful for the initial evaluation and stratification of patients with TBI, the system is limited by its high inter-rater score variability, can be confounded by sedation or intubation in a hospital setting, may be unreliable in patients between 9 and 12 years of age, and does not accurately reflect pathological or anatomical differences in TBI.13,28,29 Scores are especially variable in young children, at least in part due to difficulties assessing the verbal score component29; therefore, a pediatric GCS assessment incorporating age-appropriate modifications has also been developed.28,30 Some studies suggest that the GCS motor subscore may perform similarly to, if not better than, the full GCS when predicting severe head trauma in adults; however, this requires additional investigation and validation in pediatric populations.28,31,32Table 1.Measurements of TBI SeverityMeasurement systemMild TBIModerate TBISevere TBIGCS13-159-123-8Amnesia\u2264 24 h> 24 h to <7 days\u2265 7 daysLoss of consciousness0-30 min> 30 min to <24 h\u2265 24 hTBI, traumatic brain injury; GCS, Glasgow Coma Score.An alternative to the GCS is the Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) score, which includes four components: eye, motor, brain stem, and respiratory scores. The advantages of the FOUR score over the GCS system are that it has been adapted for the pediatric population and has been shown to have good inter-reporter variability when evaluating pediatric trauma severity.33 The FOUR score may hold an advantage over the GCS in subcategorizing patients with low GCS scores and in evaluating patients in intensive care unit (ICU) settings, although these observations are based on limited clinical data; therefore, additional studies are needed.34 Other informative clinical measures of severity include duration of post-traumatic amnesia and witnessed loss of consciousness (Table 1).29,35,36 Of note, the endocrinopathies addressed here can occur after any degree of concussion/TBI.The time after a TBI event is typically stratified into the acute and chronic phases. The acute phase is defined as the 2 to 4 weeks following the injury.25,27,37 Acute TBI may be associated with symptoms including irritability, headache, dizziness, loss of consciousness, olfactory dysfunction, amnesia, confusion, and seizures.13,16,17,21,23 Adrenal insufficiency may occur in the acute phase and has been reported in 2 to 43% of children with TBI.27 Adrenal disturbances may be characterized by hypoglycemia, fatigue, confusion, hypotension, and hyponatremia.11,25 Deficiencies in the adrenal axis should be addressed and treated immediately during the acute phase, as these deficiencies can be life-threatening and may also correlate with neurological dysfunction.11,25,27,38 DI, which, when it occurs, almost always presents in the acute phase, is uncommon in children who have experienced TBI.10 When DI does occur, it is rarely permanent but should be addressed immediately.7,8 Evaluation of TSH and free T4 for identification of TSH deficiency during the acute phase can result in unreliable readings, as thyroid hormone concentrations can change during stress, illness, and hospitalization.19,39,40 Therefore, it is not recommended that thyroid function be evaluated until at least 3 months post-TBI.41Deficiencies in other anterior pituitary hormones, including gonadotropins and GH, may present during the acute phase; however, the relevance of these deficiencies in the acute phase is unclear and testing is often deferred until at least 3 to 6 months post-TBI.25,27 The presence or lack of pituitary deficiencies in the acute phase does not reliably predict the development of hypopituitarism in the chronic phase; even testing for acute adrenal insufficiency, the one recommended pituitary test in the acute period, does not predict chronic adrenal insufficiency in either adults42-44 or children.45 This is because deficits identified within the first year following the TBI event may be transient and recover over time.25 As the focus of this article is GHD in the chronic phase post-TBI, the acute phase will not be discussed further. Diagnosis and treatment of additional pituitary hormone deficiencies in the chronic phase will be discussed in later sections.There is no clear threshold delineating the end of the acute phase and the beginning of the chronic phase. However, it is suggested that by 3 months post-TBI, a patient has entered the chronic phase, during which a wide range of physical, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes can occur.25,27 Physical symptoms associated with TBI in the chronic phase include fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea, and sleep pattern alterations.11,13,21,23 Less commonly, TBI may be associated with alterations in or loss of vision, hearing, or smell21; olfactory dysfunction may be correlated with the severity of TBI.15 Patients who have experienced a TBI event may be at increased risk of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and may experience personality changes, including increased irritability, impulsivity, and apathy.13,19,21,46 Importantly, mental and physical symptoms of depression, TBI, and PTSD may overlap, complicating the diagnosis.36,46 Patients may also experience word-finding difficulties, attention and memory disturbances, social isolation, increased instances of being bullied, and reduced academic performance.13,17,47-49There is considerable debate around the effect of age on TBI outcomes. For example, children display increased levels of neuronal plasticity, which could aid in a more rapid and robust recovery following TBI.7,45 Conversely, TBIs that occur during specific times in a child's life, particularly during critical times of cognitive and neuronal development and during physical and sexual maturation, may therefore have a greater impact on post-TBI outcomes.17,50Post-TBI hypopituitarism in children and adolescentsA subset of patients with TBI will experience PTHP, defined as a deficiency in one or more pituitary hormones following a traumatic event to the brain.37 Severe TBI seems to correlate with the highest risk of PTHP11,37,51; however, PTHP can occur with any severity of TBI or even with repetitive concussions.52\u201356Several mechanisms play a role in the pathophysiology of PTHP. Shearing and compression forces, which occur during the TBI event, can lead to pituitary tissue necrosis, reducing pituitary hormone production and secretion.27 Stalk torsion or displacement caused by TBI can lead to disruption of blood flow to the pituitary gland.11,27 TBI-induced edema, hemorrhage, or increased intracranial pressure can cause pituitary compression and dysfunction.11,25 Patients with TBI also display increased glutamate excitotoxicity, which can lead to neurocognitive defects, particularly during key developmental periods.6,25,57 Finally, TBI can induce inflammation, ischemia, oxidative stress, and cytotoxicity in the nervous system. These factors may accelerate necrosis of neuronal cells and can increase blood\u2013brain barrier permeability, resulting in increased pituitary antigen exposure and the potential development of autoantibodies and hypophysitis.6,14,25,27,37,58As part of this review, a retrospective analysis was performed on studies that reported PTHP prevalence rates in children and adolescents post-TBI. This analysis revealed that PTHP may be present in 10 to 58% of pediatric and adolescent patients at any time during the chronic phase of TBI (Supplementary Table S1).26,45,59\u201366 Studies selected for inclusion in this analysis were those that reported on anterior pituitary deficiencies during the chronic phase. Reports of GHD were restricted to those diagnosed using a stimulation test and a threshold value GH <10 \u03bcg/L.9 When studies reported on both anterior and non-anterior pituitary deficiencies, prevalence rates for pituitary deficiencies of interest were extracted from a larger data set if possible (detailed in Supplementary Table S1). The large range of PTHP prevalance rates reported here is likely indicative of differences in study design, variability and low reproducibility of testing methods, timing of pituitary axis measurements, and injury severity.7Age and sex of study participants may also contribute to variations in reported PTHP prevalence rates. One study suggested that the highest rates of pituitary hormone deficiencies in children occur between 7 and 11 years of age.10 While overall rates of PTHP seem to be similar in males and females,19 sex-specific diagnoses may vary based on the specific hormone being investigated. For example, males appear to present with increased rates of GHD relative to females.46 Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings; however, this discrepancy may reflect the increased referral, evaluation, and treatment of boys for growth deceleration and short stature compared with girls.46,67 While reports of endocrine dysfunction in adults after TBI typically favor isolated pituitary abnormalities, reports in children favor multiple pituitary deficiencies. This may reflect selection bias (multiple deficiences often correlate with a more severe presentation and increased reporting) and varying diagnostic and referral practices between adult and pediatric populations.64 In general, adults and children tend to present with comparable overall rates of pituitary deficiencies, and in both populations, GH is the most common pituitary hormone affected.22Based on evaluation of existing reports, between 9.1% and 47.8% of children and adolescents with TBI may develop GHD (Supplementary Table S2).26,45,60-63,65-67 As in Supplementary Table S1, reports of GHD in Supplementary Table S2 were restricted to those diagnosed using a stimulation test and a threshold value GH <10 \u03bcg/L.9 For studies that reported GHD prevalence rates based on different criteria, these guidelines were retroactively applied, where possible (for more details, see Supplementary Table S2). Similar to the reports on PTHP already noted, this broad range is likely due to differences in the timing and methodology of GHD testing. Clinical consequences of GHD may include reduced adult height, decreased lean body mass and muscle strength, reduced metabolic rate, increased abdominal fat, decreased quality of life (QOL), cognitive issues, and memory and attention deficits.25,68\u201371 There is evidence to suggest that TBI with GHD confers worse risk for cognitive issues (e.g., poorer verbal learning, verbal short-term memory, and attention) than does TBI without GHD.11,25,37 Additional anterior pituitary abnormalities observed in children and adolescents in the chronic phase post-TBI may include ACTH deficiency (reported at 2-43%), gonadotropin deficiency (reported at 6-16%), TSH deficiency (reported at 2-33%), and precocious puberty (reported at 2-16%).7,11,27Testing for GHD in pediatric and adolescent patients with TBIConsensus guidelines published in 2005 recommend that adults with moderate to severe TBI undergo endocrine screening.72 However, there are currently no screening guidelines specific to children or adolescents for investigating endocrine dysfunction after a TBI.10In adults, GHD is diagnosed based on biochemical assessment of the GH axis using well-defined thresholds. In children, GHD can be strongly indicated based on insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations, height velocity, or other auxologic features, but is often confirmed with biochemical testing.8,65,73,74 Changes in growth are not universally observed in these patients.7,63 Given that GHD can be transient and that secretory patterns may change over time, children should undergo routine GH testing (e.g., every 6 months) for at least 1 year post-TBI.7,11,27 While some GH stimulation tests have been applied to younger populations (detailed below), sensitive and specific cut points for the biochemical detection of GHD in children are currently debated, and results of these tests should be interpreted with caution.75 GH stimulation tests should be performed only after treatments for all other pituitary hormone deficiencies have been established, as changes in other pituitary hormones can affect GH axis testing results.76,77The insulin tolerance, growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) + arginine, GHRH + growth hormone-releasing peptide 6 (GHRP-6), glucagon, arginine, clonidine, levodopa (l-DOPA), and macimorelin tests have all been used to detect GHD in pediatric and adolescent patients.7,60,65,67,74,78,79 Stimulation test thresholds ranging from <5 to <10 \u03bcg/L have been suggested as indicative of GHD in children,73,80,81 with the current consensus value listed as <10 \u03bcg/L.9The use of several of these tests is limited by safety concerns and availability. The insulin tolerance test (ITT) is used less frequently in the U.S. due to its potential to cause complications of hypoglycemia (especially in patients with undiagnosed adrenal insufficiency) and contraindication in patients with a history of cardiac disease or seizures.23,25,37,76,82 The GHRH + arginine and GHRH + GHRP-6 tests cannot detect GHD of hypothalamic origin and are unavailable in many countries.25,74 In the U.S., recombinant GHRH was removed from the market in July 200811,76 and GHRP-6 was never available. It is important to note that the diagnostic accuracy of stimulation tests may be reduced in patients with glucose intolerance or obesity; body mass index (BMI)-adjusted thresholds have been suggested for some tests, such as the GHRH + arginine test.25,76,83,84 Given the availability, safety, and contraindications for the above-mentioned stimulation tests, the glucagon stimulation test (GST) is now emerging as the preferred GHD diagnostic test for adults.11 The preferred diagnostic test in children is less clear.Macimorelin is an orally administered GH secretagogue receptor agonist that binds the ghrelin receptor, stimulating dose-dependent GH production. Macimorelin was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for diagnosis of adult GHD in December 2017. The original approval listed a cutoff value of 2.8 \u03bcg/L, but a higher cutoff value of 5.1 \u03bcg/L was subsequently demonstrated to increase GHD detection sensitivity.76,85 Thus far, there is no indication that different cutoff values will be required for patients with different BMIs.76 Advantages of the macimorelin test include easy oral dosing and fewer blood draws74; however, macimorelin is a more expensive diagnostic agent than other options.76 Macimorelin is currently being investigated for the diagnosis of GHD in pediatric populations, with initial reports revealing that the compound is both safe and well tolerated.78 Other agents, including LUM-201, are also being evaluated for the diagnosis of GHD in children.86As IGF-I concentrations are partially GH-dependent, serum IGF-I measurements have been used to diagnose GHD. Very low IGF-I concentrations are suggestive of GHD and it has been reported that IGF-I concentrations >0 standard deviation score (SDS) make GHD unlikely at any age.74,87 However, IGF-I concentrations are also influenced by a variety of other factors and should be used as a diagnostic tool with caution, as there is a large overlap in IGF-I production between patients with GHD and those who are GH sufficient, particularly in very young children.3,74,88,89 IGF-I concentrations may be normal in patients who fail provocative GH testing; therefore, serum IGF-I is not always a reliable indicator of GHD.18,45,74,89-91While similar stimulation testing options exist for patients in the pediatric, adolescent, and adult populations, GH secretion varies considerably during childhood and adolescence. Thus, while diagnostic thresholds have been well defined for adult GHD, appropriate thresholds for the diagnosis of GHD in childhood and adolescence are currently debated.92 Previous consensus guidelines suggest that a peak stimulated GH concentration <10 \u03bcg/L indicates the presence of GHD in children. However, this threshold value does not take into account sex, age, BMI, or the specific stimulation test used.9,81,92 Sex steroids induce GH secretion, and children in puberty are less likely to test as GH-deficient compared with prepubertal children.74,93 While the effectiveness of sex steroid priming is still debated, priming may improve the specificity of some GH stimulation tests in prepubertal children74; guidelines published in 2016 suggest the use of priming (with oral \u03b2-estradiol or intramuscular testosterone) in prepubertal boys >11 years of age and prepubertal girls >10 years of age with an expected adult height within -2 standard deviation (SD) of the normative reference population.81Treatment of GHD in pediatric and adolescent patientsPatients with PTHP must have other (non-GH) pituitary hormone deficiencies diagnosed and treated before assessment of possible post-TBI GHD.76 In addition to decreased height velocity, adolescents and young adults with severe GHD report decreased QOL related to physical health and emotions. One study in 16- to 25-year-old participants reported that these outcomes can be detected using a generic QOL questionnaire but not using the disease-specific QoL-AGHDA (Quality of Life-Assessment of Growth Hormone Deficiency in Adults) questionnaire, indicating that the disease-specific questionnaire may not be applicable in adolescents and young adults with GHD.94If the presence of GHD is biochemically confirmed, GH treatment in children and adolescents can improve height outcomes, depression, memory, information processing speed, executive function, and QOL.68,95\u2013100 Treatment with GH can also improve bone mineral density, decrease fat mass, increase lean muscle mass, and improve cardiopulmonary functional capacity.69,71,101 However, GH replacement may also unmask underlying cortisol or thyroid hormone insufficiencies, necessitating close monitoring of the adequacy of glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone replacement following initiation of GH therapy.9,77,81Dosing of GH in pediatric patients is currently recommended at 22 to 35 \u03bcg/kg/day, with subsequent titration to normalize IGF-I concentrations to between 0 and +2 SDS.76,81 Titration should also take into account possible side effects, which can include headaches, arthralgia, edema, and insulin resistance.76,102It is important to consider the timing of GH replacement in children when it is used in conjunction with sex hormone replacement, as this can affect the attainment of adult height. During puberty, increases in circulating GH, IGF-I, and sex hormones lead to accelerated height velocity but also to estrogen-induced epiphyseal fusion.93,103,104 To ensure that adult height is obtained, GH treatment should start as early as possible after the diagnosis of GHD.105 Some studies have suggested that adult height may also be achieved by increasing the GH dose during puberty (to mimic the pubertal increase in GH secretion observed in individuals who are GH sufficient) or by delaying puberty using gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs.103,104,106 It is important to note that oral estrogen-based contraceptives may reduce the effects of GH replacement therapy in women.77,81,107Long-acting GH (LAGH) options have been developed with the aim of improving patient experiences, adherence, and outcomes. These GH products are modified to allow for rapid absorption into and/or delayed removal from the circulation.73,76,108,109 In the U.S., only one such product is currently approved for use in pediatric patients with GHD: once-weekly lonapegsomatropin-tcgd, a transiently PEGylated LAGH option, was approved by the FDA in August 2021 at a recommended dose of 0.24 mg/kg body weight for pediatric patients age \u22651 year who weigh at least 11.5 kg.110 Additional LAGH options have been approved outside of the U.S. for the treatment of pediatric GHD, including somatrogon (Canada, Australia, Japan, and the European Union), somatropin (South Korea), and PEGylated somatropin (China).108,109,111 Finally, somapacitan, a reversible albumin-binding GH analog has been approved for adult GHD in the U.S. (August 2020) and Europe (March 2021) and is currently being studied in pediatric populations.109Patients who have experienced a TBI event should also receive cognitive behavioral therapy and/or counseling to address the effects of anxiety, depression, memory issues, and sleep issues.20,112,113 Speech therapy (for cognitive deficits, including for executive function issues), physical therapy (for vestibular deficits), and exercises to help rehabilitate vision and balance may also be beneficial.20,114Ideally, a multi-disciplinary team of providers will be involved in the management and treatment of patients with TBI, particularly those with GHD (Table 2). Patients who experience a TBI may first present to a primary care physician (PCP) or trauma ICU team, depending on the severity of the injury. PCPs and other physicians caring for patients with TBIs should refer patients to a neurologist to address issues in mental status, memory, cognition, and reflexes; a physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) specialist for diagnosis and treatment of speech, balance, gait, and other post-TBI problems; and a behavioral health specialist to manage behavioral problems and changes.20,115 Providers should also refer individuals with moderate to severe TBI and those with chronic, persistent symptoms to an endocrinologist with experience evaluating and treating pituitary deficiencies such as GHD to address potential TBI-related hormonal deficiencies.11 Endocrinologists should be a part of the care team for any patients with GHD or other pituitary deficiencies.72 The authors also recommend that endocrinologists and other providers seeing patients with hormonal deficiencies obtain a thorough medical history, including questions about TBI history, in order to appropriately evaluate pituitary deficiencies. Having a core multi-disciplinary care team and clear referral pathways is imperative in facilitating the screening of possible endocrinopathies and all phases of the recovery process in patients with TBI and GHD. It may also be beneficial to have one provider serve as the point of contact and care coordinator for patients.Table 2.Specialties and Subspecialties That May Be Involved in the Short-Term and/or Long-Term Care of Patients With TBI and GHDInitial presentationAdditional referral categoriesExamples of providersICU teamPCPEndocrinologyEndocrinologistNeurologyNeurologistNeurosurgeonPM&RPM&R specialistOccupational therapistSpeech therapistPhysical therapistBehavioral healthBehavioral health specialistCognitive rehabilitation specialistPsychotherapistPatients may present to either a PCP or an ICU team, or later to another specialty, depending on the severity of the TBI. PCPs and other providers caring for patients with TBIs should refer patients to several additional specialties depending on injury severity and symptoms: endocrinology (to assess pituitary hormone deficiencies; for most hormonal deficiencies, these referrals should occur in the chronic phase following TBI); neurology (to address issues related to mental status and cognition); PM&R (to assess vision and balance); and behavioral health (to assess cognitive and psychosocial needs). Other providers familiar with TBI may be incorporated into the care team as necessary based on the symptoms of an individual patient. Referrals do not need to stem from the providers caring for the patient during initial presentation. Rather, any provider caring for a patient with TBI should be aware of the complexity of possible symptoms and should refer to appropriate specialties as needed.TBI, traumatic brain injury; GHD, growth hormone deficiency; ICU, intensive care unit; PCP, primary care physician; PM&R, physical medicine and rehabilitation.Assessment and treatment of GHD in the transition phaseThe transition phase is a broadly defined period typically beginning in late puberty and ending in adulthood, approximately 6 to 7 years after the achievement of adult height.26,77 This phase is marked by substantial physical and psychosocial changes including cessation of linear growth, sexual maturation, and cognitive development, and a push for independence. These factors, along with the requirement to manage chronic illnesses and migrate management from pediatric to adult healthcare systems, combine to make the transition period a high-risk time during which many individuals may discontinue treatment and/or be lost to follow-up care.116 Poorly managed transitions have been shown to increase morbidity and mortality76,116 and three national surveys conducted in the U.S. revealed that 60% of patients with specialized healthcare needs and their families do not receive the required support for a successful transition to adult healthcare services.116As endogenous production of GH and IGF-I declines during the transition phase, GH status should be reevaluated at this time.77 Further, pituitary deficiencies post-TBI can develop at a delay: evaluation of pituitary status, especially GH production, may be prompted by new symptoms during the transition phase. Current recommendations suggest retesting patients in the transition phase for GHD using GH stimulation tests when there is clinical suspicion of GHD and when serum IGF-I SDS is <0.76,117 Because most transition-age patients with GHD are asymptomatic, the authors recommend that patients with serum IGF-I SDS \u22650 be followed for evidence of symptoms or body composition changes. Testing is indicated after completion of longitudinal growth and at least 1 month after discontinuation of GH therapy.76,77,102,117 Children who have completed linear growth early may need to be retested for GHD using the pediatric testing options described above. In general, the number of stimulation tests required to confirm GHD in transition-age individuals is dependent on the level of suspicion for GHD.76 Retesting is not required in patients with \u22653 pituitary hormone deficiencies and with low serum IGF-I (< -2.0 SDS), as GHD is likely in these patients.73,76,102 As in initial pituitary hormone analyses, GH stimulation tests should be performed after diagnoses and treatments for all other pituitary hormone deficiencies have been established.76,77Specific tests and cut points for confirming GHD in transition-age patients have not been extensively studied.102 The ITT (GHD threshold \u22645 \u03bcg/L),76,77,88 GST (GHD thresholds <3 \u03bcg/L for normal-BMI patients, and overweight patients with BMIs between 25-30 kg/m2 and a high pretest probability of GHD and <1 \u03bcg/L for obese patients with BMI >30 kg/m2 and overweight patients with BMIs between 25-30 kg/m2 and a low pretest probability of GHD),76 and macimorelin tests (GHD threshold \u22642.8 \u03bcg/L, only approved for patients aged \u226518 years)76 are recommended for diagnosis of GHD in adult patients. However, the ITT is used less frequently due to its contraindications and safety concerns.76 Arginine, clonidine, and l-DOPA have been shown to have low sensitivity in transition-age and adult patients and are therefore not recommended for confirmatory testing during transition.76,118The predictive value of serum IGF-I concentrations alone to detect GHD in the transition phase has proven to be disappointing. One report showed that using the common threshold of IGF-I \u2264 -2 SDS to indicate GHD would have excluded over one-third of transition-age study patients found to have GHD.119 Instead, IGF-I concentration measurements should be used only in conjunction with stimulation tests to determine GHD. Biochemical assay results can also be affected by nutritional and pubertal status; there is no consensus on priming with sex steroids prior to testing for GHD in transition-age patients.75 Although GH provocation tests are considered the mainstay of GHD diagnosis in transition-age patients, issues with variability, reproducibility, and limited evidence for cutoff values in these patients mean that results should be interpreted cautiously.75Besides holding for retesting purposes, it is recommended to continue GH therapy in patients with confirmed GHD during the transition period, even if adult height has been achieved, as treatment is associated with improved body composition, bone health, cognitive function, QOL, and lipid metabolism in adulthood.73,76,92,98,120 Patients who remain GH deficient after reaching adult height can be at risk of adverse metabolic outcomes, increased fat mass and BMI, decreased bone mineralization and mineral density, and decreased QOL if GH therapy is stopped.73,76,82,121-123 The optimal length of time for GH treatment in transition-phase individuals and adults is unclear. In general, if the patient continues to see clinical benefit from the treatment, it may have to be continued throughout adulthood.76 In some situations, the patient's partner, caregiver, or family member may be an important historian of the continued symptomatic benefits of GH treatment, as individuals with TBI and some otherwise healthy adults with GHD may not recognize these treatment benefits themselves.During the transition phase, current guideline recommendations support resuming GH dosing at approximately 50% of the last-used pediatric dose, with adjustments made thereafter to keep IGF-I between 0 and +2 SDS.76,102 Some individuals may require higher GH doses during puberty and young adulthood; however, these doses typically decrease with age and as IGF-I concentrations naturally fall.76 IGF-I should be monitored at least every 6 months77 and the GH dose should be adjusted based on serum IGF-I, clinical response, and any side effects (e.g., headache, hyperglycemia) that may occur.76,102 Current guidelines suggest that patients be monitored annually for blood pressure, body measurements (height, weight, BMI, hip and waist circumference), lipid profiles, and bone mineral density.76 Serum glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and laboratory parameters related to other pituitary hormone deficits should also be monitored.102,117 In their own clinical practice, the authors of this review note that they obtain annual readings of most of the parameters mentioned above but may also obtain additional readings, including liver enzymes, comprehensive metabolic panels, and thyroid function tests. Choice of specific tests ordered may vary based on factors including the final adult height of the patient, length of time since TBI, age, and medical history. A few authors note that they also obtain body composition (in late-stage adolescents) and bone mineral density by DEXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry); however, this can be complicated by cost and availability.Transition phase challengesThere are many challenges to transitioning a pediatric patient with a history of TBI and GHD to adult services. One barrier to adequate care and appropriate referrals to adult endocrinologists is the limited awareness (among both patients and providers) of the need to continue GH treatment in transition-age and adult patients.76,123 Given the misconception that GH is important only for attaining adult height, there is a risk that a patient may discontinue GH treatment while under pediatric care or may stop seeing a pediatric endocrinologist altogether without realizing the importance of adult GH replacement and endocrinology care.82,123 In the experience of these authors, patients with GHD often stop GH treatment for a period of time during the transition phase; however, there are insufficient data to report on the number of patients who are retested and who eventually resume GH treatment. Emerging data continue to show that GH treatment can improve non\u2013height-related parameters such as bone mass, body composition, and QOL, even after adult height has been reached. Therefore, it is crucial that patients with TBI and GHD visit an adult endocrinologist to evaluate and treat GHD in the transition phase.70,76,77,82,117,122A lack of communication and coordination between pediatric and adult healthcare providers can result in inefficient treatment, patients being lost to follow-up as adults, or a large gap between the end of pediatric care and the beginning of adult care.117,123-125 In one study, the median time between the end of GH treatment in pediatric care and first evaluation in adult care was 3.4 years120; as discussed above, this gap in treatment can have negative consequences on metabolism, body composition, and bone density.82Insurance coverage issues can also severely limit a patient's access to appropriate transitional and adult healthcare.116,123,125 The transition phase occurs at a time when many young adults will age out of their parents' health insurance plans, and it is therefore critical for these individuals to obtain adequate coverage. Although only 3.5% of young adults with special healthcare needs were uninsured in 2010, 34.3% did not have adequate coverage to meet their needs.126In general, the more complex a patient's condition is, the greater the negative impact that condition has on the ease of transition.127 The transition phase can be made more complicated by unrecognized and insufficiently treated concomitant deficiencies in pituitary hormones besides GH, as affected patients will need to optimize and continue multiple hormone treatments during the switch from pediatric to adult care. Additionally, patients with cognitive difficulties (such as may stem from the TBI) may be incapable of managing their own care and may require assistance from transition care coordinators, caregivers, and/or family members.To achieve appropriate continuity of care during the transition phase, it is important that providers begin counseling patients and caregivers on transition strategies as early as possible. Ideally, this should be at approximately 11 to 12 years of age or at the time of diagnosis. Generalized programs such as the Ready Steady Go program in the U.K. and the Got Transition initiative in the U.S. have been developed to assess patient readiness and indicate knowledge gaps prior to transition from pediatric to adult care128,129 and may also help to facilitate smooth transition for patients with TBI and GHD. Endocrinology-specific tools have also been developed, including the Endocrine Society readiness questionnaire and the Pediatric Endocrine Society transition toolkit.123 It can be helpful to develop a documented transition plan that details all the steps that need to be taken during the move to adult services.76,127,129 In addition, it has been suggested that adapting modes of communication to those preferred by younger patients (e.g., phone apps and text messaging) may contribute to improved transitions to adult healthcare offices.123It is important that pediatric providers communicate directly with adult providers to facilitate the seamless transition of their patients.76 Direct communication can involve conversations between physicians, transfer of health records, and referrals to adult providers.123 Formal meetings or joint healthcare visits attended by both pediatric and adult providers can also improve continuity during the transition of care.123 As has been shown in other chronic conditions, including diabetes mellitus and cystic fibrosis, dedicated transition clinics staffed by pediatric and adult providers and transition care coordinators can increase communication and make the process more seamless. Unfortunately, these clinics may not be available to all patients for socioeconomic and/or geographic reasons.76,77,125 Regardless of the availability of transition care clinics and coordinators, patients with TBI and GHD should establish care with one provider (typically their PCP or endocrinologist) to act as a single point of contact during their transition to adult services. Notably, a 2019 advisory board suggested that the pediatric endocrinologist should play a central role in the transition of patients with GHD without TBI, including providing access to educational materials and developing a specific plan for the patient's transfer to adult care.123 It seems likely that the pediatric endocrinologist could play a similarly effective role in the transition of care for patients with both TBI and GHD.ConclusionThe occurrence of post-TBI GHD in pediatric, adolescent, and transition-age patients is underappreciated by many healthcare providers and its diagnosis and management has been incompletely studied to date. While multiple GHD diagnostic tests are available to children and young adults, there is a lack of consensus as to sensitive and specific thresholds for indicating GHD in this population. Similarly, well-defined diagnostic thresholds are lacking in the transition phase. Retesting for GHD is critical during this period, as it will inform the possible resumption of GH treatment and subsequent effects on body composition, metabolic status, and QOL. The transition phase is a complex period limited by few formal guidelines, minimal communication between providers, substandard counseling of patients and families, and inadequate insurance coverage. With this review, we aim to increase understanding of the diagnostic and treatment challenges facing patients with TBI and GHD during the transition phase, focus attention on the need for GH therapy beyond attaining adult height, and encourage providers to maintain awareness of the complex, multi-disciplinary needs of these patients.",

Hoke, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine), B6.Cg-Tg(Thy1-YFP)HJrs/J (referred here as YFP-H; RRID:IMSR_JAX:003782) and YFP-H/Sarm1 KO double transgenic mice. Sarm1 KO mice were produced with homozygous breeding and congenic C57BL/6 mice were used as controls (referred here as wild type [wt]). It should be noted that while Sarm1 KO mice have been backcrossed to the C57BL/6 strain, recent analysis revealed that they may have genetic variations in neighboring genes belonging to the original 129 strain.31 However, the specific effect of Sarm1 KO on axon degeneration in vivo has been confirmed by CRISPR/Cas9 editing31 and the expression of dominant negative constructs.32 Mice were subjected to IA-TBI or sham injury (Table 1) as described with slight modifications.12,22,33 Briefly, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of isoflurane, oxygen and nitrous oxide, the cranium was exposed, and a 5 mm-thick stainless-steel disc was glued onto the skull midway between bregma and lambda sutures. Then, a 50 g weight was dropped from 85 cm on the metal disk, while the mouse was placed on a foam mattress (4\u20130 spring constant foam; Foam to Size Inc., Ashland, VA), with the body immobilized with tape. Immediately after injury, the disc was removed and the skull was examined for skull fractures; the rare animals with fractures (< 2%) were excluded. The scalp incision was closed with surgical staples. Sham animals underwent the same procedure without the weight drop component. Neurological recovery was assessed by the presence and duration of apnea or irregular breathing and the revival of the righting reflex. Subjects with apnea/irregular breathing >150 sec and time-to-righting reflex <50 sec or >550 sec were excluded (< 5%). After recovery, animals were returned to their vivarium with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and ad libitum access to food and water. Surgical procedures and injuries were performed under aseptic conditions and all animal handling and postoperative procedures were carried according to protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (Protocol Number: MO19M458).Table 1.Summary of Experimental Groups and Histological ProceduresExperimentMouse cohortsMethodsBlood\u2013brain barrier assessmentYFP-H (n = 6); survival 15 min or 4 h post IA-TBI or sham injury.Tissue clearing and confocal imagingAssessment of acute disconnectionYFP-H and YFP-H/Sarm1 KO (n = 10); survival 24 h post IA-TBI.Tissue clearing and confocal imagingUltrastructural assessment of traumaticC57BL/6 (n = 6); survival 15 min or 4 h.Electron microscopyaxonal injury Ultrastructural and stereological assessment of traumatic axonopathyC57BL/6 ; Sarm1 KO (n = 92);survival 3, 7, 14, and 21 days post IA-TBI or sham injury.Additional wt and SKO mice at 3, 7, and 21 days were also prepared for further ultrastructural analyses (n = 13).Electron microscopy,stereology on toluidine blue stained semithin sections.Assessment of neuroinflammationC57BL/6, Sarm1 KO (n = 33);survival 7 and 28 days post IA-TBI or sham injury.

Formaldehyde fixed optic nerves were processed with the SHIELD protocol34 for tissue clearing as per manufacture instructions (LifeCanvas Technologies, MA; Cat.# C-PCK-250-1.52). For the visualization of EZ-Biotin, ONs were incubated with Streptavidin, Alexa Fluor\u2122 594 conjugate (1:1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. #S32356), before washing and index matching. Optic nerves were then imaged with a ZEISS 880 Airyscan microscope using 10 \u00d7 , 25 \u00d7 and 40 \u00d7 objectives.Tissue clearing for optic nerve anatomyTo assess the three-dimensional anatomy of ON axons and its alteration shortly after injury in the presence or absence of Sarm1, we crossed YFP-H mice with Sarm1 KO mice and subjected them to IA-TBI. After perfusion fixation, one of the two ONs was selected at random and processed for clearing and for imaging at 20 \u00d7 with a ZEISS 880 Airyscan microscope as described above (n = 5 per genotype). An investigator blinded to group designation counted axons manually. The total number of axons per ON was estimated by counting manually the number of axons in the proximal ON segment (at three levels) and then the fraction of non-disconnected axons was estimated from the number of axons passing through the injury front with no interruption in YFP-H signal.Tissue preparation for semithin section analysis and transmission electron microscopyWild-type C57BL/6 and Sarm1 KO mice were randomly allocated to sham or IA-TBI condition, and to different survival end-points (3, 7, 14, and 21 days; n = 8-10 per time-point, per genotype). Mice were transcardially perfused with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 50 mM sodium cacodylate, 50 mM phosphate and 3 mM magnesium chloride buffer (pH = 7.4) for 30 min. Tissues were left in situ at room temperature for 2 h before dissection and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in the same fixative. Tissues were rinsed (5 \u00d7 15 min) in 75 mM sodium cacodylate, 75 mM phosphate, and 3 mM magnesium chloride (pH = 7.4) on a rotator. To adjust osmolarity, the first two rinsing steps included 2:1 and 1:1 mixture of fixative solution and buffer at 4\u00b0C, respectively. Tissues were then incubated in freshly prepared 2% osmium tetroxide with 1.6% potassium ferrocyanide in the same buffer for 2 h at room temperature in the dark.Following osmication, tissues were rinsed three times in 100 mM maleate, 3.5% sucrose buffer (pH = 6.2) for 10 min and incubated with 2% uranyl acetate in maleate-sucrose buffer for 1 h followed by step-wise rinsing steps in maleate buffer, 1:1 maleate buffer with distilled water, and finally distilled water for 5 min each. Tissue blocks were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, transferred in propylene oxide and incubated in 50% embedded in EMbed 812 resin (EMS14120, Electron Microscope Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Semithin (1 \u03bcm) and thin (60 nm) sections were sectioned in a Leica UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Deerfield, IL). Sections were obtained through the transverse and longitudinal planes to sample the injury front as well as segments distal and proximal to it. \u201cDistal\u201d sections were obtained at a pre-chiasmatic ON level where all myelinated fibers are visible at cross-section and \u201cproximal\u201d sections immediately distal to the exit of the ON from the optic foramen. Transverse semithin sections were stained with 1% toluidine blue. Thin sections were mounted on square mess copper grids (EMS300-Cu, Electron Microscope Sciences, Hatfield, PA), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined and photographed on a Hitachi H7600 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).Stereological quantitation of intact and abnormal myelinated axonsTransverse semithin sections distal and proximal to the site of traumatic biomechanical disruption were stained with toluidine blue. Sections were prepared from one ON per subject that was selected randomly and stereological analysis was performed by two separate investigators blinded to experimental history. Interrater reliability was very high with Pearson's r of 0.997. Analysis was performed at 100 \u00d7 using systematic random sampling and the optical fractionator probe, with the aid of a motorized stage Axioplan microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.) and Stereo Investigator\u00ae software (Microbrightfield Inc., Williston, VT). Parameters were selected based on empirically determined sampling methods35 and were as follows: counting frame size of 4 \u00d7 4 \u03bcm, grid size of 17.89 \u00d7 17.89 \u03bcm and sampling fraction of 4%. Pathological profiles included fibers with condensed (dark) or hydropic axoplasm and pathological sheaths with myelin thinning, excess myelin figures, and collapsed myelin.Processing of retinas and quantitation of retinal ganglion cell bodiesBecause glutaraldehyde fixation poses challenges in immunohistochemistry for RGC markers, we estimated RGC densities using hematoxylin-stained sections. Briefly, eyes were embedded in paraffin after removal of the cornea and sectioned at 10 \u03bcm. Sections through the optic nerve head were stained with hematoxylin, mounted with DPX and examined for the identification of RGCs in the ganglion cell layer based on nuclear histology.36,37 Retinal ganglion cells are characterized by a large, round, lightly stained nucleus and prominent central nucleolus. Cells with elongated nuclei were deemed to be epithelial cells, while cells with small, dense, and uniformly stained round nuclei were identified as amacrine cells.36,37Cell counts were performed by an investigator blinded to experimental history. Using the optical fractionator stereological probe, the retinal ganglion cell layer was traced at 10 \u00d7 and individual RGC profiles were counted under 40 \u00d7 magnification. For each mouse, RGC count was determined as the mean count of three sections.Assessment of neuroinflammation in cleared optic nervesTo assess activation of microglia and phagocytosis in ONs after IA-TBI, wild-type, and Sarm1 KO mice were randomly allocated to sham or IA-TBI condition, and left to survive for 7 or 28 days (n = 5-6 per time-point \u00d7 per genotype). Mice were transcardially perfused with 4% PFA in PBS as in a previous section. Optic nerves were processed with the SHIELD protocol as above with the following change: before, refractive index matching, optic nerves were incubated with a monoclonal rabbit antibody (E4O4W) against IBA1 (1:50; Cell Signaling Technology, Cat# 17198; RRID:AB_2820254) and a rat monoclonal antibody (clone FA-11) against CD 68 (1:100; Bio-Rad Cat# MCA1957GA, RRID:AB_324217) for 4 days at 37\u00b0C in PBS with 0.1% Triton (PBST) and 0.1% NaN3. Then they were washed three times in PBST over 8 h and further incubated with secondary goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor Plus 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A48265, RRID:AB_2895299) and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor Plus 594 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A48284, RRID:AB_2896348) for 2.5 days at 37\u00b0C, then washed again in PBST and PBS. Z-stack images (60 \u03bcm) through the center of the most distal 1-mm segment were captured at 20 \u00d7 with a ZEISS 880 Airyscan microscope. The signal of the CD 68 channel was quantified in FIJI (NIH, RRID:SCR_002285) as areal density: z-stack images were converted to binary masks with adaptive thresholding after background subtraction, Gaussian blur and sum Z-projection, and the fraction of signal coverage (areal density) was measured.Statistical analysisGraphpad Prism 9.1 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, Ca, USA; RRID:SCR_002798) was used for statistical analysis and plotting of figures. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or mixed effect models (Fdf,df, where df is degrees of freedom) were used for the assessment of genotype, time and/or location effects with adjustment for multiple independent or pairwise comparisons (tdf) as indicated. For the statistical analysis of CD 68 signal, two-way ANOVA was performed after log-transformation of the data to account for heteroskedasticity. Significance threshold (p) was set at 0.05.",

    "PMC10458377": "MethodsThis is a retrospective pre-clinical study. The data set used consisted of 1203 mice retrieved from 58 different experiments conducted at the Mannix-Meehan Lab at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts, USA, some of which have been previously published independently.10\u201318 All animals were C57BL male mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA). They were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room with a 12 h light\u2013dark cycle and fed ad libitum. All experiments were approved by the Boston Children's Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and complied with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.TBI weight drop modelA modified weight drop model featuring rotational acceleration, which has been described previously for a subgroup of the data set,13 was used in this study. All animals were anesthetized for 45 sec with 4% isoflurane in oxygen until fully unconscious. The mice were placed on a delicate tissue (Kimwipe; Kimberly-Clark, Irving, Texas, USA) and grasped by the tail. The heads of the mice were then placed underneath tubes of varying heights such that the end of the tube was centered between and slightly in front of the ears, which approximates bregma. Finally, a 54 g metal bolt was dropped through the tube to injure the TBI mice (n = 675), while the sham (n = 528) group received comparable isoflurane exposure but did not receive the injury. The impact resulted in rotational acceleration of the animal through the Kimwipe, generating various degrees of diffuse axonal injury. In the data set analyzed in this study, a variety of injury paradigms were used, based on the height of the weight drop, and number of injuries (ranging from 0 to 13, including 1) over a given time period and age at injury (Table 1). The injury severity was assessed using the time of loss of consciousness.Table 1.Characteristics of the MiceCharacteristicTBI (n = 675)Sham (n = 528)All (n = 1203)Height of weight drop [inch] 00528528 282180218 423190319 4635035 5063063 6040040Number of TBI/shams over given time period 1 TBI/sham11676192 2 TBI/shams during 1 day28634 4 TBI/shams during 4 days562480 5 TBI/shams, total373338711 5 TBI/shams during 5 days301266567 5 TBI/shams during 5 weeks242448 5 TBI/shams during 10 weeks242448 5 TBI/shams during 5 months242448 7 TBI/shams during 9 days10276178 6-13 TBI/shams during 5 days088Age at TBI/sham [weeks] 55447101 85634451008 12351247 28232447Treatment and method of delivery External stimulus: Flicker303060 Genetic:262652 Tau heterozygous knockout141428 Tau homozygous knockout121224 Housing10061161 Enrichment8861149 Single housing12012 Intraperitoneal injection18155236 Cis P-tau38947 CRP606 Memantine461965 IgG331043 Saline581775 Intranasal delivery351247 Anti-CD317623 IgG18624 Oral (via water)484997 Memantine252449 Saline232548 No treatment255295550CD3, cluster of differentiation 3; CRP, C-reactive protein; IgG, immunoglobulin G; TBI/sham, either a traumatic brain injury (TBI) or a sham injury (anesthesia without TBI).A note on terminology: \u201cTBI\u201d and \u201csham\u201dIn subsequent text, figures, and tables, the terms \u201cTBI\u201d and \u201csham\u201d are used as group terms for the action of either only anesthetizing (sham) or both anesthetizing and administering a TBI (TBI) to a mouse.TreatmentsMice were either exposed to a treatment (n = 463), to vehicle control (n = 190), or to no treatment (n = 550).

Notably, no mouse was exposed to all behavioral tests, and no behavioral test was measured in all mice. The fraction of available data for each behavioral outcome, as well as the cumulative fraction, defined as the fraction of mice that were tested both for the specified behavioral outcome and for all outcomes with higher availability, is presented in Figure 1B. The combination with most variables (15 behavioral outcomes; 180 TBI and 121 sham mice) was subsequently used when complete-case data were required.FIG. 1.Distribution of available behavioral outcome data. (A) Tile plot of missing and available data. Each behavioral outcome measured at a particular time point for every mouse was plotted as \u201cmissing\u201d or \u201cavailable,\u201d depending on whether the behavioral outcome had been tested on the mouse. The majority of tiles were missing, indicating that the data were sparse. No behavioral outcome was tested on all mice, and no mouse was tested for all behavioral outcomes. Some mice, but not all, were tested for certain outcomes at multiple time points. (B) Point plot of available fractions, sorted in decreasing order. For each behavioral outcome, the number of mice and the fraction of mice tested was plotted (\u201cavailable fraction\u201d). After they were ordered in decreasing order, the number of mice and fraction of mice tested for the cumulative set of behavioral outcomes up until the particular outcome were plotted (\u201ccumulative fraction\u201d). The behavioral outcomes with highest fractions were tested on approximately half of the mice, whereas most outcomes were tested on <10% of mice. Only 15 behavioral outcomes had a cumulative fraction >0 (vertical dashed line).

For week 0, loss of consciousness was recorded directly after injury, whereas other behavioral outcomes were recorded later during the week. b Redundant variables, with no degree of freedom.Statistical analysisAll analyses were performed in R, version 4.0.3.23Principal component analysis (PCA). In order to visualize several behavioral outcomes simultaneously, PCA was used. PCA can reduce the number of dimensions (i.e., behavioral outcomes) to a smaller set of dimensions that account for a large fraction of explained variance. The package FactoMineR24 was used for calculations and plotting. All variables were scaled to unit variance, and outliers more than five standard deviations from the mean were omitted. Because PCA requires complete-case data, all analyses were performed on the first 15 behavioral outcomes in Figure 1B. First, PCA was used to visualize differences in experiments by plotting mice with no TBI and no treatment, and then coloring the mice in the new dimensions after either their experiment or total period of administered anesthesia. Ellipses of one standard deviation (68%) confidence intervals were drawn for all color groups as orientation. This could show whether inter-experiment variability could be attributed to differences in number of anesthetic events. Second, PCA was used to visualize the information content of behavioral tests. This was done by first calculating the principal components of all mice, and then plotting the correlations between the behavioral outcomes and the principal components in a heatmap. The package pheatmap25 was used for visualization. Dendrograms were calculated using complete-linkage clustering. In order to visualize the inter-relation of behavioral tests and their information content, behavioral outcomes were categorized according to whether higher values represent good or bad outcomes as well as whether the test group was anxiety/depression, cognitive deficit, or motor deficit.Logistical modelIn order to determine how well behavioral tests can discriminate between injured and uninjured animals, logistical regression was used as a supervised classifier. Because the accuracy of classification depends on a threshold value, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used as the performance measure because of its independence of the threshold.9 A performance measure is a quantification of the ability of a model to predict a response correctly.9 The AUC is an aggregated measure of the sensitivity and specificity for all thresholds.9 Higher AUC indicates that the model predicts injury well.9 The range of AUC is from 0 to 1, where AUC = 0.5 when the model is equivalent to random chance.9 Bootstrapping with 25 iterations was used to generate multiple data sets, from which the mean AUC and its standard deviation were recorded. This maximized use of the limited data points, while still allowing for validation across the iterations. For completeness, the data were also run using 10-fold cross- validation, with the results displayed in the accompanying Shiny26 application. In order to avoid overfitting, a minimum of 10 mice per variable were required for each model to be run. To account for inter-experiment variability, all models were adjusted for number of TBI/shams. Calculations were done using the package caret.27Best model selection algorithmTo find the best model, the following algorithm was used: All behavioral outcomes at level 3 were grouped by week of testing (Table 4). For each group of level 3 behavioral outcomes at a certain week (e.g. Morris water maze: hidden trials 1\u20135: week 17 [MWM:H1:W17\u2013MWM:H5:W17]), AUC was computed for all possible combinations of behavioral tests. The best combination was recorded. If the best AUC minus one standard deviation of AUC of this group was >0.75, the best combination qualified for further analysis in step 2. Qualified combinations were labeled as the best models for level 3. All qualified models from best models for level 3 were candidates to be included at level 2. For each level 2 behavioral outcome (e.g,. all MWMs), all qualified variables from level 3 were selected from the data. Because of the high degree of missingness, where there were no mice undergoing all tests, all variables could not be included simultaneously. Therefore, the combination with the highest possible number of variables was included and labeled as the maximum model. From the maximum models, the best combinations were recorded as the best models for level 2. All qualified models from best models for level 2 were candidates to be included at level 1. The selection algorithm for best models for level 1 was analogous to that previously explained for level 2.Table 4.Overview of the Behavioral OutcomesBehavioral outcomeDetailsPrevious publications of this dataLevel 1Level 2Level 3CognitiveMorris water maze (MWM)Hidden (H)Mice were placed in a water tank with a hidden platform that they could mount to rest. Latency to find the platform without (H) and with visual (V) cues was recorded. The platform was removed and time spent (P) at the previous location of the platform or number of times passed by (PF) was recorded. Rapid location of the platform or much time spent in its previous location is associated with good spatial learning and memory.28 11-18 Visual (V)Probe (P)Probe frequency (PF)Novel recognition (NR)Object (O)Mice were allowed to become familiarized with three identical objects. One of the objects was either replaced by a novel object (O) or moved to a novel location (L). Much time spent at the novel object or location is associated with good working memory.29 16 Location (L)Y-maze (YM) Mice were placed in the center of a Y-shaped container with three identical arms oriented at 120 degree angles. A large alternation between arms is associated with good spatial working memory.30\u2014Anxiety/depressionElevated plus maze (EPM) Mice were placed in the center of a platform with two open and two closed (walled) arms. More time spent in the open arms is associated with lower levels of anxiety.31 11,12,15,17,18 Open field test (OF)Square \u2014 position (SP)Mice were placed in either circular (C) or square (S) opaque containers, facing a wall. Position (P) and distance (D) travelled were recorded.

Less locomotor activity is associated with anxiety-like behavior.34\u2014Tail suspension test (TST) Mice were suspended by the tail. More time spent immobile is associated with depressant-like behavior.35\u2014Sucrose preference test (SPT) Mice were placed in a cage with two sipper tubes, one of which contained normal drinking water and the other with 2% sucrose added. Lower intake of sucrose solution is associated with depressant-like behavior.36\u2014MotorRotarod (Rota) Mice were trained by being placed on the rotating drum (4 rpm). Testing was performed the following days. Mice were placed on the rotating drum (4 rpm) for 10 sec to acclimate, after which the rod was accelerated by 0.1 rpm/sec. Shorter latency to fall is associated with greater neurological deficit.37 11,15,16,18 k-means clusteringTo explore the data structure of combinations of behavioral outcomes, k-means clustering was used. Compared with the supervised learning of logistical regression, k-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.9 Therefore, it finds clusters in the data, entirely based on the behavioral outcomes (without training on injury data). The algorithm partitions the data into k non-overlapping clusters.9 The adjusted Rand index (ARI), which is an adjusted fraction of correct clustering, was used as the performance measure.38 If the clusters are more similar to the true division between injured and uninjured animals, the ARI is higher. The ARI is bounded above at 1, and an ARI of 0 occurs at random chance.38 The same complete-case data set as in the aforementioned PCA was used. All combinations of behavioral outcomes included were run through the algorithm, with from 1 to 15 variables in each model. All variables were scaled to unit variance, and outliers more than five standard deviations from the mean were omitted. Calculations were done using the stats package in base R.39 The Euclidean metric and the algorithm of Hartigan and Wong40 was used. Visual analysis of the feature distribution showed generally convex distributions (Supplementary Figures).Linear modelTo determine whether multiple heterogeneous experiments can predict outcome better than single homogenous experiments, linear regression, a supervised learning algorithm, was used. The performance measure was the root-mean-square error (RMSE) divided by the standard deviation of the behavioral outcome data (standardized RMSE). If the model predicts outcome well, the RMSE is lower. The dependent variable chosen to investigate was MWM:H4:W2; a pilot study not shown indicated a similar pattern for most behavioral outcomes. Independent variables were loss of consciousness after the first TBI/sham, number of TBIs/sham exposures, and treatment. For each number of studies to be included (ranging from 1 to 32), 25 random combinations of studies were selected, and for each of these, bootstrapping was used with 10 iterations. Calculations were done using the package caret.27 All outliers more than five standard deviations from the mean were omitted prior to calculations.Ethical approvalAll experiments were approved by the Boston Children's Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and complied with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Ethical permit has been approved under the following review numbers: 17-09-3532R, 18-07-2754R, 18-12-3851R, 19-12-4110R*, 20-04-4163R, and 20-08-4251R. The experiments presented have not primarily been used for the outlined analysis, but rather were retrospectively collected from materials that have been or will be published separately. In terms of the 3R principle41 \u2013 replace, refine, and reduce animal experiments \u2013 this study is a way to refine the original data by maximizing output of already recorded data. Its results might be used to refine future animal experiments.",

    "PMC9986007": "MethodsStudy setting and populationThis prospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali (CHUK) in Kigali, Rwanda.22 CHUK is Rwanda's primary national referral hospital, with approximately 500 inpatient beds and a 50-bed emergency department (ED) providing 24-h daily care, and the only neurosurgery service supported by the Rwanda Ministry of Health nationwide.24,25Under the provisions of an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol developed before the COVID-19 pandemic focused on general trauma epidemiology at CHUK, all adult injury patients presenting to the CHUK ED were screened for enrollment. Adult injury patients presenting with neurotrauma who were not deceased on arrival, a prisoner of the state, or pregnant and who provided consent were included for analysis. A legally authorized patient representative provided informed consent for patients unable to consent due to incapacity. The present CNS-trauma-focused analysis is a subpopulation analysis of a previously published study for the general trauma population at CHUK, as described earlier, which did not analyze the CNS trauma in isolation.22 Patients were enrolled from January 27, 2020 to June 28, 2020 excluding a cessation of research activities from March 22, 2020 to May 31, 2020 during Rwanda's first national lockdown.22 Consequently, the study population was stratified by date of presentation into groups: \u201cbefore COVID-19\u201d (January 27, 2020 to March 21, 2020) and \u201cduring COVID-19\u201d (June 1, 2020 to June 28, 2020). Exclusion criteria are visualized in Figure 1, with the most common reasons for exclusion being not having CNS trauma (n = 364) and being <18 years of age (n = 199). All research activities were approved by the CHUK Research Ethics Committee (EC/CHUK/053/2021) and Institutional Review Board of Brown University (#21-32).FIG. 1.Flow diagram for CNS trauma patients at CHUK. The diagram demonstrates application of inclusion and exclusion criteria for the present study. A total of 216 CNS trauma patients treated at CHUK were identified for analysis. CHUK, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali; CNS, central nervous system; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019.Data managementFollowing patient enrollment, trained research personnel collected data continuously using structured case reporting forms on an hourly basis during the first 6 h of ED care. Variables prospectively collected included patient demographics, mechanism of injury, time from injury to presentation, injury acuity, acute interventions during the first 6 h of care, imaging findings, and disposition. Injury severity was quantified by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Kampala Trauma Score (KTS). The KTS is a previously validated trauma prognostication score designed specifically for use in LMIC and ranges continuously from 5 to 16, with lower scores denoting higher acuity.26\u201328 Following earlier studies, the shock index was calculated as the quotient of heart rate over systolic blood pressure on ED arrival and dichotomized at a threshold of \u22650.9 to indicate hemodynamic instability.29To identify additional clinical variables of interest not captured by standardized screening forms, a retrospective chart review was conducted to record symptoms on presentation, serial neurological examinations, neurological intensive care unit (neuro-ICU) admission and length of stay (LOS), pharmacological agents administered, overall LOS, and extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) score at discharge, reflecting functional status.30,31 GCS score (mild = 13\u201315, moderate = 9\u201312, severe = 3\u20138) and GOSE score (7\u20138 = good recovery vs. 1\u20136 = death, vegetative state, or disability) were categorized following earlier methods.28,32 The outcome of neurological decline was defined as a composite variable encapsulating GCS score decline of \u22652 points, new-onset unconsciousness, or new-onset sensorimotor deficit documented on serial exams.33,34Study enrollment and standardized data collection were performed by a team of seven research personnel who remained constant through the study period, all native to Rwanda, fluent in the three local languages (Kinyarwanda, French, and English), and with experience in clinical research and health care provision. Research personnel were trained in operating procedures by via didactic sessions and interactive role playing over a 2-day seminar. Data were collected on standardized hard-copy case reporting forms and entered daily into a password-protected online database. Data were checked weekly by the study team for validation and any data collection personnel having >5% missingness in their data were given focused assistance and retraining to improve data capture.Statistical analysisAll statistical analysis was performed via Stata 17 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Data visualization of end-points of clinical interest chosen a priori was conducted using the matplotlib package on Python (Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Descriptive statistics calculated for the study population included frequencies with percentages for categorical variables and means with standard deviations (SDs) or medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous variables. Differences in patient ED volume, presenting characteristics, management, and outcomes for patients treated before compared with during the COVID-19 pandemic were queried by chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. Missing data that were not collected prospectively via standardized study forms or could not be abstracted from chart review were included as a discrete category during analysis of categorical variables. Statistical significance was maintained at p < 0.05, without correction for multiple comparisons.",

    "PMC9986024": "MethodsParticipantsThe patients with MTBI were part of the Trondheim MTBI follow-up study (total n = 378), recruited in 2014 and 2015.33 A total of 199 patients, aged 16 to 59, participated in an extended follow-up study including MRI at 3T. All had experienced a TBI defined as a physical trauma to the head or high energy trauma followed by witnessed loss of consciousness (LOC) or confusion and/or PTA for the event or the time period after the event, and/or traumatic brain lesions on CT. The TBI was further defined as mild per the World Health Organization Collaborating Center Task Force on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury criteria: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13-15 at presentation to the emergency department, LOC <30 min, and PTA <24 h.34 Exclusion criteria were: non-fluency in the Norwegian language; pre-existing severe neurological, psychiatric, somatic, or substance use disorder (i.e., determined to be severe enough to likely interfere with follow-up); a prior history of a complicated mild (i.e., self-reported CT findings), moderate, or severe TBI; or other major trauma. The exclusion criteria were evaluated with a structured interview. Previous TBI was evaluated with the Ohio State University TBI Identification Method Short Form (https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/neurological-institute/neuroscience-research-institute/research-centers/ohio-valley-center-for-brain-injury-prevention-and-rehabilitation/for-professionals/screening-for-tbi). Recruitment took place at two emergency departments: a level 1 trauma center in Trondheim, Norway; and at the Trondheim Municipal Emergency clinic, a general practitioner-run, out-patient clinic.A group of 83 age-, sex-, and education-matched community controls was recruited among hospital and university staff, students, and acquaintances of staff, students, and patients. The exclusion criteria applied in the MTBI group were used for the controls, but in addition, the controls should not be receiving treatment for psychiatric disorders.The study was approved by the regional committee for research ethics (REK 2013/754) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants, and caregivers of participants younger than 18 years, gave informed consent.Clinical and demographic variablesThe GCS score was assessed by study personnel or obtained from the patient's medical records. LOC was defined as present only if it was witnessed. PTA was defined as the time after the injury for which the patient had no continuous memory and dichotomized into <1 h (short) and 1-24 h (long). From a pilot study, we experienced that many patients could not report a valid estimate in minutes; therefore, PTA was recorded as either less than 1 h or 1-24 h. Other concurrent injuries (i.e., fractures and soft-tissue injuries) were recorded. Pre-injury intelligence was estimated with the Vocabulary subtest from Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence.35 The matched control group has been found to be very similar to the MTBI group also on a range of personal factors (e.g., intelligence, personality, psychological resilience, alcohol use), although the MTBI group had a higher frequency of previous uncomplicated MTBI (22% vs 10%).36,37Magnetic resonance imagingPatients with MTBI and controls underwent MRI on a 3T Siemens Skyra scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head coil within 72 h, at 3 months, and at 12 months after the injury. A neuroradiologist (K.A.K) and a resident in radiology (J.X) read the following MRI sequences: 1) three-dimensional (3D) T1 Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo Imaging (MPRAGE); 2) two-dimensional axial diffusion-weighted imaging; (3) 3D T2 space; 4) 3D fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR); and 5) 3D susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI).38 Patients with visible traumatic intracranial lesions on clinical MRI were considered complicated MTBI, while those without, uncomplicated MTBI. The type of abnormalities found on clinical MRI in patients with complicated MTBI (n = 22), and how these were defined, have been reported in detail elsewhere.38 None of the patients had an intracranial injury requiring surgery and patients with complicated MTBI presented with the following findings: traumatic axonal injury n = 11 (depicted as either microbleeds on SWI or hyperintensities on FLAIR, located in the typical locations in white matter); contusions n = 12 (defined as superficial cortical lesions); epidural hematoma n = 3; subdural hematoma n = 3; traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage n = 3.DTI and DKI data processingThe DTI/DKI sequence was a single-shot balanced-echo echo-planar imaging sequence acquired in 30 non-collinear directions per b-value with the following parameters: three b-values (b = 0, five averages; b = 1000; b = 2000 sec/mm2, average signal-to-noise ratio at b0 = 158); repetition time = 8800 msec; echo time = 95 msec; field of view = 240 \u00d7 240 mm; slice thickness = 2.5 mm; acquisition matrix 96 \u00d7 96; 60 transversal slices, no gaps, were acquired. To correct for image distortion, two additional b = 0 images were acquired with opposite phase encoding polarity.39Images were analyzed with the fMRIB Software Library (FSL) v. 6.0.4 and the Diffusion Kurtosis Estimator (DKE). Non-brain tissue was removed with the Brain Extraction Tool (FSL). Artifacts due to eddy currents and movements were corrected with eddy (FSL), which included b-matrix rotation. Correction of the susceptibility induced off-resonance field artifacts was done with topup (FSL). DKI and DTI model fitting was performed with DKE, which formulate the tensor estimation problem as linearly constrained linear least squares, and parametric maps were calculated for the two most studied DTI metrics and their kurtosis equivalents: FA, MD, KFA, and Kmean.40Voxel-wise statistical analysis was performed using TBSS.41 All subjects' FA data were aligned in a common space using the nonlinear registration tool FNIRT.42,43 A mean FA image was created from all FA images and thinned to create a skeletonized mean FA representing the centers of all tracts common to all the subjects in the analysis. The mean FA skeleton was thresholded at FA 0.2 to include major white matter tracts but exclude peripheral tracts and grey matter. Each subject's aligned FA data were then projected onto this skeleton. The skeletonization process was also applied to MD, KFA, and Kmean, and the statistical comparisons of these data were then restricted to voxels in the FA-based white matter skeleton. The resulting skeletonized data were used in the statistical analysis.Statistical analysisGroup differences in demographic variables were examined with t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and chi-squared tests. We analyzed the DTI/DKI data in three steps. In step 1, Randomise44 in FSL was used to perform voxel-wise analyses on the white matter skeleton to identify differences in diffusion metrics between the MTBI and control group separately at the three time-points (cross-sectional comparisons). Randomise is a non-parametric, permutation-based method using threshold-free cluster enhancement with correction for multiple comparisons (family-wise error rate). A p value <0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons, was considered statistically significant. Analyses were controlled for age, age*age,45 sex, and scanner upgrade (due to scanner upgrade from version D13 to E11 during the inclusion period), and 5000 permutations were used.In step 2, change over time in the clusters of voxels identified in step 1 as significant was investigated with linear mixed-effect models. For example, if Randomise identified 1000 voxels with significantly lower FA in corona radiata at 72 h, we extracted the mean FA of these 1000 voxels at the 72 h and the 3- and 12-month MRI. We then evaluated change over time in mean FA in this cluster of voxels with a mixed-effect model. As in step 1, analyses were controlled for age, age*age, sex and scanner upgrade. The main effects of interest in these models were the group*time interaction (i.e., testing whether diffusion metrics developed differently in patients with MTBI compared with controls).To restrict the number of comparisons and thereby reduce the risk of sporadic findings, these analyzes were only performed in tracts where 100 or more voxels differed significantly between the MTBI and control group. The JHU ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels atlas was used to identify the tract of the significant voxels identified in step 1 and mean diffusion values were extracted and analyzed from significant voxels within a JHU-defined tract (i.e., we did not extract mean diffusion values from the whole tract, only from the significant voxels identified in step 1). Thus, the voxels identified in step 1 were analyzed longitudinally, tract by tract, and they were analyzed both prospectively (e.g., how voxels that differed significantly between patients with MTBI and controls at the 72-h scan evolved over time) and retrospectively (e.g., how voxels that differed significantly between patients with MTBI and controls at the 12 months scan appeared at 72 h and 3 months).The estimated means of the diffusion metrics with corresponding 95% confidence intervals are presented in figures. Mean differences, standardized mean differences, and p values (unadjusted for multiple comparisons, but marked with an * if still significant after Bonferroni correction) from the statistical models are reported in supplementary tables. Standardized mean differences were obtained by first dividing the original diffusion values with the standard deviation of the control group at 72 h and then re-do the analyses. Traditionally, standardized mean differences of 0.2 are considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 large.46 In the mixed-effect models, the within-subject correlation was modeled by a random, subject-specific intercept and the parameters of the model were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood. Normality of the data was inspected with histograms and QQ-plots and was considered satisfactory. Importantly, in mixed-effect models, a participant is included in the model even if he or she did not complete all assessments (i.e., no listwise deletion is carried out because of missing outcome data).47 Analyses were performed with Stata v. 17.In step 3, to investigate whether the group differences identified in step 1 were driven mainly by deviating diffusion in patients with a more severe injury, we divided the MTBI group into (A) complicated versus uncomplicated MTBI; (B) long versus short PTA; and (C) other versus no other concurrent injuries. The mixed-effect models described in step 2 were re-run, but the groups compared were patients divided according to A, B and C. To investigate possible differences in diffusion metrics between the injury severity groups outside the clusters identified in step 1, we also performed voxel-wise comparisons with Randomise across the entire skeleton between these groups.In addition to presenting standardized mean differences for each comparison, we also present them combined across diffusion metrics. In this case, the direction was transformed so that a positive effect size equaled higher FA, KFA, and Kmean, and lower MD values in the control group, the uncomplicated group, the short PTA group, and the group with no other injuries.Data availabilityAnonymized data is available upon reasonable request from any qualified investigator.",
    "PMC10061334": "MethodsA decision-analytic model was developed in Microsoft Excel to examine costs and health outcomes associated with the use of blood-based brain biomarker tests and CT scanning for screening patients presenting to the ED with suspected mTBI. The model was developed from a French health care perspective with a lifetime time horizon. Costs are presented in 2020 euros. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 2.5% up to 30 years and 1.5% thereafter.13 Details are available in Supplementary Appendix S1.All data used to populate the model are publicly available, and no patient-level data were used in this model. Thus, review/approval by an institutional review board was not required.Patient populationThe target patient population was adults age \u226518 years who presented to the ED with suspected mTBI (GCS score of 13\u201315) within 12 h of injury.7,14ComparatorsBiomarkers in this analysis included S100B or GFAP+UCH-L1 along with standard clinical assessment for mTBI. GFAP and UCH-L1 are two different brain-specific protein biomarkers approved by the FDA for use within 12 h of injury in patients age \u226518 years with suspected mTBI.15 S100B has high clinical sensitivity for abnormal head CT scans in patients with isolated head trauma when measured within 6 h of head injury.7,16In real-world practice, patients exhibiting symptoms of mTBI may arrive at the ED within 6 h of injury or later. Thus, the proportion of patients arriving during the first hours following injury will vary in different hospital settings. When using biomarkers with time window restrictions, hospitals need to revert to using CT scanning as the primary evaluation method when patients arrive outside the approved time window. As such, we evaluated a number of hospital scenarios in which all patients with mTBI arrive at the ED within 12 h of injury and are eligible for screening with one of the biomarkers, CT, or a combination of one of the biomarkers and CT.Three comparisons were performed (Fig. 1):FIG. 1.Screening comparisons. (A) GFAP+UCH-L1 versus CT scan. (B) GFAP+UCH-L1 versus S100B. (C) Hospital A with GFAP+UCH-L1 versus Hospital B with S100B and CT Scan. CT, computed tomography; GFAP+UCH-L1, glial fibrillary acidic protein and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1.GFAP+UCH-L1 versus CT scan (Fig. 1A): combination GFAP+UCH-L1 versus all patients who undergo CT scanning within 12 h of injuryGFAP+UCH-L1 versus S100B (Fig. 1B): combination GFAP+UCH-L1 versus S100B within 6 h of injury per S100B package insert16GFAP+UCH-L1 versus a combination of S100B and CT scan (Fig. 1C): a population-based analysis in which hospital A has access to the GFAP+UCH-L1 biomarker and hospital B has access to the S100B biomarker in which S100B is used within 3 h so that the number of false-negatives is minimized.17 Specifically, GFAP+UCH-L1 is used in hospital A for screening within 12 h following injury compared with hospital B in which 70%, 50%, or 30% of patients receive S100B within the first 3 h of injury and the remaining 30%, 50%, or 70% of patients receive a CT scan between 3 and 12 h following injury. Jehl\u00e9 and colleagues17 reported in an expert consensus that even though approved for use within 6 h of injury, an S100B test performed within 3 h allows for maximal sensitivity (close to 100%).Model structureThe model is a decision tree structure (Fig. 2) to simulate short- and long-term costs and outcomes. Patients enter the model by presenting to the ED with a suspected mTBI. At this visit, after clinical examination, patients are screened with a head CT or one of the biomarker tests to evaluate the presence or absence of lesions (i.e., non-neurosurgical lesions or lesions requiring surgical evacuation). Diagnostic performance of the CT scan and biomarker tests (i.e., sensitivity and specificity) is used to evaluate this presence. In patients who have a positive biomarker test result, a CT scan is performed to confirm the presence of ICLs. Depending on the biomarker test outcome and/or the CT results, patients may be discharged immediately from the ED, kept for <24-h observation, or admitted to a short-stay general ward or neurosurgery ward. Patients without lesions may be discharged immediately or kept for short-term observation.FIG. 2.Model structure. aValue in parentheses represents probability of proceeding through this branch and varies by model comparator. CCU, critical care unit; ED, emergency department; GP, general practitioner; mTBI , mild traumatic brain injury.Patients with lesions receiving a correct diagnosis (true-positive) are assumed to receive appropriate care and have optimal outcomes. Patients with lesions who are misdiagnosed (false-negative) may be treated properly based on clinical judgment. However, a small portion of these patients may be discharged, further deteriorate, and require readmission for further evaluation. For these patients, delays in appropriate treatment may lead to suboptimal health outcomes and increased costs. Patients requiring neurosurgical intervention may receive additional (follow-up) CT scans. Patients with false-positive biomarker test results are likely to get a head CT and thus incur additional costs. Patient flow within the decision tree is presented in Figure 2 and is based on clinical opinion of French health professionals (ED physicians, neurosurgeons, and intensivists) involved in the care of mTBI patients.Lesion presence and appropriate and timely patient management will affect patient outcomes as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Post-discharge, patients are assumed to remain in their resulting GOS health state for the remainder of their lifetime. Costs and outcomes are accrued specific to these GOS health states and the resulting resource use incurred in the initial admission and/or readmission.Lesion prevalenceThe prevalence of ICL types in patients with mTBI was obtained from the ALERT-TBI pivotal trial (Table 1).14 This prevalence was found to be similar to the prevalence reported by Smits and associates.18Table 1.Prevalence, Sensitivity, and SpecificityModel parameter Base-case estimate (range)Prevalence in GCS score 13\u201315Base-case values14Alternative values18No lesion93.84% (97.06%-93.84%)92.36% (84.64%-100.00%)Non-neurosurgical lesion5.91% (2.81%-5.91%)7.10% (6.26%-8.05%)Neurosurgical lesion0.26% (0.12%-0.26%)0.53% (0.33%-0.85%)Biomarker sensitivity/specificityGFAP+UCH-L1 (GCS score 13-15)19GFAP+UCH-L1 (GCS score 13-15) alternative values20GFAP+UCH-L1 (GCS score 14-15)14GFAP+UCH-L1 (GCS score 15)20GFAP+UCH-L1 (real world)21S100B22S100B alternative values16Specificity (no lesion)0.365 (0.342-0.387)0.404 (0382-0.427)0.367 (0.345-0.390)0.411 (0.387-0.434)0.250 (0.200-0.300)0.310 (0.270-0.360)0.300 (0.290-0.310)Sensitivity (non-neurosurgical lesion)0.975 (0.929-0.995)0.958 (0.906-0.982)0.973 (0.924-0.994)0.957 (0.896-0.983)1.000 (0.820-1.000)0.960 (0.920-0.980)0.990 (0.960-1.000)Sensitivity (neurosurgical lesion)1.000 (0.800-1.000)1.000 (0.800-1.000)1.000 (0.631-1.000)1.000 (0.800-1.000)1.000 (0.820-1.000)1.000 (0.800-1.000)1.000 (0.800-1.000)GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; GFAP+UCH-L1, glial fibrillary acidic protein and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1.Sensitivity and specificitySensitivity and specificity for GFAP+UCH-L1 was obtained from the prospective clinical study ALERT-TBI upon which the U.S. FDA's approval decision was based.19 Analyses using another diagnostic platform to measure GFAP+UCH-L1 in slightly reduced ALERT-TBI populations resulted in alternative sets of sensitivity and specificity values that were examined in sensitivity analysis.14,20 In addition, sensitivity and specificity values for the GFAP+UCH-L1 combination, using alternative GFAP and UCH-L1 cutoff values in a cohort of 349 adult patients with mTBI in a Level 1 U.S. trauma center, were examined for completeness.21The sensitivity and specificity of S100B was obtained from a meta-analysis performed to examine the efficacy of various blood-based protein biomarkers for diagnosing TBI.22 The data from that study are similar to the sensitivity and specificity of S100B reported in the S100B product characteristics,16 which are examined in a sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity and specificity parameters are presented in Table 1.As the reference method, we made the simplifying assumption that CT scans are 100% sensitive and specific.Patient outcomesTo estimate the percentage of patients within each GOS health state based on lesion type and deterioration, data were extracted from published literature. A summary of the GOS by branch of the decision tree is presented in Table 2.Table 2.Percentage of Patients Expected to Be in Health States Defined by GOS ScoreGOS outcomeNo lesion (assumption)Non-neurosurgical lesions without deterioration (assumption)Non-neurosurgical lesion with deterioration38,39Neurosurgical lesion immediate surgery38,40,41Neurosurgical lesion delayed surgery38,40,41GOS 5100.00%(80.00%-100.00%)100.00%(80.00%-100.00%)84.84%(51.58%-100.00%)80.88%(49.18%-100.00%)74.05%(45.02%-100.00%)GOS 40.00%(0.00%-5.00%)0.00%(0.00%-5.00%)8.84%(5.37 %-12.30%)13.24%(8.05%-18.42%)12.12%(7.37%-16.87%)GOS 30.00%(0.00%-5.00%)0.00%(0.00%-5.00%)5.06%(3.08%-7.05%)4.41%(2.68%-6.14%)10.38%(6.31%-14.45%)GOS 20.00%(0.00%-5.00%)0.00%(0.00%-5.00%)0.63%(0.38%-0.88%)0.00%(0.00%-0.00%)0.00%(0.00%-0.00%)GOS 10.00%(0.00%-5.00%)0.00%(0.00%-5.00%)0.63%(0.38%-0.88%)1.47%(0.89%-2.05%)3.46%(2.10%-4.82%)Post year 5Percentage of patients with changed GOS health state at year 6 and beyondYear 1 health stateGOS 3GOS 4GOS 5GOS 357.69%28.85%13.46%GOS 49.23%58.46%32.31%GOS 55.88%19.61%74.51%GOS, Glasgow Outcome Scale.In the base-case analysis, a patient's resulting GOS health state was assumed to remain constant for the remainder of their lifetime. However, consistent with an analysis by Pandor and colleagues,23 we allowed patients to move between health states after year 6 in sensitivity analysis. The percentage of patients moving from their resultant health state after the index event to a GOS 3, 4, or 5 health state is presented in Table 2. Owing to the absence of data on long-term follow-up of patients with a GOS 2, we conservatively assumed these individuals would stay in GOS 2 unless they died because of all-cause mortality.Radiation-induced cancerAfter a scan, patients were assumed to have an increased lifetime risk of radiation-induced cancer. Stein and associates24 reported an increased lifetime risk of cancer in patients after exposure. We fit an exponential distribution to project risk by age and assumed that the risk increased after every additional scan. As some of the risk data were measured in children and brain biomarkers are approved for use only in adult patients with mTBI, sensitivity analysis was performed in which lifetime risk was projected based on only the last 2 risk data points among individuals who received CT scans at ages 15 and 20 years.Resource use and costsPatients progressed through the model using various resources.

In the same study in which Stein and associates24 examined the risk of radiation-induced cancer, the authors also reported a lifetime risk of mortality due to the occurrence of radiation cancer. An exponential distribution was fit to predict age-specific increased risk of mortality. All-cause mortality was then adjusted in these patients by increasing their risk. As with the radiation-induced cancer incidence, sensitivity analysis was performed in which risk was projected based on only the last 2 risk data points in individuals at ages 15 and 20 years.Model analysisFor each test, lifetime costs and outcomes were derived. One-way sensitivity, scenario, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were run. Details are in Supplementary Appendix S1.",

    "PMC10162119": "MethodsStudy design and settingThis prospective monocentric longitudinal, observational cohort study was approved by the ethics committee of Heidelberg University (S-516-2011) and registered in the German Clinical Trials Registry (Registry-no. DRKS00006258). Before enrollment, written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. Patients were recruited from 2012 to 2016. The time schedule for clinical examinations was derived from the European Multicenter Study about SCI (EMSCI).28 An illustration of the course of the study and related examinations is given in Figure 1.FIG. 1.Study timeline. Red boxes denote medical diagnostics and the clinical assessment as performed according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI). Blue boxes denote the scheduled visits (acute stage = inpatient treatment; chronic stage = outpatient care). While for the needle electromyography (nEMG) at the acute stage, pathological spontaneous activity at rest (PSA) and increased discharge rates (DR) were assessed, the nEMG at the chronic stage aimed to analyze PSA and motor unit action potential (MUAP) amplitudes. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were only performed at the acute stage. Color image is available online.ParticipantsIndividuals with traumatic or ischemic SCI of any severity (AIS A\u2013D) were identified by consecutive sampling and considered eligible primarily if they presented a neurological level of injury (NLI) between C3\u2013C8. Because of a high number of screening failures (Fig. 2), patients presenting with a NLI above C3 were also considered for inclusion if they had stable spontaneous respiration. Sample size was thus based on the average number of admissions. The detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria included the EMSCI and other additional parameters, all of which are listed in Supplementary Table S1.28 Administered medication that could potentially interfere with motor recovery was recorded. Three individuals received baclofen, another three received opioids, and none received benzodiazepines.FIG. 2.Recruitment flow chart. EMSCI, European Multicenter Study about Spinal Cord Injury; SCI, spinal cord injury; ISNCSCI, International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury; nEMG, needle electromyography.Standardized clinical assessmentNeurological condition was assessed by trained ISNCSCI assessors to ensure high quality standards.29,30 Participants were examined in accordance with the EMSCI time schedule at least once in the acute stage (16\u201340 days) and once in the chronic stage (150\u2013186 or 300\u2013546 days) after SCI (Fig. 1).31 Motor function of the upper extremity key muscles was assessed as muscle strength graded on a six-level scale.32 According to the ISNCSCI rules, the motor level follows the sensory level rostral to C5, which is the most rostral myotome represented by a key upper extremity muscle.Findings at the motor level and one segment caudal to it are referred to as \u201cat-level.\u201d Segments rostral to the motor level are termed \u201cabove-level,\u201d while those more than one segment caudal to the defined motor level are considered as \u201cbelow-level.\u201dCalculation of relative loss of motor function in the upper extremitiesThe relative loss of motor function in the upper extremities was based on the maximum achievable sum scores below the level of injury and the examined sum scores. It was determined according to the following formula: UEMSMAX\u2212UEMSEXAMUEMSMAXx100=LoMF UEMS_MAX stands for the total maximum below-(motor) level upper extremity sum motor score on both sides of the body, UEMS_EXAM for the actual examined below-(motor) level upper extremity sum motor score on both sides of the body at the acute stage, and LoMF for the relative loss of motor function.Assessment of LMN integrityNeedle EMG was chosen to detect signs of LMN dysfunction and performed in five defined key muscles of the dominant arm (C5 to T1) at three different examination sites by two board-certified neurologists.33 With one exception, only upper extremity key muscles according to ISNCSCI were chosen.9 Instead of the flexor digitorum profundus muscle, the abductor pollicis brevis muscle, representing the spinal segment C8, was investigated because of better accessibility for nEMG.34 The biceps brachii muscle (C5), the extensor carpi radialis longus muscle (C6), the triceps brachii muscle (C7), and the abductor digiti minimi muscle (T1) were additionally examined to provide a comprehensive mapping of the segmental innervation in the cervical spinal cord.Care was taken to rule out other causes of nEMG abnormalities such as neuromuscular diseases, polyneuropathy, brachial plexus injury, and any other known lesion of the peripheral nervous system (Supplementary Table 1): (a) past medical history, (b) early MRI to determine apparent cervical nerve root compression (please see next section \u201cMRI processing\u201d), (c) motor nerve conduction studies of the ulnar nerve (EMSCI protocol). In case of pathological findings, sensory nerve conduction studies of the ulnar nerve were added to exclude a subclinical peripheral nerve lesion (Supplementary Table S2).Table 1.Characteristics at the Acute and Chronic Stage According to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury Investigated side of the bodyContralateral side of the bodyIDAISNLIaCauseAcute MLAcute UEMSbChronic UEMSbAcute MScChronic MScAcute MLAcute UEMSbChronic UEMSbAcute MScChronic MSc01AC3TC38122 (0-2)1 (1-5)C3671 (0-1)1 (0-2)02CC4TC44231 (0-1)5 (4-5)C46211 (1-2)4 (4-4)03DC4TC614202 (1-5)4 (4-4)C611181 (0-5)3 (3-4)04DC2TC24241 (1-1)5 (5-5)C413233 (2-3)5 (4-5)05DC5TC717234 (2-5)5 (4-5)C614224 (1-4)4 (4-5)06DC4IC510142 (0-4)4 (0-5)C610142 (0-3)4 (1-4)07CC2IC210232 (2-2)5 (4-5)C27211 (1-2)4 (4-4)08CC1TC10160 (0-0)4 (3-4)C10140 (0-0)4 (1-4)09CC4TC43190 (0-1)4 (4-5)C55131 (0-1)3 (1-4)10BC4TC614154 (1-4)4 (1-5)C58121 (0-3)3 (0-4)11DC4IC615184 (1-4)4 (3-4)C724235 (5-5)5 (4-5)12CC3TC3240 (0-1)1 (1-1)C4321 (0-1)0 (0-1)13DC4TC46111 (1-1)2 (1-4)C618223 (3-4)4 (4-5)14DC4TC614214 (0-5)5 (4-5)C821235 (3-5)5 (4-5)15BC7TC718214 (3-5)5 (4-5)C720224 (4-5)5 (4-5)16CC4TC610201 (0-4)4 (4-4)C57211 (0-2)4 (4-4)17DC3TC322245 (4-5)5 (5-5)C721234 (4-5)5 (4-5)AIS, American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale; NLI, neurological level of injury; Cause, cause of injury; ML, motor level; UEMS, upper extremity motor score; MS, motor score; T, traumatic; I, ischemic. a Defined as the most caudal segment that still has normal function on both sides of the body for both sensory perception and motor function. b Calculated as sum of all scores for upper extremity MS from C5 to T1 on a given side of the body. c Presented as median of the key muscles C5 to T1 on a given side of the body. Interquartile ranges are given in parentheses.To assess dysfunction of LMNs, PSA and discharge rates of MUAPs were determined and evaluated as described previously (Fig. 3A).21\u201323 To eliminate false positives, amplitudes of action potentials below 20 \u03bcV were excluded to minimize the risk of mistaking artifacts or other volume-conducted activity for PSA. Analysis and interpretation of both PSA and MUAP were based on a decomposed train of five matching potentials in accordance with published standards.22,35\u201337FIG. 3.Rostrocaudal distribution of lower motoneuron (LMN) dysfunction. (A) Representative data acquired by needle electromyography (nEMG) comprising normal findings (blue box) and evidence of LMN dysfunction (red box). Evidence of LMN dysfunction is depicted by the detection of pathological spontaneous activity (PSA) or increased discharge rates (DR). (B) Needle-EMG findings of all examined muscles (n = 85) are illustrated in relation to the motor level (x-axis), which is defined as the most caudal myotome with at least antigravity strength and normal motor function rostral to it according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI. \u201cAbove\u201d summarizes all segments at least one level rostral to the motor level. \u201cAt\u201d stands for those segments that are located at or no more than one segment below the motor level, while \u201cBelow\u201d is defined by all the segments that are more than one level below the motor level. The relative distribution of muscles with (red) and without (blue) LMN dysfunction as percentage of all examined muscles is shown in each of the three bars (y-axis). Absolute numbers (n) of muscles are given in respective sections of the bars. Color image is available online.The PSA represent discharges of denervated or damaged (e.g., myopathy) single muscle fibers.21,23 Increased discharge rates are caused by a loss of motor units.22 Both PSA and increased discharge rates indicate LMN dysfunction but may occur independently. Therefore, LMN dysfunction was assumed when PSA and/or discharge rates of MUAPs >20 Hz were detectable. Discharge rates of MUAPs were handled as a binary classifier (\u226420 Hz/>20 Hz). The severity of PSA was graded semi-quantitatively on a four-level ordinal scale from 0 to 3 as described previously.38 The PSA was correlated with the six-level ordinal-scaled motor function of the five key muscles (C5 to T1) defined by ISNCSCI.9Based on relevant literature and broadly accepted routine practice, muscles displaying MUAP amplitudes \u22652 mV (observed in three different MUAPS per muscle; rise time >0.1 msec) were considered to have undergone reinnervation by collateral sprouting as a compensatory mechanism at the chronic stage nEMG.39,40 Needle EMGs were sampled with 10 kHz and decompositioned in a nEMG recording device (Schwarzer Topas, Natus, Munich, Germany). Recordings were done under acoustic control with the following settings: skin temperature >30\u00b0C, (bandpass) filter 5 Hz to 5 kHz, amplification 50 \u03bcV/Div (PSA)/0.1\u20135.0 mV/Div (MUAP), and sweep speed to 10 msec/Div.MRI processingThe anatomical T2-weighted MRIs were acquired on 1.5T and 3T scanners (Siemens: 1xAera, 2xAvanto, 2xEspree, 8xSymphony, 2xTrio, 2xVerio) immediately after admission to the primary care hospital and\u2014if applicable\u2014before spine surgery. The MRI parameters were as follows (see also Supplementary Table S3): slice thickness for the sagittal plane 17x 3.0 mm (turbo spin echo sequence), and for the axial plane 1x 2.0 mm (gradient echo sequence), 11x 3.0 mm (10x turbo spin echo and 1x gradient echo sequence), and 5x 4.0 mm (turbo spin echo sequence).The T2-weighted hyperintense MRI signal changes at the spinal cord lesion site were considered indicative of myelopathy and associated structural damage. Subsequently, the extent of myelopathy was compared with the nEMG findings (Fig. 4) and evaluated for its value in estimating motor recovery. The extent of myelopathy detected by MRI was expressed as percentage of the cross-sectional area of the spinal cord in each segment.FIG. 4.Typical findings of needle electromyography (nEMG) and routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (A) Needle-EMG shows severe (grade 3) pathological spontaneous activity (PSA) in the biceps muscle\u2014the key muscle for segment C5 according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI in an individual with a C4 lesion level. The PSA was characterized by a full interference pattern of abundant PSA in all examined areas. The MRI shows marked myelopathy at the corresponding segmental level of vertebral body C5. (B) At C7 level of the same individual\u2014three segments caudal to the lesion level (C4)\u2014nEMG and MRI are normal. (C) The lower motoneuron (LMN) dysfunction (severe PSA and increased discharge rates [DR] of motor unit action potentials) identified four segments caudal (biceps muscle) to the lesion level C1 in an individual with longitudinally extensive myelopathy at the corresponding level of vertebra C5. Extensive myelopathy was likely caused by an intraspinal hematoma, which compressed the spinal cord beyond the lesion level. Color image is available online.The MRI analysis was performed by a board-certified neuroradiologist and a board-certified neurologist using conventional open-source processing software (DICOM viewer OsiriX Lite, Pixmeo SARL, Bernex, Switzerland). Cervical neuroforamina were analyzed to exclude compression of nerve roots. The spinal cord segmental level (C1-T1) was assigned as a reference to the respective vertebral body25,41: three T2-weighted MRI axial scans per cervical segment were analyzed as a percentage of the cross-sectional area of the spinal cord. For this, the relevant sections of each cervical segment were derived from the scan closest to the cover plate, the mid-level, and the base plate of the respective vertebral body.The area showing hyperintense signal changes representing myelopathy of the spinal cord was marked and normalized by the total cross-sectional area of the spinal cord (Fig. 4). Subsequently, a mean value was calculated from the three obtained percentages of myelopathy for each segment.Finally, the extent of myelopathy for each segment was averaged over both examiners. The following formula summarizes the workflow: myelopathysegment=12\u2211examinerSF,MW13\u2211locationcover,middle,basemyelopathyexaminer,location,segmentcrosssectionexaminer,location,segment. Quantitative variables and groupingThe presence of LMN dysfunction was classified with a binary variable as either negative or positive. It was considered positive in case of PSA >0 and/or discharge rates of single MUAP >20 Hz were detected. For semiquantitative evaluation of PSA, a grading of 2 and 3 reflected moderate to severe LMN dysfunction, whereas a grade of 1 was considered mild LMN dysfunction. Needle EMG findings were grouped by the segmental distance from the ISNCSCI motor level. Negative numbers represent segments rostral to the lesion, whereas positive numbers stand for segments caudal to the lesion.Statistical analysesData were processed, analyzed, and visualized using the Python Data Science Stack, i.e., pandas (data processing),42 matplotlib (visualization),43 and scipy (statistics).44The \u03a72-test was used to test the distribution of LMN dysfunction in the above-level, at-level, and below-level grouping, the association of LMN dysfunction with high amplitudes of MUAPS and motor recovery, as well as subgroup analysis (AIS A/B versus AIS C/D).Spearman's \u03c1 rank correlation coefficient was used to test the association between ordinally distributed variables such as the ISNCSCI motor score or the PSA. Association was interpreted as slight (r \u2265 0.1), moderate (r \u2265 0.3), or strong (r \u2265 0.5).45 Categorical data are presented as median and related interquartile range (IQR) or both 25th and 75th percentiles. Exact p values are reported with \u03b1 <0.05 as threshold for significance.",

The extent of the posterior cervical decompression was based on the intramedullary lesion length (IMLL)\u2014one level of laminectomy was prescribed for each 15 mm (the height of a single vertebral body) of IMLL. Laminectomy was performed in addition to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) or anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion. Decompression was judged adequate if, on post-operative MRI or computed tomography (CT) myelogram, CSF was visualized ventral or dorsal or both ventral and dorsal to the spinal cord.Subjects were excluded if they had only anterior surgery without laminectomy (21 patients) or if they had inadequate laminectomy\u2014i.e., continued compression of the spinal cord at the rostral and/or caudal skeletal segments (10 patients). In addition, patients were excluded if tCSCI was because of penetrating injury (13 patients) and if the level of injury was restricted to upper cervical spine segments (C1/C2, 10 patients). No contrast or MRI studies, spinal epidural hematoma, SCI without radiological abnormality, and non-operative management were other reasons for exclusion (six patients). Post-operative CT myelogram (in three patients) and MRI confirmed adequate laminectomy in 104 patients. The research started after approval by the University of Maryland HRPO, IRB office (HP-00100211).Trauma Resuscitation Unit (TRU)Once the patients were medically stable after initial resuscitation,26 a neurosurgery team (senior resident, nurse practitioners with or without attending neurosurgeon) performs a complete neurological assessment. Admission AMS, AIS grades, neurological level of injury (NLI) are determined according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI).27CT, MRI, and real-time intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS)For patients in this study, multi-planar cervical spine CT scan was performed within a median of 2 h of trauma, and multi-planar multi-sequence T2-weighted and short T1 inversion recovery (STIR) sequences were acquired within a median of 7 h after trauma. We defined the injury type morphology of the cervical spine fracture dislocations according to the Vaccaro and associates28 AO Spine Classification system.Intramedullary lesion length was measured on sagittal T2 and/or STIR MRI.15 Midsagittal CT was compared with midsagittal MRI sequences to determine the adequacy of laminectomy, surgical technique, and the extent of spinal cord decompression after surgery.29 Complete decompression was defined as presence of a cerebrospinal fluid interface ventral, dorsal, or ventral/dorsal surface of the spinal cord and dura continuously from the foramen magnum to the first thoracic vertebra on midsagittal cuts.Two spine fellowship-trained neurosurgeons (KC and CS) and two neurosurgeons (GS and BA) validated the extent of laminectomy and spinal cord decompression after surgery. Any discrepancies were adjudicated by a consensus conference of the four neurosurgeons.15,30 The Principal Investigator (PI) measured the IMLL on pre-operative MRI images.15 From July 2021, we incorporated in situ real-time IOUS in our armamentarium to verify decompression after completion of surgical intervention in patients who had laminectomy. Thus, we could compare decompression via IOUS and post-operative MRI.Blood pressure augmentation and steroid protocolPatients\u2019 mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained between 85 to 90 mm Hg for seven days after trauma when medically feasible.31,32 Steroid protocol has not been in use at this medical center since 2010.29",

C57BL/6 male mice (Charles River) were acquired at \u223cpostnatal Day 35-49 (PN35-P49) and allowed at least 72 h of acclimation before the initiation of any experimental procedures. Mice were group housed in standard cages under a 12 h/12 h light-dark cycle with standard laboratory lighting conditions (lights on, 0600-1800, \u223c200 lux), with ad libitum access to food and water. All procedures were conducted beginning 2-4 h after the start of the light-cycle, unless otherwise noted. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and reduce the number of animals used throughout this study.Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury modelBeginning at \u223cPN56, mice were subjected to either repeated sham or repeated closed-head injury (CHI) delivered by the Impact One, Controlled Cortical Impact (CCI) Device (Leica; Wetzler, Germany) utilizing parameters which were previously described.27 Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3.5% induction/2% maintenance) and fixed into a stereotaxic frame. Specifically, repeated CHI-CCI (mTBI group) consists of five discrete concussive impacts to the head delivered at 24 h intervals generated by an electromagnetically driven piston (4.0 m/sec velocity, 3 mm impact tip diameter, a beveled flat tip, 1.0 mm depth; 200 msec dwell time) targeted to bregma as visualized through the skin overlying the skull following depilation. Sham surgery consisted of identical procedures without delivery of impact. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C throughout by a warming pad and isoflurane exposure and surgery duration was limited to no more than 5 min. Following sham or CHI-CCI surgery completion, mice were immediately placed in a supine position in a clean cage on a warming pad and the latency to self-right was recorded.Recombinant adeno-associated viral vector injectionA separate set of mice were used to inject the AAV into the LHb 2 weeks prior to the CHI-CCI. Seven-week-old mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3.5% induction and 2% maintenance) and fixed into a stereotaxic frame. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C throughout the procedure and during recovery with a heating pad. The scalp was shaved and depilated with Nair\u00a9, and a U-shaped incision between the ears was made on the skin overlying the skull, allowing for the visualization of bregma and lambda sutures during CHI-CCI procedure. Viral vectors were infused (50 nL/side; over 5 min using a Nanoject III Injector, Drummond) using pulled glass pipettes into the LHb (coordinates from bregma: AP, -1.6 mm; ML, \u00b10.5 mm; DV, -3.2 mm). Mice received either AAV8-CaMKII-hM4Di (Gi)-mCherry (Addgene# #50477) or control AAV8-CaMKII-EGFP (Addgene#50469) viral vector for viral expression in glutamatergic LHb neurons. Animals recovered for 10-11 days prior to the initiation of mTBI procedures. Viral expression was confirmed by fluorescence and/or immunohistochemistry at the conclusion of behavioral experiments and mice with no viral expression in the LHb were excluded from data analysis.Sucrose splash testSucrose splash test was performed at 10-12 days following the final mTBI or sham procedure in separate cohorts of sham and mTBI with or without viral injections. For chemogenetic inhibition of LHb activity, we utilized a novel DREADD ligand, JHU37160 28 which has been shown to have high in vivo potency and no off-target effects. Mice that were injected with control or DREADD viral vectors received either 0.3 mg/kg JHU37160 or equivalent volume of vehicle (0.9% saline) intraperitoneally (i.p.) 30-min prior to behavioral testing. The order of drug presentation was cross-balanced within groups across behavioral testing days such that half of a group received vehicle and the other half received JHU37160. This dosage and the timing of administration/behavioral testing was chosen based on pharmacokinetic profile of JHU37160 indicating 30-min post-injection as the optimal time-point where maximal drug concentration in brain is anticipated.28Mice were video monitored throughout the sucrose splash test. Mice were individually introduced to an empty (7 \u00d7 11.5 \u00d7 4.5 inches) clear polycarbonate cage. Following a 10-min baseline assessment of behavioral activity the animal was gently removed from the testing arena, sprayed twice with an atomizer containing 10% sucrose solution onto the dorsal coat, returned to the test arena, and monitored for an additional 5 min. The 10% sucrose solution is a sticky substance that soils the animal's coat, with the typical response being rapid initiation of vigorous grooming behaviors. Video recordings were assessed by an experimenter blinded to the condition of the subjects and scored for total grooming behavior and the latency to initiate the first bout of grooming after sucrose splash. Grooming is considered any movements involving active touching, wiping, scrubbing, or licking of the face, forelimbs, flank, or tail for greater than 3 consecutive seconds.Sucrose preference testA separate cohort of sham and mTBI mice were tested for sucrose preference test 18 days following sham and mTBI surgeries. Mice were first single housed 7 days post-injury and left undisturbed for 5 days. Starting on 12 days post-injury, all mice were presented with ad libitum access to two bottles containing either 1% sucrose solution or water to habituate the animals to the consumption of sucrose and avoid neophobia. After 3 days of habituation, mice returned to ad libitum access to drinking water only. On 18 days post-injury, mice were presented with two bottles at 1800 (start of their dark period); one bottle containing water and the other 1% sucrose solution, and evaluated for sucrose preference. Bottle positions were switched at 2400 to reduce any confound produced by side bias. Total consumption of each fluid was measured by weight the following day at 0600 (end of the dark period) and sucrose preference was calculated as the percentage of sucrose intake over the total fluid consumption during the 12 h test. Throughout habituation days, bottles were counterbalanced daily to the left/right position to avoid a side-bias.Slice preparationMice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and immediately transcardially perfused with ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 126 NaCl, 21.4 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 2.4 CaCl2, 1.00 MgSO4, 11.1 glucose, 0.4 ascorbic acid; saturated with 95% O2-5% CO2. Brain tissue was kept on ice-cold aCSF and tissue sections containing LHb were sectioned at 220 \u03bcm using a vibratome (Leica; Wetzler, Germany) and subsequently incubated in aCSF at 34\u00b0C for at least 1 h prior to electrophysiological experiments. For patch clamp recordings, slices were then transferred to a recording chamber and perfused with ascorbic-acid free aCSF at 28-30\u00b0C.ElectrophysiologyVoltage-clamp cell-attached and voltage/current-clamp whole-cell recordings were performed from LHb neurons in sagittal slices containing LHb using patch pipettes (3-6 MOhms) and a patch amplifier (MultiClamp 700B) under infrared-differential interference contrast microscopy. Data acquisition and analysis were carried out using DigiData 1440A, pCLAMP 10 (Molecular Devices), Clampfit, Origin 2016 (OriginLab), and Mini Analysis 6.0.3 (Synaptosoft, Inc.). Signals were filtered at 3 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz.To assess LHb spontaneous activity, cells were patch clamped with potassium gluconate-based internal solution (130 mM K-gluconate, 15 mM KCl, 4 mM adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-Na+, 0.3 mM guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-Na+, 1 mM EGTA, and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.28, 275-280 mOsm) in slices perfused with aCSF. Spontaneous neuronal activity and AP firing patterns (tonic, bursting) were assessed in both cell-attached recordings in voltage-clamp mode at V = 0 and whole-cell recording in current-clamp mode at I = 0 for \u223c1-min recording as previously described.29,30 Spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs and sIPSCs) were recorded within the same LHb neuron in voltage clamp mode with a cesium-methanesulfonate (CsMeS)\u2013based internal solution in intact synaptic transmission over 10 sweeps, each lasting 50 sec (a total of 500 sec continuous recording for either sEPSC or sIPSC). Patch pipettes were filled with CsMeS internal solution (140 mM CsMeS, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP-Na+, 0.2 mM GTP-Na+, 0.2 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.28, osmolality 275-280 mOsm) as previously described.31 Cells were voltage-clamped at -55 mV to record sEPSCs and +10 mV to record spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) within the same neuron, as previously described.32 The mean excitation/inhibition (sE/I) of spontaneous synaptic activity were calculated as sEPSC/sIPSC amplitude or frequency ratios from the same recording. The mean synaptic drive ratio was calculated as (sEPSC frequency \u00d7 amplitude)/(sIPSC frequency \u00d7 amplitude). To create histograms and cumulative probability plots for sE/I amplitude and frequency ratios and synaptic drive ratio, we adopted a novel quantitative approach33 by randomly selecting 10 sEPSC and 10 sIPSC recordings (each lasting 15 sec) over each sweep of the 50s recording in each cell and calculated the ratios between sEPSC and sIPSC over 15 sec recordings. Therefore, for each cell, the combination of 10 sEPSC and 10 sIPSC yielded 100 data points (100 sE/I amplitude or frequency or synaptic drive ratios as calculated for the mean ratio values).Whole-cell recordings of AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were isolated in aCSF perfused with picrotoxin (100 \u03bcM), D-APV (50 \u03bcM) and TTX (1 \u03bcM) and internal solution containing 117 mM Cs-gluconate, 2.8 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP-Na+, 0.3 mM GTP-Na+, 0.6 mM EGTA, and 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.28, 275-280 mOsm). Whole-cell recordings of GABAAR-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were isolated in aCSF perfused with DNQX; 10 \u03bcM, strychnine (1 \u03bcM) and tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 \u03bcM). Patch pipettes were filled with 125 mM KCl, 2.8 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP-Na+, 0.3 mM GTP-Na+, 0.6 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.28, 275-280 mOsm). For both mIPSCs and mEPSCs, LHb neurons were voltage-clamped at -70 mV and recorded over 10 sweeps, each lasting 50 sec. The cell input resistance and series resistance were monitored through all the experiments and if these values changed by more than 10%, data were not included.Statistical analysisValues are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean. The threshold for significance was set at p < 0.05 for all analyses. All statistical analyses of data were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.4.1. For detecting the difference in distribution of silent, tonic or bursting LHb neurons in sham and mTBI mice, we used chi-squared tests. For the effects of mTBI on mean values of sEPSC, sIPSC, mEPSC, mIPSC, sE/I ratios, synaptic drive ratios, and sucrose splash test without viral injections, we used unpaired Student's t test. Sucrose preference test results were analyzed by a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Mini Analysis software was used to detect and measure sEPSC and sIPSC amplitude and frequency (inter-event interval), as well as mEPSC and mIPSC amplitude, charge transfer (area under the curve), decay time constants (Tau) and frequency (inter-event interval) using preset detection parameters of spontaneous or mini events with an amplitude cutoff of 5 pA. Effects of mTBI on the cumulative probabilities data sets were analyzed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Effects of mTBI and JHU37160 during splash test were analyzed using two-way ANOVA tests with Sidak's post hoc test.",
    "PMC9689772": "MethodsPluripotent stem cell culturesHuman pluripotent stem cells (H9, WA09, WiCell) were cultured feeder-free and maintained on Matrigel\u2122 (BDBiosciences, 354230, growth factor reduced) coated plates in mTeSR-1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies, 05850) plus 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies, 15070).Generation of cerebral organoidsCerebral organoids were generated following previously published methods.30,31 Briefly, pallial and subpallial spheroids were generated from pluripotent stem (PS) cells and assembled in vitro to replicate the development of the human cerebral cortex. Pallial spheroids were generated by plating dissociated PS cells into ultra-low attachment 96 well plates to form embryoid bodies in neuro induction medium (NIM) containing 20 \u03bcM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632, Selleckchem #S1049). NIM contains: DMEM-F12 (Invitrogen) with KnockOut Serum Replacement (20%, Invitrogen), GlutaMAX (1:100, Invitrogen), MEM-NEAA (1:100, Gibco), 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mM, Gibco), penicillin and streptomycin (1%, Sigma). Dorsomorphin (10 \u03bcM, Sigma) and SB-431542 (10 \u03bcM, Tocris) were added for the first 6 days for neural induction. Spheroids were transferred to neural medium (NM) containing Neurobasal A (Gibco, 10888) with B27 supplement (- Vitamin A, Invitrogen), GlutaMAX (1:100, Invitrogen), penicillin and streptomycin (1%, Sigma). For neural progenitor expansion, NM was supplemented daily with fibroblast growth factor (20 ng/mL, Peprotech) and epidermal growth factor (20 ng/mL, Peprotech) for 10 days, then every other day for 9 days. For neural differentiation of pallial spheroids, NM was supplemented with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (20 ng/mL, Peprotech) and NT3 (20 ng/mL, Peprotech) every other day until Day 43. After Day 43, all spheroids were maintained in NM without factors.For development of subpallial spheroids, were prepared as above. However, beginning at Day 4, Wnt pathway was inhibited by adding IWP-2 (5 \u03bcM, Selleckchem) to the NIM and NM media. On Day 12, sonic hedgehog pathway was activated by adding SAG (100 nM, Selleckchem) together with IWP-2 until Day 24. After Day 24, subpallial spheroids were maintained in the same conditions as pallial spheroids.Cerebral organoids were formed by a fusion of the pallial and subpallial spheroids to mimic development of the human cerebral cortex. On Day 43, pallial and subpallial spheroids were transferred into a single well of a 24 well plate and pushed together. The plate was tilted and placed in the incubator for 5-7 days. Media was carefully changed every 4 days. Once complete cerebral organoid fusion occurred, the 24 well plate was returned to a rotating shaker in the incubator and NM without factors was changed 3 days a week.Tabletop \u201cblast\u201d deviceQuasi-hydrostatic pressure waves were delivered by a previously developed tabletop \u201cblast\u201d device.29 Pressure loading in this device can be considered as quasi-hydrostatic for the following reason: pressure waves travel at the speed of sound in water (\u223c1480 m/sec), and the length of the pressure chamber is nearly 30 mm. In consequence, any change in pressure takes around 20 \u03bcs to completely homogenize inside the chamber. The characteristic frequency of an event of this speed is around 50 kHz. This frequency is 10 times as fast as the fastest frequency used in this study (5 kHz). To introduce high frequency pressure wave onto cerebral organoids, prewarmed and CO2 buffered NM was added to the \u201cblast\u201d chamber (3-5 mL). Organoids from a single experimental group were added together into the \u201cblast\u201d chamber where it was then closed and sealed without introducing any air bubbles. The chamber was then installed into the support frame.A user-defined excitation voltage profile was used to drive a piezoelectric actuator and create a pressure waveform within the chamber at 500 Hz, 3000 Hz, or 5000 Hz frequency for a duration of 8 msec. For the readability, these three frequency levels will be referred hereafter simply as Low group, Mid group, and High group, with the implicit understanding that the terms refer to the abovementioned three loading frequency levels. In this study, this frequency space was examined at \u201cthreshold\u201d of 250 kPa (as previously proposed)5,21 or \u201csuprathreshold\u201d of 350 kPa pressure wave amplitude. Because the chamber is filled with a nearly incompressible liquid (culture medium), organoids inside are equally exposed to similar over pressure profiles. For \u201cno blast\u201d controls, organoids were loaded and sealed into \u201cblast\u201d chamber, but the actuator was not activated. After exposure (\u223c30 sec process to load and unload), organoids were removed and plated onto a multi-electrode array (MEA) for functional recordings. The integrated blast overpressure for each pressure wave form was calculated numerically using the trapezoidal rule (Python function numpy.trapz).MEA recordings and custom analysisFused cerebral organoids were plated onto a 24-well MEA plate (24W700/100F-288, Multichannel Systems) previously coated with 10 \u03bcg/mL poly-L-ornithin (Sigma, P3655) and 5 \u03bcg/mL laminin (Invitrogen, 23017-015). At the bottom of each well of the MEA plate is 12 gold electrodes 100 \u03bcm in diameter spaced 700 \u03bcm apart. Prior to plating organoids, fresh NM was added to each well and allowed to buffer in 5% CO2 for 30 min. MEA recordings were acquired with the Multiwell-Screen Acquisition software (Multichannel Systems, v1.11.7.0). For raw electrographic data, organoids were plated immediately after \u201cblast\u201d and the plate was placed on the MEA for 1 h before the first recording. 37\u00b0C incubation temperature and 5% CO2 was maintained the entire time. All recordings acquired were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered with a band-pass filter of 1 Hz-3500 Hz for 2 min.Event detectionAutomatic event detection was performed using the Multiwell-Analyzer (Multichannel Systems, v.1.8.6.0). For single unit events, a bandpass filter from 100 Hz-3500 Hz with a second order Butterworth filter. Single unit events were detected based on 5 standard deviations of estimated noise from each active electrode. For population events, a bandpass filter from 1 Hz-3500 Hz with a second order Butterworth filter was applied and event detection criteria was based on 15 standard deviations of baseline noise. Single unit and population events are reduced in response to bath application of the voltage-gated sodium channel antagonist lithium chloride (data unpublished). For all organoids, active electrodes were defined by visual mapping of contacted channels. Electrodes without contact with organoid were not included in the data set. Event amplitude and frequency were calculated by Multiwell-Analyzer. For visualization, event data was exported to .csv files and plotted using custom Python code with matplotlib, scipy, and numpy libraries.Power spectral analysisTo compute the power spectral density, 5-sec epochs from active channels were exported to .csv files and transformed using a discrete Fourier Transform (numpy.fft) and averaged peak power (scipy.signal.find_peaks). Signal frequency was visualized in the time domain using the spectrogram function (scipy.signal.spectrogram). Computation and analysis were adapted from published neural data repository.34 Power data was normalized to the corresponding control group.Network synchrony analysisFor network synchrony, 2-sec epochs from two selected channels of unfiltered timeseries data was exported and analyzed using Python code adapted from Mike X Cohen.35 A Fourier Transform was performed on the raw data and convolved using a complex Morlet Wavelet convolution (10 Hz). The phase angle was computed for both channels from the phase angle complex convolution (numpy.angle). Phase synchronization was calculated by the difference between phase angles of the selected channels. This value is bound between 0 and 1, with values close to 1 indicating greater synchrony.ImmunohistochemistryAll organoids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and transferred to 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline until sectioned. To section, organoids were embedded in tissue freezing medium and frozen. Serial sections were taken at 16 \u03bcm and mounted on a glass slide. All sectioned organoids were stored at -20\u00b0C until stained. For immunohistochemistry, all slides were washed with 1 \u00d7 Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a 3% normal goat serum blocking solution. The primary antibody was incubated on the slide overnight at 4\u00b0C. Primary antibodies used in this study include mouse anti-TUJ1 (Santa Cruz, sc-80005; 1:500) and rabbit anti-activated caspase 3 (Millipore Sigma, AB3623; 1:500). The primary antibody was washed with 1 \u00d7 TBS and the fluorescent secondary antibody was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibodies used in this study were anti-mouse FITC (ThermoFisher, F-2761; 1:500) and anti-rabbit TxRed (Vector, TI-1000-1.5). After the secondary was washed, DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamindino-2-phenylindole; ThermoFisher, D1306; 1:10,000) was added for 5 min to visualize nuclei. Slides were cover slipped with mounting medium and dried before imaging.Microscopy and imagingFluorescent images were acquired on a widefield epifluorescence (Leica, DM2000) or confocal microscope (Nikon A1). Exposure times were consistent for each channel throughout all samples. For AC3 analysis, area of staining was measured using ImageJ software (v1.53k; National Institutes of Health). Briefly, the pixel area of each organoid was measured. Using built in threshold tools, the pixel area of AC3 staining was measured and subtracted from the total area of the organoid. This percentage is represented in the data as % AC of area.Statistical analysisData are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM), unless indicated otherwise. Statistical differences comparing means were analyzed using a two-tailed Student's t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) for data with equal variances. Tukey's multiple comparisons test for ANOVA were used to determine difference between groups and is indicated by an asterisk and black bar. Pearson's chi-squared test (\u03a72) was used for data sets where control data was measured at zero. For all data sets, statistical outliers were excluded using Grubbs' test for outliers. All data was collected and analyzed at one time. All statistics were performed using GraphPad with Prism 8.4.3, following Statistics Guide.Data and code availabilityAll data supporting the findings in this study are provided within the paper. All additional information will be made available upon reasonable request to the authors. Custom MEA Analysis code was written in Python (v.3.10.1).36",

    "PMC9689773": "MethodsLiterature search and systematic review selection criteriaA comprehensive literature search of five databases (MEDLINE\u00ae, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and SportDiscus) was performed on January 31, 2020, to identify studies that met the following inclusion criteria: Subjects had TBI or subconcussive hits/repetitive head impactsAny type of MRS (single-voxel or magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging)All ages, males and/or female subjectsAny field strengthManuscripts were in the English languageStudies were excluded if subjects were diagnosed with traumatic encephalopathy syndrome, as this is a distinct diagnosis.121 Additionally, review articles and gray literature (e.g., conference abstracts, government publications, unpublished trial data, dissertations/theses, letters, or editorials) were excluded. For complete search details, please see Supplementary Tables S1\u2013S5.Two independent reviewers (J.M.J. and P.L.L.) completed all abstract and full-text screening using the Covidence platform.22 Discrepancies were resolved by a third, independent reviewer (A.D.H.). The protocol for our systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/; registration CRD42020167259). This article was written in accordance with the most recent 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.Meta-analysis selection criteriaThe meta-analyses were performed on NAA, Cho, Cr, Glx, and mI, as there is an abundance of 1H MRS and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) literature for these metabolites in TBI. Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they met inclusion criteria for the systematic review, had a control group, and reported either water- or creatine-referenced (Cr-referenced) metabolite levels or fully quantified metabolite levels. Details on quantification approach criteria can be found in the Data extraction section.Studies that examined only the less commonly studied nuclei (31P, 13C) and other metabolites available in 1H spectroscopy were excluded from meta-analyses. Studies that lacked consistent, anatomically defined regions of interest for voxel placement (i.e., were placed in a lesion), case series (n < 5 in control or TBI group) and studies that had metabolite values that were either not reported or unextractable, were also excluded. For studies that were identifiably from the same study sample, only the study with the largest sample size was included in the meta-analysis.Data extractionReviewers J.M.J. and P.L.L. independently extracted all data from the included studies using a customized data extraction form (see Supplementary Table S6). If studies reported metabolite values in a table or in the text, values were extracted directly. For studies that did not report metabolite values but included bar graphs that displayed the metabolite mean and standard deviation or scatter plots, WebPlotDigitizer23 was used to manually extract data. Some studies subdivided TBI groups by good and poor health outcomes or other clinical measures. In such cases, we combined the mean and standard deviation of TBI subgroups for comparison with controls using the formula described in the most recent edition of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.24 A comprehensive list of all variables extracted is reported in Table S6. Often, Glu and Gln are reported as a combined Glx signal because the signals are highly overlapped, although it is known that Glu is more concentrated and dominates the Glx signal (see Table 1). The majority of studies reported Glx; however, if data were reported for Glu alone, this was included in the Glx meta-analysis.Brain injury severity was classified based on the severity description reported in the original research articles; subconcussive hits (subconcussive hits + repetitive head impacts), mild TBI, moderate/severe TBI, and mixed TBI (mild + moderate/severe TBI). As MRS studies often combined moderate and severe TBI data, these categories were merged into a single moderate/severe TBI group. If severity was not specifically indicated, it was defined using Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores (mild = GCS 13\u201315, moderate = GCS 9\u201312, severe TBI = GCS <9).8 Time since injury was defined as the mean time since injury to MRS scan as reported by the study. We further categorized data into hyperacute (within 72 h), acute (> 72 h\u20132 weeks), subacute (> 2 weeks\u20133 months) and chronic (> 3 months) phases. Age was defined as the mean age of the sample. Sex was defined as the percentage of males within the study. Brain regions and tissue composition (white matter dominant, gray matter dominant, or mixed white+gray matter) were defined by the description provided in the original research articles. If no description was explicitly provided, brain regions and tissue composition were categorized by visually inspecting figures with voxel placements and comparison with similar voxel placements from other articles. Generally, one of three quantification approaches were used across the studies included in the meta-analysis including: (1) Cr-referencing, (2) water-referencing assuming constant parameters in the voxel, thus reporting metabolite levels in institutional units (i.u.), in this article, which will be referred to as relative water-referenced data, and (3) complete tissue correction, which includes accounting for differential T1, T2, and water density in white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), here referred to as absolute (Abs) quantification. Another quantification method is to use an external solution reference, in which a phantom solution that contains metabolites with known concentration is scanned and used as a reference for metabolite quantification. Because of the challenges associated with this approach,17 only one study54 included in this review had used this approach. See the consensus paper by Near and coworkers for additional details on complete tissue correction and external solution references.17Statistical analysisOur primary analyses were quantitative comparisons of metabolite levels in brain-injured subjects relative to controls, with brain region as a subgroup. Nine brain regions were defined: frontal, frontoparietal, parietal, parietooccipital, occipital, temporal, subcortical, corpus callosum, and cerebellum. We used five distinct random-effects models (restricted maximum likelihood method) to generate the mean effect size (Hedges' g and 95% confidence interval [CI]) of brain injury on NAA, Cho, Cr, Glx, and mI levels in each brain region of interest and across all brain regions. Whole-brain MRSI metabolite measures were not evaluated as a subgroup in our regional analysis, as our primary interest was to explore whether metabolite alterations in brain injury differ by brain region.Between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statistic. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for each metabolite using the leave-one-out method. Small study effects were examined using Egger's test and through visual inspection of funnel plots.Univariate meta-regression was used to assess other potential moderators of metabolite levels including injury severity, time since injury, age, sex, tissue type (white matter dominant, gray matter dominant, mixed tissue), field strength, echo time (TE), quantification approach (absolute compared with relative water-referencing or Cr-referencing), and year of publication. Studies that did not report a moderator of interest were excluded from that specific moderator analysis. In the moderator analyses, we tested whether a moderator impacted the detection of group differences. The exception was for the quantification approach. As absolute quantification is generally recommended,17 this moderator analysis compared whether relative water- and Cr-referencing results showed different effects than absolute quantification (basis of comparison). A common study design included multiple time point measurements for the brain-injured group (i.e., longitudinal) and a single measurement for the controls. When this study design was used, we used only the time point of the brain-injured group with the largest sample size to avoid repeated sampling of the control group in moderator analyses. However, for the time since injury meta-regression, the concern of repeated sampling was outweighed by the bias toward larger sample sizes at more acute visits and the desire to have as much data across time points as possible. Therefore, we included all time points to avoid undue sampling bias toward more acute visits that were less likely to have dropouts. Following standard practice for both the primary and moderator analyses, subgroups with fewer than two metabolite measurements were excluded. All statistical analyses were performed in STATA/BE 17.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX). Risk of bias assessment The National Institutes of Health (NIH) quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies was used to assess the risk of bias of all studies included in meta-analyses. This tool is composed of 14 yes/no questions designed to assess the risk of bias. The quality rating was assigned as good/fair/poor and was completed by two independent reviewers (J.M.J. and P.L.L.) and conflicts were resolved by a third individual (A.D.H). Assessment of the quality of data was based on current standards in the field.17,18",

    "PMC9529313": "MethodsThe reporting of this study is in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR),29 with an additional study screening and selection flowchart (Fig. 1) as recommended by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and PRISMA-ScR reporting guidelines.29\u201331 Unlike systematic reviews, scoping reviews do not require an antecedent protocol registration,32 notwithstanding, review objectives, eligibility criteria, and preliminary study characteristics to be extracted were determined a priori.FIG. 1.Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flowchart detailing the study selection process.Our scoping review was guided by the comprehensive scoping review framework by Arksey and O'Malley,33 with minor refinements, including those suggested by Levac and colleagues34 and the JBI.30 This framework includes: (1) identifying the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) study selection; (4) charting the data; (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting the results; and an optional (6) consultation exercise. This review serves as part of a wider program of work in which stakeholders (neurotrauma physicians) are formally engaged in a separate qualitative research process, examining their views, experiences, and opinions of FUTs as applied to post-TBI care provision. Prior to commencing the review, we shared similar perceptions to those of Levac and colleagues34 regarding the challenges of conducting and integrating the results of stakeholder consultation within a review's findings. In light of this, and given the potential of qualitative inquiry to empower rich and in-depth investigations of the human experience,35 stage 6 was not carried out within this review. Notwithstanding, the lead author (BGS) discussed findings with senior co-authors, who by their nature as LMIC neurosurgeons are stakeholders within this context.Research questionWhat research has been conducted to describe, examine, or assess the use of follow-up technologies in traumatic brain injury cohorts worldwide?To answer this question, the following sub-questions were posed: 1.What technologies are being used as FUTs in a global setting?2.In what settings is FUT research being conducted?3.What patient cohorts (demographics, injury severity) have been included in FUT research?4.What factors may constitute successful implementation of FUTs?5.What, if any, validated outcome measures are being deployed via FUTs?Search strategyThe final search strategy was determined with the assistance of an academic medical librarian following a consultation to derive keywords based on the review objective and concepts of \u201ctelemedicine,\u201d \u201ctraumatic brain injury,\u201d \u201coutcome assessment,\u201d and \u201cpatient-generated health data.\u201d The authors selected a number of \u201cindicator papers\u201d\u2014predefined articles that one would expect to appear in their final search results\u2014to test the quality and robustness of the search strategy. Several pilot searches were attempted before a final strategy was established and translated across a number of databases. The search strategy was executed on the October 1, 2021 on the following electronic databases: OVID Embase, OVID MEDLINE, OVID Global Health, OVID PsycInfo, and Scopus. An example search strategy for OVID MEDLINE can be found in Supplementary Table S2. These databases were selected owing to their sufficient coverage given the multi-disciplinary nature of TBI, outcomes, and their assessment. A limited manual search was conducted on Google Scholar and a number of technology- and head-injury focused journals (Journal of Neurotrauma, The Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation, World Neurosurgery, NEUROSURGERY, Journal of Medical Internet Research, Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare).Following a pre-protocol pilot gray literature search, it became apparent that, of the limited materials retrieved, most were unsuitable for a number of reasons, including: insufficient indication of external peer review (of particular importance in commercial reports); a lack of FUT description or elucidation of the methods of their use; and description or evaluation of the FUT was not perceived to be the primary focus of the resource. Compounded by the resource- and time-intensive nature of conducting a gray literature search in this context, gray literature sources were omitted in the final search strategy. Finally, backward citation searching was undertaken, whereby the reference lists of articles deemed eligible for inclusion, and review articles that were not eligible for inclusion, were screened for relevant studies. Searching for additional sources was completed on April 25, 2022.Eligibility criteriaScientific articles reporting original research of the application of technology written in English were included. All databases were searched from inception to achieve the largest scope possible and to detail early innovations in this field.The Population/Participants, Concept & Context (PCC) framework36,37 was used to inform our inclusion criteria, search, and data charting strategies.Eligibility criteria for articles to be included in this review were: (1) any published original research, including: primary studies, reports, editorials, opinion articles, letters, conference abstracts, theses, and book chapters; (2) reports with a primary aim to describe, assess, or examine the use of FUTs to facilitate remote collection of patient outcome data; and (3) adult and pediatric all-severity cohorts of TBI patients. Articles were excluded if they were (1) study protocols or secondary research (reviews); (2) reports describing the collection of family or caregiver outcomes only; or (3) no TBI population or involved healthy volunteers only.Population/ParticipantsStudies were only eligible for inclusion in this review if their primary aim related to the development, implementation, or validation of technologies contributing to the provision of follow-up care of discharged patients following TBI of any severity, whether directly or via proxy (family members/relatives, caregivers, and guardians). Studies of mixed-pathology cohorts were included.ConceptIn this review, we defined follow-up technology as any system, device, equipment, component, or machinery used to both transmit and receive digital information electronically between a remote outpatient or their proxy and a member of their clinical team. The focus of this exchange was to attain data from the patient as to their current welfare status in the form of either patient-generated health data (PGHD), that is, self-reported, or clinician-derived health data (CDHD), that is, garnered through clinician-led assessment or interview, either from the patient or their nominated proxy. In addition, we defined \u201cremote\u201d as, at the time of information exchange, the patient was in a community-based setting (e.g., home, regional care provider such as a general practitioner or regional hospital, or other public settings) at a distance from the clinical team managing their follow-up.Herein, we refer to synchronicity as the temporal aspect of the encounter between clinician and patient. Synchronous FUTs function to collect data in real time, often allowing direct contact between clinician and patient through sensor-, text-, voice-, or video-based technology. Asynchronous FUTs collect data by store-and-forward techniques\u2014data are gathered, stored, and transmitted for later review by the clinician at two independent time-points; that is, they do not interact in real time.38Finally, we define \u201cfollow-up\u201d as any attempt to monitor, assess, communicate, or liaise with a patient, or their proxy, from the point of hospital discharge, for the benefit of furthering their health and well-being, research, or injury surveillance.ContextFUTs utilized in any global health settingWe utilized HIC and LMIC classifications as defined by the 2021\u20132022 World Bank list of economies.39Study selectionA two-stage screening process was followed. All search results were initially imported into the Zotero (Corporation for Digital Scholarship, Virginia, USA) reference manager for title and abstract review. Where necessary, duplicates were removed manually. Two researchers (BGS and ST) independently screened all titles and abstracts, and potentially eligible studies were identified for full-text review.Disagreements arising from the selection process were either resolved by consensus, or where this was not possible, a third reviewer (OM) was consulted for resolution. Following preliminary screening, the remaining articles were exported to Microsoft\u00ae Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA), where full texts were independently screened by two researchers (BGS and ST) for final eligibility; a third researcher (OM) was consulted for disagreements as required. Selected studies formed the final repository of evidence for subsequent data extraction (charting) and collation.Data charting and synthesis of resultsOwing to the exploratory nature of a scoping review, a precursor proforma was developed to facilitate data extraction. Within this document, initial elements of interest that sought to answer our research question were informed by our PCC framework and agreed upon by researcher consensus (BGS, ST, CJW, AGK). The proforma was subdivided into five key sections, including: authorship and study characteristics, description of neurotrauma, characteristics of FUT(s) utilized, and major findings and challenges. This was iteratively updated and refined as the charting process progressed, adding to pre-identified elements of interest (see Supplementary Table S1). Data charting was conducted independently for all articles by two researchers (BGS and ST). Following the charting of the first five studies, in line with recommendations by Levac and colleagues,34 the authors reconvened to ensure proforma suitability in addressing the research question, and to advance the proforma following familiarization with this initial subset of studies. Final completed proformas were cross-checked for conformity, and a third researcher (OM) was consulted as necessary in cases of a dispute. No formal critical appraisal, or quality of evidence assessment, was conducted as it would fall beyond the remit of a scoping review.40 Following data charting, a narrative summary of included articles was constructed in relation to the review's overarching question and sub-questions.",

    "PMC9529302": "MethodsStudy design and settingThis prospective multi-center cohort study was conducted across seven Canadian academic EDs (Level I and Level II trauma centers). Patients in the derivation cohort were recruited between July 2013 and October 2016, and those in the validation cohort were recruited between February 2017 and September 2018. This study was approved by each participating institution's research ethics board.Study populationPatients were included if they had a documented mTBI within 24 h of ED visit and were age \u226514 years. We defined mTBI using the World Health Organization Task Force criteria74: a patient with a head trauma and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13-15 \u2265 30 min post-injury and at least one of the following: confusion or disorientation, loss of consciousness \u226430 min, post-traumatic amnesia \u226424 h, and/or other transient neurological abnormalities such as focal signs, seizure, and intracranial lesion not requiring surgery. Patients were excluded if they were hospitalized, were unable to consent, or were not able to communicate in English or French.Data collectionAssessment in the EDEligible patients were identified by emergency physicians and research assistants at each participating site. During the initial ED visit, the emergency physicians used a standardized data collection form (Supplementary File S1) to collect relevant sociodemographic and clinical data, including the time of trauma. Informed consent was provided during the initial visit before the blood samples were taken. The blood samples were taken for all patients in our cohort for research purposes. The decision to perform a head CT scan was left to the emergency physician, and patients were included whether they had a CT or not.Patient follow-upTrained research assistants administered phone interviews at 7, 30, and 90 days post-mTBI (Supplementary File S2). During the 7-day interview, research assistants collected detailed information about the trauma and the medical history of patients to optimize data completeness and accuracy (Supplementary File S3). The Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ), which is frequently used in the clinical and research settings,2,3,6,9,13,16,21,52,75,76 was used to evaluate the patient's symptoms at each interview. This simple validated questionnaire assesses the severity of PCS by having patients rate 16 symptoms on a scale of 0 (not experienced at all) to 4 (a severe problem), with the total score being the sum of all RPQ items.77-79Blood sampling and analysisThe exact time of blood sample collection was recorded for each participant. These samples were taken by the ED nurse \u226424 h after the trauma in most of the study's recruiting sites (4/7). This was done only on weekdays by a research nurse for the other participating sites. The samples were sent to the laboratories of each hospital to be centrifuged, put into three small aliquots and frozen at -20\u00b0C until they were sent on dry ice to the study's central laboratory (CHU de Qu\u00e9bec-Universit\u00e9 Laval, Quebec City), where they were stored at -80\u00b0C until batch tested.The blood concentrations of S100\u00df, NSE, GFAP, and C-Tau were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For each biomarker, different cut-offs were tested during our statistical analyses, including those most often described in the literature: S100B \u2265 0.10 mcg/L80 and \u22650.20 mcg/L,81 NSE \u22651.0 mcg/L,82 and C-Tau \u22651.5 mcg/L.83 For GFAP, no cut-off point has been established related to PPCS,84 we have therefore tested \u22650.045 mcg/L (detection limit of our ELISA assays) and \u22650.1 mcg/L (another limit of detection described in the literature).85Primary outcome measureUntil recently,86 there was no consensus in the literature regarding the diagnostic criteria of PPCS.87 Therefore, we used a nominal croup technique to define our primary outcome, PPCS at 90 days. This technique allows participants to give their opinions during a structured group interaction and comprises four key stages: silent generation, round-robin, clarification, and voting (ranking or rating).88 In our study, PPCS was defined as the presence of spontaneously described, severe, persistent symptoms that have an impact on patient's life. Symptoms were considered spontaneously described if patients mentioned symptoms following a standardized interview prompt (\u201cI would like to know whether you still have any symptoms from your head trauma?\u2019\u2019 The research assistant completed the RPQ as per standard questionnaire administration guidelines if patients answered positively. If patients responded negatively, their symptoms were not considered spontaneously described. Symptoms were considered severe if patients answered that they had at least one symptom of 4 points (severe problem) or two symptoms of 3 points (moderate problems), as scored on the RPQ. Symptoms were considered persistent if they lasted at least 90 days. To ensure that the symptoms were not newly present at 90 days, patients had to spontaneously answer that they had symptoms at 7 and 30 days.As no specific measure of impact was available in the derivation cohort, symptoms were considered as having an impact if patients who were working/in school at the time of trauma did not return to work/studies as before the trauma. In the validation cohort, the measure of the impact on the patient's life was obtained by asking the following questions: \u201cDid you return to your normal activities just as before the head trauma? If not, is this due to your trauma to the head?\u201d A positive answer to the latter question was considered as having an impact on the patient's life.Secondary outcome measuresSecondary outcome measures were PPCS at 90 days according to four other sets of criteria used in the literature: 1.Delphi definition: \u201cAny post-concussion symptom appeared within hours of mTBI which is still present every day 90 days after the trauma and has an impact on at least one sphere of life.\u201d862.PPCS with a documented impact: impact on normal activities due to mTBI, according to the patient.3.Non-return to work: patients working/in school at the time of trauma and did not return to work/studies as before trauma.4.Moderate-to-severe symptoms: the presence of at least three symptoms of 3 or 4 points on the RPQ, indicating a moderate-to-severe intensity level.Sample sizeDerivation cohortBased on the literature, the proportion of patients with PPCS at 90 days was estimated to be around 13-62%.2,3,7\u201321 Assuming a middle range of 35%, 16 potential candidate predictors, a precision of 5% and at least 10 events per covariable, we estimated that 468 observations were required to develop the model.Validation cohortAs the prevalence of PPCS at 90 days was 15.6% in our derivation cohort, for an accurate estimation of regression coefficients, assuming 10 events per covariable and a final model including eight predictors in the ED, we estimated that a minimum of 550 observations were required to validate the model. For the second step, five predictors at follow-up), assuming a prevalence of 18% of PPCS in that sub-group, a precision of 5% and at least 10 events per covariable, we estimated that a minimum of 275 observations were required.Statistical analysisWe used the methodological standards89,90 to develop and validate our CDR. Descriptive statistics were computed for baseline characteristics. The prevalence of PPCS has been reported as the proportion of participants corresponding to each definition. Univariate analyses were performed to measure the association between each potentially predictive factor and the primary outcome (odds ratio [OR] with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]). Multiple imputation was used to handle missing data for potential predictors in the ED: the chained equations method was used to simulate missing values, and 20 imputed datasets were generated for the following variables: cervical sprain, history of mental health disorders, prior multiple TBI and prior TBI <1 year.A two-step bootstrap sampling with replacement was used to select variables of interest.91 For each step, 500 random samples were generated for each imputation and variables that were statistically significant in more than 40% of samples (alpha = 0.157) were considered relevant to be tested in the model. Backward selection was used to validate candidate predictors before using them in the final logistic regression model (alpha = 0.157). Selected predictors were screened for multi-collinearity. Coefficient rating was standardized using the smaller value of the coefficient.92 Thirty-day follow-up data were used if they were missing for patients who were not reached at the 7-day follow-up (simple imputation). Sensitivity analyses were performed to test different categories for the following variables: age, number of prescribed medications, headache intensity (out of 10), loss of consciousness duration, amnesia duration, RPQ, and different blood levels for all four biomarkers. Some symptoms on the RPQ at the 7-day follow-up were group tested using subtypes classification suggested by some authors93,94: cognitive symptoms, oculomotor symptoms, headache/migraine, vestibular symptoms, and anxiety/mood symptoms.94 Risk groups were defined using the most appropriate thresholds from the classification performance for the following two steps: the ED evaluation and the follow-up evaluation 7 days after the trauma. Model performance was evaluated by measuring sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV). Discrimination was evaluated for each step and is presented using area under the curve (AUC). For each step of the model, a calibration curve of expected versus observed risk was assessed. Variance Inflation and Condition Index were used to evaluate the possibility of collinearity. All analyses were performed with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, version 9.4).Patient and public involvementPatients were involved as research partners during our nominal group technique, particularly when discussing the outcome definition.",

MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; SOF, Special Operations Forces; TBI, traumatic brain injury.Blast exposureThe primary measure of blast exposure is the GBEV,28 an assessment tool designed to capture units of lifetime blast exposure from weapons and explosives. GBEV asks respondents to self report exposure to five categories of blast: 1) small- and medium-sized arms such as handheld firearms and rifles; 2) large arms, often shoulder-fired, that can be carried on a person; 3) artillery, missile weapon systems, or large arms carried by vehicle, aircraft, or boat; 4) small explosives or grenades; and 5) large explosives or targeted explosives in close range. For each category, respondents provide the number of years, average months per year, days per month, and rounds per day of exposure, as well as how often exposures occurred on 2 or more consecutive days. An automated algorithm calculates the final GBEV, which has a minimum score of zero but no ceiling score.For the ReBlast Pilot, GBEV is administered via telephone interview by a member of the research team who has expertise in assessing blast exposure. Although GBEV has not been validated, in a sample of 984 service members, 200,000 GBEV units was established as a threshold at which participants were likely to report significant symptoms on the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory.28 Importantly, as described above, GBEV does not distinguish between LLB and HLB exposure.Brain injury assessmentThe Brain Injury Screening Questionnaire (BISQ)69 Part I is a structured questionnaire that characterizes incidence and severity of lifetime exposure to head trauma. The respondent is asked if they have ever experienced a blow to the head in 19 specific situations (e.g., sports, combat, motor vehicle accidents, etc.). To increase the likelihood of recalling a blow to the head, specific questions are asked for six common contact sports as well as for military training and combat. For every event, participants report if they lost consciousness or had a period of being dazed and confused, and if so, the duration of symptoms. Finally, hospitalizations and emergency department admissions for 13 specific medical events are documented. Table 328,70\u2013101 provides detailed information regarding measures of a participant's lifetime history of brain injury, exposure to wartime stress, and the extent and frequency of exposure to RBE and large weaponry.Table 3.Cognitive and Behavioral Assessments Blast exposure and medical historyMeasureConstruct measured/ data collectedAdministration methodTime (min)DemographicsAge, ethnicity, race, educationREDCap survey pre-visit15Military historyMilitary history, rank, time in service (years)5Military occupational statusBlast exposure (indirect)5Generalized Blast Exposure Value28Blast exposurePre-visit by phone10Deployment Risk & Resiliency Inventory, Combat Experiences Scale, modified for STRONG STAR70,71Combat exposureREDCap survey pre-visit3Medical historySymptom characteristics, duration, severity, and treatmentIn-person visit - interview10Brain Injury Screening Questionnaire72Lifetime TBI exposurePre-visit by phone;follow-up in-person25Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index73,74Sleep quality & disturbancesREDCap survey pre-visit; spouse by-phone10STOP BANG75Obstructive sleep apneaREDCap survey pre-visit< 1Pupillometry ExamPupil constriction and dilation15Neurocognitive functionMeasureConstruct measured/ data collectedAdministration methodTime (min)Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics76Processing speed, memory, inhibition, and other cognitive processesIn-person, laptop35Philips Intellispace CognitionMemory, verbal processing, working memory, executive functioning, processing speed, visual spatial processingIn-person visit, iPad45Grooved Pegboard Test77,78Fine motor functionIn-person visit5Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System79,80Inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility10WAIS- Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 4th version, Digit Span and Arithmetic81Working memory30Test of Premorbid Functioning82Premorbid ability/cognitive reserve5Auditory Consonant Trigrams83Divided attention, working memory15Neurobehavioral function, physical symptoms, and quality of lifeMeasureConstruct measured/ data collectedAdministration methodTime (min)Patient Health Questionnaire-984DepressionIn-person visit5Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised85Suicidality< 1Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory86Post-concussive symptoms3Brown-Goodwin Lifetime History of Aggression87Aggression60Glasgow Outcome Scale- Extended88Global outcome15Mild Brain Injury Atypical Symptoms89Symptom validity/effort2Medical Symptom Validity Test90Symptom validity/effort15Frontal Systems Behavior Scale91Apathy, disinhibition, executive dysfunctionParticipant: In-person visit10Spouse: PhonePTSD Checklist for DSM-592Post-traumatic stress disorderREDCap survey pre-visit3RAND-3693Physical functioning, role limitations, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, general health5TBI-Quality of Life short forms94Anger2Anxiety2Emotional & behavioral dyscontrol2Resilience2Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire95Aggression5World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule96Cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities, participation5Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test97,98Alcohol screening2Drug Abuse Screening Test99Drug screening3Headache Impact Test-6100Headaches3PROMIS Short forms101Pain Intensity7Pain InterferenceSTOP-BANG, Snoring history, Tired during the day, Observed stop breathing while sleep, High blood pressure, BMI more than 35 kg/m2, Age more than 50 years, Neck circumference more than 40 cm and male Gender; PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder; DSM, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; WHO, World Health Organization, PROMIS, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System; REDCap, Research Electronic Data Capture.Cognitive assessmentThe cognitive assessment battery measures executive function, memory, learning, intellectual performance, and fine motor functioning, as detailed in Table 3. Assessments are distributed across the first and second days of the study. Some assessments are administered via a computer (e.g., Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric)102 or iPad (e.g., Philips Intellispace Cognition)103 to complement traditional tests and obtain granular performance metrics (e.g., reaction time). Pupillometry measurements are obtained to assess the integrity of pupil constriction and dilation\u2014a metric of cognitive processing load tolerance.104 The Medical Symptom Validity Test105 and mild Brain Injury Atypical Symptoms scale106 are administered to assess effort and potential exaggeration of impairment. These measures contextualize the cognitive, behavioral, and physical symptom assessments during statistical analysis.Neurobehavioral function, physical symptoms, and quality of lifeThe battery of measures used to assess psychological health, sleep, pain, protective factors, and overall function and life quality are listed in Table 2. Some measures are collected via structured interview or self-report at the in-person visit, while others are collected before arrival online via REDCap,107 a secure, web-based software platform.NeuroimagingConnectome MRI for structural connectivity analysis Acquisition We perform a multi-shell dMRI protocol on the 3T Connectome scanner (MAGNETOM CONNECTOM Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany)108-110 using a 64-channel head coil.111 Complete sequence parameters are provided in Supplementary Table S1 and have been previously reported.112\u2013115 Sequence parameters include: 2 mm isotropic voxels; eight linearly spaced gradient strengths in the range G = 30-290 mT/m per diffusion time; 16 b-values ranging from 50 to 17,800 sec/mm2 with either 32 diffusion-encoding directions (for shells with b \u2264 2300 sec/mm2) or 64 directions (for shells with b \u2265 2400 sec/mm2). We also acquire a three-dimensional T1-weighted multi-echo magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MEMPRAGE) sequence for anatomic coregistration.116,117 Processing and analysis We correct data for gradient nonlinearity distortions108,118.119 and susceptibility-induced distortion, head motion, and eddy-current artifacts in the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Software Library (FSL).108,120 Quality control steps include visual inspection of the dMRI volumes before and after pre-processing and automated extraction of motion-related measures (Supplementary Fig. S1). We perform two types of analyses: connectivity-based and region of interest (ROI)\u2013based. For both analyses, we use multi-fiber reconstruction methods121,122 to extract estimates of fiber orientations in each voxel (Supplementary Fig. S2). We perform connectivity analysis of probabilistic tractography data110,123 to quantify axonal connections linking canonical networks whose nodes are segmented via FreeSurfer.124,125 For the ROI-based analysis, 42 white matter bundles are automatically reconstructed using TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy (TRACULA; Supplementary Fig. S3).126,127 To quantify changes in white matter microstructure we fit a tensor model and extract measures of fractional anisotropy, mean, radial, and axial diffusivity at each voxel. We also fit a three-compartment model113,115,128 of intra-axonal restricted diffusion, extra-axonal hindered diffusion, and free diffusion to extract estimates of axonal diameter in regions of white matter that are susceptible to blast injury.7 Tesla MRI for functional connectivity analysis Acquisition We acquire ultra-high spatial resolution blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI data on the 7T scanner, as previously described129 and as detailed in Supplementary Table 1. We use the Terra 7T platform (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) with the vendor-supplied 32-channel head-only receive coil array and birdcage transmit coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA). Notable BOLD sequence parameters include: whole\u2013brain single-shot simultaneous multi-slice130 gradient-echo echo-planar imaging at 1.2 mm isotropic voxel size, with repetition time = 2.25 sec and multiband factor 3. We acquire four runs of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), each with 150 measurements. Before the first run and between runs, the participants are reminded to remain awake with their eyes open and asked to confirm that they are comfortable and alert by squeezing a pneumatic ball. We acquire fMRI data alongside structural MRI data, such as T1-weighted and susceptibility-weighted imaging data, to provide an anatomical reference for the fMRI data, as well as standard calibration and auxiliary data such as magnetic field maps (B0 and B1+) that are used to adjust the system and remove artifacts. Processing and analysis We analyze data in the FreeSurfer124 Functional Analysis Stream (FSFAST) and the CONN toolbox.131 Preprocessing includes B0 distortion correction, motion correction, slice-timing correction, and temporal detrending. In FSFAST, the fMRI volume is sampled onto the cortical surface created by FreeSurfer and surface-smoothed; the subcortical areas are resampled into the MNI305 and volume-smoothed. We perform seed-based132 and independent component analyses133 of functional networks to estimate functional connectivity between the cortical and subcortical nodes of canonical neural networks, such as the default, salience, executive control, and dorsal attention networks.125Translocator protein PET-MRI TSPO genotyping A venous blood sample is drawn to perform genotyping for the Ala147Thr polymorphism in the TSPO gene. Acquisition We scan each subject using the TSPO ligand [11C]PBR2852 with a simultaneous PET-MRI scanner, a unique Siemens BrainPET photodiode-based PET scanner operated in the bore of a 3T whole\u2013body magnetic resonance scanner.134 We have developed MR-based methods for generating attenuation correction maps.135 An intravenous bolus injection of [11C]PBR28 (up to 15 mCi) is administered. After an uptake period of approximately 45 min, PET data are acquired for up to 60 min (overlapping with magnetic resonance data acquisition) and stored in list-mode format.We acquire brain MRI data using the Siemens 3T Trio scanner, equipped with a standard radiofrequency head coil positioned inside the PET insert, similar to standard MRI. During the PET-MRI, we acquire an MEMPRAGE sequence to be used as an anatomical reference, an arterial spin labeling (ASL) sequence to measure regional brain perfusion, and a time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography sequence to image brain vasculature. Processing and analysis Standardized uptake values (SUV) from 60-90 min post-injection are calculated as previously described.52 We coregister the SUV images to the MEMPRAGE image and then register to the MNI template and normalize to a pseudo-reference region (SUVR). Partial volume correction using region-based voxel-wise (RBV) correction is applied using PETsurfer.136 Voxel-wise analysis of ligand binding52 is performed using a combination of software packages, including FreeSurfer and FSL. TSPO genotype is controlled for in all analyses. Individuals with a low-binding genotype, estimated at 10% of the general population,137 will be excluded from analysis.Tau PET-MRI Acquisition Each subject is scanned using the ligand [18F]MK6240.138 As with the TSPO PET scan, the tau PET scan utilizes a combined PET-MRI scanner. An intravenous bolus injection of [18F]MK6240 (up to 5 mCi) is administered. After an uptake period of approximately 60 min, PET data are acquired for up to 60 min. We acquire a MEMPRAGE sequence, a T2-weighted SPACE fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2 SPACE FLAIR) sequence, and a two inversion-contrast magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP2RAGE) sequence (Supplementary Table S1). Processing and analysis The tau PET data analysis pipeline is similar to that used for analysis of the TSPO PET data, including voxel-wise group comparisons of ligand binding.52 SUV from 70-90 min post-injection is calculated as a primary outcome, normalized to a pseudo-reference region, and partial volume corrected.Integration of multi-modal neuroimaging dataTo facilitate precise neuroanatomic correlation of lesions and abnormal signals across modalities, all MRI and PET data are coregistered to the same spatial coordinates (Fig. 3).139 All MRI data are corrected for gradient nonlinearity distortion119 to reduce differential distortion between the images from any of the MRI or PET scanners. In addition, a B0 map is computed from images collected with reversed phase-encode blips and used to correct the B0 distortion in the fMRI.140 Cortical surface and whole-brain segmentation are computed using FreeSurfer tools from the minimally distorted T1-weighted image124 acquired on the Connectome. All images are registered to this T1-weighted image: MRI data are registered via boundary-based registration,117 and PET images are registered using normalized mutual information.141 All coregistered MRI and PET data undergo quality assessment for artifacts or noise, and study investigators manually correct anatomic errors observed on the cortical surfaces or subcortical segmentations.FIG. 3.Multi-modal integration of neuroimaging data. MRI and PET data are coregistered and segmented using FreeSurfer tools, allowing precise neuroanatomic correlation of lesions and abnormal signals across modalities. The red line indicates the pial surface, and the yellow indicates the cortical gray-white matter junction. In the T1 segmentation image, cortical and subcortical regions are segmented according to the Desikan-Killiany atlas.139 FA, fractional anisotropy; ASL, arterial-spin labeled perfusion imaging; MRA, magnetic resonance angiography; PET, positron emission tomography; rs-fMRI, resting-state functional MRI; SWI, susceptibility-weighted imaging; T1, T1-weighted; T2 FLAIR, T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery; TOF, time of flight; TSPO, translocator protein.Blood biomarker proteomic and metabolomic analysisAcquisitionWe collect \u223c20 cc of blood, in the fasting state (i.e., no food for at least 6 h prior), for plasma and serum analyses.Blood biomarker processing and analysisProteomic measurements are performed using proximity extension assay technology (Olink Proteomics). Protein markers include NfL, GFAP, as well as other candidate biomarkers available on the platform and new biomarkers that emerge during the study period.54,64,142 Candidate protein markers will be validated as needed using alternative measurement methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, electrochemiluminescence, and/or mass spectrometry. Metabolomics measurements are performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for targeted detection of candidate metabolites. Raw data values are normalized to interspersed pooled plasma samples using our standard approach.143-145Statistical analysisThe primary aim of the ReBlast Pilot study is to generate preliminary data that will inform the design of a larger, hypothesis-driven investigation. As such, due to feasibility constraints associated with enrolling active-duty SOF personnel for a 2-day study visit that requires travel away from their training bases, the ReBlast Pilot's target enrollment is 30 participants. Upon completion of study enrollment, we will aggregate GBEV scores from all 30 participants. We will use the median GBEV score to allocate participants into two groups: 1) GBEVb (n = 15 below the median GBEV), and 2) GBEVa (n = 15 above the median GBEV). Our primary statistical analyses will aim to answer the question: Does the GBEVa group differ from the GBEVb group with respect to cognitive, behavioral, physical, neuroimaging, and blood biomarkers? We will use Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to assess the null hypothesis that there is no difference in median biomarker values between the GBEVb and GBEVa groups. Of note, this pilot study's sample size of 30 participants is only sufficient to detect large differences between groups (effect sizes >1.2) with 80% power and an unadjusted Type 1 error control of 0.05.Secondary analysesWe will use Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to test for associations between biomarkers and GBEV scores. Given the exploratory nature of this pilot study, both original and adjusted p values (correcting for the number of biomarkers within each domain) will be calculated. We will also use linear regression to identify biomarkers that significantly differ between the GBEVb and GBEVa groups. Biomarkers will be treated as dependent variables in each model and GBEV as the independent variable, controlling for lifetime history of TBI exposure (from the BISQ) and combat exposure (from the Combat Exposure Scale), within the limits of our sample size. These analyses aim to identify associations between RBE and alterations in cognitive, behavioral, physical, neuroimaging, and blood biomarkers.Given the inherent limitations of performing a median-split analysis (e.g., exposure to RBE may not differ significantly between the GBEVb and GBEVa groups) and of evaluating each biomarker independently, we will also implement an unsupervised learning approach, such as k-means clustering, to derive clusters of personnel whose biomarker profiles are similar within and across domains. This clustering approach minimizes within-group differences, maximizes between-group differences, and increases our ability to identify combinations of biomarkers that account for complex, heterogeneous phenotypes. In turn, we will evaluate whether these clusters, consisting of participants with similar phenotypes, are associated with GBEV scores (Fig. 4).FIG. 4.Statistical plan for ReBlast pilot study. This figure depicts the primary statistical analyses proposed in this study: 1) a stepwise method to reduce the data into a meaningful set of biomarkers that distinguish the groups and then, assessing their relationship with GBEV scores (left panel); and 2) an unsupervised learning approach to reduce the data into meaningful clusters (representing groups of individuals with similar phenotypes) and then, evaluating their association with GBEV scores (right panel). Of note, the scatter plot in the left panel and the clusters in the right panel are hypothetical, not actual results. BEH, behavioral; BLO, blood; COG, cognitive; DMN, default mode network; FA, fractional anisotropy; fALFF, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations; GBEV, Generalized Blast Exposure Value; GBEVa, participant group with GBEV values above the median; GBEVb, participant group with GBEV values below the median; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; MCP, middle cerebellar peduncle; NEU, neuroimaging; NfL, neurofilament light chain; PHY, physical; rsFC, resting-state functional connectivity.LimitationsThere are four key limitations associated with our analytic approach. First, with a sample size of n = 30, our ability to detect significant differences between the GBEVb and GBEVa groups will be limited in both the primary and secondary analyses, including the k-means clustering approach. Second, a median split of GBEV scores may artificially create two participant groups whose exposure to blast is relatively similar. Our secondary analyses aim to address this concern by using GBEV as a continuous variable when evaluating the relationship between the GBEV and biomarkers. Third, we likely lack statistical power to robustly control for variance in mild TBI and combat exposure. Fourth, our study does not include a control group of participants without RBE, because all SOF personnel who have experienced combat (a study inclusion criterion) undergo training that results in RBE. Non-SOF military personnel may have less RBE but did not go through the SOF selection process and would not have similar training or combat exposures. Thus, non-SOF active-duty military personnel would not be an adequate control group. Some of these limitations can be mitigated in future studies by following SOF personnel longitudinally, as discussed below.",

The use of animals in this study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee and the Committee for Security of Recombinant DNA Experiments of Sapporo Medical University.Preparation of MSCs from rat bone marrowThe MSC preparation and culture were conducted based on our previous studies.16 Briefly, bone marrow, obtained from femoral bones in adult (6\u20138 weeks old) Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, was diluted to 15 mL with Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA), 2 mM l-glutamine (Sigma), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and incubated for three days at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. When cultures almost reached confluence, the adherent cells were detached with a trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution (Sigma) and subcultured at 1 \u00d7 104 cells/mL of medium. After three passages, the MSCs were used in the present study. A previous phenotypic analysis of the surface antigens revealed cluster of differentiation (CD) 45-, CD73+, CD90+, and CD106- on MSCs.17,18SCI modelContusive SCI was performed as described previously.12 Briefly, adult (7-week-old) male SD rats (250\u2013300 g) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of ketamine (90 mg/kg, IP) and xylazine (4 mg/kg, IP). After skin incision, the T9 vertebra was stabilized, a laminectomy was performed at the T9\u201310 level of the spinal cord, and a 150-kdyn contusion was delivered to the spinal cord using an Infinite Horizons impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Lexington, KY). Appropriate post-operative care was provided for all animals, including twice-daily manual bladder expression for up to 14 days. The rats were housed in an atmosphere of 50% humidity at a temperature of 24 \u00b1 2\u00b0C.Behavioral testingOpen field locomotor function was assessed by a tester blinded to the treatment using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale.19 Intact (n = 10) and SCI rats (n = 20) were scored two days before SCI induction, and at two-day intervals thereafter until sacrifice at eight weeks post-SCI induction.Experimental protocolOnly rats with BBB scores that displayed zero points one day after SCI induction were included in this study. The SCI rats with BBB scores of zero points were randomized and received a single intravenous infusion of MSCs at 1.0 \u00d7 106 cells in 1.0 mL of fresh DMEM (n = 10) or vehicle (1.0 mL fresh DMEM alone) (n = 10) via the femoral vein one day after SCI induction. All rats were injected daily with cyclosporine A (10 mg/kg, IP).10,11,20 Age-matched intact rats were used as intact controls (n = 10). At day 14 after SCI induction, AAV virus was injected into both SCI animals and age-matched intact animals21\u201326 (see Neuroanatomical tracing). Eight weeks after SCI induction, histological analysis was performed.Neuroanatomical tracingGreen Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-encoding AAVs with a chicken beta-actin (CAG) promoter and tdTomato-encoding AAVs with a CAG promoter (AAV-8-CAG-GFP/tdTomato) were purchased from Vector Biolabs (Malvern, PA). At day 14 after SCI induction, the rats were placed on a stereotaxic frame under anesthesia induced by an IP injection of ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg).Fourteen days post-SCI, a craniotomy was performed to expose the sensorimotor cortex. The GFP-encoding AAV was injected into the right hemisphere. The tdTomato-encoding AAV was injected into the left hemisphere. Five rats per group (five intact, five vehicle-SCI, five MSC-SCI) received both AAV-8-CAG-GFP/tdTomato. Five rats per group (five intact, five vehicle-SCI, five MSC-SCI) received both AAV-8-CAG-tdTomato.For each hemisphere, six injections for cortex (AAVs; 4.0 \u00d7 1010 genome copy/\u03bcL, 0.5 \u03bcL per site) were performed at the following coordinates: 1.0 mm lateral; 1.5 mm, 1.0 mm depth; and -1.0 mm, 0 mm, 1.0 mm posterior to the bregma using a nanoliter-injector (World Precision Instrument Inc., Sarasota, FL) attached to a pulled glass pipette.27 The method used in this study allowed us to perform precise microdelivery of viral vectors to localized regions in the brain. The needle was left in place for 3 min before moving to the next site.Histological analysisSix weeks after tracer injections,28 rats were perfused transcardially with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde under deep anesthesia with an IP injection of ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Spinal cords were dissected out and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Sections were cut into 50-\u03bcm thickness using a cryostat (Sakura Seiki Co, Tokyo, Japan).One section of each animal was selected and cut. Then, these sections were washed three times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) three times. The sections were examined using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM780 ELYRA S.1 system). Sections were viewed directly to assess GFP and tdTomato fluorescence. The intensities of GFP or tdTomato signals were quantified using ImageJ software bundled with Java 1.8.0_172 (National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda MD).27,29,30ClearingThe spinal cord tissue was cleared according to a modified version of the advanced clear, unobstructed brain imaging cocktails and computational analysis (CUBIC) protocol.31 First, the samples were treated with half-diluted CUBIC-L (#T3740, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The fixed samples were immersed in 10 mL of half-diluted CUBIC-L for 6 h at 37\u00b0C under low-speed rotation. The samples were then placed in 10 mL of 100% CUBIC-L solution for four days at 37\u00b0C with gentle shaking. The CUBIC-L was replaced every 2 days.Then, to wash off the remaining CUBIC-L reagent, the samples were washed in 10 mL of PBS for 2 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The samples were then immersed in 5 mL of CUBIC-R+ (for animals) (#T3741, Tokyo Chemical Industry, Co., Ltd.) diluted by half and treated for 24 h at room temperature. Finally, the samples were immersed in 4 mL of CUBIC-R+ and shaken gently at room temperature overnight. The next day, fresh reagents were replaced and incubated for another 24 h before imaging.Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) of optically cleared samplesThe LSFM of optically cleared rat spinal cords was performed with an Ultramicroscope II (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany), including an Olympus MVX10 zoom body (Olympus), and a scientific complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor camera (PCO, Germany) with a pixel size of 6.5 \u03bcm. Detection optics with an optical magnification range of 1.26 to 12.6 and an NA of 0.5 were used. For tdTomato and GFP excitation, a 561-nm and 488-nm diode laser was used, respectively. The emitted wavelengths were detected with specific detection filters: 620/60 nm for tdTomato and 525/50 nm for GFP. The optical zoom factor of the measurements varied from 1.26 to 8 and the light-sheet thickness ranged from 5 to 10 \u03bcm.Quantitative analysisImages of sections labeled with tdTomato (n = 5/group), each at the C4-5 and L1-2 levels, were acquired using a Zeiss microscope. The distribution of axons was plotted using the ImageJ software (NIH). Their distributions were further calculated in squares, which divided the hemispinal cord image by 6 \u00d7 9, and heatmaps were generated using Graph-R software.28 The value in each square was assigned into 20 divisions ordered from high to low numbers with the squares in the highest division represented in red and the lowest in blue color.StatisticsAll statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 21 for Macintosh (IBM, Inc., IL). Groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance, and the Tukey-Kramer test was used for post hoc comparisons. Comparisons between two groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.Data availabilityThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.",

    "PMC9529303": "MethodsParticipantsParticipants were enrolled at 11 academic level 1 trauma centers in the United States within 24 h of injury, after evaluation in the Emergency Department (ED) or hospital inpatient unit for TBI; all received head computed tomography (CT) per order of the evaluating physician. 20 Exclusion criteria are specified in the Supplementary Material. Written consent was obtained from all subjects and the protocol was approved by the University of California, San Francisco and all enrollment site Institutional Review Boards.A total of 1132 patients with mTBI met inclusion criteria of admission GCS 13\u201315, had clinical head CT scans, and were enrolled within 24 h of injury (Fig. 1). Of these mTBI participants, 592 underwent MRI at both two weeks (range: 10\u201318 days) and six months post-injury (range: 160\u2013203 days). Children age <17 years and adults >60 years were excluded because of known rapid WM microstructural changes of, respectively, development and aging. Of 484 participants with mTBI in the target age range, 93 were excluded for incomplete DTI scans at one or both time points\u2014e.g., excessive motion during scan and/or visible image artifacts. Accordingly, 391 patients were available for analysis, of whom 367 had GOSE scores recorded at six-month follow-up.FIG. 1.CONSORT diagram for inclusion of enrolled TRACK-TBI patients into this analysis. TBI, traumatic brain injury; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; DTI, diffusion tensor imaging; GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; QC, quality control.Friends or family of the TBI-injured participants, demographically matched by age, sex, and education, served as the \u201cfriend control\u201d (FC) group (n = 148) and underwent 3T MRI including DTI.Demographic, clinical, and outcome measuresWithin 24 h of injury, we collected demographic data, clinical characteristics, and cause of injury, categorized as incidental falls, road traffic incidents, violence/assaults, and other causes. The GCS score was acquired on presentation to the ED. The six-month follow-up GOSE was administered to capture disability related to the TBI only, with exclusion of disability associated with co-occurring polytrauma (e.g., orthopedic injuries).21\u201323 The GOSE was dichotomized as <8 (incomplete recovery) versus = 8 (complete recovery) as the primary outcome for the analysis, because incomplete recovery is common in mTBI but is not reliably predicted by clinical injury severity factors such as the GCS or by conventional CT or MRI findings.MRI acquisitionThe MRI with DTI was conducted at the 11 level 1 trauma centers in the United States using 3T MR scanners. Standardization of DTI measures across all 13 MR scanners at the 11 sites was achieved using both an isotropic diffusion phantom developed at the NIST and a traveling volunteer, as reported previously,19 and as given in more detail in the Supplementary Material.Whole-brain DTI acquisition was performed with a multi-slice single-shot spin echo echoplanar pulse sequence using 64 diffusion-encoding directions, isotropically distributed over the surface of a sphere with electrostatic repulsion, acquired at b = 1300 s/mm2, eight acquisitions at b = 0 s/mm2, slices of 2.7-mm thickness each with no gap between slices, a 128 \u00d7 128 matrix, and a field of view (FOV) of 350 \u00d7 350 mm, resulting in 2.7-mm isotropic voxels. The remainder of the MRI protocol and DTI pre-processing and post-processing details are given in the Supplementary Material.Statistical analysisTract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) in FSL24 was used to skeletonize and register the diffusion maps for each subject to perform data-driven whole-brain voxelwise group analysis and tract-specific region of interest (ROI) measurements along the white matter skeleton using 14 WM tracts from the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) ICBM-DTI-81 White-Matter Labeled Atlas25 (Table 1), previously reported to be commonly injured in mTBI.16 Further details of the TBSS analysis26,27 are provided in the Supplementary Material.Table 1.Two-Week Cross-Sectional Diffusion Tensor Imaging of Patients with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and ControlsTractFractional AnisotropyAxial Diffusivity 10\u22123 mm2/secMean Diffusivity 10\u22123 mm2/secRadial Diffusivity 10\u22123 mm2/secmTBIControlsCohen dmTBIControlsCohen dmTBIControlsCohen dmTBIControlsCohen dGlobal0.430 \u00b1 0.0260.434 \u00b1 0.0260.1641.105 \u00b1 0.0461.086 \u00b1 0.050 -0.394** 0.732 \u00b1 0.0300.715 \u00b1 0.037 -0.537** 0.545 \u00b1 0.0290.531 \u00b1 0.035 -0.442** GCC0.676 \u00b1 0.0390.656 \u00b1 0.049 -0.437** 1.519 \u00b1 0.0711.451 \u00b1 0.083 -0.878** 0.769 \u00b1 0.0490.754 \u00b1 0.046 -0.328** 0.399 \u00b1 0.0550.404 \u00b1 0.0570.101BCC0.642 \u00b1 0.0370.646 \u00b1 0.0410.1101.566 \u00b1 0.0621.496 \u00b1 0.078 -0.995** 0.831 \u00b1 0.0470.796 \u00b1 0.049 -0.712** 0.467 \u00b1 0.0550.441 \u00b1 0.055 -0.465** SCC0.757 \u00b1 0.0340.753 \u00b1 0.033-0.1191.530 \u00b1 0.0541.474 \u00b1 0.067 -0.917** 0.719 \u00b1 0.0420.699 \u00b1 0.039 -0.513** 0.315 \u00b1 0.0500.309 \u00b1 0.044-0.109ALIC0.549 \u00b1 0.0330.545 \u00b1 0.033-0.1251.224 \u00b1 0.0671.147 \u00b1 0.077 -1.066** 0.716 \u00b1 0.0400.681 \u00b1 0.034 -0.947** 0.467 \u00b1 0.0410.444 \u00b1 0.028 -0.655** PLIC0.666 \u00b1 0.0310.678 \u00b1 0.032 0.367** 1.305 \u00b1 0.0751.236 \u00b1 0.075 -0.926** 0.681 \u00b1 0.0380.643 \u00b1 0.039 -0.998** 0.372 \u00b1 0.0350.342 \u00b1 0.036 -0.843** ACR0.461 \u00b1 0.0320.457 \u00b1 0.032-0.1251.139 \u00b1 0.0601.094 \u00b1 0.067 -0.694** 0.727 \u00b1 0.0370.706 \u00b1 0.038 -0.543** 0.525 \u00b1 0.0380.509 \u00b1 0.035 -0.435** SCR0.481 \u00b1 0.0270.486 \u00b1 0.0270.1731.101 \u00b1 0.0601.039 \u00b1 0.060 -1.019** 0.691 \u00b1 0.0360.657 \u00b1 0.035 -0.965** 0.490 \u00b1 0.0350.462 \u00b1 0.032 -0.869** PTR0.570 \u00b1 0.0400.581 \u00b1 0.036 0.294* 1.328 \u00b1 0.0541.278 \u00b1 0.067 -0.812** 0.768 \u00b1 0.0390.736 \u00b1 0.043 -0.780** 0.489 \u00b1 0.0470.461 \u00b1 0.045 -0.615** EC0.406 \u00b1 0.0370.398 \u00b1 0.034 -0.247 1.139 \u00b1 0.0471.075 \u00b1 0.059 -1.209** 0.771 \u00b1 0.0310.739 \u00b1 0.036 -0.944** 0.590 \u00b1 0.0400.567 \u00b1 0.038 -0.591** CGC0.509 \u00b1 0.0440.504 \u00b1 0.042-0.1091.221 \u00b1 0.0651.151 \u00b1 0.080 -0.953** 0.746 \u00b1 0.0410.711 \u00b1 0.044 -0.816** 0.511 \u00b1 0.0480.488 \u00b1 0.046 -0.495** SLF0.478 \u00b1 0.0290.480 \u00b1 0.0280.0791.104 \u00b1 0.0421.054 \u00b1 0.052 -1.040** 0.701 \u00b1 0.0260.673 \u00b1 0.031 -0.951** 0.502 \u00b1 0.0320.479 \u00b1 0.032 -0.705** SFO0.445 \u00b1 0.0360.454 \u00b1 0.035 0.268* 1.040 \u00b1 0.0680.983 \u00b1 0.076 -0.798** 0.671 \u00b1 0.0450.637 \u00b1 0.044 -0.770** 0.492 \u00b1 0.0450.459 \u00b1 0.040 -0.762** PCR0.467 \u00b1 0.0290.471 \u00b1 0.0300.1331.179 \u00b1 0.0431.127 \u00b1 0.063 -0.969** 0.755 \u00b1 0.0310.726 \u00b1 0.042 -0.812** 0.546 \u00b1 0.0350.521 \u00b1 0.041 -0.655** SS0.515 \u00b1 0.0360.522 \u00b1 0.0360.1831.271 \u00b1 0.0551.219 \u00b1 0.068 -0.845** 0.777 \u00b1 0.0330.746 \u00b1 0.039 -0.874** 0.533 \u00b1 0.0400.505 \u00b1 0.041 -0.678** mTBI, mild traumatic brain injury; GCC, genu of the corpus callosum; BCC, body of the corpus callosum; SCC, splenium of the corpus callosum; ALIC, anterior limb of the internal capsule; PLIC, posterior limb of the internal capsule; ACR, anterior corona radiata; SCR, superior corona radiata; PTR, posterior thalamic radiation; EC, external capsule; CGC, dorsal cingulate bundle; SLF, superior longitudinal fasciculus; SFO, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus; PCR, posterior corona radiata; SS, sagittal stratum.Bold: p < 0.05; *p < 0.01; **p < 0.001.Diffusion tensor imaging metric values: mean \u00b1 standard deviation; Cohen d is positive for Controls > mild traumatic brain injury.Radiological analysisThe CT and MRI scans were interpreted by a board-certified neuroradiologist blinded to the patients' clinical information using the National Institutes of Health Common Data Elements (CDEs) for TBI pathoanatomical classification of intracranial lesions such as contusions, axonal injury, and subdural hematomas.28 Patients with acute abnormal CT or MRI findings related to the recent injury were categorized as \u201cCT+\u201d or \u201cMRI+,\u201d respectively. Because the study was limited to patients with mTBI, the final dataset did not include patients with large, deep anatomic lesions that could meaningfully interfere with DTI measurements within the skeletonized core of major WM tracts.Association analysis with GOSE at six months post-injuryDemographics, clinical, and initial CT characteristics were compared between mTBI participants with incomplete (GOSE <8) versus complete (GOSE = 8) recovery at six months post-injury. Between-group comparisons used the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for continuous variables and the Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Bivariate and multi-variable (adjusting for demographic and other known risk factors such as history of psychiatric illness, previous TBI, and CT imaging results) associations between individual tract-specific DTI metrics at two weeks post-injury and incomplete recovery (GOSE <8 vs. = 8) at six months post-injury were assessed using logistic regression models.Standardized score for each DTI measure was calculated using its mean and standard deviation from the analysis sample. This way, we could better compare the effect across the different DTI measures. The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method was used to adjust for multiple testing.29 Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.6.1.",
