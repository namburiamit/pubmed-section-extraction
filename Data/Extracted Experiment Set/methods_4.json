    "Methods": "Animals.\nExperiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of\nHealth Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All animal\nprotocols were approved by the City College and the City University of NY\nInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats\n(250\u2013300g) were housed under a 12 h light/dark cycle in a pathogen-free\narea with water and food provided ad libitum. All surgeries were performed under\ngeneral anesthesia (70 mg/kg ketamine, 6 mg/kg xylazine, i.p.) and aseptic\ncondition.\n\nExperimental and surgery procedure.\nA schematic of our experimental plan is shown in\nFigure 1A\n. The CST was anterogradely labeled with\nbiotinylated dextran amine (BDA) injected into the forelimb representation of\nMCX. Muscle proprioceptive afferents (PA) were labeled transganglionically using\ncholera toxin B subunit (CTB) injected into the extensor carpi radialis (ECR)\nmuscle, which also retrogradely labels ECR motoneurons. Surgeries were performed\naccording to the time line shown in\nFig.1B\n.\nFig. 1. Experimental design and verification.\nOpen in a new tab\nA.\nSchematic illustration of experimental design. Gray\nmatter shading on the left side indicates denervated/inactivated side.\nB.\nTime line of individual procedures.\nC.\nSummary\nof the BDA injection locations in all groups on the left side, and muscimol\ninfusion cannula site on right side.\nD.\nRepresentative cytochrome C\nhistochemical staining (left; 40 \u00b5m section) and plot profile analysis of\ncytochrome C optical intensity in the infusion area (right; N=4 rats; mean\n\u00b1 SEM; 0, approximate center of infusion) reveals reduced metabolic\nactivity in infused motor cortex.\nE\n. PKC\u03b3 staining reveals\nno CST axonal damage in the inactivated dorsal column.\nF\n.\nUnilateral PTx causes complete loss of PKC\u03b3 staining in the injured\ndorsal column (top). Nissl staining of lesion site at medulla reveals that the\nlesion is limited to pyramidal tract (bottom).\nG\n. Iba-1 staining\nshows that no obvious microglial activation was induced in the dorsal column\nafter 10 days of MCX inactivation compared to control; PTx induces dense\nmicrolgial cell staining in the injured dorsal column. Insets (below) are higher\nmagnification images of Iba-1 positive microglial cells in each group.\nH\n. Quantification of Iba-1+ microglial cells in the injured\ndorsal column of the spinal cord from all groups. Cortical inactivation did not\nproduce a significant increase in the number of microglial cells in the injured\nDC as did PTx. Kruskal-Wallis test, p=0.0258; Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison\ntest, *p<0.05. Scale: 100 \u03bcm in E, F, and dorsal column images in\nG. 10 \u03bcm for insets in G.\nChronic M1 muscimol infusion.\nTo block the activity of motor cortex chronically, the\nGABA\na\nreceptor agonist Muscimol (10 mM in normal saline,\nSigma) was continuously infused for 10 days using an implanted osmotic\nminipump (Alzet, model 2002, 0.5 \u03bcl/h) (\nMartin & Ghez, 1999\n). The infusion canula was\ncentered in right M1 forelimb representation (AP: 1.8 mm, ML: 3mm as shown\nin\nfig. 1C\n, right) (\nBrus-Ramer\net al.\n, 2009\n;\nJiang\net al.\n, 2013\n),\nand at a depth of 1.5 mm below the pial surface. Depression of cortical\nneuronal activity was confirmed using a metabolic marker, as loss of\nCytochrome C staining (\nWong-Riley,\n1989\n), in each animal (n=4;\nFig.\n1D\nleft), which is analyzed using plot profile function in ImageJ\nand summarized in\nfig. 1D\n.\nPyramidal tract lesion (PTx).\nAnimals were anesthetized (ketamine and xylazine: 70/6 mg/kg, i.p.)\nand a small craniotomy was made in the ventral surface of occipital bone to\nexpose the right pyramidal tract at the caudal medullary level. An\niridectomy scissor was lowered to a depth of 1.2 mm below the ventral\nmedullary surface directly adjacent to the basilar artery and the entire\nright pyramid was transected as described before (\nBrus-Ramer\net al.\n, 2007\n) (\nFig. 1A\n). We verified the completeness of\npyramidal tract lesion in each animal by two ways: absence of pyramidal\ntracts with Nissl staining in medulla (\nfig.\n1F\nlower), and complete loss of PKC\u03b3 staining in the\ncervical dorsal column contralateral to the PTx (see\nFig 1F\n, upper). Medullary Nissl staining also\nindicates no further injury to pathways adjacent to pyramidal tracts.\nAnterograde labeling of MCX corticospinal axons.\nSeven injections of BDA (10%, 300 nL/injection site, Invitrogen)\nwere made into forelimb motor cortex, the coordinates of seven sites are\n(AP, ML in mm): (1.0, 2.0), (1.0, 3.0), (1.0, 4.0), (1.8, 2.5), (1.8, 3.5),\n(2.5, 2.5), (2.5, 3.5). The exact location may be slightly shifted when\nblood vessels were encountered (\nfig.\n1C\n, left). Injections were made 1.5 mm below the pia surface. The\ninjections sites distribute evenly within forelimb motor cortex and are\nconsistent between control, inactivation and PTx animals. To study spared CS\naxonal sprouting, BDA was injected to either unlesioned MCX in PTx animals,\nor the active MCX in inactivation animals. To study the phagocytosis of the\ninactivated CST, BDA was injected to muscimol infused MCX in inactivation\nanimals. We summarized the injection sites in\nfig. 1C\n.\nMuscle afferents tracing.\nCTB (1%; 10 \u03bcl, List Biologicals) was injected into the\nextensor carpi radialis muscle (ECR) at the side with either CS denervation\nor MCX inactivation using a Hamilton syringe (\nJiang\net al.\n, 2016\n).\nSystemic minocycline administration.\nMinocycline hydrochloride was administered to PTx rats daily for 10\ndays (n=4; Sigma. 45 mg/kg, pH adjusted to 7.4, i.p.) to achieve a maximal\ninhibitory effect (\nJiang\net\nal.\n, 2018\n), and the first dose was given immediately\nafter PTx, as described previously (\nJiang\net al.\n, 2018\n).\n\nTissue preparation and staining.\nAnimals were deeply anesthetized and perfused with saline followed by 4%\nparaformaldehyde. Frozen brain and spinal cord tissues were cut transversely at\n40\u00b5m thickness using a sliding microtome. For Cytochrome oxidase\nhistochemical staining, brain sections were incubated for 2\u20136 hours at\n37\u00b0C in 0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 4% sucrose, 0.05% DAB, and\n0.03% cytochrome C (Sigma type III). For CST analysis, BDA was visualized with\n1% avidin\u2013 biotin complex reagent (Vector Laboratories), and followed by\nthe chromogen diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma) or streptavidin conjugated to FITC\nor Cy3. The following primary antibodies were used: goat anti-CTB (1: 1000, List\nBiologicals), guinea pig anti-VGLUT1 (1:1000, Millipore), rabbit anti-Iba-1\n(1:1000, Wako), mouse anti-myelin basic protein (MBP). FITC, Cy3 or Cy5\nconjugated donkey anti-goat, donkey anti-guinea pig, donkey anti-mouse, donkey\nanti-rabbit secondary antibodies were used subsequently according to the\ncombination of co-labeling. Finally, Sections were digitally imaged using Zeiss\nLSM 880 confocal microscope.\n\nImage analysis of\ncervical 6\u20138 spinal cord\nsegments.\nQuantification of midline crossing axons.\nBDA-labeled uninjured or active CST axons located within a 25\n\u03bcm wide rectangle near the border of Laminae VII and X were counted\nto obtain an estimate of the number of midline crossing axons, as shown in\nFig. 3A (middle panel, red\nrectangles) (\nBrus-Ramer\net\nal.\n, 2007\n). For each animal, 10\u201315 sections\nwere quantitatively analyzed.\nCorticospinal axon length estimation.\nUninjured or active CST axons were manually-traced and axon\nvaricosities (approximately \u22653x the stem axon diameter) were marked\nusing Neurolucida (MBF Science). The traced axon length and varicosity\nnumbers were obtained using Neurolucida Explorer. The estimation of axon\nlength was corrected for the variability in tracing between animals using\nthe average number of BDA-labeled axons in the dorsal CST estimated using\nthe Optical Fractionator program in Stereo Investigator (MBF Science). For\nthis analysis, 4\u20135 sections were selected for quantitative\nmeasurements in each animal.\nProprioceptive afferent terminal density analysis.\nHigh-resolution tiled images of CTB-labeled spinal cord sections\nwere captured using a Zeiss 880 confocal microscope at 20x with an optical\nthickness of 1 \u03bcm. Because we were interested in changes within the\ngray matter only, the white matter areas of the spinal cord were digitally\nremoved before analyses. All images underwent selective threshold\nadjustments using equivalent contrast/brightness levels to highlight only\nCTB-labeled fibers, which reduced noise variations between sections and\nanimals (Photoshop; Adobe); this has been described in our previous study\n(\nTan\net al.\n,\n2012\n). The mediolateral distribution of CTB-positive terminals in\nthe deep dorsal horn/intermediate zone (Fig.5\nB\u2013E, rectangle) was\nanalyzed on the thresholded images using the Plot Profile function in\nImageJ. And the area under medial and lateral parts of the distribution\ncurves were calculated in using the program Prism 5. For each animal,\n10\u201315 sections were analyzed.\nDensity heatmaps.\nAxon tracing data or processed CTB images from individual sections\nwere corrected for orientation and aligned with one another according to\nfiduciary marks, and then were exported and quantified using custom programs\nwritten in Matlab (MathWorks). Output files of individual sections of the\nspinal gray matter were divided into 40 \u00b5m by 40 \u00b5m square\nregions of interest (ROIs). Axon length, varicosity numbers, and\nCTB-positive terminal densities are represented according to a color scale,\nfrom the lowest density (blue) to the highest (red). Areas without labeling\nare colored black. To compare the distribution of uninjured or active CST\nvaricosities and PA terminals, we warped the heatmaps in photoshop to match\nthe contour within MCX inactivation or PTx groups.\nDorsal column microglia cells count.\nMicroglial cells were visualized using Iba-1 staining. We obtained\n40x confocal z-stack images within dorsal column as the area of interest\n(ROI; 212.5 \u00d7 212.5 \u03bcm). Only Iba-1 positive cells with a\nclear soma and processes were counted as shown in\nfig. 1G\ninsets. For each animal, 4 sections were\nanalyzed.\nQuantification of microglial engulfment of myelin or CST axonal\ndebris.\nIntensity of myelin basic protein (MBP) or BDA clusters within\nindividual microglia were obtained using ImageJ. Images were thresholded\nusing consistent values, and only clusters with \u2265 3 pixels were\ncircled for optical intensity analysis, similar to our previous study (\nJiang et al., 2018\n). For clusters\noccupying several optical slices, we analyzed the slice containing the\nlargest cluster area. If multiple clusters appeared in one microglial cell,\nthe intensity of all clusters was summed to represent the value of the\ncorresponding microglial cell. Images were taken from 3 animals in each\ngroup with a focus on the medial intermediate zone, which is where\ncontralateral CS axons are densest (\nJiang\net al.\n, 2016\n). For this analysis, 8 sections\nwere randomly chosen from each animal, and 25\u201370 microglial cells\nwere analyzed from each animal, the numbers of cells varied due to the\ndistinct inflammatory condition with or without injury. As a result, the\ntotal numbers of microglia cells that were analyzed ranged from 100 to 200\nfor each group.\nStatistics.\nStatistical analyses were performed using Prism 5 (Graph Pad Prism\n5). For data not normally distributed, the Mann-Whitney test was used to\ncompare two groups. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare more than\ntwo groups, which was followed by Dunne\u2019s Multiple comparison test.\nData that were verified to be normally distributed were compared with a\nOne-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey Multiple comparison test. Cumulative\ncurves were compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S test)."

    "Methods": "Animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health\u2019sGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animalsand Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines. Mice were maintained on C57BL/6 background. Gli1-CreERT2(RRID: IMSR_ JAX STRAIN#007913) and PTENflox/floxmice (RRID: IMSR_JAX STRAIN #006440) were bred to generate PTEN KO (Gli1-CreERT2hemizygous, PTENflox/flox) and control (Gli1-CreERT2negative, PTENflox or wt; Gli1-CreERT2hemizygous, PTENwt/wt) mice. To delete PTEN from postnatally active neural progenitor cells (Ahn and Joyner, 2005;Murphy et al., 2011), mice were injected with tamoxifen (Sigma Aldrich, T5648; 250 mg/kg dissolved at 20 mg/ml in corn oil, S.C) on either post-natal day (P) 14 or P21. Although later tamoxifen treatment leads to recombination among fewer granule cells, the morphological disruption among individual KO cells is similar between treatment times (Arafa et al., 2019and data not shown), so groups were binned for analysis. Final study animals included 30 PTEN KO mice (5 female and 25 male) and 40 control mice (15 female and 25 male). Male and female mice were not found to differ (data not shown), so they were binned for analysis. Note, however, that the number of female mice in the PTEN KO group is low, so the lack of differences should be interpreted cautiously.\n\nSlice Physiology\nAcute hippocampal slices were prepared for electrophysiology as previously described (\nZhao et al., 2011\n;\nAlthaus et al., 2015\n;\nLaSarge et al. 2015\n;\nSantos et al., 2017\n). A stimulating electrode, mounted on the stage of the microscope, was used to activate the perforant pathway. The electrode was constructed from a sharp-tipped tungsten wire (impedance approximately 1\u20132 Mohm; FHC, Maine) and a stainless steel wire -- each placed through one barrel of a 6 cm long double-barreled glass pipette. The pipette was sealed at the end with Sylgard, with the exposed wire tips separated by 50\u201375 \u03bcm. Responses were elicited by a 200 \u03bcsec 6 V step, generated by the D/A interface and timed by Clampex software (version 10.3; Molecular Devices).\nExtracellular evoked responses were classified as consisting of 1) isolated excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) 2) an EPSP + a single population spike 3) an EPSP + multiple asynchronous population spikes or 4) an EPSP + multiple synchronous population spikes (\nSantos et al., 2017\n). EPSPs were defined as an initial peak occurring within 5 msec of the stimulus artifact, with an exponential decay. Population spikes were defined as negative deflections following the EPSP with an amplitude at least five times greater than baseline. Traces were scored as having multiple, asynchronous population spikes when 1) two or more spikes occurred, 2) the spikes appeared inconsistently after each stimulation or 3) appeared with variable latency. Latency was determined by centering a 5 msec time window at the spike peak, and determining whether spikes following subsequent stimulations occurred within this 5 msec window. Traces were scored as having multiple, synchronous population spikes when 1) two or more spikes occurred, 2) spikes occurred following every stimulation and 3) spike peaks occurred within 5 msec of each other in every trace. A minimum of four stimulation trials was used to assess responses.\nIntracellular recording electrodes were fabricated from thin-walled borosilicate glass pipettes (O.D., 1.5 mm; I.D., 1.12 mm) using a computer-controlled BB-CH-PC micropipette puller (Mecanex, Switzerland). Electrodes were filled with a solution composed (in mM) of Kgluconate, 135; KCl, 5; NaCl, 5; EGTA, 5; HEPES, 10; MgCl\n2\n, 2; glucose, 10; supplemented with ATP, 2; GTP, 0.2; Phosphocreatine, 7 (free Ca2+ level is estimated to be below 10nM). The electrode solution had a pH of 7.2 and an osmolarity of 290\u2013295 mOs. Electrode resistance was 6\u20137 Mohms. Current and voltage recordings were made with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices) controlled by Clampex software (version 10.3) with a Digidata interface (Model 1440, Molecular Devices). Results were analyzed with Clampfit (version 10.3). All extracellular solutions used had a pH between 7.3 and 7.4, osmolarity of 295\u2013305 mOs (adjusted by addition of sucrose) and were continuously aerated with a mixture of 95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n. All experiments were carried out at room temperature unless otherwise stated.\nWhole cell (patch clamp) recording was conducted using a \u201cblind\u201d approach in which a blunt-tipped patch electrode (\nPinault, 1996\n) was placed over the granule cell body layer using an Eclipse FN1 Nikon microscope equipped with 1\u00d7 (NA, 0.25) and 40\u00d7 (NA, 0.8) objectives. The electrode was then lowered into the cell body layer without the use of optics. The first cell for which a stable membrane seal was obtained was recorded electrophysiologically and filled with 0.2% biocytin following the completion of recording experiments. Labeled cells, therefore, should reflect a randomly-selected population.\nVoltage clamp experiments were conducted at a holding potential of \u221270 mV. Voltage ramps from \u2212100 mV to +40 mV, duration 1 sec at 0.1\u20130.2 Hz were used to generate ramp currents unless otherwise stated. At least 6 ramps were used for each run. The current recorded during the voltage ramp reflects the I-V relationship of the cells (\nPun and Kleene; 2003\n,\n2004\n). Several membrane parameters were determined from the ramp, including: 1) input resistance of the cell, obtained from the slope of the linear regression fit to the \u201csubthreshold\u201d region of the IV relation (between \u221280 and \u221250 mV and prior to the generation of the rapidly inactivating inward or action potential current (API)) 2) API (or activation) threshold, which is the voltage at which the first API is generated 3) peak inward amplitude of the 1st API elicited and 4) peak outward current at the end of the first ramp. Membrane parameter measurements were excluded if there was a positive shift in the activation potential and a reduction in peak API currents between the first 2 runs (1 minute apart); changes likely reflecting a shift in access or series resistance. Access resistance (range 6\u201316 mohm) was not compensated in our studies. Cells were excluded if the holding current was larger than \u2212100 pA. Currents were sampled at 10 KHz and filtered at 2 or 5 KHz.\nFollowing physiological recordings, slices were fixed overnight in a solution of 2.5% paraformaldehyde with 4% sucrose in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Biocytin labeling was revealed by incubating the slices for 2 hours at 25\u00b0C in 1:300 streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Molecular Probes Cat# S32354 also S32354 RRID:AB_2315383). Slices were cover-slipped with ProLong Gold Antifade mounting media (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies, Cat#\nP10144\n) and stored at 4\u00b0C until imaging.\n\nNeuronal reconstruction of biocytin-filled cells\nBiocytin-filled cells were imaged using a Nikon A1Rsi inverted microscope (software RRID:SCR_014329) equipped with a 40\u00d7 Plan Apo water immersion objective (NA=1.15; field size 317 \u00d7 317 \u03bcm; 0.5 \u03bcm z-step). Confocal z-series image stacks were imported to Neurolucida software (Microbrightfield Inc., RRID: SCR_001775) for whole cell tracing. Overlapping image stacks were three-dimensionally montaged into a single image for reconstruction. Reconstructions encoded soma area, dendritic length and branch points. Image stacks were also used to encode the location of the hilar-granule cell body layer border, the granule cell body layer-molecular layer border, and the location of the hippocampal fissure, as described in prior work (\nSantos et al. 2011\n). Since KO animals are mosaics, the blind patch approach yielded both PTEN KO and PTEN-expressing cells. Cells were categorized as either PTEN KO or PTEN-expressing only after reconstruction using soma area as a criterion. Cells with soma areas that exceeded two standard deviations of the control cell mean for biocytin-filled cells (107.8\u00b118.3) were defined as KOs; and were not included in the present study. Cells below this size threshold were defined as PTEN-expressing for the current work. This criteria has been previously validated to distinguish >95% of KO cells from control cells (\nSantos et al. 2017\n).\n\nPTEN and pS6 immunohistochemistry\nFor each animal, the right hemisphere of the brain was used for physiology and biocytin fills, while the left hemisphere was fixed overnight in a 2.5% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose solution in PBS maintained at 4\u00b0C. Left hemispheres were cryoprotected in 10, 20 and 30% sucrose in PBS, snap-frozen in \u221223\u00b0C 2-butyl methane and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until cryosectioning at 40 \u03bcm. Brain sections were mounted to glass slides for immunohistochemistry. Tissue was immunostained with rabbit anti-PTEN (Phosphatase and tensin homolog, 1:250, Cell Signaling Technology Cat# 9559 RRID:AB_390810) or rabbit anti-pS6 (Phospho-S6 Ribosomal Protein Ser240/244, 1:500, Cell Signaling Technology, Cat# 4838, RRID:AB_659977) primary antibodies followed by goat anti-rabbit Alex Fluor 594 secondary antibodies (1:750; Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A11012 RRID: AB_10562717). Brain sections were co-stained with NeuroTrace 640/660 Deep-Red Fluorescent Nissl stain (1:300; Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#\nN21483\n:AB_2572212). Sections were dehydrated in serial alcohol washes, xylene cleared, and hard mounted with Krystalon (EMD Millipore, Cat# 64969).\n\nPTEN KO cell counts\nPTEN/NeuroTrace immunostained sections were imaged with a Leica SP5 inverted microscope (software RRID: SCR_013673) equipped with 63\u00d7 oil objective (NA=1.4, field size 248 \u00d7 248 \u03bcm) or a Nikon A1R inverted microscope (software RRID:SCR_014329) equipped with a 60\u00d7 water objective (NA=1.27, field size 215 \u00d7 215 \u03bcm). Confocal z-series image stacks were collected through 11 \u03bcm of tissue at a 0.5 \u03bcm step, excluding the top 1\u20132 \u03bcm of tissue to avoid sectioning artifacts. Images were imported to Neurolucida software (Microbrightfield Inc., RRID: SCR_001775) and two 100 \u00d7 100 \u03bcm counting frames were placed over the midpoints of the upper and lower blades of the dentate gyrus, respectively. Counting frames encompassed the molecular layer and hilar borders of the dentate cell body layer. This ensured that the developmental age gradient of cells \u2013 with hilar border cells tending to be younger \u2013 was fully represented. The total number of Nissl stained cells, and the number of Nissl stained, PTEN negative (PTEN KO) cells was determined. Cell bodies cropped at the surface or left sides of the counting frame were excluded using a modified optical dissector approach (\nHofacer et al., 2013\n). The percentage of KO cells was determined using the following equation: [total number of Nissl Stained, PTEN negative [KO] cells divided by the total number of Nissl stained cells] \u00d7 100.\n\nSoma area measurements of Nissl-stained cells\nPTEN/NeuroTrace immunostained sections imported into Neurolucida were used to calculate average soma area for PTEN KO and PTEN-expressing cells populations, as follows: A grid (100 \u03bcm spacing between lines) was placed over the dentate gyrus. Using a random number generator, 2 squares of the grid (each 100 \u03bcm \u00d7 100 \u03bcm) were selected for analysis. In each square, five PTEN KO and five PTEN-expressing cells were measured. Soma areas were measured by tracing the largest cross-sectional area of the Neurotrace stain, while using the PTEN immunoreactivity to verify cell phenotype. If necessary, cells in additional, randomly selected squares were included until either a total of 10 cells/type were measured or all available squares were used.\n\nExperimental Design and Statistical Analysis\nAll data collection and analyses were conducted by investigators blind to animal age and genotype. Cell counts and neuronal reconstructions were generated and reviewed by two investigators to achieve consensus. Statistical tests were performed using Sigma Plot software (version 14.0, Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, RRID: SCR_003210). The impact of animal age and the percentage of KO cells (KO cell load) on experimental parameters was assessed using multiple linear regression analyses. The goal of these analyses was to determine whether granule cell physiology or structure varied with KO cell load or animal age, so only PTEN-expressing cells from KO animals were examined. In a second set of experiments, ANOVA was used to examine three groups: control cells, PTEN-expressing granule cells from low KO animals (<10%) and PTEN-expressing cells from high KO animals (>10%). For these analyses, age was not included as a variable, however, age distributions were statistically equivalent among all groups (data not shown). Data are presented as means \u00b1 SEM or medians [25\nth\n-75\nth\npercentiles]. For all analyses, p-values less than 0.05 were accepted as significant.\n\nFigure preparation\nConfocal\nz\n-series image stacks were converted from 12 bit to 8-bit RGB.tiff files using NIS-Elements software (version 4.500.00, Nikon). Figures were prepared using Sigma Plot software and Adobe Photoshop CS5 (version 12.0, Adobe Photoshop). Images of granule cells in\nfigures 1C\nand 4 are neuronal reconstructions (\nWalter et al., 2007\n).\nFigure 1,\nOpen in a new tab\nA:\nConfocal images of the dentate granule cell layers from three mice immunostained for PTEN (red) and counterstained for Nissl substance (blue). Images are from a control mouse (0% KO, P21 tamoxifen, 14 weeks old), a 4.2% KO mouse (P21 tamoxifen, 22 weeks old) and a 31.1% KO mouse (P14 tamoxifen, 7 weeks old). KO cells are evident as dark holes in the PTEN stain, and as bright blue cells in the merged image (arrows). Asterisks denote PTEN-immunonegative glial cells in the control animal. Scale bar=50 \u03bcm.\nB:\nConfocal images of phosphorylated S6 protein (pS6) immunostaining, a marker of mTOR activation. Images are from a control mouse (0% KO, P21 tamoxifen, 14 weeks old), a 6.4% KO mouse (P21 tamoxifen, 18 weeks old) and a 31.1% KO mouse (P14 tamoxifen, 7 weeks old). Scale bar=50 \u03bcm.\nC:\nNeuronal reconstructions from a P14 tamoxifen-treated 14-week-old mouse showing a PTEN KO cell (pseudocolored blue for clarity) in close proximity to a PTEN-expressing cell (pseudocolored red). The close proximity implies that PTEN KO cells could influence neighboring cells by direct contact, release of diffusible factors, and/or by altering local activity patterns. Note the dramatic hypertrophy of the soma and dendritic tree of the KO cell. Scale bar=100 \u03bcm. 1C has been slightly modified and reprinted with permission from\nDanzer, 2018\n."

    "Methods": "Human Muscle Biopsies\nMuscle biopsies were obtained and FSHD diagnoses were confirmed as reported (\n11\n).\n\nMice\nMethods were as described (\n27\n). Immunocompromised, NOD.Cg-Rag1\ntm1Mom\nl2rg\ntm-Wjl\n/SzJ (NRG, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME), mice were used in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Maryland, Baltimore. In brief, mice were anesthetized with avertin and their left hindlimbs were subjected to X-irradiation at 25 Gy at 2.2 Gy/min over 11-12 min. For all subsequent steps, mice were anesthetized with 2.5% isofluorane and, for injections, treated with 5 mg/kg carprofen. Six days later, 60 \u03bcl of a 0.3 mg/ml solution of cardiotoxin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was injected along the length of the TA muscle to promote degeneration. One day later we injected 2\u00d710\n6\nhMPCs in 60 \u03bcl of cell media using a 30G insulin needle, as in our published methods. One week after hMPC injection, mice were subjected to iNMES 3 times per week, as described (\n27\n). Tissues were collected from engrafted mice 4-5 weeks later. See\nSI Appendix\nfor details and\nSI Figure 1\nfor a timeline.\n\nCells (hMPCs) and Cell Injection\nThe immortalized hMPCs were initially prepared from biopsy samples of biceps muscle of patients carrying the FSHD-permissive 4A allele or their first-degree unaffected relatives (\n28\n). Cells were cloned after retroviral overexpression of CDK4 and immortalized using a retrovirus containing the catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT) (\n17\n), and expanded in culture prior to injection. Single clones of control and FSHD hMPCs were used in these studies. Cells were cultured on 0.1% gelatin coated flasks to 85% confluence. Immediately before cell injection, cells were treated with trypsin, pelleted, suspended in 60 \u03bcl of media and injected along the length of the TA. See\nSI Appendix\n.\n\nTissue collection\nTAs carrying xenografts were collected 4-5 weeks post-engraftment. Mice were anesthetized and euthanized by cervical dislocation. TAs were dissected, weighed, flash frozen in liquid N\n2\n, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Tissue sections, 12-16 \u03bcm thick, were mounted on glass micro-slides (\n27\n).\n\nImmunofluorescent Labeling\nTo identify and count human myofibers and myonuclei, we used human-specific antibodies to h-\u03b2-spectrin and h-lamin A/C to label the sarcolemmae and nuclear envelope of human fibers and myonuclei, respectively (\n27\n). We immunolabeled for desmin to identify muscle tissue and to evaluate sarcomeric organization (\n27\n). Embryonic myosin (F1.652-S, DSHB) was immunolabeled as an indicator of myofiber immaturity (see\nAppendix B\n.\nSupplemental Methods\n). To visualize NMJs in the grafts, we used antibodies to synaptophysin (Syp) together with \u03b1-bungarotoxin and anti-h-\u03b2-spectrin (\n27\n). We used antibodies to PAX7 (AB_528428, DSHB) on 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed cross sections to identify human satellite cells within the basal lamina, which we labeled with anti-laminin (L9393, Sigma-Aldrich; see\nAppendix B\n.\nSupplemental Methods\n. Anti-SLC34A2 (#66445, Cell Signaling Technology) was used to label the DUX4-target protein SLC34A2 in grafts and human biopsy cross sections and anti-\u03b1-actinin (#A7811, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a sarcomeric label in human biopsy cross sections. Primary antibody binding was detected with AlexaFluor secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\nImaging, morphometry & quantification\nImaging was performed in the UMB confocal microscopy core on an LSM-DUO (\nFigure 1a\n), Nikon CSU-W1 spinning disk (\nFigure 1 d\n,\n5a\n,\nd\n) or an LSM-Meta (\nFigs. 2b\n\u2013\nd\n) confocal microscope. We used FIJI to quantify fiber number, minimum Feret\u2019s diameter, compaction, and central nucleation manually, as described (\n27\n). We used FIJI to count fibers expressing SLC34A2 as a percentage of total human fibers within each xenograft.\n\nGene expression analysis\nTotal RNAs were isolated from TAs carrying xenografts with TRIzol (ThermoFisher), as described (\n23\n). The RT-qPCR for\nDUX4\nand DUX4 target gene expression was as reported (\n23\n). Primer sequences for\nZSCAN4, TRIM43\nand\nMBD3L2\nare published (\n54\n). Human SLC34A2 expression was analyzed with the TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (ThermoFisher, Assay ID: Hs00197519_m1), using 100ng cDNA per reaction (generated by iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit, BioRad) and SsoAdvanced Universal Probe Sumermix (BioRad) with the following PCR program: (1x) 95\u00b0C, 30 sec, (40x) 95\u00b0C, 10 sec and 60\u00b0C, 40 sec.\n\nMethylation analysis\nGenomic DNA of immortalized hMPCs was isolated using Wizard genomic DNA kit (Promega) as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Genomic DNA of TAs carrying xenografts was isolated from the organic phase of TRIzol/chloroform extracts after removal of the aquatic phase containing total RNAs (\n23\n). BSS for the 4qA allele (BSSA) and the (\n42\n) 4qB allele (BSSB) was as described (\n55\n).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nWe used unpaired t tests with Welch\u2019s correction for statistical analyses of fiber number and TA weight. Tests of fiber diameter and compaction used One-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test. Mann-Whitney U tests were used for gene expression data and percent of fibers expressing SLC34A2. We used a Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni\u2019s multiple comparisons test for analyses of central nucleation. Additional statistical methods are given in the text. All statistics were performed with GraphPad."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nThe experimental protocols in this study were all approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Loma Linda University and accorded with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. Two hundred and thirty-four adult male Sprague\u2013Dawley (SD) rats, weighing 260\u2013280 g, were assigned to either sham or MCAO surgery. All rats were housed in a humidity and temperature-controlled environment with regular light/dark cycle and free access to food and water.\n\n2.2. pMCAO model\nTo establish pMCAO models and induced focal ischemia, the right MCA of rats were occluded using the intraluminal technique as previously described (\nLiang\net al.\n, 2014\n;\nGubskiy\net al.\n, 2018\n). All rats were anesthetized firstly by intraperitoneal injection with ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Following subcutaneous injection of Atropine at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. The right common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA), and ICA were exposed in sequence. After ECA was ligatured, a nylon suture with a silicon tip was planted into the ICA via proximal ECA to occlude the MCA. After surgery, the incision was closed with sutures. All rats were recovering from anesthesia in a 37 \u00b0C container separately. The suture was withdrawn from a part of rats to establish MCA recanalization at 3 d after MCAO. Rats in sham were subjected the same procedures apart from MCA occlusion and recanalization.\n\n2.3. Study design\nAll survival rats divided randomly into pMCAO group or recanalization after MCAO (rMCAO) group following neurological scores test at 3 d after MCAO.\n2.3.1. Experiment I\nIncluding the sham group (n = 6), eight groups were established in experiment I. After neurological scores test to exclude the very terrible or perfect rats at 3d after MCAO, Rats (modified Garcia score ranging from 6 to 9) were randomly divided into seven groups (pMCAO 3d, pMCAO 4d, rMCAO 4d, pMCAO 10d, rMCAO 10d, pMCAO 30d, and rMCAO 30d). Western blot was performed to determine the time course of endogenous FGF21 and FGFR1 expression in penumbra (n = 6). Serum FGF21 was tested by ELISA (n = 6). Immunofluorescence staining was performed to identify the colocalization of FGF21 and FGFR1 with neurons at the peak of FGF21 expression (n = 3, three sections per slice were photographed).\n2.3.2. Experiment II\nTo evaluate the effects of recanalization on infarct and neurological outcomes, infarct volume (n = 6), modified Garcia (n = 9), and beam walking scores (n = 9) were assessed in eight groups (sham, pMCAO 3d, pMCAO 4d, rMCAO 4d, pMCAO 10d, rMCAO 10d, pMCAO 30d, and rMCAO 30d). Morris water maze was performed at 30 d after MCAO to evaluate spatial learning and memory capacity (n = 9). Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining were performed to test the cell death at 4 d after MCAO (i.e. 1 d after recanalization, n = 3, three sections per slice were photographed).\n2.3.3. Experiment III\nTo explore the underlying mechanisms of FGF21 mediated anti-apoptosis effects after recanalization, five groups were established, including sham, pMCAO, rMCAO, scrambled siRNA (Scr siRNA), and FGFR1 siRNA. Scrambled siRNA or FGFR1 siRNA GFP lentivirus were administered via intracerebroventricular injection at 1 h before MCAO. Recanalization was conducted at 3 d after MCAO. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to identify whether FGFR1 siRNA GFP lentivirus successfully transduced neurons at 4 d after pretreatment (n = 3). Western blot was performed at 4 d (i.e. 1 d after recanalization) after MCAO to test the expression of FGF21 and downstream proteins (n = 6). Infarct volume, modified Garcia Score, and meam walking scores were performed at 10 d after MCAO to evaluate the neurological outcomes (n = 6)\n\n2.4. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\nELISA was performed to test the serum FGF21 expression. Blood samples were collected into a serum separator tube. After clot formation and centrifuging at 2,000 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes (min), serum samples were collected and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. All reagents, working standards, and samples were prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction manuals of rat FGF-21 ELISA kit (ab223589, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). All 96-well plates were pre-coated with rat FGF21 antibodies. 50 \u03bcl of serum sample or standard were added to appropriate wells, then 50 \u03bcl of the antibody cocktail were added to each well. After incubating for 1 h on a plate shaker (400 rpm) at room temperature and washing each well with 3 \u00d7 350 \u03bcl 1X wash buffer PT, 100 \u03bcl of TMB substrate was added to each well and incubate for 10 min in the dark on a plate shaker (400 rpm). At last, 100 \u03bcl of stop solution was added to each well followed by plate shaking for 1 min to mix and recording optical density at 450 nm. Results were calculated and interpreted according to the instruction manual.\n\n2.5. Intracerebroventricular injection of siRNA\nTo investigate the potential molecular mechanism of the FGF21 anti-apoptosis effect, intracerebroventricular injection of FGFR1 siRNA GFP lentivirus was performed at 1 h before MCAO to knockdown FGFR1 expression in neurons. The FGFR1 siRNA GFP lentivirus eliminates any possible recombination events that can occur by a dual convergent promoter system, where the sense and antisense strands of the siRNA are expressed by two different promoters rather than in a hairpin loop. Intracerebroventricular injection was conducted as previously described (\nYu\net al.\n, 2018\n). Rats were anesthetized by 2.5% isoflurane and were placed in stereotaxic apparatus. The tip of 10 \u03bcl Hamilton syringe (Microliter 701; Hamilton Company, Reno, NV, USA) drilled into the right lateral ventricle via a burr hole. The stereotactic site of intracerebroventricular injection was relative to bregma: 1.5 mm posterior, 0.9 mm right lateral, and 3.3 mm depth. 5 \u03bcl of either scrambled siRNA GFP lentivirus or FGFR1 siRNA GFP lentivirus (Applied Biological Materials, Richmond, BC, CANADA) was injected 1 h before MCAO. The injection rate was 1 \u03bcl/min, and the needle was remained for 5 min after intracerebroventricular injection, and then was withdrawn over 5 min to prevent possible leaking. The burr hole was sealed with bone wax after injection. The incision was closed with sutures, and then rat was followed by MCAO surgery.\n\n2.6. Neurological score evaluation\nModified Garcia score and beam walking test were performed by a blinded investigator as previously described (\nGarcia\net al.\n, 1995\n;\nGoldstein and Davis, 1990\n). The modified Garcia score consists of 6 items (including spontaneous activity, symmetry in the movement of four limbs, forepaw outstretching, climbing, body proprioception, response to vibrissae touch) with a maximum score of 18. Beam walking test bases on a 0\u20135-point scale. A higher score in two tests accords with a better neurological performance.\n\n2.7. Morris water maze\nMorris water maze was performed with blinded strategy at 30 d after MCAO as previously described (\nXu\net al.\n, 2018\n;\nPu\net al.\n, 2016\n). Each rat was performed 5 trials in every day from 1 d to 5 d. The platform (diameter: 10 cm) was above the water surface and visible at 1 d (cued test). Rats may catch sight of and climb up the platform. Without finding the platform within 60 seconds (s), the rat should be guided to climb up the platform and remain on the platform for 10 s (block 1). From 2 d to 5 d (spatial test, blocks 2\u20135, 1 min each trial), the submerged platform was 1 cm below the water. The platform was removed at 6 d (probe trial), the time spent in the platform-quadrant was identified in trial for 1 min. Swim path, escape latency, swim distance, and the time spent in the platform-quadrant were recorded by a computerized tracking system (Noldus Ethovision; Noldus, Tacoma, WA, USA).\n\n2.8. Assessment of cerebral infarct volume\nTriphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining only was performed to calculate infarct volume at 3 d, 4 d, and 10 d after MCAO in this study. Rats were anesthetized and perfused with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The whole brain was rapidly taken out and sectioned coronally into 2 mm thick slices. Brain slices were incubated in 2% TTC (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 15 min and then photographed (\nGriemert\net al.\n, 2018\n). The infarct area and ipsilateral hemisphere of each brain slice were calculated via ImageJ (ImageJ 1.4; NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The brain edema after infarct was rectified by standard methods (whole contralateral hemispheric volume subtracts non-ischemic ipsilateral hemispheric volume). The final results were shown with a ratio of the corrected infarct volume to whole contralateral hemispheric volume (\nMcBride\net al.\n, 2016\n).\nNissl staining was performed to calculated the cerebral infarct volume at 30 d after MCAO. Rats were anesthetized by isoflurane and then perfused by ice cold PBS (100 ml) and 10% formaldehyde solution (100 ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The brains were taken out and immerged in 10% formaldehyde solution for 48 h, and then immersed into 30% sucrose solution for 3 d. Brains were sliced coronally with 20 \u03bcm thickness on a freezing microtome (LM3050S; Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, III, Germany). After sections were completely dried in a 50\u00b0C oven and placed at room temperature for 30 min, they were immerged into 95% Flex (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 1 min and 70% Flex for 1 min, respectively. After washing in distilled water for 30 s, the sections were incubated with Cresyl Violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 1 min, followed by rinsing in distilled water, dehydrating in 100% Flex, and clearing in xylene (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The sections were covered by slips with DPX Mountant (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and observed with light microscopy.\n\n2.9. Immunofluorescence staining\nThe brain samples were processed as same as the Nissl staining. Brains were sliced coronally with 8 \u03bcm thickness on the freezing microtome. Double immunofluorescence staining was performed at 4 d after MCAO as previously described (\nWu\net al.\n, 2018\n;\nXie\net al.\n, 2017\n;\nPang\net al.\n, 2018\n). Brain slices were rinsed by PBS for 3 times (5 min \u00d7 3) and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 10 min at room temperature. Subsequently, brain slices were washed by PBS for 3 times (5 min \u00d7 3) again and blocked with 5% donkey serum (566460, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 2 h, followed by incubating in different primary antibodies at 4 \u00b0C overnight: mouse anti-GFAP (1:150, ab16997, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), mouse anti-neuronal nuclei (NeuN, 1:200, ab177487, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), goat anti-Iba-1 (1:100, ab178847, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), rabbit anti-FGF21 (1:100, MBS2027242, MyBioSource, San Diego, CA, USA), rabbit anti-FGFR1 (1:100, ab10646, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), rabbit anti-FGFR1 (phospho Y654, 1:200, ab59194, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Brain slices were incubated with corresponding fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:150, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 2 h at room temperature next day. The slices were observed on a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMi8, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Three sections per slice were photographed.\n\n2.10. FJC staining\nFJC staining was performed to identify degenerating neurons as previously described (\nYu\net al.\n, 2018\n). According to the instruction of modified FJC ready-to-dilute staining kit (TR-100-FJ, Biosensis, Thebarton, South Australia), slides were incubated in mixture of sodium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 70% ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 5 min, followed by washing in 70% ethanol for 2 min and in distilled water for 2 min. Subsequently, slides were incubated in 0.06% potassium permanganate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) solution for 10 min, followed by rinsing in distilled water for 2 min. Slides then were incubated in 0.0001% FJC (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA) for 10 min, adding 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 10236276001, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and protecting from light. Slides were then rinsed (1 min x 3) in distilled water. After dried at 50\u201360\u00b0C for 5 min, slides were cleared by immersing in xylene for 1 min and added coverslips with DPX mountant. The slides were visualized in blinded strategy with fluorescence microscope Leica DMi8. FJC-positive neurons (cells/mm\n2\n) were calculated in three sections per slice.\n\n2.11. TUNEL staining\nTUNEL staining was performed to quantify of neuronal cell death according to the instruction of in situ cell death detection kit, fluorescein (11684795910, Roche, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Neuronal marker NeuN staining was performed at the same time. TUNEL-positive (green) cells and NeuN-positive (red) neurons were merged before calculation. The calculation methods of TUNEL positive cells is similar to that of FJC staining.\n\n2.12. Western blots analysis\nAfter TTC staining, the contralateral and ipsilateral cerebrums were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately, and then stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Western blot was performed as previously described (\nXie\net al.\n, 2017\n;\nNavarro-Oviedo\net al.\n, 2018\n). Cerebral tissue samples were homogenized with RIPA lysis buffer (sc-24948A, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) for 15 min and further centrifuged at 14,000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. The protein concentration of supernatant was tested by spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Same amount of protein samples were separated on 10%\u201312% SDS-PAGE gel by electrophoresis and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 \u03bcm). Subsequently, the whole membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat blocking milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (1706531, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and incubated in primary antibodies overnight: rabbit anti-FGF21 (1:1000), rabbit anti-FGFR1 (1:2000), rabbit anti-FGFR1 (Phospho Y654, 1:2000), rabbit anti-PI3K (1:2000, 4292S, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit anti-Caspase-3 (1:1000, ab90437, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), rabbit anti-cleaved Caspase-3 (1:1000, 9661S, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit anti-B-cell lymphoma 2 (anti-Bcl-2, 1:3000, sc-494, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, TX, USA), and mouse anti-Bcl-2-associated X protein (anti-Bax, 1:500, NBP1\u201328566, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA). Mouse anti-\u03b2-actin (1:3000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) as loading control. Next day, membranes were incubated in corresponding secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblots were probed by the ECL plus kit (RPN2232, Amersham Bioscience, Arlington Heights, IL, USA). Blot bands were quantified by densitometry with ImageJ software and then were shown as relative density to \u03b2-actin.\n\n2.13. Statistical analysis\nAll dates were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and was expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Statistical difference between groups were analyzed with one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by multiple comparisons (Tukey or Sidak test). In addition, survival curve was analyzed with Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Death toll and hemorrhage toll was analyzed with Fisher\u2019s exact test.\np\nvalue < 0.05 was defined as statistical significance."

    "Methods": "The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author, who is responsible for maintaining availability, upon request.\n\n2.1. Animals and surgeries\nAll experiments protocols and procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Loma Linda University. All studies were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 8023, revised 1978). Animal studies were reported according to ARRIVE guidelines. A total of one hundred and fifty-five pups were used, of which two died during the operations. P7 Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes were purchased from Envigo (Livermore, CA). GMH was induced as previously described (\nFeng et al., 2017\n). Briefly, animals were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and placed onto stereotaxic frame. Isoflurane concentration was then reduced to 2%. After the scalp area was disinfected, Bregma was exposed. A 1 mm burr hole at the following stereotactic coordinates was drilled: 1.6 mm (rostral) and 1.5 mm (lateral, right). A 27-gauge needle was inserted to a depth of 2.7 mm from the dura. Using a microinfusion pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), 0.3 U of clostridial collagenase VII-S (Sigma-Aldrich) in 3 \u03bcL was infused through the Hamilton syringe at the rate of 1 \u03bcL/min. The needle remained in place for an additional 5 minutes after injection to prevent leakage. The needle was then withdrawn at the rate of 0.5mm/min, the burr hole was sealed with bone wax and the incision was sutured. Pups were allowed to recover on a 37\u00b0C heated blanket. Upon the recovery from anesthesia, the animals were returned to their dams. Sham-operated animals were subjected to needle insertion alone without collagenase infusion.\n\n2.2. Drug Administration\nOlomoucine (Abcam) was administered at one hour post-ictus at the dose of 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg or 9mg/kg (i.p.) for three consecutive days for the three-day studies. For the 28-day studies, olomoucine (3mg/kg, i.p.) was administered for five consecutive days. EX527 (Cayman Chemical), a SIRT1 inhibitor, was administered at the dose of l0mg/kg (i.p.) with olomoucine for three consecutive days. 5% DMSO in sterile saline was the vehicle.\n\n2.3. Neurobehavioral tests\nShort-term neurobehavioral tests include negative geotaxis and right reflex. Both were performed on Day 3 after GMH. Negative geotaxis was performed by placing a pup on a 45 degree incline with its head down and recording the time it took for the pup to make a 180 degree turn. Righting reflex was performed by placing a pup on its back position and recording the time it took for the pup to right itself. These two tests are sensitive in evaluating the developmental profile in neonates.\nTo assess long-term neurological function, Morris water maze and Rotorod were performed between Day 22 and Day 27 after GMH. They tested cognitive function and motor function, respectively. Morris water maze was performed as previously described (\nWan et al., 2018\n). After the training block, animals went under 4 blocks to find the platform. The time it took for them to find the platform was recorded. At the end of the memory blocks, a probe trial was conducted with the platform removed to measure the percentage of time they spent in the quadrant where the platform was located. Rotorod was used to test the animal\u2019s ability to remain on an accelerating rod. The animal\u2019s falling latency was recorded. All the neurobehavioral tests were conducted in a blinded fashion with animals coded by numbers. After the data was analyzed, the treatment groups were uncoded.\n\n2.4. Immunofluorescence\nImmunofluorescence was performed as previously described (\nLu et al., 2019\n). Animals were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% formalin. After brains were removed, they were stored in 4% formalin at 4\u00b0C overnight and transferred to 30% sucrose for 3-5 days until they sank to the bottom. Brains were embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until they were sectioned. Eight micrometer-thick coronal sections were obtained using a cryostat (Leica). After sections were permeablized with 0.3% Triton-100X and blocked with 5% donkey serum, they were incubated with primary antibodies overnight. Appropriate secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were diluted to 1:200 and incubated for two hours at room temperature. Sections were mounted with PROLONG anti-fading media with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and visualized using a microscope (Leica). Primary antibodies were anti-GFAP (Abcam, ab16997), anti-AQP4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-9888), and anti-RECA-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-52665). Immunofluorescence intensity was measured using ImageJ (NIH). For AQP-4 measurement, AQP-4 was categorized into \u201cparavascular\u201d and \u201cstromal\u201d subtypes. We measured the fluorescence intensity for each AQP-4 and averaged them out for both categories. For cell counting, three areas were chosen in the periventricular area for imaging. Cells were counted in each image and cell numbers were averaged for each animal.\n\n2.5. CSF dynamics measurement\nAnimals were anesthetized intraperitoneally with a mixture of ketamine (80mg/kg) and xylazine (20mg/kg) until no pinch-paw reflex was observed. Anesthetized animals were fixed in a stereotaxic frame and a Hamilton syringe with a 30GA needle was inserted into the cisterna magna. Fluorescence tracer tetramethylrhodamine-dextran-3 (TR-3; molecular size 3kD; ThermoFisher) was reconstituted in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) at a concentration of 0.25% and a total volume of 45\u03bc1 was injected into the cisterna magna at the rate of 1.6\u03bc1/min(\nYang et al., 2013\n). 20 minutes after the infusion was finished, the deep cervical lymph nodes (dcLNs) were isolated. Animals were perfused with 4% formalin transcardially and brains were removed. The brains and dcLNs were incubated in 4% formalin overnight and transferred to 30% sucrose for another 3-4 days. Brains and dcLNs were then embedded in OCT and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until sectioning. l0\u03bcm coronal sections of the brains and dcLNs were collected with a cryostat (Leica) and visualized with fluorescence microscope (Leica). Fluorescence intensity was quantified using ImageJ (NIH).\nThe same tracer injection procedure was performed on another set of animals. Immediately after the injection, brains were removed and imaged using a two-photon microscope (Zeiss LSM 710 NLO). Two to three cortical arteries in the injured hemisphere were located in each brain and the paravascular area was imaged to evaluate tracer dispersion. For each vessel, three or four regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen randomly for fluorescence intensity measurement. Intensity was quantified in ImageJ (NIH).\n\n2.6. Histological volumetric study\n28 days after GMH, animals were sacrificed, and brains were collected. Nissl staining was performed as previously described (\nManaenko et al., 2014\n). Optical dissector principles were used to delineate cerebral structure borders following previously defined criteria from stereologic neuroanatomical studies. Volumes were calculated as the average delineated area from 10\u03bcm sections taken approximately at 1.70mm and 0.70mm rostral to Bregma, and 1.88mm and 3.30mm caudal to Bregma(\nWan et al., 2018\n). ImageJ (NIH) was used to analyze ventricular volume, cortical thickness and white matter area in Niss1 stained histological brain sections as previously described (\nKlebe et al., 2014\n).\n\n2.7. Western blot\nFor whole cell protein analysis, tissues were lysed using RIP A Lysis Buffer System (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) following the manufacturer\u2019s the instructions. For nuclear protein analysis, NEPER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Thermo Scientific) were used to isolate nuclear protein lysates according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Western blot was performed as previously described (\nYu et al., 2018\n). Briefly, 30\u03bcg protein lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% milk for 1 h, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. Appropriate secondary antibodies (1:4000, Santa Cruz) were used for two-hour incubation at room temperature. Membranes were visualized by ECL plus kit (GE Healthcare and Life Science). Primary antibodies: anti-GFAP (Abcam, abl6997), anti-PCNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-9857), anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-1616), anti-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-9104), anti-AQP4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-9888), anti-phospho-Rb (Abeam, ab47474), anti-Rb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-102), anti-SIRT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-15404), anti-Cyclin E (Millipore, 07-687), anti-Cyclin D1 (Abcam, abl34175), anti-Iba-1 (Abcam, abl78847) and anti-Lamin B (Abcam, ab133741).\n\n2.8. Rigor and statistical analysis\nIn this study, animals were numbered and randomly formed into different experimental groups using Excel. All the experimental groups were blinded for the surgeons and researchers who performed all outcomes and analyzed the data. Sample size was determined according to our previous publications for similar outcomes. Samples size was estimated using a type I error rate of 0.05 and a power of 0.8 on a 2-sided test by power analysis. Parametric data was analyzed was using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s\npost-hoc\ntest. Longitudinal data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s\npost-hoc\ntest. Data were expressed as mean\u00b1 SD.\nP\nvalues of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. GraphPad Prism 6 (La Jolla, CA, USA) and SigmaPlot 11.0 (SysStat, Germany) were used for graphing and analyzing all the data."

    "Methods": "Drugs.\nPaclitaxel was purchased from Tocris (1097, Bristol, United Kingdom) and dissolved in a mixture of 1:1:18 [1 volume ethanol/1 volume Emulphor-620 (Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., Princeton, NJ)/18 volumes distilled water]. Paclitaxel was administered at a dose of 8 mg/kg i.p for one cycle to induce CIPN intraperitoneally (i.p.) every other day for a total of four injections to induce neuropathy, as previously described by (\nToma et al., 2017\n). All the reversal and mechanistic studies were conducted at day 7\u201314 after initial paclitaxel injection unless otherwise noticed. The silent agonist R-47, (R)-N-(4-Methoxyphenyl)-2-((pyridin-3-yloxy)methyl)piperazine-1-carboxamide Dihydrochloride, was synthesized by following the experimental procedure reported by (\nClark et al., 2014\n). R-47 was dissolved in distilled water (D.W).\nFor acute administration, R-47 was injected per os (p.o.) at doses of 1, 5, 10 mg/kg. The range of doses used in this study were chosen based on the previous studies that showed R-47 was effective to reduce the inflammatory response in different inflammatory pain assays (\nClark et al., 2014\n;\nvan Maanen et al., 2015\n). For chronic administration (prevention study), R-47 was injected p.o. at a dose of 10 mg/kg twice daily (8 hours apart) 3 days prior and during paclitaxel injection cycle. Von Frey test was performed 24 hours after daily R-47 treatment. For the tolerance study, we chose the dose that fully reversed and prevented CIPN. For that, R-47 was administered p.o. at a dose of 10 mg/kg twice daily (8 hours apart) for 4 days to paclitaxel-treated group of mice. Methyllycaconitine (MLA) was purchased from RBI (Natick, MA, USA), dissolved in saline and was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c.) 10 minutes before administration of R-47 (\nFreitas et al., 2013\n).\n(\u2212)-Nicotine hydrogen tartrate [(\u2212)-1-methyl-2-(3- pyridyl) pyrrolidine (+)-bitartrate] and mecamylamine HCl (non-selective nAChR antagonist) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Drugs were dissolved in physiological saline and administered subcutaneously (s.c.). Freshly prepared solutions were given to mice at 10 ml/kg. All doses are expressed as the free base of the drug. For the tumor-bearing animal study, paclitaxel was purchased from the VCU Health Pharmacy (NDC# 0703-4768-01, TEVA Pharmaceuticals, North Wales, PA) and diluted in a mixture of 1:1:18 [1 volume ethanol/1 volume Emulphor-620 (Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., Princeton, NJ)/18 volumes distilled water]. Paclitaxel injections of 10 mg/kg were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) every day for a total of four injections; the injection site was swabbed with 70% ethanol prior to injection. R-47 was administered chronically at a dose of 10 mg/kg twice daily (one dose in the morning and one dose in the afternoon) via oral gavage for three days, then once daily in the morning followed by a 3-hour rest before a paclitaxel/vehicle injection for 4 days. These paclitaxel and R-47 regimens were chosen based on previous unpublished studies that demonstrated which dose, duration of exposure, and route of administration for each drug effectively arrested tumor growth or prevented paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy, respectively, but were not toxic to the animal. All i.p., s.c., and p.o. injections were given in a volume of 10 ml/kg body weight.\nFor the cell culture studies, paclitaxel was dissolved in DMSO, diluted with sterile PBS, and added to the medium in order to obtain the desired concentration. Cells were not exposed to greater than 0.1% DMSO in any experiment. R-47 was dissolved in sterile PBS. All experiments involving these light-sensitive drugs were performed in the dark.\n\nAnimals.\nAdult male C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks at the beginning of experiments, 20\u201330 g) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Adult ICR male mice (8 weeks at the beginning of experiments, 25\u201330 g) were purchased from Envigo Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). Adult male NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice (8 weeks at the beginning of experiments, 20\u201330 g) were received as a gift from Dr. J. Chuck Harrell at Virginia Commonwealth University. Mice were housed in an AAALAC-accredited facility in groups of four. Food and water were available ad libitum. The mice in each cage were randomly allocated to different treatment groups. All behavioral testing on animals was performed in a blinded manner; behavioral assays were conducted by an experimenter blinded to the treatment groups. Experiments were performed during the light cycle (7:00 am to 7:00 pm) and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Virginia Commonwealth University and followed the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Animals were euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation, followed by cervical dislocation. Any subjects that showed behavioral disturbances unrelated to chemotherapy-induced pain were excluded from further behavioral testing.\n\nMechanical Sensitivity Evaluation (von Frey test).\nMechanical hypersensitivity thresholds were determined using von Frey filaments according to the method suggested by (\nChaplan et al., 1994\n) and as described in our previous report (\nBagdas et al., 2015\n). The mechanical threshold is expressed as log10 (10 \u00a3 force in [mg]).\n\nLocomotor Activity Test.\nThe test was performed as previously described by Bagdas et al (\nBagdas et al., 2015\n) Briefly, mice were placed into individual Omnitech (Columbus, OH) photocell activity cages (28 \u00d7 16.5 cm) containing two banks of eight cells each. Interruptions of the photocell beams, which assess walking and rearing, were then recorded for the next 30 min. Data are expressed as the number of photocell interruptions. R-47 (10 mg/kg, p.o.) or distilled water was administered to paclitaxel or vehicle groups of mice 180 min before testing in locomotor boxes.\n\nRotarod Test.\nThe rotarod test (IITC Inc. Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA, USA) was used to assess motor coordination as previously described by Freitas et al (\nFreitas et al., 2013\n). Percent impairment was calculated as follows: % impairment = [(180 _test time)/180] * 100. R-47 (10 mg/kg, p.o.) or distilled water was administered to paclitaxel or vehicle groups of mice 180 min before testing.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and Characterization of Morphological Changes of Microglial Cells.\nFor the prevention study, the hind paw plantar skin was collected from the following groups of mice: vehicle-vehicle, vehicle-R-47 (10 mg/kg/), paclitaxel (8 mg/kg)-vehicle, and paclitaxel (8 mg/kg)-R-47 (10 mg/kg). The staining procedure was performed as previously described (\nToma et al., 2017\n) with slight modifications. The glabrous skin of the hind paw was excised, placed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4), and stored overnight at 4\u00b0C in the same fixative. Tissues were transferred to 30% sucrose and stored overnight in the refrigerator. Samples were embedded in optimum cutting temperature (O.C.T) compound (cat# 23-730-571, Fisher Scientific, USA) and twenty-micron cryostat sections were collected on glass slides for. Sections were immersed in ice-cold acetone for 20 minutes, washed with PBS, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in blocking solution (5% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS). Sections were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of the primary antibody, PGP9.5 (Fitzgerald - cat# 70R-30722, MA, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humidity chamber. Following PBS washes, sections were incubated for 90 min at room temperature with a 1:250 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 594 (Life Technologies - cat# A11037, OR, USA). Sections were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and examined using a Zeiss Axio Imager A1 \u2013 Fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, AG, Germany). Sections were examined in a blinded fashion under 63x magnification. Main fibers were counted in real time by dynamically focusing and following nerve fibers once they crossed the junction of the basement membrane. Density of fibers is expressed as fibers/mm.\nSpinal cords from the same groups of mice mentioned previously were collected by hydraulic extrusion (\nRichner et al., 2017\n). The L4\u2013L6 lumbar region of the spinal cord was collected and transferred to a freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) and stored overnight at 4\u00b0C in the same fixative. Twenty-micron cryostat sections were collected on glass slides and immunostained for microglia according to the same protocol used for the IENFs using the rabbit polyclonal anti-ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 (Wako chemicals, cat# 019\u201319741, Richmond, VA, USA). Characterization of microglial cell morphology was based on a previous study by (\nZheng et al., 2011\n) with modifications. Microglial cells were binned into three main stages; Stage I: cells with long, thin, and highly ramified processes, Stage II: cells with shorter, thickened processes with less branching, and Stage III: cells displaying more hypertrophic changes such as short, thickened processes and enlargement of the cell body.\nRegions of the dorsal horn including laminae 1\u20135 were examined using a Zeiss AxioImager Z2 equipped with a motorized XY stage, microcator Microbrightfield Neurolucida and Stereo Investigator image analysis software (MBF Bioscience, VT, USA). Microglia were identified and scored as indicated above using a 63x oil immersion objective in a blinded fashion. Images were acquired as z-stacks and results are reported as number of microglial cells per section.\n\nConditioned Place Preference (CPP) Test.\nTo determine if R-47 could alleviate spontaneous, ongoing pain in paclitaxel-treated mice but not in vehicle-treated mice, an unbiased CPP paradigm was conducted as previously described by (\nGrabus et al., 2012\n) with modifications. Briefly, the CPP test boxes (20\u00d720\u00d720 cm each; ENV3013; Med Associates, St Albans, VT, USA) consist of two main chambers equipped with two different colors and textures (white mesh or black rod), and a neutral gray middle chamber with a smooth PVC floor. Mice were handled for three weeks prior to conditioning. Mice were placed into the gray chamber to acclimate for 5 min, then allowed to freely move between all CPP boxes for 15 min. This is considered the preconditioning baseline measurement. After that, mice were assigned randomly into four groups; one paclitaxel group received distilled water and the other paclitaxel group received R-47 at a dose of 10 mg/kg p.o.; a similar approach was applied to the vehicle-treated groups. Mice received R-47 or its vehicle (distilled water) on alternative days. i.e. the group that received R-47 on one day (one injection per day) should receive distilled water on the next. A total 8 conditioning days was applied. R-47 or vehicle was administered two hours prior to placing the mice into the corresponding CPP boxes for 30 min. On the test day, mice were placed into the gray CPP box and allowed to freely move between the boxes for 15 min in a drug-free state. The preference score was calculated by determining the difference between time spent in the drug-paired side on the test day minus the time in the drug-paired side on the baseline day. An alternative experimental design was implemented to test wither R-47 would affect nicotine\u2019s rewarding properties (\nJackson et al., 2017\n). On day 1, animals were confined to the middle chamber for a 5-min habituation and then allowed to freely move between all three chambers for 15 min. Time spent in each chamber was recorded, and these data were used to populate groups of approximately equal bias in baseline chamber preference. Twenty-minute conditioning sessions occurred twice a day (days 2\u20134). During conditioning sessions, mice were confined to one of the larger chambers. The control groups received saline in one large chamber in the morning and saline in the other large chamber in the afternoon. The drug group received nicotine in one large chamber and saline in the other large chamber. On each of the conditioning days, mice were pretreated with R-47 (at 1 or 10 mg/kg, p.o) or vehicle 120 min prior to nicotine. Treatments were counterbalanced to ensure some mice received the unconditioned stimulus in the morning and others received it in the afternoon. The drug-paired chamber was randomized across groups. Sessions were 4 hours apart and were conducted by the same investigator. On test day (day 5), mice could access all chambers for 15 min in a drug free state. The preference score was calculated by determining the difference between time spent in the drug paired side on the test day versus the time in drug paired side on the baseline day.\n\nNicotine Precipitated Withdrawal Studies.\nMice were infused with 24 mg/kg/day nicotine or saline for 14 days using s.c. osmotic minipumps (model 2000; Alzet Corporation, Cupertino, CA) implanted under isoflurane anesthesia (\nJackson et al., 2008\n). Nicotine concentration was adjusted according to animal weight and mini pump flow rate. On the morning of day 15, mice were pretreated with vehicle, R-47 (10 mg/kg, p.o; 120 min prior) before challenge with the non-selective nAChR antagonist, mecamylamine (2 mg/kg, s.c.) to precipitate withdrawal. Anxiety-like behaviors, somatic signs and hyperalgesia nicotine withdrawal signs were evaluated 10 min later as described in Jackson et al (\nJackson et al., 2008\n). Mice were first evaluated for 5 min in the Light-dark box (LBD) Test. The number of entries into the light compartment, the number of transitions and the total time spent in the light compartment were recorded for 5 min by a video monitoring technique and ANY-MAZE software (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). Animals were then observed for 30 min time for somatic signs measured as paw and body tremors, head shakes, backing, jumps, curls, and ptosis. Mice were placed in clear activity cages without bedding for the observation period. The total number of somatic signs was tallied for each mouse and the average number of somatic signs during the observation period was plotted for each test group. Hyperalgesia was finally evaluated using the hot plate test immediately following the somatic sign observation period. Mice were placed into a 10-cm wide glass cylinder on a hot plate (Thermojust Apparatus, Richmond, VA) maintained at 52\u00b0C. The latency to reaction time (jumping or paw licking) was recorded. The specific testing sequence was chosen based on our prior studies showing that this order of testing reduced within-group variability and produced the most consistent results (\nJackson et al., 2008\n). All studies were performed by an observer blinded to experimental treatment.\n\nCell Culture.\nA549 and H460 NSCLC cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Serum Source International, FB22-500HI, NC, USA) and 1% (v/v) combination of 10,000 U/ml penicillin and 10,000 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (Pen/Strep, ThermoFisher Scientific, 15140\u2013122, Carlsbad, CA), unless stated otherwise. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C under a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. The A549 and H460 cell lines were generously provided by the laboratories of Dr. Charles Chalfant and Dr. Richard Moran at VCU, respectively. The A549 and H460 cell lines were authenticated as exact matches for the corresponding ATCC cell lines by the ATCC STR Cell Line Authentication Service in August of 2018.\n\nAssessment of cell viability.\nCell viability was measured by either the MTT or MTS colorimetric assay or trypan blue exclusion. On the day of testing, the medium was removed, and cells were washed with PBS and stained with thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT, 2 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, M2128, St. Louis, MO) in PBS for 3 hours. The MTT solution was then aspirated and replaced with DMSO. The color change was measured by a spectrophotometer (ELx800UV, BioTek, VT) at 490 nm. To avoid potentially aspirating cells, the CellTiter 96\u00ae Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS; Promega, G358C, Madison, WI) was utilized for the less adherent A549 cell line. For trypan blue exclusion, cells were incubated with trypsin (0.25% trypsin-EDTA) for 3 minutes, stained with trypan blue (Invitrogen, 15250, Carlsbad, CA), and the viable, unstained cells were counted using a hemocytometer with bright-field microscopy.\n\nAssessment of colony formation.\nCells were seeded at a low density in DMEM. Once the untreated control colonies reached a size of approximately 50 cells per colony, the samples were fixed with methanol, stained with crystal violet, and quantified (ColCount, Discovery Technologies International).\n\nAssessment of apoptosis and DNA content.\nFlow cytometry analyses were performed using BD FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and BD FACSDiva software at the Virginia Commonwealth University Flow Cytometry Core facility. For all studies, 10,000 cells per replicate within the gated region were analyzed. When collecting samples, both adherent and floating cells were harvested with 0.1% trypsin-EDTA and neutralized with medium after 48 hours of drug exposure. For quantification of apoptosis, cells were centrifuged and washed with PBS, then resuspended in 100 \u03bcl of 1x binding buffer with 5 \u03bcl of Annexin V and 5 \u03bcl of propidium iodide (BD Biosciences, FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit, 556547, San Jose, CA). The samples were then incubated at room temperature while protected from light for 15 minutes. The suspension solution was then brought up to 500 \u03bcl using the 1x binding buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry. For quantification of DNA content, the cells were resuspended in 500 \u03bcl of a propidium iodide (PI) solution (50 \u03bcg/ml PI, 4 mM sodium citrate, 0.2 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A, and 0.1% Triton-X 100) for 1 hour at room temperature, while being protected from light (\nTate et al., 1983\n). Before flow cytometry analysis, NaCl was added to the cell suspensions to achieve a final concentration of 0.20 M.\n\nAssessment of tumor growth\nin vivo\n.\nMale NSG mice were subcutaneously injected with 1.5 \u00d7 106 A549 NSCLC cells in both flanks. The A549 cells were collected via trypsinization, then neutralized with medium, centrifuged, and washed with PBS. Pellets of 1.5 \u00d7 106 A549 cells were then resuspended in 30 \u03bcl of 80% basement membrane extract (Trevigen, 3632-010-02, Gaithersburg, MD)/20% PBS. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2% isoflurane/98% oxygen) via inhalation during tumor cell inoculation; the injection site was swabbed with 70% ethanol prior to injection. Palpable tumors formed at approximately 20 days post-tumor cell inoculation, after which tumor volumes (l \u00d7 w \u00d7 h) were assessed with calipers every 2 to 3 days. Tumor volume was observed until humane endpoints were reached (tumor volume exceeds 1 cm3), at which time mice were euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation. Tumors were then extracted, weighed, and preserved in 10% formalin.\n\nStatistical Analyses\nData were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism software version 8.0.2 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA) and expressed as the mean \u00b1 S.E.M. A three-way ANOVA with repeated measures was used to determine the overall interaction of the three factors (time, vehicle/paclitaxel treatment, distilled water/R-47 treatment) in the prevention study. A subsequent two-way ANOVA with repeated measures, followed by the Sidak post hoc test, was used to determine the difference between treatment groups at multiple time points in the reversal and prevention studies with R-47. An ordinary twoway ANOVA followed by the Sidak or Tukey post hoc tests were conducted in the R-47 tolerance, immunohistochemistry, and CPP studies as appropriate. For the\nin vitro\nlung cancer studies, one- and two-way ANOVAs were conducted and followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test. For the tumor-bearing animal study, a two-way linear mixed model was performed to account for missing values during delayed tumor growth (\nToutenburg, 1991\n), and student\u2019s t-tests were performed to analyze tumor weight. All analyses were two-sided. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05."

    "Methods": "Cell culture and treatment\nNCCs (Joma1.3 cells) were cultured as previously described (\nChen et al., 2013b\n). Cells were grown on culture dishes coated with fibronectin and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM): Ham's F12 (1:1) at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2/95% air. For ethanol treatment, NCCs were treated with 50 or 100 mM ethanol. The stable ethanol levels were maintained by placing the cell culture dishes or plates in a plastic desiccator containing ethanol in distilled water, as described previously (\nYan et al., 2010\n).\n\nInduction of neuronal differentiation from NCCs\nNeuronal differentiation of NCCs was conducted as described by Maurer et al. (\nMaurer et al., 2007\n). Briefly, cells were seeded at approximately 30% confluence onto dishes sequentially coated with Poly-D-Lysin (1mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, Billerica, MA, USA) and fibronectin (1mg/mL, Bedford, MA, USA). After cells were cultured in NCC medium for 24 hours, BMP-2 (50 ng/mL, R&D system, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was added to the culture medium to induce neuronal differentiation. To determine the effects of ethanol exposure on neural differentiation of NCCs, NCCs pre-treated with BMP-2 for 24 hours were treated with 100 mM ethanol for 4, 8, 24 or 48 hours. After 6 days of differentiation in BMP-2-containing medium, a neuronal marker, Neurofilament (NF), was used to detect the neural differentiation of NCCs.\n\nqRT-PCR and Western Blotting\nQuantitative Real-time PCR was performed as previously described (\nYuan et al., 2018\n). Briefly, the mRNAs were extracted from NCCs by using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The cDNAs were synthesized by using the QuantiTect\n\u00ae\nReverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Primers used for qRT-PCR analyses were: Neurofilament-MF: forward: 5\u2019-GCAGCCAAACTGAACACAGA-3\u2019; reverse: 5\u2019-CCATCTCCCACTTGGTGTTT-3\u2019. Mash1: forward: 5\u2019-TTGAACTCTATGGCGGGTTC-3\u2019; reverse: 5 \u2019 -GGGCTTAGGTTCAGACACCA-3 \u2019. Atg9a: forward: 5\u2019-TGAGAGCACAGCTTTCCTGG-3\u2019; reverse: 5\u2019-ATCTCGGTGGACGCGTATTC-3\u2019. The qRT-PCR reaction was performed using FastStart SYBR Green Master (Roche Applied, Indianapolis, IN, USA) on a Rotor-Gene 6000 Real-Time PCR system (Corbett Life Science, Sydney, Australia), and the relative gene expression was calculated using \u0394\u0394CT method.\nWestern Blotting was performed by the standard protocol as previously described (\nYuan et al., 2017\n). NCCs were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 150mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and protease inhibitors (Cocktail, Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The whole cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000\n\u00d7g\nfor 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, and the proteins in supernatants were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA). Primary antibodies used for this study were as follows: Mouse monoclonal anti-Neurofilament antibody (CST, Beverly, MA, USA), mouse monoclonal anti-Mash1 antibody (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA), rabbit monoclonal anti-Atg9a antibody (CST, Beverly, MA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3B antibody (CST, Beverly, MA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-p62 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), and mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (Santacruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). After incubation with secondary antibodies, the proteins were visualized using a SuperSignal West Femto kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) under Gel Doc\u2122 XR Imaging System (Bio-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). The densitometry of the blots was analyzed using Adobe Photoshop CS software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA).\n\nImmunofluorescence\nNCCs from control and treated groups were washed with PBS and then fixed with 4% PFA followed by adding 0.25% TritonX-100 for 10 min. After blocking in 4% fetal bovine serum for 1 hour, the cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-p62 (1: 300, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3B (1:300, CST, Beverly, MA, USA), or mouse monoclonal anti-Neurofilament antibody (CST, Beverly, MA, USA) for 2 hours at room temperature, followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1: 300, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) or Alexa Fluor 594-conjuagated donkey anti-mouse antibody (1:500, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were then counterstained with DAPI and photographed under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IMT-2, Tokyo, Japan).\n\nAnalysis of microRNA expression\nThe expression of miRNA was analyzed as described previously (\nChen et al., 2015\n). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from NCCs using the\nmir\nVana\u2122 miRNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed by using the TaqMan\n\u00ae\nMicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA) in a reaction mixture containing a miR- specific stem-loop reverse transcription primer (has-miR-34a: RT-000426, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Quantitative PCR amplification was performed using TaqMan\n\u00ae\nUniversal PCR Master Mix kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA) with a sequence-specific Taqman probe (has-miR-34a: TM-000426, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) on a Rotor-Gene 6000 Real-Time PCR system (Corbett Life Science, Sydney, Australia). Data were normalized with snoRNA202 as endogenous control, and the relative expression of miR-34a was calculated using the \u0397\u0397CT method.\n\nCell transfection\nFor transient transfection of NCCs, control and p62 siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA), miR-34a mimic (Ambion, Foster, CA, USA), or miR-34a inhibitor (Ambion, Foster, CA, USA) were transfected into NCCs, respectively, by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cells were harvested 24 hours after transfection for additional treatment and analysis.\n\nDual luciferase reporter assays\nmiR-34a target sites in the 3\u2019-UTR regions of Atg9a mRNA were predicted by using the online database, Target Scan (\nhttp://www.Targetscan.org/\n), as described previously (\nChen et al., 2015\n). The 3\u2019-UTR of Atg9a containing putative miR34a binding sites were amplified from mouse genomic DNA using the following primers 5\u2019-GACTACTAGTCAGCCCAGTCCCAGTACTGCCATCTTTGCATCCACCCAAGCTTGCTA-3\u2019; 5\u2019-TAGCAAGCTTGGGTGGATGCAAAGATGGCAGTACTGGGACTGGGCTGACTAGTAGTC-3\u2019 and cloned into pMIR-Luciferase-Report plasmid (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA). Renilla luciferase pRL-TK control vector was used as a control. The constructs (200ng of plasmid/well of 24-well plates) were co-transfected with 20 ng Renilla luciferase pRL-TK control vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and 50 nmol of miR-34a mimics or control mimics (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) into NCCs by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Luciferase activity was measured 48 hours after the transfection by using the Dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) with a Lumat LB9507 Ultra Sensitive Tube Luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The relative activity of luciferase of each sample was normalized to the pRL-TK driven Renilla luciferase activity.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). All data were expressed as means \u00b1 SEM of at least three independent experiments. Comparisons between groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Differences between groups were considered significant at\np<\n0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals:\nAnimals used in this study were managed in accordance with the guidelines provided by the NIH and IACUC at the Ohio State University. All chickens (\nGallus gallus domesticus\n; white leghorn strain) were obtained at P0 from Meyer Hatchery (Polk, Ohio). The chicks were housed in a stainless-steel brooder maintained at 25\u00b0C with a 12-hour light and dark cycle (8am-8pm). Chicks were fed water and Purina chick starter\nad libitum\n.\n\nPreparation of clodronate liposomes:\nThe production of clodronate liposomes was modified from previous descriptions (\nVan Rooijen, 1989\n;\nZelinka et al., 2012\n). Briefly, 8 mg of L-\u03b1-Phosphatidyl-DL-glycerol sodium salt (Sigma P8318) was dissolved in chloroform. 50 mg of cholesterol dissolved in chloroform was added to the lipids and evaporated under nitrogen/vacuum with frequent shaking to create a thin lipid-film on a round bottom flask. 158 mg dichloro-methylene diphosphonate (clodronate; Sigma-Aldrich) in sterile PBS was added and mixed. To facilitate lipid rehydration, the vial was vortexed for 5 minutes. To normalize lipid vesicle size, the mixture was sonicated at 42,000 Hz for 6 minutes. The liposomes were centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 15 minutes, aspirated, and resuspended in 150 \u00b5l PBS. While there is some loss of liposomes during the purification, the dosage has been tittered such that >99% of the microglia are ablated 2 days after administration.\n\nIntraocular injections:\nIntraocular injections of anesthetized chickens were conducted as previously described (\nFischer et al., 1998\n,\n2009\n). Briefly, prior to injection chicks were anesthetized via inhalation of 2.5% isoflurane and oxygen. The right eye was treated with experimental compound and the contralateral left eye received vehicle control in each paradigm. Each injection was 20 \u00b5l with the addition of 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumen as a carrier for dilute recombinant protein injections. Information and concentrations of all compounds injected into the eyes of the chicks is provided in\nTable 2\n.\nTable 2.\nInjectable drugs. The following compounds were injected into the chick eye and include the manufacturer, catalog number, and dosage.\nDrug\ncompany\nproduct number\ndosage (1dose = 20\u03bcl)\n5-ethynyl-2\u2019-deoxyuridine (Edu)\nThermoFischer\nA10044\n2\u03bcg/dose\nFGF2\nR&D Systems\n234-FSE\n250ng/dose\nSB-3CT\nCayman Chemical\n292605\u201314-2\n120\u03bcM/dose\nMMP2i-II\nCayman Chemical\n869577\u201351-5\n120\u03bcM/dose\nMMP9i-I\nCayman Chemical\n206549\u201355-5\n120\u03bcM/dose\nrecombinant TIMP2\nAbcam\nab125639\n250ng/dose\nOpen in a new tab\n\nScRNA-seq\nChick retinas were dissected, the pigmented epithelium was carefully removed, and dissociation performed in a 0.25% papain solution of Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution, pH = 7.4, for 30 minutes with frequent trituration. Dissociated cells were assessed for viability and density and diluted to 700 cell/\u00b5l with the goal establishing a single cell cDNA library of 10,000 cells per preparation. Cells and Chromium Single Cell 3\u2019 V2 reagents (10X Genomics) were loaded onto chips for nanodroplet packaging in the 10x Chromium Controller. In accordance with 10x Genomics instructions, cDNA and library amplification was achieved by 12 and 10 cycles respectively. Sequencing was conducted on Illumina HiSeq2500 (Genomics Resource Core Facility, John\u2019s Hopkins University) with 26 bp for Read 1 and 98 bp for Read 2. Fasta sequencing files were aligned, de-multiplexed, annotated to the ENSMBLE database, counted for expression levels, and gene-cell matrices were constructed. Using Cell Browser software (10x Genomics), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) plots were generated from aggregates of multiple scRNA-seq libraries. Compiled in each tSNE plot are two biological replicates for saline injected retinas, 24 hrs, 48 hrs, and 72 hrs after NMDA damage. Identification of different types of retinal cells that were clustered together in tSNE plots was accomplished by probing for well-established cell-distinguishing genes. Seurat was used to construct violin/scatter plots (\nButler et al., 2018\n) and Monocle was used to construct pseudo-time trajectories and scatter plotters for M\u00fcller glia and MGPCs (\nQiu et al., 2017a\n,\n2017b\n;\nTrapnell et al., 2014\n).\n\nFixation, sectioning and immunocytochemistry\nRetinal samples were fixed, sectioned, and immunolabeled as previously described (\nFischer et al., 2008\n;\nGallina et al., 2014\n,\n2015\n). All primary antibodies used in this study are described in\nTable 1\n. The following secondary antibodies are included in this study: donkey-anti-goat-Alexa488/568, goat-anti-rabbit-Alexa488/568 and goat-anti-mouse-Alexa488/568/647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Secondary antibodies are diluted in pH 7.4 PBS plus 0.2% Triton-X and washed in pH 7.4 PBS. Secondaries did not produce non-specific labeling in the retina and tissue sections were devoid of autofluorescence.\nTable 1.\nImmunostaining Antibodies.

A hydrogel precursor solution was prepared as described previously with slight modification (\nLeight et al., 2013\n). Briefly, eight-arm 40-kDa poly (ethylene) glycol hydroxyl (JenKem Technologies) was functionalized with 5-norbornene-2-carboxylic acid (Sigma) to form poly (ethylene) glycol-norbornene (PEG-NB) (\nFairbanks et al., 2009\n). The PEG-NB (20 mM) macromer was crosslinked with a bicysteine MMP-degradable peptide (KCGPQG\u2193IWGQCK, 10.75 mM peptide; GenScript) in the presence of the photoinitiator, lithium phenyl-2, 4, 6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP, 2 mM). CRGDS (GenScript), a cell adhesion peptide, was also included at a concentration of 1 mM. MMP activity was measured by incorporation of a MMP-degradable peptide (GGPQG\u2193IWGQK\nDde\n(PEG)\n2\nC, 0.25 mM) conjugated with a fluorophore (Fluorescein; Life Technologies) and quencher (Dabcyl; AnaSpec) pair. Ten microliters of the hydrogel precursor solution were pipetted into a 96-well, round-bottom, black plate (BrandTech). Tissue samples were immersed into the hydrogel solution and polymerized under 4 mW/cm\n2\nUV light (365 nm) for 3 min. 150 \u00b5L of DMEM:F12 media (Life Technologies) supplemented with 1% (v/v) charcoal-stripped FBS (VWR), 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% L-glutamine were added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\n. 18 hours post-encapsulation, AlamarBlue (LifeTechnologies) reagent (1:10) was added to each well to measure tissue metabolic activity. Fluorescence measurements of the MMP-degradable peptide (494 nm excitation/521 nm emission) and AlamarBlue (560 nm excitation/590 nm emission) were made simultaneously in each well at 24 hours after encapsulation with a 3 \u00d7 3 well scan using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax M2 spectrophotometer. Readings of average fluorescence intensity were calculated for each well scan and the background reading (peptide-functionalized gels containing no tissue samples) was subtracted. All fluorescence intensity measurements were normalized to sample mass or metabolic activity and averaged between replicates.\n\nIn situ zymography staining\nRetinal tissue was fixed for 48hrs at room temperature (RT) in zinc-based fixative consisting of 36.7mM ZnCl\n2\n(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 27.3mM ZnAc\n2\n\u00d7 2H\n2\nO (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA), and 0.63mM CaAc\n2\n(Spectrum Chemical MFG Corp, New Brunswick, NJ) dissolved in 0.1M Tris-HCl (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 7.4. OCT embedded retinas were sectioned (20 \u00b5m), air dried at RT for at least one hour, and rinsed with deionized water to remove excess OCT. Sections were then incubated in a humidity chamber at 37\u00b0C for 1hr with either 200\u00b5M 1,10-Phenanthroline (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in water (MMP inhibitor control), or at 4\u00b0C for 1hr (temperature control). After incubation, solutions were removed and 20\u00b5g/mL fluorescein conjugated dye quenched (DQ) gelatin from pig skin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), \u00b1200\u00b5M 1,10-Phenanthroline, was diluted in reaction buffer [10mM Tris-HCl, 30mM NaCl (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 1mM CaCl\n2\n(Fisher Scientific), and 0.04mM sodium azide (Fisher Scientific). Sections were then incubated at 37\u00b0C or 4\u00b0C for 2hr in a dark humidity chamber. Slides were rinsed in water then fixed with 4% neutral buffered formalin for 10min at RT and then rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Gibco, Waltham, MA) twice, for 2min each. Nuclei were then stained with 1:1000 Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies) in PBS for 30min at RT. Slides were mounted using ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).\n\nPhotography, measurements, cell counts and statistics:\nMicroscopy images were captured with the Leica DM5000B microscope with epifluorescence and the Leica DC500 digital camera. Confocal images were obtained with a Leica SP8 in The Department of Neuroscience Imaging Facility at The Ohio State University. Representative images have enhanced color, brightness, and contrast for improved clarity using Adobe Photoshop. In proliferation assays, a fixed area of retina was captured and quantified for Sox2 and Edu colocalization. The region of the retina was selected and standardized between treatment and control groups to reduce variability and improve reproducibility.\nFor quantifying changes in context specific protein expression, densitometry measurements of fluorescent immunohistological stains were compared. Within each image, the retina was stratified into the photoreceptor layer (PRL), outer (photoreceptor) nuclear layer (ONL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), and the nerve fiber layer (NFL). Within each layer, a region of retina was selected and mean pixel intensity (0\u2013255) was derived. This process was repeated 3 times within each selected image, and the whole process was repeated for each biological replicate. ImagePro 6.2, ImageJ, and Microsoft Excel were used for data and calculations respectively.\nTo calculate changes in spatial distribution, the image was subjected to a consistent threshold value to remove background. The average area of distribution beginning at the IPL bordering the INL was derived and plotted for each pixel throughout the layer for each retina. The relative distance of each pixel was derived from the confocal scalebar corresponding to the magnification and image resolution. All data was calculated using ImageJ.\nFor statistical evaluation of differences in treatments, a two-tailed paired T-test was applied for intra-individual variability where each biological sample also served as its own control. For two treatment groups comparing inter-individual variability, a standard two-tailed unpaired T-test was applied. For multivariate analysis, an ANOVA with the associated Tukey Test was used to evaluate any significant differences between multiple groups."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nAll experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Loma Linda University. All studies were conducted in accordance with the United States Public Health Service\u2019s Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Sprague Dawley rat mothers with litters of 10-12 pups were purchased from Envigo (Livermore, CA). Ten-day old rat pups were used for this study. All animal tests were conducted blindly. All animal experiments comply with animal research: reporting in vivo experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines.\n\n2.2. Experimental Design\n2.2.1. Experiment 1\nTo determine the time course of FPR2 expression and endogenous RvD1 concentration after HI, 36 rat pups were randomly divided into six groups: sham, 6 h after HI, 12 h after HI, 24 h after HI, 48 h after HI, and 72 h after HI (n=6 per group). Western blot analysis was used to detect FPR2 expression and ELISA was used for RvD1 concentration.\n2.2.2. Experiment 2\nTo evaluate the effects of RvD1 on percent infarction area, short-term neurological behavior and to determine the best dose of RvD1, 30 rat pups were randomly divided into five groups (n=6 per group): sham, HI+vehicle, HI+RvD1 (1 \u03bcg/kg), HI+RvD1 (5 \u03bcg/kg), HI+RvD1 (15 \u03bcg/kg). Geotaxis reflex was performed to detect short-term neurological functions, and weight changes were also observed. TTC staining was conducted to detect the infarction area.\nTo assess the function of RvD1 on long-term neurological behavior after HI, 36 rat pups were randomly separated into three groups: sham, HI+vehicle, and HI+RvD1 (best dose) (n=12 per group). Foot fault test, rotarod test and morris water maze test were conducted at 4 weeks after HI.\n2.2.3. Experiment 3\nDouble immunofluorescent staining was conducted for localization of FPR2 with Iba1 (microglial marker) and GFAP (astrocytic marker). Moreover, to explore the effect of RvD1 on inflammation, cell morphology of glial cells were observed, and immunofluorescent density of Iba1, GFAP, MPO (indicator of inflammation) (\nFathali et al., 2013\n) and IL-1\u03b2 (representative inflammatory cytokines) were quantified (n=3 for each group).\n2.2.4. Experiment 4\nTo investigate the underlying mechanism of RvD1 mediated anti-inflammatory effects after HI, FPR2 siRNA and Rac1 activation CRISPR were administered by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection at 48 h before HI surgery separately, then followed by RvD1 treatment 1 h after HI. The following groups were included (n=6 for each group): sham, HI+vehicle, HI+RvD1, HI+RvD1+FPR2 siRNA, HI+RvD1+control siRNA, HI+RvD1+Rac1 CRISPR, HI+RvD1+control CRISPR.\n\n2.3. HI surgery\nRice-Vannucci neonatal HI model was induced as previously described (\nYe et al., 2018\n). After the pups were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane, the right common carotid artery (CCA) was gently isolated, double ligated and cut between the two ligation sites. Rats were allowed to recover 1 h on a heated blanket after which they were exposed to hypoxia (8% oxygen and 92% nitrogen) for 2 h and 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. After that rat pups were returned to their mothers. For the sham operated animals, CCA was isolated and exposed but without ligation and hypoxia.\n\n2.4. Drug administration\nRvD1 (Caymen, USA) as a selective agonist of FPR2, was dissolved in saline and tested with three different doses (1 \u03bcg/kg 5 \u03bcg/kg, 15 \u03bcg/kg), which were given intraperitoneally (i.p.) 1 h after HI. Saline was used as vehicle for RvD1.\n\n2.5. Intracerebroventricular injection\nFPR2 siRNA and scramble siRNA (Dharmacon, USA; 2 \u03bcl, 300pmol/\u03bcl) were administered (i.c.v.) to the ipsilateral hemisphere 48 h before HI. Briefly, The ICV injections were performed at 1.5mm posterior, 1.5mm lateral to the bregma and 2.5mm deep from the surface at a rate of 0.5 \u03bcl/min. After waiting for 5 min, the needle was removed over 5 min. The burr hole was then sealed with bone wax. 1 \u03bcg of Rac1 CRISPR activation plasmid (Santa Cruz, USA) or control CRISPR Activation Plasmid (Santa Cruz, USA) were given via ICV injection as described above at 48 h before HI.\n\n2.6. Infarct area measurements\nRats were deeply anesthetized and perfused transcardially with PBS at 72 h post HI. Brain samples were quickly removed, sectioned into 2 mm slices and immersed into 2% solution of 2,3,5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) (Sigma Aldrich, USA). Percent infarct area was measured by Image J software (NIH) and calculated as following: [(total area of contralateral hemisphere)-(un-infarcted area of ipsilateral hemisphere)] / (total area of contralateral hemisphere*2) (\nChen et al., 2018\n,\nFan et al., 2017\n).\n\n2.7. Short-term neurological test\nTo evaluate short-term neurological function, negative geotaxis test was performed blindly at 24 h post HI. Pups were placed on an inclined board (45\u00b0) with the rat pups facing downward. The time needed for the pups to adjust their bodies until head facing the upper of the board was recorded. The maximum time was 60 s.\n\n2.8. Long-term neurological tests\nLong-term neurological tests were conducted using foot-fault test, rotarod test and water maze test at 4 weeks post HI. Foot-fault test was used to evaluate motor abilities. Rats were placed on a horizontal grid floor for 1 min, which is 28\u00d73 cm with a mesh size of 4 cm\n2\n. Foot-fault was defined when one of rats\u2019 limbs could not be accurately put and fell through the openings in the grid. The whole process for each rat was recorded using a video device, and the number of foot-faults was counted respectively. Special motor impairment was assessed by rotarod test using an accelerating rotating (Columbus Instruments Rotamex, USA). The duration for a rat remaining on the rotarod treadmill was recorded and analyzed. Two rotarod trials accelerating from 5 or 10 rpm were performed separately. Morris water maze test was used to assess memory and learning (\nJiang et al., 2017\n). Cued tests were performed for five consecutive days. On the first day, rats were allowed to swim for maximum of 60s and if they could not discover the hidden platform within the 60s time period, they were manually guided to the platform. Days 2-5 tested the learning and memory abilities of the rats with a submerged platform. On the 6\nth\nday, hidden tests were conducted within 60s for each to compare the time spent in the target quadrant. During all experiments rats were tracked with Video Tracking SystemSMART-2000 (San Diego Instruments Inc., CA).\n\n2.9. Brain tissue loss evaluation (nissl staining) and Immunofluorescent staining\nRats were anesthetized and perfused with cold PBS followed by 4% formalin at 24 h post HI. The brains were taken out and post-fixed overnight, then immersed in 30% sucrose until dehydrated and frozen in OCT. Coronal sections were cut at 10 \u03bcm thickness using a cryostat (Leica LM3050S). For nissl staining the slides were dehydrated in 95% and 70% ethanol for 1 min respectively, stained with 0.5% cresyl violet (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 2 min, and then dehydrated in 100% ethanol and xylene for 1.5 min consecutively. The percentage of brain tissue loss was calculated with the same equation for infarct area.\nImmunofluorescent staining was performed as described previously (\nYe et al., 2018\n). Briefly, after being permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 and blocked by 5% donkey serum, sections were incubated with primary antibodies (FPR2, 1:100, Abcam, USA; Iba1, 1:100, Abcam, USA; GFAP, 1:100, Abcam, USA; IL-1\u03b2, 1:200, Abcam, USA; MPO, 1:200, Abcam, USA) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The next day sections were incubated with appropriate fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200) for 2 h at room temperature and mounted using Vectashield Antifade with DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc., USA). The stained sections were captured under a fluorescence microscope Leica DMi8 (Leica Microsystems, Germany) and analyzed with Image Pro Plus software (Olympus, Melville, NY).\n\n2.10. Tissue collection for ELISA and Western blotting\nAfter HI rats were euthanized deeply with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with cold PBS, brains were quickly removed, and then contralateral and ipsilateral cerebrums were frozen separately in liquid nitrogen. Samples were homogenized with lysis buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) and standing on ice for half an hour. The supernatant were collected after centrifugation and quantified with DC\u2122 Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, USA).\n\n2.11. ELISA for RvD1\nRvD1 ELISA kit was purchased from Cayman Chemicals (USA). Operations were conducted according to instructions, briefly incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C and developed by Ellman\u2019s reagent. The optical densities were measured with a plate reader (Bio-Rad) and concentrations of samples were calculated on the basis of standard curve.\n\n2.12. Western blotting\nWestern blotting was performed as previously described (\nGamdzyk et al., 2018\n). A total of 30 \u03bcg protein, from ipsilateral hemisphere, was loaded and separated by 8%-12% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 \u03bcm). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat blocking grade milk (Bio-Rad, USA), and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (anti-FPR2, 1:500, Abcam, USA; anti-NOX2, 1:500, Abcam, USA; anti-Rac1, 1:2000, Abcam, USA; IL-1\u03b2, 1:1000, Abcam, USA; TNF-\u03b1, 1:500, Abcam, USA; \u03b2-actin, 1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA). The next day, membranes were probed with anti-rabbit (or anti-mouse) secondary antibodies (1:3000 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the bands were developed with ECL Plus kit (Amersham Bioscience, Arlington Heights, IL, USA) and exposed onto an X-ray film. For quantification, gray values were measured and normalized with the control band by Image J software (National Institutes of Health, USA).\n\n2.13. Rac1 activity assay\nThe activation form of Rac1 (GTP-Rac1) was obtained by a pull-down assay using Rac1 activation Assay kit (Abcam, USA). According to the instructions, brain lysates were incubated with PAK1 PBD bead at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. The eluted proteins were then detected by performing Western blotting with anti-Rac1 antibody (Abcam, USA) as described above.\n\n2.14. Statistics\nAll animals were randomly assigned to different groups. All Data are expressed as the mean and standard deviation (mean \u00b1 SD). Statistical analysis was performed with the software of Graph Pad Prism 7. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by multiple comparisons between groups using Tukey\u2019s post hoc test was used. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nAll handling, housing, behavioral training, and surgical procedures were approved by the University of Texas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Seventy-four adult female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 293 \u00b1 41 grams (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) were used in this experiment. Female rats were use due to ease of handling, and because the behavioral measures used in this study have been extensively optimized in this sex (\nHays et al., 2013a\n;\nSeth A. Hays et al., 2014\n;\nHulsey et al., 2016\n;\nKhodaparast et al., 2014\n;\nMorrison et al., 2019\n;\nPorter et al., 2012\n). Rats were housed in a 12:12 hour reverse light cycle. Rats were food deprived Monday-Friday during behavioral training to increase motivation for food rewards, and provided access to full feed on weekends. Supplemental food was provided on weekdays as necessary to maintain a minimum of 85% original body weight.\n\nBehavioral Task\nRats were trained with MotoTrak (\nFig. 1\n, Vulintus Inc, Richardson, TX) systems on a quantitative, automated, skilled lever pressing task (\nHays et al., 2013a\n). The behavior chamber consisted of an acrylic cage with a slot for access to a lever positioned \u22121 to 2 cm from the inside edge of the chamber. The slot was positioned next to a divider in the cage, ensuring use of the right forelimb. Reward pellets (45 mg dustless precision pellet, BioServ, Frenchtown, NJ) were delivered to a receptacle on the other side of the divider, forcing rats to travel between areas within the cage to receive rewards thus causing rats to reset their position between trials. The lever was affixed to a potentiometer to record the angle of the lever. The lever had a neutral horizontal position when no force was applied. The lever mechanism allowed a 1.5 cm depression over 13\u00b0. A spring provided 28 grams of resistance and returned the lever to its neutral horizontal resting angle. An electronic controller board sampled the potentiometer position at 100 Hz and relayed the information to MotoTrak software that controlled the task criteria and collected data.\nFigure 1. Experimental design.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Timeline of experimental procedures. (B) Schematic of behavioral training cage. Rats could access the lever by reaching through a small slot in the cage. Rats were trained to press the lever twice in rapid succession to receive a food reward. (C) Representative data of a trial illustrating a successful double press with VNS and reward pellet delivery timing indicated. The gray shaded area indicates the time window for a double press.\nShaping of lever press behavior occurred across 5 stages (\nFig. S1\n). The first stage rewarded single lever presses with a sugar pellet. Subsequent stages changed lever position and reward criteria to increase the difficulty of the task. During the final stage rats received a reward after pressing the lever twice within a 500 ms interval. Behavior training was performed in two thirty minute sessions per day, five days a week, with at least two hours between daily training sessions. Proficiency at the task was defined as performing an average of 100 successful trials across 10 behavior sessions with a hit rate of at least 65% on the final stage.\n\nCortical Noradrenergic and Serotonergic Depletion\nImmunotoxins (Advanced Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA, SKU: IT-03 and IT-23) were used to deplete norepinephrine and serotonin in the motor cortex. Rats were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (80 mg/kg, i.p.) and xylazine (10mg/kg, i.p.), and given supplemental doses as necessary to maintain anesthesia throughout surgical procedures. The head was stabilized in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA), and burr holes were drilled over the left motor cortex (contralateral to the trained forelimb). DBH-Sap, SERT-Sap, CTRL-Sap (0.1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl), or saline were stereotactically injected with a neuros syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV) at two stereotaxic coordinates in the caudal forelimb area (from bregma: 3mm lateral, 0 and 2 mm anterior, 1.5 mm ventral to the pial surface; 0.25 \u03bcl volume per site, 0.1 \u03bcl/minute)(\nConner et al., 2010\n;\nMcGaughy et al., 2008\n;\nMilstein et al., 2007\n). The syringe remained in place for 4 minutes following each injection to allow for diffusion and to prevent backflow of the injection. Burr holes were sealed with Kwik-Cast (WPI, Sarasota, FL) silicone and acrylic.\nAt the end of the experiment noradrenergic innervation of motor cortex was imaged to confirm depletion with histological methods. Serotonergic depletion was not confirmed due to technical difficulties (see\ndiscussion\nsection). At the end of the experiment, animals were transcardially perfused with 0.01 M PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. After cryoprotection by immersion in 20% sucrose, the brains were sectioned with a cryostat through the extent of forelimb cortex (40\u03bcm sections, +4mm to \u22121mm from bregma). Every sixth section was stained for DBH positive fibers. Sections were placed in a PBS solution of 0.5% Triton X-100 (TX) and 2% normal horse serum (NHS). After 1 hour, sections were transferred into the primary antibody (mouse anti-DBH, 1:1000 dilution, EMD Millipore MAB308) in PBS with 0.5% TX and 2% NHS and incubated overnight in a humidified chamber. Following 3\u00d75 minute rinses in PBS sections were placed in biotinylated secondary antibody (biotinylated universal antibody - horse anti-mouse/rabbit, 1:50 dilution, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 30 minutes. Following 3\u00d75 minute PBS washes, tissue was placed in an avidin-biotin complex solution (Vectastain Elite ABC, Vector Laboratories) for 30 minutes. After 3\u00d75 minute washes, visualization was accomplished with a solution of 3,3-diaminobenzidine (ImmPACT DAB, Vector Laboratories). Sections were mounted on slides and air dried before coverslipping.\nSlides were imaged with an Olympus VS120 scanner at 2\u00d7 for overview, and at 20\u00d7 detail in regions of interest over motor cortex in left and right hemispheres. Images from three cortical sections (approximately 0, 1.2, and 2.4 mm from bregma) were overlaid with a 5\u00d75 grid with 50\u03bcm spacing and randomly coded for blinded analysis of fiber crossings to determine innervation.\n\nVagus Nerve Cuff Implantation\nA vagus nerve cuff and headcap connector were implanted following cortical injections using methods detailed in previous studies (\nHulsey et al., 2016\n;\nKhodaparast et al., 2014\n). While in the stereotaxic frame, four bone screws were placed into the parietal and supraoccipital bones. A two-channel connector was attached to the cranial screws with acrylic. Rats were transferred to a supine position, and an incision and blunt dissection of the neck muscles exposed the left vagus nerve. The vagus nerve was isolated and placed in a bipolar stimulating cuff electrode with platinum iridium leads (~5 k\u03a9 impedance). Cuff leads were tunneled subcutaneously, attached to the skull mounted connector, and encapsulated with acrylic. Neck and scalp incisions were sutured and treated with topical antibiotic ointment. Rats received an injection of buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg, s.c) and provided carprofen and enroflaxcin tablets (1mg each) for 3 days following surgery to provide analgesia and prevent infection. Rats recovered for one week before returning to behavioral training.\n\nVagus nerve stimulation procedure\nUpon returning to behavioral training, rats were habituated to the stimulator connection cables while performing the lever press task. VNS pairing began once rats consistently performed 200 successful trials per day while connected to the inactive stimulator. During VNS pairing, an isolated pulse stimulator (A-M Systems, Sequim, WA, Model 2100) was triggered by the MotoTrak software immediately after successful trials. VNS consisted of a 500 ms train of 100 \u03bcs biphasic pulses at 30 Hz at 0.8 mA. The stimulation parameters are identical to previous studies (\nEngineer et al., 2011\n;\nHulsey et al., 2016\n;\nKhodaparast et al., 2014\n). Rats received VNS paired with behavior training for 5 days before ICMS. Sham stimulation rats underwent the same habituation and training protocol but did not receive stimulation.\n\nIntracortical Microstimulation\nWithin 24 hours of the final training session, rats underwent intracortical microstimulation to derive functional representation maps using standard procedures (\nGanzer et al., 2018\n;\nHulsey et al., 2016\n;\nMorrison et al., 2019\n;\nPorter et al., 2012\n). Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injections of ketamine hydrochloride (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) and received supplemental doses of ketamine (25 mg/kg) and xylazine (1.5 mg/kg) as necessary throughout the procedure in order to maintain a consistent level of anesthesia as indicated by breathing rate, vibrissae whisking, and foot reflex. To prevent cortical swelling, a small incision was made in the cisterna magna. A craniotomy and duratomy exposed the left motor cortex, contralateral to the trained forelimb. A tungsten electrode (459 \u00b1 41 k\u03a9, FHC Inc., Bowdin, MD, Cat#: UEWMEGSEBN3M) was inserted to a depth of 1.8 mm following a 0.5 mm grid, with subsequent penetrations at least 1 mm apart when possible. Stimulation consisted of a 40 ms train of twelve 200 \u03bcs monophasic cathodal pulses delivered at 300 Hz. Stimulation intensity was gradually increased from 20 to 200 \u03bcA until a movement was observed. If no movement was observed at maximal intensity, the site was deemed nonresponsive. Borders of the motor cortex were defined based on nonresponsive sites and vibrissae responses in the posterior-lateral edge of the map.\nMotor mapping procedures were conducted with two experimenters. The first experimenter placed the electrode and recorded data for each site. The second experimenter, who was blind to the experimental group and electrode position, delivered stimulation, and observed and classified motor movements. Observed movements were classified as \u201cproximal forelimb\u201d (shoulder and elbow), \u201cdistal forelimb\u201d (wrist and digits), \u201chindlimb\u201d (hindlimb, trunk, and tail), and \u201chead\u201d (neck, vibrissa, jaw, nose, and eye). Cortical area was calculated by multiplying the number of sites eliciting a response by the area surrounding the site (0.25 mm\n2\n). Complete borders were determined when possible, but some maps do not have medial or posterior borders due to proximity to the median sinus or headcap placement. The contiguous forelimb region was always mapped completely. Raw ICMS maps from all subjects can be found in the\nsupplemental material\n(\nFig. S2\n\u2013\n5\n).\n\nStatistics\nAll data are reported in the main text as mean \u00b1 SEM except as noted. All comparisons were planned in the experimental design\na priori\nand preregistered (\nhttps://osf.io/xf3yj/\n). Significant differences were determined using ANOVA and t-tests where appropriate using the MATLAB 2018a statistics toolbox (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Statistical tests for each comparison are noted in the text.\n\nExclusions and criteria\nTwenty-seven rats out of seventy-four were excluded from analysis based on pre-determined criteria listed in the study registration. Six rats failed to acquire the lever pressing task. Seven rats died due to surgical complications. Two rats were excluded due to mechanical failure of the head mounted connector. Nine rats were excluded due to high or inconsistent stimulation voltages (>20V peak to peak intensity), consistent with electrical failure of the stimulating cuff. To confirm effective stimulation of the vagus nerve, we measured rapid stimulation-dependent reduction in oxygen saturation at the conclusion of ICMS. This well described biomarker of VNS in rats is mediated by vagal A-fibers and is ascribed to activation of the Hering-Breuer reflex (\nChang et al., 2015\n;\nMcAllen et al., 2018\n). Three rats were excluded after ICMS because VNS did not reliably elicit this characteristic drop in oxygen saturation."

    "Methods": "Post-hoc gene expression comparison\nHuman microarray gene expression data (\nHur et al., 2011\n) were assessed in diabetic patients who either progressed in their neuropathy (progressors) or did not progress in neuropathy (non-progressors) as measured by changes in sural nerve myelin fiber density over a period of 52 wks. Sural nerve differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained from two studies using different analysis platforms: ChipInspector (Genomatix Software GmbH) allowing single probe-level analysis (\nMcGregor et al., 2018\n), and GenePattern using the standard robust multi-array average-based probe set approach combined with ChipInspector (\nHur et al., 2011\n). DEG datasets from murine models were obtained from multiple published datasets by comparing diabetic to healthy control mice or by comparing diabetic mice across different time points. The murine datasets included sciatic nerve gene expression data from: 1) 8 and 24 wk old\ndb/db\ntype 2 diabetic mice compared over time or compared to\ndb/\n+ non-diabetic controls (\nHinder et al., 2018\n;\nPande et al., 2011\n), 2) 26 wk old DBA/2J low dose streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic mice compared to DBA/2J non-diabetic mice not given STZ (\nWiggin et al., 2008\n), 3) 16 wk old\ndb/db\nmice treated with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist, pioglitazone, compared to untreated\ndb/db\nmice or to\ndb/\n+ non-diabetic controls (\nHur et al., 2015\n), 4) 5 and 13 wk old male BTBR\nob/ob\ntype 2 diabetic mice compared over time or compared to\nob/\n+ non-diabetic control mice (\nO\u2019Brien et al., 2015\n), 5) 26 wk old female BTBR\nob/ob\ntype 2 diabetic mice compared to\nob/\n+ non-diabetic controls (\nO\u2019Brien et al., 2016\n), and 6) a second cohort of 16 wk\ndb/db\nmice treated with pioglitazone compared to untreated\ndb/db\nmice or to\ndb/\n+ non-diabetic controls (\nHinder et al., 2017b\n). DEGs from these human and murine datasets were compiled and cross-referenced against the genes in the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) TLR signaling pathways (\nhttps://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map04620\n).\n\nMurine studies and metabolic phenotyping\nTen C57BL/6J mice and 5 TLR2/4\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice of the same strain were obtained. Of the non-genetically modified animals, 5 were utilized as controls (CON; 3 males and 2 females) and received standard chow, whereas the remaining 5 were placed on a HFD (HFD-WT; 2 males and 3 females). TLR2/4\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice were switched to a 60% HFD at 5 wks of age (HFD-TLR2/4\n\u2212/\u2212\n; 2 males and 3 females). Metabolic and neuropathic phenotyping was performed at an early time point (16 wks of age) and at a later time point (28 wks of age), with additional immunophenotyping completed at 28 wks. Body weights and fasting (4 hr) blood glucose measured using an AlphaTrak Glucometer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) were recorded weekly.\n\nNeuropathy phenotyping\nAnimals were phenotyped for neuropathy at 16 and 28 wks of age using the Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium guidelines (\nBiessels et al., 2014\n). Specifically, we measured sural sensory (sural NCV) and sciatic motor (SMNCV) nerve conduction velocities (NCVs), hind paw withdrawal latencies (HPLs), and intraepidermal nerve fiber densities (IENFDs). NCV was measured per our previous publications (\nOh et al., 2010\n;\nStevens et al., 1994\n). In brief, we measured sural NCV by applying an antidromic stimulus at the ankle and recording at the dorsum of the foot. Onset latency of the action potential and distance were measured and the NCV calculated. For SMNCV, orthodromic stimulation was applied at the ankle, followed by the sciatic notch, and recorded at the dorsum of the foot for each stimulus. The onset latency of the action potential and distance for each component was measured. The ankle latency was subtracted from the notch latency, and ankle distance was subtracted from the notch distance. The resultant latency and distance were used to measure conduction velocity. NCVs are presented as meters per second (m/s).\nHPLs were measured as previously described (\nLee et al., 1990\n;\nSullivan et al., 2007\n). In brief, mice were confined to an acrylic box on top of a 32\u00b0C heated glass plate. A red-light emitter (60-170\u00b0C) was used under the hind paw and incrementally increased from 25\u00b0 - 70\u00b0C. The time it took for the hind paw to withdraw from the heat stimulus was used to determine HPL. HPLs are presented as seconds (s) (\nLee et al., 1990\n).\nIENFDs were assessed at the terminal time point using previously published protocols (\nCheng et al., 2012\n;\nSullivan et al., 2007\n). In brief, hind paw footpads were fixed 4-6 hr in Zamboni\u2019s fixative (Newcomer Supply, Middleton, WI, USA), then sectioned at 30 \u03bcm. Floating sections were stained with protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5; cat. no. 14730-1-AP, Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, USA) and labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (cat. no. A-11034, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Sections were counterstained and mounted to slides using prolong gold with dapi (cat. no.\nP36931\n, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). For each mouse, we captured 4 z-series images and the total distance counted was at least 3 mm. Images were taken with a confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview 500, 20\u00d7 air objective, 1024\u00d71024 pixel resolution; Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan). Z-series were converted to max project images and the number of nerve fibers innervating the epidermis were counted using MetaMorph software (v.7.7.0.8, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).\n\nImmunologic phenotyping\nAt the terminal endpoint of the study (28 wks) circulating immune cells were isolated from peripheral blood and immunophenotyped using flow cytometry (\nMurdock et al., 2012\n). In brief, lymphoid and myeloid leukocytes were characterized using a battery of fluorescently labeled antibodies specific for well-characterized leukocyte surface markers. Forward scatter width and height were first used to exclude doublets, and APC-CD45was then used to identify leukocytes. Lymphoid cells were identified by excluding side scatter (SSC)-high cells and identifying lymphocytes (APC-Cy7-CD4+ or BV421-CD8+ cells) within the FITC-CD3+ fraction. Natural killer (NK) cells (PE-NK1.1+) and B cells (PerCp-5.5-CD19+) were identified within the CD3\u2212 fraction. In the myeloid stain, CD45+ leukocytes were first separated by SSC expression; neutrophils were identified as SSC-high PE-Cy7-Ly6G+ cells. Within the SSC-low fraction, monocyte populations were APC-Cy7-CD11b+, and these populations were classified as either Ly6C\u2212 or Ly6C+ based on their expression of FITC-Ly6C. Within the two monocyte populations, F4/80 expression levels were assessed using the median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of PE-F4/80. All antibodies were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA), samples were run using a FACSAria II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (FlowJo, Ashland, OR, USA).\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor analysis of neuropathy across multiple time points, statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS institute, Carry, NC, USA) with the PROC mixed function. Group and gender and their interaction were set as main effects and were tested against each variable. Normality was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; non-normal data were log transformed to achieve normality. For peripheral blood immune levels, statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) using oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was defined as\nP\n< 0.05 and trends considered at\nP\n< 0.10."

Informed consent to study the sequence data on a research basis was obtained according to Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) institutional review board protocol # 2014-3789. Following consent, residual DNA samples were obtained for Sanger sequencing confirmation of exome sequencing analysis.\n\nSanger Sequencing\nSanger sequencing to confirm the results of whole exome sequencing was performed by PCR amplification of exon 5 of\nNMNAT2\nwith F primer 5\u2019- gaggttcaggagcgatgaaa-3\u2019 and R primer 5\u2019- caggagaagagtgcacacca-3\u2019 using genomic DNA.

Conservation and protein prediction scores for\nNMNAT2\nR232Q variant were generated by SIFT, Polyphen, and MutationTaster algorithms. Schematic of NMNAT2 protein domains were generated from existing literature and functional domains annotated by UniProt by homology. The crystal structure of NMNAT1 (PDB ID: 1kku) in stereo ribbon view was generated by PyMOL (v2.2.3)\n31\n.\n\nHistology\nHistology was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded patient tissue collected at the time of autopsy. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed according to standard methods at the CCHMC Pathology Core Lab and analyzed by attending pathology physicians.\n\nConstructs\nThe R232Q and Q135Pfs*44\nNMNAT2\nmutations were introduced separately by QuikChangeII site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) into the complete open reading frame of the canonical 307 amino acid human NMNAT2 isoform cloned into expression vector pCMV-Tag2 (Stratagene). The expressed NMNAT2 proteins have a Flag tag and short linker sequence (17 amino acids) at their N-terminus. The presence of the mutations and absence of other PCR errors was confirmed by sequencing (Cogenics). pDsRed2-N1 (Clontech) was used for expression of variant\nDiscosoma\nred fluorescent protein (DsRed) to label micro-injected neurons / neurites. pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) was used for expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) to act as a transfection control and reference for NMNAT2 turnover in HEK 293T cells.\nHEK 293T transfection and stability assays.\nHEK 293T cells were cultured in DMEM with 4,500 mg/L glucose and 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate (PAA), supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (both Invitrogen), and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated in 24-well format to reach 50-60% confluence for transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In standard turnover experiments (\nFig. 4A\n) 500 ng Flag-NMNAT2 expression construct (wild-type or mutant), 200 ng of an empty pCMV-Tag series vector, and 100 ng pEGFP were transfected per well. To boost expression of the NMNAT2\nQ135Pfs*44\nmutant 700 ng Flag-NMNAT2 expression construct and 100 ng pEGFP-C1 were transfected per well (\nFig. 4C\n). After treatment \u00b110 \u03bcM emetine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich), cells from single wells were lysed directly in 100 \u03bcl 2\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer and heated to 100\u00b0C for 5 mins. Equal amounts of extract (either 10 or 15 \u03bcl) were resolved on 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and probed with antibodies essentially as described previously\n20\n. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (1:2,000 Sigma-Aldrich F3165), mouse monoclonal anti-GFP clones 7.1 and 13.1 (1:2,000, Sigma-Aldrich 11814460001) and rabbit polyclonal \u03b1-Tubulin (1:7,500, Thermo Fisher Scientific PA5-29444). Appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for band detection with SuperSignal\u2122 West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an Alliance chemiluminescence imaging system (UVITEC Cambridge). Relative band intensities on captured digital images were determined (area under histogram peaks) using Fiji software (\nhttp://fiji.sc\n)\n32\n.\nFigure 4.

Emetine was added 24 h after transfection. Extract from non-transfected cells is also shown (NT). Blots were probed with Flag, eGFP and \u03b1-Tubulin antibodies. To avoid saturation of the protein degradation machinery that might artificially slow rates of turnover, expression of the Flag-NMNAT2 proteins was kept relatively low by including empty vector as part of the transfection mix (see\nMaterials and Methods\n). Co-transfected eGFP or endogenous \u03b1-Tubulin (present in transfected and non-transfected cells) are both relatively stable proteins and were respectively used as a reference for Flag-NMNAT2 protein turnover (to control for transfection efficiency) and for loading. Arrows indicate the positions of bands corresponding to Flag-NMNAT2\nWT\n(black, ~34 kDa), Flag-NMNAT2\nR232Q\n(red, ~37 kDa), and Flag-NMNAT2\nQ135Pfs*44\n(green, ~22 kDa).

Expression vectors and the concentrations used in each specific injection experiment are described in the\nFigure 3\nlegend. Fluorescence images were acquired with a Leica DFC365FX fluorescence monochrome camera attached to a Leica DMi8 inverted fluorescence microscope (10x objective). Mean intensities of Flag immunostaining and DsRed fluorescence signals in injected SCG neurons were determined using Fiji software (\nhttp://fiji.sc\n) by thresholding (20, dark background) followed by particle analysis (size >250 pixels for 1392\u00d71040 images) to identify neurons with signal intensity above background (the threshold value was subtracted from the mean intensity values obtained)\n32\n.\nFigure 3.

The purified proteins were desalted on PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare) in 50 mM HEPES/NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), 20 % glycerol, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Their amount was measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Their purity was evaluated on SDS polyacrylamide gels either after Coomassie staining or immunoblotting. Proteins were transferred from gels to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and probed with antibodies as described\n20\n. Monoclonal anti-NMNAT2 (1:1,000 Abcam AB5698) or anti-tetra His (0.1 \u03bcg/ml Qiagen 34670) were used as primary antibodies, followed by appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. SuperSignal\u2122 West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for detection on an Alliance chemiluminescence imaging system (UVITEC Cambridge).\nFigure 5.

NMNAT2\nWT\nwas assayed at 25 mM MgCl\n2\nand 1 mM of both ATP and NMN (\nFig. 5C\n). The mutant R232Q was assayed at 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 5 mM Mg-ATP, and 1 mM NMN (\nFig. 5D\n). For Mg\n2+\n-dependence studies the MgCl\n2\nwas increased up to 100 mM. Temperature studies were carried out under various treatments as indicated (\nFig. 5E\n-\nG\n) using apo-enzyme solutions in buffer. With assays at 52 \u00b0C, the reaction mixture at the end of incubation was cooled down to 37 \u00b0C and then enzyme was re-added to check for activity recovery, thus ruling out heat inactivation of the ancillary enzyme ADH. The\nK\nm\nand\nK\ncat\nvalues were calculated at 37 \u00b0C as described using 0.5-5 mM Mg-ATP and 0.05-1 mM NMN for the mutant R232Q, or 0.05-0.6 mM ATP and 0.01-0.15 mM NMN for the wild type\n36\n. Due to the known instability of NMNAT2 preparations after thawing, enzyme was always added as the last component to start the reaction, and control assays were performed in parallel\n34\n.

At 48 hrs after transfection, protein synthesis was inhibited by adding 1 \u03bcg/ml cycloheximide. Cells were subjected to heat shock at 42 \u00b0C for 45 mins, and then recovered at 37 \u00b0C for 3 hours\n37\n. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 100 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1mM dithiothreitol. Luciferase activity was measured with the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).\nStatistics.\nStatistical testing of data was performed using Excel (Microsoft) or Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, USA).

    "Methods": "Overview\nThis study was conducted in two phases. In Phase 1, all of the methods required were validated between the Martin Laboratory, where the stimulation paradigm was developed, and the Carmel Laboratory, where the replication study was conducted. The surgical, physiological, and behavioral methods were compared between the laboratories, and consistency between experimenters determined. After the methods were found to be consistent between the laboratories, Phase 2, the independent replication, was performed. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of combined iTBS over motor cortex and tsDCS over the cervical spinal cord in rats after spinal cord injury. The study was powered to detect differences in forelimb motor function between the experimental and sham stimulation groups. All procedures were approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee of Weill Cornell Medicine.\n\nMethods common to Phase 1 and Phase 2\nBehavior\nFood Manipulation Task (IBB)\nWe followed the methods of the Irvine, Beatties and Bresnahan task (\nIrvine et al. 2010\n;\nIrvine et al. 2014\n). We assessed the rat\u2019s ability to manipulate differently shaped breakfast cereals: sphere-shaped (Reese\u2019s Puffs, General Mills Sales Inc.) and donut-shaped (Froot Loops, Kellogg\u2019s NA Co.). Briefly, the rats were acclimated to the testing environment for 15 minutes daily, for 10 days after cortical electrode implantation. Experimenters blinded to the paired stimulation treatment recorded the rats eating the cereals before injury and weekly from week 4 to week 7 after injury.\nHorizontal ladder rung walking task\nThe horizontal ladder-walking task measured paw placement on the rungs, which were irregularly spaced (\nCarmel et al., 2010\n;\nCarmel et al., 2014\n;\nMetz & Whishaw, 2009\n). After cortical electrode implantation, we trained rats 20 minutes daily for 10 days to ensure rats walked across the ladder without distractions. We motivated rats to cross the ladder with puffs from a can of compressed air and by offering a cotton swab dipped into 20% sucrose after every successful trial. The pattern of the irregularly spaced rungs was altered every 6 trials and the walking direction was changed after 12 trials. We video recorded the behavior at 50 frames-per-second.\nExperimenters blinded to the paired stimulation treatment analyzed the trials frame-by-frame to quantify the step quality. The start was defined when the rat placed all 4 limbs on the rungs and the end when it reached the last rung of the ladder. The criteria were used to establish when to begin and end scoring and also to measure the time taken to walk across the ladder. The steps were scored as a good step, overstep, understep, or a missed step based on the placement of the forepaw on the rung; for the main analysis, this was divided only into good steps or errors. We excluded one rat that did not meet the baseline average of 15% error rate.\nC4 spinal cord contusion\nAll the surgeries (cortical implantation, spinal cord contusion, and BDA tracer injection) were performed using aseptic techniques. Rats were anesthetized with ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10mg/kg) mixture. The anesthesia state was maintained with ketamine (1/3 of the initial dosage). Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, Henry Schein, Melville, NY) was administered before and after surgery to alleviate pain. Anesthesia levels and the heart rate were continuously monitored throughout the surgeries. Rats were kept on heating pads to maintain the temperature at 37.5\u00b0C during surgery and for 24 hours post surgery.\nThe spinal cord contusion surgery was performed with the same method as the original study. Briefly, the C3 to C5 vertebrae were exposed by skin incision and muscle separation on the midline. Laminectomy of C4 was performed, taking care to ensure the dura remained intact. Following laminectomy, the rat was placed on the Infinite Horizon (IH) impactor stabilization platform, and the C3 and C5 spinous processes were clamped. Fine adjustment was made to the vertebral clamps to ensure that the exposed C4 spinal cord surface was level. The moderate contusion injury was made with a 3.5mm impactor tip raised to three complete turns ~2mm from the dura surface and was dropped with a preset 200 kdynes force on to the spinal cord with no dwell time. After injury, the rat was removed from the platform, and the wound was closed in layers. Topical antibiotic ointment was applied to the wound.\nRats received intense care after surgery. This included placing their cage on a heating pad for 12 hours, administering buprenorphine (4 dosages in total, 0.05mg/kg) every 4-12 hours, and Baytril (5mg/kg, Norbrook, Henry Schein, Melville, NY) daily for 5 days. For nutrition, Ringers Lactate solution (10ml, subcutaneous) was administered daily for 5-10 days, and Dietboost Gel (ClearH\n2\nO, Portland, ME) was placed within reach until rats regained the ability to reach the food and water dispensers. Weight was monitored daily. Bladder function was monitored closely; none of the rats showed bladder dysfunction.\nPaired brain and spinal cord stimulation\niTBS was delivered through implanted cortical electrodes. All rats received bilateral electrode implantation once they were habituated to the testing environment, animal facility and experimenter handlers. Each electrode consisted of two stainless steel screws (1.19mm in diameter, PlasticOne). Insulated stainless steel wires connected the screws to a plastic connector. Under anesthesia, the rat was fixed on a stereotaxic frame and the skull was exposed. A hand-drill was used to make 4 holes over the forelimb areas of the motor cortex in both the hemispheres. The coordinates of the screws in both the left and right hemisphere relative to the bregma were 1mm rostral, 2mm lateral and 3mm rostral, 4mm lateral to bregma. The screw electrodes were placed so that the flat end rested upon the dura. The electrodes were tested during the surgery for all rats; this produced specific contralateral forelimb movement in all cases. An additional 4-6 screws (1.57mm in diameter, PlasticOne) were used to secure the head cap.\nThe paired stimulation parameters were the same as the original study. Before, during, and 10 days after iTBS+tsDCS treatment, the motor threshold (the minimal electrical intensity needed to elicit specific contralateral forelimb movement) was tested and confirmed for each rat on the stimulation group. Each rat in the stimulation group received iTBS epidurally through the screw electrodes. The iTBS delivered 5 epochs of stimulation (1630s total). Each epoch was 360s long, containing 20 repeats of stimulation (in total 200s stimulation, 160s interstimulus period). Each repeat was 10s long in total, consisted of 2s stimulation and 8s interstimulus period. Each 2s stimulation included 10 bursts of stimulation. Each burst was composed of 3 pulses (200\u03bcs, biphasic, interstimulus interval: 50ms). The intensity was set at 75% of the motor threshold. tsDCS was delivered using the same method as in the original study and described above. For paired stimulation treatment, tsDCS was delivered simultaneously with iTBS for 27 minutes.\n\nMethods specific to Phase 1\nWe broke down the original study protocol into the individual procedures, which were adopted in the Carmel lab with the instruction of a member of the Martin lab. Typically, a procedure was first observed in the Martin lab and then performed in the Carmel lab under observation. Procedures were deemed sufficiently similar if they produced similar results (e.g. physiological effects of stimulation), or were submitted to formal assessment of interrater reliability (behavioral tasks). Inter-laboratory reliability was tested on: 1) skilled (ladder) walking and food manipulation (IBB), 2) acute physiology effects of iTBS/tsDCS , and 3) cervical spinal cord contusion injury model. In Phase 1, a total of 18 female Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) were used. We chose to focus our efforts on reliability on the behavioral tasks since they were both the main outcome measure and the most subjective. The validation process took approximately six months.\nTo ensure consistency in the way behavior performance was evaluated, video files taken and scored by the Martin lab were re-scored by members of the Carmel lab. Once the scoring system was consistent, the process was reversed: videos taken and scored the Carmel lab were re-scored by members of the Martin lab. We identified 2 important differences in the scoring systems in the two labs. For the ladder task, the paw position was initially assessed at different phases of the step cycle. For the IBB task, the scoring of manipulations without volar support (no palm involved) was inconsistent between the two labs. For the ladder, we assessed the step when the rat had only one forelimb on the rung, suggesting weight bearing. For the IBB, non-volar support received a score of 4 or less. Replication study personnel rescored previous videos recorded at different timepoints periodically to ensure that the scoring paradigm remains consistent throughout the duration of the study.\nWe tested whether the physiological effects of iTBS observed in the Martin laboratory (\nSong et al. 2016\n) was also observed in the Carmel lab. To test the effects of iTBS, we measured biceps EMG before, during, and after one epoch of iTBS. A pair of EMG electrodes was inserted into the biceps muscle as described in previous studies (\nMishra et al. 2017\n;\nSong et al. 2016\n). Biceps EMG was elicited one of two ways: 1) before and after iTBS, a pair of biphasic, square wave pulses (0.1 ms each polarity; interstimulus interval 3ms) over motor cortex were used to elicit biceps EMG responses; 2) during the period of iTBS EMG responses were elicited by the bursts.\nThe original study used \u201cL\u201d-shaped wire electrodes to stimulate motor cortex, that were held in place with the dental cement of a head cap (\nCarmel et al. 2010\n,\n2013\n;\nCarmel, Kimura, and Martin 2014\n). We changed this by using screw electrodes in the replication study, which could be placed more quickly and with a lower likelihood of injuring the underlying dura matter (\nGarcia-Sandoval et al. 2018\n;\nMishra et al. 2017\n). We sought to determine if cortical stimulation using screw electrodes would have similar physiological effects to those elicited by L-shaped electrodes. We had previously observed no difference in the effects of stimulation with changes in the shape of the stimulating electrodes (\nCarmel, 2010\n).\nSpinal stimulation was delivered through skin electrodes (LGMedSupply; 0.5\u201d x 1.5\u201d) as in the original study. The anode was placed over the chest, while the cathode above C4-T2 vertebrae. The placement of the electrodes was confirmed with the original study laboratory (\nZareen et al. 2017\n). The cathode was placed on the chest and the anode above the neck; this maximizes current delivered to the cervical enlargement (\nSong et al. 2015\n;\nSong et al. 2016\n). tsDCS was stepped up from 0 to 1.5mA over 2.5s, kept constant at 1.5mA throughout the testing period and stepped down to 0 in 2.5s at the end.\nWe measured biceps muscle electromyography (EMG) response to iTBS and tsDCS separately. EMG was acquired with a differential AC amplifier (AM Systems, Model 1700), amplified at a gain of 1000 and bandpass filtered between 1 and 1000Hz. EMG signal was recorded at 5000 Hz through Signal 5.08 (CED Ltd, CED Micro 1401, Cambridge Electronic Design Ltd, Cambridge, UK). Raw EMG signals were rectified to quantify peak to peak EMG, and area under the curve was analyzed using custom scripts in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).\n\nMethods specific to Phase 2\nGeneral Procedures\nThe timeline of the phase 2 experiment is shown in\nFigure 1\n. After one week of handling, all rats received cortical electrodes implantation. Rats recovered for one week and then were trained on the skilled walking task; a criterion of <15% errors within 2 weeks was set before the study began. After pre-injury assessment of skilled walking and food manipulation tasks, all rats received C4 midline moderate contusion injury. Then they were randomized into control and stimulation groups. Stimulation group rats received paired stimulation every day for 10 days beginning 11 days after contusion. Behavior (skilled walking and IBB) was assessed weekly from weeks 4 to 7 post injury. 27 female Sprague Dawley rats were used for this study. The replication study was performed in cohorts, with each cohort of 4-6 rats. Rat retention during Phase 2 is indicated in\nFigure 1\non top of the timeline.\nFigure 1. Timeline.\nOpen in a new tab\nNumbers above the line indicate the animals remaining in the study after the procedure indicated below it.\nRandomization and blinding procedures\nRats were pseudorandomized with an attempt to balance each cohort into stimulation and control groups. Rats were randomized immediately after SCI surgery and without regard to baseline behavior performance. The replication phase was carried out with blinded measure. An experimenter (QY) randomized rats into different groups and performed paired stimulation treatment, but was not involved in behavior tasks training, testing or scoring process or in histology including, lesion reconstruction and histochemistry analyses. Experimenters (AR and SL) who performed behavior training, testing and scoring and histology, but they did not participate in randomization, electrophysiology testing, or paired stimulation. Control rats were wire-connected through the implanted cortical electrodes and skin electrodes similarly to the stimulation group, but no stimulation was delivered. Since all rats had cortical electrodes implanted, there was no way to distinguish by appearance whether rats received stimulation.\nAnatomical methods and analyses\nBDA tracer injection surgery and perfusion were performed identically to the original study. Briefly, the dental acrylic head cap was removed with an electric drill, and the electrode screws were extracted with a screwdriver. After the electrodes were taken out, a 3\u00d73mm craniotomy was made above the right side forelimb area motor cortex in order to inject the tracer. 10% biotinylated dextran amine (BDA; 10,000 mw, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) was injected at depth of 1.5mm at the following 7 sites, 300nl each site (mm rostral to bregma, mm lateral to bregma): (0.5, 2), (0.5, 2.8), (0.5, 3.9), (1.5, 3.5), (1.5, 2.5), (2.02, 2.5), (2.02, 3.5). After the injections were complete, a thin layer of GelFoam (Pfizer, NY) was placed over the dura, and the wound was closed. Two weeks later, rats were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with ~400ml 0.1M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 10,000IU/L of heparin and 600ml 4% paraformaldehyde. Brain and spinal cord (C1-T2) were dissected and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 hours. The tissue was then transferred to 30% sucrose at \u22124\u00b0C until it was cut in the coronal section at 40\u03bcm thickness on a cryostat.\nTissue sections from C3 to C5 were processed for lesion reconstruction. Spinal cord sections were collected serially and mounted directly onto slides to preserve tissue integrity. The lesioned tissue was dried overnight and coverslipped the next day. The outline of the lesion, grey matter and white matter were traced using light microscopy and Neurolucida software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, Vermont, USA). The lesion was reconstructed by a blinded experimenter using the 3D visualization tool. The Cavalieri Estimator probe in Stereoinvestigator (MBF Bioscience, Williston, Vermont, USA) was used to determine lesioned and total tissue area for sections rostral, caudal, and at the epicenter of the lesion. Spared tissue area was computed by subtracting lesioned tissue area from total tissue area. To compare the extent of injury in the two groups, spared tissue area data was quantified every 3 slices for the whole injury length. The data was then averaged and converted to spared tissue area percentage (average spared tissue area/average total tissue area X 100%).\nFor axon quantification, BDA histology was performed on sections above (C3) and below (C7) the lesion site as described previously (\nWen et al. 2018\n). Briefly, sections from spinal cord levels C3 and C7 were incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide solution, rinsed with 0.05 M Tris-HCL buffer, then incubated into 0.05 M Tris-HCL buffer containing 1% avidin-biotin complex reagent (ABC kit, catalogue # PK6100; Vector Laboratories) and 0.2% Triton-X 100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 90 minutes, followed by diaminobenzidine and nickel (Peroxidase substrate kit DAB, catalogue # SK4100; Vector Laboratories) solution after rinsing. After mounting and dehydrating with increasing concentrations of ethanol solution and incubation into xylene (Sigma-Aldrich), sections were coverslipped.\nAt spinal cord level C3, the spaceballs probe in Stereoinvestigator was used to estimate axon length in the grey matter contralateral to the BDA injection site (\nZareen et al. 2017\n). For the side of the spinal cord ipsilateral to BDA injection (sparse CST projections) and for both sides of the spinal cord at C7, the axons were hand traced using Neurolucida (MBF Bioscience, Williston, Vermont, USA). For each rat, data were collected from two sections at C3 and two sections at C7, and then axon length was averaged for each of the two spinal cord levels. To correct for differences in the efficacy of the tracer, axon length was normalized by the efficiency of tract tracing, as in the original study and our previous publications (\nCarmel et al. 2010\n;\nCarmel and Martin 2014\n;\nCarmel et al. 2013\n). The Optical Fractionator probe in Stereoinvestigator was used to determine an estimate of the number of labelled axons in the contralateral dorsal column at C3. A correction factor was calculated by dividing each rat\u2019s averaged dorsal column axon number by the average number of axons in the dorsal column. Two rats were excluded from the BDA quantification analysis because of too little BDA staining to be quantified.\nStatistical analysis\nThe primary endpoint of the study was behavior performance at week 7 after injury, the end of the study. An independent t-test was computed for the horizontal ladder task and food manipulation (IBB) task at week 7 post-injury. All data were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. For non-normally distributed data non-parametric tests were used. For all tests, two-tailed significance was reported, and the p value threshold set at 0.05. Since two behavioral tests were used as the primary endpoint, a Bonferroni correction was performed, and the significance was set at p=0.025. A power analysis performed before the study found that 10 rats in each group were sufficient to meet the primary endpoints with a power of 0.8 (G*Power). Cohen\u2019s d was calculated to measure effect size (\nCohen 1988\n). We defined the effect size is large if the d value is greater than 0.8 (\nSawilowsky 2009\n).\nAll other analyses were considered secondary. For behavior, a secondary analysis was performed on time to cross the ladder and error rate using multivariate ANOVA. For physiology, a Welch ANOVA was used to test whether motor thresholds changed before and after SCI. For spinal cord lesions, comparison of the spared tissue area between groups was tested using an independent t-test. Analyses for the length of axons rostral and caudal to injury were computed using the Mann-Whitney U test, a non-parametric equivalent of the independent t-test. To calculate the spatial distribution of axon densities in a group of spinal cord sections, the sections were transformed into a common coordinate system. This was achieved by performing image registration of each section to a corresponding traced rat spinal cord atlas image (\nWen et al. 2018\n).\nAxon density spatial distributions were averaged after registration to obtain representative heatmaps for each group. To test if there were statistical differences between groups, we used permutation testing (\nWen et al. 2018\n). The chosen statistic was the Euclidean distance between the means of the two groups. This statistic was evaluated for 1000 permutations with a significance threshold set at 95%. All data are expressed as Mean+/\u2212 SEM."

All mouse procedures were approved by the animal committee of the Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia-CSIC [Permit Number: INTRA12 (IBV-4)]. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering. To eliminate the effect of differences in the genetic background of the animals, we backcrossed the previously described\nEpm2b\u2212/\u2212\nmice (with a mixed background 129sv:C57BL/6) [(\nAguado et al., 2010\n), (\nCriado et al., 2012\n)] with control C57BL/6JRccHsd mice obtained from Harlan laboratories (Barcelona, Spain) ten times to obtain homozygous\nEpm2b\u2212/\u2212\nin a pure background.

Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The brains were rapidly removed, frozen on dry ice, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Brain tissue sections, 14 \u03bcm thick, were cut using a microtome-cryostat (Microm HM500 OM, Walldorf, Germany), thaw mounted onto APTS (3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, Sigma, St Louis, MO)-coated slides and kept at \u221220\u00b0C until analysis.

Following anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (120 mg/kg i.p.), 9-month-old male mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA), dialysis probes were implanted in the hippocampus and secured to the skull with anchor screws and dental cement. Stereotaxic coordinates from Bregma and skull surface were: AP \u22123.00 mm, L \u22123.00 mm, DV\n\u2212\n4.5 mm; according to Franklin and Paxinos (\nFranklin, 2012\n). Microdialysis experiments were conducted 20\u201324 h after surgery in freely moving mice by continuously perfusing probes with an artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl. The aCSF was perfused at 1.6 \u03bcL/min with a Harvard model 22 syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA, USA) attached to an overhead liquid swivel (Instech, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA). An initial sample of dialysate corresponding to the first 2.5 h was discarded and then, one sample of aCSF (16 \u03bcL) was collected every 10 minutes up to 3 samples, to establish a stable baseline level of glutamate before any pharmacological intervention. Next, dihydrokainate (DHK) was administered locally by reverse dialysis through the dialysis probes. We administered 0.1 mM, 0.3 mM, 1 mM and 3 mM doses and we collected one sample of dialysate every 10 minutes (4 samples for each DHK dose).\nOn the following day, mice were injected intraperitoneally with the pro-convulsive agent pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) in order to examine glutamate levels in a challenging condition involving an increase of the excitation/inhibition ratio. After a 2.5 h stabilization period, 4 baseline dialysate 10 min samples were collected before PTZ treatment (10 and 30 mg/kg i.p.). A total of six samples of dialysate per dose were collected.\nAt the completion of dialysis experiments, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and brains were rapidly removed and frozen in dry ice for subsequent histological examination.\n\nBiochemical determinations\nThe concentration of glutamate (Glu) in dialysate samples was determined by an HPLC system consisting of a Waters 717 plus auto-sampler, a Waters 600 quaternary gradient pump, and a Nucleosil 5\u03bcm particle size ODS column (10 \u00d7 0.4 cm; Tekno-kroma, Spain). Dialysate samples were precolumn-derivatized with OPA reagent and the entire process was carried out by the autosampler. Briefly, 90 \u03bcL distilled water was added to 10 \u03bcL of dialysate sample and this was followed by the addition of 15 \u03bcL OPA reagent. After 2.5 min reaction, 80 \u03bcL of this mixture was injected into the column. Detection was carried out with a Waters 470 scanning fluorescence detector using excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 nm and 450 nm, respectively. The mobile phase was pumped at 0.8 \u03bcL/min and consisted of two components: solution A, made up of 0.05 M Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 28% methanol, adjusted to pH 6.4 with 85% H\n3\nPO\n4\n, and solution B, made up of 100% methanol/H\n2\nO (8:2 ratio) (\nCalcagno et al., 2006\n). After the elution of glutamate peak at 3 min with 100% solution A, a gradient was established going from 100% solution A to 100% solution B in 2 min. After washing out late-eluting peaks (3 min), mobile phase returned to initial conditions (100% solution A) in 2 min. The detection limit for glutamate was 0.2 pmol (signal-to-noise ratio 3). Quantification of glutamate was carried out by comparison to a daily standard curve comprising the concentrations of neurotransmitters expected in dialysate samples.\n\nmRNA quantification by qPCR.\nSixteen-days-, three-month- and twelve-month-old\nEpm2b+/+\nand\nEpm2b\u2212/\u2212\nmice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Brain was recovered and the hippocampus was dissected from the left hemisphere, snip-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Hippocampi were lysed in 400 \u03bcL trizol (TriPure Isolation Reagent, Sigma) on ice, incubated 10 min at room temperature and 80 \u03bcL of chloroform were added. Samples were vigorously vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Samples were spun at 12,000 x g 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C and 150 \u03bcL of the upper phase were collected. 187 \u03bcL of isopropanol were added and the samples were vigorously vortexed, incubated for ten minutes and spun at 16,000 x g for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol (v/v), vigorously vortexed and centrifuged again at 16,000 x g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was dried, resuspended in 50 \u03bcL of nuclease-free water and incubated at 55\u00b0C for 15 minutes. The RNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Madrid, Spain).\nReverse transcription was carried out with the Expand Reverse Transcriptase kit (Roche, Barcelona, Spain) from 1 \u03bcg of RNA according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. From the resultant cDNA, a 1:5 dilution was used in the qPCR assay. The qPCR assay was based in the Universal Probes system (Roche, Barcelona, Spain) combined with the primers indicated by Roche Probe Finder sofware (\nTable I\n). The amplification reagent used was the TaqMan Fast Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Madrid, Spain), the thermocycler was the 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Madrid, Spain) and the concentration and programs used were those indicated by the manufacturer. The quantification method used was the \u0394\u0394Ct, using as reference the expression of the hipoxantine-guanine phophoribosyltransferase (\nHprt\n) housekeeping gene.\nTable I.\nSequence of the primers used for qPCR analyses of the corresponding genes.

Brain was recovered and the right hemisphere was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for 24 hours at 4\u00b0C. After three washes with PBS, the samples were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 4 \u03bcm using a microtome HM-340E (Microm, Madrid, Spain). Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and endogenous peroxidase was inactivated by incubating 20 min with a mixture of MetOH/H\n2\nO\n2\n(29:1). Heat induced epitope retrieval was next performed incubating at 95\u00b0C for 10 min in 10 mM EDTA Tris-HCl pH9.0 buffer. Sections were next blocked in blocking buffer [5% fetal bovine serum (FBS)/1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), in PBS] and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibody. After three washes of 10 min in PBS, sections were incubated for one hour at room temperature with the biotinylated secondary antibody, washed three times with PBS for 5 min, incubated with the ABC kit (ABC, Vectastain Elite, Vector Laboratories, Madrid, Spain) for 30 min in the dark, washed three times in PBS for 5 min and developed using metal enhanced DAB method (DAB, Vector Laboratories, Madrid, Spain). IHC sections were finally counterstained with haematoxylin (Sigma, Madrid, Spain), dehydrated and mounted in DPX (Merck, Germany). Images were acquired with a DM6000 Leica Microscope and analyzed with Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). As primary antibodies we used guinea pig against GLT-1 (#AB1783, Millipore), rabbit against EAAT1 (GLAST) (#sc-15316, Santa Cruz) and rabbit against EAAT3 (EAAC1) (#124802, Abcam). As secondary antibodies we used goat against rabbit (#711065152, Jackson ImmunoResearch) or guinea pig (#AP-108B, Millipore) conjugated with biotin.\n\nWestern blot analyses\nMouse hippocampal homogenates were lysed in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% SDS and 1mM PMSF, as suggested (\nDanbolt et al., 2016b\n). The homogenates were passed five times through 25 gauge needle in 1 ml syringe, vortexed for 40 seconds, boiled 5 min at 95\u00b0C and centrifuged at 12,000xg for 10 min. Supernatants were collected, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred into PVDF membrane and revealed with the appropriate antibodies: guinea pig anti-GLT-1, rabbit against EAAT1 (GLAST) and rabbit against EAAT3 (EAAC1) (see above). Mouse anti-Gapdh (sc-32233, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) was used as loading control. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Images were obtained with a FujiLAS4000 using Lumilight Western Blotting Substrate (Roche). The results were analysed using the software Image Studio version 5.2 (LI-COR Biosciences, Germany). Experiments were performed in four individuals from each genotype.\n\nStatistical analysis.\nAnimals were distributed randomly into experimental groups. Two-way ANOVA plus Bonferroni post-hoc tests or\nt-\ntests were used to examine the effect of genotype and/or treatment, as appropriate. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software). Unless stated otherwise, all values are reported as mean \u00b1 SD. In microdialysis experiments, area under the curve (AUC) values of selected time periods have also been used when indicated. The significance level was set to p\u22640.05. Statistical significance is indicated with *p\u22640.05, **p\u2264 0.01, ***p\u2264 0.001, **** p\u2264 0.0001."

    "Methods": "Reagents and Chemicals\nAll reagents, consumables, and chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).\n\nAnimals and experimental design\nCommercially-available adult rats (200\u2013250g, Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were utilized for all experiments. Sprague-Dawley rats were used as donor nerve for processing to generate ANAs. Lewis rats were used to generate isografts or acellular nerve isografts (ANIs). For most experimental groups, Lewis rats were used, as these are a well accepted rat strain to study nerve regeneration. To assess the effects of T cells on regeneration across ANAs, athymic rats were used in experimental groups. Both T cell deficient homozygote (rnu/rnu) and T cell-sufficient heterozygote (rnu/+) athymic rats were included in order to allow for direct comparison between rats derived from a matching genetic background. This comparison minimizes confounding factors associated with any potential differences in nerve recovery between rat strains. Surgical procedures and peri-operative care measures were conducted in compliance with the AAALAC accredited Washington University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the National Institutes of Health guidelines. All animals were housed in a central animal care facility and provided with food (PicoLab rodent diet 20, Purina Mills Nutrition International, St. Louis, MO) and water ad libitum.\nThe studies included multiple independent sets of animals in order to measure a variety of different outcome metrics (\nTable 1\n). For groups, rat sciatic nerve was transected and repaired using either an ANA or isograft as indicated in\nTable 1\n. Studies in Lewis rats assessed how ANA length affected nerve regeneration across the ANA. The extent of nerve regeneration was measured at 8 weeks post operatively using histology and histomorphometry. To assess early regenerative processes, both 2 and 4 weeks were chosen as endpoints to capture cell repopulation and changes to gene expression contained within ANAs. Finally, the role of ANA length on early regenerative outcomes was assessed using a \u201cre-grafting\u201d experiment (see \u201c\nSurgical Procedures\n\u201d). After comparing ANAs based on length and identifying a potential role for T cells during nerve regeneration, the role of T cells in nerve regeneration was assessed. By considering nerve repaired using 2 cm ANAs in Lewis rats, as ANAs at this length successfully promoted regeneration and yielded robust accumulation of T cells sufficient for quantification, T cells were additional characterized at 2 weeks using cell sorting and gene analysis. To determine if the foreign nature of the ANA contributed to nerve regeneration, Lewis rat nerve was repaired using either ANAs or ANIs and evaluated for the extent of nerve regeneration at 8 weeks employing the same outcome metrics used previously. Finally, to assess the T cell role directly, athymic rats had their nerves repaired using either isografts or ANAs. The extent of nerve regeneration across these grafts was assessed at 8 weeks using histology and histomorphometry, relative muscle mass, and sciatic functional index. During surgery on athymic rats, a single rnu/+ rat died unexpectedly.\nTable 1:\nExperimental Design\nAnimal model\nTreatment\nAnimal number\nEndpoint\nAnalysis\nLewis (M)\n2 cm ANA\n6\n8 weeks\nHistology/histomorphometry, muscle mass\n4\n4 weeks\nImmunohistochemistry\n3\n4 weeks\nSC flow cytometry & qRT-PCR of sorted cells\n4\n4 weeks\nFITC-conjugated lectin perfiision analysis\n4\n2 weeks\nImmunohistochemistry\n4\n2 weeks\nqRT-PCR of cells contained within ANA\n4\n2 weeks\nT cell flow cytometry to quantify populations\n3\n2 weeks\nqRT-PCR of T cells within ANA and spleen\nLewis (F)\n2 cm ANA\n6\n8 weeks\nHistology/histomorphometry, muscle mass\nLewis (M)\n2cmANI\n6\n8 weeks\nHistology/histomorphometry, muscle mass\nLewis (M)\n4 cm ANA\n6\n8 weeks\nHistology/histomorphometry, muscle mass\n4\n4 weeks\nImmunohistochemistry\n3\n4 weeks\nSC flow cytometry & qRT-PCR of sorted cells\n4\n4 weeks\nFITC-conjugated lectin perfiision analysis\n4\n2 weeks\nImmunohistochemistry\n4\n2 weeks\nqRT-PCR of cells contained within ANA\nLewis (M)\nRe-grafted 2 cm ANA\n4\n2 weeks\nImmunohistochemistry\nLewis (M)\nRe-grafted 4 cm ANA\n4\n2 weeks\nImmunohistochemistry\nLewis (M)\n2 cm isograft\n4\n8 weeks\nHistology/histomorphometry\nrau/rau (M)\n2 cm isograft\n4\n8 weeks\nHistology/histomorphometry\nrau/rau (M)\n4 cm ANA\n4\n8 weeks\nHistology/histomorphometry\nrau/rau (M)\n2 cm ANA\n8\n8 weeks\nHistology/histomorphometry, muscle mass, SFI\nrau/+ (M)\n2 cm ANA\n8 (7)\n8 weeks\nHistology/histomorphometry, muscle mass, SFI\nOpen in a new tab\nThe group size for each metric was selected based on prior studies and power analysis. For assessing the extent of nerve regeneration at 8 weeks, we determined the minimum sample size for \u03b1=0.05, with a two-tailed t-test and at a statistical power level of 80%. It was estimated from the literature and our previous experience with rodent animal models that a standard deviation of ~20% of the mean is reasonable for the nerve regeneration outcomes proposed. Therefore, n=6 per group in rodent sets would allow for adequate detection (\u03b2=0.80) of differences in means between two groups for an effect size of at least 50%, while n=8 per group at similar conditions would allow for detection of an effect of at least 30%. For analysis of immunohistochemistry, gene expression, and cell sorting, we expected to see greater effect sizes and less variance, and thus the numbers per group in these sets was less.\n\nSurgical procedures\nFor procedures, rats were anesthesized using a cocktail of ketamine (75 mg/kg; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) and dexmedetomidine (0.5 mg/kg; Pfizer Animal Health, Exton, PA). For rats serving as graft donors, following euthanization, the sciatic nerve was exposed at the level of the trifurcation, and the dissection was extended proximally to the level of exiting nerve roots at the cruciate ligaments yielding ~4.5\u20135cm of nerve. From the harvested nerve, it was trimmed to the appropriate length for isograft or first processed (see below) and then trimmed to the appropriate length (20 mm or 40 mm lengths as necessary). In experimental rats, the right sciatic nerve was exposed and transected 5 mm proximal to the distal trifurcation. The indicated grafts were reversed (distal end of donor graft facing proximal nerve stump of recipient) sutured into the nerve gap with 9\u20130 nylon microsuture (Sharpoint, Reading, PA). The grafted nerves were shaped like a loop and inserted into an under-skin \u201cpocket\u201d around the femur as previously described for placement of long nerve grafts (\nHoben et al., 2018\n;\nPoppler et al., 2016\n;\nSaheb-Al-Zamani et al., 2013\n;\nYan et al., 2018\n). The sigmoidal nature of this path does not significantly interfere with regeneration (\nKawamura et al., 2005\n).\nFor re-grafting experiments, a set of animals was first repaired using 2 cm or 4 cm ANAs as just described. Then, under anesthesia, these ANAs were harvested and trimmed to equal lengths (1.5 cm) at the mid-graft region at 2 weeks post-repair. These 1.5 cm pre-grafted ANAs were then used to repair freshly transected nerves (\u201cre-grafted\u201d) in new rats using similar procedures as just described.\nFor all rats following nerve repair, a two-layer closure of muscle and skin was performed using 6\u20130 vicryl and 4\u20130 nylon suture, respectively. Atipamezole solution (0.1mg/kg; Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ) was administered for anesthesia reversal. The animals were recovered on a warming pad and monitored for postoperative complications before returning them to a central animal care facility. Postoperative pain was managed using Buprenorphine SR\u2122 (0.05 mg/kg; ZooPharm, Windsor, CO). Animals were monitored daily post-operatively for signs of infection and/or distress. At the appropriate endpoints, animals were euthanized with injection of Somnasol (150 mg/kg; Delmarva Laboratories) and their nerves collected for respective studies (see below).\n\nANA processing\nANAs were decellularized using a modified series of detergents in the method described previously (\nPoppler et al., 2016\n). Nerves isolated from donor animals the nerves were repeatedly washed in deionized water and three detergents in a sodium phosphate buffer: Triton X-100, sulfobetaine-16 (SB-16), and sulfobetaine-10 (SB-10). All grafts were washed and stored in 10 mM phosphate-buffered 50 mM sodium solution at 4\u00b0C and used within 3 days.\n\nHistology and histomorphometry\nTo quantify the extent of nerve regeneration, histology and histomorphometric analysis of nerve were performed as previously described (\nHunter et al., 2007\n). Briefly, tissue was collected and fixed via immersion in 3% glutaraldehyde (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA), then post fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, and serially dehydrated. These tissues were embedded in epoxy resin (Polysciences) and sectioned on an ultramicrotome for 1.5 \u03bcm cross sections. Slides were then counterstained with 1% toluidine blue dye and analyzed at 1000x overall magnification on a Leitz Laborlux S microscope. A semi-automated digital image-analysis system linked to morphometry macros developed for peripheral nerve analysis (Clemex Vision Professional, Clemex Technologies, Longueuil, Qu\u00e9bec), was used. Six random fields per histological section were imaged by a person blinded to the experiments resulting in ~75% of the available nerve cross-sectional area imaged. Binary histomorphometry analysis of the digitized information based on gray and white scales allowed measurements of total fascicular area and total fiber number in the relevant nerve sections. Further counting of myelinated fibers across multiple randomly selected fields per nerve permitted calculation of nerve fiber density (fibers/mm2), total number of myelinated fibers, distribution of myelinated fiber width (\u03bcm2), percent myelinated fiber and percent fiber debris. These numbers were averaged across the six images to obtain counts for a single animal (n=1).\n\nRelative muscle mass\nTo further quantify the extent of nerve regeneration, relative gastrocnemius muscle mass was measured as it is indicative of reinnervation of denervated muscles. After nerve harvest, the gastrocnemius muscles were harvested from the experimental and contralateral sides of rats. Wet muscle weight was recorded on each side, and the ratio of the ipsilateral to contralateral muscle weight was calculated.\n\nSciatic function index\nTo further quantify the extent of nerve regeneration, starting from 6 weeks after surgery, athymic rats underwent walking track assessment to determine functional recovery. Lewis rats developed contractures in the affected foot that prevented meaningful assessment in recovery. Rat hind feet were glazed with non-toxic paint to track at least 3 pairs of footprints. Using these footprints, the sciatic functional index (SFI) was calculated.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nTo assess cell composition and populations within ANAs, nerve samples were explanted at the endpoints described and immediately placed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffer overnight followed by immersion in 30% sucrose in PBS solution for 24\u201348 h. Samples were then frozen in OCT Compound (VWR, Radnor, PA) and sectioned at 15 \u03bcm onto pretreated charged glass slides. Sections were rehydrated with PBS and blocked using 5% normal goat serum diluted in PBS before primary antibody staining. Primary antibodies were used to stain for Schwann cells (S100), cell proliferation (Ki-67), endothelial cells (RECA-1), macrophages (CD68, CD206), and T cells (CD3, CD4). Primary antibody in 5% serum buffer was applied and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with antibodies and concentrations outlined in\nSupplementary Table 1\n. Sections were then washed in PBS and stained for the appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. All sections were mounted with Fluoroshield mounting medium with DAPI (Abcam, Boston, MA) and then imaged using the Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope and acquisition system (Olympus, Waltham, MA) at overall 200x (20x water immersion objective) or 600x magnification (60x oil immersion objective). A minimum of three sections were analyzed and averaged for each tissue area using ImageJ (NIH) to obtain a value for each single animal (n=1). For percent area, an ImageJ macro was used to quantify the percentage of the area in a standardized field that was positive for the marker measured. For cell counts, field size was kept standard at a 60x objective (600x magnification overall), and colocalization of the primary marker(s) with DAPI was considered a positive cell.\n\nFITC-conjugated lectin perfusion analysis\nTo visualize functional blood vessels, 500\u03bcg of FITC conjugated lectin (Vector Lab, Burlingame, CA) was injected intravenously into each animal under anesthesia. Five minutes after injection, the ANA graft was explanted, and the animal sacrificed. Grafts were fixed and sectioned similar to the details described in the \u201cImmunohistochemistry\u201d section. Functional vessels were visualized by its fluorescence due to binding of FITC-lectin and quantified as percent area, similar to as just described for immunohistochemistry.\n\nCell sorting\nTo further characterize Schwann cells and T cells within ANAs during ongoing regeneration, these cells were isolated from ANAs. ANAs were explanted from rats at described endpoints after nerve repair and finely minced. Each sample/animal (n=1) was then incubated with 1 mL of digestion buffer (0.1% collagenase, 0.05% DNase in 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS)/Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Media (DMEM)). Samples were incubated for 20 minutes at 37\u00b0C with constant agitation. Following digestion, the samples were re-suspended in FACS buffer (2% FBS, 0.1% EDTA in phosphate buffered saline) and filtered through a 70 \u03bcm sized cell strainer. Cells were then incubated with anti-CD32 for 10 minutes and then incubated with a cocktail of CD45-PE-Cy7, Thy1-PerCP, and O4-PE for sorting of Schwann cells. (\nIrigoyen et al., 2018\n;\nLutz, 2014\n). For staining of T cells, cells were incubated with a cocktail of CD45-PE, CD11bPE/Cy7, CD3 PerCP, CD4 FITC, CD8 Pacific blue. Cells were then washed and resuspended in FACS buffer. Cells were sorted on Aria II (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) at the Washington University Flow Cytometry core. Schwann cells were sorted by CD45\n\u2212\nThy1\n\u2212\nO4\n+\n. T cells were sorted by CD45\n+\nCD11b\n\u2212\nCD3\n+\n.\n\nRT-PCR\nTo quantify gene expression from all cells within ANAs or from individual sorted cell populations (SCs and T cells) obtained from ANAs (see \u201c\nCell sorting\n\u201d section), qRT-PCR was performed focused on select panels of genes (\nSupplemental Table II\n). For SCs, these genes included myelination and maturation genes (\nGhislain and Charnay, 2006\n), as well as activation or \u201crepair\u201d phenotype genes (\nArthur-Farraj et al., 2012\n). For ANAs and T cells, genes were focused on a panel of inflammatory cytokines related to T cell functions. Total RNA was prepared from either flow sorted cells or ANA explants. RNA was extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies), chloroform and an RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA concentration was determined on a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). The cDNA was generated with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Real-time PCR was performed using a Step One Plus thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using Taqman Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) reagents with specific oligonucleotide primer pairs (\nSupplemental Table II\n). The PCR conditions were 50\u00b0C for 2 min and then 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min, repeated for 40 cycles, with a hot start at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. The expression levels of each gene were normalized to those of the internal control gene (\nActb\n). Data was analyzed using Step One Software v2.2.2 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).\n\nCell culture (\nSupplemental Data\n)\nTo determine if the T cell-related cytokine IFN-\u03b3 could affect Schwann cells, rat Schwann cells were isolated from uninjured, adult Lewis rat sciatic nerves. Isolated nerves were de-sheathed and digested with digestion cocktail of 0.1% collagenase in DMEM and 2% FBS. Isolated cells were then cultured on PLL-laminin coated plates until confluence in DMEM, 10% FBS with 2 \u03bcM forskolin. To purify the Schwann cells, cells were treated with rabbit anti-thy1 IgM at room temperature followed by complement mediated lysis using rabbit complement. Schwann cells purity was determined by staining with S100. When indicated, Schwann cells were plated onto PLL coated cell culture dish with serum free medium (DMEM, 0.1% BSA, 1x N2 supplement) with or without 10 nM IFN-\u03b3 (Peprotec, Rock Hill, NJ).\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism. Each animal and its nerve was considered an \u2018n\u2019 value. All data were compiled as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Data were tested for normality using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Student\u2019s t test was performed for comparisons between 2 groups. A significance level of p < 0.05 was used in all statistical tests performed."

All transgenic lines were on a C57BL/6 background, except for\nMitoSOD1\n, which were on a B6SJL background. Genotyping was by standard PCR analysis on tail snip DNA.\nThy1-YFP16\nmice were identified by examination of epidermal nerve fibers in ear punches.\n\nMiro1 plasmids and transgenic mice\nThe human Miro1 plasmid was generously provided by Pontus Aspenstrom (\nFransson et al., 2003\n). To generate Miro1 transgenic mice, an N-terminal 3xFLAG tag (Sigma) was added prior to insertion into a Thy1.2 expression cassette (Addgene) (\nCaroni, 1997\n).\nThy1-3xFLAG-Miro1\ntransgenic mice were generated by pronuclear injection into fertilized eggs of C57BL/6 mice (Emory Transgenic Mouse and Gene Targeting Core Facility). Seven founders were identified by PCR, with the following primers: 5'-GAGTTGGGAAGACATCACTG-3' (forward) and 5'-AGTAGTTTCGTGTCTCCCTC-3' (reverse) to generate a 620 bp product. The line with the highest level of expression by anti-FLAG Western blot was subsequently used for breeding with\nSod1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice. Motor neuron expression was also verified in paraffin-embedded sections of the lumbar spinal cord by FLAG immunohistochemistry.\n\nNeuromuscular junction analysis\nMice were sacrificed and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and 30 \u03bcm frozen sections of tibialis anterior muscles prepared as previously described (\nFischer et al., 2004\n). Acetylcholine receptors at the motor endplate were labeled with Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated \u03b1-bungarotoxin (BTX) (Invitrogen), 1:3000 in PBS (30 min). Motor axon terminals were identified by YFP, and axonal mitochondria by CFP. Innervated, partially denervated, and denervated endplates were defined by complete, partial or absent overlap between nerve terminal and endplate, respectively. Presence or absence of mitochondria was scored only in terminals with partial or full overlap of endplates. Examiners were blinded to genotypes. All endplates were evaluated in every fourth section.\n\nPrimary motor neuron culture\nSpinal motor neurons were enriched from wild-type E12.5 mouse embryos by density centrifugation as previously described (\nFischer et al., 2011\n). Two days after plating, cells were co-transfected with dsred-Mito (Clontech) and either Miro1-GFP or GFP alone using NeuroMag beads (Oz Biosciences) as described (\nFallini et al., 2010\n). Live cell imaging of mitochondrial transport was done on a Nikon A1R confocal microscope with a heat- and CO\n2\n-controlled stage. Images were collected every 5s for 5 min using a 60x oil objective. Kymographs were processed and analyzed using ImageJ (\nMiller and Sheetz, 2004\n). Mitochondria were considered mobile if displaced \u2265 5 \u03bcm (\nKang et al., 2008\n).\n\nMitochondrial fractionation and Western blot\nSpinal cord and sciatic nerves were collected in 10 mM Tris, pH7.4, 320 mM sucrose, and 20% DMSO and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. For mitochondrial isolation, tissues were homogenized in MSE buffer (225 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 5 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM EDTA pH 8.0), using a dounce homogenizer (Wheaton). Tissue debris was discarded after centrifugation for 4 min at 1500g, and the supernatant was spun for 15 min at 20,000g. The pellet was rinsed twice with SET buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.25 M sucrose, and 0.2 mM EDTA), and the resulting mitochondria-enriched pellet was resuspended in SET buffer, frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE according to standard protocols, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes with the Trans Blot Turbo system (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies included: Miro1 (Novus, 1:1000), MFN2 (Sigma, 1:1000), TIM23 (BD Biosciences, 1:5000), and FLAG (Sigma M2, 1:1000). Blots were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence on the Chemidoc Touch (Bio-Rad), and quantified using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad)."

    "Methods": "Animal preparation\nAll the animal studies were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Animals and performed according to the National Institutes of Health\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n. Male piglets weighing between 8 and 10 kg (Michigan State University, East Lansing) were used in the present study. Piglets were allowed free access to food and water before and after the surgical procedures. This study complies with the ARRIVE guidelines for reporting\nin vivo\nexperiments. Randomization was carried out using odd/even numbers.\n\nSurgical procedures\nThe ICH models were performed based on the technique as previously described (\n23\n,\n25\n,\n26\n). Briefly, ketamine (25 mg/kg, i.m.) were used for sedation and 2% isoflurane were used through nose cone for anesthetization. The maintenance concentration of isoflurane was at 1.0 to 1.5% during the surgical operations. Core body temperature was kept at 37.5 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C using a heating pad. A polyethylene catheter (PE-160) was inserted into the right femoral artery to obtain blood for brain injection and monitoring of arterial blood pressure, blood gases, and glucose during the surgery. A cranial burr hole (1.5 mm) located at the point 11 mm right of the sagittal suture and 11 mm anterior to the coronal suture was drilled. An 18-mm-long 20-gauge sterile plastic catheter was inserted stereotaxically into the right frontal cerebral white matter. Then, 1.0 ml of autologous arterial blood was injected with an infusion pump at a rate of 100 \u03bcl/min. After a 5-minute break, another 1.5 ml blood was infused. The catheter was then slowly withdrawn. The burr hole was filled with bone wax and the skin incision was closed with sutures.\n\nExperimental protocol\nThis study was in two parts. In the first part, animals were subjected to ICH in the right frontal lobe. Then animals were euthanized at day 1 (n=8), day 3 (n=8), and day 7 (n=8) and brains were harvested for immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and hemin assay. Three sham animals only had a needle insertion. In the second part, a total of 32 piglets with ICH model in the frontal lobe were treated with vehicle (saline, n=16) or DFX (n=16) with a dose of 50 mg/kg via intramuscular injection at 2 hours after ICH and then every 12 hours for up to 7 days. Brains were harvested at day 3 (n=8) and 7 (n=8) for analysis of brain histology (n=4 each group) and hemin assay (n=4 each group).\n\nBrain in situ freezing and brain histology\nThe piglets were anesthetized and the brains were frozen in situ by decanting liquid nitrogen into a bottomless foam cup adhered to the head with Dow Corning high vacuum grease (Dow Corning, Midland, MI)(\n27\n). The piglets were decapitated and brains were harvested following the injection of potassium chloride to stop the heart beating. Then the frozen head was cut into 5-mm-thick coronal sections by a band saw. Tissues were sampled from the points of interest. For brain histology, the piglets were re-anesthetized and the brains were perfused with 10% formalin. Brains were then sectioned coronally. Paraffin-embedded brain was cut into 10-\u03bcm-thick sections and examined with immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.\n\nHemin assay\nFor free hemin assay, the brains were in situ frozen. The hematoma and perihematomal white matter tissue samples were collected, weighed, and homogenized as previously described (\n28\n). The amount of free hemin was determined by using Hemin Colorimetric Assay kit (Biovision, K672) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and Cells Counting\nThe 10-\u03bcm-thick brain sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a graded series of alcohol dilutions. The microwave boiling method was conducted to retrieve antigen using citrate buffer (10 mmol/L, pH 6.0). Immunohistochemistry examination was performed by avidin-biotin complex techniques(\n29\n). The primary antibodies were rabbit monoclonal anti-CD91 (Abcam, ab92544, 1:200 dilution) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Hpx (Abcam, ab133415, 1:400 dilution). Phosphate-buffered saline (0.1M, pH 7.4) was employed as a negative control. Counting of CD91and Hpx-positive cells was performed on high-power images (\u00d740 magnification) taken using a digital camera. Counts were performed on 4 areas in each brain section.\n\nImmunofluorescence\nFor immunofluorescence triple labeling, paraffin-embedded sections were dealt with the same method as described above to retrieve antigen. Then they were treated with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked using normal donkey serum for 30 min at room temperature. The primary antibody incubation was applied for 1.5 hr or overnight at 4\u00b0C. Sections were then rinsed with PBS for 10 min 3 times and incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 2 hr. The primary antibodies were rabbit monoclonal anti-CD91 (Abcam, ab92544, 1:100 dilution), rabbit polyclonal anti-Hpx (Abcam, ab133415, 1:300 dilution), goat polyclonal anti-Iba1 (1:300, ab107159, Abcam). DAPI was used for nuclear labeling.\n\nStatistical analysis\nMeasurements were performed by personnel blinded to each group. All the data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD.\nData were compared by using one- or two-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni multiple comparisons test.\nA probability value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Because these are novel endpoints for a porcine ICH model, we were not able to perform a power analysis to determine sample size. However, in a prior study(\n22\n), four animals per group was able to detect a 50% reduction in ferritin-positive cells with DFX at the p<0.05 level."

Male C57/BL/6 mice or Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed IV, PO, and IP at the doses indicated (\nTable 1A\n,\nB\n,\nC\n). Total concentrations of the compound were determined by liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), following plasma protein precipitation with acetonitrile and injection of the supernatant onto the column (XTerra\u00aeMS C18, 5 \u03bcm, 4.6 \u00d7 50 mm). The LC system comprised an Agilent (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA) 1100 series liquid chromatography equipped with G1379A degasser, G1311A Quantpump, G1313A autosampler and G1316A Column Oven. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using an API4000 (triple-quadrupole) instrument from AB Inc. (Canada) with an ESI interface. Brains were collected at the time points indicated, rinsed with ice-cold saline, weighed, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until analysis. For compound quantitation, brains were homogenized in 5 volumes of water. The homogenates were extracted by protein precipitation with acetonitrile. LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted as described for the plasma.

Mice were sacrificed following the last injection.\nFigures 4\n,\n5\n, and\n6\nOpen in a new tab\nEight-week old male C57BL/6J mice purchased from Charles River (Ashland, OH) were used in all studies. Mice were maintained on a 12:12 light/dark cycle and standard rodent chow and tap water were available ad libitum. Animals were sacrificed by live decapitation. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health) and have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Emory University.\nCLFB-1134 was formulated in 5% DMSO, 40% PEG-400 at 2 mg/mL and administered intraperitoneally except where otherwise noted (pharmacokinetic study). 5% DMSO, 40% PEG-400 vehicle solution is referred to throughout as drug vehicle and was also administered intraperitoneally. MPTP was formulated in sterile saline and administered subcutaneously. Sterile saline is referred to throughout at neurotoxin vehicle and was also administered subcutaneously. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). CLFB-1134 was synthesized by Califia Bio, Inc. (\nFigure 1\n).\nIn the target-engagement study, mice simultaneously treated with the neurotoxin vehicle and CLFB-1134 were compared to those treated with neurotoxin vehicle and drug vehicle. CLFB-1134 (30 mg/kg) or the drug vehicle was administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection 30 minutes prior to subcutaneous (s.c.) neurotoxin vehicle injection.\nTo investigate the neuroprotective effect of MLK3 inhibition against MPTP-induced nigrostriatal pathology (\nFigures 4\n\u2013\n6\n), mice were divided into the treatment groups described in\nTable 1\n, with the addition of untreated animals housed under identical conditions for the high performance liquid chromatography experiment described in the next section. CLFB-1134 was formulated as described above. CLFB-1134 or drug vehicle was administered via i.p. injection twice daily (8:00 am and 8:00 pm). MPTP or the neurotoxin vehicle was administered via subcutaneous s.c. injection once per day (1:00 pm).\nFigure 4.

Monoamine standards for DA, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), and norepinephrine (NE) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Briefly, dissected striata were sonicated in 0.1 M perchloric acid. Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000\u00d7g and the supernatant filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter by centrifugation at 15,000\u00d7g. The supernatants were analyzed for levels of DA, DOPAC, HVA, and NE. Quantification was made by reference to calibration curves made with individual standards.\nMPP+ levels in the striatum were evaluated as previously described (\nRichardson et al., 2008\n). Mice were sacrificed 3 hours following the last dose of MPTP. Bilateral striata were sonicated in 5% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 14,000xg. MPP\n+\nlevels were determined in the supernatants by HPLC with UV detection at 290 nm using a reverse-phase Altima C18 column (Alltech Associates Inc., Deerfield, Illinois, USA) and a mobile phase consisting of 89% 50 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\nand 11% acetonitrile. MPP\n+\nwas identified and quantified by comparison of retention time with known standards.\n\npJNK and Total JNK immunoassay\nThe levels of JNK phosphorylation at Thr183 and Tyr185 in midbrain tissue was measured using the Phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) whole cell lysate assay kit (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD). The assay was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and all samples were analyzed in duplicate. In brief, dissected mouse midbrain tissues were homogenized in 1X complete lysis buffer. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000xg, at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes and supernatant was collected. Total protein concentration in the lysate was determined using a BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific). The Meso Scale Discovery plate was prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, using lysate at a concentration of 0.2 \u00b5g/\u00b5L. The Meso Scale Discovery plate was read on the SECTOR Imager 2400 instrument (Meso Scale Discovery). Data represent background-subtracted chemiluminescent signal units.\n\nWestern Blot Analysis\nWestern blots were used to quantify the expression of tyrosine hydroxlase (TH) present in samples of striatal tissue from treated and control mice. Analysis was performed as previously described (\nCaudle et al., 2006\n). Briefly, unilateral striatum samples were homogenized, a BCA protein assay kit from Pierce (Rockford, IL) was used, and 5 ug (in 5 uL) of striatal protein were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following ectrophoretic transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, nonspecific sites were blocked in 7.5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline. Membranes were incubated overnight in a polyclonal antibody to TH (Immunostar, Hudson, WI, 1:1000). TH antibody binding was detected using a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:10,000) and enhanced chemiluminescence. The luminescence signal was captured on an Alpha Innotech Fluorochem imaging system and stored as a digital image. Membranes were stripped for 15 minutes at room temperature with Pierce Stripping Buffer and sequentially reprobed with \u03b2-actin (1:3,000) antibody. Immunoreactivity of TH was normalized to \u03b2-actin levels to ensure equal protein loading across samples. Monoclonal mouse anti-\u03b2-actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). SuperSignal West Dura Extended duration substrate and stripping buffer were obtained from Pierce (Rockford, IL).\n\nHistology and Stereology\nTissue staining and cell counts were performed as described previously (\nCaudle et al., 2007\n). Briefly, midbrain blocks from control and treated mice were immersion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4\u00b0C and equilibrated in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4\u00b0C before being cryosectioned (40 \u03bcm, coronal slice). Sections were incubated with a polyclonal anti-TH antibody overnight (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). TH signal was amplified with an ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and then sections were incubated in a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. Visualization was performed using 3,3\u2019-diaminobenzedine with nickel enhancement (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 3 minutess at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with monoclonal anti-NeuN antibody overnight (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). NeuN signal was amplified with ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories) and sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. Visualization was performed using 3,3-diaminobenzidine for 3 minutes at room temperature. For cresyl violet stained tissue, a 0.1% aqueous cresyl violet solution (from\nPoly Scientific R&D Corp, New York\n) was used followed by destain and dehydration in ethanol and xylenes.\nUnbiased stereological estimates of TH+ and total (NeuN+ or cresyl violet) neurons were performed using the optical fractionator method in StereoInvestigator analysis software with sampling parameters chosen to maintain a coefficient of error under 0.12 (MicroBrightField, Williston, VT). The substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) was delineated using previously described criteria (\nWest et al., 1991\n). After delineation at low magnification, every sixth section was sampled at 40x oil-immersion objective on a Nikon 90i microscope (Nikon Melville, NY).\n\nStatistics\nGraphPad Prism (version 6) was used. When comparing only two groups, unpaired, two-tailed t-tests were used. Comparison across more than two treatment groups was carried out by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the multiple comparisons q (Newman\u2010Keul\u2019s) test. Throughout analysis,\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nData were obtained from 10, adult female Wistar rats aged 11-18 months (Charles Rivers Laboratories, Wilmington, MA), ranging in weight from 340-480 g. Rats were randomly assigned to one of two groups: an antagonist reinnervation group (5 rats) subjected to survival nerve surgery described below or a control group (5 rats), receiving no treatment prior to terminal experimentation. All rats were studied during single terminal experiments, after which they were euthanized by isoflurane overdose and exsanguination. All procedures for animal care and experimentation were approved by the Wright State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n2.2. Survival Surgery\nSurgical nerve section and repair were performed during survival surgeries on 5 rats (ages 4.2-4.7 months) assigned to the antagonist reinnervation group. With rats deeply anesthetized by isoflurane delivered via nose cone (1.0-2.5% in 100% oxygen), the left common fibular peroneal nerve was surgically exposed by skin incision over the head of the fibula, cut through using microscissors, and immediately joined end-to-end through the epineurium with one to two sutures (10-0 ethilon). The skin incision was sutured closed, and a subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) was given before anesthesia was discontinued. Animals were then returned to their cages and monitored throughout the recovery period. Additional buprenorphine was given prophylactically every 12 hours for the first 48 hours after surgery in order to alleviate the possibility of pain. Regularly scheduled veterinary observations and care revealed no signs of pain, distress, or infection of the treated rats throughout the 9.4-14.0 months following survival surgery.\n\n2.3. Terminal Experiments: Preparation\nIdentical terminal experiments were performed on the reinnervation and control groups when the ages of member rats ranged, respectively from 13.4-18.6 months and 11.3-15.3 months. Experiments were similar to those described in earlier studies from this laboratory\n23\n. Briefly, rats were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation (1-3% in 100% oxygen) adjusted to maintain appropriate values for continuously-monitored vital signs, including heart rate, blood O\n2\nsaturation, expired CO\n2\n, temperature (37 \u00b1 1\u00b0 C), and respiratory rate. Surgical preparations under these conditions included freeing the TA and gastrocnemius (G) muscles (both lateral and medial gastrocnemii) and their nerves from surrounding tissues. After marking the resting lengths (Lr) of TA and G muscles with knee and ankle positioned at 90\u00b0 flexion and plantar flexion, respectively, their tendons of insertion were severed. The rat was then fixed in a stereotaxic frame by clamps at the snout, lumbar spinous processes, and at the femur, just above the knee and ankle (both fixed at 90\u00b0). Next, the TA and G muscles were attached through their cut tendons directly to the lever arms of individual servo-motors which, in length servo mode, delivered computer driven muscle stretches while monitoring force and length (\nFig. 1A\n). Bipolar wire electrodes were inserted into each muscle to record EMG. In final preparation for recording, the dorsal surface of the brain was surgically exposed for mid-collicular decerebration which rendered the rat insensate yet reflex responsive to muscle stretch when isoflurane was discontinued for the duration of data collection.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nStretch reflex test-condition paradigm. A: Key features of in vivo recording: gastrocnemius (G) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles attached through tendons to length servo motors controlling muscle stretch; electrodes in both muscles record electromyographic (EMG) signals. B: Continuous record segments of force, length, and EMG for G and TA muscles taken from control rat.

C: Simplified illustration shows the convergence of test and conditioning stimuli onto G motor pools. Arrows indicate the sum of excitatory and inhibitory input from both test and conditioning stretches. D: Reflex force estimated at the peak of ramp stretch as the difference in force (a) measured with the muscle nerve intact (black line) vs cut (grey line). The force occurring immediately before stretch is referred to as the background force (b).\n\n2.4. Terminal Experiments: Protocol\nThe function of antagonist reflex pathways was examined using a test-condition design (\nFig. 1C\n), whereby the G muscle stretch reflex (test response) was conditioned in alternate trials by stretch applied to the ipsilateral (left) TA muscle (\nFigs 1A\n,\nB\n). Parameters of stretch were identical for each muscle: ramp-hold-release, with ramp and release each 50ms in duration at constant velocity (20mm/s), hold phase 500ms, amplitude 1mm, repeated at 2s intervals in order to minimize reflex history dependence and maximize data collection. Stretches were applied on a background of no muscle contraction preceding stretch, verified by the absence of EMG. Data were collected with the G muscles stretched out to different fixed lengths and corresponding levels of passive muscle tension (0.2 \u2013 1.0N), in order to examine the effect of varying magnitude of the test stretch reflex. Several additional measures were taken at the end of each experiment. First, the nerves supplying the left G and TA muscles were cut and muscles were stretched at different fixed levels of background force and length just as they were with nerves intact, in order to estimate the passive force component of stretch responses\n24\n. Second, maximum force was recorded during tetanic electrical stimulation (0.04ms pulses at 50Hz) of the distal ends of the cut muscle nerves. Finally, muscle wet weights were obtained from TA and G muscles extracted bilaterally before rats were euthanized.\n\n2.5. Measuring strength of test and conditioned reflexes\nMuscle force, muscle length, and EMG obtained during the experiments were recorded, digitized (20 kHz) and stored on a computer for later analysis using CED Spike 2 software. The force muscle stretch attributable to reflex pathways was estimated by subtracting passive force measured when the nerve was cut (see above)\n25\n,\n26\n. Analysis was restricted to reflex force measured at the peak of ramp stretch (\nFig. 1D\n). Reflex responses after ramp peak were not analyzed, because of high variability among individual rats in both control and antagonist reinnervation groups. These measures were taken from test and conditioned stretch trials. Each trial of G test stretch was compared with the succeeding TA conditioning trial. Conditioning that reduced test reflex force was labeled suppression, while increased test reflex force was labeled facilitation (\nFig. 3\n).\nFigure 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nReflex Modulation by Antagonist Muscle Stretch.

Negative values represent suppression while positive values represent facilitation. Individual examples of suppression (B) and facilitation (C).

Individual examples of suppression (E) and facilitation (F). Isometric force, G EMG, and G length at matched background forces.\n\n2.6. Bayesian Data Analysis\nAnalyses focused on the strength, proportion and force dependency of suppression and facilitation for both reinnervation and control groups. We employed Bayesian models to compute parameters in order to explicitly test our working hypothesis that nerve injury and repair reduces suppression in antagonist reflex circuits. We empirically derived the full joint posterior probability distributions of model parameters simultaneously (e.g. means, standard deviations, and effect sizes) and directly examined the posterior distributions. This enabled intuitive statistical judgments regarding the strength of the evidence in favor of either the alternative or null hypothesis\n27\n-\n29\n. Bayesian analytic techniques were chosen because they present noteworthy advantages over frequentist analysis such as null hypothesis statistical testing (NHST) e.g.\nt\n-test and ANOVA. Bayesian analytics do not require making assumptions that traditional ANOVA necessitates (e.g. normally distributed data, heteroscedasticity, multiple-test correction)\n28\n-\n30\n.\nBayesian inference was performed by inspecting the highest density interval (HDI), such that values inside the 95% of the HDI are more credible than outside values\n30\n. HDI was used to make unbiased decisions on parameter values. For example, when performing a mean comparison test (i.e. determining experimental group difference), an HDI of a credible difference distribution that does not span zero indicates that the model predictions for the two conditions of interest are different from each other. This reallocates evidential support in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the parameters for both populations are unequal. Alternatively, if an HDI of a credible difference distribution spans zero, that indicates the model predictions for the two conditions do not differ. By defining a region of practical equivalence (ROPE) range (values between \u22120.1 and 0.1), Bayesian analytic techniques afford the ability to accept the null hypothesis. In practice, when the 95% HDI falls completely within the ROPE region we declare the ROPE value accepted and determine that group differences are practically equivalent to zero.\nAll models were developed in fully Bayesian framework with the\nrstanarm\npackage (2.18.1)\n31\nin the R environment (3.5.0)\n32\n.\nRstanarm\nimplements regression models in\nstan\n33\n, which are fit using Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to compute credible parameter values (\u03b8) e.g. means, standard deviations, regression coefficients, effect sizes\n34\n,\n35\n. For intercepts and predictors we use Student\u2019s\nt\n-distribution with mean zero and four degrees of freedom as the prior distribution. The scale of the prior distribution is 10 for the intercept and 2.5 for the predictors. Each model was run with four independent chains for 1,000 warm-up and 4,000 sampling steps. For all parameters, the number of effective samples was >500. Convergence was assessed and assumed to have reached the stationary distribution by ensuring that the Gelman\u2013Rubin shrinkage statistic for all reported parameters was <1.05\n36\n. We report the expected mean parameter values alongside 95% credible intervals using (HDI). We estimate the percent of variance explained by regression models by computing the Bayesian equivalent to\nR\n2\n37\n."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nPregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Kingston, New York) were received on gestation day (G) 2. All dams were individually housed in tub cages and maintained on a 12-h light / 12-h dark cycle with lights on at 0600. A total of 40 dams were divided into two weight-matched groups (\nn\n= 20 per group). Beginning on G2, dams were given ad libitum access to water and either standard chow diet (CHOW; LabDiet 5001, 13.5% kcal from fat, 28.5% kcal from protein, 58% kcal from carbohydrates) or HF diet (Research Diets D12492, 60% kcal from fat, 20% kcal from protein, 20% kcal from carbohydrates). Dams remained on their respective diets from G2 throughout the remainder of the experiment.\nThe day each dam gave birth was defined as postnatal day (P) 0 for the respective litter of pups. On P1, pups were weighed and litters were culled to 10 pups each (5 male and 5 female). Animals were weighed weekly thereafter. On P21, one male pup per litter was killed by rapid decapitation. The brain was extracted, flash frozen on powdered dry ice, and stored at \u201380 \u00b0C for further analysis as described below. All pups were weaned onto standard chow (LabDiet 5001) at P21. Starting on P95, one male per litter was used for behavioral testing. At P150, a behaviorally naive male littermate was killed by rapid decapitation. The brain was extracted, flash frozen on powdered dry ice, and stored at \u201380 \u00b0C for further analysis as described below.\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\n2.2. Behavioral testing\nBehavioral testing began approximately at P95 and was completed in the following order: locomotor activity test, novel object recognition test, Barnes maze. Behavioral tests were separated by at least 2 days.\n2.2.1. Locomotor activity\nThe activity monitor consists of a 40 cm\n2\nsquare testing arena and an automated tracking system (Omnitech Electronics Inc., Columbus, Ohio). Beginning in the middle of the light phase (and corresponding with the start time of all other behavioral tests) each rat was placed individually into the center of a testing arena in room that was novel to all animals. Rats were allowed to freely explore for 30 min. Distance traveled was automatically recorded via infrared beam breaks and was accumulated in 5-min bins.\n2.2.2. Novel object recognition test\nTwo objects of different color, shape and size (Duplo-Lego blocks, Lego, USA) were placed in opposite corners of a 60 cm\n2\nsquare testing arena. On the first day of the test, each rat was placed in the center of the arena and allowed to explore for 5 min. Twenty-four hours later, one \u2018familiar\u2019 object was replaced with a \u2018novel\u2019 object. Each rat was again placed in the center of the arena and allowed to explore for 5 min. Time spent exploring each object was recorded.\n2.2.3. Barnes maze\nThe Barnes maze consists of a dark grey PVC circular platform (122 cm diameter, elevated 70 cm above the floor), with 18 holes (9.5 cm diameter) equally spaced around the perimeter. A hidden escape box was placed under one of the holes. Three visual cues and a bright light were fixed around the perimeter of the maze. Rats were allowed to explore the maze during two trials a day for five consecutive days. If a rat failed to find the escape box within 180 s it was gently guided to the escape where it was allowed to remain for 10 s. One week after the final acquisition trial, each rat was given a single probe trial with the escape box present. Latency to entering the escape box was measured for each trial.\n\n2.3. Hippocampal gene expression\nBrain tissue was used to measure gene expression by real-time PCR (P21 and P150). The dentate gyrus and dorsal hippocampus (HPC) were isolated together from 400uM thick frozen coronal sections using a blunted 16-guage needle (inner diameter 1.65 mm) based on published coordinates (\nPaxinos and Watson, 2004\n). Dentate gyrus coordinates relative to bregma: (anterior-posterior \u20132.8 mm, medial-lateral \u00b1 0.4 mm, dorsal-ventral \u20134.4 mm). CA3 of the dorsal hippocampus co-ordinates relative to bregma: (anterior-posterior \u20132.8 mm, medial-lateral \u00b1 1.4 mm, dorsal-ventral \u20133.0 mm).\nTissue punches were placed in Qiazol immediately after isolation. Total RNA was then extracted using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was generated using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).\nCandidate genes previously implicated in both metabolism and cognition were selected. Expression levels of the insulin receptor (\nInsr\n) (\nReagan, 2007\n;\nFadel et al., 2013\n), leptin receptor (\nLepr\n) (\nGrillo et al., 2011\n;\nFadel et al., 2013\n;\nMcGregor et al., 2015\n), glucose transporter 1 (\nSlc2a1\n) (\nJais et al., 2016\n), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (\nBdnf\n) (\nPark et al., 2010\n;\nMolteni et al., 2004\n), glucocorticoid receptor (\nNr3c1\n) (\nSasaki et al., 2014\n), acid sphingomyelinase (\nSmpd1\n) (\nPark et al., 2018\n), FK506 binding protein 5 (\nFkbp5\n) (\nBalsevich et al., 2014\n;\nKalyan-Masih et al., 2016\n), and gastrin releasing peptide receptor (\nGrpr\n) (\nKauer-Sant\u2019Anna et al., 2007\n;\nRoesler et al., 2006\n;\nYang et al., 2017\n) were assessed relative to beta-actin (\nActb).\nQuantitative real-time PCR reactions were carried out in triplicate using 1xTaqMan master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 1xTaqMan probes for each gene, and 2 \u03bcg of cDNA in a total of 20 \u03bcL. Real-time PCR reactions were performed on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system under standard conditions for 40 cycles. Data were analyzed using the-\u0394\u0394Ct method.\n\n2.4. Statistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was completed using Statistica 7 (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK). Data are expressed as averages \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Differences between groups were assessed by t-test or repeated measures ANOVA with \u2018diet\u2019 as the between subject factor followed by Tukey post hoc analysis. For all statistical tests,\nP\n< 0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Materials.\nAll the solvents used in this study were either HPLC grade or LC-MS grade and obtained from Fisher Scientific USA. All the internal standards used were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipid Inc. Atlanta, USA.\n\nControlled cortical impact model and sample collection.\nThe CCI model was performed as described previously (Bayir et al. 2007). Briefly, seventeen-day-old male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were anesthetized with 3.5% isoflurane in O\n2\n. The trachea was intubated with a 14-gauge angiocatheter and rats were mechanically ventilated during sham and CCI surgery. Anesthesia was maintained with 2% isoflurane in N2O/O2 (2:1). and maintained on 2% isoflurane in N\n2\nO/O\n2\n(2:1). A craniotomy was made over the left parietal cortex. For all studies, a 6-mm metal pneumatically driven impactortip was used, velocity was 4.0 \u00b1 0.2 m/sec, depth of penetration was 2.5 mm, and duration of deformation was 50 milliseconds. After TBI, the bone flap was replaced, sealed with dental cement, and the scalp incision was closed. After a 1 - hour monitoring period, rats were weaned from mechanical ventilation, extubated, and returned to their cages until further study. At euthanasia, plasma and cortex were collected and cortex was snap-frozen for lipidomics.\n\nLipid extraction and mass spectrometry analysis\nThe pericontusional cortex was isolated from the brain and the lipids were extracted using the folch method. Total phosphate content of the lipids was quantified using the method reported previously (\nAnthonymuthu et al., 2019\n). For phospholipid analysis, samples corresponding to approximately 2.5 nanomol of total phosphate were supplemented with the appropriate internal standards (5 picomoles each of phosphatidylcholine (PC) (17:0/17:0), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (17:0/17:0), phosphatidylinositol (PI) (16:0/16:0), CL (14:0/14:0/14:0/14:0), phosphatidylserine (PS) (17:0/17:0), phosphatidic acid (PA) (17:0/17:0), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (17:0/17:0)) and analyzed using LC-MS/MS. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system coupled on-line to a Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) using a Silica (2) column (Luna 3 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5, 150 \u00d7 2 mm , Phenomenex, Torrance CA). A multi-step gradient with solvents A (hexane/ propanol/water/trimethylamine /formic acid, 43:57:1:0.5:0.01 v/v containing 10 mM ammonium acetate) and B (hexane/propanol/water/triethylamine/formic acid, 43:57:1:0.5:0.01 v/v containing 10 mM ammonium acetate) was used as follows: 0\u201315 min linear gradient from 10% B to 37% A at 200 \u03bcl/min, 15-23 min linear gradient from 37% to 40% B at 200 \u03bcl/min, 23-25 min linear gradient from 40% to 100% B and at a linear increase in flow rate at 200-225 \u03bcl/min, 27 \u2013 47 min isocratic at 100% B at 225 \u03bcl/min, 47-57 min linear gradient from 100% to 10% B with a linear decrease in flow rate from 225 to 200 \u03bcl/min then the column was re-equilibrated for 13 minutes with 10% solvent B at 200 \u03bcl/min. The mass spectrum was acquired in a data dependent acquisition with a negative ion mode from 0-57 minutes. The spray voltage was set as 3.2 KV with a sheath gas flow rate of 10 arbitrary units. The spectrum was recorded at 70000 FWHM resolution between 360 to 1600 m/z range with top 10 ions selected for fragmentation. HCD fragmentation with 24 NCE was used while the ions were isolated at + 1 m/z isolation window.\nBlood samples were centrifuged at 2000 \u00d7 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C to collect plasma. The total lipids from plasma were extracted using the Bligh and Dyer method as described previously. Total phospholipid content was quantified using the micro method for phosphorus measurement (\nAnthonymuthu et al., 2019\n). Extracted lipids were re-suspended in n-hexane:2-propanol:water, 43:57:1 (v/v/v) and injected into liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system for lipid identification and quantification. Lipid extracts equivalent to 30 \u03bcl of plasma and 15 nmol of total phospholipids were used for CL and phospholipid analysis respectively. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using a Dionex UltimateTM 3000 RSLCnano System coupled online to a Q-Exactive hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Extracted lipids were injected into a normal phase column (Silica Luna 3 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5, 150\u00d72 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance CA), and chromatography was performed using a gradient system of solvent A and solvent B (n-hexane:2-propanol:water, 43:57:8 [v/v/v]) with 10mM ammonium acetate at the following intervals: 0-15 min, linear gradient of 10% to 37% B at 200 \u03bcl/min flow rate; 15-23 min, linear gradient of 65% B at 200 \u03bcl/min; 23-25 min, linear gradient of 100% B at 225 \u03bcl/min; 25-47 min, isocratic flow of 100% B at 225 \u03bcl/min; 47-57 min, linear gradient of 10% B at 200 \u03bcl/min; 57-70 min, re-equilibration of 10% B 200 \u03bcl/min for 15 minutes. Mass spectrometry was performed with the following conditions: Ion source-Heated Electron Spray Ionization, Spray voltage - 3.2 kV, capillary temperature- 320\u00b0C, sheath gas flow-8 units, S-lens Rf level- 65. Mass spectrum were collected at 140,000 full width at half maximum (FWHM) between 1220-1600 m/z and 300-1600 m/z respectively. Fragmentation was triggered in a data dependent mode with top-5 intensity ions from the inclusion list isolated and fragmented by high collision dissociation (HCD) with a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 24.\n\nIdentification and quantification of lipid species\nIdentification and quantitation of the lipid species were performed with an optimized work flow developed for the redox lipidome using Compound discoverer v.2.0 software (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) as described earlier. In brief, the peaks with S/N ratio greater than 3 and minimum ion intensity of 5000 were identified and searched against phospholipid targeted m/z list generated for all possible acyl chain combinations of phospholipids. The list was further filtered by the retention time (RT) for each lipid class. Lipids eluted within 2.5 min of the internal standards retention time were considered for further analysis. The identified lipids were manually confirmed by verifying the fragmentation pattern of representative lipids of the same class. The values obtained were normalized to internal standard and quantified using calibration curve.\nData analysis and statistics.\nMost of the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (OPLSD) was performed using SIMCA (UMETRICS) software. A\nP\nvalue less than 0.05 was considered a significant change."

    "Methods": "Traditionally, temperature-responsive spinal neurons have been investigated byin vivoelectrophysiology. These studies reveal the impressive functional diversity of dorsal horn neurons. Hellon and Misra report spinal neurons that respond to cold, heat, or both (Hellon and Misra, 1973). Among each of these subsets, some of the neurons also respond to mechanical stimuli. Adding to the complexity, neurons respond to temperature stimuli with distinct kinetics, including neurons only respond to the change in temperature, neurons respond statically to steady temperature, and neurons that respond to both. Many of their findings were later confirmed by other studies, some of which further characterized the distributions of neurons\u2019 thermal activation thresholds and temperature-response relationships (Burton 1975; Bester et al., 2000). More recently, Craig and colleagues provided a relatively comprehensive examination of response to cutaneous temperature of spinothalamic neurons, a major output of the spinal dorsal horn in cats (Andrew and Craig, 2001;Craig et al., 2001). They functionally classify temperature-responsive spinothalamic neurons in the superficial laminae into four major classes, based on their response to (1) noxious mechanical and heat stimuli, (2) heat, cold, and mechanical stimuli, (3) cold only, and (4) warm only. Neurons within each subclass greatly differ by their activation threshold, temperature-response relationship, and response kinetics (Andrew and Craig, 2001;Craig et al., 2001).\n\nAlthough results fromin vivoelectrophysiological recording provided the first glance of the how spinal neurons respond to cutaneous temperature change, the high extent of transcriptomic, projectomic, morphological, and physiological diversity of spinal neurons necessitates large numbers of neurons to be functionally sampled before sensory processing could be understood at the network level. In this regard,in vivoelectrophysiology is significantly limited by its throughput. For example, out of 474 neurons Craig and colleagues recorded, only 10 neurons are warm-responsive (Andrew and Craig, 2001), making it infeasible to further analyzing their response properties in detail or to characterize them after loss-of-function manipulations. Besides the low throughput ofin vivoelectrophysiology, further dissection of the thermosensory circuitry requires one to understand the roles of distinct cell types in processing temperature information (Luo et al., 2008,2018). In this regard,in vivoelectrophysiology is limited in its capacity to correlate the response of a group of neurons with their gene expression and connectivity profiles, such that this group of neurons can be reliably targeted using genetic or circuit tracing tools.\n\nRecently-developedin vivocalcium imaging tools allow neuronal activity to be probed by measuring intracellular calcium level, which can be detected by the emerging variety of calcium indicators. The calcium imaging technology has complemented electrophysiology and immediate early gene expression analysis in understanding the neural coding in many systems. Compared to electrophysiology and immediate early gene expression analysis, calcium imaging is advantageous in several ways.1)Calcium imaging allows activities of many neurons to be recorded simultaneously. In this way, response to mild sensory stimuli, such as lukewarm temperature which normally does not activate many neurons (Andrew and Craig, 2001), can now be effectively captured and correctly classified (Ran et al., 2016). Similarly, when characterizing response in mutants with reduced responsiveness, calcium imaging allows responses from sufficient number of neurons to be recorded and compared with responses from wild type animals. This is particularly important for studying the spinal dorsal horn, given the high degree of heterogeneity of neurons (Abraira et al., 2017;Cui et al., 2016;Todd, 2010).2)Calcium imaging also allows specific populations of defined neuronal cell types to be directly visualized and recorded. This includes both genetically-defined cell types using cell type-specific driver lines, as well as projection- or inputs-defined cell types using retrograde tracer and anterograde/retrograde trans-synaptic tracing tools (seeGenetic dissection of spinal circuits), and functionally-defined cell types using genetic tools (Callaway and Luo, 2015;DeNardo and Luo, 2017;Lo and Anderson, 2011;Luo et al., 2018;Schwarz et al., 2015;Tasaka et al., 2018;Wertz et al., 2015;Wickersham et al., 2007;Zingg et al., 2017).3)Calcium imaging allows correlating neurons response properties with their precise spatial locations, as neurons can be directly visualized in space. The high spatial resolution makes calcium imaging particularly suitable for investigating possible sensory maps (Chen et al., 2011;Ohki et al., 2005;Rothschild et al., 2010;Stettler and Axel, 2009).4)Calcium imaging offers exquisite spatial resolution, which is essential when specifically analyzing the activity of dendrites and axons (Broussard et al., 2018;Jia et al., 2010;Petreanu et al., 2012;Sun et al., 2016;Vrontou et al., 2013).5)Calcium imaging allows the same population of neurons to be recorded over multiple days to examine how chronic forms of plasticity, such as chronic pain, changes sensory processing.\n\nWhile calcium imaging is advantageous in many respects, it is important to keep in mind the limitations of calcium imaging.1)Light scattering limits the imaging depth in highly scattering tissue like the spinal cord. Using two-photon microscopy, structures ~1 mm below the cortical surface would be imaged (Theer et al., 2003). However, deep tissue imaging requires high excitation power, which in turn results in significant tissue heating (Podgorski and Ranganathan, 2016). This limits the practical imaging depth to the most superficial ~300 um, when a bright fluorophore (tdTomato) is used (Ran et al., Unpublished data).In vivoelectrophysiology should be the method of choice when recording from neurons in the deep dorsal horn / ventral horn.2)Calcium signal is an indirect measurement of neuronal activity and is slow in nature. While the temporal resolution of calcium signal usually does not limit the analysis of response kinetics to slow stimuli, such as temperature and chemicals, deconvolution methods may be necessary in other situations, such as characterizing the adaptation for mechanosensitive neurons (Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016;Vogelstein et al., 2010;Yaksi and Friedrich, 2006)."

Maintenance and breeding of mice\nGnal\n+/\u2212\nmice and wild-type isogenic (\nGnal\n+/+\n) littermates were used in the experiments described here.\nGnal\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice nurse poorly and typically die within 2 to 4 days after birth (\nBelluscio et al., 1998\n). Only rarely do\nGnal\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice survive to adulthood (\nBelluscio et al., 1998\n). All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health's Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n2.2. Biogenic monoamines\nAbnormal striatal monoamine levels have reported in several mouse models of dystonia (\nRose et al., 2015\n;\nYokoi et al., 2006\n;\nZhao et al., 2008\n) but, to our knowledge, have not yet been described in\nGnal\n+/\u2212\nmice. Therefore, to this end, striata were acutely harvested from 3 male and 3 female\nGnal\n+/+\nand\nGnal\n+/\u2212\nmice at 10 months-of-age. All subsequent processing was completed by the Vanderbilt University Neurochemistry Core as previously described (\nXiao et al., 2017\n). Briefly, tissue samples were homogenized with a dismembrator in a solution (pH 3.8) containing 100mM trichloroacetic acid (TCA), 10mM sodium acetate, 0.1mM EDTA, 5 ng/ml isoproterenol (as internal standard) and 10.5% methanol. Homogenates (10 \u03bcl) were collected for assay of protein concentrations. Samples were then spun in a micro-centrifuge at 10,000 \u00d7g for 20 min and the supernatant was removed for monoamine analysis. Biogenic amines were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography utilizing an Antec Decade II (oxidation: 0.65) electrochemical detector operated at 33 \u00b0C. Supernatants (20 \u03bcl) were injected using a Water 2707 autosampler onto a Phenomenex Kintex (2.6 u, 100 A) C18 HPLC column (100 \u00d7 4.60 mm). Biogenic amines were eluted with a mobile phase consisting of 89.5% 100mM TCA, 10mM sodium acetate, 0.1mM EDTA and 10.5% methanol (pH 3.8). Solvents were delivered at 0.6 ml/min using a Waters 515 HPLC pump. Using this HPLC solvent biogenic amines were eluted in the following order: noradrenaline, 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC); dopamine (DA); 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA); homovanillic acid (HVA); 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HT); and 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT). HPLC control and data acquisition were managed by Empower software. Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).\n\n2.3. Haloperidol treatments\nMice of each genotype were randomized to treatment with either haloperidol (1 mg/kg intraperitoneal [IP]; Sigma-Aldrich, MO) or vehicle (saline containing 0.1% acetic acid) at 10 months-of-age. In pilot experiments, we performed dose-response effects (0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg) of haloperidol to establish the optimal dose (\nFig. S1\n). Additionally, the haloperidol dose (1 mg/kg body weight) chosen for our study provides optimal catalepsy responses in mice (\nKim et al., 2008\n;\nViyoch et al., 2001\n).\n\n2.4. Behavioral assessments\nGnal\n+/\u2212\nmice and sex-matched\nGnal\n+/+\nlittermates at 10 months-of-age were weighed (\nFig. S2\n) and subjected to a battery of motor tests 3 and 6 h after haloperidol or vehicle treatments as previously described (\nBarnes et al., 1990\n;\nKhan et al., 2018\n;\nXiao et al., 2017\n;\nXiao et al., 2016\n). Motor testing was performed by investigators blinded to genotypes and treatment in the following order: raised beam task, rotarod, catalepsy, and open-field activity.\nMice were acclimated to an 80-cm long, 20-mm wide beam elevated 50 cm above a padded base. A 60W lamp at the start served as an aversive stimulus, whereas the opposite end of the beam entered a darkened escape box. Slips were counted as mice traversed a 12-mm diameter square beam and traversal times were recorded. Single runs were performed at 3 and 6 h after injection of either haloperidol or vehicle.\nMice were acclimated to a Rotamex-5 rotarod (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA) rotating at 5 rpm for 5 min on the day prior to data acquisition. On the following day, mice were exposed to a 30 s acclimation period at 4 rpm followed by an acceleration of 4 rpm every 30 s to a target of 40 rpm at 5 min. Rotarod activity was evaluated 3 and 6 h after haloperidol or vehicle injections.\nBar-test catalepsy was evaluated by placing both forepaws of the mouse over a horizontal bar (diameter: 1 cm), elevated 4 cm from floor (\nBarnes et al., 1990\n). The time during which the mouse maintained this position was recorded with a maximum duration of 180 s. The test was performed at 3 h and 6 h after haloperidol or vehicle treatment. The total amount of time that the mice remained in a cataleptic posture was calculated to give the cumulative catalepsy time for each group.\nFor assessment of open-field activity, mice were placed in commercially-available activity monitors (MED Associates) for 10-min sessions. The activity monitors measured 27 \u00d7 27 cm, with 16 infrared photocell beams equally spaced in the x and y axes of the horizontal plane, 1 cm from the chamber floor. An additional array of 16 photocells was situated 5 cm above the floor to track rearing. All tests were conducted in the dark. One hour prior to testing, cages were moved from the housing racks to a quiet anteroom adjacent to the testing room. Following this period of habituation, animals were removed from their home cage, immediately placed in the center of the open field and allowed to freely explore the apparatus for a test interval of 10 min. Animals were scored for a number of behaviors including total distance traveled (cm). The data recorded during testing was scored in post-session analyses using commercially-available software (Activity Monitor 5.1, Med Associates). Open-field activity was evaluated 3 h and 6 h after haloperidol or vehicle injections.\n\n2.5. Immunohistochemistry\nFluorescent immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (\nKhan et al., 2018\n). Briefly, mice were rapidly anesthetized with pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, IP) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (PB) (pH 7.4). Brains were removed and post-fixed in the same solution overnight and cryo-protected with 30% sucrose in PB at 4 \u00b0C. Serial coronal sections of striatum of each group were cut on a cryostat (Leica) and incubated with blocking reagent (5% BSA and 1% goat serum in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with one or more of the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-53BP1 (#ab21083, Abcam), mouse anti-phospho-\u03b3-H2A.X (Ser139) (#80312, Cell Signaling), mouse anti-D2R (#sc-5303, Santa Cruz) (\nSalti et al., 2015\n;\nXiao et al., 2009\n), rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) (#9701, Cell Signaling) and goat anti-ChAT antibody (#AB144P, Chemicon). TP53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) and phospho-\u03b3-H2A.X (Ser139) serve as reliable markers of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed using a commercially available in situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Diagnostics). TUNEL staining, and 53BP1-, D2R-, and ChAT-immunohistochemistry was performed on brains harvested 6 h after injection of either haloperidol or vehicle. Immunohistochemistry for anti-phospho-\u03b3-H2A.X (Ser139) and phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) was performed on brains harvested 1 h after injection of either haloperidol or vehicle. After washing in PBS, sections were incubated with their respective secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for 1 h and washed 3\u00d7 with PBS. Sections were cover-slipped in mounting media with DAPI or TO-PRO-3 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Images were captured with a Zeiss 710 laser scanning confocal microscope using a 40\u00d7 oil objective with a numerical aperture of 1.3 and total magnification of 400\u00d7. TO-PRO-3 staining was used to identify MSNs and interneuron populations by their typical nuclear morphology (\nMatamales et al., 2009\n). Field of view (44,944 \u03bcm\n2\n) was calculated using a scale bar overlay as reference. For quantification of 53BP1 colocalization with ChAT interneurons, D2R iMSNs, and TUNEL labeling, an investigator blinded to genotype and treatment examined 12 microscopic fields derived from 4 coronal sections per mouse brain (\nn\n= 3 mice/group).\nColocalization analysis of phospho-H2A.X (Ser139)- and phospho-histone H3 (Ser10)-immunohistochemistry was performed using Imaris (Bitplane) object-based colocalization software. Spot size was set at 0.5 \u03bcm and spot detection was based on mean intensity sums for each channel. Spots \u2264 0.5 \u03bcm from one another were considered colocalized. Colocalization was based on a total of 12 microscopic fields derived from 4 coronal sections per mouse brain (\nn\n= 3 mice/group).\n\n2.6. Histone H3 phosporylation and cAMP ELISAs\nThe EpiQuik Global Histone H3 Phosphorylation (Ser10) ELISA (Epigentek, Farmingdale, NY) and cAMP ELISA (Cayman Chemical) kits were used to assess the phosphorylation of histone H3 (Ser10) and cAMP levels, respectively, at 10 months-of-age. In brief, mice were rapidly anesthetized with pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, IP) 1 h after injection of haloperidol or vehicle. Striata were dissected and homogenized in tissue extraction buffer for the quantification of histone H3 phosphorylation (Ser10) and cAMP levels. Results were expressed as % histone H3 phosphorylation (Ser10) compared to controls and pmols of cAMP/mg of protein, respectively.\n\n2.7. Global DNA methylation\nQuantification of global DNA methylation was performed using a commercially available MethylFlash Global DNA Methylation (5-mC) ELISA Easy Kit (Epigentek #P-1030). Genomic DNA was harvested from the striata of aged (18-month-old)\nGnal\n+/+\nand\nGnal\n+/\u2212\nmice using the Classic\u2122 Genomic DNA Isolation kit (Lamda Biotech, St. Louis, MO). For the quantification of 5-mC, 100ng of DNA was added to a 96-well plate, followed by incubation with primary (anti-5-mC) and secondary antibodies and developed by colorimetric methods. The data was represented as percentage of 5-mC in total DNA\n\n2.8. Golgi staining\nBrains of age-matched\nGnal\n+/\u2212\nand\nGnal\n+/+\nlittermates (\nn\n= 3/genotype, 18-months-old) were isolated and prepared according to standard Golgi\u2013Cox impregnation technique using the FD Rapid GolgiStain\u2122 Kit (FD NeuroTechnologies). Briefly, mice were rapidly anesthetized with pentobarbital and brains were quickly removed from the skull. After rinsing with water, brains were first immersed in the impregnation solution (A and B) which was replaced after 6 h and then kept in dark for 14 days with fresh impregnation solution. Afterwards, the brains were transferred to solution C overnight at room temperature. Serial cryostat sections of 100 \u03bcM were sagittally cut through both hemispheres of the mouse brain. Every first section of each series of 3 sections (interval: 300 \u03bcm) were mounted on gelatin-coated slides. Following staining in solutions D & E, sections were dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylenes and cover-slipped in Permount\n\u00ae\n(Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) for quantitative analysis. To assess dendritic morphology, low magnification images (\nZ\n-stack) of MSNs, were randomly selected using a bright field microscope. Images from\nGnal\n+/\u2212\nand\nGnal\n+/+\nmice brains were manually traced using Neurolucida system (MicroBrightField). Total dendritic length and soma size were measured with NeurolucidaExplorer (MicroBrightField). Scholl analysis was performed to analyze number of intersections per shell starting from the point at the centroid of the cell body. The density of spines was quantified by counting the number of spines on the terminal segment of dendrites. Morphologic data from 8neurons/mouse were averaged to provide a single data point for each animal.\n\n2.9. Quantification of heterochromatin and euchromatin levels with transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nGnal\n+/\u2212\nmice and\nGnal\n+/+\nlittermates at 18 months-of-age were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde/2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. Whole brains were extracted and the dorsolateral striata were processed for TEM. Briefly, tissue was washed in 0.1M sodium cacodylate and subsequently post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated with an ethanol series (50%, 70%, 90%, 95%, 100%), infiltrated using EmBed812 resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences), thin sectioned at 60 nm, and stained with UranyLess stain (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Grids were imaged on a JEOL-2000EX II TEM. Areas of heterochromatin were measured blindly using ImageJ threshold analysis and expressed as percent of nuclear area.\n\n2.10. Statistical analysis\nANOVA with Sidak's post-hoc multiple comparisons test was used to determine the effects of genotype and treatment on parametric behavioral, biochemical and morphological measures. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare treatment groups for a non-parametric behavioral measure (slips on the raised beam task) and Dunn's multiple comparisons test was used for pairwise post-hoc comparisons. Two-tailed\nt\n-tests were used to determine the effects of genotype on DNA methylation, TUNEL labeling, chromatin state, and biochemical measures. An alpha (\u03b1) of 0.05 was chosen for statistical significance."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nThe care and euthanasia of animals are in accordance with University of Colorado IACUC policy for animal use and the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\n2.2. Compounds\nPLX5622 and PLX3397 stock solutions were provided by Plexxikon Inc. at 20 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Mouse chows were formulated in AIN-76A standard chow by Research Diets Inc. at 1200 mg/kg for PLX5622 and 275 mg/kg for PLX3397.\n\n2.3. Cerebellar Slice Culture\nSagittal cerebellar slices (300\u03bcm) were prepared from PLP-eGFP mice (\nMallon et al., 2002\n) at P10-12 and cultured on MilliCell 0.4\u03bcm membrane inserts (Millipore, Billerica, MA) in slice media: 25% Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS), 25% heat-inactivated horse serum, 50% minimum essential media (MEM), 125mM HEPES, 28mM D-Glucose, 2mM L-Glutamine, 10U/ml penicillin/streptomycin, all from Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) at 37\u00b0C (\nSheridan and Dev, 2012\n). Media was changed within the first 24 h of plating, and then every 2-3 days. Slices were cultured for 7-10 days prior to treatment. DMSO, PLX5622 and PLX3397 were applied at indicated concentrations in slice media for 3 or 8 days. Media was changed every 2-3 days. Following treatment, slices were rinsed once in PBS, fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for 30 minutes, and subjected to immunostaining.\n\n2.4. Animal Chow Treatment\nMale and female PLP-eGFP animals (4-5 per group) aged 8-12 weeks were placed on formulated PLX Chow (1200 mg/kg for PLX5622 and 275 mg/kg for PLX3397) or standard diet for 7 or 21 days. Following treatment, animals were perfused with ice cold PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains and spinal cords were dissected, post-fixed overnight and then cryoprotected. Tissues were sectioned at 30um on a cryostat and collected in PBS for free-floating immunostaining.\n\n2.5. Immunostaining\nFor immunohistochemistry, explants or free-floating tissue sections were rinsed in PBS. For myelin proteins, tissues were permeabilized 10% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBSTx) for 20 min and then rinsed in PBS. Tissues are blocked with 5% normal donkey serum (NDS) in PBSTx (1%) for 1h, and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at room temperature. Following 3, 10 min washes in PBS, Alexa Fluor-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) were applied (1:800) 2h at room temperature, washed 3 times for 10 min in PBS, mounted on slides with water, dried and cover-slipped with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). The following primary antibodies were used: Rat anti-PLP 1:100 (\nYamamura et al., 1991\n), Rabbit anti-S100b 1:500 (Sigma, S2644), Rabbit anti-GFAP 1:1000 (Sigma, G9269), Goat anti-Iba1 1:400 (Abcam, ab5076), Guinea Pig anti-NG2 1:2000, Rabbit anti-NG2 1:2000, and Rabbit anti-PDGFRa 1:500 (Gifts from William Stallcup, Burnham Institute).\n\n2.6. Microscopy\nImages were acquired with either a Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) or Zeiss Axio-Imager epi-fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, NY). At least 4 sections from similar regions of each explant section, brain or spinal cord were imaged with identical settings.\n\n2.7. Purified Primary OPC Cell Culture\nPrimary murine OPC culture was prepared from PLP-eGFP pups as described (\nLiu et al., 2016\n). Briefly, mixed glial cultures were prepared from P0-1 dissociated cortices and plated on poly-D-lysine (Sigma) coated T75 flask. Purified OPC monocultures were prepared by shaking flasks of confluent mixed glial cultures overnight at 200 rpm to detach the OPCs. OPCs were plated on poly-D-lysine/laminin (Sigma) coated dishes and maintained in media containing 10 ng/ml PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor)/FGF (fibroblast growth factor) (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 24-48 h prior to experiments.\n\n2.8. IncuCyte Live Cell Imaging\nLive cell imaging was performed using IncuCyte Zoom from Essen BioScience (Ann Arbor, MI) as described (\nLiu et al., 2016\n). Cells were grown and scanned on 24-well plates in the cell culture incubator. Each well was scanned with a 10\u00d7 objective lens in 9 randomly selected positions at 15 min intervals with high definition phase contrast and epifluorescence microscopy using the 585/635 nm filter (red fluorescence, to detect the DRAQ7 dead cell nuclei; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Image processing and cell counting were performed using IncuCyte and ImageJ software.\n\n2.9. Quantification and Statistical Analysis\nConfocal and fluorescence microscope images were quantified manually with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health open source). For\nex vivo\ncerebellar slices, 2-3 images of folia were taken, quantified, and averaged. Slices from 3-4 independent experiments were analyzed. For\nin vivo\nchow experiments, at least 4 sections of brains and spinal cords were imaged in each region (cortex above hippocampus, midline corpus callosum, striatum, and cerebellum), quantified manually using ImageJ cell counter, and averaged. To quantify PLP fluorescence, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), area and integrated density of the signal were measured from a region of interest (ROI) in the corpus callosum and cortex, and from an area with no fluorescence (background) using ImageJ. The MFI of the signal was subtracted by the MFI of the background. The corrected total fluorescence (CTF) was calculated as follows: CTF = Integrated density \u2013 (MFI of the background \u00d7 Area of the signal) (\nLeite et al., 2014\n). Statistical analyses were performed by unpaired Student\u2019s\nt\ntest for single comparisons, one-way ANOVA, or two-way ANOVA for grouped comparisons using GraphPad Prism software. Data are expressed as means \u00b1 SD of independent experiments (n\u22653), Significance is reported for p<0.05."

    "Methods": "Traumatic Brain Injury\nAll surgical procedures were done in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Drexel University College of Medicine. On postnatal day 11, male and female Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington MA) were randomly assigned to either receive a closed head injury (N=53) or treated as sham-injured controls (N=45) as previously described (\nHanlon et al., 2017\n;\nRaghupathi and Huh, 2007\n). Animals were anesthetized using isoflurane (Patterson Veterinary, Greeley CO, 5% induction, 2-3% maintenance) and a 2cm incision was made to expose the skull and the periosteum was cleared. At 4 minutes after the start of anesthesia, animals were placed in plastic rodent restrainer (Braintree Scientific, Braintree MA), and moved to the stage of the electronic controlled cortical impact device (eCCI, Custom Design and Fabrication, Richmond VA). The piston tip (5mm silicone impactor tip) was zeroed over the left parietal cortex midway between the bregma and lambda sutures, the anesthesia was stopped and when the animal reacted to a tail pinch, the impactor was electrically driven 3mm into the intact skull at velocity of 5m/s (dwell time of 100ms). Following impact, animals were placed on their backs, the times to normal breathing (apnea) and right themselves (righting reflex) were recorded. Sham-injured animals were anesthetized and surgically prepared but did not receive an impact; following surgery, anesthesia was removed, and righting reflex was determined. Once animals righted themselves, they were re-anesthetized and the scalp was sutured shut. Animals recovered in a separate cage for at least 30 minutes before being placed back with the dam. Surgical procedures and recovery occurred on heating pads at 37\u00b0C to maintain the body temperature.\n\nClodronate Administration\nAt 24 hours after surgery/injury, sham- and brain-injured animals were randomly assigned to receive intracerebral injections of liposome-encapsulated clodronate (Clodrosome\u00ae 5mg/ml, N=23 sham-injured and 25 brain-injured) or empty liposomes containing phosphate-buffered saline (Encapsome\u00ae, N=22 sham-injured and 23 brain-injured). Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 1-2% maintenance), sutures were removed, the incision site was reopened, the skull was cleaned, and the animals were placed in a stereotactic head holder. A burr hole was drilled in the skull and a 10\u03bcL Hamilton\n\u00ae\n80000 1701N syringe was used to inject 10 microliters of the liposomal suspension (liposome size = 2 \u03bcm, Encapsula NanoSciences, Brentwood TN) into the cortex (coordinates: \u22121.5mm anterior-posterior (AP), 1.7mm medial-lateral (ML) and 1.7mm dorsal-ventral (DV)) and the thalamus (coordinates: \u22123.5mm AP, 1.7mm ML and 3.5mm DV) (Paxinos and Watson 3\nrd\nedition) at a rate of 1 \u03bcl/minute. Following surgery, animals recovered in a separate cage for at least 60 minutes before being placed back with the dam. Surgical procedures and recovery occurred on heating pads at 37\u00b0C to maintain the body temperature.\n\nHistology and Immunohistochemistry\nAnimals were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital (390mg/Kg, Euthasol\u00ae and Virbac, Fort Worth TX) and transcardially perfused with 10% formalin. Brains were removed and processed for histology and immunohistochemistry as previously described (\nHanlon et al., 2016\n;\nHanlon et al., 2017\n). Sections (40\u03bcm thick, 500\u03bcm apart) between +1 and \u22126mm relative to Bregma were mounted on gelatin-coated slides and stained for Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) or Nissl-myelin (2% Cresyl Violet and 0.2% Cyanine R) (\nHanlon et al., 2016\n). Additional sets of sections were evaluated for microglia using antibodies for anti-ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1, Wako, Richmond VA, 1:20,000, cat 019-19741) and CD68 (Clone ED1, BioRad/AbD Serotech, Hercules CA, 1:500, cat # MCA341), and traumatic axonal injury using a polyclonal antibody to the C-terminal end of amyloid precursor protein (APP, Zymed, San Francisco CA, 1:2,000, cat # PA1-84165). For anti-APP immunohistochemistry, antigen retrieval was executed by incubation with 10mM sodium citrate (pH 6.5) in a 60\u00b0C water bath for 20 minutes. Primary antibody binding was detected using biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove PA, 1:1000 for APP and 1:500 for Iba1, cat # 711-065-152) or biotinylated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove PA, 1:500 for ED-1, cat # 715-065-151). Antibody binding was visualized using the ABC Elite System with diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame CA, cat # SK-4100).\nQuantification in the cortex (layers 2 through 5 of the retrosplenial, motor and somatosensory cortices), hippocampus (dorsal subiculum) and thalamus (dorsolateral and lateral geniculate nuclei), and was conducted by counting labeled profiles (Iba1, ED-1, FJB) in 3-5 high power field (HPF) images (20x magnification) per section across 3-5 non-adjacent sections. ED-1(+) profiles were counted as separate phenotypes: amoeboid morphology (enlarged, rounded cells with few to no visible processes) and rod morphology (elongated cells with thick cell bodies and few to no visible processes). Counts of Iba1(+) profiles at the 15- and 35-day time points were based on the presence of a discernable cell body with elongated processes (resting) or an amoeboid appearance with no processes (activated); Iba1(+) cells were not counted at 3 days post-injury because in brains injected with empty liposomes the Iba-1 staining was very dense and precluded the ability to identify individual cells while all Iba-1(+) cells were depleted by clodronate. Amyloid precursor protein-labeled and FJB(+) profiles were quantified in the white matter and thalamus over 3-5 coronal sections as previously described (\nDiLeonardi et al., 2009\n;\nHanlon et al., 2016\n;\nHanlon et al., 2017\n). The extent of tissue loss within the cortex and thalamus was quantified over 3-5 Nissl-myelin stained coronal sections as previously described (\nRaghupathi and Huh, 2007\n); the intensity of staining was not a factor in outlining the areas to be measured into account. Data collection and analysis were performed by LAH and JWH who were blinded to the injury and treatment status of the samples.\n\nCortical Evoked Field Potential\nAnimals were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane, decapitated, and the brain was rapidly removed and placed in oxygenated (95% oxygen/5% carbon dioxide) ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing the following (in mM): sodium chloride 130, sodium bicarbonate 24, glucose 10, potassium chloride 3.5, sodium biphosphate 1.25, magnesium sulfate 1.5, calcium chloride 2). Coronal slices (450\u03bcm thick) at 1 - 1.2mm anterior (containing the forelimb motor cortex) and 3 \u2013 3.5mm posterior (containing the hindlimb motor cortex) to bregma were obtained using a Vibratome\u00ae (1000 Plus, St Louis MO). Slices were incubated in aCSF for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C and 30 minutes at room temperature and placed in a recording chamber where they were continuously bathed with fresh aCSF for the duration of recording. A bipolar, tungsten stimulating electrode (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota FL) was placed in layer 2 of the forelimb or hindlimb motor cortex and a pulled glass recording pipette filled with aCSF was placed in layer 5 of the same cortex (offset by approximately 300\u03bcm from the stimulating electrode). Potentials were evoked using constant current pulses (200\u03bcs duration) from a Master-8 pulse stimulator (A.M.P.I, Jerusalem Israel) at increasing intensities (manual current stepping from 0-1000\u03bcA) and recorded using an Axoclamp 2B amplifier. Slices from sham- and brain-injured animals reacted similarly to current input and demonstrated a plateau around 800\u03bcA, therefore all data were quantified at this current as the average of 5 sweeps. The amplitude of the signal was measured as the difference (in millivolts) between baseline and the middle of the primary peak and the latency of the signal was measured as the difference in time (in milliseconds) between the beginning of the stimulus artifact and the middle of the primary peak. All quantification was performed by LAH and RR who were blinded to the injury and treatment status of each animal.\n\nSpatial Learning and Memory\nSpatial learning was assessed on days 10-13 and 28-31 in separate groups of animals using the Morris water maze as previously described (\nHanlon et al., 2016\n;\nHanlon et al., 2017\n). Animals were trained over 4 days to find the location of the hidden platform submerged approximately 1cm below the surface of the water (20\u00b0C) as previously described (\nHanlon et al., 2016\n;\nHanlon et al., 2017\n). Animals were trained to locate the submerged platform over 4 trials on each of 4 days and the latency to find the platform was averaged across trials for each day. On the 5th day (probe trial), the platform was removed from the pool and the swimming pattern of each animal was tracked (AccuScan Instruments Inc, Columbus OH) for two 60-second trials to assess time spent in zones closest to or furthest from the original location of the platform. Following the probe trials, the platform was placed back in the water and the water level was lowered so that the top inch of the platform was exposed, and a flag was adhered to the top of the platform. The latency to locate the visible platform was recorded in one trial. Behavioral assessments were performed by LAH who was blinded to the injury and treatment status of the animals.\n\nStraight-path Swim Task\nAnimals were trained to swim the length of the 48\u201d aquarium in a straight path as previously described (\nStoltz et al., 1999\n). The water in the tank was maintained at 18-20\u00b0C and a cue rat was placed on the platform and a flag was adhered to the side of the platform to make sure the test rats could see the platform. On the training day, the tank was separated into quarters to form the 4 training release points at varying distances from the platform and animals were released from these points in order until they could swim the length of the tank in a straight path without turning or running into the sides. At 24 hours after training, animals were subjected to one acclimation trial released from the furthest point from the platform in order to familiarize them with the task followed by the test trials which were recorded for quantification. Animals were tested by cage and allowed to rest for 2 minutes between trials. Test trials were terminated when animals completed 3 straight-path runs without turning or running into the walls of the tank. Data is presented as the average number of strokes across 3 runs. Behavioral assessments were performed by LAH who was blinded to the injury and treatment status of the animals.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll statistics were performed using Statistica 7 (StatSoft, Tulsa OK). All data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean. Data were compared using a 3-way ANOVA (injury status, treatment status, time) or a 2-way ANOVA (injury status, treatment status) as necessary. Spatial learning latencies were compared using a 2-way (injury and treatment status) repeated measures ANOVA (days of training). The percent of tissue loss was compared between the brain-injured groups using the Student\u2019s t-test. When necessary, post-hoc analyses were performed using the Newman-Keuls test and a value of p\u22640.05 was considered significant. Sex was used as a covariate in all analyses."

    "Methods": "Chemicals\nHuman iPS-derived endothelial cells were purchased from Cellular Dynamics (Cat# ECM-100-030-001; from healthy donor). Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Bovine (BSA) and fetal bovine sera (FBS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The reagents and supplements required for western blotting were purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Total protein measurement\u2019s reagents with the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method were obtained from Pierce (Rockford, IL). All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and were readily available from commercial sources.\n\nAnimals\nBrains of 3\u20134 months old Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River, strain #400) were used for the isolation of microcapillaries using an equal ration of male:female brains. Rats were allowed easy access to water and food, and housed at 22 \u00b0C, 35% relative humidity and 12 h dark/light cycle. All experiments involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Thomas Jefferson University and all surgical procedures were consistent with the IACUC policies and procedures.\n\nCell cultures\nAstrocytes were differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from ALS patients of either SOD1-A4V, sporadic (procured by Dr. Nicholas Maragakis, Johns Hopkins University), or C9orf72 (Target ALS) genotype, and normal (non-ALS) human subjects (Control) (Cellular Dynamic, Cat. #R1092) (\nBoulting et al., 2011\n;\nFrakes et al., 2014b\n). Human iPS-derived astrocytes (two lines for control and for ALS genotype) were plated in 75T flasks pre-coated with 1% matrigel, cultured in 1:1 DMEM/F12 medium (supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% w/v nonessential amino acids, L-glutamine 2 mM, Heparin (2 mg/mL), 2% B27, and the antibiotics penicillin G (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL), and used at DIV 90\u2013100 when astrocytes robustly express markers characteristic of the astrocytic phenotype, such as GFAP, S100\u03b2 and the glutamate transporter EAAT1 (\nHaidet-Phillips et al., 2014\n). Human iPS-derived ECs (Cellular Dynamics, Cat# ECM-100-030-001), were plated in T-75 flasks pre-coated with 30\u03bcg/ml fibronectin, and cultured in VascuLife basal medium (Lifeline cell technology, MD) supplemented with 5 ng/mL rh FGF basic, 50 mg/mL ascorbic acid, 1 mg/mL hydrocortisone sulfate, 10 mM L-glutamine, 15 ng/mL rh IGF-1, 5 ng/mL rh EGF, 5 ng/mL rh VEGF, 0.75 IU/mL heparin sulfate, penicillin G (100IU/ml), streptomycin (100\u03bcg/ml), and 10% iCell endothelial cells medium supplement (Cellular Dynamics).\n\nTreatment with astrocyte-conditioned media\nHuman iPS-derived astrocytes were allowed to reach ~80% confluency at which point culture medium was replaced with fresh medium and the cells further cultured for 72 h. Astrocyte conditioned media (ACM) were collected at this DIV from three cultures (SOD1-A4V, sporadic, and control) centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes to remove debris and floating cells, and stored in aliquots at \u221280\u00b0C. Human iPS-derived ECs were cultured in 24-well plates to reach ~80% confluency, then the cells were treated with 0.5 ml of ACM for 30 min. ACM was completely replaced with glutamate-free medium and cells were further kept in culture for additional 24 hours. For inhibition studies, cells were pre-treated for 15 min. with inhibitors (1\u03bcM MK801, 5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine (dizocilpine maleate), a non-competitive antagonist of the glutamate receptor N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDA), 1\u03bcM celecoxib, a selective cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) antagonist). The inhibitors were further added during the ACM incubation period of for 30 minutes.\n\nBrain capillary isolation\nFreshly isolated rat brain hemispheres were cleared from the meninges and choroid plexus and immediately homogenized in ice-cold D-PBS (2.7 mM KCl, 1.46 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 136.9 mM NaCl, 8.1 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.9 mM CaCl\n2\n, and 0.5 mM MgCl\n2\nsupplemented with 5 mM D-glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, pH 7.4), containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Cat. #78438, Thermoscientific). Brain capillaries (microvessels) were isolated as described previously with some modifications (\nMohamed et al., 2016\n;\nQosa et al., 2016a\n). Briefly, after homogenization of brain hemispheres in D-PBS, the homogenate was mixed 1:1 with 30% Ficoll and centrifuged at 5800\u00d7g for 15 min. at 4 \u00b0C. Supernatant was discarded and pellet containing microvessels was gently resuspended in ice-cold D-PBS containing 1% BSA and passed through a column packed with glass beads. Microvessels adhered to the glass beads were collected by gentle shaking into BSA-free D-PBS followed by centrifugation at 5800\u00d7g for 5 min. at 4 \u00b0C. Pelleted microvessels of both brain and spinal cord were separately mixed with 2% matrigel containing media, incubated in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO\n2\n/95% air) at 37 \u00b0C for 1h and used immediately for P-gp transport activity studies, as described below.\n\nP-glycoprotein transport activity:\nIn vitro permeability studies\nHuman iPS-derived astrocytes (from normal or ALS subjects) were cultured in 24-well plates. Human iPS-derived ECs were grown as monolayers by culturing the cells (50,000 cells/cm\n2\n) on 24-transwell polyester membrane inserts (0.4 \u03bcm pores; Corning, NY) pre-coated with 60 \u03bcg/mL of fibronectin solution prepared in distilled water. After 2 days of culture, inserts then were placed on top of the astrocyte layer and incubated for 72 h at 37\u00b0C. Human iPS-derived ECs were used between passages 2 and 5 (Lippmann et al., 2012). Another set of iPS-derived ECs, to be used for ACM treatment, were cultured alone on inserts for 6 days until they form a continuous monolayer. Subsequently, cells were treated with ACM from either iPS-derived astrocytes from ALS patients of different genotypes or normal subject for 30 min. followed by replacement with fresh medium and further cultured for 5.5 h. For NMDA receptor inhibition, cells were treated with MK801 (1 \u03bcM) for 15 min. before addition of ACM and during its incubation for 30 min. Subsequently, EC monolayers either from co-culture or ACM-treated cells were used for P-gp transport assays. Endothelial cell monolayers on inserts were treated for 60 min with LD800 (50 \u03bcM), a P-gp fluorescent specific substrate, and NaF (50\u03bcM), a paracellular permeability marker, dissolved in culture media. The aforementioned treatments were applied to the basolateral side (B, lower chamber, representative of the brain side) to initiate basolateral to apical (A, upper chamber, representative of blood side) transport (B\u2192A). At the end of treatment, transport was ended by separation of inserts from their wells and aliquots were taken from both apical and basolateral sides for analysis. Transport quotient (TQ) of LD800 from B\u2192A was calculated using the following equation:\nL\nD\n800\nT\nQ\n=\n(\nL\nD\n800\n(\na\np\ni\nc\na\nl\n)\n)\n/\n(\nL\nD\n800\n(\nt\no\nt\na\nl\n)\n)\n(\nN\na\nF\n(\na\np\ni\nc\na\nl\n)\n)\n/\n(\nN\na\nF\n(\nt\no\nt\na\nl\n)\n)\nEquation 1\nWhere LD800\n(total)\nis the sum of LD800 in the apical and basolateral compartments, and NaF\n(total)\nis the sum of NaF in the apical and basolateral compartments.\nIsolated capillary transport assay\nTo assess P-gp function in isolated brain capillaries, we used a confocal microscopy-based transport assay, which have been described previously (\nHartz et al., 2004\n;\nJablonski et al., 2012\n). Isolated capillaries were placed on cover-slips coated with 2% matrigel, which was placed on glass slides at the end of transport experiment for microscopic analysis. First, isolated capillaries were exposed for 30 min to ACM/SOD1-A4V or ACM/sporadic, then replaced with fresh media and incubated for additional 5.5 h. For inhibition studies, isolated capillaries were pretreated for 15 min with inhibitors (1\u03bcM MK801 or 1\u03bcM celecoxib), then ACM was added together with the inhibitor for the designated time period mentioned earlier. Subsequently, transport assay was initiated by incubating capillaries with fluorescent P-gp substrate, NBD-CSA, and luminal substrate accumulation was measured 1\u2009hour later. To acquire images, the slides containing capillaries were mounted on the stage of an inverted Olympus Fluoview 1000 Confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, PA) and imaged using a \u00d7 40 objective and a 488-nm laser line for NBD-CSA. Captured images were analyzed for the luminal accumulation of the fluorescence NBD-CSA by Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Data are presented as arbitrary fluorescence units from 6\u20138 images.\n\nWestern Blot analysis\nSpinal cord autopsy samples from control and ALS patients (sporadic, SOD1-AV4 and C9orf72; Target ALS tissue sample ID: #103 Control, #90 sporadic, #43 SOD1, #16 C9orf72) were obtained from Target ALS tissue bank. Spinal cord tissue (~100 mg) was homogenized in 1 ml of RIPA buffer in the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail (Cat. #78438,Thermoscientific), centrifuged at 1000\u00d7g for 10 min at room temperature and the supernatant was used to prepare the samples for Western blot analysis. 25 \u03bcg of total protein for each sample group were run on 4\u201312% stain-free gel (Bio-rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using turbo-blot semi transfer system (Bio-rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% BSA in PBST for an hour at room temperature followed by incubation with primary antibodies overnight, followed by incubation with corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1 hour, room temperature). Membrane was developed by chemiluminescence and bands were visualized using a Chemidoc\u2122 one touch system (BIO-RAD; Hercules, CA), and quantified by densitometric analysis.\nHuman iPS-derived endothelial cells were collected in 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 2,000g for 10min at 4\u00b0C. Cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors cocktail. Supernatants were stored at \u221280\u00b0C for subsequent western blot analyses. Next, 25\u03bcg of protein samples was loaded 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel cassette and resolved at 140V for 1.5h and transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes at 300 mA for 3h. Membranes were blocked with 2% BSA blocking solution prepared in PBS for 1h at room temperature, followed by addition of primary mouse monoclonal antibodies for P-gp (BioLegend Cat# 901401, clone C-219, 1:50 dilution, RRID:AB_2565004) and GAPDH (Fitzgerald 1:20,000 dilution; Cat# 10R-G109a, RRID:AB_1285808), and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Membranes then washed three times and incubated into secondary antibodies; horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody for P-gp and GAPDH. Protein blots were developed using a chemiluminescence detection kit (SuperSignal West Femto substrate; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Bands were visualized using a Bio-Rad chemidoc TM one touch system (BIORAD; Hercules, CA), and quantified by densitometric analysis.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nCells were washed with PBS twice and fixed for 10min in PBS solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose, and permeabilized with 0.25% triton-100\u00d7 for another 10min at room temperature. After washing 3 times with PBS, cells were blocked with 10% horse serum for 1h at room temperature. Next, cells were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies prepared in 10% blocking solution containing 0.1% tween-20. Primary antibodies used including mouse monoclonal P-gp antibody C219 (Covance; MA) at 1:50 dilution, and rabbit monoclonal NF\n\u03ba\nB antibody (Abcam, MA) at 1:100 dilution. Subsequently cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1h at room temperature with secondary antibodies either Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#\nR37114\n, RRID:AB_2556542) or Alexa Fluor 546 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A10040, RRID:AB_2534016) at 1:200 dilutions followed by washing cells three times with PBS. Transwell membranes were collected and mounted with Prolong Gold DAPI antifade solution (Life technologies, CA) and images were captured using Olympus Fluoview 1000 Confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, PA) at a total magnification of 400\u00d7. Total signal of P-gp was quantified using NIH ImageJ version 1.44 software as described previously (Noursadeghi et al., 2008).\n\nGlutamate release measurement in cell culture\nGlutamate level in ACM from either human iPS astrocytes derived from the control subject or ALS patients (Sporadic and familial) were measured using Amplex Red Glutamic acid assay kit (Invitrogen). According to manufacturer instructions, glutamate levels in ACM were measured fluoremetrically using BMG LABTECH POLARstar-plate reader (BMG LABTECH Inc., NC). Data were normalized to protein content and converted to concentration by comparison to standard glutamate solution.\n\nFluorescence spectrophotometric measurement of [Ca\n2+\n] in iPS endothelial cells treated with astrocyte conditioned media (ACM)\nIntracellular level of calcium was monitored by measuring the change in the fluorescence intensity of Fluo-4-loaded cells (\nJohnson et al., 2002\n). First, human iPS-derived endothelial cells was cultured on 96-well plates and allowed to reach confluence. Then, cells were treated with 200\u03bcl of standard HBSS buffer containing 2.5\u03bcM Fluo-4, AM and Pluronic F-27 and incubated in the dark for 1h at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, cells were washed three times with HBSS and incubated for another 2h in media. Calcium response was measured by monitoring a baseline fluorescence of cells loaded with Fluo-4, AM alone for 5min, followed by addition of ACM alone or with NMDA receptor antagonist, 5\u03bcM MK801 and measurement was continued for 45 min at 37\u00b0C. Fluorescence was measured in a plate spectrofluorimeter, BMG LABTECH POLARstar-plate reader (BMG LABTECH Inc., NC), at 37\u00b0C with excitation and emission wavelengths at 494 and 506 nm, respectively.\n\nStatistical analysis\nUnless otherwise indicated, all data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Data were statistically analyzed for significant difference; for comparison between two groups, unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test were used, while for comparison between more than two groups one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett\u2019s post-hoc test were used. A P-value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "2.1. Cohorts\nGenetic, clinical, and cognitive data were extracted from two large-scale population-based cohorts: the Generation Scotland: The Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) and the UK Biobank.\n2.1.1. Generation Scotland: the Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS)\nThe GS:SFHS (\nwww.generationscotland.co.uk\n) is a family- and population-based study consisting of 23,690 participants recruited through 125 general medical practices across Scotland (\nSmith et al., 2006\n;\nSmith et al., 2013\n). Genome-wide genotyping data, depression status and measures of logical memory, digit symbol coding, verbal fluency, and verbal intelligence were available for 19,994 individuals (11,773 females) aged 18\u201399\u202fyears (mean age\u202f=\u202f47.41\u202fyears, SD\u202f=\u202f14.98) (\nHagenaars et al., 2016\n;\nMarioni et al., 2016\n;\nSmith et al., 2013\n;\nZeng et al., 2016\n). A broad definition of depression was based on participants' responses to a single question as to whether they had ever been affected with depression (\nZeng et al., 2016\n). The prevalence of self-reported lifetime depression in this sample was 10%. Cognition was assessed using the logical memory and digit symbol coding subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale III (\nWechsler, 1997\n), the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) (\nBenton and Hamsher, 1976\n) and the Mill Hill vocabulary test for senior and junior synonyms combined (\nRaven, 1958\n), a test designed to measure verbal intelligence. The quality control processes relating to the genetic, clinical and cognitive data have been described in full elsewhere (\nSmith et al., 2013\n;\nZeng et al., 2016\n). Ethical approval for GS:SFHS was granted by the Tayside Research Ethics Committee (reference 05/S1401/89). All participants provided written informed consent.\n2.1.2. UK Biobank\nThe UK Biobank (\nwww.ukbiobank.ac.uk\n) is a population-based cohort that has detailed health information and biological measures for 501,726 individuals recruited from across the UK (\nBycroft et al., 2018\n). The genetic and phenotypic data used in the current study were available for 331,374 unrelated individuals (177,775 females) aged 39\u201373\u202fyears (mean age\u202f=\u202f57.2\u202fyears, SD\u202f=\u202f8.1). Individuals with probable Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were self-identified based on responses to questions about current and lifetime symptoms and diagnosis of depression (\nHoward et al., 2018\n). The prevalence of this depression phenotype was 17.4%. Cognitive function was measured using the symbol digit substitution score (UK Biobank Field ID 20159), reaction time (UK Biobank Field ID 20023), numeric memory score (UK Biobank Field ID 20240), and trail making test (mean of UK Biobank Fields 20,156 and 20,157). Detailed information regarding the depression and cognitive variables available within UK Biobank has been published previously (\nHagenaars et al., 2016\n;\nHoward et al., 2018\n). The quality control processes relating to the data analysed here have also been described in detail elsewhere (\nHoward et al., 2018\n;\nLuciano et al., 2018\n). The UK Biobank study was approved by the National Health Service Research Ethics Service (approval letter dated 17th June 2011, reference: 11/NW/0382). The analyses presented here were conducted under UK Biobank application 4844.\n\n2.2. Insulin-resistance related traits\nThe euglycemic insulin clamp (\nMatsuda and DeFronzo, 1999\n) and the glucose tolerance tests (\nBergman et al., 1987\n) are considered the gold standard methods for the measurement of INS-R in research, but their use is cumbersome in clinical practice and infeasible in large, population-based research studies. Here we consider three reliable surrogate measures: fasting insulin (\nLaakso, 1993\n), fasting glucose and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (\nMatthews et al., 1985\n), which is based on the dynamic relationship between fasting glucose and corresponding insulin levels. We considered four further traits, HDL cholesterol, Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol, which are components of dyslipidaemia associated with INS-R (\nLi et al., 2014\n). In total, we focus on seven, genetically overlapping traits, three representing changes in glycaemic control and four representing dyslipidaemia (\nBulik-Sullivan et al., 2015\n).\n\n2.3. Computation of polygenic risk scores in the GS:SFHS\nPleiotropy reflects the overlap between the genetic architecture of two or more traits (\nSolovieff et al., 2013\n) and can be assessed using data from single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Polygenic profile scoring (\nPurcell et al., 2009\n) uses summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to test whether genetic liability to a particular trait is associated with another phenotype. Here we examined whether genetic liability, expressed as Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS), to the seven INS-R traits described above, is associated with the measures of cognition and depression available in 19,994 individuals from the GS:SFHS. Specifically, polygenic risk scores were based on GWAS results for HOMA-IR (\nDupuis et al., 2010\n), fasting glucose (\nDupuis et al., 2010\n), fasting insulin (\nDupuis et al., 2010\n), HDL cholesterol (\nWiller et al., 2013\n), Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (\nWiller et al., 2013\n), triglycerides (\nWiller et al., 2013\n) and total cholesterol (\nWiller et al., 2013\n). Quality controlled autosomal SNPs in GS:SFHS were entered in PRSice v1.25 (\nEuesden et al., 2015\n) to compute the PRS of each trait at five SNP set\nP\n-value threshold cutoffs of \u22640.01,\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05,\u202f\u2264\u202f0.1,\u202f\u2264\u202f0.5 and\u202f\u2264\u202f1 from the corresponding GWAS summary statistics.\n\n2.4. Statistical analyses\n2.4.1. Polygenic risk score analyses in the GS:SFHS\nWe implemented mixed linear model analyses in ASReml-R, to test the association between the PRS of the seven INS-R related traits to cognition and depression in the GS:SFHS; age, sex, the first four multi-dimensional scaling components to control population stratification, and each of the PRS in turn were fitted as fixed effects. To control for relatedness in the sample, the pedigree structure was fitted as a random effect by creating the inverse of a relationship matrix using pedigree kinship information.\nP\n-values for fixed effects fitted in the model were calculated using Wald's conditional F-test. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, the threshold of significance for the five SNP sets (corresponding to the 5 threshold cut-offs) and the seven INS-R related traits was set at\nP\n<\u202f1.4\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\n\u22123\n[0.05/(5\u202f\u00d7\u202f7)].\nWe note that\nRichardson et al. (2019)\nhave already published a detailed atlas of the associations between multiple PRS with numerous diverse traits in the UK Biobank, including those of interest to this paper.\n2.4.2. Mendelian randomization in the GS:SFHS and UK Biobank\nMR exploits the random assignment of genotypes at birth and their stability throughout the lifetime to overcome limitations relating to residual confounding (measured or unmeasured) and reverse causation (\nBowden et al., 2015\n;\nDavey Smith and Hemani, 2014\n;\nSmith and Ebrahim, 2004\n). MR analyses use genetic variants to assess causal relationships between exposures (here INS-R related traits) and outcomes (here depression and cognition) (\nFig. 1\n). MR analyses were conducted separately in the GS:SFHS and UK Biobank. As instrumental variables for INS-R we used the 53 SNPs (Supplementary Table S1) defined by Lotta and colleagues (\nLotta et al., 2017\n). Lotta and colleagues used all SNPs independently-associated with higher fasting insulin adjusted for body mass index [from up to 108,557 participants of the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC;\nhttps://www.magicinvestigators.org\n)] and lower HDL cholesterol and higher triglycerides [from up to 188,577 participants of Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC;\nhttp://lipidgenetics.org\n)]. For fasting glucose, fasting insulin, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol we used significant GWAS hits available in the MR-Base GWAS catalogue (\nHemani et al., 2018\n) (detailed in Supplementary Table S2). Depression and cognitive measures, as defined in 2.1, were used as outcome variables. All two-sample MR analyses were performed using the MR-Base R package (\u201cTwoSampleMR\u201d) version 0.4.8 (\nhttps://github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR\n) using inverse variance weighted (IVW) method and MR-Egger intercept tests. The IVW method is based on a regression of the exposure and outcome genetic variant vectors with the intercept constrained to zero, as described by Burgess and colleagues (\nBurgess et al., 2013\n). In total, 10 two-sample MR tests were performed and the threshold for significance was set at\nP\n<\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\n\u22123\n(0.05/10) following Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nModel for two-sample Mendelian randomization study. Mendelian randomization can be used to test if the exposure (insulin resistance) causally influences the outcome (depression and cognition) by using instrumental genetic variables (genome-wide significant SNPs) associated with the exposure that are unrelated to potential confounders and only affect the outcome via the exposure."

    "Methods": "Mice lines\nAll animal experiments were performed according to the Washington University animal study guidelines. Animals used in this study include adult and early postnatal Sprague Dawley rats, adult C57Bl/6 mice, adult TSC2 floxed mice (floxed allele; RRID:MGI:3712786) (\nHernandez et al., 2007\n), and adult Raptor floxed mice (floxed allele, MGI:3829755) (\nPolak et al., 2008\n).\n\nAdeno Associated vectors and virus\nAdenoassociated vector plasmid pscAAV-GFP (\nGray and Zolotukhin, 2011\n) used to generate AAV2-GFP virus was obtained from Addgene (Plasmid #32396). For HDAC5 vector plasmids, GFP from the pscAAV-GFP vector was substituted by the FLAG-HDAC5\nWT\n, FLAG-HDAC5\nAA\n, or FLAG-HDAC5\nDAD\n. The CMV promoter was used in all AAV vectors - based manipulation in this study. AAV2 viral particles were generated by the Viral Core of Washington University. AAV2-Cre was purchased from the viral core of University of North Carolina. Viral titer ranged between 5 \u00d7 10^12 vg/mL to 1 \u00d7 10^13 vg/mL.\n\nRetinal Ganglion Cell purification (adult and early postnatal) and culture\nSprague-Dawley early post\u2013natal pups (P2\u2013P3) rats were anesthetized by hypothermia and euthanized by decapitation with surgical scissors. Briefly, retinas were dissociated using 16.5 units/mL papain (Worthington) for 30 minutes. Next, RGCs were purified by immunopanning using antibodies against Anti-Rat Macrophage Polyclonal Antibody (Accurate Chemical) and Thy1 (T11D7 from ATCC), as previously described (\nTrakhtenberg et al., 2017\n). RGCs were either lysed with Cytoplasm Extraction buffer (CER) from the nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation kit (see below) containing protease inhibitors (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). In other experiments, purified RGCs were incubated in an Eppendorf containing 1ml of media with DMSO, 100\u03bcM of KN-62 (Tocris) and CID755673 (Tocris), or 5 \u03bcM I3A (Fisher). After 8 hours incubation at 37\u00b0C in rotation, cells were centrifuged and lysed in 80 \u03bcL of Cell Lysis buffer (CST) plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors. For some experiments, RGCs were plated on 35 mm tissue culture plates (Falcon) pre coated with poly-D-lysine (PDL; 10 mg/mL; Sigma) and laminin (1 mg/mL; Life Technologies). RGCs were cultured in defined growth medium consisting of Neurobasal media (Life Technologies) supplemented with sodium pyruvate, N-acetyl cysteine, insulin, BDNF, CNTF, and GS21 supplement medium. In some experiments, forskolin (5\u03bcM; Sigma) or leptomycin (20ng/mL; Sigma) was added to the medium, and after 24 hours cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed in 100 \u03bcL of Cell Lysis buffer (CST), using a cell scraper (Falcon). For immunostaining, RGCs were plated glass bottom dishes (MatTek) also coated with poly-D-lysine and laminin. After 24 hours, cells were fixed for 30 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde in the same plate followed by three PBS washes.\n\nAdult Skeletal Muscle cell purification\nAdult Skeletal Muscle Myofibers were purified as previously described (\nPasut et al., 2013\n). Briefly, Extensor Digitorum Longus muscle of adult mice was dissected and incubated in 1.5 mg/mL collagenase (C6885; Sigma) in DMEM until the muscle starts to loosen up. Then digested muscle is transferred to a new dish where tissue is flushed with warm medium until myofibers are released from the muscle. Using a pipette, myofibers are transferred to a 1.5 mL tube and centrifuged at low speed. The supernatant was discarded and nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation was performed.\n\nRodent Surgeries\nAll surgical procedures were performed under isofluorane anesthesia and approved by Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine Animal Studies Committee. Intravitreal injection was performed as previously described with minor modifications (\nSteketee and Goldberg, 2012\n). One drop of atropine solution (1%; Akorn) was applied topically to dilate the pupils. A fine tip of pulled glass micropipette was attached to a Hamilton syringe using a needle compression fitting (55750-01; Hamilton), and loaded with 1.25 \u03bcL of adeno-associated virus (AAV2) or 594 fluorescently labeled cholera toxin B (Life Technologies). The tip was then inserted through the sclera with a 45\u00b0 angle and the solution was slowly released in the vitreal space.\nOptic nerve crushed was performed as previously described with minor modifications (\nBan et al., 2017\n). Investigator performing the surgery was blinded to the treatments. One hour before surgery, Buprenorphine (1.0 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously. Animals were then anesthetized with isofluorane and 5% Sodium Chloride eye drops were applied preoperatively to protect the cornea during surgery. Left optic nerve was exposed intraorbitally and crushed with sterile jeweler\u2019s forceps for 3 seconds around 1 mm behind the optic disc. To preserve the retinal blood supply, care was taken not to damage the underlying ophthalmic artery. The endpoint of this surgery was between 1 and 28 days.\nIn some experiments, eye tissues were harvested for biochemical purposes. After sacrificing the animal, the eye together with the proximal part of the optic nerve was dissected out. Retina was extracted by cutting out the sclera and the cornea. The proximal part to the injury site was also resected. Tissue was then transferred to a 1.5 mL tube containing 80 \u03bcL of either Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) or CER buffer plus protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche), and homogenized using disposable pestles and a pestle motor (Kontes).\nIn another set of experiments, rapamycin was prepared according to Chen et al. (\nChen et al., 2009\n). Briefly, Rapamycin (LC Laboratories) was resuspended in ethanol at 50 mg/mL and then diluted in 5% Tween-80 (Sigma) and 5% PEG-400 (Sigma) to a working solution of 1 mg/mL. Mice received 6 mg/kg every other day by intraperitoneal injection. Vehicle solution without rapamycin was injected in control animals.\n\nNuclear/Cytoplasmic fractionation\nNuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation was performed using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Thermo Scientific). Briefly, homogenized purified cells or dissected retinas in CER buffer were vortexed for 10 seconds and centrifuged at 12,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes. Supernatant was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C while the pellet was washed once with PBS and then resuspended in Nuclear Extraction buffer or RIPA buffer to extract nuclear proteins.\n\nImmunoprecipitation\nImmunoprecipitation was performed using anti-flag antibody attached to protein G beads. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions obtained from one retina were diluted three times with water/0.02% tween and PBS/0.02% tween respectively. Next, ten \u03bcL of anti-flag beads were resuspended in each of these samples, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in a rotary shaker. Beads were separated using a magnet and washed three times with PBS/0.02% tween, transferred to a new tube, and boiled in 1\u00d7 Laemmli Buffer for 5 minutes. Beads were discarded and the supernatant was loaded in an electrophoresis followed by a western blot.\n\nElectrophoresis and western blot\nFor Western blot, 5\u00d7 SDS loading buffer, prepared according to Cold Spring Harbor protocols, was added to samples. These samples were heated at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes and after cooling down on ice were run in on 8-16% NuPAGE SDS-PAGE gradient gel (Life Technologies) in MOPS SDS Running Buffer (Life Technologies), transferred to 0.2 \u03bcm nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham). Next, these membranes were blocked in 3% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20 at pH 7.6 for 1 hour, incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight in blocking buffer with 1:1000 primary antibodies, monoclonal anti-HDAC5 antibody (H4538; Sigma), monoclonal anti-phosphorylated (Ser 498) HDAC5 (sc101692; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-HDAC3 antibody (sc11417; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-Histone3 antibody (9715S; CST), rabbit anti-GAPDH antibody GAPDH (sc25778, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-Phospho-PKC\u03bc Ser916 (2051S; CST), rabbit anti-PKC\u03bc (2052S; CST), rabbit anti-phospho-c-Jun antibody (9261s; CST), goat anti-Brn3a (sc-31984; Santa Cruz), and rabbit anti-\u03b23 tubulin antibody (PRB-435P, Covance). Membranes were then washed in TBST 3 times, incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:5000; Invitrogen) for 1 hour at room temperature, washed in TBST three times, and membrane was developed with SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific). The membranes were imaged using ChemiDoc System (Bio Rad) and analyzed with ImageLab software\n\nPerfusion and cryostat sectioning\nMice were sacrificed by CO\n2\nasphyxiation and then perfused with 15 mL of PBS followed by 15 mL of paraformaldehyde 4%. Eyes and optic nerve were dissected out and an incision was made in the cornea. These tissues were then fixed for 3 h in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed 3 times in PBS, and incubated in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight. Optic nerves were separated from the retina using spring scissors, embedded in tissue tek and directly sectioned at 11 \u03bcm in a Cryostat. Eyes were embedded in tissue-tek and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C, and then sectioned at 11 \u03bcm thickness. Cryosections were always mounted on Superfrost Plus micro slides (Fisherbrand).\n\nImmunohistochemistry and analysis\nCryosections or fixed cells were blocked with 20% goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hour. Next, these sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in the same buffer containing primary antibodies goat anti-Brn3a (sc-31984; Santa Cruz) or monoclonal (sc-8429; Santa Cruz) antibody, rabbit anti-pS6 (Ser240/244) antibody (5364S; CST), rabbit anti-\u03b23 tubulin antibody (PRB-435P, Covance). Then, samples were washed 3 times in PBS, incubated 2 hours at 4\u00b0C with DAPI (1:3,000, Life Technologies) and Alexa fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500, Life Technologies), washed three times in PBS and mounted in ProLong Gold (\nP36934\n, Life Technologies) with a glass coverslip. Last, samples were imaged using a Nikon TE-2000E fluorescence microscope and analyzed in FIJI (NIH). For survival analysis, investigator performing the quantification was blinded to the treatments. Number of Brn3a\n+\ncells per section were counted and normalized to the total distance of the RGC layer in that section. Three to four sections per retina were counted. For optic nerve regeneration analysis, investigator performing the quantification was blinded to the treatments. Lines at 250, 500, 750 and 1000 \u03bcm were drawn using FIJI, and the number of CTXB\n+\nsegments contacting the lines were counted. Three to four sections were averaged to obtain the average number of regenerating axons/mm. The number of regenerating axons was estimated using the formula previously described (\nPark et al., 2008\n) with minor modifications: 2\u03c0 \u00d7 optic nerve radius \u00d7 [average axons/\u03bcm]/11.\n\nRNA-seq\nTo isolate the RNA for sequencing, retinas were dissected from four female C57BI/6J per condition, and homogenized in 300 \u03bcl lysis buffer using disposable pestles attached to a motor. RNA was purified using the PureLink RNA Mini kit with on column DNase treatment and submitted to Washington University Genome Technology Access Center for quality control, library preparation, and sequencing. Briefly, RNA was quality controlled and quantified using both a Nanodrop 2000 and an Agilent Bioanalyzer; all samples passed quality control (RIN > 8, A260/268 > 2). Next, rRNA was depleted using a Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit, cDNA libraries were generated using a Clontech SMARTer kit, and libraries were sequenced on an Iliumina HiSeq3000 using 1\u00d750 lanes. Quality control was then performed on fastq files using FastQC and reads aligned to mm10 using STAR-align. Next, aligned reads were counted using HTseq-count and differential expression determined using DESeq2. Genes with fewer than an average of 5 counts per million were removed from the analysis. RNA-seq FastQ files were deposited at the NCBI GEO database (\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n). Accession number\nGSE120257\n.\n\nExperimental Design and Statistical Analysis\nIn the experiments where Western blot statistical analysis was performed, at least three female C57BL/6J mice or female Sprague Dawley rats were used per condition. Bands were quantified using Image Lab software and One-way ANOVA analysis was performed using Statistica 7 software.\nFor optic regeneration assay experiments, four to seven C57BL/6J female mice were used per condition in each experiment. However, in the experiments performed in TSC2floxed mice the number of animals was reduced to three and four per condition and mice were used regardless of their sex. The reason was that littermates were preferred in this experiment to reduce variability and therefore the litter size of this particular mice line was a limiting factor. In experiments comparing different HDAC5 mutants, four experiments performed on different days were combined. In each of these experiments, an AAV-GFP control was always included. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc analysis was performed using Statistica 7 software, similar to previously reported (\nParket al., 2008\n). In the\nin vivo\nRGC survival assay and in the quantifications of the percentage of pS6\n+\nRGCs, five C57BL/6J female mice were used per condition. One-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post hoc test analysis was performed using Statistica 7 software similarly to previously reported (\nLi et al., 2016\n).\nFor RNAseq, principal component analysis was then performed to detect outliers. Due to this, one of the GFP samples was removed. A cutoff of a p-adjusted value of 0.1 was used to identify differentially expressed genes. Downstream analysis of biological and signaling pathways was performed using MetaCore using a p-value of 0.05 to determine enriched pathways."

    "Methods": "The experimental procedures in this study were performed after approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of Brown University and of Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island. All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guide (NIH #8023, 1978) for the care and use of laboratory animals.\n\n2.1. Animal preparation, surgical procedures, experimental design, and autopsies\nPregnant Wistar rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA) on embryonic day 15 or 16, and housed in a temperature-controlled, 12-h light/dark-cycled facility with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water in the Animal Care Facility at Brown University. The dates upon which the rat pups delivered were confirmed and designated as P0. Litters were culled to a maximum of 10 pups on P1 such that there were as close to equal numbers of male and female pups as possible. On P7, the litters were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Sham-operated controls (Sham), HI placebo-treated (HI-PL), or HI IAIP-treated (HI-IAIP). The sex of each subject was recorded.\nThe Rice-Vannucci method for the induction of HI was performed on P7 rats, which has been previously described in detail (\nRice, et al., 1981\n). Briefly, the P7 rats were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and maintained with 2% isoflurane during the surgical procedure. Body temperature was maintained at 36\u00b0C during surgery with a heating pad. The right common carotid artery was separated from the trachea and adjacent nerves, and double ligated with 5-0 silk sutures via a 0.5-1 cm vertical midline incision on the neck in the HI-PL and HI-IAIP groups. In the Sham group, an equivalent incision was made on the neck, but the right common carotid artery was not ligated. The incision was closed, and each subject was marked with tail ink injections for identification (Neo-9, Animal Identification & Marking Systems, Inc., Hornell, NY, USA) and then returned to the dam for recovery from surgery. The neonatal rats remained with the dams for 1.5\u20133 h, after which the pups were placed in a hypoxia chamber (Biospherix, Parish, NY, USA) with 8% humidified oxygen and balanced nitrogen for 90 min (\nFig. 1\n). The HI-PL and HI-IAIP subjects were monitored every 10 min during hypoxia, and body temperature was maintained at 36\u00b0C throughout the hypoxic exposure (\nOsredkar, et al., 2014\n). Sham subjects were placed in a similar container and remained in room air for 90 min.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nStudy design. (A) The pups were returned to the dams for 1.5 to 3 h after right common carotid artery ligation. Thereafter, the pups were exposed to 8% oxygen with balanced nitrogen for 90 min at a constant temperature of 36\u00b0C. Thirty mg/kg of human blood-derived IAIPs or placebo were given intraperitoneally (I.P.) immediately, 24 and 48 h after termination of hypoxia. Body weight was measured immediately, 24, 48 and 72 h after hypoxia. Seventy-two h after hypoxia, a necropsy was performed and brain weight obtained. (B) Study design for delayed treatment. The procedures were the same as for the study design in A except that IAIPs or placebo were given 6, 24 and 48 h after the termination of hypoxia. Body weight was measured immediately, 6, 24, 48 and 72 h after hypoxia. Seventy-two h after hypoxia, an necropsy was performed and brain weight obtained. IAIP = Inter-Alpha Inhibitor proteins, PBS = phosphate buffered saline.\nThe experimental designs are illustrated in\nFig. 1\n. After recovery from surgery and exposure to hypoxia, the immediate treatment group (\nFig. 1A\n) was given three intraperitoneal (I.P.) injections of 30 mg/kg of human plasma-derived IAIPs (ProThera Biologies, Inc., Providence, Rl, USA) immediately (time zero), 24, and 48 h after the termination of hypoxia. In the delayed treatment group (\nFig. 1B\n), the subjects were treated with I.P. injections of IAIPs (30 mg/kg) at 6, 24, and 48 h after the termination of hypoxia. In the Sham- and HI-PL-designated pups, I.P. injections of equivalent volumes of placebo (phosphate buffered saline, PBS) were administered as described above. Three separate time-matched, sham-treated groups were included for both the immediate and delayed treatment groups, as well as separately for the group on which infarct volumes were measured.\nIAIPs were produced and purified as has been previously described (\nLim, 2013\n,\nOpal, et al., 2011\n,\nSpasova, et al., 2014\n). Briefly, IAIPs were extracted from human plasma, purified with a monolithic anion-exchange chromatography (CIMmultus, BIA Separation, Villach, Austria) and eluted, and concentrated with a tangential flow filtration system (Labscale, Millipore) before undergoing purity analyses with SDS-PAGE, Western immunoblot, competitive IAIP ELISA and a standardized\nin vitro\ntrypsin inhibition assay. The biological activity was measured based on the ability of IAIPs to inhibit the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate by trypsin (TAME or L-BAPNA). Inhibition was monitored by a decrease in the rate of change in absorbance/min at 405-410 nm wavelengths (\nLim, et al., 2005\n).\nThe subjects were weighed before surgery and at the time of each IAIP or placebo injection. At 72 h after HI, the subjects were weighed, and sedated with ketamine (74 mg/kg, I.P.) and xylazine (4 mg/kg, I.P.). Brain perfusion was performed with PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) via cardiac puncture at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Thereafter, the brains were removed, weighed, post-fixed with PFA for 24 h, and stored in 30% sucrose in phosphate buffer (0.1 M) at 4\u00b0C before paraffin embedding for histopathological scoring and immunohistochemical staining (\nThrelkeld, et al., 2014\n) or before cryosectioning for the infarct volume analysis (\nZhang, et al., 2004\n). The paraffin-embedded brain tissues were sectioned in coronal planes at 10 \u03bcm thicknesses. One coronal section per brain containing the dorsal hippocampus (bregma \u22123.36 \u00b1 1.4 mm) was utilized to standardize the histopathological scoring and immunohistochemical analyses (\nChen, et al., 2019\n,\nPaxinos and Watson, 2017\n). The brain sections for the infarct volume analysis were cryosectioned at a thickness of 20 \u03bcm.\n\n2.2. Histopathological scoring\nParaffin-embedded brain sections from the immediate or delayed study groups (\nFig. 1A\nand\nB\n) were stained with Luxol fast blue and hematoxylin-eosin (LFB & FIE). Two board-certified neuropathologists, who were not aware of study groups, scored the sections of the hemisphere ipsilateral to the FI I injury without knowledge of the group allocation using a modification of an established scoring system (\nVannucci, et al., 2004\n). The histopathological scoring was used to examine neuronal and white matter injury as well as overall histopathological damage to the cingulate gyrus, parietal cortex, hippocampus, caudate/putamen and thalamus brain regions semi-quantitatively. LFB staining was used to evaluate damage to white matter indicating myelin loss or degradation\ni.e\ndecreased LFB staining or white matter injury. FIE staining was used to examine nuclear pyknosis, cytoplasmic reddening and condensation, and hyperchromatism that are indicative of neuronal injury and gliosis assessed by the presence of reactive gemistocytes, which are also indicative of damage to white matter (\nBrown and Brierley, 1972\n). FHI-related changes included parenchymal cystic necrosis and non-cystic necrosis and edema, myelin pallor, neuronal loss and reactive gliosis. The pathological criteria for FIE identification of reactive gliosis included the presence of reactive astrocytes, including increases in both the size and number of astrocytes, along with an overall increase in the cellularity of white matter. Reactive (gemistocytic) astrocytes are readily identifiable by HE staining as large astrocytes with plump, eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei.\nFive brain regions were evaluated for evidence of HI-related injury including the cingulate gyrus, parietal cortex, hippocampus, caudate/putamen and thalamus. The scoring system of Vannucci\net al.\nwas modified as follows: a score of 0 = no detectable HI damage; 1 = focal loss of individual neurons; 2 = columnar damage involving multiple cortical neuronal layers, or in the hippocampus, caudate/putamen and thalamus as multiple or large foci of neuronal loss along with edema and reactive gliosis but without cystic infarction; and 3 = severe cystic and non-cystic infarction, edema, myelin pallor and reactive gliosis (\nVannucci, et al., 2004\n).\n\n2.3. Infarct volume measurement\nThe neonatal rats used for the infarct volume measurements represented a separate group of animals from those used for the histopathological scoring and immunohistochemical analyses in the current study. Brains were divided into four or five 2 mm coronal sections using a brain sheer matrix (Zivic instruments, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), immersed in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) embedding medium, and frozen in a metal beaker filled with isopentane surrounded by crushed dry ice. Five cryosections (20 \u03bcm) were obtained from each 2-mm section and mounted on gelatin-coated slides. We randomly selected every fourth cryosection to be stained with cresyl violet for evaluation of HI cell injury (\nZhang, et al., 2004\n). The images of hemispheric and damaged areas were obtained using a Micropublisher 6 CCD Camera (Qimaging, Surrey, British Columbia, Canada) and analysed with ImageJ (NIH) without knowledge of the group assignment. The respective volumes were calculated from each measured area by multiplying the distance between sections. The infarct was calculated as a percentage of the ratio of the damaged volume to the volume of the total contralateral hemisphere with correction for hemispheric edema, according to the following formula: infarct (%) = [1 \u2212 (volume of total ipsilateral hemisphere \u2212 volume of infarct)/volume of total contralateral hemisphere)] \u00d7 100% (\nSawada, et al., 2000\n,\nSwanson, et al., 1990\n).\n\n2.4. Immunohistochemical staining and quantification\nThe paraffin-embedded brain sections were deparaffinized. Antigen retrieval was performed in a 120\u00b0C autoclave for 10 min with sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0) solution. The sections were blocked with a blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin, BSA, 5% normal goat serum, NGS, TBST with 0.3 M glycine) for 2 h at room temperature.\nThe neuronal and cell death immunohistochemical markers were determined as follows. Primary mouse anti-Fox3/neuronal nuclei (NeuN) monoclonal antibody (1:250; Abeam, Cambridge, MA, USA) was applied and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C, and Alexa Fluor\u00ae 594 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:250; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was then applied and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. An equilibration buffer (ApopTag\u00ae Plus Fluorescein\nIn Situ\nApoptosis Detection Kit S7111, EMD Millipore Corporation, Temecula, CA, USA) was applied and replaced with working strength Tdt enzyme (30%, v:v). After incubation for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, the Tdt enzyme reaction was terminated with working strength stop/wash buffer (3%, v:v) for 10 min at room temperature. Working strength anti-digoxigenin conjugate was applied (47%, v:v) and left to incubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nAfter incubation with the secondary antibody, the slides containing the stained sections were dried and mounted with a medium containing 4\u2019, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA). The NeuN- and ApopTag-stained sections were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until analysis.\nDNA-DAPI complexes emit a bluish-white fluorescence when excited by ultraviolet light (wavelength of 385/30 nm). Nuclei with the blue DAPI fluorescence that co-localized with the Alexa Fluor 594 red fluorescence were considered NeuN-positive (NeuN\n+\n) cells. Similarly, nuclei with the blue DAPI fluorescence that co-localized with the green fluorescent cell death marker were considered ApopTag-positive (ApopTag\n+\n) cells (\nFigs. 7\nand\n8\n). ApopTag\n+\n/NeuN\n+\ncells denoted co-localization of the green fluorescence with the Alexa Fluor 594 red fluorescence. ApopTag\n+\n/Non-Neuronal\n+\ncells indicated green fluorescence without co-localization with the Alexa Fluor 594 red fluorescence.\nFig. 7.\nOpen in a new tab\nRepresentative immunohistochemical images containing NeuN- (red) and ApopTag-labeled (green) cells in the cerebral cortices of the Sham, HI-PL and HI-IAIP male (top row) and female (bottom row) neonatal rats. DAPI (blue) is utilized as a counterstain. The inset on each image identifies the area of the brain from which the image was taken. White arrows indicate ApopTag-labeled cells (ApopTag\n+\n). White arrowheads indicate ApopTag-positive and NeuN-positive cells.\nFig. 8.\nOpen in a new tab\nThe average positive-labeled profiles of total ApopTag\n+\n, ApopTag\n+\n/NeuN\n+\n, ApopTag\n+\n/Non-Neuronal\n+\nprofiles for the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and total hemisphere in the Sham, HI-PL and HI-IAIP groups. Top panel reports data for males + females, middle panel for males, and bottom panel for females. Values are mean \u00b1 SEM. Sham: male n = 9\u201312, female n = 4\u20138; HI-PL: male n = 7\u201310, female n = 7\u20139; HI-IAIP: male n = 6\u20139, female n = 5\u201310. *\nP\n< 0.05.\nApopTag- and/or NeuN-labeled profiles within the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and total hemisphere ipsilateral to HI were imaged on a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 Imaging System microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Jena, Germany) and quantified by the Stereo Investigator 10.0 fractionator probe software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT, USA) according to previously described methods (\nThrelkeld, et al., 2014\n). Sections of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and total hemisphere were traced under 10\u00d7 magnification. An automated stage paired with the Stereo Investigator was used to step systematically through the counting frames (Fractionator probe). ApopTag- and/or NeuN-labeled profiles were marked within each counting frame with a circular digital counting tool.\nOligodendrocytes were detected by identification of CNPase, a specific oligodendrocyte membrane enzyme. Primary mouse anti-CNPase (11-5B) monoclonal antibody (1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C after blocking for 2 h. Thereafter, Alexa Fluor\u00ae 555 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was applied and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The CNPase-stained sections were stored at 4\u00b0C until analysis.\nThe CNPase marker was determined in the entire coronal section by whole brain imaging scanned on a Nikon Ti-E spinning disc confocal microscope using NIS Advanced Researcher software (Nikon Instruments, Inc., Melville, NY, USA). Positive CNPase staining areas were quantified in the corpus callosum, internal capsule and in the total hemisphere ipsilateral to the HI injury. Positive CNPase staining areas were determined by Fiji software as 8-bit grayscale images using a constant pixel threshold (\nHagberg, et al., 2015\n,\nLundgaard, et al., 2013\n,\nMecha, et al., 2013\n,\nSchindelin, et al., 2012\n,\nWang, et al., 2009\n). Results were expressed as a ratio of the positive CNPase staining area to the total hemisphere area ipsilateral to HI. All imaging and quantification were performed without knowledge of the study group assignments.\n\n2.5. Statistical analyses\nAll results were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Body weight gain between treatment groups were compared across time points by two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures (\nFigs. 2A\nand\n11A\n). One-way ANOVA was used to detect differences in brain weights and infarct volumes among the three treatment groups (\nFigs. 2B\n,\n6\nand\n11B\n). If a significant difference was detected by ANOVA, the Fisher\u2019s least significant difference (LSD) method for multiple comparisons was used as a post-hoc test. SAS Proc GLIMMIX generalized mixed modeling (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used for ordinal regression analyses of the histopathological injury scores for both the immediate (\nFig. 5\n) and delayed (\nFig. 12\n) treatment studies. Group differences were determined with least-squares means. If a significant difference was detected, the Tukey-Kramer test was used to detect specific differences after adjustment for multiple comparisons. The results from the ApopTag analysis (\nFig. 8\n) were first log\n10\n-transformed to satisfy normality (Shapiro-Wilk normality test) and variance (Brown-Forsythe equal variance test) assumptions for ANOVA. Two-factor ANOVA for repeated measures was used to compare cell death across the cortex, hippocampus and total hemisphere among the treatment groups (\nFig. 8\n). One-way ANOVA was also used to detect differences in the quantities of total ApopTag-positive (Total ApopTag\n+\n), ApopTag\n+\n/NeuN\n+\n, and ApopTag\n+\n/Non-neuronal\n+\ncells between treatment groups. The Spearman\u2019s rank correlation compared the relationship between the immunohistochemical data and histopathological scores for the cerebral cortex ipsilateral to HI of male and female subjects (\nFig. 9\n). One-way ANOVA was performed to compare the area of the CNPase expression within the corpus callosum, internal capsule and the positive area in the total hemisphere between the treatment groups (\nFig. 10B\n). The Fisher\u2019s LSD post-hoc test was used for multiple comparisons if a significant difference was detected by ANOVA.\nP\n< 0.050 was considered to indicate statistical significance.\nFig. 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nBody weight gain (%) and brain weights (g) of the Sham, HI-PL and HI-IAIP groups after immediate treatment with IAIPs or placebo in neonatal rats exposed to HI brain injury.

    "Methods": "Floxed CNTFR\u03b1 (Lee et al., 2013) and mlc1f-Cre (Bothe et al., 2000; from Dr. Steven Burden [NYU]) mice were PCR genotyped from tail biopsy and maintained on a 129SvEvBrd background. CNTFR\u03b1 knockdown mice (mlc1f-Cre+/\u2212/flxCNTFR\u03b1+/+) and non-floxed littermate controls (mlc1f-Cre+/\u2212/flxCNTFR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212) of both sexes were generated through mlc1f-Cre+/\u2212/flxCNTFR\u03b1+/\u2212 \u00d7 mlc1f-Cre\u2212/\u2212/flxCNTFR\u03b1+/\u2212 breeding and, at 2.5\u20134 months, processed in parallel (blind to genotype) through all procedures including, nerve crush, perfusion, immunohistochemistry and image analysis. This controlled for variation inin uteroand postnatal rearing environments, age, and all reagents.\n\nT-tests were used for directa prioricomparisons of 2 groups. These were then confirmed by a 2-way ANOVA analysis followed by appropriately protected Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons, all conducted with GraphPad Prism 5 (RRID:SCR_002798). University of Cincinnati IACUC approved all animal procedures.\n\nUnilateral sciatic nerve crush\nFollowing ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg) anesthesia, mid-thigh skin was opened and a 5 mm longitudinal cut in the biceps femoris exposed the underlying nerve passing superficial to the obturator internus tendon. The nerve was freed from connective tissue and crushed for 10 seconds with Dumont #5 Biologic Tip forceps (Fine Science Tools). This procedure lesions all nerve axons, as we have demonstrated (\nLee et al., 2013\n).\n\nMotor neuron ChAT analysis\nFollowing overdose with avertin (20 mg/ml; IP), mice were perfused with 4\u00b0C saline and then 4\u00b0C, 4% paraformaldehyde. Spinal cords were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4\u00b0C and then incubated for at least 48 hours in 30% sucrose/2.5 mM sodium azide before sectioning. Every fourth 30um, coronal section was collected with a cryostat throughout the L5 cord, which contains the sciatic nerve projecting MNs. Sections were processed free-floating according to described immunohistochemistry procedures (\nMacLennan et al., 1996\n), and with a 4-day, 4\u00b0C incubation in rabbit anti-ChAT polyclonal primary antiserum (Chemicon [Millipore]; Cat. # AB143; RRID:AB2079760) at 1:6000. Label was visualized with ABC signal amplification (Vector Laboratories; cat. # PK-6100) and cyanine-3 tyramide (Perkin Elmer; cat. # SAT704B).\nThe ChAT antiserum has been widely used and extensively characterized through immunohistochemistry and western blot (see\nStillman et al., 2009\n). Chat-labeled MNs were stereologically counted in accordance with\nHyman et al., (1998)\n. In addition to their characteristic ChAT expression, MNs were identified by their characteristic location in the ventrolateral horn, irregular shape, and large nuclei. Counts were multiplied by four to estimate total labeled MNs since every fourth section was assayed. In addition, MetaMorph; RRID:SCR_002368) was used to outline the cytoplasm of each labeled MN (total of over 7500 MNs analyzed) and determine its average cytoplasmic ChAT labeling intensity. As with all procedures, this analysis was conducted by individuals\nunaware of genotype\n.\nImages (\nFigure 1A\u2013F\n) were captured with a DXM1200 camera and Nikon E800 microscope, and were identically adjusted with CorelDRAW.\nFigure 1.

    "Methods": "Ethical statement concerning animal research.\nAll experimental procedures involving animals were approved by the University of Louisville Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nNeonatal capsaicin injections.\nIn order to test our hypothesis we used neonatal capsaicin administration (\nD\u2019Amour, 1941\n), the well-established method for depleting nociceptive afferents expressing TRPV1, the ion channel activated by capsaicin. Six pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats of known gestational age were checked several times a day to ensure an accurate record of birth time. Every pup in two of the litters received capsaicin injections, pups in two other litters received vehicle injections and the remaining two litters received no injections. Injections were done at 2 days of age. The rat pups were taken out of their cages (half of the litter at a time, along with some bedding) and received intraperitoneal injections of either capsaicin (50 mg/kg dissolved in 10% Tween 80 and 10% ethanol (v/v) in 0.9% saline) or vehicle injections (same solution without capsaicin). Anesthesia was achieved by wrapping pups in gauze and placing them on ice for 4\u20135 minutes. The animals were monitored continuously and the injections were done when all movements ceased and animals were not responsive to touch or pinch. After the injection, the animals were placed on the removed bedding until they warmed up and regained movement. The animals were returned to their mothers for the next 4 weeks after which they were weaned. The weaned animals were sexed so that males and female could be housed separately. Only female rats were used in the current study. The animals were allocated to 3 groups: capsaicin-treated (CAP, n=8), vehicle- treated (VEH, n=8) and control animals that received no injections (CON, n=8). All three groups received SCIs; CAP and VEH rats received stretching, while animals in the CON group served as injured controls and were not stretched. Gentling procedures (daily handling for 10\u201315 min) and baseline assessments began when the animals were 3 months old.\n\nPre-injury sensory assessments.\nTo assess the functional effectiveness of TRPV1+ C-fiber depletion by capsaicin, animals were tested for withdrawal thresholds to painful stimuli using electro-von Frey (mechanical) and Hargreaves\u2019 (thermal) sensory tests, as described in detail previously (\nCaudle et al., 2011\n). Briefly, for von Frey testing, the animals were placed on a metal grid and an electro-von Frey rigid filament was applied to the plantar portion of the foot. The force recorded was that registered at the point of paw withdrawal when followed by a stereotypic behavioral response of attending to the stimulated foot. For the Hargreaves\u2019 test, the animals were placed on a warmed glass surface (32\u00b0C) and an infrared light was shone onto the plantar surface of the foot. The latency of paw withdrawal from the stimulus was recorded.\nC-fiber depletion was also assessed using the cutaneous trunci muscle reflex (CTMR), which is purely nociceptive in rats (\nPetruska et al., 2014\n). CTMR testing was performed following administration of a sub-surgical dose of sodium pentobarbital (35mg/kg). A five by three centimeter grid of black dots was drawn on the skin of the back starting from the midline (3 cm from the base of the tail). The midline dots were 1 cm apart (rostrocaudally) and 5 mm apart mediolaterally (a schematic of the grid is shown in\nFig. 1C\n). Mechanical (forceps pinch) and thermal (metal probe heated to 65\u00b0C) stimuli were applied at two sites bilaterally. Digital video recordings of the skin were made with a camera placed directly above the animal. MaxTraq software (Innovision Systems) was used to digitize the dots and to quantify contraction distance and time to minimum distance using two dots rostral to the stimulation sites. Measurements were made using a custom-designed excel macro. Assessments were done by individuals blinded to the experimental groups.\nFigure 1. Neonatal capsaicin treatment reduces response to cutaneous thermal stimulation only.\nOpen in a new tab\nTo assess the effectiveness of TRPV1+ nociceptor depletion by neonatal capsacicin treatment, sensory function was assessed using von Frey (A), Hargreaves\u2019 (B) and Cutaneous Trunci Muscle Reflex (CTMR, D-G). C. shows a schematic of CTMR markings on the dorsal skin for quantitative analysis of the reflex in response to mechanical (forceps pinch) or thermal (heated metal probe) stimulus. Dot A (star) and B (square) are two sites for stimulus application on either side of the midline. The data for contraction distance and speed to minimum distance (mechanical \u2013 D, thermal \u2013 E) between the two hollow dots rostral to the stimulation sites are shown. Data reported as means + SD for A and D-E (One-way ANOVA, Tukey HSD\npost hoc\n, p<.05), for B, bars represent means, dots each individual animal (n=8 in each group) (Mann Whitney U test, p<.05).\n\nSpinal cord injury.\nSpinal cord injuries were delivered as previously described (\nMagnuson et al., 2009\n). Animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and a midline incision was made over the lower thoracic spine, followed by a laminectomy at T9 to expose the spinal cord. Moderately-severe spinal cord contusions (25g/cm) were delivered using the NYU \u201cMASCIS\u201d Impactor (W. Young, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ).\n\nLocomotor assessment.\nLocomotor function was assessed using the BBB Open Field Locomotor Scale (\nBasso et al., 1995\n) pre-injury and then weekly for the first 6 weeks to demonstrate a functional plateau. During the weeks of stretching, BBB scores were assessed 3 times a week, Monday am (pre- stretch), Monday pm (after one stretching session) and Friday pm (after 5 days of stretching), as previously described (\nCaudle et al., 2015\n; Keller et al., 2016). These assessments included determining the proportion of animals that could receive a BBB subscore, which indicated that they achieved consistent weight-bearing stepping (Basso, 2004).\n\nStretching protocol.\nOur standard hindlimb stretching protocol (\nCaudle et al., 2015\n) was initiated at 6 weeks post SCI when BBB scores had plateaued and locomotor function was stable for 3 weeks. Normal or sham injured control groups were not included because uninjured animals will not tolerate the stretching protocol. The protocol consists of two 12 minute sessions of 6 stretches (each held at the end range of motion for 1 minute) applied to major hindlimb muscle groups bilaterally (ankle, knee, hip flexors/extensors and hip adductors and abductors). For the stretching sessions, animals were gently wrapped in a towel, leaving their hindlimbs exposed, and placed on their backs. Seven rat PTs, who were blinded to experimental groups, participated in the daily stretching sessions and animals were rotated through the PTs so that they were not stretched by the same PT more than twice per week. During each stretch the PTs closely monitored the animals and noted any responses displayed. Some of the most common responses were kicking (vigorous movement of either or both hindlimbs), vibrations (high frequency, low range of motion movement mostly around the ankle) (\nKeller et al., 2017a\n) of either limb, withdrawal or pull-back (hindlimb resistance to stretch) and air-stepping (slow rhythmic step-like movement of either or both of the hindlimbs). The responses were given a score of 1, 2 or 3 based on intensity and frequency during each stretch: 1= mild/infrequent (5\u201320% of the stretch time), 2=moderate, frequent (20\u201370%), 3=severe/very frequent (70\u2013100%). Control animals were handled daily: they were wrapped in a towel and placed on their backs, but not stretched. Animals were stretched 5 days a week for 3 weeks and then were allowed to recover for 2 weeks. The rats were then stretched for an additional week (5 days) plus 2, 3 or 4 days on the following week, and were sacrificed 2 hours after the last stretching session. Two to three animals from each stretch group (CAP and VEH) were sacrificed each day. Control animals were all sacrificed 2 hours after being wrapped in a towel and handled. All the animals were assessed using the BBB Open Field Locomotor Scale between the final stretching session and the time of sacrifice.\n\nEuthanasia and tissue processing.\nTwo hours after their last stretching session the animals were overdosed with a ketamine (50 mg/kg)/xylazine (0.024 mg/kg)/acepromazine (0.005 mg/kg) cocktail and transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% PFA as previously described (\nJonkers et al., 1984\n). The spinal cord including the injury epicenter and lumbar enlargement was dissected out and post-fixed in 4% PFA for one hour and transferred to 30% sucrose for cryoprotection for at least 4 days. The spinal cords were examined under the dissecting microscope confirming that all of the lesions were at the T10 level. A 12 mm length of each cord containing the injury epicenter was isolated, placed in a block with tissue freezing medium completely covering the sample and rapidly frozen on dry ice. Transverse 30 \u03bcm sections were cut and stained with eriochrome cyanine and were photographed at 4X as described previously (\nKuerzi et al., 2010\n). In order to provide a quantitative measure of injury severity, spared white matter (SWM) was assessed using the cross-sectional area (CSA) of darkly stained, compact tissue, traced using ImageJ (NIH) and compared to uninjured (control) sections. The section with the least SWM was assigned as the injury epicenter. The lumbar spinal cord (L1-L5) was cryoprotected and sectioned at 20 \u03bcm for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of c-Fos and CGRP. Three hindlimb muscles (Tibialis Anterior, Medial Gastrocnemius and Biceps Femoris) were also dissected out for histological analysis. Muscle length (origin to insertion) was measured and a 5 mm length, standardized from the middle one-third, proximal to origin, was post-fixed in 4% PFA and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. Each muscle sample was sectioned at 10 \u03bcm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The muscle was analyzed for the presence of centralized nuclei and fiber cross sectional area as previously described (\nKeller et al., 2017b\n). Photomicrographs of four muscle areas standardized to dorsal, ventral, medial and lateral within each cross section were acquired at 20X. The number of muscle fibers (MF) containing centralized nuclei (CN) were counted and expressed as a percentage of the total number of MFs analyzed. In addition, the perimeters of over 150 individual muscle fibers were traced from each muscle and CSA area determined using ImageJ software.\n\nc-Fos immunohistochemistry and analysis.\nNuclei positive for c-Fos were immunolabeled using avidin-biotin peroxidase (\nHsu et al., 1981\n). Slides with sections of lumbar spinal cord were warmed and washed with PBS. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched using 3% hydrogen peroxide (15 min). The sections were then blocked with 10% normal donkey serum (NDS) and 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 0.3% PBS-Triton (PBST) for 1 hour. The sections were incubated with c-Fos primary antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-c-Fos, 1:1000, ab208942, lot #\nGR269424\n\u20133 Abcam) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Sections were then rinsed with PBS/PBST, incubated with biotinylated antibody (donkey- antimouse, 1:1000, Immunostar, 715-065-151, lot# 125258) for 1 hour, rinsed with PBS/PBST, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (1:1000 in PBS, Vector Laboratories SA- 5004, lot#ZB1113) for 1 hour and rinsed with PBS/PBST. Sections were then incubated with DAB solution (SigmaFast DAB D0426, lot# SLBJ7196V) for 10 minutes to visualize the immuno- labelled complexes. The reaction was stopped in distilled water and the slides were air dried for at least 10 minutes, followed by 3 minutes in Xylene. The slides were coverslipped using paramount. Images of each section were acquired on an inverted microscope with a 10x objective. Using ImageJ the gray matter was divided into three regions of interest (bilaterally): Substantia Gelatinosa (SG, border was clearly visible in stained tissue), dorsal horn (DH) and intermediate gray matter/ventral horn (IGM&VH). Darkly-stained, c-Fos positive nuclei were counted manually in ImageJ by an individual blinded to experimental groups. In addition, random, de-identified sections were analyzed by other investigators and counts were compared to ensure consistent identification of stained (c-Fos+) nuclei. Three images for each lumbar level (L1-L5, 15 sections total) spaced a minimum of 200 \u03bcm apart, were acquired and the average number of nuclei from the sections for each animal was used for group analysis.\n\nCGRP immunohistochemistry and analysis.\nCGRP IHC was performed on sections of L3 spinal cord. Slides were warmed, rinsed and blocked (10% NDS, 10% BSA in 0.3% PBST) for 1 hour. Sections were incubated with CGRP primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-CGRP 1:2000, AB15360, lot# 2475751 Abcam) overnight at 4\u00b0C, rinsed and incubated with secondary antibody (donkey-anti-rabbit with Alexa 647, Cat# 711-606-152, lot #118661 Abcam). The sections were rinsed then coverslipped with fluoromount. The dorsal horns from three different sections (around 200 \u03bcm apart) for each animal were imaged at 20X. The area of CGRP-positive puncta within the dorsal horn was identified and differentiated using the threshold tool within Elements (Nikon Instruments Software). The same threshold range was applied to all the images from all the animals. The area of CGRP was quantified for each dorsal horn excluding the dorsal root entry zones that were removed manually from each image. The average CGRP area from 3 sections represented the per-animal mean, and these values were used to generate group averages. All these analyses were performed by an individual blinded to the experimental groups.\n\nExperimental Design and Statistical Analysis.\nThis behavioral study included 24 animals that were randomly assigned to treatment, vehicle or control groups. Control, non-SCI animals are not amenable to the stretching procedures due to their resistance of hindlimb manipulation that could potentially result in injury to their muscle and/or joint and thus were no included in the study. Based on our previous studies, post-injury motor assessment (BBB) scores of rats with NYU injury severities ranging from mild-moderate to moderate-severe result in average group differences from 1.5\u20132.5 points with standard deviations of approximately 1.0\u20132.0. Based on power analysis calculations, detection of significant differences between the groups with similar expected results can be achieved at a power of 88.7\u201396.0% with equal sample sizes of 8\u201310 per group. Researchers were blinded to experimental groups during stretching and for all the behavioral and histological assessments.\nOne-way ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD\npost hoc\nt-tests for multiple comparisons was used to compare differences among the groups (baseline von Frey; terminal CTMR, kinematic excursions, CGRP & muscle fibers) at one time-point. Repeated measurements (BBB locomotor tests assessed over time and c-Fos+ nuclei counts across lumbar regions) were compared using Repeated Measures ANOVA (within factor) with the Group factor (between groups factor) followed by Bonferroni\npost hoc\nt-tests for multiple comparisons. The proportion of animals within the groups who achieved a BBB subscore were compared with the Binomial Proportion Test. Hindlimb responses of the CAP & VEH groups during stretching were compared using Independent t-tests between means with equal variance. Hargreaves\u2019 responses at baseline were analyzed using the nonparametric Mann Whitney U test to compare rankings of the groups due to high and unequal variance among the groups. The relationship between the hindlimb responses of kicking and vibrations during stretching and the number of c-Fos+ neurons was compared using nonparametric Spearman Rank correlations.\nData were analyzed using IBM SPSS v22, 24. Results and figure legends indicate which test was used for the represented set of data. Display of data means (ANOVA, t-tests) are reported as mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD) as indicated."

    "Methods": "The protocols for animal experiments were approved by IACUC at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Rutgers University and Feinstein Medical Institute. The use of autopsy specimens of preterm brain tissue from the neuropathology laboratory was approved by IRB at Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center.\n\n2.1. Primary neuronal cultures\nPrimary neuronal cultures were prepared from E18 or P8 rat pups as described. Briefly, the hippocampus, cerebellum or cortex was dissected followed by trypsinization and centrifugation. The pellet was then resuspended in neuronal culture medium (Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 and 25 mM KCl) and seeded at a density of 5\u00d710\n5\ncells/ml (for RT/PCR and immunostaining) or 1\u00d710\n5\ncells/ml (for MTT assays).\n\n2.2. Induction of hypoxia\nin vitro\nCobalt chloride (CoCl\n2\n.6H\n2\nO) (Sigma) was used to induce hypoxia in primary neuronal cultures as previously described (Wu and Yotnda, 2011). Five-day old neuronal cultures were treated with various concentrations of CoCl\n2\n(50\u2013125 \u03bcM) for 24 hours. After washing off the CoCl\n2\n, cultures were replenished with conditioned medium which was supplemented with 100 \u03bcM caffeine or vehicle control for an additional 24 hours, followed by fixation and analysis.\n\n2.3. Neonatal hypoxia and caffeine treatment\nin vivo\nMouse pups were given caffeine at a loading dose of 20 mg/kg/day on postnatal day 4 (P4), then 15 mg/kg/day for the next 3 days. Caffeine was dissolved in sterile water and given to mouse pups via orogastric tube 1.9 french to maintain a serum concentration of caffeine at 5\u201315 mg/l (approximately 26\u201377 \u03bcM) (\nGaytan et al., 2006\n;\nGuillet and Kellogg, 1991\n). Sham groups were given equal volumes of sterile water via the orogastric route. In both groups, half of the pups were exposed to hypoxic environment (8% oxygen) for 20 min on P7, whereas the other half remained in normoxia. Pups were then deeply anesthetized with a lethal dose of xylazine (30mg/kg)/ketamine (300mg/kg) and perfused transcardially with 4% PFA.\n\n2.4. Immunostaining\nImmunostaining was performed using antibodies against A\n1\nR or A\n2A\nR (Antibody Online, GA and Genetex, CA and AbCam, MA), PSD-95 (Santa Cruz, CA), beta-III tubulin (Sigma), AMPA, CREB-1 and syntaxin (all from Genscript, NJ), HIF-1\u03b1 (Novus, CO, Genetex, CA and AbCam, MA ) and c-Fos (Gentex, CA and Biorbyt, CA). The immune complexes were detected by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies or Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, PA). The resulting images were acquired using Axiovert fluorescent microscopy (primary neuronal cultures), Zeiss LSM710 (mouse brains) or Olympus Fluoroview 300 (preterm infant brains) confocal microscopy. The brains of mice deficient in A\n1\nR or A\n2A\nR were kindly provided by Dr. William Welch (Georgetown University) and Dr. Bruce Cronstein (NYU), respectively.\nUnless specified, all mouse brains were immunostained using vibratome sections (50 \u03bcm thick). For A\n1\nR and PSD-95 co-localization experiments, cryosectioned slices were used. For study of the expression of A\n1\nR in postmortem preterm human brain, tissues were collected from the autopsy specimens of preterm infants (gestational age of 23\u201324 weeks) who were given caffeine on the first day of life and continued until death at three weeks of life. These tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, paraffin embedded and sectioned coronally at 6 \u03bcm thick. Following antigen retrieval, sections were incubated with A\n1\nR antibody.\nThe densitometries of single cell RT-PCR bands and the neurite length in the acquired images of beta-III tubulin immunostaining were quantified using NIH ImageJ. The number of A\n1\nR, syntaxin and AMPAR puncta was quantified using the Analyze Particle function of Fiji ImageJ (size=30\u2013250, circularity=0.3\u20131.0) as previously described (\nMuller et al., 2018\n;\nTaylor et al., 2010\n). The pixel intensity of HIF-1\u03b1 in the nucleus and cytoplasm was measured using ImageJ.\n\n2.5.

CoCl\n2\ncontaining medium was then replaced with conditioned medium in the presence or absence of 100 \u03bcM caffeine for an additional 24 hours. Neuronal viability was tested using the MTT assay as follows.\nMTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] was added to medium at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and incubated with the cells at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours.

Based on the morphology, cover glasses containing single neurons were harvested for RT-PCR as previously described (\nDulac and Axel, 1995\n;\nLi et al., 2009\n).

    "Methods": "Animals.\n8-week old male Swiss Webster mice (~30g; Charles River, Kingston, NY) were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled vivarium and provided\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. Mice were left unmanipulated for > 1 week to recover from the effects of shipping and adjust to a 14:10 light/dark (LD) cycle prior to experimental manipulations. All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Efforts were made to minimize animal use and discomfort.\n\nCardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedure.\nMice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in air, intubated, and maintained thereafter on 1.5% isoflurane. Mice were ventilated a tidal volume of 150 \u03bcL at a respiratory rate of 160 breaths/min. Head and body temperature were monitored with temperature probes. A PE10 catheter was placed into the right jugular vein for epinephrine (EPI) and potassium chloride (KCl) administration. Blood pressure was monitored through a cannula inserted into the right femoral artery and connected to a blood pressure transducer (Columbus, Instruments). Mice were stabilized for 10 min and blood pressure and temperature recorded at 1 min intervals (\nFig. S1\n). Following the 10 min acclimation, body and tail (but not head) temperature were lowered by circulating cold water through a coil system beneath the mouse to induce peripheral hypothermia restricting damage to the CNS during the CA/CPR procedure. CA was induced with an injection of KCL (50 \u03bcl, 0.5 M, 4\u00b0C) into the jugular catheter and the mouse was disconnected from the ventilator. Once a body temperature of 27\u00b0C was reached after approximately 4 min of arrest slow re-warming via a heat lamp and thermal blanket began. After 7 min 45 sec of arrest mice were reattached to the ventilator and 100 % oxygen at a tidal volume of 150 \u03bcL and a respiratory rate of 160 breaths/min was ventilated. After 8 min of arrest CPR was initiated with an injection of EPI (16 \u03bcg in 0.6 ml saline, 37\u00b0C) into the jugular catheter and chest compressions (300/min); 0.5 \u03bcg injections of EPI were administered until the mouse resuscitated (with a maximal dose of 32 \u03bcg). Mice were maintained on 100% oxygen for 25 min after return of spontaneous circulation and catheters were removed and incisions sutured.\n\nLighting manipulations.\nFollowing a monitored post-operative recovery period (approximately 2 h), mice were either placed back in dark night housing room (control LD; 14h 150 lux: 10h 0 lux) or mice were placed in a room with a dim light at night cycle (dLAN; 14 h 150 lux: 10 h 0 lux). Both the bright and dim lights were from fluorescent light sources and consisted of \u2018cool white\u2019 light composed of wavelengths distributed across the visible spectrum including blue wavelengths, and light intensity was measured inside the animal cage. In the experiment involving dim red light, 5 lux of 636 nm red light was provided.\n\nTissue collection for staining.\nSeven days following the cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation or sham surgery, surviving mice were individually brought into a procedure room, anesthetized with isoflurane vapors and a blood sample was collected via the retro-orbital sinus. Mice then received a lethal injection of sodium pentobarbital and were perfused transcardially with ice-cold 0.1\nM\nPBS followed by 50 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were post-fixed overnight, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, frozen on crushed dry ice, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. 14 \u03bcm brain sections were sliced at \u221222\u00b0C using a cryostat and thaw mounted onto Super Frost Plus slides (Fisher, Hampton, NH). Sections were taken in a series of 10 slides so that all slides contained non-consecutive sections for analysis and slides were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until stained with Fluoro-Jade C (FJ-C) or Iba1 using procedures already established in our lab (\nWeil et al., 2009\n).\nFluoro-Jade C\n. Cell death was quantified by labeling degenerating neurons with the fluorescein derivative FJ-C (Millipore, Temecula, CA). Mounted sections were thoroughly dried on a slide warmer, immersed in a basic ethanol solution (80% EtOH with 1% NaOH) and rinsed with 70% ethanol followed by water. Slides were placed in a 0.06% potassium permanganate solution for 10 min and rinsed twice. Sections were simultaneously incubated in FJ-C (0.0001% in a 1% acetic acid solution) and counterstained with DAPI (Sigma, St. Louis). Slides were rinsed, dried, cleared in xylene, and then coverslipped with DPX (Sigma). FJ positive cells were counted in the CA1, CA3, and DG of both hippocampal (approximately \u22121.70 to \u22122.30 from Bregma, example of selected regions highlighted\nFig. S2\n) hemispheres by a condition blind experimenter using a Nikon E800 microscope at 20X magnification. Cells were counted in two non-consecutive sections (sections were > 140 \u03bcm apart to avoid counting duplicate cells) and averaged.\nMicroglia\n. Microglia were visualized using an Iba1 directed antibody. Slides were dried, rinsed in PBS, and blocked with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Slides were incubated at room temperature for 24 h with rabbit anti-Iba1 antibody (Wako, Richmond, VA) diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X and BSA. Slides were rinsed and incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1000; Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h. Sections were quenched in H\n2\nO\n2\nin methanol, rinsed, and treated with Elite ABC reagent for 60 min (Vector). Sections were rinsed, developed with DAB (Vector), rinsed, dehydrated, cleared, and coverslipped. Photomicrographs of the hippocampus (approximately \u22121.70 to \u22122.30 from Bregma, see\nFig. S2\n) were taken with a Nikon E800 microscope at 20X using Neurolucida software (Microbrightfield, Burlington, VT). Staining for each experiment was performed in a single batch in order to minimize variation in staining intensity. Immunoreactive regions in the captured images were assessed using thresholding with an ROI box (dimensions and size of ROI box was the same for individual regions) around the region of interest with Image J software (NIH). Thresholding was performed within a limited range on individual slides and no sharpening filters or other image processing methods were applied. The left and right hemisphere were analyzed in two non-consecutive sections for each animal and averaged (total of 4 images per animal). Image analysis was completed by a researcher blind to treatment group.\n\nCytokine expression.\nA separate cohort of mice that underwent CA or sham was used for detection of hippocampal cytokine gene expression using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane vapors, blood was drawn via the retro-orbital sinus, and mice were rapidly decapitated. Brains were removed and the hippocampus was dissected out and immersed in RNALater stabilizing solution. RNA was subsequently extracted from hippocampal samples using a homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax T8, IKAWorks, Wilmington, NC) and an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA from microglia was extracted using a Sonicator (Microson XL2000, Misonix Inc., Farmingdale, NY) and an RNAeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA). RNA was then reverse transcribed into cDNA with M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase enzyme (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression for IL1\u03b2, IL6, and TNF\u03b1 was determined using inventoried primer and probe assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on an ABI 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System using Taqman\u00ae Universal PCR Master Mix. Relative gene expression of individual samples run in duplicate was calculated by comparison to a relative standard curve and standardized by comparison to 18S rRNA signal.\n\nAdministration of cytokine inhibitors.\nAn indwelling cannula was inserted into the left lateral ventricle (cannula position: +0.02 posterior and \u22120.95 lateral to bregma, extending 2.75 mm below the skull; Plastics One, Roanoke, VA) of anesthetized mice using a stereotaxic apparatus three days prior to CA or sham surgeries. One hour following CA, mice received a 2 \u03bcL injection of either a vehicle solution (artificial cerebral spinal fluid, aCSF), mouse IL6 neutralizing antibody (IL6-na; 10 ng), a monoclonal TNF antibody (Infliximab; IFX; 0.2 \u03bcg), or recombinant mouse IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1-ra; 3.6 \u03bcg) based on pre-assigned group and were then placed back in their respective lighting conditions. Doses were based on prior intracerebroventricular administration of these compounds in mouse (\nArruda et al., 2011\n;\nCraft and DeVries, 2006\n;\nKarelina et al., 2009\n;\nSun et al., 2018\n). Cannula placement was verified on Iba1 stained tissue.\n\nCorticosterone radioimmunoassay.\nWithin 30 min of collection, blood samples were centrifuged at 3000\ng\nfor 30 min at 4\u00b0C. Plasma was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until assayed. The samples were assayed using and I\n125\ncorticosterone kit (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH). The standard curve was run in triplicate and samples in duplicate. All samples within an experiment were run in a single assay.\n\nStatistical Analyses.\nStatistical comparisons among groups were conducted using ANOVA. In the case of significant differences (p<0.05), a post-hoc Tukey\u2019s test was conducted. When conditions of normality or equal variance were not met, the data were log transformed. Above statistical tests were conducted using Prism GraphPad and StatView Software v. 5.0.1. Survival plots were graphed using Kaplan-Meier survival plot in Prism. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Information on experimental group sizes are included in\nSupplemental Table 1\n."

    "Methods": "Animals\nFifty-nine adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were housed in commercially available Plexiglas\u00ae cages and maintained in a temperature (21 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) and light (12 hr on/12 hr off; lights on at 7:00 a.m.) controlled environment with food and water available\nad libitum.\nThe rats were acclimated to this environment for one week prior to the beginning of experimental manipulations, all of which occurred during the light portion of the cycle. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh. Every attempt was made to limit the number of rats used and to minimize pain and suffering.\n\nSurgery\nAll rats weighed 300-325 grams on the day of surgery and were randomly assigned to either the controlled cortical impact (CCI) or SHAM injury group. Surgical procedures were performed as previously described (\nShaw et al., 2013\n;\nBondi et al., 2014\n;\nde la Tremblaye et al., 2017\n;\nRadabaugh et al., 2017\n). Briefly, surgical anesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane in 2:1 N2O:O2 and the rats were intubated and secured in a stereotaxic frame. During surgery the rats were maintained at a surgical level with 2% isoflurane and carrier gases. A heating pad was used to maintain core temperature at 37 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C. Using aseptic procedures, a craniectomy was performed in the right hemisphere with a dental drill, and the bone plate was removed between bregma and lambda in order to provide sufficient clearance for the 6 mm-wide impact tip, which was centered within the opening. A TBI was then produced by impacting the exposed right parietal cortex to a depth of 2.8 mm tissue deformation at 4 m/sec. After the impact, anesthesia was discontinued and the incision was promptly sutured. SHAM injury rats were subjected to the same surgical procedures as the CCI animals except for the cortical impact.\n\nAcute neurological evaluation\nImmediately following the termination of anesthesia, hindlimb reflexive ability was evaluated by briefly squeezing the rats\u2019 paw every 5 sec and recording the time to produce a withdrawal response. Return of the righting reflex also was measured by recording the time required to turn from the supine to prone position. These tests are sensitive indicators of injury severity and duration of anesthesia (\nDixon et al., 1991\n;\nKline et al., 2010\n;\nBondi et al., 2014\n). Once the effects of anesthesia had completely worn off, as indicated by spontaneous movement in the holding cage, the rats were returned to the housing facility. Rats were weighed and their general health was monitored daily until sacrifice.\n\nDrug administration\nGAL (galantamine hydrobromide, TCI Chemicals, Portland, OR) was prepared daily by dissolving in sterile saline, which also served as the VEH. GAL (1 or 2 mg/kg) or a comparable volume of VEH (1 mL/kg) was administered intraperitoneally beginning 24 h after CCI or SHAM injury and once daily for 4 weeks until test day. On the days of behavioral testing, the injections were administered 1 h prior to testing. The doses were selected based on preliminary data from our laboratory showing a narrow therapeutic range. The route of administration is standard protocol in our laboratory (\nMonaco et al., 2014\n;\nPhelps et al., 2015\n;\nde la Tremblaye et al., 2017\n)\n\nAttentional set-shifting test (AST)\nThe AST task used in our laboratory was adapted from\nBirrell and Brown (2000)\nand has been described previously (\nBondi et al., 2014\n). One week prior to behavioral testing (i.e. day 21 post-surgery), rat food intake was limited to 80% of the standard diet (i.e. 14 g a day) with water freely available. We previously reported that injured rats were not more susceptible to losing weight during the mild food restriction process when initiated at 3 weeks following parietal CCI (\nBondi et al., 2014\n). We also recorded weights on a daily basis prior to and after food restriction in order to determine whether food restriction, injury, or drug treatment effected patterns of weight gain prior to testing. Cognitive testing took place in a custom-built rectangular Plexiglas arena (30 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 25 cm) that is painted gray on the outer side of all surfaces. A removable divider separates one third of the arena forming a start box, which was also used as a holding area between trials to allow the experimenter to clean the arena and change the pots. There is a permanent divider in the opposite one third of the arena that separates the two pots from one another. The separation allows for quick removal of the rat after a response has been recorded. The terracotta digging pots (internal rim diameter, 7 cm; depth, 6 cm) were all defined by a pair of cues (i.e. odor and digging media/pot). Each pot was marked with a single, distinct odor by adding two drops (10 \u03bcL /drop) of aromatic oil (NOW Foods, Bloomingdale, IL) to the inner rim 5 days prior to use. Odors were reapplied daily (1\u20132 \u03bcL) to maintain consistent intensity. A different pot was used for each combination of digging medium and odor, and only one odor was ever applied to a given pot. The \u201creward\u201d was one quarter of a Honey Nut Cheerio (General Mills Cereals, Minneapolis, MN) buried 2 cm below the surface of the digging medium in the \u201cpositive\u201d pot. To avoid location by smell rather than learning and discrimination, pots were sprinkled with Cheerio dust prior to each stage. To begin each trial, the removable divider was lifted to allow the rat access to the other two thirds of the arena and explore the pots. A correct choice is recorded when the rat chooses the pot containing the Cheerio reward without digging in the incorrect pot. Digging was defined as a vigorous displacement of the medium to retrieve and consume the reward buried within the pot. Simply investigating or smelling the surface of the pot without displacing the material was not considered a \u201cdig\u201d, thus allowing the rat to be able to assess all characteristics of the pots before making their choice (i.e., digging). The behavioral procedure was performed over the course of three days and consisted of habituation, training, and testing.\nHabituation:\nRats were first trained to dig reliably in pots to obtain the food reward. Two unscented pots were placed into clean home cages. Every five minutes, a food reward was buried in the pots with increasing depths of sawdust (i.e. three times at each increment of no sawdust, one third full, one half full, and completely full pots). Once the rat had learned to dig in the pots for a food reward, they were placed into the testing arena and given three trials to retrieve a Cheerio from both sawdust-filled pots.\nTraining:\nRats were trained on a series of simple discriminations (SD) in order to reach a criterion of six consecutive correct trials. First, they learned to associate the food reward with a medium cue using new unscented pots (felt vs. paper strips). After reaching criterion for the medium discrimination, rats had to learn to discriminate between aromatic odors in sawdust-filled pots (lemon vs. eucalyptus). All rats were trained using the same pairs of stimuli and in the same order. The positive and negative cues for each rat were randomly determined and equally represented. The training exemplars were not used again during testing. Any rat that failed to complete the training procedure was eliminated from subsequent testing.\nTesting:\nRats were then tested on a series of increasingly difficult discrimination stages, each also requiring a criterion of six consecutive correct trials, based on the cue progression previously established (\nBondi et al., 2014\n). The first stage was an SD involving only one stimulus dimension (i.e., odor or medium), with groups split in half with regard to initial stimulus dimension (for clarity, subsequent description will consider only the example beginning with an odor discrimination). The second stage was a compound discrimination (CD), in which the same contingency rule was required (e.g., odor), and the second, irrelevant stimulus dimension (e.g., medium) was introduced. As in the SD task, only one odor was associated with reward, but two different digging media were paired randomly with the odors. The third stage was a reversal (R1) of the previous discrimination, in which the same odors and media were used. Odor was maintained as the relevant dimension; however, the negative odor from the previous stage became positive (i.e., was associated with reward), and the positive odor from the previous stage became negative (no reward). The fourth stage was an intradimensional (ID) shift in which all new stimuli (odors and media) were introduced. Again, odor remained the relevant dimension and digging medium was still irrelevant. The fifth stage was a reversal of this discrimination (R2), in which the previously negative odor became positive, similar to R1. The sixth task required an extradimensional (ED) cognitive set-shift, in which all new stimuli were again introduced, but the dimension that had been repeatedly reinforced as the informative, relevant dimension (thus forming a \u201ccognitive set\u201d) was now irrelevant, and the previously distracting dimension (i.e., the digging medium) became the relevant dimension. Finally, the seventh stage was another reversal (R3), where the previously negative stimulus became positive, as in the previous reversals. The assignment of each exemplar in a pair as being positive or negative in a given stage, as well as the left-right positioning of the pots in each trial, were determined randomly in advance. The dependent measures were the number of trials required to reach criterion for each stage of the test, the total number of errors per stage, as well as set-loss errors, which occurred when 50% of the rule contingency had been achieved (i.e., 3,4, or 5 correct responses followed by an incorrect choice)(\nStuss, et al., 2000\n). The rats were allowed 10 min to make a choice on each trial. If a choice was not made within this interval, the trial was scored as an error and the rat was returned to the start box. Rats failing to make a choice on six consecutive trials, or failing to complete a stage within 50 trials, were eliminated from further testing.\n\nHistology\nCortical lesion volume was assessed after the completion of behavioral testing (i.e., 5 weeks post-surgery). Rats were anesthetized using Fatal-Plus (Henry Schein Animal Health, Columbus, OH; 0.25 mL, intraperitoneally) and then perfused transcardially with 200 mL of 0.1 M of phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4), followed by 300 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were extracted, postfixed in 4% PFA for 1 week, dehydrated with alcohols, and embedded in paraffin. Seven-micrometer-thick coronal sections were cut at 1-mm intervals through the lesion on a rotary microtome and mounted on Superfrost\u00ae/Plus glass microscope slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). After drying at room temperature, sections were deparaffinized in xylenes, rehydrated, and stained with cresyl violet. Cortical lesion volumes (mm\n3\n) were assessed by an observer blinded to experimental conditions using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The area of the lesion (mm\n2\n) was first calculated by outlining the inferred area of missing cortical tissue for each section (typically 5\u20137; Nikon NIS-Elements AR 3.22.14 software; Nikon) and then by summing the lesions obtained, as previously reported (\nOlsen et al., 2012\n;\nMonaco et al., 2014\n;\nBondi et al., 2014\n).\n\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed on data collected by observers blinded to treatment conditions using Statistica 64 version 13 Academic software (Dell Inc., Tulsa, OK). Righting reflex, hindlimb reflexive ability, and weight gain patterns during food restriction were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with injury and drug as factors to ensure that no surgery biases were reflected in subsequent drug assignment groups. For analysis of behavior on the AST, trials to criterion on medium and odor training SDs, as well as the number of trials to criterion, total response errors, and set loss errors were recorded for each test stage. These measures were analyzed by three-way multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA, Injury \u00d7 Drug Treatment \u00d7 Stage), with repeated measures over Stage. In order to ensure that MANOVA assumptions were met, the Levene\u2019s Test for Homogeneity of Variances and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality were performed. To also alleviate any biases with regards to perceptual stimuli, ED shift type analyses were achieved by means of a two-way ANOVA (Shift x Stage), with repeated measures over Stage. When significant ANOVA or MANOVA main effects or interactions were indicated, post-hoc comparisons to determine specific group differences were performed using Newman-Keuls tests or post-hoc one-way ANOVAs, as appropriate. The effects of chronic GAL treatment specifically on cognitive performance on the R1 stage were then analyzed separately using a\npriori\nhypotheses, which dictated that the design of this experiment predicted an isolated single-cell effect to which the MANOVA interaction term can be insensitive when embedded in a complex multi-factorial design in which several of the groups were expected to show no effect (e.g., see\nAnderson, 1961\n). Therefore, these a\npriori\nhypotheses were tested specifically by planned contrast analyses, first comparing TBI rats chronically injected with VEH to those subjected to SHAM surgery and receiving daily VEH injections, and then comparing TBI-GAL treated rats (1 or 2 mg/kg/day) to the VEH-treated injured group. Total trials to criterion across the test and histological data were analyzed using unpaired t-tests. Results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM), and significance for all statistical analyses was set at p<0.05."

    "Methods": "Mice\nAll animal procedures were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health PHS policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and reported following ARRIVE guidelines. The Hp\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice were generated from breeders provided by Dr. Emanuela Tolosano (\nMarro et al., 2007\n). C57BL/6 male mice were maintained in our temperature-controlled (23\u00b12\u00b0C) animal facilities on a reverse light cycle (12h light/dark) so neurobehavioral testing could be conducted during the awaken phase. This study contains two parts. In the first part, mice received either an autologous whole blood injection or collagenase-induced ICH and were sacrificed 3d post-surgery. In the autologous whole blood model, n=10 wildtype (WT) (2.8\u00b10.1 mo) and n=8 Hp\n\u2212/\u2212\n(3.2\u00b10.1 mo) mice were studied. In the collagenase model, n=14 WT (4.4\u00b10.5 mo) and n=15 Hp\n\u2212/\u2212\n(4.6\u00b10.3 mo) mice were studied. In the second part of the study, a young and aged cohort of mice underwent collagenase-induced ICH and were sacrificed 10d post-surgery. The young cohort consisted of n=13 WT (3.3\u00b10.3mo) and n=12 Hp\n\u2212/\u2212\n(3.3\u00b10.1mo) mice, and the aged cohort consisted of n=13 WT (9.1\u00b10.3mo) and n=11 Hp\n\u2212/\u2212\n(9.0\u00b10.2mo) mice. Computer-generated random numbers were used with a unique code linking to the individual animal. All surgical procedures and anatomical and functional outcomes were performed and assessed in a blinded manner. No mice were excluded from this study. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37.0\u00b10.5 \u00b0C during surgery. Mice were allowed\nad libitum\nfood and water before and after surgery and allowed to fully recover in temperature- and humidity-controlled chambers postoperatively. All possible efforts were made to reduce animal suffering. Bupivacaine was used for analgesia, hydration and wet chow was provided immediately postoperatively and daily thereafter, and animals were euthanized at humane endpoints. For euthanasia, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde.\n\nInitial Bleed Volume\nPotential differences in collagenase-induced bleed volumes in WT and Hp\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice that could confound the conclusions of this study were evaluated by measuring the brain Hb content in both groups at the peak of bleeding after collagenase-induced ICH as we have described (\nLeclerc et al., 2017\n). A separate group of n=4 WT and n=5 Hp\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice were used. At 5h after collagenase-induced ICH, mice were euthanized as described above, but without PFA perfusion. After quick removal of the brain, the olfactory bulbs, cerebellum, and contralateral hemisphere were discarded and the ipsilateral hemisphere was snap frozen. Samples were subsequently thawed, homogenized, centrifuged at 14,000rpm and 4\u00b0C for 30min, and the protein content of the supernatant was estimated using the bicinchoninic assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Hb content was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Biomatik, Wilmington, DE) according to manufacturer instructions after diluting samples 1:20,000 in the kit-provided sample diluent. Results are expressed as the concentration of Hb normalized to total protein content.\n\nAutologous Blood ICH Model\nICH was induced using the autologous whole blood double infusion model (30\u03bcl total infusion) (\nLok et al., 2011\n). Mice were anesthetized with continuous isoflurane (4% induction, 1.5\u20132% maintenance) and immobilized on a stereotactic frame (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). After making a small midline sagittal incision in the skin overlying the skull, a craniotomy was performed 0.5mm anterior and 2.4mm right relative to the bregma. Autologous blood was collected onto a sterile surface by needle prick of the tail artery after first cleaning the area with 70% ethanol and gently warming the tail for 2min with a heat lamp. Blood was immediately drawn into PE-20 tubing (Instech, Plymouth Meeting, PA) connected on one side to a 50ml syringe with a 26-gauge luer tip needle (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV) located within an automated injector, and the other side to a 26-gauge needle with the beveled end inserted into the tubing. The blunt end of this needle was inserted 3.9mm ventral from the skull surface, removed to 3.6mm, and left in place for 7min. After the waiting period, 10\u03bcl of blood was infused, followed by an additional 5min waiting period prior to the second infusion of 20\u03bcl. All injections were performed at 1.0\u03bcl/min using an automated injector (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). The needle was left in place for 10min after the second infusion prior to slow removal over a 25min period.\n\nCollagenase ICH Model\nICH was induced using our described model (\nLeclerc et al., 2017\n). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and immobilized in a stereotactic frame. An injection of 0.04U collagenase type VII-S (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in 0.4 \u03bcl of sterile water was performed at a 40\u00b0 angle from the vertical plane into the left hemisphere at 0.2\u03bcl/min using an automated injector. The injection site was 3.6mm ventral from the skull surface at 0.0mm anterior and 3.8mm left relative to bregma. The needle was left in place for 5min and then slowly removed over a 15min period to prevent backflow.\n\nFunctional outcomes\nOpen field locomotor activity, rotarod, and neurological deficit scores (NDS) were used to assess functional outcomes daily post-ICH as we have described (\nLeclerc et al., 2015b\n). Behavioral tests were performed during the awaken phase (dark cycle) in the same order and at the same time of day, with 1h rest between tests.\n\nMeasurement of Serum Hemopexin Levels\nSerum Hpx levels were measured in the 10d young and old cohorts of mice that underwent ICH as well as a separate group of na\u00efve n=5 WT and n=4 Hp\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice. ELISA was used according to the manufacturer instructions (Life Diagnostics, West Chester, PA).\n\nHistology and quantification\nHistology and quantification were conducted as we have described (\nLeclerc et al., 2017\n). Briefly, ten sets of sixteen sections equally distributed throughout the hematoma and anteroposterior brain regions were processed. Cresyl violet staining was used to assess lesion and hematoma volume, tissue injury, percent ipsilateral hemispheric enlargement, and ventricular volume. Perls\u2019 iron staining was used to evaluate iron. Primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry include heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) (1:3000; Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY), Hb (1:500; MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA), immunoglobulin G (IgG) (1:300; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:1000; Dako, Santa Clara, CA), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM) (1:400; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (1:500; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX). For a given stain and endpoint, slides for all animals were simultaneously stained. All slides were scanned using an Aperio ScanScope CS and analyzed with ImageScope software (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany).\nFor quantification of total brain pathology (lesion and hematoma volume, tissue injury, ipsilateral hemispheric enlargement, ventricular volume, HO1, iron, IgG, and Hb), all sections were quantified. For GFAP, five sections representing maximal lesion area were analyzed. For PECAM and VEGF, three sections representing maximal lesion area were used. Lesion Volume: injured brain areas were outlined. Using these areas, known distances between sections, and section thickness, a total brain lesion volume was calculated. Percent ipsilateral hemispheric enlargement: ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were outlined, volumes were calculated similarly to lesion volume, and the following equation was used: 100*[(ipsilateral-contralateral)/contralateral]. A positive pixel count algorithm was used for quantification of appropriately outlined brain regions for hematoma volume, iron, and immunohistochemical stains. These algorithms were tuned for each stain such that the appropriate signal level was detected (\nLeclerc et al., 2015b\n). Hematoma volume: after running the algorithm, the number of blood positive pixels were converted into an area using pixel size and a volume was calculated in an identical manner to lesion volume. Tissue injury: hematoma volume was subtracted from total lesion volume. Hb: data are presented as ipsilateral hemisphere signal normalized for contralateral hemisphere signal. GFAP: cortical astrogliosis was analyzed by placing 1000\u00d71000 pixel boxes in the motor cortex. Perihematomal astrogliosis was analyzed by circling the ipsilateral and contralateral striatum, and the lesion area was excluded such that the ipsilateral analysis represents perihematomal quantification rather than a total striatal analysis. Thalamic and hippocampal astrogliosis were analyzed by circling the respective brain regions. Hemispheric astrogliosis was analyzed by circling the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, excluding the lesion area. The perihematomal area was quantified to evaluate the local inflammatory response to the ICH, and the cortex and thalamus were quantified due to its connection with the striatum/perihematoma and their involvement in motor function. Hippocampal astrogliosis was evaluated due to the known cognitive impairment that occurs after an ICH (\nXiong et al., 2016\n). Hemispheric astrogliosis was quantified to determine the global response to ICH. All GFAP measurements were calculated using positive pixel count normalized by the area of analysis. Iba1: microgliosis was determined for the cortex, striatum, thalamus, hippocampus, and hemisphere using the same procedures as for GFAP. PECAM: cortical and hematomal PECAM expression were analyzed by outlining the motor cortex and hematoma region, respectively. Ipsilateral data are reported. VEGF: was analyzed identical to PECAM, except data are presented as relative ipsilateral to contralateral signal. To specifically analyze the effect of genotype on ICH outcomes independent of the observed differences in lesion volume between the groups, each individual data point were also normalized with the corresponding lesion volume.\n\nStatistics\nStatistics were performed using SAS-JMP in consultation with a biostatistician. Mortality was evaluated using a \u03c7\n2\ntest. Neurobehavioral endpoint and anatomical data were analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t-tests. Neurobehavioral regressions were analyzed by repeated measures linear mixed modeling to account for identified baseline differences between groups and allow estimations of mortality dropouts. Additionally, the slopes were compared on these regressions to determine if differences in neurologic recovery rates were present between the genotypes. All data sets were checked for normality and differences in variance, and data was transformed or a nonparametric test was used as applicable. Data are expressed as mean\u00b1SEM with p<0.05 considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAdult male C57Bl/6 mice (7\u20139 weeks old for behavioral and biochemical studies, 3 weeks old for Ca\n2+\nimaging and electrophysiology studies) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). Mice were housed 4 per cage in a temperature controlled (68\u201372\u00b0 F) room on a 14:10 hour light/dark cycle (dark hours from 8PM-6AM) and given food and water\nad libitum\n. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Kentucky in accordance with the American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines.\n\nComplete Freund\u2019s Adjuvant (CFA) model of inflammatory pain\nAnimals were allowed at least four days to habituate to the facility before the beginning of the study. Immediately following baseline assessment of mechanical thresholds, male C57Bl/6 mice, were lightly restrained and subcutaneously injected with CFA (5\u201310 \u03bcl, non-diluted) under the ventromedial surface of the left hindpaw. In electrophysiological and behavioral studies, sham mice were injected with an equal volume of saline to control for needle puncture and injectate volume.\n\nIntrathecal drug administration\nUnanesthetized mice were lightly restrained and a 30 G needle attached to a Hamilton microsyringe was inserted between the L5/L6 vertebrae. After intrathecal placement was confirmed by the presence of a reflexive tail flick as previously described (\nFairbanks, 2003\n), 5 \u03bcl of NTX or saline and 5 ul of naspm or saline were injected together.\n\nTactile threshold\nMice were acclimated for 30 \u2013 60 min in the testing environment within a rectangular plastic box (15\u00d74\u00d74 cm; 3 white opaque walls and 1 clear wall) on a raised metal mesh platform. Baseline testing was conducted prior to and after injury and at various time points after drug injection (as indicated by an arrow in the figures). To evaluate mechanical hypersensitivity (hyperalgesia) we used a logarithmically increasing set of 8 von Frey filaments (Stoelting, Illinois), ranging in gram force from 0.007 to 6.0 g. These were applied perpendicular to the ventral-medial plantar hindpaw surface with sufficient force to cause a slight bending of the filament. A positive response was characterized as a rapid withdrawal of the paw away from the stimulus fiber within 4\u20135 s. Using Dixon\u2019s up\u2013down statistical method, modified by Chaplan et al. (\nChaplan et al., 1994\n), the 50% withdrawal mechanical threshold score was calculated for each mouse and then averaged across the experimental groups.\n\nAdult mouse spinal cord slices\nMice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and perfused transcardially over the course of approximately one minute with 10 ml of ice-cold sucrose-containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (sucrose-aCSF) that contained (in mM): NaCl 95, KCl 1.8, KH\n2\nPO\n4\n1.2, CaCl\n2\n0.5, MgSO\n4\n7, NaHCO\n3\n26, glucose 15, sucrose 50, kynurenic acid 1, oxygenated with 95% O\n2\n, 5% CO\n2\n; pH 7.4 (\nDoolen et al., 2012\n). The lumbar spinal cord was rapidly isolated by laminectomy from the cervical enlargement to the cauda equina, placed in oxygenated ice-cold sucrose-aCSF, cleaned of dura mater and ventral roots, cut in the transverse orientation across the lumbar enlargement, and glued with cyanoacrylate to an agar block (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) on the stage of a Campden 5000mz vibratome (Lafayette, IN). Lumbar segments L3-L4 were cut (300 \u03bcm ipsilateral sagittal slice with dorsal root attached for electrophysiology; 450 \u03bcm transverse slices for Ca\n2+\nimaging) in ice-cold sucrose-aCSF using minimal forward speed (0.01 \u2013 0.04 mm/s) and maximum vibration (50 Hz).\n\nCalcium imaging\nSlices were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with Fura-2 AM (10 mM) in oxygenated normal aCSF that contained pluronic acid (0.1%) and (in mM): NaCl 127, KCl 1.8, KH\n2\nPO\n4\n1.2, CaCl\n2\n2.4, MgSO\n4\n1.3, NaHCO\n3\n26, glucose 15, followed by a 20 min de-esterification period (\nCorder et al., 2013\n;\nDoolen et al., 2012\n). Slices were perfused at 1\u20132 ml/min with normal aCSF in a recording chamber (RC-25, Warner instruments, Hamden, CT) mounted on a Nikon FN-1 upright microscope with a 79000 ET FURA2 Hybrid filter set and a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ\n2\ncamera. Relative intracellular Ca\n2+\nlevels were determined by measuring the change in ratio of fluorescence emission at 510 nm in response to excitation at 340 and 380 nm. Paired images were collected at 1 frame/second. Relative intracellular Ca\n2+\nlevels were evaluated in single cells by creating a region of interest over each cell body (with preference given to profiles with high fluorescence at 380 nm) using Nikon Elements software, and then calculated as the peak magnitude of the \u0394 340/380 ratio. Regions of interest (ROIs) that did not respond to glutamate (~20%), and cells that displayed a large run-down in response to 1.0 mM glutamate (cells with more than a 40% decrease in glutamate-evoked Ca\n2+\ntransients from the beginning to the end of the recording session yielded inconsistent results, ~20%) were excluded. Slices were studied within 8 hours of dissection. At 20x magnification, we observed 8.4 \u00b1 0.6 of glutamate-responsive fura-2-positive cells per field of view. Cells from 1\u20132 slices were averaged within each animal, and n was defined by number of animals.\n\nElectrophysiology\nWhole-cell patch-clamp recordings were collected with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Glass pipette patch electrodes were filled with a cesium-based solution containing (in mM): Cs-Glu 130, CsCl 10, HEPES 10, EGTA 11, CaCl\n2\n1, Mg-ATP 2 and Na\n4\n-GTP 0.2, pH 7.2 (~300 mOsm). 5 mM Qx314.Cl and 0.1 mM spermine tetrahydrochloride were added to the pipette solution. Pipette resistance ranged from 4 to 6 M\u2126. Currents were filtered at 4\u20136 kHz through a four-pole low-pass Bessel filter and digitally sampled at 20 kHz (Digidata 1440A with pClamp 10.3 software; Molecular Devices).\nSlices were perfused at 3 ml/min with normal aCSF in the recording chamber (RC-27, Warner instruments, Hamden, CT) mounted on an upright Olympus BX51W1 microscope and studied within 5 hours of dissection. All recordings were conducted at RT. With a glass suction electrode, the attached dorsal root was exposed to electrical stimuli of increasing intensity (0.1 \u2013 3 mA), 0.1 ms duration, and 0.02 Hz frequency to evoke C-fiber mediated EPSCs (\nNakatsuka et al., 2000\n;\nTorsney and MacDermott, 2006\n). Monosynaptic EPSCs in laminae II neurons were selected with the following criteria: 1) constant response latency (i.e., response variability or \u201cjitter\u201d < 200 \u03bcs) even as the intensity of dorsal root stimulation (DRS) was increased; and 2) EPSC response failures at frequency stimulation \u2265 2 Hz (C-fiber stimulations fail to elicit consistent action potential responses above 2 Hz (\nNakatsuka et al., 2000\n)). To pharmacologically isolate AMPAR-mediated EPSCs, recordings were performed in the presence of bicuculline (10 \u03bcM),\nCGP55845\n(2 \u03bcM), strychnine (2 \u03bcM) and AP5 (50 \u03bcM). All AMPAR-mediated EPSCs were confirmed at the end of each experiment by their extinction following CNQX (100 \u03bcM). AMPAR responses were measured while voltage-clamping the neuron at holding potentials (3 to 5 responses/potential) between \u221260 and +60 mV. The rectification index (RI) was calculated as follows:\nE\nP\nS\nC\n\u2212\n60\n\u2212\n60\n\u2212\nE\nr\ne\nv\n/\nE\nP\nS\nC\n+\n40\n+\n40\n\u2212\nE\nr\ne\nv\n.\n\nTissue harvest and subcellular fractionation for western blot\nMice were decapitated, and the spinal cord was extruded by pressure ejection with cold saline from a 10 ml syringe with a blunt 20\u201322 gauge needle. The lumbar enlargement (4 mm) was first halved sagittally and then halved dorso-ventrally. The left (ipsilateral to injury) dorsal quadrant was immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. For each sample, quadrants from 3\u20134 mice were pooled and homogenized in 1 ml of sucrose buffer (320 mM sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4) using a glass-grinding vessel with rotating Teflon pestle. Each sample was processed to obtain fractions enriched for synaptic and extrasynaptic membranes (\nFerrario et al., 2011\n;\nGoebel-Goody et al., 2009\n). This method relies on the insolubility of postsynaptic densities (PSD) and synaptic junctions in Triton X-100. The homogenate was sonicated and a 100 \u03bcl aliquot was stored at \u221280\u00b0 C for determination of protein levels in total homogenate (TH) samples. The remainder of the homogenate was centrifuged (1,000 \u00d7 g, 10 min, 4\u00b0 C). The pellet (P1) was discarded and the supernatant (S1) was centrifuged (10,000 \u00d7 g, 15 min, 4\u00b0 C). The supernatant (S2) was discarded and the crude synaptosomal pellet (P2) was re-suspended in 0.5 ml of Triton X-100 (0.5%, v/v) detergent extraction buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.5) using a motorized pellet-pestle mixing/grinding rod. The suspension was incubated with gentle 360\u00b0 rotation (4\u00b0 C, 20 min) and centrifuged (21,100 \u00d7 g, 20 min, 4\u00b0 C). The insoluble, synaptic fraction (PSD) was re-suspended in 75 \u03bcl of detergent extraction buffer, solubilized with 35 \u03bcl of 1% SDS. The PSD fraction was sonicated, boiled (5 min, 95\u00b0 C), and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C until protein concentration was determined.\n\nWestern Blotting\nBio-Rad DC protein assay (Hercules, CA) was used to quantify the total protein concentration of each sample. Next, equal amounts of protein (20 \u03bcg for total homogenate, 10 \u03bcg for postsynaptic density samples) were separated with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Novex\u2122 4\u201312% Tris-Glycine Mini Protein Gels, Wedgewell 10-well, 1.0 mm) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Non-specific binding was blocked using Odyssey Blocking Buffer (Licor, Lincoln, NE) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with gentle rotation in primary antibody solution (Odyssey Blocking Buffer with 0.1% Tween-20) containing: anti-GluA1 (1:1000, Abcam, #ab32436), anti-GluA2 (1:1000, Millipore Sigma, #MAB397), anti-GluA4 (1:500, Millipore Sigma, #AB1508), anti-PSD95 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, #2507) or anti-synaptophysin (1:2000, Abcam, #ab14692). Anti-\u03b2-actin (1:5000, Millipore Sigma, #MAB1501) was used as the loading control. After incubation, the membrane was washed with 1X TBST (3 \u00d7 5 min) and immersed in fluorescent secondary antibody (1:10,000 donkey anti-rabbit IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor\n\u00ae\n680) #ab175772; 1:10,000 donkey anti-mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor\n\u00ae\n790) #ab186699), Odyssey Blocking Buffer with 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 hour. The membrane was then washed (2 \u00d7 5 min in 1X TBST; 2 \u00d7 5 min in 1X TBS) and scanned with Odyssey Imaging System V3.0 (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Pixel intensity was quantified with Nikon Elements Software. Relative expression was calculated as a percentage of expression levels from uninflamed animals run on the same gel and was corrected for equal loading by dividing by \u03b2-actin intensity.\n\nChemicals\nFura-2 AM and Pluronic F-127 were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Glutamate was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Naltrexone (cat #0677), naspm trihydrochloride (cat. #2766) and IEM-1460 (cat. #1636) were purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Minneapolis, MN).\n\nStatistics\nStatistical analyses for behavioral studies was performed first using a two-way ANOVA with dose and time as factors. Significant two-way ANOVA was followed by one-way ANOVA collapsed across time to area under the curve. This analysis was followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test (GraphPad Prism 7.03, San Diego, CA). For Ca\n2+\nimaging studies, two-way ANOVA with injury as the first factor and drug as the repeated measure was used. For electrophysiology studies, groups were compared with Mann\u2013Whitney U-test. To compare the relative abundance of protein in spinal cord samples from uninflamed compared to injured mice, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test was used."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal procedures were performed in accordance with the policies of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Wright State University. Mice were bred from a colony of ClCn1\nadr-mto2J\nmice (a mouse model of myotonia congenita, ClC\nadr\nmice) that was established using mice purchased from Jackson Labs. Mice were genotyped by performing PCR on tail DNA using GGT GGG GGA AAG GGG TAC AG and CTG CCT AGC CTC ACA TCT CCT TAC as primers. The amplified DNA was sent for sequencing using GGT GGG GGA AAG GGG TAC AG as the primer. Mice with myotonia are homozygous for a deletion of CCCCCT to CCCCT, which causes a frame shift. We previously had identified mice with myotonia by inability to right themselves (\nNovak, et al., 2015\n). Using genotyping, we confirmed our ability to correctly identify 100% affected mice by phenotype. Most experimental mice were selected by phenotype without genetic confirmation. For some in vitro experiments, myotonia was induced by treatment of muscle from unaffected littermates (both heterozygous and wild type mice) with 100 \u03bcM 9-Anthracene-carboxylic acid (9AC, Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue # A-4678) to block Cl\n\u2212\nchannels. Both male and female mice were used from 2 months to 6 months of age. Symptomatic mice were supplied with moistened chow paste (Irradiated Rodent Diet; Harlan Teklad 2918) on the floor of the cage.\n\nElectrophysiology\nRecordings were performed as previously described (\nHawash, et al., 2017\n;\nNovak, et al., 2015\n). Briefly, prior to removal of extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle for recording, mice were killed by CO\n2\ninhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Muscles were maintained and recorded from at 21-23 \u00b0C. The recording chamber was continually perfused with Ringer solution containing (in mM): 118 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 1.5 CaCl\n2\n, 0.7 MgSO\n4\n, 26.2 NaHCO\n3\n, 1.7 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 5.5 glucose, and maintained at pH 7.3-7.4 by aeration with 95% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\n. To prevent contraction, muscles were loaded with 50\u03bcM BTS (N-benzyl-\np\n-toluenesulfonamide, Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan, catalogue #B3082) dissolved in DMSO for 45 minutes prior to recording.\nMuscle was stained with 10 \u03bcM 4-(4-diethylaminostyrl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide (Molecular Probes, catalogue #D289 (discontinued)) for 3 minutes prior to recording and fibers were impaled with 2 sharp microelectrodes filled with 3 M KCl solution containing 1 mM sulforhodamine 101 (Sigma-Aldrich, Catalogue # S7635) to visualize the electrodes with epifluorescence. Electrode resistance was 15 to 25 M\u03a9. Retigabine was purchased from Cayman Chemicals (catalogue # 21449) and dissolved in DMSO. Total DMSO concentration was kept below 0.1%.\nCapacitance compensation was optimized prior to recording. Fibers with resting potentials more depolarized than \u221274 mV were excluded from analysis. Action potential voltage threshold was defined as the voltage at which the dV/dt was 10 mV/ms. Input resistance was calculated by injecting hyperpolarizing current for 200 ms and measuring the steady state hyperpolarization. The amount of current injected was adjusted to keep the hyperpolarization under 15 mV. Altering the amplitude of current injection yielded the same value for input resistance when the hyperdepolarization was kept under 15 mV (data not shown). The time constant was measured as the time taken for the voltage to reach 63% of the steady state value. The mean slope of the afterdepolarization (AfD) was calculated as follows: the voltage difference between action potential threshold and the most negative potential reached during repolarization following each action potential was divided by the time from maximum repolarization to action potential threshold.\n\nIn vivo force recording\nWe employed an\nin vivo\nmuscle force preparation that we used previously to study weakness (\nNardelli, et al., 2016\n). Mice were anesthetized via isoflurane inhalation; then the distal tendon of the calf muscle (medial and lateral gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles) was surgically detached and attached to a force transduction motor. The common peroneal, sural and posterior tibial nerves were crushed. The sciatic nerve was then stimulated while isometric muscle force generation was measured. Muscle temperature was monitored with a laser probe and maintained between 29\u00b0C and 31\u00b0C with a heat lamp. The muscle was kept moist by applying mineral oil. Force recordings were performed before and 30 minutes following injection of 30 mg/kg retigabine. For injection, retigabine was dissolved in 20 ul of DMSO. This was added to 180 \u03bcl of sterile water, which caused the retigabine to precipitate. The solution with precipitate was then sonicated for 30s, which broke the precipitate into small pieces, and the solution was injected ip using a 27 gauge needle.\n\nBehavioral Measurements\nNine ClC\nadr\nmice were treated with either retigabine or vehicle and motor performance was measured 30 min after ip injection, with the examiner blind to the treatment administered. Thirty minutes was chosen as it was the time of greatest efficacy of retigabine against myotonia in studies in which muscle force was measured. Motor function was analyzed using behavioral measures we have used previously to study the effect of therapy on severity of myotonia (\nNovak, et al., 2015\n). These included the mean time of three trials of the righting reflex and the mean of three trials on a modified rotarod test in which mice were placed on a stationary rod; then the rod was turned on to a single, intermediate speed. This modification was done to prevent warm up, which can occur as the speed of the rod is gradually increased. The averaged post-treatment righting times and the averaged post-treatment time on the rotarod were compared between vehicle and retigabine. As the same mice were used for all behavioral experiments, at least 2 days were given between studies to allow time for drug elimination. The plasma half-life for retigabine in mice is 7 hours (\nZhou, et al., 2015\n) so 2 days represents more than 6 half-lives.\n\nStatistical analysis.\nFor most experiments, a repeated measures ANOVA was run with either dose as a repeated factor or the mouse as a repeated factor. For the retigabine dose experiments, a random effect was included to account for the correlated measurements that can result from multiple comparisons with the control value. SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) was used for all ANOVA analyses. The \u201csimulate\u201d post hoc multiple comparison procedure was used for all post hoc multiple comparison. Origin software (OriginLab, Northhampton, MA) was used to perform paired t-tests for analysis of in vivo before and after retigabine measures of muscle force from the same mouse. All data are presented as means \u00b1 SEM.\np\n< 0.05 was considered to be significant. Sample sizes were chosen based on the lab\u2019s previous experiences in the calculation of experimental variability. The numbers of mice and fibers used are described in the corresponding figure legends and text. For statistical analysis n was the number of mice."

After one week of acclimatization, all rats underwent a single day of beam-walk training, which consisted of 3\u20135 successive approximation trials to traverse the beam in under 5 s with a score of 7. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh. Every attempt was made to limit the number of rats used and to minimize suffering.\n\nSurgery\nControlled cortical impact (CCI) injury was produced as previously described (\nKline at al., 2002a\n,\nb\n,\n2010\n,\n2012\n;\nBondi et al., 2014a\n;\nRadabaugh et al., 2017\n). Briefly, surgical anesthesia was induced and maintained with 4% and 2% concentrations of isoflurane, respectively, in 2:1 N\n2\nO:O\n2\n. After endotracheal intubation the rats were secured in a stereotaxic frame and ventilated mechanically. Core temperature was monitored and maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C with a rectal thermistor and heating pad. Employing aseptic procedures, a midline scalp incision was made, the skin and fascia were reflected, and a craniectomy (6 mm in diameter) was made in the right hemisphere with a hand-held trephine. The bone flap was removed and the craniectomy was enlarged further to fit the impact tip (6 mm, flat), which was centered and lowered through the craniectomy until it touched the dura mater. Once confirmed that the impact tip was touching th_S1_Reference27e dura, the rod was retracted, and the impact tip was advanced 2.8 mm farther to produce a brain injury of moderate severity (2.8 mm tissue deformation at 4 m/s). Anesthesia was discontinued immediately after the impact and the incision was promptly closed. The rats were subsequently extubated and assessed for acute neurological outcome. Except for the impact, sham rats underwent all surgical procedures.\n\nAcute neurological evaluation\nHind limb reflexive ability was assessed immediately after the termination of anesthesia by squeezing the rats\u2019 paw every 5 s and recording the time to elicit a withdrawal response. Return of the righting reflex was determined by the time required to turn from the supine to prone position on three consecutive trials.\n\nDrug administration\nAfter surgery and acute neurological evaluation, the rats were randomly assigned to the following groups: TBI + STD + ARIP (0.1 mg/kg; n=10), TBI + STD + VEH (1 mL/kg; n=10), TBI + EE + ARIP (0.1 mg/kg; n=10), TBI + EE + VEH (1 mL/kg; n=10), and respective sham controls (n=3 per group). ARIP (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada), was prepared daily by dissolving in dimethyl sulfoxide and saline (1:1) which also served as the vehicle (VEH). The dose of ARIP was chosen based on a dose response study from our group showing it to be the most effective (\nPhelps et al., 2017\n). Treatments began 24 h after CCI injury or sham surgery and were provided intraperitoneally once daily (\nafter\nthe daily behavioral assessments to circumvent sedative effects that may confound the results) for 19 days.\n\nMotor performance: beam-walk time and score\nMotor function was assessed using a beam-walk task originally characterized by\nFeeney et al. (1982)\n. Briefly, the rats were trained to traverse a long, narrow, elevated (100 cm, 2.5 cm, 90 cm, respectively) wooden beam to enter a darkened goal box to escape aversive stimuli, which consisted of white noise and a bright light directed at the start point. Performance on this beam-walk task is measured as time to traverse the entire length of the beam and quality of ambulation, which is quantified using a rating scale from 1 to 7, where a score of 1 reflects an inability of the rat to pull itself up onto the beam, 2 indicates an inability to ambulate across the beam, 3 refers to ambulation without placing the injured hind limb on the beam, 4 reflects ambulation with the injured hind limb on the beam but not aiding in forward locomotion, 5 indicates ambulation with the injured hind limb aiding in forward locomotion but slipping off the beam more than 50% of the steps, 6 reflects ambulation with the injured hind limb slipping less than 50% of the steps but more than twice, and 7 represents ambulation with the injured hind limb slipping two or fewer times. Rats were trained for two days prior to TBI or sham injury to traverse the beam in under 6 s and earn a score of 7. Rats making no attempt to traverse the beam were encouraged by prodding, which consisted of a gentle tap on the tail or rump with a pencil (\nFeeney et al., 1982\n;\nKline et al., 1994\n). Baseline performance was acquired on the day of surgery. Post-surgical performance was assessed on days 1\u20135 and consisted of a single trial (60 s allotted time). The average daily scores for each subject were used in the statistical analyses.\n\nCognitive performance: spatial learning\nSpatial learning was assessed using a well-established Morris water maze (MWM) task (\nMorris, 1984\n;\nKline et al., 2002a\n,\nb\n,\n2010\n,\n2012\n;\nOlsen et al., 2012\n;\nFolweiler et al., 2017\n; Okigbo et al., 2018). Briefly, the maze consisted of a plastic pool (180 cm diameter; 60 cm high) filled with tap water (26 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) to a depth of 28 cm and was positioned in a room with prominent extra-maze cues. The platform was a clear Plexiglas stand (10 cm diameter, 26 cm high) that was positioned 26 cm from the maze wall in the southwest quadrant and held constant throughout the experiment. Acquisition of spatial learning began on post-operative day 14 and consisted of providing a block of four daily trials for five consecutive days (14\u201318) to locate the escape platform when it was submerged 2 cm below the water surface. On day 19, the platform was raised 2 cm above the water surface to evaluate visible platform performance, which is incorporated as a control procedure to determine the contributions of non-spatial factors (e.g., sensory-motor function, motivation, and visual acuity) on cognitive performance. For each daily block of trials, the rats were placed in the pool facing the wall at each of the four possible start locations (north, east, south, and west) in a quasi-randomized manner. Each trial lasted until the rat climbed onto the platform or until 120 s had elapsed, whichever occurred first. The rats that failed to locate the escape platform within the allotted time were manually guided to it. All rats remained on the platform for 30 s before being placed in a heated incubator between trials (4-min inter-trial interval). The times of the 4 daily trials for each rat were averaged and used in the statistical analyses.\n\nCognitive performance: memory retention\nOne day after the final acquisition training (day 19), but before the visible platform test, all rats were given a single probe trial to measure memory retention. Briefly, the platform was removed from the pool and the rats were placed in the pool from the location point most distal to the quadrant where the platform was previously located (i.e., \u201ctarget quadrant\u201d) and allowed to freely explore the pool for 30 s. The time spent in the target quadrant was recorded and used in the statistical analyses. The data were obtained using ANY-maze video tracking software.\n\nHistology: cortical lesion volume\nTwenty-one days after surgery the rats were anesthetized with Fatal-Plus\u00ae (0.3 mL, i.p.) and perfused transcardially with 200 mL 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) followed by 300 mL 4% paraformaldehyde. The heads were immersed in the perfusate and one week later the brains were extracted, post-fixed further, dehydrated with alcohols, and embedded in paraffin. Coronal sections (7\u03bcm thick) were cut at 1-mm intervals through the lesion on a rotary microtome and mounted on Superfrost\n\u00ae\n/Plus glass microscope slides. After drying, the sections were deparaffinized in xylenes, rehydrated, and stained with Cresyl violet. An observer blinded to experimental conditions analyzed cortical lesion volumes (mm\n3\n) by calculating the area of the lesion (mm\n2\n), which was done by outlining the inferred area of missing cortical tissue for each section (typically 5\u20137) taken at 1-mm intervals as previously reported (\nOlsen et al., 2012\n;\nMonaco et al., 2013\n,\n2014\n).\n\nStatistical analyses\nAll analyses were performed using Statview 5.0.1 software (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA) on data collected by blinded experimenters. The motor and cognitive analyses were conducted using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The acute neurological data (i.e., hind limb withdrawal reflex and righting reflex) as well as the visible platform, probe trial, swim speed, and cortical lesion volume data were analyzed using one-factor ANOVAs. When significance was revealed with the overall ANOVA, the Newman-Keuls post-hoc test was used to determine specific group differences. The results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (S.E.M.) and were considered significant when\np\n\u2264 0.05.\n\nResults\nThere were no surgical or health issues (e.g., consistent weight loss or visual deficits as indicated by all rats being able to find the visible platform) throughout the study and thus the statistical analyses included the data from all 52 rats. No differences were observed in any behavioral measure among the sham controls (\np\n\u2019s > 0.05), so their data were pooled into one group designated as SHAM.\n\nAcute neurological evaluation\nNo differences were observed among the TBI groups in hind limb withdrawal reflex after a brief paw pinch [left range = 148.9 \u00b1 4.8 s to 162.9 \u00b1 5.7 s,\np\n> 0.05; right range = 144.7 \u00b1 4.8 s to 158.4 \u00b1 6.0 s,\np\n> 0.05] or for righting reflex [range 326.1 \u00b1 14.6 s to 369.8 \u00b1 23.7 s,\np\n> 0.05] following the cessation of anesthesia. The lack of significant differences with these acute neurological indices suggests that all TBI groups experienced equivalent levels of injury and anesthesia. Sham rats had reflexes that were significantly quicker than TBI rats: paw pinch [left = 19.1 \u00b1 1.1 s; right = 14.4 \u00b1 1.2 s] and righting reflex [126.5 \u00b1 5.6 s].\n\nMotor performance: beam-walk time and score\nPrior to surgery, each rat traversed the beam and entered the goal box in under 6 s (\nFig. 1\n) with no more than 2 slips of the affected hind limb (\nFig. 2\n). After CCI injury, there was a significant delay in time to traverse the beam as indicated by the ANOVA, which revealed significant Group [F\n4,47\n= 14.728,\np\n< 0.0001] and Day [F\n5,235\n= 74.830,\np\n< 0.0001] differences, as well as a significant Group \u00d7 Day interaction [F20,235 = 5.924,\np\n< 0.0001]. There was also a corresponding increase in affected hind limb foot slips as the ANOVA again revealed significant Group [F\n4,47\n= 34.564,\np\n< 0.0001] and Day [F\n5,235\n= 93.205,\np\n< 0.0001] differences, as well as a significant Group \u00d7 Day interaction [F\n20,235\n= 6.885,\np\n< 0.0001]. According to the post-hoc analysis, all TBI groups, regardless of housing or treatment, performed significantly worse than the SHAM controls on time to traverse the beam and beam score [\np\n< 0.05; Figs.\n1\nand\n2\n, respectively]. The TBI + EE + VEH and TBI + EE + ARIP groups did not differ from one another on either motor assessment [\np\n> 0.05], but both performed better on time to traverse the beam and foot slips relative to the TBI + STD + VEH group [\np\n< 0.05]. The TBI + STD + ARIP group exhibited a better beam-walk score relative to the TBI + STD + VEH group [\np\n< 0.05].\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nMean (\u00b1 S.E.M.) time (sec) to traverse an elevated narrow beam prior to, and after, TBI or SHAM injury.

No other comparisons were significant (\np\n> 0.05). n = 10 for each TBI group and 12 for the SHAM controls.\n\nCognitive performance: acquisition of spatial learning, visible platform, and swim speed\nThe ANOVA for spatial learning revealed significant Group [F\n4,47\n= 8.532,\np\n< 0.0001] and Day [F\n4,188\n= 15.802,\np\n< 0.0001] differences, as well as a significant Group \u00d7 Day interaction [F\n16,188\n= 1.897,\np\n= 0.0229]. The post-hoc analysis showed that all TBI groups required more time to find the escape platform relative to the SHAM controls [\np\n< 0.05;\nFig. 3\n]. The TBI + EE + VEH, TBI + EE + ARIP, and TBI + STD + ARIP groups performed better than the TBI + STD + VEH group [\np\n< 0.05] and did not differ from one another [\np\n> 0.05]. There was no difference among the TBI groups in the time to locate the visible platform [\np\n> 0.05], but they all required more time than the SHAM group [\np\n< 0.05]. Swim speed did not differ among the groups (range = 26.1 \u00b1 1.8 cm/s to 30.5 \u00b1 1.2 cm/s;\np\n> 0.05).\nFig. 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nMean (\u00b1 S.E.M.) time (sec) to locate a hidden platform in the MWM. *\np\n< 0.05 vs. TBI + STD + VEH.\n#\np\n< 0.05 vs. all TBI groups, regardless of treatments.

The post-hoc analysis revealed that memory retention, as demonstrated by a greater percentage of the 30 sec allotted time spent in the target quadrant, was improved in the TBI + EE + VEH and TBI + EE + ARIP relative to the TBI + STD + VEH group (33.6 \u00b1 1.9 %, 34.7 \u00b1 1.5 %, and 26.0 \u00b1 2.4 %, respectively [\np\n< 0.05]. The SHAM group (39.3 \u00b1 1.1%) did not differ from the two EE groups, but was better than the TBI + STD + VEH and TBI + STD + ARIP (29.4 \u00b1 3.5 %) groups (\nFig. 4\n). No other comparisons were significant.\nFig. 4.\nOpen in a new tab\nMean (\u00b1 S.E.M.) percent time spent in the target quadrant.

    "Methods": "2.1. Animal husbandry\nMale ICR mice weighing 25\u201330 g were kept five per cage under a constant 12 h light/dark cycle at room temperature. Food and water were available ad libitum. For experimental group, at least 6 different mice were used. The ethics committee of the Sackler Faculty of Medicine approved the experimental protocol, in compliance with the guidelines for animal experimentation of the National Institutes of Health.\n\n2.2. Blast trauma model\nThe blast-induced procedures took place in the experimental site of \u201cTamar Explosives\u201d and of \u201cSadwin Consultancy\u201d in central Israel (\nRubovitch et al. 2011\n). Mice (both blast and sham) were anesthetized with an i.p. mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), a combination that induces deep anesthesia and still enables spontaneous respiration. Mice were held in a restricted plastic net in a holder clamped to the floor with screws, which fixed their position but did not protect them from the blast (\nFig. 1A\n). Tied to each holder next to the mouse was a gauge, measuring blast levels (in PSI) and temperature. The explosion device was constructed as a cast of 500 g TNT. We used different distances between the explosive device and the animals in order to obtain different levels of blast intensity (\nFig. 1B\n). The mice at a distance of 4 m were exposed to 5.5 psi peak over-pressure. The animals, pressure gauges and the explosive charges were elevated 1.0 m above ground level. All animals used in this experiment were exposed to a single explosion, on the same trial, such that all experimental parameters are equal. Each animal was anatomically positioned such that the angle and distance relative to the blast was identical. The pressures at both distances were measured \u2018side-on\u2019 with Free-Field ICP\u00ae Blast Pressure Sensor \u201cpencil gauges\u201d (PCB Piezoelectronics, Depew, NY, USA; Model 137). The recorded blast waves showed the \u201cdirect\u201d shock wave and the reflected wave from the ground, as expected. There was also a reflected wave from the embankment surrounding the arena that was insignificant relative to the direct and ground reflected pressure waves. The sampling rate was 61.25 kHz or 16 microseconds between readings on all channels. The pressure-time curves were recorded for each experiment.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nMouse model of mild blast TBI. (A) Anesthetized mice were held in a plastic net in a holder at a distance of 4 m from an explosive charge containing 500 g TNT. The explosion generates approximately 5.5psi peak over-pressure at the 4 m distance. The measured peak over-pressure for this experiment was 37.9kPa (5.4969psi). The animals, pressure gauges and the explosive charges were elevated 1.0m above ground level. (B) The rows are situated 4 (b) and 7 (c) meters from the TNT cast (a). Only the 4 m distance was used in this study. Each row had space for 12 mice and two pressure gauges were mounted at the ends of each platform (d). (\nRubovitch et al. 2011\n).\n\n2.3. Dendritic analysis\nPhosphate buffered saline followed by 4% neutral buffered formalin was used to perfuse mice 72 h days post injury. Brains were placed in 10% formalin overnight at 4 \u00b0C and then cryoprotected in 15% sucrose for 24 h. Formalin-fixed tissue blocks (2\u20133 mm thick in the coronal plane) incorporated the cortical samples and were stained using the Rapid Golgi method. Fixed tissue blocks were first placed in potassium dichromate and osmium tetroxide for approximately 6 days, then transferred to 0.75% silver nitrate for approximately 40 h. Blocks were dehydrated using increasing concentrations of alcohol solutions and ethyl ether, and were then infiltrated with increasing concentrations of nitrocellulose solutions (5%, 10%, 20%, 30%; 1\u20132 days each). Blocks were then placed in plastic molds and hardened with chloroform vapors. Tissue sections were cut to a thickness of 120 \u03bcm in the coronal plane using an AO sliding microtome, cleared in alpha-terpineol, rinsed with xylene, and mounted on slides using Permount. Neurons selected for dendritic analysis had to meet very strict criteria. Selected neurons must have been well impregnated; branches must be totally unobscured by other neurons, glia, blood vessels, or undefined precipitate (a staining by-product), and the soma must have been located within the middle third of the section. Approximately 6 neurons were selected and analyzed per animal. A single blinded observer was used for the entire experiment. A Zeiss brightfield microscope with long-working distance oil-immersion objective lessee and drawing tubes was used to prepare camera lucida drawings for analysis.\nDendritic arbors were analyzed using either of two methods: the Sholl Analysis, which defines the amount and distribution of the dendritic arbor, as well as an estimate of the total dendritic length, and the dendritic Branch Point Analysis (BPA) which characterized the complexity of the arbor based on the number of branch points and dendritic bifurcations within the dendritic domain, as previously described (\nDiamond et al. 2006\n). Additionally, soma sizes were measured using a digitizing tablet linked to the drawing tube of the microscope. We also evaluated the presence of various dendritic spine types using this method.\n\n2.4. Statistical analysis\nGraphPad Prism software was used for statistical analysis. Mean values are depicted \u00b1 standard deviation and were compared using the two tailed\nt\n-test. For Golgi analyses, the values of individual neurons were averaged per brain and statistical analyses considered each biological sample (brain) per group. For Sholl and Branch Point Analyses, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. In both tests\np\n< .05 indicates significance."

    "Methods": "Intravenous Administration\nFollowing intravenous (IV) administration, insulin must navigate the BBB to enter the CNS just like endogenous insulin. The BBB is a network of cells that strictly regulates the transport of substrates into and out of the brain. This obstacle prevents insulin from freely diffusing and thus requires an intact transport system. The rate (\nKi\n) of human insulin transport across the mouse BBB is approximately 0.866 \u00b1 0.086 \u03bcL/g-m (\nBanks et al. 1997a\n), but ranges from 0.2\u20131.7 \u03bcL/g-min based on previously published research (\nBanks et al., 2012\n). This transport was shown to be self-inhibited in a dose dependent manner with 0.12 \u03bcg insulin reducing the\nKi\nfor insulin to 50% (\nBanks et al., 1997a\n). Serum glucose was unaffected with the addition of 0.1 \u03bcg insulin per mouse suggesting the\nKi\nfor insulin is affected more by insulin levels than serum glucose. This also suggests that most of the blood-to-brain signaling mediated by insulin is unrelated to hypoglycemia. The peak amount of insulin present in the brain occurred 2 min after IV injection with a value of 0.045 % of the injected dose taken up per gram of brain. The BBB transport rate of insulin is similar to other peptides produced by the pancreas including amylin and pancreatic polypeptide, while the percent accumulating in the brain is somewhat less than these peptides. These discrepancies are important in instances where insulin is injected as a bolus rather than when blood levels are constant.\nThere is no change in the rate of insulin transport across the BBB with loss of the insulin receptor, suggesting insulin transport can occur independent of the insulin receptor (\nRhea et al., 2018\n). It is likely human insulin crosses the mouse BBB by the same transporter as the endogenous mouse transporter as rat insulin was able to inhibit the transport of human insulin and vice versa (\nBanks et al., 1997b\n). The olfactory bulb has the fastest rate of transport, occurring about 2\u20136 times faster than the remaining brain (\nBanks et al., 1999\n). The rate for BBB insulin transport is influenced by various factors. There is no effect of verapamil (a P-glycoprotein inhibitor) and leptin on the\nKi\nof insulin. The lack of effect of verapamil and leptin demonstrates that the P-glycoprotein and leptin transporter, respectively, is not involved in the BBB transport of insulin. With 100 mg/kg intraperitoneal pretreatment of aluminum, insulin\nKi\nis reduced more than 70%. Indeed, this list of factors is continually growing from aluminum and dexamethasone pretreatment, strain of mouse, brain region, APP expression, hibernation, starvation, obesity, triglycerides, iron status, hyperglycemia, diabetic state, nitric oxide level, and activation of the innate immune system to also include cholecystokinin (\nBanks et al., 2012\n;\nMay et al., 2016\n). A lack of effect of estrogen on insulin BBB transport has also been observed (\nMay et al., 2016\n).\nNot only does insulin have a biological effect within the CNS, but insulin also has several effects on brain endothelial cells as reviewed previously (\nBanks et al., 2012\n). It can directly affect transport of amino acids (\nTagliamonte et al., 1976\n) and leptin (\nKastin and Akerstrom, 2001\n) and increases the expression and function of P-glycoprotein (\nLiu et al., 2009\n). However, insulin does not seem to be important for BBB integrity (\nKondo et al., 2004\n), although this lack of effect may not extend to diabetic animals in which insulin treatment combined with idebenone (a drug developed for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease) improved BBB integrity (\nSun et al., 2015\n). Insulin can differentially affect the distribution of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b21\u201340) and A\u03b2(1\u201342) (\nSwaminathan et al., 2018\n). Peripheral insulin administration can increase plasma clearance of A\u03b2(1\u201340) and decrease the clearance of A\u03b2(1\u201342). Brain elimination of A\u03b2(1\u201340) is decreased 3-fold when insulin is present while elimination of A\u03b2(1\u201342) is increased nearly 2-fold. Thus, the impact of insulin on brain endothelial cells and alteration of other transport systems should be taken into consideration when exploring ways to increase CNS insulin via the IV route.\nIn the SAMP8 mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, insulin BBB transport is not different in the hippocampus between young and aged mice (\nBanks et al., 2000\n). When permeability of insulin at the BBB was investigated in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it was found insulin BBB permeability was increased 1.7-fold in the hippocampus compared to adult B6SJL mice (\nPoduslo et al., 2001\n). Reports on the permeability of the BBB in Alzheimer\u2019s disease vary in the literature which could explain the discrepancies in the differences in insulin transport across the BBB in the various models.\nThe beneficial effects of IV insulin in the CNS have been extended to human studies. IV application of insulin in humans was able to change cerebrocortical activity in lean subjects (\nTschritter et al., 2006\n). In addition, it has been shown peripheral insulin sensitivity correlates with CSF/serum ratios. That is, the lower the ratio, the more insulin-resistant the subject was, independent of body weight (\nHeni et al., 2014\n). Importantly, there is a tight correlation between CSF and serum insulin levels in insulin-sensitive subjects while this correlation is diminished in insulin-resistant subjects suggesting impairment of transport into the brain. A study by Suzanne Craft and colleagues was one of the first to demonstrate that increasing plasma insulin levels improved memory in aged subjects with dementia. In this study the authors showed memory could be enhanced in people with dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type by increasing plasma insulin levels via IV infusion while keeping glucose at a fasting level (\nCraft et al., 1996\n). Unfortunately, insulin cannot readily be given IV to increase brain insulin levels due to the risk for hypoglycemia unless blood glucose levels are kept constant as done in this study. Therefore, it is important to explore other ways in which to increase CNS insulin levels and limit peripheral side effects. Insulin delivery via intracerebroventricular, intranasal, ocular, and intrathecal routes will be discussed in the following sections.\n\nIntracerebroventricular Administration\nIntracerebroventicular (ICV) injections take advantage of delivery of insulin directly to the CSF for distribution of insulin throughout the cranial CSF. Similar injections can be made into specific brain regions, like the hypothalamus or hippocampus, rather than into the ventricle to deliver insulin regionally. ICV insulin reduces food intake and decreases body weight (\nWoods et al., 1979a\n). Central administration of insulin antibodies increases body weight (\nMcGowan et al., 1992\n). The rate of diffusion for peptides in the CNS is extremely limited (\nManess et al., 1996\n). Likewise, substances administered into the CSF have limited diffusion into brain beyond the periventricular region and do not diffuse well into spinal cord regions.\nNon-fasted CSF insulin levels in a rat are about 17 \u03bcU/mL (\nOno et al., 1983\n), approximately 3 pmol/L in normal, fasted aged humans (\nCraft et al., 1998\n), and 3.8 pmol/L in aged humans of unknown fasting state (\nGeijselaers et al., 2018\n). ICV infusion over 4.5 hours of 2.5 mU insulin led to over a 20-fold increase in insulin CSF levels (\nOno et al., 1983\n).\nMost substances after ICV injection enter the blood stream with the reabsorption of CSF and some have an accelerated efflux because of brain to blood transporters. In contrast to its saturable transport in the blood-to-brain direction, insulin has no saturable component to its brain-to-blood transport. There is no significant effect of excess insulin (10 nM). The half-time disappearance for insulin when delivered ICV is 26.4 min (\nCashion et al., 1996\n). Aluminum (17.8 mg) and starvation (72 h) increases retention while fasting (16 h) and refeeding (fasted 56 h and fed 16 h) had no effect. The impact of starvation is consistent with the role of insulin in the CNS on feeding behavior.\nRats fasted for 30 hours have peak insulin signaling activity in the hypothalamus shown by phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2, and AKT following 10 mU ICV insulin injection, although the amount of insulin present in this region was not measured in this study (\nNiswender et al., 2003\n). Aime et al showed a single 14 mU ICV insulin treatment increased olfactory bulb insulin levels in fasted rats from 0.10 \u00b1 0.01 ng/g to 0.24 \u00b1 0.05 ng/g, a level that is similar to satiated rats (0.21 \u00b1 0.03 ng/g) (\nAime et al., 2012\n). While this dose was not enough to alter food intake, it did decrease sniffing behavior in response to food odor. It was estimated the transport of insulin from the ventricle to the olfactory bulb is approximately 10\u00d7 greater than the amount that reaches the olfactory bulb after intranasal delivery, which will be discussed below in more detail. In line with the impact of CNS insulin on metabolism, ICV insulin decreases motivation for sucrose in rats on a low fat diet but this effect is abolished when rats are fed a high fat diet (\nFiglewicz et al., 2006\n). These results suggest insulin can decrease food reward in the CNS. The effects are rapid and acute, occurring within minutes to hours and are not persistent. These data highlight the metabolic effect of insulin in the CNS and the pathways that could be disrupted in an insulin resistant state.\nAs for the effect of CNS insulin on memory, ICV insulin has been shown to improve consolidation of memory (\nPark et al., 2000\n). ICV delivery of 4 mU insulin immediately following training of the passive-avoidance task increased latency when tested 24 h after training. Despite this study being performed nearly two decades ago, there still remain numerous unanswered questions including the time course of the insulin effect and further characterizing the period during which insulin enhances memory consolidation. Another study investigated the memory effect of ICV insulin infusion and neurogenesis in aged rats using the Morris water maze (\nHaas et al., 2016\n). While memory was not altered following a 5-day daily ICV insulin infusion of 20 mU in aged (24 mo) rats, insulin signaling and neurogenesis was enhanced. It should be noted memory was improved in the young (4 mo) rats. The discrepancies between these two studies could be due to the cognitive task used or the age of the rats used (age not reported in the Park study). It is interesting that chronic ICV insulin infusion was not able to improve memory in the aged cohort whereas chronic treatment of intranasal insulin does result in memory improvements as discussed next.\n\nIntranasal Administration\nIntranasal (INL) administration provides a rapid and noninvasive method for the delivery of insulin to the brain, circumventing the problem of crossing blood-CNS barriers (\nLalatsa et al., 2014\n;\nSalameh and Banks, 2014\n) and altering peripheral insulin levels (\nNedelcovych et al., 2018\n;\nSalameh et al., 2015\n). This method of delivery occurs rapidly as insulin is detected in the olfactory bulb and brain as early as 2.5 minutes post application in wildtype (\nRhea et al., 2017\n;\nSalameh et al., 2015\n) and SAMP8 mice (\nRhea et al. 2017\n). INL insulin delivery is dependent on the insulin receptor (\nRhea et al. 2017\n) unlike transport across the BBB (\nRhea et al., 2018\n). Unlike IV delivery in SAMP8 mice, where insulin is not transported into the hippocampus (\nBanks et al., 2000\n), INL delivery of radioactive insulin was detected in all of the brain regions examined, including the hippocampus (\nRhea et al., 2017\n;\nSalameh et al., 2015\n). However, similar to IV studies in the Alzheimer\u2019s disease model (\nBanks et al., 2000\n), the highest levels were detected in the olfactory bulb. In the brains of wildtype mice, the hypothalamus had the highest amount of insulin present 30 min post INL administration (5.246 \u00b1 0.1184 ng injected/g brain), which was 4\u00d7 more abundant than the cortex (1.436 \u00b1 0.0248 ng injected/g brain) (\nRhea et al. 2017\n). This is potentially because of the higher density of insulin receptors in the hypothalamus compared to the cortex (\nZahniser et al., 1984\n;\nZhao and Alkon, 2001\n). Also, the same phenomenon occurred in young and aged SAMP8 mice, indicating that insulin transport is not altered in disease states like Alzheimer\u2019s disease (\nRhea et al. 2017\n).\nStudies in both human and animal models have confirmed a link between peripheral insulin resistance and cognitive impairment and risks for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (\nBlazquez et al., 2014\n;\nCholerton et al., 2011\n;\nde la Monte and Tong, 2014\n). INL insulin, when administered to patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, mild cognitive impairment, and even those who are cognitively intact, has shown marked improvements in numerous cognitive tests including the delayed story recall and Dementia Severity Rating Scale (\nBenedict et al., 2004\n;\nCraft et al., 2012\n;\nReger et al., 2008a\n;\nReger et al., 2008b\n). While insulin has been successful in improving cognition in individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and mild cognitive impairment, those who were APOE \u03b54 positive or female showed poorer recall following INL insulin administration compared to those who did not possess this allele or male (\nClaxton et al., 2013\n;\nReger et al., 2006\n). These findings in regard to sex and APOE genotype were also apparent with the use of rapid-acting insulin, which is thought to have superior effects intranasally compared to regular insulin (\nRosenbloom et al., 2014\n). Positron emission tomography (PET) studies of patients prior to and post INL insulin administration demonstrate an increase in\n18\nF-fluorodeoxyglucose in the parietotemporal, frontal, precuneus, and cuneus regions (part of the occipital lobe) of the CNS compared to placebo controls, thus linking the improvement in cognitive function to processes in these brain regions (\nCraft et al., 2012\n). Cognitive enhancement has also been observed in animal models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease following INL insulin delivery (\nKamei et al., 2017\n;\nMao et al., 2016\n;\nSalameh et al., 2015\n).\nBrain insulin sensitivity is an important link between metabolism and cognitive dysfunction. In a recent study examining the acute effect of INL insulin on resting-state brain functional connectivity in lean and obese adults, the investigators found that INL insulin administration resulted in increased functional connectivity in the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and the hypothalamus (\nKullmann et al., 2017\n). In the hippocampus they found that brain connectivity was significantly correlated with visceral adipose tissue, while in the hypothalamus, brain connectivity was significantly correlated with peripheral insulin sensitivity. This demonstrates that brain insulin action may regulate eating behavior and facilitate weight loss through the modification of brain functional connectivity in regions involved in cognition and homeostatic function. Similar to the review on ICV insulin administration, these studies highlight the dual benefit of administering insulin to the insulin resistant CNS.\n\nOcular Administration\nThe eye poses unique opportunities and challenges when it comes to the delivery of pharmaceutics. Similar to INL administration, ocular delivery is a noninvasive delivery method. Studies originally done on the ocular delivery of insulin were performed as an alternative to insulin injections to regulate blood glucose levels and so were targeting delivery to the blood and not directly to the brain. For ocular absorption to occur, enhancers are required. Many agents such as saponin, EDTA and hyaluronate, and even conventional preservative agents (i.e. benzalkonium chloride and paraben), were shown to enhance insulin absorption (\nHoffman and Ziv, 1997\n). In the absence of enhancers, ocular administration of insulin to rabbits showed no change in blood glucose levels (\nSrinivasan and Jain, 1998\n). Since the cornea is relatively impermeable (\nPrausnitz and Noonan, 1998\n), the bioavailability of ocular insulin is low (5\u201310%) compared to the availability following subcutaneous insulin (65%) (\nGoeders et al., 1987\n;\nLee, 1990\n;\nPillion et al., 1994\n). Therefore, even with enhancing agents, it was deemed the bioavailability was too low to affect blood glucose and this method was abandoned as a therapeutic alternative to insulin injections. However, the impact on CNS insulin levels in these studies was not measured.\nIn a more recent study using female Lewis rats, the accessibility of ocular applied insulin to the CSF and select brain regions was assessed. Insulin was administered as an eye drop by reconstituting it at a concentration of 0.75% in an isotonic bicarbonate buffer containing 0.5% of the permeation enhancer, polyoxyethylene 20 stearyl ether (\nKoevary et al., 2003\n). In this study, insulin was detected in the CSF and serum by 10 min post ocular insulin administration, with CSF levels dropping by 20\u201330 min before increasing again at 45 min. The highest levels were detected 10 min post application in the thalamus, specifically the medial geniculate nucleus (0.24 \u00b1 0.06 pg insulin/\u03bcg protein) compared to the lateral geniculate nucleus (0.13 \u00b1 0.03 pg insulin/\u03bcg protein) and the cortex (0.13 \u00b1 0.04 pg insulin/\u03bcg protein). In comparison to subcutaneous insulin administration that would ultimately enter these brain regions by crossing the BBB, more insulin reached the lateral geniculate nucleus following ocular administration. Expectedly, the same was not true in the serum where levels were greater post subcutaneous administration (\nKoevary et al., 2003\n). Ten minutes following ocular administration, serum insulin levels increased nearly 6 fold over baseline. Due to the dual peak in CSF levels of insulin following ocular delivery, the authors theorize the first 10 min peak is from direct uptake of insulin into the CSF via the optic nerve while the second peak is from insulin transport across the BBB after entering the circulation via drainage through the nasal mucosa.\nLittle work has been done on the ocular route for brain delivery, and so it is noteworthy that this has route has been shown to be viable for at least one other peptide. Ocular administration of the neuroprotective peptide, PACAP-38, delivered in the enhancer benzalkonium chloride, has been used to investigate the benefits in retinal ischemia (\nWerling et al., 2016\n). In this study, radiolabeled PACAP-38 not only appeared in the retina but also in the whole brain. PACAP-38 appeared in the brain within 5 minutes and remained present over 2 hours. While little has been shown with ocular administration of peptides, this study provides insight on the beneficial effect in diseased conditions.\nLikely due to the poor penetration of insulin into the CNS and increased systemic delivery following ocular delivery, this method has not been explored further, especially in the context of memory or in the use of Alzheimer\u2019s disease models. However, with the continued research of enhancers in ocular delivery, this route could provide a promising avenue for increasing CNS insulin levels and overcoming CNS insulin resistance.\n\nIntrathecal Administration\nIntrathecal (IT) delivery involves a direct injection into the spinal canal or into the subarachnoid space so that it reaches the CSF, similar to ICV delivery. In general, the most common reasons for this particular administration is for spinal anesthesia, chemotherapy, and pain management. This delivery method is often overlooked because of its inability to deliver small, lipid-soluble drugs to the CNS. However, it has been shown the anorexogenic hormone leptin reaches the hypothalamus in baboons by 115 min following IT delivery (\nMcCarthy et al., 2002\n). The biologically active concentration is estimated to be 8 ng/mL, which is 40 times greater than CSF levels of normal weight humans. In regards to delivering substrates such as leptin, the IT route of administration can rapidly achieve therapeutic and long-lasting levels. IT delivery has been quite successful in the transport of enzymes such as therapeutics for lysosomal storage diseases (\nCalias et al., 2012\n;\nXu et al., 2011\n), the delivery of trastuzumab to the CNS in patients with meningeal carcinomatosis from breast cancer (\nHofer et al., 2012\n;\nMego et al., 2011\n), antisense delivery for spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (\nAragon-Gawinska et al., 2018\n), and cyclodextrin delivery for Niemann-Pick disease (\nCalias, 2017\n). These large proteins, unlike small lipid soluble molecules, do not enter the blood by transcellular diffusion and so are \u201ctrapped\u201d in the CSF space and can eventually make their way to the cranial CSF.\nAn advantage of this technique that can be extended to the other delivery methods includes that, while the CSF contains hundreds of proteins, it may have decreased enzymatic activity than in the serum leading to less degradation. Some disadvantages of using IT administration that can also be extended to other delivery methods, especially the ICV route, is the development of antibodies and the inability to accurately determine dosing due to CSF reabsorption rate variability among individuals. In addition, disease conditions such as obesity and the rapid growth rate of children can complicate proper catheter insertion (\nFollett et al., 2003\n).\nWhile the distribution of insulin throughout the brain has not been measured following IT delivery, there are studies showing a beneficial effect with minimal side effects with this delivery method. IT insulin administration has been shown to rescue and regenerate sural nerves after crush injury. This indicates a direct neurotrophic effect of insulin in peripheral nerves (\nToth et al., 2006\n). Also, systemic insulin injection enhances reinnervation of sciatic nerve transection (\nXu et al., 2004\n). IT insulin has been used in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, a condition with distal-to-proximal loss of nerve function (\nGrote and Wright, 2016\n).\nWhile not direct delivery of insulin to the CNS via IT administration, a recent paper showed intracranial grafting of pancreatic islets was able to attenuate cognitive decline and peripheral metabolic dysfunction in an Alzheimer\u2019s disease-like dementia animal model (ICV-STZ) (\nBloch et al., 2018\n). ICV-STZ is able to induce sporadic Alzheimer\u2019s disease-like dementia (\nChen et al., 2013\n). In the study by Bloch et al, a small number of pancreatic islets were grafted into the cranial subarachnoid space of male Lewis rats (\nBloch et al., 2018\n). Spatial learning and memory and long-term retention was assessed two months after islet transplantation by the Morris water maze. Islets were still viable and producing insulin two months later at the time of sacrifice leading to significantly increased CNS insulin levels especially in the hippocampus and frontal cortex (\nBloch et al., 2015\n;\nBloch et al., 2018\n). These improvements occurred without changes in peripheral fasting blood glucose and expression levels of the insulin receptor, suggesting post-insulin receptor alterations for memory enhancement."

    "Methods": "2.1. Mice\nMale C57BL/6J mice (8 to 10 weeks old) purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. All mice were acclimated to environment for a week before use. All experimental protocols were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport and Pennsylvania State University Hershey Medical Center. A total of 92 mice were used in this study. Number of animals used in each experimental measurement is elaborated in more detail in\nSuppl. Table I\n.\n\n2.2. Controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury model\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) was induced using a computer-controlled cortical impact (CCI) device (PinPoint Precision Cortical Impactor, Hattera, PCI 3000), as previously described (\nBilgen, 2005\n). Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (80 mg/kg)/xylazine (5 mg/kg) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA). A midline sagittal scalp incision is made to expose the skull bone. A 4-mm craniotomy was made by using an electric drill on the right lateral side of the skull centered 2.7 mm lateral from the midline and 2 mm posterior to bregma, leaving the dura mater intact. Then, an impactor tip (3 mm in diameter) was placed in the center of the craniotomy site. The impact was then delivered at following parameters: 2 mm depth, 2 m/s velocity, and 85 ms dwell time. These parameters produce\nmoderate-to-severe\nTBI injury in mice as documented previously (\nSiebold et al., 2018\n). After impact, Surgicel (Johnson & Johnson, Dallas, TX) was applied to the dura, the skull-cap was then replaced and affixed with dental adhesive, and the incision was closed. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37\u00b10.5\u00b0C with a feedback-regulated heating pad throughout the surgical procedure until the mice recovered from anesthesia. Sham-operated mice underwent the same procedure without impact.\n\n2.3. Experimental design and drug treatment\nSchematic diagram for the experimental design is shown in\nFigure 1A\n. Mice were randomly assigned to the following experimental groups before surgery: (1) sham, (2) TBI + vehicle, and (3) TBI + EPPS, and sacrificed at 3 days or 28 days after surgery. For randomization, the web tool\nwww.randomizer.org\nwas used. Animals were randomly assigned to each group via random numbers generated on an Excel spreadsheet. EPPS (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was freshly dissolved in distilled water with a final concentration of 30 mg/ml. EPPS was administered orally at a dose of 120 mg/kg given immediately after TBI and thereafter once daily for up to 3 days (for the 3-day post-TBI assessment) or 7 days (for 28-day post-TBI assessment). Mice in sham and vehicle groups received the same volume of distilled water. In a separate set of experiments (\nFigure 1B\n), we evaluated the inhibition of autophagic flux on TBI-induced A\u03b2 deposition and neuronal apoptosis at 3 days after surgery, in which the lysosomal inhibitor, chloroquine (CQ), was injected (Sigma, dissolved in saline solution) intraperitoneally at 10 mg/kg prior to EPPS treatment and the assessments were performed in the following experimental groups: (1) sham, (2) TBI + vehicle, (3) TBI + CQ, (4) TBI + EPPS, and (5) TBI + EPPS + CQ.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Schematic diagram describing the experimental design.

(C) Schematic diagram showing the regions of interest (ROI) selected for immunohistochemical image acquisition and quantitative analysis: from the cortex (a), corpus callosum (b), external capsule (c), hippocampal CA1 (d) and CA3 (e).\n\n2.4. Motor function assessment\nAll functional tests were performed by investigators blinded to group assignment. Motor balance and coordination were assessed using a beam-walk and beam-balance tasks as described previously (\nLuong et al., 2011\n). In the beam-walk task, mice were trained and assessed using a negative reinforcement paradigm to escape ambient light and high decibel noise by walking across an elevated (50 cm) narrow wooden beam (6 mm in width \u00d7 100 cm in length) and entering into a darkened goal box at the opposite end. Latency to walk across the beam were recorded. In the beam-balance task, mice were placed on the same elevated narrow wooden beam and the duration of the mice remain on the beam were recorded (maximum time was 60 sec). All mice were pre-trained on beam-walking and beam-balance 1 day before TBI and assessed right before TBI to establish a basal level of performance. Post-operative testing was conducted at 1 day after TBI and for five consecutive days, consisting of three trials per day for each animal with 60 sec allotted time per trial. The average daily scores for each animal were used for statistical analysis.\n\n2.5. Cognitive function assessment\nTo evaluate the spatial learning and memory function, the Barnes maze test was performed as described previously (\nPatil et al., 2009\n). In brief, a small dark recessed chamber (called as target box) was placed under a circular platform (91 cm of diameter) where mice can access it through an escape tunnel under the target hole. Mice were pre-trained with the use of the escape tunnel at 23 days after surgery, and then went through 4 trials per day with a 15 minutes inter-trial interval for 5 days. During each trial, the mice were placed in the center of the maze under a start chamber for 10 seconds with both the buzzer (85 dB) and light on (80-watts bulb; 90 cm above maze) to motivate the mice to find the target box and allowed to explore the maze for 3 minutes. The time spent to reach the target hole was recorded. Data from 4 trials per day for each animal were averaged. Then, they were required to remain in the target box for 2 min prior to retrieval, regardless of success. On the last day, a single trial lasting for 3 min was performed with the target box removed, and mice were allowed to explore the maze and locate the target hole. Number of error head pokes was recorded.\nNovel object recognition test was also performed for cognitive assessment as previously described (\nLeger et al., 2013\n). At 28 days after TBI, mice were placed in a rectangular arena (30 cm \u00d7 30 cm). In the first session (Session 1), mice were allowed to explore two identical objects for 10 min and then returned to their home cages. One hour later (Session 2), mice were exposed to a familiar object from Session 1 and a novel object (same dimension but different in shape and color) for 10 min. The time spent in exploring each object in Session 2 was recorded. The mouse directing its nose within 2 cm distance to the object, or sniffing or pawing the object was defined as object exploration. The data was expressed as discrimination index using following formula: Discrimination index = time spent in exploring novel object / (time exploring novel object + time exploring familiar object) \u00d7 100%.\n\n2.6. Tissue Processing\nAt the indicated time points after TBI, mice were euthanized by\nintraperitoneal injection\nof sodium\npentobarbital\n(Nembutal, 150 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 0.01M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma) in PBS (pH 7.4). Then, the brains were removed, post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA. To prepare frozen sections, brains were transferred into 30% sucrose solution until they sank to the bottom of the container. Then, the brains were frozen-embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura, Torrance, CA). Coronal sections (8-\u03bcm thick) were serially cut using a cryostat, and mounted on silane-coated glass slides (Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. To prepare paraffin sections, post-fixed brains were embedded in paraffin. Coronal sections (5-\u03bcm thick) were serially cut using a rotary microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides (Frosted, Fisher).\n\n2.7. Contusion volume measurement\nContusion volumes were measured at 28 days after CCI by an investigator blinded to the animal groups. Coronal paraffin sections (5-\u03bcm thick) at 0.5 mm intervals were stained using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining. Whole coronal section images were acquired using tiling mode and 10\u00d7 objective on a digital camera system connected to a Nikon Eclipse Ti bright field microscope (Tokyo, Japan). The area of cortical tissue loss for each section was measured on the digital photographs using NIH ImageJ software (Version 1.51 \u03b7, NIH, Bethesda, MD). Contusion volume (V, mm\n3\n) was calculated based on the contused area (A, mm\n2\n) on 15 coronal sections at 500 \u03bcm distance (d=0.5 mm between two sequential slices) using the following formula: V=d\u00d7(A1\u00d70.5+A2+A3+\u2026+A14+A15\u00d70.5), as described previously (\nDash et al., 2010\n).\n\n2.8. Hippocampal neuronal loss measurement\nHippocampal neuronal loss induced by TBI was assessed at 28 days after CCI by an investigator blinded to the group assignment. H&E staining was performed on serial paraffin sections at the level of the dorsal hippocampus (\u22121.4 to \u22122.1 mm from bregma) at 100-\u03bcm intervals. To maintain consistency across animals, four rectangular boxes (1.0 \u00d7 0.25 mm) were centered over the CA1 and CA3 layer. CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons showing intact round nuclei were counted as surviving cells using a Nikon Ti-E light microscope at 40\u00d7 magnification. The data are expressed as the number of surviving neurons per millimeter of medial CA1 or CA3 as described previously (\nChoi et al., 2005\n).\n\n2.9. White matter damage measurement\nLuxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining, a well-established method to stain myelin/myelinated axon, was performed to evaluate white matter damage at 28 days after CCI. A NovaUltraTM LFB stain kit (IHC World, Ellicott City, MD) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Images were taken with a 40\u00d7 objective and LFB intensity was measured using Image-Pro Premier 3D software version 9.2 (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD). The average intensities of the regions of interest (ROI) from the external capsule (EC) were used for data analysis (\nFigure 1C\n). All measurements were performed in a blinded manner.\n\n2.10. Immunohistochemistry\nCoronal paraffin sections (5 \u03bcm thick) from the center of the lesions (\u22121.5 mm to \u22122 mm from bregma) were used for immunohistochemistry. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti- \u03b2-APP (1:200; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 51-2700), rabbit anti-A\u03b2 (1:200; Abeam, ab2539), mouse anti-nonphosphorylated neurofilament-H (SMI-32; 1:1000; Millipore, NE1023), rabbit anti-p62/SQSTM1 (sequestosome 1; 1:200; Abeam, ab91526), mouse anti-cathepsin D (CTSD; 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-377299), rabbit anti-NeuN (neuronal marker; 1:500; Abeam, ab177487), mouse anti-NeuN (1:300; Millipore, MAB377), and rabbit anti-activate caspase-3 (A. casp-3; 1:100; Millipore, AB3623). Isotypes matched control antibodies served as negative controls. For double immunofluorescence staining, the corresponding fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies were used: goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 555, and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 (all from Life Technology, 1:1000). All images were taken under a 40\u00d7 magnification using a fluorescence Nikon Ti inverted microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescence intensities were measured using ImageJ software by applying global background subtraction and threshold adjustment as described previously (\nJensen, 2013\n). The number of immunoreactive cells were counted in predefined areas and expressed as mean cell number/0.1 mm\n2\n. Numbers of positively-stained target cells and intensities of positively-stained areas per mm\n2\nwere analyzed on 5 coronal sections of each brain within the regions of interest (\nFigure 1C\n): the pericontusional cortex, the external capsule (EC), and the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields. All data were analyzed in a blinded manner.\n\n2.11. Western Blot Analysis\nWhole-cell protein extracts were obtained from the ipsilateral cerebral cortices (+1 to \u22124 mm from bregma). Brain tissues were homogenized in cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI with pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCI, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40) containing protease inhibitor (Pierce tablet; Thermo Fisher Scientific, A32965) and phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma, P0044). The homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatants were used for analysis. Protein content was measured using Bradford dye reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Protein samples (30 \u03bcg protein per sample) were separated by 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membranes. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-LC3B (1:2000; Novus Biological, NB100-2220), rabbit anti-p62 (1:1000), mouse anti-CTSD (1:100),mouse anti-GAPDH (1:10000; Sigma, G8795), rabbit anti-postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95; 1:1000; Cell Signaling, 3409), and mouse anti-\u03b2-actin (1:800; Sigma, A2066). Immunopositive bands of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were detected with an ECL system (GE Healthcare) and exposure to ECL Hyperfilm.\n\n2.12. Statistical analysis\nThe IBM SPSS statistics 25 (IBM, NY, USA) was used for statistical analysis. The normality of data distribution was assessed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For normally distributed variables, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni post hoc tests were used to assess differences between groups. The Kruskal\u2013Wallis followed by Mann\u2013Whitney U tests were used to explore differences between groups in non-normally distributed variables. Comparisons of beam-balance, beam-walking and Barnes maze latencies were made using two-way repeated measures ANOVA. Sample size calculation (power = 0.8, \u03b1 = 0.05) was performed using an online calculator (\nhttp://www.lasec.cuhk.edu.hk/sample-size-calculation.html\n). Estimated 5 animals per group would be required to detect \u2265 30% difference in brain tissue loss between the EPPS-treated and untreated groups with the 25% standard deviation of the mean value. Data were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (S.E.M.). Differences with p<0.05 were considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Animals and Ethical Approval\nStudies used male Sprague-Dawley rats (250\u2013380 g; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, DE) that were housed in a temperature-controlled room (22\u201323\u00b0C) with a 14:10-h light-dark cycle. Rats consumed standard chow with ad libitum access to tap water. All experimental procedures conformed to National Institutes of Health Guidelines and were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.\n\nTelemetric recording of arterial pressure and heart rate\nMean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) changes during exposure to sham or graded intensities of AIH were recorded by radio telemetry (Data Sciences International, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) in unanesthetized and unrestrained rats. Telemetry transmitters (model HD-S10) were implanted using aseptic surgical technique as previously described (\nBardgett et al., 2014a\n;\nSharpe et al., 2013a\n;\nSharpe et al., 2013b\n). Briefly, each rat was anesthetized with isoflurane (~3% in O\n2\n), a laparotomy was performed and the gel-filled catheter of pre-sterilized transmitter was inserted into the abdominal aorta and affixed with tissue adhesive. The transmitter housing was sutured to the posterior abdominal wall and the laparotomy sutured closed. Upon regaining consciousness, each rat received injections of the antibiotic penicillin G (30,000 units) and the analgesic buprenorphine (50 \u03bcg/kg) before being returned to a clean home cage. Rats were allowed to recover from surgery for 7 days prior to experiments. Arterial pressure was sampled at 500 Hz during 10 s sampling period each minute while rats experienced sham AIH or AIH to 10%, 8% or 6% O\n2\n.\n\nExposure to Acute Intermittent Hypoxia\nEach rat individually housed in its home cage was relocated to a custom-built Plexiglas chamber and allowed to acclimate at normoxia (21% O\n2\n) for 5 days. Thereafter, rats were exposed to our previously described (\nKim et al., 2018\n) AIH protocol (see\nFigure 1A\n). Briefly, chamber O\n2\nwas reduced by perfusion with N\n2\nfrom 21% to nadirs of 10%, 8% or 6% over a period of ~145 s. Chamber O\n2\nwas then held near its nadir for ~35 s before being returned to ~21% by perfusion with room air over the next ~105 s. Episodes of hypoxia were separated by a period of normoxia lasting ~75 s such that the duration of each normoxia-hypoxia cycle averaged ~6 minutes, allowing for 10 cycles/h. For exposure to sham AIH, chamber O\n2\nwas held continuously at 21% by alternately switching chamber perfusion between two sources of compressed room air. Fluctuations of O\n2\nduring AIH were separately recorded from each chamber using an analog sensor (KE-25, Figaro GS YUASA, Japan). Signals were amplified (Kent Scientific, Inc. USA), digitized at 10 Hz and analyzed using Spike2 software (v 7.1, Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK).\nFigure 1: Chamber O\n2\nfluctuations and cardiovascular responses to graded AIH.\nOpen in a new tab\n(\nA\n) Representative traces of chamber O\n2\nconcentration showing the pattern of O\n2\nchanges during exposure to sham AIH (top, left) and graded intensities of AIH (bottom, right) over a period of 1 h. (\nB\n) Summary mean arterial pressure (MAP, left) and heart rate (HR, right) data at baseline and during exposure to sham and graded AIH (n=4/group). MAP and HR were unaltered relative to baseline by sham AIH or AIH to 10% and 8% O\n2\n. AIH to 6% O\n2\nwas accompanied by modest and transient increase of MAP during cycles 1 and 2.\n* P<0.0017, \u03d5 P<0.004 vs. corresponding time point in the sham AIH group\n.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nNinety minutes after exposure to sham AIH or one of the three levels of AIH, rats underwent transcardiac perfusion with 4\u00b0C solutions of heparinized saline (1000 U/mL, 100 mL) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, 300 mL) in 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Brains were removed, post-fixed at 4\u00b0C for 4h in PFA and transferred to 30% sucrose-PBS for ~2 days at 4\u00b0C. Brains were sectioned in the coronal plane at 40 \u03bcm using a sliding microtome (Leica SM 2000R). Sections through the hypothalamus were collected into four serially adjacent sets and stored in polyvinyl-pyrrolidone cryoprotectant at \u221220\u00b0C.\nDetection of c-Fos:\nImmunostaining for c-Fos protein in neuronal nuclei was performed as described previously (\nMitchell et al., 2018\n;\nStocker et al., 2004\n;\nStocker et al., 2006\n). Tissue sections through the PVN were removed from cryoprotectant and rinsed in 0.01 M PBS prior to incubation in 0.5% sodium borohydride for 30 min then in PBS containing 3% donkey serum and 0.3% Triton-X 100 for 2 h. Sections were then incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-rat cFos antibody (1:10,000; Millipore) at 4\u00b0C for 72 h followed by incubation with biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:250; Vector Laboratories) for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were rinsed and incubated for 10 min with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 594 (1:250; Invitrogen).\nNeurochemical phenotyping:\nc-Fos stained sections underwent co-immunostaining for corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) or arginine vasopressin (AVP). Staining was compared between rats exposed to sham AIH and AIH to 8% O\n2\n. The latter intensity of AIH was selected because it induced robust c-Fos expression in the PVN without eliciting obvious arousal behavior (see supplemental video file, S1). Hence c-Fos expression likely reflects neurons responsive to intermittent hypoxia rather than any behavioral consequences of hypoxic exposure.\nTo colocalized c-Fos amongst CRH or AVP containing neurons, c-Fos stained sections were incubated for 2 h in PBS containing 3% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton-X 100 followed by incubation with a goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. Sections were then rinsed and incubated with polyclonal guinea pig anti-CRH or anti-AVP antibody (1:1,000; Peninsula Laboratories). Sections were then rinsed and incubated for 2 h with a goat antiguinea pig IgG secondary antibody (1:250; Invitrogen). Sections were again rinsed, then incubated for 10 min with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (1:250; Invitrogen).\nImmunofluorescent images of PVN were captured using an inverted confocal microscope (Eclipse TE 2000E, Nikon) equipped with a 16-bit Andor Technology iXon camera. NIS-Elements AR software (v3.2) was used to mark and count neurons containing c-Fos, CRH and AVP immunofluorescence. Sub-divisions of the rat PVN were defined according to established criteria (\nSwanson and Kuypers, 1980\n).\n\nData Analysis\nFor analysis of MAP and HR, values acquired each minute were averaged into 6 minute bins, which is equivalent to the average during of each normoxia-hypoxia cycle. Values during sham and graded AIH were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by a layered Bonferroni post hoc test when indicated by a significant treatment \u00d7 time interaction. The number of c-Fos stained nuclei as well as CRH or AVP stained soma were separately counted in representative sections from representative rostral, middle and caudal planes of the PVN. To quantify the proportion of CRH or AVP neurons activated by AIH, we related the size of each neuropeptide population (i.e., total CRH+ or AVP+ counts) in the PVN to the size of the respective population that contained both CRH and c-Fos or AVP and c-Fos immunoreactivities (i.e., double-labelled neurons). These ratios were expressed as the percent of the CRH or AVP cell population that was doubled labelled with c-Fos (see\nFig. 3D\n). Similarly, to quantify the proportions of AIHactivated PVN neurons that co-stained for CRH or AVP, we related the size of the AIH-activated neuron population (i.e., total c-Fos+ counts) to the size of the neuron population that contained both c-Fos and CRH or c-Fos and AVP immunoreactivities (see\nFig. 3E\n). At each rostro-caudal plane, counts were separated according to PVN subregions and compared between sham AIH and AIH to 10%, 8% and 6% O\n2\n. Neurons in rostral, middle, and caudal planes of the PVN that were c-Fos-positive and double-labeled with CRF or AVP were separately counted. Total counts in each PVN subregion were estimated by summing region specific counts across the rostral, middle and caudal planes. Cell count data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (GraphPad Prism 7.04 Software) followed by a layered Bonferroni post-hoc test when indicated by a significant treatment \u00d7 time interaction. For all comparisons, a multiplicity error corrected critical value of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nFigure 3: Co-localization of AIH-induced c-Fos with stressregulatory neuropeptides.\nOpen in a new tab\nImages of c-Fos stained sections (\na,d, red\n) in the MP region of PVN following exposure to sham AIH and AIH to 8% O\n2\n. Sections were co-stained (\nb,e, green\n) for CRH (\nA\n) or AVP (\nB\n) and merged images (\nc,f\n) show c-Fos co-localization with CRH or AVP. Higher magnification (40X) images (far right) show double labelled neurons in yellow. (\nC\n) Summary data (n=6/group) of c-Fos, CRH and AVP immunoreactive counts in the MP region of PVN.

    "Methods": "For complete methods, seeSupplemental Methodsonline.\n\nExperimental Design\nAnimal Preparation and Surgery.\nAll procedures were conducted in compliance with approved institutional animal care and use protocols. A total of 54 female Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) age 6 \u2013 10 weeks, weighing 180 - 275g were used in these experiments. Female rats were used because seizures have been shown less likely to secondarily generalize in female rats compared to males.(\nJanszky et al., 2004\n;\nMej\u00edas-Aponte et al., 2002\n) All surgeries were performed as previously described (see also\nSupplemental Methods\n) (\nEnglot et al., 2008\n;\nMotelow et al., 2015\n).\nLFP and MUA Electrophysiology.\nLocal field potential (LFP) and multiunit activity (MUA) from lateral orbitofrontal cortex (Ctx LFP & Ctx MUA), as well as LFP from hippocampi (Hc) were acquired and amplified as previously described (\nMotelow et al., 2015\n;\nZhan et al., 2016\n). Continuous recordings were made using Spike2 v8.06 (CED) software.\nSeizure Induction.\nSeizures were induced during a lightly anesthetized state as described previously (see also\nSupplemental Methods\n) (\nEnglot et al., 2008\n;\nMotelow et al., 2015\n). Bipolar stimulating-recording electrodes were placed in the Hc bilaterally. Hc was stimulated, using a 2s, 60Hz square biphasic wave (1ms per phase). Hc stimulus current amplitude was titrated to produce focal hippocampal seizure activity based on polyspike discharges without propagation to frontal cortex. Propogation of polyspike activity to the orbitofrontal electrode was considered secondary generalization and such seizures were excluded from analyses. Because the reduced-firing hyperpolarizing phenotype (\nFigure 1\n) was observed in comparatively short seizures as well as longer ones, no lower threshold on duration of seizures was stipulated for inclusion in analyses (range of duration for included seizures was 6 to 72 seconds).\nFigure 1. Reduced-firing hyperpolarizing (RfHp) neuron in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) during a focal limbic seizure.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Whole-cell current clamp recording of membrane potential (Vm) in PPT neuron shows reduced firing and hyperpolarization (see inset) during a focal seizure induced in the hippocampus by a 2s, 60 Hz stimulus (gray bar). Concomitant recording of local field potential (LFP) shows polyspike seizure activity in the hippocampus (Hc). Orbital frontal cortex (Ctx) LFP exhibit slow-waves and multiunit activity (MUA) recordings show Up/Down state firing at seizure onset lasting into the postictal period. (B) Histology demonstrates co-localization of biocytin (from intracellular electrode solution) staining and ChAT immunohistochemistry for neuron recorded in A. Scale bar is 20 microns.\nWhole-cell recordings.\nFor whole-cell recordings from PPT, procedures used previously for more superficial targets were modified (See also\nSupplemental Methods\n) (\nMcGinley et al., 2015\n). The PPT was targeted at coordinates (relative to bregma) AP \u22127.8; ML \u00b11.8; Depth 7.0 mm. A potassium-gluconate-based intracellular solution with 0.5% Biocytin, the same as is used for\nin vitro\nwhole cell recordings(\nNeske et al., 2015\n), was used for micropipettes. Borosilicate glass pipettes (1B150F-4, World Precision instruments) were fabricated using a multi-line program to have a long 9-10mm taper to allow recordings deep below the cortical surface, and a resistance of 3.5 \u2013 6 M\u03a9, using a Sutter Instruments P-1000 micropipette puller.\nRecordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B (Axon) amplifier and digitized at 25kHz using a Micro1401 (CED) and Spike2 v8.06 (CED) software. The neuron-searching step of acquiring whole cell recordings was undertaken in voltage-clamp mode, with current response visualized in real-time both in Spike2 software and on an external oscilloscope for blind-patching. The initial access resistance of most cells was between 20 - 40 M\u03a9.\nHistology.\nBrains were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and cut in 60\u03bcm slices for histology. Brains were then stained for biocytin cy3-streptavidin construct and co-stained using an antibody to Choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT; goat-\u03b1-choline acetyltransferase, Millipore, 1:500, #AB144P) as previously described(\nMotelow et al., 2015\n) (see also\nSupplemental Methods\n). To confirm locations of neurons, slices containing labelled neurons were compared to anatomical diagrams of rat brains (\nPaxinos and Watson, 1998\n) (\nsupplemental figure S3\n).\n\nStatistical Analyses\nData analysis was performed using Spike2 (CED, v5.20a), and in-house software written on MATLAB (R2009a, Mathworks). Analysis epoch were defined as follows: 1. Baseline: 20\u20130 s before stimulus; 2. Ictal: the first 20 s of hippocampal seizure activity (or the entire period of seizure activity where indicated), based on large amplitude, polyspike activity in the hippocampal LFP recordings; 3. Postictal: 0\u201320 s after seizure; 4. Recovery: 20 s following the postictal period. All included neurons had RC charging curve compatible with transition to intracellular recordings, exhibited reproducible action potentials, and stable resting potential (see\nSupplemental Methods\nfor details). Statistical significance threshold for Student\u2019s two-tailed t-test was p < 0.05, with Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons where appropriate.\nNeuronal spiking rate analysis.\nSpike sorting on the whole cell recordings was performed in Spike 2 using template-matching based on waveform shapes to identify single units. Raster plots of neuronal firing were generated for each neuron, and then histograms of mean firing rate were calculated across neurons in 1s non-overlapping bins for each epoch (\nFigures 2\nand\nsupplemental figure S3\n).\nFigure 2. Reduced action potential firing in RfHp neurons during seizures.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Raster plots (five cells from five animals) show decreased firing during the Ictal period compared with Baseline. Boxes in ictal panel indicate duration of seizures up to the first 20 s. (B) Histograms of firing rate in 1 s bins across neurons. Mean reduction in firing rate of Ictal compared to Baseline epochs was \u221251.6% (SEM 12.8%, * p < 0.05, paired t-test). Baseline is defined as the 20 s preceding seizure onset. Ictal is defined as up to the first 20 s following seizure onset. Postictal is the first 20 s following seizure end. Recovery is the 20 s following the Postictal period.\nV\nm\nhyperpolarization during seizures vs. baseline.\nMembrane potential in baseline and ictal epochs were averaged in 3s bins after excluding the 20ms period surrounding each action potential (5ms prior, 15ms following). The bin just prior to seizure stimulation (within the baseline period) was compared to the bin of most negative membrane potential during the ictal period to determine the amplitude of ictal hyperpolarization. Time course graphs of mean change in membrane potential, V\nm\n(mV) were constructed using 3s bins of V\nm\ndata (\nFigure 3 C\n). Absolute change from baseline V\nm\nwas calculated by taking the mean baseline V\nm\nfor the 20s prior to seizure onset, and subtracting that mean baseline V\nm\nfrom all plotted 3s V\nm\nbins. Baseline bins were compared to ictal bins using a two-tailed t-test, \u03b1 = 0.05.\nFigure 3. Increased input resistance and reduced membrane potential fluctuations in RfHp neurons during seizures.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Example of response to continuous 10Hz 30pA square current pulses in an RfHp neuron (top trace, Voltage; bottom trace, Current). Action potentials are truncated. The trace shows reduced firing and hyperpolarization in the ictal period (blue), as well as a larger magnitude of V\nm\nresponse to constant current steps, indicating an increase in ictal input resistance. Inset on right shows expanded view of baseline (black) and ictal (blue) V\nm\nresponses to current pulses, with resting potentials aligned vertically to enable differences in response amplitude to be compared more easily.\n(B) Mean time course of absolute change in mean input resistance (R\nin\n) during seizures reveal that the increase in mean R\nin\nfor RfHp neurons (blue) was significant during the ictal period (P<0.05, two-tailed t-test). Seizure onset was at time 0, and ends of seizure epochs are indicated by vertical dashed lines for RfHp (blue, n=3) and non-RfHp (red, n=4) neurons. Traces show mean change in R\nin\n(R\nin\n\u2013 baseline R\nin\n) from baseline with standard error of mean (SEM).\n(C) Mean time course of change in mean Vm from baseline (Vm \u2013 baseline Vm) for the same neurons in (B) and over the same time course, showing significant hyperpolarization during the ictal period (P<0.05, two-tailed t-test).\n(D, E) Changes in input resistance (R\nin\n) for individual RfHp and non-RfHp neurons. RfHp neurons (D) show consistent increases in R\nin\nduring the ictal period compared to baseline. (* P < 0.05, paired, two-tailed t-test, Holm-Bonferroni corrected). None of the non-RfHp neurons (E) show significant increase in R\nin\nduring seizures. For (D) and (E) mean and SEM are shown across each neuron that received current pulses, with SEMs obtained across current pulses for each period.\n(F) Examples of EPSP-like events defined as positive fluctuations in membrane potential of >0.4mV with a rise-time of <2ms (\nKoch, 2004\n;\nMason et al., 1991\n). Top (black) trace shows the baseline V\nm\nof an RfHp neuron, while the lower (blue) trace shows ictal V\nm\nof the same RfHp neuron. Orange markings overly EPSP-like events, with each event also marked as a black (baseline) or blue (ictal) tick-mark for easier comparison of relative frequency. In group analysis, frequency of EPSP-like events was significantly decreased during the ictal periods of RfHp neurons compared to baseline (see text).\n(G,H) Average membrane potential histograms for RfHp neurons (n=4) (G) and non-RfHp neurons (n=10) (H) in the Baseline, Ictal and Recovery periods, presented side-by-side with bar graphs quantifying variance. Mean histogram for RfHp neurons was narrower for the ictal period (blue), and the corresponding membrane potential variance of RfHp neurons was significantly decreased during seizures compared to baseline (* P < 0.05, paired two-tailed t-test, Holm- Bonferroni corrected)\nInput resistance (R\nin\n).\nInput resistance was measured by delivering repeated hyperpolarizing square current pulses and measuring the change in membrane potential for each step, as resistance (R) is related to change in voltage (\u0394V) and current (\u0394I) through Ohm\u2019s law R=\u0394V/\u0394I. Square hyperpolarizing pulses were delivered at a constant frequency and amplitude during the recording of each neuron (\nFigure 3 A\n). Time course graphs of mean absolute ictal changes in R\nin\n(M\u03a9) were constructed using 3s bins of R\nin\ndata (\nFigure 3 B\n). Absolute change from baseline R\nin\nwas calculated by taking the mean baseline R\nin\nfor the 20s prior to seizure onset, and subtracting that mean baseline R\nin\nfrom all plotted 3s R\nin\nbins. Baseline bins were compared to ictal bins using a two-tailed t-test, \u03b1 = 0.05.\nAnalysis of EPSP-like events and voltage histograms.\nEPSP-like events were identified in MATLAB as positive fluctuations in membrane potential of >0.4mV with a rise-time of <2ms (\nKoch, 2004\n;\nMason et al., 1991\n), excluding the time periods from 5ms before to 15ms after any action potentials (\nFigure 3 F\n). Constraints of the model did not allow for full validation of these as canonical EPSPs (see\nDiscussion\n), so the descriptive term \u201cEPSP-like events\u201d is used instead.\nAs an additional measure of synaptic activity, we investigated the variance of voltage before, during and after seizures. Variance in these epochs was compared using paired two-tailed t-tests. To graphically depict membrane potential distribution, we created voltage histograms centered to the mean of a fitted Gaussian. Histogram values were divided by the total number of samples in each histogram to obtain fractional time per mV for each bin, and averaged bin by bin across neurons with equal weight (\nFigure 3 G\n,\nH\n)."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nC57Bl/6NHsd wild type (WT) mice were obtained from Harlan Laboratories and the Hsp70.1/70.3 double knockout mice on a C57Bl/6N background (Hsp70 KO) mice were obtained from the Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center. Experimental animals were generated by in-house breeding and were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and 7022 NIH-07 rodent chow (5.2% fat). All animal procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and in compliance with standards and regulations for the care and use of laboratory rodents set by the National Institutes of Health.\n\n2.2. Induction of diabetes\nMale and female WT and Hsp70 KO mice were randomly assigned to either the non-diabetic or diabetic group. Mice were rendered diabetic with two intraperitoneal injections of 100 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) (Sigma-Aldrich, St louis, MO, #572201) freshly prepared in 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.5 given over two consecutive days. Control mice were treated similarly but received only the vehicle. One week after the second injection, mice were fasted for 6 hrs and those with a fasting blood glucose \u2265290 mg/dl (16 mM) were deemed diabetic (\nMa, et al., 2014\n).\n\n2.3. Mechanical and Thermal Sensitivity Assessments\nTo monitor the development of diabetic neuropathy, the onset of a mechanical and thermal hypoalgesia was determined after the induction of diabetes. Mechanical sensitivity was assessed using a Dynamic Plantar Aesthesiometer (Stoelting Inc.) fitted with a stiff monofilament that was applied to the plantar surface at an upward force of 8g. Thermal sensitivity was assessed by paw withdrawal latency to a ramping, focal heat using a Hargreaves Analgesiometer (Stoelting Inc.). Four responses from each animal were measured two times on each foot with 5 minutes between the measures. The average of all responses from both feet was taken as the weekly measure as we have previously reported (\nMa, et al., 2014\n,\nMa, et al., 2015\n).\n\n2.4. Synthesis of KU-596\nKU-596, N-(2-(5-(((3R,4S,5R)-3,4-Dihydroxy-5-methoxy-6,6-dimethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)-3\u2019-fluoro-[1,1\u2019-biphenyl]-2-yl)ethyl)-acetamide, was synthesized and structural purity (>95%) verified as described previously (\nKusuma, et al., 2012\n).\n\n2.5. Adult DRG sensory neuron isolation\nAfter 12-14 weeks of diabetes, adult sensory neurons were isolated from the non-diabetic and diabetic WT or Hsp70 KO mice as previously described (\nMa, et al., 2014\n). Mice were euthanized via gradual CO\n2\nasphyxiation, the spinal column dissected and the L4\u2013L6 DRG collected from 6 - 8 mice in each group. Connective tissue was removed, and the ganglia were placed in 1 ml serum-free Ham\u2019s F10 medium (Corning, #10-070-CV). The trimmed ganglia were dissociated by incubation in 1 ml of 1.25% collagenase for 45 min at 37 \u00b0C with subsequent addition of 1 ml of 2% trypsin for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Digested cells were centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C and the pellet was further dissociated by trituration with a fire polished glass pipette in F10 medium. The cell suspension was overlain onto a 10 ml gradient of sterile iso-osmotic Percoll (0.9 ml of 10\u00d7 PBS, 6.5 ml H\n2\nO, 2.6 ml Percoll) and centrifuged at 800 \u00d7 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C to remove cell debris and myelin fragments. The cell pellet was re-suspended in fresh F10 medium with N2 supplement (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA). Isolated neurons were plated at a density of 5 \u00d7 10\n3\ncells/well in F10 medium with N2 supplement on 96 well plates that had been coated overnight with 0.1 mg/ml poly-DL-ornithine (Sigma, #P8638) and 2 pg/ml laminin (3 hrs) (Corning, # 354232) (\nMa, et al., 2014\n). After plating, the adult sensory neurons were treated with 1\u03bcM KU-596 or 0.01% DMSO overnight (~16 hrs) and subsequently incubated in F10 medium containing basal glucose (6.1mM) or 26.1 mM glucose for an additional 24 hrs. The cells were then used to assess mtBE or superoxide production.\n\n2.6. Mitochondrial Bioenergetics Assessment and MitoSOX Staining\nSensory neuron mtBE were analyzed using a Seahorse XF96 Analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences, Billerica, MA). After the last incubation in basal or hyperglycemic medium, the cells were placed in bicarbonate free DMEM containing 5.5 mM glucose and 1 mM pyruvate and incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. The plate was then introduced into the Seahorse Analyzer using a 3 minute mix cycle to oxygenate the medium followed by a 4 min measurement of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR). The initial four OCRs provide a measure of basal respiration prior to assessing mitochondrial dysfunction using various respiratory chain inhibitors. The portion of basal OCR that is coupled to ATP synthesis was estimated by the decrease in OCR followed by the addition of 1 \u03bcg/ml oligomycin, an ATP synthase inhibitor (Sigma #75351). Residual OCR remaining after oligomycin treatment is from uncoupled respiration (proton leak). Next, maximal respiratory capacity (MRC) and spare respiratory capacity (SRC) were assessed following dissipation of the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane with 1 \u03bcM of the protonophore FCCP (Sigma #C2920). Non-mitochondrial respiration was then assessed by co-injection of 1\u03bcM rotenone + 1\u03bcM antimycin A (Sigma #R8875, #A8674) (\nMa, et al., 2014\n,\nMa, et al., 2015\n). Oxygen consumption rates were visualized using Wave 2.6.0 and the measures were exported into the Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test Report Generator software to calculate bioenergetic parameters after subtracting background and non-mitochondrial respiratory rates and normalizing to total protein per well (\nBrand and Nicholls, 2011\n).\nSuperoxide levels were measured in black 96-well plates using MitoSOX Red. After the last incubation in basal or hyperglycemic medium, MitoTracker Deep Red (300 nM) and MitoSOX Red (400 nM) were added to each well and the cells incubated for 15 min. After washing, only the cell bodies were imaged using an Olympus 3I Spinning Disk confocal microscope at excitation/emission wavelengths of 488/573 nm (MitoSox Red) and 644/665 nm (MitoTracker Deep Red). Fluorescence density of the red and deep red signals of 35 - 50 cell bodies per treatment was quantified using Image J analysis software (\nZhang, et al., 2012\n).\n\n2.7. Knockdown of MnSOD Expression by shRNA and Superoxide Assessment by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectroscopy Animals\nRecombinant adenoviruses expressing shRNA targeting mouse MnSOD (Ad-GFP-U6-mSOD2-shRNA, #shADV-272843) or scrambled shRNA with GFP (Ad-GFP-U6-scrambled-shRNA, #1122) were purchased from Vector BioLabs (Malvern, PA). To evaluate the silencing efficiency, sensory neurons were infected immediately after plating with either the scrambled shRNA or the mouse MnSOD shRNA for 48 h. Cell lysates were prepared and protein expression was evaluated by immunoblotting with a MnSOD polyclonal antibody (Millipore-Sigma, #06-984).\nImmediately after plating, the isolated sensory neurons were treated with vehicle or 1\u03bcM KU-596 and infected with the scrambled shRNA or MnSOD shRNA adenoviruses (1:50) for 36 h. The cells were then incubated in basal glucose or 26.1 mM glucose for an additional 24 hr. During the final 4 hrs, the cells were incubated with 100 \u03bcM mitoTEMPO-H (1-hydroxy-4-[2-triphenylphosphonio-acetamido]-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, Sigma #SML0737). MitoTEMPO-H is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant and is a specific spin trap for detecting mitochondrial superoxide. The cells from 8 wells were pooled together, pelleted by brief centrifugation, re-suspended in 0.2 ml of fresh F-10 medium and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. When performing the EPR measurements, cells were pipetted into a quartz EPR tube which was inserted into a Bruker EMX plus EPR spectrometer (Billerica, MA, USA). Settings for the spectrometer using Bruker Xenon software were: center field: 3480 G; Sweep width: 100 G; modulation amplitude: 1 G; and time constant, 0.01 s (\nBakalova, et al., 2015\n). The cells were recovered from the cuvette and total protein determined using the microBCA assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Relative changes in the superoxide signal were quantified by integration of the first EPR peak and normalized to total protein content.\n\n2.8. Statistical Analysis\nOne-way ANOVA, and multivariate-ANOVA were conducted for between-group comparison using Minitab Software or SAS. Post-hoc analysis was applied to determine differences between treatments using Tukey\u2019s test and Wilks' lambda test. All data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals.\nHeterozygous\nB4galnt1\n(+/\u2212) breeders were generously provided by Drs. Ledeen and Wu of Rutgers School of Medicine (Newark, NJ, USA), to generate our mouse colony. Genotyping was performed by PCR as previously described (\nWu et al., 2001\n). For this study, we evaluated a cohort of male and female WT (+/+) mice that express two copies of GM2 Synthase, and GM2 Synthase KO mice that totally lack GM2 Synthase (\u2212/\u2212) expression, from 9\u201323 months of age. Animals were maintained on 12-hr light/dark cycles with access to food and water\nad libitum\nexcept during 1 hour urinary pattern tests as described below. All experiments were conducted using protocols approved by the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) in accordance with AALAC and National Institutes of Health guidelines.\n\n2.2. Behavioral Tests and Other Measures.\nOpen Field\n.(N = 20, 9 WT and 11 KO). Locomotor activity was assessed using a TruScan\u2122 open field activity monitor (Coulbourn Instruments, Whitehall, PA, USA). Mice were acclimated to the test room for 15 min prior to being placed individually in the center of the arena with total movement monitored for 15 minutes. Total movement was measured as successive coordinate movements made across the floor plane while mice were continuously active. Mice were tested in random order on two independent occasions essentially as previously described (\nFarrell et al., 2014\n).\nUrination Patterns\n.(N = 26, 15 WT and 11 KO). Food and water were removed during tests. Five independent tests were conducted per mouse per group at each time point. Each mouse was individually placed in a clean cage for 1 hour (10:00\u201311:00 am) with the cage bottom covered with a fitted clean white filter paper (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA, cat# 1650962) as shown in\nFigure 1a\n. Filter papers were collected, labeled, and allowed to dry. Urine spots illuminated with UV light allowed spots to be categorized as small (\u2264 0.2 cm\n2\n) or large (> 0.2 cm\n2\n) and counted by individuals blinded to genotypes, using established methods (\nBirder et al., 2002\n;\nBjorling et al., 2015\n;\nHamill et al., 2012\n;\nHodges et al., 2008\n;\nStudeny et al., 2008\n;\nYu et al., 2014\n). If overlapping urine spots were detected, they were not included in the counts. An image of a UV illuminated filter shows large and small urine spots that can be easily differentiated (\nFigure 1b\n).\nWater Intake\n. (N = 10, 5 WT and 5 KO). Mice were individually housed in cages with water delivered from a 50 mL conical tube sealed with a #7 single hole rubber stopper containing a double-ball water sipper. Tubes were weighed before testing and the next morning in order to calculate water intake.\nBladder Volumes\n. (N = 15, 8 WT and 7 KO). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and abdomens were shaved with electric clippers. Post void bladder volumes were measured by ultrasonography using a moveable Real Time 4D Volume probe with data collected by associated imaging software (Voluson\u00ae VE8/VE8 Expert General Electric\u00ae Health Care; Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, USA). Briefly, the transducer was coated with ultrasound gel (McKesson Ultrasound Gel PINK; McKesson Medical\u2013Surgical, Richmond, VA, USA), placed at a 45\u00b0 degree angle on the abdomen and moved until the bladder image appeared on the monitor. Bladder volumes were calculated by measuring bladder length and depth according to established methods (\nAl-Izki et al., 2009\n).\nFigure 1. Void spot method to assess urinary patterns in GM2 Synthase KO and WT mice.\nOpen in a new tab\n(\na\n) A GM2 Synthase KO mouse is shown in a cage with a filter paper covering the entire bottom surface. Damp urine spots, circled in red, can be seen on the filter. (\nb\n) A representative image of two large and many small void spots on a dried filter illuminated by UV light, on which spot sizes were easily discernable for measurement and counting using established methods. (N = 26, 15 WT and 11 KO).\n\n2.3. Tissue Collection and Sample Preparation.\nMice were euthanized by CO\n2\ninhalation followed by decapitation. Bladder and brain tissues were dissected and prepared as described below.\nImmunohistochemistry\n. Brains (N = 6 WT, 6 KO) were collected and post-fixed in 4% formaldehyde/sucrose overnight. Tissues were immunostained free-floating using antibodies for aSyn (C20, sc-7011-R, Santa Cruz, CA, 1:100) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; chicken anti-TH, Aves Labs, Tigard, OR, 1:200\u20131:250) followed by secondary antibodies, then evaluated by confocal microscopy using the Olympus FluoView 1000 with quantification as previously described (\nAlerte et al., 2008\n;\nFarrell et al., 2014\n;\nVidal-Martinez et al., 2016\n) or with the EVOS Cell Imaging System (Thermo-Fisher, USA) and ImageJ Software (\nRueden et al., 2017\n).\nTransmission electron microscopy\n. (N = 2 WT, 2 KO). We followed traditional protocols for fixing and embedding tissues. Briefly, bladders with the bladder base and major pelvic ganglia intact, were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4\u00b0C then washed with 10 mL of 0.1 M imidazole-HCl buffer at pH 7.2 and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M imidazole buffer at room temperature. Epoxy resin embedded-tissue samples were trimmed and regions of interest were surveyed in semi-thin sections stained with a methylene blue dye mixture (\nRichardson et al., 1960\n) on glass microscope slides with a bright field optical microscope. Thin sections of tissue regions, including selected bundles of nerve fibers and nerve cells, were cut with a diamond knife and mounted on 100 mesh copper grids, followed by staining with 2% uranyl acetate solution and lead citrate. Grids were examined at 80 kV accelerating voltage on a model H-7650 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi High Technologies, Dallas, TX) with digital images collected using a mid-mount CCD camera system and acquisition software (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Woburn, MA).\nImmunoblots\n. For standard immunoblots, tissues were homogenized in 8 volumes (w/v) ice-cold buffer containing 1 mM AEBSF, 5 \u03bcM aprotinin and 5 \u03bcM leupeptin using a Bullet Blender (Next Advance, Inc., Averill Park, NY, USA). Samples were then sonicated (Sonic Dismembrator Model 100, Thermo-Fisher, USA) and spun at 14,000\u00d7g, 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove particulates.\nSequential protein extraction\nto separate soluble from insoluble proteins uses a series of buffers and pellet re-extractions performed with ultracentrifugation as previously described (\nVidal-Martinez et al., 2016\n;\nWaxman and Giasson, 2008\n;\nWu et al., 2012b\n). (N = 7, 1 A53T, 3 WT, and 3 KO). Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo-Fisher, USA). Gels, loaded with 50 \u03bcg total protein per sample, were transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked in 5% non-fat milk and incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. Immunoblot antibodies included aSyn (C20, sc-7011-R, Santa Cruz, CA), proNGF (H-20, sc-548, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and \u03b2-actin (4970S, Cells Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). Secondary antibodies IRDye 800CW (green) or 680RD (red) produced infrared fluorescence for capture using the Li-Cor Odyssey system (Lincoln, NE, USA).\n\n2.4. Statistical Analysis.\nData from WT and GM2 Synthase KO mice were analyzed by independent sample\nt\n-tests or two way ANOVA, as appropriate to the data, using Prism 6 or InStat (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), with significance levels set to p < 0.05 and variability shown as the standard error of the mean."

MuSK MG patients were recruited during visits to the MG Clinics at Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. All patients had detectable anti-MuSK antibodies according to commercially available testing (Athena Diagnostics, Worcester, MA), in addition to clinical and electrodiagnostic features consistent with MG. Key clinical information including demographics, disease duration, pharmacologic treatments, thymectomy status, Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) severity class, and MG manual muscle testing (MG-MMT) (\nTable 1\n) were collected. Control subjects were matched for age and gender as closely as possible, weighed more than 110 pounds, were not receiving therapy for any chronic disease, and had no prior history of autoimmune disease.

Isolation and storage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)\nPeripheral blood was obtained by venipuncture and collected in acid-citrate-dextrose tubes (BD Vacutainer, Franklin Lake, NJ). PBMCs were separated by Ficoll (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) density gradient centrifugation, washed and counted prior to storage. Cells were re-suspended in a 90% FBS (Gemini, West Sacramento, CA) and 10% DMSO (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) solution, and pro gressively cooled to \u221280\u00b0C in a CoolCell cell freezing container (BioCision, Larkspur, CA). The next day, the cells were stored in vapor phase liquid nitrogen for future use.\n\n2.3. VPD450 labelling\nPBMCs were thawed and washed with RPMI medium contained 10% FBS (R10) twice, and the number of cells and viability calculated. PBMCs were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice to remove residual proteins from previous buffer and then re-suspended in PBS in a polypropylene test tube. Violet proliferation dye 450 (VPD450, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) (1\u03bcl per 1ml cells suspension) was added and cells were incubated for 15 min in a 37\u00b0C water bath. After incubation, PBMCs were washed once in PBS and once in R10. The sample was then re-suspended in R10 and used for culturing in different conditions for 72 hours before acquisition on LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Proliferation index (the total number of divisions, divided by the number of cells that went into division) and division index (the average number of cell divisions) were determined using Flowjo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).\n\n2.3. PBMC culture with Tacrolimus\nPBMCs were equally split into four parts and plated in 96-well U bottom plates in RPMI with 10% FBS (R10). Cells were cultured with 1\u03bcg/ml anti-CD3 and 1\u03bcg/ml anti-CD28, in the absence or presence of 0, 10, or 100ng/ml tacrolimus (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Concentrations were chosen based on published information showing that 5\u201310ng/ml is regarded as the therapeutic trough concentration for usual dosing in MG patients, while 100ng/ml is approximately the peak concentration (\nKanai et al., 2017\n). Cells were cultured for 3 or 7 days at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO\n2\nin a humidified incubator, and 5 hours prior to harvesting the cells, PBMCs were re-stimulated with 1 \u03bcg/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.25\u03bcg/mL ionomycin (IONO, Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of brefeldin A (BD Biosciences).Then, the phenotypic, molecular, and functional characterization of the PBMCs was performed as described below.\n\n2.4. Surface and intracellular cytokine staining\nCultured cells were stained with 50uL of LIVE/DEAD violet dye (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature, to exclude dead cells from the analysis. Next, cell surface antigens were stained with a cocktail mix consisting of titrated volumes of anti-CD3 APC-Cy7, anti-CD4 BV785, anti-CD8 AlexaFluor 700, and anti-CXCR5 PE-Cy7 for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Following cell surface staining, cells were treated with cytofix/cytoperm (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Intracellular staining was then performed for 30 min at 4\u00b0C using the following conjugates: anti- IFN-\u03b3 FITC, anti-IL-17A PerCP-Cy5.5, anti-IL-2 APC, and anti-IL-4 PE-Dazzle 594. Anti-IL-2 APC antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences, while other cytokine fluorescent antibodies were purchased from Biolegend. Cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and acquired on a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).\n\n2.5. FOXP3 staining\nPBMCs were plated in a 96-well round bottom plate and stained with LIVE/DEAD violet dye (described above), then cells were stained with anti-CD8 AlexaFluor 7000, anti-CD3 APC- Cy7, anti-CD4 BV785, anti-CD25 BV421 for 30 minutes in 4\u00b0C. Anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8 and anti-CD25 were obtained from Biolegend. Following cell surface staining, cells were treated for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C with the FOXP3/Transcription Factor Fixation/Permeabilization buffer according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Intra-nuclear staining was then performed for 30 min at 4\u00b0C with anti-FOXP3 PE (Biolegend). Cells were fixed with 1% PFA and acquired on a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).\n\n2.6. Data analysis and statistics\nFlow cytometry analysis was performed using Flowjo software (Tree Star). Paired or unpaired student T-tests were used to determine statistical significance between two matched or unmatched groups, respectively. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to compare the differences among three groups. Tukey HSD test were used for post-hoc analysis. The p values were calculated using Prism software (Graph Pad, La Jolla, CA)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nA total of 281 mice were used. Adult male C57BL/6 (8\u201310 weeks old, JAX Stock 000664), VTN transgenic mice (JAX Stock 004371) and GFAP-cre mice (B6.Cg-Tg(GFAP- cre/ERT2)505Fmv/J, JAX Stock 012849) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. FAK- flox mice (B6; 129X1\n-Ptk2\ntm1Lfr\n/Mmucd,\nRRID:MMRRC_009967-UCD) were purchased from MMRRC at University of California at Davis. To produce experimental VTN+/+ and VTN\u2212/\u2212 littermates, heterozygous mice were bred and genotyping was performed using tail snips and protocols provided by the suppliers. For inducible conditional astrocytic FAK knockout mice, GFAP-cre mice were bred with FAK-flox mice to generate hemizygous mice who were further backcrossed with FAK-flox mice to produce FAK-flox GFAP-cre mice (FAK\nfl/fl\n- GFAP\ncre\n) and FAK-flox (FAK\nfl/fl\n, used as control) littermates. The Ai6 mice (B6.Cg- Gt(ROSA)26Sor\ntm6(CAG-ZsGreen 1)Hze\n, JAX Stock 007906) were obtained from Dr. Diego Rodriguez-Gil\u2019s laboratory at ETSU. Homozygous Ai6 mice were bred with GFAP-cre mice to produce GFAP-cre-ZsGreen reporter (GFAP\ncre-ZsGreen\n) and Ai6 heterozygous (used as control) mice. Tamoxifen (i.p., 100 mg/kg, twice a day for 5 days, T5648, Sigma-Aldrich) was used to induce Cre recombinase-mediated excision of LoxP sites. Experiments included both male and female mice at 8\u201312 weeks of age and no sex difference was detected in any of experiments. All procedures were approved by our University Committee on Animal Care and were in compliance with the NIH Guide on Care and Use of Animals.\n\nIntrastriatal stereotactic injections\nIntrastriatal injections next to the SVZ were performed as before (\nKang et al., 2012\n). Briefly, 1 \u03bcl of test drug was injected into the middle of the striatum in one or both sides of the brain at coordinates \u22121 mm rostrocaudal, 1.5 mm lateral from bregma and 3.5 mm dorsoventral from the dura. The injected drugs included PBS, vehicle (1% DMSO), rabbit IgG (AP160-KC, Millipore), rabbit anti- mouse VTN antibody (8.2 \u03bcg/\u03bcl, Ab62769, Abcam, RRID:AB_956454), recombinant human VTN (rhVTN, 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl, Sigma, SRP3186), rhVTN+SC144 (3.6 ng/\u03bcl, #4963) or FAK14 (2.4 \u03bcg/\u03bcl, Tocris Bioscience, #3414). The SVZ was collected 3 or 24 h later and stored at \u221280 degree for mRNA and protein extraction. SC144 has been identified as a selective gp130 inhibitor by directly binding to the gp130 receptor, causing its Ser782 phosphorylation and deglycosylation, and subsequent degradation. This reduces downstream intracellular activation of STAT3 and Akt by the gp130 ligands, IL-6 and LIF (\nGrande et al., 2016\n;\nXu et al., 2013a\n). However, SC144 has no effect on activation of STAT3 and Akt caused by non-gp130 cytokines, interferon\ny\nand stromal cell-derived factor 1a, and platelet-derived growth factor (\nXu et al., 2013a\n), suggesting it is selective for gp130 over other types of receptors tested. Those investigators suggested that it can bind to and stabilize IL-24, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells (\nXu et al., 2013b\n). However, IL-24 is undetectable by in situ hybridization in the brain, including the SVZ (Allen Brain Atlas), and SC144 alone did not affect SVZ cell proliferation or neuroblast numbers in mice (\nFig. 5\n). To label proliferating cells in na\u00efve mice or following intrastriatal injections, mice were injected with BrdU (i.p.) at 50 mg/kg twice a day for 3 days and perfused with ice- cold PBS and 4% PFA 2 h after last injection. In the SC144 experiment they were injected with BrdU at 144 mg/kg at 21, 24 and 27 h and perfused at 48 h.\nFigure 5.

Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (blue).\nI\n) Cell counts in the SVZ confirmed that VTN/SC144 increased the number of DCX-positive neuroblasts (*** p<0.001, Two-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey multiple comparison test).\nJ\n) Representative confocal images of DCX (red) and BrdU (green) immunostaining in the dorsolateral SVZ of the same adult C57BL/6 mice.\nK\n) Quantification of BrdU--DCX co-labeled cells in the SVZ confirmed that VTN/SC144 increased neurogenesis (*** p<0.001, Two-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey multiple comparison test).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nCoronal sections (30 \u03bcm) through the brain, and sections through the heart and liver were stained with the rabbit anti-mouse vitronectin antibody (1:1000, ab62769, Abcam) alone or together with one of the following: goat anti-DCX (1:500, SC-8066, Santa Cruz, RRID:AB_2088494), mouse anti-GFAP (1:1000, MAB3402, Millipore, RRID:AB_94844), rat anti-CD31 (1:500, #550274, BD Pharmingen, RRID:AB_393571), Goat anti-CD13 (1:50, AF2335, R&D Systems, RRID:AB_2227288) or rat anti-PDGFR\u03b2 (1:500, #14\u20131402-82, Invitrogen, RRID:AB_467493) antibody, and followed by Alex Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and Alex Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-goat, mouse or rat secondary antibody (all from Invitrogen) to visualize the positive immunofluorescent staining. The nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst. The specificity of the VTN antibody was validated by detecting no staining in tissue from VTN\u2212/\u2212 mice stained with primary and secondary antibody, and wildtype tissue stained with purified IgG instead of primary antibody or staining with primary or secondary antibody alone. We also tested a number of other commercially available VTN antibodies. R&D MAB38751 (RRID:AB_2216439) and Santa Cruz SC74484 (RRID:AB_1131298) did not show any staining in brain tissue. Abcam ab28023 (RRID:AB_778869), Abcam ab45139 (RRID:AB_778872), and Molecular Innovations ASMVN, lightly stained SVZ processes in both VTN+/+ and VTN\u2212/\u2212 brain tissue sections. ASMVN also revealed small striatal neurons in both genotypes. Only the Abcam ab62769 antibody (RRID:AB_956454) showed specific staining (in pericytes) and revealed no immunoreactivity in KO tissue, validating it as specific. Finally, to confirm cre activity in the cre-lox mice, we used rabbit anti-ZsGreen 1 (1:1000, #632474, Clontech Laboratories, RRID:AB_2491179) antibody followed by donkey anti-rabbit secondary conjugated to Alex Fluor 488 to visualized ZsGreen 1 protein expression in brain sections.\n\nUnbiased and stereological analysis for BrdU-positive nuclei\nEvery sixth 30 \u03bcm thick coronal section through the SVZ along rostrocaudal axis (total six sections/brain) were stained with BrdU using rat anti-BrdU antibody (1:1000, ab6326, Abcam RRID:AB_305426) or stained with BrdU and DCX using rat anti-BrdU antibody and goat anti- DCX antibody as described previously (\nJia and Hegg, 2015\n). Unbiased stereological analysis of BrdU-positive cells in the SVZ was performed using a motorized Leica DMIRE2 microscope and an optical fractionator stereological method (Stereologer, System Planning and Analysis, Alexandria, VA) by researchers blinded to the treatment (\nKang et al., 2013a\n). The numbers of DCX-positive and DCX-BrdU co-labeled neuroblasts in the most populated dorsolateral part of SVZ (640 \u03bcm x 480 \u03bcm) in every sixth section through SVZ were also counted by researchers blinded to the treatments. The DCX-positive cells were defined by their DCX-positive cytoplasm surrounding Hoechst-labeled or BrdU-labeled nuclei. The quantification of VTN-positive cells in the dorsolateral SVZ and medial striatum, and PDGFR\u03b2-VTN co-labeled or CD13-VTN co-labeled cells in the dorsolateral SVZ was performed in the z-stacks of confocal pictures with an area of 465 \u03bcm x 465 \u03bcm (3 sections each mouse and two images including left and right side each section).\n\nProtein and mRNA analyses\nThe CNTF, pFAK, FAK, pPyk2, Pyk2, pILK, ILK, pERK, ERK and a-tubulin proteins in the SVZ were detected with western blotting as described previously (\nKeasey et al., 2013\n) with the following antibodies: CNTF (1:500, MAB338, RRID:AB_2083064), pFAK (1:1000, #3283, RRID:AB_10327658), FAK (1:1000, #3285,RRID:AB_2269034), pPyk2 (1:1000, #3291,RRID:AB_2300530), Pyk2 antibody (1:1000, #3480,RRID:AB_2174093), pILK (1:1000, AB1076,RRID:AB_10807157), ILK (1:1000, 04\u20131149,RRID:AB_1977290), pERK (1:2000, #9106,RRID:AB_331768), ERK (1:2000, #9102,RRID:AB_330744) and \u03b1-tubulin (1:2000, #2125,RRID:AB 2619646). The levels of pFAK and \u03b1-tubulin were also quantitatively measured by WES Quantitative Capillary Electrophoresis according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (ProteinSimple, PS-MK01) as described previously (\nKeasey et al., 2018\n;\nVisavadiya et al., 2016\n). Briefly, tissue homogenates (1 \u03bcg protein, 0.2 \u03bcg/\u03bcl) mixed with fluorescent molecular weight markers were loaded into 24 single designated wells followed by antibody diluent, mixture primary antibodies (1:25, pFAK and 1:200, a tubulin, in antibody diluent), anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and luminol-peroxide mixture and wash buffer loaded into different wells aligned with tissue samples. Plates were loaded into the automated ProteinSimple Wes for electrophoresis and fluorescence imaged in real time by a CCD camera. Data was expressed as peak intensity or synthetic bands.\nThe quantification was performed by normalizing the area under pFAK peak to \u03b1-tubulin loading control in each capillary and then the values were normalized to the average of PBS. IL-6 and LIF protein levels in the SVZ were measured using ELISA according to manufacturer\u2019s protocols (R & D system, IL-6, M6000B, LIF, MLF00). Briefly, 25 \u03bcg total protein from SVZ tissue homogenate in 50 ^l was run together with standard curve in duplications.\nThe mRNA levels of CNTF, LIF and IL-6 in the SVZ were measured by RT-qPCR as described previously (\nKang et al., 2013a\n). To detect differences in the low basal levels of CNTF, LIF and IL-6 in the SVZ between VTN+/+ and VTN\u2212/\u2212 mice we used semi-nested RT- qPCR following a previously described method (\nPasternak et al., 2008\n) with modifications. Briefly, cDNA was reverse transcribed from 20 ng SVZ RNA was PCR amplified for 5, 10, 15 or 20 cycles to test the optimal cycle numbers for pre-amplification. Primers for CNTF (Mm00446373_m1), IL-6 (Mm00446190_m1) and LIF (Mm00434762_g1) were from Life Technologies. We chose 20 cycles since the amplification curve displayed an exponential phase for all genes at 20 cycles. PCR conditions for pre-amplification were 20 s at 95 \u00b0C (ramp rate 1.9 \u00b0C/s) for initial denaturation and then 20 cycles of 1 s at 95 \u00b0C (1.9 \u00b0C/s ramp rate) followed by 20 s at 60 \u00b0C (ramp rate 1.6 \u00b0C/s) for amplification. The pre-amplification of cDNA was performed in duplicates on a QuantStudio 6 Flex (Applied Biosystems) in total 5 \u03bcl reaction per well of 384 well plate. The PCR products from pre-amplification were pooled for each sample and 1 \u03bcl of pre-amplification product was used for semi-nested, real-time qPCR as described previously (\nKeasey et al., 2018\n).\n\nStatistical analyses.\nStatistical analyses were performed using graphpad Prism (version 7). A value of\np \u2264\n0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. A one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni\npost hoc\nmultiple comparisons was applied when there were three or more groups with testing for one factor. A two-way ANOVA with\npost hoc\nTukey multiple comparisons was used when the groups were four or more and there were two factors to be tested, such as genotypes and treatments. If only two groups were compared, a Student\u2019s t-test was used."

Mice were maintained in a Specific Pathogen Free\n(SPF) barrier facility with a 14-hour light/10-hour dark cycle and access to\nfood and water\nad libitum\n. Mice were genotyped by PCR as\npreviously described (\nMiller et al.,\n2014\n). All animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the\nNorthwestern University Animal Care and Use Committees in accordance with the\nNational Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory\nAnimals.\n\n2.2. Seizure Monitoring\nPrior to euthanasia on P24,\nF1.\nScn1a\n+/\u2212\nmice were monitored for\nspontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) by continuous\nvideo-monitoring as previously described (\nAnderson et al., 2017\n;\nHawkins et\nal., 2017\n;\nHawkins et al.,\n2016\n). Briefly, mice were placed in a recording chamber (28 \u00d7\n28 \u00d7 36 cm) and overhead video was captured using a Day/Night camera\nequipped with an infrared lens. During recording, mice had\nad\nlibitum\naccess to food and water, and were maintained on a 14:10\nlight-dark cycle. Digital video images captured during the video-monitoring\nsession were analyzed offline for the occurrence of spontaneous GTCS prior to\npooling of tissue for RNA isolation. Previous video-EEG monitoring of\nF1.\nScn1a\n+/\u2212\nmice showed a perfect\ncorrelation between behavioral and electroencephalographic seizures\n(\n\u03ba\n= 1.0), supporting non-invasive video monitoring\nas a reliable assay for GTCS detection (\nHawkins\net al., 2017\n;\nHawkins et al.,\n2016\n).\n\n2.3. RNA Sample Preparation\nHippocampi were dissected from 129 and [129 x B6]F1 WT and\nScn1a\n+/\u2212\nmice at P14 and P24. Primary\npools for all groups without seizures were created by combining tissue from both\nmale (n = 2) and female (n = 2). For the P24 seizure cohort, primary pools were\ncreated by combining tissue from 3 or 4 mice (at least one from each sex) with\nseizure counts ranging from 3 to 7 in the 24 hours prior to collection. Mice\nthat had one or two GTCS prior to collection were excluded from the study. Total\nRNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions (Life Technologies). Following RNA isolation, RNA integrity was\nassessed and all samples had a RIN of \u2265 7.7. For each group without\nseizures, 2\u20133 superpooled biological replicates were generated by\ncombining total RNAs from 3\u20134 primary pools (n = 12\u2013 16\nmice/superpool) (\nFig. 1A\n). For the P24\nseizure cohort, the primary pools were used as biological replicates\n(n=3\u20134 mice/sample). RNA integrity was measured on the superpool samples\nand all samples had RIN of \u2265 8.1.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nIsolation and RNA-seq profiling of wild-type (WT)\nScn1a\n+/\u2212\nmice on 129 and F1strains at\nP14 and P24.\nA)\nSchematic showing collection and pooling of samples\ncomprising the nine experimental groups.

RNA-Seq\nSamples were processed for RNA-Seq using the TruSeq RNA Library\nPreparation Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Samples were sequenced on an\nIllumina HiSeq 4000 at BGI (Hong Kong, China). Three multiplexed lanes of 50-bp\nsingle-end sequencing resulted in almost 167 million mapped reads. Base calling\nand filtering of sequence reads were performed with the Illumina pipeline (\nBentley et al., 2008\n). Bioinformatic\nanalysis was performed on the GALAXY platform (\nAfgan et al., 2010\n;\nBlankenberg et\nal., 2010\n;\nGiardine et al.,\n2005\n). FastQ files were groomed using FastQ groomer (v. 1.0.4)\naligned to the mm10 mouse genome with\nTophat2\n(v. 2.1.0) (\nKim et al., 2013\n). Counts were calculated\nwith HTSeq (union overlap mode; v. 0.6.1p1) and differential expression was\nassessed with DESeq2 (v. 2.11.38) (\nLove et al.,\n2014\n). Differentially expressed genes were clustered based on\nlog\n2\n(normalized expression) and heatmaps were generated using\ngplots for R. Gene sets were evaluated for intersections using Venny (v. 2.1.0)\n(\nOliveros, 2007\u20132015\n),\nmammalian phenotype (MP) ontology, gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment\nusing MouseMine (hypergeometric distribution with Holm-Bonferroni correction)\nand functional and protein-protein interaction enrichment using STRING (v. 10.5)\n(FDR adjusted\nP\n-values) (\nMotenko et al., 2015\n;\nSzklarczyk et\nal., 2017\n).\nRNA-seq data discussed in this publication have been deposited in\nNCBI\u2019s Gene Expression Omnibus (\nEdgar et\nal., 2002\n) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number\nGSE112627\n(\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112627\n).\n\n2.5. ddRT-PCR\nFirst-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 micrograms of total RNA using\noligo(dT) primer and Superscript IV reverse transcriptase according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions (Life Techologies). First-strand cDNA samples\nwere diluted to be within the linear range for each assay based on empirical\ndetermination with serial dilution. Quantitative digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) was\nperformed using ddPCR Supermix for Probes (No dUTP) (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)\nand TaqMan Assays as previously described (\nHawkins and Kearney, 2016\n). Taqman gene expression assays (Life\nTechnologies) were: mouse Blnk (FAM-MGB-Mm01197846_m1); Gal\n(FAM-MGB-Mm00439056_m1); Cdk18 (FAM-MGB-Mm00432448_m1); Aspg\n(FAM-MGB-Mm01339695_m1); Gldn (FAM-MGB-Mm00616548_m1); Serpine1\n(FAM-MGB-Mm00435858_m1); Timp1 (FAM-MGB-Mm01341361_m1); Prss23\n(FAM-MGB-Mm01972869_s1); Vim (FAM-MGB--Mm013333430_m1); Gfap\n(VIC-MGB-Mm01253033_m1); Tbp (VIC-MGB-Mm00446971_m1); Gapdh\n(VIC-MGB-Mm99999915_g1). Relative transcript levels were expressed as a\nconcentration ratio of the gene of interest to Tbp (\nAspg, Blnk, Cdkn1a,\nGal, Gldn, Prss23, Serpine1, Timp1\n) or Gapdh (\nGfap,\nVim\n).\n\n2.6. Immunoblotting\nHippocampal protein was isolated from P24 mice following seizure\nmonitoring as described above. Proteins (50 \u03bcg per lane) were separated\non a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots\nwere probed for GFAP using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:500; G9269, Sigma\nAldrich) and for Mortalin using a mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000; NeuroMab,\nclone 75\u2013127). Alexa-conjugated fluorescent anti-rabbit 790 and\nanti-mouse 680 secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:20,000) were used\nto detect bound primary antibody using an Odyssey imaging system (Licor).\nRelative protein levels were determined by densitometry using ImageStudio\nsoftware (Licor) and expressed as a ratio of GFAP to anti-mortalin, with n=3\nbiological replicates.\n\n2.7. cFos Immunhistochemistry\nF1.\nScn1a\n+/\u2212\nmice were continuously\nvideo monitored from P21-P25 as described above. Video was rapidly reviewed\nmultiple times per day to identify seizures and schedule perfusions\npost-seizure. Control tissue was obtained from\nF1.\nScn1a\n+/\u2212\nlittermates confirmed on\nvideo to have not experienced a seizure in a minimum of 4\u20137 hours\npreceding perfusion. Mice were deeply anesthetized with Euthasol (100 mg/kg,\nintraperitoneal) and transcardially perfused with 0.1 M phosphate buffer\nfollowed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Brains were removed\nand postfixed overnight, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and sectioned at 40\nmicrons. Free-floating coronal sections were processed for cFos immunoreactivity\nwith primary rabbit anti-c-Fos antibody (Cell Signaling Technology #2250;\n1:3000). Signal was visualized using a VECTASTAIN Elite ABC HRP Kit (Vector\nLabs; PK-6101) and. Signal was detected using 3,3\u2032-Diaminobenzidine\ntetrahydrochloride with CoCl\n2\nenhancement (Sigma-Aldrich # D0426).\nSections were imaged on a TissueGnostics imaging platform with a 20X objective\nwith automated image stitching."

    "Methods": "In vitro studies:\nCell Culture and Oxygen Glucose Deprivation (OGD):\nHuman brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMEC) were purchased from Millipore Corp. MA (hCMEC/D3,) and grown with EndoGro medium (Millipore Corp. MA) on type I collagen-coated T-75 flasks. For experiments, cells (5\u00d710\n4\n) were plated either on collagen-coated coverslips or in 96-well plates and maintained until confluent. Cultures were grown in normoxic conditions (5% CO2 and 21% O2; 37\u00b0C) until confluent. Cells were then subject to OGD (1% O2, 95% N2 and 5% CO2 in glucose free DMEM) for 6 h with IGF-1 (10ng/ml), IGF-l+JB-1 (IGF-1 receptor antagonist; 2 ng/ml), IGF1+ LY294002 (reversible PI3-kinase inhibitor, 1ug/ml) and rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor, 1ug/ml) or vehicle (PBS or DMSO). Culture media was collected for assays and cells were fixed for histological analysis. All assays were conducted with 3-5 replicate runs and each run consisted of 5-6 technical replicates.\nQuantitative (q)RT-PCR\nHuman IGFlR mRNA expression in hBMEC was assessed using real-time qRT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted using QIAzol reagent and RNA Mini extraction kit (Qiagen, CA) using our previous procedures (\nOkoreeh et al., 2017\n). RNA yield and purity were evaluated with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies/Thermo Scientific). 100 ng of purified total RNA was used to generate cDNA, using a cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quantbio, MA) following manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was diluted 80 fold and real time PCR reaction were run on Applied Biosystems 7900HT real-time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems, CA) using a SYBR green-based real-time PCR reaction kit (Quantabio, MA). 18s mRNA was used as a normalization control. Human IGF-lR (Forward:5'-\nTTA AGA ACC AGT GGC GAA AG\n-3',Reverse: 5'-\nGGA GCA CTC ACT TCT CCA AA\n-3' Realtime primers, PA) and 18S primers (Forward:%\u2019- ATGGCCGTTCTTAGTTGGTG -3\u2019; Reverse: 5\u2019-\nCGCTGAGCC AGTCAGTGTAG\n-3 \u2019, Life Technologies, CA).\nCell death/survival assays\nLDH assay\nCell death was estimated by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in media immediately after collection, using a colorimetric assay (Thermofisher, MA) and our previous procedures (\nBake et al., 2016\n). Briefly, 50 \u03bcL of culture media was added to each well of a 96-well plate and mixed with catalyst and dye substrate mixture. After incubation for 30 min, 50 ul of stop solution was added to each well and the plate was read at 490 nm absorbance on a colorometric plate reader (Tecan, Switzerland).\nCalcein assay:\nCell viability was determined using the Calcein-AM dye (Life Technologies, CA). After OGD, cells were incubated with calcein-AM (2.5 \u03bcm) in PBS for 20 min at 37\u00b0C and the fluorescence was measured on a plate reader (Tecan, Switzerland) with excitation/ emission set at 480 and 530 nm respectively.\nPhalloidin Staining\nEndothelial cells grown on coverslips were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and then permeabilized in 0.1% triton-X and washed three times with PBS. Cells were then incubated with 3% BSA for 20 min followed by two washes and stained with Alexafluor 488 phalloidin (Life technologies, CA) for 30 min, washed with PBS and mounted with Prolong antifade mounting media (Life technologies, CA). Images were captured on the FSX100 Olympus microscope.\nVinculin immunohistochemistry\nEndothelial cells grown on coverslips were processed for immunohistochemistry using our previously published procedures (\nBake et al., 2016\n). Briefly, cells were incubated in a blocking solution (2% normal goat serum and 2% triton X-100 in dPBS) for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by incubation with the antibody for vinculin (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, 1:100) overnight. Following 3 PBS washes, cells were then incubated for lh with fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse, 1:500 dilution) and were counterstained with nuclear dye (Hoechst, 1:500) and coverslipped with Prolong antifade mounting media (Life technologies, CA). Images were captured using an Olympus confocal microscope.\nLectin Staining\nIn vitro analysis: Endothelial cells grown on coverslips were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and then permeabilized in 0.1% triton-X and washed three times with PBS. Cells were then incubated with 3% BSA for 20 min followed by two washes and stained with lectin (1:1000, Vector Laboratories, CA) for 30 min, washed with PBS and mounted with Prolong antifade mounting media. Images were captured on the FSX100 Olympus microscope.\nDetermination of intercellular spaces\n: Lectin-stained cell cultures (3 experimental replicates) were photographed, coded and analyzed for continuity of the monolayer using a novel algorithm to determine intercellular \u2018spaces\u2019. Briefly, all images were first converted into grayscale images. A threshold was calibrated for each image to convert the grayscale image into a black and white one, such that cells are in white and everything else remains black. Thus, the total number of gaps between cells in each image was estimated by the total number of black pixels. Once the cells were identified, the two images were overlaid to find all the cells and the near empty areas in the image. The spaces near cells were calculated using the Canny edge detection algorithm. The above algorithm was coded in Python and OpenCV.\n\nIn vivo studies\nAnimals\nFemale Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were purchased as retired breeders (10-12 months; weight range 325 - 350 g) from Envigo Laboratories (previously Harlan Labs, IN). This group met our previously established criteria for reproductive senescence, namely, at least five successful pregnancies and current acyclicity determined by daily vaginal smears. All animals were housed in an AAALAC-approved facility, maintained on a constant photoperiod (12-hour light/dark cycles), and fed ad libitum with laboratory chow (Harlan Teklad 8604) and water. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the humane care of laboratory animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee and the Institutional Biosafety Committee. A total of 55 animals were used in this study, with 7-9 animals per group for behavioral analysis and 5-6 animals per group for histological analysis."

Brainbow mice\nstochastically express GFP, YFP, CFP or RFP upon cre-recombination (Cai et al. 2013).\n\nBrainbow-expressing PTEN knockout mice\nStudy animals were generated by crossing\nGli1-CreER\nT2\nhemizygous;\nPTEN\nflox/wt\n;\nBrainbow\n+/+\ntriple transgenic mice to\nPTEN\nflox/wt\n;\nBrainbow\n+/+\ndouble transgenic mice. The cross\nwas used to generate the following genotypes:\n1)\nGli1-CreER\nT2\nhemizygous;\nPTEN\nwt/wt\n;\nBrainbow\n+/+\n(Control, n=9 male\nmice)\n2)\nGli1\n-\nCreER\nT2\nhemizygous;\nPTEN\nflox/flox\n;\nBrainbow\n+/+\n(PTEN knockout [KO],\nn=11 male mice).\nAll mice were injected with tamoxifen (Sigma Aldrich, T5648; 250 mg/kg\ndissolved at 20 mg/ml in corn oil, S.C) on post-natal day (P) 21 to delete PTEN\nand express the brainbow fluorophores. Brainbow control and KO mice were\nrandomly assigned to one of two groups for perfusion 4 (7-weeks-old) or 15\n(18-weeks-old) weeks after tamoxifen injection. Final experimental groups were\nas follows: 7-week-old group, 4 control and 5 KO; 18-week-old group, 5 control\nand 6 KO.\nBrainbow-expressing control and KO mice were anaesthetized with\npentobarbital (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and transcardially perfused through\nthe ascending aorta with ice-cold 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4)\ncontaining 1 U/ml heparin for 1 min at 6 ml/min, immediately followed by a\nsolution of 2.5% paraformaldehyde (PFA) with 4% sucrose in PBS for 10 min at\n25\u00b0C. Brains were removed and bisected along the sagittal plane into left\nand right hemispheres. The left hemisphere of each brain was post-fixed for 24\nhours and cryoprotected in 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose in PBS for 24, 24, and 48\nh, respectively. Left hemispheres were snap-frozen in 2-butyl methane chilled to\n\u221223\u00b0C with dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until\nsectioning. Left hemispheres were sectioned sagittally at a thickness of 60\n\u03bcm using a cryostat maintained at \u221220\u00b0C. Sections were\nthawed in PBS, slide mounted, air dried and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for\nimmunohistochemical tests. Right hemispheres were used to collect images for\nneuronal reconstructions for morphological analyses. Right hemispheres were\npost-fixed overnight and incubated in 10% sucrose in PBS for a minimum of 24\nhours; tissue was then cut into 1 mm coronal sections using a tissue slicer\n(Campden/Lafayette Instruments, IN). Sections were incubated for optical\nclearing in Sca\nl\neA2 for 3\u20134 weeks at 4\u00b0C (\nHama et al. 2015\n,\nSingh et al. 2015\n) and preserved in\nSca\nl\neA2 until imaging.\n\nNeuronal reconstructions of cells labeled in brainbow-expressing PTEN KO\nmice\nOne millimeter thick Sca\nl\neA2 cleared tissue sections\nwere imaged using a Nikon A1Rsi inverted microscope equipped with a 40X Plan Apo\nwater immersion objective (NA=1.15, field size 317 X 317 \u03bcm). Yellow\nfluorescent protein (YFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP) expressing cell\nclusters in brainbow positive mice (PTEN KO and control) were imaged. Consistent\nwith prior studies, cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) expressing nuclei were rare\nin CNS, and green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing cells were not evident\n(\nSingh et al. 2015\n). Three\ndimensional z-series confocal image stacks were collected through up to 500\n\u03bcm of the tissue at 1 \u03bcm increments to capture cells in their\nentirety. Between one and eight cells per animal were traced; except for one KO\nmouse in the 18-week group. In this animal, no brainbow-expressing PTEN KO cells\nwere found. Cells with proximal dendrites cut at the tissue surface, or with\ndendrites that could not be clearly visualized were excluded. In KO animals,\ncells were also excluded if their soma areas were within two standard deviations\nof the mean of soma areas for control cells. These cells likely reflect\nbrainbow-expressing, PTEN-expressing cells in KO animals resulting from\nincomplete cre-mediated recombination of the floxed PTEN gene. This criteria has\nbeen previously validated to distinguish >95% of KO cells from control\ncells (\nSantos et al. 2017\n). Cells meeting\nreconstruction criteria were randomly selected for analysis.\nConfocal z-series image stacks were imported to Neurolucida for whole\ncell tracing. Reconstructions encoded soma area, apical and basal dendrite\nlength, and dendritic branch points. Image stacks were also used to encode the\nlocation of the hilar-granule cell body layer border, the granule cell body\nlayer-molecular layer border, and the location of the hippocampal fissure. The\nmolecular layer was further subdivided into inner (IML), middle (MML), and outer\n(OML) regions, with the inner region being the first 17% of the molecular layer\n(\nWest and Andersen 1980\n,\nDeller et al. 1999\n,\nvan Groen et al. 2003\n,\nSantos et al. 2011\n), and the middle and outer being\nan equal split of the remainder.\n\nHistology and immunohistochemistry\nFor the brainbow control and KO mice, sections at the same\nmedial-lateral coordinates (Lateral 1.56; (\nPaxinos and Franklin, 2004\n)) were co-immunostained for PTEN/NeuN in\norder to quantify the percentage of PTEN KO cells. The following antibodies were\nused: mouse anti- NeuN (Neuronal nuclei protein, 1:400, Millipore Cat# MAB377\nRRID:AB_2298772) and rabbit anti-PTEN antibodies (Phosphatase and tensin\nhomolog, 1:250, Cell Signaling Technology Cat# 9559 RRID:AB_390810). Secondary\nantibodies included goat anti-rabbit Alex Fluor 594 (Thermo Fisher Scientific\nCat# A11012 RRID: AB_10562717) and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo\nFisher Scientific Cat# A-21242 RRID: AB_2535811), all at 1:750 dilution.\nSections were dehydrated in serial alcohol washes, xylene cleared for 15\nminutes, and hard mounted with Krystalon mounting medium (EMD Millipore, Cat#\n64969).\n\nPTEN KO cell counts\nPTEN/NeuN immunostained sections were imaged with a Leica SP5 inverted\nmicroscope (software RRID: SCR_013673) equipped with 63X oil objective (NA=1.4,\nfield size 248 X 248 \u03bcm). Confocal z-series image stacks were collected\nthrough 7 \u03bcm of tissue at a 1 \u03bcm step, excluding the top\n1\u20132 \u03bcm of tissue to avoid sectioning artifacts. A tile scan was\nused to capture the entire dentate gyrus in brain hemi sections, and images were\nimported to Neurolucida software (Microbrightfield Inc., RRID: SCR_001775) to\nstitch tiles together for dentate gyrus reconstruction. Two 100 X 100 \u03bcm\ncounting frames were placed over the midpoints of the upper and lower blades of\nthe dentate gyrus, respectively. The total number of NeuN positive cells, and\nthe number of NeuN positive, PTEN negative (PTEN KO) cells within these frames\nwas determined. Counts were conducted using a modified optical dissector\napproach, with the top and left sides of the box set as exclusion zones. Using\nthis methodology, cell bodies cropped at the surface or left sides of the\ncounting frame were excluded. Exclusion zones were not needed for the top/bottom\nof the counting frame, as the natural borders of the dentate at the molecular\nlayer and hilus were contained within the frame. All counts were completed by a\nreviewer blinded to treatment conditions. The percentage of KO cells was\ndetermined using the following equation: [total number of NeuN positive, PTEN\nnegative [KO] cells divided by the total number of NeuN positive cells] X\n100.\n\nBiocytin-labeling of PTEN KO granule cells\nIn addition to the use of triple-transgenic brainbow-expressing mice,\nbiocytin-filled cells from male and female double-transgenic\nGli1-CreER\nT2\nhemizygous;\nPTEN\nflox/flox\nmice were also used to assess cell structure.\nBiocytin-filled cells were selected from a previously-generated database of\nmorphologically reconstructed granule cells. Physiological and morphological\ndata from a subset of these cells is presented as part of another study (\nSantos et al. 2017\n). For the present study,\nall cells in the database meeting study inclusion criteria (animal genotype,\ncell genotype, tamoxifen protocol) and with complete data sets (morphological\nparameters collected and %KO determined) were included.\nDouble-transgenic mice were injected with 250 mg/kg tamoxifen on either\nP21 (n=13 male, 1 female) \u2013 identical to brainbow-expressing animals\n\u2013 or P14 (n=22 male, 6 female). Injecting the tamoxifen at an earlier age\nincreases the number of PTEN KO cells in the animals and is associated with the\ndevelopment of epilepsy (\nPun et al.,\n2012\n). For morphological measures of biocytin-filled PTEN KO granule\ncells, a range of 1\u20133 cells/mouse was analyzed for a total of 57\ncells.\nCells were labeled with biocytin in acute hippocampal slices, which were\nprepared as previously described (\nLaSarge et al.\n2015\n). All cells were injected with 0.2% biocytin using a\n\u201cblind\u201d approach with a patch clamp electrode (\nPinault 1996\n). Patching was conducted using an\nEclipse FN1 Nikon upright microscope equipped with 10X (NA=0.25) and 40X\n(NA=0.8) objectives. Brightfield optics were used to place the electrode tip\njust above the inner 1/3 of the dentate granule cell body layer, where the\nmajority of PTEN KO cells are found. After this point, the microscope optics\nwere no longer used and patching was conducted blindly by lowering the electrode\ninto the cell body layer. The first cell for which a stable membrane seal was\nobtained was filled. After cell labeling, slices were put into fixative (2.5%\nparaformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in PBS) and left overnight. The next day, slices\nwere rinsed in PBS for 15 minutes, exposed to 0.5% Igepal in PBS for one hour,\nfollowed by a 2 hour incubation in 1:300 streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate\n(Molecular Probes Cat# S32354 also S32354 RRID:AB_2315383) at room temperature.\nSlices were cover-slipped with ProLong Gold Antifade mounting media (Molecular\nProbes, Life Technologies, Cat#\nP10144\n). Slices were left to cure overnight and\nthen stored at 4\u00b0C until imaging. The left half of the brain from these\nanimals was immersion fixed overnight (2.5% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in\nPBS), and this tissue was prepared for histological studies in the same manner\nas the brainbow tissue.\n\nNeuronal reconstruction of biocytin-filled cells in double-transgenic PTEN KO\nmice\nCells were imaged using a Nikon A1Rsi inverted microscope equipped with\na 40X Plan Apo water immersion objective (NA=1.15, field size 317 X 317\n\u03bcm). Three-dimensional confocal image stacks were captured through the\nz-depth of the tissue at 0.5 \u03bcm increments to reveal cells in their\nentirety. Multiple image stacks were required to fully capture neurons in the\nx-y dimensions, so overlapping image stacks were three-dimensionally montaged\ninto a single image for reconstruction using Neurolucida software.\nReconstructions were conducted as described for cells expressing brainbow\nfluorophores. Even though patch electrodes were targeted to the inner third of\nthe granule cell body layer \u2013 where most KO cells were located \u2013\nthe blind patch approach still yielded both PTEN KO and PTEN-expressing cells.\nCells were identified as PTEN KOs only after reconstruction, therefore, using\nthe same criteria that was applied to brainbow-expressing cells (soma area\nexceeds two standard deviations of the control cell mean;\nSantos et al., 2017\n). For the present study, 49.8% of\nall cells filled met criteria for KO cells. Only data from KO cells is presented\nin the current study.\nIn order to obtain the percentage of PTEN KO cells in mice used for\nbiocytin-fills, PTEN immunohistochemistry was performed (as described for\nbrainbow mice), but sections were costained with NeuroTrace 640/660 Deep-Red\nFluorescent Nissl stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#\nN21483\n:AB_2572212) at a\ndilution of 1:300 instead of NeuN labeling. An identical quantification approach\nto that described for brainbow mice was used. Both Nissl- and NeuNbased counting\napproaches were found to be equally effective (\nSantos et al. 2017\n).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll data collection and analyses were conducted by investigators blind\nto animal age and genotype. Cell counts and neuronal reconstructions were\ngenerated by a first investigator, and then reviewed by a second to achieve\nconsensus. Statistical tests were performed using Sigma Plot software (version\n14.0, Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, RRID: SCR_003210). Group differences\namong brainbow mice were assessed by two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test for data\nthat met assumptions of normality and equal variance or by Mann-Whitney rank sum\ntest for data that violated either assumption. For these analyses, four\ncomparisons were made: genotype within age and age within genotype. The\nthreshold for significance was adjusted for multiple comparisons using\nBonferroni corrections (0.05/4=0.0125). Specific tests used are noted in the\nresults. Group differences among biocytin-filled cells were assessed using\nmultiple linear regression with animal age and the percentage of KO cells as\nindependent variables. Values from male and female mice were found to be\nstatistically indistinguishable and were binned for analysis (\nSantos et al., 2017\nand data not shown). P-values\nless than 0.05 were accepted as significant. Values are presented as\nmeans\u00b1 SEM or medians [25\nth\n-75\nth\npercentiles]\nunless otherwise noted.\n\nFigure preparation\nConfocal\nz\n-series image stacks acquired on the Nikon\nplatform were converted from 12 bit to 8 bit RGB.tiff files using NIS-Elements\nsoftware (version 4.500.00, Nikon). Figures were prepared using Sigma Plot\nsoftware and Adobe Photoshop CS5 (version 12.0, Adobe Photoshop). Images of\ngranule cells in figures 4, 6 and 7 are\nneuronal reconstructions (\nWalter et al.,\n2007\n;\nMurphy et al., 2011\n)"

    "Methods": "Animals.\nC57BL/6J inbred mice, 4-weeks old and male, were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All experiments involving animals, along with their care, were reviewed and approved by the University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol #15\u201308004) and were conducted in accordance with guidelines prepared by the Committee on Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Institute of Laboratory Animals Resources, National Research Council. Also, all animal studies complied with the ARRIVE guidelines. All efforts were made to minimize suffering and mice were euthanized through an overdose of isoflurane.\n\nTMEV infection.\nOn Day 0, animals were infected as previously described (\nLibbey et al., 2011b\n). Briefly, 5- to 6-week old C57BL/6J mice were anesthetized with isoflurane by inhalation and infected i.c. with either 4 \u00d7 10\n4\nplaque forming units (PFUs) of the DA strain of TMEV, or mock infected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The DA strain of TMEV was propagated as previously described (\nZurbriggen and Fujinami, 1989\n).\n\nWestern blot.\nBrains were obtained from TMEV-infected and mock-infected (PBS-injected) mice for 1\u20132 DPI, and for 3\u201314 DPI time points brains were obtained from mock-infected and TMEV-infected mice displaying seizures. Hippocampi were dissected, weighed, and then homogenize on ice in Syn-PER reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). In order to obtain a synaptosomal fraction, the homogenized samples were centrifuged at 1200 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes. The supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 15,000 \u00d7 g for 20 minutes. The supernatants were discarded and the final pellets were resuspended in 100 \u03bcL Syn-PER reagent. Gel electrophoresis of the synaptosomal samples was performed using Criterion TGX 4\u201315% precast polyacrylamide gels (BioRad, Hercules, CA), and transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose was carried out using a semi-dry transfer system (BioRad). Nitrocellulose membranes were then stained using anti-mGluR5 (ABCAM, Cambridge, MA) and anti-\u03b2 actin (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO), and secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) were used to identify protein bands with chemiluminescence reagents. Analyses of western blots were performed using ImageJ software, normalizing all samples to \u03b2-actin as a loading control. Samples were eliminated if there were clear and visible artifacts, loading, or transfer errors.\n\nImmunofluorescence.\nFor immunofluorescence imaging, whole brains were collected from mice displaying seizures and control mice. Brains were frozen in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (VWR, Radnor, PA) and 8 \u03bcm slices were obtained. Slices were stained with anti-mGluR5 primary antibodies (ABCAM) and visualized using Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (ABCAM). Images were obtained using a confocal laser scanning microscope at the Fluorescence Microscopy Core Facility, a part of the Health Sciences Cores at the University of Utah. Images for analysis were obtained using 40\u00d7 z-stack images taken in the CA1, CA3, and dentate regions of the hippocampus, along with cortex as an internal control. All images were taken on the left side of the tissue, contralateral to the injection site to avoid injection artifacts. All images underwent a background subtraction, and mGluR5 was quantified by multiplying the area of positive pixels by the average pixel intensity (IntDen). Representative mosaic images were constructed by stitching together 20\u00d7 images of the hippocampus from representative slides.\n\nDrug treatment.\nFor experiments investigating positive allosteric modulation of mGluR5, we used the drug VU0360172 (Tocris, Minneapolis, MN) suspended in PBS with 10% Tween-80, as per previous reports (\nLoane et al., 2014\n;\nZhang et al., 2015\n). TMEV-infected mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with either 50 mg/kg VU0360172 (N=18\u201320 mice per group) or vehicle (N=19\u201320 mice per group), all in 200 \u03bcL, at 6 hours, 1, 2, and 3 DPI and mice were observed for behavioral seizures up to 10 DPI. Long term drug treatment included the same initial injection schedule and continued daily through 8 DPI. To block mGluR5 signaling, 3-((2-Methyl-4-thiazolyl)ethynyl)pyridine (MTEP) (Tocris) was solubilized in PBS and administered to mice at 10 mg/kg at 6 hours, 1, 2, and 3 DPI (N=24 mice); control mice were injected with 200 \u03bcL PBS as vehicle (N=25 mice).\n\nFlow cytometry and direct intracellular cytokine staining (ICS).\nDirect ICS was performed as previously described (\nCusick et al., 2013\n;\nLiu and Whitton, 2005\n). Briefly, animals were retro-orbitally injected with 250 \u03bcg Brefeldin A (SigmaAldrich), an inhibitor of protein transport, 6 hours before being sacrificed. Brains were immediately collected and processed on ice. Extracellular staining was carried out using anti-CD45-V500 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and anti-CD11b-BV421 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) in order to distinguish microglial (CD45\nlow/int\nCD11b\n+\n), macrophage (CD45\nhi\nCD11b\n+\n), and lymphocyte (CD45\nhi\nCD11b\n\u2212\n) cell types. Cells were then treated with cytoperm/cytofix (BD Biosciences) and stained with anti-TNF-\u03b1-Pe-Cy7 (BioLegend) and anti-IL-6-PE (eBioscience). Gating for all flow cytometry experiments was determined by Fluorescence-minus-one (FMO) for CD45, CD11b, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 antibodies.\n\nSeizure scoring.\nSeizure monitoring and scoring was performed as previously described (\nLibbey et al., 2011b\n). Briefly, mice were observed for 2 hours a day and graded using the Racine scale: stage 1, mouth and facial disturbances; stage 2, head nodding; stage 3, forelimb clonus; stage 4, rearing; stage 5, rearing and falling (\nRacine, 1972\n;\nCusick et al., 2013\n). The percentage of mice with seizures was calculated as follows: (number of mice with seizures/total number of mice infected) \u00d7 100. Average cumulative seizure burden was determined by totaling the daily Racine scores for each mouse and then, using these totals, an average score for each experimental group was calculated.\n\nImmunohistochemistry.\nMice were euthanized and perfused with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Brains were harvested, divided into 5 coronal slabs, embedded in paraffin and cut into 4 \u03bcm thick tissue sections. Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (\nKirkman et al., 2010\n;\nTsunoda et al., 2001\n). DA viral antigen positive cells were detected on paraffin embedded sections using anti-TMEV antibodies and secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Slides were then developed using the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex technique with 3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (SigmaAldrich) in 0.01% hydrogen peroxide (SigmaAldrich) in PBS. Quantification of DA viral antigen positive cells was performed in a blinded fashion with a light microscope using one slide per brain and evaluating tissue sections from all five coronal slabs represented per slide (5 animals per group). The following brain regions were observed during the quantification process: frontal lobe, septum, caudoputamen, hippocampus, thalamus, midbrain, cortex, and cerebellum.\n\nStatistical analysis.\nPrism v.7 (Graphpad software, La Jolla, CA) was used for statistical analysis and the creation of all graphs. The significance of the percent of mice having seizures per day was determined using a Fisher\u2019s exact test. Western blot optical density, immunofluorescence, daily average clinical score, and seizure burden were analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U test. Area under the curve analysis was also performed on daily average clinical score data and the significance between curve areas was determined by a Student\u2019s T-test. Outliers were identified by a Grubb\u2019s test. Results with p<0.05 were considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Study Design and Animal Groups\nAnimals were housed in the Augusta University Division of Laboratory Animal Services facility. This facility is approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. Protocols regarding animal care and treatment were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. In addition to university procedures, this study also followed the National Institute of Health guidelines for care and use of animals in research. Any behavioral testing and data analyses occurred in a blinded manner.\nWistar rats (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN) were maintained at a constant 12 hr light/dark cycle and access to food and water ad libitum. The type 2 diabetic model used was induced by a 45% high fat diet (HFD, Research Diet Inc, New Brunswick, NJ) beginning at 4 weeks of age, followed by single low-dose injection of streptozotocin (STZ; 30mg/kg) at 6 weeks of age. Control animals were fed regular chow. Body weight and blood glucose measurements occurred twice weekly until surgery at 12-13 weeks of age. Diabetes was characterized by increased blood glucose levels, insulin resistance and/or insulin deficiency, dyslipidemia including increased adiposity, plasma free fatty acids, triglyceride and cholesterol levels. In the postoperative period (first 5 days), blood glucose was monitored daily. Confirmation of elevated blood levels was based on blood glucose measurements and hemoglobin (Hb) A1c measurement with the Bayer A1cNow system (Fisher Scientific). Three sets of experiments were conducted:\nExperiment 1:\nControl and diabetic male rats were subjected to sham or 90-minute mechanical middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery and followed for 14 days (n=5 for sham and n=9 for stroke groups). Three animals in the diabetic stroke and one animal in the control stroke group died before Day 3 and were not included in the results (n=6 diabetic stroke group, and n=8 control stroke group). A battery of sensorimotor and cognitive/memory tests were performed at Days 1, 3, 7 and 14 as described below. Additional metabolic parameters were measured using the following kits: Free Fatty Acids (FFA) HR Series NEFA-HR kits from Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan), Infinity Triglycerides and Cholesterol kits from Thermo Scientific (Middletown, VA), and Rat Insulin ELISA from Millipore (Billerica, MA).\nExperiment 2:\nControl and diabetic male and female rats were subjected to 60-min MCAO and followed for 14 days (n=8) for outcomes. In this experiment, one animal died in the male control stroke group and six animals (3 female and 3 male) died in the diabetic stroke group within 36 hrs after ischemia. The animals that died before Day 14 were not included in analyses. As a result, final animal numbers are: n=8 in female control, n=7 in male control, n=5 in female diabetic, and n=5 in male diabetic groups.\nIn these sets of experiments, after 14-day behavioral tests, animals were injected with fluorescein isothiocyanate- dextran (FITC; MW: 2,000,000; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to visualize the vasculature as described below.\nExperiment 3:\nControl and diabetic male and female rats were subjected to 60-min MCAO (n=8) and followed for 3 days for sensorimotor deficits. Four animals (2 female and 2 male) died in the diabetic group within 24 hrs of surgery so they were not included in this study (final numbers are n=8 female control, n=8 male control, n=6 female diabetic, n=6 male diabetic). Female rats underwent surgery during the diestrus phase after careful monitoring of the estrus cycle by vaginal swab.\n\nStroke Surgery\nFocal cerebral ischemia was induced by MCAO surgery as described previously (\nLi et al., 2017\n). In all surgeries, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane using 5% at induction and 2% at maintenance in the mixture of N\n2\nand O\n2\n. A nylon suture was inserted through the external carotid artery to occlude the MCA for 60 or 90 min followed by reperfusion. Laser Doppler imaging system (Perimed, North Royalton, OH) was used to confirm occlusion and reperfusion before and after the suture was removed.\n\nBehavioral Tests\nSensorimotor tests including Bederson score, beam walk, grip strength, adhesive removal test (ART), and cognitive/memory test with Novel Object Recognition (NOR) were performed on Days 1, 3, 7, and 14 in a blinded manner. Animals were trained 5-7 days prior to surgery and the baseline was taken on the final day.\nBederson score involved four parameters including: ipsilateral circling (score 2 \u2013 no circling, 1 \u2013 partial circling, 0 \u2013 continuous circling), contralateral hindlimb and forelimb retraction which measuring the ability of the animal to replace its displaced limb in an appropriate manner (score 2 \u2013 immediate replacement, 1 \u2013 replacement after minutes, 0 \u2013 no replacement), and resistance to push (score 1 or 0, depending on whether the animal exhibited any resistant to push at all). A maximum score of 7 was deemed a normal, healthy animal. Beam-walk abilities were graded based on a 7-point scale method described by Feeney (\nFeeney et al., 1982\n). The entire composite score involved the sum of the Bederson score and beam-walking score, which led to a 0-14 point scale.\nGrip strength was measured with a standard grip strength meter (Columbus Instrument, Columbus, OH). The rat is gently held with their forepaws grasping the mesh under tension, attached the grip strength meter and then pulled back consistently with its tail. The digital recording obtained from 3 trials is averaged and recorded as one observation (\nPrakash et al., 2013b\n).\nART was performed as previously described (\nLi et al., 2017\n). Removal latency of the adhesive paper dot was recorded on each of the testing days following stroke with three trials that were averaged. The maximum removal latency was 180 seconds per trial.\nIn order to assess cognitive deficits, we used the NOR test (\nHardigan et al., 2017\n;\nPrakash et al., 2013b\n). Animals were habituated to test apparatus in a grey plastic box (63L \u00d7 38W \u00d7 42H cm) that was layered with animal bedding for 4 days prior to baseline testing for 10 min. Objects with greater intricacy and details and similar in appearances with equal and unbiased preferences for one over the other were chosen to perform the test. On the day of testing, the rats were allowed to explore two identical objects during the A/A session for a period of 5 minutes. The rats were returned to their home cages for a delay/retention interval of 15 minutes following which the rats were confronted to A/B sessions in the consisting of 5 minutes, during which a novel object was paired with a familiar object used in the A/A session. These activities were recorded and a recognition index was determined by the amount of time the animal spent with the new object compared to the familiar object. All objects were cleaned after each session with 30% ethanol and the bedding was ruffled and cleaned to discard cues.\n\nAssessment of Cerebral Vascularization (Experiments 1 and 2)\nTo visualize cerebral vessels, rats were injected with 500 \u03bcL of 50 mg/mL FTC-dextran via the jugular vein under anesthesia using isoflurane. FTC perfused throughout the animal for 10 min. Prior to sacrifice, plasma was obtained for metabolic analysis. Brains were processed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24-48 hrs followed by 30% sucrose in PBS. Brains were sectioned using a cryostat and confocal images were obtained by the Zeiss 760 confocal microscope using 100 \u03bcm sections. Specifically, Z-stacked images were obtained from regions of interest in the cortex and striatum (bregma \u22121 to + 1), where we have previously found hemorrhage in diabetic animals. In order to reduce variability and confirm the findings, an overall representation was obtained using three individual images from the ipsilateral/contralateral cortical and striatal regions (\nFig 1 A\n). Only ipsilateral images were taken in the sham groups. The mean value from these three separate images was calculated and each animal had a total of nine unique images analyzed from the cerebrovasculature. The Z-stack referenced an image size of 1.984 \u03bcm, 512\u00d7512 pixels, and 20\u00d7 magnification. Raw images were then imported into Volocity 6.0 (Improvision, Lexington, MA) where they were 3D-reconstructed to determine the vascular volume and surface area. Vascular volume references the vascular volume ratio in comparison to total volume. Surface area represented the absolute surface area of the total vasculature. Branch density and tortuosity were determined using the open-source imaging software package FIJI. Confocal images were converted into 8-bit images and reduced to 1-pixel size to obtain a binary image. These binary images were then skeletonized to determine tortuosity. Images were not pruned in order to maintain the full degree of vessel tortuosity. The final determination of tortuosity was calculated as the ratio of longest (tracing of the distance between 2 points) and shortest (the Euclidean-straight line). FIJI was also used to determine branch density, which is the number of branch points found over the entire unit length of vessel.\nFigure 1. Effect of diabetes on cerebral vascularization in male animals with 90 min MCAO.\nOpen in a new tab\nA\nand\nB,\nRepresentative images of FITC-filled vasculature in the cortex of sham or stroked control and diabetes animals are shown. Three regions of interest in cortex (red) or striatum (blue) in section C of the coronal cross-sections, which covers the infarct area (light and heavy pink in the sagittal image) and the mirror images in the contralateral hemisphere, was randomly selected and analyzed. In sham animals, only ipsilateral hemisphere was imaged. While diabetes increases vascular volume (\nC\n) and surface area (\nD\n) at baseline, vascularization is decreased 14 days after ischemic injury in both hemispheres in diabetes only (\nC\nto\nE\n), while tortuosity (\nF\n) had no significant change. [*p<0.01 for interaction between disease (control vs. diabetes) and surgery (sham vs. stroke);\na\np<0.05 vs. control].\n\nEvaluation of Neurovascular Injury (Experiment 3)\nBrain slices (A to G, +6.7 mm to \u22128 mm of bregma) were imaged for analysis of macroscopic bleeding (HT Index) and then stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) in order to determine infarct size and edema measurements. Infarct size was determined by calculating the ischemic size percentage versus the non-ischemic side. After this imaging took place, the brain sections were homogenized in order to determine hemoglobin quantification with QuantiChrom kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA). Excess hemoglobin (Hb, \u03bcg/mg protein) was determined by subtracting sham Hb values from the ischemic hemisphere readings. HT index was scored in brain slices B through E and used a five point rubric system: 1 \u2013 Dispersed individual petechiae; 2 \u2013 Confluent petechiae; 3 \u2013 Small diffuse hemorrhage or hematoma; 4 \u2013 Large diffuse hemorrhage or hematoma. The total score for each animal was reported and this led their overall HT index score. All endpoints for neurovascular injury were measured in a blinded manner.\n\nData Analysis\nThe results were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 7 and expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Vascularization data in Experiment 1 was analyzed by a two-way ANOVA for (Control vs. Diabetes) and (Sham vs. Stroke). Data in Experiments 2 and 3 were analyzed by a two-way ANOVA for (Control vs. Diabetes) and (Females vs. Males) comparisons. Behavioral recovery over 14 days was analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. A Bonferroni adjustment was used for multiple posthoc comparisons. Significance detected by ANOVA and posthoc analyses were indicated by symbols and letters, respectively."

    "Methods": "This study was conducted after approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Alpert Medical School of Brown University and Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island and in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the use of experimental animals.\n\nAnimal preparation, study groups, and experimental study design\nThe subjects were neonatal rats born to time-mated dams (Charles River Laboratories; Wilmington, MA) in the Animal Care Facility at Brown University. Pregnant Wistar rats on embryonic day 15 (E15) or E16 were shipped and then housed in a 12-hour light/dark cycled facility with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water in the Animal Care Facility at Brown University. After the delivery date was confirmed for each pregnant dam, the date upon which the rat pups were born was designated as postnatal day 0 (P0). Pups from different litters born on the same day were then culled and balanced with regard to sex differences so that each dam had no more than 10 pups. On P7, the pups were randomly assigned to sham operated control, sham operated hypoxia alone, and HI exposed groups. HI was induced in the pups by carotid artery ligation on the right side along with exposure to 8% oxygen for 2 hours using previously described methods. (\nRice, et al., 1981\n)\nAnesthesia was induced in the pups with 3-4% isoflurane and maintained with 1-2% isoflurane during the procedure. Body temperature was maintained at 36\u00b0C during surgery with an isothermal heating pad. A skin incision was made at the midline of the neck overlying the trachea using sterile surgical scissors. The right common carotid artery (RCCA) was separated from the trachea and the surrounding nerves and double ligated using 5-0 silk sutures. The incision was closed and sterilized with betadine and alcohol. Sham treated subjects were exposed to the same procedure except the RCCA was not ligated. The pups were sutured and labeled with neonatal tattooing system (Neo-9, Animal Identification & Marking Systems, Inc., Hornell, NY, USA). The pups were returned to their dams for 1.5\u20133 h for feeding and recovery from surgery. They were then placed in a hypoxia chamber with 8% humidified oxygen and balanced nitrogen for 2 hours with a constant temperature of 36\u00b0C. Sham control subjects were exposed to room air for 2 hours. The sham treated subjects that were exposed to 8% oxygen for 2 hours are hereafter designated as the hypoxia alone group. The rats in each study group were spread among different litters to account for the potential inter-litter variability. (\nRice, et al., 1981\n) Animals in the HI or hypoxia alone groups were sacrificed at various time points after exposure to HI or hypoxia.\n\nBrain collection and immunohistochemical staining\nBrains were obtained from the neonatal rat pups that were exposed to carotid artery ligation and hypoxia (HI), or sham treatment with and without hypoxia. Brains were collected, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned for immunostaining from the sham operated control (n=25) and from neonatal rats at zero (n=8), 3 (n=8), 6 (n=7), 12 (n=14), 24 (n=15), and 48 h (n=14) after exposure to HI. Brains were also collected and similarly treated for immunostaining from the sham operated control group (n=9) and from neonatal rats at zero (n=9), 3 (n=9), 12 (n=8), 48 h (n=9) after exposure to hypoxia alone. For the purpose of this report, zero, 3, and 6 h were considered as the early phases of recovery from HI or hypoxia alone, and 24 and 48 h were considered as the later phases of recovery from HI or hypoxia alone.\nThe pups were first sedated with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (74 mg/kg) and xylazine (4 mg/kg). The injection was followed by a quick pinch on the hind leg of the animal to ensure adequate sedation. Blood samples were collected from the left ventricle, and brains were perfused with cold saline and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Brains were removed and post fixed in PFA for 24 h. The paraffin-embedded brain tissues were sectioned in coronal planes at 6 microns thicknesses. One coronal section containing the dorsal hippocampus per brain (bregma \u22123.12 \u00b1 0.6mm) was utilized to standardize the immunohistochemical analyses (\nPaxinos and Watson, 2017\n) using previously reported methodologies (\nZhang, et al., 2016\n,\nZhang, et al., 2011\n). Briefly, the sections were processed in an antigen retrieval buffer of 0.1 M sodium citrate and heated in an autoclave at 120\u00b0C for 10 minutes, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 5% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) in tris-buffered saline (TBS). The sections were then incubated overnight with a primary antibody solution with mouse anti-HMGB1 monoclonal antibody (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) at a dilution of 1:500 in combination with either a rabbit anti-NeuN polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) at a dilution of 1:1000, or rabbit anti-Iba-1 monoclonal antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) at a dilution of 1:1000, or a rabbit anti-GFAP polyclonal antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) at a dilution of 1:1000. Rabbit anti-LC3II polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) was used at a dilution of 1:1000 to detect autophagy. The secondary antibodies were Alexa-555 labeled anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Alexa-488 labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) both at a dilution of 1:1000. Coverslips were applied to the slides with anti-fading mounting reagent and DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Stained slides were visualized under a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 imaging system microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Jena, Germany) connected with computer software Stereo Investigator 10.0 (MicroBrightField, Inc., Williston, VT, USA) for image analysis.\n\nHMGB1 translocation and release\nThe slides from animals studied were randomly chosen from each study group (n=4 for each group except n=3~4 for the 48-h group) to visualize or quantify HMGB1 translocation and release. The slides were coded and labeled by an independent third party to ensure that the slides were evaluated without knowledge of the treatment protocol or study group. Image acquisition and quantification were carried out according to previous publications with modifications as follows (\nGross, et al., 2016\n,\nMalaeb, et al., 2009\n,\nOrtiz-Lopez, et al., 2017\n). Briefly, separate images with a 400 x magnification of HMGB1 staining (cy3), NeuN, GFAP, or Iba-1 staining (FITC), and DAPI filters were obtained from five random fields per slide from the cerebral cortex of the neonatal rats exposed to HI or hypoxia alone. The number of immunoreactive cells was manually quantified with the count tool in Adobe Photoshop CC (Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA). Double-fluorescent labeling for HMBG1 and NeuN (neuronal marker), GFAP (astrocytic marker), and Iba-1 (microglial marker) were obtained to quantify the number of positive stained cells. HMGB1 translocation from the nuclear compartment to the cytosol and release from the cell were defined as follows. The cells with HMGB1-positive staining within only nuclear compartment were considered HMGB1 positive in nucleus (nuclear HMGB1-positive staining). Reductions or absence of HMGB1 staining within the nuclear compartment along with positive HMGB1 staining within the cytosolic compartment was considered HMGB1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytosolic compartment (cytoplasmic HMGB1-positive staining), whereas, the absence of nuclear HMGB1 staining and presence of HMGB1 outside of the cells in the extracellular matrix or extracellular space was considered release from the cell (negative HMGB1 staining). The HMGB1 positive cells in nuclear and cytosol compartments and HMGB1 negative cells were calculated as a percentage to the total number of cells, which was determined by counting the DAPI positive nuclei using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The minimum size of particles was set to 4 \u03bcm\n2\nto avoid false positive staining of cell fragments (\nThrelkeld, et al., 2014\n).\n\nDouble-fluorescent labeling for in situ DNA fragmentation for apoptosis and HMGB1\nBrains for double-fluorescent labeling for\nin situ\nDNA fragmentation for apoptosis and HMGB1 staining were obtained from the sham operated control (n=6) and from neonatal rats at 48 h (n=6) after exposure to HI. The TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to detect of the apoptosis 48 h after exposure to HI. A subset of paraffin-embedded brain sections were used for the TUNEL assay with the ApopTag\u00ae fluorescein detection method using an\nin situ\napoptosis kit according to the protocols described by the manufacturer (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The coronal brain sections of the cerebral cortex were outlined as previously described (\nZhang, et al., 2016\n). The number of apoptotic cells in cerebral cortex was quantified without knowledge of the treatment group using the Fractionator probe of Stereo Investigator 10.0 software (MBF Bioscience). Sections of the cerebral cortex were traced under 100 x magnification. An automated stage paired with the Stereo Investigator was used to step systematically through the counting frames (Fractionator probe) (\nThrelkeld, et al., 2014\n). Cells that were ApopTag\u00ae positive and did not exhibit HMGB1 staining were considered to be cells undergoing apoptosis that had been depleted of HMGB1 or were HMGB1 negative (ApopTag\n+\n/HMGB1\n\u2212\n). Cells that were ApopTag\u00ae negative and HMGB1 negative were considered to be cells that were not undergoing apoptosis but were depleted of HMGB1 (ApopTag\n\u2212\n/HMGB1\n\u2212\n). The data were expressed as a percentage of counted cells (ApopTag\n+\n, ApopTag\n+\n/HMGB1\n\u2212\n, ApopTag\n\u2212\n/HMGB1\n\u2212\n) to the total number of cells counter-stained with DAPI.\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\nSerum for HMGB1 analysis by ELISA was obtained from the sham control rats and from neonatal rats at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after exposure to HI. Serum levels of HMGB1 were determined on whole blood samples that were collected from the left ventricle before the transcardial perfusion without using an anticoagulant reagent. Blood samples were centrifuged immediately at 2,300 g at room temperature. Clots were removed and the supernatant collected in a separate tube and placed on ice for 2 h. Any additional clots that formed were also removed and the supernatant was saved at \u221280\u00b0C freezer until analysis. Before analysis, the samples were centrifuged again and the supernatant was used for the ELISA assay. HMGB1 concentration was determined using an HMGB1 ELISA kit (Shino-Test, Tokyo, Japan) following the manufacture\u2019s protocol. (\nLiu, et al., 2007\n,\nZhang, et al., 2011\n)\n\nWestern immunoblot for analysis of HMGB1\nThe ipsilateral-HI cerebral cortical hemispheres for Western immunoblot analysis of HMGB1 were obtained from the sham operated control and from neonatal rats at 3, 12 and 48 h after exposure to HI. Rat brains for protein analyses were perfused with 0.9% NaCl without PFA fixative. Brain homogenates were prepared in T-PER (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) buffer extraction reagent with a cock-tail proteinase inhibitor (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Equal amounts of 10 \u03bcg of protein per well were fractionated for the Western immunoblots using the ready-to-use 4-12% BIS TRIS SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, proteins on the gel were transferred onto polyvinylidene diflouride (PVDF) membrane (PVDF, 0.2 micron, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using a semi-dry transfer technique. Membranes were blocked with 10% skim milk (Bio-Rad) prepared in TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 solution (TBST), and washed three times in TBST. The membrane was probed overnight with peroxidase conjugated rat anti-HMGB1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) at 4\u00b0C (\nZhang, et al., 2011\n). This antibody detects a band of HMGB1 approximately 28 kDa (predicted molecular weight: 25 kDa) in adult rat brain tissue. Membranes were washed on the following day four times with TBST and incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) before exposure to autoradiography film (Daigger, Vernon Hills, IL, USA). \u03b2-Actin was probed with a mouse \u03b2-Actin antibody (1:10000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Dallas, TX, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0C to serve as the loading control, and a HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (ThermoFisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to visualize the immunoblots.\nAll experimental samples were normalized to a protein extract obtained from a homogenate pool from the cerebral cortex of a single adult rat brain. As we have previously described, these protein samples served as internal control samples (\nSadowska, et al., 2010\n). The use of the internal control standard allows accurate quantification among different groups and Western immunoblots. The optical densities of total HMGB1 were expressed as a ratio to the internal control values thus facilitating normalized comparisons among different experimental groups and immunoblots.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical significance was evaluated using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc comparisons using the Fisher least significance difference (LSD) test. Two-way ANOVA was also used to compare differences in HMGB1 cytoplasmic translocation in cerebral cortical cells for the different time periods between HI- and hypoxia alone-treated groups. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Differences with a probability value of <0.05 were considered to be significant."

Generation of new transgenic strains\nFull length human \u03b1-synuclein cDNA (417 bp) lacking start and stop codons was PCR amplified using\nC. elegans\ngenomic DNA isolated from\nPdat-1::\u03b1-synuclein[wild-type]\nworms (\nKuwahara et al., 2006\n). Primers included attB1 and attB2 sites, allowing for \u03b1-synuclein cDNA to undergo BP recombination into pDONR221 to form \u03b1-syn [2,1]; this construct was sequence verified and saved as pJVR015. Multi-site Gateway recombination was subsequently used to generate P\neft-3\n::a-syn::tagRFP::let-858 UTR in the MosSCI pDEST backbone (pCFJ150, which contains the\nunc-119\nrescue construct) to generate pJVR017. The start codon is contained in the 581bp\neft-3\n[4,1] promoter clone obtained through the\nC. elegans\npromoterome (GE Dharmacon), and the stop codon follows the in-frame RFP in the 3\u2019 element pGH107 (tagRFP+let-858 UTR). The final strain (\njerls004\n, JVR339) was constructed by injecting EG4322 (\nttTi5605 II; unc-119(ed9\n) III) worms with pJVR017 (Peft-\n3\n::\u03b1-syn::tagRFP::let-858, unc-119(+)) at 25 ng/ul, with pCJF601 (50 ng/ul), pMA122 (10ng/ul), and markers including F25B3.3::GFP (5 ng/ul), lin-26::GFP (5 ng/ul), elt-7::GFP (5ng/ul) and direct Mos-mediated integration as previously described (\nFrokjaer-Jensen et al., 2008\n).\nThe control strain was constructed similarly, using multisite Gateway to combine pEft-3 [2,1], tagRFP+stop [2,1] (bsem1163) and pADA126(let-858 UTR [2,3]) into pCFJ150 to generate pJVR029. The construct was injected at 25 ng/ul, with appropriate co-injection constructs and integrated as above to generate jerIs015 (JVR344). All strains were outcrossed at least 4 times. At least 3 independent lines were generated per construct.\nSingle copy integration was confirmed using protocols developed by the Nonet lab (\nhttp://thalamus.wustl.edu/nonetlab/ResourcesF/Resources.html\n). Five plates of age synchronized worms were collected at day 1 of adulthood and washed 3x in M9 buffer. Samples were then frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Genomic DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Samples were then diluted to 20 ng/\u03bcL and 100 ng of DNA was loaded into each PCR reaction and run using a long amplification PCR buffer and TAQ DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs MO323S). Primers targeted the flanking arms of the Mos1 site (NM3887 5'\nACCGGAAACCAAAGGACGAGAG\nand NM3888 5'\nACGCCCAGGAGAACACGTTAG\n) allowing the length of the inserted \u03b1-synuclein::RFP transgene to be determined. Genomic DNA isolated from the transgenic strain was compared to the pJVR017 plasmid used in the construction of the transgenic animals and the pCFJ150 backbone without an insert were also amplified for comparison using this protocol. The thermocycler conditions were set using a long amplification protocol: 30 seconds at 95\u00b0C, 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 10 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 50 seconds, 65\u00b0C for 12 minutes +10 second per cycle, 65\u00b0C for 10 minutes.\n\n2.3. Lifespan\nLifespan was determined on nematode growth media (NGM) agar plates with 25 \u03bcM 5-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (FUdR) in order to reduce the development of progeny. While high concentrations of FUdR have been shown to impact longevity in specific strains, in our experience these differences, if any, are minimized by using 25 \u03bcM (\nVan Raamsdonk and Hekimi, 2011\n). Since this concentration of FUdR does not completely prevent the development of progeny to adulthood in the first generation, animals were transferred to fresh agar plates after 3 days. After the initial transfer, worms were moved to fresh plates weekly. Animal survival was observed every 2 days by gentle prodding. Three replicates of 30 animals each were completed.\n\n2.4. Defecation rate\nDefecation cycle length was measured by the length in time between consecutive pBoc contractions in day 1 adult worms. To reduce the impact of ambient laboratory temperature, defecation rate was quantified on 20 \u00b0C water filled chambers. Three replicates of 15 animals each were completed.\n\n2.5. Postembryonic development time\nPost-embryonic development (PED) was assessed by moving eggs to agar plates. After 3 h, newly hatched L1 worms were transferred to a new plate. The hours from hatching to the young adult transition was measured as the PED time. Three replicates of 30 animals each were completed.\n\n2.6. Fertility\nBrood size was determined by placing individual young adult staged animals onto agar plates with daily transfers to new plates until progeny production ceased. The resulting progeny was allowed to develop to adulthood before quantification. Three replicates of 10 animals each were completed.\n\n2.7. Thrashing behavior\nThe thrashing rate was determined using video-tracking and computer analysis (\nCooper et al., 2015\n). Videos were taken with an Allied Vision Tech Stingray F-145 B Firewire Camera (Allied Vision, Exton, PA, USA) using the MATLAB image acquisition toolbox. Analysis was performed using wrMTrck plugin for ImageJ (available at\nhttp://www.phage.dk/plugins\n). Three replicates of 50 animals each were completed.\n\n2.8. Stress resistance assays: Heat stress, Oxidative stress, Osmotic stress\nStress resistance assays were performed as we have described previously (\nDues et al., 2016\n). Heat stress sensitivity was assessed on the first day of adulthood at 37 \u00b0C. Sensitivity to chronic oxidative stress was determined through exposure to plates containing paraquat (Methyl viologen, Sigma) starting at day 1 of adulthood (\nDues et al., 2017\n). Sensitivity to osmotic stress was determined in day 1 adult worms by transferring to plates containing 500 mM NaCl and measuring survival after 24 hours. Three replicates of 30 animals each were completed.\n\n2.9. Basal slowing\nBasal slowing is a measurement of dopamine dependent behavior. Animals at day 1 of adulthood were washed in M9 buffer to clean animals of bacteria. These animals were then moved to either unseeded agar plates or agar plates seeded with OP50 bacteria covering the whole plate. After approximately 5 minutes, videos of the entire plate were recorded for 1 minute with an Allied Vision Tech Stingray F-504 B Firewire Camera and a Navitar Zoom 7000 lens (Navitar, Tokyo, Japan) using the MATLAB image acquisition tool. Recordings were then processed using the wrMTrck plugin for ImageJ. Basal slowing was calculated as the difference in rate of movement on food versus off food divided by the rate of movement off food.\nCrawling speed was determined from data collected from the unseeded off-food agar plate. Three replicates of 50 animals each were completed.\n\n2.10. Degeneration of dopamine neurons and dendritic blebbing\nDopamine neuron neurodegeneration and dendritic blebbing was determined using worms that express GFP only in dopamine neurons under the\ndat-1\ndopamine transporter promoter. Treatments that cause a loss of GFP-positive neurons cause a corresponding loss of dopamine neuron cell bodies (\nNass et al., 2002\n).\nPdat-1:GFP\nworms were aged on agar plates containing 25 \u03bcM FUdR to be observed at designated ages. At every time point, worms were mounted onto a 1% agar pad on a glass slide, paralyzed using 2 mM levamisole, and enclosed with a coverslip. Imaging of these animals was carried out with an Axioplan 2 inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). At each time point for the neurodegeneration assay remaining CEP, ADE, and PDE neurons were quantified. At each time point for the dendritic blebbing assay the total number of fluorescent blebs observed in the four rostral dopaminergic dendrites were quantified. Blebs, bead-shape protrusions from the neuronal processes, were defined as distortions of the dendrite structure with an area greater than approximately 5 \u03bcm\n2\n. Blebbing increases with age in several classes of neurons and correlates with the dysfunction of behaviors associated with those neurons (\nPan et al., 2011\n). Three replicates of 10 animals per time point were completed.\n\n2.11. Measurement of aggregation\nAnimals were mounted onto slides and imaged using a 63x objective on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 compound microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Punctae, defined as clusters of at least 3 pixels whose intensity were at least 1 standard deviation above the background intensity, were quantified using MATLAB. Three replicates of 10 animals each were completed.\n\n2.12. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR\nAge-synchronized pre-fertile young adult worms from a limited lay were collected and washed three times in M9 buffer. Excess buffer was removed and 150 \u03bcl of Trizol was added prior to freezing. mRNA was isolated as described previously (\nMachiela et al., 2016\n) and converted to cDNA using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Life Technologies). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using a Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a Bio-Rad iCycler Thermal Cycler.\n\n2.13. Western blotting\nWorms were picked from unseeded areas of NGM plates and collected into 10 \u03bcl of M9 buffer. Between 10 and 200 worms were utilized in an attempt to obtain comparable levels of \u03b1-synuclein based on the levels of \u03b1-synuclein mRNA. 3.5 \u03bcl of 6X Laemmli SDS Sample Buffer (GTX16357, GeneTex) and 1.5 \u03bcl 100 mM DTT were added to each sample. Samples were incubated at 95\u03b0C for 10 minutes in a BioRad T100 Thermal Cycler and then frozen until loading. Samples were boiled and loaded onto a 4-12% gel (Lonza). \u03b1-synuclein was detected using the H3C mouse anti-\u03b1-synuclein antibody (1:5000 dilution; Catalog#:h3c; RRID: AB_2618046) and anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:50,000 dilution) with enhanced chemiluminescence. Actin was detected using a mouse anti-actin antibody (JLA20, 1:5000 dilution).\n\n2.14. Imaging\nYoung adult hermaphrodites were loaded on 2% agarose pads. 0.1% levamisole was used to anesthetize the worms. Images were captured with an IX-70 microscope (Olympus) fitted with a cooled CCD camera (CH350; Roper Scientific) driven by the Delta Vision system (Applied Precision). Images were deconvolved using the SoftWorx 3.0 deconvolution software from Applied Precision.\n\n2.15. Statistical analysis\nExperiments were performed such that the experimenter was blinded to the genotype of the worms being assayed. Survival plots were compared using the log-rank test. For analyses involving multiple groups and time points, a one-way or two-way ANOVA was used to assess significance followed by Bonferroni post-hoc tests for detecting specific differences between groups."

    "Methods": "2.1. Ethics Statement\nAll described procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at USF and conducted in compliance with the\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n. All mice were housed in a temperature-controlled room (23\u00b0C) and maintained on a 12:12 h dark: light cycle (lights on at 06:00 AM). Food and water were available\nad libitum\n. Upon progression of neurological symptoms, a highly palatable liquid nutritional supplement was placed on the cage floor, ensuring access by the animal.\n\n2.2. Animals\nAll animals used in the study were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA. Seventy-four transgenic male B6SJL-Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J mice, over-expressing human SOD1 carrying the Gly93\u2192Ala mutation (G93A SOD1) at 7 weeks of age, were randomly assigned to one of four groups receiving different doses of hBM34\n+\ncells or media:\nGroup 1\n- hBM34+ (5\u00d710\n4\ncells/mouse, low dose, n=15),\nGroup 2\n- hBM34+ (5\u00d710\n5\ncells/mouse, mid dose, n=16),\nGroup 3\n- hBM34+ (1\u00d710\n6\ncells/mouse, high dose, n=23), and\nGroup 4\n- Media (n=20). At 8 weeks of age and then weekly, mouse body weight was monitored as an indicator of health. Initially,G93A mice demonstrate disease symptoms such as hindlimb tremor and then reductions in body weight and/or extension reflex appear at 12\u201313 weeks of age (\nGarbuzova-Davis et al., 2017\n), considered as early symptomatic disease stage. At 13 weeks of age, ALS mice intravenously (iv, jugular vein) received either the appropriate hBM34\n+\ncell dose or an equal volume of media. A non-transplant control group (\nGroup 5)\n, consisted of mice from the background strain that did not carry the mutant SOD1 gene (control, n=16). At 14 weeks of age and weekly until 17 weeks of age, mice were again observed for symptoms of disease progression.\n\n2.3. Cell preparation and transplant procedure\nCryopreserved human bone marrow CD34+ cells (hBM34\n+\n) were purchased from AllCells (Alameda, CA, USA). According to the company report, cells were obtained from healthy donors and tested negative for viral (HIV, HBV, and HCV) screening and microbial growth. Also, the commercial cell analysis report provided information regarding viability (~95%) and purity (~98%) of hBM34\n+\ncells via FACS of CD34-FITC. Preparation of hBM34\n+\ncells for transplantation was previously described in our recent publication (\nGarbuzova-Davis et al., 2017\n). Briefly, hBM34\n+\ncells were thawed rapidly at 37\u00b0C and then transferred slowly with a pipette into a centrifuge tube containing 10 ml of Dulbecco\u2019s Phosphate Buffered Saline 1X (DPBS), pH 7.4 (Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were centrifuged (200 g/10 min) at room temperature (RT), the supernatant discarded and the process repeated. After the final wash, cell viability was assessed using the 0.4% trypan blue dye exclusion method before and after transplantation. Transplant cell concentrations were adjusted for each group: 250 cells/\u03bcl (5\u00d710\n4\ncells/200 \u03bcl/injection, Group 1), 2,500 cells/\u03bcl (5\u00d710\n5\ncells/200 \u03bcl/injection, Group 2), and 5,000 cells/\u03bcl (1\u00d710\n6\ncells/200 \u03bcl/injection, Group 3).\nThe hBM34+ cells were delivered intravenously via the jugular vein of mice under anesthesia with isofluorane (2\u20135% at 2L O\n2\n/min) as we previously described (\nGarbuzova-Davis et al., 2008a\n,\n2003\n) with minor modifications (\nGarbuzova-Davis et al., 2017\n). Briefly, a 26-gauge needle was inserted into the jugular vein of anesthetized animals and a solution containing the cells was injected during 3 min. After transplantation, the incision was closed and sutured using a stainless steel wound clip. The Media mice in Group 4 received 200 \u03bcl of DPBS, the same volume administered to the cell-transplanted mice. Animals in Groups 1\u20134 received cyclosporine A (CsA, 10 mg/kg ip) daily for the entire post-transplant period.\n\n2.4. Perfusion and tissue preparation\nAll cell-treated, media-treated, and control mice were sacrificed under Euthasol\u00ae (0.22 ml/kg body weight) and perfused transcardially with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.2) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PB solution under pressure control fluid delivery at 80\u201385 mm Hg to avoid capillary rupture at 17 weeks of age (corresponding to 4 weeks after initial treatment at symptomatic disease stage) for ultrastructural (electron microscopy), immunohistochemical, and histological analyses in the cervical and lumbar spinal cords. Mouse age of 17 weeks for sacrifice was the same age as we reported earlier (\nGarbuzovaDavis et al., 2017\n) and considered near end-stage of disease. Since our previous report (\nGarbuzova-Davis et al., 2017\n) showed that a high hBM34+ cell dose (1 \u00d7 10\n6\n) administered into symptomatic ALS mice significantly decreased capillary permeability in the spinal cords, the current study was extended to determine capillary leakage in the spinal cords of mice receiving low and mid cell doses. The mice (Group 1: n=8; Group 2: n=9; Group 3: n=9; Group 4: n=10) and controls (Group 5; n=10) were injected with 2% Evans Blue dye (EB, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in saline solution (4 ml/kg body weight) via the tail vein at 30 min prior to perfusion as described (\nGarbuzova-Davis et al., 2017\n). Prior to perfusion, blood samples (about 500\u2013700 \u03bcl) were taken through cardiac puncture from randomly selected cell-treated, media-treated, and control mice (n=56/group) and collected into serum separation tubes (Corvac\u2122) for 10 minutes at RT. Sera were obtained after centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 15 minutes. Mice assayed for EB extravasation received only the PB solution. After perfusion, the entire spinal cords were rapidly removed from cell-treated (n=5\u20136/group), media-treated (n=6) and controls (n=7) for the EB extravasation assay described below. In remaining mice (n=3\u20134/group) receiving EB injection, the cervical and lumbar spinal cord segments were removed, post-fixed intact in 4% PFA for 24\u201348 hours, and then cryoprotected in 20% sucrose in 0.1 M PB overnight. Coronal spinal cord tissues were cut at 30 \u03bcm in a cryostat, every fifth section was thaw-mounted onto slides, and the tissue was stored at 20\u00b0C for immunohistochemical analyses of capillary EB leakage. Also, mice (n=3\u20134/group) were perfused and their spinal cords were removed, post-fixed, cryoprotected, and cut as described above for immunohistochemical analyses of capillary laminin expression. Additionally, blood was collected during perfusion of ALS mice (n=8) only receiving high hBM34+ cell dose (1 \u00d7 10\n6\n) and media-treated mice (n=3). Blood smears were obtained and then fixed in methanol for 10 min for later immunocytochemical analyses of transplanted cells.\nMice assayed for electron microscope analysis were randomly chosen from cell-treated, media-treated, and control groups (n=3/group). Mouse cervical and lumbar spinal cords were immediately removed after perfusion with 4% PFA in 0.1 M PB and fixed in the same fixative for 16\u201324 hours at 4\u00b0C. The next day, spinal cords were coded and cut into 1 mm slices. Tissues were then fixed overnight in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M PB (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Inc., Hatfield, PA) at 4\u00b0C and stored for later electron microscope processing.\n\n2.5. Electron microscopy\nSince compromised B-CNS-B integrity was determined in motor neuron areas in ALS mice at early and late disease stages (\nGarbuzova-Davis et al., 2007a\n,\n2007b\n), structural analyses of cervical and lumbar spinal cord microvessels were performed using electron microscopy. Briefly, spinal cord tissue samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Inc., Hatfield, PA) in 0.1M PB for 1 hour at RT and then dehydrated in a graded series of acetone dilutions. Tissues were transferred to a 50:50 mix of acetone and LX112 epoxy resin embedding mix (Ladd Research Industries, Burlington, VT) and infiltrated with the mix for 1 hour. The tissues were then transferred to a 100% L\u00d7112 embedding mix and infiltrated with fresh changes of this embedding mix. The tissues were further infiltrated overnight in fresh embedding medium at 4\u00baC. On the following day, the tissues were embedded in a fresh change of resin in tissue capsules. The blocks were polymerized at 70\u00b0C in an oven overnight. The blocks were trimmed and then sectioned with a diamond knife on a Leica Ultracut ultramicrotome. Thin sections were cut at 80\u201390 nm, placed on copper grids, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.\n\n2.6. BSCB integrity analysis\nFor analysis of BSCB ultrastructure, microvessels in the cervical and lumbar spinal cords of cell-treated, media-treated, and controls were examined by an investigator blinded to the animal groups, using coded sections, and photographed with an AMT ActiveVu XR 16 digital camera, (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Woburn, MA) attached to a FEI Morgagni transmission electron microscope (FEI, Inc., Hillsboro, OR), at 60kV.\nAnalyses of capillary morphologies in the spinal cords of cell-treated, media-treated, and controls were performed based on electron microscopic (EM) images. Total analyzed capillaries were:\nthe cervical spinal cord\n\u2013 control (n=54), media (n=78), low dose (n=121), mid dose (n=99), and high dose (n=109);\nthe lumbar spinal cord\n\u2013 control (n=55), media (n=72), low dose (n=127), mid dose (n=89), and high dose (n=81). Capillaries were considered of\nnormal morphology\nif a) endothelial cells (ECs) were intact and the basement membrane was a single layer surrounded by astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, b) mitochondria had well preserved cristae in the cytoplasm of all cells including ECs, c) normal neuropil surrounded the capillaries, and d) no evidence of intra- or extracellular edema was displayed.\nModerately impaired\ncapillary morphology was determined by appearance of a) EC cytoplasm with some vacuoles and dilated endoplasmic reticulum, b) swollen mitochondria in ECs and in the neuropil, and/or c) minor extracellular edema between areas of neuropil and near capillaries.\nSeverely compromised\ncapillary morphology was determined by the presence of a) substantially vacuolated ECs, b) necrotic ECs with condensed cytoplasm, c) ECs detached from basement membrane, d) vacuolated mitochondria in the cytoplasm of ECs and neuropil with swelling and disruption of cristae, e) degenerated astrocyte end-feet surrounding the capillaries with free floating swollen mitochondria, and/or f) extensive protein-filled extracellular edema around the capillaries. Quantitative analysis for each capillary category was presented as a percentage of total capillary numbers per animal group for both cervical and lumbar spinal cords.\n\n2.7. BSCB permeability\nEvans Blue (EB) dye, 961 Da, was used as a tracer for assessing BSCB disruption. The EB extravasation assay was performed as previously described (\nGarbuzova-Davis et al., 2017\n,\n2016\n,\n2014\n,\n2007b\n). Briefly, after perfusion, mouse spinal cords were weighed and placed in 50% trichloroacetic acid solution (Sigma). Following homogenization and centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted with ethanol (1:3) and loaded into a 96 wellplate in triplicate. Sera were diluted with ethanol (1:10,000) and loaded separately into a 96-well plate in triplicate also. The dye was measured with a spectrofluorometer (Gemini EM Microplate Spectrofluorometer, Molecular Devices) at excitation of 620 nm and emission of 680 nm (\nAy et al., 2008\n;\nGarbuzova-Davis et al., 2017\n). Calculations were based on external standards in the same solvent. The EB content in tissue was quantified from a linear standard curve derived from known amounts of the dye and was normalized to tissue weight (\u03bcg/g). For sera, EB concentration was quantified similarly and presented as \u03bcg/mL. All measurements were performed by two experimenters blinded to the experiment.\n\n2.8. Immunohistochemical staining\nFor identification of vascular EB leakage, serial spinal cord tissue sections from EB injected mice (n=3\u20134/group) were thaw-mounted on slides and then rinsed several times in PBS to remove the freezing medium. The slides were coverslipped with Vectashield\u00ae containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, USA) and examined under epifluorescence using an Olympus B\u00d760 microscope.\nIn a separate set of cervical and lumbar spinal tissue sections from randomly selected mice (n=34/group), immunohistochemical staining of the basement membrane protein (laminin) was performed as previously described (\nGarbuzova-Davis et al., 2007b\n). Briefly, spinal cord tissues were pre-incubated with 10% goat serum and 0.3% Triton \u00d7 100 in PBS for 60 min at RT and then stained with rabbit anti-laminin polyclonal antibody (1:200, Cat. No. ab11575, Abcam, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The next day, the slides were incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to rhodamine (1:1000, Cat. No. A11012, Invitrogen, USA) for 2 hours. After several rinses in PBS, slides were coverslipped with Vectashield\u00ae containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, USA) and examined under epifluorescence using an Olympus BX60 microscope. Analyses of laminin immunoexpression in the cervical and lumbar spinal cords of cell-treated, media-treated, and control mice were performed in the ventral horns by an investigator blinded to the experiments. Immunohistochemical image analysis for laminin was performed by measuring intensity of fluorescent expression (%/mm\n2\n) in NIH ImageJ (version 1.46) software. Thresholds for detection of laminin fluorescent expressions were adjusted for each image to eliminate background noise as previously described (\nGarbuzova-Davis et al., 2017\n). Immunohistochemical images (n=10 images/spinal cord segment) were taken in randomly selected areas from right and left ventral gray matter of the cervical and lumbar spinal cords at 10\u00d7. Fluorescent intensity (%/mm\n2\n) was measured in the entire image. Data are presented as averages of laminin immunoexpression from both sides.\nFor identification of intravenously transplanted hBM34+ cells within blood circulation, blood was collected during perfusion of ALS mice (n=8) receiving high hBM34+ cell dose (1 \u00d7 10\n6\n) and media-treated mice (n=3) only. Blood smears were obtained and fixed in methanol for 10 minutes. Also, hBM34+ cell smears served as positive controls. Immunofluorescent staining with the human-specific nuclei marker (HuNu) was performed as we described previously (\nGarbuzova-Davis et al., 2017\n,\n2012b\n,\n2008b\n). Briefly, the mouse monoclonal antibody (HuNu, 1:100, Cat. No. 1281, Millipore Sigma, USA) was combined with the secondary antibody, monovalent goat anti-mouse Fab\u2019 fragment conjugated to rhodamine (1:200; Cat. No. 115\u2013607-003, Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA), and incubated at RT for 2 hours. The blood and cell smears were preincubated with 1% normal human serum (NHS) and 0.5% Triton X 100 in PBS for 30 min at RT and subsequently incubated with the previously prepared antibody cocktail overnight at 4\u00b0C. Next day, slides were thoroughly washed in PBS and coverslipped with Vectashield\u00ae containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, USA). The slides were then examined under epifluorescence using an Olympus BX60 microscope. Cells immunopositive for HuNu were counted manually from the entire slide at 40X and determined as a percentage of total nucleated cells for each mouse.\nTo test for specificity of the immunostaining for laminin and HuNu, the primary antibodies were omitted from control slides. No staining was observed in the control sections.\n\n2.9. Histological staining and analysis\nAs part of preparing the spinal cord tissues for EM, tissue post-fixation in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, osmication in 1% osmium tetroxide, acetone dehydration, and embedding in LX112 epoxy resin were performed as described above. Tissues were embedded in plastic blocks and semi-thin tissue sections (0.35 \u03bcm) were cut using a Leica Ultracut ultramicrotome and then mounted on glass slides. Spinal cord sections were stained with 1% toluidine blue (Fisher Scientific, USA) for 1 minute, rinsed in water, de-stained in 95% ethanol, dried, and then coverslipped. This specific tissue preservation and fixation result in conventional toluidine blue-stained myelinated fibers in the spinal cords (\nDi Scipio et al., 2008\n;\nFeirabend et al., 1998\n). Morphological analyses of axonal myelin sheaths were performed in the lumbar spinal cords at L3-L4 segments of cell-treated, media-treated, and controls (n=3/group). The phase contrast images were taken at 4X using an Olympus B \u00d7 60 microscope. Histological image analysis for myelin was performed by measuring intensity of staining expression (%/mm\n2\n) in NIH ImageJ (version 1.46) software. Thresholds for detection of myelin staining were adjusted for each image to eliminate background noise as previously described (\nGarbuzova-Davis et al., 2017\n). Images (n=2\u20133 images/spinal cord side/group) were taken in selected areas from lateral funiculus (LF) and ventral horn (VH) on both sides of the lumbar spinal cords at 10\u00d7. Myelin intensity (%/mm\n2\n) was measured in the entire image. Additionally, capillary numbers were counted at 3\u201310 \u03bcm in diameter on both sides of lumbar VH images (n=3/side/group) at 40X using NIH ImageJ software. Capillary density (number/mm\n2\n) was determined for each entire image. Data are presented as averages of capillary density in VH of each spinal cord side.\n\n2.10. Statistical analysis\nData are presented as means \u00b1 S.E.M. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey HSD (Honesty Significant Difference) multiple comparison test using online statistical software (astatsa.com, 2016 Navendu Vasavada) was performed for statistical analysis. Significance was defined as p < 0.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Fimasartan administration\nFimasartan (Boryung Pharmaceutical Company, Republic of Korea), was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (1 mg/mL) and diluted with sterile water to constitute either the low dose (0.5 mg/kg, p.o.) or regular doses (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg, p.o.) according to our previous study (\nKim et al., 2015\n). Fimasartan or distilled water (DW) was administered orally for 30 days prior to the induction of ICH, and continuously for 3 days after the surgery at the same time every morning.\n\n2.2. Induction of intracerebral hemorrhage\nAll animal experimental protocols were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations approved by the National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Use Committee of the Biomedical Research Institute at Seoul National University Hospital. Total 113 four-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (Koatech, Seoul, Republic of Korea) weighing 65\u201375 g were randomly separated into five groups: sham, ICH + DW, ICH + low-dose fimasartan (0.5 mg/kg, p.o.) and ICH + regular-doses fimasartan (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg, p.o.). After one month, we performed the ICH surgery on adult rats at 8 weeks of age (250 \u2013 300 g) as previously published (\nSong et al., 2003\n). The rats were then injected intrastriatally (3.0 mm left, 0.2 mm posterior to the bregma and 6.0 mm in depth) with collagenase IV (0.6 U in 1 \u03bcL saline, Sigma) in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA). The forelimb flexion and contralateral circling were observed to confirm the success of the ICH surgery. Sham-operated rats only underwent needle insertion without collagenase injection. Male rats were used to avoid the neuroprotective effects of estrogens which may affect stroke outcome (\nDubal and Wise, 2002\n).\n\n2.3. Monitoring of blood pressure\nMean BP levels were noninvasively monitored at the same time from the rat\u2019s tail (homologated by Bland Altman Testing) (\nCiocoiu et al., 2013\n) with a CODA Noninvasive Blood Pressure System (Kent Scientific Corporation, Torrington, CT) throughout the whole experiment including days 28, 21, 14, 7 and 3 prior to the surgery and at baseline with the administration of fimasartan (n = 10 per group) (\nFig. 1A\n).\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nSchematic diagram of the study design and brain areas where positive cells are quantified. (A) A low-dose (0.5 mg/kg), regular-doses (1 or 3 mg/kg) of fimasartan, or DW was administrated to Sprague-Dawley rats 30 days before the induction of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and 3 days after surgery. Noninvasive mean BP was monitored during the course pretreated with fimasartan. Western blot analysis, RT-PCR, ELISA and immunofluorescence staining were performed 1 day after ICH. Brain water content and hemorrhage volume were evaluated 3 days after ICH. The recovery of neurological function was assessed on 1 h, 1 day and 3 days after ICH. (B) High-power field images fully covering the perihematomal areas were obtained from slices through the center of the hemorrhagic lesion for counting NLRP3 inflammasome components on activated microglia cells. The square markers indicate Iba-1-positive cells in the perihematomal region.\n\n2.4. Measuring the brain water content and hemorrhage volume\nWe analyzed the brain water content and hematoma volume 3 days after surgery because edema is the most severe three days after ICH (\nXi et al., 2006\n). Rats were euthanized 72 h after ICH. The brains (n = 12 per group) were then divided into two hemispheres along the midline and immediately weighed using an electric analytical balance to obtain the wet weight. The brain samples were then dried in a gravity oven at 100 \u00b0C for 24 h to obtain the dry weight. Water content = (wet content-dry content)/(wet content) \u00d7 100% (\nSong et al., 2003\n).\nTo evaluate the hemorrhagic lesion volume, the brains (n = 8 per group) were serially sectioned at 1-mm intervals in the coronal plane through the needle entry site. The hematoma area of each section was assessed by Image J (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The total hematoma volume (mm\n3\n) was calculated by summing the hematoma area in each section and multiplying by the thickness of the sections (\nKim et al., 2013\n).\n\n2.5. Behavioral testing\nTwo behavioral tests, the modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) and forelimb placing test, were performed by investigators blinded to the groups. The rats were assessed before and 1 h, 1 day and 3 days after ICH (n = 17 per group). The mNSS test includes a composite of the motor (six points), sensory (two points), and beam balance (six points) tests, in addition to the absence of reflexes and presence of abnormal movements (four points). The mNSS is graded on a scale of 0\u201318 (normal score = 0; maximal deficit score = 18) to determine impairment (\nChen et al., 2001\n).\nThe vibrissae-elicited forelimb placing test was used to assess the asymmetry between forelimbs (\nSchallert et al., 2000\n). The rats were held to allow their forelimbs hanging free. Each forelimb was tested by stimulating their ipsilateral vibrissae on the edge of the countertop once per trial for 10 trials. Intact rats stretch each forelimb quickly on the edge of the table in response to vibrissae stimulation. The total scores were determined by the percentage of successful placing responses.\n\n2.6. Western blotting\nThe brain tissue samples from the sham, control and low-dose fimasartan groups (n = 5 per group), were homogenized in ice-cold RIPA buffer (Biosesang, Seoul, Korea) after euthanasia 1-day post-ICH. The protein concentration was determined using a Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Protein (60 \u03bcg) was separated on 8% and 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels using an electrophoresis gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene-difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and incubated with primary antibodies (\nTable 1\n) overnight. After blocking the secondary antibodies with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the blots were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Image J (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used to analyze the density of the signals. The results are representative of at least three independent experiments from every brain sample.\nTable 1.\nList of antibodies.\nAntibody\nSupplier, catalog no.\nHost\nWB\nIF\nNLRP3\nSanta Cruz, sc-66,846\nRabbit\n1:200\n1:50\nASC\nSanta Cruz, sc-22,514\nRabbit\n1:200\n1:100\nCaspase-1\nAbcam, ab1872\nRabbit\n1:200\n1:50\nIL-1\u03b2\nAbcam, ab9722\nRabbit\n1:1000\n\u2212\nIL-18\nSanta Cruz, sc-7954\nRabbit\n1:200\n\u2212\nNF\u03baB\nAbcam, ab7970\nRabbit\n1:1000\n\u2212\nI\u03baB\nCell Signaling, 9242\nRabbit\n1:1000\n\u2212\nCOX-2\nAbcam, ab15191\nRabbit\n1:1000\n\u2212\nGFAP\nCell Signaling, 3670\nMouse\n\u2212\n1:200\nIba-1\nSanta Cruz, sc-28,528\nGoat\n\u2212\n1:50\nActin\nBioworld, BSAP0060\nRabbit\n1:10,000\n\u2212\nOpen in a new tab\nWB, Western Blot; IF, Immunofluorescence.\n\n2.7. Quantitative Real-Time PCR\nThe brain tissue was rinsed with cold PBS, and total RNA was isolated from the left striatum of every group (n = 5 per group) using TRIzol \u00ae reagent (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA, USA). A total of 2 \u03bcg of RNA was converted into cDNA using TOPscript RT DryMIX (Enzynomics Inc., Korea) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The Taqman probes for NLRP3 mRNA (Assay ID: Rn04244620_m1) and caspase-1 mRNA (Assay ID: Rn00562725_g1) were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The sequence-specific primers were as follows: ASC, forward, 5\u2019-GCT CAC AAT GTC TGT GCT TAG AG-3\u2032; reverse, 5\u2032-GCA GTA GCC ACA GCT CCA G-3\u2032 and rS6, forward 5\u2019-TGC TCT TGG TGA AGA GTG GA-3\u2032; reverse 5\u2032-CAA GAA TGC CCC TTA CTC AAA-3\u2032. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq\u2122 (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) on an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Lincoln, CA, USA). The results are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the relative mRNA expression normalized to GAPDH or rS6 using the comparative \u0394\u0394Ct method.\n\n2.8. Cytokine measurement\nThe levels of cytokines including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) and TNF-\u03b1 were quantified by single-plex ELISA kit specific for rat tissue (n = 5 per group) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (R&D systems). The results are reported based on standards and expressed as pictograms of the measured molecule per mL of tissue (pg/mL).\n\n2.9. Double-labeled immunofluorescence staining and cell quantification\nRats (n = 6 per group) were transcardially perfused with saline and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L (PH 7.4) phosphate-buffered saline at 1 day after ICH. The cryopreserved brain samples were sectioned in the coronal plane at a thickness of 10 \u03bcm and mounted onto silane-coated slides (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The sections were incubated with primary antibodies (summarized in\nTable 1\n) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. For double immunofluorescence (IF) staining, specific cellular markers including ionized calcium binding adaptor protein-1 (Iba-1) for microglia were used to identify the inflammasome derived from different cell types. The slides were mounted with DAKO Paramount (DAKO Corporation, Carpinteria, CA) to stain the cell nuclei. The primary antibody was omitted as a negative control for the IF staining. Bright-field and fluorescence micrographs were acquired using a Leica DM5500B microscope (Leica Microsystems) and LAS-AF image acquisition software (Leica Microsystems, Rijswijk, Netherlands).\nThe number of positive cells in the perihematomal regions was counted in 3 axial sections and at least 4 fields for each section per animal through the center of the hemorrhagic lesion by two independent investigators who were masked to the group identification according to established protocols (\nJung et al., 2004\n). To count the number of positive microglia, 16 high-power fields were obtained from the stained sections through the center of the ICH lesion (\nFig. 1B\n) 1 day after ICH. The total counts in the measured sections were converted into cell densities for comparison between the ICH groups.\n\n2.10. Microglia cell culture and treatment\nThe mouse microglia cell line BV2 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. Microglia cells were divided into four groups. One is the control group and the second group was stimulated by hemolysate alone. The third group was pretreated with fimasartan (30 ng/mL) alone for 6 h and the last group was stimulated with fimasartan before incubation with 10% hemolysate for 2 h, and then harvested for western blotting analysis.\n\n2.11. Statistical analysis\nThe results are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). The results from the different groups were analyzed using an unpaired sample t-test or repeated measures of analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc test. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for unpaired and paired samples, respectively. The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to test multiple groups. A two-tailed value of p < .05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Animals.\nThe Chancellor\u2019s Animal Research Committee at UCLA approved all experiments. Rats were housed under standard conditions with free access to food and water. Olfactory bulb-derived OECs and skin FBs were obtained from 8\u201310 week old female enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-expressing Sprague-Dawley rats (\nPerry\net al\n., 1999\n). One GFP-expressing rat was used to generate the OECs or FBs transplanted into each spinal rat. An overdose of ketamine-xylazine was used for euthanasia before the extraction of olfactory bulbs and abdominal skin biopsies. Ten female Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, 10\u201312 weeks old) received complete midthoracic spinal cord transections and were maintained for 6\u20137 mos.\n\nOlfactory bulb-derived OEC and FB cultures.\nMethods to prepare OEC primary and immunopurified cultures were similar to those of\nRam\u00f3n-Cueto\net al\n. (2000)\nand identical to the description in\nKhankan\net al\n. (2016)\n. OECs were dissected from the first two layers of GFP-expressing rat olfactory bulbs. Following cell dissociation, OECs were maintained\nin vitro\nfor 5 d and immunopurified using anti-p75-nerve growth factor receptor antibody (1:5; clone 192). Purified OECs were cultured for an additional 7 d before transplantation. Rats were shaved and skin biopsies from the abdominal wall were dissociated into FB cultures as described (\nTakashima, 2001\n;\nKhankan\net al\n., 2016\n). FBs were passaged 1\u20132 times before transplantation (12\u201314 d\nin vitro\n).\n\nImplantation of stimulating electrodes and intramuscular recording electrodes.\nRats were deeply anesthetized with 1\u20132.5% isoflurane gas during all surgeries. A midline longitudinal incision was made in the scalp and two stainless steel screws were inserted through pilot holes so that the tip of the screws contacted the cortical dura mater. Teflon-coated wire electrodes (AS632, Cooner Wire) were attached to a head-plug connector (Amphenol) and the head-plug was secured to the skull as described in\nIyer\net al\n. (2010)\n. Next, partial laminectomies were performed at spinal levels L2 and S1 and the epidural stimulating electrodes were fixed to the dorsal dura mater and attached to the head-plug (\nIchiyama\net al\n., 2005\n). Surgical EMG implantation methods were similar to those in\nRoy\net al\n. (1992)\nand\nGad\net al\n. (2013)\n. The skin and fascial incisions exposed the bellies of the soleus and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles bilaterally. Two wires from the head-plug connector were routed underneath the skin from the cranium to each muscle. The electrodes were positioned in the mid-belly of the muscle and secured with two sutures. Proper electrode positioning was verified by muscle contractions elicited by stimulation and then a ground wire was placed subcutaneously in the dorsum of the rat. The skin was sutured and disinfected with betadine, pain medication and fluids were administered, and the rats recovered in an incubator.\n\nSpinal cord injury and cell transplantation.\nIn a second surgery 3 wks later, a skin incision was made at vertebral levels T6 to L1, the paravertebral muscles were retracted, and partial laminectomies were performed at T7 and T8. The dorsal dura was incised longitudinally and then laterally at both ends to expose the spinal cord. The spinal cord was completely transected near spinal level T7/T8 with micro-scissors, leaving the ventral and lateral dura mostly intact. The rostral and caudal stumps were separated, lifted, and the intact dura was scraped with a glass probe and small cotton balls to sever any spared axons.\nBefore transplantation, OECs or FBs were rinsed, centrifuged, and re-suspended at a concentration of 100,000 cells per 1 \u03bcl in serum-free DMEM (\nKhankan\net al\n., 2016\n). Immediately after the transection, ~400,00 total OECs (n = 5) or FBs (n = 5) were injected stereotactically into the spinal cord 1 mm rostral and caudal to the transection as in\nRam\u00f3n-Cueto\net al\n. (2000)\n. The spinous processes of the T7\u2013T13 vertebra were stabilized with a stainless steel bar to protect the transection site. Bladder expressions were performed 3\u00d7/d for the first mo, and 2\u00d7/d at 12-hr intervals thereafter. Rats were inspected daily for weight loss or dehydration and their urine was tested weekly with Multistix 10 SG reagent strips (Siemens). Investigators were blinded to the cell treatment groups from the time of transplantation until completion of the study.\n\nEpidural stimulation, climb training, and behavioral analyses.\nBefore surgery, rats were trained to climb a 1-inch grid positioned at 60 and 90-degree angles from the horizontal plane (\nRam\u00f3n-Cueto\net al\n., 2000\n;\nZiegler\net al\n., 2011\n). The inclined grid was connected to a 36-inch tower attached to a low-friction Plexiglas platform covered on 3 sides with dark plastic. Rats received a food reward when they completed the climb and lifted themselves onto the slippery platform. Climb training was conducted for 20 min/d, 3\u00d7/wk, for 6 mos, starting 1 mo after spinal cord transection. Rats received 40 Hz epidural stimulation during each climbing session at a voltage of 95% of threshold, which was calculated daily by determining the minimum stimulation to elicit a palpable muscle contraction. Climbing tests were videotaped and EMG activity in the soleus and TA muscles was recorded pre-injury, and with and without epidural stimulation at 3, 5, and 7 mos post-injury.\nTwo independent observers reviewed the videos of the climbing tests for evidence of hindlimb function. The number of \u201cpushoffs\u201d was counted for each test as described in\nZiegler\net al\n. (2011)\n. A pushoff was determined visually as hindpaw placement on a horizontal grid rung with ankle joint extension while the paw was lifted and placed onto a higher rung. The number of pushoffs was compared between OEC and FB groups, with and without epidural stimulation, and over time. The corresponding EMG data for each pushoff was examined and the mean and peak amplitudes of the muscle activity for the TA and soleus were averaged and compared. EMG recordings were normalized to recordings made while the rat was inactive.\n\nPRV injections.\nAt 6 (2 rats) or 7 mos (8 rats) post-transection, pairs of OEC-(n=5) and FB-treated rats (n=5) received injections of eGFP-expressing PRV Bartha-152 (1.21\u00d710\n9\npfu/mL, generous gift from Drs. Patrick Card and Lynn Enquist, Center for Neuroanatomy of Neurotropic Viruses) into two hindlimb muscles (soleus and/or TA) per rat (\nCard & Enquist, 2014\n). Pairs of OEC- and FB-treated rats received PRV injections into the same muscles for comparison. Rats were anesthetized in a BSL-2 biosafety cabinet and an incision was made to expose the target muscle. The soleus received 4 injections of 2.5 \u03bcl of virus (10 \u03bcl total), while the TA received 8 injections of 2.5 \u03bcl of virus (20 \u03bcl total). A stainless steel 30-gauge beveled needle attached to a 10 \u03bcl Hamilton syringe was used to inject PRV near the motor end plates. The needle was left\nin situ\nafter each injection for ~2 min to prevent backflow. Spinal rats were perfused 6 days after PRV injection.\n\nTissue preparation.\nRats were anesthetized with ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally, perfused intracardially with periodate-lysine-4% paraformaldehyde (4% PLP), and post-fixed in 4% PLP for 2\u20133 hrs (\nCard & Enquist, 2014\n). Spinal cords were dissected, placed in 30% sucrose for 48\u201372 hrs, blocked, embedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek), and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. Sagittal sections (25 \u03bcm) were cut and mounted on a series of 16 slides so that each slide represented 6\u20137 sections 400 \u03bcm apart throughout the spinal cord width. Slides were matched between rats so that a comparable sample of the spinal cord width was analyzed for each immunohistochemical experiment.\n\nImmunohistochemistry.\nTo analyze the injury site, at least one slide containing every 16\nth\nsection was processed for immunofluorescence with primary antibodies against GFP (1:1000, chicken, Aves Labs Inc., Cat# GFP-1020) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:1000, mouse, BD Biosciences, # 556327; 1:10K, rabbit, Dako, # Z0334). An additional marker was used to identify one of the following components: serotonergic axons (5-HT, 1:5000, goat, Immunostar, # 20079), fibronectin (FN, 1:1000, rabbit, Dako, # A0245), neurofilament (NF-200, 1:1000, rabbit, Millipore, # AB1989), and/or aquaporin-4 (Aq4, 1:1000, rabbit, Sigma-Aldrich. # A5971). Slides were rinsed with 0.1M Tris buffer containing 1.4% NaCl and 0.1% BSA, permeabilized, and blocked (normal donkey serum, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, #017-000-121; normal goat serum, Vector Laboratories, #S-1000) for 1.5 hrs before 24 hr primary antibody incubation. Sections then were incubated with species-appropriate AlexaFluor 488, 555, 594, or 647 secondary antibodies (1:100-500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, donkey-anti-chick-488, # 703-545-155; donkey-anti-goat-594, # 705-585-147; donkey-anti-goat-647, # 705-605-147; donkey-anti-rabbit-647, # 711-605-152; donkey-anti-mouse-647, # 715-605-150; Life Technologies: donkey-anti-mouse-555, #\nA31570\n; donkey-anti-rabbit-555, # A31572) and counterstained with bis-benzimide (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich, # B2261).\nTo analyze the number and location of the PRVeGFP-labeled neurons rostral to the injury site, four slides from the rostral thoracic (T3\u2013T6) block were processed with chick anti-GFP (1:2000). Slides were matched between rats so that a comparable sample of the spinal cord width was analyzed for all immunohistochemistry analyses. Slides were rinsed with 0.1M phosphate buffer containing 0.9% NaCl and blocked with donkey serum and an avidin-biotin-complex blocking kit (1:1, Vector, # SP-2001) for 1 hr before the primary antibody incubation. The following day, sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:750, donkey-anti-chicken, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, # 703-065-155), avidin-biotin-complex (1:200) for 1 hr, and visualized with 3\u20133\u2019 diaminobenzidine intensified with 0.02% imidazole.\nTo identify the PRVeGFP-labeled cells rostral to the injury site, one slide (6\u20137 sections each) from both the injury site block (T7\u2013T9) and the rostral thoracic block (T3\u2013T6) were processed to evaluate the extent of co-localization with cholinergic neurons (anti-ChAT, 1:500, goat, Millipore, AB144P) or V2a interneurons (anti-Chx10, 1:500, goat, Santa Cruz, # sc-21690) using tyramide signal amplification (TSA-Plus, PerkinElmer, # NEL741). Slide-mounted sections were rinsed with 0.1M Tris buffer containing 1.4% NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20, incubated with TNB, and avidin-biotin-complex blocking solutions (1:1), and then incubated with the primary antibody for 48\u201372 hours at 4\u00b0C. We used the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:250\u2013500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, donkey-anti-chicken, # 703-065-155; Vector, horse-anti-goat, # BA-9500), streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (1:250\u2013500, PerkinElmer, # FP1047), and cyanine-3 fluorophore diluted in amplification buffer (1:250, PerkinElmer, # FP1135).\n\nImage acquisition and analyses.\nPanoramic micrographs were obtained with an Olympus AX70 microscope equipped with an AxioCam HRcRv.2 and ZEN software (2012, Zeiss). Confocal images were taken with a Zeiss LSM 510/800 microscope. All cell counts and contour area tracing analyses were conducted with Neurolucida and Neurolucida Explorer (v10, MicroBrightField). Images were pseudocolored, edited, and compiled into figures with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.\nTo determine the lesion core volume and percent spared tissue, one slide was labeled for GFAP and Aq4 to identify astrocyte intermediate filaments and processes and fibronectin (FN) to mark the extracellular matrix in the lesion core. Total cord volume, lesion core volume, and cyst volume were calculated as described (\nKubasak\net al\n., 2008\n). The spared tissue volume was expressed as a percentage of the total cord volume for each rat. To quantify the area of astrocytes and axons in the injury site we used the Neurolucida contours function to measure the GFAP-positive extensions, 5-HT-positive axons, and neurofilament-labeled axons. To quantify the extent of 5-HT axon regeneration we measured the area of 5-HT immunoreactivity in the injury site and counted 5-HT-positive axon bundles that crossed the rostral glial scar border, as described (\nKhankan\net al\n., 2016\n). Axons labeled with neurofilament were traced as reported for the 5-HT axons, but axons that originated from peripheral roots were excluded.\nPRVeGFP-labeled cells were counted if a distinct cell soma and at least one process were identified. Cell counts were normalized to the section area (cm\n2\n). For the cell location analyses, PRVeGFP-labeled cells within laminae I-V were designated as dorsal, laminae VII, X, and the intermediolateral (IML) cell column as intermediate, and laminae VIII and IX as ventral spinal cord. In preliminary experiments most PRVeGFP-positive, NeuN-negative cell bodies were less than 10 \u03bcm in diameter, and therefore we used a 10 \u03bcm cutoff when counting PRV-eGFP-positive cells to exclude infected astrocytes that do not possess the molecular machinery to facilitate viral spread (\nCard\net al\n., 1993\n). To analyze the phenotype of PRV-labeled thoracic interneurons, one slide from the T3\u2013T6 region and another from the injury site block (T6\u2013T7/8) were processed to assess co-localization with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and the transcription factor Chx10. Any cells that appeared co-localized in the panoramic photomicrograph were reimaged with confocal microscopy.\nWe only considered that PRVeGFP-labeled cells rostral to the transection could be connected to somatic motor neurons if the transected rats had 1) evidence of axons (5-HT-, NF-, and PRV-labeled) crossing the injury site, and 2) PRVeGFP double labeling with cell-specific markers in typical locations for somatic interneurons known to participate in locomotor circuits. We focused on two groups of somatic interneurons: cholinergic propriospinal (medial partition and central canal cluster cells) and V2a interneurons. The cholinergic interneurons are found in or near lamina X, form \u201cC-type\u201d synapses with somatic motor neurons, and function in locomotor circuits (\nPhelps\net al\n., 1984\n;\nPhelps et al., 1990\n;\nHuang\net al\n., 2000\n;\nMiles\net al\n., 2007\n;\nZagoraiou\net al\n., 2009\n,\nJordon et al., 2014\n). The V2a glutamatergic interneurons express Chx10, and are concentrated in the intermediate spinal cord (\nDougherty and Kiehn, 2010\n;\nNi\net al\n., 2014\n;\nUeno\net al\n., 2018\n). To our knowledge, neither the medial partition cells nor the Chx10 interneurons contact sympathetic preganglionic neurons. Sympathetic interneurons are known to be glutamatergic, GABAergic and glycinergic, and cholinergic, but currently there are no definitive interneuron markers to distinguish SPN-connected circuits (\nSchramm, 2006\n;\nDeuchars, 2015\n;\nUeno\net al\n., 2016\n).\n\n3-D visualization.\nWe created a 3-D rendering of the injury site in the OEC-treated spinal rat with marked evidence of regeneration. Twenty-two sagittal sections with an inter-section interval of 100 \u03bcm were immunolabeled for astrocytes (GFAP), serotonergic axons and PRVeGFP-labeled neurons. Neurolucida was used to make contour traces of GFAP and 5-HT labeling, and to place markers for PRVeGFP-labeled cells. The contours and markers belonging to a single section were grouped using Neurolucida\u2019s serial section manager and then assigned to the z-value. Sections were overlaid in sequence and aligned to the prior section by matching multiple regions of interest that were consistent across sections (e.g., the meningeal scar). To rebuild axon tracts, the contours associated with the same axon bundle region were manually grouped and saved as different contours. The 3-D visualization feature then was used to construct the model.\n\nStatistical analyses.\nDue to the small sample size and possible lack of normality, statistical comparisons for anatomical measures were conducted in R (3.2.2; R Core Team, 2015) using re-sampling techniques (\nEfron & Tibshirani, 1991\n). The null hypothesis was simulated 10,000 times using the non-parametric bootstrap approximation to compute non-parametric standard errors and corresponding\np\nvalues. Our experimental effect sizes were compared to the bootstrapped confidence intervals to generate\np\n-values.\nTo assess the association between 5-HT axon area and astrocyte extension area in the injury site, we carried out a linear regression and also reported the corresponding Pearson correlation (\nr\n). Linear regression was used since the corresponding scatter plot showed a linear relationship. All group comparison plots were exported from JMP (Software Version 10, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and represent the group mean +/\u2212 bootstrapped SEM. Statistical significance was determined at *\np\n< 0.05 or **\np\n< 0.01.\nThe behavioral tests means were compared using a parametric repeated measure (mixed) model allowing correlation between multiple measurements on the same animal. Normal quantile plots and the Shapiro-Wilks test confirmed that the errors followed a normal distribution, justifying the use of a parametric model."

    "Methods": "Generation of Nogo conditional mice\nA conditional allele of Nogo was generated in which the first two exons common to all three major Nogo isoforms (Nogo-A,B,C) were flanked by loxP sites (\u201cfloxed\u201d). Cre-mediated excision of these two exons would lead to a frame shift for all downstream exons and was predicted to result in a null for Nogo-C and at least a severe hypomorph for Nogo-A and Nogo-B. Importantly, this strategy would eliminate the expression of the growth inhibitory Nogo-66 amino acid loop shared by all three Nogo isoforms (\nGrandPre et al., 2000\n), and targeting a similar region of Nogo was previously shown to result in a null or severe hypomorph for all three major Nogo isoforms (\nZheng et al., 2003\n). A targeting vector containing the floxed exons preceded by a floxed Neomycin selection cassette (thus with a total of three loxP sites) was targeted to the endogenous Nogo locus by homologous recombination in AB2.2 mouse embryonic stem cells to generate the targeted allele, which was then transmitted through the germline. Targeted events were initially identified by Southern blot analysis. The expected loxP sites in the targeted allele were verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analysis. The targeted mutant was bred to a universal deleter strain Actin-Cre (\nLewandoski et al., 1997\n) to excise the Neomycin cassette via Cre-mediated partial excision, generating mice harboring the conditional allele of Nogo (\nFig. 2A\n) as determined by PCR genotyping. Nogo conditional mutant mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6 at least 10 generations. To generate inducible oligodendrocyticspecific Nogo gene knockout mice, mice homozygous for the Nogo conditional allele (Nogo\nf/f\n) were bred to PLPCreER\nT\nmice (\nDoerflinger et al., 2003\n) and backcrossed to generate Nogo\nf/f\nand Nogo\nf/f\n;PLPCreER\nT\nbreeders that were used to generate littermate Nogo\nf/f\ncontrol and Nogo\nf/f\n;PLPCreER\nT\nmice for sprouting studies. To generate conditional Nogo mice with gene knockout from CST neurons, conditional Nogo mice were bred to a tdTomato reporter line (\nMadisen et al., 2010\n) to generate littermate Nogo\n+/f\ncontrol and Nogo\nf/f\nmice all heterozygous for the inducible tdTomato reporter gene and were injected with AAV-Cre into the sensorimotor cortex to delete Nogo from CST neurons (as detailed below).\nFigure 2.

Scale bar = 50 \u03bcm.\n\nTamoxifen administration\nAnimals were administered 2 mg of tamoxifen (VWR) dissolved in sunflower oil or sunflower oil vehicle via intraperitoneal (IP) injection daily (2 mg/mouse/day) for 5 days beginning at 5 weeks of age for all studies. For sprouting and behavior studies, both Nogo\nf/f\n;PLPCreER\nT\nmice and Nogo\nf/f\n(Cre-less) controls were administered tamoxifen.\n\nWestern blot\nSpinal cord protein was extracted by homogenization in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.25% DOC, 1% SDS, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 mM PMSF, and Complete Mini (Roche). After sitting on ice for 30 min, tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 11,000g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and 30 \u03bcg of protein in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) was separated with SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). Membranes were washed in TBS-T 4\u00d75 minutes, blocked with 5% milk for 1 hour at room temperature, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibody. The next day, membranes were washed in TBS-T 4\u00d75 minutes and incubated in appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:50,000, Peirce) while shaking for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing in TBST 4\u00d75 minutes, membranes were incubated in Supersignal West Dura (Peirce) chemiluminescence solution for 5 min and then exposed to film (Genesee Scientific). For loading control detection, membrane portion containing actin was cut and detected as described above. Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-Nogo-A at 1:500 (\nZheng et al., 2003\n) and mouse anti-actin at 1:1000 (Millipore).\n\nTissue processing\nTissue processing was performed as described previously with minor modifications (\nLee et al., 2009\n;\nLee et al., 2010\n). Mice were administered a lethal dose of Fatal plus and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brain and spinal cord were dissected out, and the tissues were post-fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C in the same fixative solution. Tissues were incubated in 30% sucrose for cryo-protection. Brain, medulla, and C1-C7 cervical spinal cord were embedded in OCT compound and frozen on dry ice. Tissues were sectioned with a cryostat at a thickness of 20 \u03bcm. For sprouting studies, transverse sections of the medullas were processed to obtain estimates of the total number of CST axons labeled to control for labeling efficiency (see below). For tissues containing biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) labeled axons, cervical spinal cord and medulla sections were incubated in Vectastain ABC solution (Vector Laboratories) overnight at 4\u00b0C, washed in PBS, and mounted on gelatin-coated slides. BDA was detected with TSA Plus Fluorescein System (10 min, room temperature, 1:200, PerkinElmer). For tissues containing tdTomato-labeled axons, cervical spinal cord and medulla sections were processed without immunostaining for tdTomato. For immunohistochemistry, the following antibodies were used: purified polyclonal rabbit anti-Nogo-A (1:500) as described previously (\nZheng et al., 2003\n), mouse anti-APC clone CC-1 (1:200, Millipore), rabbit anti-VGLUT1 (1:500, Abcam), biotinylated mouse anti-NeuN (1:100, Millipore), and rat anti-GFAP (1:200, Invitrogen). For sprouting studies, selected transverse sections of cervical spinal cord (C7) were immunostained for PKC\u03b3 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to examine the completeness of the lesion for each animal, as described previously (\nLee et al., 2010\n). Mice with incomplete lesion were excluded from the study. A total of 1 animal was excluded based on this criteria of the genotype Nogo\nf/f\n;PLPCreER\nT\n.\n\nImmunofluorescence quantifications\nTo quantify the intensity of Nogo-A immunofluorescence in white and gray matter of cervical spinal cord, the mean intensity of the entire white and gray matter regions of transverse spinal cord sections were measured in AxioVision and averaged across five sections per animal. Mean intensity of the white and gray matter of germline Nogo knockout tissue was subtracted as the background for white and gray matter measurements. To quantify the number of APC\n+\ncells that express Nogo-A, the total number of APC\n+\ncells and the number of APC\n+\nNogo-A\n+\ncells were counted in a 335 \u03bcm x 448 \u03bcm sample region of cervical gray matter and of cervical white matter by an observer blinded to genotype for n=3 Nogo\nf/f\n;no Cre and n=3 Nogo\nf/f\n;PLPCreER\nT\nmice. To quantify the percent of BDA\n+\naxons expressing VGLUT1, the total number of BDA\n+\naxons and the number of BDA\n+\nVGLUT1\n+\naxons were counted in a 168 \u03bcm x 224 \u03bcm sample region of cervical spinal cord gray matter with percent averaged between 3 sections per animal by an observer blinded to genotype for n=3 Nogo\nf/f\n;no Cre and n=3 Nogo\nf/f\n;PLPCreER\nT\nmice. To calculate the percent of tdTomato\n+\ncells expressing NeuN, APC and GFAP and the percent of each cell type expressing tdTomato, the following were counted in a 335 \u03bcm x 448 \u03bcm sample cortical region near the injection site (where overall tdTomato expression rate was roughly 75% of DAPI\n+\ncells): the total number of cells expressing tdTomato, NeuN, APC, and GFAP, and the total number of cells expressing both tdTomato and each cell type marker for n=3 Nogo\nf/f\n;no Cre and n=3 Nogo\nf/f\n;PLPCreER\nT\nmice. Percent calculations from 3 regions were averaged for each animal.\n\nSurgical procedures\nPyramidotomy and biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) tracer injection were performed as described previously with minor modifications (\nGeoffroy et al., 2015\n;\nLee et al., 2010\n;\nLiu et al., 2010\n;\nStarkey et al., 2005\n). Surgeons performing the surgeries were blinded to genotype. All animals were anesthetized with 2.5% Avertin (Sigma) and incision wounds were closed using Vetbond (3M). Pyramidotomy was performed at 2.5 months of age for anatomy studies (neuronal Nogo-A deletion, oligodendrocytic Nogo-A deletion without injury) and at approximately 4 months of age for behavior studies after completion of behavioral pre-training and baseline performance assessment. An incision was made overlying the trachea and the pyramidal tracts were accessed at the base of the skull (\nStarkey et al., 2005\n). A Feather micro scalpel was used to lesion the entire left pyramidal tract just caudal to the foramen magnum. Sham surgeries consisted of accessing the pyramidal tract in the same manner without lesioning the pyramidal tract. Cortical injection of BDA (10%, Invitrogen) was performed 2 weeks prior to sacrifice for all studies using the same injection volumes and coordinates as for AAVinjection (see Viral production and injection). Animals were sacrificed at approximately 4 months of age for anatomy studies and at approximately 8 months of age for behavior studies.\n\nViral production and injection\nAAV-Cre was produced at the Salk Institute Viral Vector Core as described previously (\nGeoffroy et al., 2015\n;\nLiu et al., 2010\n). Viral concentration titer was determined to be 0.5 \u00d7 1012 TU/ml via qPCR. Virus was delivered via a modified 10 \u03bcL Hamilton syringe attached to a fine glass pipette mounted on a stereotaxic device for cortical injection. 5 week old animals were anesthetized with 2.5% Avertin (Sigma) and a total of 1.2 \u03bcL of AAV-Cre was injected into the sensorimotor cortex at 3 sites (0.4 \u03bcL per site). The right sensorimotor cortex targeting the left forelimb was injected 0.7 mm below the cortical surface at the following coordinates relative to bregma: 0.5 mm anterior, 1.2 mm lateral; 0.3 mm posterior, 1.2 mm lateral; and 0.1 mm anterior, 2.2 mm lateral.\n\nQuantification of sprouting index and percent midline crossing axons\nTo determine the sprouting index and percent midline crossing axons, transverse spinal cord sections were taken from C5-C7 cervical levels and imaged for BDA and tdTomato (see Tissue Processing). Lines were drawn parallel to the midline dorsoventral axis at 50 and 100 microns from the midline, then every 100 microns laterally in the denervated gray matter. The number of axons crossing each line was manually counted in five randomly chosen sections per animal by a blinded observer. Counts were averaged for each animal and normalized against the total labeled CST axon count in medulla (\nLee et al., 2010\n) to obtain the sprouting index and percent midline crossing axons, which was plotted as a function of distance from the midline. Numbers of mice for each experiment are as follows: oligodendrocyte-specific Nogo knockout mice with pyramidotomy (\nFigure 3\n): n=8 Nogo\nf/f\n;no Cre mice and n=12 Nogo\nf/f\n;PLPCreER\nT\nmice (with 1 additional Nogo\nf/f\n;PLPCreER\nT\nmouse excluded from analysis due to incomplete pyramidotomy as described above under \u201cTissue processing\u201d); oligodendrocyte-specific Nogo knockout mice without injury (\nFigure 5\n): n=3 Nogo\nf/f\n;no Cre mice and n=3 Nogo\nf/f\n;PLPCreER\nT\nmice; AAV-Cre mediated, cortical neuronal deletion of Nogo with pyramidotomy (\nFigure 9\n): n=5 Nogo\n+/f\ncontrol mice and n=7 Nogo\nf/f\nmice.\nFigure 3.

For both staircase reaching and pasta handling tests, mice were deprived of food at approximately 5pm and tested at approximately 9am the following morning resulting in approximately 16 hours food deprivation. Animals were weighed weekly to monitor for excessive weight loss (greater than 10%). For staircase reaching, mice were pre-trained and tested as described previously with slight modifications (\nBaird et al., 2001\n;\nKloth et al., 2006\n;\nStarkey et al., 2005\n). For habituation prior to pre-training, animals were exposed to dyed sucrose pellets (Fisher Scientific Dustless Precision Pellets 14 mg, dyed with AmeriColor Student Soft Gel Paste Food Color) in their home cages and habituated to the testing environment, experimenter, and staircase chambers (Campden Instruments) for approximately 10 minutes per day for 3 days. Staircase chambers were modified to prevent build up of displaced pellets on lower steps by removing a plastic barrier at the base of the staircase and by adding a plastic barrier between the staircase chamber and the main chamber. During pre-training, animals were placed in sucrose-pellet baited chambers for 10 minutes once daily for 4\u20135 days per week until performance plateau, for a total of approximately 25 sessions. For all pre-training and testing sessions, staircases were baited with 4 pellets on each step other than the top two steps to prevent usage of the tongue to retrieve pellets. Initial pre-training sessions were baited with additional pellets on the top steps and the central platform to encourage exploration and pellet retrieval. Throughout pre-training and testing, performance was monitored to ensure pellets were retrieved with forepaws and not tongues. After pre-training, animals were tested once every 7 days on day 3, 10, 17, etc. after pyramidotomy (n=12 Nogo\nf/f\n;PLPCreER\nT\n, Nogo\nf/f\nmice and n=16 Nogo\nf/f\n;PLPCreER\nT\nmice). Test sessions were 10 minutes, after which the number and location of remaining pellets was recorded to calculate pellets eaten (successful retrievals) and pellets eaten relative to pellets displaced (success rate). For pasta handling, mice were tested as described previously (\nTennant et al., 2010\n). Briefly, mice were video-recorded while eating a 2.5 cm piece of dry capellini pasta and the number of adjustments made with each paw was quantified by watching frame-by-frame video playback (n=7 Nogo\nf/f\n;no Cre mice and n=5 Nogo\nf/f\n;PLPCreER\nT\nmice). Adjustments consisted of paw release and re-contact with the pasta or any movement of the paw or digits while in contact with the pasta as described previously (\nTennant et al., 2010\n). Mice were habituated to the testing setup for 2 sessions prior to testing. Pasta handling testing occurred 10 weeks after pyramidotomy after the conclusion of staircase testing.\n\nExperimental design and statistical analysis\nWestern blot data were analyzed via one-way ANOVA. Sprouting index, percent midline crossing axons, staircase reaching, pasta handling and Nogo-A immunofluorescence data were analyzed via two way repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni or Fisher post-tests as indicated. VGLUT1 expression data was analyzed via unpaired t-test. For all statistical analyses, GraphPad Prism 7 was used with p < 0.05 set as the threshold for statistically significance, denoted by asterisks in graphs. All data is displayed as means with error bars denoting SEM. Specific n values for each study are listed in figure legends. For analysis of sprouting index and percent midline crossing axons, five cervical sections and two medulla sections were quantified for each animal (see Quantification of sprouting index and percent midline crossing axons for specifi cdetails). A mix of male and female mice in an approximately 1:1 ratio was used for all experiments."

Human brain tissue samples and diagnoses criteria\nHuman brain tissue samples used in this study were obtained from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute Brain and Body Donation Program (\nBeach et al., 2008\n,\n2015\n). The operations of the Brain and Body Donation Program have been reviewed by an Institutional Review Board (Western IRB, Puyallup, WA).

Each brain region was ranked on a scale of 0\u20133. By combining the measures across these 5 brain regions, assessment of AD pathology was ranked on a non-parametric scale of 0\u201315 for plaques and tangles (\nDugger et al., 2012\n). Two sets of cases were subdivided into nondemented low plaque (ND-LP)(plaque score < 6), non-demented high plaque (NDHP)(plaque score 6\u201312) and AD (plaque score > 12), while the third set was considered as ND (plaque scores < 5) and AD (plaque score > 12). Conventional consensus clinical and neuropathological criteria (e.g. Braak staging) were also used to diagnose AD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) in these cases (\nMcKeith et al., 2005\n;\nNewell et al., 1999\n).\nTissue taken from the right hemisphere of each brain donor at autopsy was frozen on dry ice in 1 cm thick coronal slices, while 1 cm thick coronal slices from the left hemisphere were fixed for 2 days in formaldehyde followed by cryoprotection in phosphate buffered glycol/glycerol. Frozen brain slices were stored at \u221270 to \u221280oC, and retrieved for dissection when samples were required for biochemical studies.\nApolipoprotein E (apoE) genotypes were determined for all cases using a PCR restriction fragment polymorphism technique employing DNA extracted from cerebellum (\nHixson and Vernier, 1990\n).\n\n2.2. Immunohistochemistry\nFormaldehyde-fixed tissue sections from middle temporal gyrus were used for cellular localization of TLR-3 alone, or with A\u03b2; microglia markers HLA-DR, Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule (IBA-1) and CD68; astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); vascular endothelial marker CD31, neuronal marker NeuN and the autophagy associated receptor p62 according to our previously published procedures (\nWalker et al, 2009\n;\n2015\n). Antibodies used in this study for immunohistochemistry and western blots are listed in\nTable 2\n. To detect TLR-3 immunoreactivity in fixed tissue sections, antigen retrieval pretreatment was necessary. Each section was heated at 80oC for 30 minutes in 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) followed by cooling to room temperature. This antigen retrieval method did not affect the performance of the other antibodies used for double immunohistochemistry. Localization of bound antibody was visualized using avidin-biotinhorseradish peroxidase enzyme complex (ABC-Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) histochemistry and nickel ammonium sulfate-enhanced diaminobenzidine (DAB) as substrate to produce a purple reaction product. The second round of histochemistry was carried out using various antibodies. For dual-color immunohistochemistry, binding of the second antibody was detected using the same procedure, but with DAB without nickel ammonium sulfate for substrate to produce a brown reaction product (\nWalker et al., 2009\n;\nWalker et al., 2015\n). Multi-color laser confocal microscopy was used in a limited number of cases to validate antigen localization. Sections were incubated overnight in antibodies, washed 3 times and incubated with mixtures of fluorescent-labelled secondary antibodies at 1:500 dilution. Antibodies were labeled with Alexa 488 (donkey anti goat IgG), Alexa 568 (donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG) and Alexa 647 (donkey anti mouse IgG). After washing, sections were mounted and counterstained with 1% Sudan black (in 70% ethanol) to block autofluorescence. Sections were examined using Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope and images output using system software.\nTable 2:\nDetails of Antibodies Used\nAntigen\nAntibody\nSupplier\nSpecies/Type\nApplication\nDilution\nTLR-3\nAF1847\nR&D Systems\nGoat/poly\nIHC/WB/IP\n2 \u03bcg \u2013 0.1\n\u03bcg/ul\nTLR-3\nMAB1847\nR&D Systems\nMouse/mono\nWB\n*\n1 \u03bcg/ml\nTLR-3\nab62566\nAbcam\nRabbit/poly\nIHC\n*\n/WB\n*\n1:2000\nTLR-3\nab84991\nAbcam\nRabbit/poly\nWB\n*\n1:1000\nTLR-3\nPA5\u201323510\nThermoFisher\nRabbit/poly\nWB*\n1:500\nTLR-3\nMABF72\nEMD/Millipore\nMouse/mono\nIHC\n*\n1:50\nA\u03b2\n6E10\nBiolegend\nMouse/mono\nIHC/WB\n1:2000\nGFAP\n556330\nBD\nBiosciences\nMouse/mono\nIHC\n1:750\nHLA-DR\nab166777\nAbcam\nMouse/mono\nIHC\n1:750\nIBA\n019\u201319741\nWako\nRabbit/poly\nIHC\n1:1000\nCD31\nM0823\nAgilent\nMouse/mono\nIHC\n1:1000\nNeuN\n834501\nBiolegend\nMouse/mono\nIHC\n1:1000\np62\nMAB8028\nR&D Systems\nMouse/mono\nIHC\n1:2000\nCD68\n916104\nBiolegend\nMouse/mono\nIHC\n1:1000\n\u03b2 actin\nab49900\nAbcam\nMouse/mono-\nHRP\nWB\n1:20000\nOpen in a new tab\n*\nIndicate unsatisfactory results\nTo confirm specificity of immunostaining, protein absorption of the goat polyclonal TLR-3 antibody was carried by mixing pre-diluted antibody with excess of recombinant TLR3 protein (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 18 hours prior to incubation of antibody/protein mixture on tissue sections. As a control, aliquots of diluted antibody without added TLR-3 protein were processed in parallel prior to use in immunohistochemistry.\n\n2.3. Measurement of area occupied of TLR-3 immunoreactivity\nMatched sections from each case from series A (ND-LP, ND-HP, and AD) were subjected to single color immunohistochemistry for TLR-3. For each stained section, 4 nonoverlapping fields were imaged at 4-times magnification to incorporate all cortical layers within a single field for each section. These images were quantified for area of immunoreactivity of TLR-3 using Image J analysis program (\nhttps://imagej.net/ImageJ\n). The mean area value for immunoreactivity in each section was calculated, and then these values were combined into the respective disease groups for statistical analysis.\n\n2.4. Western Immunoblot and Immunoprecipitation Analyses\nDetergent soluble extracts were prepared from brain tissues or cells by sonication in 5 volumes (weight to volume) of RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Total protein concentration of each sample was determined using a Micro BCA assay kit with bovine serum albumin as standard.\nTo assess the specificity of the TLR-3 antibodies (\nTable 2\n), protein extracts of human brain samples or transfected HEK cells were analyzed by standard western blot methodology with chemiluminescence detection (\nWalker et al., 2015\n). Immunoprecipitation was carried out using protein G-conjugated magnetic beads (G-Biosciences, St. Louis, MO) conjugated with goat polyclonal antibody to TLR-3 (2 \u03bcg antibody/5 \u03bcl of beads). RIPAextracted brain or transfected cell extracts were reacted with TLR-3 antibody-conjugated beads for 2 hours, washed according the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and eluted into gel sample buffer. Samples were separated by western blot procedures and probed with alternate TLR-3 antibodies.\n\n2.5. Cell Culture Methods\nHuman autopsy brain microglia were isolated from frontal cortex according to our standard protocols (\nWalker et al., 2009\n; 2015a; 2015b). After isolation, microglia were cultured for 10\u201314 days prior to use in experiments. Microglia isolated from 8 separate cases were used in this study. We also isolated human brain endothelial cells (HBEC) from digested brain material by selection with\nUlex Europaeus\n(UEA)-conjugated magnetic Dynabeads (Life Technologies). HBEC were cultured for 14\u201321 days using EGM-2 Endothelial Cell media (Lonza, Gaithersburg, MD) with the inclusion of puromycin (5 \u03bcg/ml) in the media for the first 2 days of culture to inhibit other cell types (\nCalabria et al., 2006\n). Microglia or HBEC were treated with preformed fibrils/oligomers of A\u03b2(1\u2013 42) (California Peptide Company, Napa, CA) that had been aggregated according to our published procedure (\nWalker et al., 2006\n), or with different concentrations of poly I:C (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).\nA modification to the above procedure was carried out when the aim of the experiment was to determine if poly I:C treatment modulated the stimulating effects of A\u03b2 treatment or modulated the phagocytosis and breakdown of A\u03b2. For these experiments, microglia or HBEC cells were treated with poly I:C (2 \u03bcg/ml) for 1 hr before addition of indicated doses of A\u03b2. For experiments whose aims were to measure intracellular levels of A\u03b2, at the end of the treatment period, microglia were rinsed with PBS and then treated for 5 min with 0.01% trypsin solution to remove surface bound A\u03b2. Cultures were then rinsed twice with PBS prior to lysis in RIPA buffer. These materials were used for western blot analyses. ELISA for CCL2/MCP-1 were carried out on microglial-conditioned media using reagent from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nAn\nin vitro\nblood brain barrier (BBB) cell model was employed using HBEC to test effects of poly I:C For this model, HBEC were plated at 50,000 cell/wells onto Cellagen collagen disc (MPBio, Santa Ana, CA) inserts using EGM2 endothelial cell media. Each insert was placed into a well of a 24-well plate containing 300 \u03bcl of media under the insert and 100 \u03bcl of media in the insert. The development of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured using EndOhm chamber with EVOM resistance meter device (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). After 4\u20135 days, after high TEER had been obtained, treatments were added to media in the inserts. For all cell experiments, treatments were carried out for 24 hours.\nTransient and stably-transfected HEK 293 cells were prepared using a TLR-3 expression or control plasmid (Genecopoeia, Gaithersburg, MD). The TLR-3 expression plasmid (Genecopoeia # EX-I3713-M02 in pReceiver-M02 vector), or control GFP plasmid were transfected into HEK cells for 48\u201372 hours with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, or stably transformed TLR-3 expressing colonies were selected using G418. These materials were used in western blot and immunoprecipitation experiments to characterize the TLR-3 antibodies.\n\n2.6. RNA isolation and Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of mRNA expression.\nRNA was prepared from human brain tissue samples and cultured cells (human microglia and brain endothelial cells) using RNAeasy Plus Mini kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, with RNA integrity being measured with an Agilent Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 Nano kits (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Samples used for qPCR had RIN values greater than 7.0. RNA from brain samples (0.5 \u03bcg) and cultured cell samples (0.2 \u03bcg) were reverse transcribed using the Quantitect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). Appropriate numbers of no reverse transcriptase controls were prepared in parallel for each batch of samples. For qPCR, cDNA samples were amplified using Perfecta Fast Mix 2x reaction mixture (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 1.25\u03bcM of Eva Green. The primers used for gene expression analyses in this project are listed in\nTable 3\n. QPCR was carried out using a Stratagene Mx3000p machine and abundance of gene expression quantified relative to a standard curve. All PCR values were normalized against values for \u03b2-actin mRNA expression (\nWalker et al., 2009\n;\nWalker et al., 2015\n). QPCR analyses followed most of the recommended criteria for Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiment (MIQE) (\nBustin et al., 2009\n).\nTable 3:\nSequences of PCR primers used for Real Time PCR analyses\nGene\nSequence\nAmplicon\n(bp)\nRef.

    "Methods": "2.1. Chemicals\nRotenone (RO) was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China). Paraquat (Methyl viologen dichloride hydrate, PQ) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemicals Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Other chemicals were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade.\n\n2.2. C. elegans strains\nAll strains of\nC. elegans\nwere obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and maintained following standard protocols as previously described (\nSulston and Brenner, 1974\n). Transgenic strains of\nC. elegans\nused in this study include the following:\nBZ555 [dat-1p::GFP\n] (\nJadiya et al., 2011\n);\nPD4251 [(pSAK2) myo-3p::GFP::LacZ::NLS + (pSAK4) myo-3p::mitochondrial GFP + dpy-20\n(+)] (\nCao et al., 2007\n);\nCB7272\n[[(pSAK2)\nmyo-3p::GFP::LacZ::NLS\n+ (pSAK4)\nmyo-3p::mitochondrial\nGFP + dpy-20(+)] I. mIs12 [\nmyo-2p::GFP\n+\npes-10p::GFP\n+\nF22B7.9p::GFP\n] II. frIs7 [\nnlp-29p::GFP\n+\ncol-12p::DsRed\n] IV. uIs69 [\npCFJ90(myo-2p::mCherry\n) +\nunc-119p::sid-1\n] V] (\nThompson et al., 2013\n);\nDLM14 [eft-3p::CERUL-EAN-VENUS::tomm-7\n+\nunc-119\n(+)] (\nChapin et al., 2015\n);\nLA62 [hop-1mt\n] (\nLakowski et al., 2003\n);\nBR4006 [pink-1p::pink-1::GFP\n+\nmyo-2p::mCherry\n+ herring sperm DNA] (\nS\u00e4mann et al., 2009\n) and\nRB2547 [pink-1 (ok3538)]\n.\n\n2.3. Nematode maintenance and exposure\nNematodes were maintained on nematode growth medium (NGM) plates seeded with\nEscherichia coli OP50\nat 20 \u00b0C (\nSulston and Brenner, 1974\n). Adult nematodes were collected into tubes, and then dissolved a bleach-containing buffer (0.45 mM NaOH, 2% HClO) to release eggs. The eggs were collected and hatched on the plates with food, then synchronized for experiments (\nXu et al., 2016\n).\nRotenone was initially dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted with K-medium (32 mM KCl, 51 mM NaCl). PQ solutions were prepared in K-medium. The control group was K-medium. According to results of lethality assays, sublethal concentrations of RO (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 10.0 \u03bcM) or PQ (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6 mM) were used for further research. Nematodes were exposed in the 24-well plates. Each well contained 30\u201350 age-synchronized nematodes and 45 \u03bcL\nE. coli OP50\nsolutions for food. Each experimental group included four parallels. L2 stage nematodes were exposed for 3 days.\n\n2.4. Lethality assays\nSynchronized wild type or transgenic nematodes were exposed to RO or PQ for 6 days in 24-well plates. To prevent eggs from hatching, 3.3 \u03bcL of fluoro-29-deoxyuridine (150 mM) was added to each well. The numbers of dead nematodes were recorded every day. Dead nematodes were identified as unresponsive to a gentle prod of the body with a needle probe. Each experiment was run in quadruplicate. The median lethal concentrations (LC50) of RO and PQ were determined by linear regression analysis with Graphpad Prism (\nXu et al., 2017\n).\n\n2.5. Movement behavior\nBody bending was utilized to evaluate locomotion behaviors of nematodes. After the exposure, nematodes were transferred to K-medium. After one minute of recovery, body bending was counted in 20s. Additionally,\nC. elegans\nwas transferred to surface of fresh NGM after exposure experiments. Following 10 min of adaptation, videos of nematodes were recorded for 1 min using the Motic microscope and Images Advanced 3.2 software (Motic Electric Group, Xiamen, China). Locomotion videos were further analyzed by Wormlab software (MBF Bioscience, Hong Kong, China). The crawling tracks were calculated using the midpoint of the body of nematodes in terms of references (\nDonnelly et al., 2013\n). Crawling speeds were recorded in real-time using a bin width of 0.125 s.\n\n2.6. Dopaminergic degeneration analysis\nIn the\nBZ555\nstrain of\nC. elegans,\nthe dopamine transporter marker\ndat-1::gfp\nwas expressed in neurons; therefore, bright green fluorescence proteins (GFP) was observable in dopamine neurons (\nXu et al., 2017\n;\nJadiya et al., 2011\n). After exposure, worms were transferred to agar-padded slides. After anesthesia with 100 mM sodium azide, worms were sealed with coverslips. Images of immobilized worms were captured to assay dopamine neurons by a fluorescence microscope (LEICA DM400 B, Leica Microsystems Company, Shanghai, China). Fluorescence intensity of GFP was quantified through Image-Pro Plus software. The intensities of fluorescent puncta for dopaminergic neurons were examined in at least 30 nematodes in each group (\nLi et al., 2016\n).\n\n2.7. Fluorescentfy-labeled mitochondria observation\nIn the strain of PD4251 nematode, GFP is expressed with\nmyo-3p::gfp\nin all cells of body wall and vulval muscles (\nCao et al., 2007\n). After exposure, worms were transferred to agar-padded slides. Imaging of immobilized nematodes was performed by a fluorescence microscope. The intensities of fluorescent punctum for mitochondria were examined in each group (>30 nematodes).\n\n2.8. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) measurement\nATP content was measured as previously described (\nWang et al., 2007\n;\nZuryn et al., 2010\n). In brief, 100 age-matched animals in each group were collected in S-Basal buffer and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. Frozen worms were immersed in hot water for 15 min, cooled and centrifuged to pellet insoluble debris. The supernatant was moved to a fresh tube and diluted fivefold before measurement. All three replicates were assayed using an ATP assay kit HS II (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Luminescence was detected with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4500). Using an enhanced BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China), the protein value was measured at 562 nm with Multiscan MK3 (Bio-Rad, Finland). ATP levels were normalized to total protein content.\n\n2.9. Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential\nAccording to previously described (\nWang et al., 2008\n;\nYee et al., 2014\n), nematodes were collected and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. Frozen worms were immersed in hot water, cooled and centrifuged to pellet insoluble debris. According to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, three replicates were assayed using a mitochondrial membrane potential assay kit with JC-1 (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). Suspension was incubated with JC-1 for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, rinsed twice with PBS, and then detected with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4500). Mitochondrial membrane potential was determined through the ratio of red/green fluorescence intensity.\n\n2.10. Assay for TOM7 and inner membrane complex in mitochondria\nMitochondrial import receptor subunit TOM7 homolog is encoded by the gene of\ntomm-7\n. In the strain of DLM14 nematodes,\neft-3p::CERULEAN-VENUS::tomm-7\nis expressed as fusion proteins, so the intensity of GFP can indicate the expression of TOM7, a key outer membrane protein in mitochondria (\nChapin et al., 2015\n). In another strain of CB7272, GFP is expressed along with Complex I (\nccIs4251\n), Complex II (\nmIs12\n) and Complex III (\ndpy-17\n) in body wall and pharyngeal muscle, while red fluorescence proteins (RFP) is marked as the fusion with Complex IV (\nfrIs7\n) and Complex V (\nuIs69\n) in epidermis and pharyngeal muscle. Therefore, inner membrane complex I, II, III, IV, IV can be simultaneously assayed basing on the intensity of GFP or RFP. Fluorescence images of nematodes after exposure were performed by a fluorescence microscope. The intensities of fluorescent punctum associated with mitochondrial membrane related proteins were analyzed.\n\n2.11. Assay for the expression level of pink-1\nIn the transgenic strain of\nBR4006, pink-1::GFP\nis expressed in all cells of nematodes. After exposure, the expression level of\npink-1\ncan be assayed by fluorescence intensity of GFP by using a fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence intensity of GFP was quantified through Image-Pro Plus software. Therefore, the expression level of\npink-1\nwas examined in each group (> 30 nematodes).\n\n2.12. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nThe synchronized worms of wild type, LA62 [\nhop-1\n(\nmt\n)] and RB2547 [\npink-1(ok3538\n)] were respectively exposed to 2.0 \u03bcM RO, 0.8 mM PQ, or the vehicle K-medium (as the control) for 3 days. After exposure, approximately 150 survival nematodes were randomly selected for ultrastructural observation in each group with three independent experiments. In brief, these nematodes were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 M phosphate buffered saline. Nematodes were dehydrated in a graded series of acetone (30\u2013100%) and embedded in epoxy resin in term of a standard procedure (\nPrasad and Verma, 2013\n). Thin tissue sections were collected on copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed by FEI T12 transmission electron microscopy (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., USA). In a total of nine groups, MAM ultrastructure including mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum were observed and compared among different exposure groups of the same strain. The vacuolar area and cristae length were measured manually in each mitochondrion. The percentages of vacuolar area in mitochondria were calculated, and compared among different groups. The density of mitochondrial cristae was calculated as the ratio of a total of cristae length to mitochondrial area in each mitochondria. Besides, we counted the percentage of mitochondria with mitophagy vesicles in total mitochondria. At least 30 mitochondria were measured in each exposed group.\n\n2.13. Statistical analysis\nAll data were expressed as mean \u00b1 Standard Error of the mean (SEM). Histograms were generated using SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc.). Differences between groups were determined in term of results of a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc.). Probability levels (\np\n-value) of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant."

Docking models were generated using iGEM dock.\n\nCompounds-\nMLi2 and PF-360 were synthesized in-house. Novel synthetic pathways are provided in\nSupplemental Files 1\nand\n2\n. Medicated chows were formulated at Research Diets.\n\nAnimals\u2014\nAll animal protocols were approved by local Animal Care and Use Committees accredited by the AAALAC. Both male and female rodents, aged 8\u201312 weeks were used in this study. All rodents were housed on a 12 h light/dark cycle and given free access to food and water. Consumption of chow was monitored daily and body weight regularly measured. G2019S-LRRK2 human BAC rats (Sprague-Dawley, Taconic), LRRK2 knockout rats (Long-Evans, Sage), and G2019S-LRRK2 knock-in mice (C57Bl6, Taconic), as well as non-transgenic littermates were used in this study. Approximately equal numbers of males and females compose all experiments and observations.\n\nPharmacokinetics-\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (n=3 for all observations) were used with IV doses at 3 mg kg\n\u22121\n, with blood sampling at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. PO dose was at 5 mg kg\n\u22121\nwith blood sampling at 15 min, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hr. No clinical symptoms were observed during the experiments. Samples were analyzed by HPLC. Microsomes were prepared from macaque liver and included, with or without NADPH, at 0.5 mg mL\n\u22121\n(w/v). The final concentrations of test compounds in microsome stability assays were 2 \u03bcM.\n\nMass spectrometry-\nCompound standards included 50% acetonitrile in water with known concentrations of compound (1\u201310,000 ng mL\n\u22121\n) combined with plasma (mouse or rat) obtained on the same day of analysis. Standards and experimental solutions were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems Sciex Triple Quad 5500, with online LC-30AD and Phenomenex Synergi 2.5 um Polar-RP 3\u00d750 mm columns. Mobile phase included 5% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% Formic acid, and a solution of 95% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% formic acid.\n\nTissue and cell lysates-\nRat and mouse tissue was collected following transcardiac perfusion of cold PBS. Tissues were homogenized by sonication in a RIPA lysis buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris (pH7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS supplemented with 1x protease inhibitors (Fisher) and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). Whole blood was collected into K2EDTA tubes (BD), diluted with equal amounts of PBS, and transferred to SepMate-50 tubes (StemCell) filled with 15 mL lymphocyte separation media (Corning). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated by centrifugation at 1200 xg for 15 min at room temperature. PBMCs were collected and washed twice with PBS before pelleted at 500 xg and lysis. Primary macrophages were obtained by intraperitoneal injection of 2 mL of thioglycollate broth (Sigma), and three days later harvesting cells by washing in the peritoneal cavity. Cells were cultured in DMEM media (Sigma) supplemented with 2 mM Glutamine (Sigma) and 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) and 10 ng mL\n\u22121\nGM-CSF (Peprotech). Cells were processed into RIPA buffer as described above. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA assay (Pierce). All lysates were further diluted 1:1 in 2x Laemelli buffer supplemented with 40 mM NaF and 10% DTT.\n\nWestern blots and antibodies\u2014\nProtein lysates were electrophoresed on a 7.5% Mini-Protean TGX stain- free gel (BioRad) and then transferred onto Immobilon-FL membranes (Millipore) and blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LiCOR). Membranes were cut in half below the high-molecular weight markers. Primary antibodies included mouse anti-LRRK2 clone N241A/34 (1: 2000, Antibodies, Inc.), rabbit anti-LRRK2 antibody MJFF2 (1:2000, Abcam), Ser(P)-935 (1: 2000, Abcam), Ser(P)-1292 (1:2000, Abcam) HSPA8 (1:5000, Cell Signaling), phospho-T73-Rab10 antibody (1:1000, MJF-R21, Abcam), and total Rab10 (1:1000, clone D36C4, Cell Signaling). Secondary antibodies were IRdye 680LT donkey anti-mouse and IRdye 800CW donkey anti-rabbit (both 1:10000, LiCOR). Membranes were scanned using a LiCOR CLx with 685-nm and 785-nm lasers and band intensities were quantified using the LiCOR-Odyssey system.\n\nProtein Capillary Electrophoresis and antibodies-\nProtein lysates were combined with High and Low Molecular weight protein kits (ProteinSimple). Samples were prepared and analyzed following the manufacturer protocol. Diluted lysates were mixed with 5x fluorescent master mix and loaded with blocking reagent, primary and secondary antibodies, chemiluminescent substrate, and wash buffer. The microplate was then loaded into the Wes instrument (ProteinSimple) with separation and immunodetection performed automatically using default hardware and software settings. Data were analyzed using Compass SW software. Primary antibodies were as above except for HSPA8 which was substituted for mouse anti-HSPA8 (StressMarq).\n\nKidney and Lung analysis-\nKidneys were collected following transcardiac perfusion with cold PBS. Lungs were inflated prior to fixing in 70% alcoholic formalin overnight. The lungs were then transferred to a tissue cassette add submerged in 10% formalin until they were paraffin embedded. Kidneys were dissected into medial sections comprised of cortex and medulla and tissue placed in a cassette in formalin overnight then transferred to 70% ethanol. Lung and kidney sections were cut at 5 \u03bcm with a cryostat and processed with Haemotoxylin and Eosin dyes. For autofluorescence analysis, kidneys were perfused with 1x PBS, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 2 hrs at 4\u00b0C, and then soaked in 20% sucrose solution until floating. 5 \u03bcm thick sections were mounted to slides with Vectashield HardSet Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Some sections were treated with Sudan Black B dye (EMD Millipore) per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Images were obtained using a 488-line laser and 500\u2013550 nm emission and signals analyzed with Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence (LAS AF) software."

    "Methods": "The Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh approved the protocol and animal use in this study.\n\n2.1. Surgical procedures\nA total of 11 cats (4 male and 7 female, 2.9\u20134.1 kg; Liberty Research, Waverly, NY) were used. The animals were anesthetized initially with isoflurane (2\u20135% in oxygen) during surgery and then switched to \u03b1-chloralose anesthesia (initial dose 65 mg/kg i.v. followed by supplemental doses as needed) during data collection. The left cephalic vein was catheterized for intravenous administration of fluid and drug. A midline anterior cervical incision was used to access the airway, which was kept patent via tracheostomy. The right carotid artery was catheterized for monitoring arterial blood pressure. Oxygen saturation and heart rate were measured via a pulse oximeter (9847VNONIN Medical, Plymouth, MN) attached to the tongue. A midline laparotomy was performed and the ureters were transected, ligated, and then drained externally. A single-lumen urethral catheter (2.3 mm inner diameter) was inserted into the bladder via a small anterior urethrotomy and fixed in place by a suture around the urethra. The single-lumen catheter was attached to a T-adapter to allow for simultaneous bladder pressure recording via a pressure transducer and bladder distention via a saline reservoir. Bladder pressure was maintained at a constant level by adjusting the height of the saline reservoir connected to the urethral catheter. Small incisions were made in the right sciatic notch lateral to the tail and on the medial side of the left hindlimb above the ankle to expose the right pudendal nerve and left tibial nerve, respectively. A tripolar cuff electrode (NC223pt, Microprobes, Gaithersburg, MD) was placed around each intact nerve and connected to a stimulator (S88; Grass Medical Instruments, Quincy, MA). All incisions were then closed by sutures.\nThe spinal cord and cauda equina were then exposed between the L5 and S3 vertebrae via a dorsal laminectomy. The spinal dura was cut and the S2 spinal cord was exposed. The animal was mounted in a modified Narishige spinal frame in which the hip was supported by metal pins, and the spinous process at the rostral end of the laminectomy was supported by a clamp. The skin, which had been cut posteriorly from L4 to S3 was tied along the margin to form a pool that was filled with warm (35\u201337 \u00b0C) mineral oil.\n\n2.2. Searching for bladder-related neurons in S2 spinal cord\nThis study focused on the identification of bladder-related neurons in S2 spinal cord because previous tracing studies showed that S2 spinal cord is a major spinal segment for bladder afferent projections (\nMorgan et al. 1981\n). A tungsten microelectrode (WE50030.5A10, 0.5 M\u03a9, Microprobes, Gaithersburg, MD) attached to a microelectrode driver was lowered to the dorsal surface of the spinal cord on the right side in the middle of the S2 spinal cord segment along the dorsal root entry zone. With bladder pressure maintained at a constant pressure of 40 cmH\n2\nO by setting the height of the saline reservoir, the microelectrode was slowly advanced in 5 \u03bcm steps into the spinal cord. At each electrode location, neuron activity amplified 20,000 times by an amplifier (P511, Grass Instruments, MA) was displayed on an oscilloscope and sent to an audio monitor. When single neuron firing was detected, the bladder pressure was lowered to 0 cmH\n2\nO to assess the contribution of bladder afferent input to the neuron activity. If the neuron stopped firing at 0 cmH\n2\nO bladder pressure, the microelectrode was kept in place to further investigate PNS or TNS effects on the activity. Otherwise, the microelectrode was advanced further into the cord. The microelectrode was withdrawn once it reached 2 mm depth before entering the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Then, the microelectrode was moved 0.5\u20131 mm rostral/caudal or medio/lateral to a new location on the spinal cord surface to repeat the search procedure until a bladder-related neuron was identified.\n\n2.3. Stimulation protocol and drug administration\nUniphasic rectangular pulses (5-Hz frequency, 0.2-ms pulse width), which have previously been shown to be effective in inhibiting bladder activity (\nLarson et al. 2011\n;\nTai et al. 2012\n), were delivered to the tibial or pudendal nerve. The intensity threshold (T) for inducing toe or anal sphincter twitch was determined at the beginning of the experiment. Based on our prior studies, stimulation intensity of 2 T was used for PNS or TNS of short duration (about 3 min) to acutely suppress bladder-related neuron activity during the stimulation (\nFuller et al. 2017\n;\nUy et al. 2017\n), while 4 T was used for prolonged (30-min duration) TNS to produce a post-stimulation inhibitory effect (\nTai et al. 2011b\n).\nTable 1\nshows the sequence of different tests as described below in detail. When a bladder neuron was identified, the single unit activity was sampled at 20 kHz by an analog-to-digital converter (PCI-6024E, National Instruments, TX) and saved in a computer running the Lab-VIEW program (National Instruments, TX). Initially, the pressure response was determined by recording the activity at a range of bladder pressures (10, 20, 30, or 40 cmH\n2\nO) for 20\u201330 s with a 20\u201330 s interval of 0 cmH\n2\nO pressure between each pressure increase. To evaluate the effect of PNS on neuron activity (\nN\n= 13 neurons), the pressure response test was repeated under the following conditions: 1) control without PNS; 2) during 2 T PNS; 3) control after PNS. The same test was then performed using TNS (\nN\n= 10 neurons). Following the PNS and TNS tests, the effect of peri-genital stimulation (PGS) on neuron activity was determined at 10 and 30 cmH\n2\nO bladder pressures first without PGS (control) then during PGS (\nN\n= 6 neurons). PGS was applied by repeatedly stroking (3\u20135 times per second) the genital area with a cotton swab to determine if physiological stimulation of a population of mechanosensitive cutaneous afferents in the pudendal nerve can mimic the effect of electrical stimulation of the whole pudendal nerve.\nTable 1.\nThe sequence of different tests.\nOrder\nTest\n1\nBladder neuron identified\n2\nPudendal nerve stimulation\n3\nTibial nerve stimulation (TNS)\n4\nPeri-genital stimulation\n5\nPost-TNS effect\n6\nNaloxone treatment\nOpen in a new tab\nAfter testing the acute effects of PNS/TNS/PGS during the stimulation, the post-stimulation inhibitory effect induced by prolonged (30-min duration) TNS as revealed in our previous studies (\nTai et al. 2011b\n) was investigated. The bladder pressure response (10\u201340 cmH\n2\nO) was first determined without any stimulation to serve as the control condition, and then followed by a period of 4 T TNS for 30 min with the bladder pressure at 0 cmH\n2\nO. Within 0.5\u20131.5 min after cessation of 30-min TNS, the bladder pressure response (10\u201340 cmH\n2\nO) was tested again to determine the post-stimulation inhibition. Then, at an interval of 1\u201311 min the bladder pressure was increased from 0 cmH\n2\nO to 40 cmH\n2\nO for 20 s to assess the recovery from the post-stimulation inhibition. Once the neuron activity at 40 cmH\n2\nO recovered to control level, the full pressure response test (10\u201340 cmH\n2\nO) was performed again.\nAt the end of the experiment, naloxone (1 mg/kg) was administered intravenously with the bladder pressure at 0 cmH\n2\nO. Five minutes after naloxone treatment, the acute effect of PNS (N = 6 neurons) or TNS (\nN\n= 7 neurons) on neuron activity was evaluated again using the bladder pressure response test.\n\n2.4. Histological identification of the microelectrode locations\nAfter conclusion of every experiment, the S2 segment of the spinal cord was excised and fixed in formalin (10%) for 3 days. The fixed tissue was then processed with 30% sucrose buffer, embedded in OTC compound, and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C for 24 h. Then, 30\u201340 \u03bcm thick sections were cut serially by a cryostat, stained with cresyl violet, and examined using light microscopy. In each cat there were only 1\u20135 microelectrode tracks distributed in 3 sections (rostral, middle, and/or caudal) of the S2 spinal segment, i.e. only 1\u20132 microelectrode tracks were identified in a single section. Most of the microelectrode tracks were identified in the histological sections by lesions made by the microelectrode insertion. Using an estimated 15% tissue shrinkage (\nTai et al. 2001\n), the recording location was determined based on the depth of the microelectrode tip where the single neuron activity was investigated. Then, the microelectrode locations in different animals were marked on a standard template of S2 spinal cord based on their relative distances to the landmarks of the spinal cord (dorsal surface, central canal, and lateral edge of the gray matter, etc.). Estimated microelectrode locations were then compared to the laminar organization of the cat sacral S2 spinal cord described by\nRexed (1954)\n.\n\n2.5. Data analysis\nDuring PNS or TNS, the stimulation artifacts of amplitude larger than the action potentials of the bladder neuron were identified by thresholding and then removed by a LabVIEW program together with the first 10\u201330 ms of recording following each stimulus which in some cases contained large amplitude field potentials and/or neuron activity from other neurons that were inactive prior to electrical stimulation. Then, the number of bladder-related neuron action potentials during the 20-s bladder distention at different pressures (10, 20, 30, or 40 cmH\n2\nO) was counted using the LabVIEW program by setting a new threshold level to distinguish the bladder neuron spikes from any low amplitude neuron spikes or baseline activity. To calculate the firing rate of bladder neuron spikes, a 1-s window was used to count the number of spikes and the results were displayed as pulses per second (pps) over time. The number of action potentials measured during each 20-s bladder distention at different pressures (10, 20, 30, or 40 cmH\n2\nO) and under different conditions (control, PNS, TNS, or PGS) were all normalized to the initial control measurement with the bladder distended at 40 cmH\n2\nO. The normalized data from different animals under the same conditions are presented as means \u00b1 SE. Statistical significance (\np\n< .05) was determined by linear regression analysis or ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparisons."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale transgenic mice carrying a G93A mutated\nhSOD1\ngene (B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1*G93A) 1Gur/J) and wild type (C57BL/6J) controls (initially obtained from Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were individually housed in clear polypropylene cages contained within environmental compartments with ambient temperature held at 22\u00b0C or 29\u00b0C and relative humidity at 40 \u00b1 20%. Food and water were provided\nad libitum\n, and animals were maintained in a 12 h: 12 h LD cycle, with light intensity on the order of 300 \u2013 400 lux at the mid-cage level. Locomotor activity was measured by passive infrared motion detectors (K-940, Visonic, Tel-Aviv, Israel) positioned on the top of the cages or by voluntary running in 5\u201d metal running wheels. Twice weekly, mice were weighed, tested for grip strength (as the maximum of 5 attempts using a Chatillon DFIS-2 Digital Force Gauge [Ametek, Inc., Berwyn, PA]), and given a neurological score according to the Jackson Laboratory criteria for onset and end stage of disease in G93A mice (\nLeitner et al., 2009\n); the endpoint of \u201cdeath\u201d was defined as an inability of the mouse to right itself within 15 seconds if laid on either side. At the conclusion of experiments, mice were euthanized using either ketamine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) or CO\n2\nasphyxiation, followed by decapitation. Mutant\nhSOD1\ncopy number was confirmed by PCR. All animal procedures were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) and Williams College.\n\nibutton implantation, long-term recordings, and indirect calorimetry (UMMS)\nibuttons (DS1922L-F5, Embedded Data Systems, Lawrenceburg, KY) were calibrated at temperatures between 25\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C and then programmed to sample temperature every 15 min beginning at a specified age. They were coated lightly with paraffin wax and sterilized in povidine iodine solution overnight followed by a sterile saline rinse. At 38 days of age, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (0.5\u20132.5%), given a subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg), and a single ibutton was placed within the peritoneal cavity via a 2 cm skin and abdominal wall incision 2 mm lateral to the midline. The wound was treated with antibiotic ointment (Neomycin & Polymyxin B Sulfates & Bacitracin Zinc Ointment USP), and subcutaneous buprenorphine at 6 h, and ketoprofen (5 mg/kg) at 6 h and 30 h, were administered post-operatively.\nLocomotor activity data were binned every 5 min and displayed as actograms by using the Vitalview and Activeview Programs (Philips Respironics, Bend, OR). T\nb\nactograms were created by plotting the values obtained after subtracting the mean for the entire experiment from each individual data point. The daily amplitudes of the rhythms were determined by transforming the raw data using the Morlet continuous wavelet transform, as described previously (\nLeise et al., 2013\n).\nAt 115 days of age, groups of G93A and control mice were placed in PhenoMaster/LabMaster metabolic cages (TSE Systems, Chesterfield, MO) using the National Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center (MMPC) at UMMS for non-invasive measurement of energy expenditure, food/water intake, and physical activity every 30 min over a 72 h interval.\n\nConstruction of Scholander plots (Williams College)\nTelemeters (ETAF20, Data Sciences International, St. Paul, MN), were calibrated at temperatures between 20\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C and sterilized in povidine iodine solution overnight followed by a sterile saline rinse. At 79 days of age, mice were anesthetized, and a single telemeter was placed within the peritoneal cavity, as described for ibutton implantation, above, except for analgesia by subcutaneous meloxicam (5 mg/kg) peri-operatively and 24 and 48 h post-operatively. ECG leads from the telemeter were placed subcutaneously on either side of the heart and sutured in place.\nFor indirect calorimetry, air (300 mL/min) was pumped into air-tight cages, and the outflow was fed through a flow meter (Omega Engineering, Stamford, CT) and pulled through O\n2\nand CO\n2\nanalyzers (AEI Technologies, Naperville, IL) at 140 mL/min, with excess flow redirected to a concentric, convoluted pathway for rerelease into the room environment. O2 and CO2 concentrations were sampled for 20 sec every 2 min; cage temperature and atmospheric pressure were recorded every 2 min. All air put into and pulled out of the cages was dried using calcium sulfate (Drierite; W.A. Hammond Drierite Co., Xenia, OH). The adjustment of ambient temperature in the insulated cages was achieved using a self-constructed temperature regulatory system consisting of copper coils of wire through which cooled antifreeze was pumped. Physiological data were collected from the telemeter\u2019s radio signal via a receiver plate placed underneath the cage (RPC-1, Data Sciences International), for 20 sec every 2 min. Locomotor activity was monitored by the change in signal strength coming from the telemeter as the mouse moved about its cage, and shivering was derived from the ECG signal.\nBefore transfer to the metabolic cages, mice were housed at an ambient temperature of 30\u00b0C for two weeks. Following 12 h of acclimation to the cages, data were acquired at the onset of the light phase and for the next 24 h; 1.5 h after the onset of the second light phase, ambient temperature was manually adjusted to drop 2\u20133\u00b0C. Every 1.5 h thereafter, ambient temperature was dropped an additional 2\u20133\u00b0C until the final 1.5 h of the light phase. Basal metabolic rate, lower critical temperature, and conductance (insulation) were calculated as previously described (see\nCannon and Nedergaard, 2011\n). Finally, the animals were returned to 30\u00b0C for at least two days before an acute cold stress was performed; this was initiated 1.5 h after the onset of the light phase by transfer to cages at 10\u00b0C, after which T\nb\n, heart rate, and activity were recorded every 2 min for 2 h.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were euthanized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) during the first half of the light phase of the LD cycle. Animals were perfused intracardially with heparinized (30 units/ml) 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were collected in 4% paraformaldehyde, post-fixed for 4 h and transferred to 20% sucrose at 4\u00b0C, after which 40 \u03bcm coronal sections were cut on a sliding microtome and collected in two series in cryoprotectant and stored at 4\u00b0C. Staining was carried out at room temperature, and all incubations and rinses (with PBS, pH 7.4, 5 min/rinse) involved gentle agitation. Free-floating sections containing the forebrain were washed in PBS, blocked for 20 min using 5% normal donkey serum (NDS, 017\u2013000-121, Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc., West Grove, PA; or 7332100, Lampire Biological Labs, Pipersville, PA) in 0.3% Triton-X and PBS, and incubated for 3 h in mouse monoclonal anti-C4F6 antibody with high affinity for hSOD1 (\nUrushitani et al., 2007\n) (1:200 in 3% NDS, 0.3% Triton-X and PBS). Sections were rinsed in PBS, incubated for 2 h in a donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 antibody (A21203, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) (1:100 in 3% NDS, 0.3% Triton-X and PBS), and rinsed in PBS. All sections were mounted in PBS, air dried for 1 h and coverslipped using ProLong Gold antifade mountant (\nP36930\n, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Staining was visualized using a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and a DM IRB fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, Deerfield, IL). For identification of cell groups in forebrain areas, an alternate series was stained with thionin.\n\nStatistical analyses\nANOVAs, posthoc tests, and t-tests were computed using GraphPad Prism version 6 for Windows (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA)."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nNG2-CreER mice (Jackson Laboratory stock 008538 (\nZhu et al., 2011\n) were bred to Rosa26-tdTomato reporter mice (kindly donated by Dr. Fan Wang, Duke University, Durham, NC. (\nArenkiel et al., 2011\n)) to produce NG2\ntdTom\nmice in which Cre is hemizygous and Rosa26-tdTo-mato is either heterozygous or homozygous. NG2\ntdTom\nmice were bred to Aldh1l1\nGFP\ntransgenic mice (\nYang et al., 2011\n) to generate NG2\ntdTom\n/Aldh1l1\nGFP\noffspring. NG2\ntdTom\nmice were also bred to Glt1\nGFP\ntransgenic mice (\nRegan et al., 2007\n) to generate NG2\ntdTom\n/Glt1\nGFP\noffspring. Aldh1l1\nGFP\nand Glt1\nGFP\nmice were kindly donated by Dr. Jeffrey Rothstein at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. Plp1-CreER mice (Jackson Laboratory stock 005975 (\nDoerflinger et al., 2003\n)) were bred to Rosa26-tdTomato mice to generate Plp1\ntdTom\noffspring in which Rosa26-tdTomato is heterozygous. All CreER and GFP transgenics were used as hemizygous. Pdgfr\u03b1-CreER mice (Jackson Laboratory stock 018280 (\nKang et al., 2010\n)) were bred to Rosa26-tdTomato mice to generate Pdgfr\u03b1\ntdTom\noffspring. All mice were in a C57BL/6 genetic background (backcrossed at least 10 times). All procedures involving animals were approved by the University of Miami Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and followed NIH guidelines.\n\n2.2. SCI surgery and EAE induction\nFor SCI, 6 to 8 week old female mice were injected daily with tamoxifen (MP Biomedicals, 0.124 mg/g body weight, i.p) for 5 consecutive days. One or eight weeks after the last injection, mice were anesthetized (ketamine/xylazine, 100 mg/15 mg/kg i.p.) and received a T8 laminectomy. The spinal column was stabilized using spinal clamps, and then mice received a moderate (75 kDyne) SCI using an Infinite Horizons impactor device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC). Mice received post-operative treatment of antibiotics (Baytril, 10 mg/kg), and analgesics (buprenorphine, 0.05 mg/kg) diluted into 1 mL of Lactated Ringer\u2019s solution injected subcutaneously twice per day for the first week following surgery. Mice received manual bladder expression twice daily until the end of the experiment.\nFor EAE induction, 2 to 4 month old mice were injected daily with tamoxifen (MP Biomedicals, 0.124 mg/g body weight, i.p) for 5 consecutive days. One week after the last tamoxifen injection, mice received an injection of pertussis toxin (500 ng/mouse; day 0 and 2, i.p.) and an injection of MOG\n35\u201355\npeptide (300 ng/mouse; day 1, i.p.) emulsified in Complete Freund Adjuvant. Clinical symptoms were recorded daily starting on day 7 until the end of the experiment. The scoring criteria was based on a commonly used 6 point scale: 0-no apparent symptoms, 1-loss of tail tone, 2-flaccid tail, 3-complete hindlimb paralysis, 4-complete forelimb paralysis, 5-moribund, 6-dead (\nBrambilla et al., 2011\n). We also included half-points to more precisely assess the disease progression: 2.5-hindlimb weakness, 3.5-forelimb weakness. Mice were sacrificed 8 days after the onset of symptoms during the acute disease phase. Disease onset was considered the second consecutive day of scoring at least a 2. All mice had reached a clinical score of at least a 3 by the time of sacrifice.\n\n2.3. Histology\nMice were anesthetized and then transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Spinal cords were dissected and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2 h, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight. For spinal cord injury tissue, 8 mm segments of the spinal cord centered at the injury site were embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek) and serial sagittal sections (16 \u03bcm) were cut using a cryostat and thaw mounted onto slides. For EAE tissue, 3 mm segments of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord were embedded in OCT compound and serial cross sections (16 \u03bcm) were cut using a cryostat and thaw mounted onto slides. Sections were immunostained with primary antibodies in 5% Normal Goat Serum in PBS with 0.3% Triton-X overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Primary antibodies used were: RFP (Rockland 600\u2013401-379S, 1:1000), GFAP (Invitrogen 130300, 1:1000; Abcam ab4674, 1:1000), APC/CC1 (Millipore 0P80 Ab-7, 1:500), GFP (Abcam ab13970, 1:2000), PDGFR\u03b2 (Abcam ab32570, 1:500), and p75 (Neuromics GT15057, 1:500). Following primary antibody incubation, sections were washed and incubated in species-appropriate Alexa Fluor IgG (H + L) secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, 1:500) at room temperature for 1 h. Slides were mounted using Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories H-1200).\n\n2.4. Histological quantification\nFor histological quantifications in\nFigs. 1\n,\n2\n, and\n3\n, images were first acquired using a 60\u00d7 objective on an Olympus FluoView 1000 confocal microscope. For spinal cord injury tissue, 6 fields (3 rostral and 3 caudal to the injury site) were taken within the first 500 \u03bcm segment of the glial scar borders. For EAE tissue, a single field was taken per lesion, which was identified by increased cell density (DAPI nuclei) and astrogliosis (GFP and GFAP), and at least 7 lesion areas were imaged per animal. All tdTomato\n+\n/DAPI\n+\ncells within the images were counted, excluding those with a tubular pericyte morphology. The results reported for\nFigs. 1\n,\n2\n, and\n4\nare the averaged cell counts of two independent observers. The NG2-CreER mice used in this study did not label macrophages or fibroblasts at the injury site. Since Pdgfr\u03b1-CreER mice also label fibroblasts at the injury site, PDGFR\u03b2\n+\n/tdTomato\n+\nfibroblasts were excluded from our quantifications. For histological quantifications in\nFig. 5\n, spinal cords from uninjured Plp1\ntdTom\nmice were sectioned coronally and images of whole spinal cord were taken using a Nikon Eclipse Ti fluorescent microscope. Subsequently, 225 by 225 \u03bcm\n2\nboxes were drawn in the dorsal column, the gray matter, and the lateral white matter, and then all tdTomato\n+\ncells were quantified within these regions. Virtually all tdTomato\n+\ncells were CC1\n+\n, indicating that they were mature oligodendrocytes (data not shown).\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nNG2 cells differentiate into Aldh1l1\nGFP+\nastrocytes after contusive SCI.

High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)\nHPLC was performed as previously described with some modifications (\nJohnson et al., 2013\n). To generate a standard curve, 6 to 8 week old female mice were anesthetized (ketamine/xylazine, 100 mg/15 mg/kg i.p.), transcardially perfused with cold PBS, the spinal cords were dissected, and 10\u201315 mg piece was homogenized in 150 \u03bcL of normal saline with 25 \u03bcL of internal standard (0.1 \u03bcg/mL propanolol in methanol) and 25 \u03bcL of tamoxifen (MP Biomedicals), or 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (Sigma, H6278\u201310MG) or\nN\n-desmethyl-tamoxifen (Sigma, D9069\u20135 mg). Samples were moved to a 10 mL glass tube and 7 mL of 2.5% isopropanol in n-hexane was added and then mixed for 5 min at 2000 rpm on a cyclomixer. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 min at 2000\ng\n. The organic layer was separated and evaporated to dryness at 40 \u00b0F using TurboVap LV (Caliper). The residue was reconstituted in 200 \u03bcL of the mobile phase (720 \u03bcL Acetonitrile + 480 \u03bcL HPLC water with 0.1% formic acid (6:4 acetonitrile:HPLC water with 0.l% formic acid)) and 2 \u03bcL was injected into an analytical column. A gradient HPLC method on a reversed phase column (Atlantis dc18 Column, 100 \u00c5, 3 \u03bcm, 2.1mm \u00d7 150 mm; Atlantis Columns; 186001299) was used on an API 4000 Q-Trap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems; Carlsbad, CA, USA) equipped with 2 HPLC pumps and a column oven (Perkin Elmer; Waltham, MA, USA) set at 60 \u00b0C. Flow rate was set at 0.9 mL/min. For experimental tissue, 6 to 8 week old female mice (n = 4\u20135 per time point) were injected with tamoxifen for 5 consecutive days as described above. At 1, 7, or 28 days after the last injection, mice were anesthetized (ketamine/xylazine, 100 mg/15 mg/kg i.p.), transcardially perfused with cold PBS, spinal cords were dissected, and processed for HPLC as described above."

Mice were housed in pairs in a temperature and humidity controlled room (21\u202f\u00b0C, 45\u201365% humidity) with a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 08:00). Mice hadad libitumaccess to water and food. Testing was carried out daily between 09:00 and 17:00 and in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and EU directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments. The work also observed ARRIVE guidelines.\n\n2.1.\nZdhhc9\nmutant mice\nZdhhc9\nknockout mice were purchased from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers (MMRRC, USA). The knockout (KO) strategy employed resulted in the disruption of the first coding exon of the\nZdhhc9\ngene, whereby a genomic region of 207\u202fbp including most of the first coding exon (exon 2) of\nZdhhc9\nwas deleted. The selection cassette that was used for the KO strategy contained both Neomycin (Neo) and LacZ and is 5288\u202fbp long, according to the sequence in the genotyping protocol given by Lexicon Genetics Incorporated, who produced the mutant line (\nhttp://mmrrc.mousebiology.org\n). All mice used in this project were back-crossed onto the C57BL/6 strain at least six times. To generate mice for use in experiments,\nZdhhc9\n+/\u2212\nfemales were caged with C57BL/6 wild-type males in order to give birth to mutant and wild-type (WT) male mice which were used as experimental mice for behavioural testing when they reached adulthood (8\u201310\u202fweeks old). All experiments reported herein compared WT and mutant male littermates. Genotyping was performed by Transnetyx.\n\n2.2. Nucleic acid extraction from mouse brain tissue\nDNA extraction from mouse brain tissue was conducted using the Isolate Genomic DNA Mini kit (Bioline) according to the instructions of the supplier. An RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen) was used for RNA extraction according to the instructions of the supplier. The concentration and purity of isolated DNA and RNA were measured using a Nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).\n\n2.3. End-point and quantitative polymerase chain reaction\nOligo d(T)-primed reverse transcription of RNA was conducted using the Tetro cDNA synthesis kit (Bioline). End-point polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used with KOD polymerase to amplify specific\nZdhhc9\nDNA and cDNA sequences. The sequences for all the primers used in this study are shown in the following\nTable 1\n. All of the primers were synthesized and supplied by Sigma. Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed in an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System, using the SYBR Select Master Mix (Life Technologies). The PCR reaction consisted of an initial polymerase activation step of 2\u202fmin at 95\u202f\u00b0C, followed by 40\u202fcycles of a denaturing stage of 15\u202fs at 95\u202f\u00b0C and an annealing and extension step at 60\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fmin.

Gene expression fold changes were determined using the 2\n(\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct)\nmethod (\nLivak and Schmittgen, 2001\n) from the RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained.\nTable 1.\nDNA sequences for all the primers used in this study (shown in 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 orientation).\nPrimer name\nPrimer Sequence (5\u2032\u20133\u2032)\nPrimers for end-point PCR and RT-qPCR\nMA1 F\nAAAGCCCATCTTGGACCAGGAAC\nMA1 R\nTCAACAGCGTGGCCATGGAG\nMA2 F\nGTGATGGCCGCGTCATGATG\nMA2 R\nAAGAGCATAGCGGCAAACACAGG\nz9v1 F\nATCGTCTATGTGGCCCTCAAATCC\nz9v1 R\nGGAATGTGTGAAATCCAGTCAGCC\nz9v2 F\nATCGTCTATGTGGCCCTCAAATCC\nz9v2 R\nAGACGGCTTCACACGGACGAAC\nHprt1 F\nCTCATGGACTGATTATGGACAGGAC\nHprt1 R\nGCAGGTCAGCAAAGAACTTATAGCC\nTbp F\nCCGTGAATCTTGGCTGTAAACTTG\nTbp R\nGTTGTCCGTGGCTCTCTTATTCTC\nMA0 F\nTCAGGGAGAAGTCGCTACCACC\n3UTR R\nTGGCATCTTCTGCCACTGTCTTAA\nOpen in a new tab\n\n2.4. Hanging wire task\nThe day following a physical gross examination, each animal was first weighed and then tested in the hanging wire test in order to assess grip strength. The animal was placed on a cage lid that was then given a small shake so that the mouse would grab the lid and then the lid was flipped upside down with the animal hanging approximately 25\u202fcm above a safe surface (benchtop). The time that the animal spent hanging was recorded. Mice were given 3 trials of 2\u202fmin maximum and the average time was used. The animals were given a 2-min rest between trials.\n\n2.5. Rotarod task\nMice were initially placed onto the rotarod (Ugo Basile/Stoelting), which was rotating at 3\u202frpm and accelerated up to 21\u202frpm within a period of 5\u202fmin. The animals were left for a maximum of 8\u202fmin on the rotarod. The animals completed 3 trials with a 10-min rest in between the trials, and the average time spent on the rotarod was used.\n\n2.6. Open field test\nEach mouse was placed into a 40\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f40\u202fcm open-top box for a 15\u202fmin habituation period followed by a 30-min test period. The animals were tracked throughout the whole 45\u202fmin task using Noldus ethovision tracking package (version 8.5). The main measures produced were locomotor output (distance travelled) and time in inner and outer edges of the box.\n\n2.7. Elevated plus maze\nThe elevated plus maze consists of two closed and two open arms (each arm is 30\u202fcm long) raised above the floor by 80\u202fcm. Each animal was placed on the centre of the maze and left to explore it for a single trial of 10\u202fmin. Noldus ethovision tracking package (version 8.5) was used to track the animals during the task. The main measures taken were distance travelled and time spent in open and in closed arms of the maze.\n\n2.8. Startle curve\nMice were exposed to a range of volumes from 65\u202fdB (background level of volume) to 120\u202fdB for 20\u202fmin and their startle reactivity was measured by displacement of an accelerometer attached to the restrainer. The instrument used was the SR Lab apparatus from San Diego Instruments.\n\n2.9. Pre-pulse inhibition\nDuring the task which lasts for 20\u202fmin, animals were exposed to 120\u202fdB startle trials which were preceded with a range of pre-pulses above the background level of 65\u202fdB. The pre-pulse levels were 4, 8 and 16\u202fdB above background. The instrument used was the SR Lab apparatus from San Diego Instruments. The percentage of pre-pulse inhibition was calculated based on the following formula:\n100\n\u00d7\nStartle reactivity\nat\n120\ndB\n\u2212\nStartle reactivity\nat\nprepulse level\nStartle reactivity\nat\n120\ndB\n\n2.10. Morris water maze\nFor the purposes of the task, a round black IR-translucent Perspex tank 98\u202fcm in diameter stood on an IR lightbox and was filled with tap water and left overnight to equilibrate at room temperature (21\u202f\u00b0C). Then, a round 10\u202fcm transparent platform was submerged 1\u202fcm below the water surface of the maze.\nDuring the first day of the task, a habituation period of 60\u202fs took place where the platform was placed at the centre of the round water maze. Each mouse was placed on the platform and was given a small boost to start swimming and explore the maze. If the animal did not return to the platform within the 60\u202fs of the habituation, the researcher placed it on the platform for 5\u202fs. The animal was then removed from the maze and was allowed to dry under a ceramic heat lamp.\nFollowing the habituation period and for 5 subsequent days, 4 acquisition trials of 60\u202fs maximum took place each day using pseudorandomly various release points that were not close to the platform. The platform was placed at a distance of 20\u202fcm from the maze wall towards the centre of the maze for the acquisition trials. If the mouse did not locate the platform within 60\u202fs, it was placed on the platform for 5\u202fs. Mice were always given 10\u202fmin rest between trials in order to avoid hypothermia.\nOn the 6th day, a single probe trial of 60\u202fs took place where the platform was removed and the time the animal spent swimming in the quadrant where the platform was originally located\nversus\nthe opposite quadrant was measured in order to assess reference memory. On the 7th day of the experiment a visual cue test of 60\u202fs maximum duration was conducted to exclude any visual problems, motivation differences or motor dysfunction. Before the visual cue test, all the external cues were covered as a white curtain was placed around the water maze hanging from the wall. The platform was this time positioned 2\u202fcm above the water level and a yellow flag was placed on it to make it easily visible. The animal was put in the water maze near the maze wall and the time the animal spent to reach the platform was noted.\n\n2.11. Fast low angle shot magnetic resonance imaging (FLASH MRI) and analysis\nIn order to perform\nex vivo\nMRI scans of mouse brain, transcardial perfusion with 4% formaldehyde was performed, and the brains were subsequently removed. Brains were stored at 4\u202f\u00b0C for 7\u202fdays in order to then perform T1 weighted imaging and were sent to the University of Liverpool where the MRI scanning was performed in the Centre for Pre-clinical Imaging. The brain was initially incubated in 1.5% MultiHance contrast agent by Bracco Diagnostics containing 5\u202fmM Gadobenate Dimeglumine in 4% Paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4\u202f\u00b0C for 4\u202fdays prior to imaging. Gadolinium is the main chemical agent contained in MultiHance that reduces the T1 relaxation time (\nRaymond and Pierre, 2005\n). For imaging, the brain was placed into a pool of fluorinated oil within a holder before being put into the magnet. A 28\u202fmm resonator coil was used and all images were acquired at room temperature. The acquisition time was 2\u202fh and 3\u202fmin in a 9.4 Tesla pre-clinical horizontal bore Bruker magnet and a resolution of 41\u202f\u03bcm. Images were preliminarily reconstructed using Paravision 6.0.1. For analysis, manual morphometry was used. Manual image segmentation and structural volumetric analysis was carried out in Amira\u21226.01 software. The overall brain, corpus callosum and hippocampus were segmented using a number of semi-automatic segmentation tools within the software. A surface generated module was attached to each of the segmentation labels and a surface view module was then used to obtain a 3D reconstruction. Material statistics were used to evaluate the number of voxels contributing to each of the segmented structures.\n\n2.12. Brain homogenisation and tissue fractionation\nDiced whole brain or isolated hippocampi were placed in a Dounce homogenizer with Buffer A (25\u202fmM HEPES, 25\u202fmM NaCl, 1\u202fmM EDTA, pH\u202f7.4), and homogenized by 20 strokes and then passed at least 5 times through a syringe with a 26G needle. The brain lysates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting analysis. For tissue fractionation, the brain lysate was centrifuged at 800\u202f\u00d7\ng\nfor 5\u202fmin at 4\u202f\u00b0C in order to pellet the nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 16100\u202f\u00d7\ng\nfor 50\u202fmin at 4\u202f\u00b0C, and the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) removed and kept for analysis. The pellet containing the membrane fraction was solubilised in buffer A containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v). Equal amounts of cytosol and membrane fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting analysis.\n\n2.13. Resin-assisted capture of S-acylated proteins (acyl-RAC)\nA membrane fraction from brain or hippocampus was treated with MMTS to block free SH groups (100\u202fmM HEPES, 1.0\u202fmM EDTA, 2.5% SDS and 1.25% MMTS) for 1.5\u202fh at 40\u202f\u00b0C in a dry bath with frequent vortexing. The sample was then acetone precipitated and the washed pellet resuspended in 400\u202f\u03bcl of binding buffer (100\u202fmM HEPES, 1\u202fmM EDTA, 1% SDS). 160\u202f\u03bcl of the protein sample was then added to each of two tubes containing activated Thiopropyl sepharose beads (the remaining 80\u202f\u03bcl was kept as total input control). Hydroxylamine or Tris (both at a final concentration of 0.5\u202fM) were then added to one tube each, and incubated overnight at room temperature with end-over-end mixing on a benchtop rotator. In order to separate the beads from the unbound proteins, the samples were centrifuged at 800\u202f\u00d7\ng\nfor 5\u202fmin at RT. The supernatant was removed and retained as the unbound fraction. The remaining beads were washed 5 times with 1\u202fml binding buffer, and the proteins subsequently eluted from the beads in Laemmli sample buffer containing 50\u202fmM DTT. The eluted proteins represent the bound fraction. Before subjecting all samples to SDS-PAGE, the final volumes of the bound and unbound fractions were equalised.\n\n2.14. Transfection of HEK293T cells\nHEK293T cells on poly-\nd\n-lysine-coated 24-well plates were transfected with 1\u202f\u03bcg of mouse zDHHC constructs (in PEF-BOS-HA vector) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Paisley UK). Cells were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer containing 25\u202fmM DTT approximately 24\u202fh post-transfection.\n\n2.15. Immunoblotting\nPrimary antibodies used for immunoblotting were as follows: mouse beta actin (Abcam, ab8226, 1:3000), rat HA (Roche, 1:1000), rabbit zDHHC9 (St John's Laboratory,\nSTJ92709\n, 1:1000), rabbit H-Ras (Santa Cruz, SC-520, 1:300), rabbit GAPDH (Cell Signaling, 14C10, 1:1000), mouse syntaxin (Sigma, HPC-1, 1:1000). IRdye-conjugated secondary antibodies were from LICOR (used at 1:10,000). Images were obtained using a LICOR Odyssey infrared scanner.\n\n2.16. Statistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was conducted using either SPSS version 22 or Minitab version 17 software packages. For the analysis of the RT-qPCR, an unpaired\nt\n-test in Minitab was used to determine if there was a genotype effect on the normalised \u0394Ct values of the target genes. For the analysis of hanging wire and rotarod experiments, an unpaired\nt\n-test in Minitab was used to determine if there was a genotype effect on average times the animals spent on the wire or the rotarod, respectively. For the analysis of the open field test, a general linear model repeated measures (ANOVA) was used in SPSS to determine if there was a genotype or time effect on time spent in zones or velocity of the animals. For the analysis of the elevated plus maze, unpaired\nt\n-tests were conducted in Minitab to determine if there was a genotype effect on time spent in open/closed arms or distance travelled. For the analysis of the startle curve and pre-pulse inhibition, general linear model repeated measures (ANOVA) was used in SPSS to determine if there was a genotype effect on the startle reactivity or the percentage of the pre-pulse inhibition of the animals. For the analysis of the Morris water maze, a general linear model repeated measures (ANOVA) was used in SPSS to determine if there was a genotype or day effect on the distance travelled, time and velocity of the animals for the first 5\u202fdays of the experiment while for the probe trial, the same statistical test was used to determine if there was a genotype or quadrant effect on the time spent in different quadrants. For the visual cue trial of the Morris water maze, an unpaired\nt\n-test in Minitab was used to determine if there was a genotype effect on time to complete the trial. As or the analysis of the volumetric results of MRI, an unpaired\nt\n-test in Minitab was used to determine if there is a genotype effect on the volume of hippocampus or corpus callosum. Finally, unpaired\nt\n-tests in Minitab were conducted to determine if there was a genotype effect on the level of membrane association and S-acylation of H-Ras."

    "Methods": "4.1. Spinal cord motor neuron differentiation\nHuman induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from three healthy individuals were differentiated into spinal motor neurons using a dual SMAD inhibition modified protocol (\nSupplementary Fig. 1A\n), as described previously (\nSaporta et al., 2015\n). Briefly, iPSC were cultivated in Essential medium 8, on 100 mm plate coated with Geltrex until 90\u201395% confluency. On day 1 of differentiation, medium was changed to KSR medium (DMEM/F12 GlutaMAX, 15% Serum replacement medium, 1% NEAA, 110 \u03bcM 2-Mercaptoethanol, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin). On day 4 medium was gradually changed to 70:30 KSR medium:N2Base medium (DMEM/F12 GlutaMAX, 1\u00d7 N-2 Supplement, 0.16% D-Glucose, 0.2 mM L-Ascorbic Acid, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin). On days 5 and 6 media were changed to 50:50 KSR medium:N2Base medium. From day 1 to day 6, media were supplemented with 1 \u03bcM dorsomorphine and 10 \u03bcM SB431542. On days 7 and 8 media were changed to 50:50 KSR medium:Maturation medium (DMEM/F12 GlutaMAX, 2\u00d7 N-2 Supplement, 2\u00d7 B-27 Supplement, 0.32% D-Glucose, 0.8 mM L-Ascorbic Acid, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin), supplemented with 1 \u03bcM dorsomorphine, 10 \u03bcM SB431542, 1.5 \u03bcM retinoic acid and 200 nM SAG, 2 ng/mL BDNF, 2 ng/mL GDNF, 2 ng/mL CNTF. From day 9 to day 24 only Maturation medium with all supplements was used.\n\n4.2. Magnetic sorting\nOn day 24, iPSC-differentiated cultures were dissociated and mature motor neurons were isolated using magnetic bead sorting based on L1CAM, as previously described (\nSaporta et al., 2015\n). Briefly, on day 24 of differentiation neurons were dissociated with Trypsin-EDTA 0.05% solution (Sigma) and counted. A portion of cells, called unsorted cell fraction, were separated and plated for further immunostaining characterization. The remaining neuronal culture was incubated for 1 h with anti-CD171 PE (L1CAM) antibody (Thermo Scientific) as primary antibody. Cells were centrifuged, washed once using Sorting Buffer (6% Fetal Bovine serum in 1\u00d7 DPBS) and incubated with anti-PE microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) for 15 min. After another centrifugation and washing step, cells were ressuspended in Sorting Buffer and applied onto prepared LS Column placed into MidiMACS separator (Miltenyi Biotec), following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The column was washed 3 times with 3 mL of Sorting Buffer, removed from the MidiMACS separator and placed in a separated conical tube. The positive cell fraction containing the purified motor neurons was eluted with 5 mL of Sorting Buffer by firmly pushing the plunger into the column. Neuronal cultures were maintained in motor neuron maturation medium until used in end-point experiments.\n\n4.3. Axonal and somatodendritic mRNA isolation using filters\nImmediately after sorting, motor neurons were counted and 2 million cells were plated on poly-L-ornithine/laminin-coated permeable inserts bearing a 1.0-\u03bcm porous membrane (filter) to obtain large amounts of enriched axonal material for RNA isolation (\nUnsain et al., 2014\n). To guide the axonal migration through the filter and into the axonal compartment (bottom) we used a gradient of growth factors, with 10 times higher concentration (20ng/mL) of GDNF, BDNF and CNTF supplemented on bottom compartment for two consecutive days. Axons grew for 10 days before RNA isolation. Axonal and somatodendritic RNA were isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit or RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). Filters were washed once with PBS and neuronal bodies were scraped using 200 uL of RNeasy buffer added to the top of the filter. To avoid any contamination to the axonal compartment, the top side of the filter was cleaned using cotton-tip before scrapping the axonal material. Then, the filter was removed from the plate and placed upside down and axonal material were collected using 100 uL of RNeasy Micro Kit buffer and a cell scraper. RNA integrity and quantity were measured on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Nano Assay (Agilent), and quantified using the RNA Quant-It assay for the Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen).\n\n4.4. Immunostaining\nMotor neuron were plated on top of permeable inserts as described above. Axons were allowed to grow for 10 days before immunostaining. Medium was removed, and inserts washed once in PBS before fixating the cells in 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min. Top and bottom compartments were scrapped and cleaned with a cotton tip for the bottom and top filter immunostaining, respectively. Immunostaining was performed as described previously (\nSaporta et al., 2015\n). Primary antibodies used: anti-NFL (abcam), anti-\u03b2TubIII (Sigma), anti-HB9, anti-MAP2 (Thermo Scientific), anti-CHAT (Millipore), anti-SMI32 (NFH) (BioLegend). Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 594 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies. All nuclei were stained with DAPI. After immunostaining, filters were cut from inserts, placed on microscopy slides, and covered with a coverslip and mounting media.\n\n4.5. RNA sequencing and data processing\nWhole transcriptome sequencing was performed at the Sequencing Core of the John P. Hussman Institute of Human Genomics at the University of Miami. Following standard Illumina protocols, 80 to 100 ng of total RNA via Agilent Bioanalyzer were ribo-depleted using Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat) (Illumina) and subsequent library construction was performed using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit. Libraries were single-end sequenced on Illumina\u2019s HiSeq2000 sequencer to produce 75 base pair reads. Quality control metrics for the raw reads were assessed using FastQC (\nAndrews, 2010\n). Total reads per sample showed low variance, ranging from 39.8\u201342.9 million reads. Reads were aligned to Ensembl\u2019s human GRCh37.75 genome using STAR. HTSeq was used for gene quantification of the aligned reads against the GENCODE reference gtf file for the human GRCh37.75 genome (\nAnders et al., 2015\n).\n\n4.6. RNA-seq analysis\nGene-level differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (\nLove et al., 2014\n). Differentially localized transcripts were determined by an adjusted\np\n-value (q-value) threshold of 0.1 and log fold change greater than or equal to 1.5 or less than or equal to 0.5. The DAVID Functional Annotation Tool was used for enrichment analysis of the differentially localized transcript sets (\nHuang et al., 2009b\n;\nHuang et al., 2009a\n). The intersection of known CMT disease genes and mitochondrial genes with the differentially localized transcripts was analyzed by Chi-square with Yate\u2019s correction test.\n\n4.7. Quantitative real-time PCR\nqPCR was used to validate the expression of mitochondrial and CMT/HSP genes found to be enriched in axonal compartment. cDNA from axonal and somatodendritic compartments from three control lines were used in TaqMan Assays. Amplification was performed as duplex reactions using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays-FAM for target genes and \u03b2-actin-VIC as endogenous control. The cDNA was diluted 1:5 with water and used in quantitative real-time PCR with TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Thermo Scientific) on CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (BIORAD). For each sample, the reaction was run in triplicates and expression levels of target genes were normalized by \u03b2-actin expression levels, within each sample.\n\n4.8. RNA Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)\nRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed using RNAscope probes following manufacturer\u2019s procedures (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Briefly, sorted motor neurons were plated on coverslips and axons were allowed to grow for 5 days before fixating with 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were dehydrated with ethanol. After rehydration, neurons were permeabilized with PBS/ T 0.1% (PBS/Tween 20) for 10 min at RT. Protein digestion was performed using RNAscope Protease III at 1:3 dilution for 10 min at RT. Specific probe detecting KIF5C was incubated following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex Assay for Adherent Cells). All incubations were performed at 40 \u00b0C using the HybEZ hybridization oven. Hybridization with KIF5C mRNA probe was followed by immunofluorescent staining using anti-SMI32 (BioLegend) or anti-\u03b2TubIII (Sigma) antibodies. Images were acquired using EVOS Fluo equipped with a 100\u00d7 oil objective, 1.28 Numerical Aperture and Olympus FV1000 Confocal equipped with a 60\u00d7/1.42 0il/0.16/ FN26.5 objective."

    "Methods": "Diet and Mice\nSeven-week-old male C57/BL6 #027 mice were purchased from Charles\nRiver (Wilmington, Mass) and maintained on a 12:12h light/dark cycle in the\nresearch support facility at the University of Kansas Medical Center. All mice\nwere given ad libitum access to food and water and were fed either a standard\nchow diet (8604; Envigo, Madison Wisconsin; 14% kcals from fat,\n32% protein, and 54% carbohydrate), a high-fat diet (07011;\nEnvigo; 54% kcals from vegetable shortening (hydrogenated) and corn oil\nfat, 21% protein and 24% carbohydrate), or a ketogenic diet\n(96355; Envigo; 90.5% kcals from vegetable shortening (hydrogenated) and\ncorn oil fat, 9.2% protein, and 0.3% carbohydrate). Standard\ndiet energy was calculated as previously described (\nGroover et al., 2013\n).\nTwo separate experiments to examine the effects of dietary and exercise\ninterventions on peripheral nerves were conducted. The first experiment included\nmice, referred to as the \u201cchallenge cohort\u201d, included\ncontrol-fed sedentary (CF-Sed); high-fat sedentary (HF-Sed); high-fat exercise\n(HF-Ex); ketogenic (Keto) groups of mice. After baseline behavioral testing was\ncomplete, mice were separated and the groups were then challenged with different\ndiets and/or access to running wheels.\nThe second experiment included groups of mice referred to as\n\u201cintervention cohort\u201d in which all mice were fed a high-fat diet\nfor eight weeks (notated as HF-CF-Sed, HF-HF-Sed, HF-HF-Ex, HF-Keto). After\neight weeks and baseline behavioral testing, mice were then separated and the\ngroups were given different diets or interventions. Control-fed, high-fat-fed\nand ketogenic-fed mice were all pair housed for the entirety of the study.\nExercise mice were singly housed to allow for analysis of running amounts for\neach mouse and given access to a voluntary running wheel and were allowed to run\nfor the remainder of the study. All mice were 8 weeks of age at the start of\neach experiment. A timeline of diet and exercise challenge and intervention\ncohorts are displayed in\nFigure 1\n. All\nstudies were in accordance with NIH guidelines and conformed to protocols\napproved by the institutional Animal Care Committee.\nFigure 1. Experimental Timeline of Cohorts.\nOpen in a new tab\na) Challenge cohort: All mice remained on a control diet until baseline testing\nwas completed, then mice were changed to experimental diets and exercise for 12\nweeks. b) Intervention cohort: all mice remained on a high fat diet for 8 weeks,\nat which point baseline testing was completed, mice were divided into different\nintervention groups and provided different diets and exercise for 12 additional\nweeks.\n\nBlood Measurements\nMice underwent assessments for weight and blood glucose (glucose\ndiagnostic reagents; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) biweekly after a 3 hour fast (\nGroover et al., 2013\n). Additionally, at the\ntime of sacrifice following a 3 hour fast, blood was drawn from the chest cavity\nand allowed to clot for 30 min on ice, spun at 3,000g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C\nand serum drawn off and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C until insulin was\nanalyzed by ELISA (Alpco; Salem, NH). Blood ketones (\u03b2-Ketone blood test\nstrips; Precision Xtra; Abbott Laboratories; Chicago, IL) were measured at\nbaseline, week 1, 4, 8, and at sacrifice following a 3 hour fast.\nAfter 4 weeks, an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was\nperformed after a 6 hour fast. Animals were given 1g glucose/kg body weight.\nBlood glucose levels were measured via tail clip immediately before glucose\ninjection, and 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes thereafter.\n\nBody Composition\nBody composition to assess fat mass was measured using the EchoMRI-100\n(EchoMRI, Houston, TX). The first cohort of mice\u2019s body composition was\ndetermined immediately before sacrifice. Mice in the obesity intervention groups\nhad body composition determined biweekly from baseline testing until\nsacrifice.\n\nSensory Behavior Testing\nSensory behavior assessments were carried out at baseline and biweekly\ntime points for all mice. Dietary fed mice were examined for both mechanical and\nthermal sensitivity, while mice in the obesity intervention groups were only\nexamined for mechanical sensitivity. Mechanical sensitivity was assessed using\nVon Frey monofilaments as previously described (\nGroover et al., 2013\n). Thermal thresholds were assessed by placing\nmice in individual clear plastic cages on a Hargreaves\u2019s apparatus and a\n4.0 V radiant heat source was applied three times to the hind paw as previously\ndescribed (\nGroover et al., 2013\n).\n\nIntraepidermal Nerve Fiber (IENF) Density\nFootpads were collected and processed from all mice using protocols\npreviously described for IENF density (\nGroover et\nal., 2013\n).\n\nNeurite Outgrowth\nLumbar DRGs 4-6 neurons were harvested and dissociated to a single cell\nsuspension as previously described (\nMalin et\nal., 2007\n). Mice were fed the control, high-fat, or ketogenic diet\ndescribed above for four weeks prior to DRG dissection. Upon plating, all mice\nwere given Nutrient Hams F-12 media with 10mM glucose for 4 days (Gibco).\nAdditional culture experiments utilized chow-fed mice in which DRG neurons were\nplated and were given F12 media custom supplemented with varying levels of\nglucose (0mM, 5mM, 10mM) and/or the ketone (R)-(-)-3\u2013hydroxybutyric acid\n(5mM or 10mM) (Sigma). Ketone levels were selected to mirror glucose levels to\nreduce energy availability differences effecting neurite outgrowth and to mirror\nphysiological levels seen in human patients on a nutritional ketogenic diet\n(\nKoppel and Swerdlow, 2017\n).\nFollowing the 4 days in culture, neurons were fixed with 4%\nparaformaldehyde for 10 minutes. Immunohistochemistry was performed with SMI-312\n(Covance, Emeryville, CA), a pan-axonal marker, to visualize neurites and\ncounterstained with nuclear marker, Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen). Coverslips were\nmounted on slides and imaged. Neurite outgrowth area was quantified using Image\nJ. A stereological grid was superimposed on images of the cultures, and the\nnumber of neurites crossing exactly through intersections of the grid was\ncounted, as was the number of neuronal cell bodies producing neurites. Three\nregions of interest were imaged per coverslip, and three coverslips per group\nwere analyzed for each animal and the neurite area per neuron was calculated\naccording to the following equation (\nBlacklock et\nal., 2005\n):\n(\nneurite\nintersections\ntotal\ngrid\nintersections\n)\n\u00d7\ntotal\ngrid\narea\nneurons\nextending\nneurites\n=\nneurite\narea\n(\n\u03bc\nm\n2\n)\nper\nneuron\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll data is presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Data was analyzed for\nnormality utilizing D\u2019Agostino & Pearson normality test or\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test where appropriate. Data was analyzed using a one-way\nANOVA, two-factor ANOVA, or repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc comparisons\nanalyzed using Fisher\u2019s test of least square difference where\nappropriate. Statistical significance was defined as p <0.05 and all\nstatistics were run using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla,\nCA)."

    "Methods": "2.1. Case selection and neuropathological assessment\nSpecimens were obtained from the Emory Alzheimer Disease Research Center Neuropathology Core, Atlanta, GA. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 to 2 weeks before being transferred to cryopreservative. The neuropathologic diagnosis of PD was based on the presence of nigral degeneration and Lewy bodies. Control cases had no clinical history or neuropathologic diagnosis of neurologic disease. Case descriptions are provided in\nSupplemental Table 1\n.\n\n2.2. Immunofluorescent staining for human tissues\nFixed, cryopreserved, free-floating, 50-\u03bcm-thick sections were prepared using a freezing sliding microtome. Basal ganglia samples underwent antigen retrieval using citrate/Tween-20 at 96 \u00b0C for 25 min followed by incubation for 60 min in glycine +10% donkey serum. Sections were incubated with mouse anti-Na\nv\n1.6 (1:250 dilution, Cat #WH0006334M4, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:250 dilution, Cat #019\u201319,741, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Following incubation, sections were washed in PBS and TruBlack (Biotium) for one minute and then rinsed 3 times with PBS. Sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 or 488 for 1.5 h and then rinsed 4 times with PBS. Sections were mounted on glass slides and coverslipped using Fluormount G mounting media. The specificity of the Na\nv\n1.6 antibody was confirmed by omitting the primary antibody, which resulted in no detectable signal. Fluorescent images were captured on a Zeiss Axio Observer D1 microscope (Zeiss Inc., Germany) with an X-Cite series 120Q fluorescent illuminator, a ProgRes\u00ae MF camera (Jenoptik Optical Systems GmbH, Germany), and ProgRes\u00aeCapturePro 2.8 software (Jenoptik Inc., Easthampton, MA).\nOptical intensity of fluorescence of Na\nv\n1.6 stain was semi-quantified in individual cells that were co-labeled with Iba1 (20\u201325 cells/section) using ImageJ software (NIH) and the data were presented as density/intensity changes in the expression of Na\nv\n1.6.\n\n2.3. Animals\nTen-week-old male C57BL/6 J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). They were housed 5 per cage in a temperature-controlled animal care facility under a 12 h light/dark cycle with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. Experiments were performed in compliance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the animal care and utilization committee of Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.\n\n2.4. MPTP treatment\nA total of 36 mice were randomly divided into 9 mice per group across four treatment groups (saline, MPTP + saline, zonisamide + saline, and MPTP + zonisamide). MPTP (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and zonisamide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were freshly prepared in saline (0.9% NaCl, Hospira, Lake Forest, IL). Mice were given a single injection of MPTP (base free, 12.5 mg/kg s.c., Sigma-Aldrich, St. Luis, MO) and 90 min later mice were administered the first dose of zonisamide (20 mg/kg i.p.) or saline followed by an injection every 4 h for total of 3 injections. We selected a single dose of 12.5/kg of MPTP because this dosing regimen has been shown to result in striatal injury and neuroinflammation that occurs rapidly after administration (\nO\u2019Callaghan et al., 1990\n). The timing of the zonisamide treatment was to ensure that it occurred after the peak of MPP\n+\nlevels in the brain, which peaks at 90 min following administration (J.P. O\u2019Callaghan, personal communication), such that its ability to inhibit MAO-B would not confound the experiment (\nSonsalla et al., 2010\n). Animals were euthanized with CO\n2\n2.5 h after the last dose of zonisamide. Striata were rapidly dissected out, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until processing for RNA isolation.\n\n2.5. Immunofluorescent staining for mouse tissues\nMice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). Brains were removed and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 \u00b0C for 7 days, and then transferred into 30% sucrose with 0.1% sodium azide in PBS. The entire striatum was cut into 30 \u03bcm coronal sections on a freezing, sliding microtome.\nImmunofluorescent staining was performed as described previously with some modification (\nAlam et al., 2017\n). Briefly, free-floating sections were rinsed, then blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 60 min at room temp. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with anti-Iba1 (1:250 dilution, Cat #019\u201319741, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan), anti-Na\nv\n1.6 (1:250 dilution, Cat #WH0006334M4, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-TNF-\u03b1 (1:500 dilution, cat #AB1793, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-gp91\nphox\n(1:250 dilution, Cat # SC27635, Santa Cruz, CA) with 3% goat serum in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100. After being washed three times, sections were incubated with appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor (1:250 dilution, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Sections were then rinsed of excess secondary antibody, mounted onto slides, dried, and cover lipped with Prolong Gold containing 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Life Technologies). Fluorescent images were captured as described above for the human samples. A negative control consisting of incubations without primary antibody was included to determine specific staining of Nav1.6. Semi-quantification of images for Nav1.6 were performed as described above.\n\n2.6. RNA isolation and real-time quantitative PCR\nRNA isolation and qPCR was performed as described previously (\nFortin et al., 2013\n;\nHossain et al., 2015\n). Briefly, RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kits as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). RNA concentration was then determined on a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and cDNA was synthesized from 1 \u03bcg of total RNA with the First Strand Super Script cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Real-time qPCR was performed in a 384-well plate using the ABI 7900HT and SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) detection system. Melt curves were obtained to confirm the quality of product for each primer set. Each primer set was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm a single PCR product of the expected size. The expression of GAPDH was used to normalize the amount of mRNA in each sample. Data were analyzed using the \u0394\u0394\nCt\nmethod and results are presented as relative levels of mRNA. The primer sequences for all target mRNAs are designed with the Primer Blast program (NCBI) and provided in\nSupplemental Table 2\n.\n\n2.7. Statistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using Prism 5.01 software (Graphpad software, San Diego, CA). Student\u2019s\nt\n-test was used to determine differences between control and PD brain expression of Nav 1.6. All analyses for the animal treatments were performed using two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc multiple comparison test to compare the difference among groups. All values were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM and the\np\nvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Animals and Food\nFemale C57BL6 mice (8\u201310 weeks old) utilized in this study were bred in-house under pathogen-free conditions. Food and water were accessible\nad libitum\n, and all animals were on a 12-hour light/dark cycle. PLX5622 was obtained from Plexxikon, Inc. and was mixed into AIN-76A control chow by Research Diets, Inc. Mice were fed normal control chow for 7 days after induction of EAE, at which point they were switched to food containing the PLX5622 drug or comparable drug-free control food for the remainder of the experiment. PLX5622 was administered in two doses \u2013 high dose food contained 1,200 mg PLX5622 per kilogram of food, and low dose contained 300 mg/kg PLX5622. After two weeks of drug administration, PLX5622 was detectable in both plasma and in brain tissue, with the high dose treated animals reaching a concentration approximately double of those treated with low dose PLX5622 (\nTable S1\n).\n\nInduction of EAE with MOG\n35-55\nPeptide\nMOG\n35-55\npeptide (MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK) was purchased from Biomatik USA, LLC (Wilmington, DE). EAE was induced in female mice (8\u201310 weeks old) by subcutaneous injection in the hind flank on day 0 and day 7 with 300 \u03bcg of MOG\n35-55\nemulsified in complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA) containing 500 \u03bcg of heat-inactivated\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n(Difco, Detroit, MI) (\nBhasin et al., 2007\n;\nNissen and Tsirka, 2016\n;\nWu et al., 2012\n). Five hundred nanograms of Pertussis toxin (List Biologicals, Campbell, CA) in 200 \u03bcL of PBS was injected intraperitoneally on days 0 and 2. After immunization, mice were observed daily and weighed weekly. The severity of disease symptoms was scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 5 with 0.25 gradations for intermediate symptoms. The scores are defined as follows (\nHjelmstrom, 1998\n): 0, no detectable symptoms; 1, loss of tail tone; 2, hindlimb weakness or abnormal gait; 3, complete hindlimb paralysis; 4, complete hindlimb paralysis with forelimb weakness or paralysis; 5, moribund or dead. Investigators were blinded to the treatments during the experiment.\n\nTissue Collection and Processing for Histopathology\nMice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 2.5% avertin (0.02 mL/g body weight) and transcardially perfused using PBS (pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS (pH 7.4). Spinal cords were isolated, post-fixed in 4% PFA, and dehydrated in 30% sucrose. After removing the meninges, the spinal cord was cut into 6 equal sections, embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Tissue Tek), frozen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Tissue was sectioned at 20\u03bcm on a cryostat prior to staining.\n\nImmunofluorescence\nSpinal cord sections mounted on slides for immunofluorescence were rinsed in PBS for 5 min to remove residual OCT. After washing, samples were blocked in serum of the host of the secondary antibody (5% serum and 0.3% BSA in PBS with 0.2% Triton-X 100) and then incubated overnight with rabbit anti-mouse Iba1 (1:500, Wako), mouse anti-mouse iNOS (1:500, BD Biosciences), mouse anti-mouse Arg-1 (1:500, BD Biosciences), rat anti-mouse CD86 (1:500, BD Biosciences), goat anti-mouse CD206 (1:100, R&D Systems), rabbit anti-mouse GFAP (1:1000, Dako) rabbit anti-mouse NG2 (1:500, a generous gift from the Levine lab), mouse anti-mouse CC1 (1:100, EMD Millipore), rat anti-mouse MBP (1:50, Bio-Rad), or rabbit anti-mouse neurofilament-L (1:100, EMD Millipore) in 0.3% BSA in PBS with 0.2% Triton-X 100. After washing with PBS, sections were incubated with fluorescence-conjugated FITC or Cy3 goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rat, or donkey anti-goat antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and mounted using Fluoromount-G with DAPI (Southern Biotech, USA). The sections were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope and Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope.\n\nEriochrome cyanine staining\nEriochrome cyanine (EC) staining was used to visualize myelin in the lumbar region of the spinal cord as we have previously described (\nWu et al., 2012\n). In brief, spinal cord sections previously stored at \u221280\u00b0C were air-dried overnight at room temperature. The sections were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours in a dry incubator. After incubation with acetone for 5 minutes, the slides were air-dried for 30 minutes and then stained in EC solution (0.2% eriochrome cyanine RS (Sigma), 0.5% H\n2\nSO\n4\n(Sigma), 10% iron alum (Sigma) in distilled water) for 30 minutes, differentiated in 5% iron alum (Sigma) for 10 minutes, and placed in borax-ferricyanide solution (1% borax (Sigma), 1.25% potassium ferricyanide (Sigma), in distilled water) for 5 minutes. The slides were then dehydrated through graded ethanol solutions and coverslipped using Permount (Fisher Scientific, NJ, USA). The stained sections were then imaged on a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope at 40x magnification. ImageJ freeware (NIH) was used to measure the demyelinated and total areas of the white matter. In brief, images were cropped to remove the gray matter regions prior to quantification. To distinguish between positive-staining white matter areas and demyelinated regions, thresholding was used to obtain a binary signal. The demyelinated area was determined by subtracting the myelinated region from the total area, and percentage was calculated as shown below. Six full coronal sections were analyzed for each biological replicate.\nDemyelinated\narea\n(\n%\n)\n=\n(\nDemyelinated\narea\nin\nwhite\nmatter\n/\nTotal\nwhite\nmatter\narea\n)\n\u2217\n100\n%\n\nFlow Cytometry\nTo analyze immune cell populations in the spinal cord, spleen, and blood, MOG-EAE was induced as explained above. The mice then received either control chow or chow containing 1,200 mg/kg PLX5622 on Day 14, to model a therapeutic treatment timeline more relevant to clinical applications. On Day 18, mice were euthanized by avertin injection and cardiac puncture was performed to collect blood. The spleen and the spinal cord were then isolated.\nThe blood was collected in a heparinized syringe and 100 uL of whole blood was blocked with CD16/32 Fc block (Biolegend, 1:50 in FACS buffer) for 30 minutes and stained with CD11b-APC (Biolegend, 1:100), CD45-PerCP-Cy5.5 (Biolegend, 1:100) and Ly6C-FITC (Biolegend, 1:100) in FACS buffer for 30 minutes. This was followed by incubation with 1-step Fix/Lyse (eBioscience) for 30 minutes and 1 wash in FACS buffer.\nThe spleen was isolated and pressed through a 70um cell strainer to create a single cell suspension. Splenocytes were treated with ACK lysing buffer (0.15 M NH\n4\nCl, 10 mM KHCO\n3\n, 0.1 mM Na\n2\n-EDTA) for 5 minutes on ice to lyse red blood cells. Cells were then rinse and counted using trypan blue exclusion on a hemocytometer. Suspended cells were blocked using anti-mouse CD16/32 Fc block (Biolegend, 1:50 in FACS buffer) and stained with CD11b-APC (Biolegend, 1:100), CD86-Pacific Blue (Biolegend, 1:100), CD206-PE (Biolegend, 1:100), and MHCII-FITC (Biolegend, 1:100). After two rinses with FACS buffer, cells were fixed in 4% PFA (Biolegend), washed twice with FACS buffer, and re-suspended for analysis.\nThe spinal cord was digested in 1 mg/mL papain (Sigma) and triturated for mechanical dissociation. Following removal of the papain solution, 30% Percoll (Sigma) was added to remove myelin debris by density centrifugation. Cells were rinsed twice in HBSS and blocked with CD16/32 Fc block (Biolegend, 1:50 in FACS buffer) for 30 minutes. Cells were then stained with CD11b-APC (1:100), CD86-Pacific Blue (1:100) and CD206-PE (1:100) (Biolegend) or with CD3-Pacific Blue (1:100) and CD4-PerCP (1:100) for 30 minutes. After two rinses with FACS buffer, cells were fixed in 4% PFA (Biolegend). For analysis of Th subsets, following fixation, cells were permeabilized with 1x Permeabilization Wash Buffer (Biolegend) by rinsing 3 times, blocking for 30 minutes on ice (1:50 Fc block in 1x Permeabilization Wash Buffer) and staining with IFN\u03b3-FITC (Biolegend, 1:100 in 1x Permeabilization Wash Buffer) and IL-17a-PE (Biolegend, 1:100 in 1x Permeabilization Wash Buffer) for 1 hour on ice. Cells were rinsed twice more in Permeabilization Wash Buffer and re-suspended in FACS buffer for analysis.\nAnalysis was performed on a BD LSR Fortessa and post-processed on FlowJo.\n\nExperimental Design and Statistical Analysis\nTo analyze the effect of CSF1R inhibition on the physical hallmarks of EAE, female C57BL/6 animals were utilized (control: 12 animals, PLX5622 high: 16 animals, PLX5622 low: 14 animals) and pooled from 6 different experiments. These were scored for 28 days, and changes in disease score and weight were analyzed by a two-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni post-test. Peak score was recorded as the highest score reached over 28 days, cumulative score was the sum of the scores of 28 days, and statistics were determined by a two-tailed t test using GraphPad Prism. For withdrawal experiments, three animals were used per treatment group.\nFor quantification of myelination and global microglia and macrophage activation, tissue was collected from 3 or 4 animals per treatment group (control, PLX 5622 high/low) on days 9, 14, 21, and 28. Three uninjured wild-type animals were collected at day 0 as a baseline control. 6 full coronal sections from the lumbar spinal cord were stained and imaged as described above. Results were analyzed by a two-tailed t test using GraphPad Prism.\nTo investigate microglial polarization and oligodendrocyte dynamics, tissue was collected from 3 animals per treatment group (control, PLX 5622 high/low) on days 14, 21, and 28. Three uninjured wild-type animals were collected at day 0 as a baseline control. Six images from within the white matter of the lumbar spinal cord were collected following staining, and analyzed by a two-tailed t test using GraphPad Prism.\nAll results are represented as the mean with error bars indicating the standard error of the mean."

    "Methods": "Animals\nYoung adult male C57BL/6 mice, 6 weeks of age, were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed on a 12:12 hour light:dark cycle with water and food access provided\nad libitum\n. Procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Emory University protocol DAR-2003137-063018GN and Atlanta VA Medical Center protocol V008-13), and conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines and the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Experiments are reported here in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines.\n\nExperimental design\nAfter a one-week acclimatization period to the laboratory environment with handling, the mice were randomly assigned to one of four groups (n = 16/group): Sham controls given vehicle (Sham/Veh), Sham controls given ALLO (Sham/ALLO), ONC given vehicle (ONC/Veh), ONC given ALLO (ONC/ALLO). Animals were implanted with electrodes over the primary visual cortex and allowed to recover for five days before baseline recording of VEP and an optomotor response (OMR) were performed. Mice were then subjected to ONC surgery or sham operation. Following ONC, VEP were recorded on post-injury days 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, and 30. OMR was assessed on post-injury day 29. Treatment with ALLO or vehicle was administered within one hour following ONC and on post-ONC days 3, 8, 13, and 18. At the end of the experiment, subgroups of mice in each experimental condition were euthanized for immunohistochemistry and western blot. The timeline for the experiment is presented in\nFig. 1\n.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nTimeline for the experiment\nAnimals were implanted with electrodes over the primary visual cortex, allowed to recover for five days, and baseline VEP and optomotor tresponse (OMR) were recorded. The animals were then subjected to ONC surgery or sham procedure. Following ONC, VEP were recorded on post-injury days 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, and 30. OMR was assessed on post-injury day 29. Treatment with ALLO or vehicle was administered one hour following ONC and on post-ONC days 3, 8, 13, and 18. At the end of the experiment, subgroups of mice in each experimental condition were killed for immunohistochemistry and western blot. Abbreviations: BL \u2013 baseline; OMR \u2013 optomotor response; VEP \u2013 visual evoked potentials, D2 \u2013 D30 \u2013 experimental days post ONC; ALLO \u2013 allopregnanolone treatment.\nAll parts of the study were performed blind and third-party concealment of treatments with individually uniquely coded vials was applied. The order of treatments was randomized by drawing vial code numbers from a hat without replacement using a randomized block design.\n\nElectrode implantation\nMice were anesthetized with 80 mg/kg ketamine and 16 mg/kg xylazine given intraperitoneally (i.p.), and then fixed in a stereotaxic frame. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C with a heating pad. The head was shaved and wiped with chlorhexidine solution. The topical anesthetic proparacaine 1% was applied to the scalp and a midline scalp incision was made. The skull was exposed, cleaned with saline and dried. Small burr holes were made in the skull overlying the binocular visual cortex (V1b: 0.0 mm lambda anteroposterior, \u00b1 3.0 mm mediolateral), and stainless steel screws (Fine Science Tools, Heidelberg, Germany) were inserted over the V1b cortical surface in each hemisphere. A reference screw was placed over the frontal cortex. The electrodes were secured with cyanoacrylate and covered with dental cement. The animals were allowed to recover for five days before any further procedures were started.\n\nUnilateral optic nerve crush\nMice were anesthetized with 80 mg/kg ketamine and 16 mg/kg xylazine given i.p. In the left eye, a lateral incision of the conjunctiva was performed and the optic nerve exposed by blunt dissection, leaving the dura and blood supply intact. The left optic nerves were crushed using Dumont self-closing forceps N7 (Fine Science Tools) customized with a calibrating micrometer screw made by the Emory University Physics Machine Shop from plans described in\nSautter\net al\n. (1991)\n. The forceps were then used to apply pressure on the nerve for 30 sec with the jaws 0.04 mm apart, at a distance of 1 mm from the eye. At the end of the process, topical antibiotic eye ointment (Bausch and Lomb, USA) was applied to the wound. In mice subjected to the sham procedure, the nerves were exposed briefly but left intact.\n\nVEP recording and analysis\nFive days after the electrode implantations, the mice were anesthetized (80 mg/kg ketamine and 16 mg/kg xylazine, i.p.) and placed on a heating pad in front of a computer monitor. To prevent drying, eyes were lubricated with 0.9% saline drops. The signals were amplified and acquired with a bandpass filter set at 0.3 \u2013 500 Hz using the UTAS-E3000 system and software (LKC, Gaithersburg, MD, USA).\nVisual stimuli consisted of sinusoidal gratings of 100% contrast, 0.05 cycles/degree, reversal cycle 1 sec. They were presented independently to the left and right eyes in random order, in 300 stimuli per block, two blocks per eye. During the recordings a black plastic monocular patch was used to prevent stimulation of the opposite eye. To induce stimulus-selective response potentiation as described by\nFrenkel\net al\n. (2006)\n, each animal was stimulated throughout the experiment with gratings of a single orientation \u2013 vertical or horizontal \u2013 assigned randomly. Single evoked responses, 500 msec in length, were averaged for the 300-stimulus block, and peak-to-peak amplitude of the averaged VEP was calculated.\n\nMeasurement of optomotor behavior\nVisual function was tested in a virtual optomotor system (OptoMotry system; Cerebral Mechanics, Lethbridge, AB, Canada) (\nPrusky\net al\n., 2004\n;\nDouglas\net al\n., 2005\n). For visual acuity assessment, the mice were exposed to moving vertical gratings (12\u00b0/s) of 100% contrast starting at a spatial frequency of 0.003 cycles per degree and increased stepwise until the response threshold was crossed three times as described earlier (\nPrusky\net al\n., 2004\n;\nDouglas\net al\n., 2005\n). The highest spatial frequency (the smallest gratings) to elicit movement of the head in the direction of the stimulus was determined for each eye separately and considered the spatial frequency threshold.\n\nALLO administration\nThe GABA\nA\nreceptor-positive, allosteric modulator 3\u03b1-hydroxy-5\u03b1-pregnan-20-one, allopregnanolone (ALLO; Steraloids, Newport RI, USA), was dissolved in cyclodextrin (sterile water solution, 22.5%) in 1 mg/ml concentration and administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The first injection was made i.p. 1 hour after optic nerve crush to increase bioavailability. Subsequent injections were made subcutaneously on post-ONC days 3, 8, 13, and 18 to avoid immediate ALLO effects on VEP during the recording sessions. Cyclodextrin in the same volume was administered as the vehicle.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nMice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and then decapitated. Brains were quickly removed, and left and right primary visual cortices were dissected on a cold plate under a binocular microscope and the amount of protein was quantitated. Protein samples (40 \u03bcg) were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk probed with primary antibodies against VGlut2 (1:5000, AB2251, Millipore), GABA\nA\nreceptor \u03b4-subunit (1:500, AB9752, Millipore), NR2A (1:1000, AB1555P, Millipore). Beta-actin (1:10000, A5316, Sigma) was used as a loading control. The blots were incubated with appropriated peroxidase labeled secondary antibodies (1:5000, KPL) and visualized with ECL reagent followed by film exposure. Band densities were quantified using NIH ImageJ software and protein levels were normalized to \u03b2-actin. Data are presented as the fold change in protein levels relative to the Sham/Veh control group.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and microscopy\nMice were deeply anesthetized (80 mg/kg ketamine and 16 mg/kg xylazine, i.p.) and perfused with 0.1 M PBS followed by 10% formalin. The brains were removed, post-fixed overnight and cryoprotected with 30% sucrose. Fresh-frozen 10-\u03bcm cross-sections through the primary visual cortices (V1) were permeabilized in 0.1M TBS \u2013 30% Tween solution for 10 min, blocked with protein block serum-free (X0909; Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with the primary antibody raised in guinea pig against VGlut2 (AB2251: Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) diluted 1:2000 in antibody diluent (S3022; Dako). Following three washes with 0.1M TBS \u2013 30% Tween, sections were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with goat anti guinea-pig secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 (A-11075; Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; 1:200). After washing, the slides were treated with Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and coverslipped. The slides were scanned in a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Axioscope, Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Germany).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAn\na priori\npower analysis determined sample size required to detect an effect size of \u22650.50 with a power of 0.8 at alpha 0.05, based on previous experience with the mouse ONC model and the principles of the three Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement).\nStatistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0 for Windows. For VEP and OMR, the changes over time and differences among groups were evaluated with repeated and factorial measures ANOVA followed by the Greenhouse-Geisser correction for sphericity and\npost-hoc\nTukey\u2019s correction for multiple comparisons. T-tests were used for direct group comparisons. For analysis of imaging data and western blots, factorial ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s\npost-hoc\ntest for comparison among groups was used. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Pigs and tissue collection\nAll aspects of the study that involved live pigs were performed according to an established protocol (\nChoudhri et al., 2014\n;\nCaminita et al., 2015\n) that was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Memphis. All pigs used in this study shared a consistent genetic lineage, were born to sows that had been artificially inseminated using a consistent source of semen, and were pathogen-free. Preterm pigs were delivered on gestational day 105 (91% of average 115-day term) (\nChoudhri et al., 2014\n) via c-section and maintained for 10 days, until term-equivalent age, when they were euthanized for brain collection. After delivery, the pigs had an umbilical artery catheter and feeding tube placed and were individually housed in incubators. Each pig received a single dose of maternal serum (5 ml per kg via the umbilical catheter) to provide passive immunity and compensate for the lack of colostrum. The pigs received parenteral nutrition for the first 24 hours (8 ml/kg \u00d7 hour) and were then converted to enteral milk replacer (24 ml/kg every 3 hours for a total of 192 ml/kg \u00d7 day). The compositions of the parenteral nutrition solution and milk replacer were previously described (\nChoudhri et al., 2014\n) and were formulated to meet the energy and nutrient requirements of newborn pigs.\nAs controls, we used naturally born term pigs that were euthanized within 8 to 12 hours after birth. Another set of controls were pigs that were delivered at term via c-section to assess possible influence of birth mode. Since normal gestation length of the pig is 113\u2013116 days (\nTilley et al., 2007\n), we performed c-section at gestational day 113 to avoid delivery by natural birth; the pigs were euthanized immediately after the c-section.\nNone of the pigs had any evidence of compromised health or required medical interventions prior to necropsy. Upon necropsy, the entire brain was immediately removed; the cerebellum was isolated and cut into ~1 cm thick pieces and processed for immunohistochemistry, laser capture microdissection or cerebellar slice cultures. None of the pigs had evidence of brain hemorrhage or any other type of brain injury observed either during initial macroscopic brain examination or subsequent microscopic examination of cerebellar sections (>40 sections per cerebellum, including those from medial vermis, lateral vermis, and hemispheres). Animals of both sexes were analyzed.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and detection of apoptotic cells\nCerebellar tissue for immunohistochemistry was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for three days at 4\u00b0C, rinsed in cold PBS, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose, embedded in OCT and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until sagittally sectioned on a cryostat; sections were collected on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher). Slides were dried at room temperature for 20 min, rinsed in PBS three times, blocked in PBS with 0.1% triton X100 and 1% heat inactivated goat serum for 1 hour at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies and then for 1 hour at room temperature with species-appropriate Alexa fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-Calbindin (Swant, CB-38, rabbit, 1:200, RRID:AB_10000340), anti-GFAP (Dako, Z0334, rabbit, 1:200, RRID:AB_10013382), anti-Pax2 (Proteintech, 21385-1ap, rabbit, 1:200), anti-Pax6 (Covance, Prb-278p-100, rabbit, 1:350, RRID:AB_291612), anti-Ki67 (BD Pharmingem, 556003, mouse IgG, 1:250, RRID:AB_396287), anti- pH3 (AbCam, ab10543, rat 1:200, RRID:AB_2295065), anti-Tag1 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, mouse IgM, 1:5, RRID:AB_531775), anti-Doublecortin (Dcx) (Abcam, ab18723, rabbit, 1:200; RRID:AB_732011) and anti-NeuN (Millipore, Mab377, mouse IgG, 1:500; RRID:AB_2298772). Some slides were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma) to visualize cell nuclei and tissue morphology. Apoptotic cells were identified by TUNEL assay with an\nin situ\ncell death detection kit (Roche).\n\nLaser Capture Microdissection (LCM) and qRT-PCR\nFresh cerebellar pieces were placed in pre-cooled 50 ml conical tubes, frozen on crushed dry ice, then transferred to cryomolds with precooled OCT that was allowed to solidify on dry ice. The embedded tissues were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until sagittal sections were cut on a cryostat at 10 \u00b5m and collected on plain glass slides (Fisher). To identify EGL, slides were stained with RNase-free cresyl violet using the LCM staining kit (Life technologies) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Upon completion of the staining, slides were incubated in xylenes (two times, 5 min each) to completely dehydrate the tissue, dried for 5 min at room temperature and used for LCM. Microdissection was performed using an Arcturus XT LCM machine. The entire EGL (blue area in\nFig. 6A\nand\n7A\n) was microdissected from five non-adjacent sagittal sections from each cerebellum. For consistency, sections were taken from the medial vermis and were separated by 50 \u00b5m from each other.\nFigure 6. Reduced expression of genes encoding general regulators of the cell cycle - cyclins D1 and B1 in the EGL of preterm pigs.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Diagram of sagittal section of pig cerebellar vermis. From each section, entire EGL (blue area in the diagram) was isolated by LCM and assayed by qRT-PCR.\n(B\u2013F) Expression of\nCcnd1\n(encoding Cyclin D1),\nCcnb1\n(encoding Cyclin B1),\nCcna2\n(encoding Cyclin A2),\nCdkn1b\n(encoding p27Kip1) and\nCdkn2c\n(encoding p18Ink4c) in the EGL based on qRT-PCR.\nCcnd1\nand\nCcnb1\nwere significantly downregulated in the EGL of preterm pigs (***p<0.001, **p<0.01, *p<0.05). Expression of\nCcna2, Cdkn1b\nand\nCdkn2c\nwas not different between term and preterm EGL (p>0.05, NS). All quantifications were performed in n=4 naturally born term pigs, n=4 c-section born term pigs and n=6 preterm pigs. All data are mean \u00b1 sd.\nFigure 7.

Expression of\nPax6, Zic1, Zic4, Gli1, Smo\nand\nPatch1\nwas not different between term and preterm EGL (p>0.05, NS). All quantifications were performed in n=4 naturally born term pigs, n=4 c-section born term pigs and n=6 preterm pigs. All data are mean \u00b1 sd.\nTotal RNA was isolated from microdissected cells using a Pico Pure RNA isolation kit (Arcturus) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. To remove traces of genomic DNA, RNA on the columns was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen) prior to elution. RNA was reverse transcribed with iScipt\u2122 cDNA synthesis kit (Biorad) and qRT-PCR was performed to compare the expression levels of genes between preterm and term EGL. The reactions were carried out as previously described (\nCurrle et al., 2005\n;\nYoo et al., 2014\n) using a Roche LC480 Real-Time PCR machine with SYBR Fast qPCR master mix (Kapa Biosystems). All reactions were performed in triplicate. The relative abundance of each transcript was calculated using the 2-ddCT method (\nLivak et al., 2001\n) and\nGapdh\nas an internal reference. The following primers were used: Ccnd1 F: AACTACCTGGACCGCTTCCT and Ccnd1 R: GGGATGGTCTCCTTCATCTTC Ccnb1 F: GCCTCTGCTGCAACCTCTAA and Ccnb1 R: TGACTTTGTTACCGATGTCTCC Ccna2 F: TTAGGGAAATGGAGGTTA and Ccna2 R: TAGTTCACAGCCAAATGC Cdkn1b F: CTGGAGGGCAAATACGAGTG and Cdkn1b R: TGTAGTAGAACTCGGGCAAGC Cdkn2c F: CTGGTTTCGCTGTCATTCAC and Cdkn2c R: CAGCTTGAAACTCCAGCAAA Atoh1 F: GCCAGTGCAGGAGGAAAGTA and Atoh1 R: GTAATGAGAATGCGGGGAAA Pax6 F: GAGTTCTTCGCAACCTGGCTA and Pax6 R: TGGTATTCTCTCCCCCTCCTT Zic1 F: CTGAGCAGAGCAACCACATC and Zic1 R: TGGCTTTAAAGGGCTTTCC Zic4 F: CCCTTCCCCTGTCCTTTC and Zic4 R: CTCGAACTCGCACCTGAAG Ptch1 F: GCGTGGATGATGTTTTCCTT and Ptch1 R: GCTTGAGGCATTCTCCAGTC Gli1 F: CAGGGAGGAGAGCAGACTGA and Gli1 R: TCACTGCTGCAGGAGGACT Smo1 F: CAGCAAGATCAACGAGACCA and Smo1 R: GTGGCAGCTGAAAGTGATGA Jag1 F: ACATAGCCCGAAACAGTAGC and Jag1 R: GTTGTAGCAGGGATGAGGAC Gapdh F: ACCCAGAAGACTGTGGATGG and Gapdh R: AAGCAGGGATGATGTTCTGG\n\nCerebellar slices\nOrganotypic cerebellar slice cultures were essentially performed as previously described (\nEnglund et al., 2006\n;\nDaza et al., 2007\n). Cerebellar vermis blocks were embedded in 4% low melting agarose in Krebs buffer and sliced sagittally on a vibratome at 300 \u00b5m. Slices were placed on Millicell cell culture inserts (0.4 \u00b5m pore size) (Millipore) floating on DMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, glucose and pan/strep, and incubated in a CO\n2\nincubator (at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\n) for 1 hour. Then, the medium was exchanged for serum-free neurobasal/B27 medium (Invitrogen) with or without 10 nM human recombinant Jag1 protein or with 0.4 \u00b5m/ml mouse Shh protein (both R&D Systems). After incubating for 24 hours, slices were rinsed in PBS, fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for 1.5 hours at 4\u00b0C, cryoprotected with sucrose, embedded in OCT on dry ice, sectioned on a cryostat and used for cerebellar tissue analysis as described above.\n\nCell counts\nPax6+, Ki67+, NeuN+, and Pax2+ cells and GFAP+ Bergmann glial fibers were counted in 20 \u00b5m-thick immunostained sections using the optical fractionator technique. For this purpose, Z-stacks of optical sections at a step of 1 \u00b5m were taken using a Zeiss-710 confocal microscope and analyzed using Stereo Investigator Software (Version 11) (MicroBrightfield). The numbers of Pax6+, Ki67+ and NeuN+ cells were evaluated in 100 \u00b5m-long 15 \u00b5m-wide boxes encompassing the entire thickness of the EGL, (\nSupplemental Fig. 1A\n). The dissector height was 15 \u00b5m. The numbers of Pax2+ interneurons and GFAP+ Bergmann glial fibers were evaluated in 300 \u00b5m-long 200 \u00b5m-wide (Pax2+ cells) or 200 \u00b5m-long 200 \u00b5m-wide (GFAP+ fibers) boxes encompassing the entire thickness of the ML (\nSupplemental Fig. 1B\n). In addition to the EGL, NeuN+ cells were also counted in the IGL, in 200 \u00b5m-long 200 \u00b5m-wide boxes (\nFig. 5B, C\n. The dissector height was 15 \u00b5m for counting Pax2+ cells and NeuN+ IGL cells, and 12 \u00b5m for counting GFAP+ fibers. Guard zones of 10% of the section\u2019s thickness were placed at the top and bottom of each Z-stack to account for damage during sectioning. Counting frames were randomly placed by the Stereo Investigator program. Cells within each frame were counted throughout the dissector height as previously described (\nGlaser et al., 2007\n), generating an estimate of the number of positive cells per 100 \u00b5m \u00d7 15 \u00b5m \u00d7 15 \u00b5m segments of the EGL (for Pax6+, Ki67+, and NeuN+ cells), per 300 \u00b5m \u00d7 200 \u00b5m \u00d7 15 \u00b5m segments of the ML (for Pax2+ ML interneurons), per 200 \u00b5m \u00d7 200 \u00b5m \u00d7 12 \u00b5m segments of the ML (for GFAP+ Bergmann glial fibers) or per 200 \u00b5m \u00d7 200 \u00b5m \u00d7 15 \u00b5m segments of the IGL (for NeuN+ neurons). The number of neurons in the IGL in lobes III and VIII (\nFig. 5F, I\nwas calculated by multiplying density of NeuN+ IGL cells (determined by cell counts in 200 \u00b5m \u00d7 200 \u00b5m \u00d7 15 \u00b5m segments) and IGL volume in corresponding lobes in each section.\nFigure 5. Reduced number of NeuN+ neurons in the IGL of preterm pigs.\nOpen in a new tab\nQuantification of NeuN+ neurons in the IGL of lobes III and VIII in preterm pigs relative to naturally born term controls. Panels D, E and G, H show NeuN-stained IGL that corresponds to the regions boxed in adjacent diagrams B and C. (B, C) EGL-external granule cell layer, PC-Purkinje cell layer, IGL \u2013 internal granule cell layer. Diagrams B and C correspond to the regions depicted by red boxes in panel A.\n(F, I) There was reduced number of NeuN+ neurons in the IGL in both lobe III and lobe VIII in preterm pigs relative to naturally born term controls. *p<0.05. All quantifications were performed in n=4 pigs per group. All data are mean \u00b1 sd.\nScale bar: 100 \u00b5m.\nThe numbers of Calb+ Purkinje cells, pH3+ and TUNEL+ EGL cells, and the width of Tag1+ and Dcx+ layers were evaluated using 12 \u00b5m-thick antibody stained sections, which were photographed using a Zeiss A2 fluorescent microscope. Purkinje cells were counted along a line drawn parallel to the Purkinje cell layer. The number of Purkinje cells was calculated in term and preterm cerebella per 500 \u00b5m of the Purkinje cell layer, as previously described (\nHaldipur et al, 2011\n). The diameter of Purkinje cells was measured in 30 randomly selected Purkinje cells in the anterior and posterior cerebellum. The numbers of mitotic pH3+ and apoptotic TUNEL+ cells were measured per 1 mm of the EGL as previously described (\nZhang et al., 2015\n;\nFauquier et al., 2014\n). For consistency, sections used for both unbiased stereological cell counts and regular cell counts were from the medial cerebellar vermis. For each marker, three to five non-adjacent immunostained sections were analyzed per cerebellum or\nin vitro\nslice. Each slice was obtained from an individual cerebellum.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAt least four cerebella or slices from each group were studied. All data are presented as the mean \u00b1 sd. Statistical significance between two groups was determined using two-tailed t-test. Statistical analysis of multiple groups was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test with Statistica software (version 10), (Tulsa, OK, USA). p<0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMice were housed in microisolator cages on a 12-h light/dark cycle, and were given food and water ad libitum. All procedures were in compliance with the University of Missouri and University of California San Diego Animal Care and Use Committees and with all local and federal laws governing the humane treatment of animals.\n\nNerve demyelination by Ethidium bromide injection\nFor demyelination experiments all mice used were 1 month old. Mice were placed under isoflurane anesthesia and the left sciatic nerve was exposed via an incision in the flank followed by separation of underlying musculature by blunt dissection. Utilizing pulled microcapillary needles 2 \u03bcL of 0.1% ethidium bromide in normal saline was injected into the middle third of the exposed sciatic nerve to induce demyelination. Uninjected controls received only a sham operation, but no injection. Saline injected animals received an injection of normal saline. The mice were allowed to recover and placed back in their cage. Successful injection of 2\u03bcL of 0.1% ethidium bromide into the sciatic nerve was confirmed by a change in color of the nerve compared to the uninjected and saline injected controls. Seven days after injection, the animals injected with ethidium bromide displayed loss of function of the injected nerve, which is consistent with affected nerve function after an injury (\nVillalon et al., 2015\n). Furthermore, gross examination of the nerves at 7 days post-injected showed inflammation and discoloration of the ethidium bromide injected nerve, consistent with nerve demyelination (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n). Sciatic nerves were collected for analysis at three different time points; maximal demyelination point, at 7 days post-injection; beginning of remyelination, 14 days post-injection; and complete remyelination point, 30 days post-injection (\nBondan et al., 2009\n;\nBondan and Monteiro Martins Mde, 2013\n;\nRiet-Correa et al., 2002\n). For detailed analysis of nerves after ethidium bromide injection, Swiss Webster mice were treated as described above. Seven days after injection, mice were killed by anesthetic overdose and decapitation and the sciatic nerve distal to the injection site removed into 2.5% glutaraldehyde before processing to resin blocks exactly as described elsewhere (Jolivalt et al. 2016) and viewing via a light microscope.\n\nDetection and quantification of NF proteins by immunoblotting\nSciatic nerves (demyelination experiments) and L5 motor and sensory roots were harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or were homogenized immediately. Tissues were homogenized on ice in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8, and protease inhibitors were added according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. (Complete Mini, Roche, Mannheim, Germany). An equal volume of lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 2% SDS was added. The homogenates were sonicated for 10 seconds 2X, then boiled for 10 minutes in a sand bath, and clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 minutes. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Protein extracts (5\u03bcg) were resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane or stained with Coomassie-blue. NF-L, NF-M and NF-H were identified with polyclonal antibodies. Phosphorylated NF-H and NF-M were identified using a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes the protein in a phospho-dependent manner (SMI-31, Covance, Emeryville, CA, USA). Mouse and chicken primary antibodies were detected with donkey anti-mouse and goat anti-chicken secondary antibodies conjugated to IRdye-700X\u00ae infrared fluorophores (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA, USA) respectively. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by infrared detection with an Odyssey image scanner (LICOR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). Quantification of immunoblots was performed by the relative optical density (ROD) method. Absolute intensities of the immunoreactive bands were obtained using Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc.) and RODs were calculated in the following manner: [(NF protein mean intensity \u2013 background mean intensity)*(number of pixels)]/[(loading control band mean intensity - background intensity)*(number of pixels)]. As loading control the intensity of the smear on the coomassie stained gels was used as the stain intensity directly correlates with the amount of protein loaded in the gel. Optical densities of immunoreactive bands were calculated as follows: [(absolute intensity \u2013 background intensity)*(number of pixels)] Average optical densities for each genotype were calculated and compared to the wild type averages, which were arbitrarily set to a value of 1. All optical densities were analyzed for statistical significance by one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post hoc analysis for pair wise comparisons or by a Student\u2019s\nt-\ntest (SigmaPlot, Systat Software).\n\nAntibodies used\nAll antibodies used in this study are commercially available. No in-house produced antibodies were used. CPCA (Chicken Polyclonal Antibody)-NF-L, CPCA-NF-M, CPCA-NF-H, and CPCA-MBP antibodies were obtained from EnCor Biotechnology, Gainesville, FL, USA. CPCA-NF-M and CPCA-NF-H were both made against the KE region of NF-M and NF-H and detect both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated NFs (\nHarris et al., 1991\n;\nShaw et al., 2005\n). SMI-31 anitbodies were obtained from BioLegend, San Diego, CA. SMI-31 is a monoclonal antibody that reacts with a phosphorylated epitope in phosphorylated neurofilament H and neurofilament M (\nSternberger and Sternberger, 1983\n).\n\nTeased fiber analysis\nMice were sacrificed and the sciatic nerve was exposed by blunt dissection (for demyelination experiments) and immediately extracted and processed as subsequently described. For L5 root teased fibers experiments, the mice were transcardially perfused with 0.1M PBS, pH 7.4 for no more than 5 minutes. The L5 root was dissected. The dorsal root was shortened relative to the ventral root for easy identification. In all cases the nerves or roots were submersion fixed in a 2.5M glutaraldehyde, 0.025M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.38 solution for 25 min at 4\u00b0C. The nerves or roots were then rinsed in 1X PBS for 5 minutes and transferred to a saturated solution of Sudan black in 70% ethanol and allowed to incubate for 1 hr at room temperature. The samples were then rinsed twice in 70% ethanol for 5 min and transferred to a 10% glycerin solution. Fifty to one hundred axon bundles were separated from the ventral root and the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve. The bundle was transferred to a super frost microscope slide containing a thin layer of a 10% aqueous solution of glycerin: BSA (1:1). Individual fibers were teased apart from the bundle and laid out on the glass slide. Fibers were then allowed to dry overnight on a 50\u00b0C hot plate. Digital photos of the fibers were taken using the AxioVision Digital Image Processing Software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). Internode lengths were measured using ImageJ (NIH). At least 200 internodes were measured from each tissue sample and at least 3 animals were used per genotype and treatment. An average of the internode lengths for each genotype was calculated and used for statistical analyses. The data was analyzed for variability using the SAS analytics software (SAS Institute Inc.). Possible influential outliers were calculated using a CooksD test and the data was analyzed for statistical significance using one-way nested ANOVA.\n\nSite directed mutagenesis and construction of NF-M\nS\u2192E\nmice by gene replacement\nA genomic clone isolated from mouse 129 SVJ library was used for construction of NF-M\nS\u2192E\n[a generous gift from J. P. Julien ]. A ~1.1 kb\nAcc\nI/\nBcl\nI fragment, containing all KSP repeats, was subcloned into pBluescript KS. Five oligonucleotides were designed to convert the phosphorylated KSP serine residues to glutamate (\nSupplementary Fig. 2A\n) using a PCR approach as previously described (\nGarcia et al., 2009\n). DNA sequence analysis confirmed the substitution of the 7 serine codons with glutamate codons without the introduction of additional sequence changes (data not shown). The modified NF-M fragment was recloned back into the\nnefm\ngene.\nNefm\n5\u2019 UTR and 3\u2019 UTR regions were amplified from mouse 129SvEv genomic DNA to increase homology from 5 kb to a total of 8 kb. Diphtheria toxin alpha gene with poly adenylation (DT-ApA) clone was a generous gift from Y. Yanagawa and T. Yagi (\nYanagawa et al., 1999\n). DT-ApA was introduced at the 3\u2019 end of the construct as a negative selection marker. Finally, the\nnefl\n3\u2019 UTR and a PKG Neo cassette were cloned at the 3\u2019 end of\nnefm\nexon 3 (inserted at the\nSal\nI and\nMlu\nI sites, which were cloned into the\nnefm\n3\u2019 UTR using a linker) (\nSupplementary Fig. 2B\n). The targeting construct was linearized with\nAat\nII and electroporated into mouse 129SvEv ES cells (Millipore Corporation) by the MU Transgenic Core and selected with G418 at 250\u03bcg/ml (\nJoyner, 1994\n). Drug resistant colonies were amplified and screened by PCR at the 3\u2019 end and by Southern Blot at the 5\u2019 end. DNA sequence analysis (MU DNA Core) was used to ensure incorporation of the\nnefm\nS\u2192E\nexon 3. Four out of the 192 ES clones were identified to have undergone homologous recombination at both the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends of the gene to produce the NF-M\nS\u2192E\ntargeted allele. One of the positive ES cell clones was injected into mouse C57Bl6 blastocysts, and the MU Transgenic Core implanted blastocysts into the uteri of pseudo-pregnant surrogates. Six chimeric male mice were identified from the surrogates. Germ line transmission of the NF-M\nS\u2192E\nallele was confirmed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA purified from tail biopsies using Invitrogen Taq (Clonentech Laboratories, Inc., A Takara Bio Company, Madison, WI, USA) with the following primers: NF-M Exon 3 Forward-5\u2019TGCAGAGGGAGAAGAAAGGAGAGGA3\u2019, NF-M 3\u2019UTR Reverse Primer-5\u2019AACTGGCGAATCCCTAGGTACAT3\u2019, NF-L 3\u2019UTR Reverse Primer-5\u2019GTTGACCTGATTGGGGAGAA3\u2019. Mice of either sex were bred to homozygocity and wild type littermates were used as controls (\nSupplementary Fig. 2C\n).\n\nNerve conduction velocity measurements\nNerve conduction velocities were measured in the sciatic nerve, interossseus muscle system of 6-month-old as previously described (\nJolivalt et al., 2009\n). In brief, mice were anesthetized with halothane (4% in O2 for induction, 2-3% for maintenance) with body temperature maintained at 37 \u00b0C by a heating lamp and thermal pad connected to a temperature regulator and a rectal thermistor probe. The sciatic nerve was stimulated with single supramaximal square wave pulses (4-8 V and 0.05 ms duration) via fine needle electrodes placed at the sciatic notch and Achilles tendon. Evoked early (M waves) and late (H waves) responses were recorded from the interossseus muscles of the ipsilateral foot via two fine needle electrodes and displayed on a digital storage oscilloscope. The distance between the two sites of stimulation was measured using calipers, and motor sciatic nerve conduction velocity was calculated using the M wave response and sensory sciatic nerve conduction velocity using the H wave response as previously described (\nJolivalt et al., 2009\n). Measurements were made in triplicate from a minimum of six animals per genotype, and the median was used as the measure of velocity. Values were compared for overall statistical significance by a Student\u2019s\nt-\ntest (InSat, GraphPad Software, la Jolla, CA, USA).\n\nTissue preparation for axon morphometry\nMice were euthanized and perfused transcardially with a fixative solution of 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, and pos\nt-\nfixed overnight in the same buffer. Fifth lumbar nerve roots were dissected, treated with 2% osmium tetroxide, washed, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon-Araldite resin. Thick sections (0.75 \u03bcm) for light microscopy were stained with \u03c1-phenylenediamine. Images of transverse sections of L5 motor axons were collected with a Zeiss Axio Imager A1 light microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Jena, Germany) and analyzed in at least five mice per genotype and age group. Entire roots were imaged, imaging thresholds were selected individually, and the cross-sectional area of each axon was calculated and reported as a diameter of a circle of equivalent area using the AxioVision Digital Image Processing Software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). The total number of axons was analyzed for statistical significance by a two-way ANOVA (SigmaPlot, Systat Software, Inc.). Axonal diameters were grouped into 0.5 \u03bcm bins. Diameter distributions for 2-month-old motor axons were analyzed for overall statistical significance by a Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest. Diameter distributions for 6-month-old motor and 2 and 6-month-old sensory axons were analyzed for statistical significance by a two-way ANOVA. G-ratios were calculated by measuring the axonal diameter and fiber diameter of individual axons for at least 10% of all axons per root (~ 100 axons for motor and ~250 axons for sensory) using AxioVision Digital Image Processing Software (Carl Zeiss Micro imaging). G-ratios were analyzed for statistical significance by a Student\u2019s\nt-\ntest (SigmaPlot, Systat Software, Inc.).\n\nBalance beam\nMice were trained 5 days to walk on three progressively smaller circular wooden beams (5, 2.5 and 1cm diameter) 120 cm in length, suspended 50 cm from a bedding surface. During training, mice walked on each of the three beams for 3 minutes with at least 20 minutes of rest. After training, experiments were performed on the smallest beam, which was marked in 5 cm increments. Mice walking on the beam were recorded using a digital camera for three trials per day for three consecutive days (9 total trials) with at least 20 minutes of rest between trials. Trials were recorded from two camera angles, parallel to the beam (6 trials) and perpendicular to the beam (3 trials). The number of falls, number of foot slips, total time walking, and the latency to fall within the 3-minute trials were scored from all 9 trials recorded. A fall was considered any event when the mouse fell off the beam, hanging under the beam was not considered a fall. Foot slips were events when the hind limbs of the mouse slipped off the surface of the beam. The total amount of time spent walking was measured from the beginning of a walking event to the end of that walking event. The total time walking per trial was calculated by adding the time of all individual walking events within a trial and it was used to normalize the number of falls and foot slips. Falling latency was calculated by measuring the time the mouse spent walking before each fall, therefore only mice that fell were included in this measurement. Average distance walked was calculated from the three perpendicular angle videos by using the 5 cm increment marks. To calculate the average walking speed, the time spent walking in the three perpendicular angle videos was also measured and together with the average distance walked was used to calculate the average velocity. The reported average time walked was also measured only from the three perpendicular angle videos. Averages of all observations were calculated for each genotype and analyzed for statistical significance by a Student\u2019s\nt-\ntest.\n\nThermal algesia response latency\nLatency response to noxious heat stimulus was measured as previously described (\nCalcutt, 2004\n). In brief, mice were placed on the warmed glass top surface of the testing apparatus and allowed to acclimate for 30 min. A mobile heating source was placed under the center of the hind paws and turned on. Turning on the heating source activated a timer and the heating source that locally heated the glass surface. When the animal responded to the stimulus by withdrawing its paw, movement sensors stopped the timer and the heating source. The time to response was recorded. Four measurements were taken for each paw with at least 5 min of rest between measurements. Both hind paws were tested and the average response time of both paws was used to calculate an average response for each mouse. Average response time across genotypes was analyzed for statistical significance by a Student\u2019s\nt\n-test.\n\nTactile algesia response threshold\nThreshold response to tactile algesia was measured with a Dynamic Plantar Aesthesiometer (DPA) model # 37450 (Ugo Basile, Italy). Mice were set on a wire-mesh platform and allowed to habituate for at least 15 min. After habituation, the DPA monitored paw withdrawal thresholds of the hind and front paws. A metal filament was pushed against the hind and front paws with an ascending linear force (10 g/s and 2 g/s, respectively) until a strong, immediate withdrawal occurred. Measurements were taken in triplicate and averages were reported as paw withdrawal thresholds in grams. Averages for each paw were analyzed for statistical significance by a Student\u2019s\nt-\ntest."

    "Methods": "Animal groups\nAll animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All animal protocols were approved by the City College Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Adult female Sprague Dawley rats weighing between 225\u2013275 grams were housed under a 12 h light/dark cycle in the institutional vivarium and provided with water and food. All surgeries were performed under general anesthesia (90mg/kg ketamine, 10mg/kg xylazine) administered intraperitoneally in aseptic condition.\n\nAnterograde labeling of CST axons\nRats were anaesthetized and placed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments). Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C by a heating blanket. Following craniotomy to expose the forelimb primary MCX, 7 pressure injections (300\u03b7L/each) of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA; 10,000 MW; Molecular Probes; 10% in 0.1M PBS) were made in the forelimb MCX (depth 1.5mm, lateral 2.5 to 3.5mm; rostral: 0.5 to 2.5mm; separated by 0.5mm each injection site) using a Hamilton syringe (33 gauge needle). Tracer was injected using a micropump (WPI). Animals survived for two weeks.\n\nElectrode implantation and stimulation\nAfter completing tracer injections, a stainless steel stimulating electrode was placed over the dura covering the forelimb MCX (\nBrus-Ramer et al., 2007\n). The electrode wires were bent into an \u201cL\u201d shape with the bottom of the L deinsulated. We placed the angle of the L-shaped electrodes 2mm and 3.5mm lateral to bregma, respectively, with the exposed contact extending rostrally over the forelimb M1. To confirm electrode placement, we stimulated the MCX to provoke a motor response. A constant current stimulator (A\u2013M systems) was used to deliver trains of stimuli (0.2msec duration, 333Hz, 45msec, every 2 seconds). We adjusted the current to the minimal value to evoke a contralateral forelimb movement, which was typically (1.1 to 2 mAmps); no ipsilateral forelimb movement was observed. The electrode was secured using microscrews (Plastics One) and dental acrylic cement.\nRats were stimulated 6 hours/day for either one or ten days (\nBrus-Ramer et al., 2007\n;\nCarmel et al., 2010\n) using the same stimulation parameters described above. Animals were awake for daily stimulation and were attached to the stimulator via a commutator (Plastics One) to prevent the wires from twisting as they moved about the cage. Initial threshold current for stimulation to evoke forelimb movement was determined and stimulation continued at this current for the duration of the 6 h period. For our 10-day stimulation, the threshold current was checked daily. Whereas there were day-to-day fluctuations (e.g., in the range of 0.1 \u2013 0.3 mAmp), we did not observe a trend to higher or lower thresholds.\n\nPathway blockade\nThe functional requirement of the mTOR and the JAK/STAT pathways in CST sprouting and CST synapse formation were examined by blocking these pathways separately. We used rapamycin (10mg/kg, IP, every 48 hours; LC Labs) to block mTOR signaling (\nPark et al 2008\n) and AG490 (20mg/kg, IP, daily; LC Labs) to block JAK/STAT signaling (\nIwamaru et al., 2007\n).\n\nWestern blotting\nFor Western blotting and quantitative PCR, animals were euthanized within 30 minutes after cessation of stimulation. The stimulated and non-stimulated MCXs were dissected into ice cold HBBS (Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution; Invitrogen). The forelimb M1 region was placed in a microtube and homogenized promptly in N-PER buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with a protease-inhibiting cocktail (Invitrogen). Bradford protein analysis was carried out in order to measure protein concentration and approximately 50 \u00b5g of protein was subjected to SDS-acrylamide-bisacrylamide gel electrophoreses along with a protein ladder (Crystalgen) for size comparison. Following electrophoresis, the protein bands were transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore) and probed against the primary antibodies. An ECL chemiluminescent system (Cell Signaling Technology) was used to develop the Western blots. The following primary antibodies were used: phos-S6 (S235/S236) at 1:1000; total S6 at 1:1000; phos-Stat3 (Y705) at 1:500; total Stat3 at 1:1000 (Cell Signaling Technology); phos-PTEN (S380) at 1:500; total PTEN at 1:1000 (Santa Cruz Biotech); and GAPDH at1:5000 (Sigma Aldrich). Secondary antibodies include anti-mouse and anti-rabbit at 1:10,1000) (Vector Laboratories).\n\nReverse transcription and quantitative PCR\nAnimals were euthanized within 30 minutes after cessation of stimulation. The stimulated and non-stimulated M1 were dissected into ice cold HBBS (Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution; Invitrogen). The forelimb M1 region was homogenized in TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) and total mRNA was isolated following the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. cDNA was reversetranscribed from total RNA with a cDNA synthesis kit (OriGene). The primers used for PCR amplification of rat Survivin were Fwd 5\u2019- ACTGCCCTACCGAGAATGAG -3\u2019 and Rvrs 5\u2019- ACGGTCAGTTCTTCCACCTG -3\u2019 and GAPDH forward 5\u2019- AAGTGGACATTGTTGCCATC-3\u2019 and reverse 5\u2019-CATACTCAGCACCAGCATCA-3\u2019. An equal amount of cDNA template was used for each PCR reaction. A SYBR green/DNA polymerase PCR kit was used (Roche) to carry out quantitative PCR reactions in a thermocycler (Eppendorf Realplex). Values obtained from SYBR green count were recorded, transcript levels were normalized against rat GAPDH signal and results were reported as relative increase in mRNA expression in reference to control values (\nLivak and Schmittgen, 2001\n).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAnimals were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The cervical spinal cord and brain were dissected, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 to 2 hours and transferred to 20% sucrose (overnight at 4 \u00b0C). Frozen sections were cut transversely at 40 \u00b5m thickness using a sliding microtome. BDA was visualized with 1% avidin\u2013biotin complex reagent (ABC kit; Vector Laboratories), followed by the chromogen diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma) or streptavidin\u2013FITC conjugate. Primary antibodies used in immunofluorescence staining include: vGlut1 at1:10 (NeuroMab); phos-S6 (S235/S236) at 1:1000 (Cell Signaling Technology); Survivin at 1:400 (Cell Signaling Technology); NeuN at 1:1000 (EMD Millipore) and cFos at 1:1000 (Cell Signaling Technology). Several different commercial antisera against pStat3/Y705 were tried but failed to produce immunostaining in our hands; thus, we decided to examine the levels of Survivin (\nSehara et al., 2013\n), a direct transcriptional target of pStat3, to assess pStat3 activity in stimulated MCX neurons. Appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to FITC, Cy3 or Cy5 were used. DAPI (Cell Signlaing Technology) nuclear staining was done at final concentration of 1\u03b7g/\u00b5l. Sections were visualized and imaged digitally using a Zeiss LSM 710 or 880 meta confocal microscope.\n\nSpinal cord CST presynaptic site determination\nSpinal cord sections at the C7 level were fluorescently-labeled for BDA and vGlut1 and photographed using a confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM 710). Z-interval feature was used to capture ipsilateral CST gray matter axons. Photographs were taken at 40\u00d7 magnification, with a frame size of 512\u00d7512 and 0.42\u00b5m pixel size. Image J (NIH) was used to determine BDA labeled axon length and the number of pre-synaptic boutons, which was determined by the presence of BDA and VGlut1 colocalization.\n\nStereological quantification of pathway activation in cells and neurons\nIn order to obtain quantitative estimates of the density of cells in the motor cortex and/or the spinal cord expressing cFos and markers for mTOR and Jak/Stat signaling pathways, we used the unbiased stereological method, the optical fractionator (\nWest et al., 1991\n), and StereoInvestigator software (MBF). cFos, NeuN, pS6, DAPI and Survivin-positive cells were counted on 4 to 6 randomly-chosen sections from 3 to 7 animals, depending on the analysis, at 200\u00d7 magnification. Sections containing DAB staining were counted directly under the microscope. Fluorescently-labeled sectioned were imaged first at 200\u00d7 magnification, and then counts were obtained from the micrographs to prevent photo-bleaching, similar to our earlier study (\nChakrabarty et al., 2009\n). Counts were made using a grid size of 300 and frame size of 300 and on a region of interest basis. We counted cells, across all animals, in the portion of the forelimb M1 under and adjacent to the stimulating or sham electrode. Cell densities were calculated using the unbiased cell count estimate and the volume of each section obtained from the StereoInvestigator software.\n\nAnatomical data acquisition and analysis of ipsilateral CS axon terminations\nThe Neurolucida tracing system (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT) was used to measure axon length and varicosity number. These measurements were then used to create topographic density maps to determine changes in ipsilateral axon terminations. Axon length and varicosity number were measured in five transverse sections for each animal by laboratory personnel blinded to animal group. For construction of topographic density maps (\u201cheat maps\u201d), digital tracings of individual sections were corrected for orientation and aligned with one another according to fiduciary marks (intersection between the gray matter above the central canal and the dorsal median septum) before being exported and quantified using custom programs written in Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA), as previously reported (\nBrus-Ramer et al., 2007\n).\n\nRetrograde labeling of CST neurons\nWe retrogradely labeled CST neurons with tetramethyl rhodamine (TMR, Invitrogen) for identification. 10 to 12 injections were made unilaterally in the C5\u2013C8 segments. Injections were separated by 1 mm rostrocaudally and made using a micropump (WPI). Each injection was 300\u03b7l at a depth of 0.9 mm and 0.5 mm away from the dorsal roots and towards the midline. All animals were allowed to survive for two weeks post-injection. Injections produced robust contralateral retrograde labeling. As in previous studies, ipsilateral labeling was sparse (\nUmeda and Isa, 2011\n). Analysis was performed on ipsilateral-projecting CST neurons.\n\nCST Neuron Volume Determination\nCST neuron volume was examined stereologically from high resolution confocal micrographs of neurons using Nucleator (MBF Bioscience). The Optical Fractionator program (MBF Bioscience) was used for random sampling of target CST neurons. Four rays were used and the points where the rays intersected with the edge of neuron were marked and the program generated an estimated cellular volume. Approximately 75 CST neurons were sampled per animal and 3 animals were used per group. Analyses were conducted by laboratory personnel blinded to animal group.\n\nStatistics and general data analyses\nAnatomical measurements were performed by laboratory staff blinded to animal group. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software), Excel (Microsoft) and KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). The differences between groups were performed using either Mann-Whitney T-Test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc, Dunnett\u2019s and Sidak\u2019s multiple comparison tests."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal experiments were done in compliance with approved animal policies of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at CWRU University. Floxed\nCdk5\nand\nCNP\nCre/+\nmouse breeding pairs were obtained from Dr. LH Tsai (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)\nand\nDr. K.A. Nave (Max Planck Institute, Germany) respectively. To produce conditional knockout of CNP\nCre/+\n;Cdk5\nfl/fl\nCKO mice (CNP;Cdk5 CKO), floxed\nCdk5\nfl/fl\nmice\nwere crossed with double-transgenic\nCNP\nCre/+\n;Cdk5\nfl/+\nmice as previously described (\nLuo et al., 2014\n) and genotyped using tailed genomic DNA PCR (\nLappe-Siefke et al., 2003\n;\nLuo et al., 2014\n). For comparative experiments,\nCNP\nCre/+\n;\nCdk5\nfl/fl\nanimals are used as CNP;Cdk5 CKO; and sex- and age-matched animals of heterozygotes\nCNP\nCre/+\n;Cdk5\n+/+\nserved as controls as they had no detectable phenotype. The animals were generated and maintained on a C57BL/6 background and housed in a vivarium with a 12 -h light/dark cycle. No more than 4 adult mice were housed in the same cage. Mice of both sexes were used with littermate controls unless otherwise indicated.\n\nBehavior tests\nAt least a 16\u201318 group of sex- and age-matched (8 weeks) controls and CNP;Cdk5 CKO animals were used for cognitive functional tests including: learning and memory (T-maze, passive avoidance test and contextual fear conditioning), motor function (open field and rotarod test) and anxiety test (elevated plus maze). All tests were conducted in a blinded fashion at the Case Rodent Animal Behavior Core and performed during the light phase. In the first week, the mice underwent rotarod test on day 1, open field assayed on day 3 and elevated plus maze on day 5. In the second week, the mice were subjected to the T-maze on day 1 and passive avoidance test on day 3. In the third week, the mice underwent contextual fear conditioning test. To minimize stresses, animals were transported and acclimated to a testing room 2 hours before the tests. All test apparatus was cleaned with 5% ethanol to avoid instinctive odorant between animals.\nT-maze test\nA clear-plexiglass T-maze apparatus (with 60 cm length of arms) was used and recorded using Ethovision video tracking system. A tested animal was placed in the apparatus with one blocked arm and allowed to explore the maze freely for 10 min. To avoid any arm preference bias, the blocked arm was switched randomly between tested animals. After 10 minutes the test mouse was returned to the home -cage for 3h before being placed back in T-maze with two opened arms for 5min. The time spent and the frequency in the previously blocked arm, and the total number of arm entry were recorded indicating a challenge for short-term spatial memory of hippocampal and forebrain function.\nPassive avoidance test\nA two-compartment step-through passive avoidance apparatus was used to evaluate memory based contextual fear conditioning and instrumental learning memory (\nOgren et al., 1985\n). A decrease in retention latency indicates impaired memory. On training day 1, mice were placed into the light compartment and allowed to freely explore light and dark chambers. On the following day 2, the animal was placed in the light compartment and when it stepped into the dark compartment, the inter-compartment door closed and a foot shock (0.5 mA/2 sec) delivered. The mouse was returned to the home cage after 1 min in the dark. The time taken to enter the dark compartment (training latency) was recorded. On the day 3 (24 hours after the acquisition trial), in the retention trial, animals were placed in the illuminated compartment without foot shock and the step-through latency recorded (maximum a cutoff time of 300s) and used as an index of retention of learned experiences.\nContextual and Cued Fear Conditioning Test\nThe contextual fear-conditioning test was performed as previous described (\nYu et al., 2014\n). In the training phase on day 1, an individual mouse was placed in a conditioning chamber (Med Associates, Burlington, VT) equipped with stainless grids and allowed to explore freely for 2 min (preconditioned phase). A tone (80dB, 2800 Hz) was presented as a conditioned stimulus for 30 sec, and a foot shock (0.5mA, 2 sec) was delivered as an unconditional stimulus through a shock generator 2.5 sec after the tone stimulus. A total of 4 tone-shock pairs were repeated and the mouse-freezing response recorded. After 24 hours, retention tests were performed with mice placed into the conditioning chamber and the freezing response recorded for 5 min in the absence of the tone. Two hours after the contextual freezing was measured, mice were introduced in the contextually altered chamber with flatted plastic floor for 6 minutes. During the first 3 minutes, freezing response was measured in the absence of the tone; and in the remaining 3 minutes, the tone stimulus was delivered and freezing behavior measured to assess cued fear conditioning.\nOpen Field Test\nSpontaneous motor activity was assessed in a bright and illuminated wooden, square, arena. Mice were placed in the center of the clear arena in standard room-lighting conditions for evaluation of locomotor activity. The total distance travelled was tracked and quantitated by a video EthoVision system for 15-min test period. The number of entries, the time spent in the center zone and the total distance traveled were monitored.\nRotarod test\nMotor learning and motor coordination were evaluated with the accelerating-rotarod test. Controls and CNP;Cdk5 CKO mice were kept in their home cages and acclimate in the testing room for at least 15 min. In training phase, mice were placed on the rotarod with a constantly speed at 4rpm walking forward for 60 sec. All animals were given a session consisting of three training trails with a 10 min inter -trial interval and at least a 30 min break between training and testing phases. In the test phase, the speed of the rotarod gradually accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm within 5 min. The latency and speed of each mouse falling off from the rotarod was recorded. Three test trials were performed and recorded with at least 30 min inter-trial intervals.\nElevated Plus-Maze Test\nThe elevated plus-maze apparatus consisted of total four arms of equal dimensions (50cm \u00d7 10cm). Two arms were enclosed by 40-cm-high blocks and were arranged perpendicularly to two opposite open arms. Following acclimatization an individual mouse was placed in the center of the maze facing an open arm. Entries and time spent in the open arm were recorded for 5 min using a video system and used as measures of anxiety-like behavior.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were anaesthetized with Avertin and perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Dissected optic nerves and brain were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4\u00b0C and 20\u03bcm frozen sections of optic nerve (longitudinal) and brain sections (coronal) collected. For immunohistochemistry, antigen retrieval was applied with reveal decloaker solution (Biocare Medical). Sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. Primary antibodies include: MBP (SMI-99, 1:500, Covance); Olig2 (AB9610, Millipore, 1:250) and GFAP (MAB360, Millipore, 1:250); CC1 (OP80, Millipore, 1:250); Iba1 (019-19741, WAKO, 1:250); Caspr (MABN69, Millipore, 1:100); Na\nv\n1.6 (ASC-009, Alomone Labs, 1:100) and K\nv\n1.1 (APC-009, Alomone Labs, 1:100); Neurofilament 200 (N4142, Sigma, 1:250); Cre (#69050-3, Novagen, 1:250); NeuN (ab104224, Abcam, 1:250); Cdk5(sc-173, Santa Cruz, 1:200); NG2 (AB5320, Millipore, 1:250); Ki67 (#556003, BD pharmingen, 1:100). Primary antibodies were visualized with fluorescence-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG FluoAlexa-594 or 488 antibodies (A-11032, A-11001, A-11008, A-11012, Invitrogen, 1:500). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (1:1000, sigma) and images collected using a Leica DFC500 fluorescence microscope.\n\nElectron microscopy analysis and Toluidine blue staining\nFor ultrastructural analyses, animals were perfused with 2% glutaraldehyde/4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH7.4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Brain and optic nerves were post-fixed in 1% OsO\n4\n, dehydrated through a series of graded ethanols, stained using saturated uranyl acetate and embedded in a Poly/Bed812 resin (polysciences Inc.). For Toluidine blue staining, 2um-thick transverse sections were cut using a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Germany) and stained with 1% Toluidine blue and washed with PBS. To analysis myelination and the structure of node of Ranvier, thin section (1um) and ultrathin section (0.1um) from matching areas of CNP;Cdk5 CKO and control tissue blocks were cut and visualized using an electron microscope (JEOL100CX) at 80 kV. The g -ratio, defined as the ratio of the inner axonal diameter to the total outer diameter, was calculated from at least 150\u2013200 randomly selected myelinated axons from 3\u20135 controls and CNP;Cdk5 CKO animals.\n\nBlack-Gold II myelin staining\n20\u03bcm frozen sections were incubated in pre-warmed 0.3% Black-Gold II solution (Histochem, Jefferson AR) at 60\u00b0C for 30\u201340 min according to the manufacture\u2019s instruction. Sections were washed in distilled water, fixed in 2% sodium thiosulfate for 3 min. Staining was visualized using a Leica DFC500 fluorescence microscope.\n\nIn situ\nhybridization\nA 969 bp probe for proteolipid protein (\nPLP\n) was generated using PCR primers from Allen Brain Atlas flanked with T7/T3 (\nT3\nforward, 5\u2032-\nAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG\nGGGGATGCCTGAGAAGGT3\u2032; and\nT7\nreverse, 5\u2032-\nGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCG\nTGTGATGCTTTCTGCCCA-3\u2032). PCR products were generated using isolated RNA and the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen), re-amplified, and confirmed by sequencing. Probes were then transcribed using the Ambion Maxiscript transcription kit (Invitrogen) and digoxigenin-11-UTP (Roche), using either T3 for the sense control probe or T7 for the antisense probe.\nIn situ\nhybridization was performed according to the published protocol (\nwww.mskcc.org/research/lab/alexandra-joyner/laboratory-protocols\n). Probes were diluted 1:50 in hybridization solution and hybridized overnight at 55\u00b0C\u201360\u00b0C.\n\nNissl staining\nCoronal sections (20um) were mounted on slides and dried overnight at room temperature. Sections were stained subsequently with 0.1% cresyl violet (sigma) for 20 min. Slides were then dehydrated in 100%, 95% and 70% ethanol, and cleared in histo-clear II (National Diagnostics), coversliped with cytoseal\n\u2122\n60 (Thermo Scientific).\n\nBiochemical analysis\nTissues (optic nerve, hippocampus, cortex and corpus callosum) were micro-dissected and homogenized with RIPA lysis buffer. Equal amounts of proteins were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked in 0.1% Tween20 PBS buffer containing 5% BSA overnight at 4\u00b0C and incubated with primary antibodies followed by anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to HRP. Enhanced chemiluminescence was performed with a West Pico Kit and detected by FluorChem E system (ProteinSimple, USA). The following primary antibodies were used: Cdk5 (sc-173, Santa Cruz, 1:1000); PLP (ab28486, Abcam, 1:1000); Caspr (MABN69, Millipore, 1:1000); MBP (SMI-99P, Covance, 1:1000); CREB (#9197, Cell signaling, 1:1000) and p-CREB (#9198, Cell signaling, 1:1000); Cofilin (#5175, Cell signaling, 1:1000) and p-cofilin (#3311, Cell signaling, 1:1000); Fos (#4384, Cell signaling, 1:1000) and Arc (sc-17839, Santa Cruz, 1:1000) and \u03b2-actin (sc-47778, Santa Cruz, 1:1000). The density of immunoblots were quantified against normalized internal loading control using ImageJ software.\n\nOPC cultures\nMouse OPC cultures were prepared using immunopanning as previously described (Yang et al., 2011). Postnatal day 1\u20132 mouse brains were dissected and cerebral cortices were minced and digested in 0.1% Trypsin-EDTA at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. After titration and centrifugation, dissociated cells were incubated on pre -coated culture dishes with secondary antibody IgM (10 \u03bcg/ml) (Millipore, Cat # 55460) and primary antibody A2B5 for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Following wash-off non-adherent cells, OPC were released by 0.05% Trypsin in DMEM and collected at a purity of approximately 96%. OPCs were expanded in DMEM/F12 based-medium supplemented with N2, 5 ng/ml NT-3, 10 ng/ml CNTF, 20 ng/ml bFGF and 20 ng/ml PDGF-AA.\n\nOligodendrocyte conditional media\nEnriched OPCs were plated at a high density of 6\u00d710\n5\n/well in 6-well plate in serum-free DMEM/F12 based medium supplemented with N2, Glutamax, 5 ng/ml NT-3 and 10 ng/ml CNTF. After 2 days, cells were gently washed with DMEM/F12 medium and conditioning medium (DMEM/F12 containing N2 and Glutamax) added in the culture. After 24 hours, the conditioned medium was harvested and passed through centrifugal filter (Amicon ultra-4 3K, Cat#: UFC800324) at 1000rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was stored at \u221280\u00b0C and used at a dilution of 1:25 for neuronal cell culture.\n\nCortical or hippocampal neuronal cultures\nCortical and hippocampal neuronal cell cultures were prepared from E18 mouse brain as described previously (\nRomito-DiGiacomo et al., 2007\n). Tissues were dissected and trypsinized for 15\u201320 min at 37 \u00b0C. Dissociated neuronal cells were plated on PLL-Laminin-coated, 24-well coverslip, respectively, and grown in Neurobasal media supplemented with 2% B27, 2mM Glutamax and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For co-culture, 48 hours after initial plating cortical or hippocampal neurons were co-cultured with purified WT or Cdk5\u2212/\u2212 OPCs; or treated with conditional media derived from either WT or Cdk5\u2212/\u2212 OPCs and the density and maturation of neuronal dendritic spine and synapse formation assayed.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nCultured cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated in primary antibodies (MAP2, M4403, sigma; Synapsin-1, #106103, Synaptic Systems) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After rising in PBS, Alexa fluoresces-conjugated secondary antibodies 488 or 594 (1:500, Invitrogen) were incubated for 2 hours. The coverslips were mounted with Vecta Shield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and visualized by fluorescent microscopy.\n\nStatistical analyses\nData were collected from control and CNP-Cdk5 CKO animals (N=3\u20135 in each group) and presented as mean\u00b1SEM. Statistical analysis was performed by two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t tests, one-way ANOVA or two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test or Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test. Quantifications were performed in a blinded fashion."

    "Methods": "Animals and Preparations\nAll animal procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the UNM Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Adult (4\u20138 weeks) male and female mice (C57Bl/6 and/or GCaMP5G) were used for all experiments. For Ca\n2+\nimaging experiments, homozygous mice expressing the floxxed calcium indicator GCaMP5G under the CAG promoter (\nGee et al., 2014\n) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Stock No: 024477, B6;129S6-\nPolr2a\ntm1(CAG-GCaMP5g,-tdTomato)Tvrd\n/J), and bred with homozygous mice expressing Cre Recombinase under the CamK2a promoter (B6.Cg-Tg(Camk2a-cre)T29\u20131Stl/J, Jax Stock No: 005359). Offspring were utilized in experiments and had robust GCaMP5G expression in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (\nWang et al., 2013\n).\nAcute brain slices were prepared as previously described (\nShuttleworth et al., 2003\n). Briefly, animals were deeply anaesthetized with 0.15mL (s.c.) injection of ketamine-xylazine (85 and 15 mg ml\n\u22121\n, respectively), decapitated, and brains were quickly removed into 150 mL oxygenated ice-cold cutting solution (in mM): sucrose, 220; NaHCO\n3\n, 26; KCl, 3; NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.5; MgSO\n4\n, 6; glucose, 10; CaCl\n2\n0.2; equilibrated with 95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\nsupplemented with 0.2 ml ketamine (100 mg/ml, Putney Inc., Portland, ME), to limit excitotoxicity during the slice preparation as described in (\nAitken et al., 1995\n). Coronal cortico-hippocampal slices (350 \u03bcm) were prepared with a Pelco 102 Vibratome (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA), hemisected, and then allowed to recover in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; containing (in mM): NaCl, 126; NaHCO\n3\n, 26; glucose, 10; KCl, 3; CaCl\n2\n, 2, NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.5; MgSO\n4\n, 1; equilibrated with 95% O\n2\n/ 5% CO\n2\n), at 35\u00b0C for 60 min. After 1h, the holding aCSF was replaced with chilled (20\u00b0C) aCSF and slices were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature until the start of recording sessions. These incubations and exchanges served to ensure effective wash out of residual ketamine from slices, as previously established with responsiveness to glutamate and NMDA (\nShuttleworth et al., 2003\n,\nHoskison and Shuttleworth, 2006\n,\nVander Jagt et al., 2008\n).\n\nGeneration of SD\nIndividual brain slices were transferred to a submersion recording chamber with nylon slice supports (RC-27L, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT), and continuously super fused with oxygenated (95% O\n2\n/95% CO\n2\n) aCSF at 2.2 ml min\n-1\n. Bath temperature was maintained at 32\u00b0C by an inline heater assembly (TC-344B, Warner Instruments). After placement of electrodes into the slice (See Electrophysiology methods) slices were allowed 20 minutes for equilibration. As described below (Results), modified aCSF with elevated K\n+\n(8mM) was used for most experiments, in order to increase ability of single slices to support repetitive SDs and enable rigorous testing of drug effects (\nFunke et al., 2009\n,\nZhang et al., 2015\n). SDs were evoked by pressure microinjection (40ms, 30 psi; Picospritzer; Parker Hannifin, OH, USA) of KCl (1M) via a glass micropipette ~3 M\u2126) placed in hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum. Repetitive SDs were initiated in each slice at 15 minute intervals to allow for full recovery between events. In experiments assessing the effect of ketamine antagonism during repetitive SDs (Figures\n2\n\u2013\n4\n& Supplementary Figures), antagonist wash-in commenced following the second of two control SDs, and the second control SD was used for analyses (\nFootitt and Newberry, 1998\n). SD initiation and propagation, as well as slice viability (see Metabolic Challenge below), were examined by monitoring intrinsic optical signals (IOS) of submerged brain slices trans-illuminated with visible light (\u2265 600nm) and collected using a 4X objective (Olympus, 0.10 NA). IOS data were captured at 0.5 Hz using a cooled CCD camera (Imago, Till Photonics) and analyzed with TillVision software (TillPhotonics, version 4.01). Data analysis involved normalizing transmitted light to baseline and expressing IOS as percent change in transmission (\u0394T/T\n0\n\u00d7 100) (\nAnderson and Andrew, 2002\n).\nFigure 2. Ketamine reduced SD propagation rate and DC shift duration.\nOpen in a new tab\nA:\nRepresentative example of effect of ketamine wash-in, during a series of repetitive SDs. Top panels show intrinsic optical signal changes to track SD propagation (as described in\nFigure 1\n) in control conditions (\nleft\n), and during the third SD evoked in the presence of 30 \u03bcM ketamine (\nright\n). Note the delayed propagation of the SD wavefront in ketamine. The traces show DC potential recordings during this sequence of SDs in the same slice.\nBlack arrowheads\nindicate DC shift onset, and\ndashed lines\nrepresent 15 minutes recovery between stimulations. The duration of the DC shift of SD was progressively reduced, and then recovered after ketamine washout.\nB:\nSummary data from 9 preparations as shown in A, demonstrating progressive decreases in both propagation rate and DC duration with partial recovery upon ketamine wash out in 6 experiments (gray bar). *P<.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, **** P<0.0001.\nFigure 4. Ketamine accelerates recovery of evoked postsynaptic potentials after SD.\nOpen in a new tab\nA:\nRepresentative example of suppression and recovery of evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) after SD. Control EPSPs (a) were abolished after SD (b,c), and slowly recovered to baseline amplitudes after ~12 min (d). The\nasterisk\nabove control (a) trace indicates the bipolar stimulus artifact. The full time course of EPSP suppression and recovery in this same slice is plotted below (\nblack circles\n). SD onset indicated by\nblack arrowhead.\nKetamine (30 \u03bcM) did not prevent EPSP suppression, but significantly accelerated recovery rate (\nlower\nset of traces, and\nwhite circles\nin plot\n).\nB:\nSummary data from 6 such experiments. The effect of ketamine on DC shift duration in this data set was consistent with prior observations in\nFigure 2\n(45.9 \u00b1 2.3 vs. 35.7 \u00b1 1.1 s for control and ketamine, respectively; P = 0.0026). *** P<0.001\n\nElectrophysiology\nExtracellular recordings were acquired (1\u201310kHz) with an Axon MultiClamp 700A amplifier, digitized (Digidata 1332), and recorded using pCLAMP10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Glass recording microelectrodes were filled with aCSF (tip resistance ~3M\u2126) and positioned at a depth of 50\u2013100 \u03bcm in the CA1 stratum radiatum \u2265200 \u03bcm from the KCl-filled glass ejection micropipettes. The durations of SDs were calculated from the extracellular potential shift (\u201cDC shift\u201d (\nSomjen, 2001\n)), measured at 20% of the peak maximum to 80% recovery. In experiments assessing synaptic recovery after SD, a concentric bipolar electrode (FHC, Bowdoin, ME, USA) was placed on the slice surface ofCA1 stratum radiatum, between the KCl ejection micropipette and recording electrode, for stimulation of Schaffer collateral inputs. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were recorded using test pulses (50 \u03bcs, 0.1Hz) delivered at intensities (80 \u2013 400 \u03bcA) that gave 40 \u2013 60% of the maximum EPSP amplitude. DC shifts and EPSPs were analyzed using Clampfit 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Postsynaptic potentials were resolved from gap-free recordings with a high-pass filter (1 Hz cut-off). The duration of EPSP suppression after a single SD was measured from the time of the maximum negative potential of the DC shift to the time at which postsynaptic potentials first reached \u2265 50% of baseline values.\n\nFluorescence Imaging\nNeuronal Ca\n2+\ndynamics during SD reported by GCaMP5G were imaged with a 20X water-immersion objective (Olympus, 0.5 NA) and analyzed in TillPhotonics, version 4.01 software (Till Photonics GmBH, NY). GCaMP5G was excited at 480nm using a monochromator (Polychrome V, 2Hz); emission signals were passed through a dichroic mirror (515 DCLP) and captured using a cooled CCD camera (Imago, Till Photonics). Total Ca\n2+\naccumulation in specific regions of interest during SD were calculated (GraphPad Prism 7.03) as the integral of the signals for 120 seconds or 200s following the peak of the SD transient. The duration of Ca\n2+\nduring SD was measured from the initial positive peak amplitude to the time point where fluorescence returned to \u2264 5% of baseline levels.\nAutofluorescence signals during SD that could contaminate Ca\n2+\nsignals were evaluated in wild-type brain slices not expressing GCaMP5G. A small, but long-lasting (>200s) fluorescence decrease was observed, as described previously and attributed to flavoprotein autofluorescence (\nShuttleworth, 2010\n). Autofluorescence decreases were similar in both somatic and dendritic compartments (\u22123.0 \u00b1 0.9 and \u22122.3 \u00b1 0.9 \u0394F/F\n0\n(%) decrease at 160s after SD for stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum, respectively; n=3, Supplementary\nFigure 2B\n). Ca\n2+\nsignals were therefore corrected for background and autofluorescence changes during SD, and expressed as percent change from baseline values (\u0394F/F\n0\n\u00d7 100).\n\nMetabolic challenge\nUnder control conditions, slices are normally held 0.5mm above the coverslip floor of the recording chamber to ensure continuous flow of aCSF on both sides of the slice. This is considered a nominally-healthy condition for the current study (see discussion in\nFrenguelli, 2017\n). However, in some experiments, we reduced aCSF flow to the bottom side of the slice, in order to intentionally reduce metabolic capacity and increase vulnerability to SD. This was accomplished by inverting the slice support insert (SS-3, Warner Instruments), to remove the flow channel under the slice. As opposed to complete oxygen-glucose deprivation, this partial metabolic compromise did not spontaneously initiate SD in any preparation (n = 44). Slice recovery after SD was evaluated from 1) intrinsic optical signals (\nAnderson and Andrew, 2002\n) 2) the ability of the tissue to generate a second SD (\nKoroleva and Bures, 1996\n) and 3) electrophysiologically with evoked extracellular postsynaptic potentials (\nLindquist and Shuttleworth, 2012\n).\n\nDrugs\nKetamine (100 mg/ml, racemic: R (\u2212)/S (+)) was purchased from Putney, Inc. (Portland, ME), and solutions containing ketamine were prepared daily. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are reported as mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analyses (repeated measure one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), paired and unpaired t-tests) were calculated using GraphPad Prism (version 7.03; La Jolla, CA). Statistical significance was determined by\nP\nvalues < 0.05, with Bonferroni correction during multiple comparisons."

    "Methods": "Female, Sprague-Dawley rats (Envigo; 230\u2013260g) were used for this study. 7 rats total were used for chronic recording of diaphragm EMG activity. All experiments were performed with approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Drexel University, and following the National Research Council\u2019s Guidelines (USA).\n\nDiaphragm EMG electrode implantation\nDiaphragm EMG electrode implantation was modified from that previously described by Mantilla (\nMantilla et al., 2011\n). The electrodes are comprised of insulated, stranded stainless steel wires (CoonerWire, part AS631), ~20 cm long, with a small 1\u20132 mm uninsulated area and anchor at one end (ball of dental cement \u2013 Grip Cement,\nDentsply International Inc, #675571 and liquid #675572\n). The opposite end of the wire was also uninsulated (3 mm), inserted into the cut end of a 26 5/8 gauge needle (0.45mm \u00d7 16mm). The proximal (unbeveled) end was crimped to fix the wire inside, and the needle was manually bent into a curve (\nSupplemental Figure 1A\n).\nFor electrode implantation, all animals were anesthetized with xylazine (10mg/kg, s.q.) and ketamine (120mg/kg, i. p.), and received analgesia (buprenorphine; 0.03 mg/kg, s.q.). The skin overlying the rat\u2019s abdomen and skull were shaved and disinfected with antiseptics (betadine and 70% ethanol wipes) for surgery. A midline longitudinal incision was made on the head, and the skin retracted to expose the skull. Three holes were made in the skull (\nSupplemental Figure 1B\n) using a drill (Saeyang Co). Surgical bone screws (Component Supply Co, part# SHCX-080-03) were inserted into each hole (\nSupplemental Figure 1B\n). Silver wire was attached to one screw, which served as a ground. Then dental cement was applied over the skull and screws to create a platform for electrode connectors.\nA skin incision was made along the midline of the animal\u2019s abdomen and chest to expose the abdominal and caudal-most external intercostal muscles. A median incision was made through the abdominal wall along to the linea alba to expose the abdominal surface of the diaphragm. Two electrodes (~1cm apart) were sutured (dorsal-ventral direction) through the medial costal part of hemidiaphragm on each side for bipolar recording. The cement anchor ball at the end of each wire held the electrode in place in the diaphragm (\nSupplemental Figure 1C\n). The needles and attached electrodes were pulled through the lateral space of xiphoideus to externalize the wires, and the abdominal muscles were sutured (4-0 Vicryl). The wires on each side of sternum were gently braided and needles removed. A loop was created from each pair of wires to avoid tension during chest movements. The free ends of the electrodes were then guided under the skin towards the head, and retrieved in front of each ear. This left the wires lateral to the neck musculature which would be later surgically exposed for C2Hx. The muscle and skin on the abdomen were sutured and closed with sterile wound clips, respectively. Wires from the EMG electrodes were connected to a 4-pin connector (Digi-key, #A104980-ND), and the silver wire that was attached to one of the three skull screws was connected to a separate 2 pin-connector. All connectors for recording electrodes and ground were then fixed to the head with dental cement (\nSupplemental Figure 1D\n). After surgery, animals received yohimbine (1.2 mg/kg, s.q.) to reverse effect of xylazine and lactated Ringers solution (5 ml, s.q.) to prevent dehydration. Additional analgesia (buprenorphine), lactated Ringers injections (5 ml/day, s.q.) and oral dietary supplement (Nutrical; 1\u20133 ml) were given daily as needed.\n\nC2Hx Surgery\nOne week after diaphragm EMG electrode implantation, all animals received a C2Hx. The skin on the dorsal side of neck was shaved and cleaned as described above. An incision was made from the base of the skull to the shoulder blades through the skin and muscle overlying the cervical vertebrae. A partial laminectomy was done at the C2 vertebral level. An incision (~2mm) was made in the dura mater rostrocaudally along to the midline of the dorsal spinal cord. A C2Hx was made immediately caudal to the C2 rootlets, from the midline to lateral edge of the spinal cord using a No. 11 scalpel blade. To visually confirm the extent of the injury, a fine tipped glass pipette connected to a vacuum pump was used to gently aspirate spinal tissue at the lesion site. Dura and surrounding muscles were sutured (10-0 and 4-0 sterile suture, respectively) and skin was closed using wound clips. Yohimbine (1.2 mg/kg, s.q.), lactated Ringers solution (5ml, s.q.), and buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg, s.q.) were given postoperatively, as described above.\n\nDiaphragm EMG recordings\nAwake diaphragm EMG recordings were made in standard rodent cages over a 10\u201320 minute period of exploration/rest, using a CED digitizer (Cambridge Electronic Design LTD (CED), model 1401), differential AC amplifier (A-M System, Model 1700), and digital video camera (Logitech) with Spike2 (CED) software. EMG signal was amplified by x1000 and filtered 100 \u2013 5,000 Hz. Long, flexible, insulated wires were connected to the head stage (\nSupplemental Figure 1D\n), and the animal was allowed to move freely within the cage. These recordings allowed us to monitor diaphragm muscle activity pre-, acutely post- (<1hr) and weekly post-C2Hx for up to 8 weeks.\n\nTerminal Phrenic Nerve Recordings\nFor terminal recordings of phrenic nerve activity, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% in O\n2\n100%) in an induction chamber and then via nose mask (Isoflurane vaporizer VIP3000, MDS Matrix, Scavenger Fluovac 50206, Stoelting). After tracheostomy, the animal was transferred to mechanical ventilation (MV, ~60 cycles/min, 2\u20132.5 ml tidal volume; 2% isoflurane, Columbus Apparatus) and two catheters (PE-50 tubing, BD Intramedic, NJ) were inserted into the femoral artery and vein for measurement of arterial blood pressure and infusion of drugs. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37.0\u00b10.2 \u00b0C via a servo-controlled heating blanket (Harvard Apparatus) during surgery. Ventral neck muscles (sternomastoideus, sternohyoideus, and medial scaleneus were removed, and phrenic nerves were carefully dissected from surrounding tissue and cut below subclavian artery. Bilateral vagotomy was performed by transection below the vagal-laryngeal branch point, to prevent lung stretch receptor-dependent breathing during ventilation. Following surgery, the animal was placed in a stereotaxic frame under mechanical ventilation (2% Isoflurane with a gas mixture of 50% O\n2\n+ 50% N\n2\n). Arterial blood pressure (>100 mm Hg), lung inflation pressure (10 cm H\n2\nO), end-tidal CO\n2\n(4.5\u20135.0 %), and body temperature (37.0\u00b10.2 \u00b0C) were monitored via pressure transducers (CDXII; Argon Medical, TX), Capnostar CO\n2\n-meter (CWE, INC, PA) and Physitemp-200 servo controller (Fine Science Tools, CA), respectively. Then rat was slowly transferred from isoflurane to urethane (1.2 g/kg) anesthesia via i.v. injection. The muscle relaxant (vecuronium bromide, 3\u20134 mg/kg/h in Ringer-Locke solution) was continuously infused i.v. (1ml/h/100g of body weight) to remove all movement artifacts during phrenic recording. Bipolar silver electrodes (0.38 mm thickness, A-M Systems, Cat#787500) for the recording of phrenic activity were immersed in the mineral oil bath made by elevation of skin flaps on both sides of the neck. Phrenic neurograms were amplified (X10,000), filtered (50\u20135,000 Hz, Neurolog Digitizer, UK), digitized (10,000 samples/s) and stored on a PC hard drive using Chart5 software (AD Instruments, Australia).\n\nHistology\nAt the end of each experiment, animals were transcardially perfused with saline, then paraformaldehyde (4% in 0.1M phosphate-buffered saline). The spinal cord was dissected and cryoprotected by sequentially soaking tissue in 15% and 30% sucrose (in 0.1M PBS). Transverse sections (20\u03bcm) were made directly on slide throughout the injury site. Then, the sections were counterstained with cresyl violet and pictures taken with Zeiss Imager M2 microscope to determine the extent of C2Hx (complete or incomplete).\n\nData Analysis\nAll obtained data were analyzed using Spike 2 (CED, UK) and OriginPro 9 (OriginLab Corporation, USA). Diaphragm EMG and phrenic neurograms were integrated (DC removed, rectified and smoothed with a 0.03 s of window width). Basal breathing bursts (\nMoore et al., 2013\n) with frequencies less than 3 Hz were identified through all EMG recordings and onset of each breath was tagged manually. Averaged integrated diaphragm and phrenic activities were taken over a minimum of 30\u201350 breaths. Ipsilateral phrenic amplitudes were normalized to the contralateral side of the same animal. Diaphragm EMG amplitudes were normalized to pre-injury level for the left and right sides separately. To eliminate tonic background activity, final amplitudes were determined as a difference between maximum and minimum points of integrated activity. Sighs were analyzed as amplitude ratio of a sigh to preceding breath. Significant differences between mean values were established using Wilcoxon signed ranks test for non-normally distributed data sets and one-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey for normally distributed data. P<0.05 was used as a level of significance. Lesion size analysis was performed with ImageJ software (1.51r, NIH, USA) using images of cross-sections at the epicenter of the lesion. Percentage of spared tissue was calculated as a ratio of spared area to the total area on the contralateral side and multiplied by 100. All data are presented as a mean \u00b1 standard deviation."
