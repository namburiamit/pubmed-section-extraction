    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal experiments were conducted according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN and in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Experiments were performed on primary cultures of sensory neurons derived from the DRG of adult male Sprague Dawley rats (150\u2013250 g; Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN). Prior to sacrifice, animals were housed in group cages in a light controlled room with food and water available\nad libitum\n.\n\nIsolation of primary sensory neuron cultures\nDRG were harvested and cultured as described previously (\nPittman et al., 2014\n). Dissociated DRG cells were added to plates previously coated with poly-D-lysine and laminin [~30,000 cells/well in 12-well plates for CGRP release assays and viability assays; ~30,000 cells/well in 6-well plates for biolistic transfection/neurite imaging experiments; and ~3,000 cells/well in 48-well plates for neurite length and branching experiments]. Cells were grown in F-12 growth media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 2 mM glutamine, 50 \u03bcg/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 50 \u03bcM 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine, and 150 \u03bcM uridine in the absence of added NGF or in the presence of 30 or 250 ng/ml NGF. Cells were maintained in an atmosphere of 3% CO\n2\nat 37\u00b0C, and media was changed every other day. For paclitaxel and EpoB treatments, stocks of drugs (10 mM) were prepared in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (MPL) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. The stocks were further diluted in media to appropriate concentrations. Cultures were treated with paclitaxel or EpoB in media starting on day 7 in culture, and experiments were performed on day 7, before MTA exposure, or on day 12 in culture.\n\nCalcitonin gene-related peptide release\nRelease experiments were performed as described previously (\nVasko et al., 1994\n,\nPittman et al., 2014\n). The wells were rinsed one time with HEPES buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, 135 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 3.3 mM D-glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. The cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C for 3 incubations. During the first interval, cells were incubated with HEPES buffer for 20 minutes to establish resting basal release of immunoreactive CGRP (iCGRP), which we will refer to as CGRP. For the release experiments performed with neurons maintained in 0 added NGF, we increased the basal incubation time from the previously used 10 minutes (\nPittman et al., 2014\n) to 20 minutes, in order to achieve measurable amounts of basal CGRP since neurons grown in 0 added NGF have a lower total content of CGRP compared to those grown in NGF (\nPark et al., 2010\n). During the second interval, cells were incubated with HEPES containing 30 nM capsaicin or HEPES containing 50 mM KCl (substituted for equimolar NaCl) in order to stimulate CGRP release. The third incubation was in HEPES to reestablish resting basal release. Supernatants were collected after every interval, and CGRP was measured using radioimmunoassay as previously described (\nVasko et al., 1994\n,\nPittman et al., 2014\n). At the completion of the release experiment, cells were incubated for 20 min in 0.1 N HCl, and the supernatant was collected to determine total CGRP content.\n\nViability assay\nThe viability of sensory neurons grown in 0 added NGF following exposure to paclitaxel was assessed by staining with propidium iodide (PI). Sensory neuronal cultures were exposed to either vehicle (.003% MPL) or 300 nM paclitaxel for 5 days. As a positive control, untreated cultures were exposed to 300 \u03bcM H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 1\u20132 hours at 37\u00b0C. At the end of the 1\u20132 hour incubation, the cultures were returned to F-12 media. Approximately 24 hours later, all cultures were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), rinsed with staining buffer, and then incubated with 0.5 ml of the staining solution, consisting of 6 \u03bcM PI in staining buffer, for 1 hour. Cells were visualized after the 1 hour incubation period. The dye was excited at 530 nm and the emitted light was monitored at 645 nm. Cells in three random fields were counted and scored as either viable (unstained) or non-viable (red), and the total number of neurons, classified via morphology, per treatment group was also counted. The counter was blinded to the experimental sample until after assessment of the data. The data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) of percent non-viable cells per total number of neurons as well as total number of neurons per field.\n\nNeurite length and branching via ImageXpress\nNeurite length and branching were determined using the Neurite Outgrowth module software of the ImageXpress Micro XL instrument (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The DRG cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes on day 12 following MTA treatment. Fixed neuronal cultures were then stored in filtered blocking buffer (1:25 dilution of normal donkey serum in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) at 4\u00b0C for 1\u201310 days prior to incubation with antibody. Cultures were incubated overnight with primary antibody against PGP9.5 (1:1000, rabbit), a neuronal-specific protein (\nThompson et al., 1983\n), in filtered blocking buffer. The following day, cultures were rinsed 3 times for 10 minutes with PBS, incubated for 2 hours with Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200) in filtered blocking buffer, and rinsed again in PBS 3 times for 10 minutes. Cultures were imaged while submerged in PBS. Neurons were imaged with the ImageXpress Micro XL System using the FITC filter set at 10X magnification; the Alexa Fluor 488 fluorophore was excited at 482 nm and the emitted light was monitored at 536 nm. One image was taken in the center of each well, and each image captured a total area of 1.96 mm\n2\n(1.4 \u00d7 1.4 mm). Data are reported as average neurite length or branching segments per field. Total neurite length and branching was determined using the Neurite Outgrowth module software using established parameters for cell bodies (max width of cell body: 54 \u03bcm, intensity above local background: 30000 graylevels, minimum area: 100 \u03bcm\n2\n) and outgrowths (maximum width: 8 \u03bcm, intensity above local background: 5000 graylevels, minimum cell growth to log as significant: 10 \u03bcm).\n\nNeurite outgrowth and branching via biolistic transfection and individual neuronal measurements\nThe Helios Gene Gun System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) was used for biolistic transfection of neurons. Optimized protocols were designed and modified from a published report (\nDib-Hajj et al., 2009\n) and from the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Bio-Rad Laboratories Helios Gene Gun System) to maximize transfection efficiency and preserve the health of neurons. Green fluorescent protein cDNA (10 \u03bcg) in 50 \u03bcM spermidine was coprecipitated onto 1.0 \u03bcm gold particles with CaCl\n2\n(1M). The DNA gold suspension was washed and reconstituted three times with dehydrated EtOH. After the last EtOH wash, the gold-DNA complex was reconstituted in 0.05% polyvinylpyrrolidone in ethanol. The gold suspension was used to coat the inner wall of a 24 inch piece of Tefzel tubing (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The complex rested undisturbed in the tubing for approximately 3\u20135 minutes before the liquid (EtOH) contents were slowly removed with a syringe at a rate of 0.5\u20131.0 in/sec. Next, the tubing was dried using ultrapure nitrogen and cut into cartridges for the Helios Gene Gun. This process resulted in a density of 0.75 mg of gold particles per shot and 0.75 \u03bcg of total DNA per cartridge.\nImmediately before biolistic transfection, the growth media was removed from the well of a 6-well plate containing recently harvested (~24 hrs) rat DRG neurons. The pressure and velocity were chosen so as to achieve transfection in several neurons while not affecting the health of the neurons. Transfected neurons expressed EGFP, and green fluorescence was visible as early as 24 hrs post-transfection. The neurons were photographed immediately before exposure to paclitaxel on day 7 in culture, and again 2 and 5 days (day 9 and day 12 in culture, respectively) after exposure to paclitaxel. The images were analyzed with the help of the neurite outgrowth plug-in, which was compatible with the MetaMorph 7.6 software. This software measures total outgrowth of the neuron projecting from the cell body rather than the length of individual neurites. User-defined criteria, such as detection threshold and diameter of cell body, were used to quantify length of processes. The validity of the specified criteria was verified by observing traces superimposed by the software onto the original image for purposes of comparison. Data were expressed as % change in neurite extension on day 9 and on day 12 relative to that on day 7.\n\nReagents\nAll materials unless stated otherwise were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). F-12 media, horse serum, antibiotics, and Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit antibody were purchased from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). NGF was purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). The rabbit anti-human Protein Gene Product 9.5 antibody was purchased from AbD Serotec, a Bio-Rad company (Raleigh, NC). The GFP construct, pMax-GFP was acquired from Amaxa (Lonza; Basel, Switzerland).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nData were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two-way ANOVA as indicated, and post-hoc analyses were performed using the Tukey\u2019s or Dunnett\u2019s test, as indicated. Statistical calculations were performed with the GraphPad Prism version 6.02 statistical software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM, and differences are considered significant if p < 0.05."

    "Methods": "The study was conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of animals in research, and protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Oregon Health and Science University (Portland, OR, USA).\n\nAnimals\nTransgenic mice expressing either the human CYP2J2 or CYP2C8 epoxygenase in vascular endothelium under the control of the murine Tie2 promoter (2-kb) and full enhancer (10-kb) were generated on a C57Bl/6 background. We used heterozygous Tie2-CYP2J2, Tie2-CYP2C8 transgenic mice and age- and sex-matched WT littermate controls. Genotype was determined in each mouse by PCR of tail genomic DNA. Generation of Tie2-CYP2J2 and Tie2-CYP2C8 mice, founder lines, breeding and genotyping protocols have been previously described (\nLee et al., 2010\n).\n\nMiddle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO)\nAdult (25-28g) male and female wild-type (WT), Tie2-CYP2J2 and Tie2-CYP2C8 transgenic mice were subjected to 60-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) under isoflurane anesthesia, as described previously, with slight modifications (\nZhang et al., 2008\n). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (induction 5%; maintenance 1.0%), and kept warm with water pads. A small laser-Doppler probe was affixed to the skull to monitor cerebral cortical perfusion and verify vascular occlusion and reperfusion. A silicone-coated 6-0 nylon monofilament was inserted into the right internal carotid artery via the external carotid artery until laser-Doppler signal dropped to less than 20% of baseline. The animal was maintained anesthetized with 1% isoflurane on the surgical station for 60 minutes of occlusion. After reperfusion, mice were allowed to recover and observed for 24 hours. Infarct size was measured at 24 h after MCAO in 2-mm thick coronal brain sections (five total) using 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and digital image analysis. Sections were incubated in 1.2% TTC in saline for 15 min at 37\u00b0C, and then fixed in formalin for 24 h. Slices were photographed; infarcted (unstained) and uninfarcted (red color) areas were measured with MCID software (InterFocus Imaging Ltd, Linton, UK) and integrated across all five slices. To account for the effect of edema, the infarcted area was estimated indirectly by subtracting the uninfarcted area in the ipsilateral hemisphere from the contralateral hemisphere, and expressing infarct volume as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere. Cerebrocortical laser-Doppler perfusion (LDP) was monitored during occlusion and early reperfusion. The laser-Doppler probe was positioned on bone over the dorsolateral parietal cortex 2 mm posterior, 3 mm lateral to the Bregma. The LDP signal was recorded continuously and averaged over 15-minute intervals for comparison among treatment groups.\n\nOptical Microangiography (OMAG)\nOMAG was performed as previously described (\nZhang et al., 2009\n,\nAn et al., 2010\n,\nWang et al., 2007\n). The mouse head was shaved before OMAG imaging. During imaging, the mouse was immobilized on a custom-made stereotaxic stage and lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (0.2 l/min O2, 0.8 l/min air). Body temperature was kept at 35.5\u201336.5\u00b0C with a warming blanket and monitored by a rectal thermal probe throughout the experiment. An incision of ~1 cm was made along the sagittal suture, and the frontal parietal and interparietal bones were exposed by pulling the skin to the sides. The animal was then positioned under the OMAG scanning probe, allowing for visualization and quantification of blood flow based on endogenous light scattering from moving blood cells within biologic tissue, with no need to use exogenous contrasting agents. In the mouse, OMAG covers the entire thickness of the cerebral cortex through an intact skull. OMAG was an optical coherence tomography based imaging technique capable of generating three-dimensional images of functional vasculature in vivo and without the need for dye injection (\nAn et al., 2010\n,\nWang et al., 2007\n). The OMAG imaging system used in this study employed a superluminescent diode with a central wavelength of 1,310 nm and a full-width, half-maximum bandwidth of 50 nm, providing an axial resolution of ~10 um in tissue. The lateral resolution of the system was measured at ~15 um. The spectral interferograms formed by the reference light and the light backscattered from the tissue sample were detected by a custom-built, high-resolution and high-speed spectrometer, upon which the OMAG algorithm was applied to obtain angiographic images representing functional cerebral microvasculature within the scanned brain tissue. The three-dimensional scan represented a physical volume with the following x\u2013y\u2013z dimensions: 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 2.0 mm3.\n\nIsolation of Cerebral Vessels\nMice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused transcardially with pre-chilled heparinized saline (1 U/ml) before decapitation to remove blood from the cerebral circulation; brains were then rapidly dissected. Pial and large cerebral vessels were removed with fine forceps and discarded. The remaining brain tissue was homogenized in ice-cold PBS with a loosely fitting Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 2,000 g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant, containing parenchymal brain tissue, was discarded; the pellet, containing vessels, was resuspended in PBS and centrifuged at 2,000 g for another 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The second pellet was resuspended in PBS, layered over a 15% dextran density gradient (molecular weight 35,000 - 40,000 kDa), and centrifuged in a swinging-bucket rotor for 30 minutes at 3,500 g at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in PBS, and again layered over dextran and centrifuged for an additional 30 minutes at 3,500 g. The resulting pellet was washed with ice-cold PBS over a 70 mm nylon mesh, cerebral microvessels vessels and capillaries were collected and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.\n\nPrimary aortic endothelial cell isolation\nAorta from WT Tie2-CYP2J2 and Tie2-CYP2C8 male mice were harvested for isolation of endothelial cells, as described previously (\nLee et al., 2010\n). Briefly, 3 aortas from each genotype were pooled, minced and digested with type-I collagenase (2 mg/ml, Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 45 min. Resultant homogenates were triturated with a 30-ml syringe, filtered through a 70-\u03bcm cell strainer, washed with PBS + 0.1% FBS and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1000rpm. Cell pellets were re-suspended and incubated with magnetic Dynabeads (Invitrogen) coated with anti-CD31 antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Endothelial cells were isolated by magnetic separation and plated onto 0.1% gelatin-coated flasks in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 100 \u03bcg/mL heparin, 100 \u03bcg/mL penicillin/streptomycin and 100 \u03bcg/mL endothelial cell growth supplement (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA, USA). Once confluent, cells were trypsinized and further purified by incubation with anti-CD102 (BD Biosciences) coated Dynabeads and grown to confluence. 1 million endothelial cells were plated on 100 mm tissue culture dishes and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated in serum free DMEM for 4 hours. The cell- conditioned medium was collected, the cells were then incubated for 10 minutes in fresh serum free DMEM containing 10 \u03bcM Ca2+ ionophore (A23187, Sigma-Aldrich) to stimulate arachidonic acid release. Both basal and stimulated medium were collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for MC/MS/MS analysis.\n\nQuantification of CYP-derived eicosanoids in medium\nEpoxy and dihydroxy metabolites (EETs and DHETs) of arachidonic acid were extracted and quantified; 11,12- and 14,15- regioiosomers specifically were quantified as these are the primary metabolic products synthesized by CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 (\nZeldin et al., 1995\n;\nWu et al., 1996\n). These were extracted in cell culture medium by solid-phase extraction and eluted in ethyl acetate, as described by\nNewman et al. (2002)\nand\nSeubert et al. (2006)\n. Oxylipids were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a 2- \u00d7 150-mm, 5-\u03bcm Luna C18 (2) column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) and quantified using a MDS Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) with negative mode electrospray ionization and multiple reaction monitoring, as previously described (\nNewman et al., 2002\n). Relative response ratios of each analyte were used to calculate concentrations, quantification relative to internal standards corrected for surrogate losses. Cell medium concentrations were normalized to cell plating density.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection and extraction\nPlasma oxylipid levels were determined by liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectroscopy (LC/MS/MS). Samples were collected from the cisterna magna of na\u00efve animals. Mice were anesthetized and placed prone on a stereotaxic frame. A sagittal incision of the skin was made inferior to the occiput, the subcutaneous tissue and muscles separated and the dura matter was penetrated with the 30G1 needle connected with PE-10 tube. The CSF was drawn into PE-10 tubing with the careful suction by a 10 \u03bcl gastight syringe (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV, USA). The CSF was injected into an Eppendorf tube, and frozen in a \u221280\u00b0C freezer until assayed. CSF samples (5-10 ul) were mixed with 50 ul of 0.1% acetic acid in 5% methanol, 10 ul of 0.4mg/ml butylated hydroxytolulene, and spiked with with 30 ng PGE2-d4, 10,11- DiHN, and 10,11-EpHep (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) as internal standards. Oxylipids were extracted 3 times with 1 ml ethyl acetate. Ethyl acetate from each sample was pooled and dried under gentle nitrogen flow. Samples were reconstituted in 100 ul of 40% ethanol. Three injections of 20 ul were analyzed for each sample. The triplicate sample injections were averaged, corrected for volume of CSF, and represented as pg/ul. Online liquid chromatography of extracted samples was performed with an Agilent 1200 Series capillary HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) as previously described (\nEdin et al., 2011\n,\nNewman et al., 2002\n). Separations were achieved using a Phenomenex Luna C18(2) column (5 um, 150\u00d71 mm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), which was held at 40\u00b0C. Mobile phase A was 85:15:0.1 water:acetonitrile:acetic acid. Mobile phase B was 70:30:0.1 acetonitrile:methanol:acetic acid. Gradient elution was used; mobile phase percentage B and flow rate were varied as follows: 0% B at 87.5 ul/min at 0 min, ramp from 0 to 2 min to 25% B at 87.5 ul/min, ramp from 2 to 5 min to 50% B at 60 ul/min, ramp from 5 to 23 min to 92.5% B at 60 ul/min, ramp from 23 to 23.5 min to 100% B at 87.5 ul/min, hold from 23.5 to 29 min at 100% B, ramp from 29 to 29.6 min down to 0% B, and hold 0% B to 33 min. Negative ion electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was used for detection. Analyses were performed on an MDS Sciex API 3000 equipped with a TurboIonSpray source (Applied Biosystems). Turbo desolvation gas was heated to 275\u00b0C at a flow rate of 5.75 ml/min.\n\nTaqMan Real-Time Quantitative PCR\nRNA was isolated from cerebral microvessels using RNAqueous-Micro kit and reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit; resultant cDNA was amplified using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (all Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) in the ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system. Quantitative PCR was performed in 96 well plate format using 50 \u03bcl total volume, with each sample run in triplicate. PCR was also run on controls in which template had not been added, in order to determine DNA contamination and primerdimer formation. RNA with no reverse transcription was also included to discount genomic DNA amplification. TNF\u03b1 (Mm00443258_m1) and IL1-\u03b2 (Mm00434228_m1) gene expression assays (Life Technologies) were used and 18S was measured as an internal control using the 18S rRNA control kit FAM-TAMRA (Eurogentec SA, Osaka, Japan). Relative quantification analysis was performed using the 2(\u2212Delta Delta C(T)) method (\nLivak et al., 2001\n).\n\nIn situ hybridization\nCloning of human CYP 2C8 and 2J2\nFragments of the human CYP 2C8 and 2J2 gene were cloned by using TOPO TA Cloning kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The forward primer (bases 869-888; 5\u2019-CAA TCC TCG GGA CTT TAT CG-3\u2019) and reverse primer (bases 1182-1163; 5\u2019-GGA CAA GGT CAC TGT ATC TC-3\u2019) for 2C8 were designed from the human 2C8 sequence (accession number\nNM_000770\n). The forward primer (bases 942-961; 5\u2019 ACC GAG ACA ACT TGG ACA AC-3\u2019) and reverse primer (bases 1347-1328; 5\u2019-ATG CCC GCT TTC CTA TTG AG-3\u2019) for 2J2 were designed from the human 2J2 sequence (accession number\nNM_000775\n). The CYP 2C8 and 2J2 fragments were amplified from aMHC-2C8 and aMHC-2J2 constructs. PCR was conducted for 40 cycles of denaturation (95\u00b0C, 45 seconds), annealing (61.6\u00b0C, 45 seconds), and extension (72\u00b0C, 1 minute). The resulting 314bp (2C8) and 406bp (2J2) products were subcloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) using the TOPO TA cloning kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. The pCR2.1-TOPO vector contains only one promoter (T7), therefore, sense and antisense probes required two separate vectors with the respective inserts in the correct orientation for sense and antisense synthesis. The vectors containing the inserts were then sequenced to confirm the direction for sense and antisense probe synthesis.\nProbe preparation\nRadioactive antisense and sense cRNA probes were transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase from the BamH1 linearized human CYP 2C8 and 2J2 constructs in the presence of 35S-uridine 5\u2019 (\u03b1-thio)triphosphate (35S-UTP). Residual DNA was digested with 2 U DNase I (Ambion Inc. Austin, Texas). The sense and antisense RNA probes were purified on a G-50 Sephadex column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).\nTissue preparation\nWild-type and transgenic animals were anesthetized, killed by decapitation and the brains sliced into 2 mm coronal blocks through the rostral forebrain. The brain blocks were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde in Sorensen buffer (0.03 M; pH 7.4) for 6 hours at 4\u00b0C, rinsed overnight in 20% buffered-sucrose solution (pH 7.4), embedded in O.C.T. (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA), and frozen in isopentane at \u221255\u00b0C. Coronal sections (20 \u03bcm) were cut on a cryostat and thaw mounted onto Superfrost Plus glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The sections were stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\nHybridization\nThe slides were postfixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in Sorensen's phosphate buffer (0.03 M, pH 7.4) for 20 minutes, rinsed with Sorenson's phosphate buffer, and treated with proteinase K (1.0 \u03bcg/ml) for 4 minutes at room temperature. Sections were then treated with 0.1 M triethanolamine (3 minutes), followed by 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 M triethanolamine (10minutes) (Sigma- Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Sections were prehybridized for 1 hour at 58\u00b0C with hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 1x Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 100 \u03bcM dithiothreitol [DTT], 200 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 125 \u03bcg/ml tRNA; Sigma- Aldrich) and then quickly rinsed in 2xSSC buffer. The 35S-labeled antisense as well as sense riboprobes were heat-denatured, diluted with hybridization buffer, and used at a final concentration of 2\u00d7104 cpm/\u03bcl. Subsequently, the sections were covered with glass coverslips, sealed, and hybridized in a moist chamber for at least 18 hours at 58\u00b0C. After hybridization, the slides were washed in 2x SSC buffer at 62\u00b0C four time with three changes, reacted with RNAse (20 \u03bcg/ml) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C, and washed in decreasing concentrations of SSC (2x, 1x, 0.5x, 0.25x) at 58\u00b0C for 10 minutes each with three changes of each solution. Finally, the slides were washed in 0.1x SSC with 1mM DTT for 45 minutes at 58\u00b0C. The slides were dehydrated in 50%, 80% and 90% ethanol with 300mM Ammonium Acetate followed by 100% ethanol for 2 minutes, placed side by side on a flat surface together with autoradiographic 14C microscales, and exposed to Hyperfilm-\u03b2max (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) for 6 days at 4\u00b0C. The films were developed in D19 developer for 5 minutes, fixed in Kodak fixer for 5 minutes. The slides were then dipped in Kodak NTB-2 nuclear track emulsion and exposed for 21 days at 4\u00b0C. Thereafter, slides were developed in D19 developer for 2 minutes, fixed in Kodak fixer for 5 minutes, counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and coverslipped.\nFilm images were scanned (HP Scanjet 7400c) and digitized images processed in Adobe Photoshop (Mountain View, CA) and Macromedia FreeHand (San Francisco, CA). Contrast and brightness were adjusted in scanned images of films to compensate for uneven illumination in brightfield images. Images of emulsion-coated slides were analyzed using a Nikon E800 microscope. Darkfield and brightfield images were captured using a Nikon DS-L1 digital camera and illustrated in Adobe Photoshop and Macromedia FreeHand software programs. Contrast and brightness were adjusted in scanned images to match the original image seen in the microscope.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nData were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Infarct size, LDP bar graph and LC/MS/MS data were analyzed with one- or two- way analysis of variance (ANOVA), as appropriate, and post hoc Dunnett's multiple comparisons test using GraphPad Prism Software (version 3.1, SPSS Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Laser Doppler perfusion data were analyzed with two-way repeated measure ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test, while qPCR data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "PTEN Deletion in the Motor Cortex\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, Irvine. Transgenic mice with a floxed exon 5 of the\nPTEN\ngene (\nPTENf/f\n) were from our local breeding colony that was established from founders obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Strain: C;129S4-Pten\ntm1Hwu\n/J, Stock number: 004597). The colony was maintained by intercrossing mice homozygous for the floxed allele.\nPTENf/f\nmice were injected on postnatal day 1 with AAV-Cre (n=22) or AAV-GFP (n=12). The vectors were AAV serotype 2, and were obtained from Vector Bio Labs (1 \u00d7 10\n13\ngenome copies/mL, Catalog number 7011). The virus was diluted with sterile-filtered PBS and 5% glycerol for a final concentration of 1 \u00d7 10\n12\ngenome copies/mL. To perform the injections, 1-day-old pups were anesthetized by hypothermia (up to 5 minutes) and placed on a clay body mold attached to the bite bar of a stereotaxic apparatus. Injections were made using a Hamilton microsyringe with a pulled glass micropipette tip. 6 mice received injections as in Liu et al. with two unilateral injections of AAV-Cre (0.5 mm lateral, 0.5 mm deep to the cortical surface, and +0.5 and 0.0 mm with respect to bregma) for a total volume of 2 \u03bcl (\nLiu et al., 2010\n). 23 mice were injected using a procedure developed in Dr. Zhigang He's lab involving three unilateral injections (0.5 mm lateral, 0.5 mm deep to the cortical surface, and +0.5, 0.00, and -0.5 mm with respect to bregma) for a final total injection volume of 1.5\u03bcl of vector (n=11 AAV-Cre and 12 AAV-GFP). After injection, pups were dipped in a few drops of sesame oil and returned to their home cages. After weaning, mice were maintained under standard vivarium conditions for 12-18 months.\nTable I\nsummarizes animals and experimental conditions.\nTable 1.\nVector\n# of Injections\nVolume/ Injection\n# of Mice\nAge (ave)\nFluorogold\nBehavior\nHistology\nAAV-Cre\n2\n1\u03bcl\n6\n415 days\nn=1\n-\nH&E, n=6 pS6, n=6 PTEN, n=6\nAAV-Cre\n3\n0.5\u03bcl\n11\n406 days\nn=5\nRotarod, Open Field, n=9\nCleaved caspase-3, n=2 Cresyl Violet, n=2 GABA, n= 3 GFAP, n=6 H&E, n=11 Cell density and cortical thickness analysis in H&E, n=5 Ki-67, n=3 pS6, n=12 PTEN, n=12\nAAV-GFP\n3\n0.5\u03bcl\n12\n388 days\nn=2\nRotarod, Open Field, n=12\nCleaved caspase-3, n=1 Cresyl Violet, n=2 GABA GFAP, n=2 GFP, n=12 H&E, n=12 Ki-67, n=2 pS6, n=12 PTEN, n=12\nOpen in a new tab\n\nRotarod Assessment of Motor Coordination\nAnimals with\nPTEN\ndeletion (n=9) and AAV-GFP injected controls (n=12) were tested for motor coordination when they were 48 to 53 weeks of age (51.6 weeks of age, on average). Mice were placed individually in each of the four chambers on the rod of a Rotarod\u00ae (San Diego Instruments) were allowed to acclimate to the stationary rod for 30 seconds before starting every trial. Initial speed of the rotorod was set to 3 RPM and acceleration was set at 1 RPM/second. Mice were allowed to stay on the rod until they fell off or up to a maximum of two minutes, for a total of 7 trials/day. The first two trials were considered training trials, and the next 5 were testing trials. The time at which the mice fell from the rod during the testing trials (if at all) was recorded.\nPTEN\ndeletion was assessed by immunocytochemistry (see below) and data from 3 mice with\nPTEN\ndeletion located outside of the motor cortex were excluded from the statistical analysis, leaving a final n=6 for the\nPTEN\ndeletion group.\n\nOpen Field Test\nThe same mice that were tested using the Rotarod were also tested for general locomotion and spatial learning in the open field (9 animals with\nPTEN\ndeletion and 12 animals with AAV-GFP). A 24-inch by 24-inch dark plexiglass box was used for the open field test. A 3-inch by 3-inch grid was drawn onto the bottom of the plexiglass box. The grid had four different colored zones, a center square, and the corner squares marked. The four differently colored zones were determined based on their proximity to the center square. The lines that comprised the outer two zones were considered \u201couter\u201d, while the lines of the inner two zones and the center square were considered \u201cinner\u201d lines. Individual mice were placed in the center of the box and allowed to explore freely for 5 minutes. One observer recorded total grid line crossings by forepaws, noting whether the lines crossed were \u201couter\u201d or \u201cinner\u201d lines. The second observer recorded other events such as defecation, urination, grooming, and rearing. Open field activity was tested once a day for four consecutive days.\n\nRetrograde tracing of the cells of origin of the CST with Fluorogold\nAt approximately 1 year of age, mice that had received AAV-Cre (n=6) or AAV-GFP (n=2) received bilateral injections of the retrograde tracer Fluorogold (FG) into the spinal cord. Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and a laminectomy was performed to expose the spinal cord at C5. 0.2\u03bcl of 1% FG was injected with a Hamilton syringe bilaterally from the midline (0.5mm lateral, 0.5mm deep) over 1 minute. The syringe was left in place for an additional minute. After completing the injections, the skin was closed with sutures and staples, and mice were kept on a 37\u00b0C water circulating heating pad until they recovered from the anesthetic. Mice received subcutaneous injections of buprenorphine, Baytril, and lactated Ringer's solution twice a day for 3 days post surgery, and were allowed to remain in their home cages for 3 (n=7) to 4 (n=1) days before tissue collection.\n\nTissue Collection and Immunohistochemistry\nAt 12-18 months of age, mice received intraperitoneal injections of Euthasol (1mL/300g), and were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brain and spinal cord were dissected and post-fixed in PFA overnight, then placed in 30% sucrose solution in PBS overnight for cryoprotection. Brains were embedded in OCT compound and frozen in a container of methyl butane surrounded by ethanol/dry ice slush. 20\u03bcm thick coronal sections were collected at 200\u03bcm intervals and stored in PBS with 0.1% sodium azide at 4\u00b0C until staining.\nSections were either directly mounted for Fluorogold visualization under fluorescent microscopy, stained for H&E or cresyl violet, or immunostained (see\nTable I\nfor summary). To visualize GFP signal in the control animals, we examined unstained sections for GFP fluorescence and immunostained sections for GFP.\nFor immunostaining for cleaved caspase-3, Ki67, pS6, and PTEN, an antigen retrieval protocol was used in which sections were placed in 1.7ml Eppendorf tubes with 1 mL 10mM citrate buffer, pH 8.80. Tubes were then immersed in boiling water for 5 minutes, followed by immediate immersion in an ice bath for 10 minutes. Sections immunostained for GFP were incubated in 1% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 20 minutes to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. Primary antibodies and dilutions were as follows: PTEN (Cell signaling, 1:250), pS6 (Cell signaling, 1:250, #4858), GABA (1:500), GFAP (Sigma, 1:1000), GFP (Lifetech, 1:1500), Ki-67 (Thermo Scientific, 1:200), Cleaved caspase-3 (BD Biosciences, 1:250), GFP (Lifetech, 1:1000). Antibodies were diluted in Blocking Reagent for cleaved caspase-3, pS6, and PTEN (PerkinElmer), 5% secondary antibody host serum in PBS with 0.5% Triton (GABA, GFAP, Ki67), or 5% secondary host serum in TBS with 0.1% Triton (GFP).\nSections were incubated in primary antibody dilutions overnight at room temperature, with the exception of GABA, which was incubated for 36-48 hours at 4\u00b0C. Secondary antibodies were diluted in the same blocking solution as the respective primary, and applied for two hours at room temperature. For immunofluorescence, Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 (ThermoFisher Scientific, both at 1:250 dilution) were used. For sections undergoing DAB detection and fluorescent amplification, a biotinylated IgG secondary antibody was used (Vector Laboratories, 1:250 dilution). Following secondary incubation, sections were washed 3\u00d7, incubated for 1 hour with avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) and reacted with DAB (DAB Substrate Kit for Peroxidase, Vector Laboratories) or FITC (made in house, 1:250 in 0.003% H\n2\nO\n2\nborate buffer).\n\nLayer V Pyramidal Cell Size Measurements\nTo determine the effect of\nPTEN\ndeletion on pyramidal neurons that give rise to the CST, cortical sections from AAV-Cre injected animals that had received intra-spinal FG injections were analyzed. Immunostaining for PTEN using a DAB reaction quenched FG fluorescence in PTEN-positive CST neurons whereas fluorescence was still prominent in CST neurons lacking PTEN. We then measured the cross sectional area of 50 PTEN-negative/FG positive CST neurons per animal. For control cells we used the nearest neighboring unstained section and visualized FG signal in the contralateral cortex in unstained sections. This allowed us to specifically measure PTEN-positive layer V pyramidal cells.\n\nMeasurement of Cortical Thickness and Assessment of Cortical Lamination\nIt has previously been reported that promoter-driven\nPTEN\ndeletion in the forebrain results in cortical enlargement. To assess this, we measured the thickness of the cortex (distance from the edge of the corpus callosum to the pial surface) in H&E stained-sections within the area of deletion (n=5 mice). The region of\nPTEN\ndeletion was verified in a nearby section that had been immunostained for PTEN. To examine changes in cortical laminar patterning, we screened H&E-stained sections from animals with\nPTEN\ndeletion and compared the region of deletion to the homotopic contralateral control cortex.\n\nMeasurement of Cell Density\nTo determine whether conditional postnatal\nPTEN\ndeletion results in altered cell density in the motor cortex we performed point-counting analysis. H&E stained sections within the region of\nPTEN\ndeletion were imaged at 20\u00d7 along with images from the control cortex contralateral to the\nPTEN\ndeletion. These images were then overlaid with a 50\u03bcm grid and analyzed in ImageJ for the number of grid crosshairs overlying cells vs. cell-free neuropil (154 maximum). This value was then used to calculate the relative area of neuropil vs. cell bodies."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale C57BL/6J mice were acquired from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) at 5-6 weeks of age to maintain consistency with previous studies of acquired epilepsy (\nStewart et al., 2009\n;\nStewart et al., 2010\n;\nUmpierre et al., 2014\n). Animals were maintained in temperature- and humidity-controlled rooms on a 12-h light-dark cycle (lights on at 6am), and provided free access to food and water. Mice were group housed for acute studies, or singly housed for chronic monitoring after the placement of a cortical electrode. All procedures performed in this study adhered to the standards of the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n\nRepeated low-dose KA injection and behavioral seizure monitoring\nAfter a 3-5 d acclimation period, a subset of mice were systemically injected (i.p.) with KA following one of four dosing paradigms. Kainic acid (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) was dissolved overnight in sterile isotonic saline prior to an experiment and kept for use no longer than 7d. To reduce variability, all solutions were made from the same vial of kainic acid. Valproic acid (VPA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used to reduce seizure activity in a subset of paradigms, since pharmacoresistance to benzodiazepines can occur during SE (\nMayer et al., 2002\n;\nNaylor et al., 2005\n).\nIn the \u201cprotracted KA/VPA\u201d injection paradigm, animals (N=10; weight: 18-22g) received an initial 5 mg/kg injection of KA followed by repeated 2.5 mg/kg injections, all separated by 20 minutes, until the first Racine stage 4/5 seizure was observed (\nRacine, 1972\n), defined as forelimb clonus with rearing (stage 4), possibly escalating into loss of postural control (stage 5). Any animal displaying two additional Racine stage 4/5 seizures within 90 minutes of the first seizure was considered to have undergone behavioral SE (\nShibley and Smith, 2002\n)\u2014inclusion criteria for histological and immunofluorescent analyses. Ninety minutes after the first Racine stage 4/5 seizure was observed, seizure activity was reduced by VPA (300 mg/kg, i.p.). For behavioral seizure monitoring, seizures were not scored by a reviewer blinded to paradigm.\nIn the \u201cexpedited KA/VPA (ex-KA/VPA)\u201d or \u201cexpedited KA/NaCl (ex-KA/NaCl)\u201d injection paradigms, animals (weight: 19-22g) received an initial 10 mg/kg injection of KA, a 5 mg/kg injection, and then repeated 2.5 mg/kg injections until the first Racine stage 4/5 seizure was observed. All injections were separated by 20 min. The criteria for behavioral SE remained identical to the protracted KA/VPA paradigm. However, after 90 minutes of SE, animals were either injected with VPA (300 mg/kg, i.p.; ex-KA/VPA paradigm, N=6) or sterile saline (200\u03bcl, i.p.; ex-KA/NaCl paradigm, N=10).\nFinally, we tested a previously published low-dose KA paradigm with modifications. In this \u201c5 mg/kg\u201d injection paradigm, animals (N=3; weight: 20-24g) received 5 mg/kg injections of KA every 20 minutes until an initial Racine stage 5 seizure was observed, modified from (\nTse et al., 2014\n). Animals displaying an initial Racine stage 3 seizure received a 2.5 mg/kg injection if a Racine stage 4/5 seizure was not observed before the time of next injection. To enhance and prolong SE, animals that did not display a behavioral seizure 45-60 minutes after an initial seizure were given a final 2.5 mg/kg booster dose of KA. No anti-seizure drug was administered in this paradigm.\nAge-matched control animals (NaCl/VPA, N=5) received an equivalent number of 100\u03bcl injections (i.p.) of sterile isotonic saline, which approximated the fluid volume of KA injections. Control animals were injected with VPA (300 mg/kg, i.p.) 2h after an initial saline injection.\nFor all paradigms, lactated Ringer's solution (500ul, s.c.) was administered to control and KA-treated mice two hours after the final injection and on any day in which body weight had dropped \u22650.5g compared to the previous day.\n\nEEG implant for acute and chronic monitoring\nA subset of mice (weight range: 20-28g) was anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine anesthesia (80 mg/kg ketamine, 12 mg/kg xylazine, i.p.) and a cortical electrode (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA) was placed above the left parietal cortex, or a bipolar depth electrode was placed into the CA1 cell body layer of ventral hippocampus (anteroposterior (AP): \u22122.7; mediolateral (ML): +2.0; dorsoventral (DV): \u22121.5). Electrodes were secured by super glue (Loctite 454, Westlake, OH) against three anchor screws. Animals were allowed 7-14d to recover. During recording, electrodes were connected via flexible tether to a rotating commutator (Plastics One) connected to an EEG100C amplifier (BioPac Systems, Goleta, CA), which filtered signal below 1Hz and above 100Hz. Custom programming (\nThomson and White, 2014\n) allowed for continuous EEG data to be synchronized in real time with video monitoring of animal behavior and written to disk for later review.\nTo monitor electrographic SE, one hour of baseline EEG was recorded before cohorts were injected with KA according to the ex-KA/VPA, ex-KA/NaCl, or 5 mg/kg KA paradigm (\nTse et al., 2014\n). Changes in electrographic power (1-100Hz, 90s window, 45s step) during KA injections were plotted across a 24h period that included 1h of baseline activity used to normalize EEG power spectra. Post-processing was performed in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA), using the Chronux Toolbox (\nhttp://chronux.org/\n). Additionally, a trained reviewer, blinded to paradigm, counted and scored corresponding behavioral seizures during SE using standard Racine stage 1-5 scoring criteria. The number of convulsive motor seizures (Racine stage 3-5) and the seizure burden (aggregate of all Racine behavioral seizure scores) was calculated over a 24h period beginning at the time of first injection.\nVideo EEG monitoring persisted for 7-8 weeks and was reviewed for spontaneous recurrent seizures by a reviewer blinded to kainate paradigm. A second, reviewer (not blinded) confirmed spontaneous seizures. Age-matched animals injected with saline and VPA (NaCl/VPA) served as controls across an identical period. An experienced reviewer manually investigated EEG traces for the presence of interictal spikes, defined as transient electrographic events 3x the baseline signal amplitude. A clustering of >10 spikes within a 5 minute period was common to observe and served as the criteria for designating an animal as spiking or non-spiking within a 12-h period.\n\nTissue processing for staining\nA subset of animals that underwent behavioral SE (\nTable 1\n) were sacrificed 7d after SE. Briefly, animals were deeply anesthetized with 60 mg/kg pentobarbital (i.p.) and transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Whole brains were removed and allowed to post-fix in 4% PFA for 6-8 h at 4\u00b0C before being transferred to a 15/30% sucrose solution for overnight cryoprotection. Coronal sections containing the medial and ventral hippocampus were sliced on a freezing stage microtome and stored at 4\u00b0C in 0.1M PBS for staining.\nTable 1.\nParadigms tested for acute pathological features\nParadigm\nKA (m/k, i.p.)\nVPA (m/k, i.p.)\nN\nTime to 1\nst\nSeizure\n1\nTotal Dose\n2\n(m/k, i.p.)\nSE induction % (N)\nMortality\n3\n% (N)\nStaining\nHigh Dose\n25\n--\n10\n<5 min.\n25\n100% (10)\n100% (10)\nN/A\nProtracted KA/VPA\n5\u21922.5x\n300\n10\n120-140\n20-22.5\n90% (9)\n0% (0)\nFJB, GFAP\n4\nEx-KA/VPA\n10\u21925\u21922.5x\n300\n6\n60-120\n20-22.5\n83% (5)\n0% (0)\nFJB, GFAP, mGluR5\nEx-KA/NaCl\n10\u21925\u21922.5x\n--\n10\n80-140\n22.5-25\n60% (6)\n0% (0)\nFJB, GFAP, mGluR5\nOpen in a new tab\nKainate, KA; VPA, valproic acid; FJB, FluoroJade-B; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; mGluR5, metabotropic glutamate receptor 5;\n\u2018x\u2019 denotes repeated KA injections (i.p.) every 20 minutes until the first Racine stage 4/5 seizure was observed\n1\nSeizure is a Racine stage 4/5 seizure\n2\nTotal Dose is the aggregate dose of KA administered before first seizure\n3\nMortality encompasses a 7d period of observation\n4\nAnalyses were performed but not reported due to the inefficiency of the paradigm\n\nHistology, Immunofluorescence, and Imaging\nFluoroJade-B staining\nFluoroJade-B (FJB) staining was performed using two medial hippocampal slices per animal and batch processed similarly to published methods (\nMcCord et al., 2008\n), except sections were blocked for 27 min. in 0.06% KMnO\n4\nand stained for dying neurons for 15 min using a 0.0004% FJB solution. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axio Imager A1 microscope at 20x magnification. The DAPI filter was used to identify regions of interest before images were acquired using the TRITC filter (FJB). After acquisition, images of hippocampal subregions were masked such that they only contained stratum pyramidale (CA3 or CA1) or the hilus. No masking was performed in the thalamic or amygdala regions. FJB-positive area was quantified in Image-J through the following procedures: files were converted to 8-bit black and white images, pixel intensity was inverted, a uniform threshold was established, and a pixel to micron scale factor was set in order to quantify the FJB-positive pixel area per image using the \u2018analyze particles\u2019 tool.\nmGluR5 and GFAP staining\nFor immunofluorescent (IF) staining, sections were plated in 0.1M PBS and allowed to dry before permeabilizing for 1h in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. For colocalization studies, sections (N=2/animal) were washed once in PBS and exposed to mGluR5 primary antibody (Rabbit polyclonal mGluR5, AB5675, Millipore; 1:500 in Cyto-Q) or Cyto-Q alone (primary omission) overnight at 4\u00b0C. For astrogliosis studies, sections (N=2/animal) were exposed to Cyto-Q overnight. Excess primary antibody was removed by PBS washes and secondary antibodies were applied for 1.5h at room temperature. For colocalization studies, an AlexaFluor 488 antibody was used to detect the mGluR5 primary antibody (goat anti-rabbit, 1:1000 in PBS; A11034, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and a pre-conjugated GFAP antibody was used to detect astrocytes (GFAP-Cy3, 1:1000 in PBS, C9205, Sigma). For astrogliosis studies, tissue was processed with pre-conjugated GFAP-Cy3 antibody alone (Sigma). Secondary antibodies were removed by repeated PBS washes before applying DAPI for 10 minutes as a counterstain. A final PBS wash was performed before using Pro-Long Gold to mount slides.\nSections were imaged using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope at 20x resolution. For colocalization studies, laser power for the mGluR5 channel was set at a level at which virtually no signal could be detected in primary omission slides. Using primary omission slides, a colocalization threshold was set as the average colocalized area between the GFAP and AlexaFluor 488 in the absence of mGluR5 primary antibody. This value represents the level of aberrant colocalization due to non-specific secondary staining. For astrogliosis and colocalization studies, laser power for the GFAP channel was set at a level which best produced a linear range of signal between control and KA-lesioned tissue. Regions of interest were pre-selected using the DAPI channel before acquiring z-stacks (1 \u03bcm step size). Z-stacks were converted to 8-bit tiff images for each channel and processed using Image-J. We used a previously established method for quantifying receptor colocalization with astrocytes (\nVargas et al., 2013\n). GFAP staining was processed and quantified identically to FluoroJade-B staining in Image-J using the \u2018analyze particles\u2019 tool, except the regions surrounding the CA3 and CA1 cell body layers were not masked.\nStatistics\nGiven our goal of determining pathological changes between KA and control animals, non-seized animals were not included in the ultimate statistical design. Due to the prolonged time course of inducing SE under the protracted KA/VPA paradigm, the paradigm was not adopted for future studies and was not considered in the statistical design. For analyses of astrogliosis, cell death (FluoroJade-B), and mGluR5 colocalization, a one-way ANOVA design was utilized with a Dunnett's post-hoc comparison to controls. Given the variability inherent in pathology, results are displayed as a box-and-whisker distribution, containing the minimum, maximum, and median of each group, plotted on a logarithmic scale (log\n10\n). A p-value below 0.05 was considered significant in post-hoc testing. All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA)."

    "Methods": "Animals and Ethical Statement\nSMN\u03947 SMA mice (\nSMN2\n+/+\n;SMN\u03947\n+/+\n;mSmn\n\u2212/\u2212\n) were generated from male and female carrier mice of the genotype\nSMN2\n+/+\n;SMN\u03947\n+/+\n;mSmn\n+/\u2212\n(line 4299;\nFVB.Cg-Tg(SMN2*delta7)4299Ahmb Tg(SMN2)89Ahmb Smn1\ntm1Msd\n). These mice originated from our colony but can be obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (#005025). As diet can affect the survival and phenotype of these study mice (\nButchbach et al., 2010a\n) as well as responsiveness to drugs like trichostatin A and D156844 (\nButchbach et al., 2014\n;\nNarver et al., 2008\n), the mice were fed the Harlan-Teklad 22/5 Rodent Diet. Neonatal offspring were genotyped using a PCR-based assay on genomic DNA from tail biopsies as described previously (\nButchbach et al., 2007b\n;\nLe\net al.\n, 2005\n). All experiments were conducted in accordance with the protocols described in the National Institutes of Health\nGuide for the Care and Use of Animals\nand were approved by the Ohio State University Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nDrug Formulations\nButyrate (BA; sodium salt, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in ddH\n2\nO. Sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA; Lancaster Synthesis Inc., Ward Hill, MA) was dissolved in ddH\n2\nO and solubilized by adjusting the pH to ~7.0 with concentrated NaOH. In most cases, the 4PBA solution (sodium salt) was heated to facilitate solubilization; the pH of the 4PBA solution was readjusted to 7.0 after cooling to room temperature. Glyceryl butyrate (BA3G, tributyrin; Sigma-Aldrich) and VX563 (Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA) were used as supplied by the manufacturer. All aqueous solutions were filter sterilized prior to injections.\n\nDrug Administration\nBeginning at 4 days after birth (PND04), SMA mice and their non-SMA littermates were treated with either BA (5 g/kg/d t.i.d.), 4PBA (500 mg/kg/d t.i.d.), BA3G (5 g/kg/d b.i.d.), VX563 (6 g/kg/d b.i.d.) or H\n2\nO by oral administration using a curved 18-gauge feeding needle (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) as described previously (\nButchbach et al., 2007b\n). The selection of drug dose was based on either the dose used for similar studies or the maximum tolerable dose provided by the drug manufacturer. For b.i.d. dosing, the drugs were administered at 09.00 and 17.00 daily while those drugs with a t.i.d. dosing were administered at 09.00, 13.00 and 17.00 daily without fail. We have found that variable time intervals between dosings negate any therapeutic benefit (unpublished observations). Drugs were administered to mice until the last SMA pup in the litter perished. Due to the physicochemical properties of these compounds, it was not possible for the person dosing the neonatal mice to be blinded to drug treatment. For all of the subsequent analyses, however, the persons completing these analyses were blinded with respect to treatment cohort.\n\nBehavior Analysis\nA cohort of drug-treated SMN\u03947 SMA mice was assessed for changes in vectorial movement duration, spontaneous locomotor activity and pivoting activity as described (\nButchbach et al., 2007a\n). All of the measures were collected using Stopwatch+ (Center for Behavioral Neuroscience, Atlanta, GA). For vectorial movement duration, the amount of time each mouse was in vectorial movement, either crawling at PND07 or walking at PND11 and PND14, within the viewing timeframe was collected. For spontaneous locomotor activity, each pup was placed in the center of a gridded (with 28 2.5-cm\n2\ngrids) arena and the number of grids crossed in 60 sec was counted. For pivoting, each pup was placed in the center of a gridded arena and the number of times the pup turned 90\u00b0C (pivots) during a 60-sec time frame was counted. Spontaneous locomotor activity and pivoting were monitored on PND07, PND11 and PND14. To minimize the stress on the pup, all motor phenotype assays were conducted simultaneously.\n\nDetection of BA Levels\nNeonatal mice received a single dose of each drug or vehicle; the forebrain was dissected and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen one hour after injection. Tissue BA levels were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to detect 2-nitrophenylhydrazide derivatives as described (\nMiwa and Yamamoto, 1987\n). Briefly, 50 \u00b5L methanol were added to 50 \u00b5L forebrain extracts and centrifuged at 14,000\u00d7g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C to precipitate protein. 100 \u00b5L of butyrate standard (125-10,000 pmol butyric acid; Sigma-Aldrich) or tissue extract containing 500 pmol 2-ethylbutyric acid (2-EtBA; Sigma-Aldrich) as an internal standard were mixed with 400 \u00b5L 125 mM 1-EDC\u00b7HCl (N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N\u2019-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride; Sigma-Aldrich) + 1.5 % (v/v) pyridine (Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol and 200 \u00b5L 20 mM 2-NPH\u00b7HCl (2-nitrophenylhydrazine hydrochloride; Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 20 min at 60\u00b0C. 100 \u00b5L 15% (w/v) KOH in methanol:water (4:1) were added to each sample and incubated for 15 min at 60\u00b0C. The samples were then cooled to room temperature. Separation of fatty acid derivatives was accomplished using a Shimadzu liquid chromatograph with a UV-visible detector. A Prevail C8 column (particle size of 5 \u00b5m; 250 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm; Grace Davison Discovery Sciences, Columbia, MD) fitted with an Adsorbosphere C8 guard cartridge (particle size of 5 \u00b5m; 7.5 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm; Grace Davison Discovery Sciences) was used. Separation was carried out isocratically using methanol:water (58%:42%) at room temperature. A representative chromatogram showing the elution profiles of BA and 2-EtBA derivatives is shown in the\nSupplementary Figure\n.\n\nQuantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)\nTotal RNA was isolated from spinal cords of SMN\u03947 SMA mice treated with drugs for 5 days using RNeasy Mini columns (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD) according to manufacturer\u2019s directions. Quantification of\nFL-SMN\nmRNA transcript levels was accomplished using real time RT-PCR, or qRT-PCR, as described previously (\nSimard et al., 2007\n) with modifications. The quantities of\nFL-SMN\ntranscript were then normalized to a geometric mean of three different reference transcripts (\nVandesompele et al., 2002\n):\nhypoxanthine phosphorylribosyltransferase 1\n(\nHprt1\n),\n\u03b2-actin\n(\nActb\n) and\nRNA polymerase IIA\n(\nPol2A\n). These normalized quantities were then compared to vehicle-treated carrier mRNA samples.\n\nImmunoblot\nSpinal cords from animals treated with drugs for 5 days were dissected and homogenized in lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 and Complete Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche Life Sciences, Indianapolis, IN) dissolved in PBS, pH 7.4). These samples were resolved through SDS-PA gels via electrophoresis and transferred onto PVDF membranes via electroblotting as described previously (\nButchbach et al., 2010b\n). For the detection of SMN protein, 100 \u00b5g of tissue protein extract was added to each lane of a midi-gel; 10 \u00b5g of protein extract was added to each lane of a mini-gel for detection of all other proteins. Immunoblotting was completed as described in (\nButchbach et al., 2010b\n). The following primary antibodies were used in this study: mouse anti-SMN mAb (1:500; MANSMA2, (\nYoung et al., 2000\n), Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), mouse anti-\u03b2-actin mAb (1:20000; clone AC-15, Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-histone H3 pAb (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), rabbit anti-acetyl-histone H3(K9) pAb (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-Akt pAb (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (S473) mAb (1:1000; clone 193H12, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-GSK3\u03b2 mAb (1:1000; clone 27C10, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-phospho-GSK3\u03b2 (S9) mAb (1:1000; clone 5B3, Cell Signaling Technology) and rabbit anti-GAPDH pAb (1:10000; Sigma-Aldrich). Band intensities were measured using ImageJ 1.45s (National Institutes of Health).\n\nSMN Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)\nQuantitation of SMN protein levels in spinal cord extracts was measured using the SMN (human) Enzyme Immunometric Assay from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY) as described in (\nNguyen thi Man et al., 2008\n) except that 40 \u00b5g of spinal cord extract were used for each sample. SMN concentrations were expressed as pg SMN per mL extract.\n\nsnRNP Assembly\nIn vitro\nsnRNP assembly assays were run on tissue extracts from normal and SMN\u03947 SMA mice treated with drugs for 5 days. Preparation of mouse tissue extracts and snRNP assembly experiments were carried out essentially as previously described (\nGabanella et al., 2007\n;\nGabanella et al., 2005\n). The amount of immunoprecipitated U1 snRNAs was quantified using a STORM 860 Phosphorimager (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and the ImageQuant version 4.2 software.\n\nHistology\nSMN\u03947 SMA mice and carrier littermates were treated with BA, 4PBA, VX563 or vehicle beginning at PND04 until PND11. Treated mice were anesthetized with 2.5% Avertin and then transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in S\u00f8rensen\u2019s phosphate buffer (100 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\nand 100 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, pH 7.4). The lumbar spinal cords were postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in S\u00f8rensen\u2019s phosphate buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by cryoprotection with 30% sucrose in ddH\n2\nO overnight at 4\u00b0C. The lumbar spinal cords were sectioned coronally at a thickness of 25 \u00b5m using the MultiBrain\u00ae Technology by NeuroScience Associates (Knoxville, TN). Every 12\nth\nsection block was mounted onto a glass slide and stained with 1% Cresyl violet as described in (\nLe et al., 2005\n).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nData are expressed as means \u00b1 standard error and were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with a Bonferonni\npost hoc\ntest or unpaired t-tests. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed on lifespan and onset of body mass loss data using the Mantel-Cox log rank\npost hoc\ntest. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS v.22.0."

    "Methods": "Animals\nTs65Dn and euploid fetuses from 20 litters were generated by mating Ts65Dn females (Stock No. 005252 without the mutant Pde6b allele impacting retinal degeneration) with C57BL/6JEi \u00d7 C3SnHeSnJ (\nB6EiC3\n) F1 hybrid males (Stock No. 003647), both obtained from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Seventeen euploids and fifteen Ts65Dn males were used for developmental milestone tests. From these animals, fourteen euploids and fifteenTs65Dn mice were chosen for their proximity in birthdates for adult behavior assessment. Weaning was performed at postnatal day (PND) 21 and sibling males were housed regardless of genotype. Animals were kept in the same cage until two weeks prior to the onset of adult behavioral assessments. Between the end of the behavioral assessment at 2 months of age and the completion of the behavioral assessment at 11 months of age, 5 Ts65Dn died. PCR genotyping was performed on genomic DNA extracted from tail tips. Genotyping was performed on the day of birth. For genotyping, we used primers previously described (\nReinholdt et al., 2011\n). Mutant primers: Chr17fwd-5\u2032-GTGGCAAGAGACTCAAATTCAAC-3\u2032 and Chr16rev-5\u2032-TGGCTTATTATTATCAGGGCATTT-3\u2032. These primers amplify a 275 bp product. Positive control primers: IMR8545_5\u2032-AAAGTCGCTCTGAGTTGTTAT-3\u2032 and IMR8546_5\u2032GGAGCGGGAGAAATGGATATG-3\u2032. These primers amplify a 600 bp product from the Rosa locus. The PCR cycling conditions were: Step 1: 95 \u00b0C for 2 min; Step 2: 95 \u00b0C for 20 sec; Step 3: 55 \u00b0C for 30 sec; Step 4: 72 \u00b0C for 45 sec (Steps 2\u20134, 40 cycles); Step 5: 72 \u00b0C 5 min., followed by a final 5 min extension at 72 \u00b0C and hold at 4 \u00b0C. PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel.\n\nBehavioral testing\nAll experiments involving animals were performed in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. Standard rodent chow and water were available ad libitum. In addition to standard bedding, a Nestlet square was provided in each cage. The colony room was maintained on a 12:12 light/dark cycle, with lights on at 7:00 AM. All experiments were conducted in the light phase, between 8:00 AM and 1:00 PM. To minimize olfactory cues from previous trials, each apparatus was thoroughly cleaned with 10% ethanol after each animal. Each day of testing, mice were left in their home cages in the room used for the experiment at least 1 h prior to the onset of the study for habituation. All behavioral tests were performed blindly without prior knowledge of genotype. Water T-maze and Morris water-maze tasks were the last experiments in the series.\n\nDevelopmental Milestones\nTs65Dn pups and euploid littermate males were tested according to previous studies (\nFox, 1965\n;\nJ.M. Hill, 2008\n). A comprehensive set of neonatal behavioral tests to measure different sensory and motor development parameters were used including 1) body righting and coordination (surface righting, air righting and negative geotaxis), 2) motor strength (cliff aversion and forelimb grasp), 3) sensory system maturation (rooting, auditory startle, ear twitch and eye opening), and 4) extinction of rotatory behavior (open field). Briefly, the dam was temporarily transferred to a clean cage and then pups were placed with nesting material in a small bowl positioned on a heating pad at 37 \u00b0C. One pup was assessed at a time and was placed back into the home cage nest once finished its assessment. The time each pup was out of their home nest ranged from 3 min to 12 min. To mark the pups individually, we tattoed forelimbs and/or hindlimbs on PND0 using a sterile needle filled with non-toxic green ink. Pups were evaluated each day from PND0 to 21. Only weight data was collected and no other tests were performed on PND0. The amount of time (latency) or presence/absence of reflex was recorded and analyzed by a single experimenter. To calculate a developmental milestones (DM) score, we normalized the data to a 1 to 10 scale using the following formula; y = 1 + (x\u2212A) * (10\u22121)/B\u2212A where x = data points, A = lowest score, B = highest score.\n\nNest-building\nMice were individually housed for at least 48 h in clean plastic cages with approximately 1 cm of bedding lining the floor and identification cards coded to render the experimenter blind to genotype of each subject. Around 6pm, one hour prior to the dark phase of the lighting cycle, animals were placed in new individual cage supplied with 3 g of Nestlet material (pressed cotton squares). The next morning (15 h later) cages were assessed for nest construction. Nest construction was scored using a slightly modified version of Deacon\u2019s scoring system (\nDeacon, 2006\n). Briefly, in this 6 point scale, 0= Nestlet intact, 1= >90% intact Nestlet, 2= Nestlet partially torn up, 3= Nestlet mostly shredded but no identifiable nest site, 4= an identifiable but flat nest, 5= Nestlet torn >90% and a clear nest crater.\n\nSpontaneous alternation\nThe natural tendency to explore was assessed using the continuous variant of the spontaneous alternation procedure, as described previously (\nO\u2019Tuathaigh et al., 2007\n;\nDesbonnet et al., 2012\n). Briefly, without prior habituation, animals were placed individually in the center of the maze and allowed to explore freely for 6 min. A video camera, mounted centrally above the maze, recorded each session. Alternation between arms, the number of arm entries, distance moved and velocity of movement were analyzed using Ethovision videotracking (Ethovision\u00ae, Noldus). The maze was made of opaque acrylic glass (Plastic-Craft, New York, USA). An arm entry was scored when four limbs were inside the arm. Spontaneous alternation was defined as successive entries into the three arms of the Y-maze, in overlapping triplet sets, with arm choices differing from the previous two choices expressed as a percentage of the total number of arm entries: percent alternation = [number of alternations/(total number of arm entries \u2212 2)] \u00d7 100 (chance level = 50%).\n\nWater T-maze\nThe Water T-maze (WTM) used was constructed from transparent Plexiglas (Plastic Craft Product Corp). Each arm is 20 cm long and 7 cm wide. The T-maze was filled with tap water and made opaque with white non-toxic paint (Crayola). The temperature of the water was maintained at 24 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C. The platform is a 5 cm x 5 cm square made from Plexiglas and was submerged during the experiments. A recent study has been published using this behavioral paradigm (\nFrost et al., 2015\n). Mice were given 10 trials per day with an inter-trial interval (ITI) of approximately 5\u20138 min. Mice were released from two different locations (N or S) and were trained to find the location of the submerged platform in one of the arms (E). When mice were released from S or N, the other arm was blocked with a Plexiglas rectangle. Mice scored an error (0) when they swam two thirds of the wrong arm and scored a correct choice (1) when they found the platform. Once mice reached between 80\u2013100% of correct choices, the platform was moved to the opposite arm for reversal learning (W). When mice reached 80\u2013100% of correct choices, the platform was moved again to its first location (E) for assessing double reversal learning. Any errors before successfully finding the platform were scored as perseverative errors. Errors made after an errorless trial were scored as regressive errors. The time spent to find the platform in the first two trials for reversal and double reversal learning was also measured.\n\nMorris water maze\nSpatial and reversal learning were assessed in the Morris water maze (MWM) using procedures and equipment as previously described (\nYang et al., 2012\n). The apparatus was a circular pool, 125 cm in diameter, filled with tap water rendered opaque with the addition of non-toxic white paint (Crayola). Water temperature was maintained at 24 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C to reduce stress and potential hypothermia (\nStasko and Costa, 2004\n). To facilitate spatial learning, room cues made of black and white cardboard were added to the walls surrounding the pool. Trials were videotaped and scored with Ethovision video tracking software (Noldus, Actimetrics, Inc., Wilmette, IL). The order of training was: cued trials, hidden acquisition trials, probe trial, hidden reversal trials and a final probe trial. Cued, acquisition and reversal training consisted of 4 trials a day. Each trial began by lowering the mouse into the water close to the pool edge in one of the 3 non-target quadrants. The start location for each trial was alternated in a semi-random order for each mouse. For cued training, the pool was surrounded by white curtains to occlude the extra-maze cues. The submerged platform was cued by means of a metal stick attached to a 5 cm high black ball and placed pseudo-randomly in different locations across trials. For the acquisition and reversal training, the hidden platform remained in the same quadrant for all trials for a given mouse. Mice were allowed a maximum of 60 sec to reach the platform. A mouse that failed to reach the platform in 60 sec was guided to the platform by the experimenter. Mice were left on the platform for 15 sec before being removed by the experimenter\u2019s hand. After each trial, subjects were put in a cage lined with absorbent paper towels. To confirm that the spatial learning task was acquired after acquisition and reversal training by using distal environmental room cues, subjects were tested in a 60 sec probe trial, 24 h after the completion of the last training session. Reversal training began the day following the probe test in which the hidden platform was moved to the opposite quadrant. Parameters recorded during training days were latency to reach the platform, total distance swum, swimming speed and time spent in the periphery. Parameters recorded during the probe trial were (a) time spent in each quadrant, (b) number of virtual crossings over the trained platform location and (c) proximity as described previously (\nMaei et al., 2009\n).\n\nHierarchical clustering analysis\nTwo-way hierarchical clustering analysis was performed by Ward\u2019s method with Euclidian distance using the JMP software package (SAS, Cary, NC). All behavioral data was normalized to Z-scores prior to analysis by the clustering algorithm. Similarly, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using JMP.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using Sigmaplot (Systat Software, Inc.). For developmental milestones and spontaneous alternation, mean was calculated and unpaired\nt-\ntests were performed. Two-side Fischer-exact test (FET) was used to determine statistical significance daily in developmental milestones. For adult behavioral tests, we employed two-way repeated measure ANOVA and the post hoc Tukey test for MWM and WTM and age comparisons. Time was considered as within subjects factor and Group as between subjects factor. For nesting behavior analyses, non-parametric Mann-Whitney\nU\nwas used. Significance was set at a\np\n-value of 0.05. For correlation analyses, we used the Pearson correlation coefficient. One Ts65Dn was identified as outlier in Nest-building and Spontaneous alternation tests at 11 months of age (yielding N = 13). One Ts65Dn was identified as outlier in reversal and double reversal for WTM at 2 months of age (yielding N = 14). One Ts65Dn was identified as outlier in hidden and hidden reversal for MWM at 2 months of age (yielding N = 14) but not for the probe trial (N = 15). Additionally, two Ts65Dn mice were identified as outliers and discarded for some correlation analyses. We identified outliers as individuals scoring greater than 2 times the standard deviation (SDTV) away the mean. We calculated the percentage of confidence interval for each correlation and we also estimated the slopes in a linear regression."

    "Methods": "Spinal cord transections and drug application\nLate stage larval lampreys (\nPetromyzon marinus\n, 10\u201313 cm) were anesthetized in 0.1 g/L MS-222 (Tricaine-S; Western Chemical, Inc.; Ferndale, WA). Next, the spinal cord was transected at the 5\nth\ngill, as previously described (\nBusch and Morgan, 2012\n). CLR01 (2.4 \u00b5g\n=\n1 mM) or buffer (lamprey internal solution: 180 mM KC1, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) was added at the time and site of spinal injury via a small piece of Gelfoam (Pfizer; New York, NY). 3\u2019-Lissamine labeled morpholinos (10 \u00b5g; GeneTools, LLC; Philomath, OR) were applied similarly. These included a translation-blocking synuclein morpholino (Syn MO) (5\u2019 CGCGTC\nCAT\nTCCTCTTTCTTTGTCT3\u2019) generated against the start site of lamprey \u03b3-synuclein (GenBank Accession\nJN544525.1\n) and a five base pair mismatch synuclein morpholino (MM MO) that was used as the negative control (5\u2019CGCcTg\nCAT\nTgCTCTTTgTTTcTCT3\u2019). Afterwards, lampreys were allowed to recover at room temperature (RT) for 11 weeks. Lampreys were then re-anesthetized, and the brains and spinal cords were dissected out for further experimentation by a researcher blinded to the experimental conditions. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at The University of Texas at Austin and the Marine Biological Laboratory in accordance with standards set by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nImmunofluoresence and image analysis\nBrains and spinal cords were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4. Immunofluoresence staining on whole mounted brains and cryosectioned spinal cords was done as previously described (\nJin et al., 2009\n;\nBusch and Morgan, 2012\n). Briefly, the brains were labeled in whole mount with primary and secondary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight, each followed by 5 \u00d7 1 hour washes. Spinal cord sections were labeled with primary and secondary antibodies at RT for 1\u20132 hours, each followed by 3 \u00d7 15 min washes. Primary antibodies used in this study included a rabbit polyclonal pan-synuclein antibody (1:100; Abeam ab6176; Cambridge, MA), a mouse monoclonal synaptotagmin 1 antibody (1:100; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; DSHB mAb 48; Iowa City, IA), and a mouse monoclonal neurofilament-180 antibody (1:100; LCM16; kind gift from Dr. Michael Selzer), which have all been previously characterized in lamprey nervous tissues (\nJin et al., 2009\n;\nBusch and Morgan, 2012\n;\nLau et al., 2013\n). mAb 48 (asv 48) was deposited to the DSHB by L. Reichardt. For the pre-absorption experiment shown in\nFigure 2D\n, the pan-synuclein antibody was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 100 ng/ml recombinant GST-tagged lamprey \u03b3-synuclein before being applied to lamprey brains, and this resulted in a loss of the immunofluorescence signal. Secondary antibodies used in all experiments were AlexaFluor\u00ae 488-conjugated or AlexaFluor\u00ae 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgGs (1:300; Life Technologies; Grand Island, NY). Nuclei were stained with ProLong\u00ae Gold containing DAPI.\nFigure 2. Synuclein selectively accumulates in the \u201cpoor survivors\u201d after spinal cord injury.\nOpen in a new tab\nA\n.

Bars represent mean \u00b1 S.E.M. from n = 77\u2013114 neurons, 7 brains (T-test;\nn.s.\n= not significant;\np > 0.05\n).\nAfter immunostaining, the synuclein and synaptotagmin immunofluorescence in the cell bodies of giant RS neurons were imaged using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal on an Axioskop 2FS upright microscope (10\u00d7, 0.3 NA Zeiss EC Plan-Neofluar objective or 40\u00d7, 0.8 NA Zeiss Achroplan water-dipping objective). Z-stacks were acquired, from which 3D projections were generated. For quantification of immunofluorescence, images were acquired under identical conditions for control and spinal-transected animals. Fluorescence intensity associated with each giant RS neuron was measured in ImageJ, followed by background subtraction using a measurement taken from the adjacent neuropil. Data from each cell type were collected and averaged from 6\u201313 lamprey brains.\nNF-180 immunofluorescence and DAPI staining were imaged in spinal cord cryosections using an EVOS\u00ae FL Cell Imaging System (10\u00d7, 0.3 NA and 20\u00d7, 0.5 NA Plan-Fluorite objectives). Sections proximal, within, and distal to the lesion were sampled. For the axon analysis, all NF-180-labeled axons in the ventral half of the spinal cord were counted and averaged from 4\u20138 animals per condition.\n\nNissl staining and image analysis\nAfter completing the immunofluorescence analysis, lamprey brains were Nissl-stained, as previously described (\nBusch and Morgan, 2012\n). Low-magnification images of lamprey brains were acquired either with a DFC420C camera connected to a Leica MZ10F stereoscope or an AxioCam MRc camera connected to a Zeiss SteREO Discovery V20. High-magnification images of individual M, I, and B cell regions were acquired either with a Leica DMI 4000B microscope (HC PL Fluotar 10\u00d7/0.3 NA objective) or a SteREO Discovery V20 (PlanApo S 2.3\u00d7 FWD 10mm, 70\u00d7 magnification). The mean intensity of the Nissl stain associated with each giant RS neuron was measured in ImageJ, followed by background subtraction using a measurement taken from the adjacent neuropil. Neurons that exhibited mean intensities greater than 0 were categorized as \u201cNissl (+)\u201d, and vice versa. All statistics and graphs were generated using Origin Pro 7.0.\n\nGeneration of recombinant lamprey \u03b3-synuclein and aggregation analysis\nin vitro\nGST-tagged lamprey \u03b3-synuclein was purified from BL21 cells using a standard protocol. Then, the GST was cleaved off during a 16-hour incubation at RT using thrombin (10 U/mg protein; GE Healthcare; Boston, MA). Untagged \u03b3-synuclein was then separated from GST and thrombin using Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads and p-aminobenzamidine agarose (100 \u00b5l/50 U thrombin; A7155; Sigma; St. Louis, MO), respectively, and dialyzed into 0.1M PBS, pH 7.4. Aggregation of the purified lamprey \u03b3-synuclein was analyzed using a thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay and confirmed by electron microscopy, as described previously (\nRoychaudhuri et al., 2014\n), except that 100 \u00b5M lamprey \u03b3-synuclein was used with varying CLR01 concentrations."

    "Methods": "Animals\nIn these experiments, three different transgenic mouse strains of either gender were used, each on a congenic C57BL6/J background to avoid genetic modifier effects of background strain on disease expression (\nHeiman-Patterson et al., 2011\n). Most work was conducted using mice which overexpress a transgene that carries the G93A mutation of human SOD1 protein (\nGurney et al., 1994\n). Hereafter, these mice (B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1-G93A)1Gur/J) are referred to as B6.SOD1 mice. In some experiments, mice were used that express the human transgene for the G85R SOD1 mutation (B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1*G85R)148Dwc/J, hereafter SOD1\nG85R\n). For controls, we used either C57BL6/J (hereafter WT) or transgenic mice that overexpress the wild-type human SOD1 protein (B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1)2Gur/J, hereafter SOD1\nWT\n(\nGurney et al., 1994\n). All mice were bred at Emory University or acquired from The Jackson Laboratory (\nwww.jax.org\n, Bar Harbor, ME). All experiments were carried out in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Emory University.\n\nSurgery\nSurgeries were performed under general anesthesia (ketamine 95 mg/kg, xylazine 5 mg/kg). Denervation of hindlimb muscles was accomplished by crush of the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve was exposed and crushed at a point located 2 mm rostral to the emergence of the common peroneal nerve. Sciatic crush was accomplished using a fine watchmaker\u2019s forceps with pressure applied for 10 sec. This caused the nerve to appear translucent at the crush site. Afterwards, fasciae and skin incisions were closed using 6-0 monofilament suture. No additional steps were taken to inhibit reinnervation. The animals were then returned to their cages for recovery. Food and water were administered ad lib following recovery and animals were allowed to move freely in their cages. Sciatic crush denervation was performed in B6.SOD1 and WT mice at P30 and at P60. Denervation was also performed in SOD1\nWT\nmice aged P60, and in SOD1\nG85R\nmice but at a later age as described in Results. At 10 and/or 14 days after denervation, reinnervation was studied in B6.SOD1, WT, SOD1\nWT\nand at 10 days in SOD1\nG85R\nmice.\n\nImmunolabeling\nUnder general anesthesia, the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and soleus muscles from sciatic crush and un-crushed, contralateral control sides were recovered after delays ranging from 16 hrs to 14 days and prepared for immunolabeling. Muscles were placed into 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hr. Muscles were washed in a 0.1 M phosphate buffered solution (PBS) and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight in PBS containing 20% sucrose for cryoprotection. Sections (50 \u03bcm thickness) were obtained using a Cyrostat (Leica). Motor endplate acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) were labeled with either Alexa 488 or Alexa 649 conjugated \u03b1-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes). Axons were labeled with a mouse monoclonal antibody against the phosphorylated heavy fragment of neurofilament protein (SMI31, 1:400, Sternberger Monoclonal). Motor terminal were labeled for synaptic vesicles (SV2, 1:20, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). This labeling was visualized using AMCA-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Schwann cells (SCs) were labeled with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the Ca\n2+\n-binding protein S100B (S100, 1:100, Dako) and visualized using a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). In addition to S100 labeling, SCs in some sections were also labeled with a goat polyclonal antibody against the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor p75 (NGFR p75, 1:50, Santa Cruz SC-6188) and visualized using a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Some sections taken from muscles 16, 24 and 48 hours after denervation were labeled for calpain-mediated amino terminal fodrin fragment (FBDP, 1:150, (\nBahr et al., 1995\n)) as a marker for SC necrosis (\nHill et al., 2007\n) or for activated caspase-3 (BD Pharmigen, 1:100) as a marker for apoptosis (\nDelaney et al., 1999\n;\nHill et al., 2007\n). Positive labeling for activated caspase-3 has been shown to appear in SCs under conditions that also produce positive TUNEL labeling (\nParkinson et al., 2001\n). Antibody labeling for caspase-3 was visualized using a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). SCs in these sections were also labeled with a mouse monoclonal antibody against S100B (Anti S100, 1:100, Millipore) and visualized with a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody(1:100, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Where noted, DAPI staining was used to identify SC or TSC cell body nuclei. This staining was performed as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions using slide mounting media (Vectashield) which included DAPI. Macrophages were labeled with a rat monoclonal against the 160KD glycoprotein F4/80 (F4/80, 1:20, AbD Serotec MCA497) and visualized using a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories).\n\nElectron Microscopy\nA number of NMJs were examined using an electron microscope 7d following sciatic crush denervation of a P45 B6.SOD1 animal. Following tissue recovery, an MG muscle was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) overnight before washing 2x with the same buffer. NMJs were then labeled with rhodamine-conjugated bungarotoxin and then visualized under a fluorescence microscope. Areas of NMJ clusters were dissected out and placed in Eppendorf tubes to continue fixation in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) overnight at 4C. Muscle specimens were then washed and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide with 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide in the same buffer for one hour. Muscle specimens were subsequently rinsed 2x with de-ionized water and dehydrated through an ethanol series ending with three exchanges of 100% absolute ethanol. Specimens were then infiltrated with a mixture of propylene oxide and Eponate 12 resin (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA) followed by 100% Eponate 12 resin. Finally, tissue was embedded in Beem capsules and placed in a 60 \u00b0C oven for 2 days. Following resin polymerization, hardened resin blocks were thin-sectioned at 70 nm. Sections were then picked up with 200 mesh copper grids, stained with 5% aqueous uranyl acetate and 2% lead citrate, and viewed on a JEOL JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Gatan BioScan CCD camera (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA)\n\nImaging\nZ-axis stacks of images of immunolabeled NMJs were obtained at sequential focal planes (1.0 \u03bcm separation) using an upright microscope equipped with a motorized stage (Leica). Stacks were deconvolved using a commercially available inverse filter algorithm (ImagePro). In some cases, stacks of confocal images were obtained. Muscles from the contralateral (uncrushed sciatic) side provided additional control data.\n\nAnalysis\nImages of NMJs were analyzed at high magnification (100x) to determine the extent to which presynaptic SMI+SV2 labeling overlaid postsynaptic labeling for AChRs in superimposed images. SMI+SV2 labeling was used to assign the following categories of endplate innervation; endplates that exhibited a complete absence of SMI+SV2 labeling were considered to be denervated; endplates that showed SMI+SV2 labeling present in all ACHR-rich endplate arms or branches were considered to be innervated; endplates that showed SMI+SV2 labeling present in some but not all ACHR-rich arms or branches were considered to be partially innervated. For analysis, randomly selected fields of NMJs were first located at low magnification. Then, at high magnification all the NMJs in each field were categorized as described above. The extent of endplate S100 coverage was also assessed at 100x magnification and assigned into 3 categories (full, partial, absent). Additional analyses to assess colabeling for P75, S100 and DAPI labeling at 100x magnification were performed as described in Results. Unless noted otherwise, all NMJ measurements were sampled from 80 NMJs per muscle, and only one MG-soleus pair from the same side was sampled per animal.\nTSC cell bodies were identified by S100 and DAPI nuclear colabeling (\nLove and Thompson, 1998\n). Multiple DAPI-labeled nuclei are located in the vicinity of the NMJ (see\nFig 1\n). To identify TSC cell bodies, multiple focal planes were viewed using a 100x, oil-immersion objective with a variable aperture used to minimize depth of focus. At each focal plane, fluorescence filters were manually switched while viewing images on a video monitor to ensure that S100 and DAPI labeling were located in identical focal planes. In most cases, these steps were sufficient to either identify TSC cell bodies or to exclude their presence. In more difficult cases, full image stacks of DAPI and S100 labeling were taken to enable finer scrutiny of labeling placement.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nLoss of S100 labeling at B6.SOD1 NMJs following sciatic crush denervation at P30. A. Field of NMJs from a B6.SOD1 MG muscle 4d after denervation labeled for S100 (green) and acetylcholine receptors (ACHRs, red). Panel demonstrates the absence of S100 labeling over ACHR-labeled endplates and in the immediate preterminal regions whereas S100 labeling of SCs can still be found in more proximal trunks (yellow arrows). B, C. NMJs were viewed at high magnification (100x) and classified into 3 categories based on the extent that each NMJ was covered by S100 labeling. Bar charts show average percentages for categories of NMJ S100 coverage (F, full; P, partial; A, absent) 4d after denervation for P30 B6.SOD1 MG (B, N = 4) and soleus (C, N = 4). Control B6.SOD1 MG and soleus NMJs are fully covered by S100 labeling. After denervation, full S100 coverage disappears and a significant percentage of NMJs show an absence of S100 coverage. Post-denervation changes of S100 coverage distributions were statistically significant (Pearson chi-square, p < 0.01). D. Panel shows S100 labeling in an NMJ field from a P30 WT MG muscle 4d after denervation. S100 labeling persisted in preterminal regions and over most NMJs demonstrating continued presence of TSCs and SCs following denervation. E, F. Bar charts show average percentages for categories of NMJ S100 coverage 4d after sciatic crush denervation for P30 WT MG (E, N = 4) and soleus (F, N = 4). For each muscle, some S100 labeling was lost after denervation and the post-denervation changes in the soleus muscle were statistically significant. Unlike B6.SOD1 NMJs, however, only a small fraction of WT soleus NMJs showed an absence of S100 labeling while most WT MG NMJs retained full S100 coverage after denervation.\n\nStatistics\nTwo-way contingency tables were used to determine effects of genotype (B6.SOD1 v WT), age or treatment on frequency distributions of categorical variable means describing innervation status (SMI-SV2 labeling), NMJ S100 and P75 labeling coverage, and S100-P75 colabeling status. For comparing average values, nested analysis of variance was used. Tukey\u2019s honestly significant difference post-hoc test was used to test the significance of differences between WT, contralateral control and B6.SOD1 average values. All analysis was performed using commercially available software (Systat Inc). Mean values are presented \u00b1 1 SEM."

    "Methods": "2.1. Cell culture\nB104 cells, a rat hippocampal neuroblastoma line, were cultured as previously described (\nSpaeth et al., 2010\n,\n2012a\n,\n2012b\n,\n2012c\n;\nZuzek et al., 2013\n). Unlike PC-12 cells or other commonly used neuronal cell lines, B104 cells do not require the addition of nerve growth factor or other supplements to differentiate. B104 neurites are bipolar and have many properties typical of axons such as action potentials, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and neurotransmitter release. After 24 h of differentiation, axons of B104 cells can vary from a few \u03bcm to over 500 \u03bcm in length, with most ranging from 20 \u03bcm to 150 \u03bcm long. B104 cells have often been used as an in vitro model system to study neuronal function (\nBottenstein and Sato, 1979\n;\nToda et al., 1999\n;\nYoo et al., 2003\n,\n2004\n;\nNguyen et al., 2005\n;\nMiller et al., 2006\n).\nB104 cells were grown in 75 cm\n2\nvented cap, tissue culture flasks containing 1:1 Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium and Ham\u2019s F12 supplement with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator that was maintained at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\n. This growth medium was replaced every two days until the flask reached 80% confluency. Cells were then either subcultured into a new flask or seeded at a density of 5000 to 15,000 cells/cm\n2\non poly D-lysine coated (5 \u03bcg/ml) cell culture plates (60 \u00d7 15 mm, Falcon). The next day, plated cells were differentiated in serum-free 1:1 Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium and Ham\u2019s F12 supplement for 24 h. Stock populations of B104 cells were subcultured at most 35 times to mitigate the effects of senescence.\n\n2.2. Axon transection and microscopy\nGlass knives were created by pulling 1 mm diameter microcapillary tubes with a micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument CO, USA), and breaking the pipettes at their tips. The glass knives were mounted on a micromanipulator (Narishige Instruments) attached to a Zeiss ICM-405 phase contrast microscope. Cell culture plates containing 100,000 to 300,000 differentiated B104 cells were gently rinsed twice and filled with Ca\n2+\nand Mg\n2+\nfree Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS\u2212/\u2212, Hyclone). To transect B104 axons, a cell culture plate was placed on the microscope stage and the glass knife was lowered onto the surface of the plate using the micromanipulator. The microscope stage was moved parallel to the knife\u2019s edge to transect some B104 axons, etching a visible \u201ctransection line\u201d on the surface of the plate. Axons of 500\u2013800 cells were transected on each plate within 10 min after adding the DPBS\u2212/\u2212. Note that most cells on a plate were\nnot\ntransected.\nAfter transection, DPBS\u2212/\u2212 medium was replaced with DPBS medium containing Ca\n2+\nand Mg\n2+\n(DPBS+/+) to initiate the sealing process, as previously reported [The addition of Ca\n2+\nto the extracellular medium initiates plasmalemmal sealing in all eukaryotic cells (\nKrause et al., 1994\n;\nBlanchette et al., 1999\n;\nDetrait et al., 2000a\n,\n2000b\n;\nYoo et al., 2003\n;\nSpaeth et al., 2010\n)]. Cell culture plates containing transected B104 axons were returned to the CO\n2\nincubator and allowed to sit for either 2.5, 3.75, 5, 10, 15, or 20 min post DPBS +/+ addition, i.e., for 2.5\u201320 min post Ca\n2+\naddition times (PC times:\nSpaeth et al., 2010\n). At each given PC time, the dye-free DPBS+/+ medium was replaced with DPBS+/+ medium containing 9 nM Dextran conjugated Texas Red (3 kDa, Molecular Probes, D3328). After 15 min, the DPBS+/+ containing Texas Red Dextran was washed out with dye-free DPBS+/+.\nB104 cells were observed with a Zeiss Axio Vert.A1 microscope fitted with phase contrast and fluorescent optics, an excitation/emission filter of 595/615, a Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera and an eyepiece reticle (Klarmann Rulings, KR-407). Representative images of transected cells were acquired and their brightness and contrast were adjusted using Adobe Photoshop to enhance visibility. Images of the eyepiece reticle were also acquired using an iPhone 6S camera.\nIndividually-identified cells with axons that intersected a transection line or stopped near the transection line and aligned with an anuclear, distal axonal segment on the opposite side of the transection line were counted as transected. Cells transected more than once were not counted. The fluorescent state, a Yes/No value, of each uniquely-identified transected cell was recorded. The distance between the transection site and the axon hillock for each cell was recorded using the eyepiece reticle in 2.5 \u03bcm increments. We measured transection distance from the axon hillock because the rough endoplasmic reticulum in axons does not extend beyond this point, and other landmarks (e.g. nucleus) had varied locations in different cells. Curved axons or axons that extended outside the microscope field of view were measured in sequential segments, using membrane irregularities and cellular debris as markers. Typically, 60\u2013120 cells could be counted on each plate in 30\u201340 min before photo-bleaching began to affect dye detection.\n\n2.3. Analyses of sealing frequency versus transection distance\nTo determine sealing frequencies at any given PC time, cells were grouped by transection distance into different bins using various \u201cbinary\u201d or \u201cmultinary\u201d methods, and the frequency of cells that excluded Texas Red in each bin was calculated. For the binary groups, B104 cells were grouped into \u201ctransected b50 \u03bcm or \u226550 \u03bcm from the axon hillock. For the multinary groups, various methods (see\nResults\n) were used to generate a set of bin widths starting at \u22650 \u03bcm from the axon hillock. An outlier test was applied to both multinary and to binary data sets: Any cell culture plate with transected cells exhibiting a sealing frequency more than three standard deviations from the weighted mean for that given transection range and counting method was excluded from analysis. In total, 4 of 120 plates were excluded.\n\n2.4. Statistical analyses\nThe relationship between transection distance (x axis) and sealing frequency (y axis) was characterized at each PC time by fitting a one-phase exponential model described by the equation Y = Y\n0\n+ Y\nmax\n* e\n\u2212x/\u03bb\n, where Y\n0\nis the Y-intercept, Y\nmax\nis the maximum sealing frequency for that PC curve, x is transection distance, and \u03bb is the space constant (the distance required for the predicted sealing frequency to reach 63% of the plateau). Linear regressions were applied to the same data set as an alternative hypothesis. The F-test for regression and Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion (AIC) were used to compare the goodness of fit of different curves for exponential and linear models.\nThe effects of PC time on sealing frequency were identified by comparing data at each PC time in a pairwise fashion using two-tailed Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel Chi-Squared (CMH X\n2\n) tests for independence. These tests integrate multiple 2 \u00d7 2 X\n2\nanalyses that differ by a nominal replicate variable to calculate a significant difference between sealing frequencies. The independent and dependent variables used in the 2 \u00d7 2 comparisons were PC time and dye uptake; the replicate variable differentiating the comparisons were transection distance bins. The relationship between PC time and sealing frequency was investigated by fitting one-phase exponential and linear regression models to the sealing frequencies of cells in each 12-width optimized transection distance bins at different PC times. In the one-phase exponential model, \u03c4 is the time required for the predicted sealing frequency to reach 63% of the plateau. The F-test for regression was used to compare the goodness of fit of different curves for exponential and linear models.\nTo compare multinary data to previously reported binary data (\nSpaeth et al., 2010\n;\nZuzek et al., 2013\n), measurements collected using the multinary method in the present study were transformed to mimic the way data were collected using the binary method. The binary sealing frequency of cells transected <50 \u03bcm and \u226550 \u03bcm from their hillocks were calculated from the multinary data and used for comparison against the sealing frequency of <50 \u03bcm and \u226550 \u03bcm binary transection data as previously reported. One-phase exponential models were fit to plots of PC time vs sealing frequency plots created by this multinary to binary transformation. CMH X\n2\ntests were used to compare the curves, using PC time as the replicate variable, and individual data points were compared with Fisher\u2019s exact test."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals and Treatment\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (N=64; Harlan-Teklad Corp., IN), weighing between 300\u2013350 g (9\u201311 wks of age at the start of the experiment) served as subjects. Rats were pair-housed, placed in a temperature-controlled vivarium (20\u201322\u00b0 C), and maintained on a 12-hr light/dark cycle with light onset at 07:00 hr. Procedures were in full accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Binghamton University and the National Institute of Health: Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (2011).\nInitially, rats were randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: (1) pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency (PTD; n=32) or (2) pair-fed controls (PF; n=32).\nFigure 1\ndisplays the experimental timeline and design. Rats in the PTD condition received daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) pyrithiamine HBr injections (0.25 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) in conjunction with\nad libitum\naccess to thiamine-deficient rat chow (Harlan-Teklad Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN). For the PF control condition, in order to replicate both dietary changes and injection procedures, rats were given a thiamine deficient chow equivalent to the amount consumed by animals in the PTD condition and were administered daily i.p. (0.4 mg/kg) injections of thiamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich Corp) to replace thiamine. Treatment continued for a period of 12\u201315 days until the onset of the prototypical neurological symptoms of thiamine deficiency (ataxia, loss of righting reflexes and ultimately tonic-clonic seizure activity). Subsequently, rats were closely monitored for seizure-like activity, and a thiamine bolus (100 mg/kg) was administered 4.5-hrs following onset of opisthotonus. The same dosage of thiamine was delivered 24-hrs later. Following treatment, PTD and PF rodents were placed back onto a normal diet consisting of Purina rat chow for a seven-day recovery period prior to surgery. During this time frame, rats recovered from the weight lost related to treatment.\nFigure 1. Experimental design.\nOpen in a new tab\nFirst, all subjects were randomly assigned to either PTD (n=32) or PF (n=32) treatment. Following recovery, all rats had a cannula placed in the ventral hippocampus for later\nin vivo\nmicrodialysis. After surgery, rats were pair-housed and allowed to recover and were then transferred to cages that had either an active running wheel (voluntary exercise [VEx]) or an inactive running wheel (Stationary Controls [Stat]) attached to the home cage for a 2-wk duration. Rats were subsequently tested either 24-hrs or 2-wks later on spontaneous alternation (SA) combined with\nin vivo\nmicrodialysis followed by a novel object recognition (NOR) test. Cellular morphological assessment from the MS/DB was performed in all subjects. In a different cohort of animals, BDNF and NGF levels were obtained 24-hrs or 2-wks after the cessation of VEx and Stat conditions.\n\n2.2. Cannulation Implantation Surgery\nHippocampal cannulations were performed on all rats 7 days after PTD/PF treatment. Prior to surgery, administration of a ketamine cocktail (10 mL)/xylazine (1.43 mL) mixture at a dosage of 50 mg/kg (i.p.) was administered. Rodents were placed into a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) and the incisor bar set to 3.00 mm below the interaural line. Guide cannula (8 mm; Synaptech Technology Inc., Marquette, MI) were placed into the following ventral hippocampal coordinates [(AP) = \u22125.3 mm posterior to Bregma, (ML) = \u22125.1 mm lateral to the midline, (DV) = \u22124.2 mm] relative to Bregma (\nPaxinos and Watson, 2014\n). Dental acrylic cement with anchor bone screws secured guide cannula to the skull. Administration of 0.3 cc of 0.05 mg/mL buprenorphine (buprenorphine hydrochloride, Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, IL) was administered pre- and post-operatively as an analgesic. Rodents were given a 7-day recovery period with\nad libitum\naccess to food prior to exercise exposure to ensure sufficient recuperatation.\n\n2.3. Exercise Paradigm\nFollowing recovery from treatment (14 days post treatment, 7-days post surgery), PTD-treated and PF-treated rats were randomly assigned into one of two conditions: (a) a voluntary exercise condition (VEx; PTD=16, PF=16) or (b) a stationary condition (Stat; PTD=16, PF=16). The exercise wheel (35.56 cm diameter; turning resistance < 6 gms) was attached to a clear polycarbonate home cage (Lafayette Instruments, Lafayette, IN, 48.3 \u00d7 26.7 \u00d7 20.3 cm) for each pair of rats. To control for the environmental context, rats in the Stat condition had immobilized wheels attached to their cages. In the VEx condition wheels had a counter to measure daily wheel revolutions via a Dell Laptop equipped with AWM software (Lafayette Instruments). Throughout the duration of this procedure, all rats were slightly food restricted to 95% of free-feeding weight, to increase running distance (see\nSherwin, 1998\n;\nLee et al., 2002\n).\n\n2.4 Behavioral testing\n2.4.1. Spontaneous alternation with concurrent\nin vivo\nmicrodialysis\nRats were behaviorally tested either 24-hrs or 2-wks following respective Stat/VEx conditions in order to determine the unique temporal profile of cholinergic recovery. Microdialysis procedure parameters were followed as previously described (see\nSavage et al., 2003\n). On the day of testing, the microdialysis probe (S-8020; 2 mm; Synaptech Inc.) was inserted into the hippocampal guide cannula, and the rat was placed into the opaque chamber (30 cm \u00d7 40 cm \u00d7 35 cm) to acclimate for a period of 60-min prior to maze testing. The probe was connected to a CMA microinfusion pump (CMA/400 pump; Holliston, MA) and artificial cerebrospinal fluid (7.4 pH solution: 127.6 mM NaCl, 0.9 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 4 mM KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl\n2\ndihydrate, 1.0 mM glucose, and 0.9 mM MgCl\n2\n) with 500 nM neostigmine hydrobromide (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) solution was perfused continuously at a rate of 2.0 \u00b5L/min.\nBaseline dialysate collection began after a 60-min habituation period, and samples were collected at 6-min intervals. Three samples were collected prior to maze testing in order to determine basal levels of ACh. During spontaneous alternation testing, the rat was placed into the center of the plus maze that was elevated 80 cm from the floor. The arms of the plus maze were 55 cm equidistant lengths with 12 cm clear acrylic sidewalls. The behavioral testing room had numerous extra-maze cues on the walls, in addition to cues located closer to the maze. The rat was allowed to freely transverse all arms for a period of 18-min and during this time microdialysis collection continued. All activity was recorded regarding sequence and number of arms entered. Whereas an arm entry was defined as all four paws of a rat being placed within an arm, an alternation was defined as entry into four different arms in overlapping successive sequences of 4 arm entries. (Example: The successive arm entries of A, D, C, B, D, A, C, D, B, D, A, C, D, A, C; the first sequence of ADCB was an alternation, but the following sequence of 4 arm entries DCBD was not.) The percent alternation score is equal to the ratio of (actual alternations/possible alternations [trial number-3]) and multiplied by 100. (For the above hypothetical data set: 5/(15\u22123) = .416 \u00d7 100 =41.6%.) This criterion was based upon previous experiments (\nAnzalone et al, 2010\n;\nHall et al, 2014\n; Hughes, 2004; Ragozzino et al, 2012). Following maze testing, the rat was placed back into the opaque chamber with continued dialysate collection for 18-min (post-baseline).\n2.4.2. Novel Object Recognition\nParameters for Novel Object Recognition (NOR) were adapted from\nBevins and Besheer (2006)\n. An opaque acrylic box served as the arena (41 cm \u00d7 41 cm \u00d7 30.5 cm). Briefly, on the same day following microdialysis testing, rats were habituated to the arena for a period of 20-min. A tripod with a camcorder (JVC, GZ-MG27U) recorded all activity as well as object interaction on the training and testing sessions. Following this initial habituation to the arena, rats were placed back into respective home cages overnight.\nThe next day, two identical objects were placed into the left and right corners (6 cm from walls) of the apparatus equidistant from the walls and each other. Two types of objects were used for NOR training and testing: (1) a Duplo Lego\u00ae object created by combining four rectangular Lego\u00ae blocks (7.2 \u00d7 10 cm) with a center hole, and (2) a 10.16 cm square wooden block containing 4 equidistant drilled holes (1 cm diameter). Importantly, we initially ran a pilot study on a separate cohort of animals, which revealed that rats displayed no initial preference for either of these objects when presented together (determined by interaction time; p>0.10). The training/testing object was counterbalanced across Treatment and Exercise conditions. In the training phase, each rat was placed facing the midpoint of the wall opposite to the two identical sample objects and was allowed to explore the objects and arena for 10-min.\nThe testing delay for NOR was 24-hrs following the training phase. The apparatus was set up similar to the training phase, except one object was the previously utilized familiar object, while the other object was novel. Behavior was recorded during the testing phase for 5-min. The time (s) spent at the novel and familiar objects were determined by an individual blind to Treatment, Exercise condition and novelty of the object. Data were expressed as percent of time spent at the novel object. Importantly, only time spent actively sniffing or investigating the object was considered exploratory behavior.\n\n2.5. High Performance Liquid Chromotography\nDialysate samples were assayed for ACh using HPLC with electrochemical detection (Eicom USA, San Diego, CA). ACh peaks were quantified by comparison to peak heights of standard solutions and corrected for in vitro recovery of the probe. The system detection limit is reliably 5 femtomole of ACh. Chromatographs obtained every 15 min/sample were analyzed using the software program Envision (provided by Eicom, USA).\n\n2.6. Tissue Preparation and Immunohistochemistry\nThe day following the completion of behavioral testing all rats were deeply anesthetized (Sleep-Away, Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) and then transcardially perfused with ice-cold (4\u00b0C) phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by ice-cold (4\u00b0C) filtered 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Services, Hatfield, PA). Whole brains were extracted, kept in paraformaldehyde (4%) for 24-hr, post-fixed in a 30% sucrose solution made in 0.1M PBS and coronally sliced at 40 \u00b5m on a freezing sliding microtome (Sm2000r; Leica Instruments, Wetzler, Germany). Tissue sections were sequentially collected individually in a 96 well plate containing a cryoprotectant solution (62.8 mg NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.18 g Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 160 mL dH\n2\nO, 120 mL ethylene glycol and 120 mL glycerol; pH: 7.4) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until immunohistochemistry. All tissues were run in cohorts that include subjects from all treatment conditions to control for specimen preparation procedures.\n2.6.1. Immunocytochemistry\u2014ChAT/DAB\nFor ChAT immunohistochemistry, a total of six sections per subject were used. Sections were first washed in 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB). This was followed by a 30-min incubation in 0.3% H\n2\nO\n2\nin 0.1M PB. Next, sections were placed into a blocking solution consisting of 3% normal rabbit serum, 0.1% Triton-X 100 and 5% sodium azide in 0.1 M PB for a 60-min incubation. Primary antibody (1:100 dilution goat monoclonal anti-ChAT; AB144P; Millipore EMD, Billerica, MA) incubation occurred at 4\u00b0C overnight. Subsequently, following a brief 15-min wash in 0.1 M PB, sections were placed in a secondary antibody solution (1:100 anti-goat IgG, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in the blocking buffer for 2-hrs. Next, sections were incubated in an avidin/biotin complex (Elite VECTASTAIN ABC system, Vector Laboratories) for a period of 2-hrs in 0.1 M PB. Lastly, sections were placed in a chromogenic agent containing 0.005% 3,3\u2019 diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.). Tissue was subsequently mounted, dried and coverslipped with the mounting agent Permount\u00ae (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).\n2.6.2. ChAT+/nestin+ immunofluorescence double labeling\nThree sections per subject were chosen order to determine rates of ChAT+/ nestin\u2212, ChAT+/nestin+ and ChAT\u2212/nestin+ expression within the MS/DB. Free-floating sections were washed using a standard 0.1 M Tris-buffered saline (TBS) solution (pH: 7.4). Next, sections were permeabilized using a 0.2% Triton-X 100 solution in 0.1 M TBS for 15-min, followed by an incubation in blocking solution consisting of 5% normal donkey serum and 0.1% Triton-X 100 in a 0.1 M TBS solution. Similarly, tissue was incubated into a cocktail of the ChAT (AP144P; Millipore EMD) and nestin (MAB353; Millipore EMD) primary antibodies (1:200 dilution) made in blocking solution for 48-hrs at 4\u00b0C. Tissue was briefly washed in 0.1 M TBS (15 min) and incubated into a fluorescent-tagged secondary antibody cocktail containing blocking solution with a 1:250 dilution of Cy2 AffiniPure anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) and Cy3 AffiniPure anti-mouse for 2-hrs. Finally, after a brief rinse in 0.1 M TBS, sections were mounted, coverslipped with Prolong Diamond Antifade agent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until phenotypic investigation.\n\n2.7. Unbiased Stereological Cellular Quantification of ChAT+ Neurons\nUnbiased stereology was employed to estimate the total ChAT+ cell populations in the MS/DB. The parameters employed were based on previously published studies (Li et al., 2008;\nRoland and Savage, 2009\n;\nSavage et al., 2007\n;\nYoder and Pang, 2005\n). An experimenter blind to both the Treatment, Exercise and Time point conditions performed cell counts. A Zeiss Microscope (Axioscope 2-Plus, Thornwood, NY) with an attached digital camera (DVC-1310; DVC Company, Austin, TX) containing a motorized stage in the x, y and z planes was used in conjunction with StereoInvestigator software (MicroBrightField Bioscience, Williston, VT) on a computer containing a Windows XP operating system. Using 5X magnification, contours were drawn around the specific regions of interest (ROIs) that included the MS and horizontal and vertical limbs of the DB. For neuronal counting, sufficient staining within the soma was necessary, and counting was performed using the optical fractionator function within the software using a 40\u00d7 dry-objective lens. Soma size was determined using the nucleator software function with the number of rays set to 5 (\nSchmitz et al., 1999\n). The software used a fractionator sampling approach that entailed a section-sampling fraction (ssf=1/6; every 6\nth\nsection), in addition to an area-sampling fraction which represented the ratio between the counting frame and grid sizes (asf=50\u00b5m \u00d7 50\u00b5m/100\u00b5m \u00d7 100\u00b5m), and lastly, the height sampling fraction (hsf=20\u00b5m/40\u00b5m). The following equation was used for determining the regional ChAT population: N = \u03a3 \u03c3Q\n\u2212\n\u00d7 1/ssf \u00d7 1/asf \u00d7 1/hsf\u00d71/tsf, in which \u03c3Q constitutes the number of cells counted in a specimen and N represents the total cell estimate. The section thickness was calculated and included to estimate the total number of neurons in the population (thickness sampling fraction, tsf= 33 \u00b5m/section). Importantly, we ensured that the Gunderson-Jensen estimator of the error coefficient was lower than 0.10 (smoothness factor=1.0), since this is one of the critical assumptions of the optical fractionator approach for analyses.\nTable 1\nlists the stereologic parameters for cell count estimations (See\nWest, 2013\n).\nTable 1.\nStereological experimental parameters used to estimate the overall neuronal ChAT population\nOpen in a new tab\n\n2.8. Confocal Microscopy\nIn order to determine co-localization rates between ChAT+ and nestin+ immunoreactive neurons, confocal microscopy was used. This was performed using coded slides to ensure that the investigator was blind to treatment parameters. A Leica SP5 scanning confocal microscope was used for capturing z-stacks along with the Leica LAS AF software suite on a computer operating with Microsoft Windows XP. ChAT+ neurons were sampled equally across the MS/DB and across the 3 tissue sections. Cells were then assessed for co-localization with nestin using a 40\u00d7/1.3 oil immersion lens. Single optical sections (Z-stacks [1 \u00b5m resolution]; 1-airy unit) were collected throughout the section using lasers with excitation and emission wavelengths of 478 nm/510 nm (Cy2, green) and 550 nm/570 nm (Cy3, red). Co-localization rate percentages for each subject were determined by the following equation: ([total number of ChAT+/nestin+ co-localized neurons/total number of ChAT+ cells] \u00d7 100%).\nA z-stack of the entire MS/DB ROI was taken with a 5X/dry lens for each subject throughout the MS/DB. From these sections, the number of cells per mm\n2\nwas calculated using the NIH software package Image J. Briefly, an outlined ROI was selected and the total number of cells (ChAT+/nestin\u2212, ChAT+/nestin+, ChAT\u2212/nestin+) was divided by the total ROI area (mm\n2\n).\n\n2.9. Histological staining\n2.9.1. Pyronin Y staining\nPyronin Y staining, which stains RNA red, was performed to quantify thalamic loss and verify correct placement of cannula in the ventral hippocampus. Three sections per subject were choosen, from the fornix region through the dorsal hippocampus (from Bregma: AP coordinates: \u22121.80 mm to \u22123.30 mm;\nPaxinos and Watson, 2014\n), for assessment.\n2.9.2. Intraventricular Distance\nIntraventricular distance (IVD) is a measure employed to quantify thalamic loss in PTD-treated rats (see\nRobinson and Mair, 1992\n;\nVetreno et al., 2011\n). IVD (in mm) was measured as a function of the distance between the dorsal and ventral portions of the third ventricle (\u22121.80 mm to \u22123.30 mm from Bregma;\nPaxinos and Watson, 2014\n). Section images were captured using a Nikon light microscope (Nikon Eclipse E400; Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY, USA) via a Scion 1394 camera JAVA module (Scion Corp; Fredrick, MD, USA). IVDs were then measured using the NIH-based program Image-J (v.1.48, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) on a MacBook Pro computer (Apple, Cupertino, CA).\n\n2. 10. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for Neurotrophins\nELISAs were employed in order to measure protein levels for mBDNF and \u03b2-NGF within the hippocampus. Neurotrophin levels were determined on a separate cohort of rodents with identical treatment parameters and group size. In this experiment, rats were immediately sacrificed following behavioral testing. Brains were then excised and neural structures were rapidly dissected out, placed on ice, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until tissue preparation for protein quantification.\nIn order to prepare tissue lysates for use on both mBDNF and \u03b2-NGF ELISAs, flash frozen tissue was weighed and sonicated in a lysis buffer containing RIPA buffer, protease inhibitor cocktail, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail #2, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail #3 (all from Sigma-Aldrich) and PMSF at a ratio of 10 \u00b5L lysis buffer/mg tissue. Next, tissue was centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C. Subsequently, supernatant was removed and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until total protein and neurotrophin ELISAs were performed.\n2.10.1. Total Protein\nTotal protein levels were determined in order to quantify levels mBDNF and \u03b2-NGF. A Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) was used in order to estimate total protein in samples. Briefly, supplied bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein standards were diluted to form the standard curve from 0\u20132000 \u00b5g/mL. The working reagent was prepared from 50 parts of the supplied BCA reagent A to 1 part of the BCA reagent B. Using a 96-well plate, 100 \u00b5L of each standard and experimental sample was added to 2.0 mL of working reagent, mixed, plated and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30-min. Plates were read at a wavelength of 562 nm and total protein (\u00b5g/mg) were determined from the standard curve for subsequent analyses.\n2.10.2. BDNF ELISA\nThe BDNF Emax\u00ae ImmunoAssay System ELISA kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was used to quantify mBDNF protein levels. Samples and standards were added to the plate in duplicate to ensure reliability in 1X block and sample buffer at a ratio of 1:5. Serial dilutions were performed on the supplied BDNF standard to create an eight-point standard curve ranging from 0\u2013500 pg/mL in order to derive sample values. Plates (96 well) were subsequently read following the colorimetric reaction immediately on a ELISA plate reader (Dynex, Chantilly, VA) at 450 nm and optical density values were obtained.\n2.10.3. NGF ELISA\n\u03b2-NGF was measured using a rat \u03b2-NGF DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to manufacturer specifications. Briefly, 96-well plates were incubated overnight with supplied anti-rat \u03b2-NGF capture antibody. Plates were next washed and blocked with reagent diluent. Samples and standards were added to the plate in duplicate to ensure validity and reliability. Samples were diluted in reagent diluent at a ratio of 1:5. Serial dilutions were performed on standards to create an eight-point standard curve ranging from 0\u20131000 pg/mL in order to derive sample values. Plates were next incubated in detection antibody, washed and incubated in horseradish-peroxidase substrate solution. Finally, stop solution was added to each well, and using a Dynex ELISA plate reader, optical density values were obtained by reading the plate at a wavelength of 450 nm.\n\n2.11. Statistical Analyses\nThe statistical package SPSS version 22.0 for Mac OS X Yosemite (IBM, Armonk, NY) was used to analyze all data. Cumulative distance data for exercise exposure was analyzed as a mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the two-between subjects factors Treatment (PF vs. PTD) and Time Point (24-hr vs. 2-wk) across the within subjects factor of Day (14 total). For hippocampal ACh efflux data, a mixed model repeated measures ANOVA was performed that had three-between subjects factors of Treatment, Exercise (VEx vs. Stat) and Time and two-within subjects factors of Sample Time (block 1\u20133) collapsed within Phase (baseline, maze, after). For spontaneous alternation, ChAT population, ChAT/nestin somatic area, ChAT/nestin phenotyping data, \u03b2-NGF levels, mBDNF levels and thalamic pathology data, a three-factor ANOVA design was performed (Treatment, X Exercise X Time). All data are expressed as means \u00b1 S.E.M. A p\u22640.05 was denoted as the acceptable significance level for all analyses. Follow up analyses were performed for any overall significant main effects and/or interactions using Fisher\u2019s LSD. In addition, Pearson Correlations were used to assess associations between measures of neuroanatomy, ACh efflux and behavior."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experiments were performed on 7 to 12 week-old, male C57BL/J6 mice\n(The Jackson Laboratory). All animals were group housed with free access to food\nand water. All procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines\npublished in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use\nof Laboratory Animals and approved by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia\nInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Behavioral and physiological\nexperiments were performed on separate cohorts of animals.\n\nLateral Fluid Percussion Injury\nLFPI is a well-established model of mild to moderate traumatic brain\ninjury that mimics many aspects of human TBI pathology and symptomatology (\nCarbonell et al., 1998\n;\nThompson et al., 2005\n;\nXiong et al., 2013\n). Animals were randomly\nassigned into three groups; Na\u00efve animals that received no surgery or\ninjury, but were treated otherwise identically; LFPI (surgery+injury); or sham\n(surgery only). Surgery and injury were performed on consecutive days, for full\ndetails see (\nCole et al., 2010a\n;\nWitgen et al., 2005\n). Briefly, on day one\nmice were anesthetized with a combination of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine\n(10 mg/kg) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting). A 3 mm outer diameter\ntrephine was then used to perform a craniectomy of the right parietal bone\nlateral of the sagittal suture between lambda and bregma, without disrupting the\nintact dura. A Luer-loc needle hub (3 mm inner diameter) was secured to the\nskull surrounding the craniectomy with adhesive and dental cement. The needle\nhub was filled with sterile saline solution and sealed overnight. On the\nfollowing day, LFPI animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and connected to\nthe LFPI device (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth\nUniversity, Richmond, VA). The LFPI device was then triggered, delivering a\n10\u201315 ms fluid pulse (peak pressure 1.5\u20131.8 atm) onto the intact\ndura of the brain to generate a mild to moderate TBI. The needle hub was removed\nand the incision sutured. Any animals with injuries resulting in dural breach or\nherniation were excluded from the study. Sham animals underwent an identical\nprocedure without receiving the fluid pulse injury. Since no significant\ndifferences between sham and na\u00efve animals were evident, these two groups\nwere pooled for analysis and referred to as the sham group.\n\nCued Fear Conditioning\nIt is well established that acquisition and expression of a threat\nresponse, that is freezing, to a light and/or tone cue, paired with an aversive\nstimuli, is dependent upon physiological processes within the basolateral and\ncentral amygdalae (\nD\u0119biec et al.,\n2010\n;\nDuvarci and Pare, 2014\n;\nPhillips and Ledoux, 1992\n;\nTronson et al., 2012\n). Fear conditioning\nparadigms pair an emotionally neutral stimulus or context (conditioned stimulus\nor CS) with an aversive stimulus (unconditioned stimulus or US), leading to the\nexpression of a threat response to presentation of the neutral CS alone. As\nnoted, both the context and cue become predictive of the US and elicit a threat\nresponse. For these experiments the context was altered between training\n(context A) and testing (context B) to isolate the light/tone (CS) cued response\nfrom the hippocampal dependent contextual response.\nThe cued fear conditioning paradigm used in this study was modified from\nexperiments described in (\nNewton et al.,\n2004\n;\nWolff et al., 2014\n). The\nCS consisted of simultaneous auditory (75dB, white noise, 20s) and light stimuli\n(yellow light pulses, 20s, flickering at 4 Hz) generated by built in audio and\nlight stimuli generators (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT, USA). The US consisted\nof a footshock (1.05mA, 1.5s) delivered through the metal grid floor. During\nCS-US pairings, the US was delivered immediately following the cessation of the\nCS. All behavioral experiments were performed in an isolated behavioral suite\nunder low light.\nOn days 4 and 5 after injury or sham operation, each animal was handled\nfor 3 min by the experimenter. On day 6 animals underwent fear conditioning\ntraining in context A, a rectangular conditioning chamber (21.6 cm \u00d7 17.8\ncm \u00d7 12.7 cm) with Plexiglas and metal walls, and a metal grid floor (Med\nAssociates, St. Albans, VT, USA). Animals were allowed to freely explore the\nchamber for 1 min before experiencing 3 CS-US pairings (15s \u2013 105s\ninterstimulus interval, mean 60s). The mean of the first and second\ninterstimulius intervals (ISI) was consistently 60s, with the actual duration of\nISI 1 vs ISI 2 assigned pseudo-randomly within a group, but consistent across\ngroups such that each ISI pair used in a sham animal was used in a subsequent\nLFPI animal. One min after the final CS-US pairing (5 min total), mice were\nremoved from context A and placed back in their home cage (see\nFig. 1\nfor schematic). Twenty four hours\nlater (day 7) animals underwent behavioral testing to measure threat responses\nin context B, a custom made triangular conditioning chamber with black striped\nPlexiglas walls and a smooth, opaque black plastic floor, scented with organic\nvanilla extract. Mice were allowed to freely explore the chamber for 1 min\nbefore experiencing 3 presentations of the CS alone (60s, interstimulus\ninterval). Again, animals were removed from context B after a total of 5min.\nDuring testing, freezing behavior was scan sampled every 5\nth\nsecond\nfrom the onset of the first CS presentation to the end of the trial (4 min\ntotal). Freezing was defined as a total lack of movement aside from respiration\nat the instant of every 5\nth\nsecond. The total instance of freezing\nwas then divided by total observations to generate a freezing percentage per\nanimal. Behavioral data was collected from 26 animals (17 sham; 9 LFPI).\nFig. 1. LFPI decreases freezing in a cued fear conditioning paradigm.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A)\nAnimals are trained in context A on day 6 after injury and\ntested in a novel context (context B) on day 7 (CS- 75dB white noise and yellow\nlight pulses flickering at 4 Hz, 20 s; US- 1.05 mA footshock, 1.5 s). The inter\nstimulus interval (ISI) was between 15\u2013105 s with a trial mean of 60s,\nmeaning the first and second ISI always added up to 120 s. (\nB)\nPercent of time freezing after presentation of CS on day 7. LFPI animals freeze\nsignificantly less after injury (sham n=17, LFPI n=9,\nP\n<0.001***).\n\nElectrophysiology\nAll electrophysiological experiments were performed on days 7\u20138\nafter injury or sham surgery. Slice preparation was performed as previously\ndescribed (\nJohnson et al., 2014\n).\nBriefly, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, the brain was dissected out\nand placed in ice-cold oxygenated (95%O\n2\n/ 5%CO\n2\n)\nsucrose-containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM):\nsucrose 202, KCl 3, NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n2.5, NaHCO\n3\n26,\nglucose 10, MgCl\n2\n1, CaCl\n2\n2. Coronal slices 300 \u03bcm\nthick were cut on a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL,\nUSA) and transferred to 33\u201337\u00b0C oxygenated (95%O\n2\n/\n5%CO\n2\n) control aCSF containing (in millimolar): NaCl 130, KCl 3,\nNaH\n2\nPO\n4\n1.25, NaHCO\n3\n26, glucose 10,\nMgCl\n2\n1, CaCl\n2\n2. Slices were allowed to incubate for\nat least 60 min before recording. VSD imaging and field potential recordings\nwere performed in an interface chamber, intracellular recordings were performed\nin a submersion chamber, both with a flow rate of approximately 2.0 ml/min and\nmaintained at 27\u201330\u00b0C. Brain slices for recording were\nconsistently selected from the same rostral-caudal region of the amygdala that\nexhibited a pear shaped basolateral amygdala (BLA) contiguous with an ovoid\ncentral amygdala (CeA), as seen in\nFigs.\n2\n&\n3\n. This rigid criterion\nresulted in 1-2 brain slices per animal. Brain slices were hemisected prior to\nrecording and only slices from the hemisphere ipsilateral to the site of injury\nwere used. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that contralateral slices\nare altered by LFPI and thus do not serve as an appropriate control for the\ninjured hemisphere (\nTran et al., 2006\n).\nFor single cell recordings, a maximum of 1 cell per brain slice was used for\nanalysis.\nFig. 2. LFPI decreases lateral amygdala evoked basolateral amygdala fEPSP's.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A)\nRepresentative fEPSP recordings from brain slices of sham\n(green) and LFPI (red) animals (200 \u03bcA stimulation intensity).\n(B)\nAverage fEPSP slope input-output (I/O) curve (50-500\n\u03bcA, 50 \u03bcA steps, stimulation).

The solid color line shows the mean values and the shaded area is a\nSEM ellipse.\nField excitatory post synaptic potential recording (fEPSP) electrodes\nwere fabricated from borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota,\nFL, USA, #1B150F-4) pulled to a tip resistance of 2-6 M\u03a9 and filled with\naCSF. Field potentials were recorded in the central region of the BLA (\nFig. 2\n) with an Axoclamp 900A amplifier and\npClamp10 data acquisition software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA),\nfiltered at 2 kHz. Stimulating electrodes were non-concentric bipolar (World\nPrecision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA, #ME12206) and placed in the dorsal\nmost portion of the lateral amygdala (LA), just medial of the external capsule.\nElectrical stimuli were 100 \u03bcs in duration. Field potential input-output\nrelationships (50-500 \u03bcA stim, 50 \u03bcA increments, 8 s inter\nstimulus interval) and paired-pulse ratios (200uA stim, 75 ms inter stimulus\ninterval, 8 s inter-pair interval) were performed prior to VSD recordings. Field\npotential recordings were also recorded simultaneously with VSD recordings. The\ninter-stimulus interval for field potentials recorded during the VSD trials was\n20 s. This duration was necessary to accommodate the every other trial\nsubtraction method used for VSD analysis. Simultaneous VSD and field recordings\nwere performed at 100 \u03bcA, 200 \u03bcA and 300 \u03bcA stimulation\nintensities in aCSF. Only the 200 \u03bcA stimulation intensity was used for\nexperiments using various pharmacological manipulations. All figures and\nstatistics reported in the manuscript are based on the 200 \u03bcA stimulation\nintensity data. However, see\nTable 1\nfor\ndata and statistics generated from all stimulation intensities. The 200\n\u03bcA stimulation intensity was chosen because it elicits an approximately\nhalf maximal field potential response, while providing a high enough signal to\nnoise ratio for VSD analysis. A subset of brain slices underwent field potential\nrecordings and/or VSD imaging in the presence of 50 \u03bcM\nD-(-)-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV) + 6 \u03bcM\n6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) to suppress ionotropic glutamatergic\ntransmission, 0.4 \u03bcM TTX to block voltage-gated sodium channels, or 1\n\u03bcM CGP 55845 to antagonize GABA\nB\nreceptors. Field potential\ndata was analyzed using pClamp10 and in house, custom written MATLAB\nscripts.\nTable 1.\nRegion_Peak:\n100uA Stimulation\n200uA Stimulation\n300uA Stimulation\nANOVA Stats (by region)\nACSF\nSham (\u0394F/F):Sham\n(\u0394F/F):\nLFPI (\u0394F/F):\np-value:\nSham (\u0394F/F):Sham\n(\u0394F/F):\nLFPI (\u0394F/F):\np-value:\nSham (\u0394F/F):Sham\n(\u0394F/F):\nLFPI (\u0394F/F):\np-value:\nF values\nP-value\nBLA(m)_FDP\n12.91\n9.48\n0.0012\n17.77\n12.42\n0.0021\n20.86\n14.35\n0.0033\nF(1,14)=\n19.94\n0.0005\n95% CI\n11.94\u201314.14\n7.74\u2013\n10.96\n15.59\u201319.71\n10.82\u2013\n14.79\n18.07\u201311.84\n11.84\u2013\n17.32\nBLA(m)_SDP\n6.87\n5.89\n0.0311\n10.9\n7.75\n0.0115\n10.53\n7.69\n0.0052\nF(1,14)=\n10.83\n0.0054\n95% CI\n5.77\u20137.94\n4.32\u2013\n6.57\n8.72\u201311.62\n6.96\u2013\n9.22\n9.65\u201313.2\n7.07\u2013\n9.4\nBLA(m)_SNP\n\u22120.64\n\u22121.5\n0.0962\n0.87\n\u22120.59\n0.0229\n2.41\n0.21\n0.0079\nF(1,14)=7.5\n0.016\n95% CI\n\u22121.22--.15\n\u22122.02--\n.65\n.09\u20132.65\n\u22121.5\u2013\n0.55\n1.48\u20134.27\n\u22120.84\u2013\n1.59\nBLA(I)_FDP\n8.83\n8.49\n0.4524\n12.44\n9.81\n0.0416\n15.68\n10.68\n0.0164\nF(1,14)=\n7.01\n0.0191\n95% CI\n8.02\u201310.1\n5.34\u2013\n9.6\n11.24\u201314.87\n8.12\u2013\n12.4\n13.89\u201317.71\n8.79\u2013\n14.38\nBLA(I)_SDP\n6.97\n6.1\n0.5848\n10.09\n8.63\n0.2463\n11.23\n8.97\n0.0545\nF(1,14)=\n3.26\n0.0524\n95% CI\n6.15\u20138.12\n4.75\u2013\n8.28\n8.77\u201311.62\n7.55\u2013\n10.47\n9.48\u201313.84\n7.61\u2013\n10.32\nBLA(I)_SNP\n\u22120.34\n\u22120.51\n0.5543\n0.33\n\u22120.16\n0.0416\n1.72\n0.47\n0.0229\nF(1,14)=\n5.422\n0.0354\n95% CI\n\u2212.74\u2013.14\n\u22121.05--\n.1\n.09\u20132.32\n\u22120.76\u2013\n0.43\n1.07\u20133.97\n\u2212.28\u20131.3\nCeA_FDP\n8.27\n5.4\n0.0002\n11.53\n7.15\n0.0012\n12.95\n7.56\n0.0003\nF(1,14)=\n33.08\n<0.0001\n95% CI\n7.41\u20139.44\n4.38\u2013\n6.1\n10.09\u201312.85\n5.63\u2013\n8.64\n11.69\u201314.37\n6.16\u2013\n9.42\nCeA_SNP\n0.61\n\u22120.13\n0.0545\n1.75\n\u22120.21\n0.0007\n2.34\n\u22120.12\n0.0002\nF(1,14)=\n30.46\n<0.0001\n95% CI\n\u2212.11\u2013.98\n\u2212.7\u2013.5\n1.05\u20132.25\n\u22120.75\u2013\n0.34\n1.94\u20132.98\n\u2212.37\u2013.76\nOpen in a new tab\nWhole-cell patch-clamp current-clamp recording electrodes were\nfabricated from borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL,\nUSA, #1B150F-4) pulled to a tip resistance of 4\u20137 M\u03a9 and filled\nwith an internal solution containing (in milimolar): KGluconate 145, KCl 2.5,\nNaCl 2.5, HEPES 10, MgCl\n2\n2, ATP.Mg 2, GTP.Tris 0.5, and BAPTA .1.\nWhole-cell recordings of BLA pyramidal neurons were performed using a Multiclamp\n700B amplifier and pClamp10 data acquisition software (Molecular Devices,\nSunnyvale, CA, USA). All current-clamp recording voltages were corrected for a\nliquid junction potential calculated at \u221214.5 mV (using the Junction\nPotential utility in Clampex 10.3), and a series voltage error of 2.2 mV. The\nresting membrane potential was measured immediately following break in, and then\ncurrent was injected to bring cells to the target holding/resting membrane\npotential of \u221278mV. Target membrane potential value was chosen\nempirically based on the resting membrane potential of initial whole cell\nrecordings. Measures of intrinsic excitability were gathered from a series of\nhyperpolarizing and depolarizing current injections through the whole-cell\nrecording electrode (\u221250-225 pA, 25 pA increments, 8s inter step\ninterval). BLA pyramidal neurons were identified on the basis of previously\ncharacterized morphological and physiological properties (\nSah et al., 2003\n). Whole-cell current-clamp data was\nanalyzed using pClamp10 software.\n\nVoltage-Sensitive Dye Imaging Acquisition\nVoltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSD) acquisition using Neuroplex software\nwas performed as previously described (\nJohnson\net al., 2014\n). Briefly, VSD dye di-3-ANEPPDHQ (Invitrogen) was\nprepared at a working concentration of 67 \u03bcg/ml in aCSF and applied to\nslices for 16 min. The slices were subsequently rinsed in standard aCSF and\ntransferred to the interface recording chamber. The dye was excited by seven\nhigh-power green LEDs (Luxeon Rebel LXML-PM01-0100, Philips) coupled to a 535\n\u00b1 25 nm bandpass filter and 565 nm dichroic mirror. Fractional changes in\nVSD fluorescence (\u0394F/F) were isolated with a 610 nm longpass filter and\nrecorded at 1.0 kHz with a fast video camera with 80 \u00d7 80 pixel\nresolution (NeuroCCD, Redshirt Imaging, Decatur, GA, USA) through a reverse-lens\nmacroscope with a 50 mm f/1.3 M46 lens (Dark Invader). Each camera pixel imaged\na 25 \u03bcm \u00d7 25 \u03bcm region of tissue. The green light stimulus\nwas triggered 230 ms prior to fluorescence acquisition, followed by electrical\nstimulation 170 ms after onset of fluorescence acquisition. All VSD recordings\nwere 13 trials, 1.0 s in duration (1000 samples), with a 20 s interval between\nelectrically stimulated trials. Each stimulated trial was followed 10 s later,\nby a non-electrically stimulated trial that was used to subtract photo-bleaching\nfrom the active signal (see below for details).\n\nVoltage-Sensitive Dye Imaging Analysis\nEach individual VSD trial used to create brain slice averages, was\nmanually reviewed for ambient light contamination and gross abnormalities; if\npresent, these trials were excluded from further analysis. Initial processing\nwas performed as described in (\nJohnson et al.,\n2014\n). Fractional change in fluorescence values (\u0394F/F) was\ncalculated as follows: fluorescence values for each pixel in each trial were\nnormalized according to the average fluorescence in the pixel during a 64 ms\nwindow immediately preceding the electrical stimulus. Then, the average from the\ncorresponding pixel in the non-electrically stimulated trial was normalized and\nsubtracted from the individual electrically stimulated trials to correct for\nphoto-bleaching. VSD recordings were filtered in x and y spatial coordinates by\nconvolution with a 5 pixels \u00d7 5 pixels Gaussian filter (\u03a3 = 1.2\npixels), and in time by convolution with a five sample median filter. No\nadditional filtering was applied to any of the images or analysis of VSD data.\nFor VSD videos and representative movie frames, the \u0394F/F for each pixel\nfor the given sample (ms) is displayed as pseudocolor superimposed onto the\nimage of the brain slice. Time points selected for the representative movie\nframes in (\nFig. 3\n), correlate to\nflorescence peaks analyzed in the regional average line plots (\nFig. 3\n&\n4\n). Peaks maps (\nFig. 5\n) were\ngenerated by pseudocoloring and plotting the maximum \u0394F/F value of any\nsample at each pixel.\nFig. 4.

To begin raster\nconstruction, regions of interest (anatomical regions) were defined for\nsegmentation. In these experiments, the anatomical boundaries of central\namygdala (CeA) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) were clearly visible and used to\ndraw region boundaries. There was no clear, reliable anatomical boundary\nseparating lateral and basal amygdala in our images, thus they were combined\ninto the \u201cBLA\u201d region for analysis, unless specifically stated.\nHowever, the BLA was further divided into medial (BLA(m)) and lateral (BLA(l))\nsections. Medial and lateral BLA were analyzed separately as they are\nphysiologically distinct, in that they receive differential inputs from other\nbrain regions and sit in a different position along the general dorsoventral,\nlateromedial directionality of amygdala inter-nuclear signaling (\nDuvarci and Pare, 2014\n;\nSah et al., 2003\n). Regions were then split\ninto 100 \u03bcm segments along the dorsoventral axis, numbering segments in\nascending order from dorsal to ventral location (see\nFig. 3\n). Average \u0394F/F vales were calculated for each\nspatiotemporal site and plotted as pseudocolor in the distance from stimulating\nelectrode versus time raster plots. To account for slight variability in region\nof interest size when creating average raster plots, all individual slice raster\nplots were stretched or compressed to have the same number of segments. That\nnumber was set as the mean number of segments from the individual slices (CeA =\n6, BLA(m) = 12, BLA(l) = 12).\nStatistical comparison of group raster plots was performed at each\nindividual spatiotemporal site using a permutation test (t=1000). Permutation is\na nonparametric test that randomly resamples data to generate a null\ndistribution describing variability in the data. Significant differences\n(\u03b1 < .05) are registered at sites where the experimental versus\ncontrol groupings explain the variability in the data. The p-values generated\nare displayed in pseudocolor on a p-value heat-map (\nFig. 4A\nrow 4\n). To clarify areas of significant difference between average\nraster plots, the sham raster plot was subtracted from the LFPI raster plot, and\nonly the \u0394F/F differences at sites with p = < 0.05 are plotted\n(\nFig. 4A\nrow 3\n).\nMulti-segment regional averages were calculated and used to create line\nplots (\nFig. 3\n&\n4\n). Line plots show the average \u0394F/F (dark line)\nsurrounded by SEM ellipses (shaded surrounding). The segments selected for line\nplots were the same between conditions and consistent by region (CeA = seg 1-3,\nBLA(m) = seg 2-6, BLA(l) = seg 2-6). To look at signal propagation through the\namygdala circuit we assessed the ratio of activation in the lateral amygdala\n(LA) compared to the basal amygdala (BA) or CeA. The quantification of\nactivation for these ratios, seen in (\nFig.\n5B&C\n) is based on fast depolarizing peak (FDP) values from\nmulti-segment averages within each region. The LA region was defined as a\ncombination of segments 1-3 of both BLA(m) and BLA(l). The BA region was defined\nas a combination of segments 7-10 of both BLA(m) and BLA(l). The CeA region was\nviewed in its entirety (segments 1-6) for this analysis, as we were interested\nin both the magnitude and distance of signal propagation. VSD analysis was\nperformed using a combination of Neuroplex, custom MATLAB scripts, and GraphPad\nPrism. VSD/electrophysiological data was collected in 74 slices prepared from 41\nanimals.\n\nStatistical Procedures\nAll statistical analyses and calculations were performed using MATLAB\nand/or GraphPad Prism.\nA priori\npower calculations were\nperformed using G*Power (\nF. Faul et al.,\n2007\n) based on variability from similar previous experiments. All\nstatistical tests for significance were conducted using Mann-Whitney U-tests,\ntwo-way repeated-measures ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparison test in order\nto test for injury effect and stimulation intensity effect or the permutation\ntest described in (\nBourgeois et al.,\n2014\n), where applicable. Statistical significance was\nP\n<0.05 (\nP\n<0.05*,\nP\n<0.01**,\nP\n<0.001***). N values are reported per\nbrain slice and per animal, where appropriate, with a maximum of 2 slices per\nanimal. For physiological experiments (fEPSP and VSD) when multiple brain slices\nfrom a single animal were used, data from individual brain slices generated from\nthe same animal were averaged yielding a single animal value for each given\nmeasure. The value generated was used in group analysis and statistics, based on\nthe animal N. For pharmacological manipulation pre vs. post drug wash\ncomparisons, slices were considered independent samples, used for analysis and\nstatistics, based on the slice N. Data in the figures are presented as group\nmeans \u00b1 SEM."

    "Methods": "Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were studied; all procedures on live animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Florida. Twenty-five rats received C2Hx injury, and respiratory outcomes were compared between groups receiving mid-cervical injections of cell suspension medium (sham, N=8), cell suspension of embryonic day 14 (E14) fetal spinal cord (FSC, N=5), and E14 MB neurons which included the midline medullary raph\u00e9 nuclei (N=12). The intraspinal allograft or sham injections were performed one week following C2Hx. Additionally, two spinal intact rats (no prior surgery) were used for histological evaluation of the spinal cord. Embryonic donor tissue was obtained from pregnant female rats of the same strain. Prospective inclusion criteria for all rats included histologically verified anatomically complete hemisection lesions. For MB transplants, prospective criterion for a successful graft was immunohistological detection of 5-HT positive neurons in the immediate region of injection.\n\nSCI and subsequent allografting\nRats were anesthetized with xylazine (10 mg/kg, s.q. Fort Dodge animal Health, IA, USA) and ketamine (140 mg/kg, i.p., Fort Dodge Animal Health, IA, USA), and C2Hx was induced as described previously (\nFuller et al., 2008\n) (see\nFig. 1A\n). For harvest of E14 donor tissue, pregnant rats were anesthetized as described above, embryos removed individually to ice cold Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) followed by dissection of the caudal rhombencephalon, extending from pontine flexure to the rostral cervical spinal cord. The harvest included the B1-3 raph\u00e9 regions (\nKonig, 1989\n) Preliminary immunochemistry experiments confirmed that the midline medullary raph\u00e9 nuclei were included in the harvest (\nFig. 1B\n). After MB tissue was harvested, it was minced and dissociated by gentle pipetting in HBSS. Tissue was mixed with trypsin-EDTA (0.25% trypsin, 1.0M EDTA, Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA, USA) and incubated for 7-min in a 37\u00b0C water bath. Quenching of trypsin activity with fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA, USA) was followed by manual trituration through progressively smaller bore Pasteur pipettes. The suspension was centrifuged (80\u00d7g, 10-min), suspended in minimal essential culture medium (Invitrogen Corporation, Grand Island, NY, USA), and adjusted to a concentration of 50,000\u201375,000 cells/\u03bcl. For FSC transplants, fetal cords were isolated in HBSS and processed in the same manner as MB cells. At 1-wk post-C2Hx, anesthesia was induced as described above, the cervical spinal cord was surgically exposed, and 4\u20135 \u03bcl of cell suspension or minimal essential medium (sham) was injected 0.5\u20130.6 mm below the pial surface with a 31 gauge needle and Hamilton microsyringe (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV). The midline spinal cord was injected 1.0 mm from the caudal edge of the C2Hx lesion. The needle was slowly withdrawn 2-min following completion of the injection to minimize suspension reflux.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nA:\nTransverse histological section through C2 spinal cord following chronic C2Hx (cresyl violet stain).\nB:\nCoronal section of the E14 midline brainstem (MB) following incubation with 5-HT antibodies (fluorescent secondary antibody).

Baseline data were recorded during quiet breathing, and this was followed by a brief hypercapnic challenge (7% inspired CO\n2\n; onset indicated by the thick arrow).

A compressed record of the integrated phrenic activity (iPhr) during baseline and hypercapnic challenge is shown in the top traces (onset indicated by the thick arrow). The bottom traces show an expanded time scale of the raw burst depicting a few individual inspiratory efforts (thin arrows).\nI:\nMinute ventilation during the respiratory challenge. In the first graph, data are expressed relative to breathing in the sham group (%sham). The individual data point marked by ^ is from the animal with histology depicted in Panel E; the individual data point marked by * was obtained from the animal with histology depicted in Panel F. The second graph is a histogram depicting minute ventilation expressed relative to body mass (mls/min100g) in animals with successful or failed MB grafts, and also FSC or sham transplant. One-way ANOVA indicated a difference in breathing across these groups, with successful MB grafts having the highest value.\nJ:\nWaveform averages of integrated phrenic activity recorded ipsilateral to injury during baseline (left panel) and respiratory challenge (right panel). On average the increase in burst area was greater in rats with successful MB graft compared to sham treatment (inset panel). With the exception of Panel B, all data presented in Figure 1 were obtained at 6 weeks following the transplantation procedures (i.e., 7 weeks post-C2Hx injury).\n\nPlethysmography and phrenic nerve recordings\nPlethysmography (Buxco Inc., Wilmington, NC, USA) (\nFuller et al., 2008\n) was used to measure breathing in unanesthetized rats six weeks following cell transplantation. Chamber pressure, temperature and humidity, and rectal temperature were used to calculate tidal volume (ml/breath) and minute ventilation (ml/minute). Baseline recordings were made for 60-min while the chamber was flushed with 21% O\n2\n(balance N\n2\n). Subsequently, rats were given a 5-min hypercapnic challenge (7% CO\n2\n, 21% O\n2\n, balance N\n2\n). Baseline data were analyzed over a stable 10-min period immediately prior to the respiratory challenge. Hypercapnic challenge data were averaged over the final 2-min.\nThe impact of C2Hx on breathing patterns has been well-characterized in the rat model, and here we compared breathing patterns across the experimental groups, all of which had C2Hx. Data were expressed as absolute units (i.e., breaths*min\n\u22121\n), relative to body weight (e.g., ml/100g), or relative to values obtained in sham treated rats (%Sham). Statistical tests included one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) within each breathing condition, or unpaired t-test. Comparisons of ages and weights were also made using one-way ANOVA.\nNeurophysiological studies were conducted 1\u20132 days after plethysmography. After brief exposure to isoflurane (3\u20134% in O\n2\n) a urethane solution was administered (1.6g/kg in saline, i.p., Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The trachea was cannulated to enable mechanical ventilation and the vagus nerves were sectioned in the mid-cervical region. Pancuronium bromide (2.5 mg/kg\ni.v.\n) was given to eliminate spontaneous breathing efforts. Arterial blood pressure (Statham P-10EZ pressure transducer and CP122 AC/DC strain gauge amplifier, Grass Instruments, Warwick, RI, USA) was measured via a femoral catheter. Arterial PO\n2\n(PaO\n2\n) and PCO\n2\n(PaCO\n2\n), as well as pH, were determined from ~0.2 ml arterial blood samples (i-Stat, Heska, Fort Collins, CO, USA). Rectal temperature was monitored using a thermistor and maintained at 37\u00b11\u00b0C using servo-controlled heating pad (model TC-1000, CWE, Ardmore, PA, USA). The end-tidal CO\n2\npartial pressure (P\nET\nCO\n2\n) was monitored using a mainstream analyzer positioned a few centimeters from the tracheostomy tube (Capnogard, Novametrix Medical Systems, Wallingford, CT, USA).\nExtracellular phrenic nerve recordings were made using silver wire electrodes, amplified (1000\u00d7) and filtered (band pass 100\u201310,000 Hz) using a differential A/C amplifier (Model 1700, A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA, USA). The amplified signal was full-wave rectified and moving averaged (time constant 100 ms; model MA-1000; CWE Inc., Ardmore, PA, USA). Data were digitized using a CED Power 1401 data acquisition interface and recorded using Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design Limited, Cambridge, England). The end-tidal CO\n2\napneic threshold for inspiratory phrenic activity was determined by gradually increasing the ventilator rate until inspiratory bursting ceased in both phrenic nerves. The ensuing apnea was maintained for 2\u20133 min, and the ventilator rate was then gradually decreased until inspiratory activity reappeared. The P\nET\nCO\n2\nwas then maintained 2 mmHg above this value for a 20\u201330 min baseline period. Rats were then exposed to a 5-min bout of hypercapnia achieved by raising the inspired CO\n2\nuntil the P\nET\nCO\n2\nreached 70 mmHg.\nWaveform averages of integrated phrenic signals were created from 2 min segments of data during both the baseline period and the hypercapnic challenge (\ne.g.\n, an average of 120\u2013150 inspiratory bursts during each period). The waveform averages were scaled identically and plotted on the same axes to enable direct comparison of the appearance of the phrenic burst across MB transplant and sham groups. The burst amplitude was calculated as the raw voltage (labeled as \u201carbitrary units\u201d or a.u.). The total area of the integrated burst was measured (\ni.e.\n, a.u.*sec\n\u22121\n), expressed relative to baseline values, and compared using an unpaired t-test.\n\nSpinal cord histology and immunohistochemistry\nRats were anesthetized as described above and systemically perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The cervical spinal cord was removed and 40 \u03bcm transverse sections were made using a vibrotome. Prior to incubation with the primary antibody against 5-HT, sections were washed in PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4, 3\u00d75-min), blocked against endogenous peroxidase activity (30% methanol, 0.6% hydrogen peroxide in 0.1 M PBS, incubated for 20-min), rewashed in PBS, treated with sodium borohydride (1% in dH2O, incubated for 30-min) given a third and final wash with PBS and blocked against nonspecific protein labeling (3% goat serum in 0.1M PBS with 0.03% Triton-X). Sections were then incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against 5-HT (1:20,000; Immunostar, Hudson, WI, USA) with 1% goat serum and 0.03% Triton-X overnight at 4\u00b0C. On the following day, tissue was washed in PBS with 0.3% Triton-X (0.1 M, 3\u00d75-min), blocked against nonspecific protein labeling (3% goat serum in 0.1M PBS with 0.03% Triton-X, 30 minutes) and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature in a biotinylated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit; 1:100; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). This was followed by a second round of washes in PBS with 0.3% Triton-X (3\u00d75-min), a second round of blocking against nonspecific protein labeling (3% goat serum in 0.1M PBS with 0.03% Triton-X, 30 minutes) and a 30-min incubation in rabbit peroxidase anti-peroxidase (1:400; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Sections were then given a third series of washes in PBS with 0.3% Triton-X, and antigen was visualized with nickel-enhanced diaminobenzidine (DAB with 1% nickel ammonium sulfate; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in the presence of H\n2\nO\n2\n. Some tissue sections were counter-stained with Cresyl violet to enable visualization of neuronal cell bodies."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nAll animal procedures were performed under an appropriate Home Office Licence and adhered to regulations as specified in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986). Studies were performed in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines, with appropriate randomisation and blinding procedures in place, and ethical approval by the local ethics committee of the University of Manchester. Mice were kept at 21\u00a0\u00b0C and 65% humidity with a regulated 12-h light\u2013dark cycle and free access to food and water. Twenty-nine male C57/BL6 mice (Harlan Laboratories, UK) weighing between 30 and 36\u00a0g (age 18 to 25\u00a0weeks) were used in this study. Ten C57/BL6 male mice underwent i.p. injection of 20\u00a0ng/kg mouse recombinant IL-1\u03b2 (R&D systems, UK) in sterile PBS and 0.5% low endotoxin BSA, 30\u00a0min prior to a 30\u00a0min MCAo with 6\u00a0h reperfusion; the remaining ten mice underwent i.p. injection of sterile PBS with 0.5% low endotoxin BSA alone (vehicle), 30\u00a0min prior to a 30\u00a0min ischaemic insult with 6\u00a0h reperfusion. In addition four C57/BL6 mice underwent the IL-1 protocol and five C57/BL6 mice underwent the vehicle protocol but were sacrificed 10\u00a0min after removal of the MCAo filament (i.e. 70\u00a0min after injection) for further immunohistochemical analysis. Though IL-1\u03b2 was injected in the interest of brevity the rest of the manuscript will simply refer to IL-1.\n\n2.2. Remote filaments\nFilament preparation was performed as described in (\nBurrows et al., 2015\n) producing 5\u00a0cm remote filaments with a Xantopren M Mucosa and Activator NF Optosil (Heraeus, GER) mix for tip coating, first described by (\nEngel et al., 2011\n). A 2\u00a0cm length of clear i.v. catheter tubing (Portex, Kent UK) was used to aid stability during insertion of the filament.\n\n2.3. Surgical preparation\nAnaesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane (Abbott, Berkshire, UK) in room air. Once the animals were unconscious with lack of pedal reflex, they were maintained under 2% isoflurane via a face mask for surgery and, once a tracheal cannula had been inserted, 1% to 1.5% isoflurane for the remainder of the experiment. MCAo was performed by advancing the custom made filament through the external carotid artery (ECA) up to the internal carotid artery to a point just before the MCA branch (\nBurrows et al., 2015\n). For imaging experiments, animals were fixed in a stereotactic frame (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) with ear bars, mouth bar and a dorsal head post to prevent movement. Animals were artificially ventilated with 1% to 1.5% isoflurane in room air via a Zoovent Jetsys ventilator (Universal Lung Ventilators Ltd., Milton Keynes, UK). Body temperature was maintained at 37.5\u00a0\u00b0C via a heating blanket controlled with a rectal probe (Harvard Apparatus, Kent, UK), and the heart rate was monitored via ECG throughout the experiment. The scalp was dissected down the midline to expose the skull. The bone over the area of the somatosensory cortex supplied by the MCA in the stroked hemisphere was kept translucent with a saline filled paraffin well closed by a circular cover slip.\n\n2.4. Two-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy\nTwo-dimensional spectroscopic imaging data were collected through the imaging window over the intact skull using a high signal-to-noise charged coupled device (CCD) camera (Pantera 1M30, DALSA, Munich, Germany). The region of interest was illuminated sequentially by four different wavelengths of light (550\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0nm, 560\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0nm, 577\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0nm, and 700\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0nm) using a Lambda DG-4 high-speed filter changer (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA). Camera data collection was synchronized with the filter changer so that each image frame was recorded with one of the four different cortical illumination wavelengths in a sequential manner at a rate of 28\u00a0Hz. A ceramic attenuator (PI Instruments, Bedford, UK) was attached to a single whisker on the right whisker pad to enable computer-controlled mechanical stimulation of the barrel cortex throughout the experiment. A single imaging experiment consisted of a continuous recording of 30 trials. Each trial was 16\u00a0s long and contained a 4-s pre-stimulus period; 4\u00a0s of 8\u00a0Hz mechanical whisker stimulation and an 8-s recovery time. These 8-min experiments were recorded before injection, post injection, during, and after MCAo for both experimental groups as shown in\nFig. 1\n.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nExperimental time line; red bars display 8\u00a0minute trials during which imaging data were recorded pre-injection, post-injection, during occlusion and for 6\u00a0h following reperfusion. Note that timeline is representative and not to scale.\n\n2.5. Imaging protocol\nA region of interest (ROI) for imaging was chosen to include the main branches of the MCA and the barrel cortex as identified by localized functional activity from mechanical whisker stimulation. Three sets of trials were recorded for baseline comparison after which the animals underwent i.p. injection with 20\u00a0ng/kg IL-1\u03b2 or vehicle treatment (\nFig. 1\n). Post injection of IL-1\u03b2 or vehicle, a further three sets of trials were recorded during the 30\u00a0min prior to filament advancement. Then the remote filament was advanced ~\u00a02 to 4\u00a0mm to induce a 30\u00a0min occlusion of the MCA. During the MCAo three further trials were recorded. The remote filament was then retracted back 6\u00a0mm to allow full reperfusion of the MCA. Trials were then recorded every 30\u00a0min for 6\u00a0h after reperfusion. After 6\u00a0h reperfusion, the animal was transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline solution containing 0.5% sodium nitrate followed by 2% paraformaldehyde solution. After fixing, the brain was removed, stored in 2% paraformaldehyde for 24\u00a0h and submerged in a 30% sucrose solution for a further 24\u00a0h.\n\n2.6. Tissue processing\nCoronal brain sections (30\u00a0\u03bcm thick) were cut on a sledge microtome (Leica, Milton Keynes, UK) with freezing stage (Bright Instruments, Huntingdon, UK). Sections were stored in antifreeze solution (30% ethylene glycol and 20% glycerol (Sigma, Gillingham, UK) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) at \u2212\u00a020\u00a0\u00b0C, before histological staining.\n\n2.7. Immunohistochemistry\nBrain sections were pre-mounted on charged slides (Fisher Scientific, USA) before antigen-retrieval, where slides were submerged in citrate buffer (Invitrogen) diluted 1:100 in distilled water or 10% methanol (Fisher, Loughborough, UK) with 3% H\n2\nO\n2\n(Sigma, UK) in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for IL-1 staining. A 1\u00a0h blocking step was performed using 2% of normal donkey or rabbit serum (Vector Labs, Peterborough, UK) in primary diluent (PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100; Sigma) or 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) with 5% normal rabbit serum (Vector Labs, UK) for IL-1 staining. Sections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-CD41/integrin alpha 2b antibody (platelets) (1:100, BD, NJ, USA), rabbit anti-Iba-1 (microglia) (1:1000, Abcam) and an immuno double-stain of rabbit anti-Iba-1 (microglia) (1:1000, Abcam) with goat anti-IL-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1 co-localisation) (1:100 R&D Systems, USA), primary goat anti-mouse IL-1\u03b2 IgG antibody (1:500, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Sections were further incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488\u00a0nm or Alexa 594\u00a0nm fluorochromes (1:500, Invitrogen, UK) for 2\u00a0h at room temperature or biotinylated rabbit anti-goat antibody (1:500, Vector Labs) for 2\u00a0h followed by nickel ammonia diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining procedure (for further details see (\nBrown et al., 2004\n,\nBurrows et al., 2015\n,\nLu and Partridge, 1998\n,\nNielsen et al., 1987\n) for IL-1 staining. A final wash was performed in PBS before application of Prolong Gold antifade reagent (with or without DAPI; Invitrogen, USA) used as the mounting medium for glass coverslips or DPX mounting medium (Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK). Images for analysis were captured using an Olympus widefield BX51 upright microscope with filter sets matching the fluorescence markers. Equivalent areas of the cerebral cortex at the same magnification (\u00d7\u00a020) were imaged across both groups for each specific marker.\nStructural images for CD41 platelets and Iba-1 changes were collected on a Leica TCS SP5 AOBS upright confocal microscope. When it was not possible to eliminate cross-talk between channels, the images were collected sequentially. The maximum intensity projections of these 3D stacks are shown in the results. Images were taken at \u00d7\u00a040 magnification. IL-1 IHC staining was captured using a brightfield Olympus S2X9 microscope to gain full-slice images.\nIgG immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the leakage of endogenous IgG into the brain parenchyma as a measure of BBB breakdown. Sections were washed with PBS followed by incubation with a second blocking agent, consisting of 5% normal horse serum (Vector Labs) and 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.3% Triton-X-100 (Sigma) was applied for 1\u00a0h. Sections were incubated with biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:500, Vector Labs). DAB staining protocol, as described above, was performed prior to coverslipping with DPX mounting medium.\nCresyl Violet (CV) stained brain sections were mounted on gelatinized slides and initially soaked in alcohol of increasing concentrations 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100% followed by descending order (4\u00a0min each concentration) to remove lipids and fixation chemicals from the tissue. Sections were then submerged with 1.5% CV staining solution. Ultraclear (4\u00a0min) was used as a clearing agent, making unstained parts of the tissue transparent followed by coverslipping with DPX mounting medium.\n\n2.8. Data analysis\n2.8.1. Immunohistochemistry\nImages of the cerebral cortex were collected from five evenly spaced sections spanning the somatosensory cortex from both hemispheres for comparison. IgG and IL-1\u03b2 were quantified by measuring the mean grey value (pixel density) of each hemisphere, the value of which was subtracted from the absolute white value (max), and comparing inter-hemispheric values. Activated microglial (Iba-1) and platelet cells (CD41) were double-blinded to eliminate bias and then counted manually and in each hemisphere in a 0.46\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.34\u00a0mm size region of the somatosensory cortex. CV cells for cortex counts were centred on layer IV with a 0.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.3\u00a0mm region of interest for all animals.\n\n2.9. Calculation of oxyhaemoglobin concentration\nChanges in oxyhaemoglobin concentrations were calculated by spectroscopic analysis with a pathlength scaling Beer Lambert algorithm (\nBerwick et al., 2005\n) between the sets of four wavelengths at different time points within the experiment. Baseline variability in cortical HbO\n2\nlevels was deduced from comparison of an image set recorded before injection with an image set recorded after injection but before occlusion. To establish the extent of the decrease in HbO\n2\nduring occlusion, we compared the set before occlusion (but after injection) with those at the end of the 30\u00a0min occlusion. Once these maps were created, we produced a single mask for each animal to exclude the large arteries and veins from further analysis. This approach allowed the calculation of \u03bcmolar changes in \u2206\u00a0HbO\n2\nconcentration in the area of microvascular perfusion of the parenchyma before, during and after occlusion, as well as comparisons between groups. For the visualization of \u0394HbO\n2\nwe created a \u03bcmol colour scale, with blue for a decrease, red an increase and with green colours indicating little change compared with the reference time point (\nFig. 2\n). For statistical evaluation, the mean pixel values of the regions outside the masks of \u0394HbO\n2\nmaps were calculated. Due to a slight variability of carrying out the complex experiment, the timing within the groups for the data acquisition during early reperfusion ranged from 8 to 12\u00a0min after block removal and later reperfusion ranged from 350 to 360\u00a0min. The timing of baseline recordings and recordings during occlusion was precise up to the minute (\nFig. 2\n).\nFig. 2.\nOpen in a new tab\n\u03bcmolar change in oxyhaemoglobin concentration. The first two columns show typical \u2206\u00a0HbO\n2\nmaps for an animal from the vehicle and IL-1 injected groups. The sudden drop in HbO\n2\nduring occlusion gives instant feedback that a successful occlusion has been initiated. On filament retraction we see an increase in HbO\n2\nconcentration in both groups. 180\u00a0min after removing the occlusion we start to see a decrease of the initial HbO\n2\nreperfusion levels for most animals in the vehicle injected group. However the IL-1 injected group shows a significantly worse decrease in HbO\n2\n. At 360\u00a0min post filament removal we have a continued decrease in \u2206\u00a0HbO\n2\nin the vehicle injected group often to levels below those during the ischaemic event. This late reperfusion deficit is even worse in IL-1 injected animals. The third column shows the masks drawn to exclude major vessels from quantitative analysis, leaving only the parenchyma to be quantified and correlated with post-experiment histological processing. The final column represents the \u03bcm colour scale. Scale bar\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mm, arrow points rostral.\n\n2.10. Statistical analysis\nAnimals were randomized for experiments and quantitative analyses were double-blinded across all groups; vehicle group n\u00a0=\u00a010, IL-1\u03b2 group n\u00a0=\u00a010. Past experience and review of referenced publications (\nDenes et al., 2010a\n,\nDenes et al., 2010b\n,\nMcColl et al., 2007a\n,\nMcColl et al., 2007b\n) have shown that a group size of 10 provides reasonable assurance of statistical power for this type of study. One-way ANOVA was used to compare mean HbO\n2\nconcentration change in \u03bcmolar values outside the masked regions in the imaging data and to compare between the two groups for the immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence marker staining, coupled with Bonferroni multiple comparison test in histology data to indicate differences between the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, calculated and displayed as mean values with error (\u00b1) displayed by standard deviation. The nine animals that were sacrificed 70\u00a0min after injection were analysed separately and not compared to the animals that had undergone 6\u00a0h reperfusion."

    "Methods": "ESC Culture\nTransgenic and RW4 mouse ESCs were cultured on gelatin-coated T-25 flasks in complete media, consisting of Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Life Technologies #11965-092, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies #16010-159), 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies #26140-079), and 1x Embryomax Nucleosides (Millipore #ES-008-D, San Francisco, CA). ESCs were passaged every two days at a 1:5 ratio in fresh complete media containing 1000 U/mL leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; Millipore # ESG1106) and 100\u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (BME; Life Technologies #21985-023).\n\nChx10-Puro Selection Vector\nThe targeting vector was constructed from a Gateway-compatible plasmid (pStart-K; Addgene #20346, Cambridge, MA) using a 750 bp Sal1-Asc1 fragment containing 5\u2032 untranslated sequences and a 750 bp Asc1-Not1 fragment containing 3\u2032 genomic sequences of\nChx10\nexon 1. A\nPAC/pGKneo\ndual resistance cassette was inserted between the two arms as previously described (\nMcCreedy et al., 2012\n). The dual resistance cassette contains from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032: Asc1 site, Kozak sequence, puromycin cassette with bgh polyA signal (PKO-Select Puro; Agilent Genomics, Santa Clara, CA), floxed phosphoglycerate kinase I promoter driving the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (PGK-neo) with bgh polyA signal, and AscI site (\nKozak, 1986\n;\nThomas and Capecchi, 1987\n;\nWu et al., 2008\n). Gateway recombination with the LR Clonase II Kit (Life Technologies #11791) was used to transfer aTTL-flanked regions into the pWS-TK3 vector, which contains the thymidine kinase gene for negative selection (\nSupplementary Figure 1A\n) (\nWu et al., 2008\n).\n\nElectroporation and Clonal Analysis\nA CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to insert our resistance cassette into the\nChx10\nlocus with high efficiency. The vector containing the Chx10 guide RNA (gChx10) was generated by the Genome Engineering Core at Washington University in St. Louis. The Chx10 gRNA sequences target the ATG start site of\nChx10\nexon 1 and were placed into a derivative of Addgene plasmid #43860; no common SNPs were found and off target profiles were excellent with at least 3 bp of mismatch between the target and any other site in the genome, which dramatically reduces the probability of an off target cut (\nVeres et al., 2014\n). The p3s-Cas9HC vector contains the Cas9 open reading frame (Addgene plasmid #43945) (\nCho et al., 2013\n). 1x10\n7\nRW4 ESCs were resuspended in electroporation buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, and 6 mM dextrose) with 8 \u03bcg Chx10-Puro selection vector, 1 \u03bcg Cas9 vector, and 1 \u03bcg gChx10 vector. Cells were electroporated at 0.23 kV and 960 \u03bcF in a 0.4 cm cuvette (Bio-Rad #165-2081, Hercules, CA) then plated on a 100 mm gelatin-coated petri dishes in complete media with LIF and BME for the cells to recover overnight. For the remainder of the expansion, cells were exposed to media containing LIF, BME, 150 nM fialuridine (FIAU, Moravek #M251, Brea, CA) and 40 \u03bcg/mL geneticin (G418, Life Technologies #10131) which was replaced every 2 days. After 10 days, single colonies were picked and plated into individual wells of a gelatin-coated 96-well plate. Clones were screened for correct insertion by junction PCR (Chx10Forward: GCCAACCGAGGAGAGCTAGAAGGTT; PACReverse: GCGCCAGGAGGCCTTCCATCTGTT-GCT) and expanded accordingly. The amplification region spanned from the endogenous 5\u2032 UTR (outside of the Chx10-Puro selection vector homology arm) into the PAC cassette to confirm targeted insertion (\nSupplemental Figure 1B\n). Fifty-six transgenic clones were screened for puromycin resistance in Chx10\n+\ninterneurons following V2a induction (see V2a Induction and V2a Selection).\nTransgenic clones with puromycin-resistant Chx10\n+\nINs were analyzed for PAC copy number by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using a customized TaqMan Copy Number Assay; mouse Tert was used as the endogenous control and the assay was prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Calculations were completed using CopyCaller Software (v2.0, Applied Biosystems). The calculated copy number of each clone was normalized to the calculated copy number for the Hb9-Puro ESC cell line, which was previously determined to contain a single PAC insertion (\nMcCreedy et al., 2014a\n).\n\nCre Excision\nThe PGK promoter and neomycin phosphotransferase genes were removed from an individual Chx10-Puro clone using the pTurboCre plasmid (gift from Timothy Ley). The pTurboCre plasmid (10ug) and an mRFP-expressing plasmid (1ug) were prepared for transfection using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies #L3000-001) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions; cells were transfected for 24 hours. ESC cultures were then dissociated and plated sparsely (3 x 10\n4\ncells) in a 100 mm gelatin-coated petri dish with complete media, LIF, and BME. Single colonies were picked after 10 days and plated in 96-well gelatin coated plates. When confluent, the ESCs were split and tested for sensitivity to neomycin by exposure to 40 \u03bcg/mL geneticin for 5 days; those not sensitive were discarded. A single transgenic clone was used as the Chx10-Puro ESC line used for the remaining studies.\n\nV2a Induction\nV2a INs were obtained from ESCs using a \u201c2\n\u2212\n/4\n+\n\u201d induction protocol. EBs were formed by transferring 1 x 10\n6\nESCs into 10 mL of DFK5 media on an agar-coated 100 mm petri dish for two days (2\n\u2212\n). DFK5 is a DMEM/F12 base media containing 5% Knockout Serum Replacement (Life Technologies #10828-028), 50 \u03bcM Nonessential Amino Acids (Life Technologies #11140-050), 100 \u03bcM BME, 1:100 100x Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium (Life Technologies #41400-045), 100 \u03bcM BME, 1:200 100x EmbryoMax Nucleosides. EB media was then replaced with 10 mL DFK5 containing 10nM retinoic acid (RA; Sigma #R2625) and 1\u03bcM purmorphamine (EMD Millipore #540223) for another two days (2\n+\n). For the final 2 days (4\n+\n), the media was replaced with DFK5 containing 10nM RA, 1\u03bcM purmorphamine and 5\u03bcM N-{N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-L-alanyl))-(S)-phenylglycine-t-butyl-ester (DAPT; Sigma #D5942). In induced V2a control cultures, the Shh antagonist cyclopamine (Cyc, 1 mM; Sigma #C4116) was used instead of purmorphamine.\n\nV2a Selection and Culture\nTo determine cell viability after selection, transgenic ESCs induced using the 2\n\u2212\n/4\n+\nprotocols were dissociated with 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies #25200-056) for 10 minutes with agitation and quenched with complete media containing 0.001% DNAse (Sigma #DN25). Dissociated cells were counted and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes then re-suspended in a selection media of DFK5NB containing B-27 supplement (Life Technologies #17504-044), glutaMAX (Life Technologies #35050-061), 5 ng/mL glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF; Peprotech #450-10, Rocky Hill, NJ), 5 ng/mL brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; Peprotech #450-02, Rocky Hill, NJ), 5 ng/mL neurotrophin-3 (NT-3; Peprotech #450-03), and 2 \u03bcg/mL or 4 \u03bcg/mL puromycin in water (Sigma #P8833). DFK5NB is a combination of DFK5 media and Neurobasal Media (Life Technologies #21103-049) mixed at a 1:1 ratio. For selected and unselected cultures respectively, 5x10\n6\ncells/cm\n2\nand 5x10\n5\ncells/cm\n2\nwere plated on individual laminin coated 24-well plates or 35mm dishes. After 24 hours of selection, the media was replaced with DFK5NB containing B27, Glutamax, NT-3, GDNF, and BDNF. The media was replenished as needed every two days.\n\nPost-Selection Cell Viability\nTo determine the cell viability after 24 hours of selection with puromycin, cells induced using the 2-/4\n+\nprotocol were rinsed twice with DFK4 media to remove debris then incubated for 30 minutes in fresh DFK5 media containing calcein-AM (Life Technologies # C481). Fluorescent images were captured using a MICROfire camera attached to an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope. Quantification was completed by flow cytometry (\nn\n=4 biological replicates, see Flow Cytometry).\n\nqRT-PCR\nqRT-PCR was performed and analyzed as previously described (\nBrown et al., 2014\n). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized using a High Capacity RNA-to cDNA Kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA was combined with TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) and TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). qRT-PCR was performed using a Step One Plus Applied Biosystems thermocyler with the following protocol: 95\u00b0C for 20s; 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 1s and 60\u00b0C for 20s. There were\nn=\n3 technical replicates completed per run and\nn=\n4 biological replicates for each condition. For PAC expression, samples were treated with DNAse (Qiagen #7924, Valencia, CA) prior to analysis.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nImmunocytochemistry staining was performed as previously described (\nMcCreedy et al., 2014a\n). Antibodies used include mouse anti-Chx10 (1:1000, Santa Cruz # sc-374151, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-Lhx3 (1:1000, Lim3, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB) #67.4E12, Iowa City IA), mouse anti-Hb9 (1:20, DSHB #81.5C10), mouse anti-Lim1/2 (1:50, DSHB #4F2), mouse anti-Evx1 (1:50, DSHB #99.1-3A2), rabbit anti-beta-tubulin III (1:1000, \u03b2tubIII, Covance #811801, Princeton, NJ), rabbit anti-Ki67 (1:250, Abcam #ab15580), guinea pig anti-Vglut2 (1:2500, EMD Millipore #AB2251), mouse anti-MAP2 (1:250, EMD Millipore #AB5622), rabbit anti-mouse anti-SV2 (1:100, DSHB #SV2), and secondary Alexa Fluor conjugated goat antibodies (1:200, Life Technologies). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoescht (1:1000, Life Technologies #H3569). For cell counting experiments, live cells were identified by phase contrast and Hoechst; only cells with apparent processes were included. Cell counts were performed using ImageJ (NIH); there were\nn=\n4 biological replicates for each condition with >450 cells counted per replicate.\n\nFlow Cytometry\nA modified 2\n\u2212\n/4\n+\nprotocol was used to obtain data on early expressing transcription factors in selected ESC-derived neuronal cultures. Briefly, EBs were dissociated at 2\n\u2212\n/3\n+\nand 5x10\n6\ncells were plated in individual wells of a laminin-coated 24-well plate in DFK5 media containing 10 nM RA, 1 \u03bcM purmorphamine, 5 \u03bcM DAPT, and 2 or 4 \u03bcg/mL puromycin for 24 hours. Surviving cells were dissociated with 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA for 5 minutes and quenched with complete media. Staining was conducted using the Transcription Buffer Set (Becton Dickinson #562725, Franklin Lakes, NJ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols with antibodies as described in \u201cImmunocytochemistry.\u201d Data was collected using a BD Canto II Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Between 10,000\u2013100,000 events were recorded per condition (\nn\n\u22654 biological replicates per condition) and analyzed using FloJo software (FlowJo, Ashland, OR); debris was removed from analysis using forward scatter versus side scatter and Hoechst versus forward scatter plots. Gating parameters were set using control groups stained only with secondary antibodies.\n\nSingle-Cell Electrophysiology\nCells were induced using the 2\n\u2212\n/4\n+\nprotocol, dissociated onto laminin coated 35 mm dishes at 2 x 10\n6\nand selected for 24 hours with puromycin. Cultures were grown for up to 10 days post-selection in DFK5NB media with growth factors prior to recording. Cultures were perfused with Tyrode\u2019s solution (150 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES, at pH 7.4). Whole-cell electrodes were filled with internal solution (140 mM K-glucuronate, 10mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.2 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES, at pH 7.4, supplemented with 5 mM Na-ATP and 1 mM Na-GTP). The open tip resistance was 2\u20135 MOhm. External solutions were delivered by local perfusion from an 8-barrelled pipette. Voltage-gated channel antagonists tetrodotoxin (TTX, 500 nM), tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA, 30 mM) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 5 mM) were dissolved in Tyrode\u2019s solution. Ligand-gated channel agonists were dissolved at 100 \u03bcM in 160 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 10 mM HEPES. Currents were recorded under voltage clamp with an Axopatch 200A amplifier, filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz using pClamp software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Evoked synaptic currents were detected by simultaneous whole-cell recordings from adjacent pairs of cells in Chx10-Puro/Olig2-Puro mixed cultures. Brief steps to 0 mV from a holding potential of \u221280 mV elicited fast inward sodium currents that escaped voltage control in the axon of presynaptic cells and evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents in the adjacent cell, which was held at \u221280 mV.\n\nV2a and pMN Co-Culture\nMixed Chx10-Puro and Olig2-Puro cultures were established to assess synapse formation between V2a INs and MNs. A constitutively active fluorescent reporter was knocked into the Rosa26 domain of the Chx10-Puro line as described above using the Ai9 plasmid (gifted by Hongkui Zeng, Addgene plasmid #22799)(\nMadisen et al., 2010\n), pTurboCre, the Cas9 plasmid, and Rosa26 guide RNAs (gR26) generated by the Genome Engineering Core at Washington University in St. Louis. Clones were screened for correct insertion by junction PCR (R26Forward: TCCCAAAGTCGCTCTGAGTT; CAGReverse: CCATCGCTGCACAAAATAAT) and expanded accordingly. The previously established Olig2-Puro ESC line contains the PAC gene under the expression of Olig2, which marks the pMN domain (\nMcCreedy et al., 2012\n). The Olig2-Puro and Chx10-Puro ESCs were induced according to their respective 2-/4\n+\nprotocols (\nMcCreedy et al., 2012\n), dissociated onto laminin (Life Technologies #23017-015) coated 35mm dishes at 2 x 10\n6\nat a 1:1 ratio and selected for 24 hours in DFK5NB with 4 \u03bcg/mL puromycin. The media was replaced with DFK5NB containing B27, Glutamax, NT-3, GDNF, and BDNF and was replenished as needed every two days for up to 7 days. Neurobasal media containing the supplements and growth factors was used for the remaining duration of culture up to 4 weeks.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using Statistica software (v5.5, StatSoft, Tulsa, OK). Significance was determined using Scheffe\u2019s post hoc test for analysis of variance (ANOVA) with confidence as indicated. Average values reported with error bars are the standard deviation or standard error of the mean (SEM) as indicated."

    "Methods": "SOD1\nG93A\ntransgenic rats\nFemale SOD1\nG93A\ntransgenic rats exhibiting slow disease progression were used in this study (\nSuzuki et al., 2007b\n). The SOD1\nG93A\ntransgenic male founders, originally obtained from Taconic (Hudson, NY) (\nHowland et al., 2002\n), were crossed with wild type female Sprague-Dawley rats to maintain colonies. While colony drift was previously observed in this transgenic rat line (\nSuzuki et al., 2007b\n), we have developed a genomic PCR screen and breeding schedule and now maintain stable lines that show similar disease onset and survival. Only animals showing disease onset before 150 days were used as breeders in order to minimize genetic drift in the colony that could increase variability in onset age of symptoms and end-stage age. Care was taken initially to select rats from sires that exhibited only hindlimb symptom onset. Rats exhibiting forelimb symptom onset were excluded from this study. Rats were maintained in a room with controlled illumination, temperature (23\u00b11 \u00b0C), and humidity. All animals were given free access to food and water. Heterozygous SOD1\nG93A\nprogeny were identified by genomic PCR screen using tail snip DNA and primers specific for human SOD1. All animal work in the present study was carried out in accordance with the guidelines for University of Wisconsin-Madison and National Institutes of Health standards of animal care.\n\nMuscle section preparation\nALS rats were sacrificed at pre-symptomatic (<80 days old), symptomatic (100\u2013120 days old), and endpoint stages (n=4\u20135 for each time point). Hind limb muscles (tibalis anterior; TA) were dissected and flash-frozen in super-cooled isopentane. The muscles were sectioned at 20 \u03bcm using a cryostat and placed on glass slides for staining. We confirmed that all symptomatic animals exhibited the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating score of 17 or lower (\nKrakora et al., 2013\n). Rats were considered at end-stage (endpoint) when they no longer exhibited reflexes allowing them to right themselves within 30 seconds. Our recent data from this colony indicates the median to reach disease onset and end-stage is 100 and 161 days, respectively (\nHayes-Punzo et al., 2012\n).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nThe muscle sections were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min or 4% paraformaldehyde-phosphate-buffered saline (PFA-PBS) for 20 min, and then incubated with primary antibodies at 4 \u00b0C for overnight. The following primary antibodies were used to probe for macrophages: anti-CD11b (OX-42, 1:500, mouse monoclonal, MorphoSys, Planegg, Germany), or anti-CD68 (ED1, 1:500, mouse monoclonal, AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC). The following antibodies were used to visualize and probe markers of TSCs and activated glial cells: anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:200, rabbit polyclonal, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), anti-nestin (1:50, rabbit polyclonal, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-S100\u03b2 (1:100, mouse monoclonal, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-4E2 (3G2) (neuromuscular junction and reactive Schwann cell associated antigen; 1:400, mouse monoclonal, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), and anti-GDNF family receptor alpha 1 (GFR\u03b11, 1:50, rabbit polyclonal, Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies. To identify endplate distribution, the muscle sections were incubated with \u03b1-bungarotoxin (\u03b1-BTX) conjugated with fluorescence marker Alexa Fluor 594 (1:1000, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) or CF405S (1:500, Biotium, Hayward, CA) with primary antibodies. After incubation with the primary antibodies, the sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Cy3 (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). All images were optimized by using a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescence microscope with a digital camera (DS-QiIMC, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The relative intensity of CD11b-positive signals was densitometrically evaluated using NIH ImageJ software. The number of S100\u03b2-positive endplates was presented as a percentage of the total number of counted NMJs. Approximately 50 endplates were exhaustively analyzed.\n\nIL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 ELISA\nTA muscle was dissected and flash-frozen in super-cooled isopentane as described above. The tissues (approximately 50\u201380 mg) were then homogenized using a tissue homogenizer in 0.5 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitors (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, and 10 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin). Protein concentrations were determined using a DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The concentrations of rat IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 protein were measured by ELISA (DuoSet, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).\n\nWestern blotting\nMuscle homogenates (n=3\u20134 for each group) were prepared as describe above and loaded into wells of a 10% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane and incubated with anti-GFAP (1:500, mouse monoclonal, Covance, Princeton, NJ) and anti-GAPDH antibodies (1:5,000, rabbit monoclonal, Cell Signaling Technology Inc,, Danvers, MA). Following secondary incubation with horse anti-mouse peroxidase-tagged antibody (1:5000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and incubation with enhanced chemiluminescence incubation (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL), the membrane was exposed to film. The protein band signals on the film were scanned and densitometrically analyzed using ImageJ 1.42q software.\n\nEx vivo\nGDNF delivery in SOD1\nG93A\nrats\nPreparation of hMSCs expressing GDNF (hMSC-GDNF) and intramuscular transplantation of hMSCs in SOD1\nG93A\nrats were performed as described previously (\nKrakora et al., 2013\n;\nSuzuki et al., 2008\n). Briefly, hMSC-GDNF were prepared by lentiviral infection for constitutive expression of human GDNF (\nKrakora et al., 2013\n;\nSuzuki et al., 2008\n). Pre-symptomatic female SOD1\nG93A\nrats (90 days old; n = 4\u20135 animals/group) were administered intramuscular injections of a local anesthetic, bupivacaine hydrochloride (BVC; Sensorcaine-MPF, AstraZeneca, London, UK), to induce focal muscle injury and enhance hMSC integration and survival in the limb muscle prior to transplantation (\nKrakora et al., 2013\n;\nSuzuki et al., 2008\n). BVC was injected unilaterally into the TA muscle. At time-points of 24 hours, 1 week, and 2 weeks after the BVC injection, wild-type hMSC (hMSC-WT) or hMSC-GDNF (150,000 cells in 50 \u03bcl) were injected into the same muscle. All animals were immunosuppressed with cyclosporine which was necessary to prevent rejection of the transplanted hMSCs (10 mg/kg/day, Sandimmun; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) (\nBorel et al., 1994\n). The animals were sacrificed at symptomatic stage (\u2245153 days old or 9 weeks after the first hMSC injection). The muscle sections were prepared as described above.\n\nStatistical analysis\nPrizm software (Graphpad software Inc., La Jolla, CA) was used for all statistical analyses. All ELISA data were analyzed by one-way functional ANOVA using Newman-Keuls\npost hoc\ntest. Differences were considered significant when P<0.05."

Mice were weaned at 4 weeks of age and fed standard chow. Male mice were used in all experiments. All data were collected at 20\u201324 weeks of age.\nMice were housed in a pathogen-free environment. All protocols and procedures were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Animals (UCUCA; approval number PRO00003694), and are in compliance with University guidelines, State and Federal regulations, and the standards of the \u201cGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\u201d The University\u2019s Animal Welfare Assurance Number on file with NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) is A3114-01, and the University is accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC, Intl.).\n\nPhenotypic measures\nBody weights were monitored monthly using a standard laboratory scale. Fasting blood glucose levels were obtained using a standard Glucometer (One Touch Ultra, Milpitas, CA) per our previously published protocol (\nVincent et al., 2009\n). Plasma insulin levels were also measured per our previously published protocol (\nHinder et al., 2013\n;\nVincent et al., 2009\n).\n\nTissue Preparation\nThe mice were euthanized according to our published protocols (\nKim et al., 2011b\n) with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital. The hippocampus was dissected from each hemisphere and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use for western immunoblotting.\n\nHuman Hippocampal Neurons\nPrimary Human Hippocampal Neurons (NEURALSTEM INC., Rockville, MD) are a human neural stem cell line of hippocampal origin that has been conditionally immortalized with cMyc-ER. Hippocampal neurons are maintained in N2b medium containing 1 \u03bcg/ml fibronectin and 10 \u03bcg/ml bFGF growth supplement, with fresh media given every other day. To exclude the effect of insulin, the culture medium is changed to treatment media (NSDM-1 without insulin) 24 hr before experimentation. ER stress is pharmacologically induced in the hippocampal neurons with the addition of 5 nM thapsigargin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in DMSO for 2\u201348 hr. Hippocampal neurons were lysed in RIPA buffer (Pierce, Rockford, IL) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use for western blotting.\n\nWestern Immunoblotting\nWestern immunoblotting was performed as previously described (\nKim et al., 2011a\n;\nKim et al., 2011b\n). The hippocampus was homogenized in tissue protein extraction reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 supplemented with either 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or 5% milk was used to block the membrane and to dilute the antibodies. Polyclonal antibodies against phospho-JNK, XBP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, INC., Santa Cruz, CA), BiP (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), pIRS1 serine 307, IRS1 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphoate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; EMD Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts) were used for western immunoblotting. The signal was visualized using LumiGLO enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Images were captured using the Chemidoc XRS system and analyzed by Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratory, Hercules, CA).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nData analyses were performed using Prism, version 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Assumptions about Gaussian distribution of data were made using the D\u2019Agostino & Pearson omnibus normality test. At least 8 mice per group were used for metabolic studies. For all other measures at least 5 mice per group were used. T-test was used to compare control versus HF, ApoE/ob+ versus ApoE 3KO, or LDLR/ob+ versus LDLR 3KO. For all experiments, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, #p<0.001, \u03a6p<0.0001, and bar graphs illustrate the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), while cell culture supplies were purchased from Invitrogen Corporation (Carlsbad, CA) unless specified.\n\nBMEC cultures and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)\nMouse BMECs were prepared as previously described (\nYin et al., 2002b\n). Briefly, mouse cerebral cortex from adult male C57BL/6J mice (male, body weight 25-30g, 3-4 months-old) (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) was homogenized, filtered and sequentially digested with collagenase B, then collagenase/dispase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), followed by centrifugation in 40% Percoll solution. The second band containing microvessels was collected and plated onto collagen-coated dishes. Mouse BMECs (1-5 passages, > 95% purity based on expression of factor VIII and exhibiting bradykinin receptor function) were grown to 85-95% confluency before use (\nYin et al., 2002b\n).\nTo mimic ischemic-like conditions\nin vitro\n, cell cultures were exposed to OGD for a fixed time (\nYin et al., 2002a\n). Briefly, mouse BMEC cultures were transferred into a temperature controlled (37\u00b11\u00b0C) anaerobic chamber (Forma Scientific, Marietta, OH) containing a gas mixture composed of 5% CO\n2\nand 95% N\n2\n. The culture medium was replaced with deoxygenated glucose-free Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salt Solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and cells were maintained in the hypoxic chamber for 16 h. Control mouse BMECs were not exposed to OGD.\n\nRNA sequencing and Bioinformatics analysis\nRNA was extracted from cultured BMECs by using a miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Eluted RNA was prepared for sequencing using Illumina protocols, and then sequenced on the HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) to generate 50 bp paired-end reads. We obtained about 41.4~59.1M reads for each sample (four independent biological replicates per group). The reads were aligned to the mouse genome (from UCSC Genome Browser) using Bowtie2 (2.1.0) (\nLangmead et al., 2009\n) with Tophat (2.0.8b) (\nTrapnell et al., 2009\n). We used Cufflinks to first assemble transcripts from all datasets using the NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq) mouse gene annotation as a reference guide. All mouse XenoRefSeq annotations that overlapped with the unannotated transcripts were identified. Nonoverlapping transcripts were assessed for protein-coding potential using PhyloCSF (\nLin et al., 2011\n). Using a threshold previously used to identify non-coding RNAs, all multi-exonic transcripts with a PhyloCSF score >20 were called novel protein-coding transcripts and <20 as lncRNAs (\nLeung et al., 2013\n;\nLin et al., 2011\n;\nPauli et al., 2012\n). FPKM values were calculated for expression levels of each transcript. To assess the biological reproducibility between the replicates for each condition, Pearson's Correlation value was also determined for each pair of replicates. Cuffdiff (\nTrapnell et al., 2010\n) was used to identify differentially expressed transcripts in two conditions with the reference annotation containing mouse RefSeq genes and lncRNAs with an FPKM >0.5.\nHierarchical cluster analysis was performed on normalized array values with Cluster 3.0 with Euclidean distance and single linkage for >10,000 genes and average linkage for smaller gene sets. Heatmaps were generated with Java TreeView. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was completed using GO Elite with default settings.\nTo assess the significance of the proximity of co-regulated lncRNAs and protein-coding genes, we carried out 100,000 simulations of proximity measurements on randomly placed co-regulated lncRNAs and protein-coding genes in the mouse genome (\nLeung et al., 2013\n;\nLin et al., 2011\n;\nPauli et al., 2012\n). We analyzed 4,301 coding genes and 362 lncRNAs to be co-regulated and then counted the number of simulated OGD-responsive lncRNAs within 500kb of a simulated OGD-responsive gene.\n\nPromoter analysis of transcription factor binding sites\nAs transcription factors are crucial in the process of transcription of non-coding RNAs, we checked and analyzed the promoter region of OGD-responsive lncRNA genes for the identification of conserved transcription factor binding sites. For each lncRNA, a 2-kb promoter sequence upstream to the transcription start site was analyzed for conserved TF binding sites by using the Genomatix Software. All TF matrices with a Z-score of >2 (representing P>0.05) were considered statistically significant (\nDharap et al., 2011\n).\n\nMouse model of transient focal cerebral ischemia\nMale C57BL/6J mice (male, 8- to 10-weeks-old) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using a nylon monofilament suture as described previously (\nYin et al., 2010a\n;\nYin et al., 2011\n;\nYin et al., 2010b\n;\nYin et al., 2013a\n). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100mg/kg) and xylazine (10mg/kg). After a midline skin incision, the left common carotid artery was exposed and then its branches were electrocoagulated. A 2-cm length of 6-0 rounded tip nylon suture was gently advanced from the external carotid artery up to the internal carotid artery until regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was reduced to less than 16% of baseline. After 60 minutes of proximal MCA occlusion, blood flow was restored by removing the suture. Changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) at the surface of the cortex were recorded using a laser-Doppler flowmetry monitor (BPM2 System, Vasamedic, St. Paul, MN). Sham control animals were subjected to similar operations to expose the carotid arteries without occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. After 60 minutes of MCAO, the mice were allowed to recover for 24 hours. Arterial blood gases, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate were also monitored in selected animals 30 min before, during, and 30 min after MCAO. The rectal temperature was controlled at 37.0 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C during surgery with a feedback-regulated heating pad (Harvard, Holliston, MA). After the ischemic insult, mice were kept in an air-ventilated incubator at 24.0 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C. The animals were sacrificed at 24 h of reperfusion, and the brains were quickly removed for biochemical assays as well as infarct determination. All procedures using laboratory animals were approved by the University of Michigan Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nCerebral microvessel isolation\nCerebral microvessel isolation employed previously described methods with modifications (Pardridge et al., 1985; Zlokovic et al., 1993; (\nYin et al., 2010a\n;\nYin et al., 2006b\n). Briefly, mice were sacrificed by decapitation under anesthesia. The brains were immediately removed from the skull and immersed in ice-cold buffer A (103 mM NaCl, 4.7mM KC1, 2.5 mM CaC1\n2\n, 1.2 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.2 mM MgSO\n4\n, 15 mM Hepes, pH 7.4). The brain was homogenized in a 5-fold volume excess of buffer B (103 mM NaCl, 4.7mM KC1, 2.5 mM CaC1\n2\n, 1.2 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.2 mM MgSO\n4\n, 15 mM Hepes, 25 mM HCO\n3\n, 10 mM glucose, 1mM sodium pyruvate, and 1 g/100 ml dextran pH 7.4) with a Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was suspended in an equal volume of 25% BSA and was centrifuged at 5,800 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer B and passed over an 85-\u03bcm nylon mesh (Tetko, Depu, NY). This filtrate was then passed over a 3 \u00d7 4-cm glass bead column (0.45-mm glass beads) with a 44-\u03bcm nylon mesh at the bottom, and then washed with 400 ml of buffer B. Microvessels adhered to the glass beads while contaminants passed unimpeded. Microvessels were recovered by repeated gentle agitation of the glass beads in buffer B. The supernatant with microvessels was decanted and spun at 500 \u00d7 g for 5 min, and the final pellet was stored at \u221280\u00b0C until various biochemical assays were performed.\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR\nTotal RNA was isolated from BMEC cultures or isolated cerebral microvessels by using a miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or Trizol (Invitrogen). A quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out with a Bio-Rad thermocycler and an SYBR green kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Specific lncRNA primers used for the reaction are listed in\nSupplemental Table 1\n. The relative lncRNA expression was normalized by 18S RNA levels. The PCR experiments were repeated 3 times, each using separate sets of cultures (\nYin et al., 2006a\n;\nYin et al., 2006b\n).\n\nImmunofluorescence staining\nMouse BMECs grown on coverslips were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and washed 3 times with 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4). The cells were incubated with a primary rat anti-CD31 antibody (1:50; BD Bioscience), mouse anti-Claudin 5 (1:50; Invitrogen), or mouse anti-Occludin antibody (1:50; Invitrogen) overnight at 4\u00b0C. On the following day, the cells were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-rat or anti-mouse IgG (1:100; Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h. BMECs were counterstained with 1 \u03bcg/ml of DAPI (Molecular Probes; Eugene, OR) to visualize nuclear morphology. Slides were washed, wet mounted and examined with an Olympus fluorescence microscope (\nYin et al., 2006a\n;\nYin et al., 2002b\n).\n\nQuantitative and Statistical analysis\nQuantitative data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD or SEM based on at least three independent experiments of triplicate samples. Differences among groups were statistically analyzed by oneway analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc test. Comparison between two experimental groups was based on a two-tailed t-test. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Immortalized patient-derived lymphocytes\nPrimary lymphocytes (B-cells) were isolated from blood of consenting individuals within our\nC9orf72\n-ALS patient population under IRB approved protocols at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Culturing and immortalization was performed using standard methods\n36\n,\n37\n. Immortalized control lymphocytes from an individual with Fragile X syndrome were obtained from the Coriell Institute Biorepository (GM09237).\n\nBrain samples\nProtocols were approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee on human experimentation. All participants or authorized family members gave written informed consent after which autopsies were performed at Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville. Postmortem analyses were conducted to confirm pathological diagnosis of FTLD, and genetic analyses confirmed a\nC9orf72\nrepeat expansion in each case included in this study. 50\u2013100mg of frozen human postmortem brain tissues were sampled from the hippocampus of each cases, after which DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit\u00ae (Qiagen #51306) as per manufacturers' instructions.\n\nReprogramming of immortalized lymphocytes\nImmortalized lymphocytes were incubated in StemPro-34 medium supplemented with cytokines: SCF (100ng/mL), IL-3 (50ng/mL), and GM-CSF (25ng/mL) for 3 days. Two million cells were electroporated using the Lonza Nucleofector Kit, and 2\u00b5g of episomal plasmids pCXLE-hOCT3/4-shp53-F (Addgene ID 27077), pCXLE-hSK (27078), pCXLE-hUL (27080), and pCDNA3.1-Nanog (28221). Following transfection using the 4D-Nucleofector\u2122 system (program EO-100), cells were seeded on a monolayer of mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells. The next day, medium was replaced with N2B27 medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad CA) for a week before switching to mTeSR medium (Stemcell, Vancouver Canada). Cells were cultured for another two weeks; emerging colonies were manually picked and expanded on feeder-free Matrigel\u00ae coated plates (Corning Life Sciences, Corning NY).\n\nMotor neuron differentiation\nMotor neurons were differentiated according to our previously published methods\n35\n. Briefly, iPSC colonies were cultured in neural stem cell medium on ultra-low attachment flasks. After neural precursor sphere formation, cells were plated on poly-L-ornithine/laminin coated plates and maintained with neuronal induction medium for at least one month to obtain terminally differentiated motor neurons.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nCells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and blocked using a buffer (PBS, 1% BSA, 0.02% sodium Azide) containing goat serum (20%). For detection of intracellular markers, cells were permeabilized with Triton-x100 (0.03%) for 1 hour and incubated with primary antibodies Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, TRA-1-81 SSEA4 (Cell Signalling Technology 9656), Nestin (Abcam ab6142), Tuj1 (Sigma-Aldrich T8578) and Isl1 (Millipore Ab4326) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The next day, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies (1:1000) for 2 hours at room temperature. Cells were counter stained with DAPI for 30 minutes and observed by fluorescent microscopy.\n\nViral preparation and transduction\nViral packaging was performed in LentiX293 cells (Clontech 632180) following transfection with the Lenti-HB9-GFP (Addgene ID 37080) construct and lentiviral packaging plasmids psPAX2 (12259) and pCMV delta R8.2 (12263). Viral preparations were concentrated using LentiX concentrator (Clontech 631231) and tittered by qPCR. Patient-derived neuronal cultures were transduced at a MOI of 5 in the presence of 2\u00b5g/mL polybrene. Cells expressing GFP were visualized 10 days after transduction by fluorescent microscopy.\n\nC9orf72\nrepeat expansion assessment\nFor assessment of the\nC9orf72\nhexanucelotide repeat expansion, we used a repeat-primed PCR assay in the presence of 5% dimethyl sulfoxide and complete substitution of 7-deaza-2-deoxy GTP for dGTP as previously reported\n1\n. PCR fragments were analyzed using ABI3730 DNA Analyzer and GeneMapper software. To determine the accurate sizing of an expanded allele, Southern Blot analysis was performed using methods previously reported\n38\n. Briefly, 10 \u00b5g of genomic DNA was digested with XbaI and electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose gel followed by DNA transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane. Hybridization was performed using digoxygenin-labelled probe, followed by detection via anti-digoxygenin antibody and visualization with CDP-star substrate on autoradiograpgy film.\n\nMethylation-sensitive quantitative PCR\nLevels of\nC9orf72\npromoter methylation were assessed by methylation-sensitive restriction digest followed by qPCR as we previously reported\n35\n. At each stage of reprogramming and neuronal specification, genomic DNA was extracted from cells and quantified by spectrophotometry. 100 ng of DNA was used for methylation-sensitive restriction digest with the Hha1 endonuclease. Two sets of primers within the\nC9orf72\npromoter were used: C9me (L/R: 5\u2019CGGTAAAAACAAAATTTCATCCA / 5\u2019GGGCAACTTGTCCTGTTCTT) spans two Hha1 restriction sites, and C9ec (L/R: 5\u2019AGGAAAGAGAGGTGCGTCAA / 5\u2019TCCTAAACCCACACCTGCTC) that is in close proximity to C9me but does not span HhaI sites and is used as an endogenous control.\n\nBisulfite pyrosequencing\nGenomic DNA (2\u00b5g) was subjected to bisulfite conversion and analyzed by pyrosequencing (EpigenDx Inc.) to assess\nC9orf72\npromoter methylation levels. The analysis was performed using the PSQTM96HS system and custom designed primers developed by EpigenDx (ADS3232-FS1, ADS3232-FS2 and ADS3233-FS1). The assay covers 18 CpG dinucleotides within the promoter and 5\u2032 untranslated region of\nC9orf72\nfrom \u2212254 to +125 relative to the transcriptional start site of the human genomic sequence (GRCh38:\nCM000671.2\n/Chr9(\u2212)).\n\n5-hydroxymethylcytosine assessment\nFor relative quantification of 5hmC and 5mC levels, we utilized the EpiMark\u00ae 5-hmC and 5-mC Analysis Kit (New England Biolabs E3317), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, 5\u00b5g of genomic DNA was used for glucosylation. Converted DNA was then subjected to restriction digest with MspI or HpaII endonucleases for 8 hours at 37\u00b0C and then amplified by qPCR using the C9ec primer set (sequence above) and C9epimark primer set (L/R: 5\u2019AAATTGCGATGACTTTGCAG / 5\u2019ACTGCAAACCCTGGTAGG), which span one CCGG MspI/HpaII recognition site.\n\nQuantitative PCR\nReactions were performed using TaqMan\u00ae assays for Lin28 (Hs00702808_s1), Nanog (Hs04260366_g1), beta-III-tubulin (Hs00801390_s1), HB9 (Hs00907365_m1), ISL1 (Hs00158126_m1), and GAPDH (Hs02758991_g1). For EBV gene expression SYBR green qPCR, EBNA-1 primers (L/R: 5\u2019ATCGTCAAAGCTGCACACAG / 5\u2019CCCAGGAGTCCCAGTAGTCA) and GAPDH primers (L/R: 5\u2019GGCTGTGGGCAAGGTCATCCCTGA / 5\u2019TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA) were designed. For visualization, PCR products were run on 2% agarose gel."

    "Methods": "Animals\nTwenty-four Sprague Dawley adult female rats (180g\u2013200g, Harlan) were used, twelve for the viral tracing study and the other twelve for the classification of neurotransmitter phenotype. Animals were divided into three groups, receiving either sham injuries or complete spinal transections with or without GDNF treatment. Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Indiana University School of Medicine in accordance with the NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.\n\nViral and Fluoro-Gold (FG) retrograde tracing\nRats were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of a ketamine (40\u201395 mg/kg)/xylazine (5\u201310 mg/kg) cocktail. A laminectomy was performed to expose the 2\nnd\nlumbar (L2) spinal cord. The dura was cut using a 26G needle to expose the spinal cord. Mutant monosynaptic rabies virus Rb-B19-\u0394G-GFP (purchased from Salk Institute) was bilaterally injected into the intermediate gray matter (laminae V \u2013 VIII) of the L2 spinal cord (0.75\u03bcl/side, 10\u22279TU/ml) using a stereotaxic apparatus. The virus was transformed into a first-order retrograde tracer instead of a trans-synaptic one (\nWickersham et al., 2007\n). In our study, the dPSNs labeled by this G-mutated rabies virus include only those directly projecting to the intermediate zone of the L2 lumbar cord. The injection procedure lasted for 5 minutes including leaving the needle in place for 1 minute prior to retraction to limit leakage. For FG labeling, 2% FG (Sigma 39286, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was injected into the L2 spinal cord (0.75\u03bcl/side) with the same stereotaxic parameters (\nFig. 1\n).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Schematic diagram of the descending propriospinal tract system (dPST). dPST pathways descending several spinal segments are located in both the ventral and ventral lateral funiculi (VF and VLF, respectively). The dPST projects through either contralateral or ipsilateral VF or VLF and innervates motoneuron pools directly or indirectly through interneurons. dPST neurons receive convergent supraspinal innervation, including those from the corticospinal (CST) and rubrospinal (RST) tracts. Descending propriospinal neurons are indicated in green, interneurons in brown and motoneurons in purple. (B, C) Schematic diagrams of the experimental designs for the dendritic morphology study (B) and the neurotransmitter study (C). The three figures in each panel, from left to right, show propriospinal neurons were first retrogradely infected by a G-mutated rabies virus (green particles) that expressed green fluorescence protein which filled the dendritic compartments of dPST neurons (B) or retrogradely labeled by FluoroGold (FG) (blue particles) (C). Spinal cords then received either a transection injury or a transection + glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (red dots) applied to the lesion site to be retrogradely transported to the soma.\n\nSpinal Transection\nThree days after viral or tracer injections, the animals in the experimental groups were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine. A laminectomy was performed to expose the 11\nth\nthoracic (T11) spinal cord. A pair of iridectomy scissors (Fine Scientific Tools, Foster City, CA) was used to transect the spinal cord. Successful transection was judged after exposure of the rostral and caudal stumps of the retracted spinal cords. Following transection, a probe was scraped along the inner wall of the vertebral canal through the lesion site to further ensure a complete spinal cord transection (\nCoulon et al., 2011\n). After bleeding in the lesion gap was stopped, gelfoam containing either 0.01M PBS or PBS containing GDNF (3 \u03bcg/\u03bcl) was placed into the lesion gap (\nFig. 1\n). Sham animals received a laminectomy at the T11 level without spinal cord transection.\n\nPost-Operative Care\nFollowing each surgical procedure, the musculature was closed with 3.0 silk, and the skin was closed with 3.0 Nylon suture. External sutures were removed after the first week post-operatively. Buprenorphine hydrochloride (Buprenex injectable, 0.03 cc SQ,, Ben Venue Laboratories Inc., Bedford, OH) was given twice daily for the first 48 hours post-surgery. They also underwent bladder expression until sacrifice to prevent urinary tract infection.\n\nTissue processing, Imaging and 3D reconstruction of viral labeled dPSNs\nFour days after transection injury, animals were anesthetized using a ketamine/xylazine mixture and were perfused with cold PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The whole spinal cord was carefully removed from the vertebral spine. Continuous sections of T6-T10 spinal cord segment were transversely sectioned at 150 \u03bcm thickness with a vibratome.\nLabeled cells from all sections of the T6\u201310 cord segments were examined under a two-photon laser scanning microscope (Prairie Technologies, Middleton, WI) with 910 nm excitation light. Sections with completely labeled neurons were selected for further imaging. Stacks of images were collected by using a 20 \u00d7 water immersion lens and an increment of 1 \u03bcm. Initially, each stack of images was projected and saved as a .tif format; montage stack images of individual neurons were then created. The morphology of labeled cells in the stack images was reconstructed with Neurolucida (MBF Bioscience, Colchester, VT).\n\nCriteria for classification of dPSNs\nOur analysis was restricted to dPSNs from T6 to T10 spinal cord segments with axonal projections to the L2 spinal cord segment. Only those neurons whose somata were located in the intermediate gray matter (Rexed Lamina VII) were included. Each neuron was analyzed with respect to a coordinate system. The orientation of dendrites was defined as medial (close to the central canal), lateral (far from the central canal), ventral (close to the anterior horn), and dorsal (close to the posterior horn). Accordingly, the XY-plane is the transverse plane of the spinal cord, the YZ-plan is the parasagittal plane, and the XZ-plane is the horizontal plane (\nFig.2\n). Dendrites that could not be traced back to their soma were excluded. Neurons with incomplete dendritic trees were also excluded. Only neurons with labeled somata and more than 90% dendritic trees were considered complete cells and selected for final analysis.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nCamera lucida reconstructions of three propriospinal neurons (rows A, B, C) with different dendritic patterns as if viewed in the transverse (D), parasagittal (E), and horizontal (F) planes. Row A shows a dPSN that extended its dendritic branches in medial, lateral, ventral and dorsal directions. Row B shows a dPSN that extended its dendritic branches predominantly in medial and lateral directions. Row C shows a dPSN that has more dendritic branches extending in ventral and dorsal directions. Scale bar: 100\u03bcm.\n\nQuantitative morphometry\nMorphometric parameters were extracted with the Neurolucida analysis tool NeuroExplorer. To quantify the percentage of dendritic distribution in different orientations, we divided the spinal regions around each individual neuron into four quadrants and defined these quadrants as lateral (320\u00b0~50\u00b0), dorsal (50\u00b0~140\u00b0), medial (140\u00b0~230\u00b0) and ventral (230\u00b0~320\u00b0). The percentage of dendritic profiles appearing in these areas was calculated. To estimate the surface area of the three-dimensional cell bodies, the perimeter of each soma was first traced from its two-dimensional image. Then, by applying the formula for the surface area of an ellipsoid to the perimeter and two dimensional area measurements, the three-dimensional surface volume was calculated.\n\nNeurotransmitter immunohistochemistry\nTo determine the transmitter phenotype of dPSNs, we performed experiments with FG retrograde labeling combined with immunohistochemistry. Four days after transection injury, animals received a lethal dose of ketamine/xylazine and were perfused transcardially with a fixation solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. T7\u20139 spinal cords were removed from the spines and cryocut into 20-\u03bcm thick transverse sections. We collected sections at every 100 \u03bcm interval as a set for each neurotransmitter staining. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies raised against protein-conjugated amino acid neurotransmitters (anti-glutamate, G9282, 1:10,000, Sigma-Aldrich; anti-GABA, A2052, 1:5,000, Sigma-Aldrich; anti-glycine, 1:2,000, AB139, Chemicon, Temecula, CA; Millipore anti-Choline acetyltransferase, 1:100, AB144P, Chemicon) producing staining of distinct cellular populations. After incubating spinal cord sections with the primary antibody or antibodies for 48 hours, secondary antibodies matching the species of the primary antibody and labeled either with Cy3 (ab6939 Abcam MA) or Alexa Fluor 488 (A-11001 Life Technologies, NY) were employed to visualize their binding sites. To test the specificity of the primary antibody, they were omitted from control sections and no immunoreactivity was detected.\n\nQuantification of neuronal transmitter phenotype\nPatterns of staining were visualized under a fluorescence microscope using appropriate fluorescence filter sets. Counting of neuronal cell bodies was performed by a blind observer using Image J software. All results were based on four different animals on one set of sections per animal for each molecular marker and tracer. Counting fields were not allowed to approach the margins of the analyzed spinal cord regions to minimize inaccuracies due to edge effects that are likely to increase by difficult-to-discern cell types at their borders. Counting was done under high magnification objectives (20x). By focusing through the sections, marker and tracer co-localization was readily distinguished from stained elements at different depths. The numbers of cells stained for selected markers were counted and averaged for each combination of staining across all analyzed sections and experiments. Each set of section was stained for each different neurotransmitter. Neuron was selected only from intermediate grey matter. Quantitative analysis was based on the number of each section (n) through the caudal-rostral extent of the analyzed. In each set, percentage of dPSN neurons with specific neurotransmitter = the number of neurons co-labeled by FG and neurotransmitter antibody in this set /total number of neurons labeled by FG in this set.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll numerical data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Due to the non-Gaussian distribution of morphology, the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine the significance of group effect. One way ANOVA with Post hoc Tukey\u2019s test was performed to determine the effect of injury and GDNF treatment on other dendritic parameters. Two-way ANOVA was performed to determine the effect of either the factor of spinal cord level or the factor of injury/GDNF treatment (sham vs. injury vs. GDNF) independently or their possible interaction on neurotransmitter distribution. Post hoc Bonferroni\u2019s test was performed to compare means between groups. Significance was set at the 95% confidence interval."

    "Methods": "2.1. Experiment protocol\nResting state fMRI data were acquired on a 7 Tesla Bruker MRI from adult rats (n = 15) under medetomidine sedation before and at 7, 14 and 28 days after brain injury using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI.\n\n2.2. Brain injury\nAll study protocols were approved by the University of California Los Angeles Chancellor's Animal Research Committee and adhered to the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The method for induction of moderate CCI injury was performed in the manner similar to previously described.(\nChen et al., 2002\n,\n2003\n,\n2004\n;\nHarris et al., 2010a\n,\nb\n,\n2012\n) Briefly, male, Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (220\u2013250 g body weight) were anesthetized with 2% isofluorane vaporized in O\n2\nflowing at 0.8 L/min and placed on a homeostatic temperature-controlled blanket while maintained in a stereotactic frame. CCI injury was produced using a 4 mm diameter impactor tip that was advanced through a 5 mm craniotomy (centered at 0.0 mm Bregma and 3 mm left-lateral to the sagittal suture) onto the brain using a 20 psi pressure pulse, and to a deformation depth of 2 mm below the dura. The craniotomy site was covered with a nontoxic, rapid curing silicone elastomer (WP Instruments, USA) and the wound was closed with sutures.\n\n2.3. MRI acquisition\nRats were briefly anesthetized with 4% isofluorane in oxygen flowing at 0.6 l/min in order to administer medetomidine sedation (0.05 mg/kg in sterile saline, (\nWilliams et al., 2010\n)) via the penile vein. Following placement of a subcutaneous cannula and initiation of continuous infusion of medetomidine (0.1 mg/kg/h), the rat was transferred to a purpose-built cradle and secured using three-point immobilization of the head with two ear bars and a tooth bar. Given the time-dependent effects of isoflurane on spontaneous bold fluctuations(\nMagnuson et al., 2014b\n), total exposure to isoflurane was minimized to 5\u201310 min after which the isoflurane was discontinued and the rat cradle was placed in the center of a 7 T magnet (Oxford Instr, Carteret, NJ, USA) spectrometer driven by a Bruker console running Paravision 5.1 (Billerica, MA USA). Respiration was monitored remotely and temperature was homoeothermically-controlled by forced air (SA11 Instr, Inc., USA). The S116 Bruker gradients (400 mT/m) were used in combination with a birdcage transmit and an actively decoupled receive-only surface coil to acquire the data. Following a multi-slice, gradient echo pilot scan to optimize positioning within the magnet, localized shimming was performed on the head to improve B0 homogeneity. A standard, single shot, gradient echo, echo planar imaging sequence was used to acquire 600 volumes (20 min) of resting state fMRI data. Images were acquired with a 128-read by 64-phase-encoding matrix (X,Y direction respectively) within a 30 mm\n2\nfield-of-view and 14 \u00d7 0.75 mm contiguous, coronal slices, using a repetition/echo time TR/TE) of 2000/35 ms and 10 dummy scans prior to the acquisition. Anatomical, T2-weighted, Rapid-Relaxation-with-Enhancement (RARE) data were then acquired using the same image resolution, at the same anatomical coordinates and using similar acquisition parameters except the following: matrix size \u2014 128 \u00d7 128, TR/TE = 5000/ 60 ms, RARE factor 8, and 2 averages. Animals were recovered after imaging by reversing the sedation with Atipamezol (1 mg/kg, i.p.)\n\n2.4. Data analysis\nrsfMRI Data were weighted Fourier transformed to 128 \u00d7 128 and converted to compressed NIFTI format after which they were preprocessed (\nFig. 1\n) for motion correction to generate nuisance parameters and then brain extracted (\nSmith, 2002\n). Contusion injury results in the formation of a CSF-filled cavity over the first few days post-injury in this model and inclusion of data from this region was prevented in two ways: (1) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal was sampled in 2\u20134 voxels/slice within 2 slices per brain using ROI's delineated on the anatomical T2 data. The voxel-averaged signal was determined over the entire rsfMRI time-course and regressed out of the data together with the motion correction nuisance parameters using FEAT, part of the FSL toolbox (\nSmith et al., 2004\n) and in accordance with optimal methods for delineating regional signal correlations in the rat (\nKalthoff et al., 2011\n). (2) Adjacency matrix data with zero correlations were removed from each rat brain prior to subsequent analysis to prevent any bias to non-intact brain tissue. Although this invariably results in the representation of contusion core data from the most mildly-injured rats, this did prevent non-intact brain regions from being assessed. The data were then slice-time corrected, Gaussian smoothed to 0.5 mm FWHM and then band-passed filtered at 0.01\u20130.25 Hz. This bandwidth was chosen since it includes the higher frequency blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal components present when under medetomidine sedation (\nPan et al., 2013\n). Finally, data were warped to an anatomical template of the adult rat brain using an implementation of FSL FLIRT(\nJenkinson and Smith, 2001\n;\nJenkinson et al., 2002\n) adapted for the rat (\nCrum et al., 2013\n). The atlas was constructed by co-registering a parcellated cortical atlas (\nVald\u00e9s-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2011\n) with subcortical structures (\nhttps://www.nitrc.org/projects/dti_rat_atlas/\n) together with numerous other structures from our in-house atlas which itself was manually constructed in 3-dimensions using Itksnap (\nYushkevich et al., 2006\n) with reference to a 2-dimensional atlas (\nPaxinos and Watson, 1997\n). The final atlas consisted of 148 individual, parcellated regions.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nNetwork analysis pipeline used for rodent brain.\nWe elected not to analyze regions posterior to Bregma \u22124.16 mm because the signal distortion around the ear canals that occurs when using a gradient echo, echo planar sequence prevents accurate warping of the posterior brain to a template. As a result, functional adjacency matrices were calculated from the time-series rsfMRI data using just 96 brain regions to obtain correlation coefficients that were then z-transformed. Given the controversy over anti-correlated networks and the fact that their existence varies with anesthetic state (\nLiang et al., 2012\n), we elected to investigate only positive correlations. We used graph theory parameters which were computed using the Brain Connectivity Tool Box (\nRubinov and Sporns, 2010\n) and statistical analysis implemented in Matlab Statistical Toolbox (The Mathworks, Natick. MA) with display using Brainnet viewer (\nXia et al., 2013\n) and Brainsuite software (\nShattuck and Leahy, 2002\n).\nWe used the undirected, weighted, functional connectivity matrices to investigate theoretical measures of global and regional connectivity. The choice of weighted over binary network analysis was made based on the assumption that injury results in both increases and decreases in a whole host of anatomical and functional changes. Such changes could include axonal and dendrite sprouting, changes in synaptic number and function, alterations in receptor binding potentials, and cell excitability, to name a few. As a result, regional functional disconnection would unlikely be an all-or-nothing, binary phenomena modeled at a particular connection threshold, rather it is likely a result of a change in degree of connectedness or connection strength that can only be modeled through a weighted network analysis. We measured: (1) connection strength \u2014 the sum of the weighted edges connected to each node. (2) Characteristic shortest path length (CPL) \u2014 the average shortest number of weighted edges connecting between any two nodes in the brain. (3) Global efficiency (EGLOB) \u2014 the grand mean of the inverse distance across all nodes in the brain, which provides an indication of global integration of information across the brain globally in parallel. (4) Mean and regional local efficiency (MELOC and EREG respectively) \u2014 the regional local subnet mean and grand local mean, respectively of the inverse distance across all nodes in the brain or local subnet which provides an indication of local integration of information across the brain locally. (5) Mean clustering coefficient (MCC) \u2014 the ratio of connected neighboring nodes among all first-degree neighbors of a given node \u2014 an indication of the local connectivity for integration of information. (6) Modularity (Q) \u2014 the degree to which a network is organized into distinct communities of nodes with high intramodular and low intermodular connectivity, was determined by averaging over 100 iterations of the algorithm to account for random differences in module assignments from between run. (7) Betweeness centrality \u2014 the fraction of shortest paths that traverse an edge or node, and indication of the relative importance of a pathway. (8) Normalized CPL (lambda) and (9) normalized CC (gamma) were computed from the average comparison of each rat brain network with one hundred random networks containing a similar number of nodes, edges and network connectivity. (10) Small worldness \u2014 the ratio of gamma to lambda where a value greater than 1 indicates the network property of high local connectedness while maintaining a relatively low CPL. Contusion volume at 28 days post-injury was estimated from the T2-weighted, anatomical data by summing the volume of the ipsilateral cortical voxels with a greyscale intensity greater than 2 standard deviations above the mean intensity of the cortical gray matter of the hemisphere opposite the primary injury site.\n\n2.5. Statistics\nFor the global parameter analysis we used a 2-tailed t test for determination of group difference at P < 0.05. Given that we a had no a priori information to inform on which network density would be useful in assessing any injury-related change, we elected not to perform statistical corrections for multi-level network density analysis. The intent was to use this as an initial, exploratory approach from which to focus on differences in connectivity at a regional level using more robust statistics. Group differences in regional node and edge analyses were tested for using 2-tailed t tests at P < 0.05 but corrected for multiple nodal comparisons using the false discovery rate at q = 0.05 and 0.005, for node and edge data respectively based on the number of potential comparisons."

Behavioral testing was performed during the dark phase of the light cycle under controlled red lighting. Animal use was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Cleveland Clinic.\n\nMicroelectrode Array (MEA) Implantation\nEach animal was implanted unilaterally with a single five-electrode tungsten MEA (\nFigure 1\n; Model #385-TU0501-01, Alpha-Omega Engineering, Nazareth, Israel) in the LCN as described previously (\nCooperrider et al., 2014\n), with laterality randomized across animals. Briefly, the dura mater was removed after a small craniectomy and the MEA was advanced with the most medial and anterior electrode of the array targeted to AP: \u221210.8 and ML: \u00b13.6 from bregma and DV: \u22124 from brain surface. A reference screw was placed on the skull, adjacent to the lambda. The implant was secured with dental cement and animals were allowed to recover with food and water\nad libitum\nfor one week before the initiating of behavioral training.\nFigure 1.

Coordinates are anterior/posterior with the compass showing dorsal and medial directions. C) Nissl- and Perls-DAB-stained section showing an electrode in the LCN. The dotted line defines the approximate border of the LCN and red arrows highlight the electrode tract.\n\nBehavioral Testing\nEach animal was trained to perform a reach and grasp task (\nFigure 2\n), which required it to reach through a narrow vertical aperture to retrieve a food pellet (45 mg, TestDiet, St. Louis, MO). The animal was placed into a clear Plexiglass box (25 cm long by 20 cm high by 8 cm wide) with a 12 cm tall, 1 cm wide aperture on one of the narrow walls. A ledge was mounted on the outside of the box, 2 cm from the ground, and centered on the aperture. On this ledge were two small divots used to hold the food pellets, each offset 1 cm from the center of the aperture. This design restricts pellet reaching to a designated forelimb, in this case the limb ipsilateral to the implanted LCN (\nWhishaw and Pellis, 1990\n). An infrared beam (OPB856Z, Optek Technology, Carrollton, TX) with analog input to the recording system was mounted such that the paw would interrupt the beam immediately prior to pellet grasp. After each reach, a pellet was placed in the rear of the box to entice the animal to leave the test region between trials, allowing another pellet to be positioned for retrieval. Rats without any successful grabs after ten days of training with the desired forelimb were excluded from the study. Behavioral training was videotaped (60 frames/sec) and saved for offline analysis. An LED was mounted in the camera\u2019s field of vision and illuminated when the infrared beam was interrupted.\nFigure 2. Video stills depicting key behavioral events for the reach/retrieval task.\nOpen in a new tab\nVideo stills highlight the behavioral markers used to define each phase of task performance. Mean \u00b1 SEM is displayed. The bolded line represents the time frame statistically analyzed following spectral analysis, while behavior outside of the time statistically analyzed is shown with a dotted line.\n\nData Collection\nBehavioral and electrophysiological data were collected for two to three months post implant recovery. Animals performed the task for 15 minutes per session, during which time a wireless headstage (Model TB5653, TBSI, Durham, NC) was attached to the MEA to record LCN LFP activity.\nLFP channels were sampled at 787.8 Hz, amplified (800x), and band-pass filtered (1.2 Hz \u2212 300 Hz). Additional analog inputs were used to synchronize infrared beam interruption. Data were digitized and stored as binary files in Telespike (Alpha-Omega Engineering, Nazareth, Israel) for offline analysis.\n\nBehavioral Analysis\nVideotaped reaching performance was analyzed to classify trials into unsuccessful (MISS) or successful (HIT) retrieval attempts. A HIT was defined as a trial when the rat successfully grasped and consumed the pellet in a single reach. A MISS was defined as an unsuccessful retrieval and included either a failure to grasp the pellet or a dropping of the pellet prior to consumption. Following an unsuccessful reach and grasp, rats may make additional attempts to collect the missed pellet before \u201cresetting\u201d their behavior by retreating to the rear of the testing apparatus. These subsequent attempts were excluded from analysis. Videos were manually parsed and compared with infrared beam signal to acquire time stamps for the beam break and to categorize these time stamps as denoting MISSES or HITS.\nTo determine the mean time at which animals performed each component of the reach/retrieval behavior, a subset of fifty HIT and MISS trials were randomly selected from each animal for analysis. For HIT trials, the video frames that represented movement initiation, beam break, grasp, and consumption were noted. Initiation was defined as the frame in which the rat began to lift its paw to reach. The beam break frame was defined as the first frame showing interruption of the infrared beam, indicated by LED illumination. A grasp was defined as the first occurrence of flexion of the digits around the pellet. Consumption was considered as the first frame when pellet came in contact with the mouth. MISS trials were analyzed by noting the frame when initiation, beam break, failed grasp, the second attempt, and the second grasp occurred. Initiation and beam break were defined the same as for HIT trials. The failed grasp was defined as the frame showing the first flexion of the digits but resulting in an unsuccessful grasp. The second attempt was defined as the frame when the paw began to cross the vertical front wall of the training apparatus following a failed trial. Times for each behavioral marker were averaged across trials per animal and animals then averaged together.\n\nElectrophysiological Analysis\nLFP data were further band-pass filtered (1.2 to 100 Hz) and analyzed using custom Matlab scripts (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Using the infrared beam break as event marker, the data were extracted in 900 ms snippets (\u2212550 to +350 ms) and divided into three epochs: \u2212550 \u2212 \u2212350 ms, \u2212350 ms \u2212 0, and 0 \u2212 350 ms, by electrode. The frequency axis was maintained at 1 Hz per bin. Any trial containing 100 consecutive milliseconds of LFP data beyond 3 standard deviations of the mean or anything beyond 4 standard deviations was eliminated as artifact. The remaining trials\u2019 time series data were separated into HIT or MISS and a median value computed to yield a single time series per animal per trial type by electrode. The time series were then subjected to a time-frequency analysis using complex Morlet wavelets with a time-bandwidth product of 7. This evoked analysis specifically allows for the examination of phase-locked oscillations. LFP data between \u2212550 and \u2212 350 ms before beam break were classified as baseline, as these data represented activity occurring prior to the mean timing of reach behavior initiation (\nFigure 2\n). Each bin was compared to the baseline period to compute the standard deviation (z-score) for each frequency. Thereafter, each animal\u2019s electrodes were averaged together, followed by an overall average of all animals to evaluate if there was sustained predominance of oscillations in any frequency domain across animals. Beta band was defined as 12\u201330 Hz, low gamma as 40\u201350 Hz, and high gamma as 50\u201390 Hz.\n\nStatistics\nThe power within each frequency band of interest was calculated and compared both between trial types (Trial type\u00d7Epoch) and to the baseline period of each trial type (Frequency band\u00d7Epoch) using Two-way repeated measure ANOVAs. Multiple comparisons were corrected using the Holm-Sidak post-hoc test. Video frame times from the behavioral analysis were compared using a paired t-test. Statistics were performed with Graphpad Prism Software (La Jolla, CA) and significance levels set at p<0.05.\nTo determine whether there was a significant difference comparing high- and low-performing days within the same trial type, a non-parametric permutation analysis (\nMaris and Oostenveld, 2007\n) was performed to compare days with performance <50% of the maximal accuracy and >50% maximal accuracy. Evoked responses and their time-frequency spectrograms were computed for each animal for each condition (as above), and compared using parametric t-tests. Time-frequency points that exceeded a t-value corresponding to alpha level of 0.05 were thresholded to form clusters. The largest positive and negative clusters were retained and tested under a permutation distribution. Permutation was performed for each animal by pooling the trials from two conditions in a combined set, followed by random repopulation of conditions. Permutation was only carried out at trial level, not at channel level. The data analysis described above was repeated to identify the largest cluster. This was repeated 1000 times. Using the permutation distribution of the largest cluster statistics, the observed clusters were tested. Monte-Carlo estimates of p-value were computed for each observed cluster. If p<0.05, the cluster was identified as significant.\n\nHistology\nPrior to sacrifice, electrolytic lesions were created at each electrode of the MEA (DC- current, 40\u2013200 uA, 30 s-2 min). After pentobarbital overdose (100 mg/kg), the brain was harvested, submerged in 4% paraformaldehyde for one week, and transferred to 30% sucrose in PBS for an additional 48 hours. 20 um coronal cerebellar sections were cut, mounted, and then stained with Perls DAB (HT20, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 1% cresyl violet. Animals with incorrectly targeted MEAs were excluded from the analysis or used as controls."

    "Methods": "2.1 Reagents\nGoat polyclonal anti-apoE antibody labeled with biotin was purchased from Meridian Life science (Memphis, TN). Mouse monoclonal anti-ABCA1 antibody was purchased from Abcam. Rabbit monoclonal anti-PSD95 antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling. Rabbit polyclonal anti-glutamate receptor (GluR) 1, rabbit polyclonal anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) NR1 subunit (NR1), rabbit monoclonal anti-NMDAR NR2A subunit (NR2A), rabbit polyclonal anti-NMDAR NR2B subunit (NR2B), and mouse monoclonal anti-GluR2 antibodies were purchased from Millipore, and mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b2 actin antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich. Rabbit polyclonal anti-LRP1 antibody was produced in our laboratory (\nLiu et al., 2007\n).\n\n2.2 Animals\nForebrain neuron-specific LRP1 knockout (\nnLrp1\n\u2212/\u2212\n) mice were generated as previously described (\nLiu et al., 2010\n). Briefly, \u03b1CamKII driven Cre recombinase mice were bred with\nLrp1 loxP\nmice. Littermates of male\nnLrp1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice (\nLrp1\nflox/flox\n;\n\u03b1CamKII-\nCre\n+/\u2212\n) or controls (\nLrp1\nflox/flox\n;\n\u03b1CamKII-\nCre\n\u2212/\u2212\n) were used for the analysis at the age of 20-24 months. Bexarotene-containing diet was formulated by impregnating normal chow with bexarotene (Cayman) (800 \u03bcg/g diet; Harlan laboratories). While the mice had\nad libitum\naccess to bexarotene containing diet for 8 weeks, the dose was calculated to be 100 mg/kg/day when mice take on average of 125 g/kg/day of the diet, which is the same dose used in a previous publication (\nBoehm-Cagan and Michaelson, 2014\n;\nCramer et al., 2012\n;\nFitz et al., 2013\n;\nLaClair et al., 2013\n;\nPrice et al., 2013\n;\nTai et al., 2014\n;\nTesseur et al., 2013\n;\nVeeraraghavalu et al., 2013\n). Our preliminary analysis confirmed that the administration of mice with bexarotene-formulated diet (100 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks was needed to sufficiently increase brain apoE levels at 3 months of age (data not shown). After transcardial perfusion with PBS, brain tissues were dissected and one hemisphere of each mouse was kept frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until further analysis. The other hemisphere was fixed in 10% neutralized formalin and used for histological analysis. Blood samples were collected under anesthesia from inferior vena cava before perfusion. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Mayo Clinic and followed the National Institute of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.\n\n2.3 Western blot and densitometry analysis\nSamples were lysed in RIPA (Millipore) containing 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitor (Roche). Protein concentration was measured in each sample using a protein assay kit from Bio-Rad. An equal amount of protein from each sample was used for SDS-PAGE. The immunoreactivity was detected and quantified using Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-COR Biosciences).\n\n2.4 ELISA\nSamples were homogenized in RIPA containing 0.1% SDS, protein inhibitor cocktail, and phosphatase inhibitor and used for the analysis. To measure mouse apoE, plates were blocked with 1% milk and incubated with samples for overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing with PBS, a biotinylated antibody HJ6.3 was used as a detection antibody (\nUlrich et al., 2013\n). The HJ6.3 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. David M. Holtzman at Washington University School of Medicine. Synaptophysin, PSD95, GFAP and CD11b in mouse brains were measured by ELISA (\nShinohara et al., 2013\n). For synaptophysin and PSD95, capture antibodies were anti-rat/mouse rabbit-polyclonal synaptophysin (Osenses, Keswick, Australia) and rabbit anti-N-terminal region of PSD95 (Osenses) antibody, and detector antibodies were mouse monoclonal biotinylated antibody to SY38 (ACRIS, SanDiego, CA) and a biotinylated K28/43 from NeuroMab, respectively. For GFAP ELISA, a rabbit anti-GFAP capture antibody (US Biological, Swampscott, MA, USA) and biotinylated GA-5 detector antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) were used. For mouse CD11b ELISA, a rat monoclonal anti-mouse Integrin alpha M/CD11b antibody was used as a capture antibody (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) and a biotinylated rat anti-mouse CD11b (5C6) antibody (AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC) was used as a detector antibody. Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (Vector), the ELISA plates were developed with tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) and read at 650 nm with a Bio-Tek 600 plate reader.\n\n2.5 Immunohistochemical analysis\nParaffin embedded brain sections were immunostained for neuron (NeuN), astrocytes (GFAP) and microglia (Iba-1). The stained sections were visualized with DAB, scanned through Aperio AT 2 slide scanner (Aperio Technologies). To quantify the density of NeuN-positive neurons in the cortex, a region of interest (ROI) was set to include all layers above the hippocampus in each image. For hippocampal region CA1, a circular ROI (1.2 \u00d7 10\n4\n\u03bcm\n2\n) was selected in each image for the quantification. Three slices from each mouse were used for the analysis. The ratio of area covered by NeuN-staining was measured using the positive pixel count program in Image Scope software (Aperio Technlogies). The analysis was performed in a blinded manner.\n\n2.6 Liver function analysis\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity was measured using plasma samples by ALT activity assay kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA). To examine lipid synthesis in the liver, the triglyceride and total cholesterol levels in plasma were measured using specific kits from WAKO (Tokyo, Japan).\n\n2.7 Statistical analysis\nQuantified data were analyzed by two-tailed two-way ANOVA with a Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer\u2019s post-hoc analysis, or Student\u2019s t-test according to the properties of independent variables. All statistical analyses were performed on JMP 10.0 software (SAS Institute Inc.). Statistical significance was set to p<0.05."

    "Methods": "Fifty adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (250~300g) were used for data collection in this study. Six chronically-implanted rats were excluded as they died before completion of the experiment.Table 1lists the animals used in each experimental condition. We examined the effects of M1 and spinal cord stimulation on CST motor function in intact animals (Table 1; protocols 1, 2, and 3; n=35) and animals that received complete unilateral pyramidal tract lesions (PTX; protocol 4; n=15). For injured animals, 8 rats were chronically implanted with both cortical stimulation and tsDCS electrodes after motor training, and then they received PTX. CST tracing was performed in all of these animals after completion of the behavioral testing; 6 received combined stimulation and 2 served as controls. Data for an additional 7 controls (3 for behavioral testing and 4 for CST tracing) were reanalyzed from our early study, which experienced the identical behavioral training, surgical, and CST tracing procedures as the other animals except without sham tsDCS electrodes (Carmel et al., 2010;Carmel et al., 2014). Then the rats were divided into stimulated or non-stimulated control groups in behavior and tracing tests. The stimulated M1 corresponded to the origin of the intact CST. Care and treatment of the animals conformed to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the City College of New York.\n\nTable 1.\nAnimals for each group\nProtocol\nAnimal group\nN\n1&2 iTBS & tsDCS\nAnesthetized, acutely prepared\n17\nChronically instrumented (anesthetized/awake)\n9\n(9/7)\n3 M1-EMG correlations\nSpontaneous locomotion\n9\n4 Pyramidal tract lesion\n15\nBehavior/CST tracing\nInjury + stimulation\n6\nBehavior/CST tracing\nInjury only controls\n2\nCST tracing\nInjury only controls\n4\n*\nBehavior\nInjury only controls\n3\n*\nOpen in a new tab\n*\nanimals were reanalyzed from our prior study (\nCarmel et al., 2010\n)\n\nStimulation and recording electrodes\nWe used the same cortical epidural stimulating electrode as in our previous studies (\nBrus-Ramer et al., 2007\n;\nCarmel et al., 2013\n;\nCarmel et al., 2014\n) (Plastics One) and a 12 channel cortical recording electrode array with the reference wire connected to a skull screw. The epidural electrode was used to deliver the phasic stimulation as well as to evoke motor evoked potentials (MEPs) using double pulses (0.2ms duration, interstimulus interval 3 ms). MEPs were used to test corticospinal system excitability, which most likely was mediated by direct activation of the CST. However, there may be additional indirect spinal activation via corticofugal projections to brain stem motor systems. Bipolar EMG electrodes were made with Teflon-coated 7 strand stainless steel. tsDCS electrodes were either modified surface electrodes (StimTent Com; 15 mm by 20 mm; \u22121.5 to \u22122 mA; 0.5 mA/mm^2; one pole placed over the C4-T2 vertebrae and the other over the chest) or stainless steel subcutaneous electrode (10 mm by 15 mm) implanted at the same location as the surface electrodes (current: \u22121.0 mA). We used Finite Element Method (FEM) to simulate that this electrode configuration results in maximal current density within the cervical enlargement (see\nSupplemental Figure 1\n;\nSong et al 2015\n). The dorsal neck electrode was used as the cathodal electrode. During the awake conditions, the tsDCS surface electrodes were covered by a jacket to ensure stable contact with the skin during behavior. An electrical conductive spray was used to maintain conduction with the skin. Rats were pre-trained to wear the jacket and showed no signs of distress during experiments. tsDCS was delivered using an isolated stimulator (A-M Systems, 2100). tsDCS was applied during M1 phasic stimulation.\n\nElectrode implantation\nFor chronic stimulation experiments, animals were anesthetized using the Ketamine (90 mg/Kg) - Xylazine (10 mg/Kg) mixture. Animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame and a craniotomy (4mm by 4mm) was made over the left M1 to expose the forelimb representation. The cortical stimulating electrode was placed over the M1 area epidurally with the two L-shaped electrode wires 2 mm and 4 mm to the midline. The intracortical recording electrodes, which were four tetrodes, each built of 12\u03bcm nichrome wires, were inserted between the two stimulation electrodes (1.0 mm anterior from bregma; 2.5 mm mediolateral; 1.0\u20131.5 mm depth from dura) (\nFigure 1A\n). A small opening was made in the dura with a hypodermic needle to facilitate electrode insertion. The position of both the stimulating and the recording electrodes was confirmed by evoked contralateral forelimb movement when passing current via the electrodes (stimulus duration: 45 ms, pulse width: 0.2 ms, intensity: approximately 1.0 mA for epidural and 30uA for the intracortical electrodes). All currents produced only contralateral forelimb responses indicating that our stimulation was selective for forelimb M1, without spread to hind limb M1 or subcortical structures. EMG electrodes were implanted into the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscles bilaterally. We focused on ECR because it is a muscle used in skilled distal movements and it is well-represented in motor cortex. After surgery, animals were returned to a holding cage that was set on a heating pad, and observed until ambulatory. An analgesic (Buprenorphine, 0.1mg/Kg) and antibiotic (Ampicillin, 37.5mg/Kg) were administered for two and three days post-surgery, respectively.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nA.\nSchematic of experimental setup. A bipolar epidural cortical stimulating electrode (see inset) was implanted over the fore limb representation of caudal M1. Recording electrodes (inset; single dot) were implanted between the two stimulating electrodes. tsDCS was delivered through patch electrodes with cathode placed dorsally over the C4 to T1 vertebrae and the anode placed over chest. EMG activity was recorded from the ECR muscle contralaterally. The corticospinal system on the left side of the figure (dotted) highlights that after PTX all CST projections from one hemisphere are eliminated. For the affected contralateral side, the only innervation is the spared ipsilateral CST.\nB\n. PKC\u03b3 staining marks CST axons in the dorsal column. The micrograph is from a representative PTX animal showing unilateral PKC\u03b3 loss due to the lesion.\n\nNeural and EMG recording\nTesting started 7 days after surgery when animals were fully recovered. LFPs and EMGs were recorded with a commercial system (CED Power 1401, SPIKE2; Cambridge Electronic Design Ltd.). A unity gain head-stage (Neuralynx) was connected to electrode interface board via flexible cables, and LFPs were amplified (X 1000), band-pass filtered (0.1 \u2013 250 Hz) and digitized at a sampling frequency of 1 kHz. LFPs were further filtered with an offline software notch filter (irrnotch, MATLAB R2012) to remove the line noise. Line noise was removed from EMG activity in real time (60 Hz; Humbug, Quest Scientific) and differentially amplified (X 1000), band-pass filtered (100Hz \u2013 3 KHz) and digitized at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz.\n\nLadder training and scoring paw placement errors\nRats were trained to walk along a horizontal ladder (\nMetz and Whishaw, 2002\n), from one side to the other without stopping, until their forelimb error rate was approximately 10%. Rats were run on the ladder for 10 trials in each direction. Rung positions were changed randomly every five runs to prevent learning a particular pattern. Trials were videotaped by laboratory personnel blind to animal group and scored by a blinded observer. As described previously (\nCarmel et al., 2010\n), each step was scored as either good (forepaw palm contacted the ladder rung between the wrist and the digits) or errant (over-step, under-step, or miss). The percentage of errors within a session was used as the behavioral performance outcome measure. Performance was typically accessed twice within 5 days before making the pyramid lesion (baseline) and then every 7 days after injury without additional training in between. The low frequency of testing after injury made it unlikely that the animals derived therapeutic benefit from these sessions.\n\nPyramidotomy\nThe pyramid contralateral to the cortex with the epidural stimulating electrode (right pyramid; left M1 electrical stimulation) was transected at the rostral medulla (\nCarmel et al., 2010\n). The ventral surface of the occipital bone was exposed at the midline and a small craniotomy was made to access the pyramid tract on the ventral medullary surface. The pyramid on one side was cut with a fine iridectomy scissor to a depth of 1.2 mm below the pial surface immediately adjacent to the basilar artery. To ensure a complete lesion, a 27 gauge needle was passed through the cut. Lesions were verified histologically by transverse sections and cervical spinal PKC\u03b3 immunohistochemistry (see\nFigure 1B\n).\n\nCST axon tracing and histology\nIn PTX animals, the CST on the intact side (left M1) was anterogradely traced. At the end of the last session of ladder testing, rats were anaesthetized and placed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments) and body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C by a heating blanket. The epidural electrode implant was removed to expose the dura over M1, a procedure that does not produce M1 trauma (\nCarmel et al., 2010\n). The dura was incised and 7 pressure injections (300nl/each) of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA; 10,000 MW; Molecular Probes; 10% in 0.1M PBS) was made in the forelimb M1 (depth 1.5mm, lateral 2.5 to 3.5mm; rostral: 0.5 to 2.5mm; separated by 0.5mm each injection site). Two weeks later, rats were euthanized by an anesthetic overdose and transcardially perfused (300 ml saline followed by 500ml 4% paraformaldehyde). Tissue containing the lesion site and cervical spinal cord were dissected post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 hours and transferred to 20% sucrose (overnight at 4\u00b0C). Transverse sections of brain stem and spinal cord (around C6) were cut in40 \u03bcm thickness. Pyramid lesions were examined using Nissl staining at the site of injury or immunostained the CST below the lesion site with PKC\u03b3 to verify loss of CST axons (rabbit anti-PKC\u03b3, 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To visualize BDA-labeled CST axons, sections at C6 spinal segments were incubated in phosphate-buffered (pH 7.4) saline containing 1% avidin\u2013biotin complex reagent (ABC kit; Vector Laboratories) and 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma), for 2 h at room temperature. After rinsing, sections were incubated with diaminobenzidine (Sigma) for 20 min. After rinsing again, sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, air-dried overnight, and cover slipped.\n\nAxon density map and axon length estimation\nTo monitor changes in ipsilateral (to stimulated/BDA-injected M1 hemisphere) CST axon length from regions of interest within the gray matter, we used an unbiased stereological estimate Stereo Investigator; \u2018Spaceball;\u2019 MBF Bioscience Williston Vermont USA), similar to our earlier study (\nCarmel et al., 2010\n). Measurements were made by laboratory personnel that were blind to animal group. Briefly, the ipsilateral gray matter border was traced at 20 X magnification under microscope with the above software. The program divided the region into 5 \u03bcm by 5 \u03bcm squares. Within each measurement square a sampling sphere of 20 um diameter (\u2018space ball\u2019) was established by the program. Intersections between labeled axons and the sampling sphere were marked under 100 X magnification. An intersection is defined as a contact or crossing of an axon with the cross-section of the sphere, and is saved as a single-pixel dot in an image TIFF file. The number of intersections within each 50 \u03bcm square volume was used to estimate local axon length based on sphere volume and tissue thickness (\nMouton et al., 2002\n). TIFF files of individual sections representing intersections as single pixels were then aligned with each other based on tissue orientation and landmarks. The density of marked pixels for each sections were smoothed (2-D low pass filter; filter2, MATLAB R2012) to create a probability heatmap of local axon length after correction for tracer efficacy (see below), as well as the one dimensional projections along dorsoventral and mediolateral axes. Areas without labeling are plotted indigo. Total axon length for each animal was estimated based on the total number of interactions within the gray matter averaged across sections (4/animal). To correct for tracer efficacy, the estimated axon length of each animals (\nL\ni\n) was further adjusted by a correction factor (\nC\ni\n)\nC\ni\n=\nN\ni\n/\nN\ni\nis the animal number, and\nN\ni\nis the CST mean axon number across slides for animal\ni\n, which was estimated from BDA-labeled axons within the dorsal column opposite to M1 injection side by using the Optical Dissector (Stereo Investigator) under 100X magnification. N is the average axon number across all animals. Finally the adjusted axon length for animal\ni\nwas calculated as\nL\ni\n/\nC\ni\n. This stereological sampling and correction allows accurate estimation of axon length, and thus allows to compare how stimulation affects axon outgrowth within the target area. Color-coded maps of corrected regional axon density and axon density p values were constructed using Matlab and registered with the ipsilateral gray matter border.\n\nExperiment design protocols\nFour experimental design protocols were used in this study.\nAcute testing of intact animals under anesthesia: Protocols 1 and 2\nProtocol 1\nwas used to determine the optimal inter-stimulus interval (ISI) that would be used for optimizing the timing of pulses within the iTBS and the modulatory effect of tsDCS (cathodal versus anodal). These experiments were conducted in anesthetized rats (see\nFig. 2A\n). A burst of 3 stimuli with different ISIs (3ms, 20ms, 50ms and 100ms) was delivered every 3s through the M1 electrode. Then, by using the optimal ISI (50ms), the DC polarity-dependent effect was tested by c-tsDCS or anodal tsDCS (a-tsDCS) or without tsDCS. MEPs were recorded and their amplitude, area and latency (time from stimulation onset to the first deflection of the evoked potential) were measured and compared under different conditions.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nExperimental protocols.\nA.\nProtocol 1 was used to test optimal ISIs for producing facilitation. Cathodal (\u2212) or anodal (+) tsDCS, represented as either the downward or upward directed trapezoids, was applied during the period of phasic M1 stimulation.\nB.\nProtocol 2 was used to test the effect of patterned M1 electrical stimulation (iTBS) and the effect of concurrent tsDCS.\nC\n. Protocol 3 was used in awake animals during locomotion to test the affect of iTBS, with and without c-tsDCS, on cortico-muscular coupling (R-square value of LFP-EMG relationship). This protocol is similar to Protocol 2 except that 5 epochs of iTBSs (3000 pulses total) were delivered within 1630 second.\nD\n. The timeline of protocol 4, which was used to test the effect of the combined stimulation (iTBS/c-tsDCS) on motor recovery and CST ipsilateral sprouting in the PTX subgroup. Stimulation for this protocol is the same used in Protocol 3.\nProtocol 2\nwas used to develop the electrical iTBS (\nFig. 2B\n), based on the parameters optimized in\nProtocol 1\nand to determine the effects of tsDCS. To mimic the protocols used for transcranial magnetic stimulation and to facilitate translation to clinical application, we kept the electrical stimulation parameters similar to those used in magnetic stimulation (\nHuang et al., 2005\n). The electrical iTBS consists of delivering a burst of 3 pulses (ISI: 50ms), repeated 10 times, for 2s followed by 8s off; this was repeated 20 times. To summarize pulse number, each burst (as shown in\nFig 2B\n) consisted of 30 pulses. This was repeated 20 times, for a total of 600 pulses. This comprised the basic iTBS stimulation block. The stimulation intensity for iTBS was chosen as 90% of motor threshold level, defined as the intensity inducing a minimal muscle responses (50\u03bcV minimal amplitude) in 5 out of 10 testing stimulation trains (2 pulses at 333Hz). We typically observed MEP facilitation during stimulation and, as a consequence, overt muscle responses were often produced by each 3-pulse stimulus burst. The stimulation intensity for MEP evaluation was set at 120% of the threshold established before any modulatory stimulation (iTBS or tsDCS). Since single M1 epidural stimulating pulses did not reliably induce responses, double testing pulses (3ms interval, 200\u03bcs duration) were used both before and after the intervention to test MEPs for each session. In some rats we measured limb force produced by stimulation by attaching a force sensor (Grass FT03C; sensitivity range: 2mg \u2013 2 kg) to the forepaw to verify that that a MEP increase was associated with a force increase.\nBoth\nProtocol 1\nand\nProtocol 2\nwere tested under light Ketamine anesthesia (70mg/kg), and in a subset of animals the anesthesia level was monitored by recording the heart rate and verified to be stable. Additional doses (10 mg/kg) were administered if the heart rate increased over 5% of baseline. When multiple testing sessions were conducted in chronically implanted rats, several days were allowed to elapse between sessions.\nAwake testing of intact animals: Protocol 3\nWe used\nProtocol 3\nto test the effect of stimulation on the excitability of the motor output and the functional connection between the cortex and muscle during normal locomotion and quiet resting (see\nFig. 2C\n). Because a single magnetic iTBS session, or continuously delivering iTBS, does not optimally increase excitability or plasticity (\nRothkegel et al., 2010\n;\nRothkegel et al., 2009\n), we used five electrical iTBS epochs as in other studies (\nBenali et al., 2011\n). This resulted in a 1630 second stimulation period (~27 min). To determine response facilitation, we compared MEP amplitude after treatment with the pre-treatment amplitude. For this analysis we used average MEP values. The effects of iTBS were examined with or without c-tsDCS. iTBS stimulation intensity was ~90% of threshold. In seven rats, we also measured MEP amplitude before and after the iTBS+c-tsDCS to determine the relationship between Protocol 3 stimulation and motor output during quiet rest.\nWe used locomotion to test functional connections between forelimb M1 and muscle. During locomotion testing, rats were put in a clean open field (1m by 0.5m) and allowed to freely move within the field for 3 min. To motivate rats to walk continuously, food pellets were scattered within the field. Each session was composed of three periods: pre-stimulation, stimulation, post-stimulation. LFP spectral power was regressed with ECR EMG during the 3 min locomotion epochs before and after iTBS+c-tsDCS. The same handling procedure was used for the control rats, but stimulation was only on for 10s to mimic tsDCS ramping period.\nTherapeutic effect of combined stimulation in animals with PTX: Protocol 4\nWe used protocol 4 to test the therapeutic effect of the combined stimulation (iTBS+c-tsDCS) in PTX rats (\nFig 2D\n). Rats were first implanted with the M1 electrode and then were trained on ladder walking for 2 weeks. When animals reached criterion performance (~10% error rate), they received PTX. Rats receiving treatment underwent the combined stimulation (iTBS+c-tsDCS; as protocol 3) for ten days. The motor threshold in response to M1 stimulation (pulse duration 200us; frequency: 333Hz; train length: 45ms) was assessed immediately before the combined stimulation from the second through tenth session. Motor threshold is defined as the minimum current intensity to produce a contralateral forelimb movement. The ladder score was assessed on the third day after the PTX and then every seven days for one month. The control rats experienced the same procedure except without iTBS+c-tsDCS. After the last ladder testing session, the CST was traced, as described above.\n\nMotor evoked potential analysis\nTo evaluate the excitability and plasticity of the corticospinal system, we monitored changes in peak-to-peak MEP amplitude (\nDelvendahl et al., 2012\n;\nSala et al., 2004\n). As MEPs from the ECR muscle ipsilateral to the side of the stimulating electrode were not reliably induced during M1 stimulation, we only present data from the contralateral ECR muscle. Trials that showed EMG activity during the baseline period (2s before stimuli) were removed from analysis. In a subset of awake animals, we recorded the MEPs when animals remained in a relaxed condition (n=9 animals; Protocol 3).\n\nRegression of LFPs on EMGs during walking\nTo examine the functional relationship between M1 and muscle, we regressed the M1 LFPs to the contralateral ECR EMG in intact rats during a 3-minute period of overground locomotion (as described above) for the different treatment conditions. M1 LFPs encode both muscle and movement intent during reaching (\nFlint et al., 2012\n;\nHwang and Andersen, 2013\n). Compared with single unit activity, LFPs show larger signal and noise correlations across channels (\nHwang and Andersen, 2013\n). Although there is slightly decreased neural decoding performance when using multichannel LFPs than using multichannel spikes, LFPs yield more channel numbers and provides stable long-term recording. Following a similar published procedure (\nFlint et al., 2013\n), the functional connection between M1 and ECR was calculated as a multiple linear regression. EMGs were first digitally high-pass filtered at 50 Hz, full-wave rectified, and then low-pass filtered at 10 Hz. Next, LFPs were detrended and line noise removed digitally with a 60Hz notch filter (notch, MATLAB R2012). A non-causal zero-phase digital filter was used by processing the LFP and EMG data in both the forward and reverse directions. Then the power spectra of each channel of LFPs was calculated by using a short-time Fourier transform with a Hamming window (length: 256, step: 20 ms), which results in a power sampling frequency of 50 Hz. Finally, the pre-processed EMGs were down-sampled to the same LFP sampling frequency (50 Hz), and the relation between the above-processed EMGs and the mean spectral power of LFPs within different frequency band was fitted with the multiple linear regression function shown below. Instead of taking the inputs from the mean spectral power of multiple non-overlapping frequency bands for each channel (\nFlint et al., 2013\n), we used the mean spectral power of the full frequency band (1 Hz to 250 Hz) of each channel as,\ny\n=\nk\nX\n(1)\nwhere\ny\nis the pre-processed EMG of ECR muscle, and\nX\nis the mean spectral power (described above) of LFPs in M1 from the electrode wires. The goodness of fit was estimated by\nR\n2\nstatistics,\nR\n2\n=\n\u2211\n(\ny\n^\ni\n-\ny\n\u00af\n)\n2\n\u2211\n(\ny\ni\n-\ny\n\u00af\n)\n2\n(2)\nwhere\n\u0177\ni\nis the fitted value,\ny\ni\nis the observed value, and\n\u0233\nis the average of the observed values.\nR\n2\nclose to 1 indicates a well-fit regression. The correlation coefficient between MEPs during rest and the R-squared values during locomotion was assessed both before and after treatment (iTBS alone, iTBS+c-tsDCS, or control) across each session. The R-squared value is commonly used to evaluate encoding/decoding performance in brain machine interface research and to examine the functional relationship between neural activity (single unit activity or LFP) and behavioral measures (EMG, kinematics and intention) (\nFlint et al., 2013\n;\nHwang and Andersen, 2013\n;\nSong et al., 2009\n). We tested whether the correlations were significantly different using a bootstrap function (bootstrap, MATLAB R2012).\nStatistical analysis\nWe ascertained differences between protocols with parametric (ttest, MATLAB R2012) and non-parametric tests (ranksum or signrank, MATLAB R2012) for data sets with normal and non-normal distributions, respectively. A two-way analysis of variance was used to test the influence of categorical independent variables (including pulse sequence, ISI, and tsDCS polarity) on MEP changes (ANOVA2, MATLAB R2012), and post-hoc analysis was used for pair comparisons with correction. The significance level was set at 0.05. All data analyses were performed using MATLAB R2012 (MathWorks Inc.)."

    "Methods": "2.1. Subjects\nAll subjects gave their informed consent to take part in the study, which was approved by the local ethics committees at our recording sites in Oxford, London and Bristol, United Kingdom. Eight patients with PD (mean disease duration 11.6\u00a0years, mean age 57.1\u00a0years, range 32\u201370\u00a0years, six males) underwent bilateral implantation of DBS electrodes into the STN, as a prelude to therapeutic high frequency stimulation for advanced idiopathic PD with motor fluctuations and/or dyskinesias. Techniques to target and implant electrodes in the STN have previously been described (\nFoltynie and Hariz, 2010\n). No microelectrode recordings were made, although the effects of direct stimulation were confirmed intra-operatively. In addition, the locations of the electrodes were confirmed with immediate post-operative stereotactic imaging. Nonetheless, in acknowledgment of the fact that not all electrode contacts could be expected to lie in the STN per se, we term the area sampled by the contact pairs the STN region, STNr. DBS electrode extension cables were externalized through the scalp to enable recordings prior to connection to a subcutaneous DBS pacemaker, implanted in a second operative procedure up to seven days later. Clinical details of the patients are available in\nTable 1\n. The mean percentage improvement in the motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) on treatment with levodopa (L-DOPA) was 70.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018, Wilcoxon signed-rank test between ON and OFF L-DOPA scores; data missing in one case) across subjects, indicating good responsiveness to L-DOPA in our study participants. A further PD patient was implanted in the pedunculopontine region (PPNr) and STNr/zona incerta, bilaterally, for freezing of gait (see last case in\nTable 1\n). The PPNr electrodes were placed using a transventricular trajectory so that all four electrode contacts were intended to lie within the PPN. The STNr electrodes were placed in the caudal zona incerta, with the central two electrode contacts lying adjacent to or clipping the STN. Details of the surgical procedure have been previously outlined (\nKhan et al., 2011\n).\nTable 1.\nPatient details.

Experimental paradigm\nSubjects were presented with a series of imperative visual (V) cues, separated by 8.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0s, and instructed to squeeze a hand-held force dynamometer \u201cas fast and hard as you possibly can when the light comes on and maintain this for the duration of the light\u201d (red light-emitting-diode illuminated for 3\u00a0s). A loud auditory stimulus (40\u00a0ms duration, 1\u00a0kHz), at one of five different randomly selected sound pressure levels (82, 88, 94, 100, 105\u00a0dB) was delivered binaurally through headphones, with onset simultaneous with that of the V cue. However, subjects were asked to just focus on responding to the V cues. Fifteen cues of each sound pressure level (75 trials in total) were delivered in each experimental run. Trials were carried out in a blocked design, and left- and right-hand recordings were counterbalanced across subjects. Inter-trial intervals were shorter than in our previous studies (\nAnzak et al., 2011a\n,\nAnzak et al., 2011b\n,\nAnzak et al., 2012\n) to allow for a greater number of trials to be executed prior to correlative analysis, whilst avoiding an excessively lengthy paradigm in our patients with PD.\nGrip force was measured one hand at a time in each subject using an isometric dynamometer (G100; Biometrics Ltd, Cwmfelinfach, Gwent, UK), with standard Jamar design and its handle set in the second of the five discrete grip diameter adjustments possible (\nSancho-Bru et al., 2008\n). Subjects were seated with their shoulders adducted (so that elbows rested against the trunk), their elbows flexed at about 90\u00b0 and their forearms in neutral, as recommended by the American Association of Hand Therapists (\nFess, 1992\n). Stimulus intensities were measured in a sound-proofed room with a Br\u00fcel and Kjaer 2260 Observer (Br\u00fcel and Kjaer, N\u00e6rum, Denmark) via an artificial ear and headphone adapter.\n\n2.3. Recordings\nIn our nine patients with externalized DBS electrodes (8 bilateral STNr, 1 bilateral PPNr & STNr/ZI), LFP recordings were made 3\u20136\u00a0days after surgery. In order to complete the recordings in one morning, and limit intrusion on our easily fatigable post-operative patients, recordings were always made first after overnight withdrawal of anti-parkinsonian medication (OFF L-DOPA), and then again approximately 1\u00a0h after taking their usual morning dose (average morning L-DOPA dose administered\u00a0=\u00a0186\u00a0\u00b1\u00a062\u00a0mg). Improvement with medication was confirmed through assessment of finger tapping, wrist rigidity and tremor (using the corresponding items of the motor UPDRS).\nLFPs, and surface EEG from Fz and Cz were recorded monopolarly with respect to a linked earlobe reference using a TMSi porti amplifier (TMS international) and its respective software. EMG was recorded from orbicularis oculi to identify blinks. All recordings were band-pass filtered between 0.5 and 500\u00a0Hz and sampled at 2048\u00a0Hz. Analogue correlates of the visual and auditory stimuli and dynamometer output were recorded and digitized in a similar way. Monopolar LFP recordings were subsequently converted off-line to a bipolar montage between adjacent contacts (three bipolar channels per side) to limit the effects of volume conduction from distant sources. Bipolar Fz\u2013Cz was also created offline. The line noise artefacts at 50\u00a0Hz and 100\u00a0Hz were removed using notch filters (5th order zero-phase Butterworth filters).\n\n2.4. Data analysis\nAnalyses of both behavioral and LFP data were performed in Matlab (version 7.10). Peak force (PF) and pre-motor reaction time (RT) were the chosen biomechanical variables of interest. Premotor reaction time was defined as the time interval between cue onset and the point at which force exceeded 5% of the PF (taken as response onset). We acknowledge that premotor reaction time is more usually considered to be the interval between cue presentation and EMG onset (\nBotwinick and Thompson, 1966\n). However, as in previous studies (\nAnzak et al., 2011a\n,\nAnzak et al., 2011b\n,\nAnzak et al., 2012\n) we found the use of EMG to be suboptimal in the context of maximal grips because of movement artefact and sampling error, due to activation of multiple muscles in this task. Peak yank (PY; where yank is defined as the rate of change of force, calculated by differentiation of the force signal) was also derived. Note too that the scalp EEG was contaminated by auditory blink reflexes to the intense stimuli and so was not analyzed further.\nSTNr LFP activity recorded from externalized DBS electrodes was decomposed into two components: evoked potentials, which are phase-locked to stimulus onset, and induced frequency-specific components, which are not (\nDavid et al., 2006\n). We sought to derive both these constituents in order to investigate whether STNr activity in either domain preceded and correlated with enhancements in motor performance. The techniques for derivation of evoked activity and event related induced power are outlined in Supplementary Material 1.\n\n2.5. Statistics\nGrand averages of PF, PY and RT, in response to each stimulus intensity, were calculated after deriving each of these variables from the individual grips made by a subject, and calculating the mean values for that subject, before averaging across study participants.\nFor calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficients and multiple linear regression analyses at the within-subject level, behavioural and LFP data \u2013 in response to each stimulus intensity \u2013 were normalized as a proportion of responses to the lowest intensity (82\u00a0dB) stimulus, with exception of the data illustrated in\nFig. 1\n. In order to achieve a more uniform spread of the data for all parametric analyses, behavioral parameters and peak evoked potential amplitudes were log transformed, whilst mean induced power over specific frequency bands benefited the most from a square root transform of the absolute amplitude of the activity (preserving the polarity of the data). High beta activity in one individual was excluded from correlative analyses, as the average power was eight times the greatest high beta power from among the remaining individuals.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nNormalized group average (A) grip force (B) reaction times, in response to five different cue intensities averaged across OFF and ON L-DOPA recordings. n\u00a0=\u00a016 gripping hands. Traces in (A) have been normalized as a percentage of the maximal peak force attained among different trials by an individual in response to the maximum intensity stimulus, before collation across subjects. Shaded area corresponding to each cue intensity represents the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the force traces. Note, where the CIs overlap, the CI of the greater amplitude trace is shown. Group mean RTs are shown with SEM.\nIn illustrations of evoked activity, the time-evolving power of the group mean absolute evoked potential traces, for each stimulus intensity, has been plotted as a z-score calculated for the average evoked potential profiles derived from all contact pairs on each DBS electrode in an individual, before collapsing across subjects. Z-scores were derived from the power of the absolute amplitude time series of the evoked potential at each millisecond interval by subtraction of the mean LFP power 1\u20132\u00a0s prior to the cue, followed by division of this value by the standard deviation of the power of the 1\u20132\u00a0s pre-cue baseline. These illustrations therefore exclude induced power.\nStatistical analyses were performed in SPSS Statistics 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were applied for confirmation of normal distributions, where required, prior to parametric testing. Where Mauchly's test of sphericity was significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in repeated measures ANOVAs, Greenhouse\u2013Geisser corrections were applied. Mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard error of mean (SEM) are presented throughout the text. Those statistical tests that reached significance (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and where appropriate survived correction for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction (\nCurran-Everett, 2000\n) are indicated with an asterisk (*) in the text."

PTP\u03c3 \u2212/\u2212 animals were created by breeding a maintained colony of heterozygotes; +/+ BALB/c mice served as WT controls. All mice were kept on a 12 hour light-dark cycle with access to food and water\nad libitum\n. Mixed-sex and age-matched littermates between 12 and 18 weeks of age were used for surgeries. All procedures were approved by the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and comply with the Guide for the Care and use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Academies (8th edition).\n\nCardiac ischemia-reperfusion (myocardial infarction)\nMyocardial infarction (MI) was induced by ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) as previously reported (\nGardner and Habecker, 2013\n). Briefly, the left anterior descending coronary artery was reversibly ligated for 45 minutes and then reperfused by releasing the ligature. Occlusion was confirmed by sustained S-T wave elevation and regional cyanosis. Reperfusion was confirmed by the return of color to the ventricle distal to the ligation and reperfusion arrhythmia. Core body temperature was monitored by a rectal probe and maintained at 37\u00b0C, and a two-lead electrocardiogram was monitored. Sham controls underwent an identical procedure except for the left anterior descending coronary artery ligation.\n\nTreatment groups\nImmediately following MI, animals were injected intraperitoneally with 20 \u00b5g of the PTP\u03c3 modulator, Intracellular Sigma Peptide (ISP) (\nLang et al., 2015\n) (4% DMSO, 96% saline: 100 \u00b5l volume). Additional injections were given 24 and 48 hours later, and hearts were removed 3 days after surgery. This dose of ISP is sufficient to promote axon regeneration after spinal cord injury or myocardial infarction (\nGardner et al., 2015\n;\nLang et al., 2015\n).\n\nTissue preparation and immunohistochemistry\nOn day 3 post-MI, mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and the hearts were removed. The hearts were rinsed in saline, trimmed of the atria and extraneous tissue, and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 1 hour. Hearts were rinsed 3 times in PBS and then cryo-protected in 30% sucrose overnight at 4\u00b0C. The hearts were mounted in OCT and sectioned at 10 \u00b5m thickness for immunohistochemistry as previously described (\nGardner and Habecker, 2013\n). Sections were collected near the beginning, middle, and end of the infarct zones along the transverse\nz\n-axis from base towards apex.\nTyrosine hydroxylase (TH, rabbit IgG, 1:1000, Invitrogen) was used as a marker for sympathetic nerves in the heart, and fibrinogen (sheep IgG, 1:500; Serotec) was used to visualize the infarcted tissue; images using the DAPI filter confirmed necrotic regions, which manifest naturally as distinct dark regions compared to the autofluorescent, viable tissue. Abcam rat anti-CD68 (1:1000) was used to identify the M1 macrophage profile, while Abcam rabbit anti-mannose receptor (also known as CD206, 1:500) was used to identify the M2 profile. These are established markers of macrophage profile subtypes in inflammation (\nDidangelos et al., 2014\n). The antibody for MAC-2 (also known as galectin-3, rat IgG, 1:1000, Cedarlane Labs) was used as a general macrophage marker for cardiac inflammation that is not specific for unique macrophage profiles. Appropriate Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies were used at 1:1000. Detailed immunohistochemistry procedures were performed as reported previously (\nGardner and Habecker, 2013\n).\n\nAnalysis\n10\u00d7 (general macrophage response) and 20\u00d7 (sympathetic innervation and M1/M2 profile) images were used for analysis. The infarct (\u201cI\u201d) encompassed necrotic tissue outlined by fibrinogen staining and was confirmed by loss of autofluorescence using the 350 nm filter. Regions that were approximately one image field removed (\u2248 710 \u00b5m) from the infarct border zone were considered \u201cproximal,\u201d (\u201cP\u201d) whereas regions approximately one more image field farther away from the infarct were considered \u201cdistal,\u201d (\u201cD\u201d) (\nFigure 1A\n). Three sections collected along different positions of the transverse z-axis were analyzed and averaged from each heart. Sections analyzed from the sham animals were chosen from different regions between the base and the apex.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nPTP\u03c3 modulation or deletion does not prevent sympathetic axonal dieback.

Following analysis of TH innervation density, heart sections for the M1/M2 and MAC2 analysis were chosen based on where the infarct was be maximal. One section from each animal was analyzed at 10\u00d7 to better encapsulate the entire infarct within one field of view. The infarct perimeter was defined by fibrinogen staining and/or the loss of autofluorescence through the 350 nm filter. Quantification of M1 (CD68), M2 (CD206), and total macrophages (MAC2) was calculated as pixel density thresholds within the infarct perimeter.\n\nStatistics\nPrism 5.0 software performed all statistical analysis.

Anesthesia for surgical procedures was conducted with intramuscular injection of ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). All of the experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Mayo Clinic, in compliance with the American Physiological Society guidelines.\nAnimals were randomly assigned to two groups: intrapleural injection of AAV-GFP (n = 11) or AAV-TrkB (n = 15) prior to placement of electrodes for chronic EMG recordings. DIAm EMG activity was used to verify the completeness of C2SH prior to AAV injection and to monitor recovery of rhythmic ipsilateral activity over time (7, 14 and 21 days post-C2SH). At the terminal experiment rats were euthanized by exsanguination and the spinal cord was dissected under RNase free conditions and frozen for further analysis.\n\nElectrode Implantation\nImplantation of chronic DIAm electrodes was performed in all rats at ~3 days prior to C2SH, as previously described (\nDow, et al., 2006\n,\nDow, et al., 2009\n,\nGransee, et al., 2013\n,\nGransee, et al., 2015\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2013\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2011\n,\nTrelease, et al., 1982\n). Briefly, a 2 mm segment of insulated stainless steel wire (AS631, Cooner Wire Inc., Chatsworth, CA) was stripped of insulation and inserted into the midcostal region of the DIAm. Two electrodes were inserted in each side and externalized for chronic EMG recordings.\n\nSpinal Hemisection (C2SH)\nSpinal hemisection was conducted as previously detailed and validated (\nGransee, et al., 2013\n,\nGransee, et al., 2015\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2012\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2014\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2013\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2007\n,\nMiyata, et al., 1995\n,\nPrakash, et al., 1999\n). Using a dissecting microscope under sterile conditions a dorsal C2 laminectomy was performed and only the right anterolateral spinal cord was transected at C2 with a microknife. Animals received analgesics for the first three days postoperatively, including oral acetaminophen (100\u2013300 mg/kg) and intramuscular buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) as needed. Complete hemisection was verified by absence of ipsilateral DIAm EMG activity immediately following the procedure and 3 days following C2SH.\n\nChronic EMG Recordings and Analysis\nIn anesthetized animals, DIAm EMG recordings were conducted during eupnea at various time points: prior to C2SH on day 0 and at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days post-C2SH, in accordance with previous studies (\nGransee, et al., 2013\n,\nGransee, et al., 2015\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2013\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2013\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2011\n). Eupneic recordings were conducted for at least 2 min in lightly anesthetized animals (using ~ one-third of the surgical anesthesia dose) while the animals were supine resting on a heating pad. At day 21, EMG recordings were additionally conducted during exposure to hypoxic (10% O\n2\n)-hypercapnic (5% CO\n2\n) conditions for 5 min and during sustained airway occlusion for 45 s. Data acquisition was conducted using LabView software (National Instruments, Austin, TX) at a sampling frequency of 2 kHz, following filtering (20\u20131000 Hz bandpass) and amplification (x2000). Root mean square (RMS) DIAm EMG activity was measured using a 50 ms window as in previous studies (\nMantilla, et al., 2011\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2010\n). Digitized EMG signals were analyzed using MatLab 8.2 (MathWorks, Natick, MA). The mean peak RMS EMG activity was measured for eupnea (2 min), hypoxia-hypercapnia (last 30 s) and airway occlusion (last 5 s). In addition, spontaneous deep breaths (\u201csighs\u201d), defined as inspiratory events with amplitude at least twice eupneic amplitude, were identified during periods of eupnea and hypoxia-hypercapnia pre-C2SH.\nRecovery of ipsilateral DIAm EMG activity during eupnea was defined by the following criteria: 1) rhythmic DIAm EMG signal reflecting inspiratory activity in phase with contralateral DIAm activity across most inspiratory bursts (>90%), 2) DIAm EMG signal comprising more than one motor unit (multiple units with different waveform profiles), and 3) DIAm EMG amplitude at least 10% of pre-C2SH, consistent with previous studies (\nDow, et al., 2009\n,\nGransee, et al., 2013\n,\nGransee, et al., 2015\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2013\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2013\n). The proportion of animals meeting criteria for recovery was determined at various time points following C2SH. In addition, peak RMS EMG amplitude was normalized to the mean peak RMS EMG pre-C2SH during eupnea for the same animal (normalized RMS EMG) in order to calculate the extent of recovery of ipsilateral DIAm EMG activity post-C2SH. Respiratory rate and duty cycle were calculated from contralateral DIAm EMG recordings at days 0 and 21 post-C2SH.\n\nAAV Administration\nAAV serotype 7 vectors encoding human GFP (AAV.CMV.PI.EGFP.WPRE.bGH) or TrkB.FL (AAV7.CMV.Flag-TrkB.WPRE.bGH) under a CMV promoter were obtained from the Vector Core at University of Pennsylvania, as previously reported (\nGransee, et al., 2013\n). At day 3 post-C2SH, 1\u00d710\n11\ngenome copies of the AAV7 vector (GFP or TrkB.FL) were administered into the right (ipsilateral) pleural space between the 7\nth\nand 8\nth\nribs via 2 injections (50 \u03bcl total) using a Hamilton syringe, as previously reported (\nGransee, et al., 2013\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2009\n). Intrapleural AAV injection results in greater than 15% efficiency in transduction of ipsilateral phrenic motoneurons with no other neurons labeled in the cervical spinal cord (\nGransee, et al., 2013\n). Specific transduction of phrenic motoneurons following intrapleural AAV injection was previously verified by GFP immunoreactivity, FLAG protein expression in cervical homogenate and TrkB mRNA expression in laser capture microdissected phrenic motoneurons (\nGransee, et al., 2013\n).\n\nLaser Capture Microdissection (LCM) of Phrenic Motoneurons\nIn a subset of animals (n = 7 per group), phrenic motoneurons were labeled retrogradely by bilateral intrapleural injection of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) 3 days prior to the terminal experiment, as in previous studies (\nGransee, et al., 2013\n,\nGransee, et al., 2015\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2012\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2013\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2009\n). At the terminal experiment, the cervical spinal cord (C2-C7) was dissected and quickly frozen in liquid N\n2\nunder RNase free conditions for LCM analysis. Spinal cord samples were cut in 10 \u03bcm thick longitudinal sections, placed on pre-chilled slides (SuperFrost, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA), and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until immediately before microdissection. Samples were dehydrated in serial alcohols followed by xylene as described in the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Arcturus LCM, Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies Corp., Carlsbad, CA). Fluorescently labeled phrenic motoneurons were individually visualized under direct epifluorescence illumination. Labeled motoneurons from the right side of the spinal cord (ipsilateral to C2SH) were microdissected onto Capsure HS LCM caps (Arcturus) using an Arcturus XT LCM microdissection system. Retrogradely-labeled motoneurons were characteristically large neurons found in clusters in a rostrocaudal column parallel to the long axis of the cord (\nMantilla, et al., 2012\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2009\n). Imaging conditions were selected to minimize tissue autofluorescence. In most cases, ~4 caps (each containing motoneurons from 3\u20134 sections) were obtained from each animal. Caps were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing.\n\nQuantitative Real-Time PCR of Microdissected Phrenic Motoneurons\nAs in previous studies (\nGransee, et al., 2013\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2012\n), total RNA was extracted from LCM samples using RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) with the addition of on-column DNase digestion. Reverse transcription was done using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. All reverse transcription reactions were done in duplicate for each sample. For gene expression analysis, 1 \u03bcl of the reverse transcription reaction was added to a reaction mix containing: LightCycler 480 1 \u00d7 SYBR Green I Master (Roche), and 0.5 \u03bcM of the respective primer pair. In accordance with a previous study in phrenic motoneurons (\nMantilla, et al., 2012\n), the following receptor subtypes were studied: AMPA, NMDA, 5-HTR2a, and 5-HTR2c, with ribosomal protein S16 (RPS16) used as a reference gene. Primers used for amplification determined expression of the GluR2 and NR1 subunits of the AMPA and NMDA receptors, respectively, as previously reported (\nMantilla, et al., 2012\n). Amplification and quantitation of mRNA was performed on a LightCycler 480 (Roche). Parameters for amplification of all products were identical: an initial 5-min pre-amplification incubation at 95\u00b0C was followed by 60 cycles of primer annealing at 60\u00b0C for 12 s, PCR product extension at 72\u00b0C for 18 s and denaturing at 95\u00b0C for 15 s. All PCR reactions were performed in duplicate for each reverse transcription product.\nFollowing amplification, a melting curve analysis was performed to verify product specificity by identifying a single peak at the appropriate temperature. We previously verified that each transcript of interest was of the correct size using agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products and that these were of the correct DNA sequence (\nMantilla, et al., 2012\n). An amplification fluorescence plot was generated for each sample using LightCycler 480 software (version 1.5, Roche). The threshold cycle (i.e., crossing point\u2014CP, where amplification transitions from a linear to a logarithmic phase) was determined using the second derivative method. Comparison of the CP of the gene product to that of the RPS16 run concurrently permitted determination of a \u0394CP for each sample and transcript. In this context the \u0394CP reflects the relative mRNA concentration for each GluR and 5-HTR subtype transcript in each sample. An average \u0394CP was then calculated for each transcript and animal.\n\nStatistical Analyses\nStatistical comparisons were performed using JMP 10.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The proportion of animals displaying recovery of rhythmic ipsilateral DIAm activity was compared across AAV-GFP and AAV-TrkB groups using a repeated measures nominal logistic test (time x AAV treatment). Mixed linear models with repeated measures (time x AAV treatment interaction) and animal as a random effect were generated for comparisons across experimental groups for extent of recovery during eupnea and ventilatory parameters (respiratory rate and duty cycle). Similarly, comparisons across DIAm motor behaviors (eupnea vs. hypoxia-hypercapnia vs. airway occlusion vs. pre-C2SH sigh) at 21 days post-C2SH and for comparisons of the relative expression of GluR and 5-HTR (average \u0394CP for each receptor per animal) were conducted using mixed linear models with animal as a random effect. When appropriate,\npost hoc\ncomparisons were performed using Tukey-Kramer\u2019s HSD test. Secondary, subgroup analyses were conducted for animals displaying recovery of ipsilateral rhythmic DIAm EMG activity vs. not. Data are reported as mean \u00b1 SE unless otherwise specified. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05."

    "Methods": "Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250\u2013275g) (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) were used in this study. Animal protocol and procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Kentucky. Animals were housed two/cage on a 12 h light/dark cycle and provided access to food and waterad libitum. Rats were subjected to a moderate unilateral controlled cortical impact (CCI) utilizing an electronic controlled pneumatic impact device (ECPI) (TBI0310, Precision System & Instrumentation, Fairfax Station, VA) with a hard stop Bimba cylinder (Bimba Manufacturing, Monee, IL). Each animal was anesthetized with 2% isofluorane and placed in a Kopf stereotaxic frame (Tujunga, CA) with the incisor bar set at \u22125. Body temperature for each rat was monitored and maintained at 36\u00b0C with a Space Gel heating pad (Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA). Following a midline incision and retraction of the skin, a 6-mm-diameter craniotomy was made lateral to midline and approximately midway between bregma and lamda with a Michele hand trephine (Miltex, NY). The skull disk was removed without disturbing the dura. The exposed brain was injured with the ECPI device using a 5-mm-diameter beveled tip that compressed the cortex to a depth of 2.0 mm at a velocity of 3.5 m/s. Following the injury, the craniotomy site was sealed with MASCOT adhesive (EMS, Hatfield, PA) and an 8mm disc formed from clear polyester (0.5 mm) (Midwest Products, Hobart, IN). The surgical procedure was completed in 15\u201320 min.\n\nAt 15 min post injury, rats received a single intravenous (i.v.) injection of either vehicle (saline) or PYC (10mg/kg) (gift from Horphag Research Inc., USA) and allowed to recover in their home cage. The dosage was based upon therapeutic effects of PYC as previously described (Ansari et al., 2013).\n\nHippocampal slice preparation\nMethods for preparing hippocampal slices from rats are similar to those used in our previous work.(\nMathis et al., 2011\n;\nNorris et al., 2010\n;\nNorris and Scheff, 2009\n;\nSama et al., 2012\n) At either 7 or 14 days after CCI injury, rats were euthanized under CO\n2\nanesthesia. Brains were then rapidly removed and stored briefly in ice-cold, oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM) 124 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.25 KH2PO4, 2 MgSO4, 0.5 CaCl2, 26 NaHCO3, and 10 dextrose (pH 7.4). Coronal hippocampal slices (450-\u03bcm thick) from both hemispheres were cut parallel to the alvear fibers using a McIlwain Tissue Chopper (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) and transferred to netting in a custom holding chamber.(\nMathis et al., 2011\n) Slices were bathed in oxygenated ACSF (containing 2mM CaCl) at an interface with warm (32\u00b0C), humidified air and permitted to equilibrate for at least 1.5h before transfer to an RC-22 recording chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) for electrophysiological analysis.\n\nField potential recordings\nSlices were submerged in oxygenated ACSF (32\u00b0C) and perfused at a rate of 1\u20132mL/min. Schaffer collaterals were activated with a bipolar platinum/iridium electrode located in\nstratum radiatum\nof CA3-CA1 border. Stimulus intensity was controlled by a constant current stimulus isolation unit (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), and stimulus timing was controlled by Clampex 9.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Field potentials were recorded in CA1\nstratum radiatum\nusing a glass micropipette (1\u20136M\u03a9), filled with ACSF and containing a Ag/AgCl wire. Physiologic activity was amplified 100\u00d7, Bessel-filtered at 1kHz, and digitized at 10kHz using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier and a Digidata 1320 digitizer (Molecular Devices).\n\nFiber excitability and synaptic strength measures\nMethods for assessing presynaptic fiber excitability and basal synaptic strength were similar to those used in our previous work.(\nFurman et al., 2012\n;\nNorris and Scheff, 2009\n;\nSama et al., 2012\n) For each slice, twin stimulus pulses (S1 and S2), separated by 50ms, were delivered at nine different intensity levels (range 30\u2013500\u03bcA) at a rate of 0.1Hz. Five field potentials at each stimulus level were averaged, and measurements of fiber volley (FV) amplitude (in mV) and excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) slope (mV/ms) were performed offline using Clampfit software (Molecular Devices). FV amplitudes were plotted against stimulation intensity to estimate the relative level of presynaptic excitability, and EPSP slope measures were plotted against their corresponding FV amplitudes to estimate the relative strength of existing CA3-CA1 synaptic contacts. Fiber excitability and synaptic strength curves for each hemisphere were fit (SigmaPlot 12, Systat Software Inc. San Jose, CA) with a sigmoidal equation of the form:\na\n(\n1\n+\nexp\n(\n-\nx\n-\nx\n0\nb\n)\n)\nwhere\na\nequals the maximal amplitude of the distribution,\nb\nequals the distribution slope,\nx\nequals the stimulation intensity (or FV amplitude), and\nx0\nequals the stimulation intensity (or FV amplitude) required for half-maximal response amplitude. Maximal synaptic strength for each slice was also estimated by taking the maximal EPSP slope amplitude during the input/output curve and dividing by the corresponding FV amplitude. Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) was calculated by dividing the S2 EPSP slope by the S1 EPSP and multiplying by 100. To estimate population spike (PS) threshold, the EPSP slope amplitude at which a population spike first appeared in the ascending phase of the field potential was calculated and averaged across five successive trials at the spike threshold stimulation level.\n\nInduction and measurement of long-term depression (LTD)\nMethods for inducing and measuring LTD are similar to those used in our previous work (\nNorris et al., 1996\n;\nSama et al., 2012\n). Following input/output curves, single stimulus pulses were delivered at a rate of 0.033 Hz to establish a baseline. While the \u00bd maximal stimulus intensity from the input/output curve is often used for setting the baseline and LTD stimulation levels, we instead used the stimulus intensity necessary to elicit an approximately 1 mV EPSP. This procedure was implemented to minimize possible hemispheric differences in the level of postsynaptic depolarization achieved during LTD induction (see discussion in (\nMathis et al., 2011\n;\nNorris and Scheff, 2009\n). It is well-established that the induction of both LTD and long-term potentiation (LTP) are strongly dependent on postsynaptic depolarization levels (\nMalinow and Miller, 1986\n;\nMulkey and Malenka, 1992\n;\nWigstrom and Gustafsson, 1986\n). We have previously reported that, relative to the contralateral hemisphere, slices from the ipsilateral hippocampus following TBI typically show reduced EPSP amplitudes (less depolarization) in response to the same level of presynaptic stimulation at 7 days post-CCI (\nNorris and Scheff, 2009\n). Using the \u00bd maximal stimulus intensity in the CCI model would therefore necessarily lead to the elicitation of smaller EPSP amplitudes during LTD stimulation for ipsilateral relative to contralateral slices, which may negatively affect the extent to which postsynaptic plasticity mechanisms are engaged.\nAfter a stable baseline period of no less than 20 min, slices received a 15 minute train of 1 Hz stimulation at baseline stimulation intensity, followed by another 60 min baseline period (stimulation rate = 0.033 Hz). Within each hemisphere, EPSP measures from the last 10 min of the post-1 Hz stimulation baseline were averaged across slices and expressed as a percentage of the pre-1 Hz stimulation baseline level.\n\nStatistics\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using Prism V6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). For each animal, electrophysiological measures, including synaptic strength parameters, were averaged across all slices within each hemisphere (one to four slices) and the sample size (\nn\n) used for all statistical comparisons reflects the number of animals used per post-injury time point. During LTD experiments, some slices showed excessive upward or downward drift (>20% over the pre or post-1 Hz baseline) and were excluded from statistical analyses without regard to treatment/injury group. Effects of injury and PYC treatment were determined by two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Where appropriate, the Protected Fisher\u2019s Least Significant Difference test was used for\npost hoc\ncomparisons. Significance for all statistical comparisons was set at\np\n< 0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nSprague-Dawley (n=46) and Wistar Kyoto (n=51) na\u00efve male rats were obtained from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN) at three months of age. Rats were individually housed under a 12:12hr light:dark cycle (lights on at 0700) and allowed free access to food and water. Prior to experimentation, all rats were given one week to acclimate. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the IACUC of the Veterans Affairs New Jersey Health Care System.\n\nElectrophysiological Recording\nElectrophysiology protocol was as previously described\nCominski et al. (2014)\nwith minor adaptations. Na\u00efve rats were anesthetized with urethane (1.5g/kg, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. A recording electrode (75\u03bcm, Teflon coated stainless steel wire) was inserted into the PL cortex (3.20 mm anterior and 0.5mm lateral from bregma, 3.0\u20133.5mm ventral from the brain surface) and a stimulating electrode (125\u03bcm, Teflon coated stainless steel wire) was inserted into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) (2.30 mm posterior and 4.9mm lateral from bregma, 7.0\u20138.0mm).\nConstant current stimulation (biphasic pulse, 300\u03bcs duration) was delivered to the BLA (AM Systems Isolated Pulse Stimulator, 2100, Carlsborg, WA) at a rate of 1/10sec (or 1 pair/10s for paired pulse stimulation). Signals were amplified a total of 10,000X and bandpass filtered between 0.1\u20135000Hz (AM Systems Differential AC Amplifier, Model 1700, Carlsborg WA). Field potentials were visualized on a digital oscilloscope and recorded for off-line analysis (SciWorks software, version 7.2 SP1, DataWave Technologies). All analysis was performed on average waveforms (average of 6 individual responses). An input-output curve was generated using 200 \u20131000\u03bcA BLA stimulation. Paired-pulse responses were assessed for 50\u20131000ms interpulse intervals at a stimulus intensity that produced 50% maximal response amplitude, as determined by the input-output curve. The effect of paired pulse stimulation is expressed as amplitude of second response/amplitude of first response x 100. Stimulation parameters for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) were based on\nMaroun and Richter-Levin (2003)\n. Theta burst stimulation (TBS) delivered to the BLA consisted of three sets of 10 trains with an interset interval of 1min and an intertrain interval of 200ms; each train consisted of 10 pulses at 100Hz. The effects of TBS were evaluated for 60 or 120min. Data are expressed as the percent of average baseline response: (amplitude of response /amplitude of averaged baseline) x 100. To confirm electrode placement lesions were made (30s, 500\u03bcA) at the conclusion of all recordings.\n\nPharmacological Manipulation\nD-cycloserine (15mg/kg, intraperitoneal, i.p, Sigma, USA) was dissolved in sterile saline and administered to na\u00efve rats following electrode optimization. This dose has previously been shown to reverse impairments in NMDA-dependent LTP (\nYamamoto et al., 2008\n;\nRichter-Levin and Maroun, 2010\n). Control rats received an equivalent volume of saline (i.p). Recordings started 40min post injection.\n\nMicrodialysis and Neurochemical Analysis of Amino Acid Neurotransmitters from the PL Cortex\nSurgeries were identical to that described under the electrophysiology procedure. A CMA 11 Guide Cannula and a 1mm CMA 11 Microdialysis Probe (Holliston, MA) was lowered into PL cortex of na\u00efve rats. Sterile CNS Perfusion Fluid (CMA Microdialysis AB, Holliston, MA) was perfused into the PL cortex at a flow rate of 1.2ml/min using a CMA 402 Syringe Pump (Holliston, MA). Sampling occurred 1 hr after insertion of probes. Dialysate samples were collected in 20min intervals and immediately stored at \u221280\u00b0c for later analyses. A total of 3 samples were collected in each subject.\nAnalysis was performed as previously described (\nRowley et al., 1995\n). Dialysate (24\u03bcl) was reacted with o-phthalaldehyde (1.0\u03bcl) for 10min at room temperature. Derivatized samples were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-EC). The system consisted of a Waters Breeze pump (Milford, MA) that pumped mobile phase through an autosampler (model #717, Milford, MA), C18 column, and electrochemical detector set to 900nA (model #464, Milford, MA). The mobile phase consisted of monosodium phosphate (1.0M) and EDTA (0.1M) with 25% methanol; pH was adjusted to 4.5 with glacial acidic acid. A PC computer with Waters Empower software was used for data acquisition and analysis. Peak heights were used to determine quantities of d-serine, glycine, glutamate, and GABA. All values were corrected for differences in probe recovery rates. Data are expressed as pmol/\u03bcl.\n\nProtein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis of NMDA Receptor Subunits from the PL Cortex\nBrains were dissected from na\u00efve rats and immediately placed on ice. Tissue was blocked to expose the prefrontal cortex and PL was extracted by tissue punch. All tissue was immediately placed on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0c for later analysis.\nProtein was isolated by homogenizing tissue in 200\u03bcl of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 150mM NaCl, 10mM Hepes buffer, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.1% sodium doedecyl sulfate,deoxycholic acid, 50mM NaF, 1% NP40, and a protease inhibitor cocktail. The homogenate was frozen in a slurry of 2-methylbutane and dry ice and thawed at 37\u00b0C three times. Lysates were then vortexed and incubated on ice for 15s five times. Then lysates were sonicated and placed on ice for 30min after which it was centrifuged. The supernatant was removed, aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Total protein concentrations were determined utilizing the BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). Samples (20\u03bcg) were loaded on each lane of a 3\u20138% tris-acetate gel (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Electrophoresis was performed for 60min at 150V. The protein was then electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, and stained with Swift membrane stain (G-Bioscience, St. Louis, MO). After blocking for 1hr in 5% milk powder, membranes were probed with primary antibodies against NR2A, NR2B, and NR1, (Millipore, Temecula, CA: 1:1000) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The membranes were then incubated with donkey anti-rabbit labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA: 1/500 dilution) and the signal was visualized using ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL USA) and by exposure to HyBlot CL\u00aeAutoradiography Film (Denville, South Plainfield, NJ). The membranes were then stripped with Re-Blot Plus Western Blot Mild Antibody Stripping Solution (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA) and re-probed with an antibody against Beta Tubulin III (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA, 1:20000) to account for minor loading variability. The intensity of the bands was quantified using the UNSCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT, USA).\n\nPrelimbic (PL) Cortex Lesions\nBilateral PL cortex lesions occurred as previously described by\nBeck et al. (2014)\n. Briefly, rats were anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and placed into a stereotaxic apparatus. A Hamiliton microsyringe was lowered at a rate of 0.2mm/min on a 10\u00b0 angle (toward midline) at the following coordinates: A/P: +2.9mm, L: \u00b11.0mm, DV \u22124.0mm. A total of 0.2 \u03bcl of ibotenic acid (5 mg/ml) was injected at each site.\n\nActive Lever-Press Avoidance\nThe avoidance protocol was identical to previously described reports in\nBeck et al. (2014)\nand\nPang et al. (2011)\n. Briefly, training sessions were separated by 2\u20133 days, with 20 trials per session. At the start of each session, rats were placed individually in operant chambers (Coulbourn, Whitehall, PA). Each trial started with the onset of an auditory warning signal. Sixty seconds after the start of the warning signal, intermittent shock (every 3s, 1.0 mA intensity and 0.5s duration) was delivered through a grid floor. A lever press made at this time immediately terminated shock and warning signal and initiated the intertrial interval; this type of response represented an escape response. Lever presses made less than 60s after the start of the trial (i.e., prior to the shock period) prevented shocks from occurring, terminated the warning signal and initiated the intertrial interval; this type of response constituted an avoidance response. The intertrial interval was 3min in duration and cued by a flashing light. Acquisition training consisted of 12 sessions.\nDuring extinction training, all procedures were the same as during the acquisition phase, except foot shock was omitted. Responses during the first 60s of the warning signal were classified as \u201cavoidance\u201d responses, and those with latencies greater than 60s were designated as \u201cescape\u201d responses. Extinction training consisted of 10 sessions.\n\nHistology\nBrains were checked for accuracy of lesions, electrodes and microdialysis probes. Rats were sacrificed and brains were quickly extracted, then stored in 10% phosphate buffered formalin. Brains were sectioned using a sliding microtome and mounted onto slides coated with gelatin. Sections were stained with cresyl violet, dehydrated, cover slipped, and viewed under a light microscope. Rats with electrode or probe placement found outside the target area were removed. Similarly, rats with lesions found to significantly disrupt the neighboring infralimbic (IL) cortex or anterior cingulate cortex were removed from the study. Lesion volume was also assessed in SD rats using the Cavalieri method (StereoInvestigator, MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nData are expressed as mean \u00b1 1 standard error of the mean. Statistics were performed using SPSS for Mac (Version 20, IBM) with an alpha level of 0.05 For electrophysiology, statistics were performed on averaged amplitude values of BLA-evoked responses. Violations of sphericity determined by Mauchly\u2019s Test were adjusted using the Greenhouse-Geisser correction. When post-hoc analysis was required, the Fisher\u2019s LSD Multiple Comparison Test was used. The input-output data were assessed using a 2 (Strain) x 5 (Stimulus Intensity) or 2 (Strain) x 2 (Treatment) x 5 (Stimulus Intensity) mixed-design ANOVA. Paired pulse data was evaluated using a 2 (Strain) x 2 (Order) x 6 (ISI) mixed-design ANOVA. The presence of LTP was assessed in each strain using a repeated measures ANOVA with time as a factor. To determine whether long-lasting potentiation differed between the two strains a 2 (Strain) x 2 (Time) mixed-design ANOVA was performed on response amplitudes comparing baseline (5min prior to TBS) to 60 min post-TBS. To determine if BLA-evoked potentials at 60 min were significantly potentiated above baseline (5 min prior to TBS) a paired samples t-test was performed for each strain. In the second experiment, the effects of DCS on LTP were assessed for each strain using a 2 (Treatment) x 27 (Time) mixed-design ANOVA. To determine whether long-lasting potentiation differed between DCS and vehicle treated rats of each strain a 2 (Treatment) x 2 (Time) mixed-design ANOVA was performed comparing baseline (5min prior to TBS) to 120 min post-TBS. To determine if BLA-evoked potentials at 60 min were significantly potentiated above baseline (5 min prior to TBS) a paired samples t-test was performed for all groups. Microdialysis results were assessed by independent samples t-test. NMDA receptor subunit data was assessed by a 2 (Strain) x 2 (Blot) ANOVA. For the analysis of avoidance performance, sessions were blocked into groups of 2 sessions resulting in 6 session blocks for acquisition and 5 session blocks for extinction. Avoidance acquisition was assessed by a 2 (Strain) x 2 (Lesion) x 6 (Session Block) mixed-design ANOVA. Avoidance extinction was assessed by a 2 (Strain) x 2 (Lesion) x 5 (Session Block) mixed-design ANOVA. In addition, a Pearson\u2019s r was calculated to assess the relationship between lesion volume and extinction performance in SD rats. Extinction performance was calculated by computing the percent change in avoidance between the last acquisition session and the last extinction session"

    "Methods": "Generation and genotyping of\nTrx-2\ntransgenic mice\nFounder mice in which the human\nTrx-2\ngene (GenBank:\nNC_000022\n) was expressed using regulatory elements from the human \u03b2-actin promotor were created by Xenogene Biosciences Laboratories. A 3702 bp microinjection fragment (MIF) containing the human\nTrx-2\ncDNA was isolated from the plasmid (Invitrogen pDRIVE03-\u03b2-actin(h) V02) by\nSpeI\nand\nSwaI\nrestriction enzyme digestion. The MIF was injected into fertilized mouse eggs from C57BL/6 donors, and implanted into pseudopregnant females. Chimeric pups were bred to generate heterozygous offspring. Mice were maintained on a 12 hour light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. All procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute on Aging and were performed in accordance with the NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Male hTRX-2 mice were bred to C56BL/6J female mice to generate offspring for these studies. Male mice were used for all experiments.\nOne month-old mice were genotyped by assaying for the presence of the mitochondrial\nhTrx-2\nsequence by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genomic DNA was extracted from mouse tail snips by standard protocols. Briefly, tail snips were placed in DirectPCR Lysis Reagent (tail) (Viagen Biotech.Inc., cat# 101-T) containing 0.3 mg/ml Proteinase K (Sigma, Cat# p6556) and incubated overnight at 65 \u00b0C until complete lysis was achieved; DNA was centrifuged (7,500 x g for 5 min) and the supernatant was transferred to a clean 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. A PCR amplification was performed in a 25 \u03bcl reaction using 1 \u03bcl of DNA lysate, with the following primers:\nhTrx-2\nspecific forward primer 0.1 \u03bcl (20 \u03bcM) (5\u2032-OH CCAATCTGAAACCTCGTGC OH-3\u2032);\nhTrx-2\nspecific reverse primer 0.1 \u03bcl (20 \u03bcM) (5\u2032\u2013OH AAACCTCCCACACCTCCC OH-3\u2032), and 10 \u03bcl of Promega GoTaq Green Master Kit solution (Promega, cat# M7122). The mixture was subjected to the following PCR conditions: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes; 35 repeated cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 50 s; primer annealing at 58\u00b0C for 50 s and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 60 s; and a final extension cycle of 72\u00b0C for 5 min. Subsequently, 25 \u03bcl of the amplification reaction was analyzed on a 1.2% agarose \u2013 ethidium bromide gel to establish the presence or absence of a 360 bp PCR product indicative of the presence of the human\nTrx-2\ngene.\n\nDiets\nBeginning at 5 months of age, mice were maintained for 8 months on either standard chow or a HCD. Mice on the HCD were fed a high fat diet purchased from Dyets Inc. (diet #101842) and were provided drinking water containing 11% of a 1:1 mixture of fructose and glucose.\n\nImmunoblot analysis\nHippocampal tissue was homogenized in RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors. The amount of total proteins in the homogenates was estimated with a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology). Protein samples were separated in a 4\u201320% acrylamide gradient gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Following incubation with blocking buffer (5% dry milk and 0.05% Tween20 in PBS), the membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in the blocking buffer containing a 1:800 dilution of TRX-2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, #13322). The amino acid sequence of human TRX2 is 98% identical to mouse TRX2. The antibody used in the present study was generated against a synthetic peptide with an amino acid sequence identical to a conserved sequence in the carboxyl terminus of TRX2. The membrane was then washed (0.1% Tween20 in PBS) and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The proteins were visualized using a chemiluminescence kit from Pierce. The intensities of protein bands were analyzed using ImageJ software.\n\nDiquat treatment and F\n2\n-isoprostane assay\nGroups of TRX-2 transgenic mice and their wild type littermates (6\u20138 months of age) were injected intraperitoneally with diquat dissolved in saline and administered at a dose of 50 mg/kg. Three and six hours after injection, the mice were sacrificed and liver tissue and blood were taken for assay. F\n2\n-isoprostanes were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods as described previously (\nMorrow and Roberts, 1994\n). The isoprostane levels were measured in samples of 100 mg wet weight of tissue or 1 ml of plasma. Tissue was homogenized in chloroform:methanol containing BHT (0.005%) to prevent auto-oxidation, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and re-suspended in methanol containing BHT. Esterified F\n2\n-isoprostanes in phospholipids were saponified by adding aqueous potassium hydroxide (this frees fatty acids from lipids). The sample was acidified and diluted with water. Deuterated-F\n2\n-isoprostane internal standard was then added to the mixture. For the measurement of free F\n2-\nisoprotanes in plasma, the extraction and hydrolysis steps were omitted, and the sample was simply acidified, diluted, and the internal standard added. The mixture was subsequently run on a silica column to separate isoprostanes from bulk fatty acids. The eluate was converted to pentafluorobenzyl esters, by treatment with pentafluorobenzyl bromide (this step was necessary because free fatty acids are difficult to separate by gas chromatography). The mixture was subjected to thin layer chromatography to remove the excess pentafluorobenzyl bromide and unreacted fatty acids. The F\n2\n-isoprotane/isofurane fraction was extracted using ethyl acetate, and analyzed by injection into a Thermo Finnigan TRACE DSQ single quadrupole mass spectrometer. This instrument is capable of electron impact and chemical ionization, with positive and negative ion detection. The F\n2\n-isoprostanes were quantified by peak height, and the data were corrected with the internal standard and expressed as nanograms of F\n2\n-isoprostanes per mL of plasma or per gram tissue.\n\nHippocampal slice electrophysiology\nThese methods were similar to those described previously (\nWang et al., 2009\n;\nZhang et al., 2011\n). Briefly, Transverse hippocampal slices (350 \u03bcm) were maintained in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (mM): 120 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 1.3 MgSO\n4\n, 2.5 CaCl\n2\nand 10 glucose (pH 7.4; osmolality was 290 mmol/kg). Field potential recordings were performed at 30\u201332\u00b0C in a perfusion chamber. For LTP experiments, 50 \u03bcM picrotoxin was added in ACSF to block GABA\nA\nreceptors. Only slices in which field recordings exhibited a steep input-output curve were included. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were recorded in CA1 stratum radiatum with stimuli (30 \u03bcs duration every 20 s) delivered with a bipolar tungsten electrode to activate Schaffer collateral/commissural afferents. LTP was induced with a train of tetanic stimulation (100 Hz for 1s). Plots were normalized to the initial slope of the EPSPs with each data point representing the averaged values for 1 min (three consecutive sweeps with an interval of 20 sec). Data were collected using an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Molecular Device); signals were filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz and analyzed using pCLAMP 8 software (Molecular Devices).\n\nBehavioral tests\nThese methods have been described previously (Okun et al., 2010). Briefly, for the novel object recognition test the mice were habituated to the experimental room and 25 cm \u00d7 25 cm opaque walled test cages for 3 consecutive days, 30 minutes each time and for 1 hour on the testing day. These experiments were conducted under a light intensity of 15 lux. Mice were first allowed to explore their cage in the presence of two identical objects and were then returned to their home cages for 10 minutes (short-term memory). The mice were then placed in the test cage with one familiar object and a novel object for 150 seconds. Twenty four hours later (long-term memory) the mice were placed in the test cage with one familiar object and a novel object for 150 seconds. Object preferences were automatically analyzed using Anymaze video tracking software. An object preference index was determined by calculating the time spent near the novel object divided by the cumulative time spent near both objects. For open field testing mice were placed in the center of an open field (MED-OFA-MS system; Med-associates, St. Albans, VT, USA) under a light intensity of 400 lux and exploration was assessed for 15 minutes. Cages were cleaned with ethanol following each session. The open field was 40 cm \u00d7 40 cm, and the peripheral 10 cm was designated as the peripheral zone and the central 30 cm\n2\nwas designateds the central zone.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni post hoc analysis were performed using Graphpad Prism 5.0 (La Jolla, CA, USA) with significance set at p < 0.05."

    "Methods": "Isolation and characterization of MSCs\nSyngeneic MSCs were isolated from an aspirate of bone marrow harvested from the tibia and femoral marrow compartments of 4-week-old BALB/c mice (Jacksons Laboratory), the immunocompetent cell recipients in this study. Bone marrow was cultured in a medium with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) and 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for three days at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO\n2\nincubator. After three days, non-adherent cells were removed and fresh medium was replaced. When primary cultures became 80-90% confluent, cells were treated with TrypLE\n\u2122\nExpress (Gibco) for five minutes at 37\u00b0C, harvested, washed with 10 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH=7.4, and replated. An adherent population of MSCs was obtained three weeks after the initiation of culture. For characterization, MSCs (1 \u00d7 10\n6\ncells) were incubated in 2% FBS in PBS at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes with 1 \u03bcl of monoclonal antibody specific for CD34, CD45, CD90, and CD105 (Novus Biological), or left unstained, and were analyzed by FACSCalibur with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).\n\nIsolation and characterization of GRPs\nAllogeneic GRPs were isolated from the cortical region of the brain of a homozygous firefly luciferase transgenic mouse (FVB background, Jackson Laboratories, strain 008450) at the E13.5 stage, as described elsewhere (\nMujtaba et al., 1999\n). Cells were maintained in serum-free DMEM-F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with N2, B27, bovine serum albumin, and bFGF (Invitogen) as previously described (\nLepore et al., 2006\n). GRPs were characterized using an immunocytochemical assay. In brief, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating a solution of 10% donkey serum and 0.1% Triton X-100-PBS for two hours at room temperature. Cells were incubated with the appropriate dilutions of primary antibodies in blocking solution overnight at 4\u00b0C, then rinsed with PBS and incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor-488 and Alexa Fluro-546, Invitrogen) in blocking buffer for one hour at room temperature. The culture was rinsed three times with PBS and images were obtained with a Zeiss AX10 fluorescence microscope. Primary antibodies used for these experiments were: anti-A2B5 (1:1000, Santa Cruz); anti-Olig1 (1:1000, EMD Milipore); and anti-firefly luciferase (1:3000, GeneTex).\n\nBioluminescent imaging (BLI) of GRPs\nin vitro\nTransgenic luciferase expressing GRPs were plated into poly L-lysine/laminin-coated 96-well plates at 10,000, 1,000, 100, and 10 cells per well. For bioluminescence measurements, the medium was removed and 0.15 mg/ml D-luciferin in PBS was added. The luminescence signal was measured using an IVIS Spectrum/CT instrument (Perkin Elmer). Images were acquired at one-minute intervals for 10 minutes until peak signal was observed. BLI was quantified by drawing of regions of interest (ROIs) over the wells, with data were expressed as photon flux (p/sec).\n\nCell transplantation\nTwenty immunocompetent male BALB/c (4weeks old, Jacksons Laboratory) and eight male immunodeficient Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice (4-6 weeks old, Taconic) were used in this study. Animals were divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group was subdivided into: (i) immunocompetent mice transplanted with MSC+GRP (n=10); (ii) immunocompetent mice transplanted with GRP alone (n=10); and a non-immunorejection control group subdivided into (i) immunodeficient mice transplanted with MSC+GRP (n=4); and (ii) immunodeficient mice transplanted with GRP only (n=4).\nAll animal procedures were conducted according to an approved protocol from our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in oxygen, shaved and stabilized in a Cunningham adaptor mounted on a stereotactic frame (Stoelting). MSCs and GRPs were harvested, washed, and suspended in PBS at a density of 1\u00d710\n5\ncells/\u03bcl. A 2 \u03bcl cell suspension containing 1 \u03bcl MSCs and 1\u03bcl GRPs or 1 \u03bcl GRPs and 1 \u03bcl PBS was injected into the brain (AP=0 mm; ML=2.2 mm; DV=2.0 mm) at a rate of 0.5 \u03bcl/min using a Hamilton 31G microinjection needle (Hamilton) and a nano-injector (Stoelting). The needle was kept in place for two min after injection to minimize backflow and then withdrawn slowly. Rectal temperature was monitored and maintained between 36.5 and 37.5 \u00b0C using a self-regulating heated blanket (Harvard Apparatus) for the duration of surgery. No immunosuppressive drugs were given to any animal before or after surgery. Animals were kept in a normal day-night cycle (12/12 hours) with ad libitum access to food and water.\n\nBLI of transplanted GRPs\nin vivo\nBioluminescent images were acquired using an IVIS Spectrum/CT instrument (Perkin Elmer). Animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane gas in oxygen, and 150 mg/kg D-luciferin (Gold Bioechnology) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.). Images were acquired 10 min after injection at the peak of the bioluminescence signal. To generate 2D bioluminescent images, no emission filter was used during imaging. Images were quantified by drawing ROIs over the brain region, with data expressed as photon flux (p/sec). To generate 3D bioluminescent images, four spectrally resolved images were acquired using emission filters at 600, 620, 640, and 660 nm, with a bandwidth of 20 nm each. Imaging parameters were an exposure time of 180 s, an aperture of f/1, a FOV=13 cm, and 2048\u00d72048 pixel resolution. Pixel binning was set to an 8\u00d78 bin width for an effective image resolution of 256\u00d7256 pixels. Imaging parameters were identical for both 2D and 3D imaging.\n\nComputed tomography (CT)\nMicro-CT images were acquired on the same IVIS Spectrum/CT instrument (Perkin Elmer) using 50 kVp x-rays at 1 mA of current, 50 ms exposure time using an aluminum filter. A total of 720 projections spaced 0.5\u00b0 apart were acquired and the CT volume was reconstructed using Living Image 4.3 software (Perkin Elmer Inc.), at a field of view (FOV) of 12.0\u00d712.0\u00d73.0 cm and an isotropic resolution of 0.15 mm.\n\nThree-dimensional micro-CT/BLI reconstruction\nThree-dimensional reconstruction of the bioluminescent signal with superposition on the CT images was performed using the DLIT algorithm in Living Image 4.3 software. The software predefined the bioluminescent source and tissue absorption spectra for the luciferase reporter and mouse tissue. The source distribution was visualized in Living Image using a voxel size of 0.31 mm without smoothing.\n\n(Immuno)histochemistry\nAt day 21 post-transplantation, mice were anesthetized and perfused intracardially with PBS followed by PBS-buffered 4% PFA. Brains were removed, postfixed overnight at 4\u00b0C, and cryopreserved in 30% sucrose. Serial coronal sections, 20 \u03bcm thick, were cut using a Thermo Scientific HM 550 Cryostat. For immunohistochemistry, nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating with a solution of 10% donkey serum and 0.1% Triton X-100-PBS for two hours at room temperature. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the appropriate dilution of primary antibody in blocking solution. The corresponding secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor-488 and Alexa Fluro-546, Invitrogen) were added at a ratio of 1:200 in blocking solution for two hours at room temperature. Sections were then rinsed with 0.1 M PBS and placed on coverslips with aqueous non-fluorescing mounting medium (Immu-mount, Thermo Scientific). Images were obtained with a Zeiss AX10 fluorescence microscope. Primary antibodies used for these experiments were: anti-firefly luciferase (1:3000, GeneTex); anti-CD45 (1:500,Serotec); anti-CD11b (1:300, Biolegend); anti-GFAP (1:1000, Santa Cruz); anti-CD8 (1:500, Serotec); and anti-FoxP3 (1:1000, Abcam).\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the correlation between the variables. A Student\u2019s t-test was used for determining significance, set at p < 0.05 using GraphPad Prism software (version 6.0c)."

    "Methods": "Neural cultures\nNeural cultures were prepared from the cortex/hippocampus of E17 rat fetuses. Pregnant female Long-Evans rats were lethally anesthetized with isoflurane and the uterus removed and placed in ice cold HEPES-buffered Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS). The brain was harvested from each fetus, rinsed three times in fresh sterile HBSS and the forebrain containing the cortex, hippocampus and basal ganglia transferred to a 15 ml tube containing calcium-magnesium free HBSS (CMF-HBSS), 1.25 U/ml dispase II + 2 U/ml DNase I. After incubation for 25\u201330 min at 37\u00b0 C the cells were gently dissociated by several rounds of trituration and seeded into poly-D-lysine-coated culture dishes at a density of 50,000 \u2013 100,000 cells/cm\n2\nfor toxicity analysis or 20,000 cells/cm\n2\non poly-D-lysine-treated coverslips for imaging. The resulting cultures were typically >90% neurons at 6 days in culture (average value for representative cultures was 96 \u00b1 2% neurons). Cultures were fed with Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) with glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin, 50% exchange, three times per week. Cells were allowed to grow at least 6 days\nin vitro\n, at which time they show extensive synaptophysin immunoreactivity and excellent responses to gp120, macrophage-conditioned medium and glutamate receptor agonists.\nInitially, a challenge with the HIV envelope protein gp120 (200 pM) was selected to assess neuroprotection due to previously demonstrated effects on neurotrophins and the large body of data available for the toxic effects of this protein. To determine the most effective stimulus and the earliest changes associated with neural damage, different strains of gp120 were compared using intracellular calcium accumulation and cell death as endpoints. This comparison helped to rule out the possibility that toxicity and protective effects may be unique to particular subtypes of gp120. The effects of the gp120 were also contrasted to the toxic effects previously seen with CSF from HIV-infected patients(\nMeeker et al., 2005\n) to determine if similar toxic effects were present. In addition, gp120 was applied to monocyte-derived macrophages with subsequent testing of the conditioned medium on neural cultures. A direct comparison of the toxicity of the conditioned medium to direct application of gp120 showed that the conditioned medium produced similar effects but was much more potent. Thus, the neuroprotective effects of LM11A-31 in the sensitive calcium assays were assessed using the more potent conditioned medium.\n\nSources and types of gp120\nSince both CXCR4- and CCR5-preferring subtypes of gp120 have been shown to be toxic to neurons but may have slightly different actions(\nKaul et al., 2007\n), we compared the pathogenic effects of each subtype to determine if there was a common effect leading to neural dysfunction. Four subtypes of gp120 were obtained from the AIDS Reference Reagent Program. Two subtypes, gp120\nIIIB\nand gp120\nMN\nrepresented CXCR4-preferring subtypes and two subtypes, gp120\nBaL\nand gp120\nSF162\nrepresented CCR5-preferring subtypes. A separate supply of full length, glycosylated gp120\nLAV\n(sequence similar to gp120\nIIIB\n) was also obtained from Protein Sciences (Meriden, CT). The gp120\nIIIB\nand gp120\nLAV\nboth yielded similar effects. A challenge concentration of 200 pM was chosen based on previous work(\nDigicaylioglu et al., 2004\n;\nDreyer et al., 1990\n;\nGarden et al., 2002\n;\nKaul and Lipton, 1999\n;\nMeucci and Miller, 1996\n). To avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles, a 100X stock was prepared in an artificial CSF (aCSF, concentrations in mM: NaCl 137, KCl 5.0, CaCl\n2\n2.3, MgCl\n2\n1.3, glucose 20, HEPES 10, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH), aliquoted and stored frozen until use. In some experiments, lipopolysacchraride (LPS 0.1 \u03bcg/ml) and rat interferon-\u03b3 (INF, 20 U/ml) were applied to the cultures to provide a strong positive control for inflammatory damage.\n\nConditioned medium from human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM)\nHuman peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors were purchased from the New York Blood Center (Long Island City, NY). Research was approved by the center prior to acquisition and the blood was shipped with no identifiers of any kind. Approximately 10\n8\nPBMCs were obtained, washed and cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS in 6-well plates on low adhesion plastic. Monocytes were allowed to adhere for a period of 5\u20137 days after which they were transferred to DMEM containing 15 ng/ml recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and differentiated for an additional 5 days. After differentiation the macrophages were returned to DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum. These mature macrophages were then washed and treated with 200 pM gp120 in 2 mls DMEM + 1% FBS per well (without GM-CSF) for a period of 3 days. The resulting medium was collected, aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0. Cultures treated identically but with no gp120 stimulation were used as controls.\nFor MDM-neuron co-cultures, rat MDM were isolated from 14\u201316 mls of blood and cultured in a similar fashion. Cells were harvested from the low adhesion plates in calcium-magnesium free Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution (CMF-HBSS) at 4\u00b0 C (~20\u201330 min), centrifuged and the pellet re-suspended in aCSF at a density of 5000 cells/ml at room temperature. The cells were then seeded onto the neuronal cultures at a density of approximately 1000 cells/cm\n2\n(4% of the neuron density) to observe direct interactions of macrophages with neurons.\n\nMeasurement of cell death\nTo assess cell death in response to a challenge, the live culture was stained by adding 1 \u03bcM ethidium homodimer to the medium for a period of 20 min followed by washing and fixation in 70% ethanol. Nuclei of dead cells show an intense red fluorescence. In some experiments nuclei were stained with 0.5\u20131 \u03bcM bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258) or Sytox green for double labeling studies. Counting of dead cells was accomplished by systematically sampling the left, right, top, bottom and middle of each well at an image magnification of 195X. The five readings were then averaged to provide a single value for each well. Metamorph Image Analysis software (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA) was used to identify stained nuclei using brightness and object size discriminators. The total number of objects that met the criteria for a stained nucleus was automatically counted. This procedure provided a relatively unbiased estimate of the stained nuclei for approximately 18% of the total surface of each well of a 96 well plate, representing approximately 2800 total neurons.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nNeurons were identified by microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) immunostaining. Cells were fixed in ice cold 97% methanol, 3% acetic for 10 min at room temperature and washed in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 3\u00d75 min). After incubation in blocking buffer containing 3% normal goat serum in 0.01 M PBS for 60 min polyclonal rabbit anti-MAP-2 (Chemicon/Millipore, Bilerica, MA) was applied at a dilution of 1:500 in blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit at 1:500 for 1 h at room temp or goat anti-rabbit Alexa488 (1:500) or mouse anti-rabbit Alexa568 (1:500). The cells were washed three times in PBS. Cells with the biotinylated secondary antibody were incubated for 1 h at room temp in avidin-Alexa488 (1:500, Molecular Probes/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and then washed 3\u00d75 min. Nuclei were counterstained with bisbenzimide (0.5 \u03bcM, Sigma Corp, St Louis, MO) for 20 min in PBS, washed 2\u00d75 min and the coverslips were mounted onto slides with Fluoromount (Southern Biotech, Birmingham AL). A similar protocol was followed for staining of phospho-Akt (pAkt) and phospho-cyclic AMP response element binding protein (pCREB).\nStaining was examined with an Olympus IMT-2 or IX71 inverted microscope and quantified with digital imaging and Metamorph (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA) imaging software. Fluorescence brightness intensity was measured at magnifications of 334X and 674X and the density of neurons and processes was quantified using the threshold and intensity functions. Images were collected from pre-determined regions of the coverslip and analyzed by an individual unaware of the treatment conditions. The total area occupied by MAP-2 immunoreactive cell bodies and processes was measured and expressed as a percentage of the entire field and the average pAkt and pCREB stain intensity for the MAP-2 positive neurons was measured. Data was collected from individual neurons at high magnification and the population distributions and average intensity of the neurons compared across conditions. Intensity values were corrected for background measured in regions that did not contain cells. Astrocytes were also weakly positive for pAkt and pCREB but were not measured (MAP-2 negative).\n\nLM11A-31: a non-peptide neurotrophin ligand\nThe compound LM11A-31 was initially identified by Drs. Longo and Massa using a virtual screen of a small molecule library to identify compounds mimicking the spatial and physical chemical features of the loop 1 region of NGF, a domain known to bind to p75\nNTR\n(\nMassa et al., 2002\n). Subsequent screening of compounds showed LM11A-31 to have neurotrophic activity, high affinity for p75\nNTR\n, and the ability to activate downstream signaling via PI3 kinase and Akt(\nMassa et al., 2002\n;\nMassa et al., 2006\n) with no direct actions on the nerve growth factor receptor, TrkA or the brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor, TrkB. LM11A-31, has potent neuroprotective properties under conditions of serum starvation with EC\n50\nvalues of 200\u2013300 pM and a maximally effective concentration of 5\u2013100 nM in various assays(\nMassa et al., 2006\n;\nYang et al., 2008\n).\n\nCalcium imaging\nNeuronal cultures were washed in HEPES-buffered artificial CSF (aCSF, concentrations in mM: NaCl 137, KCl 5.0, CaCl\n2\n2.3, MgCl\n2\n1.3, glucose 20, HEPES 10, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH) and pre-loaded with the calcium indicator, Fluo-3 AM or Fluo-4 AM using the Molecular Probes Fluo-4 NW Calcium Assay Kit (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) at a 1:4 dilution. After 30 minutes, cultures were washed in aCSF and 18 mm coverslips mounted in a specialized stage for imaging (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Images were captured on an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope at a temperature of 25\u00b0 which provided stable background activity for at least 2 hrs. LM11A-31 was added to the coverslips in the chamber 10 min prior to the challenge. The cells were challenged with 200 pM gp120 final concentration or conditioned medium from hMDM treated for 3 days with 200 pM gp120. The toxic challenge was added in a volume of 80 \u03bcl to 320 \u03bcl in the chamber to provide a 1:5 dilution of the stock. Time lapse digital images were captured automatically by the Metamorph System (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Three pre-stimulation measurements were taken to establish basal levels of fluorescence at the beginning of each experiment. Acute changes in calcium were measured at 0.1 min intervals for 6 min. Delayed changes in calcium were measured at 1 min intervals for at least an additional 60 min. The increase in fluorescence intensity (free calcium) within each cell was then measured relative to the baseline measurements to correct for cell to cell differences in dye loading and intrinsic fluorescence. Control cultures were stimulated with vehicle or control medium (medium from same hMDM cultures prior to the challenge with gp120) in the same fashion to establish normal baseline calcium activity as well as any intrinsic toxic activity from the hMDM cultures.\n\nImaging of mitochondria with JC-1 and TMRM\nTo measure changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, neural cultures were loaded with JC-1 dye (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) at a concentration of 3 \u03bcM in complete medium for 30 min at 36\u00b0. Cells were washed with aCSF, placed in an imaging chamber and challenged with a 1:5 dilution of toxic human CSF previously shown to cause substantial calcium dysregulation. The red and green fluorescence was measured in individual mitochondria with narrow bandpass filters at 6\u201312 minute intervals over a period of 96 min. The average green:red ratio was calculated and plotted over time. Polarized healthy mitochondria have a low green:red ratio and the ratio increases with depolarization. Fluo-3 fluorescence, reflecting intracellular calcium, was measured in parallel cultures under the same conditions and plotted over the same time period for a temporal comparison to changes in mitochondrial membrane potential.\nExperiments were also done using cells loaded with 10 nM tetramethlyrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) to label mitochondria. TMRM was added to the cells for 10 min at the end of the 30 min loading period for the calcium indicator Fluo-4. Cells were washed in aCSF, and the mitochondria imaged. The cells were then challenged with conditioned medium from gp120-stimulated human MDM (1:5). Fluorescence of the calcium indicator was measured over time. Regions of dendrites where swelling occurred were then compared to the location of mitochondria to determine if there was a relationship between the presence of mitochondria and damage.\nMitochondria movements were tracked by labeling with 10 nM TMRM for 10 min followed by addition of the MCM challenge with or without drug. Time lapse images were collected over a period of 30 min. Imaging was initiated in some studies immediately after stimulation with macrophage conditioned medium while in other studies the cells were pre-incubated for period of 30 min to allow the development of pathology. No changes in TMRM fluorescence were seen as a result of immediate MCM treatment or after incubation for 30 min verifying that there were no acute effects on the mitochondrial membrane potential.\n\nStatistics\nResults are presented as the mean \u00b1 sem unless otherwise indicated. Parametric statistics, ANOVA for multiple comparisons and t-test for single comparisons, were calculated using Graphpad Prism software. In the case of multiple comparisons the ANOVA was followed by specific individual paired comparisons to correct for the multiple comparisons. In some cases t-tests were run on two comparisons without correction when there was a single main effect and a secondary comparison to validate stimulus effectiveness. A cutoff of 0.05 was accepted as significant. Estimates of calcium recovery rates were obtained from linear regression analysis of the log transformation of calcium (fluorescence) levels relative to the peak response. The probability of equal slopes was calculated from the individual regression lines."

    "Methods": "Fly husbandry\nFlies were reared on standard molasses yeast agar at room temperature. Flies expressing E1 RNAi and DVMAT-pHluorin were generated as described in (\nMartin et al., 2014\n) and (\nGrygoruk et al., 2014\n), respectively, and are available on request. Other lines including\nelav-GAL4(X)\n(\nRobinow and White, 1991\n),\nTdc2-GAL4\n(\nCole et al., 2005\n),\nDVGLUT-GAL4\n(\nDaniels et al., 2004\n),\nUAS-Arclight\n(\nCao et al., 2013\n) and\nUAS-GCaMP6m(III)\n(\nChen et al., 2013\n) are available from the Bloomington Stock Center. For pHluorin imaging experiments,\nUAS-DVMAT-pHluorin(III) was expressed using elav-GAL4(X).\nFor pHluorin imaging experiments involving E1 RNAi, F\n1\nprogeny were collected from\nelav-GAL4;+;UAS-DVMAT-pHluorin\nfemales crossed to\n+;+;UAS-E1-RNAi\nmales. Controls for these experiments included F\n1\nprogeny from e\nlav-GAL4;+;UAS-DVMAT-pHluorin\nfemales crossed to Canton S (wild type) males. F\n1\nprogeny used for calcium imaging were derived from\nelav-GAL4\nfemales crossed to\nUAS-GCaMP6m (III)\nmales. For experiments using\nUAS-ArcLight\n, F\n1\nprogeny were derived from\nDVGLUT-GAL4\nor\nTdc2-GAL4\nfemales crossed to\nUAS-ArcLight\nmales.\n\npHluorin imaging\nTo visualize DVMAT-pHluorin, fillets of third instar larvae were prepared in chilled HL3.1 Ca\n2+\n-free media (final mM concentration: NaCl 70, KCl 5, MgCl\n2\n4, NaHCO\n3\n10, trehalose 5, sucrose 115, HEPES 5) adjusted to pH 7.32 (\nFeng et al., 2004\n). Stock solutions of 10 mM ziram were made in Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), aliquoted, stored at \u221220\u00b0C and discarded after one freeze-thaw cycle; stocks of 10 mM lactacystin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were made in ddH\n2\nO and treated as for ziram. Fresh stocks of L-glutamic acid (LGA) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were made weekly, and fresh stocks of HL3.1 were made monthly. LGA, CaCl\n2\n, ziram, lactacystin or vehicle (DMSO) were added to HL3.1 on the day of the experiment. For ziram preincubation in\nFigures 1\n\u2013\n3\n, fillets were incubated for 45 minutes at 18oC in \u2018recording solution\u2019 (HL3.1 supplemented with 2 mM calcium and 700 \u03bcM L-glutamic acid to suppress muscle contractions) and containing either 20 \u03bcM ziram (Chem Services, West Chester, PA) or DMSO as a control (final DMSO concentration 0.2%). After incubation, the fillets were washed 3x in chilled recording solution prior to imaging. Experiments involving lactacystin were conducted the same as the ziram preincubation experiments, but with the addition of 100 \u03bcM lactacystin or vehicle alone (ddH\n2\nO) as indicated.\nFigure 1. Exposure to ziram at excitatory glutamatergic terminals results in aberrant exo- and endo-cytosis.\nOpen in a new tab\nA) Representative image of baseline DVMAT-pHluorin signal at Type Ib boutons. Scale bar: 10 microns. B) Averaged trace (mean+/\u2212SEM, n = 23\u201325 fillets) of Type Ib boutons exposed to ziram (20 \u03bcM, 45 min, light grey trace) or vehicle (dark grey), washed, and electrically stimulated (40 Hz, 2 sec) to induce exocytosis. C) Maximum \u0394F/F was determined for control and ziram-treated preparations as a measure of exocytosis (Mann-Whitney test; n = 23\u201325 represented by each symbol; p < 0.01; mean+/\u2212SEM also shown). D) To compare endocytic rates, the % peak fluorescence 10 seconds after stimulus was determined (Mann-Whitney test; n = 23\u201325; p < 0.01).\nFigure 3. Inhibition of the Ubiquitin Proteasome System does not mimic ziram\u2019s action at the fly NMJ.\nOpen in a new tab\nA\u2013B) Type Ib terminals were exposed to lactacystin (100 \u03bcM, 45 min) or vehicle, washed and imaged before and after stimulation (40 Hz, 2 sec). Neither the maximum \u0394F/F (A) nor the % peak fluorescence at 10 seconds (B) differed between terminals exposed to lactacystin (light grey) versus vehicle alone (dark grey) (n = 18\u201321 per treatment, Mann-Whitney test, p > 0.05). C\u2013D) Type Ib terminals expressing E1 RNAi (light grey) versus controls (dark grey). C) Maximum \u0394F/F in Type Ib boutons expressing E1 RNAi (light grey) and the % of peak fluorescence at 10 seconds post stimulus (D) did not significantly differ (n = 10\u201312 per treatment, Mann-Whitney test, p > 0.05). E\u2013H) Type II terminals exposed to lactacystin or expressing E1 RNAi were treated and analyzed identically to Type Ib terminals. Neither Maximum \u0394F/F (E,G) nor % peak fluorescence 10 seconds post stimulus (F,H) differed significantly in Type II boutons treated with lactacystin (E, F, n = 10\u201313 per treatment, Mann-Whitney test, p > 0.05) or expressing E1 RNAi (G, H; n = 14\u201316 per treatment, Mann-Whitney test, p > 0.05).\nNerve terminals were imaged using a Zeiss Axio Examiner Z1 microscope and Zeiss Achroplan water-immersion objective (100x, 1.0 N.A.) fitted with a cooled back-illuminated electron-multiplying CCD camera (Andor iXon 897, South Windsor, CT) and a capture rate of 20 frames/second using Andor IQ2 software. A DG4 light source (Sutter, Novato, CA) with a GFP Brightline\u00ae Filter Set (Semrock, Rochester, NY) was used for illumination. Segment A4 muscle 13 was visualized for all experiments. To stimulate exocytosis, a suction electrode was used to stimulate a single nerve root (10 V, 40 Hz for 2 seconds). Exocytosis was quantified as maximal \u0394F/F = [(F\npeak\n\u2212 F\nbaseline\n)/F\nbaseline\n]*100, where F\npeak\nis the average fluorescence for the ten frames (0.5s) after the end of the 2 sec stimulus period and F\nbaseline\nis the average of the ten frames immediately preceding stimulus. We observed minimal decay in many of the endocytic curves for Type II terminals, prohibiting the calculation of tau by fitting a non-linear exponential curve. Therefore, to directly compare Type Ib and Type II terminals, we quantified endocytosis for all curves as the decrease in fluorescence due to endocytosis as % of F\npeak\nat t = 10 sec post stimulus as described (\nGrygoruk et al., 2014\n).\n\nCalcium imaging\nTo monitor intracellular calcium concentrations, a calcium sensitive form of GFP,\nUAS-GCaMP6\n(\nChen et al., 2013\n) was expressed pan-neuronally using\nelav-GAL4(X)\n(\nRobinow and White, 1991\n). Larvae were dissected as for pHluorin experiments and either 1) preincubated in 20 \u03bcM ziram (0.2 % DMSO) or DMSO alone for 45 minutes (18\u00b0C) followed by washing in recording solution (\nFigure 4\n) or 2) imaged during continuous incubation in recording solution containing either 20 \u03bcM ziram (0.2 % DMSO) or DMSO alone at ambient temperature (\nFigure 5\n). For evoked response recordings, nerve roots were stimulated (10 V, 40 Hz for 2 seconds) and imaged as for DVMAT-pHluorin. Due to differences in the kinetics of the pH (pHluorin) versus calcium- sensitive (GCaMP) GFP-based probes, \u0394F/F was calculated for GCaMP as [(F\npeak\n\u2212 F\nbaseline\n)/F\nbaseline\n]*100, with F\npeak\nrepresenting the average of four frames right before and four frames right after the end of stimulus (0.4 sec total) (\nMacleod, 2012\n) with F\nbaseline\nrepresenting the average of the ten frames prior to stimulus (0.5 seconds total).\nFigure 4. Ziram exposure does not alter calcium influx or baseline calcium levels at Type Ib or Type II synapses.\nOpen in a new tab\nType Ib (A\u2013C, n = 11 per treatment) or Type II boutons (D\u2013F, n = 7\u201321 per treatment) expressing GCaMP were exposed to ziram (light grey, 100 \u03bcM, 45 min) or vehicle alone (DMSO, dark grey), washed and stimulated to induce calcium influx (40 Hz, 2 sec). Neither maximum \u0394F/F (B, E) nor baseline fluorescence (C, F) showed statistically significant differences between preparations treated with ziram versus vehicle alone (Mann-Whitney test, p > 0.05).\nFigure 5. Ziram exposure causes coordinated and spontaneous calcium events in aminergic terminals.\nOpen in a new tab\nGCaMP fluorescence was quantified in Type II terminals exposed to vehicle (DMSO) alone (not shown) or 20\u03bcM ziram (A, B). Traces show repetitive calcium spikes after 10 minutes exposure to ziram (B, n = 6) but not at the onset of exposure (A) or in the presence of vehicle either at the onset of treatment or after 10 minute exposure (n = 8). C\u2013D) Tetrodotoxin and CdCl\n2\nblock ziram-induced spontaneous calcium events at aminergic terminals. Representative traces of Type II terminal from larval fillets treated with ziram (C, 20 \u03bcM, 10 min) followed by 5 min incubation in the same concentration of ziram plus either 1\u03bcM tetrodotoxin (D, n = 3) or 100 \u03bcM CdCl\n2\n(E, n = 3) to inhibit sodium and calcium channels respectively.\nFor experiments involving the channel inhibitors tetrodotoxin (TTX) and Cadmium Chloride (CdCl\n2\n), larval fillets were imaged in recording solution (HL3.1 with 2 mM calcium and 700 \u03bcM L-glutamic acid) plus 0.2% DMSO +/\u2212 20 \u03bcM ziram without channel inhibitor, then washed 3x with recording solution containing either 20 \u03bcM ziram or 20 \u03bcM ziram plus 1 \u03bcM TTX or 100 \u03bcM CdCl\n2\n. After incubation in this solution for an additional 5 minutes, the preparations were imaged for \u2265 1.2 minutes.\n\nArcLight Recordings\nTo monitor intracellular voltage changes, a voltage sensitive form of GFP,\nUAS-ArcLight\nwas expressed in either octopaminergic neurons using the\nTdc2-GAL4\ndriver or glutamatergic using the\nDVGLUT-GAL4\ndriver. Larvae were dissected as for pHluorin experiments and imaged during continuous incubation in recording solution containing either 20 \u03bcM ziram (0.2 % DMSO) or DMSO alone at ambient temperature. (Note that in\nFigure 6\nthe fluorescence signal from ArcLight decreases in response to depolarizations in contrast to the increase in fluorescence seen with GCaMP in\nFigures 5\n.)\nFigure 6. Ziram induces spontaneous voltage mediated events at aminergic terminals.\nOpen in a new tab\nRepresentative traces ArcLight recordings at a Type Ib terminal (A,B, n = 3 per treatment) and Type II terminal (C,D, n = 7 per treatment) before (A,C) and after (B,D) 10 min treatment with 20 \u03bcM ziram.\n\nData Analysis\nAveraged data in the figures are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. The number of recordings (max 2 per fillet) was used as the statistical n throughout. For each recording, 1\u20137 boutons were imaged and averaged as a single n. Boutons that moved out of the z plane during or after a stimulus were not analyzed. Statistical analysis was carried out in Graphpad Prism. To avoid assumptions about the nature of the data (e.g. whether it was normally distributed) a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used throughout. An effect was judged statistically significant if p < 0.05. A custom script written in the R programming language (Gnu Operating System) was used to quantify the average amplitude and frequency of some spontaneous events. An additional custom script in R was used to perform resampling statistical analysis (\u201cbootstrapping\u201d) of the E1 RNAi data."

    "Methods": "Generation and production of an adeno-associated virus (AAV5) CCL2 overexpression vector\nMouse cDNA encoding the open reading frame of CCL2 (Origene; Rockville, MD) was cloned into a pAAV shuttle vector containing the AAV inverted terminal repeats with an expression cassette composed of the human elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1\u03b1) promoter, a multiple cloning site, the woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE), and a polyadenylation signal. The CCL2 insert was generated by PCR using the following primers: Forward 5\u2032ATA GTC GAC ATG CAG GTC CCT GTC ATG CTT CTG G 3\u2032 and Reverse 5\u2032 ATA AAG CTT CTA GTT CAC TGT CAC ACT GGT CAC TCC TA 3\u2032. PCR products were digested by SalI and EcoRV and subcloned into the MCS of the pAAV shuttle vector to generate the pAAV-EF1\u03b1-CCL2 vector. Recombinant AAV5 vectors were generated by transient co-transfection of HEK-293T cells with 37.5 \u00b5g of total DNA containing 7.5 \u00b5g of pAAV-EF1\u03b1-CCL2, 7.5 \u00b5g of AAV5 rep-cap plasmid, and 22.5 \u00b5g of pAD helper plasmid using the calcium phosphate method. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were collected and lysed with 10% chloroform and AAV particles were purified using PEG8000 (Promega; Madison, WI) and benzonase nuclease (Life Technologies; Carlsbad, CA) and concentrated using an Ultra-4 centrifugal filter (EMD/Millipore; Billerica, MA). Titers were determined by quantitative PCR for viral genomic copies extracted from proteinase K-treated viral particles using the following primers: Forward: 5\u2032ATA GTC GAC ATG CAG GTC CCT GTC ATG CTT CTG G 3\u2032 and Reverse 5\u2032 TTG TAG CTC TCC AGC CTA CTC ATT GG 3\u2032. For the present experiments, the following vectors were produced: AAV5-EF1\u03b1-CCL2: 2.2\u00d710\n13\nGC/ml and AAV5-EF1\u03b1-eYFP: 1.52\u00d710\n13\nGC/ml.\n\nAnimals and Sciatic Nerve Transection Injury (SNI)\nEight to twelve-week-old male wild type (WT) mice [C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor ME)] and mutant mice [C57B6.129S4-Ccr2\ntm1Ifc\n/J (CCR2 \u2212/\u2212; Jackson Laboratories)] were utilized for this study. The animals were housed under a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. SNI was performed on WT mice under isoflurane anesthesia. Briefly, the right sciatic nerve was exposed and transected proximal to the trifurcation and the wound closed with a wound clip. The left sciatic nerve was then exposed but not transected to serve as an internal control. One, two, three, or four weeks after intrathecal injection or 7 d after SNI, the animals were sacrificed by CO\n2\ninhalation, and the lumbar-level DRGs, sciatic nerves, and spinal cords were removed for immunohistochemical or molecular biological analysis. All animal procedures were approved by the Case Western Reserve University\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nL5 laminectomy and intrathecal injection\nThe intrathecal injection method was modified from\nParikh et al. (2011)\n. Briefly, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane. A small incision was made in the back skin of the mouse and the spinal column was exposed. The site of viral injection was between lumbar levels L5 and L6, where a small laminectomy was performed to expose the dura. The injection was performed with a borosilicate glass capillary (WPI; Sarasota, FL) pulled to a fine point, attached by polyethylene tubing (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA) to a Hamilton syringe. The glass capillary remained at midline and was slowly inserted underneath the dura and further advanced in the subarachnoid space. Ten microliters of AAV5-EF1\u03b1-CCL2 or AAV5-EF1\u03b1- eYFP were slowly injected using 1% trypan blue added to the AAV particle solution to visualize the injection, and the capillary remained in place for 2 min after the injection. The paraspinal muscles and fascia were repositioned, and the incision closed with wound clips. One, two, three, or four weeks after injection mice were sacrificed and lumbar DRG were harvested for qPCR, IHC, or explant culture.\n\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC)\nGenerally, lumbar DRGs from CCR2 \u2212/\u2212 and WT mice were removed, and the ganglia were desheathed and fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde. The tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Electron Microscopy Sciences; Hatfield, PA). IHC was performed on 10 \u03bcm cryostat sections. For quantification of macrophages, a rat monoclonal antibody to CD11b (also known as Mac1, CR3, and integrin \u03b1\nM\n; 1:100; EMD/Millipore) or CD68 (1:200; AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK) was incubated with tissue sections overnight at 4\u00b0C. Given that the same effect was observed with CD11b and CD68, the cells labeled by either of these markers will be referred to as macrophages throughout the paper. For quantification of RAG proteins, a rabbit monoclonal antibody to pSTAT3 (Y705; 1:100; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), a rabbit polyclonal antibody to activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3; 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Dallas, TX), or a rabbit polyclonal antibody to small proline-rich repeat protein 1a (SPRR1a), generously provided by Dr. Stephen Strittmatter and Dr. William Cafferty (Yale University), was incubated with tissue sections overnight at 4\u00b0C. For YFP detection, a rabbit antibody against GFP (1:500; Life Technologies) was incubated with tissue sections for 3 d at 4\u00b0C. After washing, the sections were incubated in Cy3 secondary antibody (1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.; West Grove, PA) or AlexaFluor 488 secondary antibody (1:500; Life Technologies) for 1 h. In all experiments, sections not exposed to the primary antibody were included for each experimental group. Images were captured at 25x magnification using HCImage software (Hamamatsu Corporation; Bridgewater, NJ) and then quantified using MetaMorph software (Version 7.6.3.0, Molecular Devices; Downingtown, PA). Data are represented as the percentage of the imaged area that was positively immuno-labeled.\n\nReal time PCR (RT-PCR)\nThe expression of CCL2 mRNA was analyzed by RT- PCR. One, two, three, or four weeks after intrathecal injection both L5 DRGs were removed and stored in RNAlater (Life Technologies) at 4\u00b0C. RNA was extracted from pairs of ganglia using the Ambion RNAqueous micro kit. Five samples were included for each time point. Total RNA was quantified and 400 ng were reverse transcribed using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems; Carlsbad, CA). RT-PCR was performed in an ABI Step-One Plus, using prevalidated TaqMan expression assays [CCL2, Mm00441242; glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Mm99999915; ATF3, Mm00476032; GAP-43, Mm00500404; Jun, Mm00495062; Smad1, Mm00484723; Sox11, Mm01281943; galanin, Mm00439056; interleukin (IL)-6, Mm00446190; LIF, Mm00434762; iNos, Mm00440502; CD86, Mm00444543; CD16, Mm00438875; arginase 1, Mm00475988; CD206, Mm00485148; Fizz1, Mm00445109; Ym1, Mm00657889; Applied Biosystems], and samples were assayed in triplicate. Relative expression was determined using the Comparative Ct Model (\u0394\u0394Ct) with GAPDH as the housekeeping gene.\n\nDRG explants\nTo assess the outgrowth of peripheral neurons in response to injury, we evaluated neurite outgrowth in explanted ganglia (\nShoemaker et al., 2005\n). Three weeks after intrathecal injection of the virus, L5 DRGs from uninjured CCR2 \u2212/\u2212 and WT mice were removed, desheathed, placed on coverslips, and overlaid with 7.5 \u03bcl Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Culture plates were placed in an incubator at 37\u00b0C for 5 min to allow gelling of the Matrigel before adding 1 ml F12 medium with the additives described in\nHyatt Sachs et al. (2010)\n. Phase-contrast images of neurite outgrowth from each DRG were captured at 24 and 48 h after explantation using an Axiovert 405 M microscope at 10x magnification. Neurite outgrowth was assessed using MetaMorph software by measuring the distance between the edge of the ganglion and the leading tip of the longest 20 processes in each explant. The average length of the 20 longest neurites is taken for each ganglion. At 48 h, explants were fixed and labeled with an antibody against \u03b2III tubulin (1:500; Promega) to visualize the outgrowth. Representative images were taken at 10\u00d7. In some experiments, 200 ng/ml of recombinant mouse CCL2 (R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN) was added to the culture medium at the time of plating.\n\nDRG dissociated cell culture\nTo assess neurite outgrowth from isolated sensory neurons, we dissociated and cultured DRG neurons from uninjured WT mice or mice injected with AAV5-CCL2 or AAV5-YFP (\nSachs et al., 2007\n). L5 DRGs were removed, cleaned and desheathed. Except where noted all reagents used in the DRG dissociations and culture were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Ganglia were incubated in 0.125% collagenase A at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 h. The cells were then dissociated by gentle trituration using a P200 pipet in Neurobasal A medium containing 2% B-27 serum free supplement, 2 mM glutamine (both from Life Technologies), 10 U/ml penicillin, and 10 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. The dissociated cells were purified following the procedure of\nGavazzi et al. (1999)\n, by centrifugation through 15% BSA at 600 rpm for 6 min. Neurons were resuspended in Neurobasal A containing 50 \u03bcg/ml DNase (Type I) and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 2 min. Supernatants were removed, and cells were resuspended in Neurobasal A. Cells were gently plated (1/2 DRG/coverslip) onto 12 mm coverslips coated with 0.01% poly-L-lysine and 10 \u03bcg/ml laminin in a 12-well culture plate. Cells were allowed to adhere undisturbed for 20 min. Each coverslip was then overlaid with 1 ml of Neurobasal A and cultured for 24 h at 37\u00b0C in 95% air/5% CO\n2\n. In some experiments, 200 ng/ml of recombinant mouse CCL2 (R&D Systems) was added to the culture medium at the time of plating.\n\nInhibitors of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation: AG490 and STATTIC\nTwo inhibitors of STAT3 phosphorylation were utilized in DRG dissociated cell culture to assess the role STAT3 plays in CCL2 overexpression-induced neurite outgrowth. AG490 (50 \u03bcM; EMD Millipore;\nMeydan et al., 1996\n), a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, and STATTIC (10 \u03bcM; EMD Millipore;\nSchust et al., 2006\n), a STAT3 SH2 domain binding inhibitor, were used. L5 DRGs from mice 3 wk after intrathecal injection with AAV5-YFP or AAV5-CCL2 were removed, dissociated and cultured as described above. At the time of plating, cells were cultured in Neurobasal A medium containing AG490 (50 \u03bcM), STATTIC (10 \u03bcM), or DMSO (0.17 \u03bcl/ml) for 24 h.\n\nAnalysis of neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons\nCells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and labeled with a mouse monoclonal antibody to \u03b2III tubulin (1:900 for DRG; Promega), followed by a 45 min incubation in an AlexaFluor 488 labeled secondary antibody (1:400, Life Technologies, Grand Island). Coverslips were placed onto slides with FluoroGel (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Fourteen-bit images were collected on a Leica DMI 6000 B inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems; Wetzlar, Germany) using a Retiga Aqua blue camera (Q-imaging; Vancouver, British Columbia). Briefly, the entire coverslip was imaged at 10x and all resulting images were stitched together using the scan slide function in MetaMorph Imaging Software (Molecular Devices) to generate a full resolution composite image. The composite image was then subjected to neurite outgrowth analysis using the neurite outgrowth module in MetaMorph software. The longest neurite from each \u03b2III tubulin-positive neuron with a process of at least 1.5 times the diameter of the cell body was measured.\n\nAnalysis of pixel intensity of pSTAT3 in cultured neurons\nCells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and labeled with a mouse monoclonal antibody to \u03b2III tubulin (1:900; Promega) and a polyclonal antibody against pSTAT3 (Y705; 1:80; Cell Signaling), followed by a 1 h incubation in an AlexaFluor 488 labeled secondary antibody (1:400, Life Technologies) to visualize \u03b2III tubulin and an AlexaFluor 647 labeled secondary antibody (1:200; Jackson Immuno) to visualize pSTAT3. Coverslips were placed onto slides with FluoroGel (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and imaged as described above. The longest neurite from each \u03b2III tubulin-positive neuron with a process of at least 1.5 times the diameter of the cell body was measured using the MetaMorph software. Data for neurite outgrowth was then expressed as the average length of the longest neurite for each group. To assess the average pixel intensity of pSTAT3 in culture, the nucleus of each neuron was outlined and the average pixel intensity within the nucleus was measured using the MetaMorph software. The same neurons were measured for both neurite outgrowth and pSTAT3 nuclear pixel intensity.\n\nStatistics\nData are expressed as the means + S.E.M. and were analyzed by one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "2.1. Chemicals and reagents\n(R)-(+)-8-OH-DPAT (#ab1210507) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), DOI ((R)-(\u2212)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine; #D153), levodopa (D150), benserazide (B7283), and fluoxetine (#F132) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and [\n3\nH]-paroxetine (#Art177) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemical Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Antibodies and their sources are described below. All other chemicals were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA).\n\n2.2. Mice\nMale and female VMAT2 LO mice (expressing 5% of wildtype VMAT2 levels) were generated as previously described (\nCaudle et al., 2007\n). Mice of both genders were used in all experiments. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Emory University.\n\n2.3. Ages of mice used in experiments\nFrom staging of catecholaminergic neurodegeneration in previous work (\nCaudle et al., 2007\n;\nTaylor et al., 2014\n), VMAT2 LO mice exhibit DAT and NET loss at 12 months, LC loss at 12 months, and nigral degeneration at 18\u201324 months. We have used aged mice as follows:\nYoung adult mice (between 4 and 6 months of age) were used in voltammetry experiments and in the DOI head-twitch response assay to determine the phenotypic, baseline effect of reduced VMAT2 expression on synaptic 5-HT release and postsynaptic signaling. Aged mice (between 18 and 24 months) for paroxetine-binding and SERT immunohistochemistry to capture a time point during which DAT and NET loss had already occurred (and LC and nigral degeneration had begun). 18\u201324 month old mice were also used in the 8-OH-DPAT assay. Advance-aged mice (26\u201330 months) were used the test for levodopa induced dyskinesia and for dorsal raphe stereology to capture a most neurodegenerative state.\n\n2.4. Immunohistochemistry\nMice were transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline and 4% paraformaldehyde. Their brains were then removed and stored in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, and cryopreserved in 30% sucrose for 48 h. Brains were then sliced on a freezing microtome at 40 \u00b5m and collected into cryopreservative. Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (\nCaudle et al., 2007\n;\nTaylor et al., 2014\n). Following tissue slicing, free-floating sections were incubated with a polyclonal rabbit antibody against either TPH2 (1,5:000; Novus NB100-74555, Littleton, CO) overnight at 4\u00b0, or SERT for 48 h at room temperature (1:10,000; Immunostar 24,330, Hudson, WI). Secondary incubations were performed with biotinylated polyclonal goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:200; Jackson 111-065-003, Hudson, WI).\n\n2.5. Stereology of the dorsal raphe nucleus\nStereology was performed to determine the number of serotonergic (TPH2 +) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus of aged (26\u201330 months) mice. Following immunohistochemistry against TPH2, tissue slices were mounted on microscope slides, processed, and counterstained with cresyl violet to identify cell nuclei as previously described (\nTaylor et al., 2014\n). Stereological sampling (\nWest et al., 1991\n) was performed using Stereo Investigator software (MicroBrightField, Colchester, VT). Dorsal raphe contours (comprising the dorsal, ventral, and intrafascicular regions of the nucleus) were outlined as defined by the atlas of Paxinos and Franklin (2001), using a 4\u00d7 objective. Final tissue thickness was 24 \u00b5m; guard zones of 2 \u00b5m were used to exclude lost profiles on the top and bottom of tissue sections. Cells were counted with a 40\u00d7 objective (1.3\u00d7 numerical aperture), using a counting frame of 50 \u00d7 50 \u00b5m, and sampling grid of 80 \u00d7 100 \u00b5m, at an evaluation interval of three sections (yielding 6\u20137 sections per animal). A serotonergic neuron was defined as an in-focus TPH2-immunoreactive cell body with a TPH2-negative nucleus. Nissl + cells were defined as having a cresyl-violet positive nucleus or TPH2 + cell body. The Gundersen (m = 1) coefficient of error was less than 0.1 for each animal.\n\n2.6. Fast scan cyclic voltammetry in substantia nigra pars reticulata\nFast scan cyclic voltammetry was performed as previously described (\nLohr et al., 2014\n), with modification to measure 5-HT release in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). Adult wildtype and VMAT2 LO mice (aged 4\u20136 months, n = 3) were decapitated and their brains quickly transferred to ice cold oxygenated (95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). Brains were mounted in aCSF onto the stage of a vibratome (Leica VT100S) and sliced at 300 \u00b5m. Midbrain slices were collected and maintained in oxygenated aCSF at room temperature. After 30 min, slices were placed in a slice perfusion chamber. Stimulating and carbon-fiber recording electrodes were placed in the lateral region of the SNr, as defined by Paxinos. A four-recording survey of three different sites within the SNr was taken for each animal with a 5-min rest interval between each stimulation (20 pulses, 100 Hz, 350 \u00b5A, 4 ms, monophasic). Neurochemical identity of 5-HT was confirmed with a 5-HT-specific waveform and by observing increased signal in the presence of 10 \u00b5M fluoxetine. Synaptic clearance of 5-HT was assessed by measuring the rate constant\ntau\n, which is a measure of the time required for the 5-HT signal to decay to 1/3 of its peak height.\nCarbon-fiber microelectrodes were calibrated with 5-HT standards using a flow-cell injection system. Kinetic constants were extracted using nonlinear regression analysis of release and uptake of 5-HT. Application of wave-form, stimulus, and current monitoring was controlled by TarHeel CV [University of North Carolina (UNC)] using a custom potentiostat (UEI, UNC Electronics Shop). The waveform for 5-HT detection consisted of a \u22120.2 V holding potential versus an Ag/AgCl (In Vivo Metric) reference electrode. The applied voltage ramp ranged from \u22120.2 V to 1.0 V and back to \u22120.2 V, applied at a rate of 1000 V/s at 10 Hz.\n\n2.7. [\n3\nH]-paroxetine binding to quantify SERT expression in striatal homogenates\nParoxetine binding was performed as previously described (\nCaudle et al., 2006\n). Aged (18\u201324 months) wildtype and VMAT2 LO mice were decapitated and their brains were subsequently removed and dissected. Whole, bilateral striata were collected into a glass Wheaton homogenizer tube containing 5 ml ice-cold assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mN KCl, pH 7.4), homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer at 1000 rpm, and centrifuged at 48,000 \u00d7\ng\n. The resulting pellet was resuspended, homogenized, and centrifuged again. The final pellet was resuspended in 500 \u00b5l assay buffer. 100\u2013200 \u00b5g (post-hoc determination) of sample was incubated in a 400 \u00b5l reaction mixture of 2 nM paroxetine. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 \u00b5M fluoxetine.\n\n2.8. Test for expression of L-DOPA induced dyskinesia\nThe evaluation of L-DOPA induced dyskinesia was modeled after Ding and colleagues (\nDing et al., 2007\n). Aged wildtype and VMAT2 Lo mice (26\u201330 months, n = 5\u20137/group) were injected with saline or a mixture of L-DOPA (25 mg/kg) and the AADC inhibitor benserazide (12.5 mg/kg), i.p., every 12 h. Mice were placed in glass cylinder for video-recorded observation and evaluated for the presence of dyskinetic limb movement, as defined in the original study.\n\n2.9. DOI-induced head twitch response\nMethods were modeled after\nCanal and Morgan (2012)\n. DOI was prepared fresh in 0.9% bacteriostatic sodium chloride. Adult mice (4 months of age) of either gender were injected with saline or DOI (1 mg/kg, i.p.), and individually placed into a clean cage for video-recorded observation. 12 days later, a crossover study was performed. Behavior was recorded from 10 to 20 min post injection. A blinded observer counted the number of head twitches over a 10-min interval. Video was played at 0.6\u00d7 speed to distinguish head twitches from other rapid furtive movements. Head twitches were defined as rapid rotational head movements as previously described (\nCanal and Morgan, 2012\n).\n\n2.10. 8-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia\nThe 8-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia assay was adapted from Martin and colleagues (\nMartin et al., 1992\n). Mice of either gender were individually placed into clean cages. Baseline core body temperatures (t\n0\n) were measured with a rectal thermometer. Mice were then injected with saline or 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg; s.c.). Core body temperatures were again measured 20 min following injection (t\n20\n), and the differences between t\n0\nand t\n20\nwere calculated to yield the change in core body temperature.\n\n2.11. Statistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (La Jolla, CA). Experiments with two factors were analyzed by two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni posttests for pairwise comparisons. One-factor experiments were analyzed with t-tests for independent means. Results were reported as mean \u00b1 SEM, and statistical significance set at \u03b1 = 0.05. In figures, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThree different transgenic mouse strains of either gender were used, each on a congenic C57BL6/J background to avoid genetic modifier effects of background strain on disease expression (\nHeiman-Patterson et al., 2011\n). Most work was conducted using mice which overexpress a transgene that carries the G93A mutation of human SOD1 protein (\nGurney et al., 1994\n). Hereafter, these mice (B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1-G93A)1Gur/J) are referred to as B6.SOD1 mice. These mice exhibit changes in motor performance at about 50 days which are detectable by gait analysis but survive about 1 month longer (50% survival ~160 days) than the original mice carrying the same transgene on a mixed B6SJL background (\nWooley et al., 2005\n;\nHeiman-Patterson et al., 2011\n). In some experiments, mice were used that express the human transgene for the G85R SOD1 mutation (B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1*G85R)148Dwc/J, hereafter SOD1\nG85R\n). These mice express mutant SOD1 protein at much lower levels than SOD1\nG93A\nmice, and have a later disease onset (8\u201310 months) followed by uniformly rapid disease progression (\nBruijn et al., 1997\n). Aged-matched C57BL6/J (hereafter WT) mice were used as controls. All mice were bred at Emory University or acquired from The Jackson Laboratory (\nwww.jax.org\n, Bar Harbor, ME). All experiments were carried out in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Emory University.\n\nImmunolabeling\nUnder general anesthesia, the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and soleus muscles were recovered and prepared for immunolabeling. Muscles were placed into 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hr. Muscles were washed in a 0.1 M phosphate buffered solution (PBS) and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight in PBS containing 20% sucrose for cryoprotection. Sections (50 \u03bcm thickness) were obtained using a Cyrostat (Leica). Motor endplate acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) were labeled with Alexa 488 conjugated \u03b1-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes). Axons and motor terminals (synaptic vesicles) were labeled with a mouse monoclonal antibody against the phosphorylated heavy fragment of neurofilament protein (SMI31, 1:400, Sternberger Monoclonal) and synaptic vesicles (SV2, 1:20, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). Labeling was visualized using Cy5-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Schwann cells (SCs) were labeled with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against S100B Ca\n2+\n-binding protein (S100, 1:100, Dako) and visualized using a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). In addition to S100 labeling, SCs in some sections were also labeled with a goat polyclonal antibody against the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor p75 (NGFR p75, 1:50, Santa Cruz SC-6188) and visualized using a Cy5-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). DAPI staining was used to identify SC or TSC cell body nuclei. This staining was performed as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions using slide mounting media (Vectashield) which included DAPI.\n\nImaging\nZ-axis stacks of images of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) were obtained at sequential focal planes (1.0 \u03bcm separation) using an upright microscope equipped with a motorized stage (Leica). Stacks were deconvolved using a commercially available inverse filter algorithm (ImagePro). In some cases, stacks of confocal images were obtained.\n\nAnalysis\nImages of NMJs were analyzed at high magnification (100x) to determine the extent to which presynaptic SMI+SV2 labeling overlaid postsynaptic labeling for AChRs in superimposed images. SMI+SV2 labeling was used to assign the following categories of endplate innervation; endplates that exhibited a complete absence of SMI+SV2 labeling were considered to be denervated; endplates that showed SMI+SV2 labeling present in all ACHR-rich endplate arms or branches were considered to be innervated; endplates that showed SMI+SV2 labeling present in some but not all ACHR-rich arms or branches were considered to be partially innervated. For analysis, randomly selected fields of NMJs were first located at low magnification. Then, at high magnification all the NMJs in each field were categorized as described above. The extent of endplate S100 coverage was also assessed at 100x magnification and assigned into 3 categories (full, partial, absent). Additional analyses to assess colabeling for P75, S100 and DAPI labeling at 100x magnification were performed as described in Results. Unless noted otherwise, all NMJ measurements were sampled from 80 NMJs per muscle, and only one MG-soleus pair from the same side was sampled per animal.\nTSC cell bodies were identified by S100 and DAPI nuclear colabeling (\nLove and Thompson, 1998\n). As shown in\nFig 1\n, multiple DAPI-labeled nuclei are located in the vicinity of the NMJ, so TSC cell body identification needs to be performed with care. To identify TSC cell bodies, multiple focal planes were viewed using a 100x, oil-immersion objective with a variable aperture closed down to minimize depth of focus. At each focal plane, the appropriate fluorescence filters were manually switched while viewing images on a video monitor to ensure that S100 and DAPI labeling were located in identical focal planes. Since some time was needed to accomplish these views, mercury lamp illumination was used to minimize the amount of light exposure. In most cases, these steps were sufficient to either identify TSC cell bodies or to exclude their presence. In more difficult cases, full image stacks of DAPI and S100 labeling were taken to enable finer scrutiny of labeling placement.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nMany P30 SOD1 MG NMJs lack TSCs. TSC and SC cell bodies were identified by DAPI and S100 colabeling. A1\u20132. Panel shows an MG NMJ labeled for DAPI only (A1) and merged with S100 labeling (green, DAPI shown in red, A2). In each panel, the yellow arrow indicates location of DAPI-S100 colabeling. Other DAPI-labeled nuclei visible in A1\u20132 belong to the underlying muscle fiber or to other, non-S100-expressing cells in the immediate vicinity. A3. Same endplate labeled for SMI-SV2 (green) and ACHRs (red), demonstrating that the endplate is fully innervated. In this example, no TSC cell bodies identified by DAPI-S100 colabeling can be seen at the endplate which is instead covered by the S100-labeled processes of an SC with a cell body located outside the endplate along the preterminal axon. B1\u20133. Labeling as in A. Panel B illustrates a second example of a P30 SOD1 MG NMJ in which the S100-labeled processes of a remotely-located SC cover the motor terminal of a fully innervated NMJ. These examples also illustrate the general finding that all P30 B6.SOD1 NMJs were supplied by a single motor axon. C1\u20133. Labeling as in A. Panels demonstrate labeling at a P30 WT MG NMJ. At this NMJ, a single TSC cell body (blue arrow, C2) is located at a fully-innervated endplate (C3). All P30 WT MG NMJs showed one or more endplate TSC cell body.\n\nStatistics\nTwo-way contingency tables were used to determine effects of genotype (B6.SOD1 v WT), age or treatment on frequency distributions of categorical variable means describing innervation status (SMI-SV2 labeling), NMJ S100 and P75 labeling coverage, and S100-P75 colabeling status. For comparing average values, nested analysis of variance was used. Tukey\u2019s honestly significant difference post-hoc test was used to test the significance of differences between WT, contralateral control and B6.SOD1 average values. All analysis was performed using commercially available software (Systat Inc). Mean values are presented \u00b1 1 SEM."

    "Methods": "Animals and experimental design\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (weighting 160-180 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Animals were housed in the animal facility that was maintained at 22\u00b0C with an automatic 12 h light/dark cycle. The animals received a standard laboratory diet and tap water\nad libitum\n. All experiments were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on Use and Care of Animals according to National Institutes of Health guidelines. The experimenter was blinded to animal treatment during behavioral experiments.\nAnimals were hosted in the animal facility for 5-7 days after their arrival before starting the experiments. Then the animals, weighing 200-220 g, were randomly grouped and were subjected to 10-day water avoidance (WA) stress or repeated corticosterone administration. Behavioral assessment were conducted 24-hour/72-hour (day 11, day 14 respectively) after completing the 10-day stress procedure. A separate group of stressed rats was assessed for visceral pain sensation 6 weeks after completing the 10-day WA stress. Biochemical and molecular characterization of pain regulatory pathways were performed using separate groups of animals without behavioral measurements.\n\nWater avoidance stress\nRepeated exposure of male rats to water avoidance (WA) stress was conducted as described previously (\nHong\net al.\n, 2009\n;\nHong\net al.\n, 2011\n). The rats were placed on a glass platform in the middle of a tank filled with water (25 \u00b0C) to 1 cm below the height of the platform. The animals were maintained on the tank for 1 h in the morning daily for 10 consecutive days. The control (sham-stress) rats were placed similarly for 1 h daily for 10 days in a tank without water. In a separate study, several groups of healthy control rats were received the optimal dose of CORT (3 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in 5% ethanol and 95% saline via subcutaneous (\ns.c.\n) injection in the morning, daily, for 10 days to reproduce the serum corticosterone (CORT) level observed in the stressed rats as described previously (\nHong\net al.\n, 2011\n).\n\nMeasurement of serum corticosterone\nSerum corticosterone levels were determined as described previously (\nHong\net al.\n, 2009\n). Briefly, blood was collected from the rat after 1 hour WA stress on day 10 of the stress procedure or corticosterone injection. Total corticosterone in serum samples was analyzed by the Correlate-EIA corticosterone enzyme immunoassay kit (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All samples were run in triplicates with standard corticosterone controls and kit calibrators in each analysis. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured with a reference wavelength of 680 nm.\n\nVisceral motor response (VMR) to colorectal distention (CRD)\nRoutine procedures were conducted as previously described (\nHong\net al.\n, 2011\n). Briefly, rats were deeply anaesthetized with subcutaneous injection of a mixture of ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg). An incision was made in the skin of the lower abdomen, and two perfluoroalkoxy-coated, 32-gauge stainless steel wires were inserted into the external oblique pelvic muscles superior to the inguinal ligament. Animals were injected with 500 \u03bcL of 0.9% saline and artificial tears eye ointment was placed onto their eyes. The animals were then allowed to recover for 3-5 days prior to the VMR measurement.\nMeasurement of the VMR to CRD was conducted in separate groups of rats on day 11 (WA group), day 14 (WA-Rec group) and 6-week after the completion of 10-day WA stress procedure. The VMR was quantified by measuring electromyographic activity in the external oblique musculature in the awake animals. CRD was conducted to constant pressures of 10, 20, 40, and 60 mmHg by a custom-made distension control device. The responses were considered stable if there was less than 20% variability between 2 consecutive trials of CRD at 60 mm Hg. The increase in the area under curve (AUC), which is the sum of all recorded data points multiplied by the sample interval (in seconds) after baseline subtraction, was presented as the overall response during the course of the CRD test.\n\nThermal Hyperalgesia (Hargreaves test)\nThermal analgesia was measured using an IITC analgesia machine (Model 336TG IITC, Woodland Hills, CA) as described previously (\nSullivan\net al.\n, 2007\n). To quantify thermal sensitivity, stressed rats (WA and WA-Rec groups) and the matched controls were placed on a temperature controlled glass plate (32 \u00b0C) inside a plexiglas compartment and allowed to acclimate for at least 1 h. A light source was placed under the hindpaw and the time it took for a hindpaw withdrawal from the light source was measured in seconds. The light source reached a maximum of 75 \u00b0C. A cutoff time of 15 seconds was applied to protect the rats from injury. The latency to foot withdrawal (escape) served as the behavioral measure of thermal nociception. Each foot was tested 5 times with 3 min between stimulations of either foot to avoid peripheral sensitization effects. As compared with the baseline (control) latency, a significant decrease in the latency of foot withdrawal in response to the thermal stimulus was interpreted as indicating the presence of thermal hyperalgesia.\n\nMechanical Allodynia (von Frey test)\nMechanical allodynia was determined by a significant decrease in mechanical threshold of the stressed rat compared to that of the control rat. To quantify mechanical sensitivity of the foot, brisk foot withdrawal in response to a normally innocuous mechanical stimulus was measured as described previously (\nCheng\net al.\n, 2009\n). Control and stressed (WA and WA-Rec groups) animals were placed in Plexiglas cage with mesh flooring and allowed to acclimate for 1 h. Response to the mechanical stimulus was measured with von Frey filaments (von Frey hairs; Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). Testing started with a 6 g filament and increased until a response was elicited. Brisk withdrawal of the hindpaw indicated a positive response. Once there was a response, we used the up-down method (\nCheng\net al.\n, 2009\n). Six positive and negative data points were collected and a 50% paw withdrawal threshold was calculated. A significant decrease in the pressure necessary to elicit a brisk foot withdrawal in response to this mechanical stimulus was interpreted as mechanical allodynia.\n\nMass Spectrometry (LC-APCI/MS-MS)\nDRG samples used for mass spectrometry analysis were prepared according to the method described (\nHong\net al.\n, 2009\n). Briefly, L4-L5 and L6-S2 DRGs from control and WA stressed rats (n = 5 each group) that had not undergone surgery or colorectal distention were dissected on day 11 of the WA stress procedure, combined and homogenized in 2.0 ml acetonitrile containing 114 pmol of deuterated Arachidonic Acid. The supernatants were concentrated under a constant stream of nitrogen and subjected to LC-APCI/MS analysis. Analysis of 2-AG (2-Arachidonoylglycerol) was performed using a ThermoFinnigan Surveyor HPLC system in conjunction with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan TSQ Quantum Ultra AM, West Palm Beach, FL). For quantitative analysis, the peak area of 2-AG ions from the test samples was compared and normalized. The standard curve was obtained by injecting known amounts of 2-AG ranging between 1 pM and 100 \u03bcM and plotting peak area versus molar concentration.\n\nAdministration of corticosterone in vitro\nFor\nin vitro\nstudies, DRGs from control rats were isolated and treated with corticosterone as previously described (\nHong\net al.\n, 2011\n). Briefly, L4-L5 and L6-S2 DRGs from control rats were isolated, chopped and incubated in Minimal Essential Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum and 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor in 95% air + 5% CO\n2\nat 37\u00b0C. Corticosterone (10 \u03bcM) was added to the incubation wells and incubated for 24 hours. The DRGs were then collected for Western blot analysis.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nDRG neurons from T5-T6, L4-L5 and L6-S2 regions in rats that had not undergone surgery or VMR measurement were taken on day 11 of the WA stress procedure. Protein were extracted and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS-PAGE blotting and probed with specific antibodies for CB1 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), TRPV1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), COX-2 (Cell Signaling Tech, Boston, MA), FAAH (Cayman Chemical), Na\nv\n1.7 (Cell Signaling Tech), Na\nv\n1.8 (Sigma-Aldrich), and \u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4\u00b0C, overnight, and subsequently with secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) for 1 h. The X-ray films were developed using SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescent Substrate Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nL4-L5 and L6-S2 DRG neurons from rats that had not undergone surgery or colorectal distention were removed on day 11 (WA group) or day 14 (WA-Rec group) of the WA stress procedure for immunofluorescence staining. Primary antibodies used for overnight incubation were anti-TRPV1 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-CB1 (1:300; Cayman Chemical), anti-sodium channel Na\nV\n1.7 (1:500; Cell Signaling Tech), and anti-sodium channel Na\nV\n1.8 (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich). Other primary antibodies used in some experiments were the antibodies of peripherin, a marker of small C-fibers (1:250; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and NF200, a marker of large A-\u03b2 fibers (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 (1:400) and Alexa Fluor 594 (1:500) from Molecular Probes (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) were used for the 2 h incubation. Sections were mounted with an anti-fade fluorescence mounting medium for microscope viewing.\n\nImaging analysis\nImmunofluorescence stained DRG sections were viewed under a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope, and digitized images were acquired covering the entire DRG in one field under low magnification. Images from 4 to 5 different DRG sections from each rat were pooled for counting in each group. In each rat, 1000\u20131500 total DRG neurons were counted. Neurons were judged to be positive if they had mean brightness values greater than the corresponding control value stained with the secondary antibody alone.\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo examine the VMR in response to CRD pressures, the electromyographic amplitudes, represented by calculating the AUC, were normalized as percentage of baseline response for the highest pressure (60 mm Hg) for each rat and then averaged for each group of rats. The effects of stress and/or pharmacologic treatment on the VMR to CRD was analyzed using a repeated-measures two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test comparisons. The differences in the thermal and mechanical sensitivity between control and WA or WA-Rec groups were compared by using 2-tail Student\nt\ntest. Unpaired Student\nt\ntest was used to examine the data for the protein expression obtained from Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results were expressed as means \u00b1 standard error.\nP\n< 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Timed pregnant female dams were obtained from Charles River (Baltimore, MD) and checked daily to determine the day of birth which was deemed postnatal day 1 (PN1). Within 24 hr of birth, litters were culled to 10 pups, with equal males and females when possible. On PN10 the dam and pups were placed in a clean cage and transported to the laboratory for either the carotid artery ligation followed by hypoxia or sham surgery. Pups were weighed, sexed and assigned randomly to experimental condition.\n\nHypoxia Ischemia Procedure\nA modified version of the Rice-Vannucci perinatal HI procedure was used (\nRice et al., 1981\n). Pups were gently placed in a supine position with the snout in a small nose cone and anesthetized with 3.0% isoflourane for 1 min, and then 1.5% for the remaining time required to complete the surgery (~4.5 min). The right carotid artery was isolated, ligated twice, and severed between the ligations. The pups were then placed in a large open jar within a circulating water bath (37\u00b0 C) for 25 min. This was sufficient time for recovery from anesthesia, evidenced by normal breathing and color. Pups were then returned to the dam in a quiet area of the laboratory for 1 hr to permit feeding. To induce hypoxia, pups were placed in glass jars for delivery of 8% O2:92% N2 in the water bath (37\u00b0 C) for 1 hr. After hypoxia and treatment, pups remained in the large open jar in the water bath for 2 hr to maintain body temperature. Sham operated control pups were anesthetized for the average surgery time, incised and sutured, and treated the same as hypoxic ischemic animals with the exception that they were warmed in room air conditions while litter mates underwent hypoxia.\n\nExperiment 1A and 1B: Sex differences in cell genesis after HI\nMale and female rats were subjected to HI or sham surgery as described. Rats were injected with a single dose of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 100 mg/kg; Sigma Aldrich) 48 hr (\nFigure 2\n; Experiment 1A) or 7 days (\nFigure 3\n; Experiment 1B) after HI. The following day, pups were transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline and 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were post-fixed for 48 hr and allowed to sink in 30% sucrose prior to cryosectioning. Rats with severe injury, indicated by formation of a cyst in the right hemisphere were excluded from analysis. For Experiment 1A, the number of pups in each group was: Male Control n=8, Female Control n=8, Male HI n=7, Female HI n=7. For Experiment 1B, the number of pups per group was: Male Control n=5, Male HI n=7, Female Control n=7, Female HI n=5.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nBrdU photographs of BrdU immunohistochemistry in male and female rat pups subjected to HI at PN10 and perfused 72 hr later.

Examples of cells and cell clusters considered immunopostive for BrdU are highlighted with arrows. DG=dentate gyrus.\nFigure 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nCell genesis in the hippocampus increases in females bilaterally compared to males following HI 48 hr after HI. Cell genesis was estimated in CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyrus (DG) of pups subjected to HI on PN10. Mean (\u00b1SEM) estimated BrdU+ cells in the hippocampus of rat pups treated with BrdU (100 mg/kg) 2 days after HI and sacrificed 24 hr later were quantified. Contra=Hemisphere contralateral to carotid artery ligation; lpsi=hemisphere ipsilateral to carotid artery ligation. * indicate a significant difference in HI females compared to same sex controls and males.\nImmunohistochemistry and Stereological Quantification:\nTwelve series of 45 \u03bcM sections were collected throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampus. For BrdU staining, sections were mounted to slides and heated in 0.1 M citric acid (pH 6.0). Slides were then rinsed in PBS, incubated in trypsin for 10 min, denatured in 2 M HCl:PBS for 30 min, rinsed, incubated with mouse antibodies to bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) cells (BD Biosciences diluted 1:500) with 0.5% Tween-20. The next day, slides were rinsed, incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse (1:200, Vector) for 60 min, rinsed, incubated with avidin-biotin complex (1:500; Vector), rinsed and reacted in 0.01% DAB. Slides were counterstained with cresyl violet, dehydrated, cleared and coverslipped.\nStereological Quantification of BrdU+ cells:\nUnbiased sterology was used to estimate the number of BrdU+ cells in the hippocampus using the optical dissector method (\nWest et al., 1991\n). StereoInvestigator software (MBFbioscience, Williston, VT) was used to delineate CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyrus (DG) in each hemisphere. CA1 included the layers oriens, pyramidal cell layer, striatum radiatum and lacunosum molecular (as described in\nLong et al., 1998\n). Boundaries of CA3 were defined by the dense pyramidal cell layer and included the areas of dense BrdU+ cells just outside of the cresyl-stained pyramidal cell layer but not extending into less cell dense areas of the neuropil. A similar approach was used to define CA3 was used to quantify cell genesis in the DG. Analysis of BrdU+ cells in pups treated 48 hr after HI was conducted on the left and right hemisphere of 4 sections of the dorsal hippocampus. BrdU+ cells were quantified in both hemispheres in 6 sections of the dorsal hippocampus in pups treated with BrdU 7 days after HI. The counting frame area was 448 \u03bcm with a minimum of 35 counting sites per subregion. The average mounted tissue thickness was 20.5 \u03bcm. Optical dissector quantification schemes (i.e., dissector dimensions and sampling frequency) were determined based on pilot work in sham operated, which established parameters yielding a coefficient of error less than 0.1. An estimation of total cells per subregion was generated for each animal.\n\nExperiment 2: The effect of estradiol on functional outcomes in male and female rats\nPups were subjected to HI or sham surgery as described. Immediately after HI, pups were randomly assigned to treatment condition, balancing sex and surgery condition within litter. Each pup received a subcutaneous injection of sesame oil or estradiol in sesame oil (10 \u03bcg) subcutaneously immediately after hypoxia. This treatment was repeated 24 hr later. The dose of estradiol is equivalent to that given to adults to induce sexual receptivity but is 10X\u2019s lower than that given to newborns to induce masculinization. The timing was designed to increase circulating levels of estradiol within hrs of HI and to maintain levels for up to 48 hrs. Pups were weaned at PN21, and housed with same-sex littermates in groups of 2\u20133 for the duration of the experiment. Pups were tested on a series of behavioral assays. The number of rats in each group was: Male Control+Oil n=8, Male Control+E2 n=8, Male HI+Oil n=9, Male HI+E2 n=9, Female Control+Oil n=7, Female Control+E2 n=7, Female HI+Oil n=8, Female HI+E2 n=8. The experimental timeline is presented in\nFigure 1\n.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nExperimental timeline for Experiment 2. Animals were subjected to HI or sham surgery on PN10 and treated with estradiol (E2) or oil immediately after hypoxia and 24 hr later. Rats were then tested on a series of behavioral tasks. Social play was tested in the dark phase on PN28-35.\nReflex and Motor testing: Righting Reflex\nOn PN14, pups were tested for simple reflexes. To test righting reflexes, or the ability to turn from their back upright to their feet, pups were placed on their backs on a heating pad (36\u00b0 C). This simple test has been used to detect motor deficits after HI by others (i.e.,\nFan et al., 2005\n) and can detect deficits in motor coordination in young rodents presumably due to subcortical dysfunction (i.e.,\nAltman & Sudarshan, 1975\n). Each pup was released, and the amount of time taken to turn over in seconds was recorded. This was repeated 3 times, with a 3 min interval between each trial and the average determined.\nNegative geotaxis\nAlso on PN14, each rat was placed on a ramp with a 25 degree incline, head pointing downwards. This assessment determines whether the rat can restore postural stability by coordinated movements to point their head upwards. Though interpretation of this behavioral tendency has been called into question (see\nMotz & Alberts, 2005\n), we consistently find that uninjured pups quickly reorient their position to point their heads up at this age. Versidry was placed on the incline to enable traction. The time to turn to face up the slope was measured 3 times, with a 3 min interval between trials and the average determined.\nSuspension on a wire\nOn PN18, the rats\u2019 front paws were placed on a metal dowel suspended above a padded bin. The trial period was a maximum of 90 seconds. Rats were considered successfulif they were able to bring their rear paws to the dowel and hold on (\nDean et al., 2012\n). If the rat fell, it was considered to have failed. The percentage of rats in each group to successfully grasp the dowel with their hindlimbs was calculated. This test has also been used to detect motor deficits after neonatal HI (\nFan et al., 2005\n). We find that this behavior is transiently disrupted by HI in the developing rat as reported by others (i.e.,\nHermans et al., 1993\n).\nOpen Field\nOn PN27, rats were placed in an open plexiglass arena (49 cm length, 37 cm wide, 24 cm high) under bright lights for 5 min. The floor of the arena was delineated into a perimeter and a center region, with lines dissecting the perimeter. The session was taped and scored offline. The amount of time each rat spent in the center of the arena, number of lines crossed and latency to enter the center were measured.\nNovel Object Recognition\nOn PN28-29, rats were placed in the same behavior arena as was used for the open field test, but without a gridded floor and under dim lighting to permit acclimation to the testing chamber. On PN30, two identical objects were placed in the arena (i.e., ink bottles, flask stoppers). The rat was allowed to explore freely for 5 min. Following a 1 hr retention interval, one object was replaced with a novel one in the same location as the object it replaced. The rat was again permitted to explore freely for 5 min. The now familiar object was tested with a novel object in the same location 24 hr later. Rats are capable of retention of the familiar object for at least 24 hr at this age (\nReger et al., 2009\n). All test sessions were video recorded and scored offline. The amount of time the rat spent investigating each object was recorded. To be considered object exploration, the rat had to be touching and/or sniffing the object and not looking elsewhere. Data are presented as (\nTime spent exploring novel object-Time spent exploring familiar object)/Total time spent exploring both objects.\nTherefore, a ratio of 0 means the rats spent the same amount of time with both objects. A ratio of 0.5 means the rat spent twice as much time with the novel object.\nSocial Play\nOn PN28-35, rats were separated from their cagemates 1\u20131.5 hr before onset of the dark cycle. During this time, each rat received a distinct marking on the back. At the end of this period of social isolation, same sex groups, consisting of 4\u20135 rats with at least 1 rat from each experimental condition, were placed in the behavior arena with cobb bedding under red lights. After a 30 sec delay, video recording began. Rats remained in the play arena for 10 min per session. Play behavior was scored offline. The number of playful approaches and successful pinnings of another rat were counted for the first 5 min of sessions 1\u20134, 6 and 8, omitting the first 30 sec of video to permit the rats to acclimate to the arena. Play behavior was robust at this time, and persisted for at least 5\u20138 min.\nMorris Water Maze\nOn PN37-38, rats began acclimation to the Morris Water Maze task. Each day, rats were placed in the opaque pool with the submerged, invisible escape platform. For acclimation, the pool was enclosed in a plain curtain, with no spatial cues. Rats were placed in the pool from various starting points and allowed to search for the platform for a maximum of 90 s. If the rat did not locate the platform, it was gently guided to the platform. Each acclimation day consisted of 4 trials. The platform was moved to a different location for each trial. This non-spatial training reduces expression of sex differences in performance strategy that can obscure assessment of spatial learning ability (\nPerrot-Sinal et al, 1996\n;\nMorris, 1984\n). The following day, spatial cues were placed on the curtain surrounding the pool. Rats were given 4 daily training trials each day for 3 days (PN39-41), with the starting point varying on each trial. The maximum trial duration was 90 s. The latency to reach the platform was measured. On PN42, rats returned to the pool for a 90 sec probe trial in which the escape platform was removed. The probe trial was video recorded and the amount of time spent in each quadrant was recorded and measured offline.\nHippocampal Volume\nThe day after the probe trial (PN43), rats were perfused and brains collected. One male sham operated rat from the oil treatment group was excluded from histological analysis due to poor perfusion. No other rats were excluded, irrespective of the magnitude of injury. A 1:12 series was collected through the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampus. Sections were 45 \u03bcm thick and mounted to slides. Sections were hydrated in descending concentrations of ethanol and then placed in 0.1% cresyl violet with 1% acetic acid. Sections were then placed in 1% acetic acid in water until white matter tracts were visible and the principle cell layers of the hippocampus were clear. Sections were dehydrated in ethanol baths, placed in xylene and coverslipped. For each rat, 8\u20139 sections were analyzed for total hippocampal volume in each hemisphere using Cavalieri method. Sections were stained with cresyl violet and hippocampal volume was measured using Neurolucida software (MBFbioscience, Williston, VT).\nStatistical Analyses\nSPSS version 18 was used for all statistical analyses (Armonk, NY). Repeated measures ANOVA with BrdU positive cells in the Contralateral and Ipsilateral hippocampus as the within subjects factors and Sex and Surgery as the between subjects factors was conducted for CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyrus (DG) for Experiment 1A and 1B. Behavioral tests were also analyzed by ANOVA with hormone treatment included as a factor. Males and females were analyzed separately in order to retain sufficient power to detect within sex effects."

    "Methods": "Animals and Treatments\nAdult male Sprague Dawley rats (P90, 330\u2013360g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). They were housed under conditions of constant temperature (21\u201323\u00b0C) and humidity on a reverse 12 hour light/dark cycle with food and water available\nad libitum\n. Animals were allowed to adapt to the new environment for 2 days before the experiments. The animal procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) animal use guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Drexel University College of Medicine.\nLY39, (+)-MK801 maleate, and Actinomycin-D were purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Minneapolis, MN) and Rapamycin was purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA).\n\nAcute treatment for Western blot assay\nLY39 at a dose of 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg (single dose, intraperitoneally, I.P.) was administered one hour before the rats were sacrificed for tissue collection as a peak brain concentration of a similar compound\nLY379268\ncould be reached within 30 min post I.P. administration (\nBond et al., 2000\n). For electrophysiological recording, a single injection of LY39 (3.0 mg/kg, I.P.) was administered one hour before the animals were sacrificed for\nex vivo\nslices. In both cases, saline solution (0.9 % sodium chloride) was used as a vehicle control with 5 animals in each treatment group. In additional experiments, rapamycin (1 mg/kg) (\nAutry et al., 2011\n), actinomycin-D (act-D, 0.5 mg/kg) (\nMiller et al., 2014\n), or saline was administered 30 min before LY39 or saline injection. All animals were deeply anesthetized with Euthasol (0.2 ml/kg, Virbac Animal Health) and were decapitated per the approved IACUC protocol.\n\nAdult rat perfusion\nTo preserve brain tissue quality, adult rats were anesthetized with Euthasol and then rapidly perfused with intracardiac injection of 60 ml ice-cold sucrose buffer (in mM: 320 sucrose, 4 HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.4, 2 EGTA, 1 sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 sodium fluoride, 10 sodium pyrophosphate) for Western blotting, or of 60 ml cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, in mM: 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 1 MgSO\n4\n, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, and 10 dextrose, pH 7.4) for electrophysiology.\n\nSynaptic membrane protein collection\nThe animals were decapitated, and the brains were quickly removed. The forebrain containing the prelimbic area was dissected, homogenized in cold lysis buffer (in mM: 320 sucrose, 4 HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.4, 2 EGTA, 1 sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 sodium fluoride, 10 sodium pyrophosphate, with 1 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin and 1 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin). The tissues were centrifuged at 1,000g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C to remove large cell fragments and nuclear materials, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged again at 15,000g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C to harvest cytoplasmic proteins in the supernatant. The pellet from this spin was resuspended in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 15,000g for an additional 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C to produce synaptosomes. The synaptosomal fraction was then hypoosmotically lysed and centrifuged at 25,000g for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C to collect the crude synaptosomal pellet. Lysis buffer was added to the pellet to make the final samples, which were then stored in \u221280\u00b0C for future use, or aliquots were made and stored at \u221220\u00b0C for immediate use.\n\nWestern blots\nA bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay was performed to determine protein concentration. The protein sample was mixed with 4\u00d7 laemmli and lysis buffer, boiled for 5 minutes, and separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon PVDF membranes (Millipore, IPVH00010). The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat milk and probed with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. Each blot was used to probe multiple antibodies, including anti-mouse NR1 (Invitrogen, 32-0500, 1:5000), anti-rabbit NR2A (Millipore, 04-901, 1:2,500), anti-mouse NR2B (Millipore, 05-920, 1:2000), anti-rabbit pNR2B-Tyr1472 (CALBIOCHEM, 1:1000), anti-rabbit pNR2B-Ser1303 (Millipore, 07-398, 1:1000), anti-rabbit Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, 2938S, 1:1000), anti-rabbit pAkt-Ser473 (Cell Signaling Technology, 4060S, 1:1000), anti-rabbit ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, 4695S, 1:10,000), anti-rabbit pERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, 4370S, 1:10,000), anti-rabbit GSK3b (Cell Signaling Technology, 9315S, 1:20,000), anti-rabbit pGSK3b-Ser9 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9336S, 1:2000), anti-rabbit mTOR (Cell Signaling Technology, 2983S, 1:2000), anti-rabbit pmTOR-S2448 (Cell Signaling Technology, 2983S, 1:1000), anti-4E-BP1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9452, 1:1000), anti-p4E-BP1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 236B4, 1:500-1000), and anti-mouse actin (Sigma, A5316, 1:100,000) served as a loading control. Membranes were stripped for 30 minutes with Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Scientific, 21063) between each different set of primary antibodies. Specifically, we probed phospho-antibodies first and then probed antibodies against each corresponding total protein. The blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) at room temperature for 1 hour. After primary and secondary antibody incubation, Tris buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) was used to rinse the membranes three times for 20 minutes each. Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences). Each group included at least 5 animals and samples from each animal were run at least 4 times to minimize inter-blot variance. The data were analyzed with Image J (NIH) and Student\u2019s t-test was used for statistical analysis. The data were presented as mean \u00b1 SEM.\n\nElectrophysiological recording in prefrontal cortical slices\nOne hour after saline or LY39 injection, the animals were anesthetized and brains were removed. Coronal slices of the forebrain containing the prelimbic area (mPFC) were cut at 300 \u03bcm within an ice-cold oxygenated sucrose solution (in mM: 87 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 25 NaHCO\n3\n, 75 sucrose, 25 glucose, 0.5 CaCl\n2\n, 7.0 MgSO\n4\n, pH 7.4) using a Leica VT 1200S Vibratome (Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL). Slices were transferred to a holding chamber, submerged in oxygenated Ringer\u2019s solution (in mM: 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 1 MgSO\n4\n, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, and 10 dextrose, pH 7.4) at 35\u00b0C for one hour. The PFC slices were transferred into a heated (36\u00b0\u201337\u00b0C) recording chamber mounted on an Olympus BX51 upright microscope (Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA), where the slices were bathed in oxygenated Ringer\u2019s solution. Neurons were visualized with the assistance of infrared differential interference contrast via a Panasonic CCD video camera. Borosilicate glass pipettes purchased from the Harvard Apparatus (Holliston, MA) were pulled with a P-97 puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) to create patch electrodes with a resistance of 5\u20137 M\u03a9. The electrical signals were amplified and filtered at 1 kHz with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier, converted through a DigiData 1322A, and recorded through pCLAMP 9.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).\nTo record NMDAR- and AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), a Cs\n+\n-intracellular solution (in mM: 110 D-gluconic acid, 110 CsOH, 10 CsCl\n2\n, 1 EGTA, 1 CaCl\n2\n, 10 HEPES, 1 Mg-ATP at pH 7.3 adjusted with CsOH and 5 QX-314) was filled into the pipette in order to block sodium and potassium channels. Under voltage clamp mode, AMPAR-mEPSCs were recorded with membrane potential held at \u221270 mV in the presence of sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX, 0.5 \u03bcM) and GABA\nA\nreceptor antagonist picrotoxin (100 \u03bcM), whereas NMDAR-mEPSCs were recorded with membrane potential held at +60 mV in the presence of TTX (0.5 \u03bcM), picrotoxin (100 \u03bcM) and AMPAR antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX, 20 \u03bcM). A 5-min stable baseline EPSC recording was recorded for each cell to ensure the reliability of the recording, and then the recording was continued for another 5 min under each condition. The series resistance was compensated and constantly monitored by injection of \u2212100 pa current pulse (150 ms duration).\n\nData analysis\nFor the Western blot assay, the relative expression of proteins was evaluated by measuring the optical density of each band with Image J software. The densitometry of total protein was normalized to actin, whereas phosphorylation of a protein was normalized to its respective total protein level.\nFor electrophysiological recording, data were analyzed with Clampfit 9.2 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells without a stable baseline recording and cells with a series resistance change of >20% were excluded from data analysis. To analyze the mEPSC events, a typical AMPAR-mediated mEPSC or an NMDAR-mediated mEPSC was selected to create a template, and then mEPSC events within a 5-min recording were detected by the Clampfit software with a threshold set at 5. All detected events were checked to ensure reliability of the method. The mEPSC frequency (number of events) was normalized to events per second (Hz) and the mEPSC amplitude was measured from the onset to the peak of the events.\nAll data were presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Data between two groups were analyzed with unpaired Student\u2019s t-tests, and comparisons of multiple groups were carried out with ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test to compare between individual groups. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad software Inc., La Jolla, CA) and a p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Surgical procedures and post-operative care were performed in compliance with protocols approved by Drexel University College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and followed National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.\n\nSurgical procedures and animal groups\nAdult (225\u2013250g) female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.) were used for this study (n=5 per group).\nBriefly, rats were anesthetized using 5% Isoflurane in a plexiglass induction chamber and maintained on 1\u20133% Isoflurane throughout surgery. The T12 spinal cord was exposed by dorsal laminectomy. A 2\u20133 mm long segment of spinal cord was removed by vacuum aspiration using a glass micropipette. The complete transection (Tx) lesion cavity was filled with gel foam saturated with saline to achieve hemostasis. Pre-degenerated peripheral nerve (PN) segments were harvested from donor rats after cutting of the tibial nerve 7 days prior to grafting (\nFigure 1\n). At the time of spinal cord injury, donor rats were anesthetized with Ketamine (60 mg/kg, Ketaset, Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) and Xylazine (10 mg/kg, Anased, Lloyd Laboratories, Shenandoah, IA) and an 8\u201310 mm length of PN was harvested for use as a graft. One end of the PNG was apposed to the midline dorsal portion of the caudal lesion cavity wall to allow ingrowth of ascending axons. The distal end of the graft was left unapposed to spinal cord tissue, laying on top of the adjacent vertebral process (\nFigure 2\n). Donor rats were euthanized with Euthasol (390 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium and 50 mg/kg phenytoin sodium IP, Virbac, Fort Worth, TX) after harvesting peripheral nerve segments. Spinal cord injured rats received the antibiotic Cefazolin (25 mg/ml, Sandoz, Princeton, NJ) and the analgesic Sustained Release-Buprenorphine (1.0 mg/kg, Zoopharm, Laramie, WY) at the time of surgery. Urinary bladder was expressed twice a day throughout the survival period. Graft recipient rats received daily subcutaneous Cyclosporine A (10mg/kg, Teva Czech Industries, Sellersville, PA) for 2 weeks (wks) to prevent graft rejection, beginning 3 days prior to grafting before changing to oral administration (1mg/ml) continuing throughout the experiment.\nFigure 1. Experimental approach for nerve grafting.\nOpen in a new tab\nTibial nerve is cut in donor rat and harvested 7 days later. Recipient rats receive T12 transection and an intraspinal graft of the harvested nerve segment apposing the caudal end of the lesion cavity.\nFigure 2. Animal groups and experimental timeline.\nOpen in a new tab\n9 animal groups were divided into 2 categories. Groups 1 and 2 were used to quantify the number of regenerating neurons in the presence or absence of Ex. Groups 3\u20139 were used for mRNA analyses. Uninjured control rats were not exercised (Group 3). All other groups started exercise at the beginning of week 2 (5 days post injury) for 5 days/week and 30 min/day. The Tx rats were sacrificed at 2 wks post injury (Groups 4, 5) or 4 wks post injury (groups 6, 7). Tx + PNG rats were sacrificed 4 wks post injury (groups 8, 9). Tx= transection, Wks= weeks, Ex= exercise, TB= True Blue.\n\nQuantification of number of neurons regenerating their axon into PNG\nFigure 2\noutlines the experimental groups used; Groups 1\u20132 were used to assess extent of regeneration into PNG \u00b1 EX.\nGroup 1 (Tx 5 wks + PNG)\nrats sustained a complete transection injury and a PNG with no further experimentation for 4 weeks. G\nroup 2 (Tx 5 wks + PNG + Ex)\nrats began cycling exercise 5 days post SCI and PN grafting (at the beginning of week 2 and continued till the end of week 5. For both groups, 4 weeks after injury, the distal end of the PNG was exposed, trimmed by 1 mm and exposed to gel foam soaked with TB (2% True Blue diaceturate salt, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to label by retrograde transport neurons that had extended their axon into the PNG. At the end of week 5, animals were euthanized with an overdose of Euthasol and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. We harvested T13-L5 spinal cord and T13 to L6 DRGs bilaterally. Tissue was stored in 30% sucrose at 4\u00b0C before preparing cryostat sections.\n\nmRNA analysis in injured (no PNG) or regenerating neurons (with PNG)\nGroups 3\u20139 were used to assess changes in mRNA expression after SCI and the intervention of exercise and PNG separately and in combination.\nGroup 3\nrats served as uninjured controls and received no injury or PNG or Ex. Rats in Groups 4\u20139 received a T12 Tx and all groups were used to study exercise related changes in gene expression. Rats in Groups 8 and 9 received a PNG after Tx (see below). Rats in Groups 3\u20139 were euthanized at appropriate times with an overdose of Euthasol and perfused with 2% paraformaldehyde and stored in 30% sucrose at 4\u00b0C.\nGroups 4 (Tx 2 wks) and 5 (Tx 2 wks + Ex)\nrats were used to measure acute effects of exercise in injured neurons. Ten rats received aT12 Tx and a piece of gel foam saturated in 2% TB was placed in the lesion cavity for 30 minutes to label axotomized neurons by retrograde transport of this fluorescent tracer. Group 4 rats were not exercised but cycling exercise began 5 days after injury (at the beginning of week 2) for Group 5 rats. All rats were euthanized 2 wks after SCI. A 2 wks post injury group was not prepared for the cell counting experiment because only a few axons are seen in the PNGs at that time point.\nGroups 6 (Tx 4 wks) and 7 (Tx 4 wks + Ex)\nrats were used to measure sustained effects of exercise in injured neurons. Ten rats received Tx and TB labeling similar to Groups 4 and 5. Group 6 rats were not exercised while Group 7 rats received cycling exercise for 3 weeks. Both groups of rats were euthanized at 4 wks post injury.\nGroups 8 (Tx 4 wks + PNG) and 9 (Tx 4 wks + PNG + Ex)\nrats were used to measure sustained effects of the presence of a PNG alone or the effects of exercise on regenerating neurons. Ten rats received Tx and acute placement of a PNG apposed as described above. Unlike Groups 1 and 2, the TB for these rats was placed at the distal end of the graft at the time of grafting. This allowed us to label regenerating neurons whose axons had reached the distal graft end without initiating changes in gene expression that would result from trimming of the distal graft end.\n\nCycling exercise\nRats were supported in a sling and hind limb paws dangling beneath them were secured to the pedals of a motorized cycling apparatus using surgical tape. Hind limbs were repetitively moved through a complete range of motion at 45 rpm for 30 minutes a day, 5 days per week as described previously (\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2011\n;\nHoul\u00e9 and C\u00f4t\u00e9, 2013\n).\n\nTissue preparation and Staining\nCounting the number of regenerating neurons\nAll neuron counting was done by personnel blind to the experimental condition. Blocks of spinal cord 0\u20135 mm from the graft-spinal cord interface were sectioned in a transverse plane at 30 \u03bcm on a cryostat. Sections were kept in serial order in phosphate buffer before every other section was serially mounted on a glass slide, air dried and cover slipped with Cytoseal 60 (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo MI). TB labeled neurons were counted and binned in 1 mm segments from the block closest to the graft. Using fluorescence microscopy, TB positive neurons were identified as having a rounded to oval cell body of 20\u201330 \u03bcm diameter (see\nFigure 6 a1\n) with the proximal portion of processes filled with TB and the number of TB positive cells was counted manually in each section and the sum for each region of spinal cord was figured. Blocks of lumbar spinal cord (approximately 15 mm long) were sectioned longitudinally along the dorsal-ventral axis (horizontal plane) at 30 \u03bcm and mounted in serial order. Bilateral T13-L5 DRGs were sectioned at 30 \u03bcm and mounted in serial order. The number of TB positive neurons was figured for each pair of DRGs. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD.\nFigure 6. mRNA expression in propriospinal neurons.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) T13 spinal cord grey matter (dotted line) showing regenerating neurons labeled with TB placed at distal end of a PNG and stained for GAP43 mRNA (scale bar = 200\u03bcm). The inset shows TB positive neurons. Dash lined box is the region of interest for assessing propriospinal neurons in intermediate gray. a1 shows a higher magnification image of TB positive neuron stained for GAP43 mRNA (a2) and a3 shows a merged image. Similarly, b1-b3 and c1-c3 show individual TB positive neurons stained for \u03b2actin and Neuritin mRNAs respectively (scale bar = 10\u03bcm). (B, C, D) Y-axis shows average of FISH signal intensity per neuron for GAP43, \u03b2-actin, Neuritin mRNAs respectively. X-axis shows the animal groups. * indicates significant difference (p<0.05). + indicates significant difference (p<0.05) from uninjured control.\nGene expression in neurons\nFor fluorescent\nin situ\nhybridization (FISH), T13 spinal cord (between 1\u20132 mm caudal to the lesion) was sectioned in a transverse plane at 10 \u03bcm thickness and L1 DRGs were sectioned at 10 \u03bcm. Sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus slides ( isher rand, Pitts urgh, PA), air dried overnight and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. FISH reaction was performed as described previously using digoxygenin-tagged oligonucleotide probes for GAP43, \u03b2-actin and Neuritin mRNAs (\nMerianda et al., 2013\n). The probe sequences have been published (\nWillis et al., 2007\n). Scrambled probe was used as a negative control. Oligonucleotides were prepared with 3\u20135 \u201cInt Amino Modifier C6 dT\u201d modifications per 5 mer sequence (Integrated DNA Technologies, San Diego, CA). Probes were incubated overnight in digoxygenin (Digoxigenin-3-O-methylcarbonyl-\u03b5-aminocaproic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and N,N-Dimethylformamide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) solution and purified using bench top column purification method (mini Quick Spin DNA Columns, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The hybridized probes were identified by immunofluorescence using anti-digoxygenin antibody tagged with Cy3 (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Five sections per animal through the L1 DRG and T13 spinal cord intermediate gray were analyzed for neurons expressing each mRNA. All TB positive neurons in 5 sections through each region were analyzed. This yielded at least 25 neurons per animal for analysis. Images were taken at 63X using a Leica epifluorescence microscope and all images were matched for exposure parameters. Intensity of the mRNA signal was quantified in individual TB labeled neurons using ImageJ and averaged between animals. Since tracer injection may affect gene expression, uninjured controls (Group 3) did not receive TB, so equal numbers of neurons of size and location comparable to injury only animals (Group 4) were randomly selected for analyses in corresponding regions of T13 spinal cord. It is possible that exercise has an effect on the mRNA levels of non-injured, non TB positive neurons, as suggested in\nFigure 6A\n, however, in the present study we focused specifically on injured/regenerating neurons labeled with TB. Therefore, except in the uninjured control group, only TB positive neurons were included in the analyses.\n\nStatistical Analyses\nStatistical analysis was performed using SigmaPlot 11.0 (Systat Software, Inc.). Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Differences across groups in number of regenerating propriospinal neurons by distance caudal to the injury site (\nFigure 4b\n) or DRG level (\nFigure 5\n) were determined using a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures for group vs. location and a post-hoc Bonferroni\u2019s multiple comparisons test. Significant differences across groups for remaining cell count analyses (\nFigures 4A and 4C\n) and for mRNA expression data ( igures 6 and 7) were determined y Student\u2019s t-test. For all tests, the significance level was set to p < 0.05.\nFigure 4. Exercise increases regeneration by spinal cord neurons.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Total number of regenerating neurons within 5mm distance from injury site is significantly increased with exercise. (B) Number of regenerating neurons decreases as distance increases from the injury site. Post injury exercise increases the number of regenerating neurons within 1mm of the lesion. (C) Total number of regenerating neurons within lumbar spinal cord increases significantly with exercise. * indicates significant difference (p<0.05).\nFigure 5. Exercise does not enhance axon regeneration from sensory neurons into PNGs.\nOpen in a new tab\nThe number of regenerating sensory neurons decreased as distance increased from the injury site. No significant change with exercise was observed in regenerating neurons from DRGs at any level."

    "Methods": "C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to a control (no EAE) group, or one of four myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced EAE groups: vehicle, lenalidomide, nanoceria, or lenalidomide plus nanoceria. During a 23 day period, clinical EAE symptoms were evaluated daily, and MRI brain scans were performed at 11-13 days and 20-22 days. Histological and biochemical analyses of brain tissue samples were performed to quantify myelin loss and local inflammation."

    "Methods": "Animals and surgery\n4 and 14 month old (MO) C57BL/6, female mice (obtained from the National Institute on Aging) were used to model young (~18 years old) and middle-aged (~45 years old) humans respectively (\nQuinn, 2005\n). A total of 50 animals were used to generate data for the current study. One animal from each age group was excluded due to abnormalities in the force vs. time curve generated by the impact device at the time of SCI. These abnormalities are indicative of bone hits or instability in the spinal cord at the time of injury. Additionally, one animal from each group was excluded from anatomic quantification due technical difficulties in tissue blocking (the lesion epicenters were outside the cut tissue sections). The n for each outcome measure is indicated in the figure legends. Animals were anesthetized with intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). A laminectomy was performed to expose the T9 spinal cord and a mild to moderate-thoracic SCI was produced using the Infinite Horizons (IH) injury device (50 kdyn displacement) (\nScheff et al., 2003\n). After injury, muscle and skin layers were closed using monofilament suture. Post-surgically, animals received one subcutaneous injection of buprenorphrine-SR (1 mg/kg) in 1cc saline and recovered from the surgery in a warming cage overnight. Mice received subcutaneous injections of antibiotics (5mL/mg, Enrofloxacin (2.27%); Norbook Inc, Lenexa, KS) in 1ml of saline for 5 days. Wound healing and food and water intake were monitored throughout the course of the study. Bladder expression was performed on injured mice twice daily until autonomic bladder expression returned. Animals were housed in a standard environment with ad libitum access to food and water. All procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines and protocols of the Office of Responsible Research Practices and with approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of Kentucky.\n\nRNA isolation and gene expression\nMice designated for RNA analysis were anesthetized and then transcardially perfused with sterile DEPC-PBS. A 5-mm spinal cord segment, centered on the injury site, was then rapidly dissected, submerged in RNAlater stabilization solution (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and stored at 4\u00b0C. For RNA isolation, spinal cord tissues were removed from RNAlater solution and homogenized in 1 ml Trizol reagent (Life Technologies). Total RNA was isolated based on the manufacturer's protocol, with an additional phase separation using BCP, precipitation with isopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and wash of the isolated RNA in 70% ethanol. Then, 1 \u03bcg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Life Technologies). Gene expression analysis was performed by using Taqman microarray cards loaded with a mixture of 100ng cDNA sample and Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and then run using the default thermal-cycling conditions by ViiA\u2122 7 Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies). Expression of genes was normalized to 18S mRNA for each sample.\n\nBehavioral analysis\nThe Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) was used to score hindlimb movements as previously described (\nBasso et al., 2006\n). Animals were assessed in an open field for 4 min pre-surgically and at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post injury (dpi) by two trained observers. The performance of left and right hindlimbs was rated separately and averaged to generate the BMS scores and subscores. The grid walk was adapted from (\nMcEwen and Springer, 2006\n). Animals traversed a horizontal ladder (92 cm in length and 16.5 cm in width) over rungs 4mm in diameter spaced 1.2 cm apart from an open start platform to an enclosed black goal box. All experimental animals were habituated to the apparatus prior to surgery. The gridwalk was videotaped and the total number of foot slips over 30 continuous rungs was quantified. Gait analysis was conducted using the Digigait System (Mouse Specifics, Framingham, MA). Mice were pre-trained at a speed of 13-15 cm/s before SCI, and then tested at 27 dpi at a speed of 10-12 cm/s. For each test, at least 5 complete step cycles were recorded. A high-speed digital camera captured the movement of each paw and then footage was analyzed using the Digigait analysis software (Digigait 12.4).\n\nTissue processing and immunohistochemistry\nMice designated for histology were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with cold PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4) then with cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Spinal cords were dissected, post-fixed for 2 h in 4% PFA and then, rinsed, and stored in phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 7.4) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Tissues were then cryoprotected by immersion in 30% sucrose for 3-5 days at 4\u00b0C. Spinal cords were randomly, but evenly distributed by group into blocks in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Sakura Finetek USA, Inc., Torrance, CA) and rapidly frozen on dry ice prior to sectioning. Transverse serial sections (10 \u03bcm) were cut through each block and mounted on coated slides (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), then stored at \u221280\u00b0C before staining. Spinal cord sections were dried for an hour at 37\u00b0C and rinsed with 1\u00d7PBS. For IL-10/tomato lectin/CD86 triple staining and IL-10/GFAP double staining, sections were incubated with anti-IL-10 (1:300, Cat# ab9969, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), biotinylatyed tomato lectin (1:1000, Cat# L0651, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-CD86 (1:100, Cat# 553689, BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and anti-GFAP (1:200, Cat# GFAP, Aves, Tigard, Oregon) primary antibodies and Alexa Fluor (AF) 546 dye-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1000, Cat# A11010, Life Technologies), streptavidin-AF488 (1:1000, Cat# S32354, Life Technologies), AF 488 dye-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibody (1:1000, Cat# A11006, Life Technologies), streptavidin-AF633 (1:1000, Cat#\nS21375\n, Life Technologies) or AF 488 goat anti-chicken (1:500, Cat# F-1005, Aves) secondary antibodies using standard techniques. Slides were coverslipped with Immu-Mount (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Fluorescent images were taken using a C2+ laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc, Melville, NY). To distinguish spared spinal cord axons and myelin, spinal cord sections were double-stained with eriochrome cyanine /neurofilamment (EC/NF, anti-NF primary antibody 1:1000, Cat# NFH, Aves) as reported previously (\nFenn et al., 2014\n). Brightfield images were captured with an Olympus Provis AX 80 photomicroscope (Olympus Optical).\nLesion volume was calculated by using Cavalieri method on images at 100 \u03bcm intervals centered on the lesion epicenter (\nKigerl et al., 2006\n). The proportional area of macrophage activation and IL-10 expression was calculated as described previously (\nDonnelly et al., 2009\n). Background labeling was subtracted, and then a threshold value-based measurement within a predefined area was applied to quantify the density of labeling using the MetaMorph analysis program (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The MetaMorph colocalization plugin was used to analyze colocalization of IL-10 and macrophages.\n\nCell culture\nBone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) cultures were obtained from C57BL/6 mice at 8-10 weeks of age as described previously (\nLongbrake et al., 2007\n). Femurs and tibias were isolated then bone marrow was flushed into sterile tubes with washing media (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) /10% FBS, Life Technologies). Cells were triturated three to five times using syringes fit with 18 gauge needles and then centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min. After removing supernatant, red blood cells were lysed in lysis buffer (0.15 M NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, and 0.1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.4). The remaining cells were washed once in washing media, then plated at 1\u00d710\n6\ncells/ml in DMEM supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% HEPES, 0.001% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 10% FBS, and 20% supernatant from sL929 cells (a generous gift from Phillip Popovich, The Ohio State University). The sL929 supernatant (which contains macrophage colony-stimulating factor) is needed to promote differentiation of bone marrow cells into macrophages (7\u201310 d) (\nBurgess et al., 1985\n). Media was changed on days 2, 4 and 6 and then cells isolated on day 7. Cell were plated at a density of 1\u00d710\n6\n/ml and differentiated into M1 macrophages with LPS (50 ng/ml; Invivogen) plus IFN\u03b3 (20 ng/ml; eBioscience, San Diego, CA), or M2b with LPS (50 ng/ml) plus immune complex (\nMosser and Zhang, 2008\n;\nKigerl et al., 2009\n). The immune complex was prepared by mixing a ten-fold molar excess of rabbit anti-chicken egg albumin (Anti-OVA IgG, Cat# 0220-1682G, AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC) to chicken egg albumin (OVA; Cat#\nLS003059\n, Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) for 30 min at room temperature (\nMosser and Zhang, 2008\n). Stimuli were removed after 3 h incubation and then replaced with fresh Neuro2A media. Macrophage conditioned media, (MCM) was collected 3 h later and filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter before being applied to cultured Neuro2A cells or being tested for levels of IL-10 and IL-12p40 using commercially available ELISA kits (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL).\nNeuro-2a (N2a) cells (a generous gift from Chris Richard's laboratory at the University of Kentucky) were cultured in 45% DMEM and 45% Opti-MEM Reduced-Serum Medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (\nDlakic et al., 2007\n). To test cell viability, N2a cells were seeded in 48-well plates at a density of 2\u00d710\n4\ncells/200\u03bcl. After 48 h, N2a growth media was replaced by MCM and incubated for another 24 h then the MTT assay performed according the manufacture instructions (Sigma-Aldrich and (\nWang et al., 2007\n)). All measurements were done in triplicates with at least three independent experiments.\n\nStatistical analysis\nInvestigators blinded to experimental conditions performed all data acquisition and analysis. Statistical analyses were completed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software). Data were analyzed using one- or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's, or Dunnett's test for multiple comparisons. Independent sample t-tests were used when appropriate. Grubb's test (extreme studentized deviate method;\nhttp://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/grubbs1\n) was used to remove a single subject from the study based upon a statistically significant outlier value for IL-10 gene expression level that was greater than 11 standard deviations from the mean. Results were considered statistically significant at p\u22640.05. All data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM unless otherwise noted. Figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Adobe Systems) and Prism 6.0."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals and treatment\nTwelve week-old male C57BL6/J mice (Charles River Laboratories, UK; 4\u201312 per time point) received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of MPTP (SigmaAldrich, Poole, UK) at 30\u00a0mg/kg freebase dissolved in 0.9% saline solution \u2014 one injection per day for five consecutive days, before being sacrificed by decapitation at 21\u00a0days after the last injection. Control mice received saline only. This treatment was in accordance with published guidelines (\nJackson-Lewis and Przedborski, 2007\n). All procedures were in accordance with the Animals Scientific Procedures Act (1986) and approved by the Home Office (Dundee, UK). Mice were housed in appropriately sized cages with access to food and water\nad libitum\n, with a 12-hour light\u2013dark cycle (lights on at 7\u00a0am). Experiments were carried out in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive (63/2010/EU) with local ethical approval, a project license under the UK Scientific Procedures Act (1986),\n\n2.2. Drug treatments\n2-AG (3 or 5\u00a0mg/kg), CP55,940 (0.5\u00a0mg/kg) (both Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO), URB602 (10\u00a0mg/kg), JZL184 (40\u00a0mg/kg) (both Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) and DFU (25\u00a0mg/kg) (Merck, Damstadt, Germany) were dissolved\nvia\ngentle sonification in a vehicle consisting of ethanol, chremophor EL (SigmaAldrich) and saline solution at a ratio of 1:1:18\u00a0v/v/v. All drugs were administered by i.p. injection 1\u00a0\u00d7/day for 3\u00a0days prior to MPTP treatment, throughout the treatment and until sacrifice. Control mice received vehicle only. The amount of compound was chosen based on previous studies (2-AG:\nPanikashvili et al., 2001\n; CP55,940:\nFontanellas et al., 2005\n; URB602:\nComelli et al., 2007\n; JZL184:\nNomura et al., 2011\n; and DFU:\nRiendeau et al., 1997\n).\n\n2.3. Immunostaining and stereological counting\nBrains were extracted and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24\u00a0h before being cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 0.1\u00a0M phosphate buffer. Brains were then snap frozen in 2-methylbutane and stored at \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C until use. Sections of the SNpc and striatum were cut at a thickness of 30\u00a0\u03bcm on a Leica CM1900 cryostat (Leica Microsystems GmbH Wetzlar, Germany) and placed in 24- or 48-well plates in 0.1\u00a0M PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide. Immunostaining was carried out using the free-floating technique, as described previously (\nSathe et al., 2012\n), with primary antibody incubation taking place at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 48\u00a0h with rabbit anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 1:1000; Millipore, Watford, UK) in 2% normal goat serum. Sections were washed in 0.1\u00a0M PBS, mounted on gelatinised slides and counter-stained with Nissl reagent and cover-slipped with Entellan (Merck). Counting of TH- and Nissl-positive cells was performed using regular light microscopy (AxioImager M1, Carl Zeiss, Hertfordshire, UK) and the optical fractionator method (\nWest, 1993\n) (Stereo Investigator Version 7, BMF Bioscience, Magdeburg, Germany).\n\n2.4. High performance liquid chromatography analysis\nHigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection was used to measure striatal levels of dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) (\nSathe et al., 2012\n).\n\n2.5. Striatal 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP\n+\n) levels\nLiquid chromatography with on-line ultraviolet detection/tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013UV\u2013MS\u2013MS) was used to measure striatal levels of MPP\n+\nfollowing drug treatments. Briefly, mice received treatment as described above and, 90\u00a0min after a single MPTP injection (30\u00a0mg/kg), mice were sacrificed. The striata were dissected out and snap frozen on solid carbon dioxide. Striata were then prepared as described above. Following centrifugation, 2\u00a0\u03bcl of sample was injected onto a Hichrom 5\u00a0\u03bcm C18 column (Hichrom, Theale, UK). The mobile phase consisted of 80% 0.1% formic acid in water/20% 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. Flow rate was 0.2\u00a0ml/min. MPP\n+\nwas detected by a photodiode array detector set to 295\u00a0nm, and a triple quadrupole mass spectrometre with a mass to charge ratio of 170\u2013128 at 32\u00a0V and 1.9\u00a0mTorr (ThermoSurveyor PDA/TSQ Quantum, ThermoScientific, Loughborough, UK). Data were collected and processed using Xcalibur 2.0.7 SP1.\n\n2.6. Home cage observation\nLocomotor activity was recorded using 32 Activity Cages (Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy) placed in a quiet holding room. They consist of two rows of horizontal infra-red beams (1\u00a0cm distance) and monitor horizontal ambulations and vertical rearings as number of beam breaks. Animals were placed into freshly saw-dusted Perspex home cages (42\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a026.5\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015\u00a0cm). Animals were placed into the novel cage and allowed to freely explore the environment for 60\u00a0min. Beam breaks due to horizontal and vertical movements were automatically recorded and transmitted by an interface and online displayed using Activity software (Ugo Basile). Locomotor activity was monitored continuously in 1\u00a0minute intervals and then pooled for a period of 60\u00a0min. In addition the number of faecal balls was noted for the observation period as a measure of anxiety.\n\n2.7. Gait analysis (CatWalk)\nGait analysis was conducted using the CatWalk system (CatWalk 7.1, Noldus IT, Wageningen, Netherlands) in a dimly lit room. The apparatus consists of an enclosed walkway (50\u00a0cm in length) consisting of LED-illuminated glass and an under-floor camera for recording footfalls and footprint patterns. Recordings were digitised and autoanalysed using CatWalk 7.1 software (Noldus IT). The mice were placed at one end of the walkway and left to cross to the other end freely. They were removed only after they had made not less than three compliant runs,\ni.e.\n, subjects crossed the walkway in less than 5\u00a0s. Two infrared beams were used to detect the arrival of the mouse at each end and controlled (start/stop) data acquisition. Endpoints included relative paw position (hind overlapping/non-overlapping with front paws), timing (stand, swing and step cycle), base of support, pressure and dimensions of each footfall, which enabled calculation of stride length, paw distance, and regularity index (preferred paw placement sequence during walking) and were averaged for all compliant runs. The apparatus was cleaned with 70% ethanol between animals.\n\n2.8. Statistical analysis\nData were analysed in GraphPad Prism 5 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). All values are expressed as the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM. Normal distribution of the data was tested and the homogeneity of variance confirmed with the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. For data sets, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyse differences among means with time, treatment or genotype as the independent factor, when the data was normally distributed. When ANOVA showed significant differences\npost hoc\ntesting was used to make comparisons between means: Dunnett's\npost hoc\ntest was used for time-course studies and Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls\npost hoc\ntest was used to make pair-wise comparisons in all other studies. The null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 level. Outliers were eliminated based on descriptive statistics performed by SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics Version 21 for Windows, Hampshire, UK). To assess sampling strategy and homogeneity of the group coefficient of variance (CV) and coefficient of error (CE) (\nGundersen and Jensen, 1987\n) were assessed."

    "Methods": "Experimental groups\nExperiments were performed with adult male and female SOD1\nG93A\nmutant (MT) rats and age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates. Rats were assigned to the following groups: 1) young (60\u201390 days; MT: age 83\u00b14 days old, weight 424\u00b121 g; WT: age 82\u00b13 days old, weight 407\u00b126 g), 2) pre-symptomatic (90\u2013130 days; MT: age 116\u00b12 days old, weight 478\u00b114 g; WT: age 125\u00b12 days old, weight 511\u00b115 g), and 3) end-stage (150\u2013200 days; MT: age 162\u00b13 days old, weight 393\u00b112 g; WT: age 167\u00b13 days old, weight 568\u00b110 g). MT rats were considered end-stage when they reached 20% decrease from peak body mass, similar to our previous report (\nNichols et al., 2013a\n). The Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Wisconsin-Madison approved all experimental procedures.\nEach rat group received one of two treatments: 1) acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH; Pa\nO\n2\n: 35\u201345 mmHg) or 2) sham normoxia (\nie\n. time controls without AIH). AIH groups included: 1) young (n=8 MT; n=8 WT); 2) pre-symptomatic (n=9 MT; n=9 WT); and 3) end-stage (n=7 MT; n=10 WT). Time control (TC) groups included: 1) young (n=2 MT; n=2 WT); 2 pre-symptomatic (n=2 MT; n=4 WT); and 3) end-stage (n=2 MT; n=2 WT); since there were no apparent differences among TC groups, these rats were combined as a single group for statistical analyses (\ni.e\n. MT=6 and WT=8). Limited data from the end-stage rats were published previously, specifically integrated phrenic burst amplitude at 60 min post-AIH (\nNichols et al., 2013a\n). Additional data from these rats are reported here, including different time-points post-AIH, and other responses including phrenic burst frequency and the short-term hypoxic phrenic response. Separate rat groups received intrathecal drug delivery and are described in detail below in the neurophysiology protocol section.\nSeparate rat groups (without AIH) were used for analysis of phrenic motor neuron SOD1 expression (immunofluorescence) and superoxide accumulation (\nvia\ndihydroethydium fluorescence). Young, pre-symptomatic and end-stage MT rats and WT littermates were compared for SOD1 (n=6 MT; n=4 WT per age group) and superoxide accumulation (n=5 MT; n=5 WT). Ventral spinal tissue homogenates from additional MT rats and WT littermates (without AIH) were assessed for SOD1 expression\nvia\nimmunoblots at the same time-points (young: n=5 MT and n=9 WT; pre-symptomatic: n=4 MT and n=4 WT; and end-stage: n=10 MT and n=8 WT).\n\nNeurophysiological preparation\nExperimental procedures have described previously in multiple publications (eg.\nHoffman et al., 2012\n;\nNichols et al., 2012\n). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane, tracheotomized, paralyzed and ventilated (Rodent Ventilator, model 683; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA; tidal volume ~2.5 mL, frequency ~70\u201380). Isoflurane anesthesia was maintained (3.5% in 50% O\n2\n, balance N\n2\n) throughout surgical procedures; rats were then converted to urethane anesthesia over 15\u201320 minutes (1.8 g kg\n\u22121\n,\ni.v.\n) while slowly withdrawing isoflurane. Adequacy of anesthesia was tested before protocols commenced, and immediately after completion, and was assessed by the lack of pressor responses or obvious respiratory neural responses to a hemostat toe pinch. After conversion to urethane anesthesia, rats were given a continuous intravenous infusion to maintain body fluid and acid-base balance; infusions (1.5\u20136 ml kg\n\u22121\nhr\n\u22121\n) consisted of a 1:2:0.13 mixture of 6% Hetastarch (in 0.9% sodium chloride), lactated Ringer\u2019s solution, and 8.4% sodium bicarbonate.\nBody temperature was assessed with a rectal thermometer (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and maintained (37.5 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) with a heated surgical table. To monitor end-tidal P\nCO\n2\n(P\nETCO\n2\n), a flow-through carbon dioxide analyzer was used with sufficient response time to measure P\nETCO\n2\nin rats (Capnogard, Novametrix, Wallingford, CT). P\nETCO\n2\nwas maintained at ~45 mmHg throughout the surgical preparation.\nRats were vagotomized bilaterally and a polyethylene catheter (PE50 ID: 0.58mm, OD: 0.965mm; Intramedic, MD, USA) was inserted into the right femoral artery to monitor blood pressure (Gould Pressure Transducer, P23ID, USA). Blood samples were analyzed for partial pressures of O\n2\n(P\nO\n2\n) and CO\n2\n(P\nCO\n2\n) and pH using a blood gas analyzer (ABL 800, Radiometer, Westlake, OH); blood gases were assessed during baseline, the first hypoxic episode, and at 15, 30 and at 60 min post-AIH.\nThe left phrenic and hypoglossal nerves were isolated (dorsal approach), cut distally, desheathed and covered with a saline soaked cotton ball until placing the nerves on bipolar silver electrodes (see below). Laminectomy was performed at cervical level 2 (C\n2\n) for all rats that received intrathecal delivery of drugs. Once rats were converted to urethane anesthesia, a minimum of 1 hour was allowed before protocols commenced.\n\nNeurophysiology protocol\nThe left phrenic and hypoglossal nerves were submerged in mineral oil and placed on bipolar silver electrodes to record nerve activity. Neural signals were amplified (10,000 X), band-pass filtered (300\u201310,000 Hz, Model 1800, A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA, USA), full-wave rectified and integrated (Paynter filter, time constant, 50 ms, MA-821, CWE Inc., Ardmore, PA, USA). Integrated nerve bursts were digitized (8 kHz) and analyzed using WINDAQ data acquisition system (DATAQ Instruments, Akron, OH, USA). For animals that received intrathecal drug delivery, a small incision was made in the dura and a soft silicone catheter (2 Fr; Access Technologies, Skokie, IL) was inserted caudally 3\u20134 mm until the tip rested approximately over the C\n4\nsegment to deliver pre-treatment of drugs near the phrenic motor nucleus before acute intermittent hypoxia (3, 5 minute episodes of isocapnic hypoxia (35\u201345 mmHg) separated by 5 minute intervals of baseline oxygen levels (partial pressure of arterial O\n2\n(PaO\n2\n) \u2265 150 mmHg)). After the third hypoxic episode, baseline O\n2\nlevels were restored and then maintained for the duration of experiments. The intrathecal catheter was attached to a 50 \u00b5l Hamilton syringe filled with drug or vehicle solutions as described below. Rats were then paralyzed using pancuronium bromide for neuromuscular blockade (2.5 mg kg\n\u22121\n,\ni.v.\n).\nIn a separate group of rats, experiments were performed to determine if NADPH oxidase is required for pLTF in pre-symptomatic (107\u2013130 days) and end-stage (150\u2013200 days) MT rats, and age-matched WT littermates. Vehicle (control or 10% DMSO dissolved in artificial cerebral spinal fluid, aCSF) or apocynin (12 \u00b5l 600\u00b5M; Sigma) were delivered intrathecally as described previously (\nMacFarlane et al., 2009\n). Injections were made after a 15 minute baseline was established, ~20 minutes prior to the start of the AIH protocol. \u201cPre-symptomatic\u201d (PS) and \u201cend-stage\u201d (ES) WT rat treatment groups included: vehicle + AIH (PS n=11; ES n=9), vehicle time control (no AIH; PS n=5; ES n=4), apocynin + AIH (PS n=10; ES n=9), apocynin TC (PS n=4; ES n=4). Pre-symptomatic and end-stage MT rat treatment groups included: vehicle + AIH (PS n=8; ES n=8), vehicle time control (no AIH; PS n=4; ES n=4), apocynin + AIH (PS n=9; ES n=8), apocynin TC (PS n=4; ES n=4). Since there were no apparent differences among TC groups, all TC treated rats were grouped within WT and MT rats for statistical analyses (\ni.e\n. PS: MT=8 and WT=9 and ES: MT=8 and WT=8). Since pLTF, but not XII LTF, changed over disease progression, only pLTF was recorded following apocynin (or vehicle) delivery.\nTo begin protocols, the apneic CO\n2\nthreshold was determined by lowering P\nETCO\n2\nuntil nerve activity ceased for approximately one minute. The recruitment threshold was then determined by slowly increasing P\nETCO\n2\nuntil nerve activity resumed (\nBach and Mitchell, 1996\n). P\nETCO\n2\nwas raised ~2 mmHg above the recruitment threshold and ~15\u201320 min were allowed to establish a stable baseline. Arterial blood samples were drawn during baseline, and throughout protocols; arterial CO\n2\n(Pa\nCO\n2\n) was maintained within \u00b1 1.5 mmHg of baseline levels by adjusting inspired CO\n2\nand/or ventilator rate.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nYoung, pre-symptomatic and end-stage MT and age-matched WT littermates were processed to assess phrenic motor neuron survival, SOD1 expression and/or or superoxide accumulation. Rats were either euthanized with Beuthanasia (\ni.p\n. 0.1 \u00b5l/g; Intervet Schering-Plough Animal Health, Summit, NJ), or taken immediately after neurophysiological protocols (for phrenic motor neuron counts) and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (0.1 M PBS). After fixation, brainstems and spinal cords were excised, post-fixed overnight, and cryoprotected in sucrose at 4 \u00b0C until sinking. Transverse sections containing phrenic motor neurons (C\n4\n\u2013C\n5\n; 40 \u00b5m) were cut using a freezing microtome (Leica SM 2000R, Germany).\nAt each age, rats were injected with 2 \u00b5M dihydroethidium (\ni.p\n. 20 mg/kg; DHE; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) to assess superoxide accumulation 60 min before rats were perfused. This technique has been characterized and validated previously (\nCarter et al., 1994\n;\nZhao et al., 2005\n;\nSerrander et al., 2007\n;\nNijmeh et al., 2010\n). To assess DHE fluorescence, tissues were placed on glass slides, cover-slipped using anti-fade solution (Prolong Gold antifade reagent, Invitrogen, Oregon) and examined by a blinded investigator using an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon, Japan). DHE is a redox-sensitive probe, in which the reaction between superoxide and hydroethidine forms a two-electron oxidized product, ethidium (E+) (\nCarter et al., 1994\n;\nZhao et al., 2005\n). E+ binds to DNA, enhancing its fluorescence (excitation = 500\u2013530 nm and emission = 590\u2013620 nm) (\nCarter et al., 1994\n;\nZhao et al., 2005\n).\nSOD1 was detected by washing tissues with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS (TBS-T), incubated with 5% normal goat serum for 1 hr, and then incubated with rabbit anti-SOD1 (1:500; Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Anti-SOD1 has been used previously (\nRaoul et al., 2005\n;\nBasso et al., 2006\n;\nBao-Cutrona and Moral, 2009\n) and was validated and characterized in conjunction with the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) Project (HPA001401;\nhttp://www.proteinatlas.org\n). The next day, sections were washed and incubated in biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:1000; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Conjugation with avidin-biotin complex (Vecstatin Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was followed by visualization with 3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine-hydrogen peroxidase (Vector Laboratories) according to manufacturer instructions. Nissl counterstained sections were stained in 0.1% cresyl-violet for 15 min, rinsed in distilled water, dehydrated through graded alcohol (70% to 100%), cleared in xylene and cover-slipped using Eukitt (Electron Microscope Science, PA). Nissl counterstaining enabled visualization of putative phrenic motor neurons and co-localization with SOD1 label.\n\nQuantification and analysis of photomicrographs\nSections were numbered sequentially, and every 6\nth\nsection was selected for immunohistochemistry, which enabled systematic sampling. Five sections at the C\n4\n\u2013C\n5\nsegmental level from each rat in each group were used for immunohistochemical analyses conducted by a blinded investigator. Location of putative phrenic motor neurons in the ventral horn was validated based on diagrams from\nThe Spinal Cord\n(\nWatson et al. 2009\n) and extensive experience in our laboratory retrograde labeling phrenic motor neurons with cholera-toxin B fragment in normal rats (\nDale-Nagle et al., 2011\n;\nDale et al., 2012\n;\nNichols et al., 2015\n). Putative phrenic motor neurons were counted as described previously (\nNichols et al., 2013a\n;\nNichols et al., 2014\n), where the area containing phrenic motor neurons was validated and identified as a discrete cluster of large neurons in the mediolateral C\n4\nventral horn (\nBoulenguez et al., 2007\n;\nMantilla, et al., 2009\n;\nWatson et al., 2009\n). Digital photomicrographs of immunoreactive labeling in the putative phrenic motor nucleus were taken with the 20\u00d7 objective lens (Qcapture Pro 6.0, Surrey, BC, Canada), including appropriate controls (\ne.g\n. sections incubated without primary or secondary antibodies for SOD1 immunostaining or group of animal without DHE injection served as negative controls and each yielded no specific staining). Putative phrenic motor neuron counts were averaged across sections in each rat; statistical inferences were made across experimental groups. Densitometry for SOD1 and DHE staining was performed using NIH ImageJ software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD;\nhttp://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij\n). Images were converted to 8-bit resolution, and the threshold was set between 120\u2013160 during all analyses. A threshold was chosen for all groups for both SOD1 and DHE in which all motor neurons were visible, but not saturated; both wild-type and mutant images were treated identically within each group, and limit to threshold was selected in ImageJ. Optical density (OD) was measured within circumscribed putative phrenic motor neuron somata for SOD1 and DHE immunostaining, and expressed as an average OD per unit area per cell. OD was measured in all putative phrenic motor neurons per slice per animal, and then combined for analyses across groups. OD was averaged across motor neurons within each section, across sections within each rat, and then across rats within each group (to detect potential animal effects); no significant differences among rats within a group were detected, even at end stage (data not shown). OD of SOD1 and DHE immunofluoresence was expressed as a fraction of the average OD in putative phrenic motor neurons of young wild-type rats. Thus, mean OD in the control group is 1.0, with a variance reflecting rat variation in that group. The mean, normalized data presented in this paper reflect variance among rats within that experimental group (standard error).\n\nImmunoblots\nFresh C\n4\n\u2013C\n5\nspinal segments from MT and age-matched WT littermates at different stages (young, pre-symptomatic and end-stage) were harvested and frozen immediately at \u221280\u00b0C. Frozen segments were placed dorsal-side up on a freezing microtome, and 50\u2013100\u00b5m sections were removed until the central canal was visible. Ventral, cervical spinal segments were thawed, weighed and homogenized using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in 500\u00b5L of radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA). Cell extracts were spun at 7,000 g for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed and aliquoted for immunoblot analysis. Aliquots were immediately analyzed or stored at \u221280\u00b0C for later analysis.\nTotal protein concentrations for each sample were measured using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce Biotechnologies, Inc., Rockford, IL). An equal volume of sample buffer (125 mM Tris pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.006% bromophenol blue, 1.8% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) was added to each sample and the sample was boiled for 3 min. 25 \u00b5g of protein was electrophoresed at 120 volts (18% SDS-PAGE mini-gels, Biorad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Immobilon P Transfer Membrane, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) at 50 mA for 2 hours. Membranes were washed (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) several times, incubated in blocking buffer (6% non-fat dry milk, 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), and then in blocking buffer containing anti-SOD1 antibody (1:1,000; Enzo Life Sciences, Inc., Farmingdale, NY) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The following day, membranes were washed several times, incubated with blocking buffer containing horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), and then washed several more times. SOD1 was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate, Pierce Biotechnologies, Inc., Rockford, IL), and then quantified using densitometry (LabWorks software version 4.5, UVP BioImaging Systems, Upland, CA). GAPDH was used as a loading control for all samples. A pooled WT homogenate was loaded on each blot; data quantified across blots were normalized to this pooled WT homogenate to control for membrane variations. Subsequently, all groups were normalized to rat SOD1 (rSOD1) expression in young WT rats to give a fractional increase in SOD1 protein expression.\n\nData analyses\nIntegrated phrenic nerve burst amplitude was averaged over 1 min bins at each time (baseline, 15, 30 and 60 min), and normalized as a percent change from baseline. Respiratory frequency was expressed as a change from baseline (bursts per min). All statistical comparisons between treatment groups for nerve burst amplitude, frequency and blood-gas values were made with a 2-way ANOVA (MT vs WT; treatment as factors) with a repeated measures design (time post-AIH: 15, 30 and 60 min). Values during successive hypoxic episodes were compared within groups using a one-way ANOVA; since no differences were detected, the three hypoxic episodes in each experiment were combined per rat and then group; hypoxic responses were compared among groups\nvia\n2-way ANOVA. For histology and immunoblot analyses, data were compared between treatment groups using a one-way ANOVA. With statistically significant ANOVAs, individual comparisons were made using Fisher\u2019s least significant difference\npost hoc\ntest (SigmaPlot version 12.0; Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA). Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. Values are expressed as means \u00b1 1 S.E.M."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThe use of animals in these experiments was in accordance with the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health and The Ohio State University. This study was approved by the Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Newly hatched leghorn chickens (\nGallus gallus domesticus\n) were obtained from the Department of Animal Sciences at the Ohio State University or Meyer Hatchery (Polk, Ohio). Chicks were kept on a cycle of 12 hours light, 12 hours dark (lights on at 7:00 am). Chicks were housed in a stainless steel brooder at about 25\u00b0C and received water and Purina\ntm\nchick starter\nad libitum\n.\n\nPreparation of clodronate-liposomes\nThe preparation of clodronate liposomes was based on previous descriptions (\nVan Rooijen 1989\n;\nvan Rooijen 1992\n;\nVan Rooijen and Sanders 1994\n). The protocols used to generate clodronate liposome were as described previously (\nZelinka et al. 2012\n). Approximately 1% of the clodronate is encapsulated by the lipsomes (\nVan Rooijen and Sanders 1994\n), yielding approximately 7.85 mg/ml. Precise quantitation of the clodronate was difficult, because of the stochastic nature of combination of the clodronate and liposomes. Accordingly, we titrated doses of clodronate liposomes to levels where >99% of the microglia/macrophages were ablated at 1 day after treatment.\n\nIntraocular injections\nChickens were anesthetized via inhalation of 2.5% isoflurane in oxygen and intraocular injections performed as described previously (\nFischer et al., 1998\n;\nFischer et al., 1999\n). For all experiments, the left eyes of chicks were injected with the \u201ctest\u201d compound and the contra-lateral right eyes were injected with vehicle as a control. Interleukin-6 (100 or 200ng/dose), NMDA (2\u03bcmol), colchicine (200 ng/dose), FGF2 (100ng/dose), and clodronate liposomes (10 to 2000 ng) were injected in 20 \u03bcl sterile saline with 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin added as a carrier. Dex (100ng/dose or 200ng/dose) and CpdA (500ng/dose) were injected in 20 \u03bcl saline and 25% DMSO. RU486 (1\u03bcg/dose) was injected in 20 \u03bcl PBS (0.01M) and 50%DMSO. Two \u03bcg of BrdU was injected to label proliferating cells. Injection paradigms are included in each figure.\n\nSubretinal injections\nP14 chicks were anesthetized via inhalation of 2.5% isoflurane in oxygen and subretinal injections performed as described previously (\nCebulla et al. 2012\n). For all experiments, the left eyes of chicks were injected with vehicle as a control or the \u201ctest\u201d compound. Subretinal injections of approximately 25 microliters of sterile saline (n = 4) or saline with 100 ng water-soluble Dex (n = 4) were delivered to the eye to bleb-up the retina. Eyes were enucleated for analysis at day 3. Injection paradigms are included in each figure.\n\nTissue dissection, fixation, sectioning and immunolabeling\nTissues were fixed, sectioned and immunolabeled as described elsewhere (\nFischer et al. 1999\n;\nFischer et al. 1998\n). Retinal whole-mount preparations were processed as described previously (\nFischer and Reh 2002\n;\nFischer et al. 2008\n;\nFischer et al. 2006\n). Working dilutions and sources of antibodies used in this study included; (1) mouse anti-CD45 was used at 1:200 (HIS-C7; Cedi Diagnostic), (2) rabbit anti-GCR was used at 1:400 (PA1-511A; Thermo Scientific), (3) goat anti-Sox2 was used at 1:1000 (Y-17; Santa Cruz Immunochemicals), (4) mouse anti-Nkx2.2 was used at 1:80 (74.5A5; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB)), (5) mouse anti-Brn3a (Pouf4a) was used at 1:50 (mab1585; Chemicon), (6) rabbit anti-Sox9 was used at 1:2000 (AB5535; Chemicon), (7) mouse (IgG) anti-transitin was used at 1:50 (EAP3; DSHB), (8) rabbit anti-GFAP was used at 1:2000 (Z0334; DakoCytomation), (9) rabbit anti- L/M opsin was used at 1:400 (AB5405; Chemicon), (10) mouse (IgG) anti rhodopsin was used at 1:200 (Rho 4D2; generous gift Dr. R. Molday, University British Columbia), and (11) rat anti-BrdU was used at 1:200 (OBT00030S; AbD Serotec Raleigh, NC). None of the observed labeling was due to non-specific binding of secondary antibody or auto-fluorescence because sections labeled with secondary antibodies alone were devoid of fluorescence. Secondary antibodies included donkey-anti-goat-Alexa488/568, goat-anti-rabbit-Alexa488/568/647, goat-anti-mouse-Alexa488/568/647, and goat-anti-rat-Alexa488 (Invitrogen) diluted to 1:1000 in PBS plus 0.2% Triton X-100. Some sections were counter-stained with the nuclear label DRAQ5 (Cell Signaling) diluted to 1:2000 and added to the secondary antibody diluent. To permeabilize retinas for whole-mount labeling procedures, samples were frozen (\u221280\u00b0C) and thawed (20\u00b0C) three times prior to incubation with the antibody solution. Both primary and secondary antibodies were incubated overnight.\n\nTerminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)\nTo identify dying cells that contained fragmented DNA the TUNEL method was used. We used an\nIn Situ\nCell Death Kit (TMR red; Roche Applied Science), as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nqRT-PCR\nTissue dissections, RNA isolation, and reverse transcriptase reactions were performed as described previously ((\nFischer et al. 2004\n;\nGhai et al. 2010\n). PCR primers were designed by using the Primer-BLAST primer design tool at NCBI (\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/\n). Primer sequences and predicted product sizes are listed in\nTable 1\n. For qPCR, reactions were performed using SYBR Green Master Mix and StepOnePlus Real-Time system (Applied BioSystems). Samples re normalized to GAPDH for each sample and the fold change between control and treated samples was determined using the \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method [=fold change 2\n(\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct)\n] and represented as a percentage change from the control, which was assigned a value of 100. The significance of any differences in percentage change was determined using a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test.\nTable 1.\nPCR Primer sequences and predicted product sizes\nGene\nForward primer 5\u2032\u07dd3\u2032\nReverse primer 5\u2032\u07dd3\u2032\nProduct size (bp)\nadam17\nAGC GAG TGC CCT CCTCCT GG\nTTG CAG GCA CAC GAG CGG AG\n125\nascl1a\nAGG GAA CCA CGT TTA TGC AG\nTTA TAC AGG GCC TGG TGA GC\n187\ncDelta1\nCAC TGA CAA CCC TGA TGG TG\nTGG CAC TGG CAT ATG TAG GA\n152\ncDll4\nGGT CTG CAG CGA GAA CTA CT\nTGC AGT ATC CAT TCT GTT CG\n181\ncHes1\nCGC TGA AGA AGG ATA GTT CG\nGTC ACT TCG TTC ATG CAC TC\n175\ncHes5\nGGA GAA GGA GTT CCA GAG AC\nAAT TGC AGA GCT TCT TTG AG\n143\ncJag1\nTGA TAA GTG CAT TCC ACA CC\nCAG GTA CCA CCA TTC AAA CA\n149\ncNotch1\nGGC TGG TTA TCA TGG AGT TA\nCAT CCA CAT TGA TCT CAC AG\n154\ngapdh\nCAT CCA AGG AGT GAG CCA AG\nTGG AGG AAG AAA TTG GAG GA\n161\ngli1\nCTA GCG TTG ACC TGC AGA CG\nACA GGG TTT CGT GGG AGC TA\n127\ngli3\nATT TTT GGG GCA ATG GAC AG\nTGA ATG CCA TCT CCA ACC AG\n209\nil1\u03b2\nGCA TCA AGG GCT ACA AGC TC\nCAG GCG GTA GAA GAT GAA GC\n131\nil6\nTTA GTT CGG GCA CAA TCC TC\nGGT TCC TGA AAC GGA ACA AC\n72\npax2\nGCC AGG CCT CAT TGT AGG TT\nCCA ACT GGA CAA GGC AGC TA\n115\nptch\nAAC GCA TGG GCT AGA AGG AA\nATG CTT GCC TAC GCC TGT TT\n221\nsmo\nGGG TGG TTG CTC TTG ATG GA\nGAC TCC GTC AGC GGT ATC TG\n152\ntnf\u03b1\nAGC AGC GTT TGG GAG TGG GC\nGCA GAT GGG GCA GGA AAG CCA\n133\nOpen in a new tab\n\nPhotography, measurements, and cell counts\nWide-field photomicrographs were obtained by using a Leica DM5000B microscope and Leica DC500 digital camera. Images were optimized for brightness and contrast, multiple-channel images overlaid, and figures constructed by using Adobe Photoshop\u21226.0. Cell counts were made from at least 4 different animals, and means and standard deviations calculated on data sets. To avoid the possibility of region-specific differences within the retina, cell counts were consistently made from the same region of retina for each data set.\nSimilar to previous reports (\nFischer et al. 2009a\n;\nFischer et al. 2009b\n;\nFischer et al. 2010a\n;\nGhai et al. 2009\n), immunofluorescence was quantified by using ImagePro 6.2 (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA). Identical illumination, microscope, and camera settings were used to obtain images for quantification. Retinal areas were sampled from 5.4 MP digital images. These areas were randomly sampled across all layers of the retina where microglia where found. Measurements were made for thresholded regions (\u226550 contiguous pixels) containing pixels with intensity values of 68 or greater (0 = black and 255 = saturated). The mean density sum was calculated as the average sum of pixel values for all pixels above threshold within fields of view. These calculations were determined for retinal regions sampled from at least 4 different retinas for each experimental condition.\nPercentage area of retinal folds and detachments was determined from digital micrographs. The detached areas appeared as opacities that were digitally traced and measured by using ImagePro 6.2. The detached retinal area was calculated as a percentage of total retinal area without compensating for concave shape of the eyecup.\nTo assess ganglion cell survival, numbers of Brn3a+ nuclei in the GCL (52,000 \u03bcm\n2\n) per region of the retina (central, temporal, nasal and ventral) were counted per eye. To assess numbers of dying cells in NMDA-damaged retinas, cell counts of TUNEL-positive cells in the INL were made in central regions (14,600 \u03bcm\n2\n) of retina.\n\nStatistics\nWhere significance of difference was determined between two treatment groups accounting for inter-individual variability (means of treated-control values) we performed a two-tailed, paired\nt\n-test. The significance of differences for the percent change was determined using a two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test. The normality distribution of the data was determined by using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The statistics were calculated using the GraphPad Prism 6 software."

    "Methods": "Mouse Brain Tissue Preparation\nAll experiments were conducted at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in\naccordance with the NIH guidelines and approved by the local Institution Animal\nCare and Use Committee. For this report, a total of 20 adult mice (strain\nC57BL/6; 20.5 \u2013 37 g) were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50\nmg/kg intraperitoneal) and decapitated. During each dissection, the mouse brain\nwas removed from the skull and cooled in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid\n(ACSF; see below). Coronal mouse brain slices of 400 \u00b5m thickness were\nprepared following a procedure previously described (\nXiao and Hrabetova, 2009\n) using a vibrating blade microtome\n(VT 1200S; Leica Microsystem GmbH, Nussloch, Germany). All slices were submerged\nin a room temperature ACSF recovery chamber for at least 1 hr prior to\nexperimentation.\n\nComposition of Regular Artificial Cerebrospinal Fluid (ACSF) and Treatment of\nBrain Slices\nThe regular ACSF used prior to and between all test treatments (see\nbelow) was prepared as previously described (\nHrabetova et al., 2009\n;\nXiao and\nHrabetova, 2009\n). The composition of regular ACSF was (in mM): NaCl\n124, KCl 5, NaHCO\n3\n26, NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n1.25, D-glucose\n10, MgCl\n2\n1.3, CaCl\n2\n1.5. The ACSF was gassed with\n95% O\n2\n- 5% CO\n2\nto buffer pH at 7.4.\nThe composition of hyponatremic treatments was based on the description\nprovided by\nChebabo et al. (1995)\n.\nHyponatremic hypo-osmotic treatments were made by omitting 40, 60, or 90 mM NaCl\nfrom the regular ACSF described above. Hyponatremic iso-osmotic treatments,\nreferred to as low-NaCl treatments, were be made by substituting fructose for\nomitted NaCl. Specific hyponatremic hypo-osmotic solutions are referred to in\nthis paper as H-40, H-60, and H-90 while the corresponding low-NaCl treatments\nare referred to as F-40, F-60, and F-90 following the convention originally used\nby\nChebabo et al. (1995)\n.\nThe osmolality of all regular ACSF and treatments was confirmed by a\nfreezing point-depression osmometer (Osmette A, model no. 5002; Precision\nSystems Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Regular ACSF and low-NaCl treatments had an\nosmolality of about 300 mosmol/kg. Hypo-osmotic treatments with 40, 60, and 90\nmM NaCl omitted had osmolalities of about 220, 190, and 135 mosmol/kg\nrespectively.\nAll treatments were administered as previously described (\nChebabo et al., 1995\n). For both low-NaCl and\nhyponatremic hypo-osmotic treatments, brain slices were exposed to 3 test\nsolutions (40, 60, and 90 mM NaCl omitted) lasting 30 min each in order of\ndecreasing [NaCl]. Between and after each treatment, slices were allowed to\nrecover in regular ACSF for 30 min (referred to as the recovery period). Each\nlow-NaCl condition was repeated in at least 4 brain slices from 3 mice.\nIn 5 of the trials reported (3 control slices and 2 brain slices that\nunderwent cleavage of CS using chondroitinase ABC (chABC) enzyme; all 5\ninvolving fructose substitution), treatment was stopped after recovery from F-60\n(F-90 was not applied). Likewise, in 5 of the trials reported (3 control slice\nand 2 brain slices that underwent cleavage of CS using chABC enzyme; all 5\ninvolving fructose substitution), only F-90 was applied. Data from these trials\nwas consistent with data from comparable brain slices that experienced all three\ntreatments successively.\nIn a separate control experiment, 7 brain slices from 4 mice were\nexposed to the F-60 test solution repeatedly. Between and after each treatment,\nslices were allowed to recover in regular ACSF for 30 min as above. During these\ntrials, [Ca\n2+\n]\ne\nwas continuously monitored before and\nduring the application of each test solution.\n\nIncubation of Brain Slices with Chondroitinase ABC and Confirmation of\nCleavage by Immunochemistry\nCleavage of CS on ECM with chABC was performed as described previously\n(\nBukalo et al., 2001\n;\nHrabetova et al., 2009\n). To summarize, after\nbrain tissue preparation, including 1 hr recovery in regular ACSF, several\nslices were transferred into a chamber with room temperature ACSF containing\nchABC (0.2 U/mL, Cat # C3667, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). These\nslices were then incubated at room temperature for 3 hr. Prior to\n[Ca\n2+\n]\ne\nrecording, treated slices were returned to a\nnormal ACSF bath at room temperature. A control group underwent the same\npreparation without the addition of chABC.\nConfirmation of CS cleavage from chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG)\nwas conducted using immunochemistry as previously described (\nHrabetova et al., 2009\n;\nBr\u00fcckner et al., 1998\n). Enzymatic\ntreatment and immunostaining were performed in brain slices in-situ without cell\npermeabilization. This approach achieved an extracellular space-selective\ndetection of CS cleavage. Antibodies used recognize CSPG \u201cstubs\u201d\nthat appear after cleavage of full length CS on CSPG by chABC enzyme (\nCaterson et al., 1985\n). Briefly, slices\ntreated with chABC (described above) and comparative control slices were fixed\nin 4% paraformaldehyde in 1 M PBS at 4 \u00b0C post experimentation.\nHippocampus was then cut out and wet tissue was sliced into 50 \u00b5m\nsections using a vibrating blade microtome (VT 1200S; Leica Microsystem GmbH,\nNussloch, Germany). Sections were then blocked in 2% bovine serum\nalbumin (BSA) in 1 M PBS for 1 hr at room temperature. A primary antibody\ntargeting CSPG \u201cstubs\u201d (C-4-S, Cat # 1042009, MD\nBioproducts, St Paul, MN, USA) was diluted with 2% BSA in 1 M PBS\n(1:200) and allowed to incubate overnight at room temperature. Sections were\nthen washed 3 times for 10 min, using 0.1% BSA in 1 M PBS at room\ntemperature for each rinse. Following washing, slices were incubated for 1 hr in\na goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (Cat\n# A-11001, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) diluted with 1%\nBSA in 1 M PBS (1:400). Sections were then washed 3 times for 10 min, each rinse\nwith 0.1% BSA in 1 M PBS at room temperature, and mounted in Vectashield\n(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for imaging under an epifluorescence\nmicroscope.\nIn 1 trial, an additional goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (GAM IgG)\nantibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) was applied to optimize\nspecific binding. In this trial, sections were washed 3 times in 1 M PBS (10 min\nper rinse) immediately following sectioning. Sections were then incubated in GAM\nIgG (diluted with 2% BSA in 1 M PBS to 0.035 g/L IgG) overnight at 4\n\u00b0C. All other steps prior to and following sectioning, including\nblocking, washing, primary antibody, secondary antibody, and mounting were as\ndescribed above. Both GAM and non-GAM procedures resulted in similar contrast\nbetween cleaved and control slices.\nIn 2 of the 4 chABC cleavage trials, visual comparison under 40 X\nmagnification using an epifluorescent microscope of 6 control sections and 5\nsections from slices incubated in chABC enzyme was used to confirm cleavage.\nStratum radiatum of CA1 region of hippocampus was used for confirmation of\ncleavage. The intensity of fluorescent staining (including those presented\nbelow) was standardized using ImageJ (\nRasband,\n1997\u20132012\n) to allow for direct visual comparison of control\nand treated sections.\n\nT-type Ca\n2+\nChannel Blocker\nT-type calcium channels were blocked using the selective inhibitor ML\n218 hydrochloride (Cat# 4507; Bio-Techne, Minneapolis, MN, USA). For\nthese experiments, all brain slices were exposed to ACSF containing ML 218 for\n30 min, then F-60 containing ML 218 for 30 min, followed by ACSF containing ML\n218 for 30 min. Throughout these experiments, ML 218 was maintained at 3\n\u00b5M dissolved in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and either\nregular ACSF or F-60 solution. Working concentration of ML 218 was chosen based\non a previous study (\nXiang et al., 2011\n)\nthat characterized ML 218 in brain.\nPrior to ML 218 treatment, each slice was subjected to a control\ntreatment. For these treatments, slices were superfused with ACSF containing\n0.1% DMSO for 20 min, F-60 containing 0.1% DMSO for 30 min, and\nACSF containing 0.1% DMSO for 30 min. Ca\n2+\nsignal obtained\nduring the above served as paired control for subsequent ML 218 treatments.\n\nCa\n2+\nIon-Selective Microelectrodes (ISM)\nCa\n2+\n-ISMs were prepared from double-barreled theta glass\n(TG200-4; Warner Instruments Corp., Hamden, CT) as described previously (\nNicholson, 1993\n;\nHrabetova et al., 2009\n). The ion-detecting barrel of the ISM\nwas filled with 150 mM CaCl\n2\nand used Ca\n2+\nionophore I,\ncocktail A (Cat # 21048, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in the tip\nfor a semipermeable membrane. The reference barrel was filled with 150 mM NaCl\nand voltage on this barrel was continuously subtracted from that on the ion\nbarrel during testing. In a few trials, the reference barrel on the\nCa\n2+\n-ISM showed some instability during pre-testing calibration.\nIn these cases, a reference microelectrode was used in place of the reference\nbarrel on the Ca\n2+\n-ISM. Reference microelectrodes were created using\nthe same method described above save that both barrels on reference\nmicroelectrodes were filled with 150 mM NaCl and no ionophore was added to\neither barrel.\nBoth Ca\n2+\n-ISMs and reference microelectrodes were calibrated\nin a set of standard solutions (0.375, 0.75, 1.5, 3, or 6 mM Ca\n2+\nall\nin 150 mM NaCl) prior to and immediately after experimentation. Results from\nCa\n2+\n-ISM pre-test calibrations were fitted to the Nikolsky\nequation to obtain slope and interference (\nNicholson, 1993\n). Changes in the slope of Ca\n2+\n-ISM during\ntesting were small, less than 10% in all trials except 1, in which the\nslope of the ISM changed by 13%.\n\nMeasurement of [Ca\n2+\n] in Extracellular Space\nFor [Ca\n2+\n]\ne\nrecording, each brain slice was placed\nin a submersion recording chamber (Warner model RC-27L; Harvard Apparatus,\nHolliston, MA) and superfused with ACSF at flow rate of 2.0 mL/min delivered by\nperistaltic pump. The ACSF temperature was maintained at 34 \u00b1 1\n\u00b0C by a dual automatic temperature controller (Warner model TC-344B;\nHarvard Apparatus) operating an in-line heater (Warner model SH-27A; Harvard\nApparatus) in tandem with the heating element of the recording chamber. The\nrecording chamber was placed on the fixed stage of a compound microscope\n(BX51WI; Olympus America, Melville, NY) equipped with a water immersion\nobjective (Olympus UMPlanFl, 10 X, numerical aperture 0.3) and infrared\ndifferential interference contrast optics for visualization of the specimen and\nmicroelectrodes. The glass microelectrode for recording\n[Ca\n2+\n]\ne\nwas held in a robotic manipulator (MP 285;\nSutter Instrument, Novato, CA), which ensured high precision of movement and\nstability. All [Ca\n2+\n]\ne\nrecordings were performed in the\nstratum radiatum of hippocampal CA1 region.\nFree [Ca\n2+\n]\ne\nwas measured in stratum radiatum of\nhippocampal CA1 region as described previously (\nHrabetova and Nicholson, 2007\n;\nHrabetova et al., 2009\n). Briefly, during each trial a\nCa\n2+\n-ISM was inserted to a depth of 200 \u00b5m into the 400\n\u00b5m brain slice using robotic micromanipulator under visual control. The\nposition of the tip was confirmed using water-immersion objective. The\nCa\n2+\nsignal was extracted by continuous subtraction of the\npotential on the reference barrel from the potential on the ion-detecting barrel\nusing a dual-channel microelectrode preamplifier (model IX2\u2013700; Dagan\nCorp., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Both Ca\n2+\nand DC potentials were\namplified and low-pass filtered (6 Hz) using a signal conditioner (CyberAmp 320,\nAxon Instruments, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and continuously\nmonitored on a chart recorder. In a few experiments, pre-calibration showed that\nthe reference barrel of the Ca\n2+\n-ISM might not be stable. In such\ncases, a separate reference microelectrode was placed 20 \u00b5m from the\nCa\n2+\n-ISM (also in stratum radiatum of CA1 hippocampus) and the\nvoltage from this microelectrode was used in place of the reference barrel on\nthe Ca\n2+\n-ISM. All voltages recorded during experimentation were\nconverted to [Ca\n2+\n] using slope and interference values obtained from\nprior calibrations (see above).\nChebabo et al. (1995)\npreviously\nreported and corrected for shifts in Ca\n2+\n-ISM calibration curves\nduring the treatment of slices with hypo-osmotic solutions. Such corrections\nwere not necessary in these trials. When Ca\n2+\n-ISMs were switched from\na solution containing 1.5 mM Ca\n2+\nand 140 mM NaCl to hyponatremic\ncalibration solutions (1.5 mM Ca\n2+\nin 90, 60, 40 mM NaCl omitted),\nthe shift in voltage on the ion-detecting barrel (without subtraction) was\nconsistently the same as the shift observed on the reference barrel. Such shifts\nwere corrected for by subtracting voltage on the reference barrel from voltage\non the ion-detecting barrel during trials (see above).\nAlthough the slope of the Ca\n2+\n-ISM stayed relatively\nconstant, during trials a small amount of drift was observed such that voltages\nrepresenting [Ca\n2+\n]\ne\n= 1.5 mM either decreased or\nincreased slightly throughout the trial. To correct for this drift, the\nCa\n2+\n-ISM (and reference microelectrode when used) was raised 50\n\u00b5m above the level of the slice every 30 min (immediately before\nchanging solutions). After a stable recording was observed, the\nCa\n2+\n-ISM was reinserted into its original position in the CA1 region\nof hippocampus. This calibration process took roughly 10 sec and baseline\nvoltage (equivalent to [Ca\n2+\n]\ne\n= 1.5 mM) in each trial was\nassumed to be the line connecting the voltages readings when the\nCa\n2+\n-ISM was above the slice. In the few trials where such\ncalibrations were not done, baseline voltage for the entire trial was taken as\nthe line connecting voltages prior to the first treatment and after the last\ntreatment (at which point Ca\n2+\n-ISM and reference microelectrode were\nconsistently raised 50 um above the level of the slice) for the entire\ntrial.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll statistics, including the mean and standard error for each group,\nwere calculated using SigmaStat 3.5 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA, USA), with n\nequal to the number of slices exposed to each test solution (40, 60, 90 mM NaCl\nsubstituted; control or cleaved; blocked or paired control). ANOVA was used to\ncompare three or more groups and Student\u2019s t-test or Wilcoxon signed\nrank test to compare two groups. For all tests performed, p < 0.05 is\nconsidered significant."

    "Methods": "Study design\nResearch objectives\nWe performed a controlled, preclinical study of MPS I and carrier control dogs to determine whether white matter abnormalities described in human MPS I could be detected in MPS I dogs. Canine studies were essential, because patients affected with severe MPS I disease typically receive bone marrow transplantation and immune suppression which could confound observational imaging studies in human subjects. Following our initial determination of reduced fractional anisotropy in the corpus callosum of affected dogs vs. controls, we performed further data and tissue analyses to determine whether the changes reflected abnormal myelination. We also studied treated MPS I dogs to determine whether the imaging and compositional abnormalities that we discovered would respond to therapeutic intervention.\nResearch subjects\nDogs were bred from the original Plott hound colony (\nShull et al., 1982\n). Study subjects were maintained in accordance with US Department of Agriculture and NIH guidelines for the care of dogs. All study procedures were reviewed and approved by institutional animal care and use committees. Dogs were bred and maintained as described (\nVite et al., 2013\n). We used a mix of heterozygous and homozygous normal control dogs from this kindred. Heterozygous dogs are carriers only and have never been documented to have manifestations of MPS I disease at any time. The dogs in this study were previously described with respect to their brain magnetic resonance imaging findings (\nVite et al., 2013\n).\nExperimental design\nTreated dogs (both genders) received recombinant human alpha-\nl\n-iduronidase (formulated as laronidase, BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Novato, CA). For intrathecal treatment, 0.05 mg/kg body weight (up to 1 mg) recombinant human alpha-\nl\n-iduronidase was diluted in 1:2 (v/v) Elliotts B artificial spinal fluid (DRAXIS Pharma, Kirkland, Quebec, Canada) and administered into the cisterna magna at three month intervals as previously described (\nVite et al., 2013\n). Four of the nine untreated MPS I dogs (I-371, I-388, I-392 and I-393) received intra-articular treatment with 1 mg recombinant human alpha-\nl\n-iduronidase to the right stifle (knee) and elbow joints once monthly for six months in a separate study (\nWang et al., 2014\n). Intra-articular treatment would not be expected to affect MPS disease in the brain. Dogs received 2.2 mg/kg diphenhydramine prior to intrathecal recombinant human alpha-\nl\n-iduronidase administration to prevent infusion reactions.\nSample size\nWe used heterozygous normal control dogs from this kindred for this study. Heterozygous dogs are carriers only and are not expected, and have never been documented in the over 30 years that the model has existed at five different sites, to have manifestations of MPS I disease at any time. Animals of this kindred are preferred controls relative to other wildtype dogs from outside of the colony (which could have other genetic variations). Sample size was determined mainly by availability of animals. However, we estimated that there is a 25% reduction in fractional anisotropy of the corpus callosum in human MPS I patients compared to controls. Power analysis suggests that four animals per group would yield >97% power to detect a 25% change with an estimated SD of 10%.\nData inclusion and outliers\nNo animals were lost during the study, and data from all animals were included. No data were treated as outliers. Two neuroimaging studies with high levels of artifact (such as motion artifact) were identified, not analyzed, and excluded from the data set. Since with one exception at least two and in some cases three scans were performed for each animal, we were able to include imaging studies for each dog in the results. More information about excluded imaging studies can be found below under \u201cDTI.\u201d\nEndpoints and experimental replicates\nDTI endpoints were prospectively determined (FA, radial and axial diffusivity, and ADC). For all results, except where noted we used Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Each animal was an experimental replicate, except for RT-PCR where plates were experimental replicates. Dogs were scanned twice, and if both scans were acceptable then both were analyzed and the results averaged. Assays were performed in triplicate and the means reported.\nRandomization and blinding\nRandomization was not performed in this exploratory study. Blinding to MPS and treatment status was performed for all outcome measures.\n\nDTI\nDogs were imaged using a 3.0-Tesla scanner (Discovery MR 750, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) and an 8-channel transmit\u2013receive knee coil. DTI was performed with an axial single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence containing 37 slices aligned to the anterior and posterior commissures. The acquisition parameters were TR/TE 6,000/86 ms, flip angle 90\u00b0, slices thickness of 1.5 mm, no gap, 4 NEX, matrix of 128 \u00d7 128. Three volumes with diffusion weighting b-factor of 0 s/mm\n2\nand 25 volumes with b-factor of 1000 s/mm\n2\nwere acquired. We also performed anatomical imaging, as previously published (\nVite et al., 2013\n). Anesthesia was managed as previously described (\nVite et al., 2013\n).\nIn general, an attempt was made to perform MR imaging on each dog twice, at one week intervals. All dogs except two were imaged twice during that time interval. One carrier dog was scanned once and one untreated MPS dog was scanned three times. DTI imaging was acceptable in all but one of the 7 DTI scans performed in the carrier dogs, all but one of the 9 DTI scans performed in the untreated MPS dogs, and in all 18 DTI scans performed in treated dogs.\nDICOM-formatted images were first processed using the DtiStudio software suite (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) (\nJiang et al., 2006\n). All images were first inspected for the presence of artifacts. A B\n0\ncorrection was performed on the raw diffusion-weighted images using automated image registration in DtiStudio to correct for eddy currents and motion. We performed a linear transformation in DiffeoMap using a twelve-parameter affine approach with a trilinear interpolation on the axial proton density image using the FA map as the template for the purpose of anatomical localization. The fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (\u03bb1), and radial diffusivity ([\u03bb2 + \u03bb3]/2) maps were then derived.\nWe used the fiber assignment by continuous tracking (FACT) algorithm in DtiStudio 3.0.2 for tractography (\nMori et al., 1999\n). We set FA thresholds to 0.2 to initiate and continue tracking; the maximum angle threshold was 0\u00b0. We used a single region-of-interest (ROI) approach for tractography of the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum.\n\nRelationship between MBP Levels and DTI Metrics\nTo determine the relationship between myelination and DTI, we quantified MBP using a sandwich ELISA. We then performed linear regression analysis of FA, radial diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and ADC using MBP as the independent variable (\nFig. 2C\n). A subset of dogs representing all three groups was included in the analysis. This set included 4 untreated MPS dogs, 2 MPS dogs treated with intrathecal recombinant alpha-\nl\n-iduronidase (MTr) dogs, and 4 normal carrier (CTL) dogs and was limited by available tissue for quantitative MBP analysis.\nFig. 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nMyelin basic protein and relationship to DTI metrics.

(\nC\n) Scatterplots showing fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (Rad Diff), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and axial diffusivity (Ax Diff) of the genu of the corpus callosum measured by DTI vs. MBP quantified from extracted myelin in MPS (black circles), MTr (gray circles), and CTL (open circles) dogs. Linear regression was performed with MBP as the dependent variable.\n\nExpression of Myelin-Related Genes\nWe isolated total RNA from canine corpus callosum (genu and splenium) using an RNeasy Lipid Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) and performed semi-quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. We measured the total RNA quantity with NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). We synthesized cDNA from ~100\u2013500 ng of RNA using the AffinityScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with random hexamer primers, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The resulting cDNA was diluted 10-fold, and a 2-\u00b5l aliquot was used in a 10-\u00b5l PCR reaction (Power SYBR Green, Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA) containing primers at a concentration of 100 nM each. PCR reactions were run in triplicate and quantified in the ABI 7,900HT Sequence Detection System. We normalized cycle threshold (C\nT\n) values to peptidylprolyl isomerase A (\nPPIA\n) expression (\nFletcher et al., 2011\n) and expressed the results as fold-change of mRNA compared to control canine samples. Primers were optimized over exon-exon junctions to a calculated T\nm\nof 60 \u00b0C and synthesized by Eurofins MWG Operon (Huntsville, AL). The myelinrelated genes that we evaluated included\nMAL\n(myelin and lymphocyte protein),\nPLP1\n(proteolipid protein 1),\nMBP\n(myelin basic protein),\nMAG\n(myelin associated glycoprotein),\nMOG\n(myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein), and\nMOBP\n(myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic protein).

PCR was performed in triplicate and the data analyzed using 2\n\u2212\u0394\u0394C\nT\n(\nLivak and Schmittgen, 2001\n).\n\nMyelin Composition\nTo evaluate the composition of white matter myelin in MPS I dogs, we dissected the corpus callosum from MPS I and carrier control dogs and isolated the genu and splenium. We extracted the myelin from the genu and splenium using sucrose gradient centrifugation (\nNorton Wt and Poduslo, 1973\n). The main components of myelin are protein and lipids. We examined composition of white matter myelin in two ways. First, we measured the protein concentration of myelin. Next, we measured the composition of white matter myelin by measuring myelin basic protein.\nFor western blots, we loaded 1.5 \u00b5g protein of homogenate (of extracted myelin) onto 4\u201320% Tris-Glycine protein gels (Life Technology) and probed the blot with antibodies against myelin basic protein and actin (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). For quantitative measurement of myelin basic protein, we performed sandwich ELISA by coating 96-well plates with rat polyclonal anti-myelin basic protein antibody (82\u201387; EMD Millipore), adding 50 \u00b5l (1:50 dilution) extracted myelin to each well, applying mouse monoclonal anti-myelin basic protein antibody (119\u2013131; EMD Millipore), goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase-conjugated; Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL), and developing with pNPP substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Samples were read using a Biotek plate reader (Synergy-2, Biotek, Winooski, VT) at 405 nm. Bovine myelin basic protein (EMD Millipore) was used to establish a standard curve.\n\nEvaluation of Lipidomics\nFor lipid analysis, myelin underwent sequential extraction with chloroform methanol (1:2), chloroform and water (1:1), then chloroform alone (\nWelti et al., 2007\n). Finally, we washed the lower layers containing the lipid in 1 M KCl and water. Aliquots of ~9 \u00b5g lipid (estimated based on original myelin protein concentrations) taken from each sample underwent liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LCMSMS) analysis by the Kansas Lipidomics Research Center using previously published methods. One aliquot was analyzed for polar lipids on an API 4000\u2122 (ABSciex, Framingham, MA), while a second aliquot was analyzed for ceramides and hexosylceramides on a 4000 Q-Trap\n\u00ae\n(ABSciex)(\nDevaiah et al., 2006\n;\nWelti et al., 2007\n). Lipid signals were normalized to protein content (nmol/mg protein for polar lipids, and signal/mg protein for ceramides and hexosylceramides). For the ceramide and hexosylceramide analysis, species in which the fatty acid carbon chain was no longer than 26 were identified (these are the species most likely found in brain), and the spectral peaks representing ions with or without loss of water molecules were added together. We assayed cholesterol (total) using the Amplex Red assay kit (Life Technology). We measured esterified cholesterol by adding myelin extraction samples to a 96-well plate and applying reagents mix of cholesterol esterase, cholesterol oxidase, amplex red, and horseradish peroxidase provided by the kit. We incubated samples and reagents at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min in a Biotek plater reader (Synergy-2) and read them at excitation 530 nm and emission 590 nm. We created a standard curve for cholesterol using cholesterol provided in the kit. We measured protein in myelin extracts using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Results from genu and splenium were similar and were averaged for each\nanimal\n.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nFor comparisons of DTI metrics and MBP content, we used linear regression (least-squares method; SYSTAT13, Systat, Chicago, IL) to compare the dependent variables FA, ADC, radial diffusivity and axial diffusivity versus the independent variable, MBP. Each animal was an experimental replicate.\nFor the statistical analysis of myelin composition (except for lipidomics), SigmaPlot 12 and SYSTAT 13 statistical software (Systat, Chicago, IL) were used for graphing and statistical analysis, respectively. We analyzed data using ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer\npost-hoc\ntest. Each animal was an experimental replicate. Except where noted, we used Bonferroni correction to adjust the confidence interval for multiple comparisons.\nLipidomics analyses were performed in R version 2.14.0. The primary outcome measures were the quantities of polar lipid, ceramide and hexosylceramide classes, and individual lipid species, normalized to protein content (nmol or signal/mg protein). The percent of total signal (not normalized to protein) for each polar lipid class was also analyzed to examine lipid composition in parallel with lipid quantities. Data was filtered to include only lipid compounds with at least 3 non-zero values in at least one of the groups. For polar lipids, the raw data included 352 compounds, and 260 compounds remained after filtering. After assessment for normal distribution of data, we compared lipid variables among the three groups using ANOVA. We performed pair-wise t-tests using a pooled standard deviation estimate across all groups with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons to compare each pair of groups in cases in which the overall ANOVA test was significant. We performed principal components analyses separately for the set of polar lipids and the set of ceramide and hexosylceramide classes. The first principal component was plotted versus the second principal component to assess whether the information from the set of classes could separate the groups. Next, we performed hierarchical clustering on the standardized percentages for both polar lipid species and for ceramides/hexceramides. We used R package \u201cqvalue\u201d for q value estimation, \u201ccluster,\u201d \u201clattice,\u201d \u201cgclus,\u201d \u201cMASS,\u201d and \u201ccalibrate\u201d for PCA analysis, and \u201cpls\u201d to standardize matrix for heatmap production. We set statistical significance to 0.05."

    "Methods": "Development and Care of Humanized NSG mice\nThe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The Ohio State University approved all animal protocols. Young adult breeding pairs of NOD. Cg-\nPrkdc\nscid\nIl2rg\ntm1Wjl\n/SzJ mice (NSG mice) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Animals were fed commercial food pellets and chlorinated reverse osmosis water\nad libitum\n, and housed in ventilated microisolator cages layered with corn cob bedding in a 12 hour light-dark cycle at a constant temperature (20 \u00b1 2\u00b0C) and humidity (50 \u00b1 20%). In total, 5 male and 6 female newborn NSG mice were selected for hematopoietic stem cell engraftment procedures. Newborn NSG pups (24\u201348 hours postnatal) received 100cGy whole body irradiation (RS 2000, Rad Source, Suwanee, GA). Human umbilical cord CD34\n+\nstem cells (Lonza Incorporated, Walkersville, MD) were thawed according to the manufacturer recommended protocol then were suspended in Hematopoietic Growth Media (Lonza Inc.) supplemented with StemSpan CC100 (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, BC). Immediately after irradiation, each mouse was lightly anesthetized on ice and subjected to a single intrahepatic injection of 3\u20135\u00d710\n4\ncells in a total volume of 50 \u03bcl into the right lateral lobe using a sterile 26 gauge needle. After the procedure body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C using a heating pad. Once recovered, newborn NSG mice were returned to their dams for normal maturation until weaning at 21 days. At that time they were housed \u2264 5 mice per cage for the duration of the experiment. All mice survived irradiation and engraftment procedures. Engraftment of human peripheral blood leukocytes was initially assessed 10 weeks after injection (see flow cytometry methods below).\n\nSpinal Cord Contusion Injury\nThirteen weeks after engraftment, hNSG mice (n=11) were subjected to a moderate mid-thoracic (T9) spinal cord contusion injury. Non-irradiated, non-engrafted NSG mice served as controls (n=8 mice; n=4 male and n=4 female). Mice were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail (120 and 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal, respectively), hair was shaved at the region of the thoracic spinal cord, and skin treated with a sequence of betadine, 70% ethanol, and betadine. A small midline incision was made to expose the T9 vertebra then a partial laminectomy was performed followed by a 60 KDyne contusion injury using an Infinite Horizon Impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Lexington, Kentucky). Force and displacement biomechanics were measured for each injury. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C during surgery using a heat pad. After SCI, skin was closed using sterile wound clips then mice were returned to their cages which were placed overnight onto a slide warmer set to 37\u00b0C. Sterile saline (2 ml) was injected subcutaneously after SCI to maintain proper hydration. Bladders were manually expressed twice daily for the duration of the study. Gentocin antibiotic was subcutaneously administered once a day at 5 mg/kg for 5 days after injury. One female hNSG mouse died immediately prior to SCI surgery, likely due to complications from anesthesia, and one male hNSG mouse died during the post-injury period. Both mice were excluded from all analyses. hNSG and NSG mice were not injured on the same days. However, all animals were subjected to nearly identical injury force and displacement: 61.9 \u00b1 0.5 KDyne and displacement of 497 \u00b1 5 \u03bcm for hNSG mice and 62.0 \u00b1 0.6 KDyne and displacement of 475 \u00b1 19.5 \u03bcm for NSG mice.\n\nBehavioral Testing\nHindlimb motor function was assessed using the Basso Mouse Scale (\nBasso et al. 2006\n). Testing occurred 1 day prior to injury then again at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post-injury (dpi). hNSG mice were placed into an open field and allowed to freely explore the environment for 4 minutes. The same two individuals scored hindlimb locomotor parameters during each test period. Left and right hindlimb BMS scores were averaged for each mouse to obtain a single value at each time point.\n\nFlow Cytometry\nAssessment of human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) was initially performed 10 weeks after engraftment with human umbilical stem cells. Approximately 50\u03bcl whole blood was collected from the facial vein into a tube containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Red blood cells were lysed with BD Pharm Lyse\n\u2122\nLysing Buffer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey). Antibodies against human leukocyte markers were added to aliquots of blood and allowed to incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature. A FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) was used to analyze blood samples. Forward scatter and side scatter parameters were used to gate viable cell populations for further phenotypic analyses using antibody panels described in (\nTable 1\n). Offline data analyses were completed with FlowJo v.10 software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR).\nTable 1.\nAntibodies used for flow cytometry and immunohistochemical staining\nMarker\nHost Species\nClone\nVendor\nCat #\nVolume/Dilution\nConjugate\nHuman CD45 (LCA)\nMouse\n2D1\nBD Biosciences\n347464\n10\u201320 \u03bcl per test\n*\n1:50\u20131:200\nPerCP\nHuman CD16 (Fc\u03b3RIII)\nMouse\n3G8\nBD Biosciences\n555406\n10\u201320 \u03bcl per test\n*\nFITC\nHuman CD14\nMouse\nMOP9\nBD Biosciences\n562691\n10\u201320 \u03bcl per test\n*\nPE\nHuman CD3\nRat\nCD3-12\nSerotec\nMCA1477\n1:100\u20131:1000\nMouse CD45\nRat\n30-F11\nBD Biosciences\n553078\n1:200\nCD45R/B220\nRat\nRA3-6B2\nSerotec\nMCA1258G\n1:200\nCD31 (PECAM-1)\nRat\nMEC 13.3\nBD Biosciences\n553370\n1:2000\nCollagen IV\nRabbit\n-\nMillipore\nAB756\n1:1000\nGFAP\nRabbit\n-\nDako\nZ0334\n1:400\nIba-1\nRabbit\n-\nWako\n019-19741\n1:250\u20131:1500\nLaminin\nRabbit\n-\nSigma\nL9393\n1:500\nNFH\nChicken\n-\nAves\nNF-H\n1:1000\nIsotype Controls\nIgG1 PE Isotype\nMouse\nX40\nBD Biosciences\n340762\n10\u201320 \u03bcl per test\n*\nPerCP\nIgG1 FITC Isotype\nMouse\nX40\nBD Biosciences\n340755\n10\u201320 \u03bcl per test\n*\nFITC\nIgG2b PE Isotype\nMouse\nMPC-11\nBD Biosciences\n559529\n10\u201320 \u03bcl per test\n*\nPE\nOpen in a new tab\n*\nDenotes volume used per peripheral blood sample for flow cytometry. All other dilutions used for immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining.\n\nTissue Procurement and Histology\nAt 28 dpi, hNSG mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 0.1M phosphate buffer saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Tissues were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 2 hours, dialyzed in 0.2 M phosphate buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C then cryopreserved in a 30% sucrose solution for 72 hours at 4\u00b0C. Tissues were embedded in OCT medium (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA), frozen on dry ice, sectioned at 10 \u03bcm on a cryostat then stored at \u221220\u00b0C. For peroxidase and fluorescent based staining procedures slides were thawed at room temperature for 1 hour, placed on a slide warmer for 1 hour and then rinsed in 0.1M PBS.\nFor immunohistochemistry, sections were overlaid with 4% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PBS for 1 hour followed by primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. After PBS washes (3x), sections were incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 hour. Immunoperoxidase labeling required quenching of endogenous peroxidases with 6% H\n2\nO\n2\ndiluted in methanol for 15 minutes at room temperature prior to incubation with Vectastain ABC (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 hour at room temperature. Bound antibody was visualized by overlaying sections with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Vector Laboratories) for 5\u201315 minutes (until optimal differentiation of signal). To reduce non-specific labeling caused by using mouse primary antibodies on mouse tissues, primary and secondary antibodies were mixed at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour then normal mouse serum was added for an additional hour at 37\u00b0C at a dilution of 1:1000. The antibody mixture was allowed to cool on ice for 1\u20132 hours. The primary and secondary antibody complex was overlaid onto tissue sections overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by ABC amplification and DAB development as described above.\nA separate protocol was used to identify human immune cell types. After thawing, tissue sections were placed in ice-cold methanol for 20\u201330 minutes, followed by washes in PBS. When required (i.e. hCD3), antigen retrieval was accomplished by incubating tissues in heated alkaline pH Tris-based solution (H-3301, Vector Laboratories) followed by a blocking step using a mixture of 4% BSA, 3% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PBS for 1 hour. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by washes in PBS and subsequent incubation at room temperature for 1 hour with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Information regarding antibody sources, working concentrations, and specificity are reported in\nTable 1\n.\nPhotomicrographs of immunolabeled tissue were captured using an Axioplan 2 imaging microscope equipped with an AxioCam digital camera and AxioVision v.4.8.2 software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). An Olympus FV1000 spectral confocal microscope with 20x and 60x oil objectives (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY) was used to capture single plane images of, maximum intensity projections of confocal Z stacks or orthogonal views for co-localization of fluorescent labeling when appropriate. Image stacks were saved as Olympus OIB files and digital images as 24 bit color TIFF files.\n\nData Analysis\nData were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (version 5.0, La Jolla, CA), and statistical significance was assigned to a p< 0.05. Except where noted, data are represented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean. All figures were generated in Adobe Photoshop CS5 v.12 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA)."

    "Methods": "Controlled Cortical Impact (CCI) and WP1066 administration\nAdult CD-1 male mice (25\u201330g) were subjected to a severe cortical injury by CCI, similar to previous descriptions (\nHunt et al., 2009\n,\nGuo et al., 2013\n). Mice were anesthetized with 2\u20133% isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic head frame. After scalp incision and reflection, a 4-mm diameter craniotomy was created lateral to the sagittal suture and centered between bregma and lambda. The skull cap was removed without damage to the exposed underlying dura. The contusion device consisted of a computer controlled, pneumatically driven impactor fitted with a beveled stainless steel tip 3 mm in diameter (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Fairfax, VA). Brain injury was generated using this device to compress the cortex to a depth of 2.0 mm at a velocity of 5.0 m/s and 199 ms duration (CCI-S) or to a depth of 1.0 mm at a velocity of 5.0 m/s and 400 ms duration (CCI-M). After the injury, the resulting bleeding was controlled and incision sutured.\nThe commercially available cell-permeable inhibitor WP1066 (Selleck Chemicals LLC) has been shown to be an effective STAT3 pathway inhibitor (\nHussain et al., 2007\n,\nIwamaru et al., 2007\n,\nKupferman et al., 2009\n,\nGrabenstatter et al., 2013\n). This inhibitor has been shown to block the JAK2/STAT3 interaction and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT3 at tyrosine 705 (\nFaderl et al., 2007\n). WP1066 has also been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and effectively block STAT3 activation after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration in rodent models of cerebral injuries (\nIwamaru et al., 2007\n,\nStatler et al., 2009\n,\nGrabenstatter et al., 2013\n). For this study, all operated mice were give i.p. injections of 0.05 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or 0.05 ml of 75 mg/kg of WP1066 in DMSO 30 and 90 minutes after experimental injury.\nA total of 433 animals underwent surgery of which 103 were sham injured animals, 105 were CCI-S injured animals, 98 were CCI-M injured animals and 127 were CCI-S + WP1066 injured animals. None of the animals that underwent Sham, CCI-M or CCI-S injury died due to the injury while of the 127 mice that underwent CCI-S injury and received 75 mg/kg of WP1066 30 and 90 minutes after injury 104 lived; thus, we had a survival rate of 82% for this group which is statistically different from all other groups (Chi-square test). The University of Colorado Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all procedures described.\nAfter the CCI injury, the animals were returned to their cages and allowed to recover for 6 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks or 16 weeks after injury (all timepoints for analysis are post CCI). At one of the above time points, animals were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane in an induction chamber, decapitated, and their brains were rapidly removed. The hippocampi were dissected and flash frozen for storage in a \u221280\u00b0 C freezer.\n\nWestern blot\nWestern blot was performed with modifications of published protocols (\nRaol, et al., 2006\n). Protein was extracted from whole hippocampus (intact hippocampus in sham-injured controls and the entire remaining hippocampus in injured mice). Since after severe CCI injury a large portion of the anterior hippocampus is absent (see\nFigure 1\n), for a subset of sham injured mice (1 week post operation), we transected the hippocampus after dissection, then extracted and measured protein separately from the anterior and posterior halves to determine if there was a regional difference in the levels of GABA\nA\nR subunit proteins that changed after CCI-S (see\nSuppl Fig 7\n). Protein lysate (10\u201320 \u03bcg depending on type of blot) was loaded into 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and run for 1.5 hours at 115 V. Blots were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked in 5% milk/trisphosphate-buffered saline with Tween-20 (TBS-T). Membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against STAT3 phosphorylated at Tyr705 (anti-pSTAT3) (Cell Signaling Technologies; 1:8,000, \u03b11 (Millipore; 1:7000), \u03b22 (PhosphoSolutions;1:1,000), \u03b23 (PhosphoSolutions; 1:1,000), \u03b32 (PhosphoSolutions; 1:1,000) or \u03b4 (Millipore; 1:600) overnight at 4\u00b0C in 5% bovine serum albumin/TBS-T (for pSTAT3) or 1% milk/TBS-T (for GABA\nA\nR), then washed and incubated with anti-rabbit antibody (1:15,000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 hour. Protein bands were detected with the use of chemiluminescent solution (Pierce), then membranes were stripped and reprobed with rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against total STAT3 (anti-STAT3) (Cell Signaling Technologies; 1:6,000) or \u03b2-actin (Sigma 1:40,000) and bands were quantified using Image J software (NIH) and expressed as percent or fold change with respect to mean control values in the same run (defined as 100 or 1, respectively).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nProgressive tissue loss following CCI-S and CCI-M injuries.

To synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA), 1 \u03bcg of RNA was separated and processed with the SuperScript II reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and then diluted 1:4 for storage and subsequent RT-PCR. For RT-PCR reactions, each sample was run in triplicate and each 25-\u03bcl reaction contained 1.25 \u03bcl GABA\nA\nR subunit \u03b11 or beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) Taqman gene expression primer/probe sets from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA), 12.5 \u03bcl of Taqman Master mix, and 10 \u03bcl of sample cDNA. RT-PCR formed on the SDS-7500 PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). The RT-PCR runs consisted of 1 cycle of 50\u00b0C for 2 min, then 1 cycle of 95\u00b0C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. All values were normalized to B2M expression in the same samples to control for loading variability, and then expressed as fold change with respect to mean controls values in the same run (defined as 1).\n\nCresyl violet (CV) staining and analysis\nMice were sacrificed two weeks following CCI by transcardial perfusion with cold phosphate buffered saline (0.01M) and 4% paraformaldehyde (in 0.1 M). After the brain was perfused, it was removed and post fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (in 0.1M) at 4\u00b0C, then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. The brain was then embedded (in Tissue-Tek OCT Compound, Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA), frozen, and then was serially sectioned in the coronal plane throughout the entire extent of the lesion. Every 6\nth\ncoronal brain section (30 \u03bcm each) was mounted, stained with cresyl violet (CV) and imaged for quantitation of lesion area. Tissue sections were briefly mounted on gelatin-coated slides and dehydrated at room temperature for 5 minute immersion in 70% ethanol, followed by two 5 minute immersions in 95% ethanol, and then immersed for 5 minutes in xylenes. The sections were then rehydrated by immersion for 5 minutes in 95% ethanol, 5 minutes in 70% ethanol, and 5 minutes in distilled H\n2\nO. The sections were then stained with cresyl violet acetate (1.5 grams of cresyl echt violet in 300 ml H\n2\nO plus 1 ml 10% glacial acetic acid) for 4 minutes then rinsed with H\n2\nO for 2 minutes, and differentiated by immersion for 1 minute in acidified distilled H2O (1 ml of glacial acetic acid to 300 ml of H\n2\nO) and 1 minute in H\n2\nO. The sections were dehydrated by immersion for 3 minutes in 70% ethanol, 3 minutes 95% ethanol twice and 3 minutes 100% ethanol twice. Lastly the sections were cleared by immersion for 5 minutes in xylenes twice and cover-slipped with permount. Sections were imaged using a 2X objective (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U) and quantitated using ImageJ software. To best approximate the amount of volume loss associated with the lesion, the total area of the contralateral (unlesioned) hemisphere as well as the ipsilateral (lesioned) hemisphere was measured in every 6\nth\nsection throughout the A-P extent of the lesion for each animal. The area of the lesioned side was summated from all sections from a given animal and the same was done for the unlesioned side from the same animal, then the summated area of the unlesioned side was divided by the summated area of the lesioned side for each animal, converted to a percent value, and subtracted from 100% to calculate the total percentage of tissue loss within the region of the lesion in the ipsilateral hemisphere compared to the contralateral hemisphere. The technician who conducted the analysis was blinded to injury severity and treatment group.\n\nEEG acquisition and analysis\nTo accurately analyze electrographic seizure frequency, two bilateral subdural stainless steel screws (0.25 mm posterior, 1.5 mm lateral relative to the bregma for the ipsilateral side and 1 mm posterior, 1.5 mm from lateral relative to the bregma for the contralateral) were placed over the temporolimbic cortices. Additional stainless steel screws were placed on each side of the brain behind lambda (i.e., over the cerebellum) and were used as reference and ground electrodes. Animals were allowed to recover from surgery for 1 week before proceeding with any further experimentation. Implanted mice were video-EEG monitored 24 h/day for six consecutive weeks using Triangle BioSystems International and Stellate digital video-EEG systems. Mice were placed in the recording chamber and flexible cables were attached to a commutator (i.e., electric swivel) system, which allowed the animal to move freely. EEG signals were sampled at 1 kHz, amplified by 800 \u00d7, and band-pass filtered between 0.3 Hz and 60 Hz.\nOff-line data analyses were performed by trained technicians blinded to all experimental parameters. Electrographic seizures were differentiated from background noise by the appearance of large-amplitude (at least twice times baseline), high frequency (minimum of 5 Hz) activity, with progression of the spike frequency that lasts for a minimum of 10 s. Electrographic seizures were manually detected in EEG recordings based on the above criteria and correlated with behavioral manifestations in continuous video recordings. Motor seizures were scored by standard behavioral classes (Racine, 1972) as follows: (1) behavioral arrest, eye closure, vibrissae twitching, sniffing: (2) facial clonus and head bobbing; (3) forelimb clonus; (4) rearing with continued forelimb clonus; and (5) rearing with loss of motor control and falling. Electrographic seizures class 3 and above were classified as convulsive and seizures scored as class 2 and below were classified as non-convulsive.\n\nNovel Object Recognition (NOR)\nTo test memory performance, Novel Object Recognition (NOR) testing was used 2 and 16 weeks post CCI. The test was performed in a 30cm by 30cm by 30cm box where the mouse was video recorded during each phase of the test. On the first testing day, each mouse was placed in the box for a 5 minute session and left to explore and acclimatize to the arena. Approximately 5 minutes after the acclimatization period, the mouse was again placed into the same arena with two copies of the same object placed systematically in the box and allowed to explore the object freely for 5 minutes. After the habituation period elapsed, the mouse was returned to its home cage. 24 hours later, the mouse was again placed into the same arena, but this time one of the objects was replaced with a new object of similar size. The mouse was again allowed to freely explore the objects for 5 minutes. During each phase of the test, the entire box and the object were cleaned to avoid the presence of olfactory cues.\nOff-line data analyses were performed by trained technicians blinded to all experimental parameters to identify (1) if the mouse was able to freely move around the arena and (2) measure the amount of time the mouse spent exploring each object (for the first 3 minutes of each phase of the test).\n\nRotaRod (RR)\nThe rotarod test has been shown to be a sensitive index of injury-induced vestibular motor dysfunction following experimental TBI. The rotarod device consists of a metal and plastic frame, which suspends a rotating rod large enough in diameter for adult mice to stand on. Plastic wafers split the rod into four slots, and prevent the animals from seeing each other or coming into contact while on the rod. Each animal was removed from its home cage and placed on the rod. Then, the animal\u2019s task was to walk on the rod as it rotates, to avoid falling off. If the animal did fall off, he only fell a short distance (about 8 inches) and activated a magnetic timer that recorded the duration that the animal was on the rod. The rod\u2019s rotation was programmed to accelerate from 4 to 40 rpm over the course of 5 minutes (300s.) The duration the animal lasts on the rod, up to the maximum of 300s, was recorded. Immediately after testing, the animal was returned to its home cage. After a brief (1\u20132 minute) rest, the next trial began. A pre-injury period of learning trials was completed over the four days prior to injury, with four trials per day. After injury, four trials were run at each selected time point following injury (3 days post CCI, 7 days post CCI, 12 weeks post CCI, and 16 weeks post CCI) and the individual trial and mean times for each animal were recorded.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical significance was defined as a P value of less than 0.05. All calculations were done using GraphPad Prism 6 software. Comparisons between sham injured mice, CCI-S injured mice and CCI-S + WP injured mice were done by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Tukey\u2019s HSD test for multiple comparisons or with Fisher\u2019s exact testing."

    "Methods": "Animals\nTransplantation into rats and mice\nFemale Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250\u2013300 grams were purchased from Taconic Farm (Rockville, MD). Female C57BL/6 wild-type mice weighing 20\u201330 grams were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All animals were housed in a humidity-, temperature-, and light-controlled animal facility with\nad libitum\naccess to water and food. Experimental procedures were approved by the Thomas Jefferson University IACUC and conducted in compliance with ARRIVE (\nAnimal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments\n) guidelines.\n\nCervical contusion SCI\nRat SCI\nRats were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg), xylazine (5 mg/kg) and acepromazine (2 mg/kg). The cervical dorsal skin and underlying muscles were incised. The paravertebral muscles overlying C3\u2013C5 were removed. Following unilateral laminectomy on the right side at C3, C4 and C5 levels, rats were subjected to a C4 spinal contusion injury with the Infinite Horizon impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Lexington, KY) using a 1.5mm tip at a force of 395 kDynes. This injury paradigm is based on our previously published rat model that results in robust PhMN degeneration and chronic diaphragm dysfunction (\nNicaise et al., 2013\n;\nNicaise et al., 2012\n). Rats were transplanted in all studies immediately following injury. After surgical procedures, overlying muscles were closed in layers with sterile 4-0 silk sutures, and the skin incision was closed using wound clips. Animals were allowed to recover on a circulating warm water heating pad until awake and then returned to their home cages. They were monitored daily until sacrifice, and measures were taken to avoid dehydration and to minimize any pain or discomfort.\nMouse SCI\nMice were anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine (120 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg). The surgical procedure and post-surgical monitoring used for mice were the same as described above for rats. For the contusion injury, the 1mm impactor tip was raised 1.25mm above the dura prior to impact, and a force of 50 kDynes (kD) was used for impact.\n\nVirus production\nLentiviral vector carrying the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene or GLT1 gene was packaged in 293FT cells. Briefly, To produce control lentiviral-GFP vector, 293FT cells were transfected with pCDH-MSCV-MCS-EF1-GFP plasmid (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) and three other helper plasmids, pLP-1, pLP-2, and pLP/VSVG with Polyfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). To produce lentiviral-GLT1 vector, GLT1 gene CDS fragment was inserted into MCS of pCDH-MSCV-MCS-EF1-GFP plasmid, and the vector plasmid was then transfected into 293FT cells with three helper plasmids as described above. Supernatant was collected 72 hours later, and lentiviral vector was concentrated with PEG-it Virus Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) and re-suspended with PBS to the final titer of 1\u00d710\n8\ninfectious units/ml.\n\nHuman induced pluripotent stem cell derived astrocytes\nHuman iPS cell derivation, culturing and astrocyte differentiation\niPS cells were derived from non-diseased healthy patient donors. Dermal fibroblasts were reprogrammed into iPS cells via retroviral transduction with KLF4, SOX2, OCT4, and c-MYC (\nTakahashi et al., 2007a\n). By immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR, these putative iPS cells expressed proteins and transcripts associated with pluripotency, including Sox 2, and stem cell-associated antigens, including SSEA4, Nanog, alkaline phosphatase, and TRA 1\u201381, and capacity to differentiate into cells of three germ layers was established. Finally, the karyotype of these iPS cells was found to be normal. Once pluripotent iPS cells were generated, the stem cells were cultured in E8 medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). To maintain optimum pluripotency and limit spontaneous differentiation, the stem cell colonies were manually cleaned once every 6days just before passage using dispase (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC). To differentiate the iPS cells into astrocytes, a protocol previously described by Haidet-Phillips and colleagues (\nHaidet-Phillips et al., 2014\n) was used. To summarize, iPS cells were lifted with dispase, gently separated into single cells and plated as a monolayer. Using the smad dual inhibition pathway method to direct differentiation toward a neural phenotype, the cells were incubated in DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) enriched with 0.2 \u00b5M LDN (Stemgent, Cambridge, MA) and 10\u00b5M SB431542 (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO). The cells were then exposed to 1\u00b5M retinoic acid (Sigma, Saint Louis MO) and N2 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) starting at day 5 and Sonic HedgeHog (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) starting at day 8. From day 15 to day 30 after starting the differentiation protocol, the medium was gradually changed to neurobasal medium. After day 30, to differentiate these iPS cell-derived glial progenitors into astrocytes, cells were maintained and expanded in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1% Fetal Bovine Serum, B27, L-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, penicillin/streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and 2\u00b5g/ml Heparin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for an additional 60 days. Astrocytes derived from human iPS were identified with immunostaining using GFAP antibody. For feeding and passaging of astrocyte progenitor cultures, cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated with 4ml of 0.05% trypsin for 5 minutes. Cells were collected in trypsin and rinsed with 7ml of culture medium and 1\u00d7 trypsin inhibitor (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) to stop trypsinization. Cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes and re-suspended in fresh culture medium. Cells were counted and seeded onto poly-L-lysine coated dishes. Cells were fed twice a week and were passaged after they were 80%\u201390% confluent.\nGLT1 overexpression\nAfter differentiation for 90 days, hIPSAs (astrocytes derived from human iPS cells) were transduced with lentiviral-GFP vector or lentiviral-GLT1 vector, at the concentration of 1\u00d710\n6\ninfectious units/ml, one week before transplantation. On the second day of transduction, culture medium was changed and the cells were cultured for 5 more days.\n\nHuman dermal fibroblasts\nHuman dermal fibroblast cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured with Fibroblast Growth Kit-low serum (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Fibroblasts were transduced with control lentiviral-GFP vector one week before transplantation. Transduced GFP was used to track transplanted cells\nin vivo\n.\n\nTransplantation\nCell preparation for transplantation\nOn the day of transplantation, cells were rinsed with PBS and trypsinized with 0.05% trypsin, collected and rinsed with culture medium and 1\u00d7 trypsin inhibitor. The cells were washed with artificial cerebrospinal fluid twice. Cell viability was assessed using the trypan blue assay and was always found to be greater than 80%. The final cell concentration was adjusted to 1\u00d710\n8\ncells/ml.\nIntraspinal transplantation\nTransplantation was conducted on deeply anesthetized rats and mice immediately post-injury. Following unilateral right-sided contusion injury at C4, cells were injected into the spinal cord at two locations. Each site contained 2\u00b5L of cell suspension, which was administered into the spinal cord ventral horn using a Hamilton gas-tight syringe mounted on an electronic UMP3 micropump (World Precision International, Sarasota, FL) (\nLepore and Maragakis, 2011\n;\nLepore et al., 2011a\n). The sites of injections were located at the rostral and caudal edges of the contusion site. Ventral horns were targeted by lowering the 33-gauge 45-degree beveled needle 1.5mm below the dorsal surface of the spinal cord. Each injection was delivered at a constant rate over 5 minutes. Upon completion of cell delivery, overlying muscles were then closed in layers with sterile 4-0 silk sutures, and the skin incision was closed using sterile wound clips. Animals were allowed to recover and monitored daily.\nImmune suppression\nAll animals were immune suppressed. Rats received subcutaneous administration of cyclosporine A (10mg/kg; Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ) daily beginning three days before grafting and continuously until sacrifice. Mice were given both FK-506 and rapamycin (1 mg/kg each; LC Laboratories; Woburn, MA).\n\nTissue processing for histology\nAt the time of sacrifice, animals were anesthetized, and diaphragm muscle was freshly removed prior to perfusion and then further processed for neuromuscular junction (NMJ) labeling. Animals were transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde infusion. Spinal cords were harvested, then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 3 days and embedded in freezing medium. Spinal cord tissue blocks were cut serially in the sagittal or transverse planes at a thickness of 30\u00b5m. Sections were collected on glass slides and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until analysis. Spinal cord sections were thawed, allowed to dry for 1 hour at room temperature, and stained with 0.5% Cresyl violet acetate according to standard procedure (\nNicaise et al., 2012\n).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nFrozen spinal cord sections were air-dried, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 minutes at room temperature, and then incubated in blocking solution (PBS containing 10% normal goat serum and 0.4% Triton X-100) for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were labeled overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibodies in blocking solution. Sections were then washed three times with PBS (5 minutes per wash) and incubated with secondary antibodies in blocking solution for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS (10 minutes per wash), sections were cover-slipped. A number of primary antibodies were used. Mouse anti-GFAP antibody (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA; 1:200) and rabbit anti-GFAP antibody (Dako North America, Carpinteria, CA; 1:200) were used to label astrocytes (\nLepore et al., 2008a\n). Mouse anti-human GFAP antibody (StemCells, Inc, Newark, CA; 1:200) was used to label astrocytes of human origin in mice and rats. Rabbit anti-GLT1 (1:800) and mouse anti-GLT1 (1:200) were used to label GLT1 protein (both were provided by Jeffrey Rothstein\u2019s laboratory) (\nLepore et al., 2008b\n). Rabbit anti-Ki67 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL; 1:200) labeled proliferating cells (\nLepore et al., 2008a\n). Mouse anti-human cytoplasmic marker antibody (StemCells, Inc, Newark, CA; 1:200) and mouse anti-HuNu antibody (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA; 1:200) were used to label human cytoplasm and human nuclear antigen, respectively, for selectively identifying human-derived cells. Secondary antibodies included: FITC goat-anti-mouse IgG, FITC goat-anti-rabbit IgG, TRITC goat-anti-mouse IgG, TRITC goat-anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 647 goat-anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 647 goat-anti-rabbit IgG. All secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) were diluted at 1:200 to recognize the matched primary antibody. For fluorescence analysis, sections were cover-slipped with fluorescent-compatible mounting medium (ProLong Gold, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY).\n\nQuantification of in vitro cultured cell differentiation, proliferation and GLT1 expression\nThe proportions of GFAP\n+\nastrocytes and Ki67\n+\nproliferating cells were expressed as a percentage of the total number of cultured cells (labeled by DAPI). In order to quantify double-labeling of DAPI with GFAP or Ki67, images were taken at 10\u00d7 magnification and analyzed using ImageJ software. In each image, cells with a DAPI\n+\nnucleus were assessed for expression of GFAP or Ki67.\n\nQuantification of transplant differentiation\nRats and mice were sacrificed for quantification of astrocyte differentiation (GFAP\n+\n) and proliferation (Ki67\n+\n). The proportions GFAP\n+\nastrocytes and Ki67\n+\nproliferating cells were expressed as a percentage of the total number of transplanted human cells (labeled by anti-hCytoplasm or HuNu antibody). In order to quantify double-labeling of hCytoplasm or HuNA with GFAP and Ki67, double-labeled transverse sections were imaged at 10\u00d7 magnification using MetaMorph software and were then analyzed using ImageJ software. In each image, cells expressing hCytoplasm or HuNu were assessed for co-expression of GFAP or Ki67.\n\nQuantification of GLT1 expression by transplants\nRats and mice were sacrificed for quantification of GLT1 expression by hCyto-labeled cells in the ventral horn. GLT1\n+\nand hCyto\n+\ncells were identified in the ventral horn using ImageJ software, and the percentage of hCyto\n+\ncells (representing any transplant-derived cell) that co-expressed GLT1 were quantified.\n\nLesion imaging and quantification\nImages were acquired with a Zeiss Imager M2 upright microscope and analyzed with ImageJ software. Lesion size was quantified in Cresyl violet stained sections (\nLi et al., 2014b\n). Specifically, lesion area was determined in every 10th section by tracing both the total area of the hemi-spinal cord ipsilateral to the contusion site and the actual lesion area. Lesion was defined as areas including both lost tissue (cystic cavity formation) and surrounding damaged tissue in which the normal anatomical structure of the spinal cord was lost. The lesion epicenter was defined as the section with the largest percent lesioned tissue (relative to total tissue area in the same section).\n\nNeuromuscular junction (NMJ) analysis\nFresh hemi-diaphragm muscle was dissected from each animal for whole-mount immunohistochemistry, as described previously (\nWright et al., 2007\n). Hemi-diaphragm muscle was dissected, stretched, pinned down to Sylgard medium (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), and extensively cleaned to remove any connective tissue to allow for antibody penetration. Motor axons and their terminals were labeled with SMI-312R (Covance, Princeton, NJ; 1:1000) and SV2-s (DSHB, Iowa City, IA; 1:10), respectively, and both primary antibodies were detected with FITC anti-mouse IgG secondary (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA; 1:100). Post-synaptic acetylcholine receptors were labeled with rhodamine-conjugated alpha-bungarotoxin (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY; 1:400). Labeled muscles were analyzed for total numbers of NMJs and intact, denervated and multiply-innervated NMJs. Whole-mounted diaphragms were imaged on a FluoView FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). We only conducted NMJ analysis in ipsilateral hemi-diaphragm because in our previously published work we did not observe denervation or sprouting in contralateral hemi-diaphragm after cervical hemi-contusion SCI (\nNicaise et al., 2012\n).\n\nFunctional glutamate uptake assay\nAfter transduction with lentiviral-GFP vector or lentiviral-GLT1 vector, hIPSAs were cultured for 10 days. Human fibroblasts transduced with lentiviral-GFP vector were used as control. Glutamate uptake activity was measured as previously described (\nDowd and Robinson, 1996\n), with slight modification. Briefly, cells were washed and pre-incubated with either a sodium- or choline-containing uptake buffer (in mM: Tris, 5; HEPES, 10; NaCl or choline chloride, 140; KCl, 2.5; CaCl2, 1.2; MgCl\n2\n, 1.2; K2HPO\n4\n, 1.2; glucose, 10) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C; and in DHK treatment groups, 100\u00b5M of DHK was added to inhibit GLT1. The uptake buffer was then replaced with fresh uptake buffer containing 20nM\n3\nH-glutamate (49 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer, CA) and 20\u00b5M unlabeled glutamate. The cells were incubated for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The reaction was terminated by washing cells three times with choline-containing uptake buffer containing 2mM unlabeled glutamate, followed by immediate lysis in ice-cold 0.1N NaOH. Cell extracts were then measured with a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). The protein content in each well was measured using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).\n\niaphragm Compound Muscle Action Potentials (CMAPs)\nRats were anesthetized in the same manner described above. Phrenic nerve conduction studies were performed with single stimulation (0.5 ms duration; 6 mV amplitude) at the neck via near nerve needle electrodes placed along the phrenic nerve (\nLi et al., 2014b\n;\nNicaise et al., 2012\n). The ground needle electrode was placed in the tail, and the reference electrode was placed subcutaneously in the right abdominal region. Recording was obtained via a surface strip along the costal margin of the diaphragm, and CMAP amplitude was measured baseline to peak. Recordings were made using an ADI Powerlab 8/30 stimulator and BioAMP amplifier (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO), followed by computer-assisted data analysis (Scope 3.5.6, ADInstruments). For each animal, 10\u201320 tracings were averaged to ensure reproducibility.\n\nSpontaneous EMG recordings\nPrior to being euthanized, animals received a laparotomy. These EMG recordings were terminal experiments and were only conducted immediately prior to euthanasia. Bipolar electrodes spaced by 3 mm were inserted into specific subregions of the right hemi-diaphragm (i.e. dorsal, medial or ventral regions) (\nLi et al., 2014b\n). Activity was recorded and averaged during spontaneous breathing at each of these 3 locations separately in each animal. The EMG signal was amplified, filtered through a band-pass filter (50\u20133000 Hz), and integrated using LabChart 7 software (ADInstruments). Parameters such as inspiratory bursts per minute, discharge duration and integrated peak amplitude were averaged over 2 minute sample periods. No attempt was made to control or monitor the overall level of respiratory motor drive during the EMG recordings.\n\nStatistics\nResults were expressed as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). A Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test was conducted for all variables to assess normality. Unpaired\nt\ntest or Mann-Whitney was used to assess statistical significance between two groups. With respect to multiple comparisons involving three groups or more, statistical significance was assessed by analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) followed by post-hoc test (Bonferroni's method). Statistics were computed with Graphpad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).\np\n<0.05 was considered as statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nAdult male Sprague Dawley rats (250\u2013350 g; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were used according to procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Emory University, Atlanta GA (protocol # DAR- 2001411). All animals were housed in an AAALAC-approved Research Animal Facility with a temperature-, humidity-, and light-controlled environment, and placed under a 12-hour reverse light\u2013dark cycle. Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all other applicable regulations, policies, and procedures were followed and approved by Emory University Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. The experiments are reported here in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines. Animals were randomized into three groups (n = 6\u20138 each): sham-operated vehicle-treated control; tMCAO + vehicle; and tMCAO + progesterone (8 mg/kg). The rats were assigned randomly to the treatment groups and group identity was coded with regard to surgery and treatment.\n\nDrug preparation\nReagent grade progesterone (P-3972; Sigma Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO) was dissolved in 22.5% 2-hydroxypropyl-\u03b2 cyclodextrin and administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection 1 h post-occlusion to ensure rapid delivery (\nIshrat et al., 2010\n), and then subcutaneously (SC) at 6, 24, and 48 h post-occlusion. The 8 mg/kg dose is based on previous dose response studies in rodents demonstrating that this amount provides maximal protective benefits in the treatment of various types of brain injury (\nIshrat et al., 2009\n;\nWali et al., 2014\n;\nYousuf et al., 2014\n).\n\nTransient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Injury Model\nFocal cerebral ischemia was induced by occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery as previously described (\nLonga et al., 1989\n). Briefly, a midline incision was made on the ventral surface of the neck and the right common carotid artery was isolated and ligated with a 6.0 silk suture. The internal carotid artery and the pterygopalatine artery were temporarily occluded using a microvascular clip. A 4\u20130 nylon monofilament with a heat-blunted tip was introduced into the internal carotid artery through the incision in the external carotid artery. Relative cerebral blood flow was monitored for the entire 90 min of occlusion using laser Doppler (LD) perfusion. Only rats with a mean ischemic cerebral blood flow less than 40% of baseline LDF were included to reduce variability and ensure relative uniformity of the ischemic insult. Mean relative cerebral blood flow observed during occlusion in rats treated with progesterone (26.26%\u00b14.03%) was not statistically different from that observed in vehicle-treated animals (25.69%\u00b13.71%). Reperfusion, as demonstrated by early recovery of the LD flowmetry signal, occurred in all animals regardless of treatment group within minutes of occluding filament release. There were no significant differences in the increase in mean relative cerebral blood flow in the progesterone-treated (93.47%\u00b19.36%) animals compared with the vehicle-treated group (101.80%\u00b111.17%).\nAt 5 min before the onset of reperfusion, drug treatment was administered by IP injection. After 90 min of MCAO, the occluding filament was withdrawn from the common carotid artery to allow reperfusion. One animal died during the tMCAO procedure (prior to treatment) for reasons unknown and was not included in further analyses.\n\nHistology and immunohistochemistry\nMicrovessel density, endothelial cell proliferation and macrophage density in the penumbra cortex were detected by immunohistochemistry, using previously reported methods as a guideline (\nWang et al., 2012\n). Transcardial perfusion was performed and brains were fixed with 10% formalin, harvested and then dehydrated in a 15%, 20% and 30% serial sucrose gradient. Brains were then snap-frozen and cryo-cut coronally at 30 \u03bcm. Brain sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C with the following primary antibodies: rat blood-brain barrier (SMI 71) monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Covance, Princeton, NJ) to detect endothelial cells; CD68 (1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) to detect tissue macrophages; Ki67 (1:500, Abcam) to detect cell proliferation; and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) to determine the pro-angiogenic potential of endothelial cells.\nFor SMI71, CD68, VEGF and Ki67, sections were incubated with the appropriate fluorescence dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Nuclei were stained with 4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) included in the mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunolabeling signals were captured using a Zeiss fluorescent microscope and quantified using a 20X objective lens from 5 random fields from each section and from 3 independent sections for each brain.\n\nCell culture assays and hypoxic injury model\nCommercially available endothelial cells (bEnd.3, ATCC, Manassas, VA) derived from the cerebral cortex of mice were used for oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) studies as previously reported (\nHiu et al., 2008\n). Cells were grown in high-glucose Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (ATCC) and penicillin/streptomycin. For normoxic conditions (>20% oxygen), the cells were transferred into serum-free media containing 4.5 g/l glucose (control media). To induce hypoxia, cells were transferred to a serum- and glucose-free DMEM media that was pre-bubbled with nitrogen gas for 30 min. Hypoxia conditions consisted of 2 h hypoxia in a standard hypoxia chamber set to 0.1% oxygen, with or without the administration of 20 \u03bcM progesterone. Reoxygenation was initiated by adding serum-free, normoxic media (\nHiu et al., 2008\n). TIB-186/IC21 cells were graciously donated by Robert Taylor, Emory University, and cultured in RPMI (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) containing 15% fetal bovine serum (ATCC) and penicillin/streptomycin. Non-treated and non-hypoxic controls were also included within this assay.\n\nTwo Chamber Trans-well Migration Assay\nAn 8-\u03bcm polycarbonate membrane trans-well assay (Costar Corning, Tewksbury, MA) was used to determine the migratory potential of macrophages towards hypoxia stimulated endothelial cells (\nReinhart-King, 2008\n). bEnd.3 endothelial cells were seeded at a density of 1 \u00d7 10\n5\ncells/well in complete DMEM and cultured to confluence into the lower chamber of a 24-well plate. The endothelial cells were then subjected to hypoxia for 2 h and reperfusion for 4 h (+/\u2212 progesterone). During reoxygenation, cultured macrophages (TIB-186/IC21, ATCC) were seeded at a density of 1 \u00d7 10\n4\nin the upper trans-well chamber and allowed to migrate during the reperfusion stage for 4 h. After 4 h, macrophages were fixed and stained with DAPI. Cells from 4 random fields per porous filter were quantified for each condition.\n\nCytokine-specific proteome array\nCytokine release into conditioned media after hypoxia/reperfusion +/\u2212 progesterone treatment was measured utilizing a Mouse Cytokine Array kit (ARY006) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, conditioned media (8 ml) from bEnd.3 cells treated with progesterone (20 \u03bcM) for 2 h during hypoxia and 4 h during reperfusion were concentrated 3-fold using a Pierce Concentrator. After blocking, array panels were incubated in a mixture of conditioned media (1.5 ml) and a cocktail of biotinylated detection antibodies (15 \u03bcl) overnight at 4\u00b0 C. Any cytokine/detection antibody complex present is bound by its cognate immobilized capture antibody on the membrane. After a wash to remove unbound material, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescent detection reagents were added sequentially. To validate results obtained by the proteome profiler, concentrations of MCP-1/CCL2 and Cxcl1 chemokines were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems) using manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Experiments were performed 6 independent times.\n\nProtein extraction and Western blotting\nThirty \u03bcg of protein lysed in radio-immunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA) were loaded onto 7.5% SDS polyacrylamide gels (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and subsequently transferred to PDVF membranes (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk. The TNF-\u03b1 antibody (Abcam) was used at a 1:5000 dilution. Blots were analyzed using densitometry software (Un-Scan-It, Orem, UT) and normalized to \u03b2-actin (Cell Signaling, Danvers MA), used at a 1:10,000 dilution.\n\nStatistical analysis\nBased on a delta-value of 1.25, we calculated the sample sizes and power needed to reject the null hypothesis to achieve 80% power to detect a 50% difference in the outcome measures indicated above. The number of rats per group at these criteria was determined to be at least six to reject the null hypothesis (H0) at the 0.05 level at a power of 0.8. The parameters were analyzed using one-way analysis (ANOVA, 2 tailed) of variance followed by the Bonferonni\npost hoc\ntest. All data are presented as mean\u00b1s.e.m. All tests were considered statistically significant at p values less than 0.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Subjects\nAll procedures were in accordance with guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and approved by the University of Western Ontario Animal Use Subcommittee. Subjects were one hundred eighty-seven adult male Long-Evans hooded rats obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Quebec, Canada). Prior to surgery rats weighed between 250\u2013300 g. After surgery rats were housed individually for the remainder of the study using a 12:12 light/dark cycle and were allowed access to food and water ad libitum. As described above, in other studies (\nBao et al., 2012b\n;\nShultz et al., 2013\n) these same rats were also examined for brain inflammatory and injury responses as well as behavioral responses to TBI.\n\n2.2. Treatment groups\nRats were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: sham-injury with saline injection (sham), single moderate or repeated mild TBI and treatment with an isotype-matched control mAb designated as 1B7, or treatment with an anti-CD11d mAb (217 L). The mAb 217 and 1B7 were generously provided by the former ICOS Corporation (mAb currently owned by Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, IN). Rats received their assigned treatment (saline, 1.0 mg/kg 1B7 or 1.0 mg/kg CD11d mAb 217L) either 2 h post-injury (single moderate TBI, 75 rats) or at 2 h and 24 h post-injury (repeated mild TBI, 92 rats) via tail vein injection. Accordingly, the rats undergoing the repeated mild TBI received a total of six doses of CD11d mAb whereas the rats that had a single injury received only one dose. In previous studies, this dosing regimen of CD11d mAb was highly effective in suppressing inflammation and oxidative damage in the brains of these same rats (\nBao et al., 2012b\n;\nShultz et al., 2013\n). Furthermore, a similar dosing regimen in spinal cord-injured rats reduces inflammation in their injured spinal cords as well as the SIRS response to cord injury (\nBao et al., 2004\n,\n2011\n;\nGris et al., 2004\n). The response of the lung to TBI was assessed at 24 h and 72 h in the single injury group and at 72 h after the last injury in the repeated TBI group. Lungs were also examined in the chronic period post-injury, at 4 weeks after the single injury and at 8 weeks after the last treatment after the repeated injuries. Details of numbers of rats in these groups are in\nTable 1\n.\nTable 1.\nNumber of rats used in the study.\nUninjured\nSham-injured saline\nTBI 1B7\nTBI anti-CD11d\nSingle moderate TBI\n24 h\n24 h\n72 h\n4 weeks\n24 h\n72 h\n4 weeks\n24 h\n72 h\n4 weeks\nControl studies\n4\na\n, 4\nb\n4\nb\n4\na\n, 4\nBiochemistry and Western blotting\n6\n7\n5\n7\n7\n6\n7\n8\n5\nImmunohistochemistry\n5\n5\n9\n4\n5\n9\n5\n5\n9\nRepeated mild TBI\n72 h\n8 weeks\n72 h\n8 weeks\n72 h\n8 weeks\nBiochemistry and Western blotting\n6\n6\n7\n7\n6\n6\nImmunohistochemistry\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\nOpen in a new tab\na\nNo treatment.\nb\nTreated with 1B7 mAb.\nThe lung samples in this study were obtained from rats that had been studied for effects of the anti-CD11d treatment on behavior and brain inflammatory responses after TBI (\nBao et al., 2012b\n;\nShultz et al., 2013\n). In those studies, saline was a suitable control treatment instead of the isotype-matched mAb because direct actions of the circulating mAb on the CNS were unlikely (\nFleming et al., 2008\n;\nGris et al., 2004\n;\nOatway et al., 2005\n). However, the lungs of these rats were clearly exposed to the circulating antibody and, for that reason, an assessment of possible direct mAb effects on the lungs was necessary. Thus five additional control groups (n = 4 each, see\nTable 1\n) constituted a control study to examine possible direct effects of the circulating mAb on the lung that might initiate a SIRS response. Injections of the control 1B7 mAb were delivered as described above to uninjured rats, sham injured rats and rats injured with a single moderate TBI (see below). Comparisons also were made to untreated uninjured rats, and to untreated rats injured with the single moderate TBI. The most sensitive and reliable indicator of lung inflammation and the presence of a SIRS in our previous studies has been the activity of the oxidative enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) that is highly expressed by neutrophils and activated macrophages (\nBao et al., 2011\n,\n2012a\n;\nGris et al., 2008\n), when measured between 12 and 24 h after a CNS injury. Therefore, in the control study, post-injury MPO analyses of the lungs were done at 24 h after the sham injury or TBI.\n\n2.3. Surgery and injury\nRats were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and, under aseptic conditions, underwent a circular window craniotomy centered with reference to Bregma at anterior/posterior \u22123.0 mm and medial/lateral 6.0 mm (\nPaxinos and Watson, 1986\n). A hollow plastic cap was sealed over the craniotomy and filled with sterile saline. The rat was then attached to the fluid percussion injury device [for details see Shultz et al. (\nShultz et al., 2011\n)]. For the single moderate injury paradigm, rats in the anti-CD11d group or 1B7 control group received a single fluid percussion pulse of 2.5\u20133.0 atm (a moderate injury). Sham-injured rats were treated similarly but were removed from the FPI device without receiving fluid percussion. This fluid percussion force was based values used in previous rodent studies (\nPassineau et al., 2001\n;\nPillay et al., 2007\n;\nShojo and Kibayashi, 2006\n;\nThompson et al., 2005\n). Rats received tail vein injections of the assigned treatments at 2 h post-injury. After treatment the rats were assigned to a 24 h, 72 h or 4 week recovery group.\nFor the repeated mild injury paradigm, rats in the CD11d and 1B7 groups were treated as above and received a single fluid percussion pulse with a force of 1.0\u20131.5 atm (a mild injury). Again, sham-injured rats were treated identically but were removed from the injury device without receiving the percussion pulse. Rats received tail vein injections of the assigned treatments 2 h and 24 h after each injury and then were given a 5-day inter-injury recovery period before undergoing the identical injury procedure as described above for the remaining two injuries. After their final drug injection, rats were assigned to either a 72 h or 8 week recovery group.\n\n2.4. Tissue preparation for morphological examination and for Western blotting analysis\nFor morphological examination, sham-injured and TBI rats were anesthetized at their assigned time after injury and perfused transcardially into the aorta with cold saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2\u20137.4. At the same time the lungs were perfused separately via the pulmonary artery with saline and then paraformaldehyde. The left lung was removed, post-fixed for 24 h at 4 \u00b0C and cryoprotected in increasing concentrations of sucrose. A piece, approximately 0.5 cm thick, was sampled from the center of the lung and sectioned into 25 \u03bcm thick sections which were placed in buffer for immunohistochemical staining. The pieces of lung sampled from each rat were as identical as possible.\nApproximately five lung sections sampled from each of four sham-injured rats and four single moderate TBI rats at 24 h after the injury were stained by hematoxylin and eosin. Likewise, lung sections from each of four sham-injured rats and four rats at 72 h after the third of three mild TBIs were stained by hematoxylin and eosin. The sections were viewed and photographed using an Olympus microscope and imaging system as described below.\nFor biochemical and Western blotting analyses, the various groups of rats were perfused only with cold 0.9% NaCl, via the aorta and pulmonary artery, as above. The left lungs were then removed and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until they were used. For the assays, tissue samples were taken from the approximate center of the lobes of lung and each sample was then divided into three parts for different biochemical analyses. All homogenization steps were done with a glass homogenizer on ice. For Western blotting, lung (350 mg) samples were homogenized, centrifuged and the supernatant was used as described previously (\nBao et al., 2004\n). For measurement of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, different samples from the lung (130 mg) were homogenized with the inclusion of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (to extract the MPO from the leukocyte granules), centrifuged and the supernatant was used for MPO assay as described previously (\nBao et al., 2004\n). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured to assess lipid peroxidation and a 2\u2032-7\u2032-dichloroflorescin-diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay was used to detect free radicals. The lung samples (170 mg) were homogenized, centrifuged and the supernatant used for TBARS and DCFH-DA assays as described previously (\nBao et al., 2004\n,\n2005\n). The protein concentration of samples were determined using the modified Bradford method (Bio-Rad, Protein assay kit II; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with bovine serum albumin as standard.\n\n2.5. Assessing infiltration of neutrophils and phagocytic macrophages\nInfiltration of neutrophils and phagocytic macrophages was detected by an MPO assay, by immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections and by Western blotting. For the MPO assay, the lung tissue homogenate was incubated in a 96-well plate in a developing buffer that consisted of 100 \u03bcl of K-PBS and 100 \u03bcl of o-dianosinisidine (12.5 mg per 10 ml distilled water and 9 \u03bcl of 30% H\n2\nO\n2\n). The reaction was stopped by addition of 100 \u03bcl of 1% NaH\n3\nin each well. The plate was scanned using a 96-well plate reader (Multiskan Ascent, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at a wavelength of 450 nm. For every plate, one standard curve in triplicate was performed using MPO from human leukocytes (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO) (\nBao et al., 2004\n).\nFor immunohistochemical staining, randomly selected sections from the pools of lung sections (generated as described above) were processed free-floating for staining as described previously (\nBao et al., 2012a\n). A rabbit anti-rat neutrophil polyclonal antibody diluted 1:20,000 (generous gift of Dr. Daniel Anthony (\nAnthony et al., 1998\n), Oxford University, Oxford, UK) was used to identify neutrophil infiltration and a mouse monoclonal anti-rat ED-1 antibody (1:500, Serotec, Raleigh, NC; analogous to CD68 in humans) was used to identify phagocytic macrophages in the sections. Sections were next incubated overnight with biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody made in donkey (1:500 dilution; Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The immunoreactivity was visualized using diaminobenzidine [(DAB) Sigma Chemical Company, as above] as a chromogen. The slides were viewed using an Olympus microscope (BX50, Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA) and photomicrographs were acquired using a digital camera (Retiga, Quantitative Imaging Corporation, Burnaby, BC, Canada) and Image Pro software version 5.1 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). The sections were examined only qualitatively to confirm the density of inflammatory cells in the lungs in each treatment group. Quantitative analyses of the neutrophils and macrophages were done by Western blotting (details below).\nThe anti-neutrophil antibody was used for Western blotting of proteins in the lung homogenates, to quantify the neutrophil presence. This experiment was successful, yielding a particularly strong band at 56 kDa with about five more faint bands at lower molecular weights. Because of the consistency and clarity of the 56 kDa band, we analyzed this band quantitatively, considering it a good example of neutrophil protein expression. Macrophage ED-1 protein expression in the lung was quantified by Western blot analysis (ED-1 antibody as above). Details of the Western blotting can be found in Bao et al. (\nBao et al., 2012a\n). All Western blots were also stained for \u03b2-actin. This \u03b2-actin staining was done to assure equal protein loading of the gels; the similar bands from the sham-injured, 1B7 control-treated TBI and anti-CD11d-treated TBI samples consistently demonstrated equal protein loading. Quantification of the blots was done by densitometric analysis of the bands of interest as well as the \u03b2-actin bands. Quantitative data presented in the figures and tables are expressed as the ratios of the optical density (per mm\n2\n) of the bands of interest to the optical density of the \u03b2-actin bands (per mm\n2\n). Accordingly, all quantification of Western blot data in figures and tables are expressed as ratios, normalized to \u03b2-actin.\n\n2.6. Assessing oxidative enzymes\nOxidative enzymes in lung were detected by Western blotting for the catalytic subunit (gp91\nphox\n) of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase with a mouse anti-rat gp91\nphox\nantibody (1:500, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) using methods described previously (\nBao et al., 2004\n). Two other oxidative enzymes, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were also detected by Western blot analysis with polyclonal rabbit anti-iNOS (1:500, Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI) and polyclonal rabbit anti-COX-2 (1:500, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) antibodies using the methods described above.\n\n2.7. Assessing free radical production (DCFH-DA assay)\nTo assess free radical production in the lung, we used 2\u2032-7\u2032-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) as a probe for free radical detection (\nBao et al., 2005\n). DCFH-DA is hydrolyzed to DCFH that then is oxidized by reactive oxygen species to form the fluorescent compound, 2\u2032-7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). An aliquot (25 \u03bcl) of the lung homogenate that was used for MPO assays was incubated with 0.1 mM DCFH-DA at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. The formation of the oxidized fluorescent derivative DCF was monitored using a fluorescence spectrophotometer as described previously (\nBao et al., 2005\n).\n\n2.8. Assessing lipid peroxidation and expression levels of Nrf2 and caspase-3\nMalondialdehyde (MDA), a marker for lipid peroxidation, can be associated with cell membrane damage (\nOhkawa et al., 1979\n). MDA and other aldehydes were quantified in the homogenates of the lung as described previously (\nBao et al., 2004\n), using a thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay (\nOhkawa et al., 1979\n). A standard curve was established using MDA bis(dimethyl acetal) (Sigma-Aldrich), and lipid peroxidation was expressed as nmol of TBARS/g tissue. Lipid peroxidation in lung was also detected by the presence of 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE)-bound proteins by Western blots, using a mouse anti-HNE monoclonal antibody (1:5000, Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX) and 10% polyacrylamide gels. To assess the cellular response to the oxidative stress in the lung, we used Western blotting to examine expression of the transcription factor Nrf2 that recognizes an antioxidant response element found in the promoters of cytoprotective genes that are upregulated by oxidative or chemical stress signals (\nLee and Johnson, 2004\n). To detect Nrf2 we used an antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA (diluted 1:1000). Finally, to assess activity in the apoptotic cell death pathway in the lung, we examined the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein caspase-3 by Western blotting (1:500, anti-caspase-3, Upstate, Lake Placid, NY). We quantified the full 32 kDa pro-caspase-3 as our goal was to identify initial changes in gene expression in this apoptotic pathway.\n\n2.9. Statistical analyses\nMean values are expressed \u00b1standard error (S.E.). Results were subjected to parametric statistical analysis using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (\nSnedecor and Cochran, 1989\n). These analyses included data from the sham-injured rats. Although some of the data appear to be suitable for a two-way ANOVA, the sham-injured group did not have two levels of treatment and, because comparisons between the sham-injured, 1B7 control TBI and anti-CD11d TBI groups were essential, it was necessary to use a one-way ANOVA. Differences between means were determined by the post hoc Student Neuman Keuls test if the one-way ANOVA revealed significant differences within the groups. Significance was accepted at\nP\n\u2264 0.05. The control studies designed to test possible direct effects of the mAb treatment on the lung were analyzed by the Student Neuman Keuls test and also by a Holm Sidak test for multiple comparisons (\nGlantz, 2012\n). The power of the performed tests always approximated or exceeded 0.80 when statistically significant differences were detected. Details of the ANOVA for the variables measured are provided in\nTable 2\nand\nSupplemental Table 1\n.

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale C57BL/6 mice aged between 4\u20135 weeks old were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). After arrival, mice were allowed to acclimatize for 3 days prior to the experiment. Mice were provided food and water\nad libitum\nand kept in a facility providing 12 hours of light and lark cycle starting at 6 am. All the procedures performed were in accordance with the guidelines provided and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Utah.\n\nTreatment of mice and seizure monitoring\nMice were anesthetized briefly using a mixture of isoflurane and compressed air. Mice were then injected with 20 \u03bcl of either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, n=30) or 3 \u00d7 10\n5\npfu (plaque forming units) of Daniels strain of TMEV (n=50) intracortically to a depth of 2 mm in the temporal region of the right hemisphere (posterior and medial of the right eye). Mice were agitated by briefly shaking their cages and monitored for behavioral seizures for 1 hour, twice a day and a minimum of 2 hours apart from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, until 10 days post-injection (p.i.) as previously described (\nLibbey et al., 2008\n). The intensity of the seizure activity was graded using the Racine scale as follows: Stage 1, mouth and facial movements; Stage 2, head nodding; Stage 3, forelimb clonus; Stage 4, rearing; and Stage 5, rearing and falling (\nRacine, 1972\n). Mice were sacrificed at 8 hour p.i. (hrpi), and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 14 days pi (dpi). For 3, 4, and 14 dpi, only TMEV-infected mice that had acute behavioral seizures were used, while non-seized mice from the TMEV group were excluded from the studies. The ipsilateral and contralateral portions of the hippocampus were micro-dissected and collected separately. Cerebellum was also collected. All the tissue samples were flash frozen using 2-methylbutane chilled on dry ice and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. The samples were shipped overnight on dry ice to the laboratory of Dr. Manisha Patel at the University of Colorado, Aurora, CO for the analysis.\n\nHPLC determination of GSH and GSSG\nReduced and oxidized forms of GSH were measured by HPLC with electrochemical detection (HPLC-EC) following minor modifications to previously described methods (\nLakritz et al., 1997\n;\nLiang & Patel, 2006\n). GSH and GSSG were detected using a CoulArray system (Model 5600, ESA) on two coulometric array cell modules, each containing eight electrochemical sensors attached in series. Electrochemical detector potentials were 150/300/450/570/690/800/850 mV (vs Pd.). Frozen hippocampi obtained from Dr. Karen Wilcox\u2019s laboratory were sonicated with 0.1N perchloric acid (HClO\n4\n) immediately before thawing in a 1:10 weight by volume ratio. The homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Aliquots of the supernatant (20\u03bcL) were injected into the HPLC and separated on a 5\u03bcM, 250x4.6-mm C-18 ODS-80Tm column (Tosoh Bioscience, Japan). The mobile phase comprised of 100mM sodium phosphate, 1% methanol, pH 2.7 and a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min was maintained. Control values were normalized to one hundred percent and data is represented as percent of control (% control).\n\nHPLC determination of 3-Nitrotyrosine\n3-Nitroyrosine (3NT) and tyrosine levels were measured using HPLC method similar to GSH and GSSH measurements and as previously described (\nRyan et al., 2014\n). Frozen hippocampi samples were processed in the same way as described above and 20\u03bcl of the supernatant was injected into an ESA 5600 CoulArray HPLC (Chelmsford, MA). Separation was achieved using the same column and mobile phase as mentioned above.\n\nStatistical analyses\nGraphPad Prism 6 was used for all statistical analyses performed. Group differences were determined by Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Sidak\u2019s multiple comparison tests."

    "Methods": "Collection and maintenance of patient fibroblasts\nDermal biopsies were collected from consenting patients using established IRB protocols at the University of Miaimi. Fibroblasts were dissociated from tissue using collagenase type II then isolated by filtration (70\u03bcm) and centrifugation (300rcf). Cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO\n2\nin standard tissue culture treated flasks with\nAdvanced\nDMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and human fibroblast growth factor.\n\nsiRNA library screen\nThree siRNAs targeting each of the 263 epigenetic modifier proteins represented in the siRNA library were pooled and utilized at a 90nM final concentration (30nM per siRNA). In a final volume of 60uL, 15,000 cells/well were transfected using 0.2% Lipofectamine 2000. Transfection mixes were prepared in OptiMEM and added to Cell-Bind 384-well plates seeded with HEK293 cells using the reverse-transfection strategy. In order to assess transfection efficiency we utilized a siRNA targeting\nC9ORF72\nand a universal negative control siRNA that has no known target (Ambion). The performance of these experimental controls in the Cells-to-Ct siRNA screen was assessed by\nC9ORF72\nexpression change in wells with the\nC9ORF72\nsiRNA compared to those with the inert negative control siRNA as quantified using two statistical analyses, the student\u2019s t-test (p) and z-test (Z). Efficient transfection and assay performance were considered to be acceptable when p<0.0001 and Z>0.5.\n\nEpigenetic library screen\nWe adapted the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Ambion) by miniaturization in order to utilize the Cells-to-Ct kit for analyzing gene expression in a 384 well format. Patient fibroblasts (15,000 cells in 25\u03bcL volume) were plated on\nCell-Bind\n(Corning) 384 well plates and allowed to adhere and recover overnight. The following day, compound was dissolved in 5\u03bcL of HBSS and applied in a total volume of 30\u03bcL at 10 \u03bcM final concentration then incubated for 48hrs. Gene expression was assessed utilizing the Cell-to-Ct kit and inventoried\nTaqman\n\u2122\nassays for\nC9ORF72\nand the endogenous control, Cyclophilin A. A list of all primers used in the study can be found in\nSupplementary table 5\n. Raw data were collected using the 7900HT real-time-PCR machine.\n\nQPCR assessment of C9ORF72 pre-mRNA\nUsing SYBR green universal master mix (Life Technologies) and primers (\nSupplementary table 5\n) that hybridize within the first intron of\nC9ORF72\nRNA, the unspliced transcript was amplified using RNA purified from 6-well dishes of patient fibroblasts treated with IBET-151 for 48hrs. Trizol (invitrogen) reagent was used for cell lysis and initial isolation of RNA. Following addition of chloroform and centrifugation, the aqueous phase containing RNA was semi-percipitated by adding 1 volume of 80% ethanol and applied to RNeasy columns (Qiagen) with on-column DNase treatment according to the product instructions. Eluents were treated for a second time with DNase in-solution, and then re-purified with the RNeasy mini elute kit (Qiagen). Reverse trascription (RT) was performed using the Qanta Biosciences Supermix containing both oligo-dT and random priming. Inclusion of no-RT controls in QPCR analysis were included to ensure complete removal of genomic DNA as determined by a lack of detectable amplification after 40 cycles.\n\nCell cycle arrest\nFibroblasts were arrested in the G1 phase using a standard double thymidine block protocol\n40\n. Briefly, synchronization was achieved by treating cells with 2mM thymidine for 18 hours, then released by media replacement for 9 hours and blocked again by exposure to drug for 17 hours.\n\nCell viability\nPatient fibroblasts were seeded in white tissue culture treated 384-well plates (20,000 cells/well) and allowed to recover overnight. The following day, cells were treated with drug diluted in HBSS using a 6-point dose response protocol with 1:3 serial dilutions of compound starting at 10 \u03bcM maximum final concentration in quadruplicate wells. Final DMSO concentration was maintained at 0.2% for all wells. After 48 hours, cell viability was assessed using an ATP assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Data were collected using a luminescent detection protocol on the\nEnVision\u00ae Multilabel\nReader (Perkin-Elmer) plate reader platform.\n\nC9ORF72 CpG methylation\nMethylation of cytosine residues within the\nC9ORF72\npromoter was assessed using a methylation-sensitive restriction digest and subsequent QPCR amplification protocol similar to a previous report, but with several modifications\n5\n. Genomic DNA from patient fibroblasts was isolated using the Qiamp mini kit (Qiagen) according to the kit instructions. Restriction digest was performed on 100ng of DNA using 4 units (4U) of the methylation sensitive Hha1 enzyme (NEB) at 37\u00b0C for 90 minutes followed by heat inactivation at 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes. For each sample, a control digest excluding the addition of restriction enzyme was performed (0U) (\nSupplementary figure 6c\n). Restriction digestion products were analyzed by SYBR green QPCR using two primer sets, one set flanked two Hha1 restriction sites (C9me F/R) and another set nearby, that did not flank any Hha1 restriction sites (C9ec F/R) (\nSupplementary figure 6a\n). Normalized relative quantification values (nRQ) were calculated where dCT=C9me-C9ec; ddCT=dCT\ntreatment\n-dCT\ncontrol\n; RQ=2\n\u2212ddCT\n; nRQ=RQ\n4U\n/RQ\n0U\n. Validation of the methylation assessment protocol was performed using pre-mixed calibration standard DNA (EpigenDX Inc.) (\nSupplementary figure 6b\n). Bisulfite pyrosequencing of the C9ORF72 promoter was performed by EpigenDx Inc. using the PSQ\n\u2122\n96HS system and custom designed primers developed by EpigenDx (ADS3232-FS1). The assay covers 8 CpG dinucleotides within the promoter and 5\u2032 untranslated region of C9ORF72 from \u221255 to +19 relative to the transcriptional start site of the human genomic sequence (GRCh38:\nCM000671.2\n/Chr9(\u2212))\n\nChromatin immunoprecipitation\nChromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using standard techniques similar to what was previously reported\n4\n. Briefly, 1 million patient fibroblasts were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature, then quenched with glycine (0.125M) for 5 minutes. Cells were washed in PBS containing protease inhibitors and sonicated 3 times for 5 minutes using the Bioruptor UCD200 (Diagenode, Denville NJ) sonication system set to the high setting. Following centrifugation at 12,000 rcf, and one freeze/thaw cycle, lysates were transferred to a tube containing G-protein Dynabeads (Invitrogen) complexed with an anti-H3K9me3 antibody (Abcam ab8898), or control IgG antibody, and allowed to incubate overnight at 4\u00b0C with rotation. The following day, stringency washes were performed as follows: 2 times in low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X, 2mM EDTA, 20mM Tris-HCL pH 8.1, 150mM NaCl), 1 time in high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% TritonX, 2mM EDTA, 20mM Tris-HCL pH 8.1, 500mM NaCl), one time in lithium chloride buffer (0.25M LiCl, 1% IGEPAL-CA630, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1mM EDTA, 10mM Tris-HCL pH8.1), and two times in TE buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1mM EDTA). Precipitated complexes were resuspended in 150\u03bcL de-crosslinking buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M NaHCO3, 0.2M NaCl) and incubated at 65\u00b0C for 4 hours, followed by the addition of 50\u03bcL proteinase K digestion buffer (final concentration: 0.05M Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 0.1M EDTA, proteinase K) and incubated at 42\u00b0C for 2 hours. De-crosslinked genomic DNA was isolated using the QiaQuick PCR purification kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nMicroarray analysis\nHuman cortical neurons (HCN-2; ATCC) were cultured under conditions similar to those previously described\n70\nin order to promote neuronal maturation. Briefly, six well tissue culture dishes were first prepared by coating with 100 \u03bcg/mL poly-D-lysine (Sigma) for 4 hours at room temperature, followed by an overnight coating at 4\u00b0C with 5 \u03bcg/mL laminin (Cultrex, Trevigen). After washing the plates, HCN-2 neurons were plated at an average density of 160,000 cells/well. The cells were grown at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\nin a defined, serum-free medium\n71\nfreshly supplemented with 5 nM forskolin (Sigma) as well as 50 ng/mL of each of the following neurotrophic factors: BDNF, GDNF, NGF, and CNTF (Peprotech). Twice per week, half the media volume was replaced with fresh media. After 14 days\nin vitro\n, the cells were treated with 1 \u03bcM IBET-151 (Tocris) or vehicle control (0.01% DMSO). RNA was harvested after 24 hours of treatment using a standard phenol:chloroform extraction. Human Gene ST 1.0 Arrays were performed by the Scripps Genomics and Cell Based Screening Core (Jupiter, FL) using standard protocols. Probe set intensities were quantified using GeneChip Command Console (AGCC) and analyzed with RMA normalization using Genome Console software (Affymetrix). HCN-2 cells cultured from separate ATCC stocks at different times were used to generate three replicates each for vehicle controls and IBET-151 treated samples. Genes that exhibited a significant response to IBET-151 treatment were identified using a two-tailed t-test (p<0.05) as well as a 2.0 fold change cutoff. Functional annotations were determined using GeneGo Metacore Pathway Analysis and DAVID Functional Annotation Tool.\n\nGeneration of induced pluripotent stem cells and neuronal differentiation\nPrimary dermal fibroblasts were reprogrammed using a sendai viral vector system to express the Yamanaka factors according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (Cytotune 2.0, Life Technologies). Transduced fibroblasts were seeded onto mouse embryonic fibroblasts and emerging iPSC colonies were subsequently transferred onto feeder-free plates coated with Matrigel\n\u2122\nin mTeSR1\n\u2122\nmedium for at least 10 passages. The expression of pluripotency markers was confirmed by RT-PCR (LIN28 and NANOG) and immunocytochemistry using several antibodies (Oct4, Sox2, NANOG, SSEA4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81; Cell Signalling, cat. 9656S) according to previously published methods\n46\n. The iPSCs were then transferred into flasks coated with Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly-HEMA, Sigma, cat. P3932) and grown in suspension as neurosphere precursor cells using neural stem cell medium consisting of neurobasal medium (Life technologies, cat. 21103-049) supplemented with 2%B27 with no vitamin A (Life technologies, cat. 12587-010), human fibroblast growth factor (bFGF \u2013 100ng/ul), epidermal growth factor (EGF \u2013 100ng/ul, ) and heparin (5ug/ul).\n72\n. Terminal differentiation of motor neurons was carried out for 4 weeks in neuronal differentiation medium consisting of DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1%N2, 2%B27, 1% Non-essential amino acids, heparin 2\u03bcg/ml, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, 0.1\u03bcM Retinoic acid, 1 \u03bcM purmorphamine, 1\u03bcM cAMP, 200ng/ml ascorbic acid (AA), 10ng/ml glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and 10ng/ml brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).\n73\non poly-L-ornithine/laminin coated dishes. To confirm efficient motor neuron differentiation cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with antibodies for Islet-1 (ISL1, Millipore AB4326) and beta III tubulin (TUJ1, Sigma T8578)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal use procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Washington. Mice were housed under a 12-h, light\u2013dark cycle in a temperature-controlled room with food and water available ad libitum. Mice with inactivation of the\nTh\ngene in DAT-expressing neurons (DAT:TH-KO) were generated by crossing mice with two floxed\nTh\nalleles (\nTh\nlox/lox\n) with mice that have one deleted\nTh\nallele (\nTh\n\u0394/+\n) and one allele with Cre recombinase expressed under the control of the Slc6a3 gene encoding DAT (\nSlc6a3\nCre/+\n). DAT:TH-KO mice had the genotype\nTh\n\u0394/lox\n-Slc6a3\nCre/+\nand their littermates with the genotype\nTh\nlox/+\n-Slc6a3\nCre/+\nwere used as wild type (WT) control animals (\nDarvas et al., 2014b\n;\nHenschen et al., 2013\n). Mice with targeted expression of the human DT-receptor (DAT-DTR) were generated by breeding C57Bl/6 mice with mice that have one allele with DTR expressed under the control of the Slc6a3 gene (\nSlc6a3\nDTR/+\n). At the age of 3\u20135 days, all mice from DAT-DTR breeder cages were injected with DT (50 \u00b5g/kg, subcutaneously), which resulted in ablation of DAT-expressing neurons in DAT-DTR mice and had no effect on non-transgenic littermates. DT-injected DAT-DTR mice were used as experimental animals, denoted as DAT-DTR (DT), and DT-injected non-transgenic littermates were used as WT controls. The genetic background for all mice was C57Bl/6J. The number of animals used for each procedure can be found in the figure legends.\n\nDrugs\nDiphtheria toxin (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) was dissolved in saline solution and administered subcutaneously.\nSKF81297\n(Tocris, Minneapolis, MS) and Pramipexole (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were dissolved in saline solution and administered intraperitoneally (i.p.).\n\nBehavioral procedures\nAll behavior experiments were performed on 3- to 5-month-old mice of mixed sexes and all mice were group-housed with no mixing of genders. All experiments were performed in a blinded fashion such that the experimenter was unaware of each animal\u2019s genotype. Each animal was only used once in any of the water-escape based procedures. Novelty-induced locomotor activity, object memory, open-field exploration and all procedures using SKF 81297 and pramipexole were performed using only experimentally na\u00efve animals. Motor behavior testing was performed in animals that were also later tested using water-escape based procedures. For these animals, the time interval between procedures was at least 7 days.\nNovelty locomotion and locomotor\neffects of DA-receptor agonists were determined using static mouse cages (37.2 cm D \u00d7 23.4 cm W \u00d7 14 cm H) with 16 photo cells per side (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Locomotor activity was measured as ambulations (2 consecutive beam interruptions) and summated over a recording period of 90 min. Locomotor activity was recorded on three consecutive days. On each day, animals were first allowed a 30-min habituation period in the behavior testing room to reduce transfer arousal. They were then acclimated to their individual static cages for 90 min to allow them to become accustomed to the novel environment. We used the locomotor activity on the very first day of testing as a measure for novelty induced locomotion. After the 90-min acclimatization period, mice were injected with saline (i.p.) on the first and second day of testing. This procedure served to habituate the animals to the i.p. injection procedure and we used the locomotor activity following saline injection on the second day of testing as an internal reference against which we compared the locomotor effects of the DA-receptor agonists SKF 81297 and pramipexole. On the third day, one group of animals was injected with the D1 DA-receptor agonist SKF 81297 (5 mg/kg i.p.) and another group of animals were injected with the D2/D3 DA-receptor agonist pramipexole (0.5 mg/kg i.p.).\nTurn- and cue-discrimination learning\nwere measured in a water-based, U-shaped maze consisting of a stem with two backward bent arms (one white/one black) where an escape platform, not visible from the end of stem, can be placed (\nDarvas and Palmiter, 2011\n). Mice were trained for 10 trials per day with a 3\u20135 min inter-trial interval (ITI) between trials. The left-right orientation of the white and black arms of the maze was alternated every day in a pseudo-random, non-repetitive sequence so that both arms were equally located on either side of the maze for each daily 10-trial block. One cohort of mice was trained for 3 days to learn a turn direction-based water escape strategy (turn-discrimination) and another independent cohort of mice was trained for 4 days to learn a water escape strategy based on the color of the arms (cue-discrimination). For each day, the percentage of correct trials and latencies to reach the platform were recorded and averaged over all 10 trials. When an animal did not enter the correct arm of the maze, we did not remove it from the maze but allowed it to correct its behavior. We employed this measure because we used water escape to motivate learning in our procedure and removing animals from the maze after a wrong decision would have potentially reinforced that decision. In addition, we were interested in the animals\u2019 ability to correct wrong decisions, which would be reflected in the overall escape latencies. After completion of this procedure, animals were not used for further behavioral testing.\nSpatial learning and memory\nwere measured using a modified version of the Morris water maze procedure (\nDarvas and Palmiter, 2009\n;\nMorris, 1984\n;\nVorhees and Williams, 2006\n). Mice were trained to locate a platform that was submerged in a circular pool (84 cm diameter) filled with opaque water. Outside the pool spatial cues were provided in the behavior-testing area and no cues were present inside the pool. Over a period of 4 days, animals received 4 training trials (with an ITI of 3\u20135 min) in which they were released into different locations of the pool. Each trial ended if the animal reached the submerged platform within 90 s. If the animal failed to reach the platform within 90 s, the experimenter gently guided the animal to the platform. In either case, the animal was allowed to rest on top of the platform for 30 s. All trials were recorded with a camera and analyzed using Ethovision video-tracking software (Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands). Spatial learning was measured as the latency to reach the submerged platform and was averaged over the 4 trials of each training day. In addition, we used Ethovision software to calculate the average swim speed and path length of animals in the Morris maze. After completion of this procedure, animals were only used for testing of spatial memory (see below).\nSpatial memory\nwas measured using animals that were previously trained with our spatial learning procedure: one day after the last training session, mice performed one 90-s probe trial in the Morris maze from which the platform was now removed. Video recordings of the probe trial were analyzed with Ethovision software and spatial memory was scored as the percentage of time spent in the quadrant of the pool where the platform was positioned during training. Spatial memory precision was measured during the probe trial as the average proximity (distance) to the exact location where the platform was positioned during training. After completion of this procedure, animals were not used for further behavioral testing.\nObject memory\nwas assessed with the novel-object recognition test (\nBevins and Besheer, 2006\n;\nDarvas and Palmiter, 2010\n). Animals were first habituated for 15 min to the circular (45 cm diameter) testing apparatus. One day later, mice were allowed to explore the apparatus with two identical objects placed equidistant from the walls for 3 5-min trials with a 5-min ITI. On the following day, one of the original objects was replaced with a novel object and mice were allowed to explore the apparatus for 15 min. Time spent investigating both the original and novel object during that session was measured and scored as the time when mice made direct contact with an object. Accidental or incidental contacts made by the animals were not counted. Object memory was measured as the preference for the novel object over the original object during exploration of both objects.\nAnxiety-related behavior (open field exploration)\nwas determined by analyzing the exploratory behavior of animals during the first 10 minutes of the habituation procedure for the novel-object recognition test, and by testing independent cohorts of experimentally naive mice for 10 minutes in the same experimental apparatus. Video recordings were analyzed with Ethovision software and the time spent in the center area and periphery of the circular testing apparatus was calculated. Anxiety was scored as the time spent in the center area of the apparatus.\nMotor coordination\n. Learning-independent motor coordination was measured using the beam-walk test. Mice traversed a 60 cm cylindrical rod (15 mm in diameter) that was elevated 30 cm above a cushioned table and the number of slips was recorded. The test was performed once. Mice that fell were placed back on the beam at the position where they fell and allowed to continue.\nMotor-skill learning\n. Latency to fall from a rotating rotarod (Rotamex 4/8 system, Columbus Instruments) was recorded over 3 consecutive days with 4 trials per day and an ITI of 10 min. For each trial, mice were placed on the rotating rod, which began at 4 rpm and accelerated to 40 rpm over the course of 5 min.\n\nQuantification of DAT and DA\nBrains were collected 10\u201315 days after the last behavior test was finished. For quantification of DAT content in the midbrain, we dissected the SNpc, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and for quantification of DAT content in the striatum, we collected tissue punches from the dorsal and ventral regions of the striatum, as well as whole cerebellum samples to use as a negative control. Tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Protein extractions from dissected tissue and quantification of DAT by ELISA were performed as previously described (\nDarvas et al., 2014a\n). In short, Samples were homogenized in RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing Complete Mini protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), centrifuged at 1,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min and the supernatants were collected for further analysis. After determining the protein concentration in the supernatant, using a bicinchoninic assay (Thermo Scientific), DA-transporter expression was quantified by ELISA. Wells of a 96-well plate were coated with monoclonal rat anti DA-transporter antibody (1:500, Abcam), washed, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, washed and then incubated with 20 \u00b5g total protein. Then wells were washed, incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti DA-transporter antibody (1:20,000, Abcam), washed and incubated with a horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated, donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch). After another wash samples were incubated with TMB solution (R & D Systems). The resulting color reaction was stopped by addition of 2N sulfuric acid and then absorption at 450 nm was measured. DA content was measured in tissue punches (1 mm diameter, 2 mm thick) that were obtained from the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus and striatum. Tissue punches were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. HPLC coupled with electrochemical detection was used to measure DA content in tissue punches from all brain regions. We also measured 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and norepinephrine levels in striatal tissue punches.\n\nStatistical analyses\nAll tests that involve multiple trials/groups were analyzed by appropriate analysis of variance (ANOVA, one-way or 2-way) or 2-way repeated measures (RM) ANOVA. Significant effects were further analyzed with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. All statistical testing was performed with GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Any group differences with an alpha of 0.05 or less were considered significant."

All surgical procedures and animal maintenance complied with the National Institute of Health guidelines regarding the care and use of experimental animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.\nLentivirus vectors\nAll lentivirus used pBOB lentiviral expression vector (with CMV enhanced Chicken b-actin (CAG) promoter (Addgene, plasmid 12337; Marr et al., 2003). To generate lentivirus expressing either NGF (\nRomero et al., 2000\n), rat artemin (Origene, RN209126), rat GFR-alpha 3 (Origene, RR200905), GDNF or rat GFR-alpha1 were subcloned into the pBOB CAG vector and plasmids purified and sequenced. The coding regions of alternatively- spliced form of rat GDNF (GDNF555, NCBI reference #\nS75585.1\n) and rat GFR\u03b11 (NCBI reference #\nNM_012959\n) were kindly supplied by Amgen. The transgene plasmid along with the lentivirus packaging plasmids (pVSVG, pMDL and pRev) were transfected into 293T human embryonic kidney cells using calcium phosphate method. Accumulated viral particles from the supernatant were purified by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation to produce high titer\nin vivo\nquality lentivirus. Virus was resuspended in a Tris buffer containing rat serum albumin and mannitol. The virus was frozen in 10\u03bcL aliquots at \u221280\u00b0C. Before using the virus for\nin vivo\nexperiments, the titer was determined using p24 ELISA (Zeptometrix corporation) and tested for expression by either by ELISA (NGF) or Western blot analysis (artemin and GFR\u03b13). NGF ELISA was performed using the ELISA kit (Promega) following the manufacturers protocol. Artemin and NGF have flag tags and GFR\u03b13 has a myc tag. The production of exogenous artemin and GFR\u03b13 was confirmed by probing Western blots for flag (anti-M2 flag (1:1000), Sigma) and myc antibody (9E10 (1:1000), Cell Center, UPENN), respectively. GFR\u03b11 protein expression was confirmed\nin vitro\nusing Western blot analysis of lysate and supernatant of infected 293T cells (GFR\u03b11 antibody (1:1000), R&D systems).\n\nSurgical procedures\nDorsal root crush injury and spinal cord injection\nAnimals were deeply anesthetized by i.p. injections of a 2:1 mixture of ketamine (67mg/kg) and xylazine (6.7mg/kg). The dorsumof each animal was clipped and disinfected with povidone-iodine before opening the skin and fascia. A hemilaminectomy was performed under aseptic conditions at the T13-L2 vertebral segments and the dura was opened with fine scissors. After topical application of lidocaine, dorsal roots L3\u2013L6 were identified and exposed. With the use of #5 Dumont forceps, triple-crush lesions, 10 seconds each, were inflicted at two sites separated by 3mm along the L4 and L5 afferents at 5\u20138 mm from the DREZ. In previous studies by our group we observed some axon sparing if crushes were done at only a single site (\nRomero et al., 2001\n). Dorsal roots L3 and L6 were tightly ligated at two regions, 1\u20132 mm apart with 6.0 silk sutures and then a complete cut was made through these roots to create a zone of denervation immediately rostral and caudal to L4/L5. All lesions were performed unilaterally on the right side. The spinal cord at T13-L1 was exposed to identify the L4/L5 DREZ. The anesthetized animals were held in place using a spinal clamp at levels rostral and caudal to laminectomy in order to facilitate spinal cord injections without the hindrance of respiratory movements. Eight injections of 0.3 \u03bcl lentivirus (a total of 1\u00d710\n7\nviral particles) spaced 0.5 mm apart were given rostro-caudally along the L4/L5 DREZ using a beveled glass micropipette pulled to a diameter of between 30 and 50 \u03bcm. Injections were made at a rate of 5 nl/sec using a nano-injector (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) at a precise depth of 0.7 mm from the spinal cord dorsal surface using the coordinates on a M3301 fine micromanipulator (Narishige via World Precision Instruments). After completion of each injection, the needle remained in place for five minutes before retracting. Gelfoam soaked in sterile saline was laid on the top of the exposed spinal cord and the muscle layer was closed using chromic gut sutures followed by skin closure using surgical clips. Liquid bandage (New Skin) was applied to the right paw to help prevent autotomy which sometimes occurred. Animals showing autotomy, which included partial loss of 2 toes or inflammation of the hindpaw, were removed from the study and not included in results or animal numbers. The animals were maintained on a heated pad until complete recovery from anesthesia. Buprenorphine was administered intramuscularly (0.05 mg/kg) following surgery to help alleviate pain and discomfort.\nInjections to Dorsal root ganglia\nIn animals under anesthesia, a 3cm skin incision was made on the dorsal midline starting from the superior iliac crest and extending in the rostral direction. The superior muscular fascia was incised and the paraspinal muscles were separated by blunt dissection exposing the midline and the lateral aspect of L4, L5 and L6 vertebra. Exposure was maintained using custom retractors. A partial laminectomy was performed on the right half of L4-L6 vertebra to remove part of the posterior articular processes and expose the L4/L5 DRGs. Replication deficient lentivirus encoding either NGF or Artemin was injected into L4/L5 DRGs using a micropipette pulled to a diameter of 0.05mm and a microinjector. The viruses were injected 1 weeks before the L4/L5 dorsal root crush. For each injection, micropipette was introduced 0.3\u20130.5 mm into the DRGs and a total volume of lentivirus (about 2\u20133 \u03bcL) containing 1\u00d710\n7\ntransducing units/\u03bcL was injected over a 10 minute injection period. The glass needle was left in place for 5 minutes after each injection.\nSciatic nerve injections\nTo identify regeneration of large caliber myelinated axons, a 2% solution of Alexa Fluor labeled (594) cholera toxin B (CTB) (Invitrogen) in PBS was injected into all animals 7\u201310 days prior to sacrifice. For these studies a small incision was made in the skin along the posterior thigh to expose the gluteus muscle. The muscle was separated to expose the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve was injected with 2\u20133 \u03bcl of 2% cholera toxin B subunit using a Hamilton syringe with a 30 gauge needle. Sciatic nerve was not crushed for these studies.\n\nBehavioral analysis\nAll the animals in the study were subjected to behavioral analysis before the injury to assess the baseline and after the injury to assess the behavioral changes or behavioral improvement. We evaluated functional recovery employing four different behavioral assays at 10 day intervals; thermal nociceptive recovery, paw pressure assessment, Gridwalk test and test for allodynia using von Frey hairs. All the behavioral tests, except for thermal nociception, were performed on the same day and the thermal test was performed the following day. All the behavioral tests were performed and scored by a student blinded to the treatments.\nThe latency of paw withdrawal from a radiant heat source was used to measure the response time to noxious thermal stimuli, as described previously (\nHargreaves et al., 1988\n;\nTang et al., 2007\n). Paw withdrawal latencies (PWL) for each hindpaw were determined prior to (baselines) and once every 10 days following dorsal root crush and lentivirus injection. Briefly, the rats were placed in a clear plastic chamber with a glass floor and allowed to acclimate for 10 min. A halogen lamp beneath the glass surface is used to direct an intense light beam onto the plantar surface of the hind paw. Thermal intensities of 50% of the maximum power output of the lamp were tested for the entire duration of the experiment. This intensity was chosen based on preliminary studies to give baseline responses of approximately 10 seconds in normal animals. Paw withdrawal latency was detected automatically by a photocell and taken as a behavioral index of the pain threshold. A maximum exposure time of 22 sec was used as a cut off to ensure that no tissue damage occurred to the paw. Measurements in triplicate were taken, by an individual blinded to the treatment, from both the left and right hind paw and the ratio of the PWL of the right to left paw was calculated. Pre-injury baseline ratios were close to 1, as the right and left PWL are similar. Right side L4/L5 crush increased PWL close to the cut off value and raising the ratio to a value closer to 2. As regeneration progresses, this ratio trended towards the baseline value of 1. A ratio significantly lower than the baseline ratio is represented as hyperalgesia.\n\nMechanical Hyperalgesia\nThe paw pressure test was used to measure mechanical hyperalgesia, as described by Randall and Selitto (\nRandall and Selitto, 1957\n). Briefly, animals were restrained in a mitt such that the hind paws could hang free. Each paw, in turn, was placed between the apparatus surface of an Ugo-Basil Analgesymeter and a plastic point. Increasing weight was applied to the point by means of an attached metal disc. Pressure to the paw was applied at thirty two grams per second. The end point was designated as vocalization or the pulling of the hind paw from the apparatus, with a cutoff of 200 grams. Responses were recorded three times for each hind paw.\n\nGridwalk test\nA custom made horizontal ladder with irregularly spaced rungs was used to test for proprioception. Animals were trained to walk on the horizontal ladder before they were subjected to any surgery. The percent efficiency in the right hindlimb was evaluated as a measure of proprioception. Before surgery, trained animals showed almost 100% efficiency in the right hindlimb (no errors). Immediate post-crush evaluation showed a tremendous increase in foot faults or errors on the ipsilateral (right) side of lesion, causing a drop in placement efficiency. Improvement in proprioception is expected to increase the placement efficiency in the right hind limb.\nTouch sensitivity\nSensitivity to mechanical stimuli was tested using von Frey hair (VFH; North Coast Medical, Morgan Hill, CA) applied to the mid-plantar region of the hindpaws, following an up-and-down profile (\nDixon, 1980\n;\nChaplan et al., 1994\n). Animals were placed on a wire mesh floor and fruit cereals were provided during this behavioral testing. Measurements were taken only when the animals were eating cereals so as to rule out visual responses from seeing the presentation of monofilament (Touch Test, North Coast Medical, Gilroy, CA). Presentation of the monofilament was started from 4.93 (8 grams) and ended at 6.10 (100 grams) if there was no response. Each monofilament was applied in a smooth and steady manner over a two second period until it bends. The filament was then removed in a smooth and steady manner. This single touch constituted one single trial. A positive response was indicated by the quick lifting of the paw away from the monofilament before the monofilament was removed. If there was no response, the next higher monofilament was presented after 30 seconds to prevent adaptation. If there was a response, the next lower filament was used to determine a response. This up and down procedure for systematically applying higher or lower monofilaments based on positive or negative responses was used until we had 10 trials per paw. If there was no response at 6.10 monofilament, the same was applied again and if there was no response at 6.10, threshold was denoted as 6.45. Otherwise, threshold value is the lowest monofilament level at which 50% or more of the trials were positive and there were at least 3 trials at each threshold level. The values used for data processing were the gram force values corresponding to each filament number. Mechanical sensitivity was represented as 50% response threshold for VFH stimulus (g) to the left (normal side) and right (lesion side) hind paw of rats. As we did not observe any change in mechanical sensitivity in any of the groups, only data from the right hind paw are plotted.\n\nFos Stimulation\nAnimals were anesthetized with 1.5 g/kg urethane i.p., a dose known to block flexor-reflex responses to hindpaw stimulation ~15 min after injection (\nTrafton et al., 1999\n). For Fos induction, the right hindpaw was submerged in water heated to 52\u00b0C for 2 min and the interdigital space pinched for 15 seconds to stimulate CGRP\n+\nand IB4\n+\naxons respectively. The animals were placed on a heating pad for 90 min before perfusion.\n\nHistology\nEight weeks after the injury and spinal cord injection of lentivirus, anesthetized animals were perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Lumbar spinal cord and DRGs were isolated and incubated in the same fixative for approximately 24 hours. The tissue was then cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in 0.1M phosphate buffer at 4\u00b0C for another 2 days. 30 \u03bcm sections from lumbar spinal cord were cut on a cryostat and floating sections were collected. For immunoperoxidase staining, spinal cord sections were incubated with 1 to 20,000 dilution of anti-rat CGRP (Sigma, St.Louis, MO), 1 to 1000 dilution of biotinylated anti-IB4 (Sigma) or 1 to 10,000 dilution of the cFos antibody (Calbiochem, cat# PC38). Visualization was achieved by incubating sections in biotinylated secondary antibody (except for IB4 as it is already biotinylated) followed by vectastain Elite ABC reagents (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and developed using the peroxidase substrate, 3,3-diaminobenzidine to generate brown color. For enhancing the fluorescence signal for Alexa 594 labeled CTB, the sections were incubated with rabbit anti-CTB (1to 500) (Sigma) for 2 h and further with goat anti rabbit alexa 594 (Invitrogen) for 2 h. After staining, sections were mounted on glass slides and coverslipped with either permount (immunoperoxidase stained sections) or fluoromount G (immunofluorescence sections) (Southern Biotech).\n\nMicroscopy and Image analysis\nImages from immunoperoxidase stained sections were captured using bright field microscopy and fluorescent images from GFP injected animals using FITC filter (Nikon 80i). To quantify axon growth in different laminas of the spinal cord, 5\u20136 sections within L4/L5 spinal cord were selected randomly from each animal. Outlines of the laminas I-VI were drawn from a representative spinal cord image (\nTang et al., 2007\n) and these outlines were used as a template and applied to appropriate locations in different spinal cord images by a technician blinded to experimental conditions. CGRP\n+\naxon occupying area was quantified within the outline of each lamina using a macro that applied a standardized optical density threshold to each image and measured the area of staining equal to or greater than the threshold. IB4\n+\naxon occupying area was quantified as the total area occupied by these axons in the spinal cord. The program gave the area measurements in \u03bcm\n2\n. cFos images captured at 10x was used for cFos counting. cFos activated neurons were counted manually applying the same lamina outline. cFos counts in laminae I & II were quantified as superficial dorsal horn cFos counts and laminae III-VI were counted as deep dorsal horn cFos counts. All quantification of images were performed by a trained student who was unaware of the individual treatments.\n\nLaser scanning confocal microscopy for CTB labeled axons\nImages from CTB labeled sections were acquired using confocal microscopy (Nikon C2). Z stacked images were acquired at 564 nm. Images were captured at both 10x and 20x magnifications to allow a clear representation of regenerating axons. CTB axon occupying area was quantified as the total area occupied in the ipsilateral side using thresholded intensity measurements.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData from the image analysis of CGRP\n+\naxon density and Fos-IR nuclei were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer\npost hoc\ntest to determine significant differences between groups. Data from regenerating IB4\n+\naxons were analyzed using One-Way ANOVA and CTB labeled axons were analyzed by non-parametric test (Kruskal-Wallis test) followed by multiple comparison tests of mean ranks of the groups. Data from behavioral assessments were analyzed using one way ANOVA followed by Tukey/Dunnett\u2019s\npost hoc\ntest to determine significant differences between groups. Data represent the mean \u00b1SEM. P values below the 5% probability level were considered significant."

    "Methods": "Cell culture\nAstrocytes\nSpinal cords from one to three days old Sprague Dawley rats were used to prepare astrocytes as described previously (\nPeluffo et al., 1997\n;\nSaneto and Vellis, 1987\n). Once confluent (approximately 5-8 days), cells were shaken at 300 RPM for 2 days then treated with 10 \u03bcM arabinose C. Following a couple days recovery, cells were split and seeded on a 60mm dish at a density of one million cells or half a million for a 35mm dish. Cells were maintained in culture for no more than 22 days.\nMotor neurons\nRat embryo motor neurons were purified using 6% OPTI prep and further purified using immunoaffinity. Cells were cultured in neurobasal medium containing glutamine, glutamate, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and B27 supplement (Gibco-Invitrogen) as previously described (\nEstevez et al., 1998\n;\nPettmann and Henderson, 1998\n;\nRaoul et al., 1999\n) in the presence or absence of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, 1 ng/mL), glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF, 0.1 ng/mL), and cardiotrophin 1 (CT-1, 10 ng/mL). Motor neuron survival was determined by counting by hand in four well plates (Nunc) or by calcein staining (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Extracellular calcein was quenched with 100 \u03bcg/mL hemoglobin and the images were captured using the RUNNER (Trophos, Marseilles, France). Data was analyzed using Tina software (Trophos).\nSchwann Cells\nPrimary Schwann cells were isolated from the sciatic nerves of newborn Sprague Dawley rats with modifications as previously described (\nBrockes et al., 1979\n;\nThaxton et al., 2011\n). 250,000 cells (35 mm dish) or 500,000 cells (60 mm dish) were grown in D10M (10% FBS, 20 \u03bcg/ml pituitary extracts and 2\u03bcM forskolin in DMEM) on poly-L-lysine coated plates (200 \u03bcg/mL) until confluency. Media was changed three days before the experiment was started. Experiments were conducted on Schwann cells that were passaged no more than four times.\n\nConditioned Media\nAstrocytes or Schwann cells were treated with 1 \u03bcM riluzole for indicated time period. For chronic treatments, media was changed with fresh riluzole every 2-3 days. Media was removed and cells were washed with DPBS prior to addition of conditioning media (L15 supplemented with sodium bicarbonate (22 mM), conalbumin (0.1 mg/ml), putrescine (0.1 mM), insulin (5 \u03bcg/ml), and sodium selenite (31 nM). Astrocytes or Schwann cells conditioned this media for 24 hours prior to collection. Conditioned media was further diluted in motor neuron media prior to plating motor neurons. Motor neurons were cultured in the presence of conditioned media for three days then counted.\n\nPCR Analysis\nRNA was extracted from Schwann cells plated on a 35mm dish using Trizol. 1 \u03bcg RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction. 2 \u03bcl of cDNA product was used as template for qPCR analysis. CT-1, BDNF, and GDNF levels were measured using Taq Man probes and master mix according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction.\n\nAnimal Studies\nMale C57BL/6J mice were given riluzole treated water (100 \u03bcg/ml) for given time points. Water was replaced with freshly prepared riluzole every 2-3 days. Brain, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve were removed for subsequent analysis. Untreated mice were sacrificed for control.\n\nELISA\nBrain, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve were homogenized in PBS containing PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail. Samples were diluted to a concentration of 175 \u03bcg/mL and analyzed using ELISA [CT-1 (R & D Systems), BDNF and GDNF (Abnova)]. ELISA was preformed according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions."

    "Methods": "Animals\nFemale Sprague-Dawley rats (225\u2013250g) were obtained from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NJ) and were housed 3 per cage with a 12h light/dark cycle. Food and water were available\nad libitum.\nAll procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Drexel University College of Medicine and were carried out according to the\nNIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nSurgical procedure\nNineteen rats received a minimal contusion using a 50 kilodyne (kdyn) force by the IH impactor and were divided into two groups three weeks post-injury, after complete recovery (defined as an average BBB score around 21): animals that received one contusion (C1; n=9), and animals that received a second contusion (C2; n=10).\nRats received a mixture of XAK containing Xylazine (10 mg/ml), Acepromazine maleate (0.7 mg/kg), and Ketamine (95 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally (i.p., volume/rat = body weight/rat \u00d7 0.00108 ml). The skin over the upper cervical area was shaved and cleaned with betadine solution and 70% ethanol. The skin and muscles were incised to exposure the fifth cervical vertebral body (C5). A laminectomy was performed at C5, and a contusion was made on the right side of the cord with the IH impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Lexington, KY). Dwell time was set to 0 seconds. The IH device was set to deliver a force of 50kydn. Following injury, the muscle and skin were closed in layers. Three weeks after contusion, animals were re-anesthetized with XAK and divided into two groups: C1: control animals where the lesion site was reopened, and C2: experimental animals where the lesion was re-opened and delivered the same minimal contusion (50kdyn) as in the first injury at the same location (C5). Rats were placed back in their cages with heating pads and closely observed until they awoke. Buprenex (0.015\u20130.02mg/kg, 0.3mg/ml, Reckitt Benckiser, Richmond, VA) was administered subcutaneously post-surgery and once a day after surgery for one day.\n\nEvaluation of motor and sensory function\nBaseline values for all behavior tests were acquired prior to the first surgery. All animals were then tested weekly.\nOpen-field locomotion (BBB)\nThe rats were placed in an enclosure and scored by two blinded observers according to the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) rating scale (\nBasso et al., 1995\n). The test was performed prior to the initial contusion to establish a baseline, 2\u20133 days after 1\nst\nand 2\nnd\nsurgery, and once a week after surgery until the end of the experiment.\nPaw Placement Test (Cylinder test)\nThe rats were placed into a Plexiglas cylinder (17.8cm by 35.5cm). A mirror placed behind the cylinder allowed for observation of all movements. The test was video-recorded and the numbers of exploratory paw placements making contact with the cylinder were counted and categorized as left, right, or both paws. The score was expressed as a percentage of use of the affected limb (% of paw placements of the affected limb (right) + half of the % of both paws placements divided by the total number of paw placements) (\nLiu et al., 1999\n;\nShumsky et al., 2003\n).\nCatWalk\n\u2122\ngait analysis\nAnimals crossed a Plexiglas floor walkway, which allowed for the visualization of foot contacts, and a high-speed camera recorded each of the animal runs in a dark room (\nHamers et al., 2006\n;\nHamers et al., 2001\n). Locomotion and gait was analyzed using CatWalk\n\u2122\nsoftware NXT 10.5 (Noldus Information Technologies). Animals were pre-trained for 5 days prior to the first surgery and tested once a week until the end of the experiment. Base of support, step sequence, phase dispersion, swing, stance, duty cycle were analyzed for locomotion changes. Mean intensity mean, maximum intensity mean, and maximum contact intensity were analyzed to describe sensory changes in all 4 limbs (\nVrinten and Hamers, 2003\n).\nVon Frey\nThe up-down method (\nDetloff et al., 2010\n;\nDetloff et al., 2012\n) for Von Frey hair (VFH) monofilaments (VFH, Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) was used to measure the degree of tactile sensory changes after minimal contusion. A total of 10 VFH stimulus applications were collected for each hind paw (\nDetloff et al., 2013\n). The response threshold was the lowest force (in grams) that produced a paw withdrawal in at least 50% of the applications. Paw testing order was determined randomly to minimize an order effect.\n\nTissue preparation\nAnimals were anesthetized with i.p. injection of sodium pentobarbital (100mg/kg, Abbot Laboratories, Chicago, IL) and transcardially perfused with 100ml saline followed by 500ml of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde fixative in phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4). A 30mm long segment including the lesion area was dissected. Tissues were post-fixed in the same fixative for 2\u20133 days and then transferred into a solution of 30% sucrose in 0.1M PB for 3\u20135 days. Spinal cord segments were embedded in M1 mounting medium (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), and cut into 20\u03bcm coronal sections on a cryostat, and mounted onto gelatin-coated slides in 10 serial sets. After harvesting the first 20\u03bcm section, the subsequent four sections were discarded, prior to harvesting another section, making the interval between sections on the same slide 1mm.\n\nHistology and Immunocytochemistry\nSpinal cord sections were processed for Nissl/myelin staining. Immunocytochemistry was performed with antibodies against ED1, for macrophages, GFAP, for reactive astrocytes, PKC\u03b3, for corticospinal tract axons, and RECA1, for blood vessels. Spinal cord sections were washed three times in PBS and blocked with 5% goat serum for 1h. Primary antibodies were incubated with 5% goat serum in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 at room temperature overnight. Species-specific secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit conjugated to FITC or rhodamine, 1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) were applied for 2h at room temperature, and the slides were cover-slipped with anti-fade Dapi-Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL). Fluorescently stained slides were stored at 4\u00b0C.\n\nMeasurement of spared tissue and cyst volume\nThe volume of spared tissue, lesion, and cystic cavities were assessed in a blinded fashion using Stereo Investigator in coronal Nissl/myelin stained sections, similar to our previous study (\nJin et al., 2014\n). For each animal, every 10th cryostat section (1mm interval) was used to determine the total volume of a 18mm long segment centered at the contusion epicenter and the spared tissue within this segment. Tissue was considered spared if areas contained healthy-looking spinal neurons and myelin, and lacked cysts. Conversely, tissue with unhealthy-looking neurons and demyelination, without cavities, was counted as lesion. Cyst volumes were determined as cavities within the lesion area. Using Stereo Investigator, spared tissue (including white and grey matter) and cysts can be marked with different colors on each section. The system then calculates the total volume and provides the fraction of each part for each animal. Data were presented as percentages of total cord volume for spared white and grey matter, lesion volume, and cyst volume. Lesion area was also obtained using Stereo Investigator and presented as millimeter distance in the rostral and caudal direction from lesion epicenter. Lesion volume and lesion area were calculated without including cavity volume or area, respectively.\n\nAnalysis of distribution of ED1, GFAP, PKC\u03b3, and RECA1 positive staining\nFor analysis of ED1, GFAP, PKC\u03b3, and RECA1 staining, images from the lesion epicenter and 3mm, 6mm, and 9mm rostral and caudal to the lesion epicenter were taken using a DC- 330 CCD color video camera (DAGE-MTI, Inc., Michigan City, IN) attached to a Leica DMRBE microscope (Leica Microsystems; Bannockburn, IL) with a 10X objective. Images were converted using NIH Image J software to grayscale. In each image, a standard sized rectangle was overlaid on the dorsal column and ventral white matter. A standard sized oval was overlaid on the lateral white matter. The illumination intensity was held constant throughout the analysis of the images for all groups. The labeled areas within the rectangle or oval were measured, and presented as a percentage of the respective area.\n\nStatistical analysis\nA two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing 1 contusion versus 2 contusions over time, with time taken as a repeated measure, was used to analyze the behavioral data. Significance set at p < 0.05. Post-hoc analysis was performed using the Bonferroni test. One-way ANOVA was used for analysis of spared tissue, lesion volume, and cyst volume. Student independent unpaired\nt\n-test was used for distribution of ED1, GFAP, PKC\u03b3, and RECA1."

    "Methods": "All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. Female, 4-week-old piglets (8\u201310 kg), which have comparable neurodevelopment to a human toddler, were used for the study (Armstead, 2005;Duhaime, 2006). Females were chosen to limit heterogeneity between genders based on prior work (Missios et al., 2009). Sixteen piglets were designated into a injury cohort and corresponding sham group: controlled cortical impact (CCI) at the rostal gyrus (n = 10 injured-CCI, n = 6 na\u00efve shams-CCI). Injured animals were sacrificed 24 h after CCI.\n\n2.1. Animal preparation\nPiglets were premedicated with an intramuscular injection of ketamine (20 mg/kg) and xylazine (2 mg/kg) followed by 4% inhaled isoflurane in 1.0 fraction of inspired oxygen via snout mask, until abolishment of response to a reflexive pinch stimulus. Endotracheal intubation was followed by a decrease in fraction of inspired oxygen to 0.21 and maintenance of anesthesia with 1% inhaled isoflurane. Buprenorphine (0.02 mg/kg) was delivered intramuscularly for analgesia prior to injury. Using a heating pad, core body temperature was keptconstant between 36 and 38 \u00b0C and monitored via a rectal probe. Non-invasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate, and end-tidal CO\n2\nwere continuously monitored throughout the experiment (VetCap model 2050081; SDI, Waukesha, WI). If necessary, mechanical ventilation was utilized to maintain normoxia and normocarbia before injury, otherwise piglets maintained spontaneous ventilation.\n\n2.2. Controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury\nWhile maintained on isoflurane, the vertex of the head was clipped and prepped with chlorhexidine solution. After infiltration of a local anesthetic (1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1/100,000), the right coronal suture was exposed, and a craniectomy performed over the rostral gyrus allowing a 1 cm margin around the indenter tip of the cortical impact device described previously (\nDuhaime et al., 2000a\n). The exposed dura was opened in a stellate fashion to reveal the cortical surface, and the device was stabilized against the skull with screws. The spring-loaded tip rapidly (4 ms) indented 0.63 cm of the cortical rostral gyrus (\nDuhaime et al., 2000a\n). The device was removed, the dura re-approximated, and the surgical flap sutured closed. After emergence from isoflurane, piglets were extubated when they met the following criteria: return of pinch reflex, spontaneously breathing and able to maintain oxygenation and ventilation, normotensive, and stable heart and respiratory rate. Following extubation, animals displayed initial depressed activity and gait instability, but apnea and hypotension were never observed after CCI. Animals were recovered and returned to the animal housing facility when they met the following criteria: vocalization without squealing, able to ambulate, devoid of aggression or avoidance behavior, absence of piloerection, and proper feeding and drinking behaviors. Animals were more hypoactive and spent more time recumbent than non-injured littermates following injury, but were able to drink and eat unassisted. These injuries are best described as mild-to-moderate in severity, based on parallels with human clinical severity classifications (\nAdelson et al., 2012\n;\nMiller et al., 2012\n).\n\n2.3. Sample acquisition for mitochondrial assessments\nAt 24 h post-TBI, animals were re-anesthetized with 1% isoflurane. A bilateral craniectomy was performed to expose the brain, tissue was rapidly extracted from two locations of interest from the injury cohort and shams while simultaneously receiving a pentobarbital overdose. Locations of interest, included: a 2 cm\n2\nregion of cortex of visibly viable tissue was resected immediately adjacent to the rostral edge of the contusion, along with a mirrored corresponding 2 cm\n2\nregion from the contralateral hemisphere. Tissue was removed within seconds, and placed in ice-cold isolation buffer (320 mM sucrose, 10 mM Trizma base, and 2 mM EGTA), where the blood and blood vessels, as well as, any adherent necrotic tissue from the contused area were dissected and disposed. In addition, subcortical white matter was removed from the cortex. Following dissection tissue was placed on drying paper to absorb excess buffer and weighed. Tissue was then gently homogenized on ice in MiR05 (110 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM EGTA, 3.0 mM MgCl\n2\n, 60 mM K-lactobionate, 10 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 20 mM taurine, 20 mM HEPES and 1.0 g/l fatty acid-free BSA) using a 5 ml Potter\u2013Elvehjem teflon-glass homogenizer to a concentration of 1 mg wet weight tissue/10 \u03bcl MiR05 buffer.\n\n2.4. Mitochondrial high-resolution respirometry (HRR)\nA final concentration of tissue homogenate with MiR05 analyzed was 1 mg/ml at a constant 37 \u00b0C, and the rate of oxygen consumption was measured utilizing a high-resolution oxygraph and expressed in pmols / [s * mg of tissue homogenate], (OROBOROS, Oxygraph-2 k and DatLab software all from OROBOROS Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria). All experiments were performed between 75 and 220 \u03bcM of oxygen, and re-oxygenation was performed routinely prior to addition of the complex IV electron donor described below. The oxygraph was calibrated daily, and oxygen concentration was automatically calculated from barometric pressure and MiR05 oxygen solubility factor set at 0.92 relative to pure water.\nA substrate, uncoupler, inhibitor titration (SUIT) protocol previously used for rodent brain tissue (\nKarlsson et al., 2013\n) was further developed and optimized in preliminary studies in porcine brain tissue. Sequential additions were used to acquire a detailed representation of mitochondrial respiration (\nFigs. 1a and b\n). Respiratory capacities with electron flow through both complex I (CI) and complex II (CII) were evaluated separately as well as the convergent electron input through the Q-junction (CI + II) using succinate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-linked substrates (\nGnaiger, 2009\n). Plasma membranes were permeabilized with the detergent digitonin to allow non-membrane permeable substrates and ADP access to the subpopulations of mitochondria trapped within synaptosomes. Furthermore, in order to achieve similar results in brain tissue homogenates and isolated brain mitochondria, with a combination of both sub-populations, Pecinova and colleagues demonstrated that digitonin is necessary in brain homogenate preparations (\nPecinova et al., 2011\n;\nSims and Blass, 1986\n). Without the addition of digitonin oxidative phosphorylation capacity would likely be greatly underestimated. Thus, in preliminary experiments a careful digitonin dose titration was completed, in the presence of exogenously administered cytochrome c, which did not induce any significant effect on respiration with the digitonin dose used in the present study, indicating intact integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane (data not shown). Routine mitochondrial respiration was established by the concomitant addition of malate (5 mM) and pyruvate (5 mM), followed by ADP (1 mM) and glutamate (5 mM), to measure the oxidative phosphorylation capacity of complex I (OXPHOS\nCI\n), driven by the NADH-related substrates. Sequential addi tions followed. Succinate (10 mM) was added to stimulate maximal phosphorylating respiration capacity via convergent input through complexes I and II (OXPHOS\nCI + CII\n). Oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATP-synthase, induced mitochondrial respiration independent of ATP production across the inner mitochondrial membrane, commonly referred to as LEAK respiration (LEAK\nCI + CII\n) or State 4\n0\n. Maximal convergent non-phosphorylating respiration of the electron transport system (ETS\nCI + CII)\nwas evaluated by titrating the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP) until no further increase in respiration was detected. Rotenone inhibited complex I-driven respiration and revealed complex II-driven respiration, the ETS capacity through complex II alone (ETS\nCII\n). The complex III inhibitor antimycin-A (1 \u03bcg/ml) was added to measure the residual oxygen consumption (ROX) that is independent of the ETS. Therefore, residual value measured with antimycin-A was subtracted from each of the measured respiratory states to report ETS function devoid of ROX. Antimycin-A was chosen to measure ROX, so that in this sequential protocol, complex IV activity could also be measured at the end of the protocol. Finally, complex IV activity was determined by the addition of ascorbate (ASC, 0.8 mM) and N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD, 0.5 mM), an electron donor to complex IV. Due to the high level of auto-oxidation of TMPD, the complex IV-inhibitor sodium azide (10 mM) was added and the remaining chemical background was subtracted from the ascorbate/TMPD-induced oxygen consumption to assess complex IV activity. Integrated ETS analysis with internal normalization was generated using flux control ratios (FCR) calculated by dividing each respiratory state by the maximal, uncoupled mitochondrial respiration (ETS\nCI + CII\n).\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nGraphical representation of the substrate, uncoupler, inhibitor titration (SUIT) protocol used to study the integrated function of individual components of the electron transport system (ETS). Induced respiratory states and respiratory complexes activated are outlined by boxes: ROX, residual oxygen consumption due to non-mitochondrial respiration induced by the inhibition of the complex III by antimycin A; ETS (ETS\nCI + CII\n), respiration that is uncoupled capacity from ATP synthase induced by the optimum titration of the protonophore FCCP; LEAK (LEAK\nCI + CII\n), State 4\no\n, is the resting non-phosphorylating electron transfer across the mitochondrial inner membrane due to uncoupling of ATP synthase by Olgiomycin; OXPHOS (OXPHOS\nCI + CII\n) coupled capacity of oxidative phosphorylation measure convergent respiration of both complex I (Malate, Pyruvate, Glutamate) and II (Succinate) substrates. The SUIT protocol employed in these experiments also utilized the complex I inhibitor, Rotenone, to measure individual complex II-driven respiration (ETS\nCII\n) separately from complex I. In addition, TMPD/ascorbate and azide were administered to measure complex IV respiration.\n\n2.5. Citrate synthase activity\nUpon completion of the HRR measurements, chamber contents were frozen for subsequent citrate synthase (CS) activity quantification. CS (\u03bcmol/mL/min) was used as a marker of brain metabolism secondary to its location within the mitochondrial matrix and importance as the first step of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). In addition, CS is used by some investigators, as a surrogate measure of mitochondrial content per mg of tissue (\nBowling et al., 1993\n;\nLarsen et al., 2012\n). Later, samples were thawed, and a commercially available kit (Citrate Synthase Assay Kit, CS0720, Sigma) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to determine the CS activity.\n\n2.6. Data analysis\nThe oxygen flux traces were analyzed with a customized Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) program designed to extract the oxygen flux plateau at each phase of the SUIT protocol (\nFig. 1b\n), with the exception of TMPD/ASC, when the peak oxygen flux was extracted. \u201cSide\u201d for focal CCI was defined as ipsilateral and contralateral to the site of injury. Statistical evaluation was performed using JMP Pro (SAS Institute Inc., version 10.0, Cary, NC, USA). We compared tissue mitochondrial respiration between injured and sham subjects with an unpaired, non-parametric Wilcoxon ranked sum test with Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison test. A paired Wilcoxon ranked sum test was used to compare sides within sham and injury groups. Differences were considered significant where p < 0.05. All results are reported as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale\n(\n23-33 g body weight) C57BL/6J and IL-6\n\u2212/\u2212\n(B6.129S6-IL6\ntml Kopf\n, C57BL/6J background) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). A total of 123 mice were used in the study. The distribution of mice in the different experimental groups is outlined in the figure legends. The experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at LSU Health Sciences Center and are in compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. All efforts were made to minimize animal distress and the number of animals used.\n\nInduction of transient cerebral ischemia (MCAo/R)\nMice were anesthetized with 150 mg/kg ketamine and 7.5 mg/kg xylazine. Core body temperature was monitored and maintained at 36 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C using a heating blanket during surgery and until recovery from anesthesia. Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced using the intraluminal filament method, as described previously (\nTang et al, 2014\n). Briefly, a blunted 6-0 silicone-coated monofilament (Doccol Corporation, CA) was introduced into the common carotid artery through an arteriotomy below the carotid bifurcation and advanced along the internal carotid artery into the Circle of Willis until mild resistance was felt, indicating that the filament had entered the anterior cerebral artery and blocked the origin of middle cerebral artery (MCA). Following MCA occlusion for a period of 5 min, the filament was withdrawn, allowing for brain reperfusion for a period of 24 hrs. We have previously demonstrated that the 5 min ischemia/24 reperfusion (MCAo/R) protocol does not yield significant sustained neurological deficits nor does it produce detectable brain infarction (\nTang et al, 2014\n). Sham mice were subjected to the same procedure without arteriotomy and monofilament insertion.\n\nIntravital videomicroscopy\nFollowing 24 hrs of reperfusion (after MCA occlusion), the mice were prepared for intravital microscopic observation of the brain, as previously described (\nTang, 2014\n). Briefly, the mice were anesthetized, a craniectomy was performed and the animal was placed on the stage of an upright fluorescent microscope (BX51WI; Olympus, Japan) and allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes. Visualization of individual cerebral microvessels and the induction of thrombus formation were achieved using a 40\u00d7 water immersion objective lens (LUMPlan FI/IR 40\u00d7/0.80\u00d7; Olympus). A silicon-intensified target color video camera (VK-C150; Hitachi, Japan) or a charge-coupled device video camera (XC-77; Hamamatsu, Japan) projected the images onto a monitor (Trinitron PVM-2030; Sony, Japan), which was connected to a video timer (Time-Date Generator WJ-810; Panasonic, Japan) to record time and date. The images were recorded on a DVD recorder (SR-MV50; JVC, Wayne, NJ). The diameters of the selected microvessels were measured by video analysis software (Image J software version 1.37; NIH, US) on a personal computer (G4 Macintosh; Apple, CA).\n\nLight/dye induced thrombosis\nA 10 ml/kg body weight dose of 5% fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC; 150 000 molecular weight; Sigma-Aldrich, US) was injected into the femoral vein cannula and allowed to circulate for 10 minutes before photoactivation. Photoactivation of FITC (excitation, 495 nm; emission, 519 nm) was initiated by exposing 100 \u03bcm vessel (arteriole) length to epi-illumination with a 175-W xenon lamp (Lamda LS, Sutter, US) coupled with a fluorescein filter cube (HQ-FITC; Chroma Technology, US). The excitation power density was calibrated daily (ILT 1700 Radiometer, SED033 detector; International Light Technologies, US) and maintained within 1% of 0.17 W/cm\n2\n, as previously described (\nTang et al, 2014\n). During continuous epi-illumination, thrombus formation was visualized and quantified in both venules and arterioles (diameters: 20\u201340\u03bcm) by determining the time of onset of platelet deposition/aggregation (onset time) and the time to complete blood flow cessation (cessation time). Epi-illumination of a vessel under study was discontinued once blood flow ceased. The results of both onset time and cessation time were averaged from 2\u20134 induced thrombi in each arterioles of the same mouse.\n\nIL-6 in plasma and brain tissue\nA cytometric bead array (Mouse soluble protein master buffer kit; BD Biosciences USA) was used to measure the concentration of IL-6. Briefly, plasma and supernatants of left and right hemisphere brain tissues were collected at 24 hrs after MCAo/R. For these experiments, mice were transcardially perfused (to flush the cerebral vasculature) with 1 \u00d7 phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The samples were processed and analyzed with the cytometric beads as per the manufacturers instructions. The concentration of IL-6 was expressed as pg/ml in plasma or pg/g brain weight for the tissue samples.\n\nGeneration of IL-6\n\u2212/\u2212\nbone marrow chimeras\nBone marrow (BM) chimeras were produced by transplanting bone marrow from either WT or IL-6\n\u2212/\u2212\ndonor mice into lethally irradiated WT recipient mice, as previously described (\nStokes et al, 2006\n). Briefly, BM was isolated from the femurs and tibias of donor mice expressing CD45.2 leukocyte antigen and a minimum of 2\u00d710\n6\ncells in 200\u03bcl PBS were administered via the femoral vein into recipient mice previously irradiated with two doses of 500-525 rad, 3 hr apart. The chimeric mice were kept in autoclaved cages, with 0.2% neomycin drinking water for 2 weeks, followed by normal water. Flow cytometry was used to verify chimera reconstitution at 6-8 weeks by staining for leukocyte CD45.2 expression using a FITC-conjugated antibody and CD45.1 expression using a PE-conjugated antibody. Mice exhibiting > 90% chimerization were used.\nSome WT mice received an antibody that blocks the alpha subunit of the IL-6 receptor (rat anti-IL-6\u03b1 (CD126) from Angio-Proteomic, Boston, MA, 4 mg/Kg) that was administered (i.v.) 24 hr before the experiment.\n\nLaser Speckle Contrast Analysis (LASCA)\nBlood flow in the brain region perfused by the MCA was monitored using a high resolution LASCA imaging system (PeriCam PSI, Perimed, J\u00e4rf\u00e4lla-Stockholm, Sweden), as previously described (\nAyata et al, 2004\n). After the induction of anesthesia, a midline sagittal scalp incision was made and the periosteum removed to expose the surface of the skull. The skull surface was cleansed with saline and lightly swabbed with mineral oil to prevent drying. Speckle images (18mm \u00d7 20mm) were acquired at 6 images/s under 785 nm laser illumination. Both wild type and IL-6\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice were imaged before (baseline) and 5 minutes after filament insertion for MCAo. PIMSoft software was use to drive the system and capture images/data for offline analysis. Blood perfusion units were quantified in a 3.5 mm\n2\nregion of interest in the MCA branches region. Because the MCA branches region was not always visible on the ispilateral side, the 3.5 mm\n2\nregion of interest in this area was placed in the identical location as the baseline image.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as means \u00b1 SEM unless otherwise indicated. One-way ANOVA was used with the Bonferroni or Fisher\u2019s post hoc test. Differences between two data sets were determined using the two-tailed unpaired t-test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (230\u2013250\u00a0g; Harlan laboratories) were used (housed under a 12\u00a0hour light/dark cycle with free access to food and water). All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the U.K. Animals (Surgical Procedures) Act 1996. Behavioural testing, electrophysiology and histological analyses were all performed by experimenters blinded to treatment. Randomisation to assign animals to treatment groups was carried out by an individual playing no further role in the study, as were intraspinal injections of each treatment. A total of 24 animals were used with n\u00a0=\u00a08 assigned to each treatment group (contusion only, contusion\u00a0+\u00a0LV-GFP and contusion\u00a0+\u00a0LV-ChABC). All animals were assessed behaviourally and n\u00a0=\u00a05/group were used for the electrophysiological and histological assessments.\n\n2.2. Chondroitinase gene and lentiviral vectors\nThe\nProteus vulgaris\nChABC gene was modified with mutations targeted to remove five cryptic N-glycosylation sites and addition of a mammalian signal sequence and resynthesised with mammalian preferred codons to make a mammalian-compatible engineered ChABC gene (\nMuir et al., 2010\n). The modified ChABC cDNA was subcloned into a lentiviral transfer vector (termed LV-ChABC) with the mouse phosphoglycerate kinase promoter, as previously described (\nBartus et al., 2014\n). The resulting vector was integrating, self-inactivating and pseudotyped with VSV-G. Viral particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation and titered by a p24 antigen ELISA assay. The viral titer was 479\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of P24, corresponding to ~\u00a010\n6\nTU/\u03bcl. A control lentiviral vector (termed LV-GFP) was generated from the same transfer vector containing the cDNA coding for GFP, with a viral titer of 346\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of P24.\n\n2.3. Contusion injury surgery and treatment\nMale adult rats were anaesthetized (ketamine, 60\u00a0mg/kg, and medetomidine, 0.25\u00a0mg/kg), the cervical region of their backs were shaved and cleansed with iodine and core temperature was maintained close to 37\u00a0\u00b0C using a self-regulating heated blanket. A laminectomy was then performed at vertebral level C5 to expose the underlying spinal cord. Animals were then positioned and stabilised with the impactor probe of an Infinite Horizon impactor (Precision Systems Instrumentation, Lexington, KY) positioned 3\u20134\u00a0mm above the exposed spinal cord. The impactor probe then delivered an impact force of 225\u00a0kdyne to the spinal cord, inducing a moderate cervical (C5) contusion injury. Following injury, rats designated to a contusion only group had their wounds sutured and anaesthesia was then reversed using atipamezole hydrochloride (1\u00a0mg/kg administered i.p.). All other animals received 0.5\u00a0\u03bcl intraspinal injections of either LV-GFP or LV-ChABC immediately rostral and caudal to the contusion injury (one injection either side). Injections were delivered at a rate of 200\u00a0nl/min using an ultra micropump III (World Precisions Instrumentation, Europe). Following intraspinal injection, wounds were closed and anaesthesia was reversed. All animals received post-operative analgesia (carprofen mg/kg) for two days, saline for rehydration (3\u20135\u00a0ml) for three days, and a one week course of antibiotics (baytril; mg/kg).\n\n2.4. Behavioural assessments\nAnimals were trained in all behavioural tasks for one week prior to surgery and were assessed on the day prior to surgery to provide baseline data for each task. Assessments were then carried out on a weekly basis post-surgery by an experimenter blinded to treatment group.\nSkilled locomotion and sensorimotor integration were assessed using the horizontal ladder test. This involved counting the total number of both forelimb and hindlimb footslips made by each animal over the course of three runs across a 1\u00a0m ladder with unevenly spaced rungs.\nForelimb grip-strength was assessed using a forelimb grip-strength meter (Linton Instrumentation). This involved rats grasping onto a metal bar with their forepaws, which was attached to a force transducer, and slowly being pulled backwards with gradually increasing force until the rat could no longer hold on and would then release the bar. The grip-strength meter gave a readout of the maximum force applied to the force transducer (i.e. the force at which the rat could no longer grip the bar) and this was recorded. An average was taken from three grip-strength readouts per session.\nFor the inclined plane task animals were placed horizontally on a rubberised surface (to provide traction) initially held at an angle of 40\u00b0. If the rat could hold its position, with no signs of slipping, for 4\u00a0s then the incline was increased by 5\u00b0. This process was repeated until the incline reached an angle at which the rat could no longer stay stationary and began to slip. This was repeated twice more and an average angle of incline at which the rat began to slip was calculated from the three scores.\n\n2.5. Electrophysiological assessment of sensory function\nAxonal conduction was assessed by antidromic stimulation of sensory fibres in the dorsal columns in terminal electrophysiology experiments, using a method adapted from a previous study (\nJames et al., 2011\n). The spinal cord was exposed from C2 to T1 and T13 to L5 (vertebral levels) in urethane-anaesthetized rats (1.25\u00a0g/kg). Antidromic unitary activity was recorded and quantified from teased dorsal root filaments (left and right L3\u2013S1 roots), whilst first stimulating the entire dorsal columns 5\u00a0mm below and then 5\u00a0mm above the injury site. Conduction through the injury site was measured by calculating the number of single units present when stimulating above the injury site as a percentage of the total number of single units when stimulating below. Stimulation was continuous during recording sessions and was carried out using 0.2\u00a0ms duration, square wave pulses at a frequency of 1\u00a0Hz and an incrementally increasing intensity (0\u2013800\u00a0\u03bcA). Stimulation was maximal by 400\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcA (i.e. no further unitary activity could be recruited), but continued to be increased to 800\u00a0\u03bcA to ensure that no high-threshold fibres were undetected.\n\n2.6. Histological assessment of cavity size\nTissue preparation and eriochrome cyanine histochemistry were performed as previously described (\nJames et al., 2011\n). Sections were examined using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope and pictures were taken of sections at 800\u00a0\u03bcm intervals throughout the lesion site using a Zeiss AxioCam MRm. Images were analysed using Axiovision software, which allowed the tracing of the spinal cord perimeter and any cavity for each image captured, giving the total area for these measurements in each section. The lesion epicentre was defined as the section from each animal with the largest cavity area and quantification was carried out at 800\u00a0\u03bcm intervals from 2.4\u00a0mm caudal to 2.4\u00a0mm rostral to the epicentre. The cavity area was calculated as a percentage of spinal cord area (i.e. area within the tracing of spinal cord perimeter) for each section.\n\n2.7. Statistical analysis\nAll numerical values are reported as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.e.m. and all statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism v5 software. Behavioural and histological data were analysed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA, electrophysiological data was analysed by one-way ANOVA. Post-hoc comparisons were carried out where appropriate and all statistical tests are stated in the text."

    "Methods": "Neuron culture, differentiation and gene transfer\nThe motor neuron-like cell line, NSC34 cells, which were the hybrid cell line produced by fusion of neuroblastoma with mouse motoneuron-enriched primary spinal cord cells, were kindly provided by Dr. Neil Cashman (University of British Columbia) and were cultured in DMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and L-glutamine. To differentiate NSC34 to NSC34\nD\n, NSC34 cells are grown to 70% confluence, and medium changed to: DMEM (50%) + Ham\u2019s F12 (50%, Gibco), 1% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% modified Eagle\u2019s medium nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). This medium change has been shown to slow down cell growth and cause considerable number of cells to die 24\u201348 hr after the medium change (\nEggett et al., 2000\n). The survived cells (NSC34\nD\n) showed very long processes (\nEggett et al., 2000\n). These cells can be sub-cultured to ~3 passages. Experiments were carried out on NSC34\nD\ncells, which showed long processes, 2 weeks after the differentiation.\nConstruction of recombinant adenoviral vectors containing mt-cpYFP (Ad-mt-cpYFP) has been described previously (\nWang et al., 2008\n). The mt-cpYFP has been shown to respond to superoxide specifically at 488 nm excitation and ratiometric measurement of bursting superoxide production events, termed superoxide flashes, in intact cells is achieved by dual wavelength excitation (488 and 405 nm) (\nWang et al., 2008\n). Ad-mt-cpYFP was amplified in HEK 293 cells and purified by standard CsCl gradient centrifugation followed by overnight dialysis. The concentration of virus was determined to be at ~1 \u00d7 10\n11\nviral particles per ml. Adv-SOD2 virus was a kind gift from Dr. John F. Engelhardt (University of Iowa) (\nZwacka et al., 1998a\n;\nZwacka et al., 1998b\n). All the viruses were aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was done in NSC34\nD\ncells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Lentivirus containing 5 different sequences of MCU shRNA or a control scrambled shRNA (SC shRNA) were purchased from Sigma and used at an MOI of 5.\n\nConfocal imaging of single mitochondrial superoxide flashes and whole cell Ca\n2+\nConfocal imaging used a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope equipped with a 40\u00d7 1.3NA oil immersion objective and followed a procedure developed previously (\nWang et al., 2008\n). To detect superoxide flashes, cells were incubated in modified KHB solutions containing 138 mM NaCl, 3.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 15 mM Glucose, 20 mM HEPES and 1 mM CaCl\n2\n, pH 7.4 at room temperature and in a custom designed perfusion chamber mounted on confocal microscope stage. Dual excitation images of mt-cpYFP were taken by alternating excitation at 405 and 488 nm and collecting emissions at >505 nm. Time-lapse x, y images were acquired at 1024 resolution (x axis, y axis was adjusted according to the shape of cells, usually between 300\u2013400 pixels, pixel size ~0.1 \u00b5m) for 100 frames and at a sampling rate of ~1 s per frame. In a subset of experiments, mitochondrial membrane potential indicator, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM 20 nM, Invitrogen) was loaded into cells and tri-wavelength imaging of mt-cpYFP and TMRM was taken by sequential excitation at 405, 488, and 543 nm, and emissions collected at 505\u2013550, 505\u2013550 and >560 nm, respectively. Digital image processing used IDL software (Research Systems) and customer-devised programs.\nTo monitor cytosolic Ca\n2+\n, we loaded cells with a fluorescent Ca\n2+\nindicator, fluo-4-AM (Invitrogen, 10 \u00b5M) for 30 min followed by 30 min washout. Confocal 2D images were collected by excitation at 488 nm and collecting emissions at >505 nm. The whole cell fluorescence (soma and neurites) were used.\n\nWestern blot\nTo detect gene expression in cultured NSC34 and NSC34\nD\ncells, cell were harvested in lysis buffer (Cell Signaling). Protein samples were quantified by BCA assay (Pierce) and equal amount of proteins were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gel. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with antibodies specific for human SOD2 (1:1000, Calbiochem), GluR2 (1:1000, NeuroMab), or actin (1:2000, Sigma). Secondary antibodies were conjugated to IRDye 800 (Rockland) or Alexa Fluor 680 (Invitrogen) and signals were visualized and quantified using Odyssey system (Licor).\n\nConfocal imaging of mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidative stress\nMitochondrial membrane potential was determined by JC-1 (5 \u00b5M, Invitrogen), a ratiometric dye that facilitates the accurate determination of membrane potential. JC-1 fluorescence was monitored by excitation at 488 nm and emissions collected at 505\u2013545 nm (green) and >560 nm (red). The ratio of red/green fluorescence was used to determine membrane potential, the higher this ratio the more polarized the mitochondrial membrane. To monitor mitochondrial superoxide levels, MitoSOX Red (5 \u00b5M, Invitrogen) was loaded into NSC34\nD\ncells at 37\u00b0C for 10 min followed by washing two times. MitoSOX fluorescence was detected by excitation at 405 and 514 nm, and both emissions collected at >560 nm. To avoid saturation by excessive oxidation, all MitoSOX experiments were completed within 30 min of loading. To determine cellular oxidation, CM-H\n2\nDCFDA (10 \u00b5M, Invitrogen) was loaded into cells and fluorescence monitored by excitation at 488 nm and emission collected at >505 nm. Image analysis used ImageJ software.\n\nCell viability assay\nTrypan blue exclusion assay was used to test cell viability. Briefly, cells were incubated in trypan blue (0.2\u20130.4% in PBS) for 2 min at room temperature and then washed twice. Images were taken within 3 to 5 min of trypan blue washout by a light microscope with a 4\u00d7 lens. At least 5 fields were counted from 1 well. Unstained cells (clear) were counted as viable and cells with blue color were damaged.\n\nStatistics\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM.

    "Methods": "Cell culture and ethanol treatment\nNCCs (JoMa1.3 cells) were cultured as previously described (\nChen et al., 2013\n). Briefly, cells were grown on cell culture dishes coated with fibronectin and maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM): Ham\u2019s F12 (1:1) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2/95% air. For ethanol exposure, NCCs were cultured in medium containing 50 or 100 mM ethanol for 24 hours. Stable ethanol levels were maintained by placing the cell culture plates in a plastic desiccator containing corresponding ethanol concentration in distilled water as described previously (\nChen et al., 2013\n).\n\nAnimal care and dosing\nC57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were mated for two hours in the morning. The time of plug detection was considered 0 days, 0 hour of gestation (GD 0:0). Pregnant mice were given two intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose of ethanol, with 4 hours apart, in lactated Ringer\u2019s solution at a dosage of 1.9 g/kg or 2.9 g/kg maternal body weight (BW). The first injection was administered on GD 8:0. Control mice were administered lactated Ringer\u2019s solution alone. For miRNA analysis, pregnant mice were killed on GD 8: 6, GD 8:9 or GD 8:12 (6, 9 or 12 hours after the first ethanol treatment). Embryos were dissected free of their deciduas in lactated Ringer\u2019s solution and then staged by counting the number of somite pairs. Embryos with comparable developmental stage were pooled for mRNA preparation. All protocols used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nCell transfection\nFor transient transfection, miR-125b mimic, miRNA inhibitor, control mimic or control inhibitor at a final concentration of 50 nM was transfected into NCCs according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Ambion, Austin, TX). The cells were harvested 48 hours after transfection for additional treatments and analysis. The effects of miR-125b mimic or miR-125b inhibitor on the expression of miR-125b were verified using TaqMan\u00ae real-time PCR (Ambion, Austin, TX), as described in the next section.\n\nAnalysis of miRNA expression\nTo detect miRNA-125b expression, total RNA was isolated using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using a stem-loop primer for reverse transcription followed by a sequence specific real-time Taqman\u00ae probe. Briefly, total RNA (10 ng) was reversed transcribed with 100 mM dNTPs, 50 U of reverse transcriptase, 0.4 U of RNase inhibitor, and a specific stem-loop primer at a condition of 16\u00b0C at 30 min, 42\u00b0C for 30 min, and 85\u00b0C for 5 min. qRT-PCR reactions were performed using a standard protocol on a Rotor-Gene 6000 Real-Time PCR system (Corbett Life Science, Sydney, Australia). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 min and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. All TaqMan microRNA assays were performed in triplicate. Data were normalized with snoRNA202 as endogenous controls. Relative expression was calculated with the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method.\n\nConstruction of luciferase reporter plasmids and reporter assays\nmiR-125b target sites in the 3\u2032-UTR regions of mRNAs were predicted by using the following online databases: Target Scan (\nhttp://www.targetscan.org/\n), microRNA (\nhttp://www.microrna.org/microrna/home/do\n) and PicTar (\nhttp://pictar.mde-berlin.de/\n). The 3\u2032-UTR of Bak1 and PUMA containing putative miR-125b binding sites were amplified from mouse genomic and cloned into the pMIR-REPORT\n\u2122\n(Ambion, Austin, TX). Primers used to clone the DNA fragments containing the Bak1 3\u2032-UTR and PUMA 3\u2032-UTR were: 5\u2032-actagtcgtggtacacagattcttcagatc-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-aagcttggagagcctgatggatgtgttcag-3\u2032; 5\u2032-actagttccgccttctgacaccctggcca-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-aagcttatctacagcagtgcatgtacagt-3\u2032, respectively. The constructs (200 ng of plasmid/well of 24-well plates) were co-transfected with 20 ng Renilla luciferase pRL-TK control reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and 50 nmol of miR-125b mimics or mimic control (Ambion, Austin, TX) into NCCs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Luciferase activity was measured 48 hours after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) with a Lumat LB 9507 Ultra Sensitive Tube Luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The luciferase activity of each sample was normalized to the pRL/TK-driven Renilla luciferase activity.\n\nWestern blotting\nWestern blotting was performed as described previously (\nDong et al., 2011\n). Briefly, NCCs were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in pre-cold RIPA lysis buffer (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) with 1 mM fresh-prepared PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and protease cocktail inhibitors (Roche Applied, Indianapolis, IN). Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 xg for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and the supernatants were used for Western blot. The protein concentration in each sample was determined using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Western blots were performed by standard protocols. The levels of Bak1, PUMA, caspase-3 and \u03b2-actin were analyzed with the following antibodies, respectively: rabbit polyclonal anti-Bak antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), rabbit polyclonal anti-PUMA antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), rabbit monoclonal anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), and rabbit polyclonal anti-\u03b2-actin (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA). The membranes were developed on a Kodak X-OMAT 2000A imaging system (Kodak, Rochester, NY) and the intensity of the protein band was analyzed using the Adobe Photoshop CS software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA).\n\nDetermination of cell viability and apoptosis\nCell viability was measured using an MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl) -2H-tetrazolium salt) assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Apoptosis was determined by analysis of caspase-3 activation by western blot as described previously (\nDong et al., 2008\n).\n\nEmbryo microinjection and whole embryo culture\nThe delivery of miRNAs into mouse embryos requires the microinjection of miRNA mimic into the amniotic cavity of the early embryos. The microinjection technique is similar to that used for antisense oligodeoxynucleotide microinjection as previous reported by other investigators (\nAugustine, 1997\n;\nAugustine et al., 1993\n;\nHartig and Hunter, 1998\n). On gestational day 8, C57BL/6J embryos were explanted under a dissecting microscope with removal of the maternal decidua, trophoblast, parietal yolk sac, and Reichert\u2019s membranes, whereas the visceral yolk sac, ectoplacental cone, and amnion remained intact. Those embryos having three to five somite pairs were used for microinjection and subsequent whole embryos culture. Microinjection was performed by using a handheld microinjector made of glass pipettes which are connected by Silastic tubing to a syringe. The needle tip was inserted into the amniotic cavity by traversing the visceral yolk sac and amniotic membrane. 400 nL mixtures containing 600 nM/L miR-125b mimic, control mimic or ddH2O and 40 \u03bcg/mL Lipofectamine 2000 were microinjected into each embryo. After microinjection, each embryo was placed into a 30 ml vial for whole embryo culture as described previously (\nChen et al., 2001\n). Embryos were cultured for 15 hours in control medium, followed by culture for an additional 9 hours in medium containing 50 mM ethanol. At the end of culture, extraembryonic membranes were removed and embryos were examined under a dissecting microscope to determine the number of somite pairs. Then the embryos were collected for preparation of miRNA and protein for the evaluation of miR-125 expression and Western blot analysis of Bak1 and PUMA expression as described above. The total protein content of each embryo was determined by using BCA protein assay kit.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). All data are expressed as means \u00b1 SEM of at least three independent experiments. Comparisons between groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni\u2019s post-test. Differences between groups were considered significant at P < 0.05."

    "Methods": "Mice\nFemale mice were used at 6\u20138 weeks of age. Mice were weighed before the blast session, and excluded if they weighed less than 14.0 g or more than 19.5 g. Behavioral studies were conducted exclusively on C57BL/6 mice, which were either purchased directly from Jackson Laboratories (JAX; Bar Harbor, ME), and/or taken from a colony maintained from C57BL/6 founders originally obtained from JAX. Histological studies were performed on both the C57BL/6 mice and on a strain of transgenic mice developed by the Sanes laboratory (\nBareyre et al., 2005\n) in which enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) is expressed in the corticospinal tract, henceforth called \u201cCST-YFP\u201d mice. These transgenic mice were obtained by breeding floxed Thy1-EYFP reporter mice and Emx1-Cre driver mice, each of which was created on C57BL/6 background. Founder transgenic mice were purchased from JAX, and colonies of each were subsequently maintained at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC). The Thy1 promoter is widely expressed in projection neurons throughout the nervous system, whereas the Emx1 gene is selectively expressed in cortical pyramidal neurons. Given the nearly 90% frequency of recombination in CST-YFP mice, almost all corticospinal neurons, including their axons and synaptic terminals, are visualizable with EYFP (\nBareyre et al., 2005\n). Despite concerns regarding the leaky expression of EYFP in small numbers of other neuronal populations (\nWillenberg and Steward, 2012\n), this does not represent a problem for our studies because we used the YFP fluorescence primarily to visualize axons in the main dorsal component of the CST (dCST). Procedures involving animals adhered to National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at UTHSC.\n\nBlast injury of the spinal cord\nOur model uses a pressurized air tank and a modified paintball gun to deliver high-pressure air blasts to the dorsum of the animal through an opening in a mouse holder that shields the rest of the animal\u2019s body from the blast. The device was originally developed to study the ocular damage caused by blast forces, such as those generated by improvised explosive devices (\nHines-Beard et al., 2012\n; also see\nBricker-Anthony et al., 2014a\n,\nb\n), and was subsequently adapted to model TBI by targeting the temporal side of the head (Guley et al., submitted for publication;\nHeldt et al., 2014\n;\nReiner et al., 2014\n). For both ocular injury and TBI, the blast is restricted to a circular area on the left side of the mouse\u2019s head and the other side of the mouse\u2019s head and body is cushioned with soft foam rubber. To injure the spinal cord, we made several adjustments in the overall approach (\nFig. 1\n). First, we surmised that the vertebrae would at least partly block transmission of the blast such that the pressure wave would be conducted to the spinal cord primarily across the interlaminar spaces. Thus, we decided to maximize those spaces, by stretching out the torso of the mouse and then taping the mouse\u2019s paws and tail to a rigid cardboard sheet to keep the mouse in an outstretched position. Second, rather than the circular opening, we fabricated a rectangular opening, to correspond to the shape of the spinal cord. The dimensions we chose for the opening were 3 mm wide (roughly the width of the vertebral column) by 5.5 mm long (the length of ~3 segments). Third, we delivered two successive blasts, spaced 2\u20134 min apart.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nBlast cannon model adapted for spinal cord injury. A, B) An anesthetized mouse, with its back shaved, is taped in an outstretched position to a strip of foam attached to a stiff platform made of posterboard. C) The mouse holder is a transparent PVC pipe with a 2 cm circular opening. After the mouse, taped to the platform, is slid into the mouse holder, the T9 segment is centered within the circular opening. D) A plastic sheet, with a 3 mm wide \u00d7 5.5 mm long open slit, is centered over the circular opening using rubber bands (purple), in order to restrict the blast to ~3 segments (T8\u201310) of the vertebral column. E) Top view of the horizontally-mounted paintball gun used to deliver high-pressure air blasts. The mouse holder is shown closely apposed to the gun barrel. F) A close-up view of E, now with a mouse in the holder. Mouse nose is to the left; its dorsum faces the gun barrel.\nAt the start of each blast session, the pressure delivered by the gun was measured using a pressure transducer placed in the same location the targeted region of the mouse\u2019s body would later occupy, and adjusted to reach the desired pressure level (\nHeldt et al., 2014\n;\nHines-Beard et al., 2012\n). We delivered somewhat higher pressures (70-psi peak pressure) than those used to create mild TBI with the same blast cannon system (60-psi peak pressure; Guley et al., submitted for publication;\nHeldt et al., 2014\n;\nReiner et al., 2014\n), to compensate for the greater protection provided by the substantial muscle and bone that overlie the spinal cord.\nOur blast procedure was as follows (\nFig. 1\n). Immediately prior to blast, each mouse was anesthetized with Avertin (400 mg/kg body weight) and the fur on its back was shaved. The mouse was placed on strip of soft foam attached to the upper side of a 2.8 cm-wide, 32 cm-long platform made of firm posterboard and its paws and tail were taped to the foam, to stabilize the mouse in an outstretched position. The platform was slid into the mouse holder, which is a transparent PVC pipe with an inner diameter of 3.2 cm and a 2 cm circular opening in one wall. To restrict the air blast to the T8\u201310 level of the vertebral column, we probed for the vertebral spinous processes using a blunt dissecting tool, centered the T9 segment (\u00b11 segment) within the 2 cm opening, and then covered the circular opening with a firm, thin plastic sheet having a 3 mm wide \u00d7 5.5 mm long open slit. In this way, the mouse\u2019s body, except for the region under the slit, would be shielded from the blast. The mouse holder was mounted and then positioned so that the exposed part of the mouse\u2019s dorsum was ~1 cm from the barrel of the gun when the blast was delivered. Despite the foam cushioning, platform, and snug fit in the mouse holder, the mouse moved slightly during the first blast, and so it was repositioned to re-center T9 before the second blast was delivered. A small subset of mice received blasts at a lower level of pressure (20 psi). Sham mice underwent the exact same procedure, except that the mouse holder was positioned several centimeters from the gun barrel and a piece of cardboard was inserted between the two to block the blast wave from reaching the mouse. The mice were kept in a heated chamber while recovering from anesthesia and prior to returning to their cage. An analgesic (liquid children\u2019s Tylenol) was given orally, by addition to the drinking water at 35 mg/ml, for 24 h after blast.\nA few mice were videotaped at 1100 fps with a pco.1200 hs camera (The Cooke Corp., Romulus, MI) to visualize their movement during the blast. The camera was positioned above the mouse holder and viewed the animal\u2019s lateral aspect.\n\nBehavioral testing\nMotor function was assessed using three standard tasks: rotarod, horizontal beam, and treadmill. Mice were tested 1\u20133 days before blast to establish baseline levels for each mouse for each task. The mice underwent several training trials for rotarod and horizontal beam before the pre-blast testing. Treadmill running did not require previous training.\nThe horizontal beam was 1 cm in diameter and 80 cm long with a darkened escape box on one end. Testing sessions were videotaped and consisted of 3 runs for each mouse, conducted at least 10 min apart. Frames from the videos when the mice were roughly midway between the two ends of the beam were selected and used to measure rump-height (the vertical distance from the animal\u2019s tail base to the beam). Rump-height distance has been previously used to assess recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) caused by cord compression in mice (\nApostolova et al., 2006\n), and provides an indication of the mouse\u2019s ability to support its body weight. Values for the 3 runs were averaged.\nFor the rotarod task, speed was increased from 4 rpm to 20 rpm over a four-minute period, and then 20 rpm was maintained for another 2 min. Each testing session consisted of 3 runs, at least 10 min apart. Latency to fall and speed of the rotarod at the time of fall were recorded. Values for the 3 runs were used to obtain an average for each mouse. Mice that were tested on rotarod before blast were assigned to either the blasted or sham group in such a way that the average performance on rotarod was equivalent for both groups for each cohort of mice.\nThe DigiGait Imaging System (Mouse Specifics, Quincy, MA) provides an automated and highly detailed quantitative analysis of locomotion. In the DigiGait System, a mouse is placed on a transparent motorized treadmill housed within a Plexiglas compartment and images of the mouse walking are acquired by a high-speed video camera mounted underneath the treadmill. Several seconds of video are then analyzed by the software to yield measures of the spatial and temporal characteristics of gait for each limb and of interlimb coordination. In initial trials, we found that all 6\u20138 week old female C57BL/6 mice were able to keep up with the treadmill moving at a speed of 20 cm/s before blast and nearly all could do so at 30 cm/s. Each mouse was tested at the slower speed first, and at the faster speed several minutes later. Mice that were unable to maintain their position on the treadmill were allowed several attempts, with several minutes between attempts.\nThe results of the behavioral tests are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error and were analyzed statistically. Unless otherwise noted, paired t-tests were used to compare data for each group of mice (blasted or sham) at a selected time after blast with data for pre-blast testing. Un-paired t-tests were used to compare the change from before blast to a specific post-blast time for blasted mice with the change for sham mice over the same time period.\n\nHistology\nTissue preparation\nMice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of avertin (0.2 ml per gram of body weight) and perfused transcardially with heparinized saline, followed by 25 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB). The mice were then dissected to expose the spinal cord, and the mouse torso with spinal cord still in situ was post-fixed overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The torso was washed in 0.1 M PB, and specific regions of cord, identified in relation to the adjacent ribs were removed, so they could later be sectioned separately. Note that we used vertebral levels to specify segmental levels of the spinal cord, rather than identifying spinal cord segments by the criteria described in a recent publication (\nHarrison et al., 2013\n). The spinal cord at levels above (typically T4 or T5 through T8) and through the blast site (typically T8 through T10 or T11) were embedded and sectioned separately in the horizontal plane. The region below the blast site (typically T10 or T11 through L5) was cut in the transverse plane. For transverse sections, the spinal cords from 2 or 3 mice, at least one of which was blasted and another one being a sham, were placed in the same tissue block for later quantitative analysis of the labeling. Tissue was washed in PB, and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/PB. Sections were cut on a cryostat at 30 \u03bcm, mounted directly in serial order onto Superfrost/Plus slides (Fisher, Fair Lawn, NJ), and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until used.\nImmunofluorescent processing\nSlides were processed for immunofluorescence as follows. Slides were washed in PB, permeabilized and quenched in 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1 M glycine in 0.1 M PB for \u00bd h, blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 0.1 M PB for \u00bd h, and incubated in primary antibodies diluted in 3% BSA in 0.1 M PB. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-PKC\u03b3 (Abcam, #ab71558), rabbit anti-\u03b2APP (Invitrogen, #51-2700), rabbit anti-LC3b (Novus Biologicals, #NB600-1384), rabbit anti-\u03b1II-spectrin breakdown product 150 kDa (SBDP150, Ab 37;\nRoberts-Lewis et al., 1994\n; kindly provided by Robert Siman, Univ. of Pennsylvania), mouse anti-\u03b2III-tubulin (TuJ1; Covance Research Projects, #MMS-435P), and mouse RMO14 (which binds to a region within the rod domain of the medium neurofilament subunit (NF-M) that is exposed by proteolysis;\nHall and Lee, 1995\n; kindly provided by Virginia Lee, Univ. of Pennsylvania). After incubation in a mix of primary antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C, slides were washed and then incubated with appropriate species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488, 594, or 647 (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. For double-labeling with the mouse monoclonal antibodies, TuJ1 and RMO14, sections were incubated in a mixture of goat anti-ms IgG2a-Alexa555 and goat anti-ms IgG1-Alexa594 (A21137 and A21125, respectively, Invitrogen;\nManning et al., 2012\n). Slides were washed and then coverslipped in Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL).\n\nImage capture and analysis\nImages of fluorescently labeled sections were captured with a Zeiss 710 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Images were subsequently processed and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop and/or Image J. To assess co-expression, we viewed enlarged images on a computer monitor with Adobe Photoshop, and created overlying layers in which we marked axonal profiles labeled with a particular fluorophore in one layer, and then did the same for the other fluorophore channel(s).\nTo evaluate the loss of axons in the dCST, we used PKC\u03b3 as a marker, as has previously been done to assess the effectiveness of pyramidotomy and a variety of spinal cord lesions (\nBradbury et al., 2002\n;\nCafferty and Strittmatter, 2006\n). Analysis was performed on mice sacrificed at \u22657 days after blast to allow time for the distal ends of axons injured at mid-thoracic levels to degenerate. Slides containing sections corresponding to lower thoracic and upper lumbar levels were selected for immunostaining. Analysis was limited to segmentally matched sections at T13-L1, using the shape of the dorsal funiculus as shown in the Allen Brain Atlas to determine segmental level. Images of 2\u20133 sections from each of the 2\u20133 spinal cords contained in a given tissue block were captured under identical conditions over a few hour time period. The optical density of the dorsal columns was measured with Image J to determine background labeling, and used to adjust all the images to the same background optical density level. The area occupied by the dCST was outlined and a threshold level was set to distinguish labeled vs unlabeled pixels. The area above threshold was then measured, using the same threshold for all sections in a given tissue block. For the histograms in\nFig. 10C\n, the area > threshold for blasted mice was expressed as a percentage relative to the sham mouse in the same tissue block. For tissue blocks containing spinal cords from 2 sham mice, their average dCST area > threshold was used to normalize the dCST area for the blasted mouse. For statistical comparisons, the absolute areas of blasted and sham mice in the same tissue block were compared using paired t-tests. Data from mice at 29\u201337 days after blast were pooled together for the results at 1 month post-blast.\nFig. 10.\nOpen in a new tab\nDegeneration of CST axons. A, B) Transverse sections of the spinal cord at the T13-L1 level immunostained for PKC\u03b3 to visualize the dCST. Within the spinal cord, PKC\u03b3 expression is restricted to dCST axons and to a subpopulation of lamina II dorsal horn interneurons; the latter provides a useful positive control for the immunostaining. A is from a sham mouse. B, from one of its littermates at 7 days after blast, shows less intense immunostaining, indicating the loss of dCST axons. The optical density scale has been inverted so that the fluorescent staining appears black and background has been adjusted to make the gray matter visible, to provide orientation. Scale bar = 100 \u03bcm. C) Histograms showing the area of PKC\u03b3 immunostaining in the dCST above threshold, expressed as percentage of that for sham mice. Average value for blasted mice at 7 days after blast is significantly less than that of their sham littermates. Area of the dCST at 1 month post-blast is more than at 7 days post-blast, but is still significantly less than that of the sham littermates. Brackets indicate standard errors. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.005."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale C57 black mice (C57BL/6; Charles River, Senneville St-Constant, Quebec, Canada) were used. C57 mice that are \u226524-months-old may correspond to a human age of approximately \u226570 years (\nFlurkey et al., 2007\n). However, aged C57 mice often encounter many health-related complications such as skin lesions, ear infections and tumors (\nFlurkey et al., 2007\n). Therefore we chose to conduct our MCAO experiments in 16\u201320 month-old C57 mice in order to minimize confounding health complications while effectively modeling brain ischemia in aging animals. Overall, 89 aging mice were used: 67 animals underwent a MCAO, 15 underwent a sham surgery or occlusion of the common carotid artery alone (n=7 or 8), and 7 died during the course of surgery/anesthesia due to either respiratory suppression or bleeding. A separate cohort of adult C57 black mice (male, 6\u20138 months-old, n=38) were used to compare the effects of age on early-onset seizures.\nThe animals were housed in a vivarium that was maintained at 22\u201323\u00b0C with a 12-hour light on/off cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. All experiments detailed were reviewed and approved by the animal care committee of the University Health Network in accordance with the Canadian Guidelines for Animal Care. In line with the guidelines, animals with severe CS were treated with clinically appropriate anticonvulsants. Mandatory euthanization was conducted if animals exhibited severe, recurrent CS inadequately suppressed by anticonvulsant treatments and/or presented in poor physical condition such as with persistent immobility, lack of eating and drinking, irresponsiveness to touch, loss of the righting reflex, and/or a substantial reduction in body weight (\u226520% of baseline level). In our study, acute mortality was defined as spontaneous death or mandatory euthanization within 48 hours post-ischemia.\n\nIntracranial EEG recordings\nElectrode construction, implantation and EEG recordings were conducted as previously described (\nWu et al., 2008\n;\nWais et al., 2009\n;\nEl-Hayek et al., 2011a\n,\nb\n;\nJeffrey et al., 2014\n). All electrodes were constructed using polyamide-insulated stainless steel wires (outside diameter of 200 \u03bcm for monopolar electrodes and 125 \u03bcm for twisted bipolar electrodes; Plastics One, Ranoake, VA, USA). Monopolar electrodes were pre-assembled in an array before implantation (\nWu et al., 2008\n). The tips of the twisted bipolar wires were separated by approximately 100 \u03bcm (\nJeffrey et al., 2014\n). EEG recordings were made using a dual-channel AC microelectrode amplifier with extended headstages (model 1800, AM Systems, Carlsborg, WA, USA). Signals were collected in a frequency bandwidth of 0.1\u20131000 Hz, amplified 1000 times and then digitized at \u22655 KHz (Digidata 1300, Molecular Devices; Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Data acquisition, storage, and analysis were conducted using pClamp software (version 9 or 10; Molecular Devices).\nMonopolar recordings were conducted in the majority of animals since electrode implantation involved a shorter surgery with minimal perioperative complications, a particularly important consideration in more susceptible aging animals (\nWu et al., 2008\n). EEG activity recorded with monopolar electrodes represented the signal difference between the recording and reference electrodes. Therefore, this method was more sensitive to movement artifacts and other remote signals. Twisted bipolar electrodes were used for local differential recordings in some animals but the relatively long surgery for implantation was associated with greater perioperative complications including mortality. EEG activity in these local differential recordings represented the signal difference between the tips of the two twisted electrodes. Therefore, this method was less susceptible to other artifacts or remote signals, and was preferable for sampling the local circuitry activity.\nFor monopolar recordings, electrodes were implanted bilaterally into the hippocampal CA1 (bregma \u22122.3 mm, lateral 2.0 mm and depth 2.0 mm) and parietal cortex (bregma \u22120.6 mm, lateral 1.5 mm and depth 1 mm;\nFranklin and Paxinos, 1997\n) or unilaterally into the hippocampal CA3 (bregma: \u22122.6 mm, lateral 2.5 mm and depth 3.0 mm) and parietal cortex. For local differential recordings, twisted bipolar electrodes were implanted bilaterally into the hippocampal CA3 or into CA3 and the parietal cortex. The locations of the implanted electrodes were verified histologically (\nFig 3C\n,\nSupplemental Fig 1\n).\nFig. 3. Extensive ipsilateral brain injury in aging mice with CS.\nOpen in a new tab\nData were collected from aging mice.\nA\u2013D\n, images of cresyl violet-stained brain sections obtained from 4 representative animals. Time of histological examination, experimental protocol, and the presence/absence of CS are indicated above each row of images.\nLeft\n, low power views at three coronal levels.\nRight\n, magnified views of dorsal hippocampal areas (denoted by red dots on low power view). \u2018Ipsilateral\u2019 and \u2018contralateral\u2019 are relative to unilateral MCAO. Note the weakly stained ipsilateral regions and the enlarged ipsilateral to contralateral hemispheric area in the animal with CS (C). The track of an implanted hippocampal electrode is denoted by black arrows in C.\nE\n, the ratio of the ipsilateral to contralateral hemispheric areas were calculated from brain sections at 8 coronal levels (from bregma \u22123.2 mm to 1.9 mm). Data were grouped according to the specific experimental protocol and the presence/absence of CS. *, sham controls vs. other groups, p<0.05, one way ANOVA.\nMost EEG recordings were performed in free-moving animals. During some EEG recordings, animals were placed in a mouse restrainer (Type C or D, Canadawide Scientific, Ottawa, Canada) to limit the amount of CS-related movement artifacts. Although the restrainers inhibited vigorous convulsive behavior such as jumping and rapid running, other characteristic seizure activity such as barrel-rolling, rapid limb movements, and tail erections remained observable and analogous to those seen in their unrestrained counterparts.\nTo quantify EEG changes over time, we used the root mean square (RMS) of the EEG signals as this has been shown to be a sensitive measure of ischemic EEG suppression in adult C57 black mice following hypoxia-ischemia (\nEl-Hayek et al., 2011b\n). Others have used EEG RMS to assess brain activities in a rat model of post hemorrhagic seizures (\nKlahr et al., 2015\n). RMS calculations were made from 30-sec EEG segments collected while animals were immobile as these data segments were minimally contaminated by movement-related artifacts. Power spectra were then generated with 50% window overlap at a spectral resolution of 0.3 Hz. The RMS of the EEG power spectrum was automatically calculated in pClamp.\n\nMiddle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)\nAnimals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane. During surgery, animal rectal temperatures were maintained between 35.5\u201336.5\u00b0C via an automatic heating device (DC temperature controller, FHC Inc., Bowdoin, ME, USA). Permanent and reversible MCAO, referred to as pMCAO and rMCAO in the following text, were conducted via intra-luminal suture insertion (\nDurukan and Tatlisumak 2007\n;\nHossmann, 2008\n;\nHowells et al., 2010\n;\nLiu and McCullough, 2011\n). Each surgery lasted 20\u201340 minutes. The protocol for electrocoagulation of the MCA (MCAO-e) was modified from previous studies in adult mice (\nLiu et al., 2005\n;\nCipriani et al., 2011\n;\nMoyanova et al., 2011\n;\nWang et al., 2011\n).\nFor the pMCAO, a silicon-coated fine suture (#6, Doccol Corporation, Redlands, CA, USA) was inserted into the common carotid artery and advanced through the internal carotid artery with its tip 7\u20138 mm distal to the carotid bifurcation (the Koizumi\u2019s method; see\nDurukan and Tatlisumak 2007\n). The common carotid artery and the inserted suture were then permanently ligated.\nFor the rMCAO, the suture was inserted through the external carotid artery and advanced through the internal carotid artery (the Longa\u2019s method; see\nDurukan and Tatlisumak 2007\n). After suture placement, the external carotid artery was temporarily ligated and the skin wound was loosely sutured. Animals were split into two groups and were allowed to recover from anesthesia with the suture in for either 45 or 90 minutes (referred to as the rMAO\n45min\nand rMCAO\n90min\ngroup respectively in the following text). Different durations of occlusion were utilized to explore the relationship between the duration of ischemia, reperfusion, and seizure occurrence. The suture was then withdrawn under isoflurane anesthesia and the external carotid artery was permanently ligated.\nFor the MCAO-e, animals received a skin incision to expose the skull between the right ear and eye. A small hole was drilled through the skull, and the main ascending branch of the MCA was cauterized using a clinical-grade cautery (Bovie, Clearwater, FL, USA).\nAging mice that underwent either an irreversible ligation of the common carotid artery or a sham surgery were used as controls. The sham surgery consisted of surgical exposure of the common carotid artery in the anesthetized animal, followed by subsequent skin closure.\n\nDetection of early-onset seizures\nBaseline monitoring was performed 1 week after electrode implantation with continuous behavioral and EEG monitoring for up to 6 hours. To detect early-onset seizures following MCAO, animals were placed under continuous visual surveillance by experimenters with concurrent EEG recordings for the first 4\u20136 hours post-surgery, followed by overnight video monitoring for an additional 10\u201314 hours. Behavioral and EEG monitoring was resumed the next day and at later serial time points when permitted by animal survival.\nThe appearance of vigorous CS were exemplified by rapid running, jumping, barrel rolling (\u22653 turns), falling (loss of righting reflex) with tonic limb flexion, and repetitive tail erection (\nSupplementary video 1\nand\n2\n). These CS were in keeping with generalized tonic-clonic seizures described for rodent models in the past (\nVel\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 2006\n). Previous studies have reported similar CS in other mouse models (\nIvanov et al., 2004\n;\nMuramatsu et al., 2008\n;\nSilva-Fernandes et al., 2010\n;\nEl-Hayek et al., 2011a\n). Subtle or ambiguous convulsive behaviors, such as head nodding, jerking, and/or shaking were not classified as CS.\nIctal-like EEG discharges were defined as repetitive single-spike or poly-spike waveforms lasting \u22655 seconds in duration with amplitudes \u22652 times that of the background signals (\nWais et al., 2009\n;\nHe et al., 2009\n;\nJeffrey et al., 2014\n).\n\nAnticonvulsive drug treatments\nLorazepam (Ativan) and fosphenytoin (Cerebyx) were obtained in clinically available injectable forms (Sandoz Canada Inc. and Erfa Canada Inc., Quebec, Canada). These drugs were diluted in saline and administered via intra-peritoneal (IP) injections at dosages of 1.5mg/kg for lorazepam and 30mg/kg for fosphenytoin (equivalent to phenytoin 20mg/kg).\n\nBrain histology\nBrain histological assessments were conducted as previously described (\nWais et al., 2009\n;\nHe et al., 2009\n;\nEl-Hayek et al., 2011a\n). Animals were anesthetized using an IP injection of sodium pentobarbital (70 mg/kg) and then transcardially perfused with 10% neutral buffered formalin solution. The brain was removed and further fixed in 10% formalin with 20% sucrose. Cryostat coronal sections 30 \u03bcm thick were obtained of the entire brain and stained with cresyl-violet to evaluate gross brain injury at different post-ischemic time points (\nLiu and McCullough, 2011\n) and verify implanted electrode tracks in their appropriate anatomical locations. The timing of histological processing was dependent on animal survival. All aging mice with CS were processed at 24\u201348 hours post-ischemia due to early mortality (or mandatory euthanization) while CS-free aging mice survived for up to 10 weeks prior to processing. Images were obtained using a Leica (DMRN) upright microscope and analyzed using Image J software (National Institute of Health, USA).\nTo quantify the regions with weak cresyl-violet staining, the brightness and contrast of the Leica microscope captured images were adjusted to clearly demarcate boundaries. Only regions that were clearly stained lighter compared to adjacent areas were included for analysis. To assess ipsilateral edema or atrophy, the area of the ipsilateral hemisphere was normalized as a percentage of the corresponding contralateral hemisphere at 8 coronal levels (from bregma \u22123.2 to 1.9 mm;\nEl-Hayek et al., 2011a\n). Ipsilateral brain injury, defined as weakly stained areas, or cavities and scar tissue with visible margins, was also quantified as a percentage of the total ipsilateral area at the same 8 coronal levels.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical tests were done using the SigmaStat software (Systat Software Inc, San Jose, California, USA). A Student\u2019s t-test or Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test was used for two group comparisons. For multiple group comparisons, a one-way ANOVA was used, followed by a multiple comparison Dunn\u2019s test versus baseline control or a Holm-Sidak multiple comparison pairwise test. A Chi-square or Fischer exact test was used for rate comparisons. Data were presented as mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) throughout the text and figures. Statistical significance was set at the level of p\u22640.05."

    "Methods": "Overview\nAll animals used in the study were born at UC Irvine and shipped to Dartmouth post weaning in groups of 11\u201312 animals. On postnatal day 10 (P10) a total of 24 male rats experienced febrile status epilepticus (FSE) and 23 rats were used as normothermic controls (littermates of experimental group that were removed from the cage). At P10 FSE rat pups (N=24) underwent induction of febrile status epilepticus while normothermic control animals (N=23) underwent separation from the dam for a matched time period. A total of 25 rats were imaged for quantitative mapping of T2 relaxation time at high-field MRI at P10: 13 FSE rats and 11 normothermic controls were scanned 2 hours after the FSE or maternal separation in the controls. At age 2 months, all rats from (N=47) were trained to perform an active avoidance task in which they learned to avoid a shock zone on a rotating arena. When the rats were approximately 3 months old they were trained to pellet chase on the stable arena. A subset of control (N=8) and FSE animals (N=8) were then implanted with an array of micro-electrodes in each hippocampus that allowed for the recording of local field potentials and place cells during pellet chasing behavior.\nAll procedures were approved by local institutional animal care and use committee and conducted in accordance with guidelines from the National Institutes of Health.\n\nInduction of experimental FSE\nForty-seven male Sprague-Dawley rats were born and maintained in quiet facilities under controlled temperatures and light dark cycle. Their birth was timed within 12 hours and the date of birth was considered postnatal day (P) 0. On P2, mixed litters were culled to 10 pups, if needed. When weaned (on P21), male rats were housed 2\u20133 per cage and used in the current study. Experimental procedures were approved by UC-Irvine or Loma Linda University Institutional Animal Care Committees and conformed to NIH guidelines.\nFSE was induced as previously described for 24 rats (\nChen et al., 1999\n;\nDube et al., 2006\n;\nDube et al., 2010\n). Briefly, on P10, pups were placed in a glass container and their core temperature, which is highly correlated with brain temperature (\nDube et al., 2005\n), increased to approximately 40.5\u00b0C (simulating high fever) using a regulated stream of warm air. Core temperatures were measured at baseline, at seizure onset, and every 2 mins during the hyperthermia. Hyperthermic seizures manifest as characteristic behaviors: seizure onset is heralded by a sudden loss of motion (freezing), followed by oral automatisms and forelimb clonus. Seizures progress to body flexion with chewing of an extremity and one or more tonic stage 5 seizures. Hyperthermia (Maximum temperature: 41.5\u201342.9\u00b0C) was maintained for less than 34\u201338 mins (\nDube et al., 2010\n) resulting in behavioral seizures lasting an average of 36.8 mins (\u00b1 0.24 SEM). This was done in order to enhance clinical applicability. We modeled our experiment on clinical studies (\nBassan et al., 2013\n;\nScott et al., 2006\n;\nScott and Neville, 2009\n;\nShinnar et al., 2008\n) which defined febrile status epilepticus as a seizure associated with fever lasting longer than 30 mins.\nThe control group included 23 littermates of the experimental group that were removed from the cage for the same duration to control for potential stress and their core temperatures kept within normal range for age (normothermic controls).\n\nMRI protocol\nMRIs were performed on a Bruker Avance 11.7T MR scanner (Bruker Biospin, Billerica) as recently described (\nChoy et al., 2014\n). Thirteen FSE-sustaining rats and 11 littermate controls were scanned at 2 hours following FSE or, in the case of normothermic controls, removal from the home cage for a duration equivalent to hyperthermia and normal body temperatures were maintained. Rats were anesthetized for the duration of the imaging using 1.5% isoflurane in 100% O\n2\n. For each scan the animal was positioned prone on a cradle and body temperature was maintained using a thermostat-controlled warm water cushion. Scout images were obtained to accurately position the brain. A field-of-view of 2.3cm and a slice thickness of 0.75mm was used for all scans. T2-weighted images were acquired using 2D-Multi-Echo-Spin-Echo Sequence (2D-MESE) with the following parameters: TR = 4697 ms, TE = 10.21, 20.42, 30.63, 40.84, 51.05, 61.26, 71.47, 81.68, 91.89, and 102.1 ms, matrix size = 192 \u00d7 192, number of averages = 2, and 20 slices. Absolute T2 relaxation time values (ms) were calculated by log transform followed by a least squares fit on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and T2 maps were generated using in-house software (Matlab, Mathworks). All images were coded and analyzed without knowledge of treatment group. Regions were delineated manually and measured using ImageJ software (version 1.25l, NIH, Bethesda), and T2 times for bilateral regions were averaged for analysis. Regions delineated include brain, dorsal hippocampus, basolateral and medial amygdala, medial thalamus, cerebellum, prelimbic cortex, and auditory cortex.\n\nActive place avoidance behavioral task\nThe active place avoidance task (Biosignal; Brooklyn, New York) was developed to measure spatial memory and cognition (\nPastalkova et al., 2006\n;\nPopp et al., 2011\n). In this task, animals learn to associate an unmarked region of space with a mild shock on a constantly rotating arena. The rats must attend to their ever-changing position in the room frame lest they be rotated into a pre-determined shock zone where they receive a mildly painful electrical shock.\nAt approximately 2 months old, 23 control and 24 FSE rats were lightly anesthetized and implanted with a stainless steel swivel (Eagle Claw, USA) in the skin between the shoulders. This allowed attachment of a cable with an LED at the end that allows for automated tracking and also the delivery of shock. Experimenters were blind as to which animals were control and FSE.\nThe arena consists of a steel disc 82 cm in diameter and is lighted from both above and below. A white cue card with black diagonal lines was placed on the West wall (1.2m long and 0.75 m high) and a white cue was placed on the East wall (1.2 m long and 0.75 m high). Two proximal cue cards (45 cm long \u00d7 62 cm wide), one black (Color-Aid 9.5 gray) and one white (Color-Aid 2.5 grey) were placed approximately 20 cm from the periphery of the arena and were 135\u00b0 apart from center to center.\nOn day one of training, the animal was connected to the cable and allowed to explore the arena for 10 mins. On the second day, a clear plexiglass barrier was placed around the perimeter of the arena that rotated at a rate of one revolution per minute. The rat was again allowed to explore the arena for 10 mins. On all subsequent days, rats received a 0.2 ma shock in an unmarked 876 cm\n2\nwedge-shaped sector of the arena with a 60\u00b0 arc on the Southern edge of the arena (\nFigure 1A\n). This shock zone was stable in the room frame while the arena rotated. The entrance latency of the shock was 1 ms, the shock duration was 0.5 s and the inter-shock latency was 2 s.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nIllustration of the active avoidance task and behavioral results: A) Rats were tethered to a shock cable connected to a pin that was subcutaneously implanted on the back of the rat\u2019s neck. An LED at the end of the shock cable (indicated by green crosshair) was used to signal the rat\u2019s position in the room frame while the arena rotated counter-clockwise. The rat\u2019s path is indicated by black lines. When the rat entered the shock zone (gray sector in southern position), the rat received a mild electrical shock (indicated by open red circles); B) Dwell-time maps during habituation and training sessions. Red colors indicate more time while bluer colors indicate less time. The top row shows examples of avoidance behavior over several sessions (left to right) from a rat that learned to avoid (L=Learner). Note that over the course of training the rat spends more time in a more circumscribed region of the arena, far from the shock zone. The bottom row shows examples over several sessions from a rat that did not learn to avoid (Non-learner=NL). The final training session on the far right looks similar to the habituation session; C) The percentage of learners (L) and non-learners (NL) in the control (left) and FSE (right) groups.\nTraining was continued with two 10 minute sessions per day until criterion was met (\u2264 5 shocks within two consecutive sessions). As with previous work using this task by our group, training did not continue beyond 15 sessions (\nJenks et al., 2013\n). If criterion was not met by session 15, the rat was designated a non-learner.\n\nPellet chasing\nApproximately 1 month following behavioral training in active avoidance, rats were food deprived within 85% of their pre-deprivation body weight and trained to chase sugar pellets on the arena. The pellets dropped randomly from an overhead feeder every 30 secs. Pellet-chasing training continued for approximately 20 mins a day for 5 consecutive days.\n\nSurgery\nAt approximately 3 months old 7 control and 8 FSE rats underwent implantation of a bilateral array of recording electrodes. The rats were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic frame. The skull was exposed and four screws inserted, two anterior to the left and right ends of bregma and two left and right over the cerebellum. Grounding was achieved via the right cerebellar screw.\nRats were chronically prepared with a custom implant (Versadrive; Neuralynx, Montana) that allowed for LFP and single cell recording from a 2 \u00d7 2 array of tetrodes in both the left and right hippocampus (\u2212 3.8 AP, \u00b1 3.8 ML, set at \u00b1 10\u00b0). All tetrodes were made from 25 \u03bcm diameter nichrome wire (A-M systems; Carlsborg, WA), wound with programmable servo motors and cut square. The tips of these tetrodes were placed 2.0 mm below the skull surface. For all implants, each tetrode wire was gold plated before implantation until the impedance was between 80\u2013130 KOhms.\nAll implants were fixed to the skull via the skull screws and Grip Cement (Dentsply Inc.). The wound was sutured and topical antibiotic applied. The interval between surgery and the beginning of the cell screening process was 1 week.\n\nElectrophysiology\nRats were tethered to a recording cable while they foraged for sugar pellets. Signals from the brain were pre-amplified X1 at the headstage and channeled through the tether cable to the signal amplifiers and computer interface. Tetrode signals were sampled at 33 KHz and filtered at 300\u20136000 Hz (Neuralynx, Montana) for single units, subsampled at 3000 Hz and filtered at 1\u20139000 Hz for LFPs. All signals were referenced against a tetrode wire in the neocortex. The rat\u2019s location in the arena was sampled at 60 Hz (Biosignal, Brooklyn, USA). The activity of individual units was separated offline into different clusters based on their waveform properties. Waveform properties were defined in 3 dimensional feature space (Offline Sorter, Plexon, Dallas, TX) by first comparing peak amplitude across all 4 wires of the recording tetrode. Further processing was performed by using the waveform projection of the first principal component (PC1),\nPC\n1\n=\n\u2211\np\n1\n(\nt\n)\n\u2217\nw\n(\nt\n)\nWhere w(t) = [w(1),\u2026,w(n)] is the waveform (n=number of points in a waveform), and p1(t)=[p1(1),\u2026,p1(n)] is the first principal component vector.\nThe raw data recordings comprised of a series of action potential time stamps for each isolated cluster and a 30 Hz series of time stamped x and y co-ordinates for tracking LEDs mounted on the preamplifier connected to the implant. A 64 by 64 element firing rate array (\nMuller et al., 1987\n) for each cell cluster was first constructed (custom Matlab software; Mathworks); each element corresponded to a square pixel 3.5 cm on a side. To make the spatial firing rate array, the number of spikes for each cell was counted for each element and were speed filtered to only include epochs where the rat\u2019s movement was greater than 3 cm/s. The total time spent by the animal was then accumulated for each element. In these firing rate maps, yellow pixels represent regions in which the firing rate was exactly zero. Increasing firing rates are represented in the color order: orange, red, green, blue, purple. The number key for each map shows the median firing rate for each color category. Pixels never visited by the rat are white.\n\nFiring field properties\nOnly units that were determined to be pyramidal cells (\nRobbins et al., 2013\n) were considered for analysis. In the case of multiple fields, only the largest sub-field was considered. The firing fields of cells were also required to meet the following criteria:\nFiring rate: The number of spikes fired by the cell in the firing field divided by dwell-time in the field. Only cells with an average in-field firing rate < 9Hz were include in the data set. This threshold was set to avoid including putative interneurons in the dataset.\nFiring field coherence: Nearest-neighbor 2-D firing rate autocorrelation (\nMuller and Kubie, 1989\n). Field coherence is calculated in three steps. First, parallel lists are constructed for the firing rate in each pixel and the average firing rate in the eight nearest neighbors. Next, the product\u2013moment correlation between the two lists is calculated. Coherence itself is defined as the z-transform of the correlation [z= 1/2 ln (1 + x / 1 \u2212 x)]; it estimates the local smoothness of the spatial firing distribution. Coherence values > 0.3 are considered to be place cells (\nMuller and Kubie, 1989\n).\nField size: The field size of firing fields ranged between a minimum of 9 contiguous pixels and a maximum of 700 pixels (approximately 60% of the arena surface).\n\nScreening and recording protocols\nDuring cell screening sessions, animals were placed on the arena without food pellets. If no units could be isolated, the tetrode drives were lowered. In the case of hippocampal electrode placements, the electrodes were advanced until the activity of at least 10 pyramidal cells could be isolated. Only cells recorded from layer CA1 in the dorsal hippocampus were included in the analysis. A recording session would then begin and the rat would pellet chase for approximately 30 mins.\nAt the end of the recording session the electrodes were advanced to contact new cells and to optimize the number of simultaneously recorded cells. The rats would then be screened again the next day.\n\nDetection of interictal spikes\nInterictal spikes were counted during foraging sessions for each rat by an observer (GLH) blinded to group. Interictal spikes were defined as sharply contoured waveforms that were distinctly different than on-going background EEG activity. By definition, spikes were were differentiated from physiological sharp waves by their shorter duration (<70 msec) and were typically followed by a slow wave (\nKleen et al., 2010\n;\nStaley and Dudek, 2006\n).\n\nStatistical analyses\nIndependent t-tests were used to identify differences in regional T2 relaxation times between FSE and control animals, as well as between the learning and non-learning FSE animals. The Holm-Bonferroni method (\nHolm, 1979\n) was used to correct for multiple comparisons between FSE learners and non-learners by controlling for the Familywise error rate by applying stricter significance criteria to the smallest p-values. We then employed Cox Regression analyses to identify differences in the number of sessions required for FSE animals to reach criterion in the place avoidance task when compared to controls, adjusting for T2 relaxation time. This adjustment allows us to evaluate whether there is a difference in time to reaching criterion for any given T2 relaxation time thereby allowing inferences about the impact of T2 relaxation time on the ability to learn the avoidance task..\nAs the place cell dataset contains data from multiple sessions in single animals, the assumptions of independence of observations are invalid. The observations within single animals are likely to be correlated, and these data can be represented as a cluster. In this case, the existence of a relationship between different firing field properties, within an individual animal, may then be assumed (\nZiegler et al., 1998\n). In this study we use generalized estimating equations (GEE), a class of regression marginal model, for exploring multivariable relationships between clustered response data and outcome measures. We examined whether the firing field properties, coherence, in-field firing rate and field size, differed between controls, FSE learners and FSE non-learners."

    "Methods": "2.1 Animals\nAnimal colonies were held on a 12h:12h light:dark cycle, group housed, and provided food and water\nad libitum\n. All animal procedures were approved and performed in compliance with the Michigan State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the standards in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n97Q model\nTg animals ubiquitously overexpressing a full length human AR with a 97 glutamine repeat and Wt age-matched controls were maintained on a C57Bl/6J genetic background. Mice were genotyped using PCR at weaning as previously described (\nKatsuno et al., 2002\n).\nMyogenic model\nTg animals overexpressing the rat Wt AR exclusively in skeletal muscle fibers and Wt age-matched controls were maintained on a C57Bl/6J genetic background. Mice were genotyped using PCR at weaning as previously described (\nMonks et al., 2007\n). Tg and Wt males were exposed prenatally to flutamide, an antiandrogen, to block the effects of prenatal endogenous androgens to enhance survival rate of Tg males neonatally (\nJohansen et al., 2011\n). Because survival of Tg females is not affected, females used in our studies were from litters not exposed to flutamide prenatally. In each case, Wt controls used in a given study were treated in the same way as the Tg mice.\n\n2.2 Gonadally intact males\nWe examined BDNF mRNA expression in the fast twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and slow twitch soleus muscles of adult, gonadally intact age-matched Wt and Tg males (mean age and range in postnatal days: 97Q: 69.1, 59-76; myogenic: 180.4, 171-194). We also assessed BDNF mRNA in lumbar spinal cords of the same Tg and Wt males of the two models. Tissue was harvested from chronically impaired myogenic males with severe motor dysfunction, comparable to what has previously been reported for this Tg model (\nJohansen et al., 2011\n;\nMonks et al., 2007\n). Tissue was harvested from 97Q males once they reached end-stage, defined as hang time < 30 sec (see description of test below).\n\n2.3 Castrated males\n97Q model\nTg and Wt males were castrated (Tg+Castrate, Wt+Castrate) or sham castrated (Tg+Sham, Wt+Sham) on postnatal day 28-32, before symptoms emerged as previously described (\nRenier et al., 2014\n). We monitored motor function twice weekly starting on the day of but prior to surgery, until gonadally intact (Tg+Sham) males reached end-stage (hang time <30 sec), at which point it and its age-matched controls (Tg+Castrate, Wt+Castrate and Wt+Sham) were sacrificed and muscles harvested (mean age and range in postnatal days: 77.8, 55-104).\nMyogenic model\nSince chronically affected adult myogenic males recover motor function after castration (\nKemp et al., 2011\n;\nMonks et al., 2007\n), we castrated a cohort of age-matched adult Tg and Wt brothers to assess whether expression of BDNF mRNA in skeletal muscle of diseased males also recovers. Tg and Wt males were either castrated (Tg+Castrate, Wt+Castrate) or sham castrated (Tg+Sham, Wt+Sham)(mean age and range of postnatal days at castration: 106.3, 87-133). Motor function (described below) was monitored starting on the day of but just before surgery and on days 2, 4, 6, 8, 14, and 21 after surgery. Animals were sacrificed after the last motor test.\n\n2.4 Androgen treated females\nTg females offer the experimental advantage in that disease is triggered in this model by exposure to male levels of testosterone (T). Thus, the time of disease onset is known and readily controlled, making this model ideal for examining the time course of change in muscle BDNF mRNA as disease develops. We first examined whether acutely diseased females (age matched to Wt females) exposed to five days of T show the same deficit in muscle BDNF as chronically diseased myogenic males (mean age and range in postnatal days: 117.7, 101-178). Treatment was delivered via Silastic capsules containing either crystalline T (effective release length: 6mm, inner diameter: 1mm, outer diameter: 3mm; soaked in sterile phosphate-buffered saline overnight) or nothing (\u201cBlank\u201d) implanted subcutaneously just caudal to the scapula under deep isoflurane anesthesia. Such T capsules produce T levels slightly below normal circulating levels for adult male mice (\nJohansen et al., 2009\n). Motor function of female mice was assessed immediately prior to surgery and daily during the five day treatment period, with tissue harvested on the final day of motor testing.\nBecause acutely disease myogenic (Tg) females also show a deficit in muscle BDNF mRNA after five days of T exposure, we next asked how soon the deficit emerges. We used a separate cohort of age-matched Tg and Wt females to assess BDNF mRNA levels in muscle after 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days of T exposure, monitoring motor function daily based on the hang test (mean age and range in postnatal days: 97.5, 81-130).\n\n2.5 Motor function tests\nMotor function was assessed using three different measures: number of rears in an open field, grip strength, and hang time as previously described (\nJohansen et al., 2011\n). The hang test provides a measure of overall limb strength. If the hang time on the first try was less than the maximum time possible, 120 sec, then mice were given two more tries with the highest score recorded for that session on that day.\n\n2.6 Tissue collection\nThe EDL and/or soleus were collected on both sides from deeply anesthetized mice. Lumbar spinal cords were quickly extracted with pressurized air. All tissue was weighed fresh and immediately frozen in RNase-free tubes on dry ice, and held at \u221280\u00b0C until processed. All instruments were sprayed with RNaseZap (Sigma-Aldrich) between animal harvests. Additionally, blood was collected intracardially and plasma isolated to measure circulating plasma T levels as previously described (\nJohansen et al., 2009\n).\n\n2.7 RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR\nRNA extraction was performed for muscles with RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen). To improve RNA yield for spinal cords, we used TRIzol reagent (Ambion). Tissue was mechanically homogenized with a PRO200 homogenizer (Pro Scientific). RNA was purified for each type of tissue according to the respective manufacturer directions. Spinal cord RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Invitrogen). A DNase treatment step is included as part of the Qiagen protocol for muscles. Following extraction, RNA was quantified on a spectrophotometer (Beckman DU 530) by measuring 260 nm absorbance values. RNA for both muscles and lumbar spinal cord was then reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) with the following thermocycle: 25\u00b0C for 10 min, 37\u00b0C for 2 h, 85\u00b0C for 5 min. Each sample for quantitative real-time PCR assay included 2.5 ng of cDNA, primers, and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Thermocycle for the quantitative step on the ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System was as follows: 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 sec and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. A dissociation curve was determined for each well to confirm that the correct gene was being amplified. Each sample was run in triplicate. Samples without reverse transcriptase during the cDNA conversion were also assessed to ensure that there was no DNA contamination. The reference genes were Cyclophilin A (200nM primers: ccactgtcgcttttcgccgc and cccaagggctcgtcatcggc), GAPDH (200nM primers: ccccagcaaggacactgagcaag and tctgggatggaaattgtgagggaga), \u03b2-actin (200nM primers: ttcgttgccggtccacaccc and tttgcacatgccggagccgt), and 18s (100nM primers: either ggaccagagcgaaagcatttg and gccagtcggcatcgtttatg or ttgacggaagggcaccaccag and gcaccaccacccacggaatcg). The reference gene was chosen for each experiment by confirming that levels were equivalent between treatment groups. Transcripts of two non-coding and one coding (i.e., total) BDNF exons were quantified: BDNF IV (200nM primers: ctccgccatgcaatttccac and cgagtctttggtggccgata), BDNF VI (200nM primers: gtgacaacaatgtgactccac and gccttcatgcaaccgaagta), and BDNF IX (200nM primers: gcggcagataaaaagactgc and tcagttggcctttggatacc). We measured an additional non-coding transcript in spinal cord, BDNF II (100nM primers: aaccttttcctcctcctgcg and gagccgaacctcggaaaaga), as this transcript is highly expressed in neural tissue but not in muscle (\nAid et al., 2007\n). We also measured levels of BDNF\u2019s receptors in muscle and spinal cord: full length TrkB (400nM primers: ggcaacttcgggaaaggaga and gtaaacccctcaccgcctac), truncated TrkB (600nM primers: ccattgccctctgctaacca and gagatctgaggtgctctcgc), and p75 (200 nM primers: cgtgaccatctcaggccttt and ggtgcccctgttaccttctc). Optimal concentrations and amplification efficiencies were calculated for each primer set.\n\n2.8 Statistical analysis\nRelative Expression Software Tool (REST) was used to assess statistical significance and fold change of genes (\nPfaffl et al., 2002\n). Specifically, this software uses the non-parametric Pair-Wise Fixed Reallocation Randomisation Test to account for amplification efficiencies when determining fold change. It measures relative expression of a target gene (BDNF, TrkB, p75) between two experimental groups following the normalization of the target gene to a reference gene (Cyclophilin A, GAPDH, \u03b2-actin, or 18s).\nWe performed a two-factor between subjects analysis of variance to test whether genotype (Tg or Wt) or treatment (sham versus castrate (in males); T versus blank (in females)) influenced motor ability on the day of tissue harvest. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons with a Bonferroni correction were used to determine significant differences between planned comparisons."

    "Methods": "Animal model and experimental group\nAnimal procedures for this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University (Beijing, China). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (280-300g) were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery as descried previously (\nZhao\net al.\n2014\n). Right MCAO was induced using the modified intraluminal filament method (\nTajiri\net al.\n2013\n,\nQi\net al.\n2014\n). The animals underwent 90min of MCAO and then were reperfused for 22.5h by careful withdrawal of the filament. Successful MCAO was assessed by circling to the non-ischemic side (left) at the end of ischemia, then further confirmed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining at the end of reperfusion (see\nInfarct measurement\nbelow).\nTwenty eight rats with successful MCAO were divided at random into four groups: normoxia, NBO, DMSO and TPEN (n=7 in each group). Three rats with unsuccessful MCAO were excluded from this study. No rats died due to surgical or stroke complications.\n\nNBO and TPEN treatment\nTen min after the onset of MCAO, the animals were put into an anesthesia box, which delivered 100% oxygen (NBO, 5L/min) and lasted until the start of reperfusion (\nLiu\net al.\n2006\n). The normoxic rats underwent similar treatment except for ventilation with air (21% O\n2\n, 5 L/min).\nA specific zinc chelator, N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN, Sigma-Aldrich), was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich) and then further diluted into physiological saline with 20% DMSO. TPEN (15mg/kg) was administrated by intraperitoneal injection at 30min prior to MCAO onset. In our previous study, we found that 15 mg/kg of TPEN by intraperitoneal injection 30min before MCAO were able to reduce infarct volume and block zinc activities following ischemia (\nZhao\net al.\n2014\n). Therefore, intraperitoneal injection TPEN (15mg/kg) 30min before the onset of MCAO was chosen in this study. The vehicle DMSO (20% in saline) was given to rats as the control group.\n\nTissue collection, infarct measurement and penumbra identification\nRats were decapitated after 22.5 h of reperfusion. Brains were quickly removed and sectioned into four 2-mm thick slices from an 8-mm thick region 5mm away from the tip of the frontal lobe. The first and third slice were prepared for isolating cerebral mitochondria. The fourth slice was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C for zinc staining.\nThe second slice was stained with 1% TTC solution at 37\u00b0C for 20min. The infarct volume was measured using the TTC-stained slice as described previously (\nSwanson\net al.\n1990\n). The non-infarcted area in the ipsilateral brain was subtracted from that in the contralateral brain. The infarct volume was calculated as a percentage of the volume of the contralateral brain. In TTC assay, 7 rats were used in each group to confirm the success of MCAO model and to calculate infarct volume. Then, 4 rats were randomly chosen out of 7 rats for other assays in each group.\nPenumbral tissue is operationally defined as the ischemic area that will undergo apoptosis without treatment, but is rescued with treatment (\nFord\net al.\n2012\n,\nZhu\net al.\n2012\n). The differences in infarct area between NBO (TPEN) groups and normoxic (DMSO) groups were considered as the penumbra (\nFig. 1A\n) as our previous studies described (\nLiu\net al.\n2004\n).\nFigure 1. Zinc accumulation in different brain regions during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.\nOpen in a new tab\nA.\nThe illustration of ischemic penumbra (P), core and contralateral (Contr) regions in a rat brain section. Representative co-stained images of zinc-specific NG staining (green) and nuclear specific indicator DAPI (blue) in the contralateral tissues\n(B)\n, the penumbra\n(C)\nand the core\n(D).\nScale bar=10\u03bcm.\nAs illustrated in\nFig.1A\n, brain tissue in black rectangle was collected for isolating mitochondria and then mitochondria-related assay. The images from small orange rectangle were selected as the representatives of the penumbra in NG or RhodZin-3 staining.\n\nCytosolic zinc staining\nBrain sections (20\u03bcm) were stained with the zinc-selective membrane-impermeable fluorescent indicator Newport Green (NG, Invitrogen) to detect cytosolic free zinc. Sections were washed in PBS and incubated with NG (10\u03bcM) and DAPI (a nuclear specific marker) in the dark for 3min. After washing in PBS, images were acquired with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon 80i, Japan) and analyzed with Leica Qwin software (\nZhao\net al.\n2014\n). Three different areas in the penumbra from each rat were selected to count NG-positive cells and analyze fluorescent intensity. The fluorescent intensity was assessed after subtraction of background fluorescent intensity.\n\nIsolation of brain mitochondria\nHighly purified mitochondria were isolated from non-ischemic and ischemic brain tissues, according to the manufacturer's protocol of a Qproteome mitochondria isolation kit (Qiagen). Brain tissues (200mg) were cut into pieces and incubated in 500\u03bcL ice-cold Lysis Buffer with protease inhibitors. Homogenization of the sample was performed using the Tissue Ruptor rotor-stator homogenizer for 10s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000\u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and the cell pellets were resuspended in 1.5mL ice-cold Disruption Buffer by pipetting up and down using a 1mL pipette tip. The lysate was centrifuged at 1000\u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 6000\u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C.\nThe pellet containing full active intact mitochondria was collected and resuspended in Storage Buffer and stored at -80\u00b0C for further analysis. To avoid the excess injury, the mitochondria were pipetted gently and they appear aggregated in the images shown in figures.\n\nMeasurements of zinc levels in mitochondria\nFree zinc in mitochondria was measured using a mitochondrial-specific fluorescent zinc indicator RhodZin-3 (Invitrogen)(\nBonanni\net al.\n2006\n). Two methods were used in this study to evaluate zinc level in mitochondria within the penumbra.\nQuantification of zinc levels in isolated mitochondria. Isolated mitochondria were co-stained with RhodZin-3(10\u03bcM, Invitrogen) and mitochondrial membrane potential-independent probe Mito Tracker Green (MTG, 100nM, Invitrogen) for 45 min at room temperature. Mitochondrial zinc fluorescence was detected using a fluorescence microplate reader in a spectrophotometer (Thermo fisher) at 550/575nm and 490/516nm as excitation/emission wavelengths, respectively. The fluorescence of MTG here was used as a loading control for the amount of mitochondria.\nCo-staining of zinc with neuronal cells in brain sections of ischemic rats. Brain sections were co-stained with RhodZin-3 and NeuN (a neuronal specific marker, Millipore). Brain sections (20 \u03bcm) were fixed in cold acetone for 10 min and blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1h. Sections were incubated with anti-NeuN (1: 500) as the primary antibody, followed by AlexaFluor488 anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) as the secondary antibody. The sections were then stained with RhodZin-3 (150nM) for 45min. Images were performed on a fluorescence microscope.\n\nAnalysis of mitochondrial membrane potential\nTo detect variations of mitochondrial membrane potential, we utilized a lipophilic cation5,5\u2032,6,6\u2032-tetrachloro-1,1\u2032,3,3\u2032-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) kit (Genmed), according to the protocol of manufacturer. JC-1 is capable of entering into mitochondria and exhibits potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria. Mitochondrial depolarization is indicated by a decrease in the red/green fluorescence of JC-1. Briefly, isolated mitochondria (10 \u03bcL, about 5\u03bcg mitochondrial proteins) were incubated in JC-1 staining buffer for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. Images were then performed on a fluorescence microscope. The fluorescence was assessed using a fluorescence microplate reader (Thermo fisher) at 490/516nm (green) and 490/590nm (red) as excitation/emission wavelengths, respectively. The ratio of red/green intensity was measured to evaluate the membrane potential of isolated mitochondria from each group.\n\nWestern blot assay for mitochondrial cytochrome C\nIsolated mitochondria were incubated with lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150mM NaCl, 5mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.05% Brij-35, 1% Triton X-100) for 30min for SDA-PAGE. All blots were probed with cytochrome C antibody (1:500, BD Biosciences). The membranes were re-probed with anti-COX4 (1:500, Proteintech) as loading control.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Statistical analysis was performed using student\nt\n-tests or ANOVA. A value of\np\n<0.05 was considered statistical significance."

    "Methods": "Astrocyte-meningeal fibroblast co-culture\nMethods to prepare co-cultures of astrocytes and meningeal cells (predominantly fibroblasts, but also microglia and blood vessels) were similar to those reported in\nWanner et al. (2008\n,\n2012)\n. Astrocytes were cultured from neonatal rat cerebral cortices in 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone, Logan, UT) and upon reaching confluency, cultures were switched to a mixture of 1:1 DMEM and Ham\u2019s F12 (D/F medium, Gibco) supplemented with 5% horse serum. Approximately 200,000 astrocytes were seeded onto deformable membranes (962 mm\n2\nBioflex 6 well plates, Flexcell Int. Corp., Hillsborough, NC) previously coated with collagen (\nFig. 1\n; control culture). Astrocyte cultures were slowly withdrawn from serum and kept serum-free until the addition of meningeal cells.\nFigure 1. Schematic of experimental design and timeline.\nOpen in a new tab\nExperiments were conducted on either quiescent astrocytes (control) or co-cultures of stretched astrocytes and meningeal fibroblasts (scar-like). Mature astrocytes (light blue background) were cultured on deformable membranes and first confronted with fibroblasts to induce astrogliosis (dark blue background). Then astrocyte-fibroblast co-cultures were mechanically stretched 5\u20136 hours prior to the addition of OECs labeled with Cell Tracker Green (scar-like + OEC). One day later, cerebral cortical neurons (P6\u2013P8) were added to all experimental conditions. Neurons were grown for 24 hours and fixed.\nMeningeal fibroblasts were isolated from newborn rat cortical meninges, dissociated and resuspended with 3% trypsin, collagenase, and DNAse I. They were grown for 5 days on poly-L-lysine-coated dishes (PLL; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Meningeal fibroblasts were added to the astrocytes on deformable membranes after 4 weeks\nin vitro\nwith 130,000 cells per culture in 10% FBS/DF medium (\nFig. 1\n). Astrocyte-fibroblast co-cultures grown on deformable membranes were given two short pressure pulses (3.5\u20133.8 psi) with a pressure controller (\nEllis et al., 1995\n) that induced abrupt membrane deformation and mechanical trauma to the cells (\nFig. 1\n; scar-like culture).\n\nOEC primary culture\nOlfactory bulbs were collected from 8\u201310 weeks old Sprague Dawley rats and the leptomeninges were removed to reduce fibroblast contamination. Methods to prepare OEC primary cultures were adopted from\nRam\u00f3n-Cueto et al. (2000)\n. OECs were dissected from the first two layers of the olfactory bulb and washed in Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Gibco, Rockville, MD) prior to tissue centrifugation at 365 g for 5 min. The tissue pellet was first resuspended in 0.1% trypsin and HBSS without Ca\n2+\n/Mg\n2+\n(Gibco), then placed in a 37\u00b0C water bath, and mixed intermittently for 10 min. D/F medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S, Gibco) was used to inactivate trypsin prior to centrifugation. Dissociated cells were rinsed and centrifuged 3 times, and then plated into 25 cm\n2\nculture flasks pre-coated with 0.5 mg/ml PLL. Cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C for 7 days and D/F medium was changed every 2 days.\n\nOEC immunopurification\nHydrophobic petri dishes were coated overnight with Biotin-SP-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) in 50 mM Tris buffer. Dishes were washed 4 times with 25mM PBS (Gibco) and then incubated overnight with antibody against p75-nerve growth factor receptor (anti-p75-NGFR, 1:5; clone 192,\nChandler et al., 1984\n) at 4\u00b0C. Dishes were rinsed 3 times with 25mM PBS and treated with a mixture of PBS and 0.5% BSA for 1 hr at room temperature. Before immunopanning cells, antibody treated dishes were washed with PBS and DMEM.\nOEC primary cultures were treated with 0.25% trypsin in HBSS without Ca\n2+\n/Mg\n2+\nfor 3 mins at 37\u00b0C before trypsin inactivation with D/F medium. Cells were centrifuged at 216 g for 10 mins and resuspended in D/F medium. Cells were added to pre-treated anti-p75-NGFR dishes and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 mins. Unbound cells were washed off and a cell scraper was used to recover bound cells which were then subjected to a second immunopanning. Purified p75-NGFR-positive OECs were resuspended, plated on PLL-coated culture flasks, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 7 days with medium changed every 2 days. Purified OECs were stimulated with pituitary extract (20 \u03bcg/ml, Gibco) and forskolin (2 \u03bcM, Sigma). Mitogens were removed and cells were pretreated with CellTracker\n\u2122\nGreen CMFDA (7 \u03bcM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. After rinsing, OECs were incubated with D/F medium for 1 hr, washed with PBS, and trypsinized. 100,000 OECs were added to the scar-like cultures 5\u20136 hours after the mechanical stretch (\nFig. 1\n; scar-like + OEC culture).\n\nCerebral cortical neuron cultures\nNeurons were obtained from postnatal day 6\u20138 rat cerebral cortices after removal of the leptomeninges. Cerebral cortices were harvested in Hibernate-A medium (BrainBits, Inc., Springfield, IL) with P/S, L-glutamine (L-glu, Gibco), and B27 supplement (Gibco), then chopped and digested with warm papain (2 mg/ml, Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) in Hibernate-A medium with P/S and L-glu. Neurons were enriched with an OptiPrep step gradient (Axis-Shield, Norton, MA). One day after stretch, all cultures received 100,000 neurons pipetted into the center of the culture (\nFig. 1\n). After 24 hrs, cultures were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 hr and washed. Additional 24-hour co-cultures were tested for neuron viability and most neurons without processes co-localized with live uptake of propidium iodide, indicating loss of cell integrity. Four independent culture experiments were conducted and 1\u20133 wells per experiment were analyzed for each experimental variable.\n\nImmunocytochemical procedures\nCultures were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton in TBS for 30 mins, blocked with 5% donkey and goat serum (Sigma) overnight, incubated with anti-GFAP (1:500, mouse or rabbit, BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Jose, CA; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and rabbit anti-\u03b23 tubulin (1:1500, Covance, Berkeley, CA) or mouse anti-fibronectin (1:500, BD Biosciences Pharmingen) overnight at 4\u00b0C. To visualize immunostaining, Cy3- and Cy5-conjugated fluorescent secondaries (1:250, 1:80, respectively; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) were used. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye (Sigma) for 5 mins. Cultures were washed with TBS, dried, and then cover slipped onto glass slides with Fluorogel (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA).\n\nImaging, neuron tracing, and statistical analysis\nImages were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Approximately 16 fields from the central-most area of the stretch wells that contained GFAP-negative zones and multiple neurons were analyzed for neurite outgrowth. Peripheral areas were excluded for consistency. Neurons and their neurites were quantified and traced using the Neurolucida 7.50.4 neuron reconstruction program (MicroBrightField, Inc., Williston, VT). Individual neurite lengths and cell body details were exported to Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA) using Neurolucida Explorer 4.50.4 (MicroBrightField, Inc., Williston, VT). Neurite processes were measured and the extent of their glial association was scored as aligned, crossing, or not associated. Additionally, neurons and neurite processes were binned based on their location in either a GFAP-positive or negative area. Neurons were counted in the GFAP-negative fibroblast zone only if neurites remained entirely within the GFAP-negative area. Neuron counts were normalized per image and reported as the sum of neurons analyzed in all 16 fields of each culture. Culture experiments were conducted in triplicate or quadruplicate and data sets presented as a mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analyses of differences between means was calculated using a two-way ANOVA, performed with JMP Software (version 10.0.0 for Microsoft Windows, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Statistical significance was determined by\np\n< 0.05."

Npc1 genotype was determined with PCR method as previously described (\nBaudry\net al.\n, 2003\n). Animals were housed under controlled temperature on a 12/12-h light/dark cycle and given access to water and a standard rodent diet ad libitum. The use of animals was conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and animal husbandry, care and experimental protocols were approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR\nTotal RNA (1\u20132 \u03bcg) was reversed transcribed into cDNA with oligo (dT) using SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction (Invitrogen). cDNA was amplified by primer pairs specific for MMP-12 (5\u2032-TTT CTT CCA TAT GGC CAA GC-3\u2032 forward, 5\u2032-GGT CAA AGA CAG CTG CAT CA-3\u2032reverse). GAPDH primers (5\u2032-AAC TTT GGC ATT GTG GAA GG-3\u2032forward, 5\u2032-ACA CAT TGG GGG TAG GAA CA-3\u2032reverse) were used as internal control. Quantitative real-time PCR was done with Applied Biosystem 7300 real-time PCR system (Foster City, CA) using SYBR-Green. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate and the relative quantification of gene expression was performed with the comparative cycle number measured with the threshold (C\nT\n) method (\nLiao\net al.\n, 2010\n).\n\nDrug treatment\nMMP-12-inhibitor (MMP408, Millipore, Billerica, MA) was dissolved in a vehicle solution of 50% DMSO to make a stock solution. At postnatal day (P) 7\u20139, Npc1\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type mice were randomly assigned to either vehicle or MMP-12 inhibitor treatment group and given daily subcutaneous injections for 21\u201323 days.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were sacrificed by deep anesthesia with pentobarbital, and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were cut into 30 \u03bcm coronal or sagittal sections for forebrain and cerebellum, respectively. For immunohistochemistry, floating tissue sections were washed in 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB), blocked with 10% horse serum and 4% goat serum; sections were then incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Sections were then washed with PB before being incubated with secondary antibodies (conjugated with Alexa-594 or Alexa-488). After four more washes, sections were then mounted onto Superfrost\u00ae plus slides (VWR, West Chester, PA). Images were taken by a blind observer using the Nikon EZ-C1 software ver. 2.10; the same acquisition parameters were used across different experimental groups and images were analyzed with ImageJ software. Antibodies used were: MMP-12 antibody (1:25, Santa Cruz Technology, Santa Cruz, CA or 1:1000 Abcam, Cambridge, MA), EMMPRIN antibody (1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), CNPase antibody (1:250, Millipore, Temecula, CA), SMI-312 (1:1000, Convance, San Diego, CA), and MBP (1:500, Santa Cruz). Quantification of MMP-12 immunoreactivity in the cerebellar cortex was done with images taken with a 100\u00d7 objective from the same region in the same lobe among different experimental animals, and 3 mice per group were used. Quantification of neurofilament (SMI-312)-ir areas of fasciculated bundles in the striatum was performed on images of the caudoputamen taken with a 20\u00d7 objective at the same coronal level from different mice. Means of SMI-312-ir areas were first obtained from at least 2\u20134 sections per mouse and group means were then calculated from 3\u20137 different mice for each experimental group and were expressed as percentage of values from wild-type mice.\n\nWestern blots\nMice were decapitated under deep anesthesia and tissues from different brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, brainstem) were collected.

Total proteins (10 \u03bcg) were separated on 8\u201310% SDS gels and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies in 1% bovine serum albumin followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Peroxidase reaction was developed with the ECL-plus detection kit. The following primary antibodies were used: Anti-MMP-12 antibody (1:10000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA), and anti-GAPDH antibody (1:30,000, Millipore) was used as loading control. Images were analyzed with ImageJ software. For all experiments, samples from wild-type and Npc1\u2212/\u2212 mice were loaded onto the sample gels and protein levels were first normalized against GADPH before any comparison analysis.\n\nPC-12 cell experiments\nPC-12 cells (CRL1721) were purchased from ATCC and cultured at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO\n2\nin RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum (Sigma, St. Louis, MI) and 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were seeded in Poly-L-lysine (P1524, Sigma) coating glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA) for two days before differentiation with nerve growth factor (300 ng/ml, Sigma) for 10 days. Npc1 siRNA (\nStrauss\net al.\n, 2010\n) (100 pmol, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and scrambled control siRNA were transfected together with a GFP plasmid (2 \u03bcg) immediately before differentiation using the X-tremeGENE-siRNA transfection kit according to the manufacturer instructions (Roche). MMP-12 inhibitor (MMP408, 500 nM, Abcam) (\nLi\net al.\n, 2009a\n;\nLi\net al.\n, 2009b\n) was added 4 h after transfection. Nine days after transfection, cells were fixed with 2% PFA for 15 min; cells were then examined and imaged using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S) and a DS camera from Nikon. Neuritic length was measured as previously described using NIH ImageJ software (\nDas\net al.\n, 2004\n). Data were expressed as means of four sets of individual experiments; for each experiment at least 25\u201326 cells per group were analyzed and averaged values were used to calculate group means.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as means \u00b1 S.E.M. For experiments where only two groups were compared, two-tail t-test was used for determining statistical significance. When more than 2 groups were compared, we used one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test to determine statistical significance. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY) or\nCharles River (Kingston, NY) and bred in-house. They were weaned at 21\u201323\ndays of age and then housed with 1\u20132 others in standard rat cages with corn\ncob bedding and a 12 hr light:dark cycle (lights on, 7:00 a.m.). Standard rat chow\n(Purina 5001, W.F. Fisher, Somerville, NJ) and water were providedad\nlibitum. Animal care and use met the National Institutes of Health and\nNew York State guidelines. All chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO)\nunless otherwise stated.\n\nInduction of SE\nAnimals were placed 1/cage at approximately 9:00 a.m. SE was induced\neither by KA or pilocarpine. For KA-induced SE, only KA (12 mg/kg, s.c.) was\nadministered.\nFor SE induction using pilocarpine, animals were injected first with\nthe muscarinic cholinergic antagonist atropine methylbromide (1 or 2.5\nmg/kg, s.c.) to reduce the peripheral effects of pilocarpine. Pilocarpine\nhydrochloride (380 mg/kg, s.c.) was injected 30 min after atropine. In some\nof the animals, the selective estrogen receptor modulator raloxifene\nhydrochloride (2 mg/kg, s.c.) was injected immediately after atropine, but\nother procedures were the same. As previously described, raloxifene was used\nbecause it decreases the adverse effects of pilocarpine-induced SE on\nreproductive function in adult female rats [\n18\n].\nAlthough pre-treatments were different for the pilocarpine-treated\nrats, all pilocarpine-treated animals that exhibited regular estrous cycles\nafter SE were similar: these rats showed IIS that had a cyclic pattern that\nparalleled the estrous cycle. Therefore, the results from\npilocarpine-treated rats are presented together in the Results.\nA modified Racine scale was used to define behavioral seizures. This\n5 stage scale was only modified with respect to stage 3. Instead of the\noriginal description by Racine (forelimb clonus [\n24\n]), stage 3 was defined as rearing with\ntonic-clonic movements of one forelimb. There were two reasons for our\nmodification of the Racine stage 3 seizure: 1) forelimb clonus was often\ndifficult to define if forelimbs were under the body; 2) the modified stage\n3 always preceded stage 4. In the Results, we use the phrase \u201csevere\nseizures\u201d to refer to stages 4\u20135.\nSE was defined as the first convulsive seizure that was\n\u2265stage 3 and the animal did not resume normal behavior for at least\n5 min. Ten to 20 minutes after the onset of SE, pentobarbital (30 mg/kg,\ni.p.) was injected to decrease SE severity. All animals were treated with\ndextrose-lactated Ringer s solution (3 ml s.c.; Henry Schein) 1\u20134\nhrs after the first dose of pentobarbital and the following day.\nIn most animals, the first dose of pentobarbital led to a supine\nposture with trembling, i.e. a major reduction in convulsive behaviors, and\ndid so within 30 min. However, in a subset of animals, an additional dose of\npentobarbital (15 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 30 min after the first dose\nbecause the first dose did not appear to have an effect. The females in this\nsubset did not continue to show regular estrous cycles after SE so they are\nnot included in the Results section where female rats are discussed that had\na 4-day cycle in IIS frequency. Two males were in this subset of animals and\nthey are included in the Results sections when males are discussed that had\nIIS and chronic seizures.\nElectrode implantation\nSubjects were initially anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine solution\n(i.p.) followed by isoflurane by inhalation (Isotec, Surgivet; Dublin, OH).\nAfter shaving hair on the scalp (Model 8900; Wahl USA; Sterling, IL), and\nlubricating eyes (Altalube; Butler Schein, Dublin, OH), animals were placed\nin a stereotaxic apparatus (Model 502603; World Precision Instruments,\nSarasota, FL) on a heating pad with rectal probe for control of body\ntemperature using a heater with a feedback circuit to maintain temperature\nat 37\u00b0C (Homeothermic temperature controller; Harvard Apparatus,\nHolliston, MA). A scalp incision was used to expose the dorsal surface of\nthe skull, and holes were drilled (Model C300; Grobet USA, Carlstadt, NJ;\n0.7 mm drill bits; Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA) to implant 8\nelectrodes: 4 epidural electrodes (bone skull screws; Frederick Haer,\nBowdoin ME) and 2 bipolar depth electrodes made in-house (twisted 75\n\u03bcm-diameter Teflon-coated stainless steel wire; California Fine\nWire, Grover Beach, CA). Epidural electrodes were placed bilaterally over\nthe frontal cortex (FC) and occipital cortex (OC). Coordinates for FC\nelectrodes were: \u22121.0 mm posterior to Bregma and 3.0 mm lateral to\nthe midline. For OC electrodes, coordinates were \u22126.0 mm and 3.0 mm.\nOne ground electrode was implanted 1.0 mm anterior to Bregma and 3.0 mm\nlateral to the midline. The reference electrode was 1.0 mm posterior to\nLambda and 1.5 mm lateral to the midline. Depth electrodes were located in\ndorsal hippocampus (1/hippocampus) at the following coordinates:\n\u22123.5 mm posterior to Bregma, 3.5 mm lateral to the midline, and 3.5\nmm below dura. Electrodes were inserted into a 16-pin connector (Digi-key;\nThief River Falls, MN), and the connector was fixed to the skull (dental\ncement; Henry Schein Inc, Melville, NY). Animals were treated with the\nanalgesic buprenorphine and yohimbine i.p. to facilitate recovery from\nanesthesia immediately after surgery.\n\nPharmacology\nDrugs used for induction of SE\nKA (Milestone Pharmatech, New Brunswick, NJ), atropine methylbromide\n(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and pilocarpine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich)\nwere dissolved in 0.9% NaCl. Raloxifene hydrochloride\n(Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich).\nPentobarbital was purchased as a solution (50 mg/ml; Nembutal; Henry Schein\nInc., Melville, NY), as was diazepam (5 mg/ml; Baxter Healthcare; New\nProvidence, NJ) and stored at room temperature. ICI 182,780 (Tocris\nBioscience, Bristol, UK) was dissolved in corn oil (vehicle; Mazola, ACH\nFood Companies, Summit, IL) as a 10 mM stock solution and stored at room\ntemperature in the dark until use.\nDrugs used for electrode implantation\nKetamine/xylazine solution (Sigma-Aldrich) was a 80mg/ml ketamine\nand 6mg/ml xylazine solution and the dose was 0.1 ml/100g. Buprenorphine\n(Henry Schein) dose was 0.05 mg/kg. Yohimbine (Henry Schein) dose was 2\nmg/kg.\n\nVideo-EEG recording\nSubjects were allowed 1 week to recover from surgery. During recording,\nanimals were allowed to move freely while attached to a transmitter for digital\ntelemetry (Bio-Signal Corp., Brooklyn, NY) plugged into the pin connector on the\nskull. The transmitter was attached by a cable to a commutator (#SL2C;\nPlastics One, Roanoke, VA) to allow freedom of movement. Recordings were\nsynchronized with a video camera (Axis Systems, Auburn Hills, MI). EEG was\nacquired at 2 kHz using AcqKnowledge (version 4.1; Biopac Systems, Goleta, CA)\nor Insight II (Persyst, Prescott, AZ).\nRecordings were made for 1\u20132 hrs during the morning (between\n8:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.). During recordings, an investigator marked the times\nin the EEG record that were accompanied by exploration, behavioral arrest, or\nsleep. Exploration was defined by walking (e.g., walking across the cage),\nsniffing, and other movements associated with exploring the cage. Behavioral\narrest was defined as a spontaneous pause in behavior when there was a frozen\nposture and the eyes were open. For the purposes of this study, spontaneous\nbehavioral arrest is the same as spontaneous immobility. At this time, theta\noscillations in hippocampus were reduced or absent, consistent with the\nemergence of distinct hippocampal EEG patterns during this behavioral state,\ni.e., sharp-wave ripples (SPW-R), described elsewhere [\n25\n\u2013\n27\n]. Sleep was defined by closed eyes, absence of movement, with\nan increase in EEG activity in the epidural electrodes. Occasionally animals\nthat were in behavioral arrest lowered their eyelids slowly; because this\nbehavior suggests a transition to sleep it was defined as sleep if cortical\nelectrodes showed increased EEG activity (e.g., delta rhythm), but defined as\nbehavioral arrest if not.\nBetween EEG recording sessions, some animals were video-recorded so that\nconvulsive seizures could be monitored. For this purpose, the transmitter was\ndetached and animals were returned to their home cage, with overhead video\ncamera (Axis Systems). Recordings were reviewed post-hoc using a VLC media\nplayer (VideoLan Organization; videolan.org). The investigator reviewing the\nvideo files was blinded to the estrous cycle stage.\n\nData analysis of EEG\nTerminology\nInvestigators vary in the use of terms such as spike, IIS, and sharp\nwave. Because our subjects were rats, and our electrodes included depth\nelectrodes within hippocampus, we avoided the term sharp wave because the\nterm \u2018sharp wave\u2019 is used for recordings from rat\nhippocampus to designate a deflection in the EEG that is sharp\n(50\u2013100 msec duration) and occurs normally in behavioral arrest or\nsleep, where it is considered important to memory consolidation (Buzsaki,\n1986; 1990). In contrast, IIS are only found in rats between seizures, so\nthey are pathological. They were recorded both in hippocampus and other\nelectrodes. Strictly speaking, IIS were defined as simultaneous rapid\n(50\u2013200 msec) deflections that occurred in all electrodes and were\nlarge (peak to peak amplitude, >5x the amplitude of the baseline noise)\nin the majority (\u22655) of electrodes and in both hemispheres. The term\n\u201cspike\u201d is not used in this study to avoid confusion.\nIIS quantification\nTo quantify IIS, a blinded investigator manually reviewed the data\nfor each recording session. IIS frequency for a given recording session\n(typically 1\u20132 hrs) was determined by dividing the number of IIS for\neach period of a given behavioral state (e.g., exploration) by the total\nduration of time spent in that behavioral state.\nWhether IIS frequency data exhibited a regular cyclic pattern was\ntested by fitting the data to the following modified sine wave squared\nequation, using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm:\nIISfreq.\n=\nA\n[\nsin\n(\n\u03c0\n(\nd-d\n0\n)\n/\nB\n]\n2\nWhere IIS freq. is the number of interictal spikes per minute, d and\nd0 are the day of the recording and the first day of recording,\nrespectively, A is the predicted IIS frequency maximum and B the predicted\nwave frequency. We used this equation to fit the data, based on the null\nhypothesis that IIS might vary in a cylic, regular daily pattern, without\never becoming negative (since IIS frequency can never be less than zero).\nThe sine wave squared equation describes such a relationship. Therefore, we\nreasoned that if the data did indeed follow a cyclical pattern, we should be\nable to fit it using this relationship and obtain a statistically\nsignificant regression coefficient. If not, then the Marquardt-Levenberg\ncurve fit procedure would not yield a significant regression coefficient and\nthe hypothesis of regular cyclicity would have to be rejected.\nThe parameters in the curve fit equation were all allowed to vary\nindependently during curve fitting: none were constrained to force fitting\nto a pre-determined pattern. Regressions were analyzed statistically by\nANOVA. Significance limits for the regression analysis were set at\np<0.05. All curve fits were carried out using the functions incorporated\ninto Sigmaplot 10 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA).\n\nOvariectomy (Ovx)\nAnimals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and the animal was\nmaintained at 37\u00b0C (for details see\nElectrode\nimplantation\n, above). With the animal on its abdomen, the lower\nback was shaved with a small animal shaver (described above) and the area was\nswabbed with Betadine (Henry Schein). A midline incision was made with a sterile\nscalpel and the skin deflected from the area just over each ovary. The abdominal\nwall was cut over each ovary with a \u00bc\u2033-long incision and each\novary was removed. A sterile suture (Dermalon 3\u20130, Henry Schein) was\nused to ligate the ovary at the junction with the uterus. The incision in the\nabdominal wall was closed with sterile sutures, and the midline incision was\nclosed with wound clips (EZ clip wound closures, Stoelting Co., Wood Dale IL),\nfollowed by treatment of the area with Betadine. Animals were placed under a\nheat lamp until they were ambulatory. No recordings were made for 4\u20137\ndays after surgery, to allow for recovery.\n\nThe Estrous Cycle\nTerminology\nFor the purposes of this study, the estrous cycle was defined as two\ndays of diestrous [the first called metestrus (or diestrus 1) and\nthe second called diestrus 2, followed by a day called proestrus and then\nanother day called estrus. As shown by measurements every 2 hrs in the\nSprague-Dawley rat, the pre-ovulatory surge in 17\u03b2-estradiol begins\nwith a slow increase in serum levels of 17\u03b2-estradiol during the\nmorning of diestrus 2 and continuing overnight until proestrous morning.\nSubsequently there is a rapid surge in serum levels of 17\u03b2-estradiol\nduring the morning of proestrus [\n28\n,\n29\n].\nProgesterone begins to rise at midday of proestrus, peaks in the evening and\nthen dramatically falls until approximately 5:00 a.m. of estrous morning\n[\n28\n,\n29\n]. Therefore, the time of the estrous\ncycle that is analogous to the periovulatory period in women (day 14 of the\n28-day menstrual cycle) is proestrous morning [\n28\n]. Although direct comparison is\ndifficult, because the rat does not have a true luteal phase to its cycle,\nthe time of the estrous cycle that is hormonally closest to the\nperimenstrual period is early estrous morning, immediately after\nprogesterone levels have both fallen [\n28\n].\nVaginal cytology\nVaginal cytology was examined as described previously [\n30\n] (for additional details see\n[\n31\n,\n32\n]) and interpreted based on the\nhormonal fluctuations accompanying the day-to-day variation in cell types\nsampled from the vaginal wall. Three types of cells were discriminated,\nleukocytes (predominant on metestrus and diestrus 2), epithelial cells, and\ncornified epithelial cells. The latter two cell types dominated the vaginal\nsample on proestrus and estrus. A typical pattern for proestrous morning was\npredominantly epithelial cells and a smaller contribution of cornified\nepithelial cells. A typical pattern for estrous morning was the converse:\npredominantly cornified epithelial cells, and a smaller contribution of\nepithelial cells. A 4-day cycle was defined by two days of diestrus when\nleukocytes were dominant (metestrus) or similar in proportion to other cell\ntypes (diestrus 2), followed by two days when epithelial cells and cornified\nepithelial cells were the primary cell types (proestrus and estrus). Two\nconsecutive 4-day cycles were required before considering an animal for this\nstudy. Acyclicity was defined by any other pattern, e.g., only one day where\nepithelial or cornified epithelial cells were the major cell type, instead\nof two days. Even if only one cycle failed to meet the 4-day pattern, an\nanimal was defined as acyclic. The reason for the strict definition was\nbased on previous studies of hippocampal slices from female Sprague-Dawley\nrats, where rats with strict 4-day estrous cycles showed a 4-day pattern in\nelectrophysiological measures of excitability in area CA3 but even a small\ndisruption of the 4-day estrous cycle disrupted the electrophysiological\npattern in hippocampus [\n30\n]. Importantly, we measured estradiol and progesterone\nlevels in a subset of animals to confirm the predictions of estrous cycle\nstage based on vaginal cytology [\n30\n].\n\nNeuropathology\nAnimals were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital at a high dose (50\nmg/kg, i.p.) and transcardially-perfused with 0.9% NaCl (3 min) followed\nby fixative (4% paraformaldehdye, pH 7.4) for 5 min. Brains were removed\nafter 2\u20134 hrs and placed in 4 % paraformaldehyde overnight at\n4\u00b0C. Using one hemisphere, sections (50 \u03bcm) were cut\nhorizontally; every 300 \u03bcm, one section was selected for cresyl violet,\nthe next for NeuN immunohistochemistry, and the next for fluorojade B. The other\nhemisphere was cut in the coronal plane and sections were selected in the same\nway. Because the coronal sections were transected with electrode tracks,\nhorizontal sections were used for quantification of anatomical findings.\nNeuN immunohistochemistry used free-floating sections that were gently\nmixed on a rotator (Clinical rotator; Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). After\ntreating sections for 30 min with 0.25% Triton-X 100, sections were\nwashed 3 \u00d7 (5 min each) in 0.1% Triton-X 100 in 0.1M Tris buffer\n(\u201cTris A\u201d), and then blocked with 5% normal horse serum\n(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min, followed by washes in Tris A\n(3 \u00d7 5 min) and then \u201cTris B\u201d (Tris A with 0.05%\nbovine serum albumin). Sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on a\nrotator with a mouse monoclonal antibody to NeuN (1:10,000; EMD Millipore,\nBillerica, MA) diluted in Tris A followed by washes in Tris A (3 \u00d7 5\nmin) and incubation in biotinylated horse anti-mouse secondary antibody (Vector;\n1:400) diluted in Tris A followed by washes in Tris A (3 \u00d7 5 min).\nSections were then incubated in ABC solution diluted in Tris A according to the\nManufacturer s instructions (ABC Standard Kit, Vector) followed by washes in\nTris (3 \u00d7 5 min) and incubation in diaminobenzidine (0.022%)\nwith 0.2 % ammonium chloride, 0.1% glucose oxidase, 0.8%\nD(+)-glucose and 5 mM NiCl\n2\nin 0.1 M Tris buffer. To ensure\nthat labeling for NeuN was detected if it was present, sections were allowed to\nincubate with DAB for a long enough time that the background started to\naccumulate detectable stain. The reaction was stopped by washing sections in 0.1\nM Tris buffer. Sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, dehydrated in a\nseries of ethanol (Pharmaco-Aaper, Shelbville, KY) solutions (5 min each\n70%, 90%, 95%, 100% and then 10 min in fresh\n100%, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped in Permount (Fisher\nScientific).\nFluorojade B (Histochem Inc., Jefferson, AK) staining was conducted as\ndescribed elsewhere (\nwww.scharfmanlab.com/Protocols\n). In brief, sections were mounted\non coated slides (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) and allowed to dry overnight.\nAfter immersing in 100% ethanol (3 min), and 70% ethanol (1 min)\nslides were placed in dH\n2\nO for 1 min and then a solution of\n0.06% KMnO\n4\nin dH\n2\nO, followed by 0.001%\nfluorojade B. The steps following ethanol were conducted in the dark. After\nwashing in dH\n2\nO (3 \u00d7 1 min), slides were allowed to dry\novernight in the dark, treated with xylene (3 \u00d7 1 min) and coverslipped\nin DPX (Sigma-Aldrich). Slides were stored in the dark at 4\u00b0C.\nFor cresyl violet, sections were mounted on gelatin-treated slides,\nallowed to dry for 24 hrs, and dehydrated in a series of graded ethanols.\nSections were rehydrated by reversing the dehydration steps and then slides were\nstained with 0.1% (w/v) cresyl violet in dH\n2\nO for 1 min. If\nstaining appeared too dark, acetic acid (0.01%; Fisher Scientific) was\nused to destain (i.e., so that cells were stained and areas with no cells were\nnot). Sections were then dehydrated and slides were cleared in xylene and\ncover-slipped with Permount.\nSlides were viewed on a microscope with brightfield and fluorescence\ncapability (Olympus BX61; Olympus of America, Center Valley, PA). Photographs\nwere taken with a digital camera (RET 2000R-F-CLR-12, Q Imaging, Surrey, BC,\nCanada) using Q imaging software.\nQuantification of NeuN-ir and fluorojade B-stained sections was\nperformed using ImageJ (\nwww.rsd.nih/imagej\n).\nInvestigators were blinded to condition. First, micrographs were taken at 4x\nmagnification. The same light settings were used for all sections labeled with\nthe same antibody/marker (e.g., NeuN or fluorojade-B). Sections were 300\n\u03bcm apart and the results from 3 sections per animal through the middle\nthird of the hippocampus were averaged.\nFor NeuN, micrographs were first converted to 8 bit gray-scale and then\nbinary images. Regions of interest (ROI) were outlined and then the area\nfraction was calculated. The area fraction was the part of the ROI area above\nthreshold, expressed as a percent of total ROI area. Threshold was selected\nautomatically in Image J to minimize experimenter bias. Notably, the threshold\nagreed with visual inspection, i.e., NeuN-ir was above threshold and background\nstaining was below threshold.\nThe ROIs were defined by landmarks that were clear in all sections. For\nthe granule cell layer, the entire cell layer was outlined. For the\nCA1\u2013CA3 cell layer, the entire cell layer was outlined with the\ntermination in CA1 defined as the location where the cell layer becomes\ndispersed at the junction with the subiculum. The pre/parasubiculum was the area\nbetween the pia, underlying white matter, the subiculum and the medial\nentorhinal cortex (MEC). The MEC was demarcated by the pia, white matter,\nparasubiculum and the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). These areas were defined\nbased on cytoarchitectonics in an atlas of the adult rat brain [\n33\n]. For fluorojade B, the ROIs\nfrom adjacent NeuN-stained sections were used because cytoarchitecture was\nabsent in flourojade B-stained sections and areas hard to define as a result. As\nan alternative method for quantification, ImagePro (Media Cybernetics) was used\nto count cells that were fluorojade B-positive within the MEC. For this method,\na threshold was used so that cells that were fluorojade B-positive were\ndistinguished as objects and counted. Cells that were overlapping were often\ncounted as a single object, leading to an underestimate of cells in areas with\nextensive neuronal damage. For this reason, the method was secondary.\n\nStatistics\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. Student t-tests, Fisher\nexact tests (when sample size was <10) and Chi-squared tests (when sample\nsize was >10), were conducted using Prism (Graph Pad Software, La Jolla, CA)\nwith a criterion for statistical significance of p<0.05. To compare mean IIS\nfrequency across the 4 days of the estrous cycle, the Box-Cox method was used\nwith an added constant of 1, to correct for inhomogeneity of variance and the\nfact that some animals exhibited no IIS on some of the days that were recorded.\nThe transformed data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by the Student-Newman Keuls\nmultiple range test."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThy1-ChR2-YFP (B6.Cg-Tg(Thy1-COP4/EYFP)9Gfng/J Stock Number:007615) and VGAT-ChR2-YFP (B6.Cg-Tg(Slc32a1-COP4*H134R/EYFP)8Gfng/J Stock Number: 014548) transgenic mice (both of C57BL/6 background) were bred from founder animals obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. We used these two transgenic animals since the promoters Thy-1 (\nArenkiel\net al.\n, 2007\n) and VGAT (\nZhao\net al.\n, 2011\n) control the expression of the ChR2 opsin only in neurons and in GABAergic cells, respectively. Animals were housed no more than 5 adult animals per cage and maintained in a SPF room under light (12-h light/12-h dark cycle), temperature and humidity controlled conditions. Animals used for\nin vitro\nbrain slice experiments were studied at approximately postnatal day 14 (P14, range P11 to P16) and P90. For acute\nin vivo\nexperiments, adult animals were used (range P90 to P110). Both male and female animals were used for experiments as no differences due to animal gender were observed. All experimental procedures performed in this study followed the NIH animal use guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Case Western Reserve University.\n\nHistology\nTransgenic and wildtype mice from both mouse lines were transcardially perfused with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) under isoflurane anesthesia at age P14 and P100. Brains were then removed, post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C overnight, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 days before being flash-frozen in 2-methylbutane on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Brains were then sectioned at a thickness of 40 \u03bcm using a cryostat (Leica CM3050S), and free-floating sections were blocked in 5% horse serum for 1hr then stained for GAD-67 (rabbit, Santa Cruz (sc-5602), 1:100 dilution) or GAD-65/67 (rabbit, ABcam (ab49832), 1:1000 dilution) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Cy3 (donkey \u03b1-rabbit, 1:700, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). After rinsing in PBS, sections were mounted on Fisherbrand Superfrost/Plus microscope slides in VECTASHIELD mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For 40 \u03bcm sections, TOTO-3 (1:2000 dilution, Invitrogen) was included to visualize nuclei and confocal microscopy was used to capture Z-stacked images on a Zeiss LSM 510 META laser-scanning microscope. All YFP- and GAD-positive neurons in the hippocampus that could be identified were counted from n=6 transgenic (P14, n=3; P100, n=3) and n=2 wildtype mice from each mouse line. Immunohistochemical images presented represent a typical IHC staining result.\n\nAcute\nin vivo\nrecording and optical stimulation\nAdult transgenic and wildtype mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and mounted to a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). Anesthesia was maintained throughout the stereotaxic surgery by delivering 3% isoflurane in a carbogen gas mixture (95% O2/5% CO2) via a constant pressure mask, and depth of anesthesia was assessed by monitoring animal respiratory rate and response to toe pinch. Screw electrodes were placed in the skull for use as the reference (positioned caudally in the occipital bone) and system ground (positioned rostrally in the frontal/coronal bones). Depth electrodes (tungsten, A-M Systems) were positioned in the septal CA3 region of the hippocampus bilaterally (bregma \u22121.7 mm, lateral \u00b12.0 mm, depth 2.1 mm). Local field potential neural activity was bandpass filtered (1 Hz to 5 kHz) and amplified (gain of 1000, A-M Systems Model 1700 Differential AC Amplifier), then digitized at 20 kHz (PowerLabs/16SP) using LabChart7 software (ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand) and stored for off-line analysis. Epileptiform activity was induced by 1 \u03bcL bolus injections of 40 mM 4-AP (in nACSF) in the left septal CA3 region (bregma \u22121.8 mm, lateral 2.0 mm, depth 2.1 mm). Additional injections were administered every 10 minutes until the development of sustained electrographic seizure activity for the duration of the experiment, with an average dose of 3\u00b11 \u03bcL. The resultant electrographic seizure was self-sustained for the duration of the experiment. A stripped and freshly cleaved optical fiber (0.48 NA, 200 \u03bcm diameter, Thorlabs) was placed at the site of 4-AP injection, positioned at a 30\u00b0 angle to maximally illuminate the dorsal hippocampus. Optical patch chords were connected to a 100 mW 473 nm fiber-coupled DPSS laser (OEM Laser Systems, Bluffdale, UT) controlled by a TTL trigger source provided by the digital acquisition system that was programmed to output 1Hz pulse trains with 5ms pulse width. The laser power applied to the tissue during 1 Hz optical pulse trains was measured to be ~11 mW/mm\n2\n.\n\nBrain slice electrophysiology\nTransgenic and wildtype mice were decapitated under isoflurane anesthesia and the brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold high-sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid (S-aCSF) containing (in mM): sucrose, 75; NaCl, 85; KCl, 2.5; NaH2PO4, 1.25; NaHCO3, 25; D-glucose, 25; MgCl2, 4; CaCl2, 0.5; and bubbled with a 95% O2/5% CO2 gas mixture. After fixing the whole brain to a cutting block using cyanoacrylate glue, 350 \u03bcm transverse hippocampal slices were cut in S-aCSF at low temperature using a vibratome (VT1000S, Leica, Nusslock, Germany) and placed in a bubbled storage solution at room temperature containing (in mM): NaCl, 125; KCl, 2.5; NaH2PO4, 1.25; D-glucose, 25; NaHCO3, 25; MgCl2, 4; CaCl2, 1. After a one hour incubation, slices were transferred to a bath-immersion recording chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and superfused with gas-bubbled normal aCSF heated to 32\u00b0C containing (in mM): NaCl, 125, KCl, 2.5; NaH2PO4, 1.25; D-glucose, 25, NaHCO3, 25; MgCl2, 2; CaCl2, 2; with pH 7.6 and osmolarity 315 mOsm. Glass pipette recording electrodes were pulled from borosilicate capillary glass using a Flaming/Brown type puller (P-1000, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) to a resistance of 5 M\u03a9 for electrodes used to measure field potentials (150 mM NaCl pipette filling solution) or for patch clamp recordings (used for Thy1 slice experiments) or to a resistance of 90\u2013120 M\u03a9 for intracellular recording electrodes (4M K-Acetate filling solution, used for VGAT slice experiments). Intracellular recording techniques were used for the VGAT experiments due to the prolonged recording times and the need for an accurate measure of the membrane voltage to calculate the optical response reversal potential. A tungsten electrode (A-M Systems) was placed in the Schaffer collateral tract and used to deliver a 200\u2013400 \u03bcA regulated current cathodic pulse for 100 \u03bcs (Model 2300 Digital Stimulus Isolator, A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA) to elicit an evoked potential measured in the CA3 pyramidal cell layer in order to assess hippocampal network function and tissue viability throughout the experiment. Brain slices and electrode placements were visualized using an AxioCam MRm CCD camera on an Axioscope FS microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) positioned above the bath recording chamber. Optical stimulation of cells expressing ChR2-YFP was done using a fiber-coupled 100 mW 473 nm DPSS laser (OEM Laser Systems, Bluffdale, UT), with the fiber bare end (200 \u03bcm diameter) placed directly over the CA3 region in the bath. The optical stimulus area was visualized using the microscope and camera, and the position of the fiber was adjusted to obtain adequate coverage of the CA3 pyramidal cell area. Recordings were acquired using Axopatch 200B Patch Clamp Amplifier (Molecular Devices) and IE-210 Intracellular Electrometer (Warner Instruments) high impedance amplifiers and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz before being digitized at 10 kHz (Digidata 1440A, Molecular Devices) and stored for off-line analysis. Epileptiform activity was induced by bath application of 100 \u03bcM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, Sigma). Inhibition of GABA\nA\n-mediated processes was accomplished by adding 100 \u03bcM picrotoxin (PTX, Sigma) to the superfused aCSF. Current-clamp pulse stimulation was applied to cells to monitor the membrane response to optical stimulation and calculate the reversal potential. Cells were injected with 500 ms pulses from \u22120.6 nA to +0.6 nA and a 10 ms optical pulse applied at t=400ms. Amplitude of the optical response was measured as the maximum or minimum voltage subtracted from the average pre-stimulus membrane voltage. Optical stimulation of wild-type control animals did not elicit any optical response and had no effect on epileptiform activity in the hippocampal slice when applied at 1Hz.\n\nData Analysis and Statistics\nData were analyzed off-line using the Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) and IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Portland, OR) software packages to create custom analysis procedures. Neuromatic procedures (J. Rothman,\nhttp://www.neuromatic.thinkran-dom.com\n) run in IGOR Pro 6.22 were used to import pCLAMP data for further analysis. For\nin vivo\nrecordings, stimulation artifacts were first removed using a signal processing algorithm that calculated an ensemble average of all artifacts in a recording to create a template that was then subtracted from the raw data (Chiang\net al.\n, 2012). With stimulation artifacts removed, the root mean square (RMS) voltage for each recording epoch was calculated as a measure of the signal power. Suppression ratios (SR) were then calculated for each stimulation period as\nSR\n= 100\u00d7(\nP\nbaseline\n\u2212\nP\nstim\n)/\nP\nbaseline\nsuch that a SR of zero indicates no change in signal power during stimulation and SR of 100 indicates a reduction of signal power to zero during the stimulus period. For\nin vitro\nexperiments, only slices yielding an orthodromic population spike \u22651mV from Schaffer collateral stimulation were used for data analysis. After the experiment, intracellular microelectrodes were withdrawn to measure the potential outside the cell, which was then subtracted from the raw data to obtain the transmembrane potential.\nStatistical analysis was done using two-tailed paired\nt\n-test for\nin vivo\nexperimental results to compare signal power reduction due to optical stimulation and two-tailed two-sample\nt\n-test to compare the calculated suppression ratios between transgenic mouse lines. For\nin vitro\nexperiments, one-way ANOVA was used for multiple comparisons of means to assess statistical significance in the change in membrane voltage due to optical stimulation, followed by post-hoc Tukey HSD for pair-wise comparisons. Two-tailed, two-sample\nt\n-test was used to compare the reversal potential under normal and 4-AP conditions. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess statistical significance of the change in the distribution of AP spiking behavior due to optical stimulation. Normality tests were run on all data sets and adjustments were made when the variance between groups compared was not similar. A statistical significance criterion of \u03b1 = 0.05 used for all tests. Power analysis was performed on preliminary data to ensure an adequate sample size for these experiments. Results are shown as mean \u00b1 the standard error of the mean (SEM) unless otherwise noted. In box-and-whisker plots, boxes represent the 25\nth\npercentile, median value, and 75\nth\npercentile of the data, and whiskers represent the 10\nth\nand 90\nth\npercentiles."

    "Methods": "Mice\nIsl1\nhypo,\nIsl2\nnull mice and\nHb9::GFP\nmice were described previously (\nLee, et al., 2004\n,\nSong, et al., 2009\n,\nSun, et al., 2008\n,\nThaler, et al., 2004\n). The Robo and Slit mutant strains were gifts of Dr. Marc Tessier-Lavigne, Rockefeller University (\nLong, et al., 2004\n). Wildtype C56BL/6 and CD-1 mice (6\u20138 weeks old) were purchased from Damul Science and Charles River Laboratories, respectively. Robo and Slit PCR genotyping was performed as previously described (\nGrieshammer, et al., 2004\n,\nLong, et al., 2004\n,\nPlump, et al., 2002\n). All experiments used protocols approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committees of the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), or by the University of Nevada, Reno Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The day when a vaginal plug was detected was designated embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5).\n\nImmunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization\nEmbryos were obtained and processed for immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization as described previously (\nSong, et al., 2009\n). The following antibodies were used: rabbit and guinea pig anti-Hb9 (\nThaler, et al., 1999\n), guinea pig anti-Lhx3 (\nSharma, et al., 1998\n), guinea pig anti-Chx10 (\nThaler, et al., 2002\n), rabbit anti-Foxp1 (Abcam), rabbit anti-Krox20 (Covance), rabbit and guinea pig anti-Isl1/2 (\nEricson, et al., 1992\n), mouse anti-Neurofilament (DSHB), mouse anti-GFP (Sigma), rabbit anti-\u03b2-III-tubulin (Covance), rabbit anti-\u03b2-galactosidase (Cappel) antibodies. For immunocytochemistry, dissociated cultured cells were fixed and immunostained with antibodies including rabbit anti-Robo1 and Robo2 (kind gift of Dr. Elke Stein, Yale) and mouse anti-Isl1 (DSHB). Previous characterization of the Robo1 and Robo2 antisera confirmed that specific labeling was lost in homozygous mutants. For in situ hybridization, embryonic cDNA at E10.5 or E12.5 was used to generate riboprobes using an Advantage cDNA PCR kit (Clonetech).\n\nChick in ovo electroporation\nNrp1\nsiRNA/scrambled siRNA (\nBron, et al., 2004\n),\nSlit2\nmorpholino/control morpholino (\nGiovannone, et al., 2012\n) and siRNAs/scrambled siRNA against Semaphorin ligands (see\nSupplementary Methods\n) were electroporated with GFP into the chick spinal cord at Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) stages 10 to 12 and harvested at HH stages 20 to 25. Electroporation was carried out using a square wave electroporator (BTX) with 5 pulses of 25 V, 50 ms at 1 s intervals.\n\nMicroarray analysis\nEmbryonic stem (ES) cells were derived from littermate blastocysts of\nIsl1\nheterozygous intercrosses (also containing\nHb9::gfp\ntransgenes) and cultured in standard ES cell conditions as described (\nMacfarlan, et al., 2011\n). To induce motor neuron differentiation, ES cells were adapted to gelatinized dishes for two passages, and 10\n6\ntrypsinized cells were seeded in mDiff medium (1:1 Knockout DMEM:DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen), 5% Knockout\n\u2122\nSerum Replacement (Invitrogen), 1X NEAA (Mediatech), 2 mM L-glutamine, 14.3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) in bacterial grade 10 cm\n2\ndishes, and the medium was changed every two days. RA (1 \u03bcM) and smoothened agonist (1 \u03bcM, Calbiochem) were added to induce motor neuron differentiation after 2 days of EB formation.\nHb9::gfp\npositive cells were then collected on day 6 by FACS. RNA was prepared from mES-derived MNs using an RNEasy kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNAse digestion. dscDNA was generated from 100 ng-1 \u03bcg of total RNA using a GeneChip3\u2032 IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix), fragmented, and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 expression arrays. Differentially expressed genes in four wild type ES cell lines (heterozygous and homozygous) and three knockout lines (independent replicates from a single ES cell line) were identified using Vampire and the default settings (\nhttp://genome.ucsd.edu/microarray/\n).\n\nQuantification and statistics\nAt least 6 sections from 3 embryos were analyzed for each genotype and axial level. Limb levels were determined by\nRaldh2\nexpression in adjacent sections. To measure % of sections with ectopic motor neurons in the chick spinal cord, the proportion of sections that contained ectopic motor neurons on either side of the neural tube was calculated. Statistical significance was analyzed by unpaired Student\u2019s t-test and the Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple comparisons."
