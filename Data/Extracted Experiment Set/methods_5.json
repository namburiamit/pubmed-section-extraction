    "Methods": "Experimental Design\nAll procedures performed were approved by the Drexel University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250\u2013300 g were used for all experiments (N=41). A subset of rats received a complete spinal transection at T8 / T9 (N=37). We initially tested responses to acute doses of 5-HTR agonists to determine an optimal combination dose that promotes locomotor output (BBB score) without significant side effects (hindlimb tremor and serotonin syndrome measures) (N=11). We next performed 2 sets of studies (\nFig. 1A, 1B\n). Our first study examined the effect of time after SCI alone on locomotor recovery, spinal 5-HTR densities (5-HT\n1A\nR and 5-HT\n2A\nR), and spinal dendritic (microtubule associate protein 2 or MAP2) plasticity (same animals from acute dose response experiment, N=11). Our second study examined the effect of therapy after SCI on locomotor recovery, spinal 5-HTR densities, and spinal dendritic plasticity (N=26). Here we used chronic 5-HT pharmacology and / or exercise therapy as therapeutic interventions. A single set of uninjured animals (Na\u00efve, N=4) served as tissue for spinal protein assessments for both the effect of time and the effect of therapy studies.\nFigure 1.

Within group differences: ### different from Sal. at p<0.001, # different from Sal. at p<0.05; * different from 0.075 mg/kg at p<0.05. Across group differences: + different from Early at same dose at p<0.025. Data displayed is mean \u00b1 S.E.M.\n\nCommon Method\nSpinal Transection Procedure & Animal Care\nSimilar to our previous studies (\nGanzer et al. 2013\n;\nGanzer et al., 2016\n;\nFoffani et al., 2016\n;\nManohar et al., 2017\n), rats received a complete mid-thoracic transection at spinal level T8 / T9. Briefly, animals were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and 2-liters of oxygen and maintained at 2\u20133% isoflurane with 1-liter oxygen for the duration of the surgery. A laminectomy at the T8 / 9 level was performed to expose the spinal cord. A #10 scalpel blade was used to open the dura and pia mater and #11 scalpel blade was used to make the complete transection of the spinal cord. A fine-tipped microaspiration device was then used to remove 2 \u2013 3 mm of spinal cord. A collagen matrix, Vitrogen (Cohesion Technology; Encinitas, CA), was injected into the site of the spinal transection. Following surgery, animals were given an intramuscular injection of the antibiotic Pen-G and 5 ml of lactated ringer subcutaneously before returning to their home cages.\nAnimals were housed 2 per cage with highly absorbent Alpha-Dri bedding (Shepherd Specialty Papers Inc. Kalamazoo, MI), and cages were kept on warm water blankets. Animals were housed under a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 07:00) with ad libitum access to food and water. Bladder care was given 3 times daily for 2 weeks or until bladder control was regained. If there was any sign of infection, subcutaneous injections of Baytril (0.06 mg/kg) were given twice a day for 7 days.\nDrugs\nQuipazine (Sigma; St. Louis, MO) and 8-OH-DPAT (Sigma; St. Louis, MO) were dissolved in sterile saline and administered at a volume of 1 ml/kg i.p. & s.c., respectively. Importantly, all 5-HT agonist injection concentrations for a given experimental group are detailed below in the methods. Acute dose response curve experiments utilized a 0.075 and 0.125 mg/kg 5-HT agonist dose to identify an effective agonist concentration. The effect of time and therapy experiments utilized a 0.125 mg/kg 5-HT agonist dose. For all \u2018on-drug\u2019 behavioral testing, agonists were administered 5 minutes before the assessment began.\nOpen Field Locomotor Scoring\nBBB scoring in the open field was used to test behavioral recovery (\nBasso et al., 1995\n). Spontaneous hindlimb motor activity was evaluated for 4 min in a spherical enclosure (minor diameter = 2.5 ft.; major diameter = 3 ft.) and scored by two trained observers with an inter-rater reliability \u2265 95%, similar to our previous studies (\nGanzer et al., 2013\n;\nGanzer et al., 2016\n;\nFoffani et al., 2016\n;\nManohar et al., 2017\n). BBB scores of 8 or below correspond to various degrees of locomotor-like movements that do not include weight support. BBB scores of 9 or above (to a maximum of 21) indicate some degree of hindquarter weight support starting in stance and progressing to weight-supported stepping.\n\nAcute Dose Response Test\nAcute Dose Response Curves\nAn initial test was performed to determine an optimal 5-HTR agonist combination dose that promoted locomotor output without significant side effects. An acute dose response curve was performed by comparing behavioral responses after an initial injection of saline to a low dose (0.075 mg/kg each) and high dose (0.125 mg/kg each) combination of quipazine and 8-OH-DPAT during weeks 1 (Early, N=4) and 8 (Late, N=7) post-SCI. Animals first received the initial injection of saline (Sal.), followed by the low dose combination of drug and ending with the high dose combination of drug. Each injection was separated by a 24 hour washout period. BBB score, hindlimb tremor and caudal serotonin syndrome scores were assessed after each injection. Results of these tests were used to determine drug dose in the effect of time and effect of therapy studies.\nHindlimb Tremor\nMyoclonus (tremor) can be elicited by hindlimb palpation following SCI. The presence of hindlimb tremors was determined by blinded experimenters during the behavioral tests and hindlimb palpation on the plantar surface of the hindlimbs (\nKao et al., 2006\n). Tremors were rated on a 4 point scale [0 = no tremor, 1 = mild (detectable on palpation), 2 = moderate (visually noticeable but does not interfere with function), 3 = intense (interferes with function)].\nCaudal Serotonin Syndrome\nDepletion of serotonin followed by administration of serotonergic agents has been shown to elicit a group of stereotypies referred to as \u201cthe serotonin syndrome\u201d (\nMartin, 1996\n). This consists of a constellation of motor behaviors expressed caudal to the injury including hindlimb spasms and curvature of the tail. Animals were observed in the home cage after drug administration and rated on a 4 point scale [0 = none, 1 = mild (1\u20132 bouts of short duration), 2 = moderate (1\u20132 bouts of long duration or 3\u20135 bouts of short duration), 3 = severe (3 or more bouts of long duration)] for each element of the syndrome which were then added together for the final score (\nKao et al., 2006\n).\n\nEffect of Time Study\nOur first study examined the effect of time after SCI on locomotor recovery, spinal 5-HTR densities, and spinal dendritic plasticity (\nFig. 1A\n). We used the same Early (N=4) and Late (N=7) animals to assess locomotor recovery (BBB scoring) and spinal protein densities. BBB scoring was performed after administration of high dose (0.125 mg/kg each) combination of quipazine and 8-OH-DPAT at the respective time-point (\nFig. 1A\n). Early and Late animals were sacrificed during weeks 1 and 9 post-SCI, respectively, at least 48 hours after drug administration for tissue collection and immunohistochemistry (IHC) (see below for spinal protein IHC details), and compared to protein densities in tissue harvested from Na\u00efve animals (uninjured, N=4).\n\nEffect of Therapy Study\nOur second study examined the effect of therapy after SCI on locomotor recovery, spinal 5-HTR densities, and spinal dendritic plasticity (\nFig. 1B\n). These measures were evaluated during weeks 8 and 9 post-SCI in three spinally transected groups receiving: 1) sham pharmacotherapy and exercise therapy (Bike, N=9), 2) 5-HT pharmacotherapy and sham exercise therapy (5-HT, N=8) and 3) 5-HT pharmacotherapy and exercise therapy (5-HT+Bike, N=9) (see below for therapy administration details). Animals here were sacrificed during week 9 post-SCI at least 48 hours after drug administration, for tissue collection and IHC (see below for spinal protein IHC details), and compared to protein densities in tissue harvested from the same Na\u00efve animals used for the effect of time study.\nExercise Therapy Administration\nStarting one week after SCI, Bike and 5-HT+Bike animals received passive bicycling exercise using a custom built motor-driven cycling apparatus (\nFig. 1B\n;\nHoule et al., 1999\n;\nGraziano et al., 2013\n). Rats were suspended horizontally with their feet secured to the pedals. Cycling speed was maintained at 45 revolutions/min and each exercise bout consisted of two 30-min exercise periods with a 10-min rest period in between. Exercise was administered three times a week (\nDugan, 2010\n) from 1\u20138 weeks post-SCI (on Mondays, Wednesdays & Fridays). Animals in the 5-HT group were placed on bicycles at the same time periods, but the pedals did not move.\nChronic Drug Administration\nChronic pharmacotherapy was administered 5 days a week (Monday \u2013 Friday) from 2\u20138 weeks post-SCI in the 5-HT and 5-HT+Bike groups (\nFig. 1B\n; drug was administered before exercise in the 5-HT+Bike group). Doses of drug consisted of a combination of the 5-HTR agonists quipazine and 8-OH-DPAT at 0.125 mg/kg each. Animals in the Bike group were given injections of saline.\n\nTissue Preparation and Spinal Protein Immunohistochemistry (IHC)\nPerfusion & Tissue Preparation\nAll animals were sacrificed with Euthasol, perfused transcardially with buffered saline (50 mL), followed by buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4, 500 mL). The spinal cord was then removed and post-fixed in the same buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (for a duration of 12 hours) and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose (for a duration of 36 hours). The spinal cord was removed with spinal roots for anatomical reference. Spinal cord tissue was frozen in Shandon M-1 Embedding Matrix compound (Thermo Scientific), sectioned horizontally at 40\u00b5m thickness and slide mounted for staining. The caudal spinal segments assessed (T12-L1) contain the rhythm generating thoracolumbar spinal gray matter (\nKjaerulff and Kiehn 1996\n;\nKremer and Lev-Tov 1997\n). Alternating sections were stained for the presence of 5-HT, 5-HT\n2A\nR, 5-HT\n1A\nR and MAP2 using avidin-biotin IHC (see below) or Nissl and Myelin to confirm a complete SCI lesion (\nFig. 1C\n).\nIHC Controls and Staining Specificity\nAll protein staining experiments were run with tissue from multiple groups to control for inter-experiment variability. The antibodies used here were quality control tested by the manufacturer to confirm antibody specificity using standard immunohistochemical techniques (5-HT antibody: cat. # 20080, Immunostar; 5-HT\n1A\nR antibody: cat. # 24504, Immunostar; 5-HT\n2A\nR antibody: cat. # 24288, Immunostar; MAP2 antibody: cat. # M1406, Sigma). In addition, all protein staining experiments here were performed with 3 IHC staining controls to ensure proper antibody performance (IHC staining controls: no primary antibody application, no secondary antibody application, and no primary or secondary antibody application). All controls failed to stain the respective target antigen as expected.\n5-HT IHC\nSections of spinal cord tissue were stained for the presence of 5-HT using the following incubations: 1) 0.3% H\n2\nO\n2\n& 50% ethanol in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) for 30 mins, 2) PBS rinse, 3) 10% normal goat serum (NGS) and 0.2% Triton in PBS (blocking solution) for 1 hour, 4) polyclonal rabbit anti-5-HT primary antibody (Immunostar) diluted 1:80,000 in PBS containing 2% NGS and 0.2% Triton incubated overnight at room temperature, 5) PBS rinse, 6) biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno Inc.) diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 2% NGS incubated for 2 hours, 7) PBS rinse, 8) Elite ABC reagent (Vector Labs) for 2 hours, 9) PBS rinse, 10) 0.05 M Tris-HCl rinse and 11) 3-3\u2019 diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Sigma) for 20 minutes.\n5-HT\n2A\nR IHC\nSections of spinal cord tissue were stained for the presence of 5-HT\n2A\nR using the following incubations: 1) 0.3% H\n2\nO\n2\n& 50% ethanol in PBS for 30 mins, 2) PBS rinse, 3) 5% NGS and 0.1% Triton in PBS (blocking solution) for 1 hour, 4) polyclonal rabbit anti-5-HT\n2A\nR primary antibody (Immunostar; antigen corresponding amino acids 22\u201341 of rat 5-HT\n2A\nR) diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 5% NGS and 0.1% Triton incubated for 64 hours at 4\u00b0C, 5) PBS rinse, 6) biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno Inc.) diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 2% NGS incubated for 2 hours, 7) PBS rinse, 8) Elite ABC reagent (Vector Labs) for 2 hours, 9) PBS rinse, 10) 0.05 M Tris-HCl rinse and 11)3-3\u2019 diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Sigma) for 50 minutes.\n5-HT\n1A\nR IHC\nSections of spinal cord tissue were stained for the presence of 5-HT\n1A\nR using the following incubations: 1) 0.3% H\n2\nO\n2\n& 50% ethanol in PBS for 30 mins, 2) PBS rinse, 3) 2% NGS and 0.2% Triton in PBS (blocking solution) for 1 hour, 4) polyclonal rabbit anti-5-HT\n1A\nR primary antibody (Immunostar; recognizes the amino acids 294\u2013312 on the third intracellular loop of rat 5-HT\n1A\nR) diluted 1:300 in PBS containing 2% NGS and 0.2% Triton incubated overnight at room temperature, 5) PBS rinse, 6) biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno Inc.) diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 2% NGS for 2 hours, 7) PBS rinse, 8) Elite ABC reagent (Vector Labs) for 2 hours, 9) PBS rinse, 10) 0.05 M Tris-HCl rinse and 11) 3-3\u2019 diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Sigma) for 50 minutes.\nMAP2 IHC\nSections of spinal cord tissue were stained for the presence of MAP2 using the following incubations: 1) 0.3% H\n2\nO\n2\n& 50% ethanol in PBS for 30 mins, 2) PBS rinse, 3) 2% normal horse serum (NHS) and 0.1% Triton in PBS (blocking solution) for 1 hour, 4) monoclonal mouse anti-MAP2 primary antibody (Sigma; clone AP20; recognizes only high molecular weight forms (MAP2a +2b) and is insensitive to phosphorylation state) diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 2% NHS and 0.1% Triton incubated for 48 hours at 4\u00b0, 5) PBS rinse, 6) biotinylated horse anti-mouse secondary antibody (Vector Labs) diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 2% NHS for 2 hours, 7) PBS rinse, 8) Elite ABC reagent (Vector Labs) for 2 hours, 9) PBS rinse, 10) 0.05 M Tris-HCl rinse and 11) 3-3\u2019 diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Sigma) for 20 minutes.\nMicroscopy & Quantification of Immunohistochemical Stains\nAll immunostained slides were next dehydrated in a series of alcohol washes and coverslipped using DPX mounting medium (Sigma; St. Louis, MO). Photomicrographs of the 5-HT, 5-HT\n2A\nR, 5-HT\n1A\nR and MAP2 immunostains were taken across all groups (N=4 for all groups). Using adjacent Nissl and Myelin stained sections, photomicrographs were taken from the rhythm generating T12-L1 segments (\nKjaerulff and Kiehn 1996\n;\nKremer and Lev-Tov 1997\n) across the following spinal gray matter regions of interest (ROIs): 1) Dorsal (Rexed lamina I\u2013VI), 2) Intermediate Zone (IMZ; Rexed lamina VII & X) and 3) Ventral (Rexed lamina VIII & IX) (\nFig. 1D\n). 4\u20136 photomicrographs were taken from each spinal ROI in each animal. 8-bit gray-scale photomicrographs were taken using a 20\u00d7 (for the 5-HT, 5-HT\n2A\nR and 5-HT\n1A\nR immunostains) or 100\u00d7 (for the MAP2 immunostain) objective. Images were processed in Image J (NIH). Only spinal gray matter was selected for image analysis for all immunostains. MAP2 is primarily found in the somatodendritic region of neurons (\nHarada et al., 2002\n). Immunoreactive somata were excluded manually during MAP2 image processing similar to previous study (\nAdkins-Muir & Jones, 2003\n) in Image J using custom drawn ROIs. This was done to ensure that only dendritic processes contributed to the MAP2 dendritic density quantification. Background values were calculated and subtracted within images. A threshold value was then chosen for a given immunostain so that only immunopositive elements of the spinal gray matter were selected for image analysis similar to previous studies (\nKao et al., 2006\n;\nKong et al., 2010\n). This threshold value was kept constant for all images across all groups within a given immunostain. The number of pixels occupied by immunolabeled structures within the spinal gray matter was measured. This was then divided by the total amount of pixels in the selected spinal gray ROI to obtain Density (percent of immunopositive pixels).\n\nData Analysis and Statistics\nNormality tests were performed for each analysis to determine if parametric or nonparametric statistics should be used. For IHC data, each density measure from a single animal was counted as an independent sample. All statistical tests were performed in SPSS v18 (IBM). Unless Bonferroni corrections are noted, an alpha level of 0.05 was accepted for significance.\nEffects in the acute dose response curve test on BBB, HL tremor and caudal serotonin syndrome scores were evaluated using a two-way repeated measures ANOVAs. The first factor was Time with two levels: Early and Late. The second factor was Dose with three levels: Sal., 0.075 mg/kg, 0.125 mg/kg. Dunnett\u2019s post-hoc test was used to determine differences in behavioral scores between dose. Bonferroni corrected post-hoc t-tests were used to determine differences in behavioral scores between weeks for specific doses (alpha level = 0.025).\nEffect of time on BBB score was evaluated using a Mann-Whitney U test. Effect of therapy on BBB score was evaluated using a one-way ANOVA. The factor was Therapy Group with three levels: Bike, 5-HT and 5-HT+Bike. BBB scores of 8 or lower correspond to non-weight supported locomotor behaviors (NWS BBB), whereas BBB scores of 9 and above correspond to weight supported locomotor behaviors (WS BBB). For each therapy group, the ratio of NWS BBB scores to WS BBB scores was calculated. Effect of therapy on the proportion of WS and NWS BBB scores was assessed using Bonferroni corrected two-proportions tests (alpha level = 0.025).\nEffects of time and therapy on 5-HT, 5-HT\n2A\nR and 5-HT\n1A\nR protein densities were each evaluated using separate one-way ANOVAs for the given protein across spinal gray matter ROIs. For the effect of time, the factor for each spinal gray matter ROI protein density assessment was Group with three levels: Naive, Early, and Late. For the effect of therapy, the factor for each spinal ROI protein density assessment was Group with four levels: Naive, Bike, 5-HT, and 5- HT+Bike. Differences between group were determined using Tukey post-hoc tests. Finally, effects of time and therapy on MAP2 dendrite density were each evaluated separately using oneway ANOVAs to assess their impact on anatomical neuronal plasticity (\nAzmitia et al., 1995\n;\nRamos et al., 2004\n;\nHarada et al., 2002\n). The Group factors and post-hoc tests for effect of time and therapy on MAP2 were identical to those used for 5-HT protein analyses."

A complete breakdown of the number of animals from each genetic background used in the experiments performed here is presented in\nTable 1\n. Animals were obtained from two local colonies of transgenic mouse lines bred in pairs as homozygous mutants. PTEN-floxed mice (PTEN\nfl/fl\n; n = 123) on a 129S background contain flox sequences around exon 5 of the PTEN gene. PTEN/SOCS3-floxed mice (PTEN/SOCS3\nfl/fl\n; n = 118) on a B6/129S background were generated from breeding pairs donated by Dr. Zhigang He, Children\u2019s Hospital, Boston.

All procedures were approved by the University of California Irvine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8\nth\nedition, 2011).\n\nSurgical procedures\nSciatic nerve crushes were performed under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia (10 and 1 mg/kg, respectively) administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). A dorsal incision was made on the left side from hip to knee so the biceps femoris and gluteus superficialis could be split by blunt dissection, exposing the left sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve was separated from the surrounding muscle up to the medial junction of the biceps femoris and gluteus superficialis, where the sciatic nerve turns away from midline. The nerve was crushed twice at this location for 15 seconds each at 90 degree angles relative to one another to reduce the possibility of sparing. Following sciatic nerve crush, the overlying muscles were closed with a single cat gut suture and the overlying skin was closed with staples.\nMice used to determine the effect of PTEN or PTEN/SOCS3 co-deletion received direct injections of AAV vectors into the fourth and fifth lumbar dorsal root ganglia (L4/5 DRG) two weeks prior to sciatic nerve crush. Following a midline incision over the L2 to S2 vertebrae, the left L4/5 DRG were exposed by hemi-laminectomy. A volume of 1 \u03bcL of AAV-Cre (1 \u00d7 10\n9\ninfectious units / \u03bcL) was injected into each of the DRG using a Hamilton syringe attached to a 35 ga. beveled needle. Vector controls received the same volume of AAV-GFP and sham controls underwent hemi-laminectomy alone. Fast Green dye was added to both AAV-Cre and AAV-GFP solutions (final concentration of 0.1%) to allow confirmation of successful intraganglionic injection. Following injections, the surrounding erector spinae muscles were closed with two cat gut sutures and the overlying skin was closed with staples.\n\nBehavioral testing\nFour groups of mice were used for behavioral experiments (n = 10-11 per group,\nTable 1\n). Sham surgery and AAV-GFP vector control groups included both PTEN\nfl/fl\nand PTEN/SOCS3\nfl/fl\nmice. Mice were handled daily for one week and trained for two weeks prior to data collection. Baseline measurements were recorded two weeks prior to DRG injections or sham surgeries. An additional baseline was recorded four hours prior to sciatic nerve crush to determine if DRG injections affected behavior. Following sciatic nerve crush, measurements were recorded weekly for eight weeks by a blinded observer.\nNoxious thermosensation was measured using a Hargreave\u2019s apparatus (#390G, IITC). Mice were placed into individual plexiglass compartments with opaque dividers over a glass base plate. The base plate was heated to 33 \u00b0C to prevent the base from acting as a heat sink. Mice were acclimated for 20 minutes prior to testing. The active intensity of the light source was set at 53 % to achieve a baseline withdrawal latency near 5 sec. The maximum stimulation time was set at 15 sec (3\u00d7 baseline) to avoid damaging the hind paw. The light source was focused on the lateral surface of the hind paw behind the hypothenar foot pad to avoid stimulation of the medial regions of the hind paw innervated by the saphenous nerve. Reported measurements are the average of three trials separated by at least 5 min.\nMechanosensation was measured using graded von Frey filaments. Mice were tested in the same plexiglass compartments used for testing with the Hargreave\u2019s apparatus on top of an anodized metal mesh platform with 1/4\u201d waffle holes that allow access to the plantar surface of the paw (#410, IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA). Mice were allowed to acclimate for 20 minutes prior to testing. Filaments in the range of 3.22, 3.61, 3.84, 4.08, 4.31, and 4.56 log units (mean distance = 0.238) were applied to the center of the left hind paw between the foot pads beginning with the 3.84 filament. Fifty per cent paw withdrawal threshold was calculated using the up-down method (\nChaplan et al., 1994\n). Mice that did not respond to any filaments following sciatic nerve crush were assigned a paw withdrawal threshold of 4.5 g.\nMotor function was assessed using an automated catwalk system equipped with CatWalk XT 8.1 software (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, Netherlands). Mice were placed in a dark box with Froot Loops\u00ae cereal at one end of the catwalk for 3 min prior to testing. Mice were then removed from the box and placed at the opposite end of the catwalk. Paw print length and width were averaged over three successful runs separated by 2 min to maintain the positive reinforcement of the dark box. These measurements were used to calculate sciatic function index using a modified equation from Inserra and colleagues (\nInserra et al., 1998\n).\n\nWestern blots\nThe time course of PI3K and Jak/Stat activation following sciatic nerve crush was assessed by Western blot of tissue from both PTEN\nfl/fl\nand PTEN/SOCS3\nfl/fl\nmice. At 0 (uninjured control), 1, 3, 7, 15, and 30 days following sciatic nerve crush, mice (n = 12 per time point for 72 total; 30 PTEN\nfl/fl\nand 42 PTEN/SOCS3\nfl/fl\n) were euthanized by i.p. injection of 0.1 mL Fatal-Plus (sodium pentobarbital). Mice were transcardially perfused with ice cold 0.1 M PBS with 0.1 % protease (04693124001, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and phosphatase inhibitors (04906837001, Roche). Left L4/5 DRG were quickly extracted, placed in HCl lysis buffer with 1 % phosphatase and protease inhibitors on dry ice, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until homogenization. At the time of homogenization, the left L4/5 DRG of four animals within the same time point were pooled to have sufficient material to perform Western blots, resulting in three samples per time point. These DRG pools were randomly generated from age-matched mice within the same time point irrespective of genetic background. A total of 5 \u03bcg of protein per pool was run in Mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (456-1095, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Gels were run as sets that contained one sample from each treatment group and transferred onto individual PVDF membranes (926-31098, Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). Membranes (926-31098, Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE) were blocked (927-40000, Li-Cor) and stained with combinations of primary antibodies listed in\nTable 2\n. Combinations of the secondary antibodies IRDye 800CW goat anti-rabbit (1:15,000; 926-32211, Li-Cor) and IRDye 680RD goat anti-mouse (1:15,000; 926-68070, Li-Cor) were applied for visualization. Western blots were analyzed for fluorescence levels using a Li-Cor Odyssey FC Imaging System equipped with Image Studio version 3.1.\nTable 2.\nPrimary antibodies\nAntigen\nImmunogen\nManufacturer (Cat.

Mice received AAV-Cre (n = 36 per strain) or AAV-GFP (n = 12; 3 PTEN\nfl/fl\nand 9 PTEN/SOCS3\nfl/fl\n) injections as described under\nSurgical Procedures\n. Additional mice (n = 12; 4 PTEN\nfl/fl\nand 8 PTEN/SOCS3\nfl/fl\n) served as na\u00efve (uninjected/uninjured) controls. Two weeks after injection, mice underwent sciatic nerve crush (n = 60) or were processed for Western blot (0 day, n = 24, 12 per strain) as described above. Mice that underwent sciatic nerve crush were euthanized 3 or 7 days later and processed for Western blot as above. DRG pools from na\u00efve and AAV-GFP vector control groups were randomly generated from age-matched mice irrespective of genetic background. AAV-Cre injected DRG pools were randomly generated from age-matched mice with respect to their genetic background.\n\nImmunofluorescence\nMice used for immunofluorescent studies (n = 15) were euthanized by i.p. injection of 0.1 mL Fatal-Plus\u00ae and transcardially perfused with 4 % paraformaldehyde. L4 DRG were extracted at 0 (uninjured control), 1, 3, 7, 15, and 30 days following sciatic nerve crush (n = 3 per time point). Sciatic nerves were extracted 3 days after sciatic nerve crush (n = 12; 9 PTEN\nfl/fl\nand 3 PTEN/SOCS3\nfl/fl\n). All tissue was post-fixed for an additional 6 hours before being transferred to 27 % sucrose. DRG or sciatic nerves were longitudinally cryo-sectioned at 20 \u03bcm and direct-mounted on slides. Slide-mounted sections were incubated in primary antibodies listed in\nTable 2\nfollowed by donkey anti-rabbit 488 (1:400; A-21206, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) or goat anti-rabbit 594 (1:400; A-11037, Life Technologies) and then coverslipped in VectaShield mounting medium (H-1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).\n\nAntibody characterization\nPTEN\nThe antibody against PTEN recognized a single band at 55 kDa from whole cell lysates of DRG analyzed by Western blot in our study (\nFigures 2\n&\n3\n; predicted molecular weight of 47 kDa). The manufacturer reports a single band at 54 kDa in HeLa, NIH/3T3, C6, and COS-7 cells, but not the PTEN-mutated PC3 and LNCap prostate cancer cell lines. No band appears in whole cell lysates from the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB 415 harboring a PTEN mutation (\nForster et al., 2011\n).\nFigure 2.

PI3K signaling is greatly elevated at 3 days post-injury as shown by a five-fold increase in the level of p-S6 as compared to controls. p-S6 levels in DRG lysates returned to baseline within 7 days of injury.\nB:\nRepresentative image of PTEN expression in DRG 3 days post-injury showing that injury does not alter the localization of PTEN in small diameter neurons.\nC:\nRepresentative image of p-S6 in DRG 3 days post-injury showing sustained phosphorylation of S6 in large diameter neurons and increased S6 phosphorylation in smaller diameter neurons.\nD:\nGraphical representation of the average diameter of neurons positively stained for p-S6 (n = 3 per time point).

Jak/Stat signaling is activated at early time points after injury as shown by elevated p-Stat3 levels at 1 and 3 days post-injury. As with PI3K signaling, Jak/Stat signaling returns to baseline within 7 days of injury following an upward trend in SOCS3 expression that does not reach significance.\nB:\nRepresentative image of p-Stat3 expression in 0 day uninjured control DRG showing a lack of p-Stat3-positive nuclei.\nC:\nRepresentative image of p-Stat3 expression 7 days post-injury showing a large number of p-Stat3-positive nuclei in both small and large diameter neurons.\nD:\nGraphical representation of the number of p-Stat3-positive nuclei quantified in every 6\nth\nsection throughout the whole DRG (n = 3 per time point). Individual data points are indicated by hollow circles. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs 0 day uninjured controls. Scale bar = 100 \u03bcm.\np-S6\nThe antibody against p-S6 recognized a single band at 32 kDa in Western blots of DRG lysates (\nFigures 2\n&\n3\n; predicted molecular weight of 29 kDa). Staining is abolished in endometrial cancer cell lines in the presence of the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus (\nYang et al., 2011\n). Further documentation that immunostaining reflects phosphorylation comes from studies demonstrating robust increases in immunostaining in situations known to induce S6 phosphorylation, for example in dentate granule cells following induction of perforant path LTP (Salgado et al., 2016).\np-Stat3\nThe antibody against p-Stat3 recognizes two bands at 86 (Stat3\u03b1) and 79 kDa (Stat3\u03b2) in Western blots of HeLa cells only after treatment with IFN\u03b3 (manufacturer information). In Western blots from our DRG lysates, the antibody recognized the 86 kDa band as well as an additional band near 40 kDa (\nFigures 2\n&\n3\n); the intensity of this band fluctuated with the band at 86 kDa. In DRG sections, the expected nuclear staining pattern was observed only after injury.\nSOCS3\nThe antibody against SOCS3 recognizes a single band at 27 kDA in Western blots of IFN\u03b3-treated HeLa cells (manufacturer information). In Western blots from our DRG lysates, the antibody against SOCS3 recognized this same band as well as an additional non-specific band near 80 kDa (\nFigure 2\n).\n\u03b2-actin\nThe antibody against \u03b2-actin recognized a single band at 42 kDa in our study. This antibody does not recognize the \u03b1 form of actin as shown by negative staining from Western blots of cardiac tissue (\nKawaja et al., 2011\n).\nSuperior cervical ganglion-10 (SCG10)\nSCG10 (also known as stathmin-2) is a known regulator of microtubule stability and was used as a marker of regenerating axons in the sciatic nerve. In our study, no SCG10 staining was observed in uninjured sciatic nerves. Following injury, the expected pattern of staining\u2014axons extending short distances beyond the injury site and ending in growth cones\u2014was observed, consistent with previous reports for this marker (\nShin et al., 2014\n).\n\nImaging and analysis\nStained sections were imaged using an Olympus AX80 equipped with cellSens Standard imaging software. Both the DRG and sciatic nerves were imaged at 20\u00d7 magnification. Stitched images of individual sections were generated using cellSens Standard before image analysis, ensuring that all objects of interest in each section were analyzed only once.\nThe diameters of neuronal profiles expressing proteins of interest were quantified using ImageJ software (NIH). Analysis for each staining was performed in every sixth section throughout the L4 DRG. The diameter was recorded along the long-axis of every neuronal profile that displayed a clear nuclear shadow. Data represent the mean of the total number of positive cells quantified for each animal.\nTo quantify regeneration of SCG10-expressing axons in stitched images of the sciatic nerve, images were imported into ImageJ; a line was placed along the proximal boundary of the crush lesion perpendicular to the nerve axis and at every 250 \u03bcm relative to this reference. The number of labeled axons that crossed these lines was quantified by a blind observer in every sixth section.\n\nStatistics\nWestern blot and cell count data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison test for significance. Regeneration data were analyzed by two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Fisher\u2019s LSD. Behavioral data were analyzed by two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of The Ohio State University. All experimental procedures were conducted in compliance with The Ohio State University IACUC guidelines and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th edition. Experiments have been reported in accordance with ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of\nIn Vivo\nExperiments) guidelines. C57BL/6N mice were used unless otherwise noted. Mice from postnatal day (P) 21\u201335 of both sexes weighing 9 to 16 grams were used for brain slices and freshly dissociated astrocyte preparation; P0-P1 mice were used for hippocampal neuron culture preparation. mT/mG;PDGFR\u03b1-CreER\nT2\nreporter mice from P21\u201335 of both sexes were used for identification of NG2 glia\n20\n.\n\nPreparation of acute hippocampal slices\nHippocampal slices were prepared as described previously\n21\n,\n22\n. Briefly, after anesthesia with 8% chloral hydrate in 0.9% NaCl, mouse brains were rapidly removed from skulls and placed into ice-cold oxygenated (95% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\n) slice cutting artificial Cerebrospinal Fluid (aCSF) solution with reduced Ca\n2+\nand increased Mg\n2+\n(in mmol/L): 125 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO\n3\n, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.1 CaCl\n2\n, 3 MgCl\n2\nand 10 Glucose. Coronal hippocampal slices (250 \u03bcm thickness) were cut at 4\u00b0C with a Vibratome (Pelco 1500), and then transferred to a nylon-net basket in an incubator filled with oxygenated standard aCSF (in mmol/L): 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO\n3\n, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 3.5 KCl, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 1 MgCl\n2\nand 10 Glucose (295\u00b15 mOsm; pH 7.3\u20137.4) and allowed to recover at room temperature for at least one hour before recording.\n\nSulforhodamine (SR101) staining\nFor SR101 (Invitrogen) staining\n23\n, the slices were transferred and incubated in another aCSF-filled incubator for 30 min containing 0.6 \u03bcmol/L SR101 at 34\u00b0C. Afterwards, the slices were transferred back to standard aCSF at room temperature before the experiments.\n\nFresh dissociation of hippocampal astrocytes\nAs previously described\n21\n,\n22\n, hippocampal slices at 250 \u03bcm thickness were sectioned from P21\u201335 mice. After incubation with SR101 for 30 min, the CA1 regions were dissected out, cut into small pieces (1 mm\n2\n), and then transferred into oxygenated aCSF in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube supplemented with 24U/ml papain and 0.8 mg/ml L-cysteine. This enzymatic incubation lasted for 7 min at 25\u00b0C. The loosened CA1 tissues were gently triturated 5\u20137 times with a fire-polished glass pipette and then transferred into the recording chamber, where the dispersed small tissue blocks contained single to multiple gap junction-coupled astrocytes with their domains well-preserved in SR101 staining. The number of coupled astrocytes varies among these tissue blocks, which therefore offers a new model, termed the \u201cminiature syncytium\u201d, for the study of astrocyte membrane ion channel and gap junction coupling\n21\n,\n22\n,\n24\n.\n\nPrimary hippocampal neuron cultures\nPrimary hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared as previously described.\n25\nBriefly, the hippocampus was dissected from P0-P1 mice, cut into small pieces, then transferred into Leibovitz's L-15 medium containing 0.38 mg/mL papain and 0.25 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 13 min with 95% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\ngas currents over the medium\u2019s surface. After incubation, the dissected tissue was washed three times with M5-5 medium (Earle's minimal essential medium with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, 0.4 mmol/L L-glutamine, 16.7 mmol/L glucose, 5000 U/L penicillin, 50 mg/L streptomycin, 2.5 mg/L insulin, 16 nmol/L selenite, and 1.4 mg/L transferrin) and triturated. Dissociated cells were then centrifuged at the relative centrifugal force (RCF) of 0.048 Xg for 4.5 min, and M5-5 media was aspirated. Supplemented Neurobasal-A media was then added and the cells were resuspended (1% B27 supplement containing antioxidants, 1% B27supplement without antioxidants, 0.5 mmol/L L-glutamine, 0.5 mg/mL gentamycin, 2.5 mg/L insulin, 16 nmol/L selenite, and 1.4 mg/L transferrin). Cells were plated in 24-well cell culture plates containing 10-mm poly-D-lysine-coated glass coverslips at a density of 5\u00d710\n4\ncells per well. 10 \u03bcmol/L cytosine \u03b2-d-arabinofuranoside was added 48\u201372 h after plating. Neurons were maintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\nfor 10\u201314 days before experiments were performed.\n\nOxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)\nTo simulate ischemic conditions\nin situ\nand\nin vitro\n, glucose was replaced with equimolar sucrose in aCSF, and oxygen was depleted by bubbling the solution with 95% N\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\n(pH 7.3\u20137.4) for 30 min prior to and throughout the 30 min OGD treatment in experiments\n9\n.\n\nImaging acquisition\nA fluorescent imaging system, Polychrome V system (Till Photonics, Germany) was used for high-resolution identification of SR101-positive astrocytes and eGFP-positive NG2 glia.\n\nMeasurement of intracellular K\n+\ncontents from hippocampal slices\nInductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to quantitatively measure the intracellular K\n+\ncontents from hippocampal tissue\n26\n,\n27\n. To ensure mass-equal in slices randomly distributed in the control and OGD groups, two acute hippocampal slices from the left and right hemisphere in each cut were paired as control and OGD. Slices were exposed to 30 min in either OGD conditions or normal aCSF (control). To remove the extracellular K\n+\n, each slice was first washed with 5 mL 0.9% NaCl saline in a culture dish and then transferred into 600 \u03bcL 0.9% NaCl saline in a microcentrifuge tube. The tube was centrifuged at RCF of 0.13 Xg for 2 min, the supernatant was discarded, and fresh 600 uL of 0.9% NaCl saline was added. This washing step was repeated three times.\nFor ICP-MS analysis, 0.05 mL of concentrated nitric acid (Veritas Double Distilled, GFS Chemicals Columbus, OH, USA) was added to each sample in microcentrifuge tubes. After visible signs of reaction ceased, the microcentrifuge tubes (with caps closed) were placed in a floating rack and heated to 85\u00b0C in a water bath for 30 min. After cooling, the digested samples were brought to a total volume of 0.5 mL with deionized water and then further diluted (0.1 mL aliquot of the digested solution to a final volume of 1.0 mL in 10% v/v concentrated nitric acid). The digested samples were analyzed using an ELAN 6100\nplus\nDRC ICP-MS (PerkinElmer Sciex, Waltham, MA, USA) using a PFA-100 micronebulizer (Elemental Scientific, Omaha, NE, USA) at a sample uptake rate of 0.05 mL/min. K\n+\nwas measured at m/z 39 while ammonia gas was delivered to the Dynamic Reaction Cell of the ICP-MS (with RPq=0.55, RPa=0) at a rate of 0.4 mL/min to remove the signal from\n38\nAr\n1\nH\n+\n. The K\n+\ncontent value was normalized to sample weight (\u03bcg K\n+\n/mg sample).\n\nElectrophysiology\nA hippocampal slice was transferred to the recording chamber (RC-22, Warner Instruments, Holliston, MA) mounted on an Olympus BX51WI microscope with constant perfusion of oxygenated aCSF (2.0 mL/min). For the recording of freshly dissociated astrocytes and cultured neurons, oxygenated aCSF perfusion rate was adjusted to 1.5 mL/min.\nWhole-cell patch clamp recording\nMultiClamp 700A amplifier operated by pClamp 9.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used for whole-cell patch clamp recording. Borosilicate glass pipettes (outer diameter: 1.5 mm, Warner Instrument, Hamden, CT) were pulled from a Micropipette Puller (Model P-87, Sutter Instrument). The recording electrodes had a resistance of 2\u20135 M\u03a9; when filled with the electrode solution containing (in mmol/L) 140 K-gluconate, 13.4 Na-gluconate, 0.5 CaCl\n2\n, 1.0 MgCl\n2\n, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 3 Mg-ATP, and 0.3 Na-GTP (280\u00b15 mOsm, pH 7.25\u20137.35)\n28\n,\n29\n. A minimum of 2 G\u03a9; seal resistance was required before rupturing the membrane for whole-cell configuration. The liquid junction potential was compensated for prior to forming the cell-attached mode for all recordings. The\nV\nM\nwas recorded under current clamp mode. For neurons and NG2 glial cells, the access resistance (\nR\na\n), membrane resistance (\nR\nM\n), and membrane capacitance (\nC\nM\n) were measured from the \u201cMembrane test\u201d protocol available in pClamp 9.2 software, and only those recordings where an initial\nR\na\nbelow 20 M\u03a9; was achieved and varied less than 10% were included in data analysis. We have previously demonstrated that the \u201cMembrane test\u201d protocol is unable to compute the\nR\nM\nand\nR\na\nfrom the total membrane input resistance (\nR\nin\n) in low\nR\nM\nastrocytes\n30\n. Thus, we alternatively used\nR\nin\nto monitor OGD-induced change in astrocyte\nR\nM\nusing the \u201cResistance test\u201d protocol available in PClamp 9.2 software (pulse: -63 pA/600 ms). When the initial\nR\nin\nwas greater than 20 M\u03a9; or varied 10% during recording, the recordings were discarded.\nCell-attached patch clamp recording\nThe cell-attached recording mode was used to avoid dialysis of cytoplasmic content by electrode solution\n31\n,\n32\n. In this mode, the recording electrodes were filled with aCSF containing 3.5 mmol/L K\n+\n, which reflects the extracellular K\n+\nconcentration ([K\n+\n]\ne\n). In recordings, the attainment of gigaohm seal was followed by a continuing negative shift in\nV\nM\ntoward the respective resting\nV\nM\nof astrocytes, neurons, and NG2 glia, and this took 15\u201325 min in each recording. To ensure a constant and acceptable quality of gigaohm seal during recording, the\nR\nin\nwas monitored by \u201cResistance test\u201d protocol (pulse: -63 pA/600 ms). Whenever the\nR\nin\nfell below 1 G\u03a9;, an indication of deterioration of gigaohm seal, the recording was terminated and discarded.\nDual patch single astrocyte recording\nAs we have previously reported\n21\n,\n30\n,\n33\n, two patch electrodes were targeted to an astrocytic soma. The applied positive pressure was released sequentially to form gigaohm seal in both electrodes. Negative pressure was then applied sequentially to the two electrodes to form whole-cell configuration. Both electrodes were initially set up in current clamp mode for at least 5 min for ion equilibration between the electrode solution and intracellular cytoplasm. Then one electrode was set in voltage clamp to deliver command voltages (\nV\nCOM\n), \u00b150 mV, and the second electrode remained in current clamp (I=0) mode. Therefore, the\nV\nCOM\ninduced membrane current (\u0394\nI\nM\n) and voltage (\u0394\nV\nM\n) were simultaneously recorded by the two electrodes independently.\n\nData analyses\nPatch clamp recording data were analyzed by Clampfit 9.0 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and Origin 8.0 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Results are given as mean\u00b1SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA,\nt\n-test, and paired sample\nt\n-test. The significance level was set at\nP\n<0.05.\nThe [K\n+\n]\ne\nwas calculated from the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation in the following form:\nE\n=\n(\nRT\n/\nF\n)\nln\n(\n(\nP\nK\n[\nK\n+\n]\ne\n+\nP\nNa\n[\nNa\n+\n]\ne\n+\nP\nCI\n[\nCI\n-\n]\ni\n)\n/\n(\nP\nK\n[\nK\n+\n]\ni\n+\nP\nNa\n[\nNa\n+\n]\ni\n+\nP\nCI\n[\nCI\n-\n]\ne\n)\n)\n.\nE\nis the voltage across the membrane. R, T, and F are the universal gas constant, the temperature in Kelvin, and Faraday\u2019s constant, respectively.\nP\nis the relative permeability of ions at the resting\nV\nM\n. [\nx\n]\ni\nand [\nx\n]\ne\nrefer to the intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations, respectively. For astrocyte and NG2 glia in physiological condition, the\nP\nK\nis 1,\nP\nCl\nis assumed at 0 and\nP\nNa\nis 0.015\n34\n. For neurons in the resting condition, the\nP\nK\nis 1.0, and\nP\nCl\nand\nP\nNa\nare assumed at 0.45 and 0.05, respectively\n35\n. Astrocyte membrane conductance (\nG\nM\n) was calculated from the following equation:\nG\nM\n=\n\u0394\nI\nM\n/\n\u0394\nV\nM\n\u0394\nV\nM\nand \u0394\nI\nM\nwere\nV\nCOM\ninduced change in\nV\nM\nand\nI\nfrom dual patch single cell recording. The\nG\nM\nin inward and outward directions was calculated from the \u0394\nI\nM\n/\u0394\nV\nM\ninduced by the\nV\nCOM\nof -50 mV and +50 mV, respectively.\nA question we asked was the OGD impact on voltage-gated inward Na\n+\ncurrents (\nI\nNa), outward transient (\nI\nKa) and delayed rectifying (\nI\nKd) in both neurons and NG2 glia. In these electrophysiological analyses, we did not isolate individual channel components through channel pharmacology to examine the effect of OGD on channel activation/inactivation kinetics for the following considerations\n36\n,\n37\n. First, the purpose of this study was to examine the overall impact of OGD on neuronal and glial voltage-gated ion channels, rather than the OGD effect on a given type of ion channel. Second, the pharmacological blockers may influence the activity of the investigated channel through additional pathways. Finally, it is not feasible to maintain a viable recording in OGD with the addition of multiple blockers that typically lasts for 70\u201390 min. For the purpose of following electrophysiology conventions, we still used\nI\nNa,\nI\nKa, and\nI\nKd in general terms for the following description."

    "Methods": "Identification and PCR cloning of the RhoA gene from a lamprey genomic database\nThe sea lamprey \u201censemble database\u201d and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) \u201ctrace database\u201d maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, NIH) were used. These databases currently consist of assembled, partially assembled, and raw unassembled sequencing data from the sea lamprey genome (\nSmith et al., 2013\n). RhoA sequences from other species, including human, chicken and zebrafish, were used to query these databases, and the contigs found in the lamprey genomic library were confirmed using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) on NCBI servers. The contigs were further analyzed by aligning them with homologous genes of other species. Then oligonucleotide primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were designed based on the lamprey RhoA gene sequence in regions highly identical with those of other species. Total RNA from lamprey CNS was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The first- strand cDNA synthesis reaction from total RNA was catalyzed by Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase with oligo-dT or 8 bp random primers. The synthesized total cDNA served as templates for PCR cloning using the Expand\n\u2122\nLong Template PCR System (Roche Applied Science) as per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Following amplification, PCR fragments of expected size were purified on 1% agarose gels and ligated into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega). The cloned fragments were sequenced (GENEWIZ, NJ), analyzed and compared by BLAST.\n\nRiboprobe synthesis\nThe cloned lamprey RhoA cDNAs were used as templates for generating biotin-labeled antisense riboprobes. The lamprey RhoA protein contains 194 amino acids and shared >90% amino acid identity with human, mouse, chicken and zebrafish (\nFig. 1\n). A PCR strategy for rapid generation of template was used. The PCR primers were designed to amplify cDNA sequences (513 bp) of the underlined region in\nFig. 1\n, which included almost the full length of the RhoA gene. A T7 promoter sequence was added to the 5\u2032 end of the antisense primer. Biotin-labeled antisense RNA probes were constructed from the amplified cDNA template, which contained the T7 promoter sequence upstream of the antisense-strand, using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) with Biotin RNA-labeling Mix (Roche Applied Science), as recommended by the manufacturer.

The protocol was approved by the Temple University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Lampreys were deeply anesthetized by immersion in saturated aqueous benzocaine until motionless to tail pinch, then pinned onto a Sylgard-coated dissecting dish filled with ice-cold lamprey Ringer (\nLurie et al., 1994\n). The spinal cords were completely transected at the level of the 5th gill, and the animals allowed to recover up to 10 weeks. A total of 118 animals were investigated; 28 were used in RhoA\nin situ\nhybridization (ISH) studies on wholemounted lamprey brains, 13 in RhoA ISH on paraffin sections, and another 77 were used to study activated RhoA labeling in brain wholemounts alone or with CSPG treatment, as summarized in\nTable 1\n. To assess developmental changes in RhoA mRNA expression by wholemount ISH, 2 adults (13 and 14 cm) were included in the control group.\nTable 1.

This identified an occasional apoptotic reticulospinal neuron as early as one week post-transection, reaching a peak by 4 weeks (\nHu et al., 2017\n). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) commonly has been used as an apoptotic marker, but it took approximately 4 weeks after SCI before any axotomized neurons were TUNEL positive, and TUNEL labeling did not peak until 12\u201316 weeks (\nShifman et al., 2008\n).\nThe brains were removed under re-anesthesia at desired recovery times, as indicated in\nTable 1\n, then stripped of choroid plexus and processed for activated caspases using the Image-iT\n\u2122\nLIVE Green Poly Caspases Detection Kit, which detects most caspases, including caspase-1, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, and -9 (\nI35104\n, Invitrogen). To prevent mRNA degradation, we have modified the protocol provided by the manufacturer, so that all FLICA staining procedures were carried out at 4\u00b0C. Freshly removed brains were incubated immediately in 300 \u03bcl of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 2 \u03bcl of 150x FLICA labeling solution for 1 hour and washed with wash buffer in the dark on a rotator 5 times for 5 minutes each. After washes, the cerebrotectal commissure was cut and brains were pinned flat on a small strip of Sylgard, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 2 hours, and then washed with PBS in the dark on a rotator 3 times for 15 minutes each. The brains were mounted wet on a glass slide, observed and photographed (80i, Nikon). The brains were then washed again with PBS 3 times for 5 minutes each and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C in 70% ethanol for ISH or activated Rho assay. The correlation between FLICA positivity was correlated with expression of RhoA mRNA and/or Rho activation in the same neurons (see below).\n\nIn situ\nhybridization on wholemounted brain\nWholemount ISH was carried out on the brains with or without FILCA-labeling by a modification of the chromogenic method previously described (\nSwain et al., 1994\n). Briefly, wholemounted brain preparations were washed in PTW (0.1% Tween-20 in PBS) and pre-hybridized at 50\u201355 \u00b0C in hybridization solution (50% deionized formamide, 5X SSC, 100 mg/ml Torula yeast RNA, 100 mg/ml wheat germ tRNA, 50 mg/ml heparin, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 hour, followed by hybridization overnight on a nutator at 55 \u00b0C in above solution containing 1 \u03bcg/ml biotin-labeled antisense RNA probes for RhoA. Specimens were washed in hybridization solution at 55 \u00b0C, followed by room temperature washes in PTW and PBT (0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS). Alkaline phosphatase (AP)- conjugated Streptavidin (1:1000, Roche Applied Science) was applied to tissue overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The tissue was washed sequentially in PBT and SMT (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 100 mM Tris, pH 9.5, 0.1% Tween-20), and the chromogenic reaction was carried out in a solution containing 20 \u03bcl of NBT/BCIP stock solution (Roche Applied Science) per 1 ml of SMT, as described in the manufacture\u2019s manual, on ice in the dark for 15 minutes or until the reaction was completed (staining was monitored under a dissecting microscope). Finally, specimens were washed in PBS and mounted in 50% glycerol. Bright-field images were captured on a Nikon 80i microscope.\nIn order to correlate RhoA mRNA expression with actual axon regeneration, in two animals at 8 weeks post- transection, a dextran tetramethyl-rhodamine- (DTMR, 10 kDa, 5% in 0.1 M Tris buffer, pH 7.4) soaked Gelfoam plug was inserted into a second spinal cord transection 5 mm caudal to the first transection, in order to label neurons whose axons had regenerated to this level. One week later, when the fluorescent tracer had successfully backfilled regenerated reticulospinal neurons, the brain was removed and processed for FLICA and ISH for RhoA as above.\n\nIn situ\nhybridization on paraffin sections\nTo confirm the results seen in wholemounts, ISH also was performed on paraffin sections. Lampreys were re- anesthetized and the brain and spinal cord proximal to the transection site were fixed in 4% PFA for 3 to 4 hours. Tissues were rinsed in PBS, dehydrated in serial ethanols overnight in a tissue processor and embedded in paraffin. Horizontal, sagittal or transverse paraffin- sections of brain or spinal cord (10 \u03bcm, will mention in figure legends) were deparaffinized and processed for ISH as described previously (\nSwain et al. 1994\n). Briefly, after rehydration, sections were washed in PTW, and pre-hybridized as above at 50\u201355 \u00b0C for 1 hour. The biotin-conjugated RhoA probe was applied to slides at a concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/ml in hybridization solution, and incubated overnight at 55 \u00b0C. To prevent evaporation, the slides were covered by HybriSlip (Sigma-Aldrich) and kept in a moist chamber. The next day, slides were washed in hybridization solution at 55 \u00b0C, then PTW and PBT at room temperature. AP-conjugated Streptavidin diluted 1:1000 in PBT was applied overnight at 4\u00b0C. The sections were washed in PBT then in SMT and the NBT/BCIP chromogenic reaction was performed as described above for 10\u201315 minutes. The reaction was stopped in PBS and the slides were dehydrated, cleared and mounted in Permount.\n\nLectin histochemistry\nThe distribution of microglial cells was determined, at 2 weeks post- transection. The brain and spinal cord rostral to the transection site were fixed and treated with a microglia-specific label, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated GSA isolectin B4 (Sigma), which binds to D-galactose residues in both resting and activated microglial cells (\nStreit, 1990\n). Serial sagittal paraffin-sections (10 \u03bcm) were deparaffinized, rehydrated, washed in PBS and treated in 0.3% H\n2\nO\n2\ndH\n2\nO for 30 min. The sections were incubated with GSA I- B4-HRP (5 \u03bcg/ml in PBS) at room temperature for 2 hours, followed by 3 washes in PBS with 0.1% Triton-X 100, and once in PBS, 5 min each. The sections were colorized in Metal-Enhanced DAB Substrate (Thermo Scientific) for 10 min, then washed, dehydrated and mounted in Permount. Six sagittal sections near the midline were collected in each of five 0.3 mm lengths of spinal cord, starting from the transection site and going rostralward. Images were captured with a Nikon 80i microscope, and theB4-positive cells were counted in each length. The results were compared to those from uninjured controls.\n\nIn situ\nGTP-Rho binding assay to detect RhoA activation\nThe Rho-GTP binding domain (RBD) of human Rhotekin binds specifically to the active GTP-bound forms of Rho A/B/C proteins, but not the GDP-bound forms (\nReid et al., 1996\n), thereby serving as an activation-specific probe. Glutathione-S-transferase-fused Rhotekin-RBD (GST-RBD) is commonly used in RhoA pulldown activation assays, and has been adapted to assay\nin situ\nRho GTPase activity (\nLi et al., 2002\n,\nDubreuil et al., 2003\n). To investigate activation of RhoA in lamprey reticulospinal neurons after SCI, following FLICA staining, the brains were rinsed 3 times for 1 hour each at room temperature in TPBS (0.2 % Tween-20 in PBS), blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in PBS for 1 hour, and incubated in GST-RBD (5 \u03bcg/ml) for 2 days at 4\u00b0C. Brains were rinsed and blocked as above and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in AP-conjugated GST antibody (1:200 in blocking solution, Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc). The brains then were washed 3 times for 30 minutes each in PBT 3 \u00d7 30 minutes and 3 times for 30 minutes each in SMT. The chromogenic reaction was carried out as described above for wholemount ISH. GST-RBD binds not only to RhoA but also to Rho B and C, which share more than 85% amino acid sequence identity with RhoA. Although in neurons RhoA is expressed at higher levels than RhoB and RhoC (\nLehmann et al., 1999\n), to confirm that neurons labeled by GST-RBD also expressed RhoA, we performed triple labeling of FLICA, GST-RBD and RhoA ISH, and found colocalization of RhoA ISH and GST-RBD labeling.\n\nRhoA immunostaining\nTo investigate colocalization of RhoA protein with RhoA mRNA and activated Rho in axons near the transection site, serial sagittal paraffin-sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and washed in PBS then processed for ISH, GST-RBD as above, and RhoA immunostaining. For RhoA immunostaining, antigen retrieval was performed - sections were immersed in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0) and microwaved for 20 min, then allowed to cool in room temperature for 20 min. Sections were rinsed in PBS twice for 5 min/each and blocked (10% FBS in PBS with 0.2% Tween-20) for 10 min at room temperature and incubated with anti-RhoA (SC-418, Santa Cruz) in blocking buffer 1:200 at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Sections were washed 3 times with PBS, and then incubated with an ABC kit (VECTASTAIN, Vector laboratories), as per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The sections were dehydrated and mounted in Permount.\n\nTriple labeling with FLICA, GST-RBD, and PTP\u03c3 ISH\nTo investigate co-localization among activated RhoA, PTP\u03c3 mRNA, and FLICA positivity in the same reticulospinal neurons, FLICA staining was first performed on fresh tissue of five lamprey brains at 9 weeks post- transection, and the results photographed. Then double chromogenic AP detection for GST-RBD and ISH were performed, each using a different AP substrate. This required that the first substrate be washed out and AP be inactivated before the second labeling can be processed. Lamprey brains were processed for GST-RBD labeling as above, except that they were first developed in the dark at room temperature for 20 minutes, or until the reaction was complete, in the alcohol-soluble AP chromogen INT/BCIP (7.5 \u03bcl stock solution per 1 ml of SMT, Roche Applied Science). This was followed by 3 washes in dH\n2\nO, 5 minutes each, and then one 30-minute wash in 0.1M Tris-HCl (pH 8.2). The samples were mounted in 20% glycerol in Tris-buffer and photographed with a bright- field microscope (80i Nikon). The AP-conjugated GST antibody was inactivated by treating the specimens with 0.1M glycine buffer (pH 2.2) in 0.1% Tween-20 for 20 minutes at 37\u00b0C. After briefly washing in Tris-buffer 3 times, the magenta color of INT/BCIP was removed by washing through serial ethanols of 70%, 80%, 90% and 95%, then back to 70%, 5 minutes each, then 3 times in PTW, 5 minutes each. The samples were rephotographed. Although often, a faint blue INT/BCIP staining remained, this did not affect co-localization observations. To verify that the procedure removed all AP activity, following the above procedure, a sample was treated with a second AP substrate (NBT/BCIP), and the absence of new staining confirmed the elimination of AP activity. The brain samples were then processed for PTP\u03c3 ISH, and colorized by NBT/BCIP as described above. Because NBT/BCIP cannot be removed easily, it had to be used as the final chromogen. As described in the company literature, the sensitivity of INT/BCIP is not as great as that of NBT/BCIP. Therefore, to insure that the results above were not affected by differential sensitivity of the AP substrates, in some experiments, the order of labeling was reversed,\ni.e.\n, ISH labeling was carried out first, using INT/BCIP, followed by GST-RBD, using NBT/BCIP. No differences in labeling frequency or intensity were observed.\n\nSemiquantitative scale for neuronal labeling\nTo correlate expression of RhoA mRNA or activation of caspases or RhoA with the previously-determined probabilities of regeneration for identified reticulospinal neurons, a semi-quantitative integer scale from 0 to 3 was used to estimate the staining intensity of RhoA ISH, FLICA and GST-RBD in individual identified reticulospinal neurons, as described previously (\nZhang et al., 2014\n). For each reticulospinal neuron type, a normalized RhoA ISH, FLICA or GST-RBD labeling score (% maximum) was calculated for each group of animals as follows: The staining intensity scores of each individual neuron of that type were summed and the result was divided by the maximum possible summed staining intensity scores (\ni.e.\n, the number of animals x 2 cells of each type per animal x the maximum semiquantitative score of 3 per cell) multiplied by 100. For example, if in 25 animals at a given time post- transection, the sum of the semiquantitative FLICA scores in all the Mauthner cells equaled 55, then the FLICA labeling score would be ((55/25 animals) x 2 Mauthner cells per animal x 3)) x 100 = 36.7%. The intensity scores for individual neuron types were then correlated with the previously- determined probabilities that their axon would regenerate 5mm beyond the lesion by 10 weeks post- transection (\nJacobs et al., 1997\n). The activations of caspases and RhoA in each identified neuron type were investigated from 1\u20139 weeks post- transection.\n\nEffect of CSPGs on retrograde neuronal death\nIt has been suggested that CSPGs secreted at the site of CNS injury inhibit axon regeneration by activating RhoA downstream of their RPTPs. To test whether exogenous CSPGs activate RhoA and accelerate neuronal death, a mixture of purified CSPGs containing neurocan, versican, phosphacan and aggrecan (5.2 \u03bcg/ml; Millipore) was applied to the transection site\nvia\na soaked Gelfoam. After survival times indicated in\nTable 1\n, the brains were removed under anesthesia and processed for FLICA followed by GST-RBD staining and PTP\u03c3 ISH as described above. The number of FLICA-positive neurons were counted and compared among the groups.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData sets were analyzed with the InStat software (GraphPad3). The effect of SCI on expression levels of RhoA mRNA was determined for each of the 18 paired identified reticulospinal neuron types by calculating a % of maximum possible score compared to the controls (see above) for each time post- transection (ANOVA and post hoc two-tailed\nt\n-test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). The effect of exogenous CSPGs on apoptosis signaling was determined for each post- transection time by comparing total numbers of FLICA-labeled neurons in the CSPG-treated group with that in the corresponding control group, using the unpaired two-tailed\nt\n-test. Correlation analysis was by Pearson Correlation test. All values were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM."

    "Methods": "All experiments were approved by the Institutional Care and Use Committee at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland. Animals were housed in groups of three, exposed to a normal dark-light cycle with free access to food, water, and environmental enrichment ad libitum. The health and welfare of the animals was monitored by the study investigators and veterinary staff at Case Western Reserve University.\n\n2.1. Surgical procedures and diaphragm electromyography (diaEMG) recordings\n2.1.1. Left lateral C3 contusion\nAdult male Sprague Dawley rats (334.9 \u00b1 3.48 g;\nn\n= 52; Harlan Laboratories Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA) were anesthetized through intraperitonal (i.p.) injection with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail (70 mg kg\n\u20131\n/7 mg kg\n\u22121\n). Upon reaching a surgical plane of anaesthesia, animals were shaved and the dorsal neck cleansed with Betadine and 70% ethyl alcohol. Carprofen (5 mg/kg) was administered through subcutaneous (s.c.) injection while 0.002% bupivacaine hydrochloride injections were applied along the site of incision. Body temperature was maintained throughout surgery at 37 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. A dorsal midline incision, ~3 cm in length, was made over the cervical region and the skin and paravertebral muscles retracted. A laminectomy was performed over C2 and C3 exposing the spinal cord but keeping the dura intact. Animals were placed in the Infinite Horizon contusion impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation) with clamps placed around the C2 and C3 lamina to stabilise the cord during the injury. Animals received a 150 kD left lateral contusion with zero dwell time (\nn\n= 27). The anatomical completeness of the injury was confirmed through microscopy following cresyl violet staining. All procedures were performed on sham injured animals (\nn\n= 26), apart from the contusion. No animals died following the surgery, although contused animals typically required 10 mins of manual ventilation following the initial trauma. A subcutaneous injection of yohimbine (1.2mg/Kg, Tocris) was administered to reverse the effect of the respiratory depressant xylazine. The muscle layers were sutured together (3\u20130 vicryl) and the skin closed using wound clips. Following surgery, animals were given buprenorphine (30 \u03bcg/kg) and saline subcutaneously. Analgesics were maintained up to five-days post-surgery.\n2.1.2. EMG recordings and right lateral C2 hemisection\nAt pre-determined end points, animals were anesthetised through i.p. injection of urethane (1.6 mg/kg). Upon reaching a surgical plane of anaesthesia, animals were shaved and the dorsal neck cleansed with Betadine and 70% ethyl alcohol. 0.002% bupivacaine hydrochloride injections were applied along the site of incision. Body temperature was maintained throughout surgery at 37 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. With the animal in prone position, a 5-cm laparotomy was performed to expose the abdominal surface of the diaphragm. Further, lateral 2 cm incisions were made over the left and right rib cage and the latissimus dorsi blunt dissected to expose the external intercostals at T1 and T2. Finally, a 1 cm midline incision was made down the animal\u2019s throat. The digastric muscle was retracted to expose the genioglossus. Bipolar platinum electrodes (Grass Technology, Middleton, WI, USA) were placed in the crural region of the left and right hemidiaphrams (dorsal to the anterolateral branch of the inferior phrenic artery), into the left and right external intercostals at Tl, and into the left genioglossus muscle. Activity was amplified (gain 5000 \u00d7; Quad-P511 Amplifier; Grass Technology), band pass filtered (30\u20133000 Hz; Grass Technology), digitized, and recorded using a data acquisition system (CED1401; Spike2; Cambridge Electronic Design). The integrated signal was rectified and smoothed at a time constant of 0.075 s. All recordings were obtained during eupnea prior to a 20-s nasal occlusion.\nAs described previously (\nAwad et al., 2013\n), during end-point EMG recordings, a lateral right C2 hemisection was performed in order to remove descending input to the contused phrenic motor pool from the contralateral uninjured side. A dorsal midline incision ~3 cm in length was made over the cervical region and the skin and paravertebral muscles were retracted. Using micro scissors, the C2/3 spinal cord was re-exposed and durotomy performed. Using a 21G needle (with the tip positioned towards the mid-line), a right lateral hemisection was performed caudal to the C2 dorsal roots. The incision was made till the needle had reached the ventral lamina surface. This process was repeated five times and extended from the midline to the most lateral extent of the spinal cord. The functional completeness of the injury was confirmed through absence of activity in the right diaEMG.\nTime to cease left diaEMG activity was calculated from the last breath prior to completing the hemisection to the final peak on the integrated response. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Bonferroni (SPSS). Divergences were considered significant if\np\n< 0.05. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. At the time of recording and analysis, investigators were blind to the treatment group of each animal. A total of 43 animals underwent terminal EMG recordings (\nn\n= 22 contusion;\nn =\n21 sham).\n\n2.2. Whole body plethysmography (WBP) recordings\nIndividual animals were placed in Perspex plethysmography chambers (DSI). Airflow within the chamber was maintained at 2 L/min using a flow controllers (DSI). Prior to each recording, the chambers air-tight seal was assessed and air volumes calibrated (DSI) which was used to calculate tidal volume (VT) changes in respiratory activity. Animals were acclimated to the chambers by placing then in the closed environment for increasing lengths of time for five days prior to the first recording. The animals core body temperature was assessed at the conclusion of each experiment using a rectal thermometer (Physitemp). Measurements were continuously recorded through the proprietary Pomenah software (DSI). Animals were placed in the chambers for 100 mins, the first 60 of which acted as an acclimation period and was never analysed. Through the remaining 40 mins, rates of ventilation (VE) through normoxia (normal air) were assessed. Recordings were performed one day prior to the contusion (baseline), three days following injury, and then weekly up to twelve weeks post trauma. Baseline recordings were not statistically different from those conducted during the acclimation for each animal (\np\n= ns) indicating the stability of the baseline. Statistical comparisons were made between treatment groups and within plethysmography measurements using one-way or two-way, repeated-measures ANOVA (SPSS). Divergences were considered significant if\np\n< 0.05. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. At the time of recording and analysis, investigators were blind as to the treatment group of each animal. 20 animals underwent WBP recordings (\nn\n= 10 sham, n = 10 contusion). This includes the 5 sham and contusion animals that additionally had EMG recordings.\n\n2.3. Data analysis and ventilatory pattern variability\nThe raw plethysmography data was transferred to a custom software program (Case Western Reserve University) and assessed in three 60 s epochs taken at ~70, 80, and 90 mins into the recording while the animal was at rest. Animals were monitored during the recording to verify their physiological state (i.e. relaxed, walking, sniffing, grooming). For each epoch, the software system identified discrete breaths which were manually verified and then data averaged for each animal.\nAs described previously (\nChung et al., 2013\n;\nDhingra et al., 2011\n), Mutual Information (MI) and Sample Entropy (SampEn) of raw and surrogate data were determined. Surrogate data for MI and SampEn were computed as previously described (\nChung et al., 2013\n;\nDhingra et al., 2011\n). Schematic diagrams describing the acquisition of data for both MI and SampEn are shown in (\nDhingra et al., 2011\n). MI is an expression of the degree to which knowledge of a specific point in a data set x(t) reduces the uncertainty associated with a time advanced coordinate x(t + \u03c4), where \u03c4 > 0 is the time interval between samples (determined by sampling frequency). It is assessed for each time lag (\u03c4) from unity to one respiratory cycle length. In essentials, MI provides a measure of the statistical dependence between points in the data set and includes both linear and nonlinear correlations (\nFraser, 1986\n;\nShannon, 1997\n). A decrease in value represents reduced complexity and greater variance in a respiratory waveform.\nSampEn is calculated through the creation of templates for each point (template = m points and m + 1 points separated by \u03c4). A match is a point within a tolerance interval r. SampEn defines the negative natural logarithm of the conditional probability that a specific epoch will have the same number of matches for m and m + 1 number of points. We performed the assessment with m = 2 and\nr\n= 0.2 * SD. It is assessed for \u03c4 from unity to one cycle length with resulting values averaged. Values with high linear correlations were excluded (defined by the first minimum of the mutual information function). As such, SampEn measures temporal pattern variability, indicative of self-similarity within a given time frame. High values convey reduced self-similarity and predictability with greater complexity (\nRichman and Moorman, 2000\n). The nonlinear complexity index (NLCI) was calculated as the average of the statistically significant differences between the original and surrogate SampEn data sets at each \u03c4. The higher the value of the NLCI, the greater the contribution of nonlinear and/or non-Gaussian sources of variability within the data set.\nAll experiments were assessed blind. A minimum of 3 repeats were conducted for each experiment. The parameters were compared between control and the test groups by repeated measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; SPSS). Significance values represented as * =\np\n< 0.05, ** =\np\n< 0.01, *** =\np\n< 0.001. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM."

Mice tissues were fixed via intracardial perfusion with Zamboni\u2019s fixative (4% paraformaldehyde and 15% picric acid) prior to dissection. Tissue sections were cut using a Leica CM 1950 cryostat and placed on slides in serial sections. Sections were then covered with PBS and cover slipped. Images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope. Exposure times were kept constant between experimental groups. (\nSupplemental Figure S1\n).\nMice with loxp sites flanking exon 4 of the insulin receptor gene (IR\nlox/lox\n) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME).

Primers used for genotyping Advillin\nCre/+\nwere:\np1: 5\u2032-CCCTGTTCACTGTGAGTAGG-3\u2032,\np2: 5\u2032-AGTATCTGGTAGGTGCTTCCAG-3\u2032,\np3: 5\u2032-GCGATCCCTGAACATGTCCATC-3\u2032.\nA wildtype allele produced a 500bp fragment and a cre-expressing allele produced a 180bp fragment. Primers used for genotyping IR\nlox/lox\nwere:\np1: 5\u2032-GATGTGCACCCCATGTCTG-3\u2032,\np2: 5\u2032-CTGAATAGCTGAGACCACAG-3\u2032.\nA wildtype allele produced a 279bp fragment and an allele with loxp insertion produced a 313bp fragment. All primers were added to a supermix to genotype SNIRKO mice and the PCR product was amplified for 35 cycles (94\u00b0C for 15 sec, 62\u00b0C for 15 sec, 72\u00b0C for 90 sec) in a 40\u03bcL reaction (\nSupplemental Figure S2\n). IR\nlox/lox\nwere used as controls for all experiments. All experiments were approved by the University of Kansas Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nInsulin Receptor Quantification\nRT-PCR\nTotal RNA was isolated from control and SNIRKO DRG to assess Cre/loxP recombination as described previously (\nGuerra et al., 2001\n). A reverse primer specific for exon 6 of the insulin receptor was used for reverse transcription: 5\u2032-GTGATGGTGAGGTTGTGTTTGCTC-3\u2032. The reaction was carried out using an iScript select kit (Bio-Rad) at 42 degrees for 30 min, followed by 85 degrees for 5 min. The generated cDNA was then used for PCR template. Primers to exon 3, 5\u2032-GCTGCACAGCTGAAGGCCTGT-3\u2032, and exon 5, 5\u2032-CTCCTCGAATCAGATGTAGCT-3\u2032 were used to amplify the region corresponding to exon 4. PCR conditions were 94\u00b0 for 30 secs followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0 for 30 secs, 58\u00b0 for 30 secs, 72 \u00b0for 1 min and a final extension at 72\u00b0 for 7 min. A 585bp fragment indicates an intact insulin receptor and a 435bp fragment indicates cre/loxp recombination and deletion of the 150bp exon 4.\nWestern blots\nInsulin receptor protein expression was quantified in gastrocnemius muscle and DRG using Western blot analysis. Samples were homogenized in Cell Extraction Buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 55.55 \u03bcl/ml protease inhibitor cocktail, 200mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, and 200mM NaF. Protein concentration of the supernatant was measured with a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Samples were boiled with Lane Marker Reducing Sample Buffer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 3 minutes. Thirty \u03bcg of protein was loaded per lane and samples were separated on a 4\u201315% gradient tris-glycine gel (Bio-Rad). After gel electrophoresis, samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked in 5% milk. Following incubation with primary (insulin receptor \u03b2 subunit (Santa Cruz), actin (Millipore) and secondary antibodies, bands were visualized with film and analyzed with ImageJ (NIH).\nAkt activation was assessed using western blots in muscle and DRG following an intraperitoneal injection of insulin at 10.0 U/Kg or vehicle control as previously described (\nGrote et al., 2013b\n). Mice were fasted 3 hours prior to insulin injection. Thirty minutes after insulin stimulation mice were sacrificed and tissues were harvested. Western samples were then prepared and blots were probed with total Akt and p-(Ser473)Akt (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA).\n\nMetabolic Parameters\nMetabolic parameters were monitored throughout the course of SNIRKO development and testing. Mice weights were recorded at 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 16, 22, and 28 weeks of age.\nGlucose and Hemoglobin A1C\nBlood glucose levels were determined using a glucose diagnostic assay (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Mice were fasted 3 hours prior to glucose measurement and blood was collected via tail snip at 6, 10, 16, 22, and 29 weeks of age. In addition, long term glucose levels were assessed by determining hemoglobin A1C levels immediately prior to sacrifice at 29 weeks of age using A1CNow+ Meter (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany).\nInsulin and IGF-1\nAfter a 3-hour fast, whole blood was collected via tail snip and allowed to clot on ice for 30 minutes. Samples were then centrifuged at 3000g for 15 minutes. The resultant serum supernatant was used for analysis. Serum insulin and IGF-1 levels were measured with ELISAs from ALPCO (Salem, NH). Serum insulin levels were measured alongside glucose at 6, 10, 16, 22, and 29 weeks of age and IGF-1 levels were determined at sacrifice.\nIntraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (IPGTT)\nAt 28 weeks of age, both IR\nlox/lox\nand SNIRKO glucose tolerance was analyzed with an IPGTT. After a 6-hour fast, mice were administered a glucose bolus of 2g/kg body weight via IP injection. Blood glucose measurements were taken immediately prior to glucose stimulation and at 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes thereafter.\n\nSensorimotor Behavior and Neuron Analysis\nThermal sensitivity\nMice were acclimated to the behavior facility and equipment for a minimum of 2 days. On test days, mice were acclimated to the behavior facility for 30 minutes and subsequently to the Hargreaves table for 30 minutes prior to data collection. The table surface was maintained at 30\u00b0C and mice were housed in individual clear plastic cages. A 4.0V radiant heat source was applied to the mid plantar surface of the hind paw, and time to withdrawal was measured (\nHargreaves et al., 1988\n). Four trials were recorded for each hind paw, alternating paws between trials. Data was presented as the average latency to withdrawal across both paws.\nMechanical sensitivity\nMice were acclimated to the mesh grid in clear individual plastic cages. The up-down method was used to test paw mechanical sensitivity (\nDixon, 1980\n). A set von Frey monofilaments (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) capable of exerting forces of 0.0045, 0.02, 0.068, 0.158, 0.178, 1.2, 2.041, and 5.5 g were applied to the right hind paw of each mouse. The duration of each stimulus was approximately 1 sec and the inter-stimulus interval was approximately 30\u201360 secs. The 50% threshold was calculated for each mouse (\nChaplan et al., 1994\n).\nBeamwalk\nTwo days before testing, mice were acclimated to the behavior facility and trained to traverse a wooden beam with a length 1.0\u2009m and a diameter of 1.2 cm (\nGuilford et al., 2011\n). On test day, mice were recorded with a digital video camera as they walked across the beam. Each mouse had 3 trials per testing period. Videos were analyzed and the number of times the left or right hind paw slipped of the beam was counted as a foot slip and foot slips were averaged across all 3 trials.\nRotorod\nMice were placed on a rotating rod to test motor coordination and balance (\nLalonde et al., 1995\n). The speed of rotation was increased from 4.0 to 40 rpm over a 5-minute period and the latency to fall was recorded. If a mouse did not fall throughout the testing period, the rod was stopped and latency was recorded as 5 minutes. Mice were acclimated for one 5-minute period before being tested in 3 separate trials with 5 minutes between trials. The average latency to fall across all 3 trials is reported.\nNerve Conduction Velocity\nNerve conduction velocity was conducted as previously described (\nJack et al., 2012\n). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 200 mg/kg Avertin (1.25% v/v tribromoethanol, 2.5% tert-amyl alcohol, dH\n2\nO). Mouse body temperature was monitored with rectal probe and maintained at 37\u00b0C via feed-back controlled heating pad. Motor nerve conduction velocities (MNCV) were obtained by measuring compound muscle action potentials using 9.9 mA stimulation at the ankle distally and at the sciatic notch proximally. MNCV were reported as the average of 3 independent recordings. Sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) was measured behind the medial malleolus with a 2.4 mA stimulation of the second toe digital nerve. SNCV was reported as the average of 10 recordings.\nIntraepidermal Nerve Fiber Density (IENFD)\nAt sacrifice, the skin of the hind paw footpad was removed from IR\nlox/lox\nand SNIRKO mice and fixed in Zamboni\u2019s fixative for 1 hour. Hind paw footpad skin was cut in sagittal sections with a Leica CM 1950 cryostat and placed on slides in serial sections. Slides were blocked at room temperature for 1 hour with pre-incubation solution (1.5% Normal Goat or Donkey Serum, 0.5% Porcine Gelatin, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 450 \u03bcL Superblock (Thermo Scientific)). Primary antibody to PGP 9.5 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa-488 conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) were then used to label and visualize epidermal nerve fibers. Images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope. Fibers that crossed the dermal-epidermal border were counted in 3 regions per section and in 3 sections per mouse. The length of the epidermal region was measured with NIH Image J software and the IENFD was expressed as number of fibers/millimeter of epidermis.\n\nPancreas Morphology\nTissue Preparation\nPancreata were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissue was embedded in paraffin using an automated vacuum tissue processor Leica ASP300S (Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn, IL). Tissue sections of 8 \u03bcm thickness were cut on a RM2255microtome (Leica Microsystems Inc.) and mounted directly on Superfrost/Plus microscope slides (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA, #12-550-12). Slides were dried at +40\u00b0C overnight in and stored at +4\u00b0C.\nParaffin embedded sections were deparaffinized/rehydrated in xylene followed by ethanol and PBS serial rehydration. Antigen retrieval was completed in a steamer using 0.01M citrate buffer, pH 6.2, with 0.002M EDTA, for 30 min. Slides were permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. Sections were blocked in 10% normal donkey serum (NDS), 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.03% Triton X-100.\nImmunofluorescence (IF)\nBlocked sections were incubated with the primary antibody mix at +4\u00b0C overnight and with secondary antibody for 2 hours at room temperature. DAPI (4\u20326-diamindino-2-phenylindole; 0.5 \u03bcg/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, # D1306) staining was performed for 5 min at room temperature following the first wash after secondary antibody exposure. After incubation with secondary antibodies, slides were mounted with anti-fading agent Gel/Mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA).\nThe following primary antibodies were used to stain the pancreas: anti-insulin (1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, # ab7842), anti-glucagon (1:300, Abcam, # ab10988), anti-somatostatin (1:300, Abcam, # ab53165). Secondary antibodies were conjugated with DyLight 488 (1:400, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA, # 706-485-148), Alexa 555 (1:400, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, #\nA31570\n), or Alexa 647 (1:400, Molecular Probes, #\nA31573\n).\nImages were captured on a Nikon C1Si or C1 Plus confocal microscopes (Nikon Instruments Inc, Melville, NY). Images were analyzed using Nikon software EZ-C1 3.90 Free Viewer. The cellular composition of islets was measured by counting the individual types of cells (\u03b2-cells labeled with anti-insulin, \u03b1-cells with anti-glucagon and \u03b4-cells with anti-somatostatin) in each islet and dividing the number of each cell type by the total number of all labeled cells per islet.\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC)\nAnti-insulin (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, # sc-9168) or anti-glucagon (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, # sc-13091) primary antibodies were used. Staining was developed using Histostain-\nPlus\nBroad Spectrum (AEC) Kit (Invitrogen, Frederick, MD, # 859943). The IHC procedure was conducted per manufacturer instructions and slides were counterstained with hematoxylin.\nAfter staining, slides were rinsed in deionized water and placed on coverslips in Clear Mount mounting medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, #17985-12). The staining was observed using a Nikon Eclipse 80i light microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc, Melville, NY.). Images were analyzed using Adobe Photoshop CZ4 extended software. The relative insulin content was measured based on the intensity of staining of pancreatic sections with anti-insulin. The average pixel value of staining per cell or per islet was determined and background staining was subtracted from each sample.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data is reported as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean. Male and female mice were included in analysis, as the pattern of differences between IR\nlox/lox\nand SNIRKO mice was consistent across both sexes. Graphpad Prism software was used for all statistical analysis and a\nP\n-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nPathogen-free adult male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 6 rats/group for each experiment; 10\u201312 wks old on arrival; Envigo Labs, Indianapolis, IN) were used in all experiments. Rats were housed in temperature-controlled (23 \u00b1 3\u00b0C) and light-controlled (12 h light:dark cycle; lights on at 07:00 h) rooms with standard rodent chow and water available\nad libitum\n. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\nDREADDs and drugs\npAAV-CD68-hM4Di-mCherry, pAAV-CD68-hM3Dq-mCherry, pAAV-CD68-EGFP (control), pLenti6.3-CMV hM4Di, and pLenti6.3-CMV hM3Dq plasmids were generated as previously described (\nGrace et al., 2016a\n) (gifted by D.J. Urban and B.L. Roth). pAAV plasmids were packaged in serotype 9 by the UNC Vector Core Facility. Clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) was obtained commercially, while IL-1ra was gifted by Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA). Vehicles were DMSO (1.5% vol/vol) for CNO and sterile saline for IL-1ra.\n\nChronic constriction injury (CCI) surgery\nNeuropathic pain was induced using the CCI model of sciatic nerve injury (\nBennett and Xie, 1988\n). Surgery was performed at the mid-thigh level of the left hindleg as previously described (\nGrace et al., 2010\n). In brief, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane. The shaved skin was treated with Nolvasan and the surgery was performed aseptically. Four sterile chromic gut sutures (cuticular 4-0 WebGut, Patterson Veterinary, Devens, MA) were loosely tied around the gently isolated sciatic nerve. Animals were monitored post-operatively until fully ambulatory, prior to return to their home cage.\n\nMechanical allodynia\nAll testing was conducted blind with respect to group assignment. Rats received at least three 60-minute habituations to the test environment prior to behavioral testing. The von Frey test (\nChaplan et al., 1994\n) was performed as previously described (\nGrace et al., 2010\n). A logarithmic series of 10 calibrated Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments (von Frey hairs; Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) were applied randomly to the left versus right hind paws to define the threshold stimulus intensity required to elicit a paw withdrawal response. Log stiffness of the hairs ranged from manufacturer-designated 3.61 (0.40 g) to 5.18 (15.14 g) filaments. The behavioral responses were used to calculate absolute threshold (the 50% probability of response) by fitting a Gaussian integral psychometric function using a maximum-likelihood fitting method (\nHarvey, 1986\n;\nTreutwein and Strasburger, 1999\n).\n\nAcute and chronic catheter implantation\nThe method of construction and implantation of the acute and indwelling intrathecal catheters was based on that described previously (\nMilligan et al., 1999\n). In brief, intrathecal operations were conducted under isoflurane anesthesia by threading sterile polyethylene-10 tubing (PE-10 Intramedic Tubing; Becton Dickinson Primary Care Diagnostics, Sparks, MD, USA) guided by an 18-gauge needle between the L5 and L6 vertebrae. The catheter was inserted such that the proximal catheter tip lay over the lumbosacral enlargement. For acute intrathecal drug delivery, catheters were removed immediately following drug delivery. For indwelling catheters, the needle was removed and the catheter was sutured to the superficial musculature of the lower back. The catheters were 17 cm in length, and were attached to a pre-loaded osmotic minipump where appropriate (Alzet, 2001, Cupertino, CA).\n\nIntrathecal and intraperitoneal drug administration\nFor acute intrathecal drug delivery, the catheters were pre-loaded with drugs at the distal end in a total volume and delivered over 20\u201330 s once the catheter was in position. Acute intrathecal doses were as follows, DREADDs: 1.2 \u00d7 10\n13\nvg in 8 \u03bcl (injected 4 weeks prior to CNO treatment); CNO 60 \u03bcg in 10 \u03bcl; IL-1ra: 100 \u03bcg in 10 \u03bcl. For repeated CNO treatment, 60 \u03bcg in 10 \u03bcl was delivered daily for 3 days. Intraperitoneal CNO was administered at 1 mg/kg. We have previously validated microglial expression of DREADDs when transfected via an AAV9 vector (\nGrace et al., 2016a\n).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAfter 3 days of CNO treatment, rats were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde/0.1 M phosphate buffer. Spinal cords were dissected and postfixed for 24 h in 4% paraformaldehyde/0.1 M phosphate buffer, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose with 0.1% azide at 4\u00b0C until slicing. Lumbar spinal cords were freeze-mounted in OCT, and cut at 20 \u03bcm frozen sections. Sections were permeabilized with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide, blocked for 1 h with 10% NGS, 0.3% Triton-X in PBS, and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C for 24 h in 2 % normal goat serum together with mouse anti-rat CD11b (1:1000; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Slides were then washed, incubated in the secondary antibody at 1:200 (Goat anti mouse biotin, Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA) for 2 h. Sections were once again washed, incubated in ABC solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 2 h, washed, and incubated in inactive DAB (Sigma) for 10 min. DAB was then activated with B\u2013D glucose (10mg/ml) and slides were incubated for 8 min, washed, and dried overnight. Slides were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of EtOH (50, 70, 95 and 100%), cleared in Citrisolv, dried and covered with DPX mountant (Sigma).\nImages were acquired using an Olympus BX61 microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA) with Suite Cell Sens Dimension software (Olympus). All images were taken using the same exposure and settings, and captured at 20x magnification. Images were converted to 32 bit, corrected for threshold, and densitometry was conducted using NIH Image J software, while blinded to treatment conditions. Four images per animal were taken with 3 selections within each image analyzed, resulting in 12 areas of analysis per animal. Data are expressed as total area positive for staining within the selected area.\n\nBV-2 transfection, cell culture, and treatments\nMouse microglia BV-2 cells were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 \u00d7 10\n4\ncells/ml in 35 mm dish. When cells reached ~60% confluence, the medium was aspirated and 0.5 ml of pLenti6.3-CMV hM3Dq or pLenti6.3-CMV hM4Di lenti-virus medium (multiplicity of infection=10\n4\n) and 8 \u03bcg/ml polybrene were added for transfection. After 24 h transfection, the virus was removed and the cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS for additional 24 h. The pLenti6.3-CMV hM3Dq or pLenti6.3-CMV hM4Di positive cells were then selected by DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 \u03bcg/ml puromycin. Positive colonies were picked up and were further cultured. The pLenti6.3-CMV hM3Dq and pLenti6.3-CMV hM4Di positive cells were further confirmed by V5 tag western blotting.\npLenti6.3-CMV hM3Dq or pLenti6.3-CMV hM4Di positive cells were seeded into 96 well plates at a density of 5 \u00d7 10\n4\ncells/ml in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS. After 24 h, all cells were washed. pLenti6.3-CMV hM3Dq cells were incubated with a concentration range of CNO (0, 50, 100 \u03bcM) in serum-free DMEM medium for 24 h. The CNO concentrations used did not adversely affect cell viability (\nFig. S1\n). pLenti6.3-CMV hM4Di cells were incubated with a concentration range of LPS (0, 20, 200, 2000 \u03bcg/ml) or CCL2 (0, 50, 100 \u03bcg/ml), together with 0 or 50 \u03bcM of CNO in serum-free DMEM medium for 4 or 24 h. Non-transfected were treated with a concentration range of CNO (0\u2013400 \u03bcM), together with a LPS (0 or 200 ng/ml) in serum-free DMEM medium for 24 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation for RT-PCR, whereas supernatants were collected for NO and cytokine analysis.\n\nRT-PCR\nTotal RNA was isolated using a standard method of phenol:chloroform extraction (\nChomczynski and Sacchi, 1987\n). cDNA amplification was performed using Quantitect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) in iCycler iQ 96-well PCR plates (Bio-Rad) on a MyiQ single Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences (GenBank, National Center for Biotechnology Information;\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n) are as follows,\nGapdh\n: F: GGAGAAACCTGCCAAGTATG, R: GTCATTGAGAGCAATGCCAG;\nNos2\n: F: GGAGTGACGGCAAACATGACT, R: TCGATGCACAACTGGGTGAAC;\nIl1b\n: F: TGCTGTCGGACCCATATGAG, R: ATCCACACTCTCCAGCTGCA. Each sample was measured in duplicate by using the MyiQ single Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Threshold for detection of PCR product was set in the log-linear phase of amplification and the threshold cycle (CT) was determined for each reaction. The level of the target mRNA was quantified relative to the housekeeping gene (GAPDH) using the \u0394\u0394CT method (\nLivak and Schmittgen, 2001\n). GAPDH was not significantly different between treatments.\n\nNO assay\nThe NO (nitrite) concentration in the culture supernatant was determined by the 2,3-diaminonaphthalene-based fluorescent method (\nMisko et al., 1993\n). The plate was read on a Beckman Coulter DTX880 reader (\u03bb\nex\n365 nm, \u03bb\nem\n430 nm).\n\nELISA\nA total of 50 \u03bcl of cell culture supernatants were used for the assays. Cytokine levels were determined using commercially available rat TNF, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 ELISA kits (R&D Systems). The assays were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Bradford protein assays were also performed to determine total protein concentrations in sonication samples. The analyte concentrations are presented as nanograms per mg of total protein.\n\nCell viability assay\nCrystal violet staining was used to determine cell viability as described previously (\nSelfridge et al., 2015\n;\nWang et al., 2013\n). Twenty-four hours after treatment, cells were fixed by 3.7% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 5 min and then stained by 0.05% crystal violet for 30 min. The plates were subsequently washed 2 times with tap water and dried for 30 min at room temperature. 200 \u03bcL of ethanol was added to each well, and the plates were shaken for 15 min at room temperature to dissolve the dye. Absorbance at 540 nm was measured with a Beckman Coulter DTX880 reader (Fullerton, CA, USA)\n\nStatistics\nData from the von Frey test were analyzed as the interpolated 50% thresholds (absolute threshold) in log\n10\nof stimulus intensity (monofilament stiffness in milligrams \u00d7 10). Baseline values were compared between groups using a one-way ANOVA. Differences between treatment groups were determined using repeated measures 2-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey or Sidak\npost hoc\ntests where appropriate. Differences in cytokine levels were determined using 1-way ANOVA or 2-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett\u2019s or Sidak\npost hoc\ntests, where appropriate. Differences in gene expression were determined using 2-way ANOVA and Sidak\npost hoc\ntests, while differences in densitometry were determined using 1-way ANOVA and Tukey\npost hoc\ntests. Statistical comparisons are indicated on the figures for clarity and \u00b1 standard error of the mean. Statistical significance was set at\nP\n< 0.05."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nEight adult male rhesus monkeys (\nMacaca mulatta\n), ranging in age from 8.5 to 12.1 years, were used in this study. All were part of our previous study (\nMoore et al., 2013\n) that assessed the efficacy of hUTC therapy on recovery of motor function following cortical injury. Prior to entering the previous study, all monkeys received medical examinations and were screened to ensure that they did not have a history of malnutrition, diabetes, chronic illness, or any neurological diseases. All monkeys were given initial pre -operative MRI scans to ensure no occult brain abnormality. While enrolled in the study, the monkeys were housed in the Laboratory Animal Science Center of Boston University Medical Campus, which is accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). Experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the National Institute of Health\u2019s Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Boston University Medical Campus.\n\nFine Motor Testing and Lesion of the M1 Hand Area\nAll motor testing and surgical procedures were completed as part of the previous study (\nMoore et al., 2013\n) and have been previously described (\nMoore et al., 2010\n,\n2013\n,\n2012\n). In the following, the testing and surgical procedures are described briefly. Monkeys were trained on a fine motor task, modified version of a Kl\u00fcver board (\nKl\u00fcver, 1935\n), to reach asymptotic performance and the preferred or dominant hand was determined using free choice trials in the testing apparatus. The lesion was then targeted to the hemisphere controlling the dominant hand to ensure that monkeys would be motivated to use the impaired hand during postoperative testing. All subjects then underwent an electrophysiologically guided lesion limited to the hand representation of primary motor cortex. Following exposure of the cortex, the lesion was created by inserting a small glass suction pipette under the pia and bluntly dissecting the small penetrating arterioles as they enter the underlying cortex, producing an ischemic lesion of the gray matter with preservation of underlying white matter (\nMoore et al., 2013\n). Twenty-four hours after the lesion, monkeys were given hUTC (CNTO 0007; Advanced Technologies and Regenerative Medicine, LLC \u2013 Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ) or placebo via intravenous infusion at a dose of 10 million cells/kg and a rate of 0.5 mL per minute. Two weeks following surgery, monkeys were retested on the same fine motor task for 12 weeks with 70% of trials to the impaired hand and 30% to the unimpaired hand. Outcome measures included recovery time, the number of days to return to pre-operative performance, and grasp assessment, determined by a licensed Occupational Therapist (M.A.P.) using our Grasp Assessment Scale for non-human primates (NHP). The scale was adapted from scales used in human stroke patients (\nCarr et al., 1985\n;\nFugl-Meyer et al., 1975\n;\nWhishaw et al., 2002\n) and consists of hierarchical categories from 0 (no movement) to 8 (normal grasp with accurate pinch between thumb and finger). All relevant subject information, including treatment and behavioral outcome measures, is summarized in\nTable 1\n. For all procedures, cognitive testers, surgeons and other research staff were blind to treatment condition throughout the experiment including tissue processing and data analysis reported here.\nTable 1.\nSubject Data\nSubject\nSex\nAge (years)\nTreatment Group\nLesion Hemisphere\nBrdU Survival Time (days)\nRecovery Time (days)\n*\nMean Grasp Assessment\n*\nSupplier\nSM014j\nM\n8.5\nPlacebo\nL\n110\n54\n7.68\nCPRC\nSM018j\nM\n9.6\nPlacebo\nL\n92\n96\n6.46\nCPRC\nSM020j\nM\n9.3\nPlacebo\nR\n106\n96\n6.58\nCPRC\nSM022j\nM\n10.6\nPlacebo\nR\n138\n96\n6.46\nCPRC\nSM016j\nM\n10.1\nhUTC Treated\nL\n116\n56\n7.88\nCPRC\nSM017j\nM\n8.6\nhUTC Treated\nL\n99\n35\n7.72\nCPRC\nSM021j\nM\n11.5\nhUTC Treated\nR\n111\n51\n7.80\nCPRC\nSM024j\nM\n12.1\nhUTC Treated\nL\nn/a\n48\n7.86\nYNPRC\nOpen in a new tab\nAbbreviations:\nhUTC\n, human umbilical tissue derived cells (CNTO0007, Advanced Technologies and Regenerative Medicine, LLC, New Brunswick, NJ).\nCPRC\n, Caribbean Primate Research Center, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR.\nYNPRC\n, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.\nBrdU\n, Bromodeoxyuridine.\n*\nPreviously published data in\nMoore et al., 2013\n(used in correlation studies in the current study)\n\nBrdU Administration\nSeven (3 treated and 4 placebo) monkeys received a single intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), prepared in a 15 mg/mL solution of warm, sterile Tris-buffered saline at pH 7.4. The BrdU solution was injected exactly eight days after surgically induced cortical injury to label cells in S-phase at that time. Since the BrdU dilutes in cells that remain in the cell cycle through many rounds of replication, the number of days between the BrdU injection and perfusion is listed as BrdU survival time in\nTable 1\n. BrdU survival time ranged from 92 to 138 days.\n\nPre-perfusion Testing and Immediate Early Gene Activation\nThree hours prior to perfusion-fixation of the brain, monkeys were tested on the fine motor task for one hour. For this last testing session 100% of the trials were given to the impaired hand to maximize activation of neurons participating in function of the impaired hand. We hypothesized that testing only the impaired hand would activate the neurons supporting the recovery of function that may have occurred. After the testing session, the monkey was returned to the home cage for 2 hours to allow for expression of c-Fos protein resulting from neuronal activation before perfusion-fixation of the brain.\n\nPerfusion and Tissue Acquisition\nAt the conclusion of the experiment, monkeys were sedated with ketamine (10 mg/kg IM) deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (25 mg/kg IV to effect) and were euthanized by exsanguination during transcardial perfusion-fixation of the brain. Perfusion with cold Krebs-Heinsleit buffer (4\u00b0C, pH 7.4) was followed immediately by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, (30\u00b0C, pH 7.4). The brain was blocked, in situ, in the coronal plane to ensure reproducible planes of section during later processing and then removed from the skull, weighed, and post-fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (no more than 18 hours). It was then transferred to cryoprotectant solution to eliminate freezing artifact (\nRosene et al., 1986\n). Cryoprotected blocks were flash frozen at \u221275\u00b0C and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until they were cut on a microtome into interrupted series of coronal sections (eight series of 30 \u03bcm thick sections and one series of 60 \u03bcm thick sections) with a spacing between sections within a series of 300 \u03bcm. The 60 \u03bcm series was immediately mounted on microscope slides and stained with thionin for lesion reconstruction. The other series were collected in phosphate buffer with 15% glycerol and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for later histochemical processing (\nEstrada et al., 2017\n).\n\nc-Fos and Synaptophysin Immunohistochemistry\nQuarter series of 30 \u03bcm sections (i.e. sections spaced 1200 \u03bcm apart) through the premotor cortices were removed from storage and thawed for c-Fos and synaptophysin immunohistochemistry. All the sections for each marker were batch-processed (see\nEstrada et al, 2017\nfor discussion of batch processing) in the same reagents at the same time, according to the following steps. First, sections were rinsed in 0.05M Tris-buffered saline (TBS) to remove the glycerol. To quench endogenous peroxidases, sections were incubated for 30 minutes in TBS containing 1% sodium borohydride (c-Fos) or 3% H\n2\nO\n2\n(synaptophysin) followed by washes in TBS. Sections were then incubated for 1 hour in a blocking solution of 10% Normal Goat Serum (NGS) and 0.4% Triton-X in TBS. The sections were then incubated for 48 hours at 4\u00b0C with gentle agitation in monoclonal primary antibodies to c-Fos (anti-c-Fos IgG in rabbit, 1:10000; Calbiochem, Billerica, MA) and synaptophysin (anti-synaptophysin IgG in mouse, 1:100000, Millipore, Billerica, MA) in a solution containing 2% NGS and 0.1% Triton-X in TBS. Several sections of brain tissue were left out of the primary antibody to control for immunoreactivity. Following incubation with the primary antibody, the sections were washed in a solution containing 2% NGS and 0.1% Triton-X in TBS, followed by a 2-hour incubation in biotinylated secondary antibody (1:600; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in TBS containing 2% NGS, and 0.4% Triton-X. The sections were then washed in TBS and subsequently incubated with an avidin biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (ABC Elite; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 hour. The sections were then washed in TBS followed by washes in 0.175M sodium acetate solution. For visualization, all sections were incubated together in sodium acetate containing 0.55 mM 3-3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), nickel sulfate (0.095M), and 0.0025% H\n2\nO\n2\n. The sections were then washed in sodium acetate to stop the DAB reaction, followed by rinses in TBS. Finally, sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, air dried, and cover-slipped using Permount mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).\n\nBrdU Immunohistochemistry\nA half series of 30 \u03bcm sections (i.e. sections spaced 600 \u03bcm apart) containing lateral ventricle and hippocampus was removed from storage and thawed for immunohistochemistry. All sections were batch-processed in the same reagents for BrdU according to the following steps. First, sections were washed in 0.05M Potassium Phosphate-Buffered Saline (KPBS) to remove the glycerol. For antigen retrieval, sections were incubated at 65\u00b0C for 2 hours in 50% formamide in 2\u00d7 saline sodium citrate (SSC), followed by washes in SSC. Sections were then incubated in 2N Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C to create single-stranded DNA and expose the incorporated BrdU, then rinsed in a 0.1M Borate buffer (pH 8.5) for 10 minutes to neutralize the HCl. Sections were washed in KPBS and placed in SuperBlock (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 30 minutes. Then, sections were incubated in the monoclonal primary antibody to BrdU (anti-BrdU IgG in rat; 1:500; Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corporation, Westbury, NY) in KPBS containing 0.4% Triton-X for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by 48 hours at 4\u00b0C with gentle agitation. Several sections of brain tissue were left out of the primary antibody to control for immunoreactivity. Next, the sections were washed in KPBS, then incubated in biotinylated secondary antibody (1:600, goat-anti-rat; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in a solution containing 0.4% Triton-X in KPBS buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. The sections were washed in KPBS, incubated in an avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC Elite; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 hour, then rinsed in KPBS. For visualization, all sections were incubated simultaneously for 8 minutes in KPBS containing DAB and 0.0025% H\n2\nO\n2\n, followed by washes in KPBS. Free floating sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides and air dried. Sections were then lightly counterstained with a 0.05% thionin solution (pH 5.5), dehydrated through a graded series of alcohols, cleared with xylene, and coverslipped using Permount mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).\n\nRegions of Interest for Stereology\nUnbiased stereology was used to quantify c-Fos labeled neurons, synaptophysin puncta, and BrdU labeled cells visualized on a Nikon Eclipse E600 series light microscope (Nikon; Melville, NY, USA) equipped with a motorized stage integrated with StereoInvestigator 9 software (MicroBrightField Bioscience; Williston, VT). All sections were blinded and then regions of interest (ROI) were outlined using the 4X objective. For c-Fos and synaptophysin stereology, ROIs were created for the ipsilesional and contralesional dorsal premotor cortex (iPMd and cPMd) and the ipsilesional and contralesional ventral premotor cortex (iPMv and cPMv) on 6-10 equally spaced sections. ROIs were outlined as shown in\nFigure 1\nusing the Paxinos rhesus monkey stereotaxic atlas as a guide (\nPaxinos et al., 2008\n). Specifically, PMd was sampled from its first appearance near the rostral aspect of the superior limb of the arcuate sulcus, past the region of the arcuate sulcus to its disappearance at the rostral aspect of M1. PMv was sampled from its first appearance near the inferior arcuate sulcus to its disappearance at the rostral aspect of M1.\nFigure 1. Regions of interest for stereological estimation of c-Fos and synaptophysin.\nOpen in a new tab\nThe entire extent of dorsal and ventral premotor cortices were evaluated. Schematic representations of rhesus monkey coronal sections adapted from\nPaxinos (2008)\nare shown from rostral to caudal (\nA\u2013H\n) showing the boundaries of the dorsal and ventral premotor area regions of interest that were sampled for stereological analysis. The sagittal view (\nI\n) shows the rostral and caudal boundaries from which the sections sampled were taken.\nAbbreviations: sar, superior arcuate sulcus. ps, principle sulcus. arsp, arcuate sulcus spur.\nFor BrdU analysis, ROIs were created for the ipsilesional and contralesional subventricular zone (iSVZ and cSVZ) on 7-8 equally spaced sections from the interventricular foramen to the rostral tip of the lateral ventricle. ROIs were also created on the ipsilesional and contralesional subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (iSGZ and cSGZ) on 16-25 equally spaced sections through the hippocampus. The SVZ included an area extending 2500 \u03bcm dorsal to the most ventral tip of the ventricle and 250 \u03bcm distal from the ependymal layer bordering the lumen of the ventricle. Representative sections and ROI contours for SVZ are shown in\nFigure 2 (A\u2013H)\n. The SGZ, a subdivision of the dentate gyrus, was sampled through its rostral-caudal extent as shown in representative sections and contours in\nFigure 2 (I\u2013P)\nand as previously described (\nNgwenya et al., 2015\n). The hilus was identified as the polymorphic cell area within the blades of the granule cell layer. The SGZ was defined as the area within the hilus immediately beneath the granule cell layer but excluding the cell dense CA4 subfield that often extended into the hilus. BrdU positive cells were counted in the SGZ and adjacent deep layer of the granule cells.\nFigure 2. Regions of interest for stereological estimation of BrdU.\nOpen in a new tab\nThe subventricular zone and granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus were evaluated. The boundaries of the subventricular zone ROI that was sampled for stereological analysis are shown as representative micrographs (\nA, C, E, G\n) and schematic illustrations (\nB, D, F, H\n). The boundaries of the dentate gyrus, including the granule cell layer that was sampled for stereological analysis, are shown as representative micrographs (\nI, K, M, O\n) and schematic illustrations (\nJ, L, N, P\n).\nAbbreviations: L, Lateral Ventricle. SVZ, Subventricular Zone. ECL, Ependymal Cell Layer. SGZ, Subgranular Zone. ML, molecular layer. H, Hilus.\n\nStereological Parameters and Inclusion Criteria\nThe Optical Fractionator Workflow was used to optimize and quantify all 3 markers and stereological parameters are summarized in\nTable 2\n. The Optical Fractionator Workflow places a sampling grid over the ROI using systematic random sampling. It then places a three-dimensional counting frame at a fixed corner of each grid square. Counting occurred within that 3-D frame. To ensure stereological accuracy, counting was performed with a minimum of 2 \u03bcm guard zones above and below the optical dissector box to ensure that lost caps could be identified and counted or excluded according to the respective face (\nWest et al., 1991\n). c-Fos labeled cells were identified with the 40X objective based on intense nuclear staining which ranged from dense labeling of the entire nucleus to labeling of 40% of the nucleus compared to background. Labeling below 40% was regarded as background and not a positive cell. Inclusion criteria for Synaptophysin positive puncta were identified with the 100X objective as well-defined circular, dark profiles located within the counting frame. Since BrdU-positive cells are relatively rare, an exhaustive counting scheme was used such that the counting frame occupied 100% of the sampling grid (\nTable 2\n). BrdU positive cells were identified with the 60X objective and counted if more than one-third of the nucleus was darkly labeled and if the labeled nucleus was not part of the wall of a blood vessel. This counting method omitted very lightly stained cells and endothelial cells.\nTable 2.\nStereological Parameters for Optical Fractionator.\nRegions of interest\nStereology Objective\nSection Interval\nCounting Frame (\u03bcm)\nGrid Spacing (\u03bcm)\nDissector Height (\u03bcm)\nGuard Zone (\u03bcm) Above\nc-Fos\nDorsal Premotor Cortex\n40X\n1/40\n250 \u00d7 250\n1200 \u00d7 1200\n15\n2\nVentral Premotor Cortex\n950 \u00d7 950\nSynaptophysin\nDorsal Premotor Cortex\nVentral Premotor Cortex\n100X oil immersion\n1/80\n5 \u00d7 5\n1000 \u00d7 1000\n5\n1\nBromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)\nSubventricular Zone\nSubgranular Zone\n60X oil immersion\n1/20\n150 \u00d7 90\n150 \u00d7 90 (exhaustive)\n15\n1\nOpen in a new tab\n\nStereology Object Estimates\nThe estimated total number of c-Fos labeled cells, synaptophysin labeled puncta, and BrdU labeled cells in each ROI were calculated using the optical fractionator formula: N=Q\n\u2212\n\u00d71/ssf\u00d71/asf\u00d7t/h (\nSutula and West, 2002\n;\nWest et al., 1991\n), where N is the estimate of the total number of objects, Q\n\u2212\nis the number of objects counted, ssf is the section sampling fraction, asf is the area sampling fraction, and t/h is the actual section thickness (t) divided by the height (h) of the dissector. Parameters were optimized such that Coefficients of Error were less than 0.10 using a Smoothness Factor m=1 for biological tissue (\nGundersen et al., 1999\n). Estimated activated cell (c-Fos) numbers were used for analysis. Estimated BrdU cell density and synaptophysin puncta density measures were used for analysis (estimated cell number divided by Cavalieri estimated volume in mm\n3\n).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using R (RStudio Inc, Version 0.99.896, R foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was used to identify significant variables and interactions with treatment group (hUTC treated or placebo) as a between subject variable and hemisphere (ipsilesional and contralesional) as a within subject variable. Separate two-way ANOVAs with repeated measures (six total) were used to analyze c-Fos (PMv and PMd), synaptophysin (PMv and PMd), and BrdU (SVZ and SGZ). Significance level was set to\np\n\u2264 0.05. Tukey Post-hoc tests were used to identify significant variables. Regression analyses were performed with subjects from both groups together. For correlations relating to the mean grasp (an ordinal scale, 0-8), Spearman\u2019s Correlation was used, and all other correlations were assessed using a Pearson\u2019s Correlation with an alpha level set at\np\n\u2264 0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThree cohorts of C57BLKS (BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr\ndb\n/J; stock number 000642, Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME)\ndb/db\nmice, a well-characterized murine model of T2D, were used for the study. Control (\ndb\n/+) and diabetic (\ndb/db\n) mice were fed a standard diet (5LOD, 13.4% kcal fat for 8/24 wk; or AIN76A, 11.5% kcal fat for 16 wk; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ). Mice were cared for in a pathogen-free environment by the University of Michigan Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine. Mice were, euthanized at 8, 16 or 24 weeks of age using a lethal injection of pentobarbital (Vortech, Dearborn, MI). Animal protocols were approved by the University of Michigan University Committee on Use and Care of Animals.\n\nMetabolic and Neuropathy Phenotyping\nControl\ndb\n/+ and\ndb/db\nmice were phenotyped for body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and glycated hemoglobin (GHb) levels (n = 5\u20136 for each group per time point). FBG levels were measured with an AlphaTrak Glucometer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) for 8 and 16 wk mice and a standard Glucometer (OneTouch; LifeScan Inc., Milpitas, CA) for 24 wk mice. GHb levels were determined using a Glyco-Tek Affinity column (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX) at the Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center Chemistry Core. Peripheral nerve function was assessed at 8, 16, and 24 wk according to Diabetic Complications Consortium guidelines (\nhttps://www.diacomp.org/shared/protocols.aspx\n). Motor (sciatic) and sensory (sural) nerve conduction velocities (NCVs), hind-paw withdrawal latency from a thermal stimulus, and intraepidermal nerve fiber density were measured for large and small fiber nerve function, and small fiber loss using our previously published protocols\n16\n\u2013\n19\n. Data from 16 wk and 24 wk cohorts are previously published\n9\n,\n11\n.\n\nMicroarray Data Analyses\nLumbar DRG were harvested, and nerve roots removed under a dissecting microscope. A 15 mm segment of SCN was harvested immediately proximal to the sural/tibial/peroneal trifurcation, and adherent fat and connective tissue removed under a dissecting microscope. Total RNA was collected from SCN and DRG at 8 wk (\ndb\n/+, n = 5;\ndb/db\n, n = 6), 16 wk (\ndb\n/+, n = 6;\ndb/db\n, n = 6), and 24 wk (\ndb\n/+, n = 6;\ndb/db\n, n = 6) using the silica gel-based isolation protocol RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) at each time point. RNA quality was measured using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Samples meeting RNA quality criteria were analyzed by microarray as previously described\n11\n. In brief, total RNA (75 ng) was amplified and biotin-labeled using the Ovation Biotin-RNA Amplification System (NuGEN Technologies Inc., San Carlos, CA) per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol; amplification and hybridization were performed by the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core using the Affymetrix GeneChip\u00ae Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). These studies include previously published transcriptomics datasets (16 wk SCN and DRG\n9\n; 24 wk SCN\n11\n).\n\nQuality Control\nThe quality of the microarray CEL files were assessed using the affyAnalysisQC R package (\nhttp://arrayanalysis.org\n) with Bioconductor (\nwww.bioconductor.org\n). The Robust Multi-array Average method with the BrainArray Custom Chip Definition File version 19\n20\nwas applied to normalize each group of microarray data using GenePattern (\nhttp://genepattern.broadinstitute.org/gp/\n).\n\nSelf-Organizing Map Analysis\nPatterns of gene expression were identified during DPN progression in SCN and DRG in an unbiased manner using SOM analysis. To compare the gene expression changes across the groups, fold-change (FC) values of all genes at 8, 16, and 24 wk for each tissue were calculated. Due to biological and technical variation resulting from different harvest time points and microarray batches, a log\n2\n-transformed fold-change ratio between\ndb\n/+ and\ndb/db\nwas used for SOM input data. To enhance the visualization of SOM algorithms, Melikerion (Version 1.2.1) software (\nhttp://www.finndiane.fi/software/melikerion/\n) was used with a 7\u00d77 grid structure\n21\n. Genes having a similar FC pattern across the groups were gathered together in cells called \u2018modules\u2019. Functional enrichment analysis using DAVID (\nhttp://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov\n) based on Gene Ontology with a Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) corrected p-value (<0.05) identified the enriched functions in each module\n22\n. Pathway enrichment analysis was then performed to identify significantly enriched canonical pathways with a BH corrected p-value (<0.05) for the clusters of interest using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (\nwww.qiagen.com/ingenuity\n).\n\nDifferential Expression Analysis\nConventional differential analysis was performed by pairwise comparisons between groups (\ndb\n/+ vs.\ndb/db\n) for each group in SCN and DRG. DEGs were determined using the Significance Analysis of Microarrays tool\n23\nwith an estimated false discovery rate of <0.05 on the basis of 1,000 permutations. Next, DEG sets were identified at each time point to identify unique and common DEG sets between time points. To functionally characterize DEG sets common between all three time points, pathway enrichment analysis was then performed to identify significantly enriched canonical pathways with a BH corrected p-value (<0.05) using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (\nwww.qiagen.com/ingenuity\n).\n\nMultiplex Analysis\nCytokine levels were analyzed in SCN from an additional cohort of 8- (n = 6 per group) and 24-wk (n = 6 per group)\ndb\n/+ and\ndb/db\nmice as previously described\n15\n. Briefly, SCN samples were homogenized and cytokine concentrations in the lysate were analyzed using MILLIPLEX xMAP magnetic bead technology (Millipore, Billerica, MA) with an MMP-12 (MMMP3MAG-79K) and custom cytokine/chemokine panel (MCYTOMAG-70K). Multiplex assays were run on a Bio- Plex200 multiplex array system with Bio-Plex Manager\u2122 6.0 software (BioRad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Protein levels of 17 immune markers were determined: eotaxin, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IP-10, KC, MCP-1, MIG, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, RANTES, TNF-\u03b1, and MMP-12.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nF-tests were used to determine whether data sets were normally distributed. For phenotypic measurements, which were normally distributed, statistically significant differences were determined using a two-tailed t-test. For Multiplex assays, which were non-normally distributed, comparisons were performed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. All tests were performed using Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA)."

    "Methods": "All experiments were approved and carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of California, Irvine, and University of Southern California. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (227 \u00b1 3 g, n=19) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Hollister, CA, USA), and maintained in the animal facility under controlled conditions (68 \u00b1 2\u00b0 F, equivalent to ~20 \u00b1 1\u00b0C; humidity 30-70%), housed 2 animals per cage on a 12 h light-dark cycle, and fed with standard chow. After surgical procedures, rats were single housed for 5 days with enhanced enrichment, and then housed as 2 rats per cage until the urodynamic evaluations.\n\nPreparation for mapping EUS activation by SCS in control rats\nA total of 7 female spinally intact rats were anesthetized by urethane (1.2 g/kg, subcutaneously; sc) 1 hour prior to the surgical procedures. Each animal was placed on a water-circulating heating pad to maintain body temperature. A T11-L3 laminectomy was performed to expose the L1-6 spinal cord segments. Teflon-coated stainless steel wires (AS632; Cooner Wire, Chatsworth, CA, USA) were prepared by removing a small portion (\u223c1mm notch) of the Teflon coating to expose the stainless steel before placing the wire tips onto the dura overlying the dorsal surface of the spinal cord. The electrodes were secured in position by suturing each wire to the dura over the spinal segments of interest (\nAbud et al., 2015\n;\nIchiyama et al., 2005\n). Bipolar differential electrodes were used, and the electrical current only circulated the area between the exposure sites. The wires were placed 2-3 mm apart from the 1-mm exposed tip of each wire. The estimated total area (rostro-caudally) receiving the electrical current was limited to a maximum of 5 mm\n2\n. The wires were connected to a stimulator (Grass S88, Grass Technologies, West Warwick, RI, USA) through a stimulus isolation unit (Grass SIU5, Grass Technologies, West Warwick, RI, USA).\nTwo 50-\u03bcm PFA-insulated platinum-iridium wire electrodes (A-M Systems, Everett, WA, USA) with 2-mm exposed tips were inserted into the EUS, aided by a 27-gauge needle bilaterally. The wire electrodes were subsequently connected to an amplifier (MP150; Biopac Systems Inc., Goleta, CA, USA) to record EUS EMG activity. For functional mapping of urethral activation, SCS was applied to the dorsal portion of the spinal cord at individual lumbar segmental levels, and the effects on EUS EMG activity were recorded.\n\nPelvic nerve crush (PNC) injury\nRats (n=6) were anesthetized with 2-4% isoflurane with oxygen. Each animal was placed on a water-circulating heating pad. A midline abdominal incision was made to expose the major pelvic ganglia and identify the bilateral pelvic nerves by established methods (\nChang et al., 2007\n;\nChang and Havton, 2010\n). The bilateral pelvic nerves were crushed by using a straight micro-mosquito clamp for 1 minute (\nTyagi et al., 2014\n). The incision was closed, and all animals were allowed to recover. Enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg, sc, Putney Inc., Portland, ME, USA) and Ketoprofen (5 mg/kg, sc, Zoetis Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA) were given once a day for 5 days post-operation. All animals were monitored post-operatively for 14 days before undergoing L3/SCS and urodynamic studies as a terminal procedure.\n\nPreparation for L3/SCS and urodynamic recordings in control and PNC groups\nA laminectomy to expose the dorsal surface of the lumbar spinal cord and place stimulation electrodes was performed under urethane anesthesia as described above. The stimulating wires were placed over the dura at the L3 segment level only to evaluate effect of L3/SCS on urodynamic recordings in control (n=6) and PNC injured (n=6) rats. All animals underwent placements of a bladder catheter and EUS EMG wires according to established methods (\nAbud et al., 2015\n;\nChang et al., 2007\n). Briefly, a midline incision was made to expose the bladder. A flared tip of a PE-50 catheter (Instech Laboratories, Plymouth, MA, USA) was inserted through the top of the bladder dome and secured by a thread. The bladder catheter was connected to an infusion pump (KDS 100; KD Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA) and a pressure sensor (MP150; Biopac Systems Inc., Goleta, CA, USA) via a 3-way connector. For urodynamic studies, the infusion rate of saline was set at 0.1 ml/min. A collecting cup was positioned under the urethral outlet to measure the voided volume.\nTwo urodynamic experiments were conducted in the same animal to first determine the effects of continuous bladder infusion alone and next to determine the effects of L3/SCS when the bladder was partially filled. The threshold intensity for SCS was decided as the minimal intensity that produced inhibition of the EUS tonic activity. SCS was applied at 1-3 fold of the threshold intensity (1-5 Volts) at 40 Hz and 0.2 ms pulse width for 60-90 seconds. The intensity was adjusted to avoid and/or minimize hind limb movements and body tremors.\n\nMorphological investigation\nThe bladder and urethra were harvested from animals in the control and PNC groups after the completion of the urodynamic recordings. The tissues were first placed in 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) for at least 24 hours. Next, the tissues were rinsed and stored in 70% ethanol before paraffin embedding by the histological service core at USC. Briefly, the tissue embedding process occurred overnight, using the pre-programmed Tissue Processor (ATP-1, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), and then the tissue was embedded in paraffin wax (Surgipath Paraplast X-tra, LEICA, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). The wax-embedded samples were next removed from the processor and longitudinally sectioned at a thickness of 5 \u03bcm. The tissue sections were placed on glass slides and heated at 60\u00b0C for 30 to 40 minutes to allow the samples to adhere to the glass.\nSerial bladder and urethral longitudinal sections underwent hematoxylin\u2013eosin (H&E) staining and were prepared for light microscopy (\nZhang et al., 2016\n). A Leica (DM IRB, LEICA, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) light microscope was used to measure the wall thickness of the middle portion of the bladder and the middle urethra containing the EUS using the SPOT camera and software program (Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI, USA). The bladder wall thickness measurements included the urothelium, lamina propria and smooth muscle. The outermost layer, or serosa, which is external to the smooth muscle layer, was not included in these measurements.\n\nOutcome measurements\nDuring continuous bladder infusion with saline, three voiding contractions were recorded. Cystometry parameters included maximum intravesical pressure (IVPmax), voided volume after voiding, and contraction duration (CD). In addition, maximum amplitude and area under the curve (AUC) were determined from EUS EMG activity. The AUC of the EMG activity is the integral values identified by AcKnowledge 4.0 (Biopac Systems Inc., Goleta, CA, USA). Tonic AUC is measured during the period from the pressure threshold to the first peak of detrusor contraction. Bursting AUC is measured during the EUS bursting. The latency of the first void (LFV) was measured as the period from the start of filling of the empty bladder to the time of the onset of the first void. Bladder capacity was calculated as the volume (ml) based on [LFV (minute) \u00d7 infusion rate (0.1 ml/minute)]. Residual volume (RV) was calculated as the value of (total infused volume \u2013 voided volume). Voiding efficiency (VE) was calculated as (voided volume / total infused volume) and expressed in percentage. To evaluate voiding contractions induced by L3/SCS, the bladder was partially filled to 50 - 95% of bladder capacity in each animal to facilitate bladder afferent activity before giving SCS (\nAbud et al., 2015\n;\nChang et al., 2006\n,\n2007\n;\nTai et al., 2004\n). Three episodes were induced and separated by 5-minute resting periods.\n\nStatistical analysis\nQuantitative data were presented as mean \u00b1 standard error. Unpaired t-test was used to compare the urodynamic measurements between control and PNC rats. Paired t-test was used to compare urodynamic measurements with and without L3/SCS in the experimental groups. P < 0.05 was considered to reflect a significant change. Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for the statistical analysis and graphs."

    "Methods": "Animals\nTransgenic CST-YFP mice, in which the cortical neurons in the forebrain and the CST are specifically labeled by YFP, were used in a blinded fashion for functional evaluation and tissue analysis. These mice were generated by an in-house breeding colony of two transgenic mouse strains of B6.Cg-Tg (Thy1-EYFP)15Jrs/J and B6.129-Emx1\ntm1 (cre)Krj\n/J purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) (\nBareyre et al., 2005\n;\nLiu et al., 2013\n;\nLiu et al., 2009\n). All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Henry Ford Hospital.\n\nAnimal Model\nAdult male CST-YFP mice (n=22; 2\u20133 month-old; body weight 25\u201330 g) were subjected to permanent right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) using a method of intraluminal suture vascular occlusion, modified in our laboratory(\nChen et al., 2005\n). Briefly under isoflurane anesthesia, an 8-0 surgical nylon suture with an expanded silicone tip was advanced from the right external carotid artery (ECA) into the lumen of the internal carotid artery (ICA) to block the origin of the MCA. Two mice died within the first week post-surgery, and the remaining animals were randomly divided into the tPA-treatment group or the control group (n=10/group). Another group of CST-YFP mice (n=10; of comparable age and weight versus the mice in MCAo groups) without surgery were used for normal control.\n\nIntranasal administration of tPA\nThe mice allocated to the active intervention group were administered 4 doses of tPA (300 ug/dose; Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA, USA) intranasally at day 7, 9, 11 and 13 after MCAo. The method described by Thorne et al (\nThorne et al., 2004\n) was modified by placing ten 3-\u00b5L drops alternately onto each nostril with a 3-min interval between drops which were naturally sniffed in by the mouse placed in a supine and horizontal head position (\nLiu et al., 2012\n). The mice were kept in a supine position for an additional 10 min. The same method of administration of the same volume of saline (30 uL in total) was used in the animals of control group. The volume of the dose was determined by the volume of the nasal cavity of the mouse (\nGross et al., 1982\n).\n\nBehavioral Tests\nTo monitor the neurological functional deficits and recovery, two kinds of tests were performed prior to MCAo, and at 1, 3, and 7 days after MCAo, and weekly thereafter. An adhesive-removal test was applied to detect the sensorimotor deficits after CNS injury; a small quarter-circle adhesive-backed paper dot was placed onto the impaired forepaw, and the time to remove the dot was recorded (\nChen et al., 2001\n). In addition, a single-pellet reaching test was performed to characterize skilled reaching ability of the impaired left forepaw (\nFarr and Whishaw, 2002\n;\nLiu et al., 2013\n). Animals were trained for 2 weeks before surgery to use their left forepaw to extract 14-mg food pellets (Bio-Serv Inc, Frenchtown, NJ, USA) through a vertical slot of the front wall. We counted the number of the left forepaw extensions through the slot and the number of pellets extracted, and then recorded the pellet number extracted in a total of 20 attempts. Performance was defined by Percent Success = (number of successful retrievals/20)*100 (\nFarr and Whishaw, 2002\n;\nLiu et al., 2013\n).\n\nRetrograde PRV tracing\nWhen the behavioral tests were completed at day 28 after MCAo, a retrograde trans-synaptic tracer PRV-614-RFP (Gift from Dr. Lynn Enquist, Princeton University NJ, USA) of a 10 \u00b5l total volume was injected into the wrist flexor muscles of the left stroke-impaired forelimb through a skin incision. Then the animals survived 4 additional days in a Biosafety Level-2 facility to allow for virus transport from the muscles to the motor cortices prior to sacrifice (\nLiu et al., 2009\n). Mice in the normal control group also received the same dose of PRV-614-RFP injection at 4 days before sacrifice.\n\nTissue preparation\nThe mice were sacrificed 4 days after PRV injection and then perfused with saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The entire brain and the cervical cord were immersed in paraformaldehyde overnight. The brain was cut into 100 \u00b5m-thick coronal sections by using a vibratome machine. A series of sections with 900 \u00b5m intervals were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to measure ischemic lesion volume. A series of sections were processed for Prussian blue staining (ferric hexacyanoferrate and hydrochloric acid, Sigma) to measure residual focal hemosiderin accumulation after hemorrhage. Another series of sections with 400 \u00b5m intervals were used to digitize the mRFP-positive pyramidal neurons using fluorescent microscopy in the bilateral cortices. The cervical enlargement (C4-C7) was processed for consecutive vibratome sections, which were scanned with a confocal imaging system to digitize YFP positive CST axons in both sides of the spinal gray matter (\nLiu et al., 2011\n;\nLiu et al., 2009\n).\n\nCell culture of embryonic cortical neurons\nCortical neurons were harvested from pregnant female CST-YFP mice at embryonic day 18. Briefly, embryos were removed under deep Ketamine anesthesia, and then the cerebral cortices were dissected and dissociated in Ca\n2+\nand Mg\n2+\nfree Hanks balance salt solution (HBSS, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Wayne, MI) containing 0.125% trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc) digestion for 20 minutes, then mechanically triturated for ~20 times. The cells were filtered with a 40 \u00b5m cell strainers (BD Falcon, Bedford, MA), and then were seeded onto myelin (10 \u00b5g/ml, Sigma St. Louis, MO) and Poly-D-lysine (1 mg/ml, Sigma) coated 24-well plates at a YFP-neuron density of 5000/well in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM; Gibco, Grand Island, NY) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) for 4\u20136 hours, then changed to neurobasal growth medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc) containing 2% B-27 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc), 2 mM GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc), 2% FBS (Gibco) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc) in a moist incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\n. Five different concentrations of tPA (0.065\u00b5g/ml, 0.65 \u00b5g/ml, 2 \u00b5g/ml, 6.5 \u00b5g/ml, 13 \u00b5g/ml; Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA) were added to five groups of experiment media and another control group was without tPA. After 3 days in culture, the cells were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde for quantification of neurite length and branch number. YFP-positive cells were digitized using a 20x objective (Zeiss) via the MicroComputer Imaging Device (MCID) analysis system (Imaging Research, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada), and analyzed using MCID software for percentage of neurite positive neurons, branch number and neurite length on total 400\u2013600 neurons distributed in 9 random fields per well with five wells per group.\n\nData analysis and statistics\nLesion volume was measured by NIH ImageJ and presented as a volume percentage of the lesion area compared with the contralesional hemisphere (\nSwanson et al., 1990\n). An Olympus FV1200 (Center Valley, PA, USA) laser-scanning confocal imaging system mounted onto an Olympus Bax 40 microscope was used to digitize the mRFP positive pyramidal neurons in the bilateral cerebral cortices and YFP-labeled CST axons on the cervical cord. The number of PRV-positive neurons in the ipsilateral or contralateral cortex were counted on each one of 5 brain consecutive coronal sections (total 6 sections for each animal), and the data were presented at a series of 0.5 mm interval distances to bregma caudal-rostral, as well as a sum for each hemisphere. The midline of the spinal cord was defined by the central canal on spinal transverse sections. CST axonal density in each side of the spinal gray matter was measured by YFP positive area using NIH ImageJ software on 30 consecutive sections, and the percentage of CST density in the stroke-impaired side to the contralateral side on the same sections was calculated, in order to avoid potential inter-section differences in fluorescent measurements (\nLiu et al., 2011\n;\nLiu et al., 2009\n). The average number of relative percentage of CST density in each animal was used as an index for CST axonal remodeling after stroke and treatment.\nData are expressed as the mean\u00b1SE. Differences of behavioral recovery, numbers of RFP-positive pyramidal neurons, index of axonal density, neurite length and branch number between groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Response surface (RS) regression model was used to identify an optimal dose for each response (branch or length grow). Two sample t-test was used to study the lesion difference between the two groups, and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to study the correlation of lesion size and functional recovery. A treatment by time interaction was tested to determine whether the tPA treatment effect depended on the time of follow-up assessment. To test the correlation between behavioral outcome and neuronal remodeling after stroke, the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between the impaired left forepaw motor performance at 28 days after MCAo and the number of RFP-positive cortical neurons and the index of axonal remodeling in the cervical cord were calculated. A value of P<0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "2.1. Neonatal mouse model of hypoxia-ischemia (HI)\nA modified Rice-Vannucci model was produced in postnatal day 7 (P7) C57BL/6J mouse pups modified from the rat model as described previously (\nFerriero et al., 1996\n;\nMa et al., 2016\n;\nRice 3rd et al., 1981\n;\nTen et al., 2004\n). Briefly, mouse pups (Charles River Laboratories) were fully anesthetized with inhalation of 2\u20133% isoflurane. The right common carotid artery (CCA) in the neck was exposed, double ligated with an 8.0 silk surgical suture, and then cut between two ligation sites. After surgery, pups were recuperated on a heating pad for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, and then placed in a hypoxic incubator containing humidified 8% oxygen balanced with 92% nitrogen for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C. At the end of hypoxia, pups were returned to their dams for recovery. Mouse pups of mixed males and females were randomly assigned into each experimental group. There is no significant difference in weights or sex composition in the different groups.\nNppc\nlbab/lbab\n(\nlong bone abnormality\n;\nNppc\n: gene encodes CNP precursor) or wildtype littermate control (WT,\nNppc\n+/+\n) mice were provide by Dr. Zhen Zhao (\nZhao et al., 2009b\n). All procedures and protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Loma Linda University and followed the guidelines by the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\n2.2. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of NPR2 antagonist in mice\nThe stock solution of NPR2 antagonist P19 (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals Inc.) was prepared in 0.1M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. A total volume of 2 \u03bcl NPR2 antagonist solution (500 pmol/pup) were stereo-taxically injected into the ipsilateral hemisphere of P7 mouse pups intracerebroventricularly (placement coordinates: 0.8 mm lateral, 1.5 mm below the skull surface) with a flow rate of 0.5 \u03bcl/min as described previously (\nSadakata et al., 2007\n). Then the HI brain injury was induced about 2 h after i.c.v. injection. For vehicle group, the same volume of PBS was injected into the mouse brains prior to HI operation.\n\n2.3. Measurement of brain infarct size\nBrain infarct size was determined 48 h after HI using 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride monohydrate (TTC, Sigma-Aldrich) staining as described previously (\nMa et al., 2016\n). Briefly, the brain was isolated from each pup, dissected into coronal sections (2 mm thickness, 4 slices per brain), and immersed into pre-warmed 2% TTC in PBS for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C against light. Sections were washed with PBS, and then fixed by 10% formaldehyde overnight. The caudal and the rostral surfaces of each slice were photographed using a digital camera, and the percentage of infarct area (average of both sides) in the ipsilateral hemisphere for each slice was traced and analyzed by the NIH Image J software.\n\n2.4. Neurobehavioral assay\nRotarod test for locomotor function evaluation was performed one month after neonatal HI as described previously (\nHartman et al., 2012\n;\nMa et al., 2016\n). Briefly, the rotarod (Columbus Instruments) consists of a horizontal cylinder (7 cm diameter) divided into four lanes. Three consecutive block trials were administered, in which the rotarod rotated at a constant speed of 5 RPM for 2 trials, followed by 2 trials of acceleration by 3 RPM every 5 s, and finally 2 trials of acceleration by 5 RPM every 3 s. Latency to fall was recorded as the time of walking on the cylinder.\n\n2.5. Primary cortical neuron isolation, culture and treatment\nPrimary cortical neurons were prepared from early postnatal (P0) mouse pups of either sex as described previously (\nBeaudoin 3rd et al., 2012\n). Briefly, the cerebral cortices from P0 mouse pups were removed into HBSS buffer (Fisher Scientific) and dissociated with 0.25% trypsin (Fisher Scientific) and DNAse (Sigma) for 15 min at 37.0 \u00b0C water bath. After trituration with fire-polished Pasteur pipettes, dissociated cells were suspended in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen), 1% GlutaMAX (100\u00d7; Invitrogen) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and run through a 40 \u03bcm cell strainer (Fisher Scientific). Cell suspensions plated on poly-D-lysine solution (PDL, 0.1 mg/ml in boric acid buffer; Sigma-Aldrich)-coated 6-well plates (Corning) or 96-well plates (Corning) were used for biochemical assays; Cell suspensions plated on PDL-coated German 12 mm glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific) in 24-well plates (Corning) were used for immunocytochemistry staining at 200\u2013400 cells/mm\n2\n. After being seeded, cells were maintained in a CO\n2\nincubator (5% CO\n2\n, 21% O\n2\n) at 37 \u00b0C. At day 2 of\nin vitro\nculture (DIV2), 2 \u03bcM cytosine \u03b2-D-arabinofuranoside hydrochloride (Ara-C; Sigma), an inhibitor of DNA replication, was added into culture medium to inhibit non-neuronal cell proliferation. Half of the culture medium was replaced every 2\u20133 days. Experiments were conducted at DIV 5\u20137, when cultures consisted primarily of neurons (approximately 90% MAP2-positive cells by immunocytochemistry staining).\nRecombinant ANP, BNP and CNP was purchased from Sigma. NPR3 antagonist AP811 was purchased from Tocris. The stock solution was prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. For the neuro-protective effect study, primary cortical neurons were incubated with CNP, BNP or ANP for 6 h at concentration of 0, 5, 25, 100, or 500 nM. For other experiments, primary cortical neurons were incubated with ANP, BNP or CNP for 6 h at concentration of 100 nM. For the effect of NPR2 antagonist P19 or NPR3 antagonist AP811, primary cortical neurons were incubated with P19 or AP811 alone, or with the presence of CNP for 6 h at concentration of 500 nM.\n\n2.6. Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)\nPrimary cortical neurons were subjected to OGD insult as reported previously (\nFrantseva et al., 1999\n;\nNewcomb-Fernandez et al., 2001\n;\nYin et al., 2002\n;\nZhao et al., 2009a\n). Briefly, the neuron culture media were replaced with pre-warmed glucose-deprived Neurobasal-A medium (Invitrogen) pre-equilibrated with 1% oxygen, and then primary neurons were cultured in an incubator filled with 1% oxygen (5% CO\n2\n/94% N\n2\n) for 0.5, 1 or 1.5 h at 37 \u00b0C. At the end of hypoxia, cells were transferred to normal culture medium, returned to normal culture condition and incubated for 24 h (reoxygenation).\n\n2.7. Neuronal damage assays\nThe degree of cell injury at the end of reoxygenation was assessed by determining the amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into the culture medium using the Pierce\u2122 LDH Cytotoxicity assay kit (Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The medium was mixed with equal volume of reaction solution in a 96-well plate and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then the reaction was stopped by loading of stop solution, and read with a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments). The background signal (absorbance at 630 nm) was subtracted from reaction signal (absorbance at 490 nm). At least three independent experiments in duplicate were used for LDH release assay. The results were shown as fold changes over normal controls.\nCell viability was further evaluated using the LIVE/DEAD\u2122 Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. At the end of the experiment, primary neurons seeded on the coverslips were washed with warm medium and incubated with calcein AM (4 \u03bcM) and ethidium homodimer 2 \u03bcM) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Living cells show green fluorescence because of the uptake of calcein AM (excitation/emission: 495/515 nm), while dying cells show red fluorescence because of the penetration of ethidium homodimer (excitation/emission: 495/635 nm) that interacts with nucleic acids. Primary neurons were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min and mounted on slides using fluorescent mounting media (Dako). Images were obtained with the EVOS Cell Imaging Systems (Invitrogen). The number of live (green) and dead (red) cells was counted using the NIH image J software. At least three independent experiments in duplicate were used for live/dead cell counting. The results were presented as the percentage of dead cells of total cells.\nNeuronal death was detected using the Roche In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (TUNEL assay) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen). After being washed, coverslips with primary neurons were mounted on slides using fluorescent mounting media (Dako). Images were obtained with the EVOS Cell Imaging Systems (Invitrogen) and analyzed using the NIH Image J software. Eight images from each coverslip were taken with 20\u00d7 objective. At least three independent experiments in duplicate were used for TUNEL-positive cell counting. The data are presented as the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in total cells.\n\n2.8. Isolation of cerebrovascular endothelial cells\nThe primary brain endothelial cells were prepared from P5\u20136 mouse pups as described previously (\nDaneman et al., 2010\n;\nWatson et al., 2013\n;\nWu et al., 2003\n;\nZhao et al., 2015b\n). Briefly, the mouse brains were diced using a scalpel in a Petri dish on ice into maximum 2-mm pieces, and then suspended in ice-cold HBSS in Eppendorf tubes before the homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were incubated with a pre-warmed digestion mix containing 1 mg/ml collagenase/dispase (Roche), 10 \u03bcg/ml DNAse I (Roche) and 0.147 \u03bcg/ml tosyl-lysyl-chloromethylketone (TLCK) for indicated time at 37 \u00b0C and then centrifuged (700 g, 2 min). The collected pellet was re-suspended in DMEM, supplemented with 20% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 2.5 \u03bcg/ml amphotericin B (Gibco Laboratories) (Invitrogen) and transferred to culture dishes. The medium was replaced after 2\u20133 days after seeding. The purity of brain endothelial cells is detected by endothelial cell marker (von Willebrand factor) staining (\nWu et al., 2003\n).\n\n2.9. Western blotting\nProtein extraction of cerebrovascular endothelial cells or primary cortical neurons was obtained using RIPA lysis buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with further centrifugation for 30min at 14,000g at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined using a detergent compatible assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were loaded on an SDS-PAGE gel. After being electrophoresed and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane was blocked and incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The primary antibodies included: rabbit anti-NPR2 polyclonal antibody (Abcam) and mouse anti-\u03b2-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1h at room temperature. Immunoblots were then probed with an ECL Plus chemiluminescence reagent kit (Fisher Scientific) and visualized with the imaging system (Bio-Rad, Versa Doc, model 4000). The images were analyzed using the NIH Image J software.\n\n2.10. Immunofluorescence staining and TUNEL assay on brain slices\nMouse pups were transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS followed by 4% PFA. The brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight, dehydrated with 30% sucrose solution in PBS at 4\u00b0C, and allowed to completely sink to the bottom of the container. Then the dehydrated brains were dissected, embedded into Tissue-Tek optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) (VWR) on dry ice, and cryosectioned at a thickness of 20 \u03bcm for immunofluorescence staining. Slices were blocked with 5% donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 1 h, then incubated with mouse anti-NeuN antibody (Millipore, 1:500) and rabbit anti-NPR2 antibody (Abcam, 1:400) overnight at 4 \u00b0C and stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, 1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed, tissue slices were mounted and coverslipped with fluorescent mounting media (Dako).\nCell death was detected using the\nIn Situ\nCell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein (Roche) following neuron staining described above. The TUNEL staining was completed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All slides were scanned with a Zeiss LSM 710 NLO confocal microscope (Zeiss) in Advanced Imaging and Microscopy Facility of Center of Perinatal biology and analyzed using the NIH Image J version 1.41 software.\n\n2.11. Immunocytochemistry\nCortical neurons grown on PDL-coated glass coverslips were washed once with ice-cold PBS, and then fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min. After permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and blocking with 5% donkey serum in PBS for 30 min, cells were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The primary antibodies included: mouse anti-MAP2 polyclonal antibody (Biolegend) and rabbit anti-NPR2 polyclonal antibody (Abcam). After being washed with PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. All secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen. The nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen). After being washed, coverslips with cells were mounted on slides using fluorescent mounting media (Dako). All slides were scanned with a Zeiss LSM 710 NLO confocal microscope (Zeiss) in Advanced Imaging and Microscopy Facility of Center of Perinatal biology and analyzed using the NIH Image J software.\n\n2.12. Statistical analysis\nData were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM).All graphs in this study were generated with GraphPad Prism 5. In experiments related to animals, experimental number (n) represents neonates from at least two different dams. All\nin vitro\nexperiments were performed at least three times. Comparisons between two groups were analyzed using Student\u2019s\nt\n-test (unpaired, two-tailed), and multiple comparisons were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls\npost hoc\ntest. A\np\nvalue < 0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Overview\nISMS was delivered between the second cervical (C2) and the first thoracic (T1) segment (\nFig. 1A, B\n) and evoked respiratory muscle activity was recorded in six adult female Long-Evans rats (267\u00b121 g). Somatotopic maps of ISMS-evoked responses were obtained during the inspiratory phase and the expiratory phase of the respiration cycle. Ten stimuli were delivered during both the inspiratory and expiratory phase at each of five amplitudes ranging from 10\u201390 \u00b5A in steps of 20 \u00b5A (\nFig. 1D\u2013F\n). Prior to the ISMS procedure, respiratory muscles were injected with fluorescently conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) to determine the relationship between the anatomical location of the motoneurons and the locations with which they can be activated with ISMS. Animals were housed in a photo-shifted room (12hr dark, 12hr light; lights off at 10am and on at 10pm) and surgeries began at 8:23am \u00b11.81hrs (mean \u00b1SD). All procedures were approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nFigure 1.

After all stimulus intensities are delivered during one phase of respiration, stimulation is then delivered during the opposite respiratory phase at each intraspinal location.\n\nSurgical Procedure-Wheat Germ Agglutinin Injection\nThree days prior to the ISMS mapping procedure, rats were anesthetized with either an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (80 mg kg\n\u22121\n; Pfizer) and xylazine (10 mg kg\n\u22121\n; Lloyd) or 2% isoflurane. Small incisions were made in the skin over the sternocleidomastoid and rostral intercostal. Additionally, the pectoralis muscle was incised to allow for a more accurate injection of 2.5% WGA (25\u201350\u00b5l; reconstituted in 0.9% saline). WGA was conjugated to Alexa-Fluor 555 or 594 and injected into the sternocleidomastoid and external intercostal respectively. An injection of 2.5% WGA conjugated to Alexa-Fluor 488 (ThermoFisher Scientific\nW11261\n) was administered intrapleurally to label the motoneurons of the diaphragm (\nButtry and Goshgarian, 2015\n). Muscles and skin were sutured in layers and buprenorphine (0.05 mg kg\n\u22121\n) was administered to suppress sensation during anesthesia and recovery.\n\nSurgical Procedure-mapping\nThree days after WGA injection, rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (80 mg kg\n\u22121\n; Pfizer) and xylazine (10 mg kg\n\u22121\n; Lloyd). Supplemental doses of ketamine were given as needed to maintain a stable plane of sedation throughout the procedure. Hydration was maintained with 0.9% saline solution delivered subcutaneously (Baxter). All surgical procedures were performed on a water recirculating heating pad to maintain body temperature.\nAn incision was made on the dorsal surface through the skin, and muscles overlying cervical segments C1\u2013C7 and the thoracic segments T1\u2013T2 were dissected away from the vertebral columns and lamina. A right hemi-laminectomy was performed from C2-T1 which exposed 13.7\u00b11.2 mm (mean \u00b1 SD) of the spinal cord. The dura was incised to permit electrode insertion without dimpling of the dorsal spinal cord surface (\nFig. 1B\n). Separate incisions were made in the skin in order to place bipolar electromyography (EMG) electrodes in the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and external intercostal (EIC). An additional incision was made through the skin and rectus abdominus to access the costal region of the diaphragm (DIA). EMG wires consisted of 50 \u00b5m tungsten wires (A-M systems; 797500). Electrode placement was verified by observing regular synchronized bursting of the inspiratory muscles diaphragm and external intercostal during breathing with no phasic activity of the sternocleidomastoid (\nFig. 2A\n). A final incision was made on the ventral surface in the skin to access the trachea. A tracheotomy was then performed which allowed for ventilation with oxygen (100%) during the mapping procedure which consisted of ISMS delivered in 20 tracks throughout the cervical and high thoracic spinal cord.\nFigure 2. Example EMG traces and stimulus triggered averages.\nOpen in a new tab\nA) Electromyography recordings from the sternocleidomastoid (SCM), external intercostal (EIC), and diaphragm (DIA) muscles showing stimulation during inspiration (open arrowhead) and expiration (closed arrowhead). B) Expanded stimulus triggered average of evoked responses in the diaphragm when stimulation was delivered during inspiration illustrating that the evoked response was easily discernible from the background activity. Dashed line indicated threshold. C) Stimulus triggered averages (StTAs) reveal the dynamic excitation during inspiration (light colors) compared to expiration (dark colors) for the DIA and EIC. Arrow indicates the delivery of the single pulse ISMS stimulus.\n\nIntraspinal microstimulation mapping\nStimuli were delivered using a single epoxy coated tungsten microelectrode (part number: UEWSFESEBN3F; impedance 300\u2013500 k\u03a9; Fred Haer) positioned by a stereotaxic manipulator (Kopf Instruments) mounted on a custom spinal fixation frame. Constant current stimuli consisted of a single symmetric biphasic square-wave pulse with a duration of 300 \u00b5s per phase. Current returned through a distant bare wire electrode placed under the skin above the hindquarters. Stimulation was delivered with an analog stimulus isolator (model 2200; A-M systems) controlled by 1401 Power3 (Cambridge Electronic Design) using custom Spike2 software. Stimulus amplitudes ranged from 10 to 90 \u00b5A in increments of 20 \u00b5A. A total of ten stimulation pulses at each of the five amplitudes were produced during inspiration and expiration, with the order of delivery randomized (\nFig. 1D\u2013F\n). To reduce bias associated with the duration of the procedure, the starting positions of ISMS tracks were randomized in the anterior \u2013posterior and medial-lateral directions between each animal.\nThe exposed C1-T2spinal cord was measured and divided into an evenly spaced 10 \u00d7 2 grid. This resulted in ten uniformly spaced stimulation sites along the rostrocaudal axis from C1-T2. At each of these sites, 2 locations were stimulated, designated as medial (0.5 mm from spinal midline) and lateral (1.0 mm from midline). Electrodes were advanced ventrally from the surface of the spinal cord in increments of 600 \u00b5m to a total depth of 2400 \u00b5m and 1800 \u00b5m for the medial and lateral tracks, respectively (\nFig. 1C\n). The order of each stimulation track was randomized prior to the mapping procedure for each animal. This approach enabled an unbiased and reproducible \u201cmapping\u201d of responses to electrical stimulation along the extent of the cervical and high thoracic spinal cord. Based on published descriptions of the \u201ctransition points\u201d between spinal cord segments in the rat (\nPadmanabhan and Singh, 1979\n) we estimate that the 10 stimulation sites (i.e., in the 10\u00d72 grid) were: mC2, rC3, rC4, cC4, cC5, cC6, cC7, mC8, mT1, mT2 (m=middle, r=rostral, c=caudal). Throughout the text, when segments are mentioned (e.g. C2) this refers the vertebral bones, not the spinal segments, as those were not directly assessed in this procedure.\n\nEMG recording\nISMS-evoked electromyography (EMG) was recorded using a differential amplifier (A-M systems 1700). Data were digitized using a 16 channel data acquisition unit (1401-Power3) and custom Spike2 acquisition software. Integrated diaphragm EMG activity was used to trigger stimulation during either expiration or inspiration, and an example of this is shown in\nFigure 1\n. EMG data were recorded at 20,000 samples per second and analog band-pass filtered between 300 \u2013 20,000Hz and saved to disk for offline filtering and analysis (see Data Analysis section).\n\nTissue slicing and image processing\nAt the conclusion of the mapping procedure, animals were euthanized with an intraperitoneal injection of beuthanasia (200 mg kg\n\u22121\n) and transcardially perfused with saline followed by 10% formalin. A fiducial mark was made at the center of the C2 vertebral bone to standardize the comparison between electrophysiological data and histology. Tissue was post-fixed overnight in 10% formalin then placed in 30% sucrose for cryoprotection. Spinal cord tissue from all animals was sliced (60 \u00b5m) in the coronal plane, using a cryostat (Leica CM1850).\nCoronal sections were photographed using an inverted widefield microscope (LEICA DM IRB/E) with a 10\u00d7 primary objective. Images were processed using custom MATLAB software where slice and gray-white borders were traced and motoneurons were manually identified. There was an average of 753\u00b1172 \u00b5m between analyzed sections.\n\nData Analysis\nEvoked muscle activity was low pass filtered at 5kHz to remove extraneous frequencies and anti-alias the data which was then compiled into stimulus triggered averages (StTAs,\nFig. 2B\u2013C\n) using custom MATLAB software (The MathWorks). Sweeps with significant EMG response were identified and the amplitude of and time to response were quantified (\nSunshine et al., 2013\n). A significant EMG response in the StTA was defined as an event starting after the resolution of the stimulus artifact that crossed a threshold greater than \u00b150 \u00b5V for longer than 1 ms (\nSunshine et al., 2013\n).\n\nData Pooling\nWe stimulated at 5 medial depths and 4 lateral depths at each of the 10 coordinates along the C2-T1 rostro-caudal axis. Within each individual animal the percentage of sites (out of the 90) that elicited an evoked potential for each muscle was determined and an average across all animals was created by standardizing the location on the 10\u00d72 spinal cord grid (\nFig. 3\n). The relative likelihood of activating a given muscle or pair of muscles was determined by calculating the percentage of the nine possible stimulus sites at each segmental location that produced the particular activation pattern (\nFig. 4\n). This was calculated within each animal and then averaged between animals to form the contours in\nFig. 4\n. These contours do not represent the lowest possible stimulus current to activate any muscle but rather the lowest stimulus current to produce the muscle represented in the contour.\nFigure 3.

Diaphragm (DIA), External Intercostal (EIC) and Sternocleidomastoid (SCM).\nThe amplitude of the evoked response was calculated at the lowest stimulus current to produce an evoked response. This was done for all sites within an animal where an evoked response could be elicited. Evoked response amplitude was then averaged within and between animals (\nFig. 5\n). The onset of ISMS induced muscle activation was measured as the duration from stimulus to response, and was determined at each of the stimulus locations. This was assessed for each muscle and then averaged across animals (\nFig. 6\n).\nFigure 5.

Activation onsets for each muscle group were analyzed using an ordinary one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and individual comparisons were performed with Fisher\u2019s Least Significant Difference (LSD) post hoc test.

    "Methods": "2.1. Experimental design\nThis experiment was originally designed to examine the nature of spontaneous axonal adaptation to unilateral transection of the dorsolateral component of the primate corticospinal projection at the T10 level. Following initial findings in the primate model, additional studies were performed in rodents to gain insight into mechanisms underlying observations in the primate model. Primate methods will be described first, followed by rodent methods.\nFor primate studies, the following groups were examined: Group 1 (Intact, N = 4) consisted of intact animals without spinal cord lesions that underwent tracing of the corticospinal tract (CST), with quantification of axons at the L4 spinal cord segment. Tracing time was sufficient (3 months) to allow the tracer to reach the lumbar spinal cord segment (\nLacroix et al., 2004\n). Group 2 (Lesion/No Delay Trace, N = 5) consisted of animals that underwent T10 right dorsolateral CST transections. This lesion removes 90% of all CST axons originating from the left motor cortex that project down the right side of the spinal cord, together with 8% of CST axons originating from the right motor cortex that descend ipsilaterally down the spinal cord in the dorsolateral tract (\nLacroix et al., 2004\n). Lesions spared the\nventral\nCST on the right side, which contains 2% of CST projections that originate from the right motor cortex and travel down the spinal cord (\nLacroix et al., 2004\n). CST axons were quantified at the L4 segment to assess responses of the spared right ventral CST after removal of the right dorsolateral CST. Tracers were injected during the same surgical session that CST lesions were placed. Group 3 (Intact Cervical, N = 3) consisted of intact animals that underwent tracing of the CST, with quantification of axons at the C8 spinal cord segment. Tracing time was sufficient (6 weeks) to allow the tracer to reach the cervical spinal cord segment; tracing times longer than 6 weeks result in movement of most tracer down the spinal cord, away from the mid-cervical segment. Group 4 (Lesion/Delayed Trace, N = 2) consisted of animals with right C7 dorsolateral CST transections that underwent tracer injections six weeks\nafter\nspinal cord lesions were placed. Axons were quantified at the C8 spinal cord segment to assess responses of spared right ventral CST axons to removal of the dorsolateral CST. While we would have preferred to study a complete set of animals with lesions at a single spinal level (either all T10 or all C7), the lesion model was moved from T10 to C7 during the course of this primate research program to enable study of hand function in other experiments; we did not feel justified in subjecting additional monkeys to T10 lesion to address this specific experimental transport question. Instead, we opted to use data from right C7 dorsolateral quadrant lesions in monkeys and to perform additional studies in rat models to confirm findings form the primate model and gain insight into underlying mechanism, as described below. The monkey experiment design is summarized in\nFig. 1\nand the rat in\nFig. 5\n.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nRight dorsolateral corticospinal tract lesion. (A) Schematic Illustrating spinal cord lesion at T10 and Injection of BDA tracer Into the motor cortex ipsilateral to the lesion, thereby labeling the ventral corticospinal tract in the Rhesus monkey. The lesion also transects approximately 10% of descending CST axons originating from the right motor cortex in the monkey. BDA was Injected Into the right motor cortex either at the same time that the lesion was placed, or 2 months later. (B) Nissl stain over transverse spinal cord section at T10 illustrating transection of the right dorsolateral quadrant. Scale bar: 2 mm.\nFig. 5.\nOpen in a new tab\nRat bilateral dorsal column corticospinal tract lesions. (A) Schematic drawing of a bilateral dorsal column corticospinal spinal cord lesion. This lesion transects approximately 90% of descending CST axons from both cortices. Immediately or following a 2-week delay, a mixture of BDA and Lenti-GFP was injected into the right motor cortex. (B) Nissl stain of transverse spinal cord section at C5 illustrating bilateral dorsal column lesion. Scale bar: 2 mm. Scale bar: 1 mm.\n2.1.1. Subjects\nFourteen adult male monkeys (\nMacaca mulatta\n; mean age 9.1 \u00b1 5.3 years, range: 3.8\u201314.5 years) were studied. All surgical procedures were carried out using principles of the Laboratory Animal Care Act (National Institutes of Health Publication 85-23, revised 1985) and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n2.1.2. Spinal cord lesions\nMonkeys were housed individually. Induction of anesthesia was performed with ketamine HC1 (10 mg/kg i.m.) followed by maintenance with isoflurane. To create CST lesions, the level for laminectomy was identified by palpating rostrally from the T2 (C7 spinal level lesion) or T12 (T10 spinal level lesion) spinous processes. A dorsal skin incision was placed over the identified C7 or T10 region and a dorsal laminectomy was performed. To place T10 spinal cord dorsolateral CST lesions, a microwire lesion knife (Kopf, General Valve, Fairfield, NJ) was positioned 0.5 mm lateral to the spinal cord midline on the right side, and lowered to a depth of 2 mm into the cord through a small dural incision. The wire knife was then extruded toward the right lateral aspect of the spinal cord, creating a final lesion dimension of 3 mm depth \u00d7 3 mm width (\nFig. 1B\n). The wire was raised through the cord with the arc extended. Downward pressure was applied to the arc using a suction tip, thereby transecting all structures within the arc. Muscle and skin layers were sutured in layers. Post-operatively, the monkeys were provided analgesics routinely for 3\u20135 days and antibiotics for 5\u20137 days. All subjects retained bowel and bladder function following the lesion. This right-sided T10 spinal cord lesion transects approximately 90% of CST axons originating from the left motor cortex and 8% of CST axons originating from the right cortex (\nFig. 1A\n) (\nLacroix et al., 2004\n;\nRosenzweig et al., 2009\n), but spares ventral CST axons on the right side of the spinal cord that originate from the right motor cortex. Nissl stained sections indicate that the lesion is contained entirely within the dorsal quadrant, sparing the ventral funiculus (\nFig. 1\n). C7 cervical lesions were placed identically on the right side of the spinal cord in two monkeys, but at the C7 rather than T10 level (\nRosenzweig et al., 2010\n).\n2.1.3. CST tract tracing\nImmediately or 2 months later, the corticospinal tract was anterogradely labeled as described previously (\nLacroix et al., 2004\n;\nRosenzweig et al., 2009\n;\nRosenzweig et al., 2010\n). Biotinylated dextran amine (BDA; 10% in NaCl; 10,000 molecular weight, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was injected into the right hemisphere to examine compensatory axonal responses to injury arising from neuronal cell bodies of the motor cortex primarily unaffected by the right-sided spinal cord lesion. 150 nl of the 10% BDA solution was injected at each site through a glass micropipette attached to a picospritzer. The medial/caudal boundary of the primary motor cortex was identified as the junction of the central sulcus with the inter-hemispheric fissure. The first tracer injection was placed 1 mm lateral to midline and 1 mm rostral to the central sulcus at 3 separate dorsal/ventral coordinates. The injections then proceeded linearly every 1 mm over 13 additional sites rostral to the central sulcus. Then a second and third row of injections were performed, each 1 mm lateral to each other. Three separate dorsal/ventral injections were made, which resulted in a total of 127 injection sites. These injection sites included areas of the motor cortex that innervate hand, trunk and foot areas. Each injection was made under microscopic guidance. Subjects survived an additional 6 weeks for cervical lesions or 3 months for thoracic lesions, to allow sufficient time for transport of BDA past the lesion into the cervical or lumbar enlargements, respectively (\nLacroix et al., 2004\n;\nRosenzweig et al., 2009\n;\nRosenzweig et al., 2010\n).\n2.1.4. Tissue processing and histology\nPrior to perfusion, monkeys were sedated with ketamine (25 mg/kg; IM) and deeply anesthetized with Nembutal (30 mg/kg; IP). Subjects were perfused transcardially for 1 h with a 4% solution of paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4C followed by 5% sucrose solution. Spinal cords were removed and placed in a glycerin cryoprotectant solution. For detection of BDA labeling, spinal cords were sectioned on a cryostat set at 40 \u03bcm intervals. Sections were washed in tris-buffered saline, pH 7.2 (TBS) and quenched in 0.6% H\n2\nO\n2\nin TBS for 30 min. Following TBS washes, sections were incubated in ABC Elite reagent (1:100, Vector Laboratories, CA) in TBS + 0.25% triton-x overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Following TBS washes, sections were reacted with 1.25 mg/ml DAB, 0.04% NiCl\n2\n, 0.012% H\n2\nO\n2\nin TBS. Sections were then washed in TBS, mounted on gelatin-subbed slides, air dried, dehydrated and coverslipped with Entellan (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA).\n2.1.5. CST axon quantification\nBDA-labeled axons were quantified within the contralateral dorsolateral tract (contralateral to the spinal cord lesion) using a stereological procedure, as described previously (\nRosenzweig et al., 2009\n). Briefly, quantification was performed on an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped with an Olympus OLY-200 video camera, a motorized stage (MAC2002-XYZ, Ludl Electronic Products, Hawthorn, NY) and Stereo-Investigator software (MicroBrightField, Colchester, VT). A 60 \u00d7 objective was used to count axons at 30\u201340 sampling sites (identified below) within a 50 \u00d7 50 \u03bcm square counting frame. To be counted an axon had to: 1) be clearly labeled; 2) pass through the plane of section; 3) have its profile on the upper face of the lesion within the inclusion zone. The estimated total number of axons was calculated by multiplying the number of axons counted by the inverse of the proportion of the area sampled (\nGundersen, 1986\n;\nPeterson, 1999\n;\nWest, 1993\n). In the ipsilateral ventromedial tract, all BDA-labeled axons of passage were counted. Axons were quantified in a total of 5 sections (0.5 mm apart) within the C5 and L4 levels for the T10 thoracic lesions and the C3 and C8 levels for the C7 cervical lesions.\n2.1.6. IBA-1 immunohistochemistiy\nFor detection of activated microglia within the monkey cortex, IBA-1 immunohistochemistry was performed. Forty-micron transverse sections through the monkey motor cortex were blocked with normal goat serum in TBS + 0.25% triton-x. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4C in blocking solution containing rabbit anti-IBA-1 (Wako; 1 \u03bcg/ml). Following washes in TBS, sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in blocking solution containing Alexa-594 conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Life Technologies; 1:500). Sections were washed in TBS, mounted on gelatin-subbed slides and coverslipped with Flouromount G. Images from 4 sections per subject were obtained using an Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 60 \u00d7 objective. Percent area occupied by IBA-1 immunolabeling was determined using Image J. Mean density per subject was calculated for each cortex.\n\n2.2. Experimental design, rodent study\nAs presented in Results, analysis of primate data indicated a 4-fold increase in the number of BDA-labeled ventral CST axons both above and below a spinal cord lesion. This increase was not seen when the motor cortex injections were delayed 2 months after the lesion surgery. To gain insight into the mechanism of such changes in axonal labeling we performed a similar experiment in rats.\nThe following groups were examined: Group 1, Intact (N = 6); Group 2, Bilateral C5 dorsal CST lesion + immediate motor cortex tracer injection (Lesion/No Delay Trace group; N = 6); Group 3, Bilateral C5 dorsal CST lesion + 2 week delayed motor cortex injection (Lesion/Delayed Trace; N = 6). In each case, the ventral CST was spared to enable compensatory sprouting to removal of the dorsal CST. Each rat received injections of two types of tracer: BDA and lentivirally-administered Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). BDA is actively transported in the axon (\nGlover et al., 1986\n;\nSchmued et al., 1990\n), whereas the GFP transport coefficient is consistent with diffusion, as determined by FRAP experiments (\nKonzack et al., 2007\n). In addition, we performed a time course study to estimate the rate of BDA transport when administered at the time of lesion or delayed. BDA was injected into the rat motor cortex immediately or delayed by 2 weeks and the animals were sacrificed 3 days (3-day group; N = 6) or 5 days (5-day group; N = 6) later. Spinal cord sections were then analyzed at identical distances from the obex/C1 interface. All procedures adhered to IACUC guidelines and animals had free access to food and water throughout the study.\n2.2.1. Detailed methods, rodent study\n2.2.1.1. Spinal cord lesion.\nAdult fisher 344 female rats (125\u2013150 g) were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (25 mg/ml), xylazine (1.3g/ml) and acepromazine (0.25 mg/ml). A laminectomy was performed at the C4 vertebral body corresponding to spinal level C5. A tungsten wire knife (Kopf) was stereotaxically lowered into the spinal cord 1.0 mm and extruded 3.0 mm to specifically transect the dorsal CST bilaterally (\nFig. 5\n). Following SCI, rats were given 0.5 mg/kg ampicillin and 1.1 mg/kg banamine. Rats displayed no obvious adverse affects post-lesion. This type of lesion transects the dorsal CST from both cortices, but spares the ventral CST from both cortices descending within the ventral funiculus (\nFig. 5\n).\n2.2.1.2. Production of lendviral vectors for \u201cpassive\u201d CST tract tracing.\nLentiviral vectors were constructed as previously described (\nBlesch, 2004\n). The complete enhanced GFP (GFP) cDNA plus Kozak consensus sequence was cloned into the\nBam\nH1 and\nEco\nR1 sites of the vector pENTR (Invitrogen) that was recombined into a lentiviral vector driven by the cytomegalovirus/beta-actin hybrid promoter (\nNiwa et al., 1991\n). High titer stocks of lentivirus were prepared by ultracentrifugation and titers were determined by infection of HEK293T cells. In addition, vector stocks were assayed for p24 antigen levels using a HIV-1 p24-specific ELISA kit (DuPont), as previously described (\nNaldini et al., 1996\n). Lenti-GFP vector preparations contained 106 \u03bcg/ml p24 and 1 \u00d7 10^8 IU/ml.\n2.2.1.3. CST tract tracing with BDA or GFP.\nImmediately or 14 days following bilateral cervical dorsal column lesions, a craniotomy was performed to expose the right motor cortex. A 10% solution of 10,000 molecular weight lysine-fixable biotinylated dextran-amine (BDA) was prepared by re-suspending 5 mg BDA in 50 \u03bcl of 1 \u00d7 10\n8\nIU/ml GFP expressing lentivirus. To label CST axons by active (BDA) and passive (GFP) transport, the BDA/lentivirus-GFP mixture was injected into 18 sites spanning the hindlimb motor cortex, as described previously (\nWeidner et al., 2001\n). Injection coordinates were rostral/caudal: every 0.05 cm; Bregma +0.10 to \u22120.30 cm and medial/lateral: Bregma \u22120.25 cm and \u22120.35 cm. The volume per site was 300 nl. injected with a picospritzer at a rate of 1 \u03bcl/min. Animals (N = 6/group) were sacrificed 3, 5, or 24 days after tracing.\n2.2.1.4. Tissue preparation, immunohistochemistry and axonal quantification.\nRats were deeply anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 250 ml of 4% PFA. Spinal cord and brain tissue was post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose 2\u20133 days at 4 \u00b0C. Spinal cords were blocked in the coronal plane and sectioned on a freezing microtome set at 40 \u03bcm intervals. Serial sections were collected into cryoprotectant and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. Spinal cord sections were immunolabeled for BDA, described above, or for GFP. For GFP labeling, sections were quenched in 0.6% H\n2\nO\n2\nin TBS, then blocked in 5% normal goat serum in TBS + 0.25% triton. Sections were incubated in rabbit anti-GFP (0.1 \u03bcg/ml, Life Technologies) overnight at 4 \u00b0C, washed in TBS, incubated in goat anti-rabbit Poly HRP (1:10, Millipore) for 1 h at room temperature and developed with DAB + NiCl\n2\nas per BDA staining. BDA and GFP-labeled axons were quantified within the dorsal columns above the lesion at cervical C3 segment (4 sections per animal) using the same stereological methods stated in the primate methods section. For quantification of the ventral CST, every BDA and GFP-labeled axon was counted above the lesion at C3 and below the lesion at cervical C6 spinal segment (4 sections per level per animal).\n2.2.1.5. BDA uptake quantification.\nTo estimate the number of BDA-labeled neuronal cell bodies within the cortex, a 200 \u03bcm \u00d7 200 \u03bcm box was placed within layer V in the path of the injection tract or immediately adjacent to the injection tract. Every BDA-labeled cell body was counted in a series of 6 sections spanning the cortical injection coordinates.\n2.2.1.6. Time course of axonal growth.\nTo access the rate of BDA transport, animals (N = 6/group for each of Intact group, Delay Group, and No Delay group) were sacrificed at 3 or 5 days post-cortical injections. 40 \u03bcm serial transverse sections were obtained from the obex/C 1 spinal border to 5 mm caudal and labeled for BDA. Every 0.5 mm (3-day survival) or 1.0 mm (5-day survival) the total number BDA-labeled axons were counted within the ventral CST tract. Mean numbers of ventral CST axons within each group at each level were plotted using Prism 5 software. For qualitative visualization of BDA-labeled axons (\nFig. 10 A\n\u2013C), a separate set of animals was used (N = 3/group). 30 \u03bcm serial sagittal sections were labeled for BDA. The entire extent of each axon was traced using Neurolucida software for each adjacent section. Traces from adjacent sections were then superimposed using Adobe Illustrator software.\nFig. 10.\nOpen in a new tab\nCortical uptake of BDA is consistent.

    "Methods": "PTEN deletion in the motor cortex of adult mice\nThe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of California, Irvine approved all experimental procedures. Doubly transgenic mice were generated by breeding mice with lox-P flanked exon 5 of the\nPTEN\ngene (RRID: IMSR_JAX:004597) to mice with a lox-P flanked STOP cassette in the ROSA locus that prevents expression of tandem dimer tomato (tdTomato) fluorescent protein (RRID: IMSR_JAC:007905). We will refer to these mice as PTEN/tdT mice for brevity. Transgenic control mice harbor only the lox-P flanked STOP cassette within the ROSA locus that prevents tdTomato expression (referred to hereafter as tdT mice).\nTable 1\nsummarizes the number of mice used for each assessment.\nTable 1.\nMice used for cell body size measurements and unilateral behavior assessment.\nMonths Post AAV-Cre\n# PTEN/tdT mice\n# tdT mice\n# Injected with Fluorogold\n# Used in behavior at 6 months post-deletion\n3\nn=6\nn=2\nn=8\nn=0\n4\nn=5\nn=0\nn=5\nn=0\n5\nn=5\nn=0\nn=5\nn=0\n6\nn=3\nn=2\nn=5\nn=0\n7\nn=4\nn=0\nn=4\nn=4 PTEN/tdT\n8\nn=3\nn=0\nn=3\nn=3 PTEN/tdT\n9\nn=6\nn=0\nn=8\nn=4 PTEN/tdT\n12\nn=5\nn=2\nn=6\nn=4 PTEN/tdT\n15\nn=3\nn=2\nn=5\nn=3 PTEN/tdT\nOpen in a new tab\n\nSurgical procedures\nFor all surgical procedures, mice were anesthetized with Isoflurane (2\u20133%), their eyes were swabbed with Vaseline, and the skin at the incision site was shaved and cleaned with Betadine. Following completion of the surgery, mice were returned to their home cages on 37\u00b0C water circulating heating pads until they recovered from the anesthetic.\nTo delete\nPTEN\nin adult cortical neurons, PTEN/tdT mice (n=26) received unilateral intracortical injections of AAV-Cre recombinase at 8 or more weeks of age. Transfection by AAV-Cre results in the excision of exon 5 of the\nPTEN\ngene and the STOP cassette for tdTomato, resulting in deletion of\nPTEN\nand expression of tdTomato in the same neurons. To control for any effect due to AAV injections, tdT control mice received identical unilateral injections of AAV-Cre. The vectors were AAV serotype 2, and were obtained from Vector Bio Labs (1 \u00d7 10\n13\ngenome copies/mL, Catalog number 7011). The vector was diluted with sterile-filtered PBS and 5% glycerol for a final concentration of 1 \u00d7 10\n12\ngenome copies/mL.\nFor intracranial injections, a midline scalp incision was made. Burr holes were placed in the skull overlying the cortical areas to be injected and 4 unilateral intracortical injections of AAV-Cre were made into the sensorimotor cortex using a Hamilton syringe with a pulled glass micropipette (1.0mm lateral and 0.5mm depth at +0.5mm, \u22120.2mm, \u22120.5mm, and \u22121.0mm relative to bregma). Each injection was 0.6\u03bcl in volume, for a total injection volume of 2.4\u03bcl. Injections were performed over one minute and the microsyringe was left in place for three minutes.\n\nRetrograde labeling of cortical motoneurons\nTo definitively identify the cells of origin of corticospinal tract axons (cortical motoneurons), PTEN/tdT (n= 26) and tdT mice (n=10) mice received bilateral intraspinal injections of the retrograde tracer Fluorogold 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, and 15 months following AAV-Cre injections. Mice were prepared for surgery as above, and a C5 laminectomy was performed to expose the spinal cord. Two injections of 0.2\u03bcl of 1% Fluorogold were made with a Hamilton syringe with a pulled glass micropipette at 0.5mm lateral to the midline at 0.5mm depth. Fluorogold was injected over one minute and the syringe was left in place for an additional minute. After completing the injections, the muscles were sutured with 5.0 chromic gut and the skin was closed with staples. Mice received subcutaneous injections of buprenorphine, Baytril and lactated Ringer\u2019s twice a day for three days post-operatively and were kept in their home cages for 3\u20134 days prior to tissue collection.\n\nTissue collection and histology\n3\u20134 days after receiving Fluorogold injections, mice received intraperitoneal injections of Fatal-Plus (1mL/300g) and were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains and spinal cords were dissected and allowed to postfix for 48 hours in 4% PFA before being placed overnight in 30% sucrose/phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for cryoprotection. For Vibratome sectioning, tissue blocks were attached to blocks with cyanoacrylate and sectioned at 200\u03bcm or 40\u03bcm. Sections were collected in serial order in wells containing PBS with 0.1% NaN3. Tissue sectioned on the cryostat was embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek) and frozen by immersion in a container with methyl butane surrounded by crushed dry ice/ethanol slurry. Brains were sectioned in the coronal plane at 20\u03bcm and collected in wells with PBS with 0.1% NaN3.\nTo visualize neurons co-labeled with tdTomato and Fluorogold, tdTomato fluorescence was visualized directly without immunostaining. To visualize Fluorogold, 20\u201340\u03bcm sections were incubated overnight at room temperature with rabbit anti-Fluorogold (RRID: AB_2314407) diluted to 1:600 in 5% NDS, 5% BSA, 0.4% triton-X in 50mM KPBS. Sections were then incubated with an anti-rabbit biotinylated secondary antibody (1:250, RRID: AB_2313606), followed by incubation in avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (1:100, RRID: AB_2336819), and FITC labeling (made in house, 1:250 dilution in 0.001%H202 borate buffer). Stained sections were slide mounted and cover slipped with Vectashield mounting medium (RRID: AB_2336789).\nSections (one every 200\u03bcm) were stained for H&E or cresyl violet, and/or immunostained for different markers (below). For immunostains other than Fluorogold, an antigen retrieval protocol was used in which sections were placed in 1.7ml Eppendorf tubes with 1mL 10mM citrate buffer, pH 8.80. Tubes were then immersed in boiling water for 5 minutes, placed on ice for 5 minutes, and left at room temperature for 10 minutes. Primary antibodies and dilutions were as follows: PTEN (1:250, AB_390810), two phospho-specific antibodies for ribosomal protein S6 (1:250 for both, Ser 235/236: RRID: AB_916156, Ser 240/244: RRID: AB_331682), and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP, 1:2000, RRID: AB_100013482). PTEN and pS6 antibodies were diluted in Blocking Reagent (PerkinElmer), all other antibodies were diluted in 5% secondary antibody host serum in TBS or PBS with 0.3% Triton (GFAP).\nSections were incubated in primary antibody overnight at room temperature, and then in secondary antibodies in the same blocking solution for two hours at room temperature. For immunofluorescence, we used Alexa Fluor 488 (RRID: AB_2535792) or Alexa Fluor 594 (RRID: AB_141637), both at 1:250 dilution. For sections undergoing DAB detection, sections were incubated in a biotinylated IgG secondary antibody (1:250, RRID: AB_2313606), washed 3 times, incubated for 1 hour with avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (1:100, RRID: AB_2336819) and reacted with DAB (RRID: AB_2336382).\n\nCortical motoneuron cell size measurements\nTo measure the cell body size of CMNs over time following\nPTEN\ndeletion in adulthood, we used the data from a previously conducted pilot experiment in a power/sample size calculation to determine the minimum number of mice that could be used for each time point. Each time point used for cell body size measurements had a minimum of 3 PTEN/tdT mice (3 months: n=4, 2 females, 2 males, 4 months: n=3, 0 females, 3 males, 5 months: n=4, 2 females, 2 males, 6 months: n=3, 3 females, 0 males, 7 months: n=3, 0 females, 3 males, 9 months: n= 3, 0 females, 3 males, 12 months: n= 3, 0 females, 3 males, 15 months: n=3, 3 females, 0 males). Two tdT control mice were used for cell size measurement at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 month time points (3 month: 2 females, 0 males, 6 months: 1 female, 1 male, 9 months: 0 females, 2 males, 12 months: 1 female, 1 male, 15 months: 2 females, 0 males). For the mid-life\nPTEN\ndeletion analyses, 3 PTEN/tdT mice (1 female, 2 males) were assessed at 2 months post-deletion and 5 PTEN/tdT mice (2 females, 2 males) were assessed at 5 months post-deletion. A random number generator was used to determine surgical order and to assign mice to groups.\nCortical motoneurons (CMNs) were identified by retrograde labeling with Fluorogold and\nPTEN\ndeleted neurons were identified by their expression of tdTomato. Neurons co-labeled by both Fluorogold and tdTomato must therefore be\nPTEN\ndeleted CMNs. For cell size measurements, sections that were immunostained for Fluorogold were imaged by 2-photon microscopy for both Fluorogold and tdTomato. The cortical region containing the highest density of neurons co-labeled with tdTomato and Fluorogold was identified, and image stacks were collected (1024 by 1024\u03bcm, depth of 20\u201340\u03bcm, step distance 0.5\u03bcm). Image stacks of the same size were collected from the homotopic region of the contralateral cortex containing CMNs labeled with FG only. Image stacks were reconstructed in 3D and 2-dimensional projections were generated from the 3D image stacks, and analyzed in ImageJ.\nWe measured the cross-sectional area of 50\nPTEN\ndeleted, Fluorogold positive CMNs in the area of deletion. Sampling was done by measuring all colabeled cells starting at the lateral aspect of the motor cortex and moving medially, until 50 colabeled cells had been measured. As an intra-animal control, we then measured 50 Fluorogold positive (\nPTEN\nintact) CMNs in the homotopic cortical region on the contralateral side of the same section using the same lateral-medial sampling strategy. To control for possible effects of transfection by AAV-Cre and tdTomato expression on cell size, we performed identical analyses in tdT mice with intact\nPTEN\nexpression, measuring 50 tdTomato/Fluorogold positive CMNs vs. 50 Fluorogold positive CMNs on the contralateral side. All measurements were done blind to mouse genotype, however the large effect of\nPTEN\ndeletion on cell size made it difficult for the person conducting the analysis to remain blind.\nThe average values per mouse were then averaged across mice in the time point, in order to calculate the overall mean cross-sectional area for the\nPTEN\ndeletion and control groups at each time point with n=number of mice. Measures of cell body size were analyzed using repeated measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and comparisons of cell size between time points were done using Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons post-hoc analysis. Since there were no significant differences between the intra-animal controls and the AAV injection control mice, statistics are reported using only the intra-animal controls.\n\nCharacterization of dendritic arbor\nTo assess the dendritic arbor of pyramidal neurons following adult\nPTEN\ndeletion, mice that had received AAV-Cre injections only were euthanized 6 months (n= 6 PTEN/tdT mice, 4 tdT mice) and 12 months (n= 7 PTEN/tdT mice, 6 tdT mice) post-deletion. These time points were chosen because of the continuing growth of CMN cell bodies we observed from 6\u201312 months. Mice received injections of Fatal Plus as above, were perfused transcardially with 4% PFA, and brains were post-fixed for 48 hours in 4% PFA. The unfrozen brains were adhered to a block with cyanoacrylate and sectioned on a Vibratome into 200\u03bcm sections that were collected in PBS with 0.1% NaN3.\nSections used for 3D imaging were cleared using a passive CLARITY protocol. On day 1, sections were incubated in 4% acrylamide PBS with 0.25% VA-044 thermal initiator at 4\u00b0C for 48 hours. The sections were then transferred to a 37\u00b0C oven to allow the acrylamide to polymerize. Once polymerized, the sections were washed in PBS for 30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature and then were placed in 25mM borate 500mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) overnight at 37\u00b0C. The following day, sections were transferred to fresh borate SDS solution and left at 37\u00b0C overnight, and this was repeated on the next day. After three nights in borate SDS solution, the sections were washed 4 times in PBS over an 8-hour span at room temperature and were then submerged in Sorbitol F overnight at room temperature. Sections were then mounted and cover slipped with Sorbitol F for imaging.\n\n3D Imaging and Sholl Analysis\nCleared, thick sections were imaged in 3D using a 3i video-rate two-photon laser scanning microscope on the Olympus BX51WIF platform (Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA) equipped with a Chameleon Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA). The laser beam is focused through a 20X water-immersion objective (numerical aperture 0.95) and emitted fluorescence is detected by photomultipliers (Hamamatsu, Middlesex, NJ) to derive a video signal that is captured and analyzed using SlideBook 6.0 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Santa Monica, CA).\ntdTomato labeled neurons were selected for imaging based on the following criteria: 1) Neuron had pyramid-shaped soma; 2) Neuron was located near the middle of the section, and not close to a section edge, to avoid asymmetric truncation of dendrites; 3) Neuron was isolated in the field of view, or surrounded by only a few other labeled neurons, such that individual dendritic processes could be unequivocally attributed to the correct neuron. Image stacks were collected (1024 by 1024\u03bcm, scan depth of 150\u2013200\u03bcm, step distance 1.0 \u03bcm), and reconstructed in 3D. Stacks were collapsed into 2D images and the dendritic arbor of individual neurons was manually traced.\nTraced projections were imported into FIJI, converted to 8-bit binary images, and analyzed using the Sholl Analysis program (\nFerreira et al., 2014\n). Using the center of the soma, concentric circles with an increasing diameter of 10\u03bcm were placed on each traced projection, and the number of intersections at each circle was counted. The cross-sectional area of neurons used for Sholl analysis was measured by manually tracing the cell body of the flattened 2D projection in FIJI. The diameter of the apical dendrite was measured 30 \u03bcm away from the center of the soma in the flattened 2D projection.\nFor Sholl analysis data, neurons were analyzed based on time post-AAV injection, either 6 or 12 months (\nTable 2\n). For the 6 month time point, 6 PTEN/tdT mice (3 females, 3 males) and 4 tdT mice (3 females, 1 male) were used. For the 12 month time point 7 PTEN/tdT mice (4 females, 3 males) and 6 tdT mice (4 females, 2 males) were used.\nTable 2\nsummarizes the number of cells that were analyzed from each mouse. The raw intersection data was analyzed using repeated measures two-way ANOVA, and post-hoc comparisons were done using Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons post-test.\nTable 2.\nSummary of mice used for Sholl analysis.\nMouse\nTime point\nAge\nGroup\nGenotype\nSex\n# of cells\nTotal cells\n1\n6 months\n8 months\nPTEN\ndeletion\nPTEN/tdT\nM\n1\n2\n6 months\n8 months\nPTEN\ndeletion\nPTEN/tdT\nM\n5\n3\n6 months\n8 months\nPTEN\ndeletion\nPTEN/tdT\nM\n1\n4\n6 months\n8 months\nPTEN\ndeletion\nPTEN/tdT\nF\n3\n5\n6 months\n8 months\nPTEN\ndeletion\nPTEN/tdT\nF\n1\n6\n6 months\n8 months\nPTEN\ndeletion\nPTEN/tdT\nF\n1\nn= 12\n1\n6 months\n8 months\nControl\ntdT\nM\n4\n2\n6 months\n8 months\nControl\ntdT\nF\n1\n3\n6 months\n8 months\nControl\ntdT\nF\n3\n4\n6 months\n8 months\nControl\ntdT\nF\n3\nn= 11\n1\n12 months\n14 months\nPTEN\ndeletion\nPTEN/tdT\nM\n7\n2\n12 months\n14 months\nPTEN\ndeletion\nPTEN/tdT\nM\n5\n3\n12 months\n14 months\nPTEN\ndeletion\nPTEN/tdT\nM\n4\n4\n12 months\n14 months\nPTEN\ndeletion\nPTEN/tdT\nF\n4\n5\n12 months\n14 months\nPTEN\ndeletion\nPTEN/tdT\nF\n4\n6\n12 months\n14 months\nPTEN\ndeletion\nPTEN/tdT\nF\n6\n7\n12 months\n14 months\nPTEN\ndeletion\nPTEN/tdT\nF\n11\nn= 41\n1\n12 months\n14 months\nControl\ntdT\nF\n1\n2\n12 months\n14 months\nControl\ntdT\nF\n6\n3\n12 months\n14 months\nControl\ntdT\nF\n2\n4\n12 months\n14 months\nControl\ntdT\nF\n4\n5\n12 months\n14 months\nControl\ntdT\nM\n5\n6\n12 months\n14 months\nControl\ntdT\nM\n5\nn= 23\nOpen in a new tab\n\nMeasurement of axon size in the medullary pyramids\nTo assess the effect of\nPTEN\ndeletion on the size of uninjured corticospinal (CST) tract axons, we examined CST axons in the medullary pyramids. PTEN/tdT (n= 3) and tdT mice (n=2) mice that had received unilateral AAV-Cre injections were perfused with 2% glutaraldehyde 2% paraformaldehyde. Brains and spinal cords were dissected and allowed to post-fix for 48 hours in 2% glutaraldehyde 2% paraformaldehyde. Tissue was then sunk in 30% sucrose PBS overnight before being cut into thick 200\u03bcm sections on a Vibratome. Brainstem sections containing the medullary brainstem were collected and immunostained for tdTomato using an antigen retrieval protocol wherein sections were submerged in centrifuge tubes with ~1 mL 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 8.5\u20139) and placed in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes. The tubes were then placed on ice for 5 minutes and left to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. Sections were then incubated with anti-red fluorescent protein (anti-RFP) primary antibody (1:200, RRID: AB_2209751) diluted in 5% NDS and 0.4% Triton in TBS overnight at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (1:250, RRID: AB_2340590) diluted in the same solution as the primary and were then reacted with DAB (RRID: AB_2336382). Following immunostaining, sections were trimmed to isolate the medullary pyramids, stained with Toluidine blue, and processed for electron microscopy (EM).\nSections were scanned at the EM level at low magnification to identify all tdT-labeled axons, and images were taken (185\u03bcm\n2\n) of all labeled axons. Images collected by EM were overlaid with a 4\u03bcm grid and analyzed in ImageJ. All tdTomato positive axons were measured (26 axons in 1 female and 18 and 25 axons in 2 male PTEN/tdT mice; 16 and 31 axons in two female tdT mice), along with neighboring unlabeled axons in the field that were intersected by a grid crosshair. The cross-sectional area of the axoplasm, axoplasm plus myelin, and myelin alone were measured. G-ratio was calculated as the ratio of the diameter of the axoplasm/the diameter of the axoplasm plus myelin. Data were compared across groups using repeated measures two-way ANOVA, and Sidak\u2019s post-test. Differences in G-ratio were analyzed using student\u2019s t-test.\n\nFunctional testing following unilateral PTEN deletion\nFor functional testing, we first tested mice that had received unilateral injections of AAV-Cre at 8 weeks of age (PTEN/tdT; n=18 and tdT; n=16). The unilateral injection model allowed separate assessment of limbs controlled by the cortex in which\nPTEN\nhad been deleted vs. the contralateral cortex with intact PTEN expression. At 6 months post-\nPTEN\ndeletion, motor function was tested using a rotarod and cylinder task.\nRotarod testing was done in a way that allowed assessment of motor learning and performance ability (\nRothwell et al., 2014\n). Overall testing consisted of three trials a day over 4 consecutive days, for a total of 12 trials. All testing was done at night based on performance by age-matched controls in pilot studies. The first two days of testing involved slower rotation speeds and were thus less challenging than the third and fourth days. Briefly, on days 1 and 2 the mice were placed on the rod with an initial speed of 4 RPM with an acceleration of 0.1 RPM/s. On days 3 and 4 the initial speed was increased to 6 RPM with an acceleration of 0.2 RPM/s. Each trial was a maximum of 5 minutes and ended if a mouse fell off of the rod. Latency to fall was recorded and the maximum attained speed was calculated for each trial.\nPerformance on the rotarod was compared by taking the latency to fall for each mouse and calculating the speed at which the mouse fell off the rod (latency to fall * acceleration + starting speed) and averaging this value for each trial based on group (control vs.\nPTEN\ndeletion). The average speed for each trial was then compared between groups using two-way ANOVA. Baseline coordination and motor learning were calculated using linear regression analysis (\nRothwell et al., 2014\n).\nThe same mice were assessed using the cylinder task. Testing for each task was done on non-consecutive days to avoid fatigue. The cylinder task quantifies the preference of forelimb use during spontaneous exploration and was done once at 6 months following unilateral AAV-Cre injection. The cylinder task was conducted in a completely dark room lit by a red lamp. A 1000mL beaker was placed on a flat surface with the mouth of the beaker open to the environment. A small amount of bedding from the home cage was placed at the bottom of the beaker. A single mouse was then placed in the beaker and videotaped from above for analysis. Forepaw sidedness was recorded each time the mouse reared up and placed one or both forepaws on the walls of the beaker to support body weight. Touches were recorded as R (right forepaw, controlled by the left motor cortex with\nPTEN\ndeletion, L (left forepaw, controlled by the right motor cortex and no\nPTEN\ndeletion), or B (both forepaws simultaneously). A total of 10 weight-bearing touches were recorded per mouse with the requirement that the mouse had to place both forepaws on the bottom of the beaker between successful paw touches. The recorded percentage of forepaw touches executed by each forepaw (or both) was then used to determine forelimb use asymmetry.\nPerformance in the cylinder task was measured by taking the raw count of forepaw touch sidedness (out of ten total touches), and comparing forepaw touches between groups (control vs.\nPTEN\ndeletion) by repeated measures two-way ANOVA. Sidak\u2019s post-test was used to identify asymmetry in forepaw usage (right forepaw vs. left forepaw vs. both forepaws).\n\nAssessment of motor function over time following bilateral PTEN deletion\nBased on our behavioral findings following unilateral\nPTEN\ndeletion in neonatal mice (\nGutilla et al., 2016\n) and the bimanual nature of the rotarod task, we assessed performance on the rotarod and in the cylinder task following bilateral\nPTEN\ndeletion in the motor cortex. 10 PTEN/tdT mice and 9 age-matched tdT control mice received bilateral intracortical injections of AAV-Cre at 8 weeks of age as above (total injection volume of 2.4\u03bcl/side).\nPTEN/tdT and tdT mice that received bilateral AAV-Cre injections were assessed for motor learning on the rotarod at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months following bilateral AAV-Cre injection as described for mice following unilateral\nPTEN\ndeletion. The same person carried out the testing for each session and was blind to the genotype of the mice. At 8 months following AAV-Cre injection, interim statistical analyses were performed to determine whether to continue behavioral testing. Based on rotarod performance trends from 2\u20138 months following injection, we assessed rotarod performance at 10 months following injection in order to evaluate the stability of our observed trend.\nThe same mice were assessed using the cylinder task at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months following\nPTEN\ndeletion as described for mice following unilateral\nPTEN\ndeletion. Testing for each task was on non-consecutive days to avoid fatigue and was conducted by the same person each time who was blind to genotype. Interim statistical analyses at 8 months following AAV-Cre injection did not reveal a trend, so mice were not tested in the cylinder task at 10 months."

These mice were backcrossed from a C57/BL6 background into a CD1 background.\nNrg4\n+/\u2212\nmice were crossed to generate\nNrg4\n+/+\nand\nNrg4\n\u2212/\u2212\nlittermates.\n\n2.2. Neuron culture\nPrimary cortical neurons were prepared from E16 embryos. The protocol for culturing hippocampal pyramidal neurons was used with modifications (\nKaech and Banker, 2006\n). Briefly, dissected cortices were mechanically triturated in Neurobasal A medium supplemented with 2% B27 (Gibco), 0.5\u00a0mM GlutaMAX 1, 100\u00a0units/ml penicillin and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). 15,000 cells/cm\n2\nwere plated on poly-\nl\n-Lysine (Sigma)-coated 35\u00a0mm dishes and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO\n2\n. In some cultures, the culture medium was supplemented with 100\u00a0ng/ml recombinant NRG4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) after plating. Neurons were cultured for either 3 or 9\u00a0days\nin vitro\n. Neurons were fluorescently labelled in 3\u00a0day cultures by treating the cultures with the fluorescent dye calcein-AM (2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, Invitrogen) for 15\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. In 9\u00a0days cultures, the neurite arbors of a subset of the neurons were visualized by transfecting the neurons with a GFP expression plasmid using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) after 7\u00a0days\nin vitro\n. Briefly, 1\u00a0\u03bcg of DNA was mixed with 2\u00a0\u03bcl of lipofectamine. After 20\u00a0min, this mixture in 2\u00a0ml of Opti-MEM media (Gibco) was added to the cultures. After 3\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, the cultures were washed with culture medium and incubated for a further 2\u00a0days. At the end of the experiment, the neurons were fixed for 30\u00a0min with 4% paraformaldehyde. Images of fluorescent-labelled neurons were acquired with an Axiovert 200 Zeiss fluorescent microscope. Neurite length and Sholl analysis were carried out using Fiji (ImageJ) software with the semi-automated plugin Simple Neurite Tracer (\nLongair et al., 2011\n).\n\n2.3. Immunohistochemistry\nBrains were fixed overnight using 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.12\u00a0M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, washed in PBS and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose before being frozen in dry ice-cooled isopentane. Serial 30\u00a0\u03bcm sections were blocked in 1% BSA (Sigma), 0.1% Triton (Sigma) in PBS and then incubated with 1:500 anti-MAP2 (Millipore) and anti-NRG4 (Abcam) antibodies at 4\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. After washing, the sections were incubated with 1:500 rabbit polyclonal Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Sections were washed, incubated with DAPI and visualized using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope.\n\n2.4. Immunocytochemistry\nNeurons were fixed for 10\u00a0mins in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.12\u00a0M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), washed 3 times in PBS and blocked in 1% BSA (Sigma), 0.1% Triton (Sigma) in PBS for 1\u00a0h, then incubated with primary antibodies (1:50) against NRG4 (Santa Cruz), ErbB4 (Abcam), Emx1 (Santa Cruz) overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After washing, the neurons were incubated with polyclonal Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) 1:500 for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Cells were then washed, incubated with DAPI (1:8000) and visualized using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope.\n\n2.5. Quantitative PCR\nThe levels of\nNrg4\nmRNA was quantified by RT-qPCR relative to a geometric mean of mRNAs for the house keeping enzymes glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (\nGapdh\n), succinate dehydrogenase (\nSdha\n) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-1 (\nHprt1\n). Total RNA was extracted from dissected tissues with the RNeasy Mini Lipid extraction kit (Qiagen, Crawely, UK). 5\u00a0\u03bcl total RNA was reverse transcribed, for 1\u00a0h at 45\u00a0\u00b0C, using the Affinity Script kit (Agilent, Berkshire, UK) in a 25\u00a0\u03bcl reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2\u00a0\u03bcl of cDNA was amplified in a 20\u00a0\u03bcl reaction volume using Brilliant III ultrafast qPCR master mix reagents (Agilent Technologies). PCR products were detected using dual-labelled (FAM/BHQ1) hybridization probes specific to each of the cDNAs (MWG/Eurofins, Ebersberg, Germany). The PCR primers were:\nNrg4\nforward: 5\u2032-GAG ACA AAC AAT ACC AGA AC-3\u2032 and reverse: 5\u2032-GGA CTG CCA TAG AAA TGA-3\u2032;\nErbB4\nforward: 5\u2032-GGC AAT ATC TAC ATC ACT G-3\u2032 and reverse: 5\u2032-CCA ACA ACC ATC ATT TGA A-3\u2032;\nGapdh\nforward: 5\u2032-GAG AAA CCT GCC AAG TAT G-3\u2032 and reverse: 5\u2032-GGA GTT GCT GTT GAA GTC-3\u2032;\nSdha\nforward: 5\u2032-GGA ACA CTC CAA AAA CAG-3\u2032 and reverse: 5\u2032-CCA CAG CAT CAA ATT CAT-3\u2032;\nHprt1\nforward: 5\u2032-TTA AGC AGT ACA GCC CCA AAA TG-3\u2032 and reverse: 5\u2032-AAG TCT GGC CTG TAT CCA ACA C-3\u2032. Dual-labelled probes were:\nNrg4\n: 5\u2032-FAM-CGT CAC AGC CAC AGA GAA CAC-BHQ1\u20133\u2032;\nErbB4\n: 5\u2032-FAM-AGC AAC CTG TGT TAT TAC CAT ACC ATT-BHQ1\u20133\u2032;\nGapdh\n: 5\u2032-FAM-AGA CAA CCT GGT CCT CAG TGT-BHQ1\u20133;\nSdha\n: 5\u2032-FAM-CCT GCG GCT TTC ACT TCT CT-BHQ1\u20133,\nHrpt1\n: 5\u2032-FAM-TCG AGA GGT CCT TTT CAC CAG CAA G-BHQ1\u20133\u2032. Forward and reverse primers were used at a concentration of 250\u00a0nM and dual-labelled probes were used at a concentration of 500\u00a0nM. PCR was performed using the Mx3000P platform (Agilent) using the following conditions: 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0min followed by 45\u00a0cycles of 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0s and 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 35\u00a0s. Standard curves were generated for each cDNA for every real time PCR run, by using serial threefold dilutions of reverse transcribed adult mouse brain total RNA (Zyagen, San Diego, USA). Relative mRNA levels were quantified in whole brain, BAT and various brain regions dissected from at least 3 animals at each age. Primer and probe sequences were designed using Beacon Designer software (Premier Biosoft, Palo Alto, USA).\n\n2.6. Golgi staining\nModified Golgi-Cox impregnation of neurons was performed using the FD Rapid GolgiStain kit (FD NeuroTechnologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions on 150\u00a0\u03bcm transverse sections of P10, P30 and adult (P60 and P70) brains of\nNrg4\n+/+\nand\nNrg4\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice. Total dendrite length, branch point number and Sholl analysis was carried out separately on the apical and basal dendrite compartments of cortical pyramidal neurons of P10 and P30 littermates using the plugin Sholl Analysis of Fiji software (\nSchindelin et al., 2012\n) after neuronal reconstruction with the plugin Simple Neurite Tracer (\nLongair et al., 2011\n)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nFemale Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 grams were purchased from Taconic Farms. All animals were housed three animals per cage in temperature, humidity, and light controlled environments with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. Experimental procedures were approved by the Thomas Jefferson University IACUC and conducted in compliance with ARRIVE (\nAnimal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments\n) guidelines.\n\nC2 hemisection SCI\nRats were deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a cocktail of ketamine HCl (95.0mg/kg) (Vedco, Saint Joseph, Missouri), xylazine (10.0mg/kg) (Lloyd Laboratories, Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines) and acepromazine (0.075mg/kg) (Phoenix Pharm Inc, Burlingame, California). Once the rats were completely anesthetized, assessed via loss of toe pinch reflex and orbital reflex, the dorsal surface of the skin was shaved and disinfected with a 70% ethanol solution and topical iodine (Dynarex, Orangeburg, New York). Using a sterile #11 surgical blade (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, Pennsylvania). A one-inch midline incision was made on the dorsal surface of skin and muscle starting from the caudal portion of the occipital bone. Retractors were then used to expose the dorsal surface of the C2 and C3 vertebrae. Using rongeurs (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, California), remaining tissue was removed from the vertebrae and a laminectomy was performed to expose the spinal cord. The C2 and C3 dorsal roots were located, and a hemisection was performed at a location just caudal to the C2 root with a dissecting knife (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, California). To ensure a complete hemisection, a 30-gauge needle (BD Biosciences, San Jose, California) was passed through the injury several times. Following complete hemisection, the dorsal muscle layers were sutured with 4-0 silk sutures (Covidien, Minneapolis, Minnesota), and the skin was stapled closed with surgical staples (Braintree Scientific, Braintree, Massachusetts). The surface of the skin was treated with a topical iodine solution. Immediately following the procedure, rats were treated with 5mL subcutaneous injections of Lactated Ringer\u2019s solution (Hospira, San Jose, California), buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.05mg/kg) (Hospira, San Jose, California) and cefazolin (6 mg) (Hospira, San Jose, California). Rats were then placed in a clean cage on a surgical heating pad set to 37\u00b0C (Gaymar, Orchard Park, New York) and monitored until fully recovered from anesthesia. At both 12 and 24 hours after surgery, each rat was given an additional dose of buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.05mg/kg) and 5mL of Lactated Ringer\u2019s solution and monitored for pain/distress. Rats were subsequently monitored daily for pain, as well as for forepaw and hindpaw autophagy.\n\nrVRG injection\nRats were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine. Previous surgical staples were removed using a reflex clip remover. The skin was shaved and then disinfected with a 70% ethanol solution and topical iodine. Using a sterile #11 surgical blade, a half-inch incision was made on the dorsal surface of the skin at the occipital bone, and surgical scissors (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, California) were used to separate the superficial muscle, exposing the occipital bone and C1 vertebrae. The skin and muscles were separated with a surgical retractor (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, California), and using a surgical blade and rongeurs, the ligament between the occipital bone and the C1 vertebrae was excised followed by removal of the caudal portion of the occipital bone revealing the obex. The animals were then placed on a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, California). Using the obex as a starting point, the rVRG was located by the following coordinates: 2.0 mm lateral, 1.0 mm rostral, and 2.6 mm ventral. Once properly placed, an UltraMicroPump (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, Florida) injection system was used to inject 0.3 microliters of total volume using a microsyringe (Hamilton, Reno, Nevada) and a Micro4 Microsyringe Pump Controller (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, Florida). Immediately following injection, the needle was left in place for 5 minutes before being slowly removed from the medulla. The retractor was removed, the muscles were sutured with 4-0 silk sutures, and the skin was stapled closed and disinfected with topical iodine as described above. Rats were then placed in a clean cage and given post-operative treatment, as described above.\n\nDiaphragm injection\nRats were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine. Animals were placed supine, and a laparotomy was performed starting from the xyphoid process and cutting laterally just below the rib cage to expose the right hemi-diaphragm. Once exposed, Cholera Toxin Subunit B (CTB) Recombinant, Alexa Fluor 647 Conjugate (Life Technologies, Waltham, Massachusetts) was injected into the ventral, medial and dorsal portions of the hemi-diaphragm with 5 \u03bcl injected per site, specifically targeting the endplate band. Following injections, the muscles were sutured, and the skin was stapled closed. The surface of the skin was treated with a topical iodine solution. Rats were then treated with Lactated Ringer\u2019s solution, buprenorphine, and cefazolin and monitored daily for pain/distress, as described above.\n\nElectromyography (EMG) recordings\nAnimals were anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine as discussed above. Once deeply anesthetized, a laparotomy was performed to expose the right hemi-diaphragm similar to diaphragm injections. Bipolar electrodes spaced 3 mm apart were placed for recording in three separate sub-regions of the hemi-diaphragm: dorsal, medial, and ventral. Recordings were averaged over a five-minute time frame for each animal, and peak amplitude, burst duration and frequency were taken. Using LabChart 7 software (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, Colorado), the EMG signal was amplified and filtered through a band-pass filter (50-3000 Hz).\n\nCompound Muscle Action Potential (CMAP) recordings\nRats were anesthetized with isoflurane (Piramal Healthcare, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania) at a concentration of 3.0-3.5% diluted in oxygen. Animals were placed supine and the region just below the rib cage was shaved and cleaned with 70% ethanol. Phrenic nerve conduction studies were performed with stimulation at the neck via near nerve needle electrodes placed along the phrenic nerve. A reference electrode was placed on the shaved surface of the right costal region. The phrenic nerve was stimulated with a single burst at 6mV (amplitude) for a 0.5 millisecond duration. Each animal was stimulated between 10-20 times to ensure reproducibility, and recordings were averaged for analysis. ADI Powerlab8/30stimulator and BioAMPamplifier (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO) were used for both stimulation and recording, and Scope 3.5.6 software (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO) was used for subsequent data analysis. Following recordings, animals were immediately euthanized with a triple-dose of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine and tissue was collected (as described below).\n\nSpinal cord and brainstem dissection\nAnimals were euthanized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine. After the right hemi-diaphragm was excised, a small cut of right atrium was made to exsanguinate the animal. Next, a needle was placed into the left ventricle and a 0.9% saline solution (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) was perfused through to clear the animal. Once the animal was cleared of blood, a 4% paraformaldehyde solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, Pennsylvania) was perfused to fix the tissue. Following fixation, the spinal cord and brain were excised with rongeurs (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, California) and kept in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution overnight at 4\u00b0C. The following morning, samples were washed with a 0.1 M Phosphate Buffer solution (Sodium Phosphate Dibasic Heptahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and Sodium Monobasic Monohydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri)) for 24 hours. Samples were then placed in 30% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) for approximately 72 hours, samples were then submerged in an embedding mold (Polysciences Inc, Warrington, Pennsylvania) and covered with tissue freezing medium (General Data, Cincinnati, Ohio). Samples were then flash frozen in 2-methylbutane (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) chilled in dry ice. Tissue sections were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until sectioned on a cryostat (Thermo Scientific, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). Brainstem (transverse) and spinal cord (sagittal) sections were cut at 30 \u03bcm, placed on glass slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), dried overnight, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C for histological analysis.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nTissue sections were retrieved from \u221220\u00b0C freezer and dried for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by antigen retrieval using R&D Systems Protocol (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota). Immediately after antigen retrieval, slide edges were dried and a hydrophobic pen was used to surround the tissue sections (Newcomer Supply, Middleton, Wisconsin). A blocking/permeabilization step was conducted for 1 hour at room temperature with a solution of 5% Normal Horse Serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California), 0.2% Triton X-100 (Amresco, Solon, Ohio), diluted in PBS (primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in this solution as well). Tissue sections were then treated with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C with the following antibodies: Neuronal marker anti-NeuN at 1:200 (EMD-Millipore, Temecula, California), astrocyte marker anti-GFAP at 1:400 (Dako, Carpinteria, California), oligodendrocyte lineage marker anti-Olig-2 at 1:200 (EMD-Millipore, Temecula, California), anti-HA tag at 1:200 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri), anti-Phospho-S6 Ribosomal Protein (Ser235/236) at 1:50 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts), anti-wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) at 1:50 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California). On the following morning, samples were washed 3\u00d7 in PBS, and secondary antibody solutions were added for 1 hour at room temperature: donkey anti-rabbit IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor 647) at 1:200 (Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts), donkey anti-mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor 488) at 1:200 (Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts), Rhodamine (TRITC) AffiniPure donkey anti-goat IgG (H+L) at 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pennsylvania). Following secondary antibody treatment, samples were washed 3\u00d7 in PBS. 2\u20133 drops of FluorSave reagent (Calbiochem, San Diego, California) was added to tissue sections, and coverslips (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) were added. Slides were left to dry for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark and then kept at 4\u00b0C.\n\nSpinal cord histology\nTissue sections were retrieved from the \u221220\u00b0C freezer and dried at room temperature for 2 hours. Slides were then placed in 3-minute baths of xylene, 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 70% ethanol and dH\n2\nO. Slides were next placed in an ErioChrome solution (0.16% Eriochrome Cyanine, 0.4% Sulfuric Acid, 0.4% Ferric Chloride in dH\n2\nO) for 14 minutes, washed with tap water, placed in a developing solution (0.3% ammonium hydroxide in dH\n2\nO) for 5 minutes, washed with dH\n2\nO, and then placed into a cresyl violet solution (0.4% cresyl violet, 6% 1M sodium acetate, 34% 1M acetic acid) for 18 minutes. Finally, slides were placed in baths of dH\n2\nO, 70% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 100% ethanol and xylene. Slides were then mounted with poly-mount xylene (Polysciences, Warrington, Pennsylvania) and cover slips were added. Slides were then kept at room temperature for analysis.\n\npS6K70 immunofluorescence quantification\nTo determine activation of pS6K70, brainstem sections were immunostained with anti-Phospho-S6 Ribosomal Protein (Ser235/236) at 1:50 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts), followed by donkey anti-mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor 488) at 1:200 (Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts). Individual rVRG neurons were traced manually in ImageJ/Fiji software, using images captured via 20\u00d7 objective on a Zeiss Axio M2 Imager (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, New York). Mean intensity per cell was measured using ImageJ/Fiji software. Average background intensity values were subtracted from individual neurons to obtain each intensity value. Average neuronal intensities were recorded and resulting values were quantified using three images per animal; 4 and 5 animals used for AAV2-GFP and AAV2-cRheb, respectively.\n\nrVRG axon regeneration quantification\n30\u03bcm sagittal sections of spinal cord tissue were imaged with a Zeiss Axio M2 Imager (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thomwood, New York) to detect mCherry anterograde tracer expression. The high-magnification images were then optically \u201cstitched\u201d using Metamorph software to generate mosaics of the cervical spinal cord. The stitched images were rostral-caudally binned in 100\u03bcm segments using the rostral border of the injury and rostral intact spinal cord as the starting point. All mCherry-labeled axons were counted; axons that traversed through more than one bin were counted in all bins that they traversed.\n\nDiaphragm dissection\nAnimals were euthanized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine. Animals were placed supine; two incisions were made into the skin and underlying muscle starting from the xyphoid process and extending laterally along the rib cage to expose the right hemi-diaphragm. The right hemi-diaphragm was excised using spring scissors (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, California), stretched flat and pinned down on silicon-coated 10 cm dishes, and washed with PBS (Gibco, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). Next, a 20-minute fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, Pennsylvania) was performed, followed by several washes in PBS. After washing, superficial fascia was carefully removed from the surface of the diaphragm with Dumont #5 Forceps (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, California). Diaphragms were then stained for NMJ markers (described below).\n\nDiaphragm whole-mount histology\nFresh hemi-diaphragm muscle was dissected from each animal for whole-mount immunohistochemistry, as described previously (\nWright and Son, 2007\n). Diaphragms were rinsed 3\u00d7 in PBS and then incubated in 0.1 M glycine for 30 minutes. Following glycine incubation, \u03b1-bungarotoxin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555 at 1:200 (Life Technologies, Waltham, Massachusetts) was used to label post-synaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors for 15 minutes and then washed 3\u00d7 in PBS. Ice-cold methanol was then added to the diaphragms for 5 minutes and then washed 3\u00d7 in PBS. Diaphragms were then blocked for 1 hour at room temperature in a solution of 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS (this solution was used for both primary and secondary antibody dilutions). Primary antibodies were added overnight at 4\u00b0C: pre-synaptic vesicle marker anti-SV2 at 1:10 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, Iowa), neurofilament marker anti-SMI-312 at 1:1000 (Covance, Greenfield, Indiana). On the following morning, the diaphragms were washed 3\u00d7 in blocking solution, and secondary antibody solution was then added for 1 hour at room temperature: FITC anti-mouse IgG secondary (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA; 1:100), followed by washing 3\u00d7 in PBS. Diaphragms were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California), coverslips were added, and slides were stored at \u221220\u00b0C.\n\nNeuromuscular junction (NMJ) analysis\nLabeled muscles were analyzed for total numbers of NMJs and intact, partially-denervated or completely denervated NMJs. Whole-mounted diaphragms were imaged on a FluoView FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, Pennsylvania). We conducted NMJ analysis on only ipsilateral hemi-diaphragm because our previous published work showed no denervation or sprouting in contralateral hemi-diaphragm after cervical injury (\nNicaise et al., 2012a\n;\nNicaise et al., 2012b\n).\n\nStatistics\nData was expressed as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance was assessed by analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) and multiple comparisons\npost hoc\ntest. Graphpad Prism 6 (Graphpad Software Inc.) was used to calculate all analyses and\np\n< 0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations from the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Irvine.\n\nCortical cultures\nPrimary mixed cortical cultures were prepared as described previously (\nYin et al., 1994\n). Briefly, cell suspensions from neocortical regions of CD-1 mouse embryos (gender not determined) from 15\u201316 gestational day timed-pregnant mice (ordered from Charles River Crl:CD1[ICR]) were extracted and plated on astrocytic monolayers in glass-bottomed dishes, on culture treated 24 well microplates, or on Seahorse XF24 cell culture microplates. Cells were maintained in media consisting of Minimum Essential Medium (\nMEM\n) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, and 25 mM glucose, and kept in 37\u00b0C/5% CO\n2\nincubator. 2\u20133 days after dissection, the cultures were switched to an identical maintenance medium lacking fetal bovine serum and non-neuronal cell division halted by adding 10 \u03bcM cytosine arabinoside for 24 hrs. To prepare glial cultures (used to establish astrocytic monolayers described above), the same protocol was used, except the following: 1) tissues were obtained from 1\u20133 days old postnatal mice (gender not determined), 2) plating media was supplemented with epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), and 3) suspensions were directly plated on poly-D-lysine and laminin-coated coverslips and/or tissue culture treated plates.\n\nReagents and indicators\nHydroethidine (\nHEt\n) was purchased from Assay Biotech (Sunnyvale, CA). Newport Green, FluoZin-3 AM, MitoTracker Green, Pluronic F-127, MEM, fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and horse serum were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). N-methyl-D-aspartate (\nNMDA\n), 2,2\u2032-dithiodipyridine (\nDTDP\n), Rhodamine 123 (\nRhod123\n), and N,N,N,N-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine (\nTPEN\n) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (\nFCCP\n) was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO), apocynin obtained from Acros Organics (Morris Plains, NJ), and XF Base Medium (minimal Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium) from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA). All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from common commercial sources.\n\nZn\n2+\n/Ca\n2+\nloading\nPrior to all experiments, cultured neurons were removed from the incubator and placed in HEPES-buffered media (consisting of [in mM] 120 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.8 MgCl\n2\n, 20 Hepes, 15 glucose, 10 NaOH, in pH 7.4) with either 1.8 mM CaCl\n2\n(\n1.8 Ca\n2+\nHSS\n) or 0 mM CaCl\n2\n(\n0 Ca\n2+\nHSS\n) at room temperature. Cultures were maintained in HSS (\u00b1 Ca\n2+\n) for 10 min, followed where indicated by addition of \u201cpre-treatment\u201d (with DTDP and/or TPEN) for 10 min prior to induction of Zn\n2+\nand/or Ca\n2+\nloading. To do so, neurons were exposed to indicated levels of Zn\n2+\n(0 \u2013 300 \u03bcM) and/or 1.8 mM Ca\n2+\nin 90 mM K\n+\nHSS (\u201c\nhigh K\n+\n\u201d\n; HSS modified with 90 mM K\n+\nand Na\n+\nadjusted to 35 mM to maintain osmolarity) for 5 min to depolarize neurons, inducing ion entry through VSCC. When Ca\n2+\nwas present during exposure (with or without Zn\n2+\n), the NMDA antagonist MK-801 (10 \u03bcM) was added to inhibit Ca\n2+\nentry through NMDA receptors. After the 5 min exposure in high K\n+\n, neurons were washed 3 times into HSS (\u00b1 Ca\n2+\n, DTDP and TPEN as present before the exposure) for durations indicated. In addition, as we have found highly Ca\n2+\nor Zn\n2+\npermeable Ca-AMPA channels to be expressed in a small subset (~ 13%) of cultured cortical neurons (\nYin et al., 1994\n), we carried out additional controls using the AMPA channel antagonist 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline (NBQX; 10 \u03bcM) during the exposures (\nSensi et al., 1999a\n), and found no differences.\n\nQuantitative imaging studies\n10\u201316 days in vitro (\nDIV\n) cultures were mounted on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope equipped with a 75 W xenon lamp, a computer-controlled filter wheel, a 40x (1.3 numerical aperture) epifluorescence oil-immersion objective along with a green FITC fluorescence cube (Ex: 480 nm, dichroic: 505 nm, Em: 535 nm) and a red TRITC fluorescence cube (Ex: 540 nm, dichroic: 565 nm, Em: 605 nm). Emitted signals were acquired once every min with a Sensys Photometrics intensified charge-coupled device camera and digitized through the MetaFluor Version 7.0 software (Molecular Devices LLC, Sunnyvale, CA). Camera gain and exposure were adjusted to give baseline maximal fluorescence levels of 200\u2013300 arbitrary units of a maximal 12-bit signal output of 4,096 for all fluorophores. While the precise experiment schematic is described below, generally, baseline was measured for 10 min, followed by 10 min pre-treatment with DTDP and/or TPEN (if indicated), then by 5 min Zn\n2+\nand/or Ca\n2+\nloading (with high K\n+\n), and finally by wash into HSS, with addition of FCCP if indicated. For imaging, fields with \u2265 15 healthy looking cells (defined as non-clustered neurons with robust processes), were selected. Background fluorescence (defined as the lowest fluorescence value in a neuron free region of the field) was subtracted from images, and fluorescence measurements for each cell (\nF\nx\n) were normalized to the average fluorescence intensity of the 10 min baseline recording (\nF\n0\n) to track normalized fluorescence (\nF\nx\n/F\n0\n) over time. F\nx\n/F\n0\nof each cell from the field was averaged to produce one value, constituting one repetition of an experiment.\nTo assess cytosolic Zn\n2+\nlevels, cultures were first loaded in the dark with 5 \u03bcM of either the low affinity Zn\n2+\nindicator, Newport Green diacetate (K\nd\n~ 1 \u03bcM, Ex: 490 nm, Em: 530 nm), or the high affinity Zn\n2+\nindicator FluoZin-3 AM (K\nd\n~ 15 nM, Ex: 494 nm, Em: 516 nm) in 0 Ca\n2+\nHSS containing 0.2 % Pluronic F-127 and 1.5 % dimethlyl sulfoxide for 30 min at room temperature, then washed into 1.8 Ca\n2+\nHSS and kept in the dark for additional 30 min at room temperature to de-esterify indicators prior to imaging (using a green FITC fluorescence cube). Mitochondrial membrane potential (\n\u0394\u03a8\nm\n) was assessed by examining fluorescence changes in Rhod123 (Ex: 507 nm, Em: 529 nm), a positively charged dye that accumulates in active mitochondria, where its fluorescence intensity is quenched. Upon loss of \u0394\u03a8\nm\n, Rhod123 is released into the cytosol, resulting in increased fluorescence(\nDuchen et al., 2003\n). Neurons were incubated in the dark with 2 \u03bcM of Rhod123 in 1.8 Ca\n2+\nHSS for 30 min in room temperature prior to imaging (using a green FITC fluorescence cube). At the end of each experiment, the mitochondrial protonophore FCCP was added (1 \u03bcM, 5 min) to induce maximal loss of \u0394\u03a8\nm\n(and record the corresponding maximal Rhod123 \u0394F). ROS generation was assessed using the superoxide sensitive dye HEt (Ex: 510\u2013560 nm; Em: > 590 nm; using a red TRITC fluorescence cube). Cultures were loaded in the dark at room temperature with 5 \u03bcM HEt in either 0 or 1.8 Ca\n2+\nHSS for 30 min prior to imaging; ROS production is assessed as the rate of fluorescence increase (HEt \u0394F) as the HEt is oxidized into highly fluorescent ethidium.\n\nConfocal imaging of mitochondrial morphology\nConfocal microscopy of mitochondrial morphology was performed using an inverted stage Nikon Eclipse Ti chassis microscope with a Yokogawa CSUX spinning disk head. Images were collected with a 1000x (1.49 numerical aperture) oil-immersion objective using a Hamamatsu electromultiplying CCD camera, scanned sequentially with excitation (488 nm) via a Coherent sapphire laser source synchronized with the camera, and emission monitored with a 525 (50) nm filter, and acquired using MicroManager Image Acquisition software (version 1.4.16). Briefly, cells were loaded with 200 nM MitoTracker Green (Ex: 490 nm, Em: 516 nm) in 1.8 Ca\n2+\nHSS for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, and then switched to either 0 or 1.8 Ca\n2+\nHSS for the imaging experiment. Imaging rig was maintained at 37\u00b0C via heat fan, and camera gain, laser power, and exposure times were adjusted to give baseline fluorescence intensity of MitoTracker Green approximately 1.5x that of the background fluorescence value. Healthy looking neuron(s) were selected for imaging and exposed to treatments as described. Images were taken at baseline, 10 min after DTDP (if used), 5 min after Zn\n2+\nand/or Ca\n2+\nexposure and 10 min after wash (as detailed in\nFig. 6\n). Acquired images were blinded to both treatment groups and time points, then imported into ImageJ software, which was used to make adjustment to whole image to provide optimal discrimination of mitochondrial morphology. Lengths and width of distinct mitochondria were measured manually, the values of which were then used to calculate the length/width (\nL/W\n) ratio of the mitochondria. To assess relative changes in morphology over time, the L/W ratio was normalized to baseline values. The L/W ratios of the mitochondria found in the selected field were averaged to produce one average L/W ratio, representing one repetition of an experiment.\nFigure 6. Effects of Ca\n2+\n, Zn\n2+\n, and disruption of cytosolic Zn\n2+\nbuffering on mitochondrial morphology.\nOpen in a new tab\nA). Experiment schematic:\nNeurons loaded with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Green (200 nM) were placed in 0 or 1.8 Ca\n2+\nHSS, then exposed to DTDP (60 or 100 \u03bcM; where indicated), high K\n+\n/MK-801 with Zn\n2+\n(0, 50, or 300 \u03bcM) and/or 1.8 mM Ca\n2+\n, followed by wash into HSS \u00b1 DTDP, as described.\nB). Representative images:\nConfocal images (1000x) were taken at baseline, 5 min after Zn\n2+\nand/or Ca\n2+\nexposure, and 10 min after wash.\nC). Zn\n2+\nand Ca\n2+\ninduce different patterns of morphology change:\nThe length and width of individual mitochondria were measured blindly, and length/width (L/W) ratios calculated and normalized to baseline. Values for baseline, 5 min after exposure, and after 10 min wash are displayed. Traces show mean \u00b1 SEM normalized L/W ratio for each time point, each representing \u2265 5 experiments consisting of \u2265 50 mitochondria (* indicates p < 0.05, ** indicates p < 0.01, by one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc). Note that while the Ca\n2+\ninduces a rapid but transient morphologic change, Zn\n2+\ntriggers more progressive changes (that increase with the degree of Zn\n2+\nloading).\n\nMitochondrial respiration assay\nMitochondrial respiration was assessed by measuring changes in O\n2\nconsumption rate (\nOCR\n) using the Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer, as described previously with adjustments (\nYao et al., 2009\n). Briefly, neurons plated on top of astrocytic monolayers on Seahorse XF24 Cell Culture Microplates were exposed to DTDP, Zn\n2+\nand/or Ca\n2+\nin either 0 or 1.8 Ca\n2+\nHSS (as detailed in\nFig. 7\n), washed into XF Base Medium (supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 15 mM glucose, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate), and maintained at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. After the 1 hr incubation, the cultures were placed in the Seahorse XF24 instrument, which measures the OCR of cells during baseline and after the sequential exposure to 1 \u03bcM oligomycin, 2 \u03bcM FCCP, and antimycin A/rotenone (both at 1 \u03bcM). The concentrations of oligomycin, FCCP, and antimycin A/rotenone were based on those from the literature (\nYao et al., 2009\n) as well as empirical titration, with FCCP specifically adjusted to induce at least 1.5x the baseline OCR. Prior to each experiment, Seahorse XF24 instrument was calibrated following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols, and all culture wells were visually inspected (to ensure equal distribution of cells) and randomly assigned to treatment groups. Seahorse XF24 program was used to run the assay and Seahorse Wave Software used to analyze data. As neurons were plated on pre-established astrocyte monolayers (using the same culturing methods as described above), we carried out validation studies comparing responses of neuron-astrocyte co-culture to those of astrocyte-only cultures, confirming that astrocytes made minimal (\u2264 5%) contributions to observed basal OCR and OCR changes (data not shown).\nFigure 7. Zn\n2+\n-induced inhibition of mitochondrial respiration: synergy with Ca\n2+\nand effects of disrupted buffering.\nOpen in a new tab\nA). Schematic of experiment:\nNeurons were exposed to a series of treatments (detailed in\nB\nand\nC\n, left), incubated for 1 hr, then placed in the Seahorse assay, which measures O\n2\nconsumption rate (OCR) at baseline and after sequential application of oligomycin (\nOligo\n; 1 \u03bcM), FCCP (2 \u03bcM), and antimycin A & rotenone (\nAA/Rot\n; both 1 \u03bcM) to characterize various respiratory parameters. Traces (\nB\nand\nC\n, right) show time course of OCR and represent mean \u00b1 SEM of 3 separate experiments, each consisting of 3 \u2013 4 wells of cultured neurons, with arrows indicating time point at which mitochondrial inhibitors were added. Grey bars indicate time points of comparison (* indicates p < 0.05, ** indicates p < 0.01, by one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc).\nB). Ca\n2+\nand Zn\n2+\nsynergistically inhibit mitochondrial respiration:\nNeurons were placed in 0 or 1.8 Ca\n2+\nHSS, exposed to high K\n+\n/MK-801 with 300 \u03bcM Zn\n2+\n, 1.8 mM Ca\n2+\nor both Zn\n2+\nand Ca\n2+\nas described (\nleft\n). After 1 hr incubation OCR was measured (\nright\n). Note that simultaneous exposure to Zn\n2+\nand Ca\n2+\ninduced significant inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, despite the ions having minimal effects individually.\nC). Disrupted Zn\n2+\nbuffering significantly exacerbates Zn\n2+\neffects on mitochondrial respiration:\nNeurons were placed in 0 Ca\n2+\nHSS, exposed to DTDP (100 \u03bcM; where indicated), high K\n+\n/MK-801 with Zn\n2+\n(300, 10 or 0 \u03bcM, as indicated;\nleft\n). After 1 hr incubation OCR was measured (\nright\n). Note the near complete inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by 10 \u03bcM Zn\n2+\nexposure with DTDP.\n\nAssessment of cell death\nCell death was assessed in neurons plated on culture treated 24 well microplates. Briefly, 14\u201316 DIV neurons were switched into 0 or 1.8 Ca\n2+\nHSS, and exposed to a combination of DTDP, TPEN, Ca\n2+\nand/or Zn\n2+\n(concentration and durations detailed below). Cultures were then washed into MEM supplemented with 25 mM glucose and kept at 37\u00b0C/5% CO\n2\nfor 24 hrs (unless otherwise specified), prior to assessment of neuronal injury via direct examination (under phase-contrast microscopy) and by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) efflux assay as described (\nKoh and Choi, 1987\n). The small amount of background LDH present in the media of cultures carried though a sham-wash protocol was subtracted from values obtained in treated cultures. In each experiment, LDH values were scaled to the mean value obtained by a standard exposure to 300 \u03bcM NMDA for 24 hr (an exposure that reliably destroys most of the neuronal population without glial damage).\n\nStatistical analysis and repetition\nTo assess significance, either two-tailed t-test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc analysis (indicated in each figure legend) was used, depending on the number of groups of comparison. All values are displayed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (\nSEM\n). All experiments were repeated at least 3 times. Note that because of some differences in precise behavior of batches of cells reflecting biologic variables\u2014including age and health\u2014all comparisons reflect matched sets of cells, using the same sets of culture dissections with interleaved experiments."

    "Methods": "All procedures were performed in accordance with NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals with approval by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. Rats were housed in standard colony rooms with lighting on from 7 am to 7 pm, and food and water availablead libitum.\n\nTransient Systemic Hypoxia-Ischemia\nEmbryonic day (E) 18 pregnant Sprague-Dawley dams underwent isoflurane anesthesia and laparotomy, as previously described (\nRobinson, Petelenz et al. 2005\n,\nMazur, Miller et al. 2010\n). Like humans, rodent oligodendrogenesis begins prenatally, and differentiation and myelination continue postnatally. In rats, pioneering subplate neurons exit the thalamus by embryonic day 16 (E18) and arrive in the cortex by postnatal day 2 (P2) (\nKanold and Luhmann 2010\n). For prenatal transient systemic hypoxia-ischemia (TSHI), uterine arteries were transiently occluded for 60 minutes, while shams underwent laparotomy only for 60 min. This approach accurately recapitulates TSHI injury through intact maternal-placental-fetal units, and capitalizes on changes individual fetal microenvironments. Pups were born at term (E22) and reared with dams until postnatal day 21 (P21), when they were weaned and housed in single sex groups (2\u20133 per cage). Prenatal TSHI produces a reproducible insult with consistent fetal mortality and postnatal growth and neuropathological, biochemical and functional outcomes (\nRobinson, Petelenz et al. 2005\n,\nMazur, Miller et al. 2010\n,\nJantzie, Miller et al. 2013\n,\nJantzie et al. 2014\n,\nJantzie, Getsy et al. 2014\n,\nJantzie, Corbett et al. 2015\n,\nJantzie, Winer et al. 2016\n). For all experiments, both sexes, and rats generated from at least two separate litters were used. The average litter size for all experiments were similar, with sham litters an average of 10.4 \u00b1 0.5 pups and TSHI litters at 11.6 \u00b1 0.6 pups (p>0.05). The average pup size also did not differ between groups with sham weighing 7.3 \u00b1 0.05g on P1, TSHI pups weighing 7.1 \u00b1 0.1g and TSHI+EPO pups weighing 7.2\u00b10.1g at P1, consistent with our previously published reports of no significant differences between Sham and TSHI litters or pups, and the cumulative effects of\nin utero\nTSHI on litter size, postnatal survival and offspring body weight (\nJantzie, Corbett et al. 2014\n).\n\nPostnatal EPO treatment\nUsing an established, clinically-relevant dosing regimen (\nMazur, Miller et al. 2010\n,\nJantzie, Getsy et al. 2014\n,\nJantzie, Corbett et al. 2015\n,\nJantzie, Winer et al. 2016\n), P1 pups from all litters were individually randomized to receive either EPO (2000 U/kg, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or vehicle (sterile saline) intraperitoneally once daily from P1 to P5, a dosing regimen comparable to those used in human neonatal neuro-reparative trials. Rodents are born at a time equivalent to the human third trimester, with P9 approximately equivalent to term in human gestation (\nJantzie and Robinson 2015\n). Thus, EPO or vehicle administration at P1 to P5 is approximately equivalent to 30 to 35 weeks gestation in humans. Previous studies showed this dosing regimen improved stride length and seizure threshold, and demonstrated no unexpected findings with EPO-treated sham animals (\nMazur, Miller et al. 2010\n).\n\nBehavioral Testing\nThree rat cohorts (each cohort consisting of a sham and a prenatal TSHI litter) were sequentially tested for gait, and open field (OF) testing at P25-30. Specifically, Gait was tested at P25-P26, and then Open field was tested at P28-30. Two separate cohorts (4 litters) underwent social interaction testing at P30-P32.\nGait Analysis\nComputerized gait analysis was performed on P25-P26 (\nJantzie, Corbett et al. 2014\n,\nJantzie, Corbett et al. 2015\n). Briefly, digital video of each rat running on a backlit transparent treadmill set at 30 cm/s was acquired with a high-speed camera and analyzed using Digigait software (Mouse Specifics, Framingham, MA). Digigait software analyses identifies individual paw prints and allows calculation of multiple gait metrics and kinematic measurements based on the position, area and timing of each paw step. Similarly, posture, cadence, stance duration, well as braking, swing and propulsion phases of each step are measured. Propulsion was defined as the maximum paw contact on belt to just before the swing phase (push off and paw acceleration). Ataxia coefficients were calculated as the deviation of the minimum and maximum stride length from the mean stride length (\nPuram et al. 2011\n). As TSHI induces a global injury, data from right and left limbs were combined. Forelimb and hindlimb gait patterns were analyzed separately.\nOpen Field\nA circular open field arena (100 cm diameter) was placed in a quiet, well-lit room (130 lumens), and was marked to divide the arena into three equally-spaced, concentric circles labeled the center, neutral and peripheral zones. At P28-P30, each rat was initially placed against the wall of the testing arena, and allowed to explore for 15 minutes. Anymaze\n\u2122\nvideo-tracking software measured the distance traveled, velocity, and time spent in each zone, and entries from one zone to the adjacent zone.\nSocial Interaction and Olfaction\nA standard paradigm was used to identify impaired social interaction in rats at P30-P32 (\nSchneider and Przewlocki 2005\n,\nFoley et al. 2014\n,\nZugno et al. 2016\n). Briefly, one hour prior to testing, each rat was isolated in a clean cage. For social interaction testing, two rats of the same sex and treatment group, but from different litters, were placed in a dimly lit (30 lumens) circular testing arena (100 cm diameter) and recorded for 10 min using Anymaze\n\u2122\nvideo-tracking software. Each pair was counted as one social unit. Two observers blinded to the treatment group independently reviewed the trials and scored periods of social interaction (trailing, sniffing, grooming, playing, etc.). The inter-rater reliability was 0.94. Following assessment of social interactions, intact olfaction of each rat was confirmed by exposure to sequentially to scented-cotton swabs (water, adult male cage swab, and food odor) affixed to the top of a clean cage for 1 minute per swab. An observer blinded to treatment group recorded the time that the rat sniffed within 2 cm of the swab consistent with prior reports (\nSchneider and Przewlocki 2005\n,\nZugno, Canever et al. 2016\n).\n\nEx vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging\nEx Vivo\nMRI was performed on a Bruker 4.7 T BioSpec 47/40 Ultra-Shielded Refrigerated nuclear magnetic resonance imaging system, as previously described (\nJantzie et al. 2015\n,\nRobinson et al. 2016\n,\nRobinson et al. 2016\n). The MRI was equipped with a 72 mm I.D. quadrature RF coil and a small-bore (12 cm I.D.) gradient set with a maximum gradient strength of 50 Gauss/cm. Briefly, at P35-40 rats were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed from the skull and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 week, and embedded in 2% agarose containing 3 mM sodium azide for immediate\nex vivo\nMR imaging. Fixation adequately preserves brain microstructures and allows the generation of MR images of superior contrast and resolution, which is especially beneficial for evaluating white matter fibers and for assessing the brain\u2019s microstructural integrity (\nRobinson, Berglass et al. 2016\n,\nRobinson, Winer et al. 2016\n). T2 multi-slice multi-echo (MSME) structural images were obtained with a TR of 2514.7 ms and a TE of 12 ms. Echo-planar diffusion tensor imaging (EP-DTI) of twelve contiguous coronal 1 mm slices were obtained with a FOV (field-of-view) of 3.00 cm, a TR of 3000 ms, TE of 40 ms, MTX of 256, and b-value of 2000 mm\n2\n/s with 30 gradient directions. Brain regions of interest (ROI) including the sensory barrel cortex, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, and white matter (\nSuppl Fig 3\n) were analyzed using Bruker\u2019s Paravision 5.1 imaging software. Fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (\u03bb1) and radial ((\u03bb2+\u03bb3)/2) diffusivity eigenvectors were measured and calculated. Directionally encoded color maps were created and are presented as a composite image of primary eigenvectors overlaying T2 morphology. The morphology \u03b1 (0.5) and eigenvector \u03b1 (1.0) were equal for all images, with an overall composition \u03b1 of 0.4 \u00d710\n4\n.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nFrozen coronal sections (20\u03bcm) were cut on a cryostat, consistent with prior published methodology (\nJantzie, Corbett et al. 2014\n,\nJantzie, Corbett et al. 2015\n). Briefly, sections were washed and then incubated sequentially with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide and blocking solution containing 10% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibodies against neurofilament (NF, SMI-312, Covance, San Diego, CA, 1:500) or CHOP ((C/EBP homologous protein, 1:250, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) in blocking solution containing 0.1 % Triton were then applied and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The next morning, sections were rinsed, incubated with species appropriate biotinylated secondary antibodies, followed by Vectastain (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) and 3\u20323\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB). Sections were then dehydrated in a grades series of alcohols, cleared in xylenes and coverslipped with Permount (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Appropriate negative controls (no primary antibody) were run in parallel and as per the procedure described above. Using bright-field illumination, representative images were photographed on a Leica microscope.\n\nBlack Gold Staining\nMyelin was stained using a Black Gold-II kit per manufacturers\u2019 specifications, with slight modifications (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Briefly, 20 \u03bcm slide mounted sections were rinsed with MilliQ water and incubated with a pre-warmed 0.3% Black Gold Solution for 20 minutes at 60\u00b0C. After rinsing, sections were then incubated with 1% sodium thiosulfate for 1.5 minutes at 60\u00b0C. Sections were then washed, counterstained with cresyl violet, rinsed and dehydrated using a graded series of ethanols, and coverslipped with Permount. With brightfield illumination, representative images were photographed on a Leica microscope.\n\nMultiplex Electrochemiluminescent Immunnoassay (MECI)\nUsing an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay platform (MesoScale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD), brain levels of CHOP, a transcription factor and marker of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, were assayed in P5 sham, TSHI, and TSHI+EPO rat pups. Briefly, brain lysate (200 \u03bcg) was loaded onto a 96-well plate in duplicate per manufacturer\u2019s specifications, and consistent with our prior publications (\nYellowhair et al. 2017\n). Plates were read on a Quickplex SQ 120 Imager (MesoScale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nFor all analyses, data are represented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM), with p<0.05 considered statistically significant. For analysis of sham, TSHI-veh and TSHI-EPO groups for gait, open field, social interaction and MRI, all parametric variables were tested for normal distribution with the Shapiro-Wilk test, with Levene\u2019s test to confirm homogeneity of variances. Two-way ANOVA was performed with Bonferroni\u2019s post-hoc correction for multiple comparisons using SPSS21 (IBM, Armonk, NY). For functional assays, both sexes were analyzed together, and then each sex was analyzed separately. Due to resource limitations, and pilot analyses showing sex had no impact on MRI parameters (\nJantzie, Getsy et al. 2015\n,\nRobinson, Berglass et al. 2016\n,\nRobinson, Winer et al. 2016\n), separate analyses by sex were not performed for the DTI studies. Correlative relationships between DTI parameters and gait metrics were performed using a bivariate Pearson\u2019s correlation for continuous variables. Since the dependent measures were not collected in a within subjects design, adult Sham, TSHI and TSHI+EPO rats that underwent gait analysis were sex matched, and randomly compared to an independent sample of adult rats undergoing DTI analysis. A Pearson\u2019s product-moment correlation was then run to assess the relationship between individual DTI (i.e. FA, RD) and gait metrics (i.e. ataxia coefficient, stride length variation, paw area)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nhSOD1\nWT\nmice (B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1)2Gur/J) (\nGurney et al., 1994\n) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained in hemizygosis. C57BL/6J-GCLM (\u2212/\u2212) mice have been previously described (\nYang et al., 2002\n). Both lines were kept in C57BL/6J background. In order to generate the animals for this study, hemizygous hSOD1\nWT\nmales were mated with GCLM(\u2212/\u2212) females to obtain breeders with the following genotype GCLM(+/\u2212)/hSOD1WT+ and GCLM(+/\u2212)/hSOD1WT\u2212. Then, GCLM(+/\u2212)/hSOD1WT+ males were mated with GCLM(+/\u2212)/hSOD1WT\u2212 females to obtain the four genotypes analyzed in this study. The survival data in\nFigure 1D\ncorresponds to 8 \u2642/2 \u2640 GCLM(+/+)/hSOD1WT\u2212, 9 \u2642/5 \u2640 GCLM(+/+)/hSOD1WT+, 6 \u2642 /3 \u2640 GCLM(\u2212/\u2212)/hSOD1WT\u2212 and 5\u2642/2\u2640GCLM(\u2212/\u2212)/hSOD1WT+. Additional animals were bred and euthanized at specific time points. Through the duration of the studies, animals that developed clinical conditions common in mice (ulcerative dermatitis, cataracts with eye inflammation, etc.) and sudden death events were excluded from the survival study. No apparent genotype-specific increase in the incidence of common clinical conditions was noted. End-stage was determined by the inability of the animal to right itself within 20 seconds when placed on its side. This is a widely accepted and published endpoint for life span studies in ALS-mice and guarantees that euthanasia occurs prior to the mice being unable to forage for food or water. Mice that were unable to right themselves within 20 seconds were euthanized immediately and recorded as dead for the purpose of life span studies. Hind-limb grip strength was determined using a grip strength meter (San Diego Instruments). Tests were performed by allowing the animal to grasp the grid with both hind-limbs and pulling the animal straight away from the grid until it released the platform. Grip strength was measured once a week, in each session the average peak force of three attempts was recorded. All animal procedures were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the NIH. The Animal Care and Use Committee of MUSC (Animal Welfare Assurance number is A3428-01) approved the animal protocol pertinent to the experiments reported in this publication.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nOvert clinical features and decreased life span in GCLM(\u2212/\u2212)/hSOD1WT+ mice.\nA)\nTotal glutathione (GSH+GSSG) content in different tissues from 48\u201352 weeks old GCLM(+/+) and GCLM(\u2212/\u2212) mice in the presence or absence of hSOD1\nWT\n.

Spinal cords were removed, dehydrated, and paraffin embedded. Antigen retrieval was performed in a microwave oven in 0.01 M sodium citrate (pH 6.0) and serial 5 \u03bcm sections were stained with anti-GFAP (1:500, Thermo Scientific) or anti-Mac2 (1:250, Abcam). All sections were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and non-specific binding was blocked with 10% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS for 1 h at RT. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution were incubated for 1 h at RT. Sections were mounted with Fluoro-Gel (EMS). Controls were performed replacing the primary antibody with pre-immune IgG or serum. Quantification of the relative optical density of GFAP staining in the grey matter of the ventral horn of the spinal cord was performed in GFAP-immunolabeled sections imaged at 40X using ImageJ software. Measurements were performed in at least 5 spinal cord sections per genotype. Mean relative optical densities values were reported as percentage of GCLM(+/+)/hSOD1WT-mice.\nMotor neuron numbers were determined in 10 \u03bcm serial sections across the lumbar spinal cord stained with cresyl violet. Two independent observers blinded to the genotype of the samples counted every fifth section and a total of 32 sections per animal were analyzed. For motor root morphology, lumbar spinal cord root cross sections were stained overnight with 0.1% luxol fast blue, rinsed in 95% ethanol and water followed by differentiation in lithium carbonate for 10 seconds.\n\nWestern blot and real-time PCR analysis\nWestern blot analysis was performed as previously described (\nPehar et al., 2014\n). A human specific rabbit anti-hSOD1 (clone EPR1726, Epitomics) was used to probe for hSOD1. Densitometric analyses were performed using ImageJ software and normalized against the signal obtained by re-probing the membrane with anti-actin (clone AC-15, Sigma-Aldrich). RNA extraction, RNA retrotranscription and real-time PCR were performed as previously described (\nPehar et al., 2016\n). Specific primers were as follows: Chrna1/5\u2032: 5\u2032-GGTCGGCTCATTGAGTTACA-3\u2032, Chrna1/3\u2032: 5\u2032-CCTTCCTCTCTTCCATCTTTCC-3\u2032, Chrng/5\u2032: 5\u2032-CTACGAAGGCCTGTGGATATTG-3\u2032, Chrng/3\u2032: 5\u2032-CACGAGGACATTGCAGTAGAG-3\u2032, Tbp/5\u2032:5\u2032-CTACCGTGAATCTTGGCTGTAA-3\u2032, Tbp/3\u2032: 5\u2032-GTTGTCCGTGGCTCTCTTATT-3\u2032.\n\nGlutathione assay\nTotal glutathione levels (GSH and GSSG) were determined using the Tietze method as previously described (\nVargas et al., 2006\n). Tissues were lysed in 5 volumes of 5% sulfosalicylic acid. Glutathione content was corrected by protein concentration determined by BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific).\n\nStatistical analysis\nGroups of at least three animals were used for biochemical analysis and all data are reported as mean \u00b1 SD. Survival and onset data was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curves and log rank test. Multiple group comparison was performed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post-test and differences were declared statistically significant if p< 0.05. All statistical computations were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software)."

    "Methods": "Materials and antibodies\nStock solutions of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; Tocris), guanabenz acetate salt, clonidine, efaroxan (Sigma) were prepared in ddH2O; camptothecin (CPT; Tocris) was prepared in DMSO. The following antibodies were used: anti-ATF4 was commercially generated for our laboratory (\nLiu et al., 2014\n;\nPasini et al., 2015\n); anti-GADD34 was from Proteintech; anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was from EMD Millipore; anti-ERK was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-parkin (PARK8), anti-phospho-eIF2\u03b1 (S51) and total eIF-2\u03b1 were from Cell Signaling Technology.\n\nPlasmids and lentivirus preparation\nAll shRNA constructs for infection experiments were generated in pLVTHM (Addgene). The following are the target sequences for different silencing constructs: shCTR (a mutant version of shATF4, mutated bases are underlined); 5 \u2032 -GCC\nA\nGA\nT\nTC\nA\nGC\nG\nGC\nC\nTA\nC\nAT-3 \u2032); shATF4: 5 \u2032 -GCCTGACTCTGCTGCTTATAT-3\u2019. shParkin: 5 \u2032 -ATCACCTGACAGTACAGAACT-3 \u2032. The specificity of these constructs has been demonstrated previously (\nLiu et al., 2014\n;\nRoman\u00ed-Aumedes et al., 2014\n;\nSun et al., 2013\n). All plasmids were sequenced to confirm the correct insert.\nLentivirus was prepared by transient transfection of 293T cells with the target plasmid (pLVTHM) and second generation packaging plasmids (pMDLg/pRRE and CMV-VSVG, Addgene). The supernatant was collected, and virus particles were concentrated by Lenti-X concentrator (Clontech), resuspended in PBS, aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. For lentiviral infection, cultures were transduced at day 3\u20134 of differentiation at an approximate multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5, and experiments were performed at least 3 d later. Using these conditions, the infection rate was reliably >90%.\n\nCell culture and viability assays\nPC12 cells were cultured as described previously (Greene and Tischler, 1976). For neuronal differentiation, cells were grown in RPMI-1640 media with 1% horse serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 50 ng/ml recombinant human nerve growth factor for 6\u201312 d. Media was changed every other day. Primary cortical neuron cultures from E18 rats were prepared as described previously (\nFriedman et al., 1993\n) and maintained in Neurobasal media supplemented with B-27 and glutamine.\nFor survival experiments, cells were pretreated with guanabenz for 4 hours, then treated with 100 \u00b5M 6-OHDA or 10 \u00b5M CPT. Cell nuclei were counted (24 hours after toxin treatment unless otherwise stated) after adding counting cell lysis buffer as described previously (\nRukenstein et al., 1991\n). Each condition was performed in triplicate, and each experiment was performed at least three times.\nPrimary ventral midbrain cultures from P0\u2013P3 rat were prepared as described previously (\nMichael et al., 2007\n). After 6\u20137 days in culture, cells were pretreated with 2.5 \u00b5M guanabenz for 4 hours and then treated with 50 \u00b5M 6-OHDA for 24 h. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained for TH. Cell survival was measured as the total count of TH cells in each culture. Three independent experiments were performed, with each condition performed in triplicate in each experiment.\n\nWestern immunoblot and real-time PCR\nPC12 cells or cortical neurons were lysed in Cell Lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) with protease inhibitor (cOmplete, Roche), supplemented with 2.5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and prepared for SDS-PAGE with 4 X Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 10 min at 100\u00b0C before running. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (BioRad). The membrane was blocked with 5% milk, incubated with the indicated primary antibody and the appropriate secondary antibody, visualized with ECL reagent (Pierce), and developed on film. Images were scanned and quantified using image J.\nTotal cellular RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent (Ambion) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. cDNA was synthesized using first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Origene) with 1 \u00b5g of total RNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using FastStart SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche) and an Eppendorf Realplex Mastercyler with the program: 95\u00b0C for 15 secs, 58C for 30secs, 72\u00b0C for 30secs. The primer pairs are: ATF4 forward 5\u2032-CCTTCGACCAGTCGGGTTTG-3\u2019 and reverse 5\u2032-CTGTCCCGGAAAAGGCATCC-3\u2032; Parkin Fwd 5\u2019-CGGATGAGTGGAGAGTGC-3\u2019 and reverse 5\u2019-TGGCGGTGGTTACATTGG-3\u2019; GADD34 forward 5\u2032-AAGGCGTGTCCATGCTCTGG-3\u2032, and reverse 5\u2032-GTCCATTTCCTTGCTGTCTG-3\u2032; \u03b1-tubulin forward 5\u2032-TACACCATTGGCAAGGAGAT-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-GGCTGGGTAAATGGAGAACT-3\u2032; 18S rRNA forward 5\u2032-TTGATTAAGTCCCTGCCCTTTGT-3\u2032, and reverse 5\u2032-CGATCCGAGGGCCTCACTA-3\u2032. For quantification of relative expression, values were normalized to either \u03b1-tubulin or 18S levels. Each reaction was performed in triplicate, and each condition was performed in triplicate.\n\nImmunohistochemistry in human brain sections\nPostmortem brain samples from neuropathologically confirmed PD cases (n=5) and age- and gender-matched controls (n=7) were obtained from the New York Brain Bank at Columbia University (New York, NY). Midbrain sections (6 \u00b5m) were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in an ethanol series. Sections were then cooked for antigen retrieval in citrate buffer for 45 min at 100\u00b0C. Sections were then blocked in goat serum for 20 min and incubated with anti-GADD34 (Proteintech) at 1:200 in blocking buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. To test the specificity of the antibody, some sections were incubated with the antibody that was mixed with GADD34 fusion protein (Proteintech) Sections were then washed and incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and incubated in ready-to use ABC complex solution (Vectastain, Vector Laboratories) at room temperature, and then SG substrate (Vector Laboratories) was added and left on the sides for 15 min. Sections were counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red, dehydrated and mounted with coverslips. For quantification of GADD34 staining pattern, neuromelanin-positive neurons were assessed for the presence of GADD34-positive granules in a blinded manner. At least 30 neurons were assessed for each case.\n\nIn vivo\n6-OHDA mouse experiments\nAdult (8 week) male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories) were divided into 3 groups, which were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with vehicle (normal saline + 5% DMSO), 1 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg guanabenz for 3 days. On day 0, 6-OHDA was injected as previously described (\nChen et al., 2012\n). Briefly 6-OHDA was injected by microliter syringe at a rate of 0.5 \u00b5L/min by pump for a total dose of 15.0 \u00b5g/3 \u00b5l. Injection was performed into the left striatum at coordinates AP: +0.09 cm; ML: +0.22 cm; DV: \u22120.25 cm relative to bregma. After 2 minutes, the needle was slowly removed. On the following day, GA dosing was resumed, and continued by dosing 3 times per week thereafter for another 4 weeks.\nAnimals were sacrificed and analyzed for SN dopaminergic neuron count and striatal dopaminergic innervation using well-established protocols that have been previously described (\nChen et al., 2012\n). Briefly, animals were perfused intracardially 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer, pH 7.1. Brains were carefully removed, then post-fixed for 1 week, cryoprotected for 24 hours in 20% sucrose and flash frozen. A complete set of 30 micron thick sections through the SN were cut on a cryostat, and every fourth section was processed for TH immunostaining, in keeping with the fractionator sampling method. Sections were stained free-floating using rabbit anti-TH antibody (1:750, Calbiochem), followed by biotinylated protein A and ABC, and thionin counterstaining.\nDopaminergic SN counts were determined using stereological analysis with StereoInvestigator. All counts were performed in a blinded fashion on coded slides. The SN on each side was analyzed for each animal, and the entire SN was defined as the region of interest. TH-positive neurons were identified at 100\u00d7, focusing through the entire extent of each section. The program calculated the number of TH-positive neurons in each SN.\nFor striatal TH staining, forebrain sections containing the striatum were processed similarly to the midbrain sections, except that sections were post-fixed for 48 hours and frozen without cryoprotection. Optical density of striatal TH immunostaining was measured using an Imaging Research Analytical Imaging Station.\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Columbia University Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism. Comparisons between two experimental groups were performed with a Student\u2019s\nt\n-test. Multiple comparisons of more than two experimental groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey\u2019s\npost-hoc\ntest, or with two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni\npost-hoc\ntest."

    "Methods": "Animal research ethics\nThe study protocol complied with the EU Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments and was approved by the Committees on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Bologna and of the Italian Ministry of Education, University, and Research. Surgery was performed under isoflurane anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.\n\nMice\nExperiments were performed on TG (\nPlp-FLAG-LMNB1\n) mice (\nRolyan et al., 2015\n) and on their wild-type (WT) control littermates on a FVB/N background. TG mice overexpress the lamin B1 gene under control of the murine proteolipid protein 1 (\nPlp1\n) promoter, which is preferentially expressed in oligodendrocytes. A mouse colony was established at the University of Bologna (Department of Veterinary Medical Sciences, Ozzano dell'Emilia, Italy and Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, Bologna, Italy) from founder mice from the colony of Prof. Q. Padiath at the Department of Human Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, PA, USA, and from FVB/N mice purchased from Charles River, Italy (Calco, Italy). Breeding was performed with hemizygote x WT mating and TG mice were identified by genotyping with standard polymerase chain reactions (\nRolyan et al., 2015\n). Mice were housed under a 12:12-h light\u2013dark cycle with ambient temperature set at 23\u00b0C and free access to water and food (4RF21diet; Mucedola, Settimo Milanese, Italy).\n\nOverview of the experimental protocol\nThe experiments were performed on mice of 3 age groups. The age groups I and III corresponded to 24-27 and 44-47 (range) weeks of age, respectively. The age group II corresponded to 34-38 weeks of age for walking and water licking tests. A subset of mice of age group II was surgically instrumented after these tests to undergo respiratory phenotyping at 36-40 weeks of age, cardiovascular phenotyping at 37-42 weeks of age, and euthanasia immediately afterwards with tissue explant for immunohistochemistry. Based on the previous reports on TG mice (\nHeng et al., 2013\n;\nRolyan et al., 2015\n), somatic motor deficits were expected to be absent for age group I, mild for age group II, and severe for age group III. It was thus expected that TG mice of age group II would be the focus of the work, aimed at investigating whether these mice had autonomic defects before somatic motor defects became severe in age group III. At present, there is no evidence indicating gender variation of ADLD (\nNahhas et al., 2016\n). We performed all experiments on female mice. In addition, we replicated on male mice the tests of walking ability for each age group and of sympathetic innervation for age group III.\n\nTests of walking ability\nMice were tested for their walking ability on a narrow path (ledge test) and in an open field using a structured assessment (\nGuyenet et al., 2010\n). For the ledge test, mice were gently lifted and positioned on the 5-mm ledge of a rectangular cage. Mice were assigned the following scores: 0, walk on the cage ledge without hind paw slips and/or descent into the cage landing on paws; 1, repeated hind-paw slips; 2, ineffective use of the hind legs, or uncoordinated descent into the cage not landing on paws; 3, falls off the ledge and/or refusal to move despite encouragement by gentle nudges. For the open field walking test, mice were left free to walk on a large flat surface and assigned the following scores: 0, coordinated walk with body weight support on all limbs, the abdomen not touching the ground, and even participation of both hind limbs; 1, mild tremor and/or limp; 2, severe tremor and/or limp, lowered pelvis, or feet pointing away from the long axis of the body; 3, difficulty moving forward, with the abdomen dragging along the ground. These evaluations were performed by trained investigators blind to the mouse genotype, and were repeated 3 times, with the final scores computed as the median values of the 3 trial scores for each test. The third trial was omitted for mice that received scores of 0 at the ledge and open field tests for the first and second trial. The sample sizes for the tests of walking ability are reported in\nTable S1\n.\n\nTest of water licking\nWater licking was recorded during the 12-h dark period in the mouse home cage by measuring the junction potential between the steel spout of a water bottle and an aluminum foil on the cage bottom every time the mouse licked the spout, thereby closing the electrical circuit between the foil and the spout with its body (\nHayar et al., 2006\n). The junction potential voltage signals were manually reviewed to reject artefacts and identify trains of \u2265 4 licks. The inter-lick time interval (onset to onset) was computed for each lick, and its median value over the whole recording was retained for each mouse. The sample sizes for the test of water licking are reported in\nTable S2\n.\n\nSurgery\nMice underwent surgery under isoflurane anesthesia (1.8-2.4% in O\n2\n) with intra-operative analgesia (Carprofen 0.1 mg subcutaneously, Pfizer Italy, Latina) as previously described in detail (\nSilvani et al., 2009\n). Briefly, mice were instrumented with 2 screw electrodes for electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings (frontal-parietal differential lead) and 2 wire electrodes in the neck muscles for electromyogram (EMG) recordings. A calibrated telemetric arterial pressure transducer (TA11-PAC10, DSI, Tilburg, The Netherlands) was implanted subcutaneously, with the catheter tip advanced via the femoral artery until below the renal arteries.\n\nEstral phase determination\nBefore respiratory phenotyping and again after cardiovascular phenotyping, female mice of age group II underwent vaginal lavage and cytology to discriminate the estral phase following published criteria (\nByers et al., 2012\n) as previously described (\nSilvani et al., 2015\n). Vaginal cytology did not evidence significant differences in estral phase between TG and WT either before or after cardiovascular recordings (\nTable S3\n).\n\nAssessment of the respiratory phenotype\nThe EEG, EMG and breathing of mice unrestrained except for the electrode tether were recorded simultaneously inside a modified 2-chamber whole-body plethysmograph (PLY4223, Buxco, Wilmington, NC, USA) for the first 8 hours of the light period with ambient temperature set at 25 \u00b0C, as previously described (\nSilvani et al., 2014b\n). The mouse chamber was fitted with an electrical swivel (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA, USA) to prevent the electrode tether from twisting, and continuously purged with 1.5 L/min air to prevent CO\n2\nbuild-up. The system was calibrated dynamically with a 100 \u03bcL syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) at the termination of each recording. The states of wakefulness, non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (N), and rapid-eye-movement sleep (R) were scored visually with 4-s time resolution based on the EEG and EMG signals using published criteria (\nSilvani et al., 2009\n). The breathing analysis was performed on stable sleep episodes lasting \u2265 12 s as previously described in detail (\nSilvani et al., 2014b\n). Episodes of wakefulness were excluded from the analysis because of the artefacts caused by body movements on the plethysmography signal.\nTotal breath duration (T\nTOT\n), tidal volume (V\nT\n) and minute volume (V\nE\n=V\nt\n/T\nTOT\n) were calculated, and volumes were expressed per gram body weight. Augmented breaths (sighs) and breathing pauses (apneas) were defined as V\nT\nand T\nTOT\n> 3 times their average values, respectively, for each mouse and sleep state. The short-term and long-term variability of T\nTOT\nwas estimated from Poincar\u00e9 plots of the T\nTOT\nof consecutive breaths by computing the standard deviations of T\nTOT\nwith respect to new axes oriented with (SD1) or orthogonal to (SD\n2\n) the line of identity of the Poincar\u00e9 plots, as previously described (\nSilvani et al., 2014b\n). The sample sizes for the assessment of the respiratory phenotype were 10 TG and 11 WT mice.\n\nAssessment of the cardiovascular phenotype\nThe EEG, EMG, and arterial pressure signals of mice unrestrained except for the electrode tether were recorded simultaneously inside the home cage for 48 hours with ambient temperature at 21.2 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C, then, after 24 hours' habituation to 31.1 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b0C ambient temperature, for 24 hours at the latter temperature, as previously described (Lo Martire et al., 2012). A rotating electrical swivel (Plastics One) and a balanced suspensor arm prevented the electrode tether from twisting and balanced its weight, allowing unhindered movement to the mice. The states of wakefulness, N, and R were scored visually with 4-s time resolution based on the EEG and EMG signals using published criteria (\nSilvani et al., 2009\n). For each heartbeat, values of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and heart period (HP, the reciprocal of heart rate) were computed from the raw arterial pressure signal as previously described (\nSilvani et al., 2009\n) and averaged over spontaneous full-blown episodes of wakefulness, N, and R with duration \u2265 60 s (\nSilvani et al., 2010\n). Furthermore, the changes (\u0394) in SAP and HP during spontaneous transitions between spontaneous episodes of N with duration \u2265 36 s and episodes of either wakefulness or R with duration \u2265 96 s were analyzed as previously described (Lo Martire et al., 2012; Silvani et al., 2014a). HP was analyzed instead of heart rate, which is its reciprocal, because HP is linearly related to the frequency of cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic discharge (\nSilvani et al., 2016\n) and is required for the computation of the indexes pNN8 and BRS (cf. below). For each wake-sleep state, the parasympathetic modulation of HP, the sympathetic modulation of arterial pressure, and the cardiac baroreflex sensitivity were estimated with validated indexes. In particular, the parasympathetic modulation of HP was estimated in the time domain with the index pNN8, which is the % of HP values that differ from the following ones by > 8 ms (\nLaude et al., 2008b\n), and in the frequency domain with the index RSA, which quantifies respiratory sinus arrhythmia based on the spectral power of HP in the frequency range 2.5-5.0 Hz (\nBaudrie et al., 2007\n). The index of sympathetic modulation of arterial pressure (SYM) was computed based on the spectral power of SAP in the frequency range 0.15\u20130.6 Hz (\nBaudrie et al., 2007\n). The cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was estimated with the sequence technique (\nLaude et al., 2008a\n). The indexes pNN8, RSA, SYM, and BRS were computed based on beat-to-beat values of SAP and HP in wake-sleep episodes with duration \u2265 60 s, as previously described (\nSilvani et al., 2010\n). The sample sizes for the assessment of the cardiovascular phenotype were 8 TG and 10 WT mice.\n\nAnalysis of the sympathetic innervation of the heart and kidneys\nAn immunofluorescence analysis of the noradrenergic sympathetic innervation of the heart and kidneys was performed post-mortem using an antibody against the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, which catalyzes the first reaction (hydroxylation of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine) in the synthesis of noradrenaline. The heart and kidneys were explanted immediately after euthanasia by 4% isoflurane in O\n2\n, and fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours. After fixation, samples were washed 3 times over 8 hours in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with pH 7.4 at 4 \u00b0C, then stored at 4 \u00b0C in a PBS-sodium azide with 30% saccharose solution until they sank. Samples were then included in OCT resin (Killik, Bio-Optica, Milano, Italy), frozen at -196 \u00b0C in liquid N\n2\n, and cut at -20 \u00b0C in 15 \u03bcm sections. The heart and kidneys were sectioned along their short axes, the former at the level of the ventricles. Sections were transferred on slides pre-coated with 0.1% gelatin (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), dried, and stored at -80 \u00b0C. For further processing, slides were thawed, rehydrated by washing 3 times in PBS 0.01 M for 10 minutes, and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with 10% normal donkey serum in PBS 0.01 M with 0.5% Triton. Slides were then incubated with the primary antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase raised in sheep (Life Technologies, Temecula, CA; 100 \u03bcL diluted 1:5000 in PBS 0.01 M with 1% normal donkey serum and 0.5% Triton) for 24 hours at 4 \u00b0C, washed 3 times in PBS 0.01 M to remove excess primary antibody, incubated with the secondary antibody (donkey anti-sheep, Alexa Fluor 594, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Italy; 2 mg/mL, diluted 1:400 in PBS 0.01 M with 1% normal donkey serum and 0.3% Triton) for 90 minutes at room temperature in the dark, and washed three times again in PBS 0.01 M. Slides were finally cover-slipped with glycerol buffer and stored at -20\u00b0C in the dark. Fiber profiles positive for tyrosine hydroxylase were counted at fluorescence microscopy by two investigators (CB and VLM) blind to the mouse genotype. The sample sizes and number of histological fields analyzed to quantify sympathetic innervation are detailed in\nTable S4\n. Data from the heart of 1 male WT mouse of age group III were excluded from the analysis as an outlier value (estimated 12.6 fiber profiles/mm\n2\nvs. a group average of 3.1 profiles/mm\n2\n) possibly due to a technical issue with tissue processing and immunohistochemistry.\n\nData analysis and statistics\nLabview (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA), Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) and SPSS (SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA) were employed for data acquisition, data analysis, and statistical analysis, respectively. The categorical scores of the tests of walking ability were analyzed with Mann-Whitney tests. The other results were analyzed with mixed-model analysis of variance (general linear model procedure, with Huyn-Feldt correction) and t-tests. For the sake of clarity, since the focus of this study was on differences between TG and WT, we reported on the significance of the main effect (ANOVA) or simple effect (t-test) of TG vs. WT. Statistical significance was at P < 0.05. Data are reported as means \u00b1 SD."

    "Methods": "Isolation and cultivation of adult DRGs\nFor in vitro depolarization, cervical, thoracic and lumbar DRGs from na\u00efve adult male and female Fischer 344 rats were isolated and pooled as previously described (\nMcCall et al., 2012\n). Rats were killed by an overdose of anesthesia mixture (375 mg/kg ketamine, 19.05 mg/kg xylazine, 3.75 mg/kg acepromazine; i.p.) and decapitated. During dissection, DRGs were collected in ice-cold Hibernate A medium, washed with HBSS and digested (Collagenase XI, 2.5 mg/ml, 1200 units/mg and Dispase I, 5 mg/ml, 4 units/mg; Worthington Biochemical in HBSS) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, mixing every 10 min. Digestion was stopped by washing with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 1 ml complete medium (DMEM/F12, 1\u00d7B27, 2mM L-glutamine, and Pen-Strep 10 mg/ml) followed by a wash with 1 ml serum-free complete medium and trituration with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Larger debris was allowed to settle and cell suspensions were plated. In animals that underwent ES, sham electrode implantation, CLs of the sciatic and na\u00efve control animals (see below), only L4-L6 DRGs were dissected for in vitro neurite outgrowth assays. DRGs from left and right side were collected independently 7 days after treatment, when maximum effects of CLs on neurite outgrowth and changes in gene expression are expected (\nRichardson and Issa, 1984\n;\nSmith and Skene, 1997\n). DRGs were isolated using a posterior approach by exposing the lumbar vertebral column and removing the posterior processes with a rongeur. L4-L6 DRGs were identified and digestion and dissociation was performed in a smaller volume (200\u2013300\u03bcl) as described above.\nFor cultivation of dissociated DRGs, plates were coated and medium was freshly prepared on the day of DRG isolation. Six-well polystyrene plates (35 mm wells) were first coated with 16.67 \u03bcg/ml poly-D-lysine (PDL; 1.5 ml/well; Sigma) in sterile H\n2\nO for 1 h at room temperature (RT). The plates were washed with sterile H\n2\nO and coated with laminin (0.5 \u03bcg/ml or 5 \u03bcg/ml as indicated; Sigma) diluted in Dulbecco\u2019s PBS (DPBS) for 3 h at RT. After laminin coating, plates were gently rinsed with DPBS, filled with 2 ml/well of complete medium and placed at 37\u00b0C until cell plating.\n\nIn vitro depolarization\nFreshly isolated DRGs were plated at a density of 25.000 cells/35 mm\n2\nwell in complete media with or without KCl (40mM). The concentration was chosen based on previous studies showing an effect on neurite growth without affecting cell viability (\nEnes et al., 2010\n). As a control for osmolarity, 40mM NaCl was added to control wells. Cells were incubated for the indicated time, media was replaced in all wells and in some cases, cells were replated in normal media, fixed and immunolabeled at the time indicated.\nTo reinitiate growth, DRGs were replated at a certain time point as described (\nSaijilafu et al., 2013\n). Briefly, DRG neurons were cultivated for 1 h to 7 days as indicated, media was removed and cells were incubated with 0.125% Trypsin/EDTA for 5 min at 37\u00b0C. DRGs were collected by centrifugation (5 min at 800 rpm), suspended in serum-free complete medium and replated in newly coated plates to reinitiate axon growth. DRGs were fixed 24 h or 48 h after replating, or less, as specified.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nCultured DRG neurons were fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min, blocked with tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% donkey serum for 1 h at RT, then primary antibody (mouse anti-\u00dfIII-tubulin; 1:1000; Promega; to identify neurons and their neurites) was added in TBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 (TBST), 1% donkey serum at 4\u00b0C overnight. Plates were washed 3\u00d7 with TBS and secondary antibodies (donkey anti-mouse IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor-488 or -594;1:1000; Invitrogen) were added in TBST, 1% donkey serum for 3h at RT in the dark. DAPI (0.25 \u03bcg/ml) was added for 10 min in the first washing step, followed by 2 washing steps with TBS. Plates were maintained at 4\u00b0C in TBS, imaged, then covered with Fluoromount G (SouthernBiotech) and stored at RT in the dark.\n\nNeurite growth assessment\nNeurons and their neurites labeled for \u00dfIII-tubulin\nwere automatically imaged using an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope equipped with a motorized stage and controlled by Olympus Cell-P Software. Twelve 4\u00d75 images were captured at 40\u00d7 magnification and automatically stitched into non-overlapping composites per 35 mm\n2\nwell (72 images per 6-well plate). In some cases, 100\u00d7 images were captured, resulting in 4\u00d75 automatically stitched non-overlapping composites, 80% compressed for storage purposes (264 images per 6-well plate). Image files were converted in NIH ImageJ to 8-bit RGB format, opened and neurons were identified by \u00dfIII-tubulin labeling. Longest neurite outgrowth assessments were done by semi-automatically tracing the longest neurite of each neuron using the NeuronJ plug-in, starting at the base of the neurite at the edge of the cell soma. The lengths in pixels were averaged for each well. The average longest neurite growth for each condition was then normalized to data from sham animals in the same experiment, to exclude possible influences of plate coating and isolation conditions, as well as potential surgery-related effects.\nCell classification by longest neurite length\nTo determine if the overall differences in average longest neurite values are due to increased/decreased neurite elongation or initiation, neurons were classified by the length of the longest neurite. The number of cells in each category was expressed as percentage of the total number of neurons. For replated cells with longer neurites, we used the categories <50, 50\u2013250, 250\u2013500 and >500\u03bcm, while for 24h growth immediately after isolation we used <20, 20\u201340, 40\u2013100 and >100\u03bcm. Values shorter than the minimum diameter of a cell body (15\u201320\u03bcm) correspond to cells without neurites and were in some case separately analyzed.\nBranching analysis\nFrom all neurons analyzed for neurite growth, neurons with neurites longer than 100 \u03bcm were identified. Branch points of the longest neurite were manually counted. In some samples, additional images from the same wells were added to the analysis as the number of qualified neurons (neurites longer than 100 \u03bcm) was too low. On average, 30 neurons were analyzed per sample (total of 921 neurons). In one sample of the naive group, no neurons qualified for this analysis (all neurites shorter than 100 \u03bcm) and this sample was excluded, resulting in n=8 for ES, CL and sham conditions, n=7 for na\u00efve animals. Data is expressed as the average number of branches per 100 um of neurite length for the longest neurite.\n\nSurgeries\nA total of 107 adult (8\u201314 weeks) female Fischer 344 rats (150\u2013200g, Charles River Deutschland, Sulzfeld, Germany) were used for electrical stimulation, conditioning lesions and appropriate controls following European Commission Council Directives. All animal procedures were approved by institutional and state regulators. Animals had ad libitum access to food and water throughout the study. Within the same experiment, all groups received the same anesthesia. Isoflurane anesthesia (3\u20134% induction, up to 5 min and 1\u20131.5% maintenance) with an inhalator (FMI, Germany) was used for minimally-invasive surgeries including ES in chronically implanted animals, injection of the tracer cholera toxin \u00df-subunit (CTB) into the sciatic nerve (see below) and when anesthesia for extended time periods was required (ES for 7h). For surgeries involving dorsal column lesion (DCL) or cuff electrode implantation, anesthesia mix (62.5 mg/kg ketamine, 3.175 mg/kg xylazine, 0.625 mg/kg acepromazine) was administered intramuscularly (i.m.).\nPostoperative pain was treated by subcutaneous (s.c) buprenorphine (Temgesic) injection (0.03\u20130.05 mg/kg twice a day) for 2 days followed by Carprofen (4\u20135 mg/kg once daily) as needed. Prophylactic antibiotics were delivered s.c. for 2 days post-surgery (ampicillin 167 mg/kg, twice daily). Control animals received either no manipulation (na\u00efve) or implantation of electrodes without stimulation (sham). As a positive control, rats underwent CL of the sciatic nerve (crush at mid-thigh level for 20 s with a jeweler\u2019s forceps). Cuff electrodes were placed on the sciatic nerve in the mid-thigh area in anesthetized rats, after exposing the nerve and gently dissecting the connective tissue, and ES was performed as described below. The electrodes were removed after ES, or remained in place for chronic/repeated ES, with a subcutaneous connector between the shoulder blades. Implants were left for up to 7 d for in vitro growth experiments and up to 28 d for in vivo growth experiments with no displacement or obvious adverse effects. Within each experiment, sham cuff electrodes were left in place for the same time as stimulating electrodes, to control for potential nonspecific effects due to the cuffs. In 2 pilot experiments, we performed ES, CL or sham unilaterally, to check for a potential influence of unilateral ES on the contralateral side. We found no indication of such effects in neurite growth assay. Therefore, right and left side of an animal were assessed independently in subsequent experiments. To minimize the influence of factors such as growth medium and laminin batch in in vitro growth assays, an equal number of sham animals were included in all experimental cohorts on the same day and data were normalized to sham values of the respective experiment.\nCuff electrodes\nwere manufactured from silicone tube (8079, Science-Products, 1.574 mm inner diameter; 2.413 mm outer diameter), Teflon coated steel wire single strand annealed (SS-2TA, Science-Products) and connectors embedded in silicone non-toxic glue matching the output connector manufactured for the Iso-Flex stimulus isolator (A.M.P.I.). The silicone tube was cut in 3 mm cylinders with a longitudinal opening to insert the nerve into the cuff. The wires were fixed on one side of the cuff with knots, shaped as circular electrodes and isolation was removed on the inner surface of the cuff. Silicone glue was used, if necessary, to better fix or to isolate the wires outside the cuff. Resulting anode and cathode were 2\u20132.5 mm apart in the silicone cuffs. Final inner diameter of the cuffs was 1.2\u20131.4mm, resulting in loose enclosure of the sciatic nerve to avoid pressure to the nerve (\nFouad and Pearson, 1997\n).\nES set-up and parameters\nES was applied to the intact nerve using Iso-Flex Stimulus Isolators controlled by a Digidata 1440 (Axon Instruments). The standard ES parameters used were: 20 Hz, constant current stimulation, pulse duration 0.2 ms for 1 h. These settings have been shown to be most effective for promoting DRG peripheral axon outgrowth (\nGeremia et al., 2007\n) and to also promote central sprouting (\nUdina et al., 2008\n). Stimulation intensity was set to 2 times motor threshold, assessed by the first visible movement of the hind-paw, activating both afferent and efferent large myelinated A\u00df-fibers and motor fibers. The motor threshold was determined independently for every nerve prior to every stimulation session, and intensity set accordingly. In 7 h ES experiments, polarity was switched after every hour, to make the stimulation as similar as possible to ES for 1h, while at the same time minimizing cumulative chemical changes. Stimulated sciatic nerves showed some variability in the intensity needed to evoke movements across subjects and experiments. To check for possible confounding factors from absolute stimulation intensity or different anesthesia used (described above), motor thresholds for sciatic nerves stimulated with ES 20Hz, 0.2ms, constant current stimulation, from all experiments were analyzed (anesthesia mix, n=28; anesthesia mix+dorsal column lesion, n=26; isoflurane, n=70). In case of repeated stimulation, only the threshold from the first stimulation session was included. Motor thresholds across all subjects were similar and not significantly influenced by anesthesia or dorsal column lesions (ANOVA p>0.05, data not shown). A few outliers from the value of the mean motor threshold were identified (ROUT test, Q<1%, p<0.05) in some experiments, likely due to loose cuffs, but were included in the neurite growth analysis.\nElectrode impedance for cuff electrodes can vary considerably immediately after implantation, due to trapped air bubbles, which are slowly replaced by extracellular fluid (\nLoeb and Peck, 1996\n). Threshold measurements and stimulation were therefore initiated 5\u201310 min after implantation. Additionally, ES was done in a constant current regime, thus remaining effective irrespective of impedance changes (\nClark, 2006\n).\n\nIn vivo growth of sensory neurons after central lesion and cell injection\nFischer 344 rats were anesthetized with anesthesia mix as described above and underwent a dorsal column lesion (DCL) and injection of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) to fill the lesion, followed by either ES (n=7), or cuff electrodes implantation without stimulation (n=6). Cuffs were immediately removed after ES. Additional animals received either no manipulation of the sciatic (lesion only group) or CLs (n=6 each). To test if repeated ES could further increase growth in an in vivo setup, two additional groups with chronic implants with or without stimulation were examined, and a 1 h ES was repeated 7 days after the initial ES (n=6 each).\nDorsal column wire-knife lesion\nAnesthetized animals were placed in a stereotaxic unit, the skin was incised longitudinally between C3 and C7 and the posterior arch of the vertebrae was exposed. A posterior laminectomy was performed at the C4 vertebra using a small rongeur and the spinal cord was exposed. A wire-knife (McHughMilieux) was first calibrated for depth of insertion and fixed into a stereotaxic micromanipulator. The spinal cord was punctured with a 30-gauge needle to insert the wire-knife 1.4 mm lateral to the midline, the wire was lowered to a depth of 1.1 mm ventral to the dorsal cord surface and extruded to form a 2.8 mm wide arc with the tip visible on the contralateral side of the posterior spinal cord just beneath the dura. The knife was slowly raised while pressing the spinal cord with a blunt tip, to ensure complete transection and was slowly retracted such that it did not penetrate the dura on the contralateral side. This lesion interrupts all dorsal column sensory fibers, leaving the dura and superficial blood vessels mostly intact (\nBlesch et al., 2012\n;\nKadoya et al., 2009\n). Immediately following the lesion, 2 \u03bcl of BMSCs (60.000 cells/\u03bcl in PBS with 1% glucose; passage 2\u20134) were injected through pulled glass micropipettes into the center of the lesion at a depth of 0.5 mm using a Picospritzer at a rate of 1 \u03bcl/min to provide a cellular substrate for axonal growth. Pipettes were left in place for 1 min after the injection to prevent extrusion of cells and then slowly withdrawn. Overlying muscle layers were sutured and the skin was stapled. BMSCs were isolated from of 2\u20134 month old GFP transgenic Fischer 344 rats (F344-Tg(UBC-EGFP)F455Rrrc; Missouri Rat Resource Center) ubiquitously expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the ubiquitin C promoter to identify grafted cells by GFP fluorescence as previously described (\nDobson et al., 1999\n;\nSandner et al., 2016\n). Briefly, bone marrow was harvested from tibias and femurs and cells were mechanically dissociated in Minimum Essential Medium alpha (\u03b1-MEM) (Merck Millipore) and recovered by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended and cultivated in \u03b1-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (\u03b1MEM-10% FBS) (PAA/GE Healthcare) and 100 U/ml penicillin/0.1 mg/l streptomycin (Invitrogen). After 3 days, the medium was changed and non-adherent cells were discarded. Adherent cells were incubated in fresh \u03b1MEM-10% FBS until cells were confluent.\nCTB tracing\nTo visualize ascending dorsal column sensory fibers, animals were injected with the transganglionic tracer, cholera toxin \u00df-subunit (CTB; List Biologicals; 1%; 2 \u03bcl per side) bilaterally into the sciatic nerves, 3 days prior to perfusions. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane, the sciatic nerve was exposed and the CTB was gently injected into the nerve with a Hamilton syringe, proximally to the crush or cuff location, as previously described (\nBlesch and Tuszynski, 2003\n). After 3 days (4 weeks post-lesion), rats were deeply anesthetized, transcardially perfused with ice cold saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB). The brain and spinal cord were isolated and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h followed by cryoprotection in 30% sucrose.\n\nHistology and immunohistochemistry\nCervical spinal cords including the lesion site were cut into 35 \u03bcm sagittal sections using a cryostat (CM 3000, Leica, Germany) and 8 free-floating series were collected. Sections were rinsed 3\u00d7 with TBS, incubated with 0.6% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 15 min, followed by 2 washes in TBS and blocking in 5% horse serum in TBST (TBS, 0.25% Triton X-100) for 1 h. Sections were incubated in goat anti-CTB antibody (List Biological, 1:80.000 in TBST, 1% horse serum) for 72 h at 4 \u00b0C, washed 3\u00d7 in TBS with 1% horse serum, and incubated with biotinylated horse anti-goat secondary antibody (Vector, 1:300 in TBS/1% horse serum) and avidin\u2013biotin\u2013peroxidase complex (ABC, Vector Laboratories) in TBS. The sections were treated with DAB substrate (Vector DAB kit, SK4100, Vector laboratories) for 3 min. After 3 washes, sections were blocked in 5% donkey serum for 1.5 h and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with antibodies against GFAP (Ms, Milipore, 1:1000) and GFP (Rb, Life Technologies, 1:750) diluted in TBST, 1% donkey serum. Sections were washed 2\u00d7 with TBS and incubated with secondary antibody for 2.5 h at RT (IgG Alexa Fluor 594 Invitrogen, Ms, 1:300, IgG 488 Molecular Probes, Rb, 1:1000), followed by 3 washes in TBS. Sections were mounted on Superfrost slides, dried for 30\u201360 min and coverslipped with Cytoseal.\n\nQuantification of axon growth within grafts\nSpinal cord sections (1 out of 8 series) were screened for CTB-labeled axons and visualized under epifluorescent illumination (Olympus BX53) to identify the lesion border by GFAP (astrocytes) and GFP (cell graft) immunolabeling. The host/graft interface was identified as a virtual line rostral to any GFAP positive cell bodies and the number of CTB-labeled axons encountered along the rostral host/graft interface and at distances of 50 \u03bcm, 100 \u03bcm, 250 \u03bcm and 500 \u03bcm rostral to the interface were counted using a 10\u00d7 ocular with a calibrated grid and a 40\u00d7 objective. All measurements from the same animal were summed for each category. For quantification of growth cones and retraction bulbs in graft or host tissue, sections were imaged on an upright microscope both in light level for CTB and in epifluorescence for GFAP (astrocytes) and GFP labeling (transplanted cells/cell graft), at 200\u00d7 magnification and image composites were assembled in CellO (Olympus), to cover the entire lesion area and CTB positive fibers with retraction bulbs in the caudal host tissue. The distance of all axon endings from the caudal GFAP-GFP border (retraction bulbs) and within the graft (growth cones/retraction bulbs) were measured using ImageJ. Counts were stacked into cumulative intervals for analysis (sum of the number of regenerated axons in 25\u03bcm or 50\u03bcm steps).\n\nSensory testing\nAnimals underwent sensory testing prior to dorsal column lesions and 4, 7, 14 and 24 days post-injury.\nVon Frey filaments\nAnimals were habituated for 1 h/day for 3 days prior to the first sensory testing and for 30 min immediately before each testing in individual Plexiglas enclosures on an elevated grid platform (Ugo Basile). Responses to von Frey filaments (Ugo Basile) were assessed by stimulating the plantar center of the hind paws. A positive response was noted when the paw was withdrawn from the filament. After testing of a paw, a brief rest period of 2\u20133 min was allowed before testing the other paw with the same filament. We used 5 filaments of different strengths with an average response rate of ~10% for the thinnest filament and ~90% for the thickest filament in normal animals. Each filament was applied 5\u00d7 per paw and the response rate was reported as percent response of all applications. If animals moved immediately after applying a filament instead of lifting the paw, the response was not considered and the filament was later reapplied.\nThermal sensitivity \u2013 Plantar Heater test (Hargreaves)\nAnimals were habituated for 1 h/day for 3 days prior to the first sensory testing and for 30 minutes immediately before every testing on an elevated glass platform in individual Plexiglas enclosures. Latency of hindlimb withdrawal in response to stimulation with a radiant heat source (Ugo Basile) was measured. The generator automatically stops upon paw withdrawal from the heat beam and the latency is electronically reported. We used an intensity of 60 units, corresponding to the upper mid emission range. If no paw withdrawal occurred after 30 seconds, the radiant source automatically stopped to prevent tissue damage and the animal was assigned the maximal withdrawal latency of 30 seconds. Each paw was assessed 4 times and the values were averaged. Testing was alternated between left and right foot with a delay for an individual paw of 10\u201312 minutes to prevent sensitization. If the enclosing had to be cleaned during testing, animals were allowed 5 more minutes of habitation before resuming measurements.\n\nData analysis and statistics\nAll samples from the same experiment were run in parallel, labeled and imaged together and assessed by an observer blinded to the nature of the experimental manipulation. Technical replicates were averaged. For in vitro neurite growth assays, data were normalized to values of sham-treated or na\u00efve animals processed on the same day. At least 2 sham conditions were performed per group of animals/day.\nStatistical comparisons were performed using GraphPad 7.0.1 software. Comparisons between 2 groups were performed by Student\u2019s t-test, and by one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for comparisons of multiple groups followed by post-hoc tests/comparisons as indicated. For analysis of branching, a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn\u2019s test was conducted due to unequal variances between groups. Statistical significance was accepted at p<0.05. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM), unless otherwise indicated."

    "Methods": "Animals and Treatment\nC57BL/6 (catalog # 000664), CX3CR1 reporter knock in (B6.129P-\nCx3cr1\ntm1Litt\n/J\n(catalog # 005582), and CCR2 reporter knock in (B6.129(Cg)-\nCcr2tm2.1Ifc\n/J, catalog # 017586) mice maintained on a congenic background were used for these studies and were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine). In these strains, a monomeric green fluorescent protein (GFP) (\nJung, et al. 2000\n) and red fluorescent protein (RFP) sequence replaces the coding sequence of the Fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) and chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (\nCcr2\n) gene (\nSaederup, et al. 2010\n), respectively, abolishing gene function.\nThe rAAV vectors, rAAV-CBA-EGFP (AAV2-GFP) and rAAV-CBA-Alpha-SYNUCLEIN (AAV2-SYN) were obtained from the University of North Carolina Vector Core via the Michael J. Fox Foundation research tools catalog. (\nhttps://www.michaeljfox.org/research/research-tools-catalogue.html\n). Male red/green and CCR2 knockout mice (8\u201312 weeks of age) were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and unilaterally or bilaterally injected with 2 \u03bcL of AAV2-SYN or AAV2-GFP (1.5 \u00d7 10\n13\nviral genome/mL diluted in sterile PBS) into the right SNpc as previously described (\nHarms, et al. 2013\n;\nLuk, et al. 2012\n;\nSt Martin, et al. 2007\n). Co-ordinates were anterior-posterior \u22123.2 mm from bregma, medio-lateral \u22121.2 mm from midline, and dorso-ventral \u22124.6 mm from dura. All research conducted on animals was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The pattern and extent of \u03b1-syn expression obtained\nin vivo\nafter intranigral injection of AAV2-SYN vectors has been reported previously and similar results were obtained in this study (\nCao, et al. 2010\n;\nHarms, et al. 2013\n;\nSt Martin, et al. 2007\n;\nTheodore, et al. 2008\n;\nThome, et al. 2016\n;\nThome, et al. 2015\n). These vectors produce localized transduction of neurons in the SNc ipsilateral to the injection site. The extent of transduction of SNpc neurons is typically approximately 50%, but does vary depending on the exact location of the injection site (\nSt Martin, et al. 2007\n). There is no significant \u03b1-syn expression observed in neurons on the contralateral side or in glia on either side. Western blot analysis of nigral tissue shows that these vectors lead to accumulation of human \u03b1-syn in both monomeric and high molecular weight forms (\nHarms et al., 2013\n).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAt 4 weeks and 6 months post-transduction, animals were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused, post-fixed for 24 hours, and cryoprotected as previously described (\nHarms, et al. 2013\n). Brains were frozen on dry ice and cryosectioned coronally on a sliding microtome (cut thickness: 40 \u03bcm); sections were collected serially throughout the striatum and SNpc, placed into tissue collection solution (50% 0.01 M PBS, 50% glycerol), and stored at \u221220\u00b0C for immunohistochemical analysis.\nFor fluorescent analysis, free-floating sections were labeled with anti-MHCII (M5/114.15.2, eBiosciences, 1:100) or anti-Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (Millipore, 1:2000) antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. Appropriate Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1:1000 (Life Technologies) were used at room temperature for 2.5 hours. Sections were mounted onto coated glass slides, and cover slips were added using Vectashield Hard Set mounting medium.\nFor TH neuron quantification using unbiased stereological analysis, free floating sections were stained as previously described (\nHarms, et al. 2013\n;\nLuk, et al. 2012\n;\nSt Martin, et al. 2007\n), coded, and analyzed with an Olympus BX51 microscope and MicroBrighfield software (MicroBrightfield Inc., Williston, VT).\n\nImaging and Quantification\nConfocal images were captured using a Leica TCS-SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope. Images were processed using the Leica LASAF software, exported and processed using Adobe Photoshop. For quantification of MHCII and LB509 staining, slides were observed using a Nikon Eclipse E800M fluorescent microscope. Coded slides were scored by using a numerical scale 0 (no staining) to 4 (most intense) by a single observer blind to the treatment paradigm (\nHarms, et al. 2013\n;\nThome, et al. 2015\n). TH, MHCII, and LB509 positive cells were manually differentiated under 40x magnification to differentiate cell size, shape, and morphology. Staining within the vicinity of viral transduction (SYN) was considered for scoring while staining immediately surrounding the needle tract was ignored. Scores obtained from 6\u20138 mice per group were plotted and statistically analyzed using the Mann Whitney test.\n\nMononuclear Cell Isolation and Flow Cytometry\nMononuclear cells were isolated from bilaterally transduced ventral midbrains using enzymatic digestion with 1 mg/mL Collagenase IV (Sigma) and 20 \u03bcg/mL DNAseI (Sigma) diluted in RPMI 1640 with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% L-glutamine from the pooled ventral midbrains of red/green na\u00efve mice or injected with AAV2-SYN or AAV2-GFP control (n=2\u20133/group). Mononuclear cells were isolated 2 and 4 weeks post transduction via 30/70% percoll gradient as previously described (\nQin, et al. 2012\n). Isolated cells were first blocked with Fc\u03b3 receptor 2.4G2 (1:500), surface stained for MHCII (M5/114.15.2, BioLegend), CD45 (clone 30-F11, BioLegend), Ly6C (clone HK1.4, BioLegend), Ly6G (clone 1A8, BioLegend), CD68 (clone FA-11, BioLegend), CD4 (clone GK1.5, BioLegend) and CD11b (clone M1/70, Biolegend) as previously described, analyzed using the LSR-II flow cytometer (BD biosciences) and data analyzed using FlowJo software. In each experiment, a fixable viability dye (Vibrant Aqua (eBioscience, 1:1000) was used per manufacturer\u2019s instruction.\nEach flow cytometry experiment involves 18 to 30 mice. Individual samples were formed by pooling 2\u20133 ventral midbrains (bilaterally injected), each from different animals. In each experiment, treatment groups (Na\u00efve, AAV2-GFP, AAV2-SYN) consisted of 3\u20134 of these independent samples. For flow cytometry analysis, the mean +/\u2212 SEM of the independent samples in each treatment group were plotted. One-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post hoc test were used to compare the groups."

    "Methods": "Animals\nC57BL/6 mice (Harlan Laboratories, Italy) were housed in a specific pathogen free vivarium at a constant temperature (21\u00b11\u00b0C) with a 12h light\u2013dark cycle and free access to food and water. The IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri (IRFMN) adheres to the principles set out in the following laws, regulations, and policies governing the care and use of laboratory animals: Italian Governing Law (D.lgs 26/2014; Authorization n.19/2008-A issued March 6, 2008 by Ministry of Health); Mario Negri Institutional Regulations and Policies providing internal authorization for persons conducting animal experiments (Quality Management System Certificate \u2013 UNI EN ISO 9001:2008 \u2013 Reg. No. 6121); the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (2011 edition) and EU directives and guidelines (EEC Council Directive 2010/63/UE).The Statement of Compliance (Assurance) with the Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals has been recently reviewed (9/9/2014) and will expire on September 30, 2019 (Animal Welfare Assurance #A5023-01). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and reduce the number of animals used.\n\nExperimental design\nSham and TBI mice (n=8/group) were longitudinally analyzed following the experimental plan shown in\nFig. 1A\n. Sensorimotor deficits were evaluated by neuroscore (1, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, 3 and 12 months) and beam walk tests (1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months) by the same operator for the entire duration of the study. Cognitive deficits were evaluated by Morris water maze test at 3 and 6 months. Imaging studies were done as T2 weighted (T2w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (1, 7 days, 1, 3, 12 months) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) MRI (1, 7 days, 1, 3, 6, 12 months). All mice were sacrificed at 12 months for histopathological analysis. Body weight at all time points was recorded in all mice (\nFig. 1B\n). TBI did not result in any acute mortality; one mouse died three months after injury.\nFigure 1. Experimental design and weights.\nOpen in a new tab\nMice were subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI) or sham injury. Functional deficits and MRI analysis were assessed at multiple intervals up to one year post injury/sham at the time points indicated (A). Both sham and TBI mice gained body weight over time (p<0.0001), with no significant difference between sham and TBI weight at any time. (B). Data are mean\u00b1SD, n=7\u20138.\n\nExperimental traumatic brain injury\nEight-week-old male mice were anesthetized with isoflurane inhalation (induction 3%; maintenance 1.5%) in an N\n2\nO/O\n2\n(70%/30%) mixture and placed in a stereotaxic frame. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C. Mice were then subjected to craniectomy followed by induction of CCI brain injury as previously described.\n26\n\u2013\n29\nBriefly, the injury was induced using a 3 mm diameter rigid impactor driven by a pneumatic piston rigidly mounted at an angle of 20\u00b0 from the vertical plane and applied vertically to the exposed dura mater, between bregma and lambda, over the left parieto-temporal cortex (antero-posteriority: \u22122.5 mm, laterality: \u22122.5 mm), at impactor velocity of 5m/s and deformation depth 1 mm, resulting in a severe level of injury.\n30\n,\n31\nThe craniotomy was then covered with a cranioplasty and the scalp sutured. Sham-operated mice received identical anesthesia and surgery without brain injury.\n\nBehavioural tests\nSensorimotor deficits were evaluated by neuroscore and beam walk tests, and cognitive deficits were evaluated by the Morris water maze test as previously described.\n26\n\u2013\n29\n,\n32\nNeuroscore\nMice were scored from 4 (normal) to 0 (severely impaired) for each of the following: (1) forelimb function during walking on the grid and flexion response during suspension by the tail; (2) hindlimb function during walking on the grid and extension during suspension by the tail; (3) resistance to lateral right and left push. The best score is 12.\nBeam walk\nThe beam walk test measures the number of foot faults of the mouse walking twice on an elevated, narrow wooden beam (5 mm wide and 100 cm long). Before each test, mice are trained in three habituation trials. Data are expressed as the sum of the number of foot faults during the two tests. The best score is 0.\nMorris water maze (MWM)\nA circular pool (1 m diameter) filled with water (18\u201320\u00b0C) made opaque with a nontoxic white paint, with a fixed submerged platform (1 cm below the water surface) was used. The learning task consisted of eight trials/day for four consecutive days for a total of 32 trials. Latencies to reach and climb onto the platform were recorded for each trial with a maximum of 60 sec per trial. Cognitive performance was obtained by averaging the latencies of each day (MWM learning task) and the latencies of 32 trials over the four days (all trials). Five days after the learning task, mice were tested for their ability to remember the location of the submerged platform (memory task). Animals were allowed to swim for 60sec with the platform removed, and their swim paths were recorded using a computerized video analysis system (Ethovision XT 5.0; Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands). A memory score was calculated to grade memory retention deficits in the different groups.\n33\nMice were tested twice (at 3 and 6 months) in the MWM, with the same protocol. The platform was placed in the southwest quadrant of the pool at three months and northeast at six months.\n\nMRI studies\nMice were anesthetized with isoflurane inhalation (induction 3%; maintenance 1.5%) in an N\n2\nO/O\n2\n(70%/30%) mixture. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C by warm water circulated in a heating cradle. Imaging was done on a 7T small-bore animal scanner (Bruker Biospec, Ettlingen, Germany). Two actively decoupled radio frequency (RF) coils were used: a volume coil of 7.2 cm diameter used as the transmitter and a surface coil as the receiver.\n32\n\nAcquisition\nBrain anatomical changes were evaluated in sagittal, 2D, T2-weighted RARE sequences. The morphological images were obtained with a voxel size of 117 x 147 x 300 \u03bcm (FOV 3 x 1.5 cm, matrix 256 x 102, slice thickness 300 \u03bcm), repetition time 5000 ms, effective echo time 36 ms with a RARE factor of 8, for 8 averages.\nDiffusion tensor data were acquired in coronal DTI echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences acquired with an in-plane image resolution of 107 x 107 \u03bcm (FOV 1.5 x 1.5 cm, acquisition matrix 140 x 140, slice thickness 1 mm); repetition time 3000 ms, echo time 36 ms. Four averages were used to boost the signal-to-noise ratio. For diffusion, encoding b factors of 0 (b\n0\nimage) and 800 mm\n2\n/s were used and diffusion-sensitizing gradients were applied along 19 isotropic directions of three-dimensional space.\n\nAnalysis\nDiffusion tensor analysis\nThe diffusion tensor was computed using the freely available software FSL.\n34\n\u2013\n36\nThe software reconstructs the diffusion tensor generating the three eigenvalue \u03bb\n1\n, \u03bb\n2\n, \u03bb\n3\nmaps and the associated eigenvectors (i.e. the three principal diffusion directions). The DTI indices fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD, 10\n\u22123\nmm\n2\n/s) are defined as follows:\n\u03bb\n\u00af\n=\n\u03bb\n1\n+\n\u03bb\n2\n+\n\u03bb\n3\n3\n(1)\nF\nA\n=\n3\n2\n(\n(\n\u03bb\n1\n-\n\u03bb\n\u00af\n)\n2\n+\n(\n\u03bb\n2\n-\n\u03bb\n\u00af\n)\n2\n+\n(\n\u03bb\n3\n-\n\u03bb\n\u00af\n)\n2\n\u2211\ni\n=\n1\n3\n\u03bb\ni\n2\n)\n(2)\n\u03bb\n\u2016\n=\n\u03bb\n1\n(3)\n\u03bb\n\u22a5\n=\n\u03bb\n2\n+\n\u03bb\n3\n2\n(4)\nwhich are mean diffusivity (MD, \u03bcm\n2\n/ms) (1), fractional anisotropy (FA) (2), axial diffusivity (AD, \u03bcm\n2\n/ms) (3) and radial diffusivity (RD, \u03bcm\n2\n/ms) (4). Regions of interest (ROI) were the corpus callosum (CC), external capsule (CE), cortex and thalamus and were selected manually by a trained expert following the Paxinos atlas.\n37\nThe whole CC and EC were selected for quantification as depicted in\nFig. 5A\n(five coronal sections 1 mm thick). In addition, for the 12 month time point, when contralateral white matter pathology emerged, we repeated the quantification restricting the ROIs in the contralateral (cl) hemisphere so the location and volume matched the remaining (r) il-CC and EC (\nSuppl. Fig. 1\n, rCC and rEC five coronal sections 1 mm of thick).\nFigure 5. Quantitative analysis of diffusion tensor imaging parameters in the white matter.\nOpen in a new tab\nDrawings represent the rostrocaudal ROI selection in the CC (red) and EC (green) in sham (left) and TBI (right) mice (A). Quantification of FA (B\u2013C), AD (D\u2013E), and RD (F\u2013G) in the CC (B, D, F) and EC (C, E, G). Compared to sham mice, TBI induced a reduction of FA in the il-CC (B) and il-EC (C). At 12 months after injury, FA was also reduced in the cl-CC (B) and cl-EC (C) compared to the corresponding areas in sham-operated mice. There were no differences observed in AD (D\u2013E). TBI increased RD in the il-CC (F) at late time points, with no changes in the EC (G). Data are mean\u00b1SD, n=7\u20138. Two-way ANOVA for repeated measurements followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 sham il vsTBI il; \u00b0\u00b0p<0.01, \u00b0\u00b0\u00b0 p<0.001 sham cl vs TBI cl.\nVolume analysis\nThe volume measurements of structural MRI images were obtained using Java-based custom-made software. ROI were selected manually by a trained expert following the Paxinos atlas.\n37\nTo obtain a 3D-reconstruction of lesion progression, manually segmented brain masks of a representative mouse were smoothed and brain surfaces visualized using MRIcroS (a matlab-based tool freely available at\nhttps://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricros/\n).\n\nTissue processing\nOne year after surgery, under deep anesthesia (Ketamine 20 mg + Medetomidine 0.2 mg), animals were transcardially perfused with 20 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) 0.1 mol/L, pH 7.4, followed by 50 mL of chilled paraformaldehyde (4%) in PBS. The brains were carefully removed from the skull and post-fixed for 6h at 4\u00b0C, then transferred to 30% sucrose in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer for 24h until equilibration. The brains were frozen by immersion in isopentane at \u221245\u00b0C for 3 min before being sealed into vials and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Coronal brain cryosections twenty \u03bcm thick were cut serially (from bregma +1 mm to bregma \u22124 mm) at 200 \u03bcm intervals and stained with Cresyl violet or Luxol fast blue/cresyl violet (LFB/CV) using standard histological protocols.\n22\n,\n29\nAxons were visualised using Palmgren's silver impregnation technique.\n38\nContusion volume was analysed as previously described.\n39\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemistry was done on 20 \u03bcm thick coronal sections, cryosectioned at \u221220\u00b0C and stored at 4\u00b0C in a solution of glycerol:PBS (1:1). After washing and hydration in PBS solution, sections were treated with H\n2\nO\n2\n1% for 10 min to inactivate endogenous peroxidase activity. Blocking solutions and incubation with primary antibodies were as follows:\nIBA1: blocking was achieved by applying 2% normal horse serum (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) in Optimax buffer (BioGenex,San Ramon, CA) for 30 min. Endogenous IgG was blocked using an avidin/biotin blocking kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vector Labs). Incubation with the primary antibody was then done overnight at 4\u00b0C with monoclonal rabbit anti-mouse IBA1 (1:200; Wako, Neuss, Germany) in a solution containing normal horse serum 2% in Optimax Buffer.\nCD68: blocking was achieved by applying 10% normal goat serum (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 0.1% Triton in PBS for 1h, followed by incubation with the primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C with monoclonal rat anti-mouse CD68 (1:200; Serotec, Kidlington, UK), 3% NGS, 0.1% Triton in PBS. GFAP: blocking was achieved by applying 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco, Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA), 0.5% Triton in PBS for 1h, followed by incubation with the primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C with monoclonal mouse anti-mouse GFAP (1:2000; Chemicon), 10% FCS, 0.5% Triton in PBS.\nAfter incubation in primary antibodies, sections were transferred to solutions containing secondary antibody for 1h, followed by avidin-biotin complex following manufacturer's instructions (VectaStain Kit, VectorLaboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) before visualisation of immunoreactivty with 3,3-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For each reaction, negative controls were run without the primary antibody. In each case, no staining was observed.\n\nSelection of region of interest for histopathological analysis\nSections were scanned at 20x using a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer 2.0-HT slide scanner, with the images viewed using the Slide Path Digital Image Hub application (Leica Microsystem). Alternatively, they were acquired at 20x by an Olympus BX-61-VS microscope, inter-faced with VS-ASW-FL software (Olympus Tokyo, Japan). Images were analysed using Fiji software (\nhttp://fiji.sc/Fiji\n). Regions of interest for DTI analysis (cortex, thalamus, CC and EC, as indicated in\nFig.2\n) were selected according to the Paxinos atlas.\n37\nThe coronal section with maximum lesion size (AP \u22121.6 mm from bregma\n40\n) was selected. The ipsilateral (il) cortex was analyzed over an area 1 mm deep from the edge of the contusion. A corresponding area of the contralateral (cl) hemisphere and sham animals was analysed. For the thalamus the analysis was done in the areas corresponding to the latero-dorsal and latero-posterior nuclei and the lateral geniculate complex. White matter areas (CC and EC) were disrupted by the focal trauma pathology in the il-hemisphere, so only the cl-hemisphere was quantified. The whole cl-CC was selected, and the cl-EC was analysed up to the lower limit of the primary somatosensory cortex. The whole selected regions of interest were analysed.\nFigure 2. Region of interest for histopathological analysis.\nOpen in a new tab\nDrawings represent the regions of interest selected for quantification in the corpus callosum (CC; red), external capsule (EC; green), cortex (blue) or thalamus (yellow) in sham (A) or TBI (B) mice.\n\nNeuronal cell count\nCoronal sections 20 \u03bcm thick were stained with cresyl violet. The entire sections were acquired at 20x with an Olympus BX-61 Virtual Stage microscope, with pixel size 0.346 \u03bcm. Acquisition was done over 10 \u03bcm thick stacks, with a step size of 2 \u03bcm. The different focal planes were merged into a single stack by mean intensity projection to ensure consistent focus throughout the sample. Neuronal count was done using an appropriate size threshold (25 \u03bcm\n2\n) to exclude small objects not representing an entire cell, such as ramification portions from out-of-focus cells.\n31\n,\n40\n\u2013\n42\nQuantification was done with Fiji software and neuronal cell loss was expressed as the number of neurons per mm\n2\n.\n\nQuantification of histological markers\nFor silver staining, sections were acquired at 40x with an Olympus BX-61 Virtual Stage microscope, with pixel size 0.173 \u03bcm. For IBA1, CD68 and GFAP, sections were acquired at 20x with an Olympus BX-61 Virtual Stage microscope, with pixel size 0.346 \u03bcm. Acquisition was done over 6 \u03bcm thick stacks, with step size 2 \u03bcm. The different focal planes were merged into a single stack by mean intensity projection to ensure consistent focus throughout the sample. Images were analysed using Fiji software. Data are expressed as positive pixels/total assessed pixels, and reported as the percentage stained area for subsequent statistical analysis.\n\nStatistical analysis\nMice were allocated to surgery by a list randomizer (\nhttp://www.random.org/list\n). All behavioral evaluations were done blinded to injury status. Data are presented as means and standard deviation of the mean (SD). For neuroscore, beam walk, Morris water maze, volumetric measurements and DTI data, groups were compared using a two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures, followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. For the sake of clarity, all the graphs referring to longitudinal analysis (behavior and MRI) report statistical significances between sham and TBI animals only, while longitudinal intra-group differences are reported in the text. For histological analysis, groups were compared using the unpaired t-test; p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Assumptions of normality were checked using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Standard software packages were utilised throughout (GraphPad Prism version 6.00, La Jolla, CA, USA)."

    "Methods": "Primary rat cortical neurons were maintained in classic Neurobasal\u00ae, or sequentially maintained in Neurocult\u00ae followed by BrainPhys\u00ae (hereafter simply referred to as \u201cBrainPhys\u00ae maintained neurons\u201d). The levels of axonal markers and proteins involved in neurotransmission were compared on day in vitro 10 (DIV10). BrainPhys\u00ae maintained neurons had higher levels of GluN2B, GluR1, Neurofilament light/heavy chain (NF-L & NF-H), and protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) vs. neurons in Neurobasal\u00ae. Mechanical stretch-injury (50ms/54% biaxial stretch) to BrainPhys\u00ae maintained neurons modestly (albeit significantly) increased 24h lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels but markedly decreased axonal NF-L levels post-injury vs. uninjured controls or neurons given a milder 38% stretch-injury. Furthermore, two 54% stretch-injuries (in tandem) exacerbated 24h LDH release, increased \u03b1-spectrin breakdown products (SBDPs), and decreased Tau levels. Also, BrainPhys\u00ae maintained cultures had decreased markers of cell damage 24h after a single 54% stretch-injury vs. neurons in Neurobasal\u00ae. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that lentivirus mediated overexpression of the pro-death protein RBM5 exacerbates neuronal and/or axonal injury in primary CNS cultures. RBM5 overexpression vs. empty-vector controls increased 24h LDH release, and SBDP levels, after a single 54% stretch-injury but did not affect NF-L levels or Tau."

    "Methods": "2.1 Cell culture and treatment\nNCCs (JoMa1.3 cells) were cultured on cell culture dishes coated with fibronectin as previously described [\n10\n]. NCCs were pre-treated with or without 1 \u00b5M SFN (LKT Laboratories, St. Paul, MN) for 24 hours. The cells pre-treated without SFN were exposed to 50 mM ethanol alone for 24 hours. The cells pre-treated with SFN were followed by concurrent exposure to SFN and ethanol for additional 24 hours. The stable ethanol level was kept by placing the cell culture dishes in a plastic container containing 50 mM ethanol in distilled water [\n7\n].\n\n2.2 Animal care and treatment\nC57BL\n/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were mated for 2 hours early in the light cycle. The time of vaginal plug detection was considered 0 days, 0 h of gestation (GD0:0). Pregnant mice in the experimental groups were given an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of SFN at a dosage of 40 mg/kg maternal body weight or PBS on GD 8:12 and then were administered two i.p. doses of ethanol at a dosage of 1.9 g/kg maternal body weight on GD 9:0 and GD 9:4. Control mice were injected with PBS according to the above regimen. Pregnant females were killed by cervical dislocation on GD 9:12 and the embryos were collected for protein preparation. All protocols used in this study were approved by the University of Louisville Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n2.3 Nuclear Extraction and HDAC activity assay\nNuclear extracts were isolated from control and treated NCCs by using the EpiQuik Nuclear Extraction Kit (Epigentek, Brooklyn, NY), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The protein concentration of nuclear extracts was measured by BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Total HDAC activity was measured using the Fluor-de-Lys\u00ae HDAC Fluorometric Activity Assay Kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY). In brief, 10 \u00b5g (3\u20135 \u00b5l) of nuclear extracts and 20\u201322 \u00b5l of assay buffer were added to each well. Then the diluted substrates (25 \u00b5l) were added to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of the assay developer. After incubation with the assay developer for 15 min at room temperature, the activity of HDAC were determined using a multi-mode microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm.\n\n2.4 Quantitative real-time PCR analysis\nTotal RNAs were isolated from NCCs treated with SFN or ethanol using the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a Rotor-Gene Q real-time thermal cycler (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with the FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master qPCR kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The following primer pairs were used: Bcl-2: forward: 5\u2032-GAACTGGGGGAGGATTGTGG-3\u2032; reverse: 5\u2032-GCATGCTGGGGCCATATAGT -3\u2032; \u03b2-actin: forward: 5\u2032-AGCCTTCCTTCTTGGGTATGGAATC-3\u2032; reverse: 5\u2032-GGAGCAATGATCTTGATCTTCATGG-3\u2032. The relative changes in gene expression were analyzed by comparing threshold cycle number of Bcl-2 and a reference \u03b2-actin mRNA as described previously [\n7\n].\n\n2.5 Western blotting\nWestern blotting was performed as described previously [\n7\n]. The protein levels of Acetyl-Histone H3, Histone H3, Histone 2B, Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase-3 were analyzed with the following antibodies, respectively: Acetyl-Histone H3 (Millipore, Temecula, CA), Histone H3 (Millipore, Temecula, CA), Histone 2B (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), Bcl-2 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), and Cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175) Rabbit pAb (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). The membranes were developed on a Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS+ System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and the intensity of the protein band was analyzed by ImageJ software (1.46b, National Institutes of Health, USA). All Western blot analyses were performed in triplicate.\n\n2.6 ChIP-qPCR analysis of acetyl-histone H3 binding to Bcl-2 promoter\nChromatin preparation and immunoprecipitation from NCCs were carried out with Acetyl-Histone H3 Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay Kit (Millipore, Temecula, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, NCCs were collected from different groups and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. Cross-linking was blocked, and the cells were washed, scraped into conical tubes and lysed in SDS lysis buffer. The lysates were sonicated to shear DNA to the length between 200 and 1000 base pairs with 5 sets of 10-second pulses using a QSonica Q125 sonicator (QSonica, Newtown, CT). This standardized sonicated condition was used in all samples. After centrifugation and dilution with ChIP dilution buffer, 1% of the diluted cell supernatant (around 20 \u00b5L) was reserved as an input sample. The supernatant was pre-cleared with Salmon Sperm DNA/protein A agarose beads for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C with agitation. The antibody against acetyl-Histone H3 (1\u00b5g) (Millipore, Temecula, CA) was then added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with rotation, and then incubated with 60 \u00b5l Salmon Sperm DNA/protein A agarose beads for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. The Immunoprecipitated complex was then washed and eluted. The histone-DNA crosslinks were reversed, and DNA was purified for Real-time PCR assay. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on bound and input DNAs with the following primers for Bcl-2: forward: 5\u2032-AAAGAGCTGGATTATAACTA-3\u2032; reverse: 5\u2032-CTTGCGCCATCCTTCCCCGAAAA-3\u2032;\n\n2.7 Analysis of apoptosis\nApoptosis was determined by the analysis of cleavage of caspase-3 and its activity, and TUNEL assay as previously described [\n10\n]. Caspase-3 cleavage was determined by Western blot. Caspase activity was determined by using Caspase-Glo\u00ae 3/7 Assay Systems (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. TUNEL assay was performed by using a TiterTACS In Situ Detection Kit (Trevigen, MD, USA), following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols.\n\n2.8 Statistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed as previously described [\n7\n] by using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). All data were expressed as means \u00b1 SD of three separate experiments. The difference between groups was compared by One-way ANOVA. Differences between groups were considered significant at\np\n< 0.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Experimental animals and group allocation\nTotal 85 eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Portage, MI). Animals were maintained at 20 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C and housed in a 12-h light-dark cycle with access to food and water ad libitum. Mice were randomly divided into 2 major groups and 7 subgroups using a sequence of computer-generated random numbers. Two major groups include 1) negative control (n = 41); and 2) miR-210-LNA treatment (n = 44). Experimental subgroups were listed as followed: Group 1: infarction and behavioral function assays after pre-treatment (n = 5 each group); Group 2: quantitative real-time PCR of cytokines and chemokines (n = 4 and 5 in negative control group and treatment group respectively at 6, 12 and 24 h post-MCAO); Group 3: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) of chemokines (n = 4 each group); Group 4: Flow cytometry analysis of immune cells (n = 5 each group); Group 5: Immunofluorescence analysis of reactive microglia (n = 4 each group); Group 6: infarction and behavioral function assays for post-treatment (n = 5 each group); Group 7: long-term investigation of functional recovery after post-treatment (n = 6 each group). All the experimental procedures and protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Loma Linda University and followed the guidelines by National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\n2.2. Animal model of focal cerebral ischemia\nFocal cerebral ischemia was induced by intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as described previously (\nHuang et al., 2014\n). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane using a face mask. Under a microscope, the left common carotid artery and external carotid artery were exposed through a midline neck incision. A 6\u20130 nylon monofilament coated with silicon rubber (Doccol) was introduced into the left internal carotid artery through the external carotid stump to occlude the origin of the MCA and block blood flow to the striatum and cortex. After 60 min of occlusion, reperfusion was introduced by filament withdrawal, and the incision was sutured. Throughout the whole procedure, body temperature was maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C. The surgeon was blinded to the animal grouping. No animal died during MCAO procedure. The mortality of follow-up study was 15% in negative control group and 12% in miR-210-LNA treatment group. To compensate the dropouts, eleven additional mice (six for the negative control group and five for the treatment group) were recruited to the study population. Overall 96 mice were used in our study.\n\n2.3. Intracerebroventricular injection (i.c.v)\nAdult C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA). The ocular ointment was applied to the eyes to prevent drying, animal heads were wiped with 70% ethanol, and the skin on the head was cut open at the midline. A small burr hole (0.5 mm diameter, F.S.T.) was drilled into the skull (0.3 mm posterior to bregma; 1.0 mm lateral to sagittal suture). MiR-210-LNA (Exiqon) and the negative control - LNA scrambled oligonucleotides (miRCURY LNA Power Inhibitor control, #199006\u2013111, Exiqon), were prepared according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The miR-210-LNA sequence was AGCCGCTGT CACACGCACA. The LNA scrambled control sequence was TAACACGTCTATACGCCCA, which has no known microRNA targets in miRase (\nwww.mirbase.org\n). 100 pmol miR-210-LNA or the negative control with a total volume of 4 \u03bcl were injected over a 5-minute period into the left lateral ventricle (depth: 3.0 mm dorsal), 24 h prior to (Pretreatment study) or 4 h after (Post-treatment study) MCAO. The wound was closed with suture, and mice were waiting to wake up on a heating pad.\n\n2.4. MRI\nMRI was performed on a Bruker 11.7-T BioSpec (Billerica, MA, USA). Body temperature was monitored and maintained at 37.0 \u00b1 1.0 \u00b0C during MRI scan, using a thermostatically controlled water flow system. T2-weighted image was acquired on 2 days after MCAO, with following parameters: TR/TE = 4600/90 ms, Field of view (FOV) = 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm, slice thickness = 1 mm, interslice distance = 1 mm, number of slices = 20, matrix = 128 \u00d7 128, number of average = 2. Infarct volume was quantified by blinded observer, based on the previously reported method (\nHuang et al., 2017\n), using Mango and ImageJ. The threshold of signal intensity was determined from contralateral hemisphere in each slice and used for identifying normal brain region in the stroke-affected hemisphere. Irregular regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn to encircle the infarction exhibited as a hyperintense signal within abnormal brain region in each slice. The whole infarct volume was equal to the summed infarct areas multiplied by the slice thickness. Edema correction was also performed, and infarction was expressed as a percentage of infarct volume to the volume of the contralateral hemisphere. The equations used to calculate uncorrected (%HLV\nu\n) and edema-corrected lesion volume (%HLV\ne\n) were as follows: %HLV\nu\n= [2\u00b7(infarct volume)/(ipsilateral hemisphere volume + contralateral hemisphere volume)]\u00b7100; %HLV\ne\n= [(contralateral hemisphere volume \u2013 ipsilateral hemisphere volume + infarct volume)/contralateral hemisphere volume]\u00b7100. The space-occupying effect due to brain edema (%HSE) was also calculated as previously described (\nGerriets et al., 2004\n): %HSE = %HLV\nu\n\u2212 % HLV\ne\n.\n\n2.5. Behavioral tests\nBehavioral tests were performed with the neurological score test and foot-fault test. Each mouse was subjected to the tests on 1 day before and on 2 days after MCAO. The neurological score test was based on the 18-points graded scoring system (\nGarcia et al., 1995\n). This scoring system consisted six trials, including spontaneous activity, symmetry in the movement of limbs, forepaw outstretching, climbing, body proprioception and response to vibrissae touch. The lower the score is, the more severe the injury is. The test was videotaped, and the scores were analyzed by an observer blinded to experimental groups. The foot-fault test measures the forelimb misplacement on a grid during locomotion. The performance of mouse was videotaped for 5 min or until 50 steps were taken with one forelimb. The total number of step and number of times each forelimb fell below the grid were counted by an observer blinded o experimental groups. The percentage of footfaults for right forelimb (affected by the stroke) to total steps was calculated and presented, as previous reported (\nHuang et al., 2017\n). The foot fault test was performed 10, 20 and 30 days after MCAO for long-term behavioral evaluation.\n\n2.6. Measurement of miR-210\nTotal RNA was extracted from ipsilateral and contralateral mouse brain tissues 24 h after MCAO. MiR-210 abundance was determined using miScript II RT kit (Qiagen) and miScript SYBR Green PCR kit with miScript Primer Assay kit (Qiagen), as previously described (\nMa et al., 2016\n). Primers included miR-210 miScript Primer Assay (Mm_miR-210_2; MS00032564; Qiagen) and SNORD61 miScript Primer Assay (Hs_SNORD61_11; MS00033705; Qiagen). PCR was performed in triplicate, and threshold cycle numbers were averaged for each sample.\n\n2.7. Real-time PCR for expression of inflammation-related genes\nTotal RNA was extracted from ipsilateral and contralateral mouse brain tissues 6, 12, and 24 h after MCAO, using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was made using Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Target gene mRNA abundance was determined by real-time PCR using SYBR Green Supermix (Biomake). PCR reaction conditions were a 5-minute hold at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of activation for 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and annealing/extending for 60 s at 60 \u00b0C. Primers used were listed in\nSupplement Table 1\n. PCR reactions were carried out in triplicate, and threshold cycle numbers were averaged for each sample. Ct values were normalized relative to GAPDH. The Livak (2\n\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct\n) method was used to calculate changes in target gene expression relative to the contralateral hemisphere of the negative control group.\n\n2.8. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for chemokine quantification\nIpsilateral and contralateral mouse brain tissues 24 h after MCAO were homogenized in lysis buffer (150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris HCl, 10 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% Triton, 0.1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin, and 5 \u03bcg/mL aprotinin, pH 7.4). Protein was extracted by centrifuging with 14,000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. Total protein concentration was determined by bicinchoinic acid (BCA) protein assay (#23227, Thermo Scientific). Levels of chemokine CCL2 and CCL3 were quantified using ELISA Kit (CCL2: #MJE00, R & D systems, Inc.; CCL3: #EMCCL3, Thermo Scientific), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All samples were analyzed in duplicates and the data were normalized to the concentration of chemokine in 1 mg/ml of total protein of lysates.\n\n2.9. Cell isolation and flow cytometry\nTwenty-four hours after stroke, the mouse brain was isolated and divided into contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres after removing the cerebellum. The mononuclear cells were separated through the 70/30% percoll gradients, as previously described (\nPino and Cardona, 2011\n). Briefly, the hemisphere was mechanically dissociated in RPMI buffer and passed through 40-\u03bcm nylon cell strainer. The cell pellet was resuspended in 7 mL 30% percoll and layered it on top of 70% percoll. The solution was then centrifuged for 30 min at 500 g at room temperature in the absence of a brake. The cells were collected from the interphase of two density gradients. After been washed twice, the isolated cells were incubated with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (Biolegend) to block Fc fragment receptor (FcR), and stained with a mix of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for 20mins at 4 \u00b0C. The antibodies were used as follows: Fixable viability dye eF506 (eBioscience), CD45-Alexa Fluor\u00ae647(#103123, Biolegend), CD11b-Alexa Fluor\u00ae488(#101219, Biolegend), CD11c-Pacific Blue (#117321, Biolegend), CD3-PE (#100205, Biolegend), and CD8a-APC (#100765, Biolegend). After washes, cells were resuspended in 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed in an MACSQuant Analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec). The multi-color compensation was performed using MACS Comp bead kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Flowmagic and FlowJo software were used for analysis. Cell gating was performed to identify immune cells, as the previous report (\nGelderblom et al., 2009\n). Dead cells were excluded based on viability dye staining. Cells were then gated for CD45 high and CD45 intermediate populations. CD11b\n+\n/CD11c\n\u2212\nmacrophages and CD3\n+\n/CD8\n+\nT-cells were separated from the former population; CD45\nintermediate+\n/CD11b\n+\npopulation were separated from the latter population and considered as microglia cells (\nFord et al., 1995\n;\nGelderblom et al., 2009\n).\n\n2.10. Immunohistochemistry\nTwenty-four hours after stroke, mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused, first with normal saline, then with a solution of phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution. Brain samples were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h and dehydrated; coronal sections (20 \u03bcm) were prepared using a Leica cryostat. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation in 10% goat serum in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Tween 20, 0.3% Triton X-100. Sections were then incubated with primary antibody (rabbit Anti-Iba-1, 1:300, Wako) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. After washed for three times with PBS, the slices were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen, 1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. Brain slices were mounted and coverslipped, using mounting media (Vector Labs). All slices were scanned with a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscopy (Zeiss). For quantification of active microglia cells, 4 randomly selected fields (0.07 mm\n2\n) from the ipsilateral and contralateral cortex of stroke were analyzed in 3 nonadjacent sections (100 \u03bcm apart) by the investigator who blinded to the experimental groups. Images were captured at 20\u00d7 magnification. Average body size of rest microglia in the contralateral cortex was quantified. ImageJ was used to exclude rest microglia (Iba-1\n+\n, ramified shape and body size < 25 \u03bcm\n2\n) and calculate the average number of active microglia (Iba-1 staining positive, amoeboid shape and body size over 25 \u03bcm\n2\n) per field.\n\n2.11. Statistical analysis\nData were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. The Infarction and edema caused space-occupying effect (%HSE) were compared between groups using Student\u2019s unpaired t-tests. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey\u2019s test was used for comparing cytokine expression time course. Two-way ANOVA with post-hoc Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test was used for analyzing the data of miR-210 abundance, functional evaluation, expression of cytokines and chemokines, protein level of chemokines, immune cell infiltration and microglial activation.\nP\n< 0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Animal Use, Surgeries, and Intraocular Injections\nAnimal studies were performed at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital with approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were housed in the animal facility with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (lights on from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM) and a maximum of five adult mice per cage. The study used wild-type C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory). Optic nerve surgeries and intravitreal injections were carried out on male mice 8\u201310 weeks of age (average body weight, 20\u201326 g) under general anesthesia, as described previously (\nde Lima et al., 2012b\n;\nLi et al., 2017\n;\nYin et al., 2006\n)\nViruses (3 \u03bcl per eye) were injected intravitreally, avoiding injury to the lens, in 8 week-old mice, 2 weeks prior to optic nerve surgery. This lead time allowed for sufficient transduction and expression of the shRNA to knock down expression of Klf9 in RGCs at the time of ONC. The viruses included AAV2 expressing anti-KLF9 shRNAs (target sequences are as follows: 5\u2032-GGAGGCGCTGCCGGTTACGTA-3\u2032, 5\u2032-TGGCTGCCCAGTGTCTGGTTT-3\u2032, 5\u2032-CGGGGGACACCTGGAAGGATT-3\u2032, and 5\u2032-GCAAATAAATGCTTTTGGTAC-3\u2032) and a GFP reporter (1 \u00d7 10\n12\nGC/mL; the Miami Project Viral Vector Core, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL) to knockdown the\nKlf9\ngene expression in RGCs; and as a control, AAV2 expressing a GFP reporter (1 \u00d7 10\n12\nGC/mL; Viral Vector Core, Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, Bos-ton, MA). Agents (3 \u03bcl per eye) were injected intravitreally immediately after ONC, including recombinant Oncomodulin (15 ng/\u03bcl; as described previously (\nYin et al., 2006\n); 8-(4-chlorophenylthio) (CPT)-cAMP (50 \u03bcM; Sigma), a membrane permeable, nonhydrolyzable cAMP analog; the specific Zn\n2+\nchelator TPEN (100 \u03bcM, Calbiochem), also injected 4 days later, as described (\nLi et al., 2017\n); and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 1X) as a vehicle control.\nInvestigators performing the surgeries, injections, and quantifications were masked to the treatment identity (i.e., tube with virus or drug was prepared and coded by another researcher) until the end of the experiment, and the animals that received viral injections were randomly pulled for subsequent injections of different drugs or PBS control. A few animals that developed cataract in the injured eye were excluded.\n\nHistological Procedures\nStandard histological procedures were used, as described previously (\nde Lima et al., 2012b\n;\nKurimoto et al., 2010\n;\nLi et al., 2017\n;\nYin et al., 2006\n). Briefly, anesthetized mice were transcardially perfused with isotonic saline followed by 4% paraformal-dehyde (PFA) at 2 or 6 weeks after optic nerve injury, the eyes, optic nerves, and the optic chi-asms were dissected, postfixed 2 hours, the retinas were dissected-out, and optic nerves and the optic chiasms were transferred to 30% sucrose overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Free-floating retinas were immunostained in 24-well plate wells and, after making 4 symmetrical slits, flat-mounted on coated glass slides for imaging. The optic nerves and the optic chiasms were embedded in OCT Tissue Tek Medium (Sakura Finetek), frozen, cryostat-sectioned at 14 \u03bcm (longitudinally for the optic nerves and horizontally for the optic chiasms), immunostained on coated glass slides, and then mounted for imaging. For immunostaining, the retinas and tissue sections were blocked with the appropriate sera, incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with primary antibodies described in the main text, then washed three times, incubated with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies (1:500; Alexa Fluor, Life Technologies) 3 hours at room temperature, washed three times again, and mounted. Images were acquired using fluorescent microscope (E800, Nikon).\n\nQuantitation of Axon Regeneration and RGC Survival\nRegenerating axons were visualized at 2 weeks after optic nerve injury by immunostaining with a GAP-43 antibody [1:2,000; custom-made in sheep (\nBenowitz et al., 1988\n)] and at 6 weeks after optic nerve injury by immunostaining for the cholera toxin B fragment (CTB, 1% in 3 \u03bcl; List Biological), which was injected intravitreally 2 days prior to sacrifice (anti-CTB 1:500, rabbit polyclonal; GenWay, #GWB-7B96E4). Sections were examined for possible axon sparing; no spared axons were found in controls and no evidence of axon sparing was found in experimental conditions (i.e., at 2 weeks after injury no axons were found beyond the initial segment of the optic chiasm and at 6 weeks no axons were found beyond the initial segment of the optic tract). Axons (defined as fibers continuous for > 100 \u03bcm, which are absent in controls and are discernible from background puncta and artefactual structures) were counted manually using fluorescent microscope (E800, Nikon) in at least 4 longitudinal sections per optic nerve at 0.5 mm, 1 mm, 2 mm, and 3 mm distances from the injury site (identified by the abrupt disruption of the densely packed axons near the optic nerve head, as marked by an asterisk in\nFigs. 2\nand\n6A\n), and these values were used to estimate the total number of regenerating axons per nerve, as described (\nde Lima et al., 2012b\n;\nYin et al., 2006\n).\nRGC survival was quantified as in earlier studies from our laboratory and others (\nde Lima et al., 2012b\n;\nGuo et al., 2016\n;\nKurimoto et al., 2010\n;\nLeon et al., 2000\n;\nYin et al., 2009\n;\nYin et al., 2006\n), by immunostaining with an antibody to \u03b2III-tubulin (1:500, rabbit polyclonal; Abcam, #Ab18207), taking advantage of the selective expression of \u03b2III-tubulin in RGCs. ImageJ software was used to count \u03b2III-tubulin\n+\ncells from 6\u20138 images per retina (200\u00d7, E800; Nikon) taken at prespecified areas, at 1 mm and four at 2 mm from the optic nerve head in four directions, then averaged to estimate overall RGC survival per mm\n2\n.\n\nStatistical Analyses\nAll tissue processing, quantification, and data analysis were done masked throughout the study. Sample sizes were based on accepted standards in the literature and prior experiences from our laboratory. Sample size (\nn\n) represents total number of biological replicates in each condition. All experiments included appropriate controls. No cases were excluded in our data analysis, although a few animals that developed cataract in the injured eye were excluded from the study and their tissues were not processed. The data was analyzed by ANOVA, with Repeated Measures where appropriate, and a posthoc LSD test, or by unpaired Student\u2019s\nt\n-test, two-tailed (SPSS). Data are presented as Means \u00b1 SEM. All differences were considered significant at\np\n< 0.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Cell culture\nThe C3H/10T1/2 cell line was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM), with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in normal culture condition, and differentiated into pericytes by culturing with mouse transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2; 1 ng/ml, Invitrogen [Carlsbad, CA]) for at least 3 days before beginning experiments (\nBose et al., 2013\n). In some experiments, LRP1 knockdown and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transfection were performed in the cells. Single-stranded sense and antisense RNA oligonucleotides for mouse LRP1 were synthesized by Dharmacon (GE Healthcare; Lafayette, CO), and double-stranded RNA molecules were generated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. The sequences of the single-stranded RNAs were 5\u2032-GGA GUC ACU UAC AUC AAU AUU-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-UAU UGA UGU AAG UGA CUC CUU-3\u2032 (antisense). Non-targeting siRNA was also purchased from Dharmacon (GE Healthcare) and used as the control. For GFP transfection, the pmax GFP vector provided in Amaxa Basic Nucleofector Kit (Lonza; Cologne, Germany) was used. LRP1-siRNA (300 nM) or GFP plasmid vector (2 \u03bcg) was transfected into C3H/10T1/2 cell-derived pericytes by nucleofection using the Amaxa Basic Nucleofector Kit (Lonza) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (program A-033). Cells were cultured for an additional 48 hours before being used for experiments.\n\n2.2. Animals and cell injection\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Mayo Clinic and in accordance with the regulations of the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. APPswe/PSEN1\u0394E9 (APP/PS1) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (\nJankowsky et al., 2004\n). Both male and female APP/PS1 mice were subjected to intracranial cell implantation at the age of 18 to 20 months. The mice were subjected to anesthesia, and the skull was exposed by skin incision. Stereotaxically, holes were bored above both hemispheres (lateral 2.0 mm and posterior 2.0 mm from the bregma). C3H/10T1/2 cell-derived pericytes in 2 \u03bcl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 1\u00d710\n5\ncells/\u03bcl) were injected into the right hemisphere (depth 2.0 mm from surface of the skull) using a Hamilton Neuros Syringe (Reno, NV) with 33-gauge needle at a rate of 1 \u03bcl/min. After injection, the needle was held steady for 2 minutes, and then gradually withdrawn for 1 minute. In the same manner, PBS (2 \u03bcl) was injected in the left hemisphere as a control.\n\n2.3. Monitoring of brain microcirculation\nTo monitor cerebral microcirculation in real time, laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) technology was used through PeriCam PSI HR (Perimed AB, Sweden). The mouse was anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine, and placed on a small animal stereotaxic device equipped with a heating blanket to maintain body temperature. The surgical site was prepared by shaving, following transection of the skin along the midline to expose the skull to the anterior-posterior coordinates in the brain, bregma, and lambda. The cerebral microcirculation of the mouse was monitored for 5 to 10 minutes to ensure that stable perfusion was obtained. The region of interest was selected around the injection site in both hemispheres, and the average cerebral microcirculation rate was quantified.\n\n2.4. A\u03b2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\nMouse hippocampus samples were homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer (KINEMATICA; Lucerne, Switzerland) in 10 times volumes (w/v) of ice cold tris-buffered-saline with 1% triton-X (TBSX) containing cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche; Mannheim, Germany) and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor (Roche). After incubation with mild agitation at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour, samples were centrifuged at 100,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 60 minutes. The residual pellet was further homogenized in 5 M of guanidine hydrochloride (GDN-HCl; pH 7.6) and incubated with mild agitation at room temperature for 12 to 16 hours, followed by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 1 hour. Levels of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 were determined by ELISA as previously described (\nKanekiyo et al., 2013\n;\nLiu et al., 2017\n). Samples were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked streptavidin (Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA) and developed with 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Sigma-Aldrich; St Louis, MO) by a Synergy HT plate reader (BioTek Instruments; Winooski, VT) followed by colorimetric measurement. All measured values were normalized against protein concentration as determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce; Rockford, IL).\n\n2.5. Immunohistochemical analysis\nFrozen sections (30-\u03bcm thickness) were permeabilized in PBS with 0.3% triton X-100, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with anti-platelet\u2013derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) antibody (1:50, R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN) or anti-collagen IV antibody (1:100, EMD Millipore) at 4\u00b0C overnight followed by incubation with Alexa Flour 568 secondary antibody (1:200, Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA). Subsequently, sections were incubated with anti-GFP antibody (1:500, Aves Labs; Tigard, OR) at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by a secondary Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (1:200). Stained sections were captured using a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope. For the quantification of A\u03b2 plaque burden, frozen brain sections were stained by mouse monoclonal anti pan-A\u03b2 33.1.1 (human A\u03b2 1\u201316 specific) antibody, visualized with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB), and captured with an Aperio AT2 scanner (Aperio Technologies Inc; Vista, CA) (\nKanekiyo et al., 2013\n;\nKanekiyo et al., 2012\n;\nLiu et al., 2017\n). The immunoreactivity in the hippocampus was measured by ImageJ software in a blinded manner.\n\n2.6. Ex vivo cellular A\u03b2 clearance assay\nUsing APP/PS1 mouse brain slices,\nex vivo\ncellular A\u03b2 clearance assay was performed as previously described (\nKoistinaho et al., 2004\n;\nWyss-Coray et al., 2003\n;\nXiang et al., 2016\n), with some modifications. Briefly, brains from 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice were coronally cryostat-sectioned (10-\u03bcm thickness), mounted on poly-L-lysine\u2013coated coverslips (Neuvitro; Vancouver, WA), and transferred to 12 well plates. Sections were coated with gelatin (100 \u03bcg/cm\n2\n; Sigma) at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours, and incubated with or without C3H/10T1/2 cell-derived pericytes (6\u00d710\n5\ncells/well) in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours. For immunofluorescent staining, pericytes were stained with CM-DiI (Molecular Probes; Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol and cultured on the brain slices. After being fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, brain slices were immunostained with pan-A\u03b2 33.1.1 antibody at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody for 2 hours. For A\u03b242 measurement, cells were carefully removed by trypsin treatment at 37\u00b0C for 15 minutes. Brain sections were lysed in 5 M GDN-HCl (pH 7.6), incubated at room temperature for 12 to 16 hours using mild agitation, and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 1 hour. The supernatant was collected and subjected to A\u03b242 ELISA.\n\n2.7. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS)-based internalization assays\n5-carboxyfluoroscein (FAM)-A\u03b240 and FAM-A\u03b242 were purchased from AnaSpec Inc (Fremont, CA). The peptides were dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma), distilled with nitrogen, washed with 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol, and further distilled with nitrogen. FAM-A\u03b2 peptides were freshly dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 200 \u03bcM before each experiment. Cells were plated onto 12-well plates and allowed to grow to 90% confluency. Cells were then incubated with FAM-A\u03b240 (500 nM), FAM-A\u03b242 (500 nM), or Fluoresbrite YG Carboxylate Microspheres (1.1\u00d710\n7\nparticles/ml; Cat# 15702-10, Polysciences Inc; Warrington, PA) in DMEM with 10% FBS. Following incubation, cells were harvested using trypsin (Gibco) and resuspended in PBS containing 1.5% FBS, 1% sodium azide, and 1% paraformaldehyde. In each sample, 1\u00d710\n4\ncells were analyzed for the shift of fluorescence intensity using a FACSCalibur machine (BD Biosciences) (\nKanekiyo et al., 2013\n;\nKanekiyo et al., 2012\n;\nLiu et al., 2017\n).\n\n2.8. Western blotting\nSamples were lysed in Radioimmunoprecipitation Assay buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The same concentration of protein for each condition was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoreactivity was detected and quantified using the Odyssey CLx Imaging System (LI-COR Biotechnology; Lincoln, NE). In-house polyclonal anti-LRP1, anti-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and MMP9 (EMD Millipore; Billerica, MA), anti-IDE and anti-CD10 (Neprilysin; Abcam; Cambridge, United Kingdom), and anti-\u03b2-actin antibodies (Sigma) were used.\n\n2.9. Statistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using the 2-tailed Student\u2019s\nt\ntest (non-paired/paired) or ANOVA followed by post-hoc Tukey\u2019s test. A value of\nP<0.05\nwas considered statistically significant."

Rat axonal cultures\nTo create parallel lanes of axon fascicles spanning populations of neurons, a culture system was used as previously described in detail (\nTang-Schomer et al. 2010\n). Briefly, a molded elastomeric stamp with lithographically-fabricated micro-channels was placed against a deformable silicone membrane (0.002-in. thickness, Specialty Manufacturing) (\nFig. 1a\n). The channels (0.2 mm width \u00d7 2 mm length \u00d7 0.2 mm height) were pre-coated with 0.5 mg/ml polyethylenimine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5\u03bcg/cm\n2\nlaminin (BD Biosciences) to allow for axon-only longitudinal outgrowth to occur and functional connections to be made between the two cell populations.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nIn vitro model: dynamic stretch injury of axons.\nPulsed air pressure introduces uniaxial stretch on patterned longitudinally arranged axon tracts, simulating stretch injury of CNS axons during head trauma. (a) The culture well contains a deformable membrane onto which primary cortical neuronal cells are plated. (b) Two separate populations of cells are separated by a lithography fabricated micro-patterned barrier. Axonal processes extend through the 2 mm microchannels to integrate with the opposing population of neurons, thus creating a unique axon-only injury region. (c) Upon controlled delivery of air into a sealed chamber, the subsequent pressure change within the chamber allows the regionally specific deflection of the axon-only region.\nAll animal procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of Laboratory animals and protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Pennsylvania. Primary cortical neurons from male and female embryonic day 18 (E18) Sprague-Dawley pups (Charles River) were dissociated and plated at a density of 300,000 cells/ml on our deformable membrane. Male pups were identified by the presence of striated testes found just below the kidneys (\nFairbanks et al. 2013\n). Female pups were identified by the lack of testes and the presence of ovaries. Pup sex was confirmed by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for the male-specific gene SRY, with SRY not being observed in female pups.\nCells were plated and cultured in NeuroBasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B-27 neural supplement (Invitrogen), 400 \u03bcM L-glutamine (GlutaMAX, Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone). Twenty-four hours after initial plating, the micropatterned stamps were removed and the complete media was exchanged with P/S and FBS free media. Specifically, axonal processes started to enter the micro-channels within 3\u20134 days in culture. By 7\u201310 days in vitro, axons had traversed the channels to synapse with neuronal somata on the opposite side of the 2 mm long channels. A clear \u2018axon-only\u2019 region was thus defined between the independent neuronal populations, as shown previously\nFig. 1a\n) (\nTang-Schomer et al. 2010\n). Cultures were maintained for approximately 12\u201314 days before being injured or processed for transmission electron microscopy.\n2.1.2. Human axonal cultures\nWe pursued multiple sources to acquire female and male differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines obtained from healthy individuals (\nTable 1\n). These lines were differentiated into neurons by either overexpression of Neurogenin-2 (Ngn2) (\nZhang et al. 2013\n) or lack of morphogens (\nEspuny-Camacho et al. 2013\n) (generously donated by Dr. Isaac Chen of the Department of Neurosurgery, University of Pennsylvania). The lines used for Ngn2 overexpression were generated by the laboratory of Dr. Herbert Lachman using episomal plasmid based vectors (\nLin et al. 2016\n;\nPedrosa et al. 2011\n). Lines were confirmed for sex and absence of major CNVs by MLPA testing (\nVorstman et al. 2006\n). Differentiated iPSCs were plated on our micropatterned deformable membranes allowing for separation of cell soma region and creating an axon-only region. These iPSCs were cultured in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B-27 neural supplement (Invitrogen), 10 ng/ml brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF \u2013 Sigma-Aldrich), 10 ng/ml Neurotrophin-3 (Peprotech), 2\u03bcg/ml doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich), 6 mg/ml glucose (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 mM glutamax (Invitrogen). Prior to plating, the silicone membranes were precoated with 5% matrigel (Sigma-Aldrich). Differentiated iPSCs were plated at a density of 200,000\u2013800,000 cells/ml. Media was changed every three to four days, with 10\u03bcg/ml AraC added to cultures on Day 4. Cultures were maintained for approximately 17\u201319 days before being injured or processed for transmission electron microscopy.\nTable 1.\niPSC lines used.\nLine\nAge\nSex\n1BC4\n32\nFemale\n2C4\n60\nMale\n3113C4\n21\nFemale\n5C4\n34\nFemale\n553C2\n31\nMale\n6C4\n33\nMale\nWT1.1\n2\nFemale\nWT2.3\n3\nMale\nOpen in a new tab\nAll cells were manipulated and cultured in a sterile environment using good cell culture practice and routinely tested for mycoplasma using standard methods.\n\n2.2. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nUninjured control axons were fixed and processed for analysis using TEM. For each experimental condition, 4 independent cultures were processed. Specifically, cells were fixed with a mixture of 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight. After washing with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (3 \u00d7 10 min), cells were post-fixed with osmium (2%) plus potassium ferricyanide (1.5%), followed with three buffer washes and two diH\n2\nO washes. To enhance the intensity of cell membranes, cells were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 20 min, followed again with two diH\n2\nO washes. Serial dehydration was performed via 3 min incubations in 50%\u2013100% EtOH. Post-fixed cultures were embedded in resin in situ, separated from the silicone membrane, and re-embedded.\nA ~1 mm \u00d7 1 mm \u00d7 60 nm thickness region perpendicular to the middle of the axon-only region was cut. Axons were selected based on: the axolemma should be intact, no organelles should be present, and microtubules should be cross-sectionally cut (should have a round morphology). Axon area was measured using ImageJ (NIH, USA). Image analysis with respect to axon area and microtubule number was confirmed by blinded analysis.\n\n2.3. Mathematical model of axonal stretch injury\nWe used an established mathematical model of dynamic TAI (\nAhmadzadeh et al. 2014\n,\n2015\n) that previously demonstrated the viscoelastic response that results in immediate microutbule breakage due to axon stretch injury. Here, we set the axon geometry in the model to reflect the sex differences in axon diameter and microtubule number that was determined from the TEM analyses.\nIn this model, the axon is represented by a two-dimensional flattened layout of a longitudinal section through the axon (\nFig. 2a\n). The axon cytoskeleton model consists of a staggered array of parallel microtubules (with length\nL\n=100\n\u03bcm\n, outer and inner radii\nR\nO\n=12.5\nnm\nand\nR\nI\n=7\nnm\nand elastic modulus\nE\nm\n=1.9\nGPa\n) (\nLu et al., 2016\n), cross-linked by inverted pairs of tau proteins spaced at a distance\nd\nT\n=30\nnm\n(\nFig. 2a\n). The cross-linker proteins are modeled using viscoelastic elements i.e. with a spring and a dashpot placed in parallel (\nFig. 2b\n). The spring (with stiffness\nK\n=0.05\npN/nm\n) (\nSendek et al., 2014\n) represents the backbone stiffness of the cross-linker protein and the dashpot (with a relaxation time-scale\n\u03b7\n=0.35 sec) (\nSuresh, 2007\n) represents the stiffness that arises from its intra-molecular bonds at fast loading rates. In the present study, the model was modified to represent the relative difference in number of microtubules within smaller diameter (5 microtubules) and larger diameter (9 microtubules) rat cortical axons. (\nFig. 2a\n).\nFig. 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nMathematical model of axonal stretch injury for female and male axons. (a) The model incorporates interactions between microtubules, cross-linker proteins, actin filaments and the axolemma. Microtubules are placed in parallel and cross-linked by inverted pairs of cross-linker proteins. Female axons are assumed to have 5 microtubules and male axons 9 microtubules. (b) The binding between microtubules and cross linker proteins and microtubules and actin filaments (highlighted yellow box in (a)), is modeled using a viscoelastic element that consists of a spring and a dashpot.\nu\ni\n(\nx\n) and\nu\nj\n(\nx\n) are the longitudinal displacements in two neighboring microtubules where\ni\nand\nj\nare between 1 and 5 and 1 and 9 for female and male axons, respectively. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\nAs axons are loaded, mechanical forces are transmitted between neighboring microtubules through stretching of the cross-linker proteins, resulting in the sliding of microtubules. By defining the longitudinal displacements for the microtubules (\nu\ni\n(\nx\n) where\ni\ndenotes the microtubule labels as shown in\nFig. 2b\n), we can write the force-balance equations as (\nEq.

As has been previously demonstrated, microtubules adjacent to the membrane are anchored to actin filaments by microtubule/actin binding proteins (\nWegmann et al., 2011\n). We modeled these connections using a viscoelastic element, composed of a spring and a dashpot placed in parallel (\nFig. 2b\n). In order to ensure that the microtubule bundle is able to slide with respect to the axolemma in response to longitudinal strains, it was assumed that the microtubule/actin connections were weaker than the cross-linker/cross-linker connections. The spring stiffness for the microtubule/actin binding was assumed to be (\nK\na\n=0.01\nK\n) and for simplicity, its relaxation time is equal to the cross-linking protein relaxation time-scale (\n\u03b7\n=0.35 sec).\nThe force-balance equations for microtubules located at the periphery of the axon are (\nEq.

Here we have assumed a reference coordinate system placed at the center of the microtubules, in such a way that the\nx\n-axis is oriented along the length of the microtubules.\n\n2.4. In vitro dynamic stretch injury of axons\nAxonal stretch injury was performed using the established model, as described previously in detail (\nIwata et al. 2004\n;\nTang-Schomer et al. 2010\n;\nWolf et al. 2001\n). Notably, this model examines the response of unmyelinated axons to dynamic injury based on previous observations that approximately 50% of axons in many white matter tracts are unmyelinated (\nOzdogmus et al. 2009\n;\nSwadlow et al. 1980\n) and that these unmyelinated axons appear to be the more vulnerable to become damaged or dysfunctional following traumatic injury compared to myelinated axons (\nReeves et al. 2005\n;\nReeves et al. 2012\n;\nStaal and Vickers 2011\n).\nExperiments using rat cortical cells were performed at 12\u201314 days in vitro and those using differentiated human iPSCs were performed at 17\u201319 days in vitro. Notably, this is the first study to use human iPSC neurons in the axon stretch injury model. Culture wells were placed in a sealed, pressure controlled, device at an orientation aligning the region of cultured axons directly above a machined 2 \u00d7 15 mm slit in a metal plate (\nFig. 1b\n,\nc\n). A controlled air pulse was then injected into the sealed pressure chamber subjecting axons to a strain rate of 1 \u00d7 50 S\n\u22121\n(\nTang-Schomer et al. 2010\n). This pressure change within the chamber results in the rapid downward deflection of the axon-only region of membrane through the slit positioned below (\nFig. 1c\n). As such, only the axon-only region undergoes rapid stretch.\n\n2.5. Axonal undulation calculation\nWe have shown previously that the immediate breaking of axonal microtubules during injury impedes relaxation to pre-stretch length, thereby causing an undulated appearance. Undulating axons were randomly chosen. To measure the increase in localized axon length per undulation, calcium fluorescence images were taken before injury and immediately following injury. The percentage increase in length was calculated by subtracting the axon length before injury from the length immediately following injury and dividing by the original axon length.\n\n2.6. Intra-axonal calcium changes\nIntra-axonal calcium was monitored using the genetic calcium indicator GCaMP6 (University of Pennsylvania, Vector Core). Rat cells were transduced with GCaMP6 on day 5 for 24 h and differentiated human iPSCs for 90 h. Baseline fluorescence and changes in calcium concentrations were monitored before injury, and 5mins, 10mins, 15mins following injury. A potential caveat to the in vitro model is axon-to-axon connections which may affect fluorescence analysis. In order to minimize potential differences in numbers of axons analyzed (although these axonal aggregates appear to be similar in geometry between male and female cultures), uniform thickness and length regions of interest were selected across the width of the axon lane. At least four different regions of interest were selected outside of the axon lane, which represented background fluorescence values that were averaged, subtracted from the axonal regions of interest and the resulting fluorescence intensity normalized to intensity before injury. Data collection and analysis were performed by different experimenters yielding similar results.\n\n2.7. Axonal transport interruption\nIntra-axonal beta-tubulin accumulation has previously been shown to represent regions of axon transport interruption (\nTang-Schomer et al. 2012\n). Female and male rat cortical uninjured control and 24 h following stretch injury axon tracts, were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 0.1% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and immunostained with the primary antibody for beta-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, T8578, 1:500, RRID:AB_1841228) and Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen, A31571, 1:500) secondary antibody.\n\n2.8. Measuring functional intra-axonal calcium signaling\nIn order to assess the number of axons that were capable of transmitting calcium signals 24 h following stretch injury, female and male rat cortical axons were monitored using GCaMP6. These GCaMP6 positive axons were compared to the total number of axons in the same axon tract (which was confirmed by immunostaining for Tau (Dako, A0024)). Injured axon tracts were compared to uninjured control axon tracts.\n\n2.9. Statistical analyses\nValues are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (s.e.m). Statistical significance was evaluated using unpaired students\nt\n-test and\nP\n< 0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nStudies were conducted on 22 adult female Taconic Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Laboratories, Germantown, NY) overexpressing the human SOD1\nG93A\ngene (SOD1\nG93A\n). SOD1\nG93A\nexpression was detected with polymerase chain reaction of tail DNA using hSOD1 primers. Disease progression in female mutant (MT) rats is characterized by progressive weight loss, accompanied shortly by hindlimb and/or forelimb paralysis. Experiments were conducted when MT rats lost 20% from their peak body mass (\u201cend-stage;\u201d 172\u00b13 days); at this stage, rats exhibited limb paralysis. Measurements were compared between MT and wild-type littermates (WT). Average body weights of rats on experimental days were 293\u00b13 for WT and 230\u00b111g for MT. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and were in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nSurgery and Electrode Implantation\nAnesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane, and maintained at 2\u20132.5% isoflurane throughout surgical procedures, initially with a nose cone and then via tracheal cannula (50% O\n2\n, balance N\n2\n). Body temperature was maintained at ~37\u00b0C with a custom-made heating table and a rectal thermometer (Physitemp, model 700 1H). The right femoral vein was catheterized to enable intravenous (i.v.) fluid delivery. Lactated Ringer\u2019s solution with sodium bicarbonate was given as necessary to ensure fluid and acid-base balance. Blood gases and pH were measured in samples taken from a femoral arterial catheter (~0.3 ml; ABL800, Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). Following laparotomy, diaphragm muscle was implanted with a pair of Teflon-coated, multistrand stainless-steel electrodes (AS631, Cooner Wire, Chatsworth, CA) uninsulated for ~2 mm at the point of contact with in the mid-costal region. In addition, the 2nd and 5th external intercostal muscles (EIC2 and EIC5) were implanted with EMG electrodes. Once surgery was complete, anesthesia was gradually converted to urethane (1.6 g/kg, i.v.) while isoflurane was slowly withdrawn. After conversion, the depth of anesthesia was confirmed by the absence of tail- and toe-pinch reflexes. Rats were given ample time to clear isoflurane from the body before experiments commenced (the same amount of time that they were on isoflurane).\n\nEMG and Transdiaphragmatic Pressure Recordings\nEMG signals were amplified (1000x) and band-pass filtered (10\u20131000 Hz) using an analog amplifier (Model 1800, A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA, USA). They were digitized at 2 kHz and recorded (Powerlab, AD Instruments, Colorado, United States). EMG amplitude was estimated using root-mean-squared (RMS) EMG calculated over a 50-ms sliding window. RMS EMG value is a measure of the power of a signal and well correlated with force generated by various muscles including diaphragm muscle (\nFuglevand et al., 1993\n;\nLawrence and De Luca, 1983\n;\nMantilla et al., 2010\n).\nTo estimate pressure differences generated by diaphragm contractions\nin vivo\n, transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) was measured as the difference between esophageal (P\neso\n) and gastric (P\ngas\n) pressures (BD RT2000, BD, New Jersey, United States). Esophageal and gastric pressures were measured using dedicated catheters passing through the mouth. Initially, the catheter depth was estimated via the approximate positions of stomach and esophagus; the same length was marked on the catheters. After insertion, each transducer was adjusted to obtain consistent recordings. Gastric placement was further verified by a positive pressure in response to a gentle abdominal finger poke.\nDuring inspiratory activity, esophageal recordings consistently display negative pressure swings; abdominal recordings display positive pressure swings. Reported Pdi values are the pressure difference at the peak of inspiration between esophageal and gastric values (P\ngas\n\u2212 P\neso\n). Pressure signals were low-pass filtered (cut-off frequency: 100 Hz; Model P122, Grass Technologies, Rhode Island, United States) and digitally sampled at 200 Hz. Others have proposed that the \u0394P\neso\n/\u0394P\ngas\nratio enables dissection of the relative contributions of diaphragm versus thoracic accessory muscles (i.e., such as intercostal muscles) to breathing (\nMacklem et al., 1978\n). Accordingly, diaphragm dysfunction reduces \u0394P\ngas\n; however, \u0394P\neso\nmay be compensated by recruitment of accessory muscles. In that case, \u0394P\neso\n/\u0394P\ngas\nratio increases, consistent with increased intercostal contributions. In the case of complete diaphragm paralysis, diaphragm moves in rostral direction (i.e., paradoxical diaphragm movement) leading to negative \u0394P\ngas\n. Thus, \u0394P\neso\n/\u0394P\ngas\nratio changes its sign and becomes negative.\n\nExperimental Protocol\nSpontaneous EMG activities of diaphragm, EIC2 and EIC5 muscles were recorded across all experimental conditions in spontaneously breathing rats in a supine position. Before starting experiments, arterial blood samples were taken to monitor and correct blood gases, pH and base excess. The rats were tested under the following conditions: (1) Normoxia (Nx): Blood gas values were kept at >85 mmHg and ~45 mmHg for PO\n2\nand PCO\n2\n, respectively. Standard base excess was kept between \u22123 and 3 mEq/L. In these anesthetized, spontaneously breathing rats, slightly elevated inspired O\n2\n(21\u201345% O\n2\n) was necessary to attain normoxia; (2) Maximum chemoreceptor stimulation (MCS): Breathing with combined hypercapnia (7% CO\n2\n) and hypoxia (10.5% O\n2\n) for 3 min. (3) Spontaneous augmented breaths (AB): Spontaneous deep breaths (sighs) observed during MCS (RMS EMG amplitudes were more than twice normoxic RMS EMG amplitude, and typically greater than the MCS amplitude). Sighs were often followed by a post-sigh apnea; (4) Tracheal occlusion (TOCC): measured during the last 5 seconds of ~40s sustained TOCC. Spontaneous sighs and the response to TOCC were monitored as an indication of near-maximal respiratory muscle activation (\nMantilla et al., 2011\n;\nSeven et al., 2014\n).\n\nHistology and Motor Neuron Counts\nAfter experiments, 6 rats per group were perfused and tissues fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffered saline and harvested (\nLovett-Barr et al., 2012\n). The tissues were post-fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffered saline and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution at 4\u00b0C. Specifically, cervical (C3\u2013C5) and thoracic (T2 and T5) spinal segments were sectioned in transverse plane (40 \u03bcm thickness) using a cryostat. Sections were mounted on positively charged slides (Fisherbrand, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and dried. Sections were stained using 0.1% cresyl-violet and dehydrated through graded alcohol (70\u2013100%), cleared in Histoclear (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) and cover-slipped (Eukitt, Electron Microscope Science, PA). Sections on positively charged slides were imaged at 10x zoom level (BZ-X710, Keyence Co., Osaka, Japan)\nPutative phrenic motor neurons were counted as a cluster of large, medio-lateral neurons in the cervical ventral horn (\nBoulenguez et al., 2007\n;\nMantilla et al., 2009\n;\nWatson et al., 2009\n). Similarly, putative intercostal motor neurons were counted as large, ventro-lateral neurons at T2 and T5 segments (\nWatson et al., 2009\n). Only intact motor neurons with an intact soma and nucleus were counted. Six sections were uniformly selected per segment to count neurons at cervical, T2 and T5 levels. The number of motor neurons in each spinal segment was summarized per slice and side by a blind investigator. Motor neuron counts were then averaged within WT and MT groups, and then statistical inferences were made across experimental groups. The number of phrenic motor neurons in the C3/5 segment and intercostal motor neurons in the T2 and T5 segments were extrapolated from the 6 sections as described previously (\nNichols et al., 2013a\n).\n\nData Analysis and Statistics\nRaw and AB-normalized RMS EMG amplitudes were calculated during Nx and MCS were analyzed for 1-minute period excluding ABs. For each rat, 4\u20138 ABs were analyzed. During TOCC, EMG bursts in the last 5 s of 40-s TOCC were analyzed. Rats were given ~5 min to recover from each experimental condition.\nData during each experimental condition for each animal were averaged to represent the sample for that experimental condition per animal. Statistical analyses were performed with 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA for EMG and Pdi analyses, and with a one-way ANOVA for analyses of histology. When significant differences were observed, Tukey-Kramer Honestly Significant Difference test was used as\npost hoc\nanalysis. Data were summarized as mean \u00b1 SE. Statistical calculations were performed using JMP 11.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A significance level of 0.05 was set for all statistical comparisons."

    "Methods": "Experimental design and drug administration\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (200\u2013250 g) were used in the present work. Animals were randomly divided into 3 groups: (a) Normal animals without PT stroke; (b) PT stroke group; (c) PT stroke animals with PBM. All animal procedures complied with the guidelines of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. A strict blind procedure and analysis were conducted in this study. The researchers conducting behavioral tests, microscopic imaging and other evaluations were blinded to the experimental groups. PT stroke model was carried as described in our previous study (\nAhmed et al., 2016\n). Brie y, the rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (ip) injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) and placed in a stereotactic frame. Rose Bengal dye (0.1 mg/g, ip) was administrated to the animals for 5 minutes before the exposure of the skull. The periosteum was then gently removed, then the skull was illuminated for 15 minutes positioned onto the skull 1.8 mm anterior to the bregma and 2.5 mm lateral from the midline with a 6 mm diameter cold white light beam from a fiber optic cable. During the process of surgical operation, animals were placed on a heating pad, and rectal temperature was maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C. Afterward, the skin was sutured using wound clips. For laser treatment, 2-minute daily laser irradiation (808 nm, 25 mW/cm\n2\nat cerebral cortex tissue level, 350 mW/cm\n2\non the scalp), as reported in our previous work (\nLu et al., 2017b\n), was applied using a Diode IR Laser System (808M100, Dragon Lasers) on the infarct injury area from day 1 to 7. The device information was shown in\nTable 1\n. All animals were restrained in a transparent DecapiCone (DCL-120, Braintree Scientific, Inc, MA, USA) for 2 minutes and returned to their home cage immediately after treatment. The only difference between animals in PT stroke group and PBM group is that the laser power was not turned on when PBM-untreated animals were secured under the fiber optic output. An experimental protocol is shown in\nFigure. 1\n.\nTable 1.\nDevice Information\nManufacturer\nChangchun New Industries Optelectronics Tech, Cp., L\nModel Indentifier\nMDL \u2013 III \u2013 808 \u2013 500 mW\nWavelength (nm)\n808 \u00b1 3.0\nNumber of Emitters\n1\nEmitter Type\nDiode IR Laser\nSpatial Distribution of Emitters\nRound LED Spot Light\nBeam Delivery System\nFiberoptic\nOpen in a new tab\nFig. 1. Schematic diagram of the experimental protocols.\nOpen in a new tab\nPT model was induced on day 0, and on days 1 through 7, rats were treated with PBM (2-minute daily). BrdU (50 mg/kg, ip) was injected two times daily on days 2 through 8. Behavioral deficits were evaluated on days 1, 7 and 13. Rats were sacrificed on day 14, and whole brains were extracted and prepared for further analysis.\n\nTissue Preparation\nFor sample preparation, rats were sacrificed under anesthesia on day 14 after PT stroke. After perfusion with ice-cold saline, the rats were decapitated and the whole brains were then quickly removed. Brains were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4 \u00b0C overnight, and then cryoprotected with 30% sucrose. Afterwards, brains were immersed in OCT cryoprotectant and frozen overnight at \u221280 \u00b0C. A Cryostat (Leica RM2155, Nussloch, Germany) was used for cutting brain sections (25 \u03bcm). For homogenization of the brain, brain tissues from the peri-infarct regions and sham controls were dissected from the cortex and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissues were homogenized as previously described (\nZhao et al., 2016\n). In brief, a motor-driven Teflon homogenizer was used for homogenization in ice-cold homogenization medium (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 12 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100) with inhibitors of proteases and enzymes (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). For the total protein fractions, the homogenates were vigorously mixed for 20 min and centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000\u00d7g at 4 \u00b0C. For mitochondrial and subcellular cytosolic fraction, tissue samples were homogenized in a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.6% NP-40, 12 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate with protease, and enzyme inhibitors. The homogenates were centrifuged for 20 min at 800 \u00d7g, and the resulting supernatants were then centrifuged at 17,000\u00d7g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C to yield cytosolic fractions in the supernatant and mitochondrial fractions in pellet. Protein concentrations were measured by Modi ed Lowry Protein Assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL).\n\n5-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling\nBrdU (5-bromodeoxyuridine, Carbosynth Ltd) was used to label proliferating cells. In the present study, 7 consecutive days of BrdU (50 mg/kg, ip) injections were performed every 12 h from day 2 after PT stroke.\n\nInfarct Volume Assessment\nInfarct volume of different groups were measured by Cresyl violet staining. In brief, the selected brain sections were stained with 0.01 % (\nw/v\n) cresyl violet for 10 min, followed by graded ethanol dehydration. The images of brain sections were acquired by AxioVision microscope system (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Image J (NIH) was applied to quantify the mean infarct area of each brain section. Infarct volume was calculated by the percentage of the total volume of the contralateral hemisphere per group (\nAhmed et al., 2016\n).\n\nImmunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy\nImmunofluorescence staining was performed as previously described by our laboratory (\nLu et al., 2017b\n). In brief, coronal brain sections (25 \u03bcm) were incubated with buffer containing 10% normal donkey serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with the corresponding primary antibodies in the same buffer overnight at 4 \u00b0 C. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-BrdU, Ki67 (DSHB); anti-NeuN, MAP2, DCX (Santa Cruz); anti-synaptophysin, spinophilin (Abcam); anti-Iba1 and GFAP (Proteintech Group). After incubation with primary antibodies, the brain sections were washed three times at room temperature followed by incubation with proper secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then washed with PBS, mounted with water-based mounting medium, and coverslipped in Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). LSM510 Meta confocal laser microscope (Carl Zeiss) was used to capture the fluorescence images. The imaging areas were chosen from the peri-infarct penumbral region beneath the infarct surface for comparison of immunofluorescent intensity between groups. For quantitative analyses, the number of NeuN-positive cells per 150 \u03bcm length in the peri-infarct zone was counted in 4\u20135 areas selected on each slice. 3\u20134 slices (50 \u03bcm apart) were chosen from each rat.\n\nMitochondrial Cytochrome C Oxidase (CCO) Activity\nAs described previously (\nZhao et al., 2016\n), CCO activity was measured by an activity assay kit (ab109911; Abcam Inc) using mitochondrial fractions. Briefly, the fractions were loaded in microtitre plate for 3 h at room temperature. After washing twice with provided solution 1, assay solution was added to each well and the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase activity was measured at 550 nm absorbance (Bio-Rad Benchmark Plus, Microplate Spectrophotometer). The data of relative CCO activity were quantified as percentage changes versus sham group.\n\nQuantification of total ATP content\nAs previously described by our lab, an ATP quantification kit (\nLu et al., 2017b\n), a kit ENLITEN\u00ae rLuciferase/Luciferin Reagent (FF2021, Promega, Madison, WI) was used to measure the level of ATP. Protein samples (30 \u03bcg) from total protein fractions were diluted in 100 \u03bcL of reconstituted rL/L reagent buffer (luciferase, D-luciferin, Tris-acetate buffer (pH 7.75), EDTA, magnesium acetate, bovine serum albumin, and dithiothreitol). Light emission from the reaction was examined in a standard microplate luminometer (PE Applied Biosystems) at 10-second intervals. The \u201cbackground blank\u201d was prepared, containing rL/L reagent and homogenization buffer, and the relative light units from \u201cbackground blank\u201d were subtracted from the sample light output in the assay. An ATP standard curve was used to determine the values of ATP, and the data of relative total ATP content were present as percentage changes versus sham group.\n\nPro-in ammatory cytokines assay\nIndirect Enzyme-Linked-Immunosorbent-Assay (ELISA) was used to detect the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in each group (\nLu et al., 2017a\n). Primary antibody sources were as follows: anti-IL-4, IL-10, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 (Proteintech Group), and IL-18 (Santa Cruz). The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured as the optical density at 450 nm on a spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad), and the values were calculated and presented as percentage changes versus sham group.\n\nWestern Blotting Analysis\nWestern blotting was performed as our previous described (\nZhang et al., 2009\n). In brief, proteins (50 \u03bcg) were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to PVDF membrane. PVDF membranes were then blocked and incubated with appropriate primary antibody at 4\u00b0C overnight. Primary antibody sources include: anti-CD32, CD86, iNOS, ARG, TGF-\u03b2, CD206, and \u03b2-actin from Proteintech Group. After 3 washes, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The bound proteins were then captured on a digital imaging system and analyzed by Image J analysis software (Version 1.49; NIH, USA).\n\nCylinder test and Adhesive test\nThe cylinder test was used to evaluate the effect of PBM on the asymmetric forelimb preference (\nAhmed et al., 2016\n). It was performed on days 1, 7 and 13 after the establishment of the PT stroke model. The device employed in this test was a transparent glass cylinder (diameter: 10 cm; height: 15 cm). In this cylinder, the rats were allowed to contact with the side of the cylinder with its left or right forelimb for 2 min. During this test, researcher counted the number of contacts between left or right paws and the wall of the transparent glass. Contralateral paw use was calculated according to the following formula: score = (contralateral paw use/total paw use) \u00d7100. In addition to this behavioral tests, the adhesive removal test was performed to measure somatosensory deficits on days 1, 7 and 13 after PT stroke. In this test, the experimenter put a small adhesive strip (0.35 \u00d70.45 cm) on the front paw of the rats and then returned the animal to an empty cage. The maximum recorded time spent on removing the adhesive tape was 2 minutes.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Student-Newman-Keuls post-hoc tests with SigmaStat 3.5 software to determine group differences. To determine the differences between normal control group and other groups, Dunnett\u2019s test was performed for post-hoc analyses after ANOVA. A Student\u2019s T test was adopted when only two groups were compared. Statistical significance was accepted at the 95% confidence level (\nP\n< 0.05). Data were expressed as means \u00b1 SE."

C57BL/6 (WT) mice and apoE\u2212/\u2212mice in C57BL/6 background were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained in the animal facility at UTHealth. All mice used for these experiments were females between the ages of 10 and 16 weeks. Pairs of female WT and KO mice were matched by ages with differences of 2 weeks. All animals used for this study are shown inTable 1. Female mice were used in this study to avoid bladder complications and urolithiasis that frequently occur in male mice following SCI.\n\nTable 1.\nAnimals used for experiments.\nExperiments\nEB exp at\n1 d PI\nEB exp at\n3 d PI\nHistology at 3 d\nPI\nBehavioral and histology at\n42 d PI\nExogenous apoE treatment\nEB exp at 3 d PI\nBehavioral and histology at 21 d PI\nWT Ctr\nApoE\n\u2212/\u2212\nCtr\nApoE\n\u2212/\u2212\nplus\nCog112\nCtr\nAntp\nCog112\nC57BL/6 mice\n4\n4\n6\n10\n4\nApoE\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice\n4\n4\n6\n10\n4\n4\n10\n10\n10\nOpen in a new tab\n\n2.1. Contusion injury and surgical procedure\nThe surgical procedure for SCI was described previously (\nFan et al., 2013\n). After anesthetization with a mixed solution of ketamine (80 mg/kg, ip) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, ip), mice received a dorsal laminectomy at the 9th thoracic vertebral (T9) level to expose the spinal cord and then a moderate T9 contusive injury using an Infinite Horizons impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation) at 60 kdyn with the spine stabilized using steel stabilizers inserted under the transverse processes one vertebra above and below the injury (\nHill et al., 2009\n). Afterwards, the wound was sutured in layers, bacitracin ointment (Qualitest Pharmaceuticals, Huntsville, AL) was applied to the wound area, 0.1 ml of a 20 mg/ml stock of gentamicin (ButlerSchein, Dublin, OH) was injected subcutaneously, and the animals recovered on a water-circulating heating pad. Then mice received analgesic agent, buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, SQ; Reckitt Benckiser, Hull, England) twice a day for three days. Bladders were emptied manually until automatic voiding returned spontaneously. The animals were survived for 3, 21 or 42 days per the experimental design (\nTable 1\n).\n\n2.2. Behavioral assessment\nOpen-field locomotor tests with the Basso-Mouse-Scale (BMS) (\nBasso et al., 2006\n) were performed at 1, 3, 7 days after injury and then once every week for 6 weeks. All the animals were coded and behavioral assessments were performed by two investigators blinded with respect to the treatment groups. The mean BMS scores were tallied by injured groups and plotted as a function of time post-injury. Changes in BMS scores over time for the groups were analyzed using a Repeated Measures ANOVA with the between groups factor. Differences among the groups over the survival times were found by using Tukey HSD post hoc\nt\n-tests.\n\n2.3. Histological analyses\nThe spared white matter in the injured epicenter was determined as previously described (\nCao et al., 2005\n). Briefly, at designated time points after SCI (\nTable 1\n), mice were briefly anesthetized with a mixed solution of ketamine/xylazine and perfused transcardially with 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (PB). The spinal cord segments with the injury were removed, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose buffer overnight at 4 \u00b0C and embedded in OCT compound. Serial 20 \u00b5m thick sections through the entire injury site were cut transversely on a cryostat. Two sets of slides were stained with the iron-eriochrome cyanine R (EC) and Cresyl violet, respectively, to identify myelinated white matter and residual spared tissue. The lesion epicenter was defined as the section containing the least amount of spared white matter. White matter sparing was defined as tissue showing normal myelin appearance and density (lacking cysts, degeneration). Septae or fibrous bands of tissue observed within and/or spanning areas of cystic cavitation were not considered to represent spared tissue. The total cross-sectional area of the spinal cord and the lesion boundary were measured with a Zeiss Observer Z1 inverted fluorescence microscope with the stereological stage and Zen Digital Imaging system (Carl Zeiss). An unbiased estimation of the percentage of spared tissue was calculated using the Cavalieri method (\nMichel and Cruz-Orive, 1988\n). The percent spared white matter (WM) areas were calculated by dividing the spared white matter area to the total spinal cord volume in the respective cross spinal cord sections. Mean values of spared WM among different injured groups were calculated and statistically compared using Repeated ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc testing.\n\n2.4. Immunohistochemistry\nAfter blocking with 10% donkey serum in Tris buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature (RT), the sections were incubated in TBST containing 5% donkey serum, polyclonal rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, a marker for astrocytes, 1:200, Dako) and monoclonal mouse anti-CD68 (also called ED1, a marker that labels macrophages and activated microglia, 1:200, Pharmigen) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After three washes of 10 min in TBS, sections were incubated in TBST containing 5% donkey serum, donkey anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated \u2018Fab\u2019 fragments (1:100, Jackson-ImmunoRes Lab, Baltimore, MD) and donkey anti-mouse Texas red-conjugated \u2018Fab\u2019 fragments (1:200, Jackson-ImmunoRes Lab) for 1 h at RT. The sections were rinsed in TBS and cover-slipped with antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). To detect the extravasation of circulating IgG in the spinal cord after injury, the cryostat sections were blocked with 10% donkey serum in TBST for 1 h at RT and then TBST containing 5% donkey serum and donkey anti-mouse IgG Texas red-conjugated \u2018Fab\u2019 fragments (1:200, Jackson-ImmunoRes Lab) for 1 h at RT. The sections were rinsed in TBS and cover-slipped with antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Apoptotic neurons and oligodendrocytes were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). TUNEL staining was performed on the spinal cord slides according to the manufacturer's manual (R & D systems, Minneapolis, MN). Zeiss Observer Z1 inverted fluorescence microscope with Apotome and stereological stage with mosaic tissue capture capabilities was used to capture representative images. The density of ED1 labeling above background was quantified using threshold-based measures within the whole spinal cord cross sections. The Zen (Carl Zeiss) or ImageJ quantification software programs were used to determine proportional area measurements. The percentages of ED1+ area were calculated by dividing the total ED1 areas by the total spinal cord area in the respective cross sections. Mean values of percent lesion area and spared WM among different injured groups were calculated and statistically compared using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc testing.\n\n2.5. Vascular leakage\nVascular leakage was quantified using the established Evans blue (EB) dye technique (\nKakinuma et al., 1998\n). EB dye was injected intraperitoneally (40 mg/kg) at 3 days after SCI. Distribution of the dye was confirmed by a visible change in the mouse skin color within 1 h after injection. Overnight (around 14 h) after receiving injections, the mice were anesthetized with a mixed solution of ketamine/xylazine and intracardially perfused with saline and thoroughly rinsed 20 min until colorless effluence flew out of the right atrium. Spinal cords (1.5 cm from the injury both caudally and rostrally, total 3 cm length) were removed and incubated in 1 ml formamide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 72 h at RT. Extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. Supernatant was used for spectrophotometric measurement at 620 nm and compared to standard curve of Evans blue. Mean values of the amount of EB in spinal cord in WT and apoE\n\u2212/\u2212\ngroups were statistically compared using t testing.\n\n2.6. Isolation and culture of spinal cord neurons and glial cells\nThoracic spinal cords at postnatal day 2 or 3 from WT or apoE\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice were mechanically but gently dissociated in Hank's Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and filtered through 70 \u00b5m Hydrophilic Nylon Net Filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in order to eliminate tissue debris. The obtained single-cell suspension was spun down (1500 g, 10 min), plated onto poly-lysine/laminin-coated 24-well plates at 100,000 cells per well, and cultured in grown medium consisting of F12/DMEM medium (Invitrogen), N2 and B27 supplements (each at 1\u00d7; Invitrogen), 5% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin solution (Invitrogen). The growth medium was changed every other day. At 7 days in vitro, spinal cord cultures from WT or apoE\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice were randomly divided into two groups, control or\nN\n-methyl-\nd\n-aspartate (NMDA) treatment group, which was treated with saline or 10 \u00b5M NMDA in growth medium for 30 min, respectively. All cultures were rinsed with HBSS for three times and continued to grow in growth medium for 1 more day. The cultures were then immunostained as described previously (\nWang et al., 2011\n;\nFan et al., 2014\n). To detect the surface membrane antigens, O1 (an oligodendrocyte marker), cells cultured on 24-well plates were incubated with mouse-anti-O1 (1:500, Millipore, Billerica, MA) at 4 \u00b0C for 45 min. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, cells were incubated in Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgM for 1 h at room temperature (RT). For recognition of other antigens, cells cultured on 24 well plates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against \u03b2-tubulin III (1: 5000, BioLengend, San Diego, CA) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against GFAP (1: 2000; DakoCytomation, Denmark) were applied overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Then, the appropriate fluorophore conjugated-secondary antibodies 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Baltimore, MD) were applied and the nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Controls were performed with species-specific IgG or sera and with inappropriate secondary antibodies. Both showed negligible background. Total cellular counts for each experimental well were obtained in 10 fields under 20 \u00d7 objective from three independent culture wells. The result for each experimental condition was verified a minimum of three times. The average numbers of neurons or oligodendrocytes in different groups were calculated and statistically compared using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc testing.\n\n2.7. Treatment of apoE mimetic peptide after SCI\nThe apoE-mimetic peptide was initially derived from the receptor-binding domain of apoE protein (i.e., apoE133\u2013149) to simulate the bioactivities of the holo-protein (\nLynch et al., 2003\n;\nLaskowitz et al., 2001\n). COG112 was designed by fusion of apoE133\u2013149 with a protein transduction domain antennapedia (Antp) to enhance blood-brain barrier (BBB) and cell membrane penetration. COG112 has demonstrated more potent anti-inflammatory activity and therapeutic efficacy in EAE mice (\nWei et al., 2013\n;\nLi et al., 2006\n). ApoE-mimetic COG112, and antennapedia (Antp) were synthesized by PolyPeptide Laboratories (San Diego, CA) using standard Fmoc-based chemistry. All peptides were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to a purity of > 95%. The peptide sequence of COG112 is acetyl-RQI-KIWFQNRRMKWKKCLRVR-LASHLRKLRKRLL-amide.

The mice received the first treatment by tail vein injection at 30 min post-injury and then intraperitoneally twice a day for 3 weeks. At 3 days post-injury, 4 mice from each group were used for testing blood-spinal cord-barrier (BSCB) function by EB technique as described above. The rest mice in each group were tested for locomotion using BMS scores at 1, 3, 7 days after injury and then once every week for 3 weeks. Animals were sacrificed at the end of week 3 for histological and immunohistochemistry examination."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals and surgeries\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the Duquesne University\nIACUC (protocol no. 1403-03) and were in accordance with the\nNIH Guide\nfor the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n. Seventy male CD1 mice\n(Charles River, Wilmington MA) were housed in a 12:12 photoperiod with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. At 2.5\u20134\nmonths of age, mice were deeply anesthetized with 2% vaporized\nisoflurane and infused with the solutions listed in\nTable 1\nat the following stereotaxic coordinates: AP\n\u22122.5 mm, ML +/\u2212 2.8 mm, and DV \u22123.6 mm from\nBregma and the top of the skull. These coordinates targeted the dorsal portions\nof regio inferior in our pilot study with infusions of blue dye. The preformed,\nrecombinant fibrils made from wildtype mouse \u03b1-synuclein were\nsynthesized according to previously published protocols (\nVolpicelli-Daley et al., 2014b\n;\nVolpicelli-Daley et al., 2011\n), and were sonicated\nfor 1 h in a waterbath (Bransonic series model M1800, Branson Ultrasonics\nCorporation, Danbury CT) immediately before use, as described in the\nSupplemental Information section of our previous report (\nMason et al., 2016\n). In the latter series of studies,\nthe 1 h waterbath sonication protocol led to the densest Lewy-like pathology\ncompared to all other sonication parameters. Control animals were infused in\nparallel with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nTable 1.\nAnimals and treatments.\nTarget site\nNumber of mice\nInfusate\nDose per hemisphere\nSurvival\nBilateral hippocampal CA2 + CA3\n10\nPBS\n1 \u03bcL PBS\n3 months\nBilateral hippocampal CA2 + CA3\n10\nFibrils\n5 \u03bcg fibrils in 1 \u03bcL PBS\n3 months\nUnilateral hippocampal CA2 + CA3\n9\nPBS\n1 \u03bcL PBS\n3 months\nUnilateral hippocampal CA2 + CA3\n9\nFibrils\n5 \u03bcg fibrils in 1 \u03bcL PBS\n3 months\nUnilateral hippocampal CA2 + CA3\n5\nFibrils + 10 kDa BDA\n5 \u03bcg fibrils in 1 \u03bcL PBS\n5% BDA in 0.2 \u03bcL PBS\n3 months\nUnilateral hippocampal CA2 + CA3\n5\nFibrils + FluoroGold\n5 \u03bcg fibrils in 1 \u03bcL PBS\n1.5% FG in 0.2 \u03bcL PBS\n3 months\nUnilateral hippocampal CA2 + CA3\n4\nFluoroGold\n1.5% FG in 0.2 \u03bcL PBS\n7 days\nUnilateral hippocampal CA2 + CA3\n5\n3 kDa BDA\n10% BDA in 0.2 \u03bcL PBS\n10 days\nUnilateral hippocampal CA2 + CA3\n4\n10 kDa BDA\n5% BDA in 0.2 \u03bcL PBS\n7 days\nUnilateral dorsal thalamus\n5\nFibrils\n5 \u03bcg fibrils in 1 \u03bcL PBS\n3 months\nUnilateral cortex\n4\nFibrils\n5 \u03bcg fibrils in 1 \u03bcL PBS\n3 months\nOpen in a new tab\nIn addition to hippocampal infusions, separate control animals were\ninfused with fibrils in the cortex at the following coordinates, again following\nverification with blue dye: AP \u22122.5 mm, ML +2.8 mm, and DV\n\u22122.0 mm. A second group of control animals was infused in the thalamus\nat the following coordinates, following verification with blue dye: AP\n\u22122.5 mm, ML +2.2 mm, and DV \u22124.0 mm. Every attempt was\nmade to minimize animal suffering. All mice subjected to surgical procedures\nwere injected with buprenorphine immediately following surgery. Furthermore,\nlidocaine was applied to the incision for the following three days.\n\n2.2. Behavioral analyses\nAnimals were subjected to memory and olfactory tests two and three months\nafter bilateral infusion of the \u03b1-synuclein fibrils. For the former\ntest, animals were subjected to a habituation phase consisting of 10 min spent\nin an open field (45 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 60 cm) (\nCai et al., 2012\n). On the next day, the animals were\nsubjected to a familiarization phase, during which two identical objects were\nfixed in opposite corners of the same arena, each 10 cm away from the wall. The\nfamiliarization phase lasted five minutes and was followed the next day by\nrecognition testing, during which animals were exposed to only one familiar\nobject from the day before and a second novel object. The novel object\nexploration ratio was defined as the time spent exploring the novel object as a\nfraction of total exploration time (\ni.e\n. novel +\nfamiliar). The head of the animal had to be within 4 cm of the object for\nexploration scoring, and the animal must have faced the object within a\n45\u00b0 angle. On the day after the novel object test, the animal was\nsubjected to the novel place recognition test, in which one familiar object from\nthe familiarization phase was moved to a new location in the arena. The novel\nplace recognition ratio was defined as the time spent exploring the familiar\nobject in the novel place as a fraction of total exploration time. In addition,\nthe buried food test was performed to measure olfactory function, according to\npreviously described methods (\nLehmkuhl et al.,\n2014\n). On the first day, animals were exposed to a peanut on top of\ncorncob bedding and the latency to contact the exposed peanut immediately\nfollowing entry into the cage was measured. On the second day, the latency to\nfind a peanut buried ~2 cm deep in clean corncob bedding was measured.\nAnimals that showed no interest in the exposed peanut on day 1 were excluded\nfrom the analysis (n = 2 PBS-infused cases).\n\n2.3. Thioflavin S staining\nBrains were removed after the survival periods listed in\nTable 1\nand cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in\n10 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Free-floating brain sections were cut in\nthe sagittal or coronal plane and stored in cryoprotectant at \u221220\n\u00b0C (\nWatson et al., 1986\n). The\nThioflavin S staining protocol was adapted from work by Paumier and colleagues\n(\nPaumier et al., 2015\n). Sections\nwere mounted onto glass slides and dried. Slides were then immersed in 10 mM PBS\n(5 min), followed by 0.05% KMnO\n4\n/PBS (20 min). Following two\nrinses in PBS (2 min each), sections were immersed in 0.2%\nK\n2\nS\n2\nO\n5\n/0.2% oxalic acid/PBS\n(~1 min). After five PBS rinses (2 min each), slides were immersed in\nfreshly filtered 0.0125% Thioflavin S/40% EtOH/60% PBS\nfor 3 min in the dark. This was followed by immersion in 50%\nEtOH/50% PBS (10 min) and again by four rinses in PBS (5 min each).\nNext, nuclei were stained with the Hoechst reagent (0.003 \u03bcM; Hoechst\n33258, bisBenzimide) in 0.3% Triton X-100, followed by a final 5-min\nrinse in water. Stained sections were then dried, coverslipped, and viewed with\nepifluorescent microscopy (Olympus IX73, Pittsburgh PA).\n\n2.4. Immunostaining and microscopy\nStandard immunofluorescence procedures were performed with antibodies\nlisted in\nTable 2\n. Briefly, a 1-in-5\nseries of adjacent free-floating sagittal or coronal brain sections was\ncollected and blocked in 50% Odyssey Block (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) in 10\nmM PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h. This was followed by overnight\nexposure at 4 \u00b0C to primary antibodies diluted in the same blocking\nsolution. On the next day, sections were washed in three rinses of PBS and\nexposed to secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Some sections were\nexposed to the fluorescent nuclear markers Hoechst (0.005 \u03bcM) or DRAQ5\n(0.5 \u03bcM) during the secondary antibody incubation period. This\nincubation period was followed by three washes in PBS. Washed sections were then\nmounted onto glass slides and coverslipped. Immunostaining was visualized on the\nepifluorescent microscope mentioned above and large, stitched images were\ngenerated using 4\u00d7 or 10\u00d7 objectives. Higher-resolution images\nwere captured with 40\u00d7 or 100\u00d7 objectives. A blinded observer\nmanually counted the number of inclusions, Hoechst\n+\nnuclei\n(all cells), and NeuN\n+\nnuclei (neurons only) with a\n20\u00d7 objective (field of view = 447.1 \u03bcm \u00d7 337.0\n\u03bcm in area) through CA1, CA2, CA3, the granular and molecular layers of\nthe dentate gyrus, the presubiculum, and the posteromedial cortical amygdala.\nSections from control and experimental groups were always processed,\nphotographed, and analyzed in parallel. Photomicrographs for each hippocampal\nsubregion were captured at the same anatomical level for every brain. If this\nspecific subregion was not present in the 1-in-5 sagittal series due to loss of\ntissue during batch processing, those animals were excluded from analyses.\nTable 2.\nAntibodies.\nPrimary antibody\nHost\nCompany\nCat. no.\nLot no.\nDilution\nAnti-pSer129 (aa 124\u2013134;\nAYEMPS\np\nEEGYQ conjugated to KLH\nvia\na\nC-terminal Cysteine)\nMouse\nBioLegend\n825,701\nB213120\n1:1000\nAnti-pSer129 (aa 127\u2013131;\nMPS\np\nEE)\nRabbit\nAbcam\nAb59264\nGR52476-25\n1:300\nAnti-Synaptophysin\nRabbit\nMillipore\nYE269\nJBC1794853\n1:1000\nAnti-Synapsin I/II\nRabbit\nSynaptic Systems\n106,002\n22\n1:500\nAnti-K48-linked ubiquitin\nRabbit\nMillipore\n07307\n2,299,608\n1:500\nAnti-NeuN\nGuinea Pig\nMillipore\nABN90\n2,031,353\n1:6000\nSecondary antibody\nHost\nCompany\nCat. no.\nLot no.\nDilution\nAnti-mouse @ 488\nDonkey\nLife Technologies\nA21202\n1423052\n1:700\nAnti-mouse @ 546\nDonkey\nLife Technologies\nA10036\n1736962\n1:700\nAnti-mouse @ 647\nDonkey\nJackson ImmunoResearch\n715-605-150\n127706\n1:700\nAnti-rabbit @ 790\nDonkey\nJackson ImmunoResearch\n711-655-152\n115149\n1:700\nAnti-rabbit @ 790\nDonkey\nJackson ImmunoResearch\n711-655-152\n129291\n1:1000\nAnti-rabbit @ 546\nGoat\nLife Technologies\nA11035\n1579044\n1:700\nAnti-rabbit @ 488\nDonkey\nJackson ImmunoResearch\n711-545-152\n120705\n1:700\nAnti-guinea pig @ 488\nDonkey\nJackson ImmunoResearch\n706-545-148\n108077\n1:1000\nAnti-guinea pig @ 647\nDonkey\nJackson ImmunoResearch\n706-605-148\n123960\n1:1000\nOpen in a new tab\nA high-sensitivity, low-resolution 16-bit infrared imager (Odyssey\nClassic, LI-COR Biosciences) was used to measure synaptophysin and synapsin I/II\nimmunostaining in the hippocampal formation using ImageStudio Lite software\n(Version 5.2, LI-COR). For the latter two measurements, the boundaries of\nCA2/CA3 and the dentate gyrus were traced by a blinded observer in all sagittal\nsections containing the temporal pole of the hippocampus (\ni.e\n.\nthe infusion epicenter) in the 1-in-5 section series. Next, background\nfluorescence was subtracted from the total fluorescent signal within the\nenclosed target region of interest and calculated with the formula\n(I\nB\n/A\nB\n) \u00d7 A\nX\n, where I\nB\nis the total fluorescence intensity of the background region, A\nB\nis\nthe area of the background region, and A\nX\nis the area of the target\nregion of interest. This background fluorescence intensity was calculated on\ncontrol brain sections treated with all solutions except for the primary\nantibodies, which always led to loss of staining in all of our assays. In\naddition, our previous work supports the specificity of the primary antibodies\n(\nMason et al., 2016\n).\nFluoroGold-injected cases were labeled with DRAQ5 to delineate\ncytoarchitectonic boundaries, whereas BDA cases were labeled with Hoechst or\nDRAQ5. FluoroGold was visualized with UV illumination and BDA was visualized\nafter incubation in streptavidin-conjugated fluorophores (1:500; AlexaFluor 488\nor 546, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in 0.3% Triton X-100 in 10\nmM PBS for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three washes, tissue mounting,\nand slide coverslipping.\nFor the delineation of anatomical boundaries, the following rodent brain\natlases were consulted: Paxinos and Franklin\u2019s \u201cThe Mouse Brain\nin Stereotaxic Coordinates\u201d (\nFranklin\nand Paxinos, 2013\n), Swanson\u2019s \u201cBrain Maps III:\nStructure of the Rat Brain (\nSwanson,\n2004\n), and the\nRichard Allen Mouse\nBrain Atlas online portal (2017)\n.\n\n2.5. Statistics and blinding\nData are presented in figures as unnormalized, raw numbers and were\nanalyzed by the two-tailed Student\u2019s\nt\n-test, two-tailed\nMann-Whitney\nU\ntest, or a two-tailed Pearson correlation\nanalysis (GraphPad Prism, Version 6.0). Alpha was always set at 0.05. All\nhistological and behavioral measurements were performed by blinded\ninvestigators. Animals that died before behavioral testing or sacrifice were\nexcluded from analyses."

Cell lines and genetic analysis\nThe following immortalized cell lines were described in (\nLi et al., 2016\n): ipn02.3 2\u03bb, ipn97.4 and ipn02.8 were originally derived from human normal (wild-type) non-tumor nerves; cell lines ipNF95.6, ipNF95.11b C, and ipNF95.11b C/T were derived from NF1 PNs. Lines ipNF95.11b C and ipNF95.11b C/T were derived from the same PN but immortalized independently. Mutation analysis was performed (\nLi et al., 2016\n) on ipNF95.11b C/T and ipNF95.11b C by PCR amplification of\nNF1\ngene intron 41 followed by mutation-specific restriction digest/polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Results showed that both lines had lost the wild-type allele with no evidence of a normal allele. Sequencing was performed (\nLi et al., 2016\n) on ipNF95.6 that showed both the germline and somatic\nNF1\nalleles have nonsense mutations although at different sites. These PN lines are thus regarded as two-hit tumor cell lines (not heterozygous) (\nLi et al., 2016\n). All cell lines were maintained as monolayers at 37\u00b0 C, 5% CO\n2\nby passing every 2 or 3 days in growth media (DMEM/high glucose + 10% FBS). Cell lines were routinely checked to ensure that they were free of mycoplasma contamination.\n\n2.3. Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) lentiviral transduction\nThe producer cell line HEK293T was transfected with the packaging plasmids pCMV-dR8.2 dvpr (\nStewart et al., 2003\n), pVPack-VSV-G, and pVPack-GP along with pLVX-IRES-tdTomato for expression of RFP using lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent. The producer cells were incubated for 24 h at 32 \u00b0C after which the viral broth was collected. Transduction of SCs, ipn02.3 2\u03bb, ipn02.8, and ipn97.4 and NF1 PN cells, ipNF95.6, ipNF95.11b C, and ipNF95.11b C/T (at low cell confluence, ~20%) was performed using ViraDuctin Lentivirus Transduction Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. This protocol was repeated for a 2nd and 3rd day using additional viral broth collected from the producer cells. A 30 to 90% transduction was achieved depending on the cell line. Cells were incubated with the selection agent G418 for 6 days at concentrations that ranged from 600 to 2400 mg/ml depending on the cell line. This was followed by sorting for the population of cells (20% of the total number) emitting red fluorescence at the highest intensity on a Sony SH800 cell sorter (Microscopy, Imaging and Cytometry Resources Core at Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University). Samples from these mixed populations were appropriately diluted and clones were isolated and expanded from ipn02.8-RFP, ipn97.4-RFP and ipNF95.11b C-RFP.\n\n2.4. 2D culture\nThe conditions under which testing of the effect of drugs on cell viability in 2D culture were as follows: cells were plated in 96-well plates with no additional coatings applied. The plating densities (in cells/well) of the cell lines used to test the MEK inhibitor varied to account for individual growth rate and plating efficiency and were as follows: wild-type cell lines, ipn02.8-RFP (1800) and ipn97.4-RFP (3000); PN cell lines, ipNF95.11b C-RFP (2500) and ipNF95.6-RFP (2000). For testing LDN-193189 and picropodophyllin, the plating density of the wild-type cell line, ipn02.3, and the PN cell lines, ipNF95.11b C and ipNF95.6 was 1500 cells/100 \u03bcl growth media/well. Assay media for drug testing was DMEM, high glucose, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin streptomycin solution.\n\n2.5. 3D culture\nCell viability assays for drug testing in 3D were performed in 96-well plates that we pre-coated with 30 \u03bcl rBM (Matrigel) in each well. This provides a layer of about 1 mm of thickness. If the layer is too thin the cells migrate to the plastic and assume the morphology of a 2D monolayer. Because of the additional space for growth provided by the 3rd dimension, the plating density for 3D was higher than 2D. Specifically plating numbers for MEK testing were varied according to growth rate as follows: wild-type cells lines, ipn02.8-RFP at 2500 cells/well and ipn97.4-RFP at 3300 cells/well; PN cell lines, ipNF95.11b C-RFP and ipNF95.6-RFP at 8000 cells/well. Plating numbers for testing the effects of LDN-193189 and picropodophyllin were 4000 cells/well for all cell lines. The higher 3D plating density likely increases the presence of cell-secreted factors that promote the formation of networks or aggregates. The volume provided by rBM also allows the cells to assume a morphology that more closely mimics\nin vivo\nconditions (\nBarcellos-Hoff et al., 1989\n); see\nFig. 1\n. In the presence of rBM the 3D growth media supports viability at a reduced FBS concentration of 2% as compared to 2D growth media supplemented at 10%. The 3D assay media was further supplemented with 2% rBM and 1% penicillin streptomycin solution.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nComparison of cell morphology between structures formed in 3D by wild-type SCs and NF1 PN cells. RFP variants of wild-type SCs and NF1 PN cells were established in rBM + collagen I (60:40). After six days, the live 3D cultures were imaged on confocal microscope. The images shown are tilted views of the z-stacks that have been reconstructed in 3D to show the population of multicellular structures formed. The RFP marks the volume occupied by the cells. One grid unit = 128 \u03bcm. Left panel: wild-type SC line, ipn02.8-RFP, inset: magnification of selected area; right panel: NF1 PN cell line, ipNF95.11b C/T-RFP, inset: magnification of selected area.\nFor confocal imaging, cells were cultured in 3D using plastic coverslips as described (\nSameni et al., 2012\n) with some modifications. A single 1 \u00d7 2 cm sterile coverslip was placed in a 35-mm culture dish, chilled on ice and layered with 60 \u03bcl of ice-cold matrix. The matrix consisted of either rBM (8 mg/ml) or rBM:collagen I. The rBM:collagen I mixture was prepared on ice as follows: the rBM was diluted to 8 mg/ml with unsupplemented media (DMEM/high glucose); the collagen I was diluted to 8 mg/ml with PBS and the pH was elevated to 7.4 with 1 N NaOH. The rBM and collagen I, respectively, were combined by volume according to the ratio, 60:40. For proteolysis experiments, the DQ-collagen IV substrate was added for a final concentration of 25 \u03bcg/ml to the matrix prior to layering. The matrix was then placed on the lowest shelf of the incubator (where humidity is the highest) at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\nfor 20 min to insure gel formation. Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in assay media for a final concentration of 8000 cells/60 \u03bcl (unless otherwise noted). The cell suspension (60 \u03bcl) was gently spotted across the surface of the solidified matrix producing a sheet of overlaying fluid. Surface tension held the cell suspension onto the matrix as long as touching the plastic was avoided during application. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0 C, 5% CO\n2\nfor 45\u201360 min until they adhered to the gel, after which 2 ml of 3D growth media was added.\n\n2.6. Confocal imaging\nImages of transfected RFP or Hoechst stained cells as well as proteolytic release of DQ-collagen IV substrate were obtained using a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope, LSM 780 equipped with a Zeiss W Plan-Apochromat 20 \u00d7/1.0 NA (numerical aperture) or a Zeiss Achroplan 10 \u00d7/0.3W Ph1 objective. Prior to microscopy the assay media was replaced by imaging media (DMEM, phenol red free to minimize interference with the fluorescent signal, supplemented with 2% FBS). Depending on the experiment, either four randomly selected sections of sample or a single large section was scanned using a water-dipping objective (10 \u00d7 or 20 \u00d7). Fluorescence of RFP was collected at an excitation wavelength of 550 nm and an emission gating of 551\u2013595 nm. Fluorescein signals (from degraded DQ-collagen IV) were collected at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission gating of 495\u2013571 nm. Blue fluorescence from the Hoechst dye was collected at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and an emission gating of 413\u2013517 nm. Z-stacks of the images at 5.67 \u03bcm intervals (proteolysis assays), 9.67 \u03bcm intervals (volumetric assays), or 2.5\u20134 \u03bcm (morphology assays) were reconstructed with Volocity software (Perkin Elmer) that yielded a numerical evaluation of the intensity and total volume of the signal or calculated the number of nuclei. Intensity of the proteolytic signal (green channel) per cellular structure volume (red channel) or cell number (blue channel) was quantified.\n\n2.7. Cell morphology\nFluorescent emission of cytoplasmic RFP captured by the confocal microscope to define the shape and volume of the cells. Cells were plated on a coverslip at 8000 cells/60 \u03bcl of assay media/slip (unless otherwise noted) and scanned after 6 days of growth. Assay media were changed on day 4. Optical sections were collected using a 20 \u00d7/1.0 NA objective. To ensure representative data were collected, a single large section of the sample was scanned by setting the microscope to capture six adjacent fields for an area of approximately 1270 \u00d7 889 \u03bcm. The setting for the vertical axis was determined by the height of the cell population.\n\n2.8. Proteolysis\nFor each proteolysis experiment, samples were plated on one of two matrices, rBM or rBM/collagen I, with incorporation of DQ-collagen IV. The protocol for confocal microscopy using cover slips described in the section\n3D culture\nwas followed. Each of the five cell lines were tested along with a negative control to define the background signal,\ni.e\n., 60 \u03bcl of rBM supplemented with DQ-collagen IV at 25 \u03bcg/ml without cells. Cells and control were incubated as described for 6 days with a media change on day 4. Four randomly selected fields on a single coverslip were imaged for each sample with parameters described under\nConfocal Imaging\n. The images were reconstructed with Volocity software. Proteolysis was determined using a volumetric RFP assay: with the software the fluorescent signals were converted to numerical values for the intensity of the signal from the fluorescein (green) channel and the volume from the RFP (red) channel for a selected group of cells. Proteolysis was expressed as intensity/volume. The results of the experiments for either rBM or rBM:collagen I were analyzed using oneway ANOVA using Kruskal-Wallis Test followed by Dunn\u2019s Multiple Comparison Test in the software analysis program, GraphPad Prism.\n\n2.9. Drug treatment\nThese assays were designed for a 96-well plate format in 2D and 3D culture using either tissue culture treated, polystyrene plates (MTT assay) or 96 well optical-bottom plates with white upper structure (CellTiter-Glo luminescent assay). Steps of the 3D culture protocol were performed on ice or at 4 \u00b0C. Plates and an 8-channel reservoir were chilled for a minimum of 10 min. Using an 8-channel pipette, 30 \u03bcl per well of ice cold rBM was dispensed into the plate. In order to reduce the meniscus and create an even spread of the rBM in the wells, plates were subsequently centrifuged at 2000 \u00d7\ng\n, 4 min, 4 \u00b0C in a microplate swinging bucket rotor. This permitted a uniform plating of cells across the surface. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C until the rBM formed a gel. Cells were resuspended at the appropriate density (described in section:\n3D culture\n) in 3D assay media (2% rBM, 2% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin in DMEM/high glucose) and plated at 100 \u03bcl per well in duplicate plates. Cells were prepared in parallel for 2D culture by resuspension at densities described (\n2D culture\n) in DMEM/high glucose supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The cell suspension was dispensed at 100 \u03bcl per well on duplicate plates. Empty cells at the perimeters of the plates were filled with sterile water to minimize media evaporation.\nTwenty-four hours after plating the drug was applied at the final concentrations indicated. A vehicle treated control (DMSO) was applied to each cell line at the same dilution used to deliver the drug,\ni.e\n., for selumetinib testing, 1:1000 dilution of DMSO; for LDN-193189 and PPP testing, 1:250 dilution of DMSO. For LDN-193189 and PPP testing, 50 \u03bcM doxorubicin was applied as a positive control for net growth inhibition and an ATP standard curve (1 \u03bcM, 100 nM and 10 nM) was prepared in culture media as a positive control for the assay reagent. After an additional 48 h of incubation net cell viability was assayed. The net viability of the cells per sample was determined using tetrazolium dye, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium, (MTT) for selumetinib and the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay for LDN-193189 and PPP.\n2.9.1. MTT Assay\nAfter 48 h of drug incubation, 20 \u03bcl of 5 mg/ml MTT solution was added to the culture medium of all wells. In addition, 8 \u03bcl of FBS was added to each 3D well to achieve a final concentration of 10% FBS. Cells were incubated for 1 to 3 h until a purple colored formazan product was formed. The medium was removed by flipping the plates over and tapping gently. The formazan product was incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C in a 10% SDS in 0.01% HCl solution. This solution solubilized the formazan and also the rBM. The optical density was measured at 570 nm with a background absorbance read at 690 nm (Epoch microplate reader, Biotek Instruments, Winooski, Vermont).\n2.9.2. CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay\nAfter 48 h of drug incubation the CellTiter-Glo Reagent was added according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions with the exception that for the 3D wells solubilization of the gel was ascertained by microscope before proceeding to measurement of the luminescent signal (Glomax\u2122, 96 microtiter plate luminometer, Promega, Madison, Wisconsin).\n2.9.3. Analysis\nTo facilitate comparisons of drug effects between cell lines the primary data were normalized to percent of control and then converted from the number of viable cells left after treatment to percent inhibition (100% \u2013 % of control). These values were used to construct dose-response curves. Using GraphPad Prism, the logarithm of the concentration of the drug was plotted against the % inhibition and was analyzed as a nonlinear regression according to the equation, log(inhibitor)\nvs\n. response\u2013Variable slope (four parameters). Examination of the graphs dictated the use of the least squares (ordinary) method of fitting except in the case of an extreme outlier, where a robust fit was used. The IC\n50\nvalues obtained are reported in\nTable S1 in the supplementary data\n.\n\n2.10.

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nThis study was conducted on tissues obtained from CD1 mice (\nMus musculus\n) and mice with a null mutation in either the\nApril\ngene (\nCastigli et al., 2004\n) (gift from Raif Geha, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA, USA) or the\nBax\ngene (\nKnudson et al., 1995\n) (gift from the late Stanley Korsmeyer), both backcrossed into a CD1 background. Breeding and housing was approved by the Cardiff University Ethical Review Board and was performed within the guidelines of the Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986.\n\n2.2. Neuron culture\nThe ventral midbrains were dissected from litters of CD1 embryos from E10 to E14, using electrolytically sharpened tungsten needles in chilled L-15 medium (Gibco). To aid dissociation, isolated tissue pieces were digested with 0.05% trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corp., New Jersey, USA) in Ca\n2\u00a0+\n/Mg\n2\u00a0+\n\u2013free Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) for 15\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. To inactivate the trypsin, the tissue was washed twice in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies) containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies) and centrifuged at 2000\nrpm\n. The tissue was resuspended in 1\u00a0ml culture medium comprised of 1:1 DMEM/Ham's F-12, 1\u00a0\u00d7 serum-free N-2 supplement, 2% B27 minus AO (Life Technologies), 2\u00a0mM\nl\n-Glutamine (Life Technologies), 1\u00a0U/0.1\u00a0mg/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK). The tissue was gently triturated with P1000 and P200 pipettes to generate a dissociated single cell suspension. The cells were plated on a poly-ornithine/laminin substratum at a density of 50,000 cells per well in four-well dishes (Greiner Bio-One, Stonehouse, UK), and allowed to adhere for 30\u00a0min to 1\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\nprior to the addition of factors. The cultures were supplemented with the following factors as indicated: recombinant human GDNF (Merck-Millipore, Durham, UK), recombinant human\nmega\nAPRIL, (initial experiments were performed with ALX-522-035-3010 from Alexis Biochemicals, Enzo Life Sciences, Exeter, UK and subsequently with multimeric recombinant human APRIL AG-40B-0017-3010 from Adipogen Life Sciences, Caltag MedSystems, Buckingham, UK). Function-blocking antibodies were rat monoclonal anti-BCMA and goat polyclonal anti-TACI (MAB5931 and AF1041 respectively, R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). Cultures were pre-incubated with these function-blocking antibodies for 1\u00a0h prior to the addition of recombinant APRIL.\n\n2.3. Immunocytochemistry\nThe culture medium was gently aspirated and the cultures were washed with PBS at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Cells were fixed with either ice-cold methanol (MeOH) for 5\u00a0min or freshly-made 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.12\u00a0M Phosphate buffer, pH\u00a07.2 for 12\u00a0min. The fixative was removed and after washing with PBS, the cultures were blocked for ~\u00a01\u00a0h at room temperature in 5% BSA containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). The cultures were incubated overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with primary antibody in PBS containing 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and were gently agitated on an orbital shaker. After extensive washing in PBS, the cultures were incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor or Dylight 488/594) in 1% BSA for 1\u00a0h in the dark at RT. Following serial washes in PBS, the nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (1:10,000 dilution; Life Technologies) for 3\u00a0min. The cultures were imaged with either a Zeiss Axiovert 200 Inverted Fluorescence microscope using Simple PCI software, or with a Zeiss LSM 510 Confocal laser Scanning Microscope. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (1:650 - AB152, Millipore), sheep polyclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (1:500 - AB1542, Millipore), mouse monoclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (1:500 - MAB318, Millipore), rabbit polyclonal anti-APRIL (1:200 - ab64967, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit polyclonal anti-BCMA (1:200 - ab5972, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit polyclonal anti-\u03b2-III Tubulin (1:500 - ab18207 \u201cneuron-specific clone Tu20\u201d, Abcam, Cambridge, UK).\n\n2.4. Analysis of axon length and neuronal survival\nImmunocytochemistry was used to visualize TH-positive neurons or all neurons using anti-\u03b2-III tubulin antibodies. Axons were traced using NIH Image-J software and mean axon length was determined. Survival analysis of mDA neurons was conducted using a micro-island assay, as described (\nPlanken et al., 2010\n). Statistical analyses of two or more conditions were conducted\nvia\none-way ANOVA followed by\npost\n-\nhoc\nanalysis with Bonferroni correction. Pair-wise comparisons were made using Student's\nt\n-test.\n\n2.5. Quantitative PCR\nThe levels of\nApril\n,\nBcma\nand\nTh\nmRNAs were quantified by RT-QPCR in dissected ventral midbrain, striatum, ventral midbrain and SCG, respectively, relative to a geometric mean of mRNAs for the house keeping enzymes glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA). Total RNA was extracted from dissected tissues with the RNeasy Mini Lipid extraction kit (Qiagen, Crawely, UK), and 5\u00a0\u03bcl was reverse transcribed for 1\u00a0h at 45\u00a0\u00b0C using the AffinityScript kit (Agilent, Berkshire, UK) in a 25\u00a0\u03bcl reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2\u00a0\u03bcl of cDNA was amplified in a 20\u00a0\u03bcl reaction volume using Brilliant III ultrafast QPCR master mix reagents (Agilent, Berkshire, UK). QPCR products were detected using dual-labelled (FAM/BHQ1) hybridization probes specific to each of the cDNAs (MWG/Eurofins, Ebersberg, Germany). The PCR primers were:\nApril\nforward, 5\u2032-CTG TCC TTC CTA GAT AAT G-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-CTA GTG ACA CTC TGA CAC-3\u2032;\nBcma\nforward, 5\u2032-TGA CCA GTT CAG TGA AAG G-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-GGG TTC ATC TTC CTC AGC-3\u2032;\nTh\nforward, 5\u2032-CAG AGT TGG ATA AGT GTC A-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-CTC ACC CTG CTT GTA TTG -3\u2032;\nGapdh\nforward, 5\u2032-GAG AAA CCT GCC AAG TAT G-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-GGA GTT GCT GTT GAA GTC-3\u2032;\nSdha\nforward, 5\u2032-GGA ACA CTC CAA AAA CAG-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-CCA CAG CAT CAA ATT CAT-3\u2032. Dual-labelled probes were:\nApril\n, 5\u2032-FAM-CAC CAA ATT CTC CTG AGG CT-BHQ1\u20133\u2032;\nBcma\n, 5\u2032-FAM-CGT ACA CGG TGC TCT GGA TCT TCT T-BHQ1\u20133\u2032;\nTh\n, 5\u2032-FAM-CAC CAA GTT TGA CCC TGA CCT G-BHQ1\u20133\u2032;\nGapdh\n, 5\u2032-FAM-AGA CAA CCT GGT CCT CAG TGT-BHQ1\u20133\u2032;\nSdha\n, 5\u2032-FAM-CCT GCG GCT TTC ACT TCT CT-BHQ1\u20133\u2032. Forward and reverse primers were used at a concentration of 150\u00a0nM each and dual-labelled probes were used at a concentration of 300\u00a0nM. PCR was performed using the Mx3000P platform (Agilent, Berkshire, UK) using the following conditions: 45\u00a0cycles of 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0s and 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 35\u00a0s. Standard curves were generated in every 96-well plate, for each cDNA for every real time PCR run, by using serial three-fold dilutions of either reverse transcribed adult mouse spleen RNA, or, in the case of\nTh\ncDNA, adult mouse brain total RNA (AMS Biotechnology, Abingdon, UK). Three to six separate dissections were performed for each age.\n\n2.6. Analysis of the dopaminergic nigrostratal projection\nin vivo\nThe midbrain dopaminergic projection to the striatum was analysed using immunolabeling-enabled three-dimensional imaging of solvent-cleared organs (iDISCO) (\nRenier et al., 2014\n). Briefly, E14\nApril\n+/+ and\nApril\n\u2212/\u2212 embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24\u00a0h and serially dehydrated in methanol/phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The samples were then bleached overnight in chilled 5% H\n2\nO\n2\nto reduce tissue auto-fluorescence before being serially rehydrated in methanol/PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100. The embryos were incubated in blocking solution (6% donkey serum, 20% DMSO, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.3\u00a0M Glycine in PBS) for 72\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After washing with PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20 and 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml heparin (PTwH), the embryos were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase antibody (1:300, Millipore, Dundee, UK AB152) in PTwH containing 5% DMSO and 3% donkey serum for 72\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Following extensive washing in PTwH, the samples were incubated with donkey anti-rabbit 647 Alexa Fluor secondary antibody (1:300, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK, A-31573) in PTwH plus 3% donkey serum 72\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After further washing in PTwH, samples were cleared by overnight incubation in tetrahydrofuran, followed by dichloromethane treatment for 15\u00a0min. The samples were placed in dibenzyl ether (DBE) until clear and imaged while submerged in DBE in 3D-printed slide chambers using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope.\nQuantification was performed using Fiji-Image J. Images were converted to greyscale and the Feature Extraction (FeatureJ Hessian) tool was employed using the smallest eigenvalue of Hessian tensor with the smoothing scale set to 0.5. To ensure consistent analysis across all conditions, multiple images from all mice were initially analysed to generate a uniform threshold value that was applied to every image analysed. A user-defined macro was used to provide a quantitative measurement of TH immunoreactivity within the midbrain dopaminergic projections. The data are expressed as a percentage of the mean of the wild type data. All imaging and quantification was performed blind with genotypes determined after TH quantification."

    "Methods": "Spinal cord injury surgery and post-operative care\nThe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus approved all surgical procedures and animal handling. Male Sprague Dawley rats (2 months old, ~300 g) were purchased from Hilltop Lab Animal (Scottsdale, PA) and maintained in a 12:12 hrs light-dark cycle. Also, we used total protein extract from female rats from our previous study (\nCol\u00f3n et al., 2016\n) for some Western blot experiments. Rats received water and rat food chow (Harlan Teklad) at libitum. Upon arrival, animals were quarantined for 7 days and then, trained on the behavioral tests (BBB Open Field and grid-walk test). The animals were handled following the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Efforts were made to collect and discuss all the minimum information required in the field of SCI, to replicate this study (\nLemmon et al., 2014\n).\nSurgical procedures were performed under aseptic conditions as previously described (\nCol\u00f3n et al., 2016\n;\nMosquera et al., 2014\n;\nRosas et al., 2011\n;\nSantiago et al., 2009\n). Briefly, rats were sedated with Ketamine/Xylazine/Acepromazine, 87.5/4.2/0.8 mg/kg (Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IO). The dorso-lateral surface was shaved and cleaned with iodine scrub, iodine solution, and 70% isopropyl alcohol. A midline incision in the dorsal thoracic area was performed, the muscles were spread and a laminectomy at T9-T10 level was performed. After laminectomy, the vertebral column was stabilized and the MACSIS impactor was used to exert a moderate contusion to the thoracic spinal cord. A 10 gram rod was dropped from 12.5 mm height, the compression was held for 5 seconds as previously reported (\nCol\u00f3n et al., 2016\n). The sham groups did not receive any injury after the laminectomy. Afterward, placebo (PLB) or TAM pellets were implanted in the mid-scapular region at 0, 6, 12 or 24 hrs after SCI or laminectomy, as reported previously (\nCol\u00f3n et al., 2016\n;\nMosquera et al., 2014\n). Then, the animals were housed individually after the surgical procedures. TAM or PLB pellets were purchased from Innovative Research of America (Sarasota, FL, cat# E-361). TAM pellets were designed to release a constant dose of 0.71 mg/day for 21 days (15 mg pellet). PLB pellets were used as a control treatment for Sham-PLB and SCI-PLB animals (control groups). Rats were randomly selected and assigned to the following groups: Sham-PLB, Sham-TAM, SCI-PLB 0 hrs, SCI-PLB 6 hrs, SCI-PLB 12 hrs, SCI-PLB 24 hrs, SCI-TAM 0 hrs, SCI-TAM 6 hrs, SCI-TAM-12 hrs, and SCI-TAM 24 hrs. These 10 groups were established to investigate the therapeutic window of TAM when the treatment was delayed 0, 6, 12, or 24 hrs after SCI, including their respective controls. Post-operative care included 3 mL of isotonic saline, 0.05 mg/kg/day buprenorphine (Reckett & Colman Pharmaceuticals, Richmond, VA) for 3 days and 7 days of Cefazolin (25 mg/kg) as antibiotic treatment. Bladder manual voiding was conducted 3 times a day until voluntary micturition reflexes returned. All the animals received cereal and sterilized cardboards as enrichment throughout the duration of the experiments (2\u201335 days).\n\nFunctional locomotor recovery assessment\nFunctional locomotor recovery was evaluated at 2 DPI in order to establish the exclusion parameters for a successful compression injury (\nCol\u00f3n et al., 2016\n). Once the appropriate injury was confirmed by the behavioral analysis at 2 DPI, locomotor activity was assessed weekly at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 DPI using the BBB Open field test (\nBasso et al., 1995\n). Two evaluators blinded to treatment scored each hindlimb movement, both scores were averaged and the total score was reported for each animal (\nCol\u00f3n et al., 2016\n;\nMosquera et al., 2014\n). The grid-walk test was used to evaluate recovery of coordination after SCI (\nMerkler et al., 2001\n). Briefly, animals were subjected to cross a horizontal ladder (3 feet long, bars separated by 1 or 2 inches) and scores were assigned according to the number of correct paw positions and the number of errors (missed footsteps) (\nCol\u00f3n et al., 2016\n;\nMerkler et al., 2001\n). Every week, the experimenter randomized the bars to avoid memorization from the rats. The average score (both hindlimbs) was reported for each test.\n\nTerminal analysis: Luxol fast blue histology\nTo determine the effects of chronic TAM treatment after SCI at the anatomical and cellular level, animals were sacrificed at 35 DPI for histology and immunofluorescence studies (\nCol\u00f3n et al., 2016\n). Briefly, animals were sedated, the thoracic cavity was exposed and the animals were perfused intracardially with 250 mL of ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 250 mL of ice-cold 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution. The thoracic area of the spinal cord was removed and representative sections of the spinal cord containing the rostral, epicenter, and caudal areas were dissected (1.5 cm containing the lesion epicenter and rostral-caudal penumbra). The spinal cord segment was post-fixed in cold 4% PFA for 3 hrs followed by cryoprotection in 30% sucrose/PBS solution. Then, the tissue was embedded on freezing medium.\nRepresentative transverse sections (20 \u03bcm) of sham or injured spinal cords (treated with PLB or TAM) were collected in gelatin coated slides using a cryostat at \u221220\u00b0C (Leica microsystems, model CM1850). Sections were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until additional processing. Luxol Fast Blue histology was performed to determine the amount of white matter spared tissue, as previously reported (\nCol\u00f3n et al., 2016\n;\nMosquera et al., 2014\n). Briefly, 3 to 5 slides containing representative sections from rostral, epicenter, and caudal areas (~200 \u03bcm apart) were dehydrated to 95% ethanol followed by immersion in Luxol Fast Blue solution (95% ethanol) at 37\u00b0C overnight. Slides were washed in series (95%\u201370% ethanol) and differentiated with 0.05% lithium carbonate solution followed by 95% ethanol. After staining, slides were washed in histoclear, mounted using Permount\u00ae (Fisher Scientific), dried overnight, and visualized with Z1 Zeiss observer microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc., Thornwood, NY) and photographed using AxioCam MRm at 21 \u00d7 magnification (Rev3).\nThe Otsu method was used to threshold the amount of positive staining and relatively quantify the effects of TAM treatment on white matter preservation, as previously reported (\nCol\u00f3n et al., 2016\n;\nOtsu, 1979\n). The external area of the epicenter was delineated, the cavity was outlined and the image was brought to threshold using ImageJ and the Fiji processing package (\nCol\u00f3n et al., 2016\n;\nSchindelin et al., 2015\n). The selected area representing the epicenter penumbra was quantified. Then the cavity was demarcated, and quantified. The quantified epicenter penumbra was subtracted from the lesion cavity and selected as the amount of white matter spared tissue for this sample. For sham animals, intact grey matter was observed towards the center of the spinal cord. Grey matter was delineated and brought to threshold, and the amount of grey matter was subtracted from the total white matter. At least three sections per animal that correspond to the lesion epicenter were stained and quantified.\n\nTerminal analysis: Immunofluorescence\nFor immunofluorescence studies, spinal cord tissue slides were dried at 60\u00b0C for 30 minutes and the freezing media was removed. The sections were probed using primary antibodies for neuronal and astrocytic markers (see\nTable 1\nfor details). Immunofluorescence experiments were performed as described previously by our group (\nCol\u00f3n et al., 2016\n). Briefly, samples were permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS, post-fixed with 4% PFA, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/0.01%sodium azide solution in PBS for 2 hrs at room temperature. Sections were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C (against NeuN or GFAP,\nTable 1\n). After the incubation, slides were washed with PBS and probed with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 donkey anti-mouse (1:500). Sections were incubated with isotype antibodies (IgG1 or IgG2b) at the same concentration of the primary antibody that were probed with the appropriate secondary antibodies to establish non-specific binding (negative controls). These negative control sections also served to establish the exposure for each experiment, and the imaging parameters were kept constant throughout the analyses. Sections were visualized with Axio Observer Z1 Zeiss microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc., Thornwood, NY) and photographed using AxioCam MRm (Rev3).\nTable 1.

Two sections (~200 \u03bcm apart) from each rostral and caudal areas were photographed. Neurons from the left and right horns (from the dorsal and ventral area) were counted by two evaluators, which were blinded to treatment groups. The averaged count was normalized to the total number of neurons counted for sham animals. Astrocytic marker GFAP (1:2,000) was used as a marker for reactive gliosis at the lesion epicenter. The dorsal, ventral, and lateral areas of the lesion epicenter or laminectomized spinal cord were photographed and presented.\n\nTerminal analysis: spatio-temporal protein expression\nAnimals were sacrificed by decapitation at 2, 7, 14, and 28 DPI to study the mechanisms activated by TAM in the acute and chronic stages after the trauma. The spinal cord was quickly dissected, segments of 0.5 cm representing the rostral, epicenter, and caudal area were removed and placed in a cold 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 700 \u03bcL ice-cold lysis buffer (CelLytic MT Lysis/Extraction Buffer [cat# C3228], 1% Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 3 [cat# P0044], and SigmaFast\u00ae Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet EDTA free [cat# S8830], all from Sigma). Each segment was homogenized with a cold pellet pestle. Tubes with homogenized mixture were placed on a rocker/mixer for 45 min at 4\u00b0C. Samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes (20,000 rcf at 4\u00b0C). The supernatant was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for long-term use. Protein concentration was determined using Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, cat# 500-0006) and quantified using a Microplate reader (Model 680, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercule, CA). Western blots were performed to evaluate the effect of TAM in proteins associated with neurons (NeuN), reactive astrocytes (GFAP), and oligodendrocytes (Olig-2). Uterine tissue (equal loading) was used to validate our antibodies. Uterus was used as positive control for ER-\u03b1 (66 kDa) expression and as a negative control for Olig-2 expression.\nTen (10) \u03bcg of protein (amount needed to be within the linear range of detection) from the rostral, epicenter, and caudal region were separated individually in a 10% SDS-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under constant voltage (50V 30 minutes followed by 150V 60 minutes). This was performed to study the effect of TAM in the temporal expression profile of NeuN and GFAP. To analyze Olig-2, an oligodendrocyte protein, 10 \u03bcg of homogenate from rostral, epicenter and caudal areas were individually separated on 15% SDS-PAGE under constant voltage parameters (50v 30 minutes followed by 100v 90 minutes). Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane with the Trans-Blot\u00ae Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). We used the 1.5 mm Bio-Rad protocol (25V; 1.3A; 10 minutes transfer). After transfer, the membranes for Olig-2 were washed in PBS and dried between two Whatman papers for 2 hrs. This allowed for better signal intensity after developing with secondary antibody. Membranes were blocked for 1 hr in 5% BSA/PBS/0.01% sodium azide followed by incubation with primary antibody (NeuN 1:500; GFAP 1:1,000; Olig-2 1:3,000) in a shaker at 4\u00b0C overnight.\nThe temporal pattern of ER-\u03b1 was investigated using 25 \u03bcg of protein from the lesion epicenter and separated in a 10% SDS-PAGE (initially at 50V for 30 minutes and then at 150V for 60 minutes). To evaluate the temporal changes (2\u201328 DPI) in ER-\u03b1 expression, we used protein extracts from the lesion epicenter of female rats from our previous study (\nCol\u00f3n et al., 2016\n). Male and female total protein (25 \u03bcg) from the lesion epicenter or laminectomy (sham) at 2, 7, 14 and 28 DPI were separated by SDS PAGE. Experiments for ER-\u03b1 temporal pattern of expression included control and experimental groups from box sex in each gel. After SDS-PAGE, nitrocellulose membranes (0.20 \u03bcm pore size, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and blotting paper were soaked in Towbin transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.3) for 10 minutes. Proteins were transferred overnight for 12\u201316 hrs at a constant 35V in Towbin transfer buffer at 4\u00b0C (\nMosquera et al., 2014\n). After the transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were washed quickly in PBS and dried for 2 hrs between two Whatman papers. Membranes were blocked 1 hr in 5% BSA/PBS/0.01% Sodium Azide followed by incubation with ER-\u03b1 (1:500) primary antibody overnight in shaker at 4\u00b0C. After primary antibody probing, the membranes were washed and incubated in IR Dye 800CW goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:25,000) or IR Dye 680CW goat anti-mouse (1:25,000) secondary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature in a shaker. Secondary antibody was washed twice with PBS/0.1% Tween 20 and twice with PBS. Immunoblots were developed using the Odyssey CLx Quantitative Fluorescent Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). Results were quantified using Image Studio Lite Software (LI-COR Biosciences, version 5.2.5). Temporal expression (2\u201328 DPI) of neuronal (NeuN) and glial proteins (GFAP and Olig-2) was analyzed per area (rostral, epicenter, or caudal areas). The percentage fold change per area was combined to obtain the total representative change of neuronal and glial proteins at the epicenter, and rostral/caudal penumbra. Semi-quantitative expression of the target protein was calculated relative to loading control GAPDH (1:10,000) on each area, and results were presented as the percent of fold change relative to Sham-PLB from the combined data (rostral, epicenter, and caudal area).\n\nStatistics\nStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (version 4.0). All statistical tests were performed at an alpha<0.05 to be considered statistically significant. Two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc was used to demonstrate that SCI control subjects treated with PLB (0, 6, 12, and 24 hrs) in the behavioral assays (BBB Open field and Grid-walk tests) did not present any significant difference. Since no statistical difference was found between SCI-PLB 0 hrs, 6 hrs, 12 hrs and 24 hrs at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 DPI at the BBB Open field test (F\n(3,120)\n=0.7936; Treatment p=0.5071), these groups were pooled. For white matter quantification (\nFig. 2\n), no statistical difference was observed between Sham-PLB and Sham-TAM (Unpaired t-test, p=0.774, n=3) or SCI-PLB 0 hrs and SCI-PLB 6 hrs (Unpaired t-test, p=0.515; n=3 for each group). For this reason, animals were pooled into a single group SCI-PLB (SCI-PLB 0 + 6 + 12 + 24 hrs) or Sham (PLB + TAM) for\nFig. 1\n. In the Luxol histology experiment, the pooled groups were Sham (PLB + TAM) and SCI PLB (0 + 6 hrs).\nFig.2.\nOpen in a new tab\nTamoxifen favors white matter preservation at the lesion epicenter and stimulates Olig-2 expression in the chronic stages after SCI. (A) Luxol fast blue histology at the lesion epicenter show Sham (PLB or TAM) with intact myelin and injured animals with cavitation toward the epicenter at 35 DPI.

Data are mean\u00b1SEM, One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc; Sham-PLB n=3, Sham-TAM n=5, SCI-PLB n=5; SCI-TAM n=5.\nFig.1.\nOpen in a new tab\nImmediate (0 hrs) or delayed (6 hrs) Tamoxifen treatment after SCI improves locomotor recovery and coordination in male rats. (A) The BBB Open Field test was performed weekly in all subjects. Sham animals received 21 points in the BBB Open Field Test at all test points. TAM favors locomotor recovery when the therapy was administered immediately or 6 hrs after SCI (\n&&&\np<0.001 treatment, DPI and\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\nInteraction). However, if TAM was administered at 12 or 24 hrs after SCI no effect was observed. (B\u2013C) Rats treated with TAM showed better coordination in the grid walking test during chronic stages (***Treatment, ***DPI and\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\nInteraction). TAM-treated animals showed reduced number of errors at 21 DPI and 35 DPI (SCI-PLB vs SCI-TAM 0 hrs) and increased number of paw positions when crossing the grid walk test at 28 DPI (SCI PLB vs SCI-TAM 0 hrs) and only at 35 DPI if TAM was applied 6 hrs after SCI (SCI-PLB vs SCI-TAM 6 hrs). Data are the mean\u00b1SEM (Sham [PLB+TAM] n=9, SCI-PLB (0 + 6 + 12 + 24 hrs) n=34, SCI-TAM 0 hrs n=11, SCI-TAM 6 hrs n=12, SCI-TAM 12 hrs n=12, SCI-TAM 24 hrs n=12); RM Two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc for both behavioral assays (statistical significance if p values were lower than 0.05).\nFor neuronal cell count at the Ventral horn (VH), no significant difference was found between Sham-PLB and Sham-TAM number of cells (average Sham-PLB=42.75\u00b1 2.4; n=6 versus Sham-TAM=43.25\u00b10.87, n=6; un-paired t-test, p=0.8510). Also, neuronal count at the Dorsal Horn (DH) revealed no significant difference between cell number of sham animals (Sham-PLB=133.8\u00b1 7.22, n=6 versus Sham-TAM=135.9 \u00b1 6.2, n=6; un-paired t-test, p=0.8243). Therefore, Sham-PLB and Sham-TAM animals were pooled into a single group (\nFig. 3\n). For the temporal expression profile of ER-\u03b1, we evaluated the ER-\u03b1/GAPDH intensity from Sham-PLB male or Sham-PLB female rodents at 2, 7, 14, and 28 DPI (\nFig. 5\n). No statistical difference was found in the ER-\u03b1/GAPDH intensity for the Sham-PLB male or Sham-PLB female among the selected time points according to One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test (Sham-PLB male F\n(3,11)\n=1.685; Treatment MS=0.0001; p=0.247; and Sham-PLB female F\n(3,11)\n=2.932; Treatment MS=0.0003; p=0.010). Therefore, we grouped the Sham-PLB control rats (either male or female groups; separately) into a single group according to sex.\nFig.3.\nOpen in a new tab\nTamoxifen promotes neuronal survival after spinal cord injury in male rats. (A) Representative immunoblots for NeuN protein from the injured or laminectomy spinal cord treated with TAM or PLB at 2, 7, 14 and 28 DPI. (B) Semi-quantitative analysis revealed that the group of SCI-PLB rats significantly decreased NeuN expression at all time points tested when compared to Sham-PLB (***p<0.001; **p<0.01) and Sham-TAM (\n###\np<0.001; ##p<0.01). TAM treatment after SCI significantly increased NeuN expression at 28 DPI relative to SCI-PLB (\n&\np<0.05). Data are mean\u00b1SEM, Two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc (Sham-PLB n=3,5,3,4; Sham-TAM n=3,5,3,3; SCI-PLB n=4,5,3,4; SCI-TAM n=4,4,4,3). C. Representative sections from DH and VH neurons at 35 DPI showed an increase in both horns of the gray matter when treated with TAM (magnification= 20\u00d7; scale bar= 100 \u03bcm). D. Dorsal (left and right side) and ventral (left and right side) areas were analyzed for NeuN immunoreactivity. Neurons from dorsal and ventral horn were counted, averaged, and compared to sham. Results are presented as the percentage of Sham (PLB + TAM). Neuronal count showed a significant reduction in neuronal cell number after SCI (***p<0.001). Immediate (t=0 hrs) and delayed (t=6 hrs) TAM administration significantly increased total number of neurons after SCI (\n&&\np<0.01). Data are mean\u00b1SEM, One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc; Sham (PLB+TAM) n=6; SCI-PLB (0+6hrs) n=6; SCI-TAM 0 hrs n=3; SCI-TAM 6 hrs n=3.\nFig.5.\nOpen in a new tab\nDifferential expression of ER-\u03b1 in male and female rats treated with Tamoxifen after SCI. (A) Representative immunoblots for ER-\u03b1 expression at 2, 7, 14 and 28 DPI from the epicenter area in male and female rats. Immunoblots show a difference in the expression of ER-\u03b1 (66 kDa) between male and female rats after SCI. (B) Semi-quantitative analysis showed a significant increase in ER-\u03b1 expression SCI-PLB-female rats at 2,7,14 and 28 DPI and a significant increase in SCI-TAM-male at 14 DPI. Data are mean\u00b1SEM; One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnet\u2019s post hoc was used to determine significant difference between groups and Sham-PLB-male at 2, 7, 14 and 28 DPI [*p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001], (n=3 for each group, per time point).\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). A series of symbols are denoted to show statistical significance between groups. For behavioral assays, the ampersand symbol (&) denotes significance (p<0.05) between SCI-PLB (pooled data) and SCI-TAM (0 or 6 hrs) treatment groups while a dagger (\u2020) symbol denotes statistical significance (p<0.05) for Interaction (DPI and Treatment) in Two-way ANOVA tests. For Luxol fast blue histology and NeuN cell count, an asterisk shows statistical significance between Sham (PLB + TAM) and treatment groups, while the ampersand (&) symbol shows significance between SCI-PLB (pooled 0 + 6 hrs groups) and SCI-TAM (0 or 6 hrs). For Western blot experiments, the asterisk (*) is used to denote significance for Sham-PLB male while the number sign (#) is used to denote significance between Sham-TAM and treatment groups. Sham-TAM rodents were not pooled for molecular experiments because we aimed to study the effects of TAM in target protein expression on intact animals. An increase in the number of symbols represent a higher statistical significance: 1 symbol= p<0.05; 2 symbols=p<0.01 and 3 symbols=p<0.001."

    "Methods": "Neonatal spinal cord microglia\nNeonatal spinal cord microglia were cultured as previously described with minor modifications (\nMcCarthy & De Vellis 1980\n;\nKerstetter and Miller 2012\n). Briefly, 2-day-old Sprague Dawley rat pups were decapitated and their vertebrae were removed by cutting bilaterally along the length of their spinal columns. After the removal of meninges, the spinal cords were isolated and cut into small pieces, digested in TrypLE express (Thermo Fisher) for 30 min and neutralized with cell culture media containing Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamax, 100IU/ml penicillin and 100\u03bcg/ml streptomycin. After brief centrifugation, the spinal cord tissue was resuspended and triturated in cell culture media and the resulting cell suspension was plated into 75cm\n2\ntissue culture flasks coated with 10\u03bcg/ml poly-L-lysine. The mixed glial cultures were maintained for 10d in cell culture media with media changes on days 3 and 6. On day 10, the mixed glial cultures were vigorously shaken for 18h on a rotary shaker incubator (240rpm) and the detached cells were collected. Oligodendrocyte progenitors and microglia in the cell suspension were separated by plating the cells in uncoated plastic wells, to which only microglia adhere. The following day, microglia were stimulated with FeCl\n3\n(1mM), LPS (100ng/ml; Sigma 0111:B4), and a combination of both with or without TAK-242 (0.5 \u03bcM; Millipore) for 24h. Microglia were then either fixed in 4% PFA for 30min or homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies).\n\nIn vitro iron uptake\nFixed microglia were stained for non-heme bound iron using a modified Perls Prussian blue staining protocol. Briefly, endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched using a 4:1 mixture of methanol and 30% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min followed by an incubation of the cells in a 1:1 mixture of 4% HCl and 4% potassium ferrocyanide solution (Polysciences, Inc) for 30 min. Finally, after 10min incubation with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, the Prussian blue signal was amplified using DAB with nickel (Vector). DAPI counterstain was used to identify the nuclei. Then, images from 50 arbitrary viewfields were taken from each well (\nn\n= 4/group) using an ArrayScanXTI High Content Analysis Reader (Thermo Fisher) and the images were analyzed using the associated HCS Studio Cell Analysis Software to identify the number of cells positive for Perls stain per viewfield. The percentage of iron positive cells per well was calculated and reported.\n\nGlutamate and Griess assay\nAdult rat bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were generated using a modified protocol described previously (\nLongbrake et al., 2007\n). Briefly, bilateral femurs and tibias were dissected from adult Sprague Dawley rats. Using a 23 gauge needle, bone marrow was flushed into sterile conical tubes using a syringe filled with ice cold DMEM. Cells were triturated into a single cell solution, and red blood cells were lysed in lysis buffer (0.15M NH\n4\nCl, 10mM KHCO\n3\n, 0.1mM Na\n2\nEDTA, pH 7.4). After washing, cells were plated at 1x10\n6\ncells per ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 20% L929 supernatant, 0.5% gentamicin, 1% HEPES, 1% glutamax, and 0.001% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Supernatant from L929 cells contains macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF1) required to drive bone marrow cells to differentiate into macrophages (\nBurgess et al., 1985\n). After 7d\nin vitro,\nBMDMs were re-plated into wells with DMEM, supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% glutamax, and 0.25% gentamicin. The following day, BMDMs were stimulated with the either FeCl\n3\n(1mM), LPS (100ng/ml, Sigma; 0111:B4) or both LPS and FeCl\n3\nfor 24h. Supernatants were collected and spun at 13,000 x g to remove insoluble material. Colorimetric glutamate (Sigma) and Griess (ThermoFisher Scientific) assays were conducted according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nSolution preparation for\nin vivo\nmicroinjections\nVehicle and isosmotic ferric-citrate solutions were prepared as described by\nMcDonald\net al\n. (2002)\n. First, the vehicle solution was made using sodium citrate-dihydrate (180mM), sodium bicarbonate (11.4mM), and tris base (0.455M), in 0.1M sterile PBS. A 0.75nM ferric citrate solution was made with ferric chloride hexahydrate (100mM) diluted with vehicle. LPS (1mg/ml, Sigma; 0111:B4) was similarly diluted in the vehicle solution. LPS + iron solution consisted of 2x concentrated LPS and ferric-citrate solution mixed 1:1. All solutions were filter sterilized using a 0.22\u03bcm filter, and iron+LPS solutions were mixed immediately before use.\n\nIntraspinal microinjections\nAll surgical and postoperative care procedures were performed in accordance with The Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (~250 grams;\nn\n= 56) were randomly assigned to treatment groups (vehicle control, iron, iron+LPS, LPS; n = 10/group), then anesthetized with an intra-peritoneal injection of ketamine (80mg/kg) and xylazine (10mg/kg). Using aseptic technique, a laminectomy was performed at the T8 vertebral level. Custom pulled UV-sterilized glass micropipettes beveled to an outer tip diameter of 25\u201340\u03bcm were loaded with the proper solution and positioned 0.7mm lateral to the dorsal spinal cord midline. Using a hydraulic micropositioner (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA), pipettes were lowered 1.1mm into the spinal cord. For histological experiments, a 500nl bolus injection was administered to the lateral gray-white matter border using a PicoPump (World Precision Instruments). For tissue RNA experiments, a 200nl bolus injection was administered bilaterally in the lateral gray-white matter border. Injection sites were labeled with sterile charcoal (Sigma), muscles surrounding the laminectomy were sutured, skin was stapled with wound clips, and rats were given 5cc sterile saline (subcutaneous) before being placed into a warmed recovery cage. Two rats died due to complications with anesthesia.\n\nBromodeoxyuridine administration\nThe thymidine analog 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (50mg/kg, in sterile saline; Roche) was used to label proliferating cells. Rats were given an i.p. injection of BrdU (20mg/ml) at 2 and 4h post-microinjection and once a day until they were euthanized.\n\nTissue processing: immunohistochemistry\nAt 1d or 7d post-injection, rats (\nn\n= 4\u20135 per group) were deeply anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Spinal cords were carefully removed and post-fixed for an additional 2h. Following overnight incubation in 0.2M PB, spinal cords were cryoprotected in a 30% sucrose solution for 48\u201372h. 8 mm segments of spinal cord centered on the injection site were then blocked and frozen on dry ice. Once frozen, cords were embedded in OCT (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and the blocks were frozen on dry ice. Spinal cord cross-sections were cut at 10\u03bcm using a cryostat, and mounted sequentially onto SuperFrost Plus slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tissue was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use.\n\nTissue processing: mRNA extractions\nRats (\nn\n= 4 per group) were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused using ice-cold 0.1M DEPC-PBS. A 2mm segment of thoracic spinal cord centered on the injection site was dissected, homogenized in TRIzol (Life Technologies) and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until processed for RNA isolation.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nBriefly, slides were rinsed with 0.1M PBS followed by blocking of nonspecific antigens with 4% BSA/0.1% Triton-100/PBS (BP\n+\n) for 1h. Primary antibodies were then applied overnight at 4\u00b0C. After rinsing, biotinylated secondary antibodies were applied for 1h at room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched using a 4:1 mixture of methanol and 30% hydrogen peroxide. Secondary antibodies were visualized using Elite-ABC (Vector Laboratories) with DAB or SG as substrates (Vector). In some instances, tissue was counter-stained with methyl green or neutral red. Last, slides were dehydrated in ethanol and coverslipped with Permount (Fisher). Sections labeled for BrdU were incubated in 2N HCl at 37\u00b0C for 25min prior to primary antibody incubations. Primary antibodies include: mouse Ox42 (CD11b on CNS macrophages \u2013 1:2000; Serotec), mouse ED1 (CD68 on CNS macrophages \u2013 1:2000; Serotec), rabbit NG2 (NG2 cells - 1:200; Millipore), mouse CC1 (OLs - 1:500; Abcam), rabbit GFAP (astrocytes - 1:4000; Sigma), mouse BrdU (proliferating cells, 1:200; DSHB), and mouse NeuN (neurons - 1:50,000; Chemicon). Non-heme bound iron was labeled using a modified Perls Prussian blue staining protocol. Briefly, endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched using a 4:1 mixture of methanol and 30% hydrogen peroxide. Then, slides were incubated in a 1:1 mixture of 4% HCL and 4% potassium ferrocyanide solution (Polysciences, Inc) for 30min. Finally, after a 10min incubation with 0.1% tritonX-100 in PBS, the Prussian blue signal was amplified using DAB with nickel (Vector).\n\nImmunofluorescence\nBriefly, slides were rinsed with 0.1M PBS followed by blocking nonspecific antigens with BP\n+\nfor 1h. Primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4\u00b0C. Following rinses, secondary Alexa Fluor antibodies (1:500\u20131000; Invitrogen) were applied for 1h at room temperature. Slides were incubated in DAPI (1:50,000; Invitrogen) for 15min at room temperature to label nuclei. After PBS and dH\n2\nO rinses, slides were coverslipped in Immu-Mount (Thermo Scientific). Primary antibodies: mouse Ox42 (CD11b on CNS macrophages \u2013 1:2000; Serotec), rabbit H-Ferritin (1:5000; Abcam), and rabbit L-Ferritin (1:2000; Abcam).\n\nMicroscopy and quantitative analysis\nAll data are reported as mean \u00b1 SEM and all analyses were performed in a blinded manner. Fluorescent images of double-labeled ferritin/CD11b cells were captured using an Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope, and processed with the corresponding Fluoview software. A Zeiss Axioskop 2 Imaging microscope with a Sony 970 three-chip color camera was used to capture and analyze bright-field images. To quantify macrophage density in the ipsilateral cord, low power images were digitized and manually outlined using the MCID Elite imaging software (Imaging Research Inc., Canada). For Perls iron and GFAP quantification, a 0.1mm\n2\nbox was centered on the injection site, overlapping gray and white matter. Proportional area was calculated as the area of CD11b, CD68, GFAP, or Perls immunoreactivity, divided by sample area.\nCell counts for oligodendrocytes (CC1), NG2 cells, NG2/BrdU double-labeled cells and neurons (NeuN) were manually collected at high magnification using 0.02mm\n2\nreticule boxes. For all quantifications, counts from 3 serial sections centered on the injection site were averaged for each animal. For OL and NG2 cell counts, one 0.02mm\n2\nreticule box in the ventral/intermediate GM and three non-overlapping 0.02mm\n2\nreticule boxes in the WM directly adjacent to GM were reported as \u201cinjection site.\u201d NeuN counts consisted of one 0.02mm\n2\nreticule box in the ventral/intermediate GM. For all analyses, data are expressed as the number of cells per cubed millimeter.\nBecause NG2 is also expressed on other cell types, conservative NG2 cell counts were conducted based on morphological criteria (\nTripathi & McTigue, 2007\n). A single- or double-labeled NG2 cell was only counted if the NG2 immunoreactivity surrounded an identifiable nucleus in a single plane of focus and possessed multiple NG2-expressing processes (to rule out counting pericytes or macrophages). Because astrocytes can also express CC1, OLs were only counted if the CC1 expressing profile did not co-express GFAP. Occasionally, NG2+ and CC1+ profiles were verified at higher magnification (64x).\nStatistical analyses and graphs were generated in Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Quantitative differences between groups were analyzed using a 1-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\ntest or a 2-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni\u2019s\npost hoc\ntest. Significance was set at\np\n<0.05.\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR\nTRIzol reagent was used to extract RNA from tissue or neonatal microglia following the manufacturers protocol (Life Technologies). RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) to generate cDNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using gene-specific primers to measure mRNA levels in the microinjected tissue (\nn\n= 4 per group) or stimulated microglia (\nn\n= 3 per group). PCR product was measure using SYBR Green fluorescence using an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System. The sequences for primers used were: 18S(F) TTCGGAACTGAGGCCATGAT, (R) TTTCGCTCTGGTCCGTCTTG; H-Ferritin (F) TTGCAACTTCGTCGCTCCGCC, (R) TGGCGCACTTGCGAGGGAGA; L-Ferritin (F) GCAGCGCTTTGGAGATCCCG, (R) AGTCCCCGGGTCTGTTCCGT; transferrin receptor (F) GGCTATGAGGAACCAGACCGCTACA, (R) TGGACTTCGCAACACCAGGGC; DMT-1 (F) TGTCGCCTGTCCATTTGGCCG, (R) TGGCGTGGCGGGGTTGAAAT; hepcidin (F) TATCTCCGGCAACAGACGAG, (R) AGCGCACTGTCATCAGTCTT; ceruloplasmin (F) TGCAACAAGCCCTCACCGGA, (R) TGGTCTCCTCGGCAGCGATGTA; iNOS (F) TTGGTGAGGGGACTGGACTTT, (R) CCGTGGGGCTTGTAGTTGA; IL-1\u03b1 (F) TCACTCGCATGGCATGTGCTGA, (R) TCGGGCTGGTTCCACTAGGCT; TNF\u03b1 (F) TGATCCGAGATGTGGAACTGG, (R) CGATCACCCCGAAGTTCAGTAG. Gene expression relative to the housekeeping gene 18S was analyzed using the comparative C\nT\nmethod (\nSchmittgen & Livak, 2008\n). Significance was reported when\np\n< 0.05 after running a one-way ANOVA with Tukey\npost hoc\ntest."

Both sexes were used for these studies at P9.\n\nNeonatal Brain Hypoxia-Ischemia\nNeonatal HI was performed as previously described using the Vannucci model (\nRice et al., 1981\n). At P9, pups were anesthetized with isoflurane (2\u20133% isoflurane/balance oxygen) and the left common carotid artery was electrocauterized. The animals were recovered for one hour with their dam and then exposed to 60 minutes of hypoxia in a humidified chamber at 37\u00b0C with 10% oxygen/balance nitrogen. Sham-operated control animals received isoflurane anesthesia and exposure of the left common carotid artery without ligation or hypoxia. HI and sham animals were returned to their dams until they were euthanized at 15min, 1hr, 6hr and 24hr after the procedure for different experiments.\n\nPSD sample preparation\nPurification of PSD-associated synaptic proteins was carried out as described using a subcellular fractionation approach followed by extraction with Triton X-100 (\nJiang et al., 2011\n;\nKnox et al., 2013\n). Cortical tissue was homogenized in ice-cold 0.32M sucrose buffer and centrifuged at 1,000\u00d7\ng\nfor 10min. The resulting supernatant was spun at 10,000\u00d7\ng\nfor 15 min to yield a pellet as crude membrane fraction (P2). The P2 was resuspended in 120 \u00b5l sucrose buffer, mixed with 8 volumes of 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer and homogenized again with 30 pulses of a glass pestle followed by rotation at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. After Triton extraction, the samples were spun at 32,000\u00d7g for 30 min in a TL-100 tabletop ultracentrifuge (Beckman). The resultant pellet containing Triton X-insoluble PSD proteins were dissolved in TE buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 10mM EDTA) with 0.5% SDS and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). The purity of PSD was verified by Western blots as described (\nJiang et al., 2011\n).\n\nImmunoprecipitation (IP) and in gel digestion\nThe GluN2B protein complexes were purified from PSD samples by immunoprecipitation with a mouse GluN2B monoclonal antibody (MBS800075, Lot# 1003, MyBioSource Inc. San Diego, CA). Briefly, 25\u00b5g PSD protein was diluted with 1% NP40 buffer and pre-cleared with 25\u00b5l Protein G-agarose beads (#15920-010, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The samples were then incubated overnight with 6.25\u00b5g GluN2B antibody or 6.25\u00b5g mouse IgG2b (#401202, BioLegend, San Diego, CA) as a negative control with slow rotation. The next day, fifty microliter of protein G-agarose beads were added and the sample mixtures were rotated for another 2 hours. After centrifugation, the beads were washed 3 times with NP40 buffer and boiled for 10 mins with 30\u00b5L of 2xLDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). The GluN2B binding proteins in the supernatant were then separated by NuPAGE Novex 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gels for Western blotting (see below) to validate protein interactions, or stained with Imperial protein stain (#24615, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) for in gel digestion followed by LC-MS/MS analysis (\nShao et al., 2017\n). Lanes were sliced into 0.5\u20131mm\n3\nsmall pieces and placed into low-binding eppendorf tubes for destaining, dehydration, reduction and alkylation followed by digestion with combined trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) and lysyl endopeptidase C (Lys-C, mass spectrometry grade, Wako) at the ratio of enzyme: protein of 1:25 in mass. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 16 hours, the digested peptides were extracted and desalted with C18 solid phase extraction tip (10ul bed C18 ZipTip, Pierce) and then eluted with two sequential 10ul aliquots of 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The combined elute was dried in Speed Vac and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid/ 2% acetonitrile for the subsequent MS analysis.\n\nLC-MS/MS analysis and protein identification\nThe peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) equipped with a Waters NanoAcquity LC system (Milford, MA) at UCSF Mass Spectrometry Facility (\nShao et al., 2017\n). Peptides were separated on an Easy-Spray column (Thermo, PepMap, C18, 3\u00b5m, 100\u00c5, 75\u00b5m \u00d7 15cm) using a linear gradient from 2% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) to 25% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) at 300 nL/min over 47 min. MS precursor spectra were measured in the Orbitrap from 300\u20132000\nm/z\nat 30,000 resolving power, top six precursor ions were selected and dissociated by collision-induced dissociation (CID) for MS/MS. The MS/MS data were searched against mouse protein sequences in the SwissProt database (downloaded from Uniprot on 2015.10.12) using MSGF+ search engine (\nKim and Pevzner, 2014\n) with a concatenated database consisting of normal and randomized decoy databases. The false discovery rates for peptide identification were estimated to be 1.2%, corresponding to maximum expectation value of 0.102. Parent/precursor mass tolerance and fragment mass tolerance were 20ppm and 0.6 Da, respectively. Constant modification of carbamidomethylation on cysteine (C) and variable modifications of deamidation of N-terminal glutamine, initial protein methionine loss with or without N-terminal acetylation were employed.\n\nSemi-quantification of GluN2B protein interactions using spectral counting\nA semi-quantitative analysis was performed using spectral counting, which relies on the number of peptides (peptide count) identified from a given protein. This simple label-free quantification technique is based on the observation that the more abundant a protein is, the more peptides can be identified from it. It provides a tool for rapid screening and broad estimation of relative protein amount between samples (\nOld et al., 2005\n). To estimate the relative level of protein interaction with GluN2B, the mean peptide count of individual protein from triplicate analysis (three repeated LC/MS/MS analysis of the same sample) was normalized to that of GluN2B in each specific MS experiment. The proteins that appeared in three MS experiments were selected and reported with standard deviations (SD) and coefficient of variation (%CV). The mean fold changes of HI over sham values were used to represent the up- or down-regulation of GluN2B interactions for each protein after HI. Calculation of fold change was made following Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen, Redwood, CA), the bioinformatics tool that we utilized for functional analysis. If the association increased after HI, use values of (HI/sham), and if the association decreased after HI, use -1(sham/HI).\n\nWestern blotting\nFor Western blot analysis, an equal amount of PSD protein samples (5\u00b5g) or equal volume of supernatant from GluN2B IP experiments was applied to 4\u201312% Bis-Tris SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The blots were probed with the primary antibodies (listed in\nSupplemental Table S2\n) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were used, and signal was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, GE Healthcare). Image J software was used to measure the mean optical densities (OD) and areas of protein signal on radiographic film after scanning.\n\nPrimary cortical neuronal culture and immunofluorescent staining\nPrimary neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 16 mouse cortices as described previously (\nJiang et al., 2004\n) and used on day in vitro (DIV) 10 for double immunofluorescent staining to determine co-localization of GluN2B with TANC2 or NAV1. Briefly, the cultures were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose in PBS for 12min on ice followed by 100% methanol for 10min at \u221220\u00b0C. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS for 10min. After blocking with 3% goat serum in PBS for 1hr, the cells were incubated overnight with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (rabbit anti- GluN2B: #4212 from Cell Signaling Technology, paired with mouse anti-TANC2: sc-515710; or mouse anti-NAV1: sc-398641 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing three times in PBS and incubation with secondary antibodies (Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG) at room temperature for 1hr, the cultures were counterstained with DAPI. Images were captured with Zeiss Axiovert microscope.\n\nFunctional Analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)\nTo evaluate whether the changes in GluN2B interactions with other PSD proteins at early stage (1hr) after HI are associated with any forms of biological processes or diseases, we interrogated the data with IPA. A list of proteins identified from MS experiments that were newly recruited to the complexes after HI and proteins with differential levels of interactions to GluN2B after HI was generated. The list containing the protein ID (UniProt Accession number) along with the values of mean fold changes of HI over sham was uploaded to the software for a core analysis. IPA identifies genes associated with a list of relevant functions and diseases using a constantly updated knowledge base, and the list is ranked based on the significance of the biological functions. Direct and indirect relationships were considered for the analysis. We interrogated specifically the function and neurological disease annotation in IPA and the top 10 for these two categories were reported.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nGluN2B-ineracting proteins detected by MS experiments were semi-quantified using spectral counting from triplicate MS run of 3 sets of samples for each group. As mentioned above, the relative levels of the association of each individual protein with GluN2B were calculated. The differences between HI and sham animals are presented as mean fold change of HI/sham, along with SD and % CV. For Western Blotting, the optical densities of protein bands were presented as mean \u00b1 SD and were evaluated statistically using SAS Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals and Treatments\nAll animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Edition) and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Michigan. All mice were maintained on standard laboratory chow (5L0D, LabDiet) and water ad libitum. Myeloid Mcl1 knockout mice were on a C57BL/6J background and were generated by crossing floxed Mcl1 mice with LysMCre (Mcl1\nfl/fl\n-LysMCre, MyMcl1\n\u2212/\u2212\n). Heterozygous myeloid Mcl1 knockout mice (Mcl1\nfl/wt\n-LysMCre, MyMcl1\n+/\u2212\n) and wild type mice (MyMcl1\n+/+\n) were used as controls.\nFor CXCR2-pepducin experiments, wild type C57BL6/J male mice 8\u201310 wk old and weighing 22\u201325 g were were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Mice received a previously determined dose (2.5 mg/kg) of CXCR2-pepducin (RTLFKAHMGQKHR, palmitoyl N-terminal, amidation C-terminal) or control peptide (TRFLAKMHQGHKR, palmitoyl N-terminal, amidation C-terminal) in sterile saline 3 h before MCAo via intravenous injection (\nJamieson et al., 2012\n;\nKaneider et al., 2005\n). Mice received an additional subcutaneous injection of pepducin 9 h after stroke.\n\nMiddle cerebral artery occlusion\nMice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 1.5% maintenance) and core body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C using a temperature controller with heating pad and rectal probe. An 8 mm midline incision was made in the neck and the submaxillary glands were dissected to expose the right common, external and internal carotid arteries. The external carotid artery was ligated and divided, and a 10 mm long 6\u20130 silicon rubber\u2013coated nylon monofilament (#602156, Doccol Corporation, CA) was inserted into the external carotid stump and advanced into the internal carotid artery. Regional cerebral blood flow was monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry (Transonic BLF22) before and during monofilament insertion to verify MCA occlusion. Occlusion was defined as a reduction in cerebral tissue perfusion to a level <20% of baseline. After 90 minutes, the filament was removed and animals were allowed to recover.\n\nMeasurement of Infarct Volume\nInfarcts were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 24 hours reperfusion. Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane/air mixture throughout MRI examination. Mice lay prone, head first in a 7.0T Varian Unity Inova MR scanner (183-mm horizontal bore; Varian, Palo Alto, CA), with the body temperature maintained at 37\u00b0C by forced heated air. A double-tuned volume radiofrequency coil was used to scan the head region of the mice. Axial T2-weighted images were acquired through the use of a fast spin-echo sequence with the following parameters: repetition time/effective echo time, 4000/60 ms; echo spacing, 15 ms; number of echoes, 8; field of view, 20\u00d720 mm; matrix, 256\u00d7128; slice thickness, 0.5 mm; number of slices, 25; and number of scans, 1 (total scan time = 2.5 minutes). The infarct volumes were analyzed using NIH ImageJ software (version 1.43) by a blinded observer, and infarct volumes were corrected to account for brain swelling.\nThe following equation was used to calculate the corrected T2-lesion volumes: TV \u2013 ((CV + (IV \u2013 LV) x ((TV/2)/CV)); TV indicates total volume in both hemispheres; CV, contralateral volume; IV, ipsilateral volume; and LV, lesion volume.\n\nEvaluation of Neurological Deficit\nNeurological deficits were determined 24 hours after MCA occlusion. Neurological scores were assigned using the following criteria: 0, no deficit; 1, forelimb flexion and torso turning to the contralateral side when held by tail; 2, circling to contralateral side; 3, unable to bear weight on contralateral side; and 4, no spontaneous locomotor activity.\n\nFlow Cytometry\nCerebral hemispheres were dissected and minced into small pieces with a razor blade in RMPI containing 5% FBS, and the homogenate was passed through a 40 \u03bcm cell strainer. Leukocytes were purified by density gradient centrifugation using a 30% percoll solution and washed twice with PBS. Peripheral whole blood was collected, RBCs were lysed by 10 s hypotonic shock using distilled water, and remaining leukocytes were washed with PBS. Cells were incubated in Fc Block for 10 min and then stained on ice for 1 hr with the following antibodies: PE anti-mouse CD45 (BioLegend, cat # 103106), APC anti-mouse CD11b (BioLegend, cat # 101211), FITC anti-mouse Ly6G (BioLegend, cat # 127606), Pacific Blue anti-mouse Ly6C (BioLegend, cat # 128014). Stained cells were washed twice in PBS and fixed in 0.1% paraformaldehyde before analysis. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACSCanto II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with three lasers (405-nm violet laser, 488-nm blue laser, and 640-nm red laser) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Treestar). Unstained and isotype controls were used for flow analysis.\n\nmRNA Expression Analysis\nRelative mRNA expression was determined using quantitative reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Total RNA was isolated from whole cerebral hemispheres using TRIzol reagent and purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) with an on-column DNase digestion. RNA (1 ug) was reverse transcribed to cDNA with an Applied Biosystems kit and qPCR was performed using a 7900HT fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The relative mRNA expression was quantified using the comparative method and normalized to the ribosomal housekeeping gene L32.\n\nStatistics\nA Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to determine if data were normally distributed. For normally distributed data with equal variance, statistical comparison of mean values between groups was performed with the Student t test or by a two-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post-test, and values are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. All statistical analysis of data was performed in GraphPad Prism (version 6; GraphPad Software, Inc).\nP\n< 0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science (North Chicago, IL) and adhered to the guidelines provided in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. C57BL/6J, B6(Cg)-Crhtm1(cre)Zjh/J and B6.Cg-Tg(Th-cre)1Tmd/J male mice, 9 to 10 weeks old, were purchased from a supplier (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) and were housed 3 to 5 mice per cage. All nociceptive tests were done in the morning after an hour of acclimatization to the testing room.\n\nNeuropathic pain model\nSurgeries were performed under isoflurane anesthesia and following aseptic technique. Peripheral nerve constriction surgery was performed by exposing the main branch of the sciatic nerve with forceps and carefully placing a 4 mm long piece of P90 nontoxic, sterile polyethylene tubing that was split lengthwise (inner diameter 0.86 mm and outer diameter 1.27 mm; Becton Dickinson Intramedic, Franklin Lakes, NJ) onto the nerve. After confirmation that the tubing remained loosely on the nerve, the nerve was returned to its position and the incision was closed with wound clips [\n30\n]. Analgesia (flunixin meglumine 2 mg/kg, subcutaneous) was given for the following three days. Control mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and the skin was shaved but the sciatic nerve was not exteriorized in order to prevent behavior alterations and stimulation of CeAmy activity, which is increased in sham animals that undergo surgical incisions of skin and muscle [\n31\n].\n\nApplication of pharmacogenetics\nStereotaxic surgeries were used to inject DREADD viral constructs into the CeAmy and/or LC. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a Stoelting stereotaxic apparatus. A longitudinal skin incision and removal of pericranial connective tissue exposed the bregma and lambda sutures of the skull. The coordinates for the CeAmy injections were - 1.3 mm, \u00b1 2.5 mm and - 4.5 mm in respect to bregma while the LC injections were placed - 5.4 mm, \u00b1 0.8 mm and - 4.5 mm to bregma. Small holes were drilled into the skull and the viral solution was injected via a 32 gauge needle connected to an infusion pump (Microsyringe pump, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) in volume of 0.2 \u03bcl over 5 minutes. All animals were given analgesic and fluids for 3 days after the surgery. B6(Cg)-Crhtm1(cre)Zjh/J mice, with Cre recombinase expression in CRF neurons, were injected bilaterally in the CeAmy with cre activated adeno-associated virus (serotype 5, pAAV-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry and pAAV-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry, titter \u2265 3\u00d710\n12\n(UNC Vector core, Chapel Hill, NC), referred here as AAV-DREADD-Gq and Gi respectively). C57BL/6J mice were injected unilaterally with retrograde canine adeno-associated cre virus or CAV-2-cre, titter \u2265 2.5\u00d710\n12\n(Plateforme de Vectorologie de Montpellier, Montpellier, France) into the LC, and with cre activated AAV-diphtheria toxin (serotype 5 AAV-mCherry-FLEX-dtA, titter \u2265 3\u00d710\n12\n(UNC Vector core, Chapel Hill, NC) viral construct into the CeAmy. Further behavior and nociceptive tests were performed three to four weeks after the viral injections. During the course of these experiments an AAV variant (rAAV-CAG-eGFP-F2A-Cre, titer = 1\u00d710\n12\n, NINDS Viral Production Core Facility, Bethesda, MD) with efficient retrograde transport became available [\n32\n]. Because of the potential benefits of working with AAV we repeated the experiment with retrograde labeling via LC injection and the SIA experiments using the retro-AAV. The results are very similar, providing further support for the initial observation and supporting the suggestion that retro-AAV may be an attractive alternative to CAV2-Cre for this type of experiments.\n\nNociceptive and Behavior testing\nMice were given at least one hour to acclimatize to the testing room before nociceptive or behavior testing. Tactile sensitivity was measured using von Frey filaments applied to the plantar surface of the hind paw through a mesh floor. Following the technique for assessment of mechanical allodynia described by Chaplan [\n33\n], six filaments with different stiffness were used for each measurement. The starting filament was always 1.0 g. A quick withdraw, shaking or licking of the paw were considered a positive reaction. The mechanical thresholds were calculated by Dixon's up and down method [\n34\n]. Mechanical thresholds were obtained before and in five-day increments following sciatic nerve constriction for up to 15 days.\nThermal pain thresholds were measured by a tail-flick test. Mice were gently restrained in a plastic laboratory tube covered in foil to block environmental stimuli and their tails freely projected out of the restrainer. Next, the mice were placed in the Tail-Flick Analgesia Meter Model 33 (IITC Life Science Instruments, Woodland Hills, CA) in which a high intensity light (Beam: 4; Sensitivity: 3.5) was directed at their tails. The timer on the meter shut off (automatic shut off at 25 seconds) immediately once the mice flicked their tails, and these times were recorded as response latencies.\nStress was induced by a forced swim. Mice were placed in a transparent cylinder, 30 cm in diameter, half filled with tap water (21-23\u00b0C) for 5 minutes. The mice were completely dried with paper towels before undergoing the tail-flick test that followed one minute after the forced swim. The amount of time the mice were actively swimming was also measured for each forced swim. The last 3 minutes of the 5-minute swimming session were analyzed and the idle time was calculated as a percentage.\n\nDrugs\nInjectable solution of flunixin meglumine (NSAID) was purchased from veterinary supplier Norbrook Inc. (Overland Park, KS) and was applied according to the recommendations for anesthesia and analgesia in laboratory animals by IACUC at RFUMS.\nClozapine N-Oxide (CNO) was purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO), dissolved in 200 \u03bcl DMSO, brought to volume with distillated water, aliquoted and stored at -20\u00b0C until use. CNO, an inert compound and the only ligand for the DREADD receptors, was injected intraperitoneally (1 mg/kg in 0.2 ml) or administered via drinking bottles wrapped in aluminum foil (1 mg/kg in 5 ml water) to activate (DREADD/Gq) or inhibit (DREADD/Gi) expressing neurons.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were euthanized 24 hours after testing with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (Vedco Inc., Saint Joseph, MO) and perfused transcardially with 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The spinal cords were carefully dissected from the spinal column. The dissected spinal cords sections included the thoracic region, lumbar intumescence and cauda equina. The lumbar intumescence was clearly visible as the most widened area between the cauda equina and the thoracic region. The lumbar intumescence was then trimmed and the right side was marked with a small cut in the ventral part of the cord. The dissected brains were also marked on the right side. Next, the collected tissue, brains and spinal cords, were left overnight in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0 C. After the overnight incubation in 4% PFA the brain tissue and spina cords were washed with PBS and sectioned into 40 \u03bcm thick sections using a Leica VT1000S vibrotome.\nAll brain and spinal cord sections were washed with 1X PBS, incubated in 3% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 15 minutes, again washed with 1X PBS, and then incubated in a blocking solution (1X PBS, 0.05% Triton X-100, 3% normal donkey serum) for 2 hours at room temperature. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in the same blocking solution at 4\u00b0C for 48 hours. The dilutions of primary antibody were as follows: 1:2K rabbit antibody to CRF (anti-CRF; catalog # 5348, Sigma-Aldrich, MO), 1:2K rabbit antibody to \u0394FosB (anti-\u0394FosB; catalog # 14695; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), 1:2K rabbit antibody to c-Fos (anti-c-Fos; catalog # 2250; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), 1:5K mouse antibody against norepinephrine transporter (NET) (anti-NET; catalog # 1447, Phosphosulutions, Aurora, CO), 1:5K chicken antibody to mCherry, (anti-mCherry, catalog # CPCA-mCherry, EnCor Biotechnology Inc., Alachua, FL) and 1:2K chicken antibody to GFP (anti-GFP, catalog # A10262, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Following incubation with the primary antibody, sections for CRF, \u0394FosB and c-Fos were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc. West Grove, PA), 1:2K dilution for 2 hours, followed by incubation in avidin-biotin complex (ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 hour at room temperature. Then, the sections were placed in tyramide conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 405 fluorescent dyes, 20 nmol concentrations for 12 minutes, followed by washes in 1X TRIS-buffered saline. Direct secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 595 or Alexa 488 and diluted 1:400 in 1X PBS/3% donkey serum were used to visualize mCherry, NET and GFP immunoreactivity.\n\nMicroscopy\nLeica DM 5500B epifluorescence microscope was used to acquire 16-bit images of amygdala, while Zeiss 510 confocal microscope was used to obtain 16-bit images of the LC and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. CRF immunoreactivity (CRF-ir), \u0394FosB immunoreactivity (\u0394tFosB-ir) and c-Fos immunoreactivity (c-Fos-ir) were evaluated on six sections per animal. The atlas matched brain sections covered the CRF-ir expression in the CeAmy between bregma level -1.1 mm and -1.8 mm. \u0394FosB-ir and c-Fos-ir were analyzed between bregma levels -5.3 and -5.5 mm, and included the expression of Fos markers in the LC and in surrounding LC-perinuclear zone [\n35\n].\nAnalysis of the immunohistochemistry results was done using the ImageJ software (ImageJ, NIH image, Research Service Branch, Bethesda, MD). CRF-ir was measured using the integrated density (ID) calculation in ImageJ. The region of the CeAmy was selected carefully using the draw tool. Next, the ID was measured from three different, but same sized areas in the background (BG). Our final ID per image was calculated using the formula: ID = (ID\nCeAmy\n) -((ID\nBG1\n+ID\nBG2\n+ID\nBG3\n)/3) in arbitrary units.\n\u0394FosB-ir and c-Fos-ir were measured as the number of immunofluorescent cells above background. First the microscopic images were converted to 8-bit gray scale images with white background. Next, the \u201cThreshold\u201d tool was set and laminae one and two of the dorsal horn or the LC perinuclear zone were selected with the draw tool as ROI. All particles above background in ROI were calculated using the \u201cAnalyze Particles\u201d function.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and analyzed with Graph Prism 7 software. Student's T-test was used for two-group comparisons, while the results of all other experiments were evaluated using Two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. The accepted level of significance was set at P < 0.05 in all tests."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (275\u2013325 g) were used as a model of type 1 diabetes after delivery of a single intraperitoneal injection of 90 mg/kg STZ (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Insulin implants (Linplant, Linshin Canada Inc., Canada) were injected subcutaneously into the nape of the neck of a subgroup of STZ-induced diabetic rats after approximately 4 weeks of diabetes and at monthly intervals thereafter. Fasting blood glucose concentration was monitored weekly using the AlphaTRAK glucometer (Abbott) to ensure that insulin therapy did not alter hyperglycemia. At the end of 5 months, blood glucose, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) and body weight were recorded before tissue collection. Animal procedures were approved by the University of Manitoba Animal Care Committee.\n\nHind paw thermal sensitivity test in adult rats\nHind paw thermal response latencies were measured using a Hargreaves apparatus (UARD, La Jolla, CA, USA) as previously described (\nJolivalt et al., 2016\n). Briefly, rats were placed in plexiglass cubicles on top of the thermal testing system. The heat source was placed below the middle of one of the hind paws and latencies of the paw withdrawal to the heat source were automatically measured. Response latency of each paw was measured three times at 5 min intervals.\n\nAdult DRG sensory neuron culture\nDRGs were isolated and dissociated using previously described methods (\nCalcutt, et al., 2017\n). Neuron-enriched cells were cultured in Hams F12 media supplemented with Bottenstein\u2019s N2 without insulin (0.1 mg/ml transferrin, 20 nM progesterone, 100 \u03bcM putrescine, 30 nM sodium selenite 0.1 mg/ml BSA; all additives were from Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA; culture medium was from Caisson labs, USA). DRG neurons from control rats were cultured in the presence of 5 mM D-glucose and DRG neurons derived from STZ-induced diabetic rats with 25 mM D-glucose and zero insulin. Porcine insulin powder (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) dissolved in PH=2 and different doses (10 or 100 nM) were used as treatments. No neurotrophins were added to any DRG cultures. In this culture system there is approximately 5% cell loss over a 24 hr period.\n\nQuantitative Western blotting for insulin signaling and mitochondrial proteins\nRat DRG neurons were harvested from culture or isolated intact from adult rats and then homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer containing: 0.1 M Pipes, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 5 mM EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail. Proteins were assayed using DC protein assay (BioRad; Hercules, CA, USA). The samples (2\u20135\u03bcg total protein/lane) were resolved and separated via 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). After separation, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) using Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) and immunoblotted with specific antibodies against pP70S6K T389 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), pAkt S473 (1:1000, Santa Cruz, TX, USA), Total OXPHOS (1:2000, MitoSciences, Abcam, USA), Porin (1:1000, Abcam), \u03b2-actin (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and total-ERK (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Of note, total protein bands were captured by chemiluminescent imaging of the blot after gel activation (TGX Stain-Free\n\u2122\nFastCast Acrylamide Solutions, Bio-Rad, CA, USA) in addition to use of T-ERK and porin levels for target protein normalization. The secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) or donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, PA, USA. The blots were incubated in ECL Advance (GE Healthcare) and imaged using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc image analyzer (Bio-Rad). All raw data signals for each antibody were normalized to T-ERK (in vitro work) or total protein (in vivo work) from the same blot. Please note that electron transport chain protein bands in\nFigures 2\n,\n4\nand\n7\n, and\nsupplemental Figures 1\nand\n2\nwere obtained from one single blot with different exposure times.\nFigure 2. Insulin treatment increases the expression of electron transport chain proteins.\nOpen in a new tab\nDRG neurons derived from adult control rats were treated with/without 10 nM insulin for 2\u201324 h and lysates subjected to Western blotting. Specific proteins from each respiratory Complex were quantified and expressed relative to T-ERK. Complex III-UQCRC2 subunit protein was not detectable. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM of N=4 replicates; *= p<0.05 or **= p<0.01 or ***= p<0.001 or ****= p<0.0001 vs ctrl by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s\npost-hoc\ntest.\nFigure 4.

Data are mean \u00b1 SEM of N=4 replicates; *= p<0.05 or **= p<0.01 or ***= p<0.001 vs ctrl by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s\npost-hoc\ntest.\nFigure 7. Insulin corrects deficits in mitochondrial protein expression in DRG of diabetic animals.\nOpen in a new tab\nDRG tissues from control (Ctrl), diabetic (Db) and insulin-implanted diabetic (Db+ins) rats were isolated and subjected to Western blotting. Complex I and III subunit proteins were not detectable. Western blot band intensity of these proteins was normalized to total protein bands of the same blot. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM of N=5\u20136 animals; *= p<0.05 or ***= p<0.001 analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s\npost-hoc\ntest.\n\nReal-Time PCR of DRG samples\nRNA was extracted from previously frozen tissue samples using TRIzol\u00ae Reagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples underwent DNase treatment and reverse transcription by using the iScript\n\u2122\ngDNA Clear cDNA Synthesis Kit and iQ cycler system (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed by using iQ\n\u2122\nSYBR\u00ae Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). The \u0394\u0394Ct method was used to quantify gene expression. The expression of porin gene was used for normalization. Primer sequences for gene expression analysis are listed as follows:\nSDHB\n-Forward: 5\u2032-ATCTGCAATCCATCGAGGACC-3\u2032,\nSDHB\n-Reverse: 5\u2032-AGCGAT AAGCCTGCATGAGAA-3\u2032,\nMT-CO1\n-Forward: 5\u2032-TCCAGATGCTTACACCACATGA-3\u2032,\nMT-CO1\n-Reverse: 5\u2032-AGTTGAGGAGTAGGAAATTGAGAGT-3\u2032,\nVDAC1\n(porin) -Forward: 5\u2032-GCTTTTCGGCCAAAGTGAACA-3\u2032,\nVDAC1\n(porin) -Reverse: 5\u2032-CGCATTGACGTTCTTGCCAT-3\u2032.\n\nMitochondrial respiration in cultured neurons\nTo measure the basal level of mitochondrial oxygen consumption, the ATP-linked oxygen consumption (proton leak), the maximal respiration, the spare respiratory capacity and the non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption, an XF24 Analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences, Billerica, MA, USA) was used (\nBrand and Nicholls, 2011\n). In short, DRG culture medium was changed 1hr before the assay to unbuffered DMEM (Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1mM pyruvate, and 5 mM D-glucose. For diabetic rat DRG cultures, 25 mM D-glucose was used. Four mitochondrial complex inhibitors including oligomycin (1 \u03bcM), FCCP (1 \u03bcM) and rotenone (1 \u03bcM) + antimycin A (1 \u03bcM) were injected sequentially through ports in the Seahorse Flux Pak cartridges. Oligomycin acts as an irreversible ATP synthase inhibitor, FCCP as an uncoupler, rotenone as Complex I inhibitor, and antimycin A as an inhibitor of Complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport system. The XF24 machine which creates a transient 7\u03bcl chamber in specialized 24-well microplates, allowed real time recording of live cell mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR). After OCR measurement, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for \u03b2-tubulin III which specifically labels sensory neurons. Plates were then placed into a Cellomics Arrayscan-VTI HCS Reader (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) equipped with Cellomics Arrayscan-VTI software to facilitate a full neuronal count of each well. OCR measures from each well were normalized to neuronal count for that specific well. Data are presented as OCR per 5000 cells.\n\nImmunocytochemistry for \u03b2-tubulin III for neurite outgrowth in DRG cultures\nDRG neurons were removed from culture and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature then permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Cells were incubated with blocking buffer for 1 h and with neuron-specific -tubulin III primary antibody (1:1000; from Sigma Aldrich) overnight. Following three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocynate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were mounted using mounting medium with DAPI and imaged by a Carl Zeiss Axioscope-2 upright fluorescence microscope equipped with AxioVision3 software. The fluorescent signal was collected as total pixel area for neurites and was measured by ImageJ software and normalized to number of cell bodies to calculate total neurite outgrowth per neuron.\n\nNerve density in footpads\nThe plantar dermis and epidermis of the hind paw were removed and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissue was processed to paraffin blocks, cut as 6\u03bcm sections, immunostained using an antibody to PGP 9.5 (1:1000, Biogenesis Ltd. Poole, UK) and the number of immunoreactive intra-epidermal fiber s(IENF) and sub-epidermal nerve profiles (SNP) per unit length quantified under blinded conditions by light microscopy (\nJolivalt, et al., 2016\n).\n\nEnzymatic activity of respiratory Complex IV in DRG\nEnzymatic activity of cytochrome\nc\noxidase (a subunit of Complex IV of the mitochondrial electron transport system) was measured by a temperature controlled Ultrospec 2100 UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer equipped with Biochrom Swift II software (Biopharmacia Biotech). Briefly, 0.02% lauryl maltoside was mixed with 10 \u03bcg DRG homogenates and incubated for 1 min before addition of 40 \u03bcM reduced cytochrome\nc\nand 50 mM KPi to the mixture. The resulting absorbance decrease of reduced cytochrome\nc\nat 550 nm was monitored for 2min (\nRoy Chowdhury, et al., 2012\n).\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-tests or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s or Dunnett\u2019s post hoc tests, as appropriate and indicated (GraphPad Prism 4, GraphPad Software). A P value < 0.05 was considered to be significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nFmr1\nKO male mice on a C57BL/6 background and their male wild-type (WT) littermates were used for all experiments.\nFmr1\nKO mice were originally obtained from Dr. William Greenough (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) and a colony established at the University of California, Los Angeles. Genotypes were determined by PCR analysis of DNA extracted from tail samples. After weaning, mice were housed in groups of the same sex under standard laboratory conditions with a 12:12 h light-dark cycle. Animals for immunohistochemistry were studied from postnatal day (PN) 14\u201360, and those for electrophysiological, biochemical and electron microscopic studies were studied at 2\u20133 months of age. Data from 34\nFmr1\nWT and 35\nFmr1\nKO littermates were used in the study, and animal numbers are indicated for each experiment. All animal use protocols conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the University of California, Los Angeles, Chancellor\u2019s Animal Research Committee.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nTissue preparation for light microscopy\nAll mice used for light microscopic immunohistochemical studies were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (90 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.12 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. After 1 h in situ at 4\u00b0C, brains were removed and postfixed for 1 h. After rinsing, brains were cryoprotected in a 30% sucrose solution overnight and frozen in cryo-embedding compound on dry ice. Forebrain blocks containing the hippocampus were sectioned coronally at 30 \u00b5m with a cryostat.\nAntisera and immunohistochemical methods\nThe following GABA\nA\nR subunit-specific antisera were used to localize \u03b4 and \u03b14 subunits in the immunohistochemical studies: rabbit anti-\u03b4 subunit (1:1000; Millipore AB9752 or PhosphoSolutions 868-GDN, no longer commercially available) and rabbit anti-\u03b14 subunit (1:1000; Millipore AB5457). The specificity of each antiserum was confirmed by a lack of immunohistochemical labeling in tissue from \u03b4 and \u03b14 subunit KO animals, respectively (\nPeng et al., 2002\n;\nPeng et al., 2014\n). Prior to immunohistochemistry, free-floating sections were incubated in 1% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 30 min and then processed with a water bath heating antigen-retrieval method to reduce endogenous peroxidase-like activity and enhance specific labeling of the receptor subunits (\nPeng et al., 2002\n). Briefly, the sections were heated to 90\u00b0C for 70 min in sodium citrate solution (pH 8.6). After cooling and rinsing in 0.1 M Tris buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.3), sections were processed for immunohistochemistry with standard avidin-biotin-peroxidase methods (Vectastain Elite ABC; Vector Laboratories) as described in detail previously (\nPeng et al., 2002\n;\nPeng et al., 2004\n).\nDensitometry methods\nThe intensity of immunolabeling was analyzed with an Axioskop 2 microscope equipped with an AxioCam digital camera system and AxioVision 4.6 software (Zeiss). To evaluate possible differences in density of GABA\nA\nR subunit labeling in the\nFmr1\nWT and KO mice, sections from each animal at comparable levels of the hippocampus were processed in the same experimental run with identical conditions for each subunit. Linear black and white digital images of immunolabeling in the dentate molecular layer, from each side of the brain, were obtained under identical conditions on the same day with stabilized light levels for densitometric analysis (n=2\u20135 animals per group at each age; 4\u20136 samples per animal for each subunit). The entire molecular layer of the dentate gyrus was outlined in each image, and the densities of labeling (grey values) within this region were determined with morphometric AxioVision software. Data were analyzed with a nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, and\np\n< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nImmunogold Labeling for Electron Microscopy\nTissue preparation\nThree pairs of\nFmr1\nWT and KO animals were prepared for postembedding immunogold labeling for the \u03b14 and \u03b4 subunits of GABA\nA\nRs, as described previously (\nZhang et al., 2007\n). Following perfusion of the animals with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde, brain sections were cut coronally at 0.5\u20131 mm with a razor blade, and small blocks of the dentate gyrus were trimmed from these sections. Specimens were cryoprotected, frozen at \u2212190\u00b0C in a cryofixation unit (EM CPC; Leica Microsystems), and then transferred to a cryosubstitution unit (EM AFS; Leica), which was programmed for all subsequent steps (\nZhang et al., 2007\n). Specimens were immersed in 4% uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences), dissolved in anhydrous methanol for 24 h at \u221290\u00b0C, rinsed in methanol at \u221245\u00b0C, and infiltrated with Lowicryl HM20 resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 48 h at \u221245\u00b0C. The resin was polymerized with ultraviolet light (360 nm) for 24 h at \u221245\u00b0C and then warmed in 4\u00b0C steps to 0\u00b0C.\nImmunogold labeling\nUltrathin sections were cut on a microtome (Reichert-Jung), picked up on nickel mesh grids, and processed for immunogold labeling with previously described methods (\nPeng et al., 2014\n;\nZhang et al., 2007\n). After appropriate pre-treatment, sections were incubated in primary antiserum, rabbit anti-\u03b4 subunit (1:100; AB9752, Millipore or 868-GDN, PhosphoSolutions, no longer commercially available) or rabbit anti-\u03b14 subunit (1:200; AB5457, Millipore) in TBS containing 2% human serum albumin (HSA) for 18\u201324 h at room temperature. Sections were then incubated for 2.5 h in the secondary antisera, goat anti-rabbit IgG or F(ab\u2019)\n2\nfragment of goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Aurion; distributed by Electron Microscopy Sciences) conjugated to 10 nm colloidal gold particles, diluted 1:30 in 0.05 M TBS, pH 8.0, containing 2% HSA. After immunogold processing, sections were stained with uranyl acetate for 40 min and lead citrate for 4 min.\nQuantitative analysis\nRandomly selected series of \u03b14 or \u03b4 subunit-labeled synaptic profiles within the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus were photographed with a JEOL 100CX II electron microscope at a primary magnification of 19,000x. The localization of colloidal gold particles was determined for each symmetric synapse in the photomicrographs. Symmetric synaptic contacts were operationally defined as regions with close apposition between an axon terminal and putative granule cell dendrites at which the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes were precisely parallel. Such contacts generally included a thin postsynaptic density and some electron-dense material in the cleft between the membranes.\nFor analysis of \u03b4 subunit labeling in the\nFmr1\nWT and KO animals, synapses were classified as labeled (immunogold particles at perisynaptic or nearby extrasynaptic sites) or unlabeled (no immunogold labeling near the synapse). For analysis of \u03b14 labeling, gold particle positioning along the synaptic membranes was classified as either perisynaptic or synaptic. Labeling was operationally defined as perisynaptic if the gold particles were located either directly at the ends of the synaptic contact, within 30 nm of the ends of the synaptic contact, or along the extrasynaptic membranes that extended up to 100 nm beyond the end of the synapse. Gold particles that were located at extrasynaptic sites farther than 100 nm from the ends of a synaptic contact were not included in this analysis. Labeling was classified as synaptic if gold particles were located directly at synaptic contacts, excluding the perisynaptic sites indicated above. Synaptic labeling was further described as within the center third or outer thirds of the synaptic density.\n\nElectrophysiology\nTonic inhibition in granule cells of the dentate gyrus was studied with in vitro whole-cell recording in young adult (2 month)\nFmr1\nWT and KO littermates. To determine the contributions of the \u03b4 subunit to GABA-mediated tonic inhibition in the dentate granule cells, the effects of the \u03b4 subunit-selective agonist THIP (1 \u00b5\nm\n) and a \u03b4 subunit selective allosteric modulator DS2 (5 \u00b5\nm\n) were studied. Methods have been described in detail previously (\nTong et al., 2015\n).\nBrain slice preparation\nHippocampal slices were prepared from 2 month-old\nFmr1\nWT and KO littermates. To prepare slices, animals were deeply anesthetized and decapitated, and brains were placed in ice-cold, modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing 65 m\nm\nsucrose, 82.7 m\nm\nNaCl, 2.4 m\nm\nKCl, 0.5 m\nm\nCaCl\n2\n, 6.8 m\nm\nMgCl\n2\n, 1.4 m\nm\nNaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 23.8 m\nm\nNaHCO\n3\nand 23.7 m\nm\nD-glucose and saturated with 95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n. This solution also served for cutting 300 \u00b5m-thick coronal or horizontal slices containing hippocampus and cortex using a VT-1000 vibratome (Leica). Brain slices were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 35\u00b0C and then switched to 21\u201323 \u00b0C (RT) in normal aCSF containing 126 m\nm\nNaCl, 2.5 m\nm\nKCl, 1.25 m\nm\nNaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2 m\nm\nCaCl\n2\n, 2 m\nm\nMgCl\n2\n, 26 m\nm\nNaHCO\n3\nand 10 m\nm\nD-glucose, continuously bubbled with a mixture of 95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\ngas. Kynurenic acid (2 m\nm\n) was included in the recording solution to block ionotropic glutamate receptors and isolate tonic GABA current.\nDrug applications\nThe drugs used in the electrophysiology studies included SR95531, THIP and DS2 (all from Tocris Bioscience) and kynurenic acid (Sigma Aldrich). SR95531, THIP and DS2 were dissolved in DMSO and diluted 1:1000 into aCSF before use. For kynurenic acid, the powder was added to the fresh recording buffer at 2 m\nm\nworking concentration each time.\nElectrophysiological recording from brain slices\nFor in vitro slice studies of tonic inhibition, dentate gyrus granule cells were recorded in whole-cell mode using pipettes with a typical resistance of 4\u20135 M\u03a9 when filled with internal solution containing 140 m\nm\nCsCl, 4 m\nm\nNaCl, 1 m\nm\nMgCl\n2\n, 1 m\nm\nQX-314, 10 m\nm\nHEPES, 0.1 m\nm\nEGTA, 2 m\nm\nMg-ATP, 0.3 m\nm\nNa-GTP with pH set to 7.3. The initial studies of tonic current were performed in the absence of added GABA, since ambient GABA in healthy slice preparations was sufficient to evoke a distinct tonic baseline shift that could be detected when GABA\nA\nRs were blocked with SR95531. Such conditions were considered the most physiological and avoided the possibility that adding GABA to the bath would desensitize the high affinity \u03b4 subunit-containing receptors (\nBright and Smart, 2013\n). For subsequent pharmacological experiments, we added GABA (5 \u00b5M) to the bath in order to increase the size of the tonic current sufficiently to allow comparison of the effects of \u03b4 subunit-selective modulators in the\nFmr1\nWT and KO mice.\nNeurons in all recordings were visualized with an iXon EMCCD camera (Andor Technology) and infrared optics on an upright epifluorescence microscope (Axioskop 2 FS, Zeiss). pCLAMP 8.2 software and an Axopatch-1D amplifier were used for electrophysiology (Axon Instruments). Data were filtered at 2 kHz and acquired at a sampling rate of 20 kHz. Solutions were continuously perfused at a rate of 2 ml/min. All the drugs used bath applications for at least 5 min to ensure the effect on the recorded slice.\nAnalysis of electrophysiological data\nTonic GABA\nA\nR-mediated current was defined as the steady-state current blocked by saturating concentrations of SR95531, and its magnitude was calculated by plotting all-point histograms of relevant 30 sec segments of data. Graphs for all studies were created in OriginPro 8 and assembled in CorelDraw 12. Normally distributed data were analyzed using unpaired Student\u2019s two tailed\nt\ntests, with significance declared at\np\n< 0.05. A nonparametric Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used to assess the statistical significance of data deviating from normality. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM.\n\nImmunoblotting\nMeasurement of surface receptor subunit expression by cross-linking\nTo determine cell surface protein levels from\nFmr1\nWT and KO mice, cross-linking experiments followed by Western blot analysis were performed, as described by Browning and colleagues for surface labeling of receptors in brain slices (\nGrosshans et al., 2002\n) and used previously by the current investigators (\nLiang et al., 2014\n;\nLindemeyer et al., 2014\n;\nLindemeyer et al., 2017\n). Briefly, 400 \u00b5m thick coronal hippocampal slices were prepared using a tissue chopper (VT1200S, Leica). Slices were incubated either in ice-cold aCSF composed of 124 m\nm\nNaCl, 3 m\nm\nKCl, 1 m\nm\nMgCl\n2\n, 2 m\nm\nCaCl\n2\n, 1 m\nm\nKH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 10 m\nm\nD-glucose, 26 m\nm\nNaHCO\n3\nand oxygenated with 95%O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n, pH 7.4), or aCSF containing 1 mg/ml bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS\n3\n) (Pierce) at 4\u00b0C for 45 min, for measurements of total or internal protein, respectively. The cell-impermeable BS\n3\nbi-functionally cross-links all surface proteins leading to large molecular weight aggregates which do not reliably migrate in the gel. Therefore, only internal proteins show up in the gel of the BS\n3\nsample. The cross-link reaction was quenched with 20 m\nm\nTris wash buffer, pH 7.6, and the slices were homogenized in homogenizing buffer containing 10 m\nm\nTris, pH 8.0, 1 m\nm\nEDTA and 1% SDS. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce).\nSDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis\nProteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) using the Bio-Rad Mini-Protean 3 cell system. Proteins were transferred on a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) and blocked with 4% nonfat dry milk in TBS. Blots were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the following: \u03b4 (aa1-44) (\nJones et al., 1997\n); \u03b14 (aa379-421) (\nEbert et al., 1996\n); (both at 1 \u00b5g/ml, gift of W. Sieghart); \u03b14 (1:1000; Millipore, AB5457); or mouse monoclonal \u03b2-actin (1: 1000; Sigma Aldrich, A2228), followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000; Rockland) for 2 h at room temperature. Bands were detected using ECL detection kit (GE Healthcare) and exposed to X-ray films (MidSci).\nData analysis\nProtein signals were analyzed by densitometry using ImageQuant5.2 (Molecular Dynamics). For cross-linking experiments, the signal intensity of bands was normalized to the corresponding \u03b2-actin signal after background subtraction. Surface protein levels were calculated by subtraction of the internal protein signal (from BS\n3\n-treated slices) from the respective total protein signal (from untreated slices). Statistical comparisons were made by nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests, with\np\n< 0.05 considered statistically significant. All values are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM with n representing the number of experiments."

Manganese (III) meso-tetrakis (di-N-ethylimidazole) porphyrin or Mn\nIII\nTDE-2-ImP\n5+\n(known as AEOL 10150 in the literature) was obtained from Aeolus Pharmaceuticals.\n\nInduction of status epilepticus (SE)\nAll animal housing and treatments were conducted in compliance with NIH guidelines and following protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (~250\u2013300 grams) were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, Indiana). After a week of acclimation, rats were randomly assigned to saline or pilocarpine group. Pilocarpine rats were treated with methylscopolamine (1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (i.p.) to mitigate the peripheral cholinergic effects of pilocarpine, thirty minutes prior to subcutaneous (s.c.) injection with pilocarpine hydrochloride (340 mg/kg) to induce SE. Diazepam (10 mg/kg) was administered i.p., 90 mins after pilocarpine to attenuate SE. Age-matched control rats received scopolamine and saline instead of pilocarpine. Rats were sacrificed by CO\n2\ninhalation followed by immediate decapitation using a guillotine suitable for adult rats at 6 hours (h), 24 h, 48 h, 1 week (wk) and 6 wks following pilocarpine treatment and hippocampi and piriform cortices were dissected out for biochemical analyses.\n\nMonitoring of behavioral seizures\nBehavioral seizures were evaluated by direct observation for 6 h after initial injection and scored according to a modified Racine scale (\nRacine et al., 1972\n). Briefly, motor seizure severity was classified as follows: Class III animals displayed forelimb clonus with lordotic posture; class IV animals reared with concomitant forelimb clonus; and class V animals, in addition to having a class IV seizure, fell over. Only rats having at least 3 class III convulsive seizures every hour up to 3 h were included in the study. Direct observation confirmed that animals were having very few seizures 48 h post pilocarpine and no convulsive activity 1 wk post pilocarpine. Rats were also video monitored for 48 h prior to euthanasia in order to confirm epilepsy at the 6 wk time-point, by assessing behavioral seizures. Only animals with at least two class IV seizures according to the Racine scale were included in the study as responders. To determine the role of SE in neuroinflammation, cytokines were analyzed in the brains of rats which did not undergo SE (termed as non-responders).\n\nMetalloporphyrin administration\nPilocarpine treated rats exhibiting SE (according to the above mentioned criteria), were treated with Mn\nIII\nTDE-2-ImP\n5+\n(5 mg/kg, s.c.) also denoted in the literature as AEOL 10150 or saline for controls, starting 60 minutes after pilocarpine and every 4 hours until sacrifice (approximately 6 injections over a 24 hour time period). Mn\nIII\nTDE-2-ImP\n5+\nwas dissolved in phosphate buffered saline to achieve a final concentration of 5mg/ml. Animals were divided into 4 groups: 1) Saline-Saline 2) Pilocarpine-saline 3) Pilocarpine- Mn\nIII\nTDE-2-ImP\n5+\nand 4) Saline-Mn\nIII\nTDE-2-ImP\n5+\n. Saline- Mn\nIII\nTDE-2-ImP\n5+\ngroup had no difference compared to saline-saline animals (data not shown). Animals were sacrificed at 24 and 48 h for biochemistry and pathology.\n\nMeasurement of oxidative stress markers by HPLC\nGlutathione (GSH), glutathione disulfide (GSSG), tyrosine (Tyr) and 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) assays were performed with an ESA (Chelmsford, MA) 5600 CoulArray HPLC equipped with eight electrochemical cells as previously described in the literature (\nHensley et al., 1998\n;\nLakritz et al., 1997\n;\nLiang et al., 2007\n). One hippocampus from each rat was sonicated in 0.1N ice cold perchloric acid (PCA) and centrifuged at 13,000rpm for 10 minutes and supernatants collected. The potentials of the electrochemical cells were set at 400/450/500/570/630/690/830/860 mV vs. Pd. Analyte separation was conducted on a TOSOHAAS (Montgomeryville, PA) reverse-phase ODS 80-TM C-18 analytical column (4.6 mm \u00d7 250 cm; 5 \u00b5m particle size). The mobile phase was composed of a two-component gradient elution system with component A of the mobile phase consisting of 50 mM NaH2PO4 pH 3.0, and component B consisting of 50 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\nand 50% methanol pH 3.0. Aliquots (20 \u00b5l) of the supernatant were injected into HPLC. The level of 3-NT was expressed as a ratio of 3-NT to Tyr.\n\nMultiplex pro-inflammatory cytokine measurement\nLevels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and KC/GRO (keratinocyte chemoattractant/growth-related oncogene), were measured using a rat multiplex pro-inflammatory cytokine array from Mesoscale Discovery (MSD) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, the assay was run as follows. One hippocampus from each rat was lysed in MSD Tris Lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors in a 1:10 ratio. The lysates were then centrifuged at 13,000rpm for 10 minutes and supernatants collected. Protein concentrations were determined in the supernatants using a Bradford protein assay and 250\u00b5g of protein were loaded per well for each sample in duplicate. Calibration curves were prepared in the supplied diluent with a range of 40,000 pg/ml to 2.45 pg/ml. Prior to incubation with samples, wells were blocked for 30 minutes, following which samples were added to the wells and incubated with shaking (300\u20131000rpm) for 2 hours. The plate was then washed with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 and 25\u00b5l of detection antibody was added and incubated for an additional 2 hours. Finally, the plate was washed, MSD read buffer was added to the wells and the plate was read using Sector Imager 2400. Concentrations of analytes were determined by the measuring the intensity of light emitted at 620nm and Softmax Pro software using curve-fit models.\n\nImmunohistochemical staining for microglial activation\nWhole brains were fixed in 10% formalin for 48 hours, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin wax before cutting coronally into 12\u00b5m thick sections. Sections were deparaffined with Hemo D (xylene) and rehydrated using 100% ethanol for 5 minutes, 70% ethanol for 2 minutes and dH\n2\nO for 1 minute. They were then incubated with the primary Iba1 antibody (ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1; Wako, Code No. 019\u20131971) at a dilution of 1:500 in 1% goat serum PBS-T (phosphate buffered saline with tween 20) overnight, following which sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody (Rhodamine Red goat anti-rabbit conjugated, 1:100 in PBS-T) for 60 minutes. Sections were rinsed again, excess water drained, air dried, mounted on cover slips with DPX (Fluka) non-fluorescent mounting media and image on a fluorescent microscope.\n\nImmunoblotting\nHippocampal homogenates from rats treated with saline and pilocarpine, with or without Mn\nIII\nTDE-2-ImP\n5+\nwere utilized to blot for the expression of the phospho- and total forms of S6, ERK and JNK. 25\u00b5g of protein was run on a 4\u201320% gradient gel before transferring on to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF) membrane of 0.2\u00b5m pore size (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) and probed at 4\u00b0C overnight with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p\u2013S6, p\u2013JNK and p\u2013ERK (Cell Signaling) at a 1:1000 dilution. This was followed by washing in TBS-T prior to incubating with horse-radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:10,000) for 1 h and developed using ECL reagent (Pierce) on a Bio-Rad Chemidoc Imaging system. Bands were stripped using Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Scientific), reprobed with antibodies against total forms of S6, JNK and ERK (1:1000; Cell Signaling) and developed in the same manner as the phospho proteins. Quantification of the bands was performed by using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).\nStatistical Analysis\nAll data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical differences were analyzed by two-tailed t test or one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey or Dunnett\u2019s tests. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using Prism 5 software (Prism 5. GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nSwiss Webster mice were purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA) and bred at OSU. Pups were weaned at 21 days of age and were housed in a 14:10 light cycle with\nad libitum\naccess to food (Harlan-Teklad #8640) and filtered tap water. All procedures were approved by the OSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with NIH guidelines.\n\nExperimental protocol\nAt weaning (21 days of age), female mice underwent TBI or sham injury and were returned to their home cages for a recovery period of 7 weeks. Three cohorts of mice were used in the following experiments as depicted in\nFigure 1\n. Cohort 1 was assessed for behavioral sensitization to amphetamine (2.5 mg/kg in saline). Cohort 2 was perfused and brain tissue was collected for immunohistochemical assessment of dopamine-related markers (n = 7\u20139/group for cohorts 1 and 2). Cohort 3 was administered a single dose of ethanol (4 g/kg of 50% ethanol solution) or vehicle via oral gavage and brain tissue was collected 90 minutes later for immunohistochemical detection of immediate early gene expression (n = 6\u20137/group for cohort 3).\nFigure 1. Experimental timeline.\nOpen in a new tab\nAll experimental animals underwent an mTBI or sham injury at weaning and were assessed beginning seven weeks following injury. Cohort 1 was assessed for behavioral sensitization to amphetamine over a two-week period in adulthood. Arrows on the time line indicate days of open field testing. Cohort 2 was euthanized seven weeks following injury for immunohistochemical detection of TBI-induced disruption of dopaminergic markers. At the same time point, cohort 3 was treated with a single dose of ethanol or water then euthanized for immunohistochemical detection of immediate early gene activation in response to ethanol.\n\nTraumatic brain injury\nA single mild traumatic brain injury was conducted on 21-day-old mice as previously reported (\nKarelina et al., 2017\n;\nWeil et al., 2016b\n). Mice were anesthetized with 1.5% inhaled isoflurane and secured into a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf). The skull surface was exposed and a 2 mm diameter impactor tip (Leica) was placed onto the skull surface (\u22121 mm AP, \u22121 mm ML relative to bregma). The tip was then retracted and driven into the skull to a depth of 1 mm at a rate of 3 m/s (with a dwell time of 30 msec). The skin was sutured and animals were returned to their home cages. The sham procedure was performed identically except the impactor tip was placed on the skull surface then immediately retracted.\n\nBehavioral testing\nBehavioral sensitization to amphetamine was assessed via an open field assay. Locomotor activity in the open field was assessed in a 60 cm\n3\nPlexiglas chamber that was enclosed in a sound and light attenuating cabinet. Total movement during each 60-minute session was tracked via infrared beams and data were generated using the PAS software package (San Diego Instruments). Baseline locomotor activity was determined over a period of three consecutive days during which mice were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with saline immediately before placement into the open field. Beginning the following day, all mice were treated IP with 2.5 mg/kg amphetamine (Sigma) dissolved in saline and immediately placed in the open field chamber. Behavioral sensitization to amphetamine was assessed over a period of five consecutive days during which mice were treated daily with amphetamine and tested in the open field chamber. Mice were weighed daily to account for changes in body mass for dosing, and amphetamine was made fresh every day. After the final day of sensitization, the mice underwent a washout period of three days during which they were unmanipulated, followed by a single dose of IP saline and open field testing. Two weeks later, the mice were injected one final time with 2.5 mg/kg amphetamine and re-tested in the open field. For data processing, locomotor activity for each animal was normalized to its baseline and plotted as percent change from baseline.\n\nTissue processing and immunohistochemistry\nAll mice in cohorts 2 and 3 were overdosed with sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Forty micron sections were sliced coronally on a cryostat throughout the forebrain and collected for free-floating immunohistochemistry. Sections were washed with 0.1M phosphate buffered saline, quenched in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide, and incubated in primary antibody overnight (tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) 1:2000 AB_390204; dopamine transporter (DAT) 1:2000 AB_1586991; dopamine receptor D2 (D2R) 1:1000 AB_2094980). The following day, tissue was washed, incubated with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (AB_357235) then developed via the ABC-DAB method (Vector Laboratories). For double-labeling, tissue was incubated overnight with cFos antibody (1:1000 AB_2106783), developed the following day using DAB, washed and re-incubated overnight with a primary antibody against urocortin 1 (UCN 1:1000, developed by Dr. Wylie Vale). UCN staining was developed using NovaRED (Vector Laboratories).\nPhotomicrographs of all histology were captured at a 20X magnification through both hemispheres. Analysis was conducted using FIJI software (\nSchindelin et al., 2012\n). Dopamine-related histological images in the striatum and ventral tegmental area (VTA) were quantified by determining the optical density of staining in each hemisphere. Optical density in the striatum was obtained in a 0.04mm\n2\nregion of interest centered at approximately 1.1mm AP, 1.5mm ML, and 3mm DV relative to bregma. Optical density in the VTA was assessed within a manually outlined region of the medial portion of the VTA, approximately \u22123.08mm AP, 0.5mm ML, and 4.25 DV relative to bregma. In order to convert pixel values, optical density values were calibrated using a set of gray scale standards. Images were assessed bilaterally for two adjacent brain slices and data averaged across hemispheres and slices within an animal (with the exception of the D2R histology which is reported as ipsilateral staining as percent of contralateral). cFos and UCN expression was quantified by cell counts in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW). All UCN-positive cells (reddish brown in color) in the EW were assessed at approximately \u22123.4 mm AP, 3.5 mm DV relative to bregma along the midline. Co-labeled cFos-positive cells (dark purple/black in color) were assessed in the same region and data are presented as percent cFos-positive UCN cells.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 24 (IBM Corp.). Behavioral data were analyzed via repeated measures ANOVA as well as between-group comparisons on specific days using one-way ANOVA. Histological data in the first two cohorts were analyzed via a one-way ANOVA. The cFos/UCN data were assessed via a two-way ANOVA (injury X oral gavage condition). Data are presented as significant for p values less than 0.05. A significant overall ANOVA value was followed up by a Least Significant Difference post-hoc analysis."

    "Methods": "2.1 Endotoxin Titration\nAll mouse work was performed according to federal regulations with approval by the University Committee on Animal Resources. C57BL/6 mice (5-8-week-old males, 25\u201330 g, n = 3) received intraperitoneal (IP) injections of either saline (SAL) or LPS (50 \u03bcg/kg, 4 mg/kg, or 20 mg/kg; derived from\nE. coli\nO111:B4; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to mimic endotoxin leak during gut injury. LPS doses were tested to determine which yielded serum endotoxin levels comparable to those observed in patients admitted after cardiac arrest (\nAdrie, et al. 2002\n,\nGrimaldi, et al. 2013\n). Retro-orbital blood was collected at baseline, 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after injection for granulocyte counts using a Vetscan HM5 blood analyzer (Abaxis, Union City, CA), and endotoxin measurement using the limulus amebocyte lysate assay as used by Adrie et. al. in their clinical studies (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) (\nAdrie, et al. 2002\n). Serum samples were diluted 50-fold to minimize hemoglobin contamination for the chromogenic assay. Assessment of plasma IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 was performed using the LEGENDplex immunoassay (Biolegend, San Diego, CA). Weight and rectal temperature were recorded at each time point (\nFigure S1\n).\n\n2.2 Global Cerebral Ischemia Model\nMale C57BL/6 mice were randomized into Sham/SAL, Sham/LPS, 3VO/SAL, and 3VO/LPS groups (\nFigure 2A\n). On Day \u221210, all mice underwent basilar artery occlusion (BAO) as described (\nThal, et al. 2010\n). After recovery (Day 0), the 3VO group underwent 15 minutes of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) with controls undergoing neck dissection without occlusion. Mice were excluded if cerebral blood flow (CBF) by Laser Doppler flowmetry (Perimed, Ardmore, PA) did not fall below 70% during 3VO (\nFigure S2\n). Within 1 minute of reperfusion, groups received either a single IP injection of 50 \u03bcg/kg LPS or saline. Daily weights and rectal temperatures were recorded (\nFigure 2B\u2013C\n). Day 3 group sizes after Doppler exclusion were as follows: Sham/SAL (n = 4), Sham/LPS (n = 4), 3VO/SAL (n = 4), and 3VO/LPS (n = 3). In preliminary studies, we found that cerebral injury caused by 3VO/SAL was 24.31 \u00b1 4.39%, and injury caused by 3VO/LPS was 39.95 \u00b1 10.87%. Sample sizes for this study (n \u2265 2) were calculated using these means with \u03c3 as the standard deviation of the 3VO/SAL group. For this analysis, \u03b1 = 0.05, power = 0.9, and sampling ratio = 1.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nAnalyses of combined 3VO and systemic LPS on neurological function.

(\nTable S1\n) (\nAbella, et al. 2004\n). Domains tested included assessments of level of consciousness, spontaneous movement, gait, touch escape response, corneal reflex, and respiration. Scores for each domain ranged from 0\u20132, with 2 indicating normal function; maximal score for this assay was 12. Neurological assessments were performed on Days \u221210 prior to BAO, 0 prior to BCCAO or sham, 1, and 3 by an investigator blinded to the intervention.\n\n2.4 Immunohistochemical and Image Analyses\nTissues were removed following intracardiac perfusion, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich), cut into 25 \u03bcm sections, and stored at 4\u00b0C in cryoprotectant. Sections were washed with PBS and blocked in 10% goat serum for 1 hour at 20\u00b0C prior to immunohistochemical (IHC) staining (see\nSupplemental Methods\n&\nTable S2\n). Fluoro-Jade C staining of brain sections was performed as described (\nSchmued, et al. 2005\n). Sections were imaged using an OptiGrid Structured-Light Imaging System (Qioptiq, Fairport, NY). Cortical Ly-6B(+) neutrophil (PMN) counts and percent injury calculations based on regional loss of MAP2 staining were calculated from images taken from 5 matched, non-contiguous coronal sections spanning +1.32 and \u22122.92 mm from bregma. Percent injury based on MAP2 staining was calculated from thresholded images as the area of MAP2(\u2212) tissue divided by total cortical surface area. Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) upregulation and IgG deposition were measured by the mean gray value (fluorescence intensity) from random sections imaged at 10x magnification per animal. Fluorescence intensities were normalized to PECAM-1(+) vessel length (cm). Microglial activation was measured by the mean gray value of Iba1 from random sections imaged at 10x magnification per animal. Sholl analyses were conducted with \u226510 microglia per animal imaged at 63x magnification (\nFerreira, et al. 2014\n). PMN infiltration was estimated in lung (due to high PMN density) by measurement of Ly-6B mean gray value, and counts were obtained from random sections of liver and kidney; images for these quantifications were acquired at 40x magnification. Alveolar wall thickness was measured as the smallest orthogonal distance between 2 adjacent alveoli. Images were acquired using identical settings and values and analyzed using ImageJ (\nhttp://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/\n). Liver and kidney sections were also stained with hematoxylin and eosin to evaluate for tissue injury (\nCardiff, et al. 2014\n).\n\n2.5 Flow Cytometry\nFor flow cytometric analyses of endotoxin experiments, blood, lungs, and spleens were collected 6 hours after 50 \u03bcg/kg LPS injection. Organs were dissociated by agitation in RPMI with 1 mg/ml collagenase II for 30 minutes. For 3VO experiments, flow cytometric analyses were performed on retro-orbital blood collected at 2 hours, 4 hours, and 6 hours after experimental surgery. Whole blood was washed and lysed with red cell lysis buffer (Biolegend, San Diego, CA) for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Cells were stained with FITC-labeled anti-Ly-6G (1 \u03bcg/ml; 30 minutes, 4\u00b0C) and Alexa Fluor 647-labeled anti-CD11b antibodies (0.8 \u03bcg/ml) with 4 \u03bcl Fc receptor block per sample. Cells were later fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes (\nHighland, et al. 2016\n), and fluorescence was measured using a BD FACSCanto II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Data were collected for 10,000 events, and the following gating strategy was used: a forward\nvs\n. side scatter plot (FSC-area\nvs\n. SSC-area) was used to visually identify white blood cells and exclude debris. Gates were then manually drawn on plots of FSC-height\nvs\n. FSC-area plots to remove cell doublets. Two-dimensional plots of Ly-6G\nvs\n. CD11b were used to identity Ly-6G\nhi\n/CD11b\nhi\nPMNs, and histograms were constructed for each PMN population. Geometric mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) analyses were performed using FlowJo analysis software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR).\n\n2.6 Statistical Analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using Prism (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA) and MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Data are expressed as averages with standard deviations. In the LPS dosing experiment, changes in plasma endotoxin, cytokines, granulocyte count, weight, and temperature were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Holm-Sidak post hoc test. In experiments involving Sham/3VO and SAL/LPS, comparisons were made using 2-way ANOVA and Holm-Sidak post hoc test for cortical injury, PECAM-1 upregulation, IgG deposition, Iba1 upregulation, and PMN infiltration. Differences in microglial arborization were calculated using repeated measures ANOVA for the number of intersections at each radius from the soma. Changes in weight, core temperature, and neurological function over time were analyzed using 3-way ANOVA and Dunn-Sidak post hoc test. Relationships between PMN infiltration and cortical injury, PMN infiltration and Neurological Function Score, and CBF and cortical injury were determined with Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient.\nP\nvalues less than 0.05 were considered significant."

    "Methods": "Mice\nAll procedures were performed in accordance with NIH Guidelines and\napproved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Research\nInstitute at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital. Wild type, B6SJL, and\nB6SJLTg SOD1(G93A) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor,\nME).\n\nES Motor Neuron Differentiation\nMouse embryonic stem cells expressing GFP under the MN-specific promoter\nHB9 (HBG3 cells; kind gift from Tom Jessell, Columbia University, New York) were\ncultured on primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Millipore). For differentiation\ninto MNs, cells were lifted with trypsin and re-suspended in DFK10 culture\nmedium consisting of knockout DMEM/F12, 10% knockout serum replacement,\n1% N2, 0.5% L-glutamine, 0.5% glucose (30% in\nwater), and 0.0016% 2-mercaptoethanol. The cells were plated on\nnon-adherent Petri dishes to allow formation of embryoid bodies. After 1 day of\nrecovery, 2 \u00b5M retinoic acid (Sigma) and 2 \u00b5M purmorphamine\n(Calbiochem) were added freshly every day with new medium. After 5 days of\ndifferentiation, the embryoid bodies were dissociated and sorted for GFP on a BD\nFACSVantage/DiVa sorter.\n\nMouse NPC Isolation and Differentiation into Astrocytes\nNPCs were isolated according to methods previously described (\n80\n,\n81\n). Briefly, spinal cords were enzymatically dissociated in the\nsame way as described for astrocytes. The cell suspension obtained was then\nmixed with an equal volume of isotonic Percoll (GE Healthcare) and was\ncentrifuged at 20,000 RCF for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cells from the\nlow-buoyancy fraction (5\u201310 ml above the red blood cell layer) were\nharvested, washed thoroughly with D-PBS/PSF (Invitrogen) and plated in 60 mm\nuncoated plates. Cells were grown in growth medium (DMEM/F12, Invitrogen) with\n1% N2 supplement (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml of fibroblast growth factor-2\n(FGF-2, Peprotech) and 20 ng/ml of endothelial growth factor (EGF, Peprotech).\nCells were first grown as neurospheres and then were placed on a\npolyornithinelaminin (P/L)-coated plates, in which they grow as monolayer\ncultures. NPC cultures were found to be devoid of astrocytes, microglia, and\noligodendrocytes contaminants. Once cultures were established, NPCs from wild\ntype and SOD1(G93A) mice were used to generate astrocytes by withdrawing growth\nfactors and supplementing the medium with 10% FBS. The media was changed\nevery 2 days thereafter. Astrocytes were allowed to mature for 7 days prior to\nbeing used in the experiments described above. Highly enriched astrocyte\ncultures were obtained with no detectable levels of microglia, and\noligodendrocytes.\n\nLentiviral Transduction of Mouse Astrocytes\nThe wild type HSPB1 viral vector was generated by digestion of M13-HSPB1\nplasmid (GeneCopoeia) with BstB1 and NotI, and ligated into the pcDNA4/TO vector\n(Invitrogen), in frame with an N-terminal FLAG sequence. The FLAG-HSPB1 cDNA was\nthen PCR amplified to create a 5` BamH1 site and 3` Xho1 site.\nThis construct was then ligated into a pCSC-SP-PW (Addgene) backbone. Site\ndirected mutagenesis (Agilent) was used to generate HSPB1(G84R), HSPB1(R136W),\nHSPB1(TriA) and HSPB1(TriD) vectors (primer sequences available upon request).\nViral particles were produced as previously described (\n82\n) and delivered to astrocytes with a MOI20.\n\nCo-Culture of Motor Neurons and Astrocytes\nMurine NPC-derived astrocytes were plated in 96-well plates coated with\nhuman fibronectin (2.5 \u00b5g/mL; Millipore) at a density of\n3.5\u00d710^4 cells per well. One day later, FACS-sorted GFP-positive\nMNs were re-suspended in MN media consisting of DMEM/F12, 5% horse\nserum, 2% N2, 2% B27 plus GDNF (Invitrogen; 10 ng/mL), BDNF\n(Invitrogen; 10 ng/mL), and CNTF (Invitrogen; 10 ng/mL) and added to the\nastrocytes at a density of 1.0\u00d710^4 per well. Each plate was\nscanned every day for 6 days with the fully automated IN CELL 6000 confocal\nplate reader to capture GFP-positive cells. The IN CELL developer and analyzer\nsoftware were used to create whole-well pictures and to automatically count\nMNs.\n\nAstrocyte Viability Assays\nMurine NPC-derived astrocytes were plated in 10-cm\n2\nplates\ncoated with human fibronectin (2.5 ug/mL; Millipore) at a density of\n6\u00d710^6 cells per dish. Media was changed every 2 days. After 4\ndays, cells were washed 2\u00d7 with PBS and incubated with Accutase (Gibco)\nto lift cells from the culture dish. Accutase was neutralized with culture\nmedia, and cells were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 500 RCF. The resulting cell\npellets were re-suspended in 1 mL of 1\u00d7 PBS and viability was determined\nusing an NC-100 Nucleo-counter (Chemometec), according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s protocol.\n\nWestern Blotting\nAstrocytes were lysed in a buffer containing 20mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM\nNaCl, 2mM EDTA, 1mM DTT, 10% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM\nsodium pyrophosphate, 25 mM \u00e0-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF,\n10 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin, 10 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin, and 5 mM PMSF on ice for\n5 minutes. Lysates were centrifuged (16,000 RCF) at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nThe resulting supernatant was then boiled at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes in\n2\u00d7 Laemmli Buffer (20% Glycerol, 2%\n\u03b2-Mercaptoethanol (v/v), 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS (v/v)).\n10 \u00b5g of each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF\n(Bio-Rad) membrane. Immunoblots were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in\nTris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 hour at room temperature. The blots were then\nincubated with primary antibodies against human HSPB1, mHSPB1, SOD1, misfolded\nSOD1 or Tubulin for 1 hour at room temperature. The antibody against misfolded\nSOD1 has been previously described to be specific to human SOD1 under denaturing\nconditions and specific for mutant SOD1 isoforms under non-denaturing conditions\n(\n47\n\u2013\n51\n). Blots were then washed 3 times with TBS-T, and\nincubated with secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature, and then\nscanned using a Licor Odyssey Classic. Primary antibodies used for these\nexperiments were: Anti-HSPB1 (Ab Cam, ab2790 [1:5,000]), Anti-Hsp25/27\n(Millipore MAB3842 [1:1,000]), Anti-SOD1 (Santa Cruz sc-8637 [1:250]),\nAnti-Misfolded SOD1 (MediMabs, MM-0070 [1:1,000]), and Anti-Tubulin (Ab Cam,\nab7291 [1:10,000]). Secondary antibodies used were: Anti-Mouse 800CW (Licor,\n925\u201332210 [1:10,000]) All antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer +\n0.1% Tween-20.\n\nImmunofluorescence\nCells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and washed\n3 times with Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before the blocking solution\nconsisting of PBS with 10% goat serum, 3% BSA, and 0.1%\nTriton X-100 was applied for 1 hour. Incubation with primary antibody was\nperformed for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3 times in PBS\n+ 0.1% Triton X-100 then incubated with secondary antibody and DAPI for\n1 hour at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed 3 times with PBS +\n0.1% Triton X-100. Coverslips were mounted to glass slides using\nFluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech). Antibodies used for these experiments:\nAnti-GFAP (Ab Cam, ab4676 [1:250]), Anti-Hsp25 (ENZO, ADI-SPA-801 [1:1000]),\nAnti-Misfolded SOD1 (MediMabs, MM-0070 [1:250]), Anti-Mouse AlexaFluor 488\n(Invitrogen, A-11001 [1:1,000]), Anti-Rabbit AlexaFluor 488 (Invitrogen, A-11034\n[1:1,000]) and Anti-Chicken AlexaFluor 594 (Invitrogen, A-11042 [1:1,000]). All\nantibodies were diluted in blocking solution.\n\nStatistics\nStatistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA unpaired t-test for\nmean differences between the average of wild type control lines versus\nSOD1(G93A) derived lines and/or HSPB1 mutant lines (GraphPad Prizm Software).\nAll experiments were performed at least in triplicate."

    "Methods": "The study was approved by the local Ethics committee and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients had given their written informed consent prior to participating.\n\n2.1. Patients and clinical evaluation\nFor this pre-post study, 20 right-handed patients suffering from ET according to the diagnostic criteria of the Consensus statement of the Movement Disorder Society Group (\nDeuschl et al., 1998\n) were investigated. Three ET-patients were characterised as mixed-handed by the Edinburgh handedness inventory (EHI scores < 50) and were replaced by three further right-handed ET-patients. Twenty right-handed, gender- and age-matched healthy volunteers served as control group. To rule out a significant level of cognitive impairment, participants underwent a dementia screening test (DemTect) with cut-off below 12 (\nKalbe et al., 2004\n). Response times were evaluated in a simple task in which subjects were instructed to press a button following a visual cue.\nNo control subject was under medication potentially influencing the central nervous system, but two ET-patients took primidone and two more received propranolol. These patients were asked to discontinue their medication at least 24 h in advance of the study. All other patients were untreated. For more details on ET-patients, cf.\nSupplementary data\n.\n\n2.2. Electrophysiological recordings\nParticipants were seated in a reclining armchair with neck and back supported and EEGs were recorded using an elastic cap with 128 electrodes mounted in a spherical array (Easy-Cap GmbH, Herrsching, Germany). To maintain electrode impedances below 10 k\u03a9, conduction gel was applied. The used caps were standardized and placed according to the 10/10 system. Individual electrode locations thus resulted from interpolation from the individual 3T MRI scans and given fiducial points (see below). The relationship between electrodes and MRI was inspected visually for every subject. Additionally, activity of the\nMusculus extensor digitorum communis\n(EDC) of the right forearm was recorded using surface electromyography (EMG) electrodes while a triaxial accelerometer placed on the centre of the right wrist registered tremulous arm activity. All data were recorded on a BrainAmp\n\u00ae\nstandard amplifier (Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany), low-pass filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at a sampling rate of 5 kHz. The EMG of the EDC of an ET-patient is illustrated in\nFig. 2\n.\nFig. 2.\nOpen in a new tab\na) Mean pre-processed EMG activity of the\nMusculus extensor digitorum\ncommunis over 25 trials in one ET-patient with corresponding power spectrum for the time window of interest (1.5\u20133.5 s). b) Effect of alcohol on tremor amplitude (log difference EMG of the EDC) for ET-patients and control group. The interrupted line at 0 illustrates no difference between the two conditions with values above indicating increase and values below decrease of tremor amplitude. Signed-rank tests demonstrated a significant increase in tremor amplitude after alcohol intake for control subjects (*\nz\n= 2.20,\np\n= 0.028), whereas ET-patients' tremor amplitude significantly decreased (*\nz\n= \u2212 2.11,\np\n= 0.035). c) Group averaged coherence for all ET-patients to illustrate corresponding results to previous literature.\n\n2.3. Motor paradigm\nThe motor paradigm consisted of two conditions: i) a resting state (baseline) in which participants were asked to remain in a relaxed position with their arm supported and ii) voluntary elevation of the right forearm by about 10\u201315 cm above the arm of an armchair with an extended wrist and extended fingers for 3.5 s while their elbow remained on the arm of the chair. These short periods of postural contraction were selected to focus on neurophysiological changes underpinning the onset of sustained tremor and to avoid fatigue which may have occurred during longer trials. Our task elicited involuntary tremor in ET-patients, whereas control subjects were instructed via video to perform rhythmic movements of the forearm and wrist to mimic tremor. Both tasks were thoroughly explained in advance of the experiments and all participants received the opportunity to practise them. The sequence of conditions was randomised with an unequal allocation ratio of 2:1 (tremor vs. rest conditions). Participants were instructed to fixate the centre of a computer screen during the experiment and to avoid excessive swallowing or blinking during the tasks. Every trial consisted of a task instruction displayed for 5 s, followed by a red fixation cross (foreperiod; randomised duration between 1.3 and 4.8 s), then a green cross for the duration of the trial (3.5 s). At the end of the trial the red cross reappeared for 2.5 s (see\nFig. 1\n). Each task was repeated 18 (rest condition) and 36 times (tremor).\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nTime course of the paradigm used during the experiment. First, a short description of the upcoming task was displayed for 5 s. Then, a red cross appeared for a randomised interval of 1.3\u20134.8 s. Turning of the red cross green signalled the instructed task (either rest condition or postural tremor/mimicked tremor). The task was ended when the green cross turned red again after a fixed 3.5 s interval. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\nTo analyse modulation of tremor, after the completion of the first experiment all participants were asked to consume 1.5 alcohol units (one bottle of 330 ml, 4.8 vol% \u201cK\u00f6lsch\u201d, i.e. local lager beer) and the experiment was repeated 30 min after alcohol intake.\n\n2.4. Magnetic resonance imaging data acquisition and image pre-processing\nStructural MR images were acquired using a 3T Siemens Trio Scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). A structural data set was recorded with a twelve channel array head coil using a whole brain field of view (FoV) and with the following configuration: MDEFT-3D (T1-weighted, TR = 1930 ms, TI = 650 ms, TE = 5.8 ms, image dimension = 256 \u00d7 256 \u00d7 128, sagittal slices with a resolution of 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1.25 mm\n3\n, flip angle 18\u00b0). One ET-patient declined to undergo an MRI scan citing claustrophobia.\n\n2.5. Data pre-processing\nAll data pre-processing was carried out on a personal computer using SPM12 (see\nhttp://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/\n) and the Fieldtrip toolbox for EEG/MEG-analysis (Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen, the Netherlands, see\nhttp://www.ru.nl/neuroimaging/fieldtrip\n). Pre-processing of the EMG corresponded with standard routines, i.e. notch filtering the line noise, high-pass filtering (30 Hz), then full-wave rectification and low-pass filtering at 50 Hz with both filters using a 3rd order Butterworth filter (\nNegro et al., 2015\n). EEG and accelerometer data were high- and low-pass filtered applying separate zero-phase (forward-backward), 3rd order Butterworth filters with 0.5 Hz and 48 Hz cut-off frequencies, respectively.\nEEG artifacts were detected and discarded as follows: First, independent component analysis was performed (\nDelorme et al., 2007\n) and blink artifacts identified by visual examination were removed. Second, EEG channels were classified as poor, when their mean amplitudes were either smaller than 0.07 \u03bcV or exceeded 120 \u03bcV. In these cases, electrode channels were removed and interpolated using spherical splines (\nPerrin et al., 1989\n). For that, the fieldtrip default was used, that is channels within 4 cm distance were used to interpolate the rejected channels. All electrophysiological data (EEG, accelerometer and EMG) were downsampled to 100 Hz and epoched from + 1.5 s. to + 3.5 s (i.e. resulting in trials of 2 s duration) relative to onset of the green visual cue to ensure movement transients were avoided. Trials in which participants performed the wrong task (e.g. lifted the arm during a resting condition) were discarded.\nIn a final step, the default electrode positions delivered by the manufacturer (Easy-Cap GmbH, Herrsching, Germany) were co-registered to the individual T1-weighted and MNI-aligned MRI image. Coregistration relied on three fiducial points: a) nasion b) left and c) right pre-auricular points. In the single case of a missing structural MRI, the standard template brain implemented in SPM12 was used. Thus, at the end of pre-processing all EEG and MRI data were converted to the same coordinate system to ensure compatibility.\n\n2.6. Tremor analyses\nTremor severity was estimated for trials before and after alcohol ingestion using the root mean square (RMS) of the processed EMG. Due to higher signal-to-noise ratios, tremor frequency was assessed from the tri-axial accelerometer recordings rather than EMG. For this purpose, principle component analysis (PCA) were performed and the first principle component was extracted for further analysis. Individual tremor frequencies were identified in the respective power spectra.\n\n2.7. Spectral analyses\nPower spectra and cross-spectra were computed using Thomson's multitaper method (\nMitra and Pesaran, 1999\n;\nThomson, 1982\n). We denote the cross-spectrum between two signals\nx\nand\ny\nas\nS\nxy\nwith individual power spectra (\nS\nxx\nand\nS\nyy\n) analogously defined. Two tapers per trial were applied resulting in 1 Hz spectral smoothing. Coherence between the pre-processed EMG signal and each EEG sensor resulted from\nC\no\nh\n=\n|\n\u2329\nS\nx\ny\n\u232a\n|\n2\n\u2329\nS\nx\nx\n\u232a\n\u2022\n\u2329\nS\ny\ny\n\u232a\n(1)\nwhere \u2329\u2219\u232a indicates averaging across trials. Throughout this manuscript coherence describes phase and amplitude coupling of either cerebellar or cerebral activity with the EMG which does not necessarily imply a direct dependence or drive. Power estimates were log-transformed and coherence values were normalised to\nz\n-scores in order to reduce variance across subjects and to identify local regions of peak coupling.\n\n2.8. Sensor level analyses\nWe considered two conditions for our statistical analyses: 1) rest/baseline condition and 2) tremor condition, i.e. mimicked tremor for control subjects or postural tremor for ET-patients. The use of two conditions is important especially at deeper brain structures, where lower signal-to-noise ratios may result in spurious coherence values (\nGro\u00df et al., 2001\n). Subtracting two conditions minimises this bias. However, to account for unequal numbers of trials between rest and tremor conditions we first needed to\nz\n-transform coherence values per task in accordance with\nBokil et al. (2007)\n:\nZ\nc\no\nh\n=\nt\na\nn\nh\n\u2212\n1\n(\nC\no\nh\nc\no\nn\nd\n)\n\u2212\n(\n1\n(\nd\nf\n\u2212\n2\n)\n)\n1\n(\nd\nf\n\u2212\n2\n)\n(2)\nwith\nCoh\ncond\nrepresenting coherence values for the respective condition,\ntanh\n\u22121\nthe inverse hyperbolic tangent and\ndf\nthe degrees of freedom in that condition. The latter resulted from the number of tapers applied and the number of trials available.\nCoherence differences between tremor and rest conditions at sensor level were analysed using nonparametric, cluster-based permutation statistics to control for multiple comparisons (\nMaris, 2012\n;\nMaris and Oostenveld, 2007\n). This procedure comprised three steps: first, paired-sample\nt\n-tests were drawn between conditions. Second, clusters of adjacent data points (i.e. sensors adjacent in space) were defined using the maximum of summed\nt\n-statistics at a threshold of\np\n< 0.01. Finally, these clusters were evaluated against a reference distribution which was obtained by randomly shuffling conditions within participants 50,000 times (\nMaris and Oostenveld, 2007\n).\nGiven the nature of the two conditions, higher power during tremor has to be expected which may itself cause differences in coherence. To counteract the effects of power on our results, we additionally tested postural tremor against randomly permuted tremor activity. To do so, the trial sequence for the (tremulous) EMG within a participant was randomly shuffled 500 times while leaving EEG channels unchanged and the resulting cross-spectra were averaged. This procedure compares the original (unshuffled) data against a surrogate that preserves the same level of power in the EEG and the EMG, but dissociated temporal coupling. Statistical testing again corresponded to nonparametric, cluster-based permutation statistics using paired-sample\nt\n-tests between the real and the shuffled data with clusters being defined on maximum of summed\nt\n-statistics.\n\n2.9. Source reconstruction\nIn the past two decades the capacity to spatially filter EEG data (i.e. beamforming) has greatly improved its inferential power. Applying such techniques, the neural source of oscillatory activity may be unveiled whilst circumventing volume conduction issues (for review see\nSchoffelen and Gross, 2009\n). We employed the Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources (DICS) beamformer (\nGro\u00df et al., 2001\n). This technique has been repeatedly used to detect cerebral but also cerebellar coupling (\nGro\u00df et al., 2001\n;\nMuthuraman et al., 2012\n;\nSchnitzler et al., 2009\n) and was particularly appealing given our interest in a narrow signal band around 3\u201310 Hz (i.e. the tremor frequency). For that purpose, we first imposed a standard 8 mm\n3\ngrid covering the entire brain (\nGro\u00df et al., 2001\n). This grid was spatially normalised based on individual anatomy resulting in grid points with comparable anatomical locations across subjects. The acquired structural MRIs were used to construct individual volume conduction models, based on the boundary element method (BEM) (\nPhillips, 2000\n;\nHamalainen and Sarvas, 1989\n). This facilitated a view on how dipole sources at each grid point would project to the sensors. A \u2018common spatial filter\u2019 was applied across both task conditions. That is, all available trials (rest and tremor conditions) contributed to the computation of the cross-spectral density (CSD) matrix before individual trial data were projected through this filter. This was intended to prevent bias toward either condition. Data were Fourier transformed analogous to sensor level analysis using two tapers resulting in a 1 Hz spectral smoothing. To offset rank deficiency, the resulting cross-spectral density (CSD) matrix was regularised prior to matrix inversion by adding 10% of the average sensor power to the main diagonal (\nCraddock et al., 2016\n). Finally, power was extracted for each voxel (in the MNI grid) and corresponding coherence with the EMG signal was computed using the first principal component, that is, the dipole orientation maximising signal power.\n\n2.10. Statistical interferences of source level data\nIn a similar vein to the sensor level analysis, we first\nz\n-transformed the estimates of source level coherence (\nEq. 2\n). To circumvent a multiple-comparisons explosion we combined our sensor-space analysis results with the results from the averaged raw coherence values (see\nFig. 2\n) and a priori hypotheses about the brain regions related to tremor, and thus restricted source space analysis to broad bilateral cerebral and cerebellar regions based on the literature described in the introduction. Specifically, we restricted our analysis to those domains spanning Brodmann Areas 1\u20134 and 6 as well as the bilateral cerebellum. As we used standardized dipole locations, regions of interest (ROI) could be defined according to available atlases: for Brodmann Areas 1\u20134 and 6 and Cerebellum the SPM Anatomy Toolbox (\nEickhoff et al., 2005\n) and additionally the Automated Anatomic Labeling, (AAL,\nTzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002\n) for the supplementary motor area (SMA). Although other deep brain regions such as the thalamus may contribute significantly to tremor, we limited our analyses to superficial structures due to the loss of signal power and spatial selectivity at deeper sites (see\nFig. 2\n). The resulting de-biased coherence estimates for every voxel in the preselected ROI were tested for exchangeability of conditions with a two-tailed cluster-based permutation paired\nt\n-test (50,000 permutations, voxel cluster-inclusion criterion:\np\n< 0.01, nonparametric on individual voxels, with maximal summed\nt\n-values of neighbouring voxels as cluster statistics). This approach permits further spatial inference (e.g. laterality) within the restricted ROI domains. For the interpretation of coherence results, we additionally tested for differences between true coherence and coherence with permuted EMG (for details see description in sensor level analyses) again with a two-tailed, cluster-based dependent samples\nt\n-test (50,000 permutations, voxel cluster-inclusion criterion:\np\n< 0.01, nonparametric on individual voxels, with maximal summed\nt\n-values of neighbouring voxels as cluster statistics). Furthermore, to examine differences in locations of peak coherence between groups, we computed Hotelling's\nT\n-squared statistic and its chi-squared approximation (\nHotelling, 1931\n) using the individual locations of maximum coherence.\nIn a final step, we analysed the relationship between power and coherence changes and alcohol effects on RMS of the EMG. For this purpose\nt\n-statistics of regression coefficients for every voxel within the ROI were tested with a two-tailed cluster-based permutation tests across participants (50,000 permutations, cluster-inclusion criterion:\np\n< 0.05, nonparametric on individual voxels, with maximal summed\nt\n-values of neighbouring voxels as cluster statistics). Moreover, individual power and coherence values at locations with strongest difference between rest and tremor values (that is, SMA for ET-patients and M1 for control subjects) were extracted for each individual for the without alcohol and with alcohol conditions. This difference was related to changes in tremor amplitude due to alcohol in ET-patients and control subjects using Spearman's rank correlation."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nSeventy-two aged-matched (3 months old) adult female (n=36; 260\u2013290 g) and male (n=36; 300\u2013325 g) Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were housed in standard steel-wire mesh cages and maintained in a temperature (21 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) and light (on 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.) controlled environment with\nad libitum\nfood and water. After one week of acclimatization all rats underwent a single day of beam-walk training, which consisted of 3\u20135 trials to traverse the entire beam under 5 sec. Following training, the rats were randomly assigned to a the following groups: TBI + VEH (1.0 mL/kg; n=13 female and n=13 male), TBI + HAL (0.5 mg/kg; n=13 female and n=13 male; Sham + VEH (1.0 mL/kg; n=5 female and n=5 male), and Sham + HAL (0.5 mg/kg; n=5 female and n=5 male). All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh. Every attempt was made to limit the number of rats used and to minimize suffering.\n\nDetermination of estrous stage\nOn the morning of surgery, normal cycling female rats were evaluated for estrous stage using classic cytology. Briefly, following a vaginal smear the epithelial cells were examined by light microscopy and based on traditional distinguishable characteristics of each stage (proestrous = predominantly nucleated epithelial cells with few cornified epithelial cells and leukocytes; estrous = predominantly cornified epithelial cells; diestrous = predominantly leukocytes with some nucleated epithelial cells) the rats were classified accordingly (\nWagner et al, 2004\n;\nMonaco et al., 2013\n). Normal cycling females were used as this paradigm more closely mimics clinical TBI (3\u20134 rats from each group fit the criteria for each stage). Moreover, we have previously shown that estrous stage at the time of injury does not impact subsequent recovery (\nWagner et al., 2004\n;\nMonaco et al., 2013\n).\n\nSurgery\nCCI injury was produced as previously described (\nDixon et al., 1991\n;\nKline et al., 2010\n;\ndeWitt et al., 2011\n;\nMatter et al., 2011\n;\nBondi et al., 2014\n). Briefly, surgical anesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane in 2:1 N\n2\nO:O\n2\nand the rats were intubated and secured in a stereotaxic frame. During surgery the rats were maintained at a surgical level with 2% isoflurane and carrier gases. Utilizing aseptic procedures a midline scalp incision was made, the skin and fascia were reflected to expose the skull, and a craniectomy (6\u2212mm in diameter) was made in the right hemisphere (encompassing bregma and lambda and between the sagittal suture and the coronal ridge) with a high speed dental drill. The bone flap was removed and the craniectomy was enlarged further. Subsequently, the impacting rod was extended and the impact tip (6 mm, flat) was centered and lowered through the craniectomy until contact was made with the dura mater, then the rod was retracted and the impact tip was advanced 2.8 mm farther to produce a brain injury of moderate severity (2.8 mm tissue deformation at 4 m/sec). Core body temperature was maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C with a heating blanket. Immediately after the CCI, anesthesia was discontinued and the incision was promptly sutured. The rats were subsequently extubated and assessed for acute neurological outcome. Sham rats underwent similar surgical procedures, but were not subjected to the impact.\n\nAcute neurological evaluation\nHind limb reflexive ability was assessed immediately upon terminating the anesthesia by gently squeezing the rats' paw with forceps every 5 sec and recording the time to elicit a withdrawal response. Return of the righting reflex was determined by the time required to turn from the supine to prone position. These tests are sensitive indicators of injury severity and duration of anesthesia (\nDixon et al., 1991\n;\nKline et al., 2010\n;\ndeWitt et al., 2011\n;\nMatter et al., 2011\n;\nBondi et al., 2014\n).\n\nDrug administration\nHAL (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was prepared daily by dissolving in 1:1 dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/saline, which also served as the VEH. The dose of HAL was chosen because it has been reported to be comparable to that used clinically to control psychosis (\nRosengarten and Quartermain, 2002\n) and has been used in several brain injury studies investigating functional outcome (\nFeeney et al., 1982\n; Hovda and Feeney, 1995;\nWilson et al., 2003\n;\nKline et al., 2007\n,\n2008\n;\nHoffman et al., 2008\n;\nPhelps et al., 2015\n;\nFolweiler et al., 2017\n). Treatments began 24 hr after CCI or sham surgery and were provided intraperitoneally once daily for 19 days. The half-life of HAL using this dose and route is reported to be 2.6 hr (\nKapetanovic et al., 1982\n) and thus it was provided\nafter\nthe daily behavioral assessments to circumvent sedative effects, which may confound the results.\n\nMotor performance\nWell established beam-balance and beam-walk tasks were utilized to assess motor performance (\nDixon et al., 1991\n;\nKline et al., 2010\n;\ndeWitt et al., 2011\n;\nMatter et al., 2011\n;\nBondi et al., 2014\n). Briefly, the beam-balance task consists of placing the rat on an elevated (90 cm) narrow beam (1.5 cm wide) and recording the time it remained on for a maximum of 60 sec. The beam-walk task, modified from Feeney and colleagues (\nFeeney et al., 1982\n), and used extensively in our laboratory (\nKline et al., 2002\n,\n2004\n,\n2007\n,\n2010\n;\nSozda et al., 2010\n;\nBondi et al., 2014\n), consists of training/assessing rats using a negative-reinforcement paradigm to escape bright light and white noise by traversing an elevated narrow beam (2.5 cm wide \u00d7 100 cm long) and entering a darkened goal box at the opposite end. Beam-walk performance was assessed by recording the elapsed time to traverse the beam as well as distance traveled. The scoring criteria for distance traveled is based on a rating scale from 0 to 5, where 0 indicates an inability to ambulate beyond the start point, 1\u20134 corresponds to distal segments of 20, 40, 60, or 80 cm from the starting point, respectively, and 5 indicates traversal of the entire length of the beam (100 cm) and entrance into the goal box. Rats were trained prior to CCI or sham injury to perform the tasks without errors (i.e., maintain their balance for 60 sec and traverse the beam in under 5 sec). A baseline performance assessment was taken on the day of surgery. Performance on both beam tasks was assessed on post-operative days 1\u20135 and consisted of three trials (60 sec allotted time per trial) per day on each task. The average daily scores for each subject were used in the statistical analyses.\n\nCognitive function: acquisition of spatial learning\nSpatial learning was assessed in a Morris water maze task (\nMorris 1984\n) that has been shown to be sensitive to cognitive function after TBI (\nHamm et al., 1992\n;\nScheff et al., 1997\n;\nKline et al., 2010\n;\ndeWitt et al., 2011\n;\nMatter et al., 2011\n;\nFolweiler et al., 2017\n;\nde la Tremblaye et al., 2016\n). Briefly, the maze consisted of a plastic pool (180 cm diameter; 60 cm high) filled with tap water (26 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) to a depth of 28 cm. The maze was located in a room with salient visual cues that remained constant throughout the study. The platform was a clear Plexiglas stand (10 cm diameter, 26 cm high) that was positioned 26 cm from the maze wall in the southwest quadrant and held constant for each rat. Spatial learning began on post-operative day 14 and consisted of providing a block of four daily trials (4\u2212min inter-trial interval) for five consecutive days (14\u201318) to locate the platform when it was submerged 2 cm below the water surface. On day 19 the platform was made visible to the rats by raising it 2 cm above the water surface as a control procedure to determine the contributions of non-spatial factors (e.g., sensory-motor performance, motivation, and visual acuity) on cognitive performance. For each daily block of trials the rats were placed in the pool facing the wall at each of the four possible start locations (north, east, south, and west) in a randomized manner. Each trial lasted until the rat climbed onto the platform or until 120 sec had elapsed, whichever occurred first. Rats that failed to locate the goal within the allotted time were manually guided to it. All rats remained on the platform for 30 sec before being placed in a heated incubator between trials. The times of the 4 daily trials for each rat were averaged and used in the statistical analyses.\n\nCognitive function: probe trial (memory retention)\nOne day after the final acquisition training session (i.e., day 19), all rats were given a single probe trial to measure memory retention. In this scenario, the platform was removed from the pool and the rats were placed in the maze from the location point distal to the quadrant where the platform was previously situated (i.e., \u201ctarget quadrant\u201d) and allowed to freely explore the pool for 30 sec. The percent time spent in the target quadrant was used in the statistical analysis.\n\nHistology: quantification of cortical lesion volume\nThree weeks after surgery the rats were anesthetized with Fatal-Plus\u00ae (0.3 mL, i.p.) and perfused transcardially with 200 mL 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) followed by 300 mL 4% paraformaldehyde. The heads were placed in the perfusate for one week and then the brains were extracted, dehydrated with alcohols, and embedded in paraffin. Coronal sections (7\u03bcm thick) were cut at 1\u2212mm intervals through the lesion on a rotary microtome and mounted on Superfrost\u00ae/Plus glass microscope slides. After drying at room temperature, the sections were deparaffinized in xylenes, rehydrated, and stained with Cresyl violet. An observer blinded to experimental conditions analyzed cortical lesion volumes (mm\n3\n) by calculating the area of the lesion (mm\n2\n), which was done by outlining the inferred area of missing cortical tissue for each section (typically 5\u20137) taken at 1\u2212mm intervals as previously reported (\nOlsen et al., 2012\n;\nMonaco et al., 2013\n,\n2014\n;\nRadabaugh et al., 2016\n).\n\nStatistical analyses\nAll analyses were performed using Statview 5.0.1 software (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA) on data collected by blinded experimenters. The motor and cognitive analyses were conducted using repeated-measures analysis of variance (rANOVA). The acute neurological data (i.e., hind limb withdrawal reflex and righting reflex) as well as the data for the visible platform, probe trial, swim speed, and cortical lesion volume were analyzed using one-factor ANOVAs. When the overall ANOVA revealed significant effects, the Newman-Keuls post-hoc test was used to determine specific group differences. The results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (S.E.M.) and were considered significant when\np\n\u2264 0.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Tissue acquisition and cell cultures\nThe Ohio State University (OSU) Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the human subjects protocols for the acquisition of meningioma specimens, the diagnosis of which was confirmed by a pathologist. Fresh meningioma tissues were finely minced and digested with collagenase/dispase at 37\u00b0C overnight as previously described (\nChang and Welling, 2009\n). Primary meningioma cells, normal human meningeal cells (ScienCell), and\nNF2\n-deficient benign meningioma Ben-Men-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher) as described previously (\nBurns et al., 2013\n). All primary cell cultures were used at early passages (less than five passages).\n\n2.2. Natural compound treatment, cell proliferation assays, and flow cytometry\nA series of 23 natural compounds, including silvestrol (\nFigure 3A\n), was isolated and their structures and absolute configurations were previously reported (\nKinghorn et al., 2011\n;\nOblinger et al., 2016\n). Purified compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to 1~10 mM and then diluted for cell proliferation assays. Briefly, Ben-Men-1 and primary meningioma cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 4,000 cells/well and treated the next day with various concentrations of each natural compound or DMSO as a control. After three days, cell proliferation was assessed using resazurin, and the IC\n50\nvalues were determined (\nBurns et al., 2013\n).\nFigure 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nSilvestrol potently inhibited proliferation of meningioma cells. (A) The natural compounds used in this study and their IC\n50\nvalues in Ben-Men-1 and primary meningioma cells are summarized. Data shown are the mean IC\n50\nvalues from three independent experiments. (B) Resazurin assays for cell proliferation were performed on primary meningioma cells and Ben-Men-1 cells treated with various concentrations of silvestrol for three days. Primary meningioma cells were derived from three separate tumors (Men #1~3) and assays were performed in six replicate wells; the IC\n50\nvalues for each experiment are shown in the graph insets. The mean IC\n50\nvalue for primary meningioma cells across the three experiments was ~25 nM. Experiments on Ben-Men-1 cells were performed in six replicates, and the experiments were independently repeated three times. Data shown are the mean of the six replicate wells from one representative experiment. The mean IC\n50\nvalue for Ben-Men-1 cells across all three experiments was ~10 nM.\nCell cycle analysis of drug-treated Ben-Men-1 cells was performed as previously described (\nOblinger et al., 2016\n). A FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) was used to analyze samples after gating around the diploid population (FL2-A/FL2-W). Histograms and cell cycle distribution were determined using ModFit LT software (Verity Software House).\n\n2.3. Western blots\nSubconfluent Ben-Men-1 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of silvestrol or DMSO vehicle for 24 hours, followed by cell lysis and Western blotting according to Oblinger\net al.\n(\nOblinger et al., 2016\n). The antibodies used included anti-eIF4A1 (2490), AKT (9272), phospho-AKT [p-AKT(Ser\n473\n)] (4060), extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2; 4695), p-ERK (4370), proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40; 2691), p-PRAS40(Thr\n246\n) (2997), focal adhesion kinase (FAK; 3285), cyclin B1 (4138), cyclin D1 (2978), cyclin E1 (4129), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 5174), merlin (12888) (all from Cell Signaling Technology), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; sc-56), cyclin A (sc-751), eIF4A2 (sc-137148), and eIF4G (sc-133155) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p-FAK(Tyr\n397\n) (700255 from Thermo Fisher), and eIF4E (ab33768 from Abcam). Protein bands were detected using an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and the ECL Plus Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher) or a fluorescently-labeled secondary antibody and the Odyssey CLx imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences).\n\n2.4. Lentiviral-mediated short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) transduction\nBen-Men-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 9,000 cells/well. The next day, cells were fed with fresh DMEM/10% FBS containing 8 \u03bcg/mL polybrene and then incubated overnight with MISSION shRNA lentiviruses targeting\nEIF4A1\n(TRCN0000288729; target sequence 5\u2032-GCCGTAAAGGTGTGGCTATTA-3\u2032),\nEIF4A2\n(TRCN0000051869; target sequence 5\u2032-CGGGAGAGTGTTTGATATGTT-3\u2032),\nEIF4E\n(TRCN0000062573; target sequence 5\u2032-CCACTCTGTAATAGTTCAGTA-3\u2032) or shNon-targeting lentivirus (#SHC002V, insert sequence 5\u2032-CAACAAGATGAAGAGCACCAA-3\u2032; all from Sigma) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Two days following transduction, puromycin (Corning) was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 2.5 \u03bcg/mL. Cells were grown for another 8 days before counting on a hemocytometer. Subsequently, the cells were centrifuged, and the resulting pellets were lysed in 2% SDS with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). Equal amounts of protein were analyzed by Western blot for eIF4A1, eIF4A2, eIF4E, and GAPDH (\nOblinger et al., 2016\n). Fluorescently-labeled protein bands were captured on an Odyssey CLx Imager (LI-COR BioSciences), quantitated using Image Studio, and calculated as percent of the nontargeting control after normalization to GAPDH.\n\n2.5. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)\nArchived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of human meningioma tissues were acquired, deparaffinized, and immunostained for eIF4AI-II (sc-50354) and eIF4G (sc-133155) (both from Santa Cruz) and eIF4E (ab33768 from Abcam) as previously described (\nBurns et al., 2013\n). Quantification of immunostaining signal was performed by a pathologist and an investigator using visual analysis based on the intensity and percentage of immunopositive cells."

SAH, subarachnoid hemorrhage; Vehicle, sterile 0.9% NaCl; siRNA, small interfering ribonucleic acid; EphA4, Eph receptor A4; rEphx-1, Ephexin-1; BWC, brain water content; IHC, immunohistochemistry.\n\n2.2. Experimental design\nThe experiment was designed as follows,\nPart I\nTo determine expression of the key protein related to EphA4 dependent mechanism after SAH, 42 rats were randomly assigned into 6 groups in time course experiments: Sham (\nn\n= 6), 3 h after SAH (\nn\n= 6), 6 h after SAH (\nn\n= 6), 12 h after SAH (\nn\n= 6), 24 h after SAH (\nn\n= 6), and 72 h after SAH (\nn\n= 6). Western blots were used to detect the protein expression of EphA4, Ephexin-1, GTP-RhoA, and ROCK2 in the left hemisphere of the brain. Cellular localization of EphA4 on neurons and astrocytes was detected with IHC (Sham,\nn\n= 3; 24 h after SAH,\nn\n= 3) (\nTable 1\n).\nPart II\nTo evaluate a role of EphA4 in outcomes after SAH, 84 rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: Sham (\nn\n= 21), SAH + Vehicle (10 \u03bcL of sterile 0.9% NaCl;\nn\n= 21), SAH + 0.5 ng/\u03bcL scramble siRNA (5 ng in 10 \u03bcL of sterile 0.9% NaCl;\nn\n= 21), SAH + 0.5 ng/\u03bcL EphA4 siRNA (5 ng in 10 \u03bcL of sterile 0.9% NaCl;\nn\n= 21). Scrambled siRNA or EphA4 siRNA was injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v) 48 h before SAH. Neurological scores, brain water content (\nn\n= 6, each group), Evans blue extravasation (\nn\n= 6, each group), western blot (\nn\n= 6, each group), immunohistochemistry and Fluoro-Jade experiments (\nn\n= 3, each group) were assessed at 24 h after SAH (\nTable 1\n).\nPart III\nTo determine molecular mechanism of EphA4 downstream, 18 rats were randomly assigned into 2 additional groups: SAH + EphA4 siRNA+ rEphx-1 (50 ng in 10 \u03bcL of sterile 0.9% NaCl i.c.v and 0.5 mL of sterile 0.9% NaCl i.p;\nn\n= 9), SAH + EphA4 siRNA+rEphx-1+Fasudil (10 mg/kg in 0.5 mL of sterile 0.9% NaCl i.p;\nn\n= 9). Fasudil, a ROCK2 inhibitor, and sterile 0.9% NaCl were administered i.p 1 h after SAH induction. Western blots (\nn\n= 6, each group) and Fluoro-Jade staining (\nn\n= 3, each group) were performed 24 h after SAH in all groups (\nTable 1\n).\n\n2.3. SAH model and experimental protocol\nThe endovascular perforation model of SAH was produced in rats as described previously (\nSuzuki et al., 2010\n). Briefly, with 3% isoflurane, a sharpened 4\u20130 monofilament nylon suture was inserted gently into the internal carotid artery through the external carotid artery stump and common carotid artery bifurcation. The 3 cm suture was advanced until resistance was felt and perforated the bifurcation of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Sham operated rats underwent the same procedures, except the suture was withdrawn without puncture.\n\n2.4. Severity of SAH\nThe severity of SAH was blindly assessed at the time of euthanasia as previously described (\nSugawara et al., 2008a\n,\n2008b\n). Briefly, animals were euthanized and the brains were removed. The basal cistern was divided into 6 segments. Each segment was allotted a grade from 0 to 3 depending on the amount of subarachnoid blood in the segment. The animals received a total score ranging from 0 to 18 after adding the scores from all 6 segments. The rats that received a score of <9 were excluded from the study.\n\n2.5. Neurological outcome assessment\nNeurological impairments were blindly evaluated using an 18-point score test of modified Garcia and 4-point score test of beam balance as previously described (\nAltay et al., 2014\n).\n\n2.6. Intracerebroventricular drug administration\nIntracerebroventricular (i.c.v) drug administration was performed as reported previously (\nChen et al., 2015\n;\nTang et al., 2015\n). Briefly, rats were laid in a stereotaxic apparatus under 2.5% isoflurane anesthesia. A burr hole was drilled into the skull according to the following coordinates relative to bregma: 0.92 mm posterior and 1.5 mm lateral. The needle of a 10 \u03bcL Hamilton syringe (Microliter 701; Hamilton Company, Reno, NV) was inserted into the left lateral ventricle through the burr hole 3.3 mm below the horizontal plane of bregma. Sterile 0.9% NaCl or 10 \u03bcL rEphx-1 (5 ng/\u03bcL; MyBioSource, CA) were administered 1 h after SAH induction by a pump at a rate of 1 \u03bcL/min. EphA4 siRNA or scrambled siRNA (5 ng/10 \u03bcL, i065462, ABM Inc., Canada) was infused at the same rate 48 h before SAH induction.\n\n2.7. Brain water content\nAt 24 h after SAH, the left hemisphere, right hemisphere, cerebellum, and brain stem were separated, and each part was immediately weighed (wet weight) after removal. After dehydration in 105 \u00b0C for 72 h, brain part was weighed again (dry weight). The percentage of water content was calculated as (wet weight \u2212 dry weight)/wet weight (\nYin et al., 2016\n).\n\n2.8. Blood\u2013brain barrier disruption\nThe permeability of BBB was evaluated on the basis of Evans blue extravasation, as described previously (\nGuo et al., 2016\n). The brain level of Evans blue was determined at 615 nm for spectrophotometric quantification.\n\n2.9. Western blot analysis\nThe left hemisphere brain tissues were collected at 24 h after SAH. Western blot tests were performed as described previously (\nEnkhjargal et al., 2016\n). Briefly, Animals were euthanized at 24 h following SAH. Intracardiac perfusion with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) was performed, followed by removal of the brain and separation into left and right hemispheres. The brain parts were stored appropriately at \u221280 \u00b0C immediately until analysis. Protein extraction from the left hemisphere was obtained by gently homogenizing them in RIPA lysis buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., sc-24948) with further centrifugation at 14,000 rounds per minute at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. The supernatant was used as whole cell protein extract and the protein concentration was determined using a spectrophotometer (Thermo GENESYS 10S UV-VIS). Equal amounts of sample protein (50 \u03bcg) were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis and transfer of the samples to a nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane was blocked and incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Primary antibodies used in western bolt were anti-EphA4 (1:1000, ab5396, abcam, MA,USA); anti-Ephexin-1(1:1000, ab157594, abcam, MA,USA); RhoA Activation Assay Kit (ab211164, abcam, MA,USA); anti-ROCK2(1:1000, ab71598, abcam, MA,USA); anti-zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) (1:1000, sc10804, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA); anti-Claudin-5(1:1000, sc374221, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA); cleaved caspase-3 (CC-3) (1:1000, ab90437, abcam, MA,USA), \u03b2-actin (1:5000, I-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). Subsequently, membranes were incubated at room temperature for 2 h with the appropriate secondary antibodies (1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Immunoblots were then probed with an ECL Amersham Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences UK Ltd., PA, USA). Blot bands were quantified by densitometry using image J software (Image J 1.46r, NIH, USA). \u0392-Actin was used as loading control.\n\n2.10. Immunofluorescence staining\nThe brain slices for double-fluorescence staining was performed at 24 h after SAH as described previously (\nSugawara et al., 2008a\n,\n2008b\n). Under deep anesthesia, the rats were transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.1 mol/L PBS (pH 7.4) for 15 min, followed by 15 min of ice-cold 10% paraformaldehyde for fixation. Whole brains were quickly removed and fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde for 1 day, followed by 30% sucrose for an additional 3 days. Ten-micrometer-thick coronal sections cut by a cryostat (Leica Microsystems LM3050S) were mounted on poly-L-lysine-coated slides (Richard Allen, Kalamazoo, MI). Sections were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with anti-EphA4 primary antibody (1:200, ab5396, MA, USA), anti-GFAP (1:500, ab110062), anti-NeuN (1:500, ab104224), and anti-Iba-1 (1:100, ab107159). Appropriate fluorescence dye\u2013conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) were applied in the dark for 2 h at room temperature at a dilution of 1:500. For negative controls, the primary antibodies were omitted, and the same staining procedures were performed. Eight random microscope fields (\u00d7400) in the base of each brain coronal section were imaged by Leica DMi8 (Leica microsystems, Germany).\n\n2.11. Fluoro-Jade C staining\nApoptotic neuron death was observed by Fluoro-Jade C (TR-100-FJ, Biosensis, USA) staining, which was performed at 24 h after SAH as the instruction of the kit. Eight random microscope fields (\u00d7200) in the base of each brain coronal section were imaged by Leica DMi8 (Leica microsystems, Germany). The number of positive cells was calculated as the mean of the numbers obtained from the 8 pictures.\n\n2.12. Statistical analysis\nNeurological score were expressed as median \u00b1 25th to 75th percentiles and analyzed with Mann-Whitney tests, followed by Steel-Dwass multiple comparisons. Other values were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. Statistical significance was verified with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey multiple comparison tests. The analysis of mortality was done with \u03c7\n2\ntest.\nP\n< 0.05 were considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nExperiments were conducted in accordance with regulations set forth in the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research, and were conducted under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Washington. DBA/2J (DBA/diseased) and DBA/2J\nGpnmb+\n(D2G/control) mice were initially obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME), bred and maintained at a UW pathogen-free vivarium (South Lake Union), with new breeding pairs incorporated into the colony every year (\nInman et al., 2006\n). All animals were kept on a 12-hour light/dark schedule with ad libitum access to food and water.\nThe DBA mouse is a well-established model of glaucoma (\nHowell et al., 2007\n;\nLibby et al., 2005\n). These mice spontaneously develop mutations in\nGpnmb\nand\nTyrp1\n(\nAnderson et al., 2002\n;\nChang et al., 1999\n) that result in elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucoma with age, in a similar fashion as humans (see\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n). Animals of the following ages were used: 3 mo (young), 5\u20137 mo (6 mo), and 9\u201313 mo (aged). In early stages, the young DBA mice do not show outward manifestations of disease. By 6 months, the ON begins to retract, sight is compromised, and there is marked metabolic deficit in 42% of the mice. In the late, chronic stage, many RGCs have died, the aged mice are blind, and ATP production is severely curtailed in over 90% of the mice. Previously, we have demonstrated that the majority of DBA mice retinas have undergone significant neurodegeneration (\nBaltan et al., 2010\n;\nBuckingham et al., 2008\n;\nInman et al., 2013\n;\nLambert et al., 2008\n). In the current study, we confirmed this degeneration in the population of aged mice used in these studies by qualitative analysis of axon integrity by mitotracker staining in whole mount retinas (\nSupplementary Fig. 2\n).\nThe D2G mice serve as an ideal control for both disease and aging studies as they are genetically identical to the DBA mice, but have a functional\nGpnmb\nallele and do not develop elevated pressure or glaucoma. Age-matched animals were used in all experiments.\n\n2.2. Tissue preparation\nAnimals were anesthetized with Beuthanasia (Merck Animal Health) and eyes were removed with the ON still connected. The retina was removed from the orb, and the ON was snipped free at the back of the eye globe to include the ON head, resulting in an approximate length of 5 mm. Tissue collected for protein analysis was placed into tubes on dry ice. Ice cold lysis buffer was added in a weight-to-volume ratio of 5\u201310 \u03bcl lysis buffer per mg of tissue. Tissue collected for RNA analysis was placed in cold TRIzol\u00ae (ThermoFisher) and processed using the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\n\n2.3. mtDNA random mutation capture assay\nQuantification of random mtDNA mutations was performed as described (\nVermulst et al., 2008\n), with alterations to enhance throughput. Specifically, DNA was diluted and digested with 100 units Taq\u03b1I restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs), 1\u00d7 BSA and a Taq\u03b1I-specific digestion buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.4) for 5 h, with 100 units Taq\u03b1I added at 1-h intervals. Mutation frequencies at sites in the 12S rRNA and ND5 genes were determined via real-time PCR with primers flanking a Taq\u03b1I restriction site to quantify the number of mutant molecules, i.e., those molecules resistant to digestion. Real-time PCR was also performed with a set of control primers in a region without a Taq\u03b1I restriction site to quantify the total number of molecules. Standard curves were included to determine the relationship between copy number and cycle threshold for each primer set, and the resulting formulae were used to quantify target DNA in each well. Real-time PCR was performed in duplicate in 25 \u03bcl reaction volumes, with 12.5 \u03bcl 2\u00d7 GoTaq Hot Start Colorless Master Mix (Promega) supplemented with SYBR Green I Nucleic Acid Stain (Lonza) at 0.2\u00d7 final concentration, 500 nM each of forward and reverse primers, and diluted Taq\u03b1I-digested DNA. Reactions were thermally cycled on a CFX96 instrument (BioRad) with the following conditions: 37 \u00b0C for 10 min, 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, and 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 65 \u00b0C for 1 min, and 72 \u00b0C for 90 s, followed by 72 \u00b0C for 5 min and then held at 4 \u00b0C. Mutant molecules were verified by a post-PCR Taq\u03b1I digest and agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\n2.4. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR\nWhole retinas and ONs were removed from the DBA (disease model) and D2G (control) mice. RNA was isolated by placing the tissue into cold TRIzol\u00ae and processed using the manufacture\u2019s protocol, and amplified. For RNA analysis, it was necessary to use pooled tissue from retina and ON from age-matched DBA and D2G animal cohorts to acquire enough tissue for analysis. Each pooled sample contained tissue from three to seven animals (see\nSupplementary Table 1\n). cDNA was then prepared from the extracted RNA. The cDNAs from pooled tissue samples were probed with FAM-labeled primers for Mfn1, Mfn2, and GAPDH, a housekeeping gene used for normalization. All quantitative RT-PCR was performed in triplicate using three separate pools of each tissue type under standard cycling conditions for FAM-labeled primers. The accompanying software for the Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen) was used to visualize the data. Final analysis of the data was completed using Excel (Microsoft).\n\n2.5. DNA isolation\nTo obtain DNA, tissue samples were immersed in 1 ml of a homoge-nization solution (0.32 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8) and disrupted in a glass Dounce-type homogenizer. The homogenate was transferred to a 1.5 ml tube and centrifuged. The pellet was re-suspended in 600 \u03bcl lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml Proteinase K) and incubated at 55 \u00b0C for 3 h. DNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by isopropanol precipitation.\n\n2.6. Immunohistochemistry\nRetinal cross-sections were prepared by placing unfixed eyecups containing the retina, but not the lens, in Tissue-Tek\u00ae OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and snap freezing with liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissue was cryosectioned at 10 \u03bcm thickness. Slides were rinsed, blocked, and incubated with primary, then secondary antibodies. DAPI was applied prior to coverslipping.\nPrimary antibodies were applied in the following concentrations: anti-Mfn1 (chicken, 1:250; Novus), anti-Mfn2 (rabbit, 1:1000; AbCam), anti-NeuN (mouse, 1:1000; Chemicon), anti- ChAT (goat, 1:500; Chemicon), anti-GFAP (guinea pig, 1:250; Advanced Immuno-Chemical) all diluted in blocking solution (0.4% Triton X, 5% donkey serum in Tris Buffer). To visualize primary antibodies, a secondary antibody conjugated to RedX, cy2 or cy5 was applied at a dilution of 1:250 in blocking solution as above. Nuclei were labeled with DAPI (1:1000, Sigma) before coverslipping.\nTo validate Mfn2 antibody localization on mitochondria, retina from a mitochondrial reporter mouse was stained with Mfn2 and DAPI (see\nSupplementary Fig. 3\n).\n\n2.7. Protein sample preparations\nRetinas and ONs were removed from mice that had been lethally anesthetized. Tissue samples were placed in a tube on dry ice and weight was determined. Ice-cold Bicine/CHAPS lysis buffer (ProteinSimple), protease inhibitors, and DMSO were mixed and 5\u201310 \u03bcl/mg of tissue was added to the tube. Tissue was broken down using pipette tips to homogenize the mixture and spun to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was placed in chilled microcentrifuge tube and lysate concentration was determined using a BCA assay (Pierce). Lysates were frozen and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C.\n\n2.8. Development and validation of a quantitative nanoimmunoassay for small amounts of protein\nThe need to pool tissue from multiple animals to conduct the protein and RNA assays limited the ability to adequately evaluate changes occurring with Mfn1 and Mfn2 protein expression on an individual animal level (see Section 2.4 above). Pooled samples made it particularly diffi-cult to dissect out changes to the phosphorylated state or other variants of the protein. We sought to further characterize changes to Mfn2 and specifically look for post-translational or active kinase activity of Mfn2 during disease progression.\nWe used the NanoPro (NP) 1000 (ProteinSimple, formerly NanoPro) to develop a new nanoimmunoassay (\nNivison and Horner, 2012a\n,\n2012b\n;\nO\u2019Neill et al., 2006\n) to detect both Mfn1 and Mfn2 in individual diseased and control animals. The NP uses capillary isoelectric focusing electrophoresis to detect signals from between 0.05 and 0.1 mg/ml of total protein. The assay we developed, nanoimmuno capillary isoelectric focusing (NICIF), is a combination western blot and ELISA, with proteins being separated by an isoelectric gradient in a capillary. Cell or tissue lysates are mixed with standards in a sample buffer that creates the gradient and an electrical field separates the proteins by their isoelectric points (pI). The proteins are then immobilized at different points along the length of the capillary and can then be probed by primary and secondary antibodies. Ultimately applying a chemiluminescent signal allows the results to be measured and quantified.\nSpecifically, in developing the NICIF assays, the consistent position within the capillary of the antibody-tagged protein from each sample in relation to the standards is used to identify Mfn2 and Mfn1 protein. The NP proprietary software, Compass, then displays the signal intensity as peaks that can then be quantified. In the NICIF assay for Mfn2, these peaks occur at the approximate pIs of 6.2 and 6.5, the latter of which corresponds to the theoretical pI of 6.52 for Mfn2, further confirmation that these peaks represent the Mfn2 protein (\nSupplementary Fig. 4A\n). Each sample was run in triplicate to further clarify the actual protein signal. Other spikes tend to arise irregularly and inconsistently, and are attributable to background noise due to non-specific antibody binding. To validate the NICIF assay, several tissue types, control cells, and control antibodies were tested and cross-authenticated to further confirm the peaks for both Mfn2 and Mfn1. The antibodies with the most reproducible result and lowest background were ultimately used in the assays. See development assay protocols for more specific details (\nNivison and Horner, 2012a\n,\n2012b\n). The small, lower tracings in\nSupplementary Fig. 4B\nshow ERK levels in HeLa cells (used for assay authentication), with the upper tracings showing ERK in retinal tissue, validating the presence of detectable protein in very small sample sizes. In analyzing the data, run-to-run variability was taken into account. Therefore, most comparisons were done within individual runs, usually with groups of three samples, with each sample run in triplicate. When comparing between runs, results were best analyzed by comparing total area percentages. Baselines and areas under the curves (peaks) were calculated using the Compass software.\n\n2.9. NICIF assay preparation\nFor the Mfn1 and Mfn2 assays, lysates were diluted to a final concentration of either 0.05 mg/ml (retina) or 0.1 mg/ml (ON) and loaded in equal protein amounts using SERVALYT\u2122 4\u20137 carrier ampholyte (Universal Biologlicals) and resolved by capillary isoelectric focusing electrophoresis using the NP 1000 according to our developed protocols (\nNivison and Horner, 2012a\n,\n2012b\n). Resolved proteins were immobilized using UV crosslinking, then probed with primary antibodies in the following concentrations: \u03b1-Mfn1 (rabbit, 1:300; Santa Cruz), \u03b1-Mfn2 (rabbit, 1:25; Sigma), and \u03b1-Ubiquitin (rabbit, 1:50; Cell Signaling). Secondary antibodies (ProteinSimple) used include: goat \u03b1-rabbit biotin conjugate (1:100) and streptavidin-HRP (1:100). Luminol/Peroxide XDR was used for signal detection.\n\n2.10. Protein analyses\nPhosphorylation-specific variants of Mfn1 and Mfn2 were identified using the Lambda Protein Phosphatase assay (Millipore). Lambda phosphatase was added to protein samples and incubated for 30 min at either room temperature or 37 \u00b0C prior to performing the NICIF assay. Four controls were used: untreated (no lambda phosphatase) protein samples 1) under standard NICIF assay conditions (on ice); incubated 2) at room temperature; and 3) at 37 \u00b0C; and finally, 4) lambda phosphatase alone (no protein).\nFor the immunoprecipitation assay, protein prepared for NICIF analysis (see Section 2.7, Protein sample preparations) was treated with urea to denature the protein. Treated protein was tagged using Mfn2 antibody (see Section 2.9, NICIF assay preparation) and precipitated out. Western blot of the protein was then probed with ubiquitin antibody.\nIn Western blots, protein detection was performed using the same primary antibodies (Section 2.9, NICIF assay preparation), as well as \u03b2-actin (rabbit, 1:1000; Cell Signaling). Secondary antibodies used include donkey \u03b1-rabbit HRP (Jackson, Amersham).\n\n2.11. Imaging\nImmunohistological images were visualized with a Zeiss Axioskop2 plus microscope with an Optronics camera. Confocal images were captured with a Nikon A1R microscope and 3D image stacks were further analyzed using Imaris 7.5 software (BitPlane) (\nShen et al., 2008\n). Quantitative analysis of the confocal images was performed using Imaris MeasurementPro and ImarisCell to identify RGC nuclei and mitochondrial surface protein Mfn2, and to measure both Mfn2 proximity to the nuclei and its abundance in the cell soma. ImarisCell quantifies complex morphological relationships between cells, between cell components, and between components within a cell. Components are color coded to visually display these multiple complex relationships. Imaris MeasurementPro uses object detection features to perform complex quantifications, measurements, and statistical analyses of data extracted from microscopy images and classifies the results based on specified statistical parameters. Analysis is performed on a per cell basis on the combination of objects that meet pre-selected criteria. In this study, we used a distance of 4 \u03bcm between the nucleus and Mfn2-tagged mitochondria to define the perinuclear space, with Mfn2 tags falling outside this parameter not being considered or quantified. To eliminate background staining, only Mfn2 fluorescent signal \u22654 pixels in size was included in the analysis.\n\n2.12. Statistical analysis\nIn the NICIF assay, all samples were run in triplicate, with the average of the three used in any further statistical analysis. Most analyses were done within an individual run, to allow all background, scale, and probes to remain the same. Analyses across runs, involving all of one sample type, were done based on percentages to allow for run-to-run variability, with the closest-to-average run used for depictions or graphic quantification. Baselines for the curves (peaks) and areas under the curves were calculated using the NP-1000 Compass software. See\nTable 1\nfor total number of animals used for statistical analyses. Each animal provided two tissue samples of both retina and ON which were considered as separate samples due to eye-to-eye and nerve-to-nerve variability.\nTable 1.\nNumber of individual mice\na\nper strain and tissue type used in NICIF assays.\nMfn1/Mfn2\n3 mo\n6 mo\n9 mo\nRetina\nDBA\n15\n17\n36\nD2G\n11\n11\n27/22\nb\nON\nDBA\n4\n21\n32\nD2G\n4\n12\n24\nOpen in a new tab\na\nEach mouse provided two retina and two ON samples.\nb\n27 mice were probed for Mfn1 and 22 for Mfn2.\nAll data in this study, including those derived from the NICIF assay, are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM, except where otherwise indicated. Correlation coefficients, corresponding\np\nvalues, and outliers were calculated using GraphPad Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software) and Prism 6.0. Groups were compared using ANOVA with Welch\u2019s correction assuming a nonparametric comparison, ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, and unpaired\nt\n-tests. For all analyses, statistical significance was set at\np\n< 0.05."

    "Methods": "EAE induction and scoring\nEAE was induced in 10\u201312 week-old-female C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory: 000664) using Hooke Labs MOG\n35\u201355\nEAE Induction kits according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, mice were immunized via subcutaneous injection of 200ul of MOG\n35\u201355\npeptide in complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant. Pertussis toxin (250 ug) was injected intraperitoneally at 2 and 24 hours post immunization. Animals began showing signs of paralysis 9\u201311 days post immunization, and were graded by blinded observers according to a previously described clinical index (\nBai et al., 2012\n): 1 = limp tail, 2 = hind limb weakness, 3 = plegia of one limb, 4 = plegia of two limbs, 5 = moribund or dead.\n\nMSC culture and treatment protocols\nMouse MSC isolation and culture\nMouse mesenchymal stem cells were isolated and cultured from the bone marrow of MOG\n35\u201355\n\u2013 induced EAE mice at either 14 days (peak EAE-MSCs) or 28 days (chronic EAE-MSCs) after immunization, with the animals having a clinical score of 4 or higher. Na\u00efve MSCs were cultured from non-immunized, age-matched C57BL/6 mice. Each culture preparation consisted of MSCs derived from 4\u20136 mice, and a different culture preparation was used for each experiment. Growth medium for all mouse cultures consisted of \u03b1-MEM with GLUTAMAX (Gibco) supplemented with 10% MSC-qualified fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco).\nMSCs were isolated according to a previously published protocol (\nSoleimani and Nadri, 2009\n). Briefly, bone marrow from the tibias and fibulas was collected by flushing out each bone\u2019s central canal with a 26 \u00d7 g syringe containing fresh growth medium. Bone marrow cells were then seeded in P75 flasks (Corning) at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 10^5 cells/cm^2, with cells grown in a 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Flasks were washed twice with media 48 hours later to remove non-adherent cells, with medium changed every 2\u20133 days. Cells were then passaged using 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA (Gibco) for 2 minutes at 37\u00b0C and re-plated in P75 flasks at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 10^4 cells/cm^2. Cells derived from both na\u00efve and EAE mice were identified through immunolabeling as a purified population of MSCs (\nFigure 5\n), and were subsequently expanded with cells from passages 2\u20134 (21\u201330 days in-vitro) used for all experiments. For cell transplantation experiments, 0.8 \u00d7 10^6 MSCs in saline were delivered intravenously into EAE mice via tail vein injection at 15 days post immunization. In experiments where MSCs were first labeled with CMTPX (ThermoFisher), cells were incubated with 20 uM dye for 2 hours immediately prior to infusion according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\nFigure 5.

Data shown = mean + SEM, n = 3 experiments, ***P<0.005, One-way ANOVA. Scale bar in\n(A)\n= 50um,\n(C)\nand\n(D)\n= 20 um.\nHuman MSC isolation and culture\nFor functional studies, bone marrow aspirates were obtained from the iliac crest of patients at the Southwest Hospital of the Third Military Medical University. For molecular studies, marrow aspirates were obtained from the posterior superior iliac crest of patients at University Hospitals Case Medical Center. MS-MSCs were obtained from bone marrow aspirates derived from 3 separate female donors diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS, while na\u00efve MSCs were obtained from bone marrow aspirates from female age-matched donors. Both MS-MSCs and na\u00efve MSCs were isolated from the bone marrow aspirates and expanded under identical culture conditions at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine according to standard protocols used in the Cellular Therapy Laboratory at Case Western Reserve University (\nRomieu-Mourez et al., 2009\n). Growth medium consisted of low glucose DMEM (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS] (Gibco), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, 1% Glutamax (Gibco), and 10 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor (Peprotech). After being expanded for 2\u20134 passages, 4 \u00d7 10\n6\nhMSCs per milliliter were frozen in cryovials using Plasma-Lyte A, containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide and 5% human serum albumin as the freezing medium.\nPrior to transplantation or collection of conditioned medium, hMSCs were thawed, reseeded into P75 flasks at a concentration of 7.5\u00d710^ 3 cells / cm^ 2, and grown for 1\u20132 additional passages (4\u20137 days) in complete growth medium. 1\u00d710^6 hMSCs in saline were then intravenously infused via the tail vein into MOG\n35\u201355\n\u2013 induced EAE mice at 14 days post immunization.\n\nTissue processing & histopathology\nFor immunohistochemistry, mice were perfused transcardially, and tissue was dissected out and processed as previously described (\nBai et al., 2012\n). Antibodies used including rat anti-CD45 (BioLegend; 103101) and rat anti-CD3 (BioLegend; 100201). To assess the amount of myelin loss, sections were also stained for Eriochrome Cyanine (EC) using a previously published protocol (\nDePaul et al., 2015\n). Lesion load was calculated from six serial sections of the lumbar spinal cord by measuring lesion area and dividing it by the total area of white matter. Observers blinded to sample treatment performed cell counting and lesion load analysis. For electron microscopy, animals were perfused with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Spinal cords were then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Sigma) for 1 hour, dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin. One-micrometer epoxy sections were stained with toluidine blue and examined by light microscopy.\n\nCollection and analysis of MSC CM\nConditioned medium was collected from na\u00efve or EAE MSCs grown in P75 flasks that contained 1.5 \u00d7 10^ 6 cells; medium was collected between 21 and 24 days in-vitro, with unconditioned medium collected as a control. Conditioned medium was collected from a different culture preparation for each experiment. Conditioned medium was likewise collected from passage 3 MS-MSCs and DN-MSC between 21\u201325 DIV. Analysis of murine MSC conditioned medium was performed using the RayBio Mouse Inflammation Antibody Array C1 (Raybiotech), while analysis of human MSC conditioned medium was performed using the RayBio Human Cytokine Antibody Array C5. Arrays were treated and analyzed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Densitometric quantification of spot intensities for each cytokine was performed using ImageJ, with spot intensity values normalized to cell number. To account for any signal in the arrays that may have been due to serum proteins present in the growth medium, arrays of unconditioned medium were also analyzed and any spot intensity values observed were subtracted from values obtained for MSC conditioned medium. HGF levels were quantified via ELISA (R&D Systems).\nFor experiments where mice were treated with MSC conditioned medium, aliquots were thawed and the total amount of protein was quantified using a Pierce Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Thermofisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then 0.5 mg of total protein (approximately 100ul of medium) was delivered intravenously into EAE mice via tail vein injection at 16 days post immunization.\n\nSplenocyte culture and recall assay\nMouse splenocytes were cultured from MOG\n35\u201355\ninduced EAE mice at 14 days post induction using a previous protocol (\nZappia et al., 2005\n). Briefly, spleens were dissected out and manually dissociated in culture medium (10% FBS, 90% RPMI 1640 medium, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1%, non-essential amino acids, 1% penicillin/streptomycin), and passed through a 70 um cell strainer to generate a single cell suspension. After centrifugation cells were re-suspended in 2 mL BD Pharm Lyse Solution (BD Biosciences) for 2 minutes to lyse out red blood cells, and the purified splenocytes were re-suspended in fresh culture medium before being plated in 96 well plates, 2\u00d710^5 cells per well.\nTo test the effects of MSC CM on MOG\n35\u201355\ninduced recall, cells were cultured in medium that contained 50ul splenocyte culture medium and 50ul MSC CM or unconditioned medium (controls). MOG\n35\u201355\npeptide dissolved in culture medium (Hooke Labs) was then added to each well to a final concentration 20uM MOG\n35\u201355\nper well. Twenty-four hours later, BrdU reagent (10uM) was added to each well, and twenty-four hours after that the plates were fixed and processed according to the manufacture\u2019 protocol for BrdU Elisa (Abcam). The Stimulation Index (SI) for each treatment was calculated as SI = (Absorbance value of MOG stimulated cells) / (Absorbance value of un-stimulated cells). Experiments were replicated three times.\n\nMSC characterization\nFor characterization of mouse MSCs, cells were stained for surface markers using a previously described protocol (\nBai et al., 2009\n). Antibodies used include: anti-CD45 (Abcam: ab25386), anti-CD44 (Abcam: ab25340), anti-CD90 (BioLegend: 206101), and anti Sca-1 (BioLegend: 108101). For characterization of human MSCs, cells were stained and analyzed via flow cytometry as previously described (\nBai et al., 2009\n), with antibodies used including anti-CD90 (Abcam: ab11155), anti-CD105 (Abcam: ab2529), and anti-STRO1 (Abcam: ab190282). Differentiation of MSCs was carried out using a MSC Functional Identification Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Coverslips were stained with a 0.5% Oil-Red O solution (Sigma) to assess differentiation into adipocytes or stained with an Alkaline Phosphatase detection kit (EMD Millipore) to assess differentiation into osteoblasts. To assess proliferation, MSC treated with 10 uM BrdU (Sigma) for sixteen hours. Coverslips were then fixed for 10 minutes with 4% PFA and stained for rat anti-BrdU (Abcam: ab6326) using a previously described protocol (\nZacharaki et al., 2013\n).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 6. All statistical tests are indicated in text or figure legends, with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison tests performed post-hoc for one-way ANOVAs.\nP\nvalues of \u22640.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nStudy Approval\nAll animal experiments were approved by Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine\u2019s IACUC with adherence to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Human bone marrow cells were obtained after informed written consent from patients in accordance with a protocol approved by the institutional review board at the Cleveland Clinic or Third Military Medical University."

    "Methods": "Administration of Streptozotocin\nAll procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Case Western Reserve University. Eight- to 12 week-old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were housed under a 12 h light/dark cycle with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. One week after arrival, mice were fasted for 6 h. Mice were rendered diabetic by either a low dose, 60 mg/kg,\ni.p\n. STZ (MP Biomedicals Inc., Solon, OH, USA) injection given on 5 consecutive days or a single high dose, 200 mg/kg,\ni.p\n. injection. STZ was dissolved in sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.5) right before injections. Control mice were injected\ni.p.\nwith sodium citrate buffer. Body weights and fasted blood glucose levels were monitored weekly from the tail vein. Mice with blood glucose levels >275 mg/dl within 1 week for high dose and 3 weeks for low dose following injection were considered diabetic.\n\nAnimal Surgeries\nMice underwent both unilateral SCG axotomy and unilateral sciatic nerve transection either 5 weeks (high dose groups) or 15 weeks (low dose groups) after diabetes onset (\nFig. 1a-b\n). For SCG axotomy, the right SCG was exposed and the internal and external carotid nerves were cut where they exit the ganglion. The sciatic nerve was transected at mid-thigh level and a 1\u20132 mm piece of the distal nerve segment was removed. For\nin vivo\nregeneration, the right sciatic nerve was crushed with ultra-fine hemostats (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA, USA), effectively axotomizing a population of neurons of the L4 and L5 DRG (\nRigaud et al., 2008\n). The contralateral SCG and sciatic nerves were exposed but not injured. The contralateral SCG and L4 and L5 DRG, and sciatic nerve were used as internal controls. At 6, 24, or 48 h after injury, the mice were sacrificed by CO\n2\ninhalation and both SCG, L4 and L5 DRG, sciatic nerves, and hind footpads were removed.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nLow (60 mg/kg) and high (200 mg/kg) dose administration of streptozotocin (STZ) results in decreased weight and increased fasted blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels in mice. Low dose mice received 5 injections of STZ at 60mg/kg on consecutive days and were tested 3 months later (\na\n). High dose mice received a single injection of STZ at 200mg/kg and were tested 1 month post-injection (\nb\n). Both low (\nc\n) and high (\nd\n) dose STZ injections resulted in significant weight loss compared to age-matched controls (n=15\u201330/group) with asterisks representing a significant weight difference between groups at the final time point. Sustained hyperglycemia was observed by testing the fasted blood glucose levels (mg/dl) on a weekly basis for low (\ne\n) and high (\nf\n) dose diabetic mice (n=15\u201330/group). Hemoglobin A1c was significantly elevated in low dose (\ng\n) and high dose (\nh\n) mice compared to their age matched controls (n=15/group). * =\np\n< 0.05. ** =\np\n< 0.001.\n\nMeasurement of Hemoglobin A1c Levels\nMouse glycohemoglobin A1c was measured using the Bio-Rad Total Glycated Hemoglobin Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The measurement required that 10 \u03bcl of blood be harvested from the tail vein before the mouse was sacrificed. The assay was carried out following the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Glycohemoglobin A1c in whole blood specimens was measured in a spectrophotometer at 531nm. The data were then represented as a percentage of total hemoglobin that was glycated.\n\nBody Temperature Regulation Assay\nTo monitor the ability of the diabetic mice to regulate internal body temperature, mice were placed in a cold room (4\u00b0C) with each mouse in an individual plastic housing unit. Using a rectal thermometer, the mouse\u2019s body temperature was recorded. Temperatures were taken every 30 min for a total of 3 h. These measurements were taken one week prior to sacrificing the animals.\n\nSweat Assay\nTo measure sweating, a mold was made of the plantar surface of the hind paw with a silicone impression system using Silasoft N (Detax, Ettlingen, Germany;\nVilches and Navarro, 2002\n). Diabetic and control mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and injected with 5 mg/kg pilocarpine nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) subcutaneously to induce sweating. Approximately 0.2 ml of the silicone base and three to five drops of a liquid hardening catalyst, Silaplast (Detax), were mixed together and a thin layer was applied to the hind paw 10 min after pilocarpine injection. Since this material is immiscible with water, sweat droplets form impressions in the mold as it hardens. Each impression represents the activity of an individual sweat gland (\nKennedy and Sakuta, 1984\n). The hardened mold was removed after 5 min. The molds were imaged and individual sweat droplets were counted under a dissecting microscope. Impressions in the mold were counted within 5 foot pads on each hind paw. Each hind paw was analyzed separately and five separate mice were used for each condition (control and diabetic).\n\nVon Frey Test\nTo assess mechanical sensitivity, calibrated Von Frey monofilaments (Stoetling Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA) were used to measure the paw withdrawal threshold and frequency. Mice were allowed to acclimate for 3 min in an inverted Plexiglas chamber (10 cm \u00d7 7 cm \u00d7 8 cm) with a wire mesh grid bottom (1 cm spacing), allowing access to the plantar surface of the hind paws. When all four paws were touching the wire mesh, filaments (ranging from 0.16\u20138.0 g) were applied to the plantar surface of each hind paw for 1\u20132 s with an inter-stimulus interval of at least 10 s, being careful to avoid the toes, heel, and pads. Sudden paw withdrawal, sudden flinching, or sudden paw licking were considered a withdrawal response. The paw withdrawal threshold was calculated using the up-down method with 20 trials. Beginning in the middle of the filament series (1.4 g), ascending (if no response was observed a stronger stimulus was applied) or descending stimuli (if a response was observed). The resulting pattern of positive and negative responses was calculated using the 50% response threshold formulated from the mean of tabular values for the pattern of positive and negative responses. The frequency of withdrawal was determined using a standard monofilament (1.0 g; 4.08 mN) applied 10 times to the plantar hind paw. This data was then expressed as a response ratio to a 1.0 g stimulus. Eleven to twelve mice per condition were used to conduct this analysis.\n\nHot Plate Thermal Nociception Assay\nThe hot plate test was used to assess the response to thermal stimuli (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA). The mouse was placed on a 53.5\u00b0C hot plate, and the latency to achieve a response in the hind paw (including licking, lifting, or shaking the paw, as well as attempts to jump off the surface) was measured. The mouse was removed immediately after a response was observed or if no response occurred within 30 s. A total of three trials were conducted per mouse with a 20 min inter-trial interval. The threshold was calculated as the mean latencies for the three trials. Eleven to twelve mice per condition were used to conduct this analysis.\n\nIn Vivo Regeneration\nTwo days after a unilateral sciatic nerve crush, animals were sacrificed and sciatic nerves were removed, cleaned, pinned down straight in a 35 mm dish, and fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 to 6 h. Nerves were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA), and sectioned. After blocking, 60 \u03bcm sections were incubated in SCG10 (1:4000; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0C and then incubated in Alexa Fluor 555 secondary antibodies (1:400; Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Nerves were imaged on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope. The regeneration index was measured based on the method of\nShin et al. (2014)\n. Briefly, the amount of fluorescence was assessed using MetaMorph in a 100 pixel wide rectangle spanning the width of the nerve at the site of injury (identified by fluorescent microspheres, not shown) and another rectangle where the amount of fluorescence was 50% that of at the injury site. The distance between these two rectangles was measured and expressed as the regeneration index.\n\nReal-time PCR\nSix or 48 hours after axotomy, SCG and L4 and L5 DRG were removed, desheathed, and placed in RNALater (Thermo Fisher). Ganglia from two mice were pooled for each sample. The tissue was homogenized, and RNA was isolated using the RNAqueous Micro Kit (Thermo Fisher) and reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher). Samples were run on an ABI Step ONE Plus using Prevalidated Taqman Gene Expression Assays (Thermo Fisher) for\nLif\n,\nIl6\n, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH/\nGapdh\n), cholecystokinin (CCK/\nCck\n), galanin, growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43/\nGap43\n), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP/\nAdycap1\n), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP/\nVip\n). Relative expressions were determined using the comparative Ct model (\u0394\u0394Ct) and normalizing to GAPDH.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nGenerally, SCG and L5 DRG from diabetic and control mice were removed 48 h after injury, and the ganglia were desheathed and fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. The tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound. IHC was performed on 10 \u03bcm cryostat sections. For quantification of STAT3, a rabbit monoclonal antibody to phosphorylated STAT3 (Y705; 1:100; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) was incubated with tissue sections overnight at room temperature. After washing, the sections were incubated in Alexa Flour 555 secondary antibody (1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.; West Grove, PA, USA). Adjacent sections were labeled with an antibody against HuC/HuD (Thermo Fisher) to label all neurons in the ganglia. In all experiments, sections not exposed to the primary antibody were included for each experimental group. Images were captured at 10x or 25x magnification using HCImage software (Hamamatsu Corporation; Bridgewater, NJ, USA). Cell counts were performed using FIJI is just ImageJ (FIJI) software and expressed as the percentage of neurons positively labeled with pSTAT3 in the nucleus.\n\nMultiplex\nIL-6 and LIF proteins were measured in both SCG and DRG using magnetic bead-based ProcartaPlex Mouse Myokine Panel for the Luminex platform (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Control and diabetic mice were sacrificed 48 h after injury. SCG and L5 DRG were removed and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue from two mice were pooled for each sample. Frozen samples were homogenized via sonication in T-Per buffer supplemented with Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher) and centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7 g for 10 min. Supernatants were collected for further analyses; pellets were re-suspended with 50\u2013100 \u03bcl of additional T-Per buffer and were centrifuged a final time (1000 \u00d7 g, 10 min, 4\u00b0C) with supernatants added to final sample volume. Multiplex analyses were conducted according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, a solution containing antibody-coupled beads for LIF and IL-6 were pipetted into a 96-well microplate (25 \u03bcl/well). Twenty- five microliters of assay diluent was then added, followed by 50 \u03bcl of sample or appropriate standard. Plates were light-protected and incubated for 16\u201318 h on an orbital shaker (500\u2013600 rpm) at 4\u00b0C. Following incubation, plates were washed 3x with manufacturer-provided detergent solution using a handheld magnet to keep beads in place. Twenty-five microliters of HRP-conjugated detection antibody was added to all wells and incubated at room temperature for 1 h (shaking at 500\u2013600 rpm). Plates were washed 3x as described, and 25 \u03bcl of streptavidin-RPE was added to wells. After a final wash, 100 \u03bcl of Magpix drive fluid was added to wells, plates were vigorously shaken for 3 min, and then plates were read on a Magpix Luminex 200. Luminex Xponent\u00ae software was used to generate a standard curve for each analyte from which concentrations of unknown samples were calculated.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using Sigma Plot(Version 14). Student\u2019s\nt\n-test was used for comparison of two groups without injury, two-way ANOVA using Tukey\npost hoc\ncorrection was used for comparison of two groups with the presence of injury. All tests performed are two-tailed, with an alpha level of p > 0.05 used to determine significance. Results are reported as mean \u00b1 SEM."

    "Methods": "All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nAnimal Model\nHeterozygous DYT1 mutant knock-in mice, TorA\n\u0394E /+\n(\nGoodchild et al., 2005\n) were maintained congenically by breeding with C57BL/6J mice from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Mice were housed with a 12 h light/dark cycle. Food and water were provided\nad libitum\n. Tail DNA was genotyped using a primer pair to detect the 34 base pair loxP site in the DYT1 mutant (forward primer, AGTCTGTGGCTGGCTCTCCC; reverse primer, CCTCAGGCTGCTCACAACCAC). PCR products were run using a 2% agarose gel. Male mutant (TorA\n\u0394E /+\n) and littermate controls (TorA\n+/+\n) were evaluated between 4\u20136 months of age. The generation of \u03b2-Arr2 homozygous KO mice has been previously described (\nBohn et al., 1999\n). These mice have been backcrossed more than 12 generations to and maintained on the C57BL/6 background.\n\nIn vivo microdialysis\nMale TorA\n+/+\nand TorA\n\u0394E /+\nlittermates were anesthetized with isoflurane (1\u20133%) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. Unilateral microdialysis cannulae (CMA Microdialysis, Stockholm, Sweden) were implanted vertically above the striatum (anterior +0.6; lateral +1.9; ventral \u22121.6mm from bregma, according to the coordinates of (\nPaxinos et al., 1985\n). Two anchor screws (CMA Microdialysis) were placed behind the cannula and then fixed to the skull with dental cement. Following surgery, buprenorphine (0.03mg/kg, i.p.) was injected for pain relief. Three to four days following surgery, dummy cannulae were removed and microdialysis probes were inserted (CMA7: 2 mm, CMA Microdialysis). Mice were habituated to the microdialysis environment for 3 h while the probes were perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; 127.6mM NaCl, 4.02mM KCl, 750uM NaH2PO4, 2.1mM Na2HPO4, 2.00mM MgCl2, 1.71mM CaCl2; pH 7.4) at a constant rate of 2 \u00b5L/min for the duration of the experiment. In order to determine basal levels of ACh, three dialysate samples were collected every 20 min for one h following habituation. Following baseline, 10, 100 and 500 nM neostigmine bromide (Neo) were added to aCSF and samples were collected every 20 min for 1 h per dose in an escalating dose design for a total of 3 h. At the end of sampling, mice were killed and brains were removed and post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed brains were then sectioned using a freezing microtome (Leica SM 200R, Buffalo Grove, IL) and cresyl violet staining was used to determine accurate probe placement. All microdialysis samples were analyzed for ACh using HPLC-ED (Eicom HTEC-500 with Eicom Autosampler INSIGHT, San Diego, CA) with an enzyme reactor (Eicom, AC-ENZYM II 1.0 \u00d7 4.0mm) and a platinum electrode (Eicom, WE-PT; +450 mV vs Ag/AgCl). The mobile phase consisted of 50 mM potassium bicarbonate, 134 uM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 1.22 mM decanesulfonate (pH 8.5) and was delivered at a rate of 150 \u00b5L/min. Microdialysate sample chromatograms were analyzed based on established concentration curves for ACh (1\u2013100 nM). The limit of detection was ~10 fM.\n\nSlice preparation\nMale TorA\n\u0394E /+\n, their wild-type littermates, TorA\n+/+\nand \u03b2-Arr2 KO mice of 3\u20134 months of age were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused transcardially with ice-cold aCSF, bubbled with 95% O\n2\n-5% CO\n2\n, and containing (in mM): 2.5 KCl, 126 NaCl, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 1.25 Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 2 MgSO\n4\n, and 10 glucose. The brain was removed, blocked in the coronal plane, and sectioned at a thickness of 280 \u00b5m in ice-cold aCSF. Slices were then submerged in aCSF bubbled with 95% O\n2\n-5% CO\n2\n, and stored at room temperature (RT) for at least 1 h prior to recording.\n\nElectrophysiology\nThe slices were transferred to a recording chamber mounted on an Olympus BX50WI upright, fixed-stage microscope and perfused (2ml/min) with oxygenated aCSF at RT. A 40\u00d7 / 0.9 N.A. water-immersion objective was used to examine the slice, cholinergic interneurons were visualized on a monitor using a differential interference contrast optical system combined with an infrared filter, and a monochrome CCD camera (RC300, MTI). Electrophysiological recordings were obtained with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA), using borosilicate glass pipette pulled on a P97 puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). Patch pipette resistance was typically 2.8\u20133 M\u2126 when filled with aCSF. ChI spontaneous firing was recorded at RT (22\u201325\u00b0C) in the cell-attached configuration (seal resistance: 200 M\u2126 \u2212 > 5 G\u2126), voltage-clamp mode, at a command potential at which the amplifier current, I amp, is at 0 pA. Signals were digitized at 100 kHz and logged onto a personal computer with the Clampex 10.5 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).\n\nData analysis and statistics\nData were analyzed using pClampfit 10.5 (Molecular Device) and Prism 6.0e (GraphPad). Numerical data are presented as means \u00b1 SEM; n values represent independent observations. Basal ACh data were analyzed using an independent two-sample t-test. Neo dose response data were analyzed by repeated-measures 2-way ANOVA. Post-hoc tests were completed using Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons tests. The evaluation of statistical difference for electrophysiological experiments was performed using Wilcoxon signed rank test (matched pairs) or repeated measurement (RM) oneway ANOVA and post-hoc Bonferroni\u2019s test for multiple comparisons. Two-sample Kolmogorov\u2013 Smirnov (K\u2013S) test was used to compare ISI cumulative distribution functions pre and post treatments and RM 2-way ANOVA to compare treatment effects between genotypes.\n\nDrug source and handling\nAll drugs were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and TOCRIS Bioscience (UK). Drugs were applied by reverse microdialysis for\nin vivo\nmicrodialysis, or bath perfusion for slice electrophysiology."

    "Methods": "2.1 Animals\nMale ICR mice (8\u201310 weeks of age) were obtained from ENVIGO (Indianapolis, IN). Mice null for the \u03b17 (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor ME) or \u03b22 subunits (Pasteur Institute, Paris, France) on a C57BL/6J background were bred with wild-type (WT) littermates in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care approved animal care facility at Virginia Commonwealth University. For all experiments, mice were backcrossed for \u2265 8 generations. Knockout (KO) and WT mice were obtained by crossing heterozygote mice. Mice were housed in groups of four at 21\u00b0C in a humidity-controlled environment. Animals had\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. The rooms were on a 12-hour light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 AM) with all experiments performed during the light cycle. Unless otherwise noted, animals were promptly euthanized after experiments so as to minimize suffering. The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Virginia Commonwealth University. All studies were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\n2.2 Drugs\nPNU282987 [\nN\n-(3\nR\n)-1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl-4-chlorobenzamide] (selective \u03b17 full agonist), PNU120596 [N-(5-chloro-2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-N\u2032-(5-methyl-3-isoxazolyl)-urea] (\u03b17 nAChR PAM), PHA543613 (selective \u03b17 full agonist), SR144528 [5-(4-chloro-3-methylphenyl)-1-[(4-methylphenyl)methyl]-N-[(1S,2S,4R)-1,3,3-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptyl-2-yl]-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide] (CB\n2\nantagonist) and rimonabant (CB\n1\nantagonist) were obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) supply program (Rockville, MD). GW6471 [\nN\n-((2\nS\n)-2-(((1\nZ\n)-1-Methyl-3-oxo-3-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)prop-1-enyl)amino)-3-(4-(2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-1,3-oxazol-4-yl)ethoxy)phenyl)propyl)propanamide] (selective PPAR-\u03b1 antagonist), and N-palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) were purchased from Tocris Biosciences (Minneapolis, MN). Methyllycaconitine citrate (MLA) (selective \u03b17 antagonist) was purchased from RBI (Natick, MA). GAT107 ((3a\nR\n,4\nS\n,9b\nS\n)-4-(4-bromophenyl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3\nH\n-cyclopenta[c]quinoline-8-sulfonamide) (\u03b17 ago-PAM) was synthesized as described previously (\nKulkarni et al., 2013\n;\nThakur et al., 2013\n). NS6740 ((1,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonan-4-yl(5-(3-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl) furan-2-yl) methanone) (\u03b17 silent agonist) was prepared as previously described (Peters et al., 2004;\nPapke et al., 2015\n).\nGW6471, PNU120596, GAT107, PEA, rimonabant, and SR144528 were dissolved in a mixture of 1:1:18 [1 volume ethanol/1 volume Emulphor-620 (Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., Princeton, NJ)/18 volumes distilled water] and administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) for systemic injections. In addition to i.p. route, GW6471 was also administered intraplantar (i.pl.) and intrathecal (i.t.). PNU282987,\nPHA54613\n, NS6740 were dissolved in physiological saline (0.9% sodium chloride) and injected subcutaneously (s.c.), with the exception of NS6740, which was administered i.p. All drugs were injected at a total volume of 1 ml/100 g body weight, unless noted otherwise. All doses are expressed as the free base of the drug.\n\n2.3 Formalin test\nThe formalin test was carried out in an open, empty Plexiglas cage (29 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 13 cm). Mice were allowed to acclimate for 15 min in the test cage prior to injection. Each animal was injected with 20 \u03bcL of (2.5%) formalin to the right hind paw (i.pl.). Mice were observed from 0 to 5 min (phase I) and 20 to 45 min (phase II) post-formalin injection. The amount of time spent attending to (i.e., licking) the injected paw was recorded with a digital stopwatch. Unless otherwise noted, all experiments were performed on ICR mice. PNU282987 (0.1, 1, 10 and 20 mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle was administered 15 min prior to formalin injection. In a separate cohort, PNU282987 (10 mg/kg, s.c.) effects in the formalin test were measured in \u03b17 and \u03b22 WT and KO mice. In order to test the involvement of PPAR-\u03b1 and its site of action in PNU282987-evoked antinociception, i.p., i.t., and i.pl. injections of varying doses of the PPAR-\u03b1 antagonist GW6471 or vehicle, were injected before PNU282987 (10 mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle. For systemic experiments, GW6471 (0.2 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle was administered 30 min prior to PNU282987. For CNS experiments, GW6471 (0.2 or 1 \u03bcg/5\u03bcL/mouse, i.t.) or its vehicle were administered 5 min before PNU282987 or its vehicle. The i.t. injections were performed free-hand between the fifth and sixth lumbar vertebra in unanesthetized mice according to the method of Hylden and Wilcox (1980). For local experiments, GW6471 (1 \u03bcg/20\u03bcL/mouse) or vehicle was administered i.pl. 5 min before PNU282987 or its vehicle. Formalin test was performed 15 min after PNU282987 injection.\nTo test the effects of GW6471 on various \u03b17 nAChR modulators in the formalin test, we assessed several compounds which preferentially induce different \u03b17 nAChR conformational states (\nBagdas et al., 2016\n;\nFreitas et al., 2013a\n;\nPapke et al., 2015\n). For these experiments, the \u03b17 nAChR full agonist PHA-543613, silent agonist NS6740, PAM PNU120596, and ago-PAM GAT107 were used. PHA-543613 (6 mg/kg, s.c.), NS6740 (9 mg/kg, i.p.), PNU120596 (10 mg/kg, i.p.), and GAT107 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or their vehicles were administered 15 min after GW6471 (2 mg/kg, i.p.) or its vehicle. The formalin test began 15 min later.\nAdditionally, we assessed the pharmacological interaction between the PPAR-\u03b1 agonist PEA and PNU282987 in the formalin test. We determined the antinociceptive effects of PEA pretreatment (0, 1, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.). Following the determination of PEA dose-response curve, the inactive doses of PEA (1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg) and PNU282987 (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.) were co-administered to evaluate the possible interaction. For these experiments, PEA was injected 45 min before PNU282987 and the formalin test was conducted 15 min later.\nFinally, we investigated the possible role of cannabinoid (CB) receptors in the antinociceptive effect of PNU282987 in the formalin test. To perform this part of the study, physiologically active doses of the CB\n1\nantagonist rimonabant (3 mg/kg) or CB\n2\nantagonist SR144528 (3 mg/kg) or vehicle were injected i.p. 10 min before PNU282987 (10 mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle. Animals were administered formalin 15 min later.\n\n2.4 Statistical Analysis\nThe data obtained were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software, version 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA) and expressed as the mean \u00b1 S.E.M. Statistical analysis was conducted using one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc comparison. Student\u2019s unpaired\nt\n-test was used to analyze differences between treatment groups if further analysis needed. P values < 0.05 were considered significant."

    "Methods": "Experimental animals\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (~200 g) (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc.) were used in the current studies. All experimental protocols involving animal use were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Virginia Commonwealth University (IACUC# AM10315). Animal care was in accordance with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) and National Institutes of Health guidelines. All efforts were made to minimize the potential for animal pain, stress or distress.\n\nInduction of colonic inflammation\nTo induce inflammation in the distal colon, animals were anesthetized and TNBS was instilled into the lumen of the colon 6 cm proximal to the anus at a dose of 90 mg/kg (1.5 mL/kg of 60 mg/mL solution in 50 % EtOH) through a syringe-attached polyethylene catheter as described previously (\nQiao and Grider, 2007\n). Animals that received similar volume of 50 % EtOH enema served as control. All colonic instillations were performed under isoflurane anesthesia (2.5 %, SurgiVet, Smiths Medical PM, Inc. Waukesha, WI). Euthanasia of animals was performed at 3 or 7 days after intracolonic instillation of TNBS or vehicle. To ensure exposure of the distal colon to TNBS and vehicle, rats were held head-down by lifting up the tail for 1 min.\n\nRetrograde labeling of colonic afferent neurons\nColonic afferent neurons were specifically labeled by injecting conventional neuronal tracing dye to the distal colon as described previously by us (\nQiao and Grider, 2007\n). Briefly, the rat distal colon was exposed with a lower abdominal incision under anesthesia (2.5 % isoflurane) and in a sterile environment. Fast Blue (FB, 4 %, weight/volume; Polysciences, Inc. Warrington, PA) was injected into 10 sites (4 \u00b5L per site) in the muscular wall of the descending colon 5\u20137 cm away proximal to the external anal sphincter to label colonic afferent neurons innervating this area. Sterilized Hamilton syringe (10 \u00b5L size) was used for injection. Injections into the lumen, major blood vessels, or overlying fascial layers were avoided. The incision was closed with 4-0 sutures, and the rats were allowed to survive until the harvest of the tissues. FB injection was performed 4 days prior to TNBS instillation to ensure proper transport of the tracing dye to the DRG. These animals further underwent intracardiac perfusion and tissues were used for immunohistochemistry only.\n\nTissue harvesting\nTo collect tissues used for immunohistochemistry, intracardiac perfusion was performed to euthanize animals under anesthesia (3\u20134 % isoflurane). The oxygenated Krebs buffer (pH 7.4) (95 % O\n2\n, 5 % CO\n2\n) was first used for perfusion which was followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde. After perfusion, the spinal cord and DRG were quickly removed and postfixed for 6 h. Tissue was then rinsed in phosphate buffered saline (0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4) and placed in ascending concentrations of sucrose (20 %) for cryoprotection. L1 and S1 DRGs were collected and sectioned parasagitally at a thickness of 20 \u00b5m. Tissues from control and experimental animals were handled in an identical manner. To collect tissues used for western blot, real-time PCR, and acute culture, DRGs were freshly dissected out and either homogenized or processed for culture.\n\nLaser capture microdissection (LCM) of DRG neurons\nThe DRGs that contain retrograde tracer-labeled colonic afferent neurons were freshly frozen for cryostat sectioning. Sections (10 \u00b5m thickness) were mounted on Arcturus PEN Membrane Glass Slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and subject to LCM on a Veritas LCM System (Arcturus) equipped with multi-band filters. The microdissected cells were captured into CapSure HS LCM caps, lysized and spanned into a fresh tube for RNA extraction with Arcturus PicoPure RNA isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\nImmunostaining\nDRG sections from control and experimental animals were processed for on-slide immunostaining. Sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with blocking solution containing 3 % normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) in PBST (0.3 % Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4). Samples were then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C in primary rabbit antibody against phospho-Akt (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), or rabbit antibody against TRPV1 (1:1000, Millipore-Chemicon International Inc., CA), which was diluted in PBST containing 5 % normal donkey serum. After rinse (3 \u00d7 10 min with 0.1 M PBS), tissues were incubated with fluorescence-conjugated species-specific secondary antibody Cy3 (1:500, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 2 h at room temperature. For double staining, mouse antibody for phospho-Akt (1:300, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) was used in combination with rabbit antibody for TRPV1 or TrkA (1:750, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to examine colocalization. Following wash, the slides were coverslipped with Citifluor (Citifluor Ltd., London). Immunostaining in the absence of primary or secondary antibody was assessed for background evaluation. The specificity of the antibodies was also evaluated with western blot in the present study or pre-absorption assay published by us previously (\nXia et al., 2012\n).\nDRG cells with visible nucleus were counted with a Zeiss fluorescent photomicroscope by two investigators independently in a blind fashion to minimize any potential bias. Cells were examined in 6 to 10 sections randomly chosen from each L1 and S1 DRGs. Data from both sides of DRG for each segment in the same animal were pooled and averaged as one independent experiment (n). The number of FB-labeled cells were counted for normalization of phospho-Akt and TRPV1 immunoreactivity in these cells. The results were expressed as percentage. To avoid double counting, we chose every third section in the serial cutting for each antibody used.\n\nWestern blot\nDRG homogenates in solubilization buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 % Triton X-100, 100 mM NaF supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340, 1:100, Sigma-Aldrich) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 1 (P2850, 1:100, Sigma-Aldrich) were subject to centrifugation at 20,200 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Protein extracts were then separated on a 10 % SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5 % milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 hour and then incubated with specific primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The bands were identified by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). For internal loading control, the same membrane was stripped and re-probed with antibodies against non-phosphoprotein or \u03b2-actin. The antibodies used in this study were rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), rabbit anti-Akt (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), rabbit anti-TRPV1 (1:1000, Millipore-Chemicon), rabbit anti-phospho-4E-BP1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), rabbit anti-4E-BP1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), and mouse anti- \u03b2-actin (1:3000, Sigma). The ECL-exposed films were digitized, and densitometric quantification of immunoreactive bands was performed using the software FluorChem 8800 (Alpha Innotech, San Leabdro, CA).\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR\nTotal RNA was extracted using a RNA extraction kit RNAqueous (Ambion, TX). RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically. cDNA was synthesized using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, ABI). Following reverse transcription, quantitative real-time PCR was performed on StepOnePlus\u2122 Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems, ABI) under a condition of 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. The primers for TRPV1 mRNA detection were the pre-designed Taqman probe (Applied Biosystems). The level of TRPV1 mRNA was normalized against the expression of the internal control \u03b2-actin (using Taqman probe) in the same sample that was calculated with \u0394Ct method and expressed as fold changes (2-\n\u0394\u0394Ct\n-fold).\n\nDRG explants culture\nThe segment-matched DRG pairs were freshly isolated. L1 and S1 DRGs were used. After peeling off the surrounding membrane that wrapped the ganglion, these DRGs were acutely cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) for 2\u20134 hours before treatment. To study the effect of NGF, one DRG explant was treated with NGF (50 ng/mL) for designated time points. The contralateral DRG served as control. To study the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in NGF action, one DRG was pre-treated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (5 \u00b5M) for 30 min, followed by NGF treatment; the contralateral DRG served as control by receiving vehicle (the same amount of DMSO as the amount for LY294002) pre-treatment for 30 min followed by NGF treatment. The dose of LY294002 used here for the in vitro study was selected according to a study on the IC50 of the compound (\nBallou et al., 2007\n), and was also validated in our previous studies using this dose in cultured neurons to effectively block the activity of Akt (\nKay et al., 2013\n;\nLiu et al., 2015\n).\n\nAssessment of visceral hyperalgesic sensitivity\nHyperalgesic assessment was conducted on day 7 post colitis induction. Animals were first subject to abdominal withdrawal test in response to electronic von Frey filaments (IITC Life Science Inc., CA) stimulation to examine referred hyperalgesia (\nLaird et al., 2001\n). Animals then were subject to hyperalgesic responsiveness test to CRD. The von Frey test was conducted prior to CRD due to its non-invasive nature. All behavioral studies were performed in a blind manner.\nThe electronic von Frey filaments (IITC Life Science Inc., CA) stimulation of the abdomen was performed to assess abdominal withdrawal behavior. Briefly, the rat with lower abdominal area shaved was placed in an individual chamber provided by the manufacture (IITC Life Science Inc., CA) and allowed to acclimate for 30 minutes. The von Frey filaments were applied to the shaved area with gradually increased force (gram) until abdominal withdrawal. Each animal was tested for five times in at least 20-min intervals. The shaved area and size were kept similar on each animal and the stimulated point was randomly chosen within the shaved area. The minimum force (gram) that caused abdominal withdrawal was recorded and averaged in each animal.\nCRD stimulation was performed to assess animal hyperalgesic responses by observing abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) described previously (\nAl-Chaer et al., 2000\n). Under light anesthesia (1.5\u20132 % isoflurane), a 5\u20136-cm distention balloon was placed into the descending colon and the balloon catheter was securely fixed onto the rat tail with tapes. The rat was then placed in an acrylic cage and allowed to wake up and adapt to the environment for 30 min. CRD balloon catheter was connected to a portable sphygmomanometer to gradually induce a constant pressure at three different levels of 20, 40, and 60 mmHg. The CRD was performed three times at 3-min intervals for each rat with each measurement lasting 20s under each designated pressure. The AWR scores were recorded according to the published score criteria (\nAl-Chaer et al., 2000\n) that were: 0, no behavioral response to CRD; 1, immobile during the CRD; 2, a mild abdominal muscle contraction but no lifting of the abdomen; 3, a strong abdominal muscle contraction and lifting of the abdomen, but no lifting of the pelvic structure; and 4, body arching and lifting of the pelvic structure.\n\nDrug treatment\nTo specifically desensitize the colonic afferent neurons that express TRPV1, resiniferatoxin (RTX) was dissolved in 10 % Tween-80, 10 % ethanol, and normal saline and administered intracolonically (i.c. - into the lumen of the colon) at a dose of 250\u00b5g/kg/2 mL 10 days prior to test (3 days prior to TNBS instillation) as shown in our publication (\nXia et al., 2012\n). To completely desensitize all primary afferent neurons that express TRPV1, we injected RTX intraperitoneally (i.p) at a dose of 300 \u00b5g/kg one week prior to induction of inflammation as shown in our publication (\nQiao and Vizzard, 2004\n). The dosage chosen, route of injection, and the effectiveness of these treatments in inhibiting TRPV1 in the DRG have been sufficiently discussed in our previous publications (\nQiao and Vizzard, 2004\n;\nXia et al., 2012\n) and were also validated in this study (see\nFigure 7\n). The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (~2.4 \u00b5g/rat/daily, or ~80 \u00b5g/kg body weight) was delivered to the L4-L5 spinal cord region via an intrathecal (i.t.) catheter (No. 0007740, Alzet) connected to an osmotic-pump (Alzet 2001) as described in our previous publication (\nXia et al., 2012\n). This procedure was done under anesthesia (2.5 % isoflurane). TNBS treatment was performed on the same day following catheter/minipump implantation. The inhibitor stock was stored in DMSO solution and diluted with saline which was used as vehicle control.\nFigure 7. Desensitization of TRPV1 reduced colitis-induced visceral hypersensitivity.\nOpen in a new tab\nVisceral nociception in response to von Frey filaments (A) and CRD (B) was tested in control, colitis, colitis plus RTX (i.p), and colitis plus RTX (i.c.) treatment. Colitis enhanced visceral sensitivity detected by both methods. Desensitization of TRPV1 inhibited colitis-initiated visceral pain (A, B: n=4\u20136 for each group. *, p<0.05 vs control; #, p<0.05 vs TNBS colitis). The same animal was tested for both assessments. Von Frey test was conducted prior to CRD in the same animal. The effects of RTX on TRPV1 expression in the DRG were examined by western blot (C, D: n=3, *, p<0.05 vs control; #, p<0.05 vs TNBS colitis).\n\nData analysis\nThe results from each study were presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Comparison between control and experimental groups was made by using Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric oneway ANOVA, or the student\u2019s\nt\ntest. Differences between means at a level of p\u22640.05 were considered to be significant."

    "Methods": "Mice\nMale and female C57BL/6 (B6) and 2D2 mice (\nBettelli, et al., 2003\n) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions. All animal experiments were performed in compliance with regulations specified by the Washington University in St. Louis Animal Studies Committee.\n\nOptic neuritis induction and evaluation\nTo determine whether connectivity alterations are observed in murine ON, we examined 2D2 mice which are highly susceptible to ON (\nBettelli, et al., 2003\n). Because spontaneous demyelination in rodents is quite variable, the frequency of ON in 2D2 mice was enhanced by immunization of a cohort of 16 2D2 mice with a low dose of the 35\u201355 peptide fragment of MOG (MOG\n35\u201355\n) in Complete Freunds Adjuvant (CFA) (\nBettelli, et al., 2003\n). Approximately four weeks later (range: 24\u201328 days), ON was assessed histologically and detected in nine 2D2 mice (\u201cON+\u201d). Optic nerves from all mice were dissected and frozen in OCT (Tissue-Tek) before sectioning at 4 \u03bcm. Tissue was stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and scored for inflammatory infiltrates according to an established protocol (\nWu, et al., 2011\n). Spatial visual acuity was performed using a virtual optomotor system (OptoMotry; CerebralMechanics, Lethbride, Alberta, Canada) as described (\nDouglas, et al., 2005\n). All mice were tested with both clockwise and counter-clockwise variable spatial frequency sine wave patterns. Visual thresholds for each animal were defined as the highest spatial frequency the animal could track as determined by the same observer masked to genotype. A cohort of seven 2D2 mice that did not develop ON served as controls. Additionally, because naive 2D2 mice are genetically identical to B6 mice except for the T cell receptor transgene directing T cell recognition of MOG, four B6 mice immunized with low-dose MOG\n35\u201355\nthat did not develop ON were added to the 2D2 cohort without ON, producing a total of 11 mice without ON (\u201cON\u2212\u201c), (\nFig. 1A\n).\nFigure 1. Altered FC over time in a murine model of ON.\nOpen in a new tab\n(\nA\n) Experimental design consisting of a baseline OptoMotry and fcOIS session, immunization with MOG\n35\u201355\n, and a second OptoMotry and fcOIS session for all 2D2 and B6 mice included in the study. Subsequently, optic nerves were harvested and scored for extent of inflammation to determine ON status. (\nB\n) Representative images from an unaffected optic nerve (inflammation score = 0, top) and with inflammatory infiltrates categorized as ON (inflammation score = 3, bottom). (\nC\n) Seed-based homotopic FC maps of visual, motor, and retrosplenial networks for the unaffected (WT+2D2) and ON groups at pre- and post-immunization time points. (\nD\n) Significant longitudinal reduction (p<0.001) in FC bilaterality in the visual network that was also significantly lower (p = 0.001) cross-sectionally in ON+ compared to ON\u2212 at the post-immunization timepoint. (\nE\n) Longitudinal group-wise OptoMotry performance scores are significantly reduced (p<0.05) in the ON+ group (n=9) but not in ON\u2212 mice (n=11).\n\nConnectivity imaging\nFcOIS acquisition was carried out using a previously described imaging system and approach (\nWhite, et al., 2011\n). Following intraperitoneal injection of 86.9 mg/kg of Ketamine and 13.4 mg/kg of Xylazine for anesthesia along with local Lidocaine injection and resection of the scalp, mice were placed on a heating pad maintained at 37\u00b0C (mTCII, Cell Microcontrols) while their heads were secured in a stereotactic frame. Sequential illumination was provided by LEDs at four wavelengths (LEDs; 478 nm, 588 nm, 610 nm, and 625 nm; RLS-5B475-S, B5B-4343-TY, B5B435-30S, and OSCR5111A-WY, respectively, Roithner Lasertechnik) and a cooled, frame-transfer EMCCD camera (iXon 897, Andor Technologies) was used for image detection with a field of view of approximately 1cm\n2\n, The LEDs and camera were time synchronized and externally triggered using custom software (MATLAB, Mathworks). A frame-rate of 120 Hz was used to acquire images at 30 Hz with four temporally encoded wavelengths. To minimize specular reflection from the surface of the mouse skull, crossed linear polarizers were placed immediately in front of the LEDs and the camera lens.\n\nImage processing and FC analysis\nImage processing and analysis approaches have been previously described (\nWhite, et al., 2011\n). In brief, images were spatially binned from full frame 512\u00d7512 pixels to 128\u00d7128 pixels. Changes in light reflectance were converted to differential changes in concentration of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin using the Modified Beer-Lambert Law. Images were then temporally filtered over the canonical FC frequency band (0.009Hz-0.08Hz), spatially smoothed with a 5\u00d75 Gaussian kernel, and down-sampled from ~30Hz to 1Hz. Finally, the global signal (mean time series across the skull) was regressed from the time series at every pixel to remove global sources of shared variance. Using the Paxinos histological atlas as a reference, cortical fcOIS was measured based on 0.5 mm diameter circles. These seeds sampled the time series from the left and right visual, motor, retrosplenial, somatosensory, parietal, cingulate, and auditory networks (\nWhite, et al., 2011\n). All time series within a seed were averaged and were correlated against the time series at every pixel over the brain to construct seed-based FC maps. FC maps from each imaging session were Fisher z-transformed before being averaged within and across mice and subsequently back-transformed for plotting.\n\nStatistical analysis\nOnce determination of ON was histologically determined at the conclusion of the experiment, OptoMotry scores and imaging data were segregated based on extent of optic nerve inflammation. A given mouse was classified with ON if at least one optic nerve had an inflammation score \u2265 2 (\nWu, et al., 2011\n). Post-hoc Welch\u2019s unequal variances t-test and paired Student\u2019s t-tests used to examine longitudinal changes in OptoMotry performance and bilateral FC scores. All FC correlation values were first Fisher z-transformed before all statistical analysis."

    "Methods": "Subjects and pre-surgical procedures\nFifty-one adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, Indiana) were paired in ventilated polycarbonate rat cages and maintained in a temperature (21 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) and light (on 0700-1900 h) controlled environment with food and water available ad libitum. During the week of acclimatization the rats were pre-trained on the beam-walk task to ensure that they could traverse the entire length of the beam effortlessly, typically in under 5 sec. On the morning of surgery, the rats were pre-assessed on the beam-balance and beam-walk tasks to determine baseline performance.\n\nSurgery and acute neurological evaluation\nRats weighing 300\u2013325 g on the day of surgery were subjected to a controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury as previously described (\nDixon et al., 1991\n,\nKline et al., 2000\n,\n2007\n,\n2010\n,\n2012\n;\nHoffman et al., 2008\n;\nBondi et al., 2014\n;\nLeary et al., 2017\n). Briefly, a surgical level of anesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane in 2:1 N\n2\nO:O\n2\nand then the rats underwent an endotracheal intubation and secured in a stereotaxic frame and ventilated mechanically. The surgical plane of anesthesia was maintained with 2% isoflurane. Core temperature was maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C with a heating pad. Utilizing aseptic procedures a midline scalp incision was made, the skull was exposed, and a craniectomy (6-mm in diameter) was made in the right hemisphere with a hand held trephine. The bone flap was removed and the craniectomy was enlarged further to accommodate the impact tip (6 mm, flat), which was centered and lowered through the craniectomy until it touched the dura mater, then the rod was retracted and the impact tip was advanced 2.8 mm farther to produce a moderate-to-severe brain injury (2.8 mm tissue deformation at 4 m/sec). Anesthesia was discontinued immediately after the impact and the incision was promptly closed. Once sutured, the rats were extubated and assessed for acute neurological outcome. Sham rats underwent all surgical procedures, except the impact.\n\nAcute neurological evaluation\nHind limb reflexive ability was assessed immediately following the cessation of anesthesia and removal from the stereotaxic apparatus by gently squeezing the rats\u2019 paw every 5 sec and recording the time to elicit a withdrawal response. Return of the righting reflex was determined by the time required to turn from the supine to prone position on three consecutive trials. These neurological indices are used to determine the level of injury severity (\nKline et al., 2007\n,\n2010\n;\nHoffman et al., 2008\n;\nMonaco et al., 2013\n,\n2014\n). Following the acute neurological assessment the rats were randomly assigned to three TBI (n=12 per condition) and three sham control (n=5 per condition) groups.\n\nHousing conditions: standard and environmental manipulation\nAfter the effects of surgical anesthesia abated (as evidenced by spontaneous movement in the holding cage), all the rats were returned to the colony and placed in typical laboratory shoebox cages (37\u00d725\u00d718 cm, 2 rats per cage) with\nad libitum\nfood and water. Beginning at 9:00 a.m. the following morning, the rats randomized to a single 6-hr enrichment session were removed from the STD cages and placed in the EE cages until 3:00 p.m., at which time they were returned to STD housing. The rats assigned to two 3-hr sessions were also removed from STD conditions at 9:00 a.m. and returned to the STD cages at 12:00 p.m. where they remained until 3:00 p.m. and then placed back into enrichment until 6:00 p.m. These rehabilitative manipulations occurred each day for 21 days. Briefly, the EE is a specifically designed steel-wire cage (91\u00d776\u00d750 cm) that consists of three levels with ladders to ambulate from one level to another and contains various toys (e.g., balls, blocks, and tubes), nesting materials (e.g., paper towels), and\nad libitum\nfood and water (\nKline et al., 2007\n;\nSozda et al., 2010\n). Ten to twelve rats, which included TBI and sham controls, were housed in the EE together to minimize variability among the groups.\n\nMotor performance\nWell-established beam-balance and beam-walk tasks were utilized to assess motor function (\nKline et al., 2010\n,\n2012\n;\nCheng et al., 2008\n,\n2012\n,\n2016\n). Briefly, the beam-balance task consisted of placing the rat on an elevated narrow beam (1.5 cm wide) and recording the time it remained on for a maximum of 60 sec. The beam-walk test consisted of recording the elapsed time to traverse the beam (2.5 cm wide \u00d7 100 cm long). Baseline performance was assessed 1 hr prior to surgery. Following surgery, testing was conducted on days 1\u20135, and consisted of three trials (60 sec allotted time with an inter-trial interval of 30 sec) per day on each task. The average daily scores for each subject were used in the statistical analyses.\n\nCognitive function: acquisition of spatial learning\nSpatial learning was assessed in a Morris water maze task (\nMorris 1984\n) that has been shown to be sensitive to cognitive function after TBI (\nKline et al., 2002a\n,\nb\n,\n2007\n,\n2010\n,\n2012\n;\nOlsen et al., 2012\n;\nHamm et al., 1996\n;\nLyeth et al., 1990\n;\nBramlett et al., 2016\n). Briefly, the maze consisted of a plastic pool (180 cm diameter; 60 cm high) filled with tap water (26 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) to a depth of 28 cm and was situated in a room with salient visual cues that remained constant throughout the study. The platform was a clear Plexiglas stand (10 cm diameter, 26 cm high) positioned 26 cm from the maze wall in the southwest quadrant. Training began on post-operative day 14 and consisted of providing a block of four daily trials (4-min inter-trial interval) for five consecutive days (14\u201318) to locate the submerged platform (2 cm below the water surface). On day 19 the platform was raised 2 cm above the water line and marked with white tape, which made it visible to the rats and served as a control procedure to determine the contributions of non-spatial factors (e.g., sensory-motor performance, motivation, and visual acuity) on cognitive performance. For each daily block of trials the rats were placed in the pool facing the wall at each of the four possible start locations (north, east, south, and west) in a randomized manner. Each trial lasted until the rat climbed onto the platform or until 120 sec had elapsed, whichever occurred first. Rats that failed to locate the escape platform within the allotted time were manually guided to it. All rats remained on the platform for 30 sec before being placed in a heated incubator between trials. The times of the 4 daily trials for each rat were averaged and used in the statistical analyses.\n\nCognitive function: probe trial (memory retention)\nOn day 19 post-injury, the rats were subjected to a probe trial to test their memory retention. Briefly, the test consisted of a single 30-sec trial where the platform was removed and the rat was allowed to swim freely throughout the pool. The percentage of time spent in the quadrant where the platform was situated on days 14\u201318 (i.e. target quadrant) was recorded using a spontaneous motor activity and tracking system. Swim speed was also recorded during this testing period. The percent time spent in the target quadrant was used in the statistical analysis.\n\nHistology: cortical lesion volume\nAfter completion of behavioral testing (i.e., day 21), the rats were anesthetized with Fatal-Plus\u00ae (0.25 ml, intraperitoneally) and then perfused transcardially with 200 mL 0.1M phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), followed by 300mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were extracted, post-fixed in 4% PFA for 1 week, dehydrated with alcohols, and embedded in paraffin. Seven-micrometer-thick coronal sections were cut at 1-mm intervals through the lesion on a rotary microtome and mounted on Superfrost\u00ae/Plus glass microscope slides. After drying at room temperature, the sections were deparaffinized in xylenes, rehydrated, and stained with cresyl violet. Cortical lesion volumes (mm\n3\n) were assessed by an observer blinded to experimental conditions using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The area of the lesion (mm\n2\n) was first calculated by outlining the inferred area of missing cortical tissue for each section (typically 5\u20137) (Nikon NIS-Elements AR 3.22.14 software Nikon Corp, Tokyo, Japan), and then by summing the lesions obtained, as previously reported (\nMonaco et al., 2013\n,\n2014\n;\nOlsen et al., 2012\n).\nAll experimental procedures were preapproved by the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All efforts were made to limit the number of rats used as well as to minimize their discomfort.\n\nData analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed on data collected by observers blinded to treatment conditions using Statview 5.0.1 software. The motor and cognitive data were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Acute neurological assessments, swim speed, visible platform performance, and cortical lesion volumes were analyzed by one-factor ANOVAs. When the overall ANOVAs revealed a significant effect, the Newman-Keuls post-hoc test was employed to determine specific group differences. The data are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (S.E.M.) and are considered significant when corresponding\np\nvalues are \u2264 0.05."

    "Methods": "Experiments were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats (400\u2013450g; Harlan Laboratories, Inc.). Animals were divided into two groups: uninjured controls (n=9) and incomplete (see \u2018Results\u2019 andFigure 1Cfor details) C2Hx (n=8). All surgical and animal care procedures were approved by the Drexel University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and adhered to AAALAC/NIH guidelines. Decerebration was used for all animals to avoid using anesthetics that significantly suppress respiratory neuronal activity, especially post-SCI. Males were chosen because they are larger than females of the same age. Larger animals have better survival rate post-decerebration and allow for easier mapping of brainstem activity.\n\nSurgical procedures\nAnimals were anesthetized with isoflurane (isoflurane (4%) vaporized in O2 (100%)) via a nose mask (Isoflurane vaporizer VIP3000, MDS Matrx, Scavenger Fluovac 50206, Stoelting). After shaving the surfaces of head, neck and ventral part of the right hind paw, each animal was placed in the supine position and an incision (2\u20132.5 cm) was made on the ventral side of the neck. The sternohyoid muscles were retracted and a tracheotomy was performed by inserting a tracheal cannula (polyethylene tube, 2 cm in length, OD=2.5 mm, ID=1.5mm) into the trachea and securing it with suture. After the tracheostomy, the animal was transferred to artificial ventilation (AVL, ~60 cycles per min, 3\u20133.3 ml tidal volume; 2% isoflurane in 100% O\n2\n, Columbus Apparatus). Two catheters (PE-50) filled with lactated ringer\u2019s solution and heparin (300 USP/ml) were inserted into the femoral vein and the artery for drug injections and monitoring of blood pressure, respectively. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37.0\u00b10.5\u00b0C via a servo-controlled heating blanket (TCAT-2DF, Physitemp). To expose the left and right phrenic nerves, the ventrolateral neck muscles were gently retracted and the nerves were dissected from surrounding tissue. Nerves were cut at the distal end (just beneath the subclavian vein) and the free end of each nerve was tied with fine thread (#6-0, 1 cm length). This thread was inserted into the muscles in the dorsolateral direction and used as a guide for retrieving phrenic nerves from the dorsal side. The internal carotid arteries were then ligated bilaterally to minimize bleeding during decerebration. Ventral neck muscles and skin were closed and sutured. Animals then were placed in prone position and the dorsal muscles surrounding the C\n1\n\u2013C\n2\ncervical segments were partially removed and retracted to enable proper placement of recording electrodes. Using the threads as a guide, phrenic nerves were gently retrived from the ventral side. Cotton balls soaked in lactated ringer\u2019s solution were placed over the nerves and muscles to protect them from drying.\nFor decerebration, animals were placed into a stereotaxic frame, and dexamethasone (1mg/kg, i.m.) was injected to prevent brain edema. Arterial blood pressure and lung inflation pressure were monitored via pressure transducers (CDXII; Argon Medical) and conventional amplifiers (Gould, Ohio). End-tidal CO\n2\n(5\u20135.5%) was monitored and adjusted by frequency of ventilation (Capnostar, CWE). After biparietal craniotomies, the superior sagittal and straight sinuses were ligated, and the brain axes was transected at the rostral border of the superior colliculus. Cerebral tissue rostral to the transection was aspirated, and small pieces of gelfoam (USP, Pharmacia) soaked with a cold thrombin solution (100 USP/ml, Biopharm) were placed into the skull cavity to stop bleeding. Animals recovered for two hours after decerebration. During this time, dextrose (5% w/v in 1 ml Locke-Ringer solution) was injected intravenously (every 15\u201330 min) to stabilize blood pressure. Subsequently, the dorsal surface of the medulla and first two spinal segments of the spinal cord were surgically exposed. The animal was centered within the stereotactic frame, and the vertebral column was raised from the T2 vertebral spinous process to align the spinal cord and medulla. A bilateral pneumothorax was performed to eliminate artifacts associated with respiratory movement. Anesthesia was withdrawn, and a paralytic agent (vecuronium bromide, 3\u20134 mg/kg/h, 0.5 mg diluted in 1 ml of Locke-Ringer solution) was continuously infused (syringe pump, NE-300, New Era Pump Scientific Inc., NY) via the vein catheter. For the duration of the recording, stable end-tidal CO\n2\n(~5%), mean arterial blood pressure (>80 mmHg) and rectal temperature (37\u00b0C) were maintained.\nOnce the animal was physiologically stable, a mineral oil bath was created on both sides of the spinal cord to immerse nerves and electrodes for recording. Phrenic neurograms were recorded before, during, and after C2Hx. To limit consequences of spinal shock, animals were temporarily (10 min) placed back under isoflurane (2.5%) anesthesia during the C2Hx. The lateral hemisections were made with a scalpel blade immediately below the C2 spinal rootlets. The animal was then allowed to recover for ~4\u20136 hours, by which time ipsilateral phrenic activity had partially recovered spontaneously and reached a plateau.\n\nElectrophysiological recording and Brainstem Mapping\nExtracellular recordings were made with glass microelectrodes (tip diameter = 2\u20133 \u03bcm; 5\u20138 m\u03a9) filled with 0.5 M sodium chloride. Single and multi-unit respiratory activity was recorded at the following coordinates: from +1 (rostral) to \u22121.8 mm (caudal) of calamus scriptorius (CS); 1\u20132.4 mm from midline; and 1\u20133.6 mm by depth with 0.2 mm step. Recorded sites were identified as I (inspiratory), E (expiratory), or non-respiratory. Respiratory phases were determined from phrenic nerve activity recorded bilaterally with bipolar silver electrodes (0.5 mm thickness, A-M Systems). Neuronal and phrenic nerve activity was amplified (x200\u2013500 for neuronal and x10000 for phrenic nerve activity) and filtered (500\u20135,000Hz for neurons and 100\u20135,000 Hz for nerves) using a differential amplifier (NeuroLog, Digitimer Ltd). All signals were digitized (10 kHz sampling rate per channel) and recorded on a PC using Chart5 software (AD Instruments). Respiratory activity in the medulla (ipsilateral to the side of injury) was mapped in naive and C2 hemisected animals 4\u20136 hours following injury.\nIn addition to the well defined areas of inspiratory and expiratory bulbospinal neurons \u2013 the rostral and caudal ventral respiratory groups (rVRG and cVRG), respectively \u2013 our mapping sites were extended to include the nucleus ambiguous (NA), lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), ventral (MdV) and dorsal (MdD) parts of the medullary reticular nucleus, gigantocellular (Gi) and parvocellular reticular nucleus (PCRt), lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi), and intermediate reticular nucleus (IRt) (\nPaxinos and Watson, 2007\n) (see\nFigure 3A, B\n).\nFigure 3. 2D maps of medullary respiratory activity pre- and post-C2Hx.\nOpen in a new tab\nSchematic diagrams of the dorsal surface of the medulla (\nA\n) and transverse sections (\nB\n; 40 micron through the medulla, stained with cresyl violet), highlighting (blue shading) the region that recordings were made. Sections from the medulla were taken from na\u00efve animals not included in this study, used here to highlight morphology and nuclei only. Double headed arrows (\nB\n) estimate 1mm penetration depth from the dorsal surface of brainstem, and 1mm lateral to midline, based on an estimated 60% tissue shrinkage with paraformaldehyde fixation. Stereotaxic coordinates (200 micron apart) used for mapping were measured from calamus scriptorius (CS; \u2018zero\u2019 point), as indicated on photographs of the dorsal surface of the medulla with grid overlay (200 micron squares). Recordings were made 1\u20132.4 mm from midline and 1 to \u22121.8 mm rostral and caudal from CS, and 1 \u2013 3.6 mm from the dorsal surface. 2D contour maps have been plotted for uninjured (Control) and C2Hx (Post-C2Hx) animals and overlay with the medulla photograph. These maps represent the proportion of sites that showed expiratory (E, red), inspiratory (I, green) and no respiratory (NRA, blue) activity. The pattern of brainstem respiratory activity is altered within hours post-C2Hx as indicated by contour maps (C) and quantified inspiratory and expiratory sites (D) rostral and caudal to CS. Graphs in D represent the proportion of I (green), E (red) and NRA (blue) within recorded sites above and below calamus scriptorius (SC). Open and filled bars represent control and injured animals, respectively.\nThe following abreviations are used: CS \u2013 calamus scriptorius; pFRG \u2013 parafacial respiratory group; RTN \u2013retrotrapezoid nucleus; Bot \u2013botzinger complex; pre-Bot \u2013 pre-botzinger complex; NA \u2013 nucleus ambiguus; rVRG- rostral ventral respiratory group; LRN \u2013 lateral reticular nucleus; LPGi- paragigantocellular nucleus; cVRG \u2013 caudal ventral respiratory group.; Ra \u2013 raphe nucleus; Gi \u2013 gigantocellular nucleus. Scale bar is 1mm in B.\n\nHistology and Immunohistochemistry\nAt the end of each experiment, animals were intracardially perfused with physiological saline and 4% paraformaldehyde (in 0.1M PBS). The spinal cords were dissected, post-fixed (4% paraformaldehyde), and cryoprotected (15% and 30% sucrose in 0.1M PBS, sequentially). Spinal cord tissue was sectioned on a cryostat (60 \u03bcm thick), slide-mounted, and stained with Toluidine blue (Sigma). The extent of C2Hx was confirmed by evaluation of serial sections using bright field microscopy.\n\nData Analysis\nPhrenic neurograms were integrated (rectified and smoothed with a 30 ms window) and onset events of phrenic activity were detected by the threshold placed above the base line using Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, England). Integrated phrenic activity was averaged over 30 s time periods (10 min before and 10 min, 2, 4 and 6 hours post-C2Hx) and the peak magnitude was analyzed using Origin Pro 9 software (OriginLab Corporation, MA). Peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of single and multi-unit activity were constructed using custom made scripts in Origin Pro 9. The final classification of recorded units was made based on phrenic nerve activity that indicates inspiratory phase of respiration. 2- and 3-D colored maps of respiratory activity distribution in the medulla were build using a custom-made Matlab script (Matlab 8, The MathWorks, Inc). Types of respiratory activity (inspiratory, expiratory, and none) were defined for every 200\u03bcm depth at each recording site. The full map consists of 120 recording sites (points), with each point representing data from at least 2\u20133 animals. Percentage of respiratory activity for each point of the map (from 1 to 3.6mm depth) was calculated and color-coded: Green color represents inspiratory activity, red represents expiratory activity, and blue represents no detectable respiratory activity. Intermediate colors (between green and red) in the 2D maps reflect the relative proportion of both inspiratory and expiratory activity within the same electrode track. 3-D maps represent an expansion of these 2-D maps, each layer in the z-axis representing recordings obtained every 200\u03bcm (between 1 and 3.6 mm deep). The data are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (STD). For statistical analysis, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normality and a paired t-test was applied for normally distributed data. Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used for non-normally distributed data."

    "Methods": "2.1. Drugs and antibodies\nAll drugs and antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise stated. Capsaicin (Cat # BML-EI125, Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA) was dissolved in ethanol as a 200 mM stock solution. For stereotaxic injection into the cerebral cortex, the capsaicin stock solution was diluted with PBS to the suitable concentration, for example, 1 mM for 1 nmol/\u03bcl injection. For in vitro application, capsaicin was diluted with PBS and immediately added to the medium. Resiniferatoxin (RTX, Cat # 1137, Tocris Bioscience, MO, USA) was dissolved in ethanol as a 50 mM stock solution and diluted with PBS just before use. Fura-2 AM ester (Cat # 50033, Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA) was dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) to produce a 1 mM stock solution and diluted as indicated below just before use.\nAntibodies against TRPV1 (Cat # sc-12498), GluN1 (Cat # sc-1467) and GluN2B (Cat # sc-1469) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (CA, USA). An antibody against the transferrin receptor was purchased from Invitrogen (Cat # 13-6800, Carlsbad, CA, USA).\n\n2.2. Animals\nMale Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were purchased from the animal center of Peking University Health Science Center (Beijing, China). The rats were housed under a 12/12 h dark/light cycle. All of the experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Welfare Committee in Peking University Health Science Center and conformed to the \u201cGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\u201d of Peking University Health Science Center. All efforts were made to minimize pain and suffering of the animals.\nGene deletion of\ntrpv1\nin C57BL/6J mice was generated by the Biocytogen Company (Beijing, China) using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology (\nFig. 6A\n). Genotypes of mice were determined using PCR amplification (94 \u00b0C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 50 s, 57 \u00b0C for 50 s, 72 \u00b0C for 50 s; 72 \u00b0C for 10 min). The following primer pairs were used: wild type (WT) (470 bp): forward, 5\u2032-TCTTTAGAGGGAGTACCAAGACCCT-3\u2032; reverse, 5\u2032-CTGAGCTGAGCTACAAGGAAAGC-3\u2032.\ntrpv1\nKO (350 bp): forward, 5\u2032-CTGCCAGGGACTACACTTGTGAAG-3\u2032; reverse, 5\u2032-CTGAGCTGAGCTACAAGGAAAGC-3\u2032.\nFig. 6.\nOpen in a new tab\nTrpv1\nknock-out abolishes the neuroprotective effect of capsaicin.

(E) Quantification of the PI-positive and PI-negative neurons as shown in (D). ns, no statistical significance. Fisher\u2019s exact test of one representative group.\n\n2.3. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)\nFocal cerebral ischemia was induced in 280\u2013320 g rats by middle cerebral artery occlusion as described by\nLonga et al. (1989)\n. In brief, under chloral hydrate anesthesia (350 mg/kg, i.p.), a surgical silica gel monofilament with a rounded tip was introduced into the right internal carotid artery through the external carotid stump and advanced approximately 20 mm past the carotid bifurcation until a slight resistance was felt. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry (Moor Instruments, Axminster, UK). After 2 h, the filament was withdrawn for reperfusion. In the sham rats, the filament was inserted only 7 mm from the carotid bifurcation.\nDuring the surgery, a homemade heating incubator was used to keep the animals warm. The rectal temperature, blood pressure and blood oxygen saturation were monitored using the multifunctional monitoring equipment for animal studies (RWD life science, Shenzhen, China).\n\n2.4. Behavioral test\nThe neurological deficit was assessed 22 h after reperfusion blinded to the observer. Behavioral score was evaluated by the following criteria: 0 = no deficit, 1 = failure to extend left forepaw, 2 = spontaneous circling, 3 = falling to one side, and 4 = coma. Then, the rat was placed on an accelerated rotating rod (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain). The latency to fall off the rod was recorded three times, and the average time was calculated.\n\n2.5. Measurement of infarct volume\nAfter reperfusion for 24 h, the rats were sacrificed under anesthesia. The brains were rapidly removed, coronally sectioned at 2 mm, and stained with 2% 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, in 0.9% saline) for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C. Infarct size was determined by digital planimetry of the slices using ImageJ software and normalized for edema. The infarct volume for each brain was calculated as follows: Percentage of infarct volume = \u03a3 (area of contralateral \u2212 normalized area of ipsilateral)/\u03a3 area of contralateral.\n\n2.6. Stereotaxic injection into the cerebral cortex\nCortical micro-injection was performed under anesthesia in a stereotaxic instrument using a microsyringe pump. A scalp incision was made, and a hole was opened in the right parietal skull, 4.6 mm lateral and 0.3 mm posterior to Bregma. A syringe was inserted into the brain to a depth of 3.0 mm below the skull surface. Capsaicin (1 \u03bcl) was injected slowly (0.25 \u03bcl/min). The syringe was kept in place for 5 min prior to removal. PBS (containing ethanol at a volume equal to the stock solution of capsaicin) was used as a vehicle control.\n\n2.7. Primary cultured cortical neurons\nCerebral cortex isolated from embryonic day 18 rat (or embryonic day 16 mouse) embryos was digested with 0.25% trypsin for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, followed by triturating with a pipette in plating medium (DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum). Then, cells were plated onto 35-mm dishes coated with poly-D-lysine. After culturing for 4 h, the medium was changed to neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen) and 0.5 mM GlutaMAX-I (Invitrogen). To inhibit the growth of glial cells, 10 \u03bcM cytosine-1-\u03b2-D-arabinofuranoside was added to the medium at day 3 until the culture was used.\n\n2.8. Glutamate-induced excitotoxicity\nCortical neurons at 7\u20139 DIV were stimulated with glutamate (50 \u03bcM) plus glycine (10 \u03bcM) in Mg\n2+\n-free extracellular solution (Mg\n2+\n-free ECS, 140 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl\n2\n, 33 mM D-glucose, and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.35, osmotic pressure 320\u2013330 mOsm) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Then, neurons were washed with ECS and incubated in normal culture medium for an additional 20 (for lactate dehydrogenase assay) or 24 h (for propidium iodide \u2013 Hoechst double staining).\n\n2.9. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay\nCell viability was assessed by measuring the release of LDH into the culture medium using the CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Briefly, 50 of medium was transferred from culture wells to 96-well plates, mixed with 50\u03bcl of reaction solution and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Stop solution was then added, and the optical density was measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).\n\n2.10. Propidium iodide \u2013 Hoechst double staining\nHoechst 33342 (5 \u03bcg/ml in PBS) was added to the culture for 10 min. Propidium iodide (PI, 15 \u03bcg/ml) was added later for an additional 10 min. The numbers of PI-positive and Hoechst-positive neurons were counted, and the percentage of PI-positive cells was calculated as the ratio of PI-positive neurons to Hoechst-positive neurons.\n\n2.11. Calcium imaging\nFura-2 AM was applied to cortical neurons at a 5 \u03bcM dilution with the extracellular solution (ECS, 140 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 33 mM D-glucose, and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.35, osmotic pressure 320\u2013330 mOsm). Neurons were washed with ECS three times and incubated in dye solution for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Then, the cells were washed twice with ECS and allowed to recover in ECS for 1 h. Changes in the intracellular Ca\n2+\nconcentration upon capsaicin or glutamate application were measured using the Live Cell Imaging System (Olympus, Japan). Fluorescence intensity at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm compared to that at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm (F\n340\n/F\n380\n) was calculated.\n\n2.12. Western blot analysis\nTissues were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EGTA, 1 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 10 mM NaF and proteinase inhibitor cocktail) and rotated at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. Cell cultures were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with the lysis buffer indicated above. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000\ng\nfor 5 min to yield the total protein extract in the supernatant. The concentration of protein was measured with a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA). Equal amounts of samples (50 \u03bcg) were denatured and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. After separation, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After washing three times with TBST, the membranes were incubated with HRP-labeled secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature, then washed again and developed with ECL solutions (Santa Cruz). The immunoreactive bands were scanned and analyzed quantitatively by densitometry with ImageJ software.\n\n2.13. Statistical analysis\nThe data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM unless otherwise stated. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5.0 software. Differences between groups were compared using Fisher\u2019s exact test, Student\u2019s\nt\n-test, and one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s post hoc test or two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc test. Statistical significance was set at\np\n< 0.05. Outliers were detected by Grubb\u2019s test and excluded before further analysis."

    "Methods": "Animals and surgery\nMale Holtzman rats (Harlan Industries, Indianapolis, IN), weighing 250\u2013350 g were used for behavioral experiments and for\nin vivo\ninflammation followed by tissue harvest and either Western blots or immunohistochemistry. Female Sprague Dawley rats (175\u2013250 g; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) provided spinal cord slices for\nin vitro\ncobalt labeling experiments. Transgenic mice, which lacked the ability to phosphorylate GluA1 at ser 845 or at ser 831 due to single alanine substitutions were generated (Johns Hopkins University, (\nH.-K. Lee et al., 2003\n)) and bred to C57BL/6 mice (Harlan Industries) to produce heterozygous mating pairs at University of California, San Diego. This mutation prevents insertion of GluA1-containing Ca\n2+\npermeable AMPAr into the plasma membrane. These mice were bred and homozygous knock-ins and wild type littermates used for behavioral (both sexes) and\nin vitro\ncobalt labeling (female) experiments. Animals were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water; all experiments were performed during the light cycle. Experiments were carried out according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of California, San Diego and the University of California, Irvine (under the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Institutes of Health publication 85\u201323, Bethesda, MD, USA).\nTo permit bolus intrathecal (i.t.) drug delivery in the\nin vivo\nrat studies, lumbar i.t. catheters (PE-5, 8.5 cm in length, Spectranetics, Colorado Springs, CO, USA) were implanted via cisternal exposure under isoflurane anesthesia (2\u20134%) and externalized as described elsewhere (\nYaksh and Rudy, 1976\n). Following catheter implantation rats were housed singly. Experiments were performed 5\u201310 days following catheter implantation.\n\nDrugs\nIn Vivo\nEtanercept (Enbrel, 30 and 100 \u03bcg, TNF antagonist, Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) and a receptor-neutralizing antibody specific for TNFR1 (125 \u03bcg, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were used for behavioral experiments. The following agents were used prior to tissue harvest and subsequent immunoblotting. Etanercept (ETA), 100 \u03bcg; LY294002 (2-morpholin-4-yl-8-phenylchromen-4-one), 50 \u03bcg, a non-selective PI3K inhibitor; H-89 (dihydrochloride hydrate, 26 \u03bcg, a PKA inhibitor), Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA); AKAP st-Ht31(2.8 \u03bcg, Promega, Madison, WI, USA, inhibitor protein for PKA anchoring onto AKAPs); and MK-801 hydrogen maleate, (MK-801, 30 \u03bcg, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist) were delivered i.t. in 10 \u03bcl vehicle followed by a 10 \u03bcl saline flush. LY294002 was obtained from Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO. All agents were dissolved in physiological saline, except for LY294002 which was dissolved in 5% DMSO, 2.5% EtOH and 92.5% saline.\nIn vitro\nWortmannin (100 \u03bcM, a non-selective PI3K antagonist; Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MI) and H89 (10 \u03bcM) were used as pretreatments prior to adding TNF (20 nM Rats; 12 nM Mice), to slices in the bath.\n\nInduction of inflammation\nRats\nTo induce a state of local inflammation 100 \u03bcl of a 2 % \u03bb carrageenan solution (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA; v/w in physiological saline) was injected subcutaneously into the ventral aspect of the left hind paw under brief isoflurane anesthesia.\nMice\nThe injection volume of carrageenan was reduced to 20 \u03bcl. After injection, animals were immediately placed in their test compartments or home cages for behavioral testing or tissue harvest, respectively. In other experiments, restrained mice were injected with 20 \u03bcl of a 2.5% formalin solution into the dorsal surface of the left hindpaw.\n\nBehavioral assessment of pain behavior\nRats\nFor measurement of tactile thresholds, rats were placed in individual compartments with wire mesh bottoms. Animals were acclimated for periods of 60 min in the testing room and 30 min in the test cages prior to assessment of baseline thresholds, for two consecutive days prior to carrageenan injection. Von Frey filaments were used to measure tactile allodynia following the Dixon up-down method (\nChaplan et al., 1994\n). Briefly, calibrated filaments (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA) with buckling forces between 0.41 and 15.2 g were applied perpendicularly to the mid-paw plantar surface (L4 dermatome) until the filament was slightly bent. Testing was started with the 2.0 g hair and the next filament was applied after a few seconds or when the animal was calm with both hind paws placed on the grid. A positive response was noted when the rat displayed a brisk withdrawal from the stimulus. The 50% probability withdrawal threshold was determined and plotted versus time. To assess thermal hypersensitivity, a modified Hargreaves type device was employed (\nDirig et al., 1997\n). Rats were placed in individual Plexiglas cubicles on top of a glass surface and after habituation, a radiant heat stimulus was applied to each paw and the latency defined as the time required for paw withdrawal. After determination of basal thresholds, ETA or neutralizing antibody (mechanical only) was injected through the catheter and the rat returned to the testing chamber. Animals were lightly anesthetized 57 min after the i.t. injection and interplantar injection of carrageenan performed 60 min post-i.t. injection. Mechanical and thermal withdrawal thresholds were measured at 1, 2, 3 and 4 h post carrageenan injection.\nMice\nMice were treated similar to the rats with the following modifications. Testing took place in a dedicated mouse room, prior to the experiment mice were acclimated to the testing room and apparatus for two hours each, on three successive days. Animals of either sex were used, but on any given day, only male or female mice were used and equipment was washed thoroughly between uses. Knock-in mice and wild-type littermates were tested in the same session. Acute mechanical and thermal withdrawal thresholds were determined prior to carrageenan and formalin testing. Thermal escape latencies were measured using a modified Hargreaves device (\nDirig et al., 1997\n), mechanical thresholds were performed as for rats, but with less stiff von Frey filaments (buckling forces from 0.2 to 2.0 gm). Each mouse was tested three times/day on each hindpaw, this was repeated for two days and all responses were averaged.\nCarrageenan\n: Following carrageenan injection, mice were placed in testing compartments and mechanical thresholds were re-determined at 1 hr intervals for 4 hours. At the end of this period, mice were placed back in the Hargreaves device and thermal escape latencies were again measured.\nFormalin\n: Flinches were counted in 1 min bins for the first hour post-injection in an automated device (\nYaksh et al., 2001\n). Responses were divided into phase 1 (min 1\u20139), phase 2 (min 10\u201360). In all behavioral experiments, the experimenter was blinded to drug treatment (rats) or genotype (mice).\n\nTissue harvest for Western blot\nOne hour after i.t. ETA/saline vehicle or 5 min after LY294002, H89, AKAP st-Ht31, or the appropriate vehicle, carrageenan was injected into the paw under light isoflurane anaesthesia. Control animals were anesthetized, but received no injection. Animals recovered in warm chambers and then returned to their home cages. One hour after carrageenan, rats were re-anesthetized, decapitated and the spinal cord extruded with cold saline. After removal of a 1 cm length of lumbar enlargement (L2-L5), the left dorsal quadrant was dissected and immediately frozen with dry ice and stored at \u221270\u00b0C. Samples were shipped on dry ice to Sweden for analysis.\n\nSubcellular fractionation\nLumbar spinal cord tissue (20\u201325 mg) was homogenized in 1 ml hypotonic buffer containing 10 \u03bcM NaHCO\n3\n, Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail I (Sigma P2850 1:1000), Phosphatase Cocktail II (Sigma P5726 1:1000) and Protease Inhibitor (Sigma P8340 1:1000) at pH 7.4, using a dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 10 min at 1200 RCF using a 50.4-Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). The pellet containing large cell debris was discarded and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 21600 RCF for 30 min. The resulting second pellet contains internal membranes and was discarded. The second supernatant was collected and centrifuged for 2h at 150000 RCF creating a third pellet containing external membranes. Hypotonic buffer (2 ml, pH 7.4) was added to wash this pellet. After an additional centrifugation at 150000 RCF for 2 h the supernatant was discarded and the fourth pellet enriched in external membranes was re-suspended in 50\n\u03bc\nl extraction buffer and the samples stored in \u221270\u00b0C until analysis. Method adapted from (\nLehel et al., 1995\n).\n\nWestern blots\nSamples containing the external membrane were denatured at 65\u00b0C for 30 min and proteins separated by gel electrophoresis (NuPAGE 3\u20138% Tris Acetate gels, Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Non-specific binding was blocked using Odyssey blocking buffer (Licor, Lincoln, NE, USA) for 1 h at room temperature and membranes were then incubated with primary antibody GluA1, GluA2, or GluA4 (1:1000, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and\n\u03b2\n-actin (1:10 000, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) in blocking buffer with Tween-20 (0.1%) overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing, membranes were incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit 800CW and goat anti-mouse 680 (1:10 000 Licor) dissolved in TBS with 0.1% Tween and conjugated to IRDye-680 or IRDye-800CW for 1 h, washed and scanned using Odyssey Imager (Odyssey CLx, Licor). Image Studio Analysis software (Licor) was used for quantification of band intensity and signals for the GluAs were normalized to \u03b2-actin. Tissue from control animals (i.t. vehicle and no carrageenan) was run on every gel.\n\nCo-localization of GluA subunits and synaptophysin on spinal nociceptive projection neurons\nAnimals\nEight rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal ketamine (50 mg/kg)/xylazine (5mg/kg)/acepromazine (1mg/kg) cocktail, supplemented as necessary. Animals were positioned in a stereotaxic device and a Hamilton syringe with a 30 gauge needle, used to pressure inject each rat bilaterally with 1ul of 10% Fluororuby (Millipore #AG335). Injections were aimed at the lateral parabrachial area, using the co-ordinates of AP: \u22129.0 mm, ML: \u00b1 2.3 mm, D: \u22127.2 mm relative to Bregma. The injection needle was angled 16\u00b0 posteriorally in order to enter the brain without piercing the sagittal sinus. The needle was left in place for 10 min after each injection, following skin suturing, infiltration of the incision with lidocaine and subcutaneous injection of Carprofen in 5 ml lactated Ringers, animals were returned to their home cages for 14 days. On the day of the experiment, all animals were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and four were injected bilaterally into the ventral surface of the hindpaws with\n\u03bb\n-carrageenan (100\n\u03bc\nl, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan), Animals were allowed to wake up and were re-anesthetized with 5% isoflurane for 8 min starting 1h after paw injection at which time they were transcardially perfused with cold heparinized 0.9% saline followed by chilled 4% paraformaldahyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Spinal cords were removed and post-fixed for 6 h and transferred to sucrose for cryoprotection. Horizontal sections (20\n\u03bc\nm) of the spinal cord, to allow the best view of lamina I dendritic trees, were cut using a cryostat and placed directly on slides. Serial sections were collected until Fluororuby staining was no longer observed with epi-flourescent illumination. Brains were removed, brainstems were blocked and post-fixed overnight, then transferred to 30% sucrose and 30\n\u03bc\nm sections cut to confirm injection sites.\nImmunohistochemistry\nTissue from control and carrageenan animals was processed in parallel and neither the histologist nor those doing the analysis of the stained tissue were aware of treatment. Sections from the lumbar enlargement with Fluororuby staining were initially incubated for one hour with 10% normal goat serum (NGS, Vector Laboratories) at room temperature (RT) followed by an overnight incubation with rabbit anti-synaptophysin (Abcam #14692) (1:2000; diluted in Signal Stain, Cell Signaling #8112L) at RT. A biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary (Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA.) was applied at 1:500 for one hour at room temperature in a 1% BSA-PBS dilution buffer. Following PBS rinses, Avidin Biotin Complex-Horse Radish Peroxidase (ABC-HRP, Vector Laboratories) was prepared per manufacturers instructions and slides were incubated for another hour followed by a two min incubation in Cy5 Tyramide Signal Amplification reagent (TSA, Perkin Elmer). Slides were then rinsed in PBS and placed in fresh PBS for 30 minutes in a 37\u00b0C oven and exposed to freshly prepared pepsin solution (Promega) at 1 mg/ml in 0.2 M HCl for two min. This limited digestion process served to \u2018open up\u2019 the synapses and expose the synaptic glutamate receptors. This procedure is apparently necessary in the dorsal horn (\nNagy et al., 2004\n), although surprisingly it is not necessary for motor neurons (\nFerguson et al., 2008\n).\nFollowing three PBS rinses and a one hour incubation in 10% NGS, slides were incubated in Signal Stain dilution buffer for three days at 4\u00b0C with either rabbit monoclonal anti-GluA1 (1:300, Millipore #04-855), rabbit polyclonal anti-GluA2 (1:300, Chemicon #AB1768), or rabbit polyclonal anti-GluA4 (1:200, Millipore #1508). Confocal Microscopy: Lamina 1 Fluroruby-labeled projection neurons were scanned with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser microscope utilizing the Argon laser for 488nm GluA immunoreactivity, a 543 HeNe laser for Fluororuby and an HeNe laser to detect synaptophysin. Scans, with a 63\u00d7 oil immersion lens, were carried out sequentially to avoid fluorescent bleedthrough. Z stacks were system optimized with a 0.13\n\u03bc\nm step size. Digital files were sent to UCSF for analysis.\nConfocal image processing and automated quantification of synaptic AMPAR subunits: Confocal stacks were first batch processed by channel and deblurred using 3D blind iterative deconvolution (AutoQuant, Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD). To ensure that synaptophysin and GluA expression were quantified only around cells that projected to the parabrachial area, a masking technique was used to isolate Fluororuby-labeled cells. Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used to detect Fluororuby signal above a predetermined threshold, from which a binary image was created. A mask was then created using an integrated morphometry application, followed by a 15 pixel dilation of this mask to ensure that synaptophysin surrounding the cell was included. This mask was then laid over the synaptophysin/GluA image to isolate only that region that was determined to be positive for Fluororuby. Total GluA (green) and synaptophysin (red) were quantified, and yellow pixels produced by the colocalization of the synaptophysin (presynaptic) and GluA (postsynaptic) signified synaptic GluA. The number of red, green, and yellow pixels above a predetermined threshold was then automatically quantified by the Metamorph software. Values for each color were normalized by the total Fluorouby-masked area within each plane. This process was carried out for each optical plane of each confocal image. In total, 239 confocal stacks were analyzed, with an average 40 optical planes per stack.\n\nTNF-induced Co\n2+\nlabeling\nAnimals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) and decapitated. A laminectomy was then performed and lumbosacral spinal cord dissected out and immediately immersed in ice-cold aerated \u201cstabilization buffer\u201d (SB; containing in mM: 139 sucrose, 32.5 NaCL, 2.5 KCl, 10 MgSO\n4\n, 12 Glucose, 24 NaHCO\n3\n, 1 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, and 0.5 CaCl\n2\n) for 5 min. The dura was removed and the spinal cord embedded on end in 2.5% agar, and transverse slices (500 \u03bcm) cut on a vibratome (Leica VT 1200, Nusslock, Germany). These thick slices were returned to the aerated SB for 25 min (at 4\u00b0C) and then brought up to room temperature for another 20 min before transfer to \u201cuptake buffer\u201d (UB; containing, in mM: 139 Sucrose, 57.5 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl\n2\n, 1 CaCl\n2\n, 10 HEPES, 12 Glucose). Slices from rat spinal cord were divided into four groups, pre-incubation with H89, wortmannin or vehicle for 10 min, followed by addition of TNF for 10 more min. The fourth group was pre-incubated with vehicle followed by addition of saline instead of TNF (control). Slices were taken from each animal for the vehicle/saline, vehicle/TNF and at least one of the antagonists given as a pretreatment before TNF and processed simultaneously to reduce experimental variability. Pretreatment/treatment paradigms were followed by the addition of a small volume of concentrated Co\n2+\nand kainate to a final bath concentration of 2.5 mM Co\n2+\n, 100 \u03bcM kainate for a final 20 min. The pretreatment agents and TNF were not removed during the kainate stimulation period. Cobalt loading was terminated by a UB wash containing 2 mM Ca-EDTA to remove extracellular Co\n2+\nfollowed by treatment with (NH\n4\n)\n2\nS (0.067%, 5 min) to precipitate intracellular Co\n2+\nand tissue was then fixed overnight in 4% PFA. Slices were cryoprotected (30% sucrose for 24 hours), OCT embedded and frozen sections cut at 30 \u03bcm. Thin sections were then processed in the dark for 60 min with AgNO\n3\nenhancement of the Co\n2+\nstain, as described (\nYin et al., 1999\n) before re-washing to terminate the process.\nNonspecific Co\n2+\nuptake occurs in the top- and bottom-most thin sections in each slice due to tissue damage resulting from vibratome sectioning, staining in the center of each slice is only faintly stained due to difficulty in reagent penetration. Thus, analyzed sections were confined to those 50\u2013150 \u03bcm from each end of the thick slice (stack). Sections from the same stack were mounted together and analyzed. Images were acquired by light microscopy (Olympus model BX51, Olympus Japan) using a digital camera (20\u00d7). For quantification, photographs were captured using identical exposure parameters and imported into an image analysis program (ImagePro Plus software, MediaCybernetics, Silver Springs, MD) for background subtraction and analysis. Cells with black or dark brown somata of at least twice background intensity were classified as Co\n2+\npositive. Neurons with markedly atrophic or irregular somata were not counted. Care was taken to exclude areas of artifact (obvious non-cellular punctate labeling) as well as capillaries where Co\n2+\noccasionally accumulated. Cobalt positive neurons were counted and divided into those in superficial (laminae I\u2013III) and deep (laminae IV\u2013V) dorsal horn. Frequency of Co\n2+\nlabeled neurons within each stack (3\u201312 sections/stack) was averaged. Stacks from the same animal, subjected to the same treatment were also averaged to obtain an animal mean.\nAnalysis and counting was performed blinded by investigators with no knowledge of treatment group. Mouse tissue was treated equivalently. Tissue was taken from GluA1 ser 831 and ser 845 knock in mice and their respective wild type littermates. Tissue from each animal was subjected to control and TNF conditions.\n\nStatistics\nGraph Pad Prism 4.0 (GPP 4.0, GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for statistical analyses and graphs. One-way ANOVAs with post-hoc Bonferroni corrected multiple comparison tests were used to compare behavioral responses and Co\n2+\npositive cell counts among experimental groups. Unpaired t-tests were used to analyze differences between Western blot results. Percent area for GluA, synaptophysin, and colocalization was averaged across planes for each confocal stack, and a linear mixed model was used to test for significant differences between treatment conditions, with confocal stacks for each animal treated as a repeated, random measure. All data is depicted as means \u00b1 SEM in graphs. P\u2264 0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll the experiments were performed in compliance with the animal care guidelines issued by the National Institutes of Health and by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (IACUC) at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. All mice were bred and housed in the animal facility with a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle with no more than five mice per cage, food (2916 Global irradiated diet, Teklad Labs), and water ad libitum. To generate the mice used in this study, we crossed homozygous Nestin-CreER\nT2\n; NeuroD1\nloxP/+\nmice with homozygous R26R-YFP; NeuroD1\nloxP/+\nmice(\nGoebbels S.\net al.\n2005\n;\nLagace D.C.\net al.\n2007\n) to generate male and female Nestin-CreER/R26R-YFP; NeuroD1\n+/+\n(NeuroD1 WT) and Nestin-CreER\nT2\n/R26R-YFP; NeuroD1\nloxP/loxP\n(NeuroD1 cKO) mice. Mice were genotyped by PCR using genomic DNA and primers for NeuroD1 (5\u2032 GTT TTT GTG AGT TGG GAG TG 3\u2032, 5\u2032 TGA CAG AGC CCA GAT GTA 3\u2032), NestinCreER\nT2\n(5\u2032 GGT CGA TGC AAC GAG TGA TGA GG 3\u2032, 5\u2032 GCT AAG TGC CTT CTC TAC ACC TGC G 3\u2032), and R26R-YFP (5\u2032 AAA GTC GCT CTG AGT TGT TAT 3\u2032, 5\u2032 GCG AAG AGT TTG TCC TCA ACC 3\u2032, 5\u2032 GGA GCG GGA GAA ATG GAT ATG 3\u2032). NeuroD1 WT and cKO mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6NHsd mice obtained from Envigo Laboratories (Cat no: 4403F/M) for at least 4\u20136 generations prior to beginning studies. Male and female NeuroD1 WT and cKO mice at approximately 5.5 weeks of age were administered tamoxifen (TAM) intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 150 mg/kg per day for 5 days prior to SE. TAM was dissolved in 10% EtOH/90% sunflower oil. In\nFig. 1\nexperiments, we used female C57BL/6NHsd (Cat no: 4403F) purchased from Envigo. SNP analysis testing performed for NeuroD1 WT and cKO and C57BL/6NHsd mice showed an average 99.33% genetic similarity between these two lines.\nFigure 1. Acute seizures increase the number of NeuroD1-positive cells in adult dentate gyrus.\nOpen in a new tab\nA) Experimental Timeline. Female C57BL/6NHsd Envigo animals were subjected to pilocarpine induced status epilepticus (SE) and then euthanized 3 weeks post pilocarpine. B) Animals were euthanized 3 weeks post pilocarpine treatment and brains were stained with NeuroD1 to determine the total cell number in the granule cell layer (GCL) and hilus. (n=6 sham, n=6 pilo) C) There was a significant increase in the NeuroD1+ cells in both the GCL (p=0.0013) and hilus (p=0.0016) in pilocarpine treated animals compared to sham treated animals. D,E) The majority of pilocarpine induced NeuroD1+ cells co-localized with the immature neuronal marker Dcx. (n=8 sham, n=8 pilo). Scale bar in B: 100 um, inset bar in B: 25um, both valid for D.\n\nChemoconvulsant model of TLE\nMale and female NeuroD1 WT and cKO mice at approximately 6 weeks of age were administered scopolamine methyl nitrate (i.p.; 2 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich S2250) and terbutaline hemisulfate salt (i.p.; 2 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich T2528) to block the peripheral effects of pilocarpine and dilate the respiratory tract, respectively. Thirty minutes later, pilocarpine hydrochloride (i.p.; Sigma-Aldrich P6503) at 220 mg/kg for males and 260 mg/kg for females was injected, and mice were placed in an incubator maintained at 31\u00b0C (ThermoCare). Acute seizures were behaviorally monitored using a modified Racine\u2019s scale (\nRacine R.J. 1972\n) (stage 1, mouth and facial movement; stage 2, head nodding; stage 3, forelimb clonus; stage 4, rearing with forelimb clonus; stage 5, rearing and falling with forelimb clonus). Once SE began (defined by continuous tonic-clonic convulsive seizures), mice were placed at room temperature for 3 h and returned to the incubator after seizure activity was reduced using diazepam (10 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich D0899). Only mice showing SE for a total of 3 hours were included in EEG recording studies. After SE, mice were administered 5% dextrose solution (i.p.; 1 ml) and saline (i.p.; 1 ml) to facilitate their recovery. Mice were weighed each day during the recovery period and if found to have lost \u2265 2 g from the previous recorded weight were given a single i.p. dose of 1ml 5% dextrose, and moistened chow. At 3 days after SE, mice were returned to their home cage. Male and female NeuroD1 WT and cKO mice included in the sham seizure group were given (TAM) intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 150 mg/kg per day for 5 days prior to sham treatment. All sham animals were administered scopolamine methyl nitrate (i.p.; 2 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich S2250) and terbutaline hemisulfate salt (i.p.; 2 mg/kg;Sigma-Aldrich T2528) 30 minutes prior to an i.p. vehicle (saline) injection. In some cases, male and female NeuroD1 WT and cKO mice were given access to Metoclopramide (Henry Schein Animal Health, Cat no. 055411) treated water (1mg/kg) for 5 days prior to SE to help alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms (constipation) associated with use of pilocarpine in this mouse line. EnvigoC57BL/6NHsd female mice were treated the same as above, but did not receive TAM injections, and received a dose of 185 mg/kg pilocarpine to induce SE. For reference we have made available data on the total number of male and female animals used in our experiments, the total number of each that entered SE and survived for a total of 3 hours, and the total number of that made it to EEG recording are represented in\nTable 1\n.\nTable 1. Animal numbers included in study.\nThis table details the total number of male and female animals used in our SRS recording experiments and is further broken down into the total number of each sex that entered SE and survived for a total of 3 hours, as well as the total number that survived to the SRS recording phase of the study. The * in the table indicates a number where there were originally 12 animals, but after re-genotyping 1 animal was excluded from the recording phase due to being heterozygous for the NeuroD1 allele.\nReceived Pilo\nEntered SE and survived\nIncluded in data\nMales\n87\n42\n12*\nFemales\n50\n21\n10\nOpen in a new tab\n\nVideo/EEG monitoring\nVideo/EEG recording was performed between 5\u20137 weeks after pilocarpine injection. One week before EEG recording, mice were stereotaxically implanted with cortical surface electrodes connected to wireless EEG transmitters placed subcutaneously under the skin on the back (TA11ETAF10, Data Sciences International, St. Paul, MN). Mice were anesthetized using 2\u20133% isoflurane gas mixed in a 1L/min mixture of 70% nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen. Two cortical electrodes were placed at the coordinates from Bregma AP: +0.1 ML: +0.1 (Reference; R) and AP:\u22120.2 ML: +0.22 (Left parietal cortex; LPC). Mice received the analgesic buprenorphine (subcutaneously; 0.05 mg/kg) as necessary following surgery. Animals underwent continuous monitoring by video/EEG for a total of two weeks. Video-EEG data was reviewed and quantified by a user blinded to the experimental groups using NeuroScore Software (Version 3.0.7703-0, Data Sciences International). Behavioral seizures were defined by repetitive epileptiform spiking activity (\u22653Hz) that persisted for (\u226510s) and was confirmed using video recordings. Seizure activity was marked at the beginning and end of each event to account for seizure duration and the number of seizures for each mouse was recorded. After EEG recording was completed, mice were sacrificed and brains harvested for immunohistochemistry.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were anesthetized using 250mg/kg Avertin injected i.p. and perfused transcardially with cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M PBS. Brains were removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight, then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PBS. Brains were bisected and half-brains were coronally sectioned 30 um thick on a freezing microtome (Leica, SM 2000R). Immunohistochemistry was performed with either tissue mounted on charged slides or free-floating tissue sections. Slides underwent antigen retrieval using 0.01 M citric acid, pH 6.0 at 100 \u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 12 min in 1x TBS at room temperature. Staining with free-floating tissue sections was the same except for the antigen retrieval step that was omitted. For Tyramide Plus signal amplification, we removed endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating sections with 0.3% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 30 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 3% normal donkey serum and 0.3% Triton-X-100 or 3% normal donkey serum and 1% Triton X-100 in 1x TBS for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: goat anti-NeuroD1 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-1084), chicken anti-GFP (1:1,000 for free floating sections, 1:8,000 for Tyramide Plus Amplification; Aves Lab GFP-1020), goat anti-Dcx (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-8066), guinea pig anti-Dcx (1:1,000, Millipore AB2253), and mouse anti-NeuN (1:1,000, Millipore MAB377). For double labeling, primary antibodies were simultaneously incubated and further processed for each antibody. Antibodies combined for double immunostains were as follows: GFP/NeuroD1; GFP/Dcx; GFP/Prox1; and NeuroD1/Dcx. For GFP, Dcx, Prox1, and NeuN, a fluorescent-tagged secondary antibody was used (1:100\u20131:500, Donkey anti-Cy2/Cy3/Cy5 Jackson ImmunoResearch). For GFP and NeuroD1 (slide mounted), primary antibody incubation was followed with an appropriate biotin-tagged secondary antibody (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by ABC (Vector Laboratories PK-6100) for 1 h, and Tyramide-Plus signal amplification (1:50, PerkinElmer NEL701001KT) for 1\u20133 min. For Dcx, after biotin-tagged secondary antibody followed by ABC labeling was completed, sections were visualized with a metal-enhanced DAB substrate kit (Thermo Scientific 34065). Sections visualized with DAB were mounted and dehydrated (70, 80, 90, 95, and 100% EtOH - 3 min each; and 50% EtOH/xylene, and 100% xylene- 3 min each) before coverslipping. Fluorescence stained sections were mounted in a 2.5% PVA-DABCO Media (PVA Sigma-Aldrich D2522, DABCO: Sigma-Aldrich D2522).\n\nMicroscopic analysis and quantification\nQuantification of cell number was performed by a user blinded to the experimental groups. In fluorescence labeled sections of the hippocampus, quantification was performed using either an upright microscope (BX60; Olympus), or a confocal microscope (LSM700/LSM710; Carl Zeiss Microscopy). In DAB labeled sections of the hippocampus, quantification was performed using a MicroBrightfield scope (BX51; Olympus) equipped with StereoInvestigator software (Version 11.03). Subgranular and hilar zones were defined as the area within and beyond the diameter of one granule cell from the margin of granule cell layer, respectively. Immunoreactive cells were quantified in every twelfth 30-\u03bcm coronal section throughout the dentate gyrus. For double- or triple-stained sections, confocal images in Z planes were scanned for quantification. The numbers counted from each section were added and multiplied by 24 to estimate the total number of cells in one mouse brain.\n\nStatistics\nAll of the data are expressed at mean \u00b1 S.E.M. Experimental groups were assigned by simple randomization. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine the sample size in each group, however the sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications (\nParent J.M.\net al.\n1997\n;\nPun R.\net al.\n2012\n;\nCho K.\net al.\n2015\n). Data that passed selection criteria were collected blind. Prism software was used to perform statistical analysis (Version 6.0, Graphpad Software, Inc.) Statistical differences were analyzed using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test for the data with equal variances, or Student\u2019s t-test with Satterwaite\u2019s correction for the data with unequal variance.\nFigure 4C\nwas analyzed using ANOVA analysis. Values of P<0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nFigure 4. NeuroD1 is not required for Prox1-positive ectopic granule neurons.\nOpen in a new tab\nA, D) Experimental Timeline. Male and female NeuroD1 WT or cKO animals were given 5 days of tamoxifen injections and then subjected to sham-or pilocarpine treatment. Mice were euthanized 7 weeks post-sham or post-pilocarpine. B, E) Representative images from sham-treated or pilocarpine-treated WT and cKO animals stained with Dcx. C) Deletion of NeuroD1 significantly reduced the number of Dcx+ cells in the GCL (p=0.0226) in sham-treated mice (n=6 WT, n=8 cKO) but not in pilocarpine-treated mice (n=11 WT, n=10 cKO). F: Deletion of NeuroD1 significantly reduced the total number of Dcx+ cells ectopically localized in the hilus (p=0.0362) (n=11 WT, n=10 cKO). G: Deletion of NeuroD1 does not affect the total number of Prox1+ cells in the hilus in pilocarpine-treated mice (n=9 WT, n=10 cKO). Scale bar in B: 100um, inset bar in B: 25um, also valid for E. NS=Not significant. For C; Wildtype (sham) vs. Wildtype (pilo) p=0.2010, and wildtype (pilo) vs. cKO (pilo) p=0.3578."

    "Methods": "Mice\nUbe3a\nmKO\nmice (JAXS, B6.129S7-\nUbe3a\ntm2Alb\n/J) were backcrossed to FVB for 10 generations. Females positive for the deletion (unaffected mothers) inherited from their male parent were bred to wild-type males to produce mice designated p-Ube3a-mKO and their wild-type littermates. Females positive for the deletion (AS affected mothers) inherited from their female parent were bred to wild-type males to produce mice designated m-Ube3a-mKO and their wild-type littermate mice. Mice were housed in same-sex groups of \u2264 5 under standard laboratory conditions. Lights were on from 7 am to 7 pm and ad libitum food and water were available. Three chamber social approach, rotorod, and novel object tests were performed between 9 am and 5 pm. Paired ultrasonic vocalizations were recorded between 9 am and 12 pm. The testing arenas were cleaned with Clidox-S spray in between each mouse. Mice were given 1 hour of acclimation to the testing environment prior to behavioral measurements. Prior to testing, mice were preconditioned to the experimenter by handling. All of the following tests were performed on breeding age female (6\u201313 weeks old) and male (8\u201313 weeks old) mice.\n\nTesting Order\nUnique cohorts of mice were measured in multiple behavioral assays in the following orders. Female p-Ube3a-mKO mice: 1. three chamber social approach, 2. female-female paired ultrasonic vocalizations, 3. novel object preference, and 4. rotorod. Female m-Ube3a-mKO mice: 1. three chamber social approach, 2. female-female paired ultrasonic vocalizations, and 3. rotorod. Male p-Ube3a-mKO mice: 1. three chamber social approach, and 2. male-female ultrasonic vocalizations. The effects of social experience on three chamber social approach and paired ultrasonic vocalizations were measured in two unique cohorts of female m-Ube3a-mKO and wild-type littermate mice. For female p-Ube3a-mKO mice, the same cohorts were used to assess the effects of social experience on three chamber social approach and then, after a one week group housed period, the effects of social experience on paired ultrasonic vocalizations were measured.\n\nSocial Approach Test\nMice were placed in a clear acrylic box (50 \u00d7 100 cm) containing dividers with small (10 \u00d7 10 cm) doors to create a three-chambered enclosure. An overhead camera recorded activity and Ethovision software (Noldus) tracked mouse movement. Two small metal enclosures (inverted pencil holders, Office Depot) were placed in opposite corners of the arena and an Erlenmeyer flask filled with water was placed upon them to prevent mice from climbing to the top of the chamber. Test mice (wild type, p-Ube3a-mKO, or m-Ube3a-mKO) na\u00efve to the arena were allowed to explore for five minutes and then removed to a holding cage. A novel sex- and age-matched non-littermate wild-type mouse was placed in one of the two small enclosures. The location of the novel mouse was alternated to control for any innate side preference. These probe mice were habituated to the small enclosures in 1 hour sessions two a day for two days prior to testing. The test mouse was then returned to the cage and allowed to free-roam for two consecutive five minute trials while movements and the time spent in each third of the enclosure were automatically scored by Ethovision and the time sniffing the chambers was scored by a trained observer blind to genotype. The arena was evenly lit by an overhead fluorescent light source.\n\nRotorod\nMotor function of p-Ube3a-mKO, m-Ube3a-mKO, and control wild-type littermate mice were tested using the rotarod (Ugo Basile A-Rod for mice). Each experiment was performed during the light phase inside a fume hood with an overhead fluorescent light. Mice were given two trials per day with a 60 min inter trial interval for 4 consecutive days. On each day we calculated the average time spent on the rotarod or the time until the mouse made three consecutive rotations on the rotarod. The duration of the trial was 5 minutes and the rod accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm. 10 mice per genotype were measured.\n\nSocial vocalizations\nFemale-Female Social Vocalization Test: Pairs of age- and genotype-matched, non-littermate, female mice were studied. Male-Female Social Vocalization Test: A wild-type or p-Ube3a-mKO male and an unfamiliar, sexually mature, wild-type female were studied. Mice were placed simultaneously (to avoid resident-intruder aggression) into a small novel clean 25.4 cm circular plastic chamber at room temperature inside an unlit sound isolation box for 5 minutes. Vocalizations were recorded with a condenser ultrasound microphone (Avisoft-Bioacoustics CM16/CMPA), an UltraSoundGate (Avisoft Bioacoustics 116Hb) and the Avisoft Recorder USGH software (Avisoft Bioacoustics). Avisoft-SASLab Pro software was used to quantify the number of vocalizations and the time spent vocalizing. The USV detection settings were: max frequency changes (3 pixels), frequency range limit (35 \u2013 250 kHz), min whistle duration (10 ms), hold time (20 ms), min total duration (10 ms). Sampling rate is 250,000 Hz (at 976 Hz FFT size is 256 with 0% overlap). Simultaneous video recordings were made using a webcam mounted in the lid of the container. Physical interaction (direct contact) times were measured by a trained observer blinded to genotype.\n\nNovel Object\nMice were placed in a large (50 \u00d7 50cm) open field lit from above by a fluorescent ceiling light and allowed to explore for 10 minutes. An overhead camera recorded activity and Ethovision (Noldus) was used to track mouse movement. Mobility in the open field was scored by the software. After 10 minutes a novel object (colored bottle cap) was placed into the open field near one corner and the time the mouse spend interacting with the object was scored by an observer blind to genotype for five minutes.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nMultiple groups were compared by 2-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni post-test. Three chamber data was analyzed by a repeated measure 2-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni post-test. Ultrasonic vocalization and physical interaction data were analyzed using a two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t-test. Single groups were compared by 1-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni post-test."

    "Methods": "The first vectors used to generate iPSCs were gamma retroviruses, specifically murine leukemia retroviruses, chosen for their favorable long-term transgene expression (Fig. 3A) [18,19]. Retroviral vectors consist of an RNA genome which is converted to DNA by virally-encoded reverse transcriptase once inside the target cell. The viral DNA is then integrated into the recipient genome during cell division, providing a persistent template for viral replication and gene expression. Replication-defective retroviruses engineered with insertion of transgenes in the place of viral protein-coding genes allow for delivery and integration of genes encoding reprogramming transcription factors. However, retroviruses are limited by their inability to transduce non-dividing and slow-growing cells, as well as the potential increased cancer risk associated with the integration of viral vectors near proto-oncogenes [33]."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThe mouse line expressing the human\nSCN1A\nR1648H GEFS+ mutation (\nRH\nline) was generated as we previously described (\nMartin et al. 2010\n) and is maintained on the C57BL/6J background. Wild-type (WT) littermates were used as controls for all experiments to minimize variation due to differences in genetic background and rearing conditions. Mice were housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. All experiments were conducted at the N4 backcross generation. All experiments involving mice were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Emory University and the University of California, Irvine.\n\nAcute hyperthermia seizure induction\nSusceptibility to hyperthermia-induced seizures (a model of febrile seizure susceptibility) was determined as previously described (\nDutton et al. 2013\n). Male and female mice were previously found to respond similarly to hyperthermia, therefore data from both sexes were combined. Heterozygous (\nRH/+\n), homozygous (\nRH/RH\n), and WT littermates were evaluated at 3 ages: P14-15 (WT - Males: 4, Females: 4;\nRH/+\n- Males: 4, Females: 4;\nRH/RH\n- Males: 2, Females: 3), P22-24 (WT - Males: 4, Females: 4;\nRH/+\n- Males: 4, Females: 4;\nRH/RH\n- Males: 3, Females: 3), and P32-33 (WT - Males: 5, Females: 4;\nRH/+\n- Males: 4, Females: 5). Each mouse was tested only once. Briefly, each mouse was placed in a Plexiglas tube and fitted with a rectal temperature probe connected to a heating lamp via a temperature controller (TCAT 2DF, Physitemp). The mouse was held at 37.5\u00b0C for 30 min to acclimatize to the chamber and to obtain baseline electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. Body temperature was then elevated by 0.5\u00b0C every 2 minutes until a seizure occurred or a maximum temperature of 42.5\u00b0C was reached. Seizure behaviors were scored using a modified Racine scale: 1, staring; 2, head nodding; 3, unilateral forelimb clonus; 4, bilateral forelimb clonus; 5, rearing and falling; 6, clonic seizure involving loss of postural control with rapid movement in all 4 limbs. Seizure induction was coupled with real-time video-EEG recordings for each mouse.\n\nModels of complex early-life FS events\nTwo different paradigms were developed to investigate the long-term effects of complex early-life FSs.\nRH/+\nmice and WT littermates (P22-23) were used for both paradigms.\n(1) Prolonged febrile event (PFE)\nThe PFE paradigm was used to model an early-life prolonged febrile seizure event. Each mouse was placed in a Plexiglas cylinder and fitted with a rectal temperature probe connected to a heating lamp via a temperature controller. Mouse core body temperature was held at 37.5\u00b0C for 10 minutes, allowing the mouse to acclimatize to the chamber. Core body temperature was elevated by 0.5\u00b0C every 2 minutes until 41.5\u00b0C was reached, and this core body temperature was then maintained for 30 minutes. The core body temperature at the occurrence of each seizure as well as the total number of seizures and the severity of each seizure (as measured on the modified Racine scale) were noted for each mouse. The mouse was then transferred to its home cage, and no further procedures were performed for 2 months. Mutants and WT littermates that were handled similarly but not exposed to external heat via the heat lamp were used as controls. In a separate cohort of mice (n = 4\u20135 per genotype), febrile seizure induction was coupled with real-time video/EEG recordings to confirm behavioral seizures.\n(2) Acute/prolonged febrile event (A/PFE)\nThe A/PFE paradigm was used to model recurrent FSs in which an acute febrile seizure is subsequently followed by a prolonged febrile seizure event. On the first day, the mouse was held at 37.5\u00b0C for 10 minutes to acclimatize to the chamber. Body temperature was then elevated by 0.5\u00b0C every 2 minutes until a seizure occurred or a maximum temperature of 42.5\u00b0C was reached. The mouse was then returned to its home cage. On the following day (18\u201324 hours later), the mouse was held at 37.5\u00b0C for 10 minutes, and then its core body temperature was elevated by 0.5\u00b0C every 2 minutes until 41.5\u00b0C was reached. Core body temperature was maintained at 41.5\u00b0C for 30 minutes and the observed seizures were scored as described above. The mouse was then returned to its home cage and no further procedures were performed for 2 months. WT and\nRH/+\nmice that were handled similarly but not exposed to the external heat served as controls.\n\nFlurothyl seizure induction\nThresholds to flurothyl-induced seizures were determined as we previously described (\nMartin et al. 2010\n). Two months after the PFE or A/PFE, mice (P82) were exposed to flurothyl (2,2,2-trifluroethylether, Sigma) at a rate of 20 \u00b5l/min. Latencies to the first myoclonic jerk (MJ), the first generalized tonic clonic seizure (GTCS), and the generalized tonic clonic seizure with hindlimb extension (HE) were determined. A total of 16 WT controls (males: 8, females: 8), 15\nRH/+\ncontrols (males: 9, females: 6), 16 PFE WT (males: 8, females: 8), and 14 PFE\nRH/+\n(males: 7, females: 7) were examined for the PFE paradigm. For the A/PFE paradigm, a total of 15 WT controls (males: 9, females: 6), 15\nRH/+\ncontrols (males: 9, females: 6), 16 A/PFE WT (males: 8, females: 8), and 14 A/PFE\nRH/+\n(males: 7, females: 7) were examined.\n\nEEG surgery and real-time video/EEG acquisition during FS induction\nHeterozygous\nRH/+\nmice and WT littermates (P14-15, P22-24, and P32-33; n = 8-9 per genotype, 3-4 males/group; 4-5 females/group) were anesthetized with isoflurane and surgically implanted with 2 pairs of sterile stainless steel screw electrodes (0.10 inch in diameter; Pinnacle Technology, Inc.). The first pair of electrodes was placed posterior to Bregma in the right hemisphere (EEG\n1\nand EEG\n2\n), and the second pair of electrodes was placed at the corresponding positions in the left hemisphere (EEG\n3\nand EEG\n4\n). Following electrode placement, fine wires were wrapped tightly around each screw and dental acrylic was applied. Following 2 hours of recovery from surgery, each mouse was subjected to febrile seizure induction and real-time video and EEG signals were collected, processed, and digitized at a sampling rate of 200 Hz by the Stellate Harmonie amplifier and software (Natus Medical, Inc., CA). Additional details on the EEG acquisition and analysis are provided as\nSupplementary Data\n. No statistical significant differences were observed between sexes; therefore, male and female data were combined.\n\nImmunohistochemistry for c-Fos reactivity\nC-Fos immunoreactivity was evaluated 2 hours after the acute hyperthermia- induced seizure in male\nRH/+\nmutants and in WT littermates that were similarly handled (n = 8 per genotype). Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused. Brains were post-fixed in paraformaldehyde (4%), cryopreserved in 30% sucrose, and 40-\u00b5m coronal sections were cut on a cryostat (Leica, Germany). Free-floating sections were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 48 hours with anti-c-Fos antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The primary antibody was detected using a Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Ca, USA), and the diaminobenzidine reaction product was developed using a nickel-enhanced glucose oxidase method (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Ca, USA). The sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific) and counterstained with Neutral Red. Cell counting was performed using Imaris software (Bitplane Scientific Solutions) on images captured under 40X magnification. Using a 10\u00d710 grid on which the specific region of interest was outlined, Fos-positive cells were counted within the hippocampus, somatosensory cortex (cortex), thalamus (paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT)), hypothalamus (paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN)), caudate nucleus (CN), lateral septal nucleus (LS), substantia nigra (STN), dorsal raphe (DR), locus coeruleus (LC), and nucleus accumbens (NA). The hippocampus was further divided into sub-regions: CA1, CA2-3, and the dentate gyrus (DG).\n\nHistology\nTwo months after exposure to the A/PFE, 3 mutants and 3 WT littermates and an equal number of corresponding control mice were sacrificed for histological analysis. Brains were rapidly removed, frozen on dry ice, and 35-\u00b5m sections were cut on a cryostat (Leica, Germany). Coronal sections, 400 \u00b5m apart, from Bregma \u22120.46 mm to \u22123.38 mm, were examined. Sections were stained with 1% cresyl violet (CV, Sigma), and cell counts were performed using Imaris software (Bitplane Scientific Solutions) on images captured under 40X magnification. Using 10\u00d710 grids outlining the regions of interest, CV-positive cells were counted within the somatosensory cortex and the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) hippocampal regions.\n\nBehavior analysis\nOpen Field\nThe open field consisted of a 60\u00d760 cm\n2\narena enclosed with opaque Plexiglas. The center zone was defined as a 30\u00d730 cm\n2\narea in the center of the chamber. Each mouse was placed along one side of the apparatus and allowed to explore for 10 minutes (13 male/genotype/treatment). Mice were videotaped and scored with experimenters blind to genotype and treatment using the ANY-maze Video Tracking System (Stoelting Co.). Behaviors scored included time spent in the center zone, latency to enter the center zone, total distance travelled, average speed, and total time spent immobile.\nThree chamber social interaction\nSocial recognition and memory were examined using a three-chambered apparatus. Each chamber measured 20 cm\u00d740 cm\u00d722 cm (h), and the partitions that separated each chamber had a 5 cm\u00d75 cm square opening in the bottom center. A cylindrical wire cage, served as the inanimate object or the cage for housing the stranger mice. The test mouse (13 male/genotype/treatment) was first placed in the center chamber, with an empty wire cage in the left and the right chambers, and allowed to explore for 10 minutes. In the second 10-minute session, an age- and gender matched FVB/NJ mouse (stranger) was placed in one of the wire cages while the wire cage on the other side remained empty. The test mouse was again placed in the center camber and allowed to explore. For the third 10-minute session, a second age- and gender-matched FVB/NJ stranger mouse (novel mouse) was placed in the wire cage that previously served as the empty cage. Thus, the test mouse had a choice between a familiar mouse and a novel mouse. The test mouse was again placed in the center chamber and allowed to freely explore for 10 minutes. All three sessions were videotaped and the video was analyzed by an experimenter blind to genotype and treatment using the ANY-Maze Video Tracking System (Steolting Co.). The times spent in each chamber and within 5 cm of each wire cage were measured.\nNovel Object Recognition\nThe novel object test was used to evaluate recognition memory. Testing was conducted in the open field arena described above. The paradigm involved 4 days of testing. On day 1, each mouse (13 male /genotype/treatment) was placed in the empty arena and allowed to explore for 10 minutes. On days 2 and 3, each mouse was allowed to explore two identical objects (either a clear 11.5 \u00d7 8.9 cm cube or a clear 10 cm diameter sphere) for 10 minutes, and the amount of time spent exploring each object was determined. To test for recognition memory, on Day 4, one of the objects was replaced with a novel object (cube replaced with sphere or vice versa) and the amount of time spent exploring each object was used to calculate a discrimination ratio (time exploring the novel object/(time exploring the novel object + time exploring the familiar object). The objects were counterbalanced so that half of the mice of each genotype either exposed to the cube or sphere on days 2 and 3. The mice were videotaped, and the videos analyzed by an experimenter blind to genotype and treatment using the ANY-Maze Video Tracking System (Steolting Co.). Methodologies for Novel cage and Forced swim test are provided as\nSupplementary Data\n.\nSlice preparation and recording\nSlice recordings were performed on 4 experimental groups: WT controls, WT mice that had undergone the A/PFE,\nRH/+\ncontrols, and\nRH/+\nmice that had undergone the A/PFE. To prepare brain slices, 2.5-5-month-old mice were deeply anesthetized with halothane, rapidly decapitated, and their brains were removed. Horizontal hippocampal slices were cut 350 \u00b5m thick with a vibratome (VT1200S; Leica Systems, Germany) in ice-cold sucrose-containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (in mM: 85 NaCl, 75 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 25 glucose, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 4 MgCl\n2\n, 0.5 CaCl\n2\n, and 24 NaHCO\n3\n). Slices were incubated in oxygenated normal ACSF (in mM: 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 2MgCl\n2\n, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, and 10 glucose) for 30 minutes to 1 hour at 27\u00b0C. All solutions used in preparation and recording were oxygenated by bubbling 95% O\n2\n-5% CO\n2\n.\nElectrophysiological recordings were obtained using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA) and digitized with a Digidata 1322A digitizer (Molecular Devices), and data were acquired and analyzed with pClamp 10.2 software (Molecular Devices). Signals were sampled at 25 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz. The pipette solution contained the following (in mM): 126 K-gluconate, 4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Tris-GTP, and 10 Phospho-creatine, pH 7.2. The bath solution contained the following (in mM): 126 NaCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 2 Mg Cl\n2\n, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, and 10 glucose, pH 7.3. Whole-cell recordings were obtained with access resistance <30 M\u2126, and cells were held at \u221270 mV for all experiments. Cells were visualized using infrared DIC illumination under 40x magnification. Hyperpolarizing current injections of -10 pA and -30 pA were used to calculate cellular impedance. All cell impedances were in the 300-350 M\u2126 range. Firing patterns were recorded in response to 2-second depolarizing current injections in 20-pA increments, starting at 10 pA, up to 190 pA. For epileptiform activity measurements, cells were held in voltage-clamp mode at -70 mV in normal (2.5 mM) K\n+\noxygenated ACSF to determine baseline bursting activity. Cells were then depolarized by perfusing high (8.5 mM) K\n+\nACSF for 10 min, during which epileptiform bursting activity was recorded, followed by a washout for 5 minutes. The events above a selected threshold between 8-16 pA in a 1-minute window were analyzed to determine amplitude and frequency. Events elicited in the presence of high K\n+\nwere compared to those in regular ACSF.\nStatistical analysis\nThe Student t-test was used when comparing two sets of unrelated parametric data. Parametric data sets consisting of two or more variables were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Tukey\u2019s pairwise comparison test. The Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test was used when comparing two sets of unrelated non-parametric data, and greater numbers of variables were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. In the novel object recognition test, which compared a specific response to the response expected by chance (50%), a one-tailed t-test was used. A one-way or 2-way ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak\u2019s test for multiple comparisons was used to identify statistically significant differences in the firing rates of hippocampal neurons, intrinsic firing properties and excitatory activity of\nRH\nmutant mice and WT littermates. For ANOVA results that did not produce a significant interaction between the two factors,\npost hoc\ncomparisons were still made. These analyses were continued due to the error rate (alpha, ) being still properly controlled with multiple\npost hoc\ncomparisons even in the absence of a significant interaction (\nHancock and Klockars 1996\n,\nWare et al. 2012\n). In these instances, both interaction and Tukey\u2019s\nPost\nHoc values are listed. Dichotomous data were analyzed using the Fisher Exact test. All results were considered statistically significant if p\u22640.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Organotypic hippocampal slice culture\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). OHSCs were generated from P8-P10 Sprague Dawley rats as previously described (\nEffgen et al., 2012\n,\n2014\n;\nMorrison et al., 2006\n;\nVogel et al., 2016a\n). In brief, the hippocampus was excised, cut into 400 \u03bcm thick sections, and plated onto Millicell inserts (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2 mM GlutaMAX\u2122, 1X B27 supplement, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), and 25 mM D-glucose (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Following plating, cultures were fed every 2\u20133 days with full serummedium, containing 50%MEM, 25% Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution, 25% heat inactivated horse serum, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 25 mM D-glucose, and 10 mM HEPES (Sigma). Cultures were maintained for 10\u201314 days prior to blast injury.\n\n2.2. Primary blast exposure\nBlast injury methods have been described previously in detail (\nEffgen et al., 2012\n,\n2014\n;\nHue et al., 2014\n;\nHue et al., 2013\n;\nPanzer et al., 2012\n;\nVogel et al., 2016a\n). Cultures were placed into sterile bags, filled with pre-warmed, serum-free medium, pre-equilibrated with 5% CO\n2\nat 37 \u00b0C. Any air bubbles were removed from the bag, which was sealed and placed into the receiver column. The receiver column was filled with pre-warmed water (37 \u00b0C), sealed with a silicone membrane, and the shock tube was fired. Piezoresistive pressure transducers (Endevco 8530B-500, San Juan Capistrano, CA, USA) recorded incident pressure at the shock tube exit and inside the fluid-filled receiver. Peak overpressure, duration, and impulse were recorded, processed, and quantified as previously described (\nEffgen et al., 2012\n,\n2014\n;\nHue et al., 2013\n;\nVogel et al., 2016a\n). Sham cultures were treated identically except the shock tube was not fired.\nBased on previous studies, a blast exposure intensity was utilized that produced consistent deficits in LTP, characterized by the peak pressure, duration, and impulse of the in-air shock wave (336 \u00b1 8 kPa, 0.84 \u00b1 0.01 ms, 87 \u00b1 2 kPa\u00b7ms) and the in-fluid pressure transient (598 \u00b115 kPa, 1.85 \u00b10.30 ms, 440 \u00b113 kPa\u00b7ms) (\nVogel et al., 2016a\n). Following blast or sham exposure, cultures were immediately removed from the receiver and returned to the incubator in fresh, full serum medium. Cultures were maintained in full serum medium until the indicated time points.\n\n2.3. Drug treatment\nA stock solution of roflumilast (SML1099, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in DMSO at a final concentration of 200 \u03bcM. The drug was further diluted in fresh, full serum medium (\u22640.07% DMSO) at indicated concentrations: 100 pM, 1 nM, 10 nM, and 100 nM. Cultures were placed into drug-containing medium immediately following blast injury. In a separate set of cultures, roflumilast (1 nM) or DMSO vehicle was delivered to OHSCs at varying times following blast exposure: 0 h, 1 h, 6 h, and 23 h. To further evaluate the effect of delayed roflumilast delivery, a separate set of cultures were treated with roflumilast 24 h following injury and function was evaluated 48 h following injury.\nA stock solution of piclamilast (SML0585, Sigma-Aldrich), another PDE4 inhibitor, was dissolved in DMSO at a final concentration of 10 \u03bcM. The drug was further diluted in fresh, full serum medium (\u22640.07% DMSO) to 5 nM, which was used to treat cultures at the indicated time points following blast exposure.\nA stock solution of ibudilast (I0157, Sigma-Aldrich), another PDE4 inhibitor, was dissolved in DMSO at a final concentration of 200 mM. The drug was further diluted in fresh, full serum medium (\u22640.07% DMSO) to 1 \u03bcM, which was used to treat cultures at the indicated time points following blast exposure.\nA stock solution of papaverine (CDS021481, Sigma-Aldrich), a partially selective PDE10A inhibitor, was dissolved in DMSO to 400 \u03bcM. The drug was further diluted in fresh, full serum medium (\u22640.07% DMSO) to 200 nM, which was used to treat cultures at the indicated time points following blast exposure.\nFor all experiments, an additional group of injured or sham cultures were treated with DMSO vehicle (0.07%) for comparison to drug-treated cultures.\n\n2.4. Electrophysiology\nElectrophysiological activity within the OHSC was recorded using 60-channel MEAs (8 \u00d7 8 electrode grid without the corners, 30 \u03bcm electrode diameter, 200 \u03bcm electrode spacing) at the indicated time points following blast injury (60MEA200/30iR-Ti-gr, Multi-Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany). OHSCs were perfused with aCSF (norm-aCSF) containing 125 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO\n3\n, 1.2 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.4 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1.3 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 mM HEPES, and 10 mM glucose (pH=7.40), which was bubbled with 5% CO\n2\n/95% O\n2\nand warmed to 37 \u00b0C, as previously described (\nYu and Morrison, 2010\n). Recordings were acquired with an MEA1060-BC amplifier and data acquisition system (Multi-Channel Systems). Neural signals were recorded at 20 kHz with a 6 kHz analog, anti-aliasing filter and then further filtered in MATLAB, using an eighth-order, digital low-pass (1000 Hz) and a fourth-order, digital, high-pass (0.2 Hz) Butterworth filter.\n\n2.5. Spontaneous activity\nSpontaneous neural activity was measured by recording continuously for 3 min from all electrodes within the hippocampus, as previously described (\nVogel et al., 2016a\n). In brief, neural event activity was detected based on the multi-resolution Teager energy operator (\nChoi et al., 2006\n;\nKang et al., 2014\n;\nKang and Morrison, 2014\n,\n2015\n;\nPatel et al., 2015\n). Data from each electrode was segregated by anatomical ROI (dentate gyrus [DG], cornu ammonis 1 [CA1], cornu ammonis 3 [CA3]). The effect of blast injury and drug-treatment on spontaneous event rate, magnitude, and duration were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with statistical significance set as\np\n< 0.05 (SPSS v22, IBM; Armonk, NY). It is important to note that there no significant difference between vehicle-treated cultures and roflumilast-treated cultures was observed for the number of electrodes per region.\nSpontaneous network synchronization was also quantified using previously published methods (\nKang et al., 2014\n;\nLi et al., 2007\n;\nLi et al., 2010\n;\nPatel et al., 2012\n;\nVogel et al., 2016a\n). In brief, correlation between neural events was calculated for each electrode pair based upon neural event-timing, where two events occurring within 1.5 ms were considered synchronous, and the total number of events. A correlation matrix was constructed which represented the strength of correlation between electrode pairings. To determine statistical significance, this data was compared to randomized surrogate time-series data without correlated activity, but with an equal event-rate, to identify significantly synchronized clusters. The global synchronization index (GSI), ranging from 0 (random, uncorrelated activity) to 1 (perfectly synchronous, correlated activity on all electrodes), was calculated from the clusters of electrodes with the highest (significant) degree of synchronization. This analysis was based upon the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix, which represented correlation strength, and associated eigenvectors, which represented the cluster of electrodes. The effects of blast exposure and drug-treatment on GSI were analyzed by two-way ANOVA, with statistical significance set as\np\n< 0.05.\n\n2.6. Stimulus-response curves\nStimulus-response (SR) curves were generated by applying a constant current, bi-phasic, bi-polar stimulus (100 \u03bcs positive phase followed by 100 \u03bcs negative phase) of increasing magnitude (0\u2013200 \u03bcA in 10 \u03bcA increments) to electrodes located in the Schaffer collateral (SC) pathway. As in previous studies, each electrode\u2019s response was fit to a sigmoidal curve, and three parameters were quantified: R\nmax\n, represented the maximum amplitude of the evoked response, I\n50\nrepresented the current necessary to generate a half-maximal response, and the term\nm\n, represented the slope of the sigmoidal fit (\nYu and Morrison, 2010\n). As before, data from each electrode was segregated by anatomical ROI. Each parameter (I\n50\n, m, R\nmax\n) for an electrode was averaged within a region to determine that regional response for any given slice. Data reported for each region is the average across slices within a given experimental group. The effects of blast exposure and drug-treatment on individual SR parameters were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with statistical significance set as\np\n< 0.05.\n\n2.7. Long-term potentiation\nFollowing SR recordings, the ability to induce LTP by electrical stimulus was measured as previously described (\nVogel et al., 2016a\n). Baseline response was evoked by stimulating at I\n50\nacross the SC pathway once per minute for 30 min. LTP was induced by stimulating with a high-frequency stimulus (HFS) that consisted of three trains of 100 Hz pulses applied for 1 s at I\n50\nmagnitude, with each train separated by 10 s. Immediately following LTP induction, post-induction response was evoked by stimulating at I\n50\nonce every minute for 60 min. LTP induction was calculated as percent potentiation above baseline based on the last 10 min of recording in each recording window. To ensure only stable responses were included for analysis, electrodes were discounted if the coefficient of variance (pre or post-induction) was >20% (\nHeuschkel et al., 2002\n). The average number of discounted electrodes was 12%, and slices for which >50% of electrodes were discounted were removed from analysis. Only electrodes within the CA1 dendritic field and without spike-contamination were included in the analysis. The effect of drug treatment was analyzed by ANOVA, followed by Tukey HSD\npost hoc\ntests with statistical significance set as\np\n< 0.05. For the dose response study, the effect of roflumilast concentration was analyzed by ANOVA, followed by Tukey HSD\npost hoc\ntests with statistical significance set as\np\n< 0.05.\n\n2.8. Cell death measurement\nPropidium iodide (PI) fluorescence was used to observe the effect of roflumilast on cell viability. Cell death was measured immediately prior and 24 h following injury using 2.5 \u03bcM PI (Life Technologies) in serum-free medium. Previous studies with this injury model have reported that blast injury caused minimal cell death (\nEffgen et al., 2014\n;\nVogel et al., 2016a\n). Cultures were treated with full serum medium containing either 1 nM roflumilast or DMSO (0.07%) vehicle at 6 h post-injury. Cell death was determined for ROI, as previously described, using MetaMorph (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA), and reported as percentage area (\nCater et al., 2006\n;\nEffgen et al., 2012\n,\n2014\n;\nVogel et al., 2016a\n). To confirm OHSC viability, a subset of cultures were exposed to blast and either roflumilast or vehicle treatment, and subsequently subjected to an excitotoxic exposure of glutamate (10 mM for 3 h) 24 h following blast exposure (18 h following drug delivery). OHSC were returned to fresh serum-free medium following excitotoxic exposure, and cultures were imaged for cell death 24 h later. Cell death was analyzed by ANOVA, followed by Tukey HSD\npost hoc\ntests with statistical significance set at\np\n< 0.05.\n\n2.9. Chemically-induced LTP (chemLTP)\nIn a separate set of cultures, LTP was chemically induced. The chemLTP protocol replaced electrical LTP induction with a 3 min perfusion with a modified aCSF solution (gly-aCSF) (\nLu et al., 2001\n): norm-aCSF containing 200 \u03bcM glycine and 0 mM MgCl (reduced from 1.3 mM). Perfusate was then switched back to norm-aCSF for 20 min prior to assessing LTP induction. LTP was quantified as described above, including procedures to include only stable recordings from the CA1 dendritic field that did not contain spikes. The effect of drug-treatment was analyzed by ANOVA with statistical significance set as\np\n< 0.05.\n\n2.10. Western blotting\nFor each condition tested by Western blotting, 8 slice cultures from 2 different animals were collected for protein extraction at the indicated time points. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and 50 \u03bcg of protein per sample was separated on a 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gel (Life Technologies) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by semi-dry transfer, as previously described (\nVogel et al., 2016a\n). The membrane was blocked in TBS (pH 7.4) with 1% BSA for 90 min. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with primary Ab (total GluR1 [RRID:AB_1977216, 1:1000], phosphorylated GluR1-Ser\n831\n[RRID:AB_1977218, 1:500], total PSD-95 [RRID:AB_ 2092361, 1:500], phosphorylated stargazin-Ser239/240 [RRID:AB_ 10807145, 1:500], \u03b2-actin [RRID: AB_476692, 1:2000]) in TBS with Tween (TBS-T, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.4) and 0.25% BSA. To detect protein bands, the membranes were labeled with a corresponding secondary Ab (Donkey anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 or Goat anti-Mouse Alexa Fluor 647, Life Technologies). Fluorescence was detected using a CRi Maestro 2 Imaging System (Perkin Elmer). The bands were quantified using ImageJ software. Average fluorescence was quantified from, at minimum, 4 lysates per exposure group (8 slices per lane, 32 slices in total). All cultures were exposed to blast injury and received either 1 nM roflumilast or DMSO vehicle at 6 h post-injury. At 24 h post-injury, cultures were exposed to aCSF containing 200 \u03bcM glycine (LTP induction) or DMSO vehicle (No LTP induction) prior to cell lysis. The effects of drug-treatment and chemLTP treatment were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with statistical significance set as\np\n< 0.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Mice\nMale N171\u201382Q HD mice were mated to female B6C3F1/J mice (Jackson Laboratory, ME) to generate the experimental mice. Male mice were used in our current study, because we found gender-dependent phenotypic differences in N171\u201382Q HD mice, therefore we use male N171\u201382Q mice for this preclinical study as we did previously (\nJiang et al., 2013\n;\nJiang et al., 2012\n). Mice were randomly divided into six groups. DNP or placebo (1% sodium bicarbonate, pH 7.0) was orally given to the mice by gavage from 8 weeks old to the end of the study. Animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions with a reversed 12-h light/dark cycle maintained at 23 \u00b0C and provided with food and water ad libitum. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n2.2. Drug preparation\n2,4-DNP is slightly acidic and was dissolved by adding sodium bicarbonate. Briefly, DNP was added to water first and 90 mg/mL sodium bicarbonate solution was added at 1% to each dosing solution. Final drug concentrations were 0.5 mg/mL (for 5 mg/kg dose), 0.1 mg/mL (for 1 mg/kg dose) and 0.05 mg/mL (for 0.5 mg/kg dose). The DNP solution was stored at room temperature and kept from light. Fresh DNP solutions were made every three days.\n\n2.3. Behavioral tests\nMotor function was assessed on an 80-cm long and 5-mm wide square-shaped balance beam. The balance beam was mounted on 50-cm high supports. A bright light illuminated the start platform, and a darkened enclosed 1728 cm\n3\nescape box (12 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 12 cm) was situated at the end of the beam. Disposable pads placed under the beam provided cushioning if a mouse fell off the beam. Mice were trained to walk across the beam twice at least 1 h prior to testing. If a mouse stopped during training, the tail was gently pressed to encourage movement. After the training trial, mice were left undisturbed for at least an hour before testing. The time for each mouse to traverse the balance beam was recorded with a 60-s maximum cut-off, and falls were scored as 60 s. In addition to the 5 mm balance beam, the tapered beam was also used to evaluate hindlimb function. To increase sensitivity of the task and to encourage the mice to run the beam reliably, the beam was angled at 17\u00b0 from the horizontal such that the mouse was able to run uphill. Our apparatus also has a goal box, as the use of a goal box can be beneficial for expediting training and increasing the reliability of the test performance. As the beam is elevated above ground level, a soft landing area is essential beneath the beam, which in our laboratory consists of numerous bench pads. The traverse time when the mouse crossed the start line and ended was recorded.\n\n2.4. Survival\nSurvival was monitored daily by experienced investigators (B.W and Q.P). The mice were considered at the end of life when they were unable to right themselves after being placed on their backs and initiate movement after being gently prodded for 30 s.\n\n2.5. In vivo structural MRI acquisition and quantification of brain volume\nIn vivo structural MRI scans were performed on a horizontal 9.4T magnetic resonance imager (Bruker Biospin, Billerica) with a triple-axis gradient and an animal imaging probe. The detailed image capture and analysis were described in our previous study (\nCheng et al., 2011\n). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 1% isoflurane, respiration was monitored and the temperature was maintained during the entire scan. Images were acquired by a three-dimensional T2-weighted fast spin echo sequence with the following parameters: echo time (TE)/repetition time (TR) = 40/700 ms, resolution = 0.1 mm \u00d7 0.1 mm \u00d7 0.1 mm, echo train length = 4, number of average = 2 and flip angle = 40\u00b0. The imaging resolution and contrast were sufficient for automatic volumetric characterization of the mouse brains and substructures. The intensity-normalized images were submitted by the Diffeomap software to a linux cluster, which runs Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM). The transformations encode morphological differences between subject and template images and can be analyzed with deformation-based morphometry to detect regional changes in brain volume.\n\n2.6. Protein extraction and Western blot analysis\nMouse brain tissues were collected at 4-h following the last DNP administration. Striatum was homogenized in RIPA buffer (Sigma) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 150 mM sodium chloride, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and freshly prepared protease inhibitor (1:100, Sigma) and/or phosphatase inhibitor (1:100, Sigma). Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 \u00d7\ng\nfor 15 min at 4 \u00b0C and supernatant fractions were collected. Protein concentration was determined by the Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Protein Research Products). Soluble proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in the presence of 5% nonfat milk, and then incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4 \u00b0C: rabbit anti-DARPP32 (1:2000, EMD Millipore, Cat# AB10518), mouse anti-beta actin (1:5000, Sigma, Cat# A2228), mouse anti-PSD95 (1:1000, Sigma, Cat#P246), mouse anti-HSP70 (1:5000, ThermoFisher Scientific, cat#MA3\u2013028), and Rabbit anti-GRP78 (1:1000, EMD Millipore, cat#MABS474). The membrane was then exposed for 1 h to HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3000; GE Healthcare) and immune-reactive proteins were visualized with a chemiluminescence-based detection kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (ECL kit; Amersham Corp.).\n\n2.7. Measurement of F2-isoprostanes using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry\nBrain tissue samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until analysis at the Vanderbilt University Eicosanoid Core Laboratory. Cerebral cortex samples were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy as we described previously (\nMilne et al., 2013\n). Esterified (bound) F2-Isoprostanes (F2-IsoP) quantity is reported in \u201cng F2-IsoP/gm tissue\u201d.\n\n2.8. Statistics\nData are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD or SE. Statistical comparisons between groups were compared by One-way\nANOVA\nwith Holm-Sidak\npost-hoc\ntest. Survival data were analyzed by Kaplan Meier analysis."

    "Methods": "Animals\nC57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Surgical groups underwent unilateral chorda tympani nerve section at 2 months of age. The geniculate ganglion and anterior tongue were dissected 2, 14, 30, or 60 days (all n=6; half male and half female) after nerve section. Non-surgical control animals were age-matched with nerve-sectioned animals.\nBdnf\nLacZ/+\nmice, in which the\nBDNF\ncoding sequence at one allele is replaced by the\nE. coli\ngalactosidase (\nLacZ\n) sequence, were used to determine the localization of BDNF expression (\nJones et al., 1994\n;\nYee et al., 2003\n) were obtained from Kevin Jones.\nTo globally deplete BDNF, mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase under the control of the ubiquitin promoter (Jackson Laboratories, stock 007001) were bred with mice in which exon 5 of\nBdnf\nwas floxed (\nBdnf\nlox/lox\n, Jackson Laboratories, stock 004339). To efficiently manipulate\nBdnf\nexpression, one allele of\nBdnf\nwas deleted by crossing the resultant mice with\nBdnf\n+/-\nmice (Jackson Laboratories, stock 002266). Therefore, the animals used in this study lacked a functional\nBdnf\nallele, and\nBdnf\ncould be inducibly deleted from the other allele (CreER:\nBdnf\nlox/-\n). Three control genotypes were utilized for different comparisons.\nBdnf\nlox/+\nmice (with tamoxifen) were used to exclude any potential effects of tamoxifen administration. CreER:\nBdnf\nlox/+\nmice (without tamoxifen) were used to exclude the possibility of gene recombination in the absence of tamoxifen. Both of these mutants produce wild-type levels of\nBdnf\nmRNA expression (\nMeng et al., 2015\n).\nBdnf\nlox/-\nmice (with tamoxifen) were used to control for any effects of heterozygous\nBdnf\ndeletion. Non-surgical control mice for each genotype were littermates of the sectioned animals and received tamoxifen at the same time.

This dose has been previously used to effectively induce gene recombination in adult mice (\nMcGraw et al., 2011\n;\nMeng et al., 2015\n;\nRuzankina et al., 2007\n). Tamoxifen administration was initiated in all mice between post-natal days 60-70. Chorda tympani nerve section was performed 2 weeks after the end of tamoxifen administration. Mice were sacrificed 4 or 10 weeks after the final injection of tamoxifen (corresponding to 2 or 8 weeks after unilateral chorda tympani nerve section).\n\nUnilateral Chorda Tympani Nerve Section\nMice were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of dexmedetomadine hydrochloride (0.4 mg/kg body weight) followed by ketamine hydrochloride (40 mg/kg body weight) (\nGuagliardo and Hill, 2007\n). The surgical procedure was the same as used previously in rats (\nHill and Phillips, 1994\n;\nShuler et al., 2004\n). Mice were placed in a non-traumatic head restraint for ventral access to the chorda tympani nerve at the level of the neck. The chorda tympani nerve was located at its bifurcation from the lingual branch of the trigeminal nerve and was sectioned without damaging the trigeminal nerve. The surgical site was sutured and mice were allowed to recover on a water-circulating heating pad before being returned to their home cage. Atipamezole hydrochloride (2 mg/kg body weight) was injected intramuscularly immediately after surgery to counteract the effects of dexmedetomadine and thereby decrease recovery time from the anesthetic.\n\nRT-PCR\nMice were sacrificed by an overdose of Avertin (2.5% tribromoethanol; T48402, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The anterior tongue rostral to the circumvallate papilla was removed and rinsed with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and then cut in half evenly under a microscope. To isolate the entire lingual epithelium, tongue tissue containing fungiform papillae was incubated in sterile dispase I-solution (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for 30-40 minutes. After incubation, epithelial sheets were peeled from the underlying lamina propria. The lingual epithelium from each mouse was stored in RNAlater stabilization solution (Ambion, Austin, TX), and geniculate ganglia were stored in RNA isolation reagent (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) at -80\u00b0C until RNA extraction. For laser capture microdissection, tissues were frozen in RNase-free containers for sectioning.\nFor laser capture microdissection, mice underwent unilateral nerve section and 14 days later tissue was isolated (N=3). Geniculate ganglia and tongues halves (cut and uncut side) were cut into 10-\u03bcm thick sections on a cryostat and mounted on slides. Sections were dehydrated using serial concentrations of alcohol and xylene. After dehydration, tissues were placed on a laser capture microdissection microscope (Arcturus, ThermoFisher Scientific). Geniculate ganglia and taste buds were identified, laser-captured, and then collected in tubes containing total RNA isolation reagent (Qiagen). For geniculate ganglia, the entire region containing neurons for each section was captured. For each side of the tongue, all taste buds that could be identified without staining in each section were captured (25-30 taste buds/sample).\nExpression levels of mRNA in the tongue epithelium, geniculate ganglia, and taste buds were measured using RT-PCR. Total RNA from tissues was extracted using an RNeasy Micro Kit or RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). DNase I was applied to eliminate traces of DNA during the procedure. After extraction, RNA was analyzed using RNA 6000 Pico/Nano Chip Kits in a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), and RNA Integrity Number (RIN) and 28S:18S ratio were used to estimate RNA quality. Only RNA samples with RIN>8.0 were used in this study. Reverse transcription was performed using 200 U Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 50-ng random hexamers (Invitrogen) in a 25-\u03bcL reaction volume containing first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 0.5 mM dNTPs, and 40 U RNase inhibitor. To control for differences in the amount of RNA isolated from different groups, the same amount of RNA was used from each geniculate ganglion (3 ng) and lingual epithelium (50 ng) sample for cDNA synthesis.\nRT-PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM/7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), the TaqMan Universal PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems), and oligonucleotide primer/probe sets, which were designed from sequences available in the GenBank database (\nTable 2\n) using Beacon Designer software (Premier Biosoft International, Atlanta, GA). Where possible, primers were selected to span an intron to avoid amplification of genomic DNA contamination. TaqMan probes were labeled at the 5\u2019-end with a fluorescent reporter dye (fluorescein, FAM) and at the 3\u2019-end with a quencher dye (carboxytetramethylrhodamine, TAMRA). RT-PCR reactions were conducted using 10-\u03bcL total volumes with Master Mix 720/200 nM primer/probe sets (TaqMan PCR Kit). To normalize cDNA loading, all samples were run in parallel with the housekeeping genes, 18S ribosomal RNA, and phosphate GAPDH. Each assay was performed in triplicate. For quantification, the comparative 2\n\u2212\u0394\u0394CT\nmethod was employed to determine the expression changes of each target gene for each animal relative to housekeeping genes (\nLivak and Schmittgen, 2001\n).\nTable 2.\nSequences of primer pairs and probes used for real-time RT-PCR.\nGene GenBack Accession #\nSequence 5\u2019-3\u2019\nFragment size (bp)\nBdnf\n(X55573)\n110\nForward primer\nTGCAGGGGCATAGACAAAAGG\nReverse primer\nCTTATGAATCGCCAGCCAATTCTC\nTaqman Probe\nACTGGAACTCGCAATGCCGAACTACCCA\nNtf4\n(NM_198190)\n95\nForward primer\nAGCGTTGCCTAGGAATACAGC\nReverse primer\nGGTCATGTTGGATGGGAGGTATC\nTaqman Probe\nTGAGCAGTGAACCCGACCACCCAGG\nNtf3\n(NM-001164034)\nForward primer\nCAGAACATAAGAGTCACCGGAA\n94\nReverse primer\nTGTCCCCGAATGTCAATGG\nTaqman Probe\nCACCCACAGGCTCTCACTGTC\nTrkB\n(X17647)\n86\nForward primer\nAAGGACTTTCATCGGGAAGCTG\nReverse primer\nTCGCCCTCCACACAGACAC\nTaqman Probe\nCCAACCTCCAGCACGAGCACATTGTCAA\nP2rx3\n(MN-145526)\n113\nForward primer\nTTTCCCCTGGCTACAACTTC\nReverse primer\nCCCGTATACCAGCACATCAAAG\nTaqman Probe\nAGATGGAGAATGGCAGCGAGTACCG\n18S rRNA (X00686)\n76\nForward primer\nCAGGATTGACAGATTGATAGCTCTTTC\nReverse primer\nATCGCTCCACCAACTAAGAACG\nTaqman Probe\nCCATGCACCACCACCCACGGAATCG\nGAPDH (NM_008084)\n130\nForward primer\nAATGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTG\nReverse primer\nCAACCTGGTCCTCAGTGTAGC\nTaqman Probe\nCGTGCCGCCTGGAGAAACCTGCC\nNefL (NM_010910)\n67\nForward primer\nCAGCAGAACAAGGTCCTGGAA\nReverse primer\nAGCGGGAAGGCTCAGAGTG\nTaqman Probe\nCGAGCTGTTGGTGCTGCGCCAGA\nKrt8\n(NM_031170)\n130\nForward primer\nTCTTCTGATGTCGTGTCCAAGTG\nReverse primer\nGATCCTCGGACGGGTCTCTAG\nTaqman Probe\nCCACTGAAGTCCTTGCCAGCCTGAGC\nOpen in a new tab\n\n\u03b2-galactosidase Histochemistry\nMice were sacrificed by an overdose of Avertin (4 mg/kg body weight) and perfused and tissues immersion-fixed in ice-cold 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS/MgCl\n2\nsolution (2 mM MgCl\n2\nin PBS) for 1\u20132 hours at 4\u00b0C. Fixative was removed by multiple washes in ice-cold PBS/MgCl\n2\n. Tissues were frozen on dry ice in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) embedding medium and stored at -80\u00b0C. Tissue sections (40 \u03bcm) were mounted on SuperFrost Plus slides and allowed to air-dry for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. \u03b2-galactosidase histochemistry was performed on sectioned tissue. Tissue sections were washed in ice-cold PBS/MgCl\n2\nto thoroughly remove OCT and then immersed in X-gal staining solution (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, 0.02% Igepal, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, and 1 mg/ml X-gal in PBS/MgCl\n2\n) for 2\u20136 hours in a 37\u00b0C incubator. Slides were washed with PBS and allowed to dry overnight in a 37\u00b0C heater. Sections were mounted using Glycergel mounting medium (Dako North America, Carpinteria, CA) and imaged using a bright field camera.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were sacrificed by an overdose of avertin (4 mg/kg body weight), transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and post-fixed in PFA for 2 hours or immersion-fixed in 4% PFA overnight. Geniculate ganglia were dissected under a microscope. Tissues were then rinsed with PBS and incubated in 30% sucrose at 4\u00b0C overnight. Tissues were frozen the next day in OCT and stored at -80\u00b0C until sectioning on a cryostat. Serial sagittal sections of the tongue (20 \u03bcm) and geniculate ganglion (50 \u03bcm) were mounted on glass slides.\nTo visualize taste buds and innervation in serial sections, slides containing tongue tissue were first dried on a slide warmer (37\u00b0C) overnight. The next day, slides were rehydrated, placed in citric acid buffer (10 mM citric acid, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0), heated to 98-100\u00b0C for approximately 15 minutes in a boiling water bath, and allowed to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature for antigen retrieval. Slides were washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated overnight at room temperature with an anti-cytokeratin 8 antibody in PBS (supernatant, 1:50, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Troma-1-s, Iowa City, IA). After incubation with the primary antibody, slides were rinsed in PBS and incubated for 1.5 hours with an Alexa 488 anti-rat secondary antibody (1:500, Invitrogen). After washing in PBS, slides were incubated for 2 hours in blocking solution (5% normal goat serum and 2% Triton X-100 in PBS), followed by incubation with rabbit anti-P2X3 (1:500, Millipore, Billerica, MA, AB5895) and mouse anti-TUJ1 (1:500, Covance, San Diego, CA, MMS-435P) antibodies in blocking solution at room temperature overnight. After overnight incubation, slides were rinsed with PBS and incubated for 1.5 hours at room temperature with Alexa 555 anti-rabbit (1:500, Invitrogen) and Alexa 647 anti-mouse (1:500, Invitrogen) secondary antibodies in blocking solution. Slides were then rinsed with PBS and stained with DAPI (2 \u03bcL in 50 mL double-distilled water, Life Technologies, Foster City, CA) for 15 minutes. After rinsing with PBS, slides were mounted with fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL).\n\nQuantification of taste bud number, size, and innervation\nTaste buds were counted in 20-\u03bcm serial sagittal sections of the tongue, which included everything rostral of the circumvallate papillae using a Leica DMLB microscope (W. Nuhsbaum, Inc., McHenry, IL). The entire taste bud was followed through each section, such that taste buds were counted only once. In addition, each taste bud was examined for the presence or absence of P2X3-positive or TU11-positive innervation, in order to determine the percentage of taste bud that were innervated.\nTo measure the volume of innervation and taste cell number per taste bud, individual taste buds (6/tongue half) were imaged for analysis using an Olympus Fluoview, FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope (LSI3-FV1000-Inverted, B&B Microscopes Limited, Pittsburgh, PA). Because taste buds are larger on the back of the tongue than at the tip (\nBiggs et al., 2016\n), taste buds were chosen from the front one-third of the fungiform field in order to reduce anterior-posterior variation in taste bud size. During both image acquisition and analysis, the investigator was blind to each specimen\u2019s genotype. For each optical image, the signals from four channels were collected separately using single-wavelength excitation, and then merged to produce a composite image. Serial optical sections were captured every 1 \u03bcm in labeled whole taste buds at 60\u00d7 magnification with the zoom set at 3.5. As a single taste bud was typically identified in two or three sections (i.e., spanning 36-60 \u03bcm), all sections containing a given taste bud were captured, such that the entire taste bud could be analyzed. Each physical section contained 15-20 optical sections. Each optical section was traced (\nFigure 1F-I\n), and the traced area was measured using Neurolucida imaging software (MicroBrightField, Bioscience, Williston, VA). The area of each optical section was summed across all physical sections to yield taste bud volume. The volume of anti-P2X3 and anti-TUJ1 immunostaining in taste buds was measured using MBF ImageJ software (ImageJ 1.47) (\nJensen, 2013\n), which sets an unbiased threshold automatically, and pixels were analyzed for every section. The number of labeled pixels inside a taste bud for each optical section was summed to obtain the total volume occupied by nerve fibers for each taste bud.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nBdnf\ncontinues to be expressed in the geniculate ganglion and lingual epithelium after chorda tympani nerve section, while expression of the taste bud marker, cytokeratin 8 (\nKrt8\n), is decreased.\nBdnf\nmRNA expression levels (normalized to non-surgical controls) as determined by qRT-PCR did not change 2, 14, 30, or 60 days after nerve section in the geniculate ganglion (A) and the lingual epithelium (B). In contrast,\nKrt8\nexpression levels (normalized to non-surgical controls) in the epithelium decreased 14, 30 and 60 days after nerve section (C). Numbers in each bar are the number of animals contributing to each data point. These findings are consistent with loss and recovery of taste buds following nerve section, with no loss of\nBdnf\nexpression, possibly because\nBdnf\nexpression is not limited to taste buds. (D) We observed\nBdnf\nexpression in both taste and non-taste cells in the tongue. Dashed lines illustrate the border between the laminia propria and th epithelium and also the tongue surface. In a fungiform papilla from a\nBdnf\nLacz/+\nmouse, the \u00df-galactosidase reaction product can be seen in the taste bud and in the lamina propria ventral to the taste bud (top left arrow) and immediately adjacent to the taste bud (top right arrow). Occasionally, the \u00df-galactosidase reaction product was observed in the filiform epithelium of\nBdnf\nLacz/+\nmice, but never in wild-type mice (D, bottom right). **p<0.01.\nTaste cell number was determined by counting DAPI staining within cytokeratin 8-positive taste buds. DAPI-labeled nuclei were followed through optical sections, such that each nucleus was counted only once. As each taste bud appeared in more than one physical section, the number of cells was summed across all physical sections. A small number of cells may have been counted twice in cases of split nuclei.\n\nStereology\nStereological methods were used to count the total number of geniculate ganglion neurons. Fixed ganglia were serially sectioned (50 \u03bcm), mounted on slides, and stained with cresyl violet for 15 minutes. To maintain section thickness, sections were not dehydrated and were mounted in Dako Glycergel mounting medium (Dako North America) for stereological quantification. Using StereoInvestigator software (MBF Bioscience), a blind investigator traced a contour around the geniculate ganglion at 20\u00d7 magnification. Every section containing the ganglion was traced, and at least four sections were quantified. Within each traced contour, the software randomly determines the placement of the counting frames. The depth of the counting frame was equal to the minimal thickness of the section minus a 10-\u03bcm guard zone (i.e., 5 \u03bcm from the top and bottom of the section). Geniculate ganglion neurons were counted at 100\u00d7 magnification in each counting frame (15 \u03bcm\n2\n). Neurons were counted only when they first came into focus (cell top), such that each cell was counted only once. Based on these measurements, total cell number in each ganglion was estimated for the entire volume of the ganglion using the optical fractionator probe (MBF Bioscience).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll measurements in a given group were determined to have equal variance (Levene\u2019s test for homogeneity of variance, p>0.05). For statistical testing of\nBdnf\nmRNA levels in wild-type mice following nerve section, one-way ANOVAs were used. For testing\nBdnf\nmRNA levels in transgenic mice, a two-way ANOVA was used. For taste bud numbers, geniculate neuron numbers, taste bud volumes, nerve innervation, taste cell numbers, taste bud numbers, and ganglion cell numbers, three-way ANOVAs were used (four genotypes by 2 treatments (chorda tympani sectioned vs unsectioned) at two times after treatment (2 and 8 weeks). For analysis of individual taste buds, the mean value from each mouse represents six different taste buds. After overall significance was determined, Tukey post-hoc tests were used to identify significant differences in pairwise comparisons when differences were found across genotype of p<0.05. The mean value of each group represents 3-4 mice. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05 for all comparisons; actual p-values are provided except when they were below the lowest reporting limit of the software (p<0.001)."

    "Methods": "2.1. Participants\nWe recorded 11 Parkinson's disease patients who had undergone bilateral implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) leads in the STN 2\u20137\u00a0days prior to the recording. Patients underwent DBS surgery to receive chronic high-frequency stimulation of the STN to improve motor symptoms. In the first operation, electrode extension cables were externalized through the scalp to enable recordings. In a second operative procedure, up to 7\u00a0days later, a subcutaneous DBS pacemaker was implanted and connected to the electrodes used for chronic stimulation. In this relatively small cohort the number of post-operative days before recording had no obvious effect on the spectral reactivity patterns. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and patients were recorded after obtaining informed written consent. One patient had to be excluded because of excessive movement artefacts during real gripping. This patient had Boston Scientific DB-2201\u2122 leads implanted. Clinical details of all patients included (mean age 61.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0years, mean disease duration 9.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0years, all right-handed, three female) are listed in\nTable 1\n.

Task\nPatients were seated in a comfortable chair with their elbows flexed at about 90\u00b0. They held a dynamometer (G200; Biometrics Ltd., Cwmfelinfach, Gwent, UK) in each hand and were asked to grip it with maximal effort three times to obtain the maximum sustainable force before starting the main session. They had to hold the grip for as long as a white dot was presented on a computer screen (4.5\u00a0s), and performed this procedure separately for each hand. The time point of the most stable force production was selected manually in each trial and the maximum sustainable force was then computed as the maximum of the three trials.\nIn the first part of the main experiment, patients were presented with a red bar on the screen that instructed them to grip at 15, 50 or 85% of the maximum sustainable force (\nFig. 1\n). The white dot and red bar both appeared either on the left or right field of the screen, which instructed them with which hand they should grip (left or right respectively). These were selected in a pseudo-random order. The red horizontal bars were presented at three different heights, corresponding to the different desired forces. The horizontal red bars were presented for 4.5\u00a0s in each trial. The exerted grip force was presented in real time as a vertical red column that increased in proportion to the force delivered. It replaced a vertical white column that corresponded to maximal sustainable force. The inter-trial interval was chosen randomly between 4 and 4.5\u00a0s. The time windows and force levels requested were set such that fatigue was kept to a minimum in the context of a time-limited post-operative study. Prior to the first recorded block, patients performed practice trials until they were comfortable with the task. We recorded three blocks in each condition. Each block contained 3\u20135 trials for each hand and force level (depending on the patient's fatigue, see\nFig. 2\n). After completion of a block, patients were allowed to rest for as long as they wished. This resulted in an overall average number of 11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0(SD) 2.8 trials per hand and force level.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nSequence of visual cues. A) In inter-trial intervals the arms were relaxed and the red cursor bars indicating the grip force registered by the dynamometers were down at the bottom of the white vertical bars. B) At the start of each trial, a white dot and a red horizontal bar appeared either behind the left or the right white bar corresponding to the left and right hand respectively. The cue displayed here instructs patients to grip with their right hand at the lightest level (15% of maximum sustainable force). C) Patients adjusted their grip force such that the red vertical column rises to the same level of the red horizontal bar. D) Example of a trial instructing gripping at the strongest level (85% of maximum sustainable force) with the left hand. In the imagined condition, the red horizontal cues indicate the force level and effector side as during real gripping, however the red vertical bar remained down.\nFig. 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nTime course of one block. The inter-trial interval (ITI) was followed by the cue onset (horizontal red bar), which remained present for 4.5\u00a0s in the executed gripping condition and for 2.5\u00a0s in the imagined gripping condition. Patients relaxed their arms between each trial in the ITI, which varied randomly between 4 and 4.5\u00a0s. Each hand and force level was performed 3\u20135 times depending on the patient's fatigue.\nIn the second part of the main experiment, the dynamometers were put aside and patients were asked to rest their arms still on their lap for imagined gripping. Patients were instructed to imagine the gripping action they had just performed without activating any muscles. They were told to keep their arms fully relaxed, and it was pointed out that this would be assessed via recordings from the electromyographic (EMG) electrodes placed on their forearm (\nFig. 3\n). However, they were not provided with real-time visual feedback of EMG or electrophysiological activity. The duration of the cue presentation was shortened to 2.5\u00a0s for the imagery condition to make it easier for patients to maintain imagery at the correct level for the whole trial duration and to avoid mind-wandering. Otherwise timings were kept the same as above. The imagery recordings were also split into three blocks allowing for breaks between blocks. Each block contained three trials per hand and force level resulting in an overall average number of 9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 trials for each hand and force level.\nFig. 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nEMG and dynamometer data averaged across patients. Left panels show EMG activity during real gripping (upper row) and imagined gripping (lower row). The three columns show the three different force levels requested by the visual cue. EMG activity at y\u00a0=\u00a00 in the upper row shows activity of the arm contralateral to the cued one, which was flat and shows that this arm remained relaxed. During imagined gripping no muscle activation was registered. The rightmost plot shows the average force trajectories. The black traces are slightly below the grey ones showing that the maximum force was weaker for the left arm. MSF\u00a0=\u00a0Maximum sustainable force.\n\n2.3. Recordings\nMonopolar LFPs were recorded with a TMSi Porti amplifier (2048\u00a0Hz sampling rate, common average reference, TMS International, Netherlands) simultaneously with the force data from two dynamometers and two EMG electrodes placed on the left and right extensor muscles of the forearm (data available on request). The data were re-referenced offline to obtain spatially focal bipolar signals by subtracting the data from neighbouring electrode contacts. If single channels were saturated or inactive, the remaining surrounding contacts were used instead.\nSubjective performance ratings after each of the three motor imagery blocks were recorded with a questionnaire asking \u201cHow well were you able to imagine gripping?\u201d Patients indicated their subjective perception on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 10 with 10 corresponding to \u201cVery well\u201d and 0 to \u201cNot at all\u201d.\n\n2.4. Data pre-processing\nAll data analyses apart from the computation of ANOVAs were performed in MATLAB (v. 2016a, The MathWorks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts). Trials containing artefacts in the force signal or movement artefacts in the LFP signal were removed following visual inspection. Data were down-sampled to 1000\u00a0Hz and high-pass filtered with a 5\u00a0Hz cut-off (Butterworth filter with a filter order of 6, passed forwards and backwards). Continuous wavelet transform with Morlet wavelets was then applied using the\nfieldtrip\n-function\nft_freqanalysis\n(\nOostenveld et al., 2011\n). The wavelet width was set to 8\u00a0cycles for frequencies below 30\u00a0Hz and to 26\u00a0cycles for frequencies higher than 50\u00a0Hz. For the gamma-band, power was averaged between 55 and 85\u00a0Hz. This range was selected to avoid line interference and to capture the reactivity observed particularly in this range (\nFig. 4\n; results were highly similar if statistics were computed with a 55\u201381\u00a0Hz band). 26\u00a0cycles thus provided an estimate of power within a window of about 0.37\u00a0s, which was similar to the 0.40s window including 8\u00a0cycles at 20\u00a0Hz.\nFig. 4.\nOpen in a new tab\nTime-frequency spectrograms during contralateral gripping. Red is a % increase and blue a % decrease relative to baseline, which was the average within \u2212\u00a02:\u2212\u00a00.5\u00a0s relative to the onset of the visual cue (shown as the vertical dotted line at t\u00a0=\u00a00). The three columns are light, medium and strong force levels (from left to right). The upper row of three plots shows gamma (55\u201390\u00a0Hz) and the lower row shows beta (10\u201330\u00a0Hz) power changes in each panel during the task. The upper panel (pair of rows of three plots) is for real gripping and the lower panel shows power changes during motor imagery. Data averaged across 18 STN from 10 patients. To reduce noise in these plots, smoothing was applied for each frequency by computing the average within a 0.5\u00a0s moving window.\nIn the next step, the power of the resulting time-frequency decomposition was down-sampled to 50\u00a0Hz and baseline-normalized. After computing the median across trials, a window ranging from \u2212\u00a02 to \u2212\u00a00.5\u00a0s prior to cue onset was chosen as baseline (\u2212\u00a00.5\u00a0s to limit inclusion of any preparatory beta decrease that might have occurred close to the cue). We analysed only bipolar contacts that showed a significant movement-related beta decrease upon real gripping across all contralateral grip trials irrespective of force level (assessed by one-sample\nt\n-tests against zero) and thus should be located close to the dorsal, i.e. sensorimotor region, of the STN (\nLevy et al., 2002\n,\nWeinberger et al., 2006\n,\nWilliams et al., 2005\n). From these bipolar contacts, the bipolar contact and the frequency (\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Hz) with the largest beta decrease was selected. If none of the bipolar contacts of an electrode recorded a significant beta decrease, this electrode was excluded from further analyses. In total, 1 of 20 electrodes was excluded.\nTo assess the spectral change, we tested the time-averaged normalized power from 0.5 to 2.5\u00a0s after the cue for frequencies in the beta range (12\u201330\u00a0Hz in 2\u00a0Hz steps). The window started at 0.5\u00a0s to allow for reaction times, which were around 0.5\u00a0s as displayed in\nFig. 3\n. EMG activity was filtered between 3 and 400\u00a0Hz (Butterworth filter with a filter order of 6, passed forwards and backwards) and rectified. To examine if the velocity of grip onset differed between force levels, the peak rate of force generation was calculated as the maximum of the differentiated force.\n\n2.5. Statistical analyses\nGripping consists of an onset phase and a later period during which grip force is more or less sustained. Thus, we separated the data into an early and late time window.\nFig. 3\nshows that movement started only about 0.5\u00a0s after the cue and that it took up to 1.7\u00a0s after the cue to reach the desired level across the different cued grip strengths. Thus, the early window was defined to span 0.5\u20131.7\u00a0s and the late window 1.7\u20132.5\u00a0s. As durations of executed and imagined movements have been reported to be similar (\nPapaxanthis et al., 2002\n), we assumed that these windows adjusted to the time course observed during real gripping reflected similar time periods related to the motor process in the imagined condition.\nFor each subject, the median power change across trials was computed for each force level to obtain a robust estimate of power changes, and then this was averaged within the two time windows. The data were then subjected to the following repeated-measures ANOVA using SPSS (v. 22, IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.):\nA 2 (\ntask\n: real and imagined gripping)\u00a0\u2217\u00a02 (\neffector side\n: contra- and ipsilateral grips)\u00a0\u2217\u00a03 (\nforce level\n: low, medium and high force) ANOVA with the gamma-beta power changes (\nTan et al., 2013\n) as dependent variable to test for significant differences across force levels and to see if the degree of modulation was lateralized. We then examined within-subject contrasts to test if the linear component of the factor\nlevels\nwas also significant with beta or gamma modulation alone as dependent variable. Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied where necessary and the correction factor \u025b reported if the sphericity assumption was violated. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons were performed with\nt\n-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests if the normality assumption was violated. To test if the linear component of the factor levels was significant, we computed within-subject contrasts in SPSS.\nCorrelations of power changes (beta, gamma and gamma-beta power changes) between the real and imagined gripping at the strongest force level were computed as Spearman's rank correlation coefficients with bootstrapped confidence intervals using the\nSpearman\nfunction from the Robust correlation toolbox (\nPernet et al., 2013\n). Finally, we also tested if the gamma-beta power change from the lightest to the strongest level during motor imagery was correlated with subjects' self-rating of how well they were able to imagine gripping (again using the\nSpearman\nfunction)."

    "Methods": "The study has received approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and all studies were conducted in accordance with the United States Public Health Service\u2019s Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nAnimal model of global fetal H\u2013I and sample collection\nNew Zealand White pregnant rabbits (Covance, NJ) at embryonic day (E) 25 (78% term) underwent sustained uterine ischemia induced by inflation of intra-aortic balloon catheter for 40 minutes, which caused\nin vivo\nglobal fetal H\u2013I (\nDerrick et al., 2004\n). Sham control dams underwent the same surgical procedure, including intra-aortic balloon catheter insertion, but without the balloon inflation and did not receive uterine ischemia. The dams were allowed to deliver in a nest box at term (31.5 days).\nAt postnatal day 1 (P1), the kits underwent neurobehavioral testing to determine the extent of motor and sensory deficits, including muscle tone measurements (\nDerrick et al., 2004\n) and were stratified into three groups: hypertonic (muscle tone score >2 at least in one limb, n=9, 6 males and 5 females), non hypertonic after H\u2013I (muscle tone score =2, n=8, 6 males, 2 females) and sham control kits (n=9, 5 males, 4 females). Tone was assessed by passive flexion and extension of the forelimbs and hind limbs and scored (0\u20134) according to the modified Ashworth scale: 0 \u2013no increase in tone, 1 - slight increase in tone when the limb is moved in flexion or extension, 2- more marked increase in tone but limb easily flexed, 3- considerable increase in tone, passive movement difficult, 4- limb rigid in flexion or extension. One or two kits per litter were included in analysis.\nImmediately after neurobehavioral testing the kits were transcardially perfused with 10% buffered formalin (Sigma, St. Louis MO), brain and spinal cord removed and post-fixed in the same fixative for 1\u20132 weeks.\n\nMRI of ex vivo brains and spinal cords\nFixed P1 brains and spinal cords were rehydrated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 24 hours before imaging and immersed in non-aqueous media (fomblin Y, Sigma Aldrich, MO). Imaging was performed on a 14.1 T Bruker Avance imaging spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA). A 20-mm resonator was used to image brain samples and a 10 mm resonator was used for spinal cord samples.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) experiments consisted of 30 non-collinear directions diffusion weighted spin echo images with b=0 and 1.5 ms/\u03bcm\n2\n, \u03b4/\u0394= 3/7 ms. For brain samples, imaging parameters were TR/TE/NEX 4800/14.8/1, filed of view=2.12\u00d71.57 cm, matrix 142\u00d7105, 25\u201337 sagittal slices 0.3 mm thick with no gap covering whole brain from olfactory bulbs to the end of cerebellum. In-plane resolution was 150\u00d7150 \u03bcm and brain volumes were interpolates to isotropic 150 \u03bcm\n3\n. For spinal cord samples, imaging parameters were TR/TE/NEX 1500/16.3/2, filed of view=0.66\u00d70.24 cm, matrix 128\u00d748, 5 transverse slices 1.5 mm thick with no gap. In-plane resolution was 50\u00d750 \u03bcm.\nDiffusion tensor maps were calculated using multivariate linear fitting of signal attenuation from the acquired diffusion weighted images (\nBasser and Jones, 2002\n). FA maps were calculated (\nBasser et al., 1994\n) using in-house software written on Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA).\n\nMR imaging of fetal H\u2013I and samples of fetal brains at 48h after H\u2013I\nA subset of dams (n=4) were subjected to the same protocol of H\u2013I described above while being imaged inside MRI scanner, as described in detail in (\nDrobyshevsky et al., 2007a\n). Briefly, for each imaging session the dams were sedated with intravenous infusion of fentanyl (75 \u03bcg/kg/hr) and droperidol (3.75 mg/kg/hr). MRI was performed in 3T Siemens clinical magnet using quadrature extremity coil. Single shot fast spin echo T2-weighted images were taken for anatomical reference, covering all fetuses inside dam, followed by series of diffusion weighted echo-planar images (DWI) with b=0 and 0.8 msec/\u03bcm\n2\n, TR/TE = 7400/70 ms, slice thickness 4 mm, matrix 256\u00d7192, and field of view 16 cm. To monitor time course of H\u2013I, DWI imaging was performed during the 10 min of baseline before H\u2013I, 40 min of H\u2013I and 20 min of reperfusion. After imaging, the catheters were removed, vessels repaired and dam recovered.\nIn three fetuses (2 from one dam and 1 from another), fetal head and body position was sagittal relative to the imaging plane. Sagittal position of fetuses allowed unambiguous identification of the spinal cord and the fetal brain regions on each image to ensure that it did not move throughout the imaging experiment. For those fetuses, time course of ADC was extracted from the regions of interest placed on the fetal brains and corresponding cervical spinal cords. 48 hours after H\u2013I and MRI imaging, at E27, fetuses were delivered via laparatomy and were assigned into presumably non-hypertonic and hypertonic groups if the nadir of ADC in the fetal brain during H\u2013I was above or below threshold value 0.83 \u03bcm\n2\n/msec, as described in (\nDrobyshevsky et al., 2007a\n). MRI imaging and ADC measurement in this study were used only to stratify tissue sample by degree of injury when motor scoring was not possible, as was the case for pre-term kits that are not viable if delivered at E25 or E27. In addition, E27 spinal cord samples were obtained from a sham operated dam.\n\nAnalysis of FA and WM thickness by tract-based spatial statistics in fixed P1 brain\nFor the analysis of DTI data, a cross-subject voxel-wise Tract Based Spatial Statistics analysis (TBSS) (\nSmith et al., 2006\n;\nSmith et al., 2007\n), was utilized as implemented in the FSL software (\nhttp://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/\n). All individual FA volumes were registered to a template, the mean FA-map was calculated and thinned to represent the mean FA skeleton.\nThe following algorithm was implemented in Matlab to assign WM tract thickness values to each voxel in the brain (\nDrobyshevsky, 2016\n). A pair of neighborhood voxels, having FA greater than 0.2 and an angle between first eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor less than 30 degrees was considered belonging to the same WM tract. For each voxel on a WM tract, a subset of connected voxels belonging to this tract was found on intersection of on the plane, perpendicular to the tract course. The tract thickness value was determined as a diameter of the largest circle that fits within the polygon covering all voxels on the plane. As a result of the procedure, a map of WM tracts\u2019 thicknesses was created for each animal.\nFor each subject, voxel data were projected from FA and tract thickness maps to the nearest voxels on the mean FA skeleton. The skeleton voxel values were assigned to the maximum of the projected voxels. The values of voxels on the common skeleton were analyzed with voxel-wise cross-subject statistical analysis utilizing a general linear model (\nSmith et al., 2006\n;\nSmith et al., 2007\n). In the case of 2 groups, as in this study, testing the contrast between the group predictors is equivalent to an unpaired t-test of the mean difference between the groups. As a result of the procedure, statistical parametric maps were created containing p-values for the voxel-wise two-sample unpaired t-tests. The results were corrected for multiple comparisons by controlling the family-wise error rate. Cluster-forming threshold c=3 and 3000 permutations were used for nonparametric permutation inference FSL routine. Cluster-based thresholding is a method for correction for multiple comparisons by using the null distribution of the maximum (across the image) cluster size (\nFriston et al., 1994\n). This approach detects statistically significant clusters on the basis of the number of contiguous voxels whose voxel-wise statistic values lay above a pre-determined primary threshold.\n\nRegion of interest analysis in newborns brain and spinal cord\nBrain and spinal cord images were manually segmented into ROIs as shown in\nFigure 1\nusing color encoded directional diffusivities maps, where color intensity is weighted by FA. ROI definition relied primarily on anatomical landmarks and directional information. Differences in FA between gray and white matter were much larger than variations in FA in each ROI between the experimental groups, ensuring that any bias in ROI definition due to FA changes was minimal. Areas and diffusion indexes of the selected ROIs were obtained.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nRegions of interest in brain and spinal cord cross sections, overlaid on directionally encoded color FA map of a control kit. Legend on the bottom of panel A represents color encoding of the predominant diffusivity direction.\nA\u2013C. ROIs in brain white matter: ac - anterior commissure, f \u2013 fimbria, cc \u2013 corpus callosum, pwm \u2013 periventricular white matter, ic \u2013 internal capsule, cg \u2013cingulum, op \u2013 optic tract, cp - cerebral peduncle.\nD. Spinal cord white matter was segmented into dorsal (a), lateral (b) and ventral (c) funiculi. Gray matter was segmented into substantia gelatinosa (d), intermediate (e) and ventral (f) regions.\nMajor brain white matter tracts were segmented as shown on\nFigure 1A\u2013C\n. ROIs were placed on corpus callosum genu, internal capsule, periventricular white matter at the level of anterior commissure, cingulum and fimbria \u2013 at the beginning of anterior thalamus, optic tract and cerebral peduncle \u2013 at the level of midbrain 4 mm posterior anterior commissure.\nSegmentation of the spinal cord is shown in\nFigure 1D\n. To ensure that the same level of spinal cord is examined, ROIs were placed on a single slice, obtained from the center of cervical and lumbar expansions, identified by the widest portion on sagittal localizer scan. Spinal cord white matter was segmented into the following regions: dorsal funiculus (\nFigure 1D\n, a), which carries ascending sensory projections in the gracilis and cuneatus fascicules, lateral funiculus (\nFigure 1D\n, b), which carries a mixture of fibers from descending corticospinal, rubrospinal, and ascending dorsal spinocerebellar tracts and ventral funiculus (\nFigure 1D\n, c) that contains fibers of descending reticulospinal (ReST) and vestibulospinal (VST) tracts and ascending spinothalamic tract. In rabbits, the crossed corticospinal tract travels in the lateral columns of white matter and the uncrossed travels in the ventral white matter columns, similar to primates and carnivores, and unlike rodents (\nArmand, 1984\n;\nButler and Hodos, 2005\n). An ROI containing the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn was delineated from the rest of gray matter based on directional information and less color intensity due to sharply lower FA values in this region. The rest of the spinal gray matter was delineated into intermediate and ventral portions based on anatomical landmarks including the central canal and the lateral concave point (\nFigure 1D\n).\n\nHistological analysis of injury in spinal cord\nFetal spinal cords from E27 and P1 kits (n=5 per age/per experimental group) were dissected and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for at least 24 hours, cryoprotected with 20% sucrose and frozen. 20 micron cryosections were obtained from cervical and lumbar expansions.\nFor\nin situ\nfluorescent detection of DNA fragmentation (TUNEL), tissue sections were air dried on slides, hydrated in 0.01 M PBS, and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. An ApopTag-fluorescein\nin situ\nDNA fragmentation detection kit (catalog # S7110; Millipore) was used to visualize TUNEL-labeled nuclei. Slides were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific).\nTo assess neuronal degeneration, frozen sections were mounted on gelatin coated slides, air dried, immersed in a basic alcohol solution consisting of 1% sodium hydroxide in 80% ethanol for 5 min, rinsed for 2 min in 70% ethanol and water, incubated in 0.06% potassium permanganate solution for 10 min, and stained in 0.0001% solution of Fluoro-Jade C (Histo-Chem, AK) in 0.1% acetic acid for 10 min, dehydrated in alcohols, cleared in xylene and mounted with DPX.\nFor immunostaining of astroglia, primary antibodies were chicken polyclonal Anti-GFAP antibody (Abcam ab 4674, 1:200). The secondary antibodies were Goat Anti-Chicken IgY H&L (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488) (Abcam ab150169). The sections were hydrated in 0.01 M PBS, blocked in 5% normal goat serum, incubated with the primary antibodies at 4 \u00b0C overnight, and then with the secondary antibody diluted at room temperature for 60 min and mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific).\n\nStereological estimation of motor neurons\u2019 number in the spinal cord and gliosis\nTissue was sampled at 400 \u03bcm intervals through the cervical (C4\u2013C8) and lumbar (L4\u2013L7) spinal cord expansions of each animal (n = 5 per group). Nissl staining was performed using cresyl violet. Motor neurons were identified by morphology (multipolar neurons with clear cytoplasm, soma diameter >20 \u03bcm and distinguishable nucleus) and location (within the ventral horns in Rexed\u2019s lamina VIII or IX) and counted bilaterally. An optical fractionator probe in StereoInvestigator (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT, USA) was used to obtain an unbiased estimate of the total number of motor neurons by a stereological formula. The cells were counted from five sections under a 10\u00d7 objective with a counting grid 50\u00d750 \u03bcm\n2\n, sampling grid 400\u00d7400 \u03bcm\n2\n. The Gundersen coefficient of error of the stereological estimation for each animal ranged from 0.05 to 0.15.\nNumbers of TUNEL- and Fluoro-Jade JC-positive cells were quantified in cervical lumbar spinal cord expansions using optical fractionator probe in StereoInvestigator. Spinal cord cross section areas were outlined on the section under 5\u00d7 objective as reference space. The cells were counted under a 20\u00d7 objective with a counting grid 50\u00d750 \u03bcm\n2\n, sampling grid 400\u00d7400 \u03bcm\n2\n. The Gundersen coefficient of error of the stereological estimation for each animal ranged from 0.05 to 0.12.\nGliosis was quantified as the area fraction of GFAP-labeled astrocyte somata in gray and white matter in cervical lumbar spinal cord expansions using area fraction fractionator probe in StereoInvestigator. White and gray matter regions were outlined on the section under 5\u00d7 objective as reference space. Counting frame size was 200\u00d7200 \u03bcm, interframe interval 400 \u03bcm, Cavalieri grid size 10\u00d710 \u03bcm).The area fraction of glia was quantified under 20\u00d7 objective as the ratio of product of the area per point and number of points hitting reference area over the product of the area per point and number of points hitting the sampled area. Sampling coefficient of error was less than 0.10.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAreas and diffusion indexes of the selected ROIs in brain and spinal cord, cell number estimates and astroglia fractions were compared between sham, non-hypertonic and hypertonic groups using one-way univariate ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc comparisons. Significance was determined at level 0.05. Relationship between cerebral peduncle FA and cross-section area, as dependent variables, and spinal gray and white matter cross-section area, as predictors, were assessed using a linear regression model. Statistical analysis was performed using Minitab 16."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAdult male C57BL/6 mice (\nn\n= 64) (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine) were housed in a vivarium at 25\u00b0C under a 12 hour light/dark cycle and were allowed access to food and water\nad libidum\n. All experimental procedures occurred during the light cycle. All procedures were approved by and in accordance with the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nSpinal Cord Injury Surgery and Treatments\nBefore surgery, animals were deeply anesthetized via ketamine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) injection (i.p.). The surgical site was shaved and disinfected with isopropyl alcohol and betadine. A small incision was made on the dorsal surface, and the muscle and subcutaneous tissue overlaying the thoracic spine were retracted. A T9 laminectomy was performed to expose the mid-thoracic spinal cord. Severe contusions were produced using the Infinite Horizons impactor device (75 kdyn; Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Lexington KY, USA) as we have described previously (\nZhang et al., 2015b)\n. The hit parameters (mean \u00b1 SD) for mice included in final analyses were equivalent between vehicle (n=19) and pioglitazone (n=29) treated injury cohorts for impact force [vehicle group (78.26 kdyn \u00b1 2.56) vs pioglitazone group (78.48 kdyn \u00b1 3.0)], cord displacement [vehicle group (586.2 \u03bcm \u00b1 91.74) vs pioglitazone group (559.3 \u03bcm \u00b1 80.53)], and velocity at impact [vehicle group (120.9 m/s \u00b1 2.77) vs pioglitazone group (122.0 m/s \u00b1 2.26)]. Any injured animals with abnormalities in the force vs time curve, which are indicative of bone hits or instability of the spinal cord, were excluded from analysis. For biochemical assessment of mitochondrial integrity, sham mice (\nn\n= 7) received laminectomy only and displayed normal hind-limb function post-surgery. The wound was closed with monofilament suturing of the muscle and skin incisions. Afterwards, animals were returned to their home cage placed a heating pad and administered injections (s.c.) of Buprenorphine SR (0.1 mg/kg, Reckitt Benckisser Pharmaceuticals Inc., Richmond, VA) and Baytril (2.5 ml/kg, mixed with 2 ml Sterile Saline), then allowed to regain consciousness.\nInjured mice being assessed for acute mitochondrial respiration (n=27 total) received an injection (i.p) of either pioglitazone (10 mg/kg, dissolved in DMSO at 3mg/ml) at 15 min (\nn\n= 9) or 3 hr (\nn\n= 10), versus vehicle (DMSO) 15 min after injury (\nn\n= 7), and they also received a booster of pioglitazone or DMSO at 24 hr post-injury, one hour prior to tissue harvesting. Due to postsurgical complications, one mouse died prior to acute biochemical assessments. Long-term behavioral experiments were carried out using two independent cohorts (n=30 total). Injured mice received an injection (i.p) of either 10mg/kg pioglitazone (\nn\n= 10) or 100% DMSO (\nn\n= 12) 15 min after injury, and then daily injections (i.p.) of either pioglitazone or DMSO for 5 days post-injury, followed by injection (s.c.) of Baytril (2.5 ml/kg, mixed with 1 ml sterile saline). Manual bladder expression was performed twice daily on injured mice. Data for 8 injured mice are not presented because they were either excluded due to post-injury complications or died. Specifically, three mice were euthanized due to abnormal contusions, one due to severe bladder infection, two due to autophagia, and one mouse died during long-term behavioral experiments for unknown reasons.\n\nMitochondrial Isolation\nMitochondria from sham and injured spinal cords were isolated by modifying our previously reported method (\nPatel et al., 2014\n;\nPatel et al., 2009\n). At 24 hr post-injury, animals were decapitated and a 0.5 cm thoraco-lumbar spinal cord segment centered on injury site was rapidly dissected from all injured as well as naive mice and homogenized in an ice-cold dissecting plate containing isolation buffer with 1 mM EGTA (215 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 0.1% BSA, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, and pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1400 \u00d7g for 3 min at 4 \u00b0C. Supernatant was transferred to a new 2 ml tube (S1, containing mitochondria and cytosol). The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml isolation buffer and centrifuged at 1400 \u00d7g for 3 min and this supernatant was transferred to a new tube (S1\u2032, containing mitochondria and cytosol) and the pellet was discarded. Both supernatant fractions (S1 & S1\u2032) were then topped off with isolation buffer and centrifuged at 13,000 \u00d7g for 10 min. The resultant two pellets were pooled and resuspended in 500 \u03bcl isolation buffer (with EGTA) and burst in a nitrogen cell disruption bomb at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min at 1200 psi to release synaptic mitochondria from synaptosomes. Resultant differential mitochondrial suspension was then centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7g for 10 min. Pellets were re-suspended in ~20ul of isolation buffer (without EGTA). All samples were kept on ice throughout the isolation process. The protein concentrations were determined using BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) by measuring absorbance at 560 nm with a Biotek Synergy HT plate reader (Winooski, Vermont). Note: isolation and measurements of OCRs were completed as quickly as possible after dissecting the tissues (within 5\u20136 hrs).\n\nAssessment of Mitochondrial Respiration\nRespiration of mitochondrial samples was measured in terms of mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) using a Seahorse Bioscience XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer as described previously with slight modifications (\nSauerbeck et al., 2011\n). Briefly, 24 hr prior to each experiment, a 24 well dual-analyzer sensor cartridge (Seahorse Bioscience) was incubated with 1 ml/well of XF Calibrant solution (Seahorse Bioscience) at 37 \u00b0C in a CO\n2\n-free incubator (Seahorse Bioscience). On the days of experimentation, either A) pyruvate plus malate plus ADP, B) oligomycin, C) FCCP, or D) rotenone plus succinate were added in ports A\u2013D, respectively, in the Seahorse Flux Pak cartridges to yield final concentrations of 5 mM (pyruvate), 2.5 mM (malate), 1 mM (ADP), 1 \u03bcg/ml (oligomycin), 3 \u03bcM (FCCP), 100 nM (rotenone), and 10 mM (succinate) and placed into the Seahorse XF24 Flux Analyzer for automated calibration. During the sensor calibration, 50 \u03bcl volume of respiration buffer containing 5 \u03bcg of mitochondrial protein was added to each well of XF24 V7 cell culture microplates and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 4 min at 4 \u00b0C. This was followed by addition of 450 \u03bcl of respiration buffer (125 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.2) at 37 \u00b0C (gently added to each well) to make the final assay volume 500 \u03bcl per well. Plates were immediately placed into the calibrated Seahorse XF24 Flux Analyzer for assessment of mitochondrial OCR in the presence of substrates and inhibitors in respective ports. The OCR data were analyzed using Excel software package (Microsoft), point by point rates were generated using the AKOS algorithm written by AKOS Gerencser for Seahorse Bioscience. For State III and State V\u2014Complex I, the \u201cmiddle point\u201d (average) of OCR was generated from 4 time-dependent point-by-point rates for each well sample. Then, three independent middle points were averaged for each sample to generate n = 1 per sample.\n\nBehavioral Analyses\nRecovery of hind limb motor function was assessed as previously described using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) (\nBasso et al., 2006\n;\nZhang et al., 2015b)\n. Mice were assessed in an open field apparatus pre-surgically and at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post-injury (DPI) by two trained observers. Each hind limb was rated independently for movement coordination, and trunk stability, and then averaged to generate a single score on a scale of 0\u20139. Subscores were also assigned based on frequency of plantar stepping, paw placement, coordination, trunk stability, and tail position. Further assessments of hindlimb function were conducted using the gridwalk test (\nCummings et al., 2007\n;\nZhang et al., 2015a)\n. Briefly, the gridwalk apparatus consists of an elevated horizontal ladder (92 cm \u00d7 16.5 cm), with rungs (4mm in diameter) spaced 1cm apart, and with a covered black goal box at one end. A high speed camera (Basler scA640) was placed 32cm under the middle of the ladder. Animals were trained on the apparatus prior to surgery. At 28 DPI, mice were acclimated to the dark box for three minutes, then removed and placed at the opposite, uncovered end of the apparatus and recorded as they crossed the length of the ladder back into the dark box. At least three passes were recorded per animal. Each animal\u2019s best pass was chosen for analysis, as determined by overall coordination and uninterrupted movement. The total number of missed steps across 30 rungs was then calculated for each animal\u2019s best pass. A missed step was counted when an animals\u2019 hindlimb slipped below the horizontal plane of the rungs.\n\nSpinal Cord Tissue Processing\nTissues were processed according to our previously established methods (\nZhang et al., 2015b)\n. Briefly, mice were anesthetized via ketamine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) injection (i.p.). The chest cavity was then opened and animals were perfused transcardially with 0.1M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 7.4 pH) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1M PBS. A 1cm segment of spinal cord centered on the injury site was dissected and post-fixed in PFA for 2 hours before being washed overnight in 0.2M phosphate buffer (7.4 pH). Tissues were cryoprotected in 20% sucrose in 0.1M phosphate buffer saline at 4\u00b0C until the cords sank (3\u20135 days). Spinal cords were then trimmed to a 6mm segment centered on the injury epicenter and evenly distributed by experimental group into blocks containing optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound. The blocks were rapidly frozen then stored at \u221280\u00b0C. A total of 6 mm spinal cord segment was serially cryosectioned at 10 \u03bcm thick coronal sections and every section was collected for a total of 10 slide series, with 6 slides in each series. Therefore, adjacent sections on a slide were separated by 100 \u03bcm.\n\nHistology\nA modified Eriochrome Cyanine (EC) staining protocol for myelin was used to differentiate between damaged tissue and spared white and grey matter (\nRabchevsky et al., 2002\n;\nZhang et al., 2015a)\n. Briefly, slides were hydrated in dH20, submerged in acetone for 2 minutes, rehydrated in dH20, and then exposed to serial dilutions of decreasing concentration of EtOH before being incubated in EC for 30 minutes at room temperature. Excess stain was removed by dH20 washes and slides were differentiated in 0.3% Ammonium Hydroxide. All histological analyses were conducted blindly with respect to treatment condition using a Nikon microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and Scion imaging analysis software (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD, USA). Identification of intact white and grey matter was based on positive myelin staining as well as comparisons to normal cytoarchitecture. The cross-sectional area of lesion and spared tissues were quantified at 200\u03bcm intervals adjacent to the injury epicenter using the Cavalieri method (\nRabchevsky et al., 2002\n), for a total of 17 sections per animal.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nPrior to staining, frozen slide-mounted spinal cord sections were thawed for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C and rinsed with 0.1M PBS 3 \u00d7 5 min. Slides were then incubated at room temperature for 1hr in blocking buffer (0.1M PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, Fisher Scientific, Cat# BP1605), 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# X-100), 0.1% fish gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# G7765), and 5% normal goat (SigmaeAldrich, Cat# G9203). Double immunolabeling for ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA-1), to evaluate microglia/brain macrophages, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), to visualize the astrocytic scar, was performed by incubating slides in chicken anti-GFAP (10ug/ml; Aves, Cat# GFAP) and rabbit anti-IBA-1 (1ug/ml; Wako, Cat# 019-19741) primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C in blocking buffer. On the second day, slides were rinsed in 0.1M PBS followed by a 1 hr incubation at room temperature of goat anti-chicken Alexa Flour (AF) 488 (2ug/ml; Life Technologies A-11039) and goat anti-rabbit AF546 (2ug/ml; Life Technologies A-11010) secondary antibodies in blocking buffer. Slides were then rinsed in 0.1M PBS and then were incubated in DAPI (1:95 in 0.1M PBS; Invitrogen D1306) for 30 min, then rinsed and coverslipped with Immu-Mount (Thermo-Scientific, Waltham, MA).\n\nMicroscopy and Densitometry\nFluorescent images were captured using a C2+ laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY). For each animal, images were taken at the SCI epicenter (determined by lesion volume estimates and visually confirmed by GFAP staining) as well as 0.6mm and 1.2mm, rostral and caudal to the epicenter. A montaged maximum-intensity projection image, consisting of 9 adjacent z-stacks, was generated for each tissue section. When necessary, laser powers were adjusted to capture the full fluorescent intensity range of lightly stained sections. To quantify the proportional area of activated microglia/macrophages, threshold-based analysis of IBA-1 immunoreactivity was performed as described previously with modifications (\nDonnelly et al., 2009\n). Captured RGB images were opened in the MetaMorph analysis program (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and the perimeter of each section was digitally outlined referencing the cytoarchitecture revealed by GFAP and IBA-1 staining. Next, the AF546 channel was isolated and a threshold selected which identified positive IBA-1 staining above background. For each tissue section, the density of IBA-1 staining was calculated as the ratio of immunoreactive area/region of interest area (entire cross section).\n\nStatistical Analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). For mitochondrial bioenergetics, differences between groups were investigated via analysis of variance (ANOVA). Two-way ANOVA were run to analyze differences in tissue morphology across spinal cord levels and to determine changes in BMS data over time. The 28-day BMS subscores and histological assessments were analyzed by one-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s\nt\n-tests. Correlational analyses were run between histological measures and terminal BMS. When warranted, post-hoc analyses (Bonferroni) were performed. Significance was identified at p<0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals and behavioral analysis\nTransgenic mice expressing the human SOD1-G93A transgene (B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J; Stock No: 004435, Jackson Labs) were bred in house in accordance with IACUC SOP protocols. Copy number of the human transgene was assessed by qPCR (primers: GGG AAG CTG TTG TCC CAA G and CAA GGG GAG GTA AAA GAG AGC) and normalized to an internal control (primers: CAC GTG GGC TCC AGC ATT and TCA CCA GTC ATT TCT GCC TTT G). SOD1-G93A mice of our colony typically become symptomatic (defined as onset of weight loss) after 100 days of age (116.8 \u00b1 6.1 for females, 109.3 \u00b1 5.2 for males) and reach end-stage (defined as being unable to right itself within 30 s of being placed on its side) around 160\u2013170 days of age (168.2 \u00b1 3.8 for females, 160.1 \u00b1 2.7 for males). Mice were considered pre-symptomatic at P90, symptomatic at P120, and late-symptomatic at P140 (for CMAP analysis, after which signals are too low for reliable identification) and P150 (for histologic and homogenate protein analysis).\nAn EAAT2-D504N knock-in mouse on a C57BL/6J background was generated in conjunction with ingenious Targeting Laboratory, Inc. (Ronkonkoma, NY). Briefly, a targeting vector containing a left arm homology domain, partial EAAT2 sequence with the point mutation, a neo cassette between FRT sites, and a short right arm homology domain was transfected into C57BL/6NTac (Taconic) embryonic stem cells. Transfected cells were selected with G418 antibiotic and microinjected into Balb/c blastocysts. Resulting chimeras with a primarily black coat color were mated to FLP mice (B6.Cg-Tg(ACTFLPe)9205Dym/J, Jackson stock #005703) to remove the Neo cassette. Mice were then bred in house to remove the FLP gene. Removal of the Neo cassette, FLP transgene, and presence of the point mutation were confirmed by PCR and sequencing (using primers: CTT GCT GGT TCT AGC AGC ACT CTG and GAA AGT ATA GGA ACT TCG CGA CAC GGA C). EAAT2 mutation status in each mouse was determined by PCR (primers: GAC CAT CTC ACT CTG CAT CCA G and GGA AGA CAG CCA ATT AAA CTT TTA TAT GAGC), where EAAT2-D504 mice had a slightly longer sequence due to the presence of a remaining FRT site.\nMice homozygous for wild-type EAAT2 are denoted as EAAT2\nWT/WT\n, mice homozygous for\nc\naspase-3-\nr\nesistant EAAT2 (two copies of EAAT2-D504N) are denoted as EAAT2\nCR/CR\n, and heterozygous mice are denoted as EAAT2\nWT/CR\n. Male EAAT2\nWT/CR\nmice carrying the SOD1-G93A mutation were bred with female heterozygous EAAT2\nWT/CR\nmice to generate SOD1-G93A mice and non-ALS mice with EAAT2\nWT/WT\n, EAAT2\nWT/CR\nor EAAT2\nCR/CR\n. To avoid confounders from substrain differences, a colony was derived from SOD1-G93A mice were crossed with an EAAT2-D504N founder. Closely related pups were used for all experiments (littermates were not feasible as only one out of eight pups were homozygous for EAAT2-WT or -D504N with or without SOD1-G93A).\nThe behavior of non-ALS mice with EAAT2\nWT/CR\nor EAAT2\nWT/CR\nwas compared to assess the mutation\u2019s effects in normal mice and identify any potential confounders (N = 5 females and 5 males per group). The behavior and lifespan of SOD1-G93A mice was assessed to determine the effects of the EAAT mutation on disease progression (N = 10 females and 10 males per group, with 11 male EAAT2\nWT/CR\nmice). Mice assessed for behavior and lifespan were weighed and assessed for neurological score at least twice weekly from 8 weeks of age. The lifespan of one mouse was more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean of its group (by gender and genotype), so it was excluded from lifespan and behavioral analysis as an outlier. Forelimb and hindlimb grip strength was measured twice weekly (Columbus Instruments) and mice were tested on an accelerating rotarod (UgoBasile, Varese, Italy) once per week until end stage.\nAll mice were housed in accordance with Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nHEK 293T cells were transfected with EAAT2-WT or EAAT2-D505N using lipofectamine LTE (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Cells were fixed and stained with anti-EAAT2 (custom polyclonal rabbit raised against amino acids 518-556 or commercial polyclonal rabbit raised against C-terminus domain, Millipore #AB1783,) 48 h later, as previously described (\nForan et al., 2011\n).\n\nCaspase-3 cleavage\nCaspase-3 cleavage of mouse hippocampal homogenate was performed as previously described (\nBoston-Howes, 2006\n). Briefly, 1.25 \u03bcg of homogenate was suspended in 50 \u03bcl of caspase-3 cleavage buffer with 1 \u03bcl freshly prepared DTT (20 mM, final concentration) and 200 ng of recombinant active Caspase-3 (cat.# 556472, BD Pharminogen, San Jose, CA). Reactions were incubated for 6 hours and the reaction was stopped by the addition of sample buffer and 10 min of boiling. Caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (0.2 \u03bcg/\u03bcl; BD Bioscience cat.#556485) was added to the reaction.\n\nWestern blots\nSpinal cords were collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at \u221280\u00b0C. Cords were homogenized in 30 volumes of modified radioimmunoprecipitaiton assay (RIPA) buffer with 1% SDS and cOmplete\u2122 Mini Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Sigmal Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) using a Teflon-glass homogenizer at 600 rpm (10 strokes). Homogenates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and then briefly sonicated. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (2,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min). Homogenates were boiled with Laemmli sample buffer for 10 minutes to generate samples at 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl.\nSamples were run on Mini-PROTEAN Precast Gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and transferred at 90 V for 60 min on PVDF membranes. A custom polyclonal rabbit anti-EAAT2 antibody directed towards amino acids 518-536 (ABR518-536) was used at 1:10,000 and a polyclonal rabbit anti-SUMO-1 antibody (#4930, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) was used at 1:250.\n\nCompound Muscle Action Potential (CMAP) recordings\nAfter mice were anesthetized with isofluorane, stimulating needle electrodes were placed in the neck along the phrenic nerve, as described by Li et. al. (K.\nLi et al., 2015\n). A ground needle electrode was placed in the tail, a reference needle electrode was placed subcutaneously in the contralateral abdomen, and a recording surface strip was placed on the costal margin of the hemi-diaphragm, ipsilateral to stimulation. Stimulation pulses of 0.5 ms and up to 6 mV amplitude were injected via the stimulating electrode and the resulting CMAP was recorded using an ADI Powerlab 8/30 stimulator and BioAMP amplifier (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO), followed by computer-assisted data analysis (Scope 3.5.6, ADInstruments). The baseline to peak CMAP amplitude was measured and averaged over at least 10 pulses. Non-ALS mice with EAAT2\nWT/WT\n, EAAT2\nWT/CR\nor EAAT2\nCR/CR\nwere assessed at P90 (N = 16, 8, 14 respectively), P120 (N = 20, 12, 19) and P150 (N = 8, 8, 8) to identify potential confounders. Mice without SOD1-G93A and SOD1-G93A mice with EAAT2\nWT/WT\n, EAAT2\nWT/CR\nor EAAT2\nCR/CR\nwere assessed at P90 (N = 42, 14, 15, 14, respectively), P120 (N = 51, 18, 29, 28) and P150 (N = 34, 10, 14, 17).\n\nMotor neuron counts\nMice were anesthetized with ketamine (120 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg), then transcardially perfused with DPBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS. Spinal cords were dissected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and cryopreserved in 30% sucrose for at least 3 days. The lumbar cords were embedded in optical cutting temperature (OCT) freezing medium and tissues were sectioned at 40 \u03bcm thickness for motor neuron counts. Tissue slices were collected on ColorFrost Plus slides (Fisherbrand) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Before staining, slides were dried on a 30\u00b0C heating block for 20 min. and dipped in ddH\n2\nO to remove TissueTek. Slides were dipped in 70% ethanol for 4 min., twice, then in thionin staining solution for 3 min. Slides were rinsed in deionized water, put in differentiation solution for 2 min., 95% ethanol for 1 min., 100% ethanol for 1 min. twice, and HemoD for 5 min. twice. Coverslips were added with permount. Staining solution was composed of 2.5 g Thionin, 1.5 L deionized water, 2 ml glacial acetic acid, and 7 g sodium acetate. Differentiation solution was composed of 1 L 70% ethanol and 1 ml glacial acetic acid. Two female and 2 male mice per group were assessed.\n\nStatistics\nSPSS Statistics software, version 23 (IBM, Armonk, NY) was used for all statistical analysis. Behavioral analysis, CMAP strength, and motor neuron counts were compared using ANOVA analyses with gender as a covariate, using the LSD post-hoc test. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare development of onset, symptoms, and end-stage, with groups stratified by gender. The Log-Rank post-hoc was used so early and late events would be weighted equally."

    "Methods": "2.1. Antibodies and reagents\nAntibodies used in the study were listed as follow: antibodies of TOM20 (sc-11415), CD3 (sc-20047) and \u03b2-actin (sc-47778) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Myelin basic protein (MBP, SMI-99P) antibody was from Covance. Cell markers for early OPC (Olig2, AB9610), mature OL (CC1, OP80), neuronal NeuN (MAB377) and GFAP (MAB360) for astrocyte were purchased from Millipore. Neurofilament 200 (N4142, sigma) was used for immunostaining of neuronal axons. Antibodies against phospho-Drp1 (Ser616, #3455), phospho-Drp1 (Ser637, #6319), Caspase-3 (#9662), MLKL (#28640), phospho-MLKL (Thr357/Ser358, #14516) and VDAC (#4866) were purchased from Cell Signaling.

HMGB1 (#10829-1-AP) antibody was from Proteintech. 7N-1 (RIP1 inhibitor II) was purchased from Millipore. TNF-\u03b1 was from Peprotech.\n\n2.2. Animals\nC57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Stock No: 000664) and housed at Animal Research Center of Case Western Reserve University. Mice were maintained with a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle (on at 6:00 am, off at 6:00 pm). All animal care and animal experimental procedures were done in compliance with approved animal polices of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.\n\n2.3. Drp1 peptide inhibitor P110\nThe Drp1 peptide inhibitor P110 and control peptide TAT were synthesized by American Peptide Company (now called Bachem Americas Inc., Torrance, CA, USA) (Product # 368000, Lot # 1311151T). As previously described (\nGuo et al., 2013\n;\nQi et al., 2013\n), the peptides are synthesized as one polypeptide with TAT\n47\u201357\ncarrier in the following order: N-terminus\u2013TAT\u2013spacer (Gly-Gly)\u2013cargo (Drp1\n49\u201355\n)\u2013C-terminus. The C-termini of the peptides are modified to C (O)-NH2 using Rink Amide AM resin to increase stability. Peptides are analyzed by analytical reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) and purified by preparative RP-HPLC. The purity of peptides is >90% measured by RP-HPLC Chromatogram. Lyophilized peptides are stored at \u221280 \u00b0C freezer and are dissolved in sterile water before use. P110 has shown efficacy and no toxicity both in vitro and in animal models in vivo (\nFilichia et al., 2016\n;\nGuo et al., 2013\n).\nIn our previous study we have found that P110 treatment in the dosage of 0.5\u20133 mg/kg/day range were effective in a Huntington\u2019s disease mouse model (\nGuo et al., 2013\n), Parkinson\u2019s disease mouse model (\nFilichia et al., 2016\n) and ischemic brain injury in rat (\nGuo et al., 2014\n). We tested the dosages of P110 at 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day in our MS mouse model and found that P110 at 1.0 mg/kg/day provided better protection. Thus, in the current study, mice were i.p. injected with P110 at 1 mg/kg once daily.\n\n2.4. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model\nFor induction of EAE, C57BL6/J female mice at 10-week-old of age were immunized with MOG\n35\u201355\ntogether with complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant emulsion (Hooke Laboratories, MOG\n35\u201355\nEAE Induction kit, EK-2110) according to the manufacturers\u2019 instruction. Using the EAE Induction Kit result in 98% successful disease induction. All EAE-induced animals were monitored daily and randomly divided into four groups: 1) A group of animals with P110 treatment starting at the first induction day of EAE (day 0); 2) A group of animals with P110 treatment started at the before the EAE symptom appearing (day 7) after EAE induction; 3) A group of animals in which peptide P110 was given at the beginning of sickness (score 1, day 11\u201312) after EAE induction; 4) A group of animals treated with vehicle as control animals. For each group, at least 8\u201312 animals/group were used for clinical scoring to determine functional impairment. Subsequently, 3\u20134 independent cohorts of each group were used for immunohistochemistry, biochemical analysis and EM analyses at the end of the P110 treatment.\nFor the treatment groups, all EAE-induced animals were administrated once daily systemic i.p delivery of P110 at a dosage of 1 mg/kg/day at various days of 0, 6, or 11\u201312 after immunization. According to previous studies (\nGuo et al., 2013\n;\nGuo et al., 2014\n), at this dosage, P110 does not show any overt evidence of toxicity to any of the animals. A daily treatment period of 29 days was tested in this study. All EAE induced mice were blinded, monitored closely and video recorded and clinically assessed daily according to the well accepted clinical scoring 0 to 5, by which 0 represents no symptoms; 1 = limp tail; 2 = limp tail and hind limb weakness; 3 = hind limb paralysis; 4 = hind limb paralysis and forelimb weakness; and 5 = moribund.\n\n2.5. Chronic cuprizone-induced demyelination model\nTo induce demyelination in corpus callosum, 8-week of age male C57BL6/J mice were fed with a standard 0.2% cuprizone diet in chow (Harlan Laboratories) for a period of six weeks. The successful cuprizone-induced demyelination rate is 98% of animals in our laboratory. All the cuprizone-induced animals were randomly grouped prior to P110-treatment, no-treatment following 6-week of a cuprizone-chow diet. P110 treated mice were received i.p injection of P110 (1 mg/kg/day) either at the beginning of cuprizone-chow feeding for 6-week treatment or P110 injection following 3-week cuprizone-fed chow and for a period of 3-week P110 treatment. A parallel group of animals with vehicle treatment served as controls. All mice were assessed for motor deficits using Rotarod test in a double-blinded manner in every other three days. The times and traveled distances on rotarod until mice fell off were measured.\n\n2.6. Black Gold myelin staining\nBlack Gold myelin staining was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction (#AG105, Millipore). Briefly, 20 \u03bcm sections were incubated in prewarmed 0.3% Black-Gold II solution at 60 \u00b0C for 12 min. After rinsing, sections were incubated with 1% sodium thiosulfate solution for 3 min at 60 \u00b0C and rinsed, dehydrated in a series of gradated alcohols, air-dried, and mounted in mounting media. Images were captured from matched areas of stained sections using Leica DFC500 fluorescence microscope. To quantify myelin, the extent of demyelination was scored as previous study (\nSteelman et al., 2012\n): demyelination range from 0% to 10% of the total anatomical structure was scored as 0; 11%\u201330% represented a score of 1; 31\u201360% represented a score of 2; 61\u201390% represented a score of 3; and 91\u2013100% of demyelination represented a score of 4.\n\n2.7. Purified OPCs culture and OPC differentiation\nCell culture plates were pre-coated with secondary antibodies IgM (10 \u03bcg/ml) (Millipore, Cat #55460) in 50 mM Tris-HCL and followed primary mouse antibody A2B5. Dissociated cells were incubated in the pre-coated culture dishes for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C and then non-adherent cells were gently removed. OPCs were released by 0.05% Trypsin in DMEM at a purity of approximately 96%. Cells were expanded in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 5 ng/ml NT-3, 10 ng/ml CNTF, 20 ng/ml bFGF and 20 ng/ml PDGF-AA.\nTo induce OPC differentiation cells were switched to media lacking bFGF and PDGF-AA, with the addition of thyroid hormone (T3, sigma, 40 ng/ml). OPCs were allowed to differentiate for 2 and 5 days and labeled with O4\n+\nand MBP antibodies. The percentage of positive O4\n+\nand MBP\n+\ncells were calculated and compared.\n\n2.8. Isolation of mitochondrial-enriched fraction and lysate preparation\nMitochondria were isolated as described in previous studies. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated on ice in lysis buffer (250 mM sucrose, 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail) for 30 min. Cells were scraped and disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 25-gauge and 30-gauge needles, respectively. Mouse brain tissue or spinal cord was minced and homogenized. The homogenates were spun at 800 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, and the resulting supernatants were spun at 10,000 g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. The pellets were washed with lysis buffer and spun at 10,000 g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. The final pellets were suspended in lysis buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 noted as mitochondrial-enriched fractions. Mitochondrial membrane protein voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) was used as a loading control.\n\n2.9. Immunohistochemical staining of frozen sections\nMice were anesthetized with Avertin and perfused with PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde. Dissected brains were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 \u00b0C and equilibrated in 20% sucrose. 20 \u03bcm coronal cryosections were sectioned and pre-treated with Reveal Decloaker Solution (Biocare Medical) for antigen retrieval according to the manufacturer instruction. After blocking, sections were incubated with the primary antibodies and followed by appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa florescence 488 or 594. Sections were counter-stained with DAPI (1:1000, Sigma) and mounted with mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). All Images were taken and analyzed using a Leica DFC500 fluorescence microscope.\n\n2.10. Cell viability measurement\nPurified OPCs/OLs were pre-treated with Drp1 peptide inhibitor P110 for 30 min and then followed by incubation with or without either H\n2\nO\n2\n(200 \u03bcM) or mouse TNF-\u03b1 (20 ng/ml) for 24 h. Cell viability was measured using MTT-based kit (Cat. #11465007001, Roche) according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Cell death was determined by measuring released LDH in the culture medium according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction (#4744926001, Roche).\n\n2.11. HMGB1 release assay\nHMGB1 (high mobility Group B1) protein released from necrotic cells has been considered as classical biochemical hallmarks for necrotic cell death. Cultured medium was collected from P110 pretreated OPC/OL cells following exposure to H\n2\nO\n2\nor TNF-\u03b1. Proteins in the medium were purified and concentrated using Amicon Ultra 0.5 ml centrifugal filters (Millipore). HMGB1 released into cell culture supernatants was evaluated by Western blotting with anti-HMGB1 antibody.\n\n2.12. Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining\nLFB staining was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction (#26681, Electron Microscopy Sciences). 20 \u03bcm coronal sections were immersed in LFB solution at 56 \u00b0C overnight and then washed sequentially with 95% ethanol, distilled water. 0.1% lithium carbonate solution, 70% ethanol and water. The sections were then dehydrated with a series of gradated ethanol, cleaned with Histoclear and mounted. A set of serial sections were stained and analyzed; images (5 to 6 sections/animal) were captured under light microscopy. The demyelinated areas (lack of LFB staining) were measured using Image J software. The percentage of demyelinated areas of spinal cord was calculated.\n\n2.13. Immunoprecipitation\nWhole cell lysates were extracted from purified OPC cells using cell lysate buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor). Equal amounts of soluble protein was immunoprecipitated overnight with indicated antibody overnight at 4 \u00b0C and followed incubation with protein A/G beads for 1 h. Negative controls were used with isotype-matched IgG. Immunoprecipitates were washed and separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with indicated antibodies.\n\n2.14. Western blot analysis\nPurified OPC cells or tissue samples of spinal cord or corpus callosum were homogenized and protein concentration was determined by Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher). Then, equal amounts of protein were applied to 12% or 15% SDS-PAGE gels, and electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked in blocking buffer and probed with indicated primary antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C and followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP. Enhanced chemiluminescence was performed with a West Pico Kit (Thermo Fisher). The density of bands was quantified using ImageJ software (NIH).\n\n2.15. Immunocytochemistry\nOPCs and OLs were immunostained with O4 or MBP (SMI-99P, 1:500, Covance) antibodies and followed by secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgM Alexa 488 or 594 (1:500; Invitrogen). For double labeling, cells were incubated with the second primary antibodies against TOM20 overnight at 4 \u00b0C, followed by secondary antibodies conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 or 594. After fixation, cells were mounted with Vecta Shield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories).\n\n2.16. Tissue preparation for electron microscopy (EM) analysis\nFor ultrastructural analyses of myelination, anesthetized animals were perfused with 2% glutaraldehyde/4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Tissues were post-fixed in 1% OsO\n4\nfor 2 h and spinal cord or brain coronal sections (500 \u03bcm) containing corpus callosum were prepared (Leica, Vibratome), dehydrated, stained with saturated uranyl acetate and embedded in a Poly/Bed812 resin (Polysciences Inc.). The 1 \u03bcm thick sections were cut and stained with toluidine blue and matched area were selected for EM. For ultrastructure analysis, ultrathin sections (0.1 \u03bcm) were cut and visualized using an electron microscope (JEOL100CX). G ratios were calculated from at least 50\u2013100 randomly selected myelinated axons.\n\n2.17. Statistical analysis\nAll data analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.00. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM.\np\n< 0.05 is deemed statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed by two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s\nt\n-tests, one-way or two-way ANOVA with post-hoc analysis by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test or Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test. Quantifications were performed in a blinded fashion. No statistical tests were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those generally employed in the field. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. All experiments were performed at least three times independently."

    "Methods": "The procedures employed in the present study conformed to Drexel University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee,National Institute of Health\u2019s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals(1996), the Health Research Extension Act (1985) and the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (1986). All efforts were made to utilize only the minimum number of animals necessary to produce reliable scientific data, and experiments were designed to minimize any animal distress.\n\nSpecificity of CB1 receptor antibody\nThree male CB1r KO mice and three WT controls mice (9\u201312 weeks old) were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) and perfused transcardially through the ascending aorta with heparinized saline followed with 25 ml of 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB; pH 7.4). Immediately following perfusion/fixation, the brains were removed and postfixed for 30 min. Brains were sectioned in the coronal plane at a setting of 40 \u03bcm using a Vibratome (Technical Product International, St. Louis, MO, USA) through the forebrain and hippocampus, and collected into 0.1 M PB. Sections through the rostrocaudal extent of mPFC and hippocampus were processed for light microscopic detection of CB1 receptor in the mPFC. Tissue sections were incubated in rabbit anti-CB1 receptor at 1:1,000 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.25% Triton X-100 and 0.1M tris buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.6) for 15\u201318 h at room temperature. The following day, tissue sections were rinsed three times in 0.1 M TBS and incubated in biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit (1:400; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 30 min followed by rinses in 0.1 M TBS. Subsequently, a 30-minute incubation of avidin-biotin complex (Vector Laboratories) was done. For all incubations and washes, sections were continuously agitated with a rotary shaker. CB1 receptor was visualized by a 4-minute reaction in 22 mg of 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 \u03bcl of 30% hydrogen peroxide in 100 ml of 0.1 M TBS. Sections were collected, dehydrated and coverslipped with Permount (Sigma-Aldrich) for light microscopic analysis of CB1 receptor immunoreactivity.\n\nIn vitro electrophysiology\nFor electrophysiology experiments, male wild-type (WT) and CB1 receptor KO mice (9\u201312 weeks old) were housed three per cage in a controlled environment (12-hour light schedule, temperature at 20\u00b0C). CB1 receptor KO mice were originally generated on a C57Bl/6 background by Zimmer et al. (\nZimmer et al., 1999\n) at the National Institutes of Health. Heterozygous breeding pairs were generously donated by Dr. Carl Lupica at the National Institutes of Health and were bred and genotyped at Temple University to obtain CB1 receptor KO mice and WT littermates. Food and water were provided\nad libitum\n. The care and use of animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Temple University and were conducted in accordance with the NIH\nGuide for the care and use of laboratory animals\n.\nDrug preparation and administration\nA stock solution of clonidine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was prepared in de-ionized water at a stock concentration of 10 mM and diluted on the day of the experiment to a final concentration in the perfusion bath of 10 \u03bcM.\nElectrophysiology\nMale CB1 receptor KO mice and WT controls (3\u20135 mo.) were euthanized, brains rapidly removed, 250\u03bcm slices were taken containing layer V/VI pyramidal neurons of the infralimbic region of mPFC, which is implicated in conditioning and extinction of fear (Giustifino and Maren, 2015), drug seeking behavior (\nKalivas, 2009\n;\nMoorman et al., 2015\n) and resilience to social stress (\nCooper et al., 2015\n). Whole-cell recordings under current clamp (I = 0pA) conditions were conducted as described previously (\nReyes et al., 2012\n;\nCathel et al., 2014\n). At baseline, membrane potential was recorded and input resistance calculated using the current-voltage relationship. Neuronal excitability was assessed in each cell by recording voltage responses to a series of current pulses (0\u2013160 pA). Membrane potential, input resistance and neuronal excitability were also measured following bath application of the \u03b12-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (10 \u03bcM). Recordings were analyzed and pyramidal cell morphology of recorded cells determined by immunohistochemistry as described previously (\nReyes et al., 2012\n;\nCathel et al., 2014\n).\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0 software. For electrophysiology data, membrane voltage, input resistance and excitability responses to individual current pulses were compared between genotypes by unpaired Student\u2019s\nt\n-test and drug effects on these endpoints compared by paired Student\u2019s\nt\n-test. Significance was set at\nP\n< 0.05.\n\nProtein extraction and Western blot analysis\nFor Western blotting experiments, WT and CB1 receptor KO littermates (9\u201315 weeks old) were housed three per cage in a controlled environment (12-hour light schedule, temperature at 20\u00b0C). The CB1 receptor KO were generated in CD1 mice as previously reported (\nLedent et al., 1999\n). Brain tissue was rapidly removed from each animal on ice. Using a trephine, the mPFC brain region was microdissected from each animal. mPFC was homogenized with a pestle and extracted in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) on ice for 20 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 12 min at 41\u00b0C. Supernatants or protein extracts were diluted with an equal volume of Novex 2\n\u00ae\ntris glycine sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA). Protein concentrations of the undiluted supernatants were quantified using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).\nCell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were separated on 4\u201312% tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels and then electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Membranes were incubated in rabbit antityrosine hydroxylase (1:4,000; Immunostar Inc., Hudson, WI), rabbit anti-\u03b12-adrenoceptor (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) or rabbit anti-\u03b21-adrenoceptor (1:1,000) primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C and then in alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min to probe for the presence of proteins using a Western blotting detection system (Western Breeze Chemiluminescent Kit; Invitrogen). Membranes containing proteins obtained from LC were incubated with mouse anti-TH while membranes containing proteins obtained from the mPFC were incubated with rabbit anti-\u03b12-adrenoceptor or rabbit anti-\u03b21-adrenoceptor. Following incubation in a chemiluminescent substrate (Western Breeze Chemiluminescent Kit), blots were exposed to X-OMAT AR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA) for different lengths of time to optimize exposures. CB1 receptor was readily detected by immunoblotting in rat mPFC extracts, and was visualized as a single band that migrates at approximately 60 kDA whereas \u03b12-adrenoceptor, or \u03b21-adrenoceptor, migrate at approximately 45 kDA and 64 kDA. Blots were incubated in stripping buffer (Restore Stripping Buffer, Pierce) to disrupt previous antibody-antigen interactions and then re-probed with \u03b2-actin (1:5,000, Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) with 1-hour incubation to ensure proper protein loading. The density of each band was quantified using Un-Scan-It blot analysis software (Silk Scientific Inc., Orem, UT, USA). CB1 receptor, \u03b12-adrenoceptors, or \u03b21-adrenoceptors was normalized to \u03b2-actin immunoreactivity on each respective blot. Student\u2019s\nt\n-test was used to analyze the difference in CB1 receptor, \u03b12-adrenoceptors, or \u03b21-adrenoceptors protein expression between WT and CB1 receptor KO mice. Results are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Data on \u03b1\n2A\n-adrenoceptor binding and Western blot data were analyzed using Student\u2019s\nt\n-test.\n\nImmunoelectron microscopy\nFive male hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged wild type \u03b12A-adrenoceptors knock-in mice, six months of age were kindly provided by Dr. Qin Wang of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, Alabama. The HA-\u03b12A line is a gene targeting knock-in line not transgenic line. The HA tag was inserted right after the first ATG of the alpha2A coding sequence (this gene is intronless). Hence, \u03b12A expression is at a level/localization/pattern identical to the endogenous one (same gene structure, under the same transcriptional control) (\nLu et al., 2009\n). These mice were housed two or three to a cage (20\u00b0C, 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle lights on 0700) and were quarantined prior to perfusion. These mice were used for examining the subcellular localization of HA epitope-tagged \u03b12A-adrenoceptor and CB1 receptor. Food and water were freely available. On the day of perfusion these male HA-\u03b12A-adrenoceptor knock-in mice were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) and transcardially through the ascending aorta with heparinized saline followed with 25 ml of 3.75% acrolein (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and formaldehyde in 0.1 M PB; pH 7.4, respectively. Brains were collected and sectioned as described earlier. Sections through the rostrocaudal extent of mPFC were processed for electron microscopic analysis of HA-\u03b12A-adrenoceptor and CB1 receptor. Tissue sections were incubated in mouse anti-HA (Covance, Emeryville, CA, USA) at 1:1,000 and rabbit anti-CB1 receptor at 1:1,000 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1M TBS for 1518 h at room temperature. The following day, tissue sections were rinsed three times in 0.1 M TBS and incubated in biotinylated donkey anti-mouse (1:400; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 30 min followed by rinses in 0.1 M TBS. Subsequently, a 30-minute incubation of avidin-biotin complex (Vector Laboratories) was done. For all incubations and washes, sections were continuously agitated with a rotary shaker. HA-\u03b12A-adrenoceptor was visualized by a 4-minute reaction in 22 mg of 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 \u03bcl of 30% hydrogen peroxide in 100 ml of 0.1 M TBS.\nFollowing rinses in 0.1 M TBS, tissues sections were rinsed with 0.1 M PB and 0.01 M PBS, and were incubated in a 0.2% gelatin-PBS and 0.8% BSA buffer for 10 min. This was followed by incubation in goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugate in <1 nm gold particles (Amersham Bioscience Corp., Piscataway, NJ, USA) at room temperature for 2 hours. Sections were then rinsed in buffer containing the same concentration of gelatin and BSA as above and subsequently rinsed with 0.01 M PBS. Sections were then incubated in 2% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.01 M PBS for 10 min followed by washes in 0.01 M PBS and 0.2 M sodium citrate buffer (pH 7.4). A silver enhancement kit (Amersham Bioscience Corp.) was used for silver intensification of the gold particles. The optimal times for silver enhancement time were determined by empirical observation for each experiment and ranged 7\u20138 min. Following intensification, tissue sections were rinsed in 0.2 M citrate buffer and 0.1 M PB, and incubated in 2% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.1 M PB for 1 h, washed in 0.1 M PB, dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol followed by propylene oxide and flat embedded in Epon 812. Thin sections of approximately 50\u2013100 nm in thickness were cut with a diamond knife (Diatome-US, Fort Washington, PA, USA) using a Leica Ultracut (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Sections were collected on copper mesh grids and counterstained stained with 5% uranyl acetate followed by Reynold\u2019s lead citrate. Captured images of selected sections were compared with captured light microscopic images of the block face before sectioning. Sections were examined with a Morgagni transmission electron microscope (Fei Company, Hillsboro,OR, USA) and digital images were captured using the AMT advantage HR/HR-B CCD camera system (Advance Microscopy Techniques Corp., Danvers, MA, USA). Figures were assembled and adjusted for brightness and contrast in Adobe Photoshop.\nIdentification of gold-silver labeling in profiles\nSelective gold-silver labeled profiles were identified by the presence, in single thin sections, of at least two gold particles within a cellular compartment. As were previously reported (\nReyes et al., 2006\n), spurious silver grains can contribute to false positive labeling and can be detected on blood vessels, myelin or nuclei. Considering that a minimal spurious labeling was identified, we have set the criteria that a process is immunolabeled if two immunogold-silver particles were present. Thus, a profile containing only one gold particle in adjacent thin sections was designated as lacking detectable immunoreactivity. Whenever possible, the more lightly labeled axonal labeling for HA-\u03b12A-adrenoceptors was confirmed by detection in at least two serial sections. As observed in low magnification electron micrographs, background labeling in the neuropil, deemed spurious, was not commonly encountered.\n\nData analysis for electron microscopy\nTissue sections were taken from four male HA epitope-tagged wild type \u03b12A-adrenoceptor knock-in mice with the best immunocytochemical labeling and preservation of ultrastructural morphology. These tissue sections were used in the analysis and the information is presented in\nTable 1\n. At least three Vibratome sections were examined per mouse. Vibratome sections were selected from non-adjacent 40-\u03bcm-thick tissue sections. At least 8 grids containing containing four to eight ultrathin sections were collected from the surface of individual Vibratome sections. For quantification of labeled profiles in 40 \u03bcm-thick sections immunolabeled before embedding for electron microscopy, we have observed that the collection of sections only from the surface of the section minimizes artifacts that may be associated with incomplete penetration of antisera. The analysis of tissue sections collected at the plastic-tissue interface ensured that both markers were detectable in all sections used for analysis (\nChan et al., 1990\n).\nTable 1.\nExperiments conducted for the semi-quantitative analysis.\nMouse number\nNumber of Vibratome tissue sections analyzed\nNumber of grids analyzed per Vibratome tissue section\nMouse 1\nThree\n8\nMouse 2\nThree\n8\nMouse 6\nThree\n8\nMouse 7\nThree\n8\nOpen in a new tab\nThe classification of identified cellular elements was based on the method of Peters et al. (\nPeters et al., 1991\n). Neuronal perikarya were distinguished from proximal dendrites by the presence of a nucleus. Dendrites usually contained endoplasmic reticulum and were postsynaptic to axon terminals. They were defined as proximal if their size was larger than 0.7 \u03bcm in diameter. Axon terminals contained synaptic vesicles and were at least 0.3 \u03bcm in diameter. A varicosity was considered as synaptic when it showed a junctional complex, a restricted zone of apposed parallel membranes with slight enlargement of the intercellular space, and/or associated postsynaptic thickening. Asymmetric synapses were identified by thick postsynaptic densities (Gray\u2019 type I), whereas symmetric synapses had thin densities (Gray\u2019 type II). The terms \u2018contact\u2019 or \u2018apposition\u2019 were also used to denote close parallel membrane associations of axon terminals with perikarya and/or dendrites, which lacked recognizable specializations, but were otherwise not separated by glial processes.\n\nDrug preparation and administration\nWIN 55,212-2, a synthetic cannabinoid agonist, (Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in 0.9% sodium chloride solution at a concentration of 3 mg/ml. Experimental and control rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 0.1 ml/100 g body weight of either WIN 55,212-2 or DMSO, respectively.\nRats were randomly divided into three groups at the beginning of the study. For the acute group, animals were administered WIN 55,212-2 at 3.0 mg/kg once. For the chronic group, animals were administered WIN 55,212-2 at 3.0 mg/kg once daily for seven days. Another group consisted of animals that were administered WIN 55,212-2 for seven days and were subsequently abstinent from WIN 55,212-2 for seven days. For each group examined, the control animals received a solution of DMSO solution i.p. at 0.1 ml/100 g body weight. Thirty minutes following the last WIN 55,212-2 injection, rats were briefly exposed to isoflurane (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL; 0.5\u20131.0%, in air) and euthanized by decapitation. Brains were removed for subsequent \u03b12A-AR mRNA expression and binding analysis.\n\u03b1\n2\n-adrenoceptor binding\n3\nH-RX821002 (55.0 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) was used to quantitate \u03b1\n2\n-adrenoceptor binding sites in mPFC. 3H-RX821002 binding was performed as previously described (\nSzot et al., 2006\n,\nSzot et al., 2010\n). Briefly, slides were thawed, and then 600 \u03bcl/slide of incubation buffer (~2 nM\n3\nH-RX 821002 in 50 mM NaPO\n4\nbuffer, pH 7.4) was placed over the tissue. Non-specific binding was defined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM rauwolscine. Slides were incubated for 45 min at room temperature and then washed for 2 min in ice-cold 50 mM NaPO4 buffer, pH 7.4, dipped in ice-cold distilled water and dried rapidly under a stream of cool air. Slides were apposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co., Horsham, PA) for 2 months. Films were developed by standard procedures (\nSzot et al., 1997\n,\nSzot et al., 2007\n). 3H-RX821002 binding sites were quantitated as optical density (OD) using MCID system (InterFocus Imaging Ltd., Cambridge, England)."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals and lesioning protocol\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany), weighing 150\u00a0g, were used in this study. Experiments were performed in agreement with the European Communities Council (86/609/EEC) and approved by the Stockholm North Ethical Committee (Ethical permit # N245/11). Animals were arranged in two experimental cohorts. Both cohorts included rats lesioned with 6-OHDA application in the MFB. These 6-OHDA-lesioned rats were compared with naive control rats (experimental cohort 1) or sham-lesioned rats (experimental cohort 2 and ex-vivo experiment). To protect noradrenergic neurons, rats were systemically treated (i.p.) with a mixture of 25\u00a0mg/kg desipramine (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Saint-Louis, Missouri, USA) and 5\u00a0mg/kg pargyline (Sigma\u2013Aldrich). They were then anesthetized with 80\u00a0mg/kg ketamine (i.p.; Pfizer, New-York, USA) and 5\u00a0mg/kg xylazine (i.p.; Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) and mounted in a stereotactic frame. A hole in the skull was drilled and 12.5\u00a0\u03bcg of 6-OHDA in 2.5\u00a0\u03bcL of 0.01% ascorbate (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) (6-OHDA groups) or 2.5\u00a0\u03bcL of 0.01% ascorbate (sham groups) was injected into the MFB of the right hemisphere (AP, \u2212\u00a02.8\u00a0mm; ML, \u2212\u00a02.0\u00a0mm; and DV, \u2212\u00a09.0\u00a0mm relative to bregma) (\nPaxinos and Watson, 1998\n). The skin incision was sutured and post-operative pain relief was given using 0.01\u00a0mg/kg injections of Temgesic (s.c.; Indivior UK Limited, Slough, UK) directly after the surgery and twice more within 48\u00a0h. Two weeks after unilateral 6-OHDA lesioning, rats were administered 1\u00a0mg/kg of the dopamine D1/D2 receptor agonist apomorphine (i.p.; Sigma\u2013Aldrich) and observed for 30\u00a0min. Since 6-OHDA-lesioning results in supersensitization of dopamine receptors, a contralateral rotational response can be quantitated in successfully dopamine denervated animals (\nUngerstedt, 1971\n,\nJorge et al., 1975\n). Only rats rotating >\u00a0100 turns contralateral to the lesioned hemisphere during these 30\u00a0min were included in further experiments. MRI scanning was performed four weeks after the 6-OHDA lesioning.\n\n2.2. Ex vivo dw-MRI experiment\n2.2.1. Animals and tissue preparation\nEight rats were lesioned (four 6-OHDA-lesioned and four sham-lesioned) using the aforementioned protocol. Four weeks after the surgery, the rats were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde to fixate their brains. They were then decapitated and their heads placed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 24\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C before being washed and subsequently stored in a phosphate buffer solution at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Several hours before the MRI scan, the skin and muscular tissues surrounding the skull were removed so that the heads were tightly fitted in 30\u00a0mL syringes (Terumo Europe N.V., Leuven, Belgium) filled with Fomblin (Solvay Solexis, Neder-Over-Hembeek, Belgium). Particular attention was paid in extracting air from the syringe and from tissues to reduce risks of magnetic susceptibility artifacts in the MRI scans. Samples were at room temperature during scanning.\n2.2.2. Data acquisition\nData were acquired in a 9.4 Tesla horizontal scanner (Agilent, Yarnton, UK) equipped with a 31\u00a0cm wide bore size. A volume coil of the millipede design with a 30\u00a0mm inner diameter (Varian, Yarnton, UK) and a gradient system capable of 1000\u00a0mT/m (Varian) thermostated to 20\u00a0\u00b0C was used. Heads were placed horizontally in the scanner and shimming of the static magnetic field was performed manually. A diffusion-weighted spin-echo sequence was used to acquire diffusion images for a total scan time of 40\u00a0h (Jones 30 kernel (30 diffusion weighted direction and one non-diffusion weighted scan), b-value\u00a0=\u00a01250\u00a0s/mm\n2\n, 100 slices in coronal orientation, 150\u00a0\u03bcm thick slices, no gap, field of view (FOV) equal to 38,4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a028,8\u00a0mm for a matrix size of 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0192\u00a0voxels resulting in a 150\u00a0\u03bcm isotropic resolution and 6 averages). The parameters chosen for the dw-MRI scan were based on a compromise between a sufficient b-value, a high enough spatial resolution, the number of directions and the scanning time (\nDyrby et al., 2011\n).\n2.2.3. DTI data processing\nb\n0\n-maps obtained using dw-MRI were skull-striped in two steps. They were first stripped semi-automatically using the Brain Surface Extractor tool of BrainSuite version 14b1 (\nbrainsuite.org\n). The masks obtained were then manually corrected using ITK-SNAP 3.2 (\nwww.itksnap.org\n) (\nYushkevich et al., 2006\n). DTI reconstruction was then performed on all diffusion datasets using DSI Studio (February 8th 2015 build,\nhttp://dsi-studio.labsolver.org\n) before being normalized in three steps. The datasets were first normalized using SPM8's normalize function (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University of London, UK,\nhttp://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/\n), which operates as a toolbox for MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA), using FA maps as source images. The normalized b\n0\n-maps were then used as source images for a second step of normalization. The skull-stripped masks were used as weighing images in both cases. Datasets then followed a third step of normalization using SPM8\u2019s DARTEL and performed using normalized FA and mean diffusivity maps obtained from the second normalization step. This normalization procedure was performed to enable the two first steps to give the best possible fit of both white matter and gray matter structures for DARTEL to converge to a solution. Datasets were carefully examined to identify any misalignment between datasets over the caudate putamen (CPu), substantia nigra and sensorimotor cortex as well as the internal and external capsules.\n2.2.4. Region of interest (ROI)-wise and SPM analyses of DTI results\nSubstantia nigra of both the intact and 6-OHDA-lesioned hemispheres were delineated on normalized datasets obtained using ITK-SNAP 3.2. Mean and standard deviation over the ROI were extracted for each individual subject for FA values. Two-sample\nt\n-tests were performed on the obtained mean values. A two-sample\nt\n-test was also performed on normalized FA, axial, and radial diffusivity maps using the second-level analysis tool of SPM8 to extract significant changes in DTI metrics in a voxel-wise fashion.\n2.2.5. Creation of a template for q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction (QSDR)\nA Generalized Q-ball Imaging (GQI) reconstruction was performed on diffusion datasets using DSI Studio (\nYeh et al., 2010\n). The resulting maps were normalized as described above. An average Quantitative Anisotropy map was calculated from the 8 datasets generated in this study as well as 13 additional datasets from another unpublished study, in which the animals underwent the same scanning and analysis procedures. The image was scaled to indicate a voxel size of 1\u00a0mm, rotated and cropped to match the matrix size and orientation of the human template (x: left-right, y: anterior-posterior, z: inferior-superior) provided with DSI Studio.\n2.2.6. QSDR and connectrometry analysis\nThe datasets from each animal were scaled to indicate a resolution of 1\u00a0mm instead of 150\u00a0\u03bcm. The diffusion data were then reconstructed with QSDR (\nYeh and Tseng, 2011\n) using DSI Studio (May 5th 2016 build) with a diffusion sampling length ratio of 1.25. The output resolution for the reconstructed datasets was 1\u00a0mm.\ndw-MRI connectometry (\nYeh et al., 2016\n) was conducted to compare the isotropic value of the diffusion orientation density function (iso), a measure of isotropic diffusion, between the two groups. The group difference was quantified using a percentage measurement (i.e. 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(d1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0d2)\u00a0/\u00a0(d1\u00a0+\u00a0d2)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0%), where d1 and d2 are the group averages of iso. A threshold of 40% difference was used to select fiber directions with substantial difference in iso. A deterministic fiber tracking algorithm (\nYeh et al., 2013\n) was conducted to connect these fiber directions in whole brain regions. Tracks with greater length than 35\u00a0mm were collected (corresponding to tracks longer than 5.25\u00a0mm before dataset rescaling). The seeding density was 20 seeds per mm\n3\n(meaning 20 seeds per voxel) over the whole brain. To estimate the false discovery rate, a total of 1000 randomized permutations were applied to the group label to obtain the null distribution of the track length.\n\n2.3. Functional MRI experiments\n2.3.1. Resting-state fMRI acquisition\nMRI measurements were performed in the aforementioned MRI scanner. Animals were imaged using a bird cage 72\u00a0mm coil (Rapid biomedical GmbH, W\u00fcrzburg-Rimpar, Germany) as transmitter and a \u201crat head\u201d phased array surface coil (Rapid biomedical GmbH) as receiver in a gradient system with 120\u00a0mm inner diameter and a maximum strength of 600 mT/m. Rats were induced to sleep with 3% isoflurane in an oxygen:air mixture of 3:7 and placed prone in a MR-compatible stereotactic holder with tooth and ear bars to fixate the head. A two meter long catheter was placed subcutaneously on the back of the animal and connected to an infusion pump (PHD 2000 Syringe, Harvard Apparatus, Inc., Massachusetts) for subsequent infusion of medetomidine. The core body temperature was kept at 37\u00a0\u00b0C using a warm air flow and monitored via a rectal temperature sensor. The temperature, respiration rate and pulse were followed using a monitoring device (SA Instruments, Stony Brook, NY, USA). Animals were then transferred into the scanner and isoflurane was reduced to 1.5% of the gas mixture.\nUpon a stabilized physiological state, a bolus of 0.05\u00a0mg/kg medetomidine (s.c.; Domitor, Pfizer), an \u03b12 adrenergic agonist with sedative and analgesic properties, was injected using the pump and the catheter. In the experimental cohort 1, isoflurane was interrupted when pulse and respiration rate dropped, due to medetomidine (about 5\u00a0min after bolus). A continuous infusion of medetomidine (0.1\u00a0mg/kg/h) was started 15\u00a0min after the bolus injection. In experimental cohort 2, isoflurane was reduced to 0.25% of the gas mixture instead of being interrupted, allowing the physiological state of the animal to be more stable (\nLu et al., 2012\n). Scout images were acquired using a 3D gradient echo sequence for slice planning. A single-shot gradient echo-planar imaging sequence was used for functional imaging, acquired coronally with a readout direction along the rostral-caudal axis. All parameters were the same for the two experiments but the echo time was 9.32\u00a0ms in experimental cohort 1 and 15\u00a0ms in experimental cohort 2. The other parameters were as follows: 18 slices, FOV of 32.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a032.5\u00a0mm\n2\n, matrix size 50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050\u00a0voxels, slice thickness 0.65\u00a0mm, repetition time 1000\u00a0ms and 300 repetitions, triple reference and 8 dummy scans for a total acquisition time of 5\u00a0min and 12\u00a0s. Thus, datasets obtained had an isotropic resolution of 0.65\u00a0mm. The functional images were acquired about one and a half hour after the medetomidine bolus as recommended by\nLu et al. (2012)\n. In experimental cohort 2, following the first functional scan, animals were taken out of the scanner, intraperitoneally injected with L-DOPA (10\u00a0mg/kg)/benserazide (7.5\u00a0mg/kg) and reinserted in the scanner. A second functional scan was then acquired 30\u00a0min after the L-DOPA injection. Subsequent to the imaging procedure, rats received an injection of 0.1\u00a0mg/kg atipamizole (s.c.; Antisedan, Pfizer), an \u03b12 adrenergic antagonist, to reverse the effects of medetomidine.\n2.3.2. Pre-processing of fMRI data\nAll fMRI datasets were preprocessed using SPM8. Time series of images were realigned, normalized and smoothed as detailed below. The realignment step adjusted the images so that the brain is in the same position in every image, thus correcting virtually any motion. A mean image was calculated in this step, which was skull-stripped using ITK SNAP v.2.4 (\nhttp://www.itksnap.org\n). To account for inter-subject differences in size, shape and orientation, individual brains were spatially transformed into a standardized template which consisted of a mean image from an arbitrarily chosen control subject from experimental cohort 1. In this step, realigned images were normalized using mean images obtained during the realignment step as the source image and a mask generated from the skull-stripping as the source weighing images. Data were smoothed using a Gaussian filter with a full-width-at-half-maximum of 1\u00a0mm. BOLD signal has a low frequency of 0.01 to 0.1\u00a0Hz, therefore the data were band-pass filtered to eliminate lower and higher frequency hence suppressing potential physiological interferences and system drift using the time filter tool from the REST toolbox (\nhttp://restfmri.net\n) (\nSong et al., 2011\n).\n2.3.3. Data processing\nVoxel-wise correlation analysis was performed on time-filtered datasets using the REST toolbox (\nSong et al., 2011\n). Several ROI were defined as seeds in the CPu, the motor and the somatosensory cortices of both hemispheres. The correlation between the signal from each of these seeds and the signal from all voxels within the brain was then calculated resulting in maps of correlation coefficients. To fulfill the normality requirement of the\nt\n-tests, Fisher transformation was performed on the correlation value maps obtained, allowing statistical analysis to be performed using SPM.\n2.3.4. Statistical analysis\nOne sample two-tailed\nt\n-tests were used to characterize the functional networks relative to each of the seeds which were consistent within the groups, while two-sample\nt\n-tests were used to identify functional networks differences between the two groups of animals, 6-OHDA versus control or 6-OHDA versus sham for experiments 1 and 2, respectively (cf.\nTable 1\n). A paired\nt\n-test was used to identify functional changes in the data after L-DOPA injections compared to baseline. All these tests were applied on Fisher transformed correlation coefficient maps, as these datasets are normally distributed, using SPM8's second level analysis tool.\nTable 1.\nStatistical tests performed on the datasets obtained with resting-state functional MRI.\nExperiment 1\nOne sample\nt\n-tests\nGroup tested\np\n-Value threshold\n6-OHDA\n0,01\nControl\n0,01\nTwo sample\nt\n-tests\nGroup 1\nGroup 2\np\n-Value threshold\n6-OHDA\nControl\n0,05\nExperiment 2\nOne sample\nt\n-tests\nGroup tested\np\n-Value threshold\n6-OHDA drug naive\n0,01\n6-OHDA acute treated\n0,01\nSham drug naive\n0,01\nTwo sample\nt\n-tests\nGroup 1\nGroup 2\np\n-Value threshold\n6-OHDA drug naive\nSham drug naive\n0,05\nPaired\nt\n-tests\nGroup 1\nGroup 2\np\n-Value threshold\n6-OHDA acute treated\n6-OHDA drug naive\n0,05\nOpen in a new tab\n\n2.4. Autoradiography of the dopamine transporter (DAT) to assess dopamine denervation\nAfter all the functional MRI scans were performed, animals were killed using CO\n2\nand then decapitated, their brain dissected out and fresh frozen in isopentane chilled in dry ice. The brains were then sectioned (14\u00a0\u03bcm) with a cryostat. Slide mounted sections were preincubated in 50\u00a0mM Tris-HCl/120\u00a0mM NaCl (pH\u00a07.5) for 20\u00a0min. Incubation in binding buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl/120\u00a0mM NaCl, pH\u00a07.5/1\u00a0\u03bcM fluoxetine) was conducted with 50\u00a0pM [\n125\nI] RTI-55 (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, USA) for 60\u00a0min. For nonspecific binding, 100\u00a0\u03bcM nomifensine (Sigma Aldrich) was added to the assay. The slides were washed 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0s in ice-cold binding buffer, rapidly dipped in deionized water, dried, and exposed to autoradiographic films (BioMax MR, Merck Eurolab, Sweden) at \u2212\u00a020\u00a0\u00b0C for 7\u00a0days. The films were then developed (using Kodak D19 and Kodak Unifix; Kodak, Rochester, New York, USA). Autoradiograms were digitized using a Dia-Scanner (Epson Perfection 4870 PHOTO; Seiko Epson Corporation, Suwa, Japan), and optical density values were measured using Scion Image for Windows (version alfa 4.0.3.2; Scion Corporation).\n\n2.5. Detection of\nc-fos\nmRNA by in situ hybridization\nIn a separate experiment, a cohort of animals were 6-OHDA- (\nn\n=\u00a05) or sham-lesioned (\nn\n=\u00a05). Four additional 6-OHDA-lesioned animals were also treated with L-DOPA (10\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.)/benserazide (7.5\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) 30\u00a0min before being killed. Their brains were rapidly dissected out, snap-frozen with isopentane chilled in dry ice and cut into 14\u00a0\u03bcm sections with a cryostat. A\n35\nS-labelled anti-sense cRNA probe against\nc-fos\nwas prepared by in vitro transcription from a cDNA clone corresponding to fragments of\nc-fos\n(\nCurran et al., 1987\n). The transcription was performed from 100\u00a0ng of linearized plasmid using\n35\nS-UTP (1000\u00a0Ci/mmol) and SP6 RNA polymerase. In situ hybridization was performed as previously described (\nZhang et al., 2007\n). Briefly, cryostat sections were postfixed in 4% PFA for 5\u00a0min at room temperature, rinsed twice in 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0sodium chloride\u2013sodium citrate buffer (SSC) and placed into 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1\u00a0M triethanolamine/4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0SSC (pH\u00a08) for 10\u00a0min at room temperature. After dehydration in graded alcohols, the sections were hybridized overnight at 55\u00a0\u00b0C with\n35\nS-labelled\nc-fos\nprobe in 50\u00a0\u03bcl of hybridization solution (20\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl/1\u00a0mM EDTA/300\u00a0mM NaCl/50% formamide/10% dextran sulphate/1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Denhardt's/250\u00a0\u03bcg/ml yeast tRNA/100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml salmon sperm DNA/0.1% SDS/0.1% sodium thiosulphate). The slides were washed in 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0SSC (5\u00a0min, four times), RNAse A (20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) (20\u00a0min, at 37\u00a0\u00b0C), 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0SSC (5\u00a0min, twice), 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0SSC(5\u00a0min), 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0SSC (5\u00a0min) at room temperature, and rinsed in 0.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0SSC at 65\u00a0\u00b0C (30\u00a0min, twice) (all washes contained 1\u00a0mM DTT), before being dehydrated in graded alcohols. The slides were then exposed on X-ray films for 4 to 28\u00a0days and analyzed using the NIH Image 1.63 software (\nhttps://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/\n)."

    "Methods": "CIDP patient leukocytes and sural nerve biopsies\nPeripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBMLs) were obtained from whole heparinized blood donated by seven untreated adult patients with clinical, electrophysiological and supportive cerebrospinal fluid or histopathological evidence of CIDP based on the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment criteria. PBMLs were isolated using density gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen using a controlled rate freezing process. This was performed due to donor unpredictability and to ensure experiments were performed concurrently to limit experimental variation. Leukocyte viability was >99% following reconstitution in warmed medium at 37\u00b0C using the 0.4% trypan blue exclusion test. Duration of storage had no significant effect on PBML viability or composition provided experiments were performed within 6 months of preservation, as previously published (\nYosef and Ubogu, 2012\n). Archived frozen sural nerve biopsies from four untreated adult CIDP patients and two normal controls stored in optimum cutting temperature compound at \u221280\u00b0C were obtained from the Shin J. Oh Muscle and Nerve Histopathology Laboratory, Department of Neurology, University of Alabama at Birmingham. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, with an exemption obtained to use archived pathological specimens for research. Written informed consent was obtained from each CIDP patient blood donor.\n\nFlow-dependent human\nin vitro\nblood-nerve barrier trafficking assay\nUntreated CIDP patient PBML trafficking across the human BNB\nin vitro\nwas studied in real time using a flow-dependent leukocyte trafficking assay. A parallel plate flow chamber was attached to basal and cytokine-treated confluent primary human endoneurial endothelial cells (that form the BNB) cultured on rat tail collagen-coated CellBIND\n\u00ae\nPetri dishes, coupled to time-lapse video microscopy as previously described (\nGreathouse et al., 2016\n;\nUbogu, 2013\n;\nYosef and Ubogu, 2012\n). CIDP patient PBMLs were incubated with FNCS1 peptide EILDVPST (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ; 0\u2013100 \u03bcM), a scrambled control peptide DELPQLVTL (designated as FNCS1C, GenScript, 25 \u03bcM: negative control), human IVIg (Carimune\n\u00ae\nnanofiltered, CSL Behring AG, Bern, Switzerland, 5 mg/mL; current CIDP treatment: positive control) and 6-alpha methylprednisolone (6\u03b1MP; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; 200 \u03bcg/mL: current CIDP treatment: positive control) for 10 mins at 37\u00b0C before performing the leukocyte-BNB trafficking assay with the drug in solution. Each experiment lasted 30 minutes. FNCS1 peptide was compared to current CIDP treatments, 6\u03b1MP and human IVIg, to determine equivalence or superiority in modulating leukocyte trafficking at the BNB\nin vitro.\nFNCS1 peptide is being evaluated as a competitive antagonist occupying the critical \u03b1\n4\nintegrin binding site on PBMLs. This is hypothesized to prevent leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cell-expressed FNCS1 during the trafficking cascade (\nMan et al., 2009\n). Leukocytes from healthy controls or patients with other neurological disorders were not used in this study as the aim was to determine comparative drug efficacy in CIDP patients, with each patient serving as his/her own control.\nVideos were generated by merging digital photomicrographs generated by an Axiocam MRc 5 digital camera (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany) using the National Institutes of Health Image J software (field of view 870 \u03bcm long \u00d7 650 \u03bcm wide) or directly using an Eclipse Ci-S Upright epifluorescent microscope with a D5-Qi2 camera (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY) coupled to the Nikon NIS-Elements AR software program (field of view 1420 \u03bcm long \u00d7 950 \u03bcm wide). Automated quantification of firmly adherent and migrated PBMLs was performed following software module validation and concurrence with manual counts. The total number of adherent and migrated PBMLs was counted in three non-adjacent fields and averaged per experiment to account for observed regional variations in leukocyte trafficking. The adhesion/migration index (AMI) was calculated by dividing the mean numbers of adherent/migrated PBMLs for each patient and experimental condition following trafficking after physiological BNB cytokine treatment by numbers obtained from the same patient using the untreated (basal) BNB. The effect of FNCS1 peptide inhibition on CIDP patient PBML trafficking at the BNB\nin vitro\nwas ascertained by comparing the mean AMI to untreated, FNCS1C peptide, IVIg and 6\u03b1MP-treated conditions.\n\nSpontaneous autoimmune peripheral polyneuropathy (SAPP)\nSAPP is a chronic demyelinating neuritis that occurs in female B7-2 (CD86)-deficient non-obese diabetic mice (NOD.129S4-Cd86tm1Shr /JbsJ; initially purchased from the Jackson Laboratory [Bar Harbor, ME]), with features that recapitulate a severe form of progressive CIDP with subsequent secondary axonal loss. Disease onset is at 20 weeks of age with 100% of females reaching maximum severity by 32 weeks old (\nSalomon et al., 2001\n;\nUbogu et al., 2012\n). A continuous colony of these mice has been maintained for over 7 years in the specific pathogen-free Transgenic Mouse Facility (a barrier level 3 facility) at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas with transfer to an equivalent pathogen-free animal facility room located in the Research Services Building, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama. Mice were kept in micro-isolator cages with chow and water provided\nad libitum\n, maintaining a 12 hour light\u2013dark cycle with standard environmental enrichment without restrictions to free movement.\nTo determine the effect of FNCS1 peptide inhibition on chronic demyelinating neuritis\nin vivo\n, 4 independent experiments were performed using a total of fifty 24-week old female, non-pregnant, SAPP-affected mice with discernible involvement for 4 weeks, as ascertained using a published 6-point semiquantitative Neuromuscular Severity Scale (NMSS) score (\nXia et al., 2010a\n;\nYuan et al., 2014\n). The score is as follows: 0: no weakness, 1: tail weakness, 2: mild-to-moderate hind or forelimb weakness, 3: severe hind or forelimb weakness, 4: mild-to-moderate hind and forelimb weakness, 5: severe hind and forelimb weakness. Intermediate scores were given when variable degrees of weakness were observed between limbs. Mice from different cages were evaluated to determine degree of severity and grouped as new littermates with equivalent mean NMSS scores between experimental groups prior to drug administration. Mice with NMSS scores >4 at the onset were not included in this study in order to exclude mice with significant, potentially irreversible early axonal degeneration.\nSAPP mice were treated daily for 5 days via intraperitoneal injection with FNCS1 peptide (2 mg/kg, 12 mice), FNCS1C peptide (2 mg/kg, 12 mice), 400 mg/kg human IVIg or 50 mg/kg 6\u03b1MP (13 mice each). Each experimental mouse was weighed and evaluated for neurobehavioral signs of weakness using the NMSS 3 times a week for 30 days after treatment initiation. FNCS1 peptide was compared to current CIDP treatments, 6\u03b1MP and human IVIg to determine efficacy equivalence or superiority\nin vivo\n, as may be expected in a clinical trial. In another series of experiments, the efficacy of FNCS1 peptide inhibition (2 mg/kg; 3 mice) in SAPP was compared to \u03b1\n4\nintegrin (CD49d, rat anti-mouse IgG1, 5 mg/kg: 4 mice) and VCAM-1 (rat anti-mouse IgG2b, 10 mg/kg: 4 mice) antibody inhibition, with blockade using FNCS1C peptide (2 mg/kg: 3 mice) and mouse IgG2b isotype antibody (10 mg/kg: 3 mice) serving as negative controls. Research studies received approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees, and were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nPeripheral nerve electrophysiology and sciatic nerve procurement\nBilateral dorsal caudal tail nerve (DCTN) and sciatic nerve motor electrophysiology studies were performed on all experimental mice in the prone position under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia on day 30 post-treatment initiation as previously described (\nUbogu et al., 2012\n;\nXia et al., 2010a\n,\nb\n). Distal and proximal compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitudes (in mV), conduction velocity (in m/s) and distal and proximal CMAP total waveform durations (in ms) were measured or deduced for each nerve studied. Following motor nerve electrophysiology, both sciatic nerves were procured from each experimental mouse following euthanasia under general anesthesia and immediately stored at \u221280\u00b0C for future cryostat sectioning or further processed for plastic embedding, as previously published (\nUbogu et al., 2012\n;\nXia et al., 2010a\n;\nYuan et al., 2014\n).\n\nIndirect immunohistochemistry of peripheral nerves\nIndirect fluorescent immunohistochemistry was performed on consecutive 20 \u03bcm thick axial and longitudinal cryostat sections of four adult CIDP and two control human sural nerve biopsies to detect and compare endoneurial microvessel FNCS1 and leukocyte CD49d expression. Sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 20 minutes, washed with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and air-dried prior to blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin. All primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin in 1X PBS. Sections were incubated with 2 \u03bcg/mL mouse anti-human FNCS1 IgM antibody (clone 2Q607, Santa Cruz) at 4\u00b0C overnight, washed and coincubated with goat anti-mouse IgM-Alexa Fluor\n\u00ae\n594 (5 \u03bcg/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and 25 \u03bcg/mL FITC-conjugated Ulex Europaeus Agglutinin I (UEA-1) Lectin [Sigma Aldrich; most sensitive detector of human endothelial cells] (\nYosef et al., 2010\n) for an hour at room temperature in the dark. To detect CD49d+ endoneurial leukocytes, sections were fixed in acetone at \u221220\u00b0C, washed and blocked with 10% normal goat serum as previously described (\nDong et al., 2016\n). Sections were coincubated with mouse anti-human CD45 IgG2a antibody (2 \u03bcg/mL, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and mouse anti-human CD49d IgG1 antibody (10 \u03bcg/mL, Bio-Rad) in 2% normal goat serum in 1X PBS for an hour at room temperature, washed and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG2a-Alexa Flour\n\u00ae\n488 and goat antimouse IgG1-Alexa Flour\n\u00ae\n594 antibodies (both 5 \u03bcg/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the dark for an hour at room temperature.\nIndirect immunohistochemistry was also performed on serial 10 \u03bcm thick axial cryostat sections of six representative mouse sciatic nerves per experimental group to detect CD45 as required to quantify total endoneurial leukocyte infiltration, as well as qualitatively compare demyelination and axonal loss between experimental groups, using published protocols (\nUbogu et al., 2012\n;\nXia et al., 2010a\n;\nYuan et al., 2014\n). Serial sections of the distal sciatic nerve were obtained at 30\u201350 \u03bcm intervals. Sections were fixed in acetone at \u221220\u00b0C, washed and air-dried prior to blocking with 10% normal goat serum in 1X PBS. All primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 2% normal goat serum in 1X PBS. The following primary antibodies were used: Rat anti-mouse CD45 IgG2b antibody (Pan-leukocyte marker, Clone: YW62.3, Bio-Rad: 10 \u03bcg/mL) polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse S100\u03b2 IgG (Schwann cell marker; DAKO North America Inc. Carpinteria, CA: 20 \u03bcg/mL), polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse neurofilament-H IgG (NF-H; axonal marker, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA: 4 \u03bcg/mL). The following secondary antibodies were used: goat anti-rat IgG (H+L)-TXRD (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL: 2 \u03bcg/mL), and goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 and 594 conjugates (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA: 5 \u03bcg/mL).\nAll sections (human and mouse nerves) were stained with 0.45 \u03bcM 4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 minutes to detect nuclei and mounted with ProLong\n\u00ae\nGold antifade mounting medium (Life technologies). Photomicrographs were taken using an Eclipse Ci-S Upright epifluorescent microscope with a D5-Qi2 camera (Nikon). Automated quantification of mouse CD45+ leukocytes per section was performed on merged photomicrographs using the NIS-Elements AR software program (Nikon). A total of 110 sections were quantified (FNCS1 26, FNCS1C 28, IVIg 27 and 6\u03b1MP 29). Data were expressed as number of leukocytes/section to eliminate errors in cross-sectional area that may occur with tissue processing\nex vivo\nand variable increases in endoneurial area that may occur with edema associated with inflammation, and compared between experimental groups.\n\nSciatic nerve morphometric analysis\nThe degree of demyelination (% total demyelinated area per section) in SAPP-affected sciatic nerves was ascertained using glutaraldehyde-fixed, osmium tetroxide post-fixed, epoxy resin embedded, semi-thin sections stained with 1% toluidine blue, as previously published (\nDong et al., 2016\n;\nUbogu et al., 2012\n;\nXia et al., 2010a\n;\nYuan et al., 2014\n). A total of 52 sections of the distal sciatic nerve separated by 40\u2013100 \u03bcm were analyzed (FNCS1 12, FNCS1C 12, IVIg 12, 6\u03b1MP 16). Representative color photomicrographs were subsequently obtained using an Axioskop epifluorescent microscope equipped with an Axiocam MRc 5 digital camera (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany).\n\nStatistical analyses\nInvestigator-blinded data analyses were performed for all parameters evaluated using the GraphPad Prism\n\u00ae\n6 statistical program (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Mann-Whitney U-test or the Wilcoxon-Kruskall\u2019s Rank Sum Test was used to determine statistically significant differences between non-parametric variables while one- or two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s/Welch\u2019s t-test was used for parametric variables based on the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality (including measures of skew and kurtosis). Holm-Sidak\u2019s test was used for multiple parametric variable comparisons. Means are displayed, with variations of the mean depicted as standard errors. Statistical significance is defined as a p-value < 0.05."

    "Methods": "Cells\nmGRPs were derived from mid-gestation (E13) proteolipid protein-green fluorescent protein (PLP-GFP) transgenic mice as previously described (\nPhillips et al., 2012\n) with one modification that the cells were dissected from the fetal forebrain tissue. hGRPs (\nSandrock et al., 2010\n) (\u201cQ cells\u00ae\u201d) were provided by Q Therapeutics, Inc. and used for transplantation immediately upon thawing. mGRPs were cultured in serum-free Dulbeccos\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019sF12 medium supplemented with N2, B27, bovine serum albumin, and basic fibroblast growth factor. Before transplantation, cells were trypsinized, centrifuged and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 100,000 cells/\u03bcl.\n\nCell transplantation\nThe Johns Hopkins institutional animal care and use committee approved this study. GRPs were transplanted bilaterally into the lateral ventricles of cryoanesthetized neonatal\nrag2\n\u2212/\u2212\nshiverer mice of either sex (n=9 for mGRP transplants and n=40 for hGRP transplants) within three days of birth. A total of 200,000 cells were transplanted into each site with 31G Hamilton needle attached to gastight #1701 syringe (Hamilton Reno, NV) at the rate of 2\u03bcl/min. Control animals were subjected to the identical procedure except injection of saline. The pups were then returned to their mother until weaning at 3 weeks. Mice were checked daily for survival recordings. For histopathology, pentobarbital anesthetized mice were sacrificed and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brain and spinal cord tissue was harvested and immersed over night in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C. Age-matched non-transplanted\nrag2\n\u2212/\u2212\nshiverers (n=9) and wild type mice (n=5) of either sex were used as controls.\n\nMRI\nIn vivo\nMRI was performed on a horizontal 11.7 Tesla MR scanner (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA, USA) with a triple-axis gradient (maximum gradient strength = 74 Gauss/cm). During imaging, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1%) together with air and oxygen mixed at 3:1 ratio via a vaporizer and positioned in an animal holder with circulating warm water (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA, USA). Respiration was monitored via a pressure sensor (SAII, Stony Brook, NY, USA) and maintained at 40\u201360 breaths per minute. After imaging, animals recovered within 5 minutes.\nImage acquisition was performed using a quadrature transmit volume coil (70 mm diameter) and a 4-channel mouse brain receive-only phased array coil (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA, USA). Multi-slice T\n2\n-weighted images were acquired using the rapid acquisition with refocused echoes (RARE) sequence with an echo time (TE) of 50 ms, a repetition time (TR) of 3600 ms, 4 signal averages, echo train length of 8, field of view (FOV) of 15 \u00d7 15 mm, 32 slices, and a native resolution of 0.078 \u00d7 0.078 \u00d7 0.50 mm. MT images were acquired using a RARE sequence with a chain of ten 3 ms Gaussian saturation pulses with a power of 12 \u03bcT and an offset frequency of \u22122 kHz from water and the following parameters: TE/TR = 7.5 ms/3000 ms, 8 signal averages, echo train length of 8, the same FOV as the T2-weighted images, and a native resolution of 0.117 \u00d7 0.117 \u00d7 0.500 mm. Images with no saturation pulse (M\n0\n) were also acquired, and MTR maps were calculated using the expression MTR = 1\u2212M\nt\n/M\n0\n. For DTI, a modified three-dimensional (3D) diffusion-weighted gradient and spin echo (DW-GRASE) sequence (\nWu et al., 2013\n) was used with the following parameters: TE/TR = 27.5/600 ms, 2 signal averages, 20 imaging echoes (4 spin echoes distributed along the phase encoding direction and 16 gradient echoes distributed along the slice selection direction) after each excitation with twin navigator echoes in the end for motion and phase corrections, diffusion gradient duration = 5 ms, diffusion time = 12 ms,\nb\n= 3000 s/mm\n2\n, FOV = 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 16 mm, matrix size =128 \u00d7 128 \u00d7 60, and a native imaging resolution = 0.125 \u00d7 0.125 \u00d7 0.267 mm (\nAggarwal et al., 2010\n). Two non-diffusion-weighted and six diffusion-weighted images were acquired. With respiratory gating, the total imaging time was approximately 3 hours.\n\nImage processing\nThe 3D images acquired using the DW-GRASE sequence were reconstructed from raw data in MATLAB (\nwww.mathworks.com\n) with navigator-based motion and phase correction(\nAggarwal et al., 2010\n). Using the log-linear fitting method implemented in DTIStudio (\nhttp://www.mristudio.org\n), diffusion tensor was calculated at each pixel along with the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), primary eigenvector, axial diffusivity (\u03bb\n||\n, the primary eigenvalue), and radial diffusivity (\u03bb\n\u22a5\n, the average of the secondary and tertiary eigenvalues) (\nJiang et al., 2006\n). The six diffusion-weighted images were averaged to generate the isotropic diffusion-weighted (iDW) images. Skull stripping was performed by manually outlining the boundary of the brain in the iDW images using Amira (FEI Visualization Sciences Group,\nhttp://www.vsg3d.com/amira\n) and removing signals from non-brain tissues. The skull-stripped mouse brain images were first rigidly aligned to the\nin vivo\nmouse brain images (referred to as the template image in the following paragraphs) in our MRI based mouse brain atlas (\nWu et al., 2013\n) using the DiffeoMap software (\nChuang et al., 2011\n). The rigidly aligned FA, \u03bb\n||\n, and \u03bb\n\u22a5\nimages from control, shiverer, and transplanted mice were then spatially normalized to the template image using the dual-channel (iDW+FA) large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM)(\nCeritoglu et al., 2009\n). At each voxel, the mean and standard deviation values of FA, \u03bb\n||\n, and \u03bb\n\u22a5\nwere calculated to generate group-averaged FA, \u03bb\n||\n, and \u03bb\n\u22a5\nmaps and standard deviation maps for shiverer control group. For the transplanted animals, a Z score maps with respect to the shiverer control group were computed at each pixel as\nZ\n=\nX\ntransplanted\n-\nX\n\u00af\nref\nS\nD\nref\nwhere\nX\ntransplanted\nis the FA, \u03bb\n||\n, or \u03bb\n\u22a5\nvalue of a transplanted animal at a voxel and\nX\u0304\nref\nand\nSD\nref\nare the mean and standard error of the shiverer control group at the same voxel.\n\nData analysis\nFor spatial profile analysis and region of interest analysis, the midsection of the corpus callosum at bregma 0.38 mm was chosen, as this region was consistently myelinated in all transplanted mice. For correlating MRI parameters to the level of donor-derived myelination, we compared the MR images to histological coronal sections. We selected clusters of 8 voxels in the MR images and matched them to regions in the histological sections corresponding to the appropriate resolution (125 \u00d7 250 \u03bcm regions for comparing to FA and RD, 116 \u00d7 232 \u03bcm regions for comparing to MTR, and 156 \u00d7 312 \u03bcm regions for comparing to T2-weighted images). GFP fluorescence signal intensity was measured to reflect myelination. There was no variability in MRI parameters for the shiverer control group in the region of the brain, allowing us to exclude micro-anatomical differences in the corpus callosum as a confounding factor in our analysis. A full range of regions of interest was selected \u2013 from non-myelinated to heavily myelinated regions. Group average spatial profiles were generated by measuring MRI parameters across the cortical-corpus callosal-subcallosal region in coronal sections at bregma 0.38 mm. T2-weighted signal intensities were normalized in reference to the cortical region.\n\nHistology and immunohistochemistry\nThe left hemispheres were cryopreserved and cut into 30 \u03bcm coronal sections and processed for eriochrome cyanine staining and immunofluorescence. For immunofluorescence, sections were first washed with PBS, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with primary antibodies: anti-myelin basic protein (AbD Serotec, MCA4095) and anti-human specific GFAP and anti-human specific cytoplasmic marker (Stem Cells Inc., STEM123, STEM121 respectively). Sections were rinsed with PBS and incubated with Alexa fluor secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Images were obtained using an inverted microscope (Zeiss, Axio Observer.Z1) equipped with a motorized table. Fluorescent images were analyzed with Zen software for quantification of relative fluorescent intensity.\n\nTEM and g-ratio analysis\nThe right hemispheres were used for TEM and Toluidine blue staining. Brain tissue was sectioned coronally using a microtome. Every other section was collected for immunohistochemistry to confirm successful transplantation in the right hemisphere. Sections collected for toluidine blue and electron microscopy were fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde. Sections for toluidine blue were immersed in a solution of 0.5% toluidine blue in 1 % sodium borate, washed with distilled water, dehydrated with ethanol, and dried on a hot plate at 60\u00b0C. Coronal sections of the corpus callosum were postfixed in OsO\n4\nand embedded in Epon. Thin sections of 70 nm were stained with citrate/uranyl acetate as previously described (\nFarah et al., 2011\n). Images were acquired using a Zeiss Libra transmission electron microscope. Corpus callosum g-ratios were determined from TEM by manually measuring axon diameter and outer myelin layer diameter (axon average diameter/fiber average diameter) using Photoshop. All axons with > three lamellae were quantified (50\u2013100 axons per animal). Calculations for the number of myelinated axons per unit area were adjusted for differences in axon diameter. To assess compaction of exogenous myelin, areas of 17 \u03bcm\n2\nin the corpus callosum were selected. The distance between lamellae was measured by dividing the total myelin thickness by the number of myelin lamellae. An average of four measurements was calculated for each axon.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor the comparison of group average spatial profiles, one-way ANOVA was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software. G-ratio profiles were analyzed using PROC MIXED (SAS 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and the least square means were used for comparison between groups. A value of p<0.01 was considered as statistically significant. Coronal profile graphs are presented as mean \u00b1 SD."

Experiments were performed in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 Home Office regulations and approved by the Home Office and Leicester University Ethical Committee (PIL 80/8158, PPL 60/4351).\n\n2.1. Acoustic over-exposure\nRats were aged P15-P18 at the first day of acoustic over-exposure, which corresponds to the period after hearing onset (\nGeal-Dor et al., 1993\n). Rats were anesthetised with an intraperitoneal injection of fentanyl (0.15\u00a0mg/kg), fluanisone (5\u00a0mg/kg, VetaPharma Ltd) and Hypnovel (2.5\u00a0mg/kg, Roche). Using this combination of anaesthetics, rats were initially anesthetised for about 1\u00a0h, after which animals stayed sedated. Rats were placed in a custom made open field sound-insulated chamber containing a 600\u00a0W High Power Horn Tweeter radiating evenly, frequency range 2\u201320\u00a0kHz (Maplin UK) so that both ears were exposed. Bilateral noise exposure was used as it best approximates the noise exposure that occurs in humans (\nMetidieri et al., 2013\n). A pure tone of 14.8\u00a0kHz was delivered at 110\u00a0dB SPL for a total of 9\u00a0h (3\u00a0h per day over 3 consecutive days) as previously described (\nTagoe et al., 2014\n). Age-matched control animals from the same litter were similarly anesthetized but unexposed to acoustic over-exposure. In vitro auditory brainstem recordings or gap detection screening following the acoustic over-exposure or the anaesthesia only were performed blind.\n\n2.2. Auditory brainstem response recordings\nRats were anesthetised using similar anaesthetics as mentioned above. Auditory brainstem response recordings were performed at three time points: before, 4\u00a0days, and 18\u00a0weeks after anaesthesia only (controls) or after acoustic over-exposure. Positive, negative, and ground electrodes were inserted subcutaneously at the vertex, mastoid, and back, respectively (\nPilati et al., 2012b\n). Auditory brainstem responses were evoked by calibrated tone pips (8, 16, 24, 30\u00a0kHz; 1\u00a0ms rise and fall times, 5\u00a0ms duration, 3\u00a0ms plateau) generated in a free field at 10\u00a0Hz by a waveform generator (TGA 1230 30\u00a0MHz, Tucker Davis Technology, USA) and an acoustic driver (Bruel & Kjaer type 4192, Denmark). Evoked responses were recorded by an amplifier (Medelec Sapphire 2A, Oxford Instruments, UK), band-pass filtered between 10\u00a0Hz and 5\u00a0kHz and averaged from 300 to 400\u00a0Hz sweeps or 800 to 1000 sweeps at threshold using a custom made software (CAP, GSK). Tone pips were progressively attenuated in 10 or 3\u00a0dB SPL steps from an initial intensity of 94\u00a0dB SPL using a digital attenuator (PA4, Tucker Davis Technology, USA). Hearing thresholds were defined as the lowest sound pressure level at which peaks 1 and 2 could be recognized (\nBarker et al., 2012\n,\nPilati et al., 2012a\n,\nTagoe et al., 2014\n). Detection of peaks was confirmed by comparing the auditory brainstem waveform with two or three suprathreshold waveforms. Final determination of threshold was made by reanalysing the traces off-line. Threshold shifts were used as the primary indicator of hearing performance and were measured at the left ear as the difference between the hearing threshold on day 1 (P15\u201318) and the hearing threshold 4\u00a0days after the acoustic over-exposure procedure.\n\n2.3. Behavioural assessment of tinnitus\nThe behavioural assessment of tinnitus is based on the gap detection paradigm originally described by (\nTurner et al., 2006\n). The paradigm is based on the pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex whereby the startle reflex is inhibited by a short silent gap embedded in a continuous background noise.\nTurner et al. (2006)\ndemonstrated selective gap detection deficits in rats following acoustic over-exposure that they hypothesised were due to tinnitus. Gap detection deficits were assessed using a specific acoustic startle reflex hardware and software (Kinder Scientific, Poway, CA). Each rat was presented with a constant 65\u00a0dB SPL background noise consisting of octave based sounds centred at either 8\u00a0kHz, 16\u00a0kHz, 24\u00a0kHz, 30\u00a0kHz or broadband noise (BBN). A 110\u00a0dB SPL, 20\u00a0ms BBN noise burst served as the startle stimulus to induce the acoustic startle reflex. During the background noise, the rat was either presented with the startle stimulus alone (startle only condition) or the startle stimulus preceded by a silent gap embedded within the background noise (GAP condition). Silent gaps (50\u00a0ms in duration with a 0.1-ms rise/fall) began 100\u00a0ms before the startle stimulus. Each testing session began with a 2-minute acclimatisation period to the background sound. This was followed by two trials of startle stimuli to trigger initial startle reflexes that were excluded from the analysis. The testing phase consisted of mixing a pseudo-random sequence of 12 startle only trials (with no silent gaps) with 12 trials containing a silent gap, both embedded in similar background noise preceding the startle stimulus. Startle responses were converted into gap detection ratios (GDRs) whereby for a given frequency, the mean startle response to the gap condition was divided by the mean startle only response. Screening was first performed at P15-P18 where startle response amplitudes were compared in the presence and absence of gaps embedded in broadband noise. This allowed selecting rats displaying an ability to detect gaps prior to the original testing phase. Selected rats were then randomly assigned to either a control or an exposed group and screening was repeated 18\u00a0weeks following acoustic over-exposure or anaesthesia only. Auditory brainstem response recordings were used to confirm recovery from hearing loss 18\u00a0weeks following acoustic over-exposure, ensuring that the effects on gap detection deficits were specific rather than due to hearing loss.\n\n2.4. Magnesium administration\nMagnesium was administered by supplementing normal drinking water with Mg\n2\u00a0+\n-threonate (604\u00a0mg/kg/day corresponding to 50\u00a0mg/kg/day elemental Mg\n2\u00a0+\n(\nAbumaria et al., 2011\n)) on the last day of the acoustic over-exposure for a maximal period of 18\u00a0weeks. The dose has previously been shown to be effective in elevating brain Mg\n2\u00a0+\n(\nSlutsky et al., 2010\n).\n\n2.5. Multisensory input stimulation\nMultisensory inputs to the DCN were stimulated by placing a bipolar stimulating electrode (FHC Inc., USA) in the molecular layer (\nOertel and Young, 2004\n). Field potential and whole cell recordings were performed in the dorsal segment of the fusiform cell layer encoding high frequencies (\nMuniak and Ryugo, 2014\n) as previously described (\nTagoe et al., 2014\n).\n\n2.6. Field potential recordings\nOur study took advantage of field potential recordings to allow stable and prolonged recordings from a large number of undialysed cells in the DCN fusiform cell layer, including fusiform, granule and cartwheel cells (\nOertel and Young, 2004\n). Using field potentials also limited the risk of washing out intracellular substances that could be essential for studying LTP and metaplasticity (\nAbrahamsson et al., 2016\n). This proved beneficial, as we were able to record LTP for at least 60\u00a0min and perform various experimental procedures within that time-window. Coronal brainstem slices (250\u00a0\u03bcm) containing the DCN were obtained from rats 4\u20135\u00a0days after acoustic over-exposure (or anaesthesia only) between P19 and P23, and also 1\u00a0month after acoustic over-exposure between P49 and P54. Dissection of the brainstem and slicing procedures were performed as previously described (\nBarker et al., 2012\n,\nPilati et al., 2012a\n). Field potential recordings were performed in normal extracellular solution containing (in mM): NaCl 125, KCl 2.5, NaH\n2\nPO4 1.2,\nd\n-glucose 10, ascorbic acid 0.5, Na pyruvate 2, myo-inositol 3, NaHCO\n3\n26, CaCl\n2\n2 and MgCl\n2\n0.1. Parallel fiber evoked field potentials recorded in the DCN fusiform layer is a composite of events with nomenclature which has been described previously (\nManis, 1989\n). The amplitude of the N1 or the PSFP (N2) wave was measured as the negative peak amplitude minus the baseline amplitude measured by interpolation. The contributions of pre- and postsynaptic components of the field potentials were determined as described in\nFig. 1\nA and B. Paired pulse facilitation was assessed at a paired pulse interval of 60\u00a0ms. LTP was induced by applying a high frequency stimulation (HFS: 50\u00a0Hz for 30s) (\nGrover and Teyler, 1994\n) and represented as increased PSFP amplitudes normalised to the average PSFP amplitude over the last 5\u00a0min prior to HFS.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nInduction of presynaptic LTP and increased paired pulse facilitation at dorsal cochlear nucleus multisensory synapses. Field potentials were recorded in normal extracellular medium (black) and in test conditions (red) as indicated. Changing the perfusion medium to a zero Ca\n2\u00a0+\nsolution or perfusing NBQX (10\u00a0\u03bcM) blocked the postsynaptic field potential (PSFP, N2) without affecting the presynaptic component of the field potential (N1). Perfusing TTX (1\u00a0\u03bcM) abolished N1 and consequently the PSFP (N2). Stimulation artefacts were deleted for clarity. (B) Bar charts summarizing the effects shown in \u2018A\u2019 on N1 (black) and on the PSFP (N2, grey). N1 was abolished by TTX (n\u00a0=\u00a06, N\u00a0=\u00a05); N2 was abolished by TTX (n\u00a0=\u00a06, N\u00a0=\u00a05), 0\u00a0mM Ca\n2\u00a0+\n(n\u00a0=\u00a07, N\u00a0=\u00a07) and NBQX (n\u00a0=\u00a07, N\u00a0=\u00a06). D-AP5 (25\u00a0\u03bcM) failed to affect either N1 or N2 (n\u00a0=\u00a010, N\u00a0=\u00a08). *P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, ***P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, paired\nt\n-tests. (C) High frequency stimulations (red arrow) induce LTP, increasing the normalised PSFP amplitudes from 1.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16 to 1.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09 (n\u00a0=\u00a07, N\u00a0=\u00a05; Z\u00a0=\u00a03.46, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Wilcoxon). Perfusion of NBQX (10\u00a0\u03bcM) abolished the PSFP (and the LTP). Inset: Sample average traces recorded before high frequency stimulations (thin line) and during LTP (thick line). The dotted horizontal line represents the peak amplitude before high frequency stimulations.

(F) Perfusion 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM NBQX reduces PSFP by 26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08% (n\u00a0=\u00a04, N\u00a0=\u00a03, x\nr\n2\n(2)\u00a0=\u00a08, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02, repeated measures (RM) ANOVA on Ranks, SNK test).

Whole cell patch clamp recordings\nCoronal brainstem slices (180\u00a0\u03bcm) containing the DCN were obtained from Wistar rats (\nBarker et al., 2012\n,\nPilati et al., 2012a\n). Whole cell recordings of fusiform cells were here conducted at 4\u20135\u00a0days after acoustic over-exposure or anaesthesia (i.e. P19\u201323) as reliable recordings could only be obtained from juvenile rats. Fusiform cells were identified on the basis of morphological and electrophysiological properties as previously described (\nPilati et al., 2012b\n). Whole-cell recordings were made with 3\u20135\u00a0M\u03a9 pipettes filled with Cs-chloride based solution containing (in mM): 120 CsCl, 4 NaCl, 4 MgCl\n2\n, 0.001 CaCl\n2\n, 10 Hepes, 2\u00a0Mg-ATP, 0.2 GTP (Tris salt), 10 EGTA and 2 QX-314 (All from Sigma). Whole cell recordings were performed using a Multiclamp 700 A amplifier (Molecular Devices Inc. USA), low-pass filtered at 4\u00a0kHz and digitized at 20\u00a0kHz through a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), using PClamp 9 software (Molecular Devices Inc. USA). Fusiform cells were held at \u2212\u00a070\u00a0mV. Series resistances of <\u00a012\u00a0M\u03a9 were compensated by 70%. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were elicited similarly as above and slices were superfused at 1\u00a0ml/min with oxygenated extracellular medium at ~\u00a033\u00a0\u00b0C. To allow the isolation of AMPA receptor mediated EPSCs, all recordings were performed in the presence of 20\u00a0\u03bcM strychnine and 10\u00a0\u03bcM gabazine to block inhibitory synaptic transmission and 25\u00a0\u03bcM D-(\u2212)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5) to block NMDA receptors. The variance-mean method of quantal analysis was performed by evoking AMPA receptor mediated EPSCs at a sub-maximal stimulation intensity of 0.4\u00a0mA and changing Ca\n2\u00a0+\nconcentrations (0.5\u00a0mM, 1\u00a0mM, 1.25\u00a0mM, 1.5\u00a0mM, 2\u00a0mM, 2.5\u00a0mM and 3\u00a0mM), as previously described (\nTagoe et al., 2014\n).\n\n2.8. Input-output relationships\nInput-output relationships were performed for presynaptic and postsynaptic field potential amplitudes, and for fusiform cell EPSC amplitudes, and were fitted with a Hill function as described in (\nTagoe et al., 2014\n).\n\n2.9. Statistical analysis\nData distributions were tested for normality using D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality tests. Paired or unpaired student\nt\n-tests were used when distributions were normal. Alternatively, when distributions were not normal or when data had been normalised, the Wilcoxon test was used to test for in-group differences whereas the Mann-Whitney test was used to test for differences between groups. A one way ANOVA test or an ANOVA on Ranks test was used when comparing multiple data sets that were normally or not normally distributed respectively. Those tests were run with Dunn's post hoc tests. Repeated Measures ANOVA on Ranks' test was also used with Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) post hoc test to assess for differences between more than two data sets at multiple time points. The linear mixed model was also used to identify significant interactions between time and treatment group for gap detection ratios obtained at 8\u00a0kHz, 16\u00a0kHz and broadband noise (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The linear mixed model was used with a restricted maximum likelihood procedure and a fixed effect test. Prior to using the linear mixed model, the Z-score test was used to identify and remove a single outlier from the data set. Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5 except for the linear mixed model, which was performed using SPSS version 20. Data are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM and considered statistically significant when P\u00a0<\u00a00.05. N and n represent the number of animals and the number of samples (cells) respectively."

    "Methods": "All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Research Committee at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and conducted in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health, Publication No. 86-23, revised 1985).\n\nAnimals and surgical procedures\nFifteen healthy female Long-Evans rats (270\u2013350 gm body weight) were used in this study. The rats were housed individually at a constant room temperature of 25\u00b0C and humidity of 40% and were maintained on a 12:12 hour light: dark cycle. Water was supplied ad libitum and rat chow availability was monitored carefully based on percentage weight gain. The rats were trained to reach and grasp sugar pellets using their preferred paw as described previously (\nWhishaw and Tomie, 1989\n). The 12 rats showing the best reaching and grasping performance underwent two surgeries. In the first surgery (Surgery 1), the rats were implanted with EMG and spinal epidural electrodes. Four weeks later, in a second surgery (Surgery 2), the rats received an incomplete cervical SCI (\nFig. 1\n).\nFigure 1: Experimental design.\nOpen in a new tab\nFifteen rats were trained to reach and grasp sugar pellets with their preferred paw. The 12 rats having the best performance were implanted with stimulating epidural electrodes at spinal cord levels C6 and C8 and recording intramuscular electrodes in several forelimb muscles (Surgery 1). Baseline reaching and grasping performance was determined and spinal motor-evoked potentials (sMEPs) were recorded for 4 weeks post-implantation. Subsequently, all 12 rats received a dorsal funiculi crush at C4 (Surgery 2). In the following 10 weeks post-injury, reaching and grasping performance and sMEPs were tested biweekly. In each testing session, reaching and grasping performance was tested pre-, during, and post-stimulation using four different electrode configurations. Three stimulation frequencies (20, 40, and 60 Hz) were tested on alternate days of each week of testing.\nAll survival surgical procedures were conducted under aseptic conditions. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane gas (1.5 to 2.5%) administered via facemask to effect throughout the surgery. To prevent hypothermia, body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C using a heating pad (TP-500, Gaymar Industries Inc., Orchard Park, NY, USA). Post-surgery, the rats were given lactated ringers (5-6 cc, s.c.) and placed in an incubator maintained at 27\u00b0C until fully recovered. The rats were given an antibiotic (Enrofloxacin, 0.05 mg/kg, s.c.) and an analgesic (Buprenorphine HCl, 0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) twice daily for three days post-surgery. Rodent food pellets, fresh fruit (orange and apple slices), and cereal (fruit loops) were placed in the cage during the first week of recovery.\n\nSurgery I: EMG and epidural electrode implantation\nIntramuscular EMG electrodes were implanted unilaterally to the preferred paw in five forelimb muscles (deltoid, biceps brachii, pronator teres, flexor digitorum, and extensor digitorum) relevant for performing reaching and grasping movements. A skin incision was made along the midline of the skull. The connective tissue and the muscles covering the skull were reflected laterally. The skull was thoroughly dried and stainless steel screws were firmly inserted into the exposed bone. A miniature connector (Omnetics, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was placed between the screws and rigidly affixed to the bone using dental cement. Skin and fascial incisions were made to expose the bellies of the forelimb muscles of interest. Two multi-stranded Teflon-coated stainless steel wires (AS632, Cooner Wire, Chatsworth, CA, USA) connected to the pins of the head-connector were passed subcutaneously to each proximal muscle: deltoid and biceps brachii. Two smaller PFA-insulated multi-stranded stainless steel wires (793200, A-M Systems, Sequim, WA, USA) connected to the same head-connector were similarly passed to each distal muscle: pronator teres, flexor digitorum, and extensor digitorum. The wires were passed into each muscle belly using 27-gauge (proximal muscles) or 30-gauge (distal muscles) needles and a small notch (~0.5-1.0 mm) was made in the wire coating to form an EMG recording electrode. The electrodes then were positioned and the electrode wires were anchored at both ends with 4.0 and 5.0 Ethilon sutures. The EMG wires were coiled near each implant site for stress relief. Stimulation through the head connector was used to verify proper placement of the electrodes.\nFor the cervical epidural electrode implantation, a partial laminectomy was performed at the C6 and T1 vertebral levels to expose the C6 and C8 spinal cord levels. Teflon-coated stainless steel wires (AS632, Cooner Wire, Chatsworth, CA, USA) from the head-connector were passed subcutaneously to the laminectomy sites and then passed under the spinous processes of the remaining vertebrae between the partial laminectomies and above the dura mater. Stimulation electrodes were made by removing a small portion of the Teflon (~1 mm) to expose the stainless steel wire on the surface facing the spinal cord. The electrodes were secured in position by suturing the wire to the dura mater above and below the electrode using 8.0 Ethilon suture. In addition, the Teflon was pulled gently over the cut end of the wires to prevent stimulation through this site. A loop was formed near the site of insertion of the wires to provide stress relief. A common reference (Rf) wire (~1 cm of the Teflon removed at the distal end) was inserted subcutaneously near the shoulder on the dominant paw side. All exposed areas were kept moist with 0.9% saline washes. All incisions were closed using 4.0 Vicryl for the muscle and connective tissue layers and 4.0 Ethilon for the skin.\n\nSurgery II: Cervical spinal cord injury\nA longitudinal midline skin incision was made dorsal to the spinal column and the underlying back muscles were reflected laterally to provide access to the vertebrae overlying the cervical spinal cord segments. Special care was taken to not displace nor damage the previously implanted epidural electrodes. A partial laminectomy was performed at C3-C4 vertebrae to expose the spinal cord and the underlying dura was opened with a longitudinal incision (1-3 mm). To produce an incomplete cervical SCI, the C4 dorsal funiculi were crushed bilaterally by placing the tips of fine forceps 2 mm apart (1 mm on each side of the midline), inserting the tips 2 mm in depth into the spinal cord, and then squeezing the tips together and holding them closed for 20 sec. Histological evaluation of this injury has been reported previously (\nAlam et al., 2015\n). All exposed areas were kept moist with 0.9% saline washes. All incisions were closed using 4.0 Vicryl for the muscle and connective tissue layers and 4.0 Ethilon for the skin.\n\nReaching and grasping training and testing\nThe rats were acclimated to the testing environment prior to all surgeries. Each rat was identified as right- or left-handed (preferred paw) during the standard reaching and grasping task (\nWhishaw and Tomie, 1989\n;\nMcKenna and Whishaw, 1999\n). The rats were placed individually inside a translucent acrylic box (18 cm \u00d7 15 cm \u00d7 31 cm) with a small slit in the front wall (3 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm). A 45 mg banana-flavored sugar pellet (Dustless Precision Pellets, Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ, USA) was placed on a platform 1 cm away from the slit and the rats were trained to reach and grasp the pellet with the preferred paw. During the testing session, a total of 20 pellets were presented to each rat and the ratio of the number of pellets eaten to the total number of attempts was calculated as the success rate. In each reaching and grasping cycle, the animal was positioned facing the front wall window with both forelimb paws on the cage floor. Reaching usually started with activation of the deltoid and/or biceps muscles, i.e., the most proximal forelimb muscles evaluated. The rats were tested pre-injury (baseline testing) and up to 10 weeks post-injury. Video recordings of this task were taken at three different camera angles: front, left, and right at 100 frames/s each using a motion capture system (Simi Reality Motion Systems, Unterschleissheim, Germany). Light blinks to the videos were initiated through manual pulses to assist in the synchronization of the forelimb EMG signals with the video recordings during the reaching and grasping behavior.\n\nSpinal epidural stimulation protocol\nEpidural electrical stimulation was delivered through six electrode combinations, i.e., two bipolar (C6\u2212 C8+ and C6+ C8\u2212) and four monopolar (C6\u2212 Rf+, C6+ Rf\u2212, C8\u2212 Rf+, and C8+ Rf\u2212) configurations. With the rats awake and at rest, stimulation pulses (200 \u03bcsec pulse width) were delivered at 2 Hz at different current intensities using a constant current stimulator (Grass SIU5; Grass Instruments, Warwick, RI, USA) to produce spinal motor-evoked potentials (sMEP) in each implanted forelimb muscle. The signals were filtered (band-pass; 30-1000 Hz) and amplified (1000 \u00d7) using a multichannel analog amplifier (Differential AC amplifier Model 1700, AM-Systems Inc., Sequim, WA, USA). The amplified signals and the stimulation monitor and synchronization pulses were digitized at 10 KHz and stored on a computer using a data acquisition card (NI PCI-6052E, National Instruments Inc., Austin, TX, USA) operated with a custom designed software written in LabVIEW (National Instruments Inc., Austin, TX, USA). The initial appearance of sMEPs was used to determine the stimulation threshold for each stimulation configuration.\nTo determine the effects of epidural spinal cord stimulation on forelimb fine motor control, monophasic stimulation pulses were delivered during the reaching and grasping task at sub-threshold current intensities (60-70% of the previously recorded sMEP threshold current). The experiments were conducted six days per week: the first three days were used to determine the sMEP thresholds and the next three days were used to determine the reaching and grasping scores (see below). Two bipolar (C6\u2212 C8+ and C6+ C8\u2212) and two monopolar (C6\u2212 Rf+ and C8\u2212 Rf+) stimulation configurations were tested in random order between the pre- and poststimulation reaching and grasping tests (without stimulation) as described in\nFigure 1\n. The other two monopolar configurations (C6+ Rf\u2212 and C8+ Rf\u2212) were not used due to their high sMEP threshold currents (\nFig. 2A\n). For each of the stimulation configurations, three stimulation frequencies (20, 40, and 60 Hz) were tested separately on different days. The first three consecutive days of each week were used to determine the sMEP thresholds: current from the different electrode configurations was delivered at increasing intensities at 0.5 Hz until an evoked potential (sMEP) was obtained for any of the muscles tested. This procedure required ~50 pulses for each electrode configuration. On the subsequent three consecutive days of each week reaching and grasping scores were determined at the three stimulation frequencies. On each day the reaching and grasping scores were measured without stimulation (pre-stimulation), with the four stimulation configurations, and then again without stimulation (post-stimulation). The duration of the entire testing session was ~20-25 min for each rat during which the rat was stimulated for ~12-15 min. The data were collected for all pre-, during-, and post-stimulation sessions.\nFigure 2: Cervical electrical stimulation facilitates forelimb reaching and grasping function after a cervical SCI.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Mean (\u00b1SEM) threshold current required for each stimulation electrode configuration to elicit spinal motor evoked potentials (sMEPs) in any of the five forelimb muscles tested pre-injury and at different time points post-injury.

(C) Effects of the stimulation electrode configuration on reaching and grasping performance. Mean (\u00b1SEM) success rates for reaching and grasping with all four electrode configurations were obtained by combining all of the frequencies tested. C6\u2212 C8+ vs. C6\u2212 Rf+ (\n\u2020\np\n< 0.05). C6+ C8\u2212 vs. C6\u2212 Rf+ (\n\u2020\u2020\np\n< 0.05) and C8\u2212 Rf+ (\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\np\n< 0.05). (D) Effects of stimulation frequency on reaching and grasping performance. Mean (\u00b1SEM) success rates for reaching and grasping for all three stimulation frequencies showed no differences when combining all stimulation electrode configurations tested.\n\nData analyses\nTo calculate the reaching and grasping success rate, successful attempts were scored as 1 and unsuccessful attempts as 0. For qualitative assessment (accuracy) of the reaching and grasping task, we used a three point scoring system where 0 = absent, 0.5 = impaired or ambiguity regarding the movement, and 1 = normal (\nWhishaw et al., 2003\n;\nGarc\u00eda-Al\u00edas et al., 2015\n). A total of seven components of the movement were analyzed: limb advance, digit extension, pronation (arpeggio), digit flexion, supination I, supination II, and pellet release. The EMG signals were synchronized to the exact video frame using a custom written program in LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA). This allowed us to determine the exact EMG time points when the rat initially lifted its paw, when it grasped the food pellet, and when the food was delivered to the mouth. The EMG recordings for successful movements at the different time points were rectified and integrated and then used to compare the muscle activation patterns across the time points. The amount of co-activation between the antagonistic flexor digitorum and extensor digitorum muscles was determined using joint probability density distributions (\nde Guzman et al., 1991\n).\nsMEP data were analyzed offline using a custom written program in MATLAB (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). The program allowed detection of distinct raw EMG signals that corresponded to the rat\u2019s active (roaming) and non-active (resting) periods during normal cage activity using an algorithm (\nSolnik et al., 2010\n). sMEPs were analyzed during the non-active periods for all tested forelimb muscles. A single trial of sMEPs was defined as evoked responses during the 30 ms time window after the start of the stimulation pulse. This 30 ms time window then was divided into an early (first 10 ms) and a late (last 20 ms) component. The sMEPs subsequently were rectified and averaged for each component of the time window. The area under the rectified sMEP curves was measured to determine the total muscle activation at each stimulation current intensity and electrode configuration.\n\nStatistics\nRepeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine any overall differences among the success rates for pre-, during-, and post-stimulation comparisons. Individual group differences were determined using the Bonferroni post-hoc test. Differences in pre- vs. post-injury levels of muscle activation for different paired conditions with vs. without stimulation were analyzed using two-tailed paired t-tests. Differences in the success rates for reaching and grasping between pre- vs. post-injury also were determined using two-tailed paired t-test. Differences between groups were considered statistically significant at\np\n< 0.05 (* and \u2020). All statistical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) and SPSS Statistics (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA)."

    "Methods": "2.1. Subjects\nGFAP-Cre; Pten\nloxP:loxP\nmice have been previously described (\nBackman et al., 2001\n;\nLjungberg et al., 2009\n). We bred NS-Pten\nloxP/+\nheterozygote parents to produce NS-Pten\n+/+\nwild-type (WT), NS-Pten\nloxP/+\nheterozygous (HT), and NS-Pten\nloxP/loxP\nknockout (KO) over 10 generations on a FVB-based mixed background strain. The Kv4.2 knockout mice used in this study were generated in a 129S6/SvEv background (\nChen et al., 2006\n). The knockout mice were backcrossed with WT 129S6/SvEv to produce (F10 or greater) littermates that were used in these studies. The Kv4.2 knockout and wildtype animals were from the offspring of heterozygote parents. Mice were generated and housed at Baylor University at 22\u00b0C ambient temperature with 14-h light and 10-h dark (20:00 to 06:00) diurnal cycle. All mice were given\nad libidum\naccess to food and water. All procedures were conducted in compliance with National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the animal protocol was approved by Baylor University Animal Care and Use Committee. For experiments all mice used in experiments were 8 week old males, unless noted otherwise.\n\n2.2. microCT Analysis\nFor microCT analysis, mice were euthanized by rapid decapitation and then stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until later analyzed. Mice were scanned at the proximal and mid diaphysis with a vivaCT40 microCT scanner (Scanco Medical, Switzerland) at 10.5\u03bcm voxel resolution using the following settings: (55 kVp, 145 \u03bcA, 2048 samples, 1000 proj/180\u00b0, 200 ms integration time). Analysis of trabecular parameters in the tibial metaphysis (BV: bone volume, TV: total volume, BV/TV: bone volume/total volume, Tb.N: trabecular number, and Tb.Th: trabecular thickness) and cortical parameters in the tibial midshaft (Ct.Th: cortical thickness, endocortical volume, and TMD: tissue mineral density) were performed as previously described (\nPoliachik et al., 2010\n).\n\n2.3. Open Field\nLocomotor activity was evaluated by use of an open field activity test as previously described.(\nLugo et al., 2014\n) Mice were first allowed to acclimate to the room for 30 min before testing. Mice were then placed in a clear acrylic arena (40 cm \u00d7 40 cm \u00d7 30 cm) and their activity levels were observed over 30 min. Open field activity was collected by a computer-operated optical animal activity system (Fusion by Omnitech Electronics Inc., Columbus, USA). Total activity levels, stereotypy (self-grooming), and rearing behaviors were measured. The testing chamber was cleaned with 30% isopropanol between subjects.\n\n2.4. Kainate-Induced Seizures\nSeizures were induced in NS-Pten\n+/+\nmice with kainic acid (20 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal (IP) injection on postnatal day 60. The presence of behavioral status epilepticus was determined using previously described methods (\nBarnwell et al., 2009\n). At approximately 1 hour following either saline or kainic acid injections all mice received a 20 mg/kg (IP) injection of pentobarbital to terminate seizure activity. A second 10 mg/kg dose was administered to those mice that continued to show behavioral seizure activity 1 hour after the initial pentobarbital injections. All seizures were induced in the mice while they were held in isolation. Seizure activity was monitored through behavioral observations for at least 2 hours following injections. They were then regularly checked on for several more hours, until all mice showed recovery. Following recovery, mice were returned to their home cages with their littermates. Mice that displayed continuous aggression and fighting behaviors, to the point of injury, were separated and singly housed for the duration of testing.\n\n2.5. Statistical Analysis\nAll data were analyzed by using SPSS 21.0 for PC (SPSS, Chicago, IL) or by Graphpad Prism 6 for PC or Mac (San Diego, CA). For all comparisons, the level of significance was set at p < 0.05. We used independent samples, two-tailed t-tests assuming equal variances when comparing two groups."
