    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nExperiments were conducted on adult (3\u20134 months old) male Sprague Dawley rats (Envigo Colony 208; Indianapolis, IN). Rats were housed in pairs and maintained under a 12:12 light:dark cycle. Animals had access to a standard commercial pelleted diet and water ad libitum. All procedures in this manuscript were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Missouri in accordance with National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The University of Missouri is an AAALAC-accredited institution that operates under Animal Welfare Assurance ID A3394\u201301.\n\n2.2. Intrapleural injections\nRats received bilateral intrapleural injections (6 mm deep, fifth intercostal space) using a 50 \u03bcl Hamilton syringe and a custom needle (6 mm, 23 gauge, semi-blunt to prevent lung puncture) while under isoflurane anesthesia (1.5% in 100% oxygen as previously described by\nMantilla et al. (2009)\n. Control rats were intrapleurally injected with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB; 20 \u03bcg dissolved in doubly distilled H\n2\nO; Calbiochem; Billerica, MA) unconjugated to saporin (SAP; 25 \u03bcg dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS); Advanced Targeting Systems; San Diego, CA) to enable comparisons for respiratory plasticity, microglial morphology, and cervical spinal inflammatory-associated marker expression. CTB conjugated to saporin (CTB-SAP; 25 \u03bcg dissolved in PBS; Advanced Targeting Systems; San Diego, CA) was intrapleurally injected to target respiratory motor neurons as described previously (\nNichols et al., 2015\n,\n2018\n;\nBorkowski and Nichols, 2020\n). CTB-SAP treated rats also received an additional 20 \u03bcg of CTB dissolved in double distilled H\n2\nO (Calbiochem; Billerica, MA) in their administered intrapleural injections. Rats were then monitored to ensure respiration was not compromised following intrapleural injections, and were housed for 7 or 28 days before the below surgical preparation and neurophysiological experiments were performed.\n\n2.3. Surgical preparation for in vivo neurophysiological experiments\nExperimental procedures were performed as described previously (e. g.,\nHoffman et al., 2012\n;\nNichols et al., 2018\n). Briefly, rats were isoflurane anesthetized, tracheotomized, and pump ventilated (Small Animal SAR-1000 Ventilator; CWE, Ardmore, PA, USA; tidal volume ~ 2.5 ml, frequency ~ 70\u201380 breaths per minute). Rats remained under iso-flurane anesthesia (3.5% in 50% O\n2\n, balance N\n2\n) throughout surgical procedures before being converted to urethane anesthesia over 15\u201320 min (1.85 g kg\n\u2212 1\n,\ni.v.\n) while isoflurane was slowly withdrawn. Once completely converted to urethane anesthesia, rats were then paralyzed for neuromuscular blockade using pancuronium bromide (2.5 mg kg\n\u2212 1\n, i.v.). Rats were given a 1:2:0.13 mixture of 6% Hetastarch (in 0.9% sodium chloride), lactated Ringer\u2019s solution, and 8.4% sodium bicarbonate via continuous intravenous infusion (1.5\u20136 ml kg\n\u2212 1\nh\n\u2212 1\n) to maintain body fluid and acid-base balance. Lack of the pressor responses or obvious respiratory neural responses to a toe pinch with a hemostat was used to confirm the adequacy of anesthesia before and immediately after surgical and neurophysiological protocols were complete. Body temperature was maintained (37 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) with a custom-made heated surgical table, and was assessed with a rectal thermometer (Physitemp, Clifton, NJ, USA). Throughout the surgical preparation, end-tidal PCO\n2\n(P\nETCO2\n) was maintained at ~45 mmHg and monitored with a flow-through carbon dioxide analyzer designed to sufficiently measure response time for P\nETCO2\nmeasurements in rats (CapStar-100, CWE, Ardmore, PA).\nRats were bilaterally vagotomized and blood pressure was monitored in the right femoral artery by the insertion of a polyethylene catheter (PE50 ID: 0.58 mm, OD: 0.965 mm; Intramedic, MD, USA) connected to a pressure transducer (APT300 Pressure Transducer, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). Arterial blood samples were taken during baseline, the first hypoxic episode, and at 15, 30 and at 60 min post-AIH and analyzed for partial pressures of O\n2\n(PO\n2\n) and CO\n2\n(PCO\n2\n) using a blood gas analyzer (ABL80 Flex, Radiometer, Brea, CA).\nThrough a dorsal approach, the left phrenic nerve was isolated, distally cut, desheathed, and covered with a saline soaked cotton ball until it was placed on a bipolar silver electrode (described in the following section). Since isoflurane dampens phrenic nerve output, a minimum of 1 h was allowed following the conversion to urethane anesthesia before neurophysiological recordings began to eliminate this effect.\n\n2.4. In vivo neurophysiological recordings\nThe left phrenic nerve was submerged in mineral oil and placed on bipolar silver electrodes to record nerve activity. Neural signals were amplified (10,000 \u00d7), band-pass filtered (300\u201310,000 Hz, Model 1800, A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA, USA), full-wave rectified, and integrated (50 ms time constant, MA-821, CWE Inc., Ardmore, PA, USA). Integrated nerve bursts were digitized (8 kHz) and analyzed using a WINDAQ data acquisition system (DATAQ Instruments, Akron, OH, USA). Apneic and recruitment thresholds were determined at least 1-h post urethane anesthesia conversion. First, ventilation was increased and P\nETCO2\nwas reduced until rhythmic nerve bursts had ceased (i.e., apneic threshold). After 1 min of nerve cessation, the ventilator rate was decreased and P\nETCO2\nwas slowly increased until the resumption of rhythmic nerve bursts occurred (i.e., recruitment threshold). To establish baseline conditions, P\nETCO2\nwas held approximately 2 mmHg above the recruitment threshold until stabilization of neural activity had occurred (\u226515 min). A baseline arterial blood sample was taken to document baseline blood gas levels. Following baseline measurements, rats were exposed to three 5-min episodes of isocapnic (\u00b11.5 mmHg) acute intermittent hypoxia [10% inspired O\n2\n, arterial PO\n2\n(PaO\n2\n): 35\u201345 mmHg] separated by 5-min intervals of baseline O\n2\nconditions (50% inspired O\n2\n, PaO\n2\n: \u2265150 mmHg). Rats were returned to baseline inspired O\n2\nlevels after the third bout of hypoxia, and inspired O\n2\nlevels were maintained for the duration of the experiments. Manipulation of inspired CO\n2\nand/or the ventilation rate was done to maintain isocapnic arterial PCO\n2\n(PaCO\n2\n) within \u00b11.5 mmHg of the respective baseline value.\nTo test the hypothesis that COX-1/2 mediated inflammation plays a role in the differential pLTF observed in 7d and 28d CTB-SAP treated rats, rats were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with (\nS\n)-(+)-ketoprofen (keto; 12.5 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or vehicle (veh; 50% ethanol and sterile saline; 100 \u03bcl/kg). 7d control treated groups included two groups that received AIH treatment: 1) keto (\nn\n= 7), and 2) keto veh (\nn\n= 6); and two groups that received no AIH treatment (time controls; TCs): 1) keto TC (\nn\n= 3), and 2) keto veh TC (\nn\n= 4). 28d control treated groups included two groups that received AIH treatment: 1) keto (\nn\n= 7), and 2) keto veh (\nn\n= 5); and two TC groups: 1) keto TC (\nn\n= 4), and 2) keto veh TC (\nn\n= 4). 7d CTB-SAP treated groups included two groups that received AIH treatment: 1) keto (\nn\n= 6), and 2) keto veh (\nn\n= 6); and two TC groups: 1) keto TC (\nn\n= 3), and 2) keto veh TC (\nn\n= 3). 28d CTB-SAP treated groups included two groups that received AIH treatment: 1) keto (\nn\n= 8), and 2) keto veh (\nn\n= 5); and two TC groups: 1) keto TC (\nn\n= 4), and 2) keto veh TC (\nn\n= 3). Since there were no apparent differences in TC groups (no AIH) and multiple previous studies demonstrating minimal experimental drift in time control experiments, all TC treated rats were grouped together per treatment (i.e., keto and keto veh) within control and CTB-SAP rats for statistical analyses. In this way, we were able to assure that keto and the vehicle did not elicit unexpected pMF (i. e. a time-dependent drift in time control experiments), while minimizing animal use consistent with national standards for animal research. Approximately 3 h after keto or keto veh delivery, animals were exposed to either AIH or no AIH (TC), and phrenic nerve activity was recorded for 60 min after AIH or sham AIH.\n\n2.5. Immunohistochemistry\nTissue used for staining was obtained from a separate set of rats than those used for the current neurophysiological studies that did not receive any drug or AIH treatment during neurophysiological experiments. Immediately following neurophysiological protocols, rats were transcardially perfused with cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (0.01 M PBS, pH 7.4). Spinal cords were immediately removed following perfusion, post-fixed (4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M PBS) at 4 \u00b0C overnight, and then cryoprotected in graded sucrose (20% sucrose for 3 days and 30% sucrose for an additional 3 days) at 4 \u00b0C until sinking. The spinal cords were transversely sectioned (40 \u03bcm thick) using a freezing-sliding microtome (Leica SM 2000R, Germany), and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C in an antifreeze solution (30% glycerol, 30% ethylene glycol, 40% PBS). To evaluate microglial morphology in the phrenic motor nucleus of 7d and 28d control and CTB-SAP rats, six sections from C4 were selected for each animal (\nn\n= 8 per group).\nTissue was washed with 1\u00d7 PBS three times for five minutes on a shaker at room temperature. Sections were then incubated at room temperature in a blocker solution (1\u00d7 PBS + 0.2% Triton +5% normal donkey serum) on a shaker for 1 h. Sections were then incubated in primary antibody solution (1\u00d7 PBS + 0.1% Triton +5% normal donkey serum + antibody against CTB (goat, 1:2000, Calbiochem) and Cd11b (mouse 1:500, Bio-Rad)) overnight at 4 \u00b0C on a shaker as conducted previously (\nNichols et al., 2015\n). The following day, tissue was washed three times for 5 min at room temperature on a shaker in 1\u00d7 PBS. The tissue was then incubated for 2 h at room temperature on a shaker in the dark in secondary antibody solution (1\u00d7 PBS + 0.1% Triton +5% normal donkey serum + donkey anti-goat Alexa-Fluor 555 (1:1000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and donkey anti-mouse Alexa-Fluor 488 (1:1000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR)). Tissue was then washed again while covered in 1\u00d7 PBS three times for 5 min on a shaker at room temperature. The tissue was then mounted on positively charged glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and allowed to dry before ProLong\n\u2122\nGold anti-fade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was applied, and a coverslip was put onto the slides. Covered slides were stored at 4 \u00b0C until quantification of microglial morphology was performed.\n\n2.6. Imaging\nPhotomicrographs were taken at the same settings for all images per antibody per group (i.e., gains for images: 555 (CTB) = 744.95, 488 (Cd11b) = 799.11). The photomicrographs were taken using a Leica DM4000 confocal microscope at 20\u00d7 magnification with Leica Application Suite X (LAS X) software to encompass the CTB-labelled phrenic motor neurons in the C4 cervical spinal cord (\nBoulenguez et al., 2007\n;\nMantilla et al., 2009\n;\nNichols et al., 2015\n;\nWatson et al., 2009\n). Images were taken as 8-bit stacks at a resolution of 1024 \u00d7 1024 (366.67 \u03bcm \u00d7 366.67 \u03bcm).\n\n2.7. Morphological analysis of microglia using IMARIS\nZ stacks of all photomicrographs from all animals were opened in IMARIS software. The ROI set for the phrenic motor nucleus in the C4 sections was then used to create an ROI surface through the stack to incorporate 3D microglial projections. Once the high-resolution 3D surface was created, the CD11b + cells were masked to eliminate background pixilation in order to more appropriately trace microglial processes. Starting points were then placed in the cell body of each microglia within the ROI. Seed points were then placed along the projections and the software automatically created a skeleton of the projections so 3D morphological attributes could be quantified. Filament length sum (primary projections from cell body), branch length (secondary projections), branch volume sum, filament volume sum, number of branches, number of end-points, filament distance from the origin sum, and the number of microglia within the ROI were quantified as previously described (\nCengiz et al., 2019\n). Quantification of each parameter was performed per microglia within the ROI. The parameters were then averaged across microglia within the ROI, and then averaged per animal and subsequently per group (\nn\n= 8 animals per group). A decrease in filament length sum, branch length, number of branches, number of end-points, filament distance from the origin, in addition to an increase in filament and branch volume would be indicative of amoeboid morphology. A Sholl analysis was also performed to quantify the branching density for each microglia within the ROI based on the number of intersections the branches make with a series of concentric circles (1 \u03bcm apart). From the Sholl analysis, the process maximum (N\nm\n, the maximum number of intersections for the cell), and the critical value (Cr, the distance from the cell body where N\nm\noccurred) per microglia were evaluated as previously described (\nMorrison and Filosa, 2013\n). These parameters were then averaged across microglia in the ROI, and then averaged per animal and subsequently per group. A decrease in the N\nm\nand the Cr would be indicative of amoeboid morphology.\n\n2.8. qRT-PCR for cervical spinal inflammatory-associated marker expression\nTissue used for qRT-PCR was obtained from a separate set of rats that did not undergo any prior studies. To begin to characterize the inflammatory response following CTB-SAP-induced respiratory motor neuron loss, cervical spinal (C3\u20135, which encompasses the phrenic motor nucleus) expression of inflammatory-associated markers was evaluated in control and CTB-SAP rats in the absence and presence of ketoprofen (12.5 mg/kg; IP delivery conducted 5 h prior to tissue collection). Rats were first perfused transcardially with 1\u00d7 PBS, and the C3\u20135 spinal cord was isolated from each rat immediately after perfusion. Tissue homogenate samples were sonicated and resuspended in TRI-reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA), which was followed by total RNA isolation according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. qRT-PCR was then used to determine TNF-\u03b1, BDNF, iNOS, and IL-10 gene expression since these markers have been shown to be implicated in the response to intermittent hypoxia and/or impact phrenic plasticity or breathing (\nAgosto-Marlin and Mitchell, 2017\n;\nBaertsch and Baker-Herman, 2015\n;\nBaker-Herman et al., 2004\n;\nBorkowski and Nichols, 2020\n;\nBroytman et al., 2013\n;\nGiannakopoulou et al., 2019\n;\nHuxtable et al., 2015\n). First, the RNA (1 \u03bcg) prepared from tissue samples of individual rats was reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA using an oligo(dT)/random hexamer cocktail and M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA). The cDNA was then used for qRT-PCR using iTaq\ntm\nUniversal SYBR\n\u00ae\nGreen Supermix (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), forward and reverse primers (primer sequences that were utilized are listed in\nTable 1\n), and DEPC water. Primer specificity was assessed through NCBI BLAST analysis prior to use, and all dissociation curves had a single peak with an observed melting temperature consistent with the intended amplicon sequences. Relative gene expression normalized to 18S was determined by the \u0394\u0394Ct method, and data was expressed as the fold change relative to controls in the absence or presence of ketoprofen. Sample size of treatment groups that did not receive ketoprofen: 7d control (TNF-\u03b1, BDNF, and IL-10,\nn\n= 9; iNOS,\nn\n= 8), 28d control (\nn\n= 8 for all genes), 7d CTB-SAP treated rats (\nn\n= 7 for all genes), and 28d CTB-SAP treated rats (TNF- \u03b1, BDNF, and IL-10,\nn\n= 6; iNOS,\nn\n= 5). Sample size of treatment groups that received ketoprofen: 7d control (\nn\n= 7 for all genes), 28d control (TNF-\u03b1,\nn\n= 6; BDNF, iNOS, and IL-10,\nn\n= 7), 7d CTB-SAP treated rats (\nn\n= 10 for all genes), and 28d CTB-SAP treated rats (\nn\n= 10 for all genes).\nTable 1:\nPrimer sequences for qRT-PCR analyses.\nGene Name\nForward sequence (5\u2019)\nReverse sequence (5\u2019)\n18s\nCGGGTGCTCTTAGCTGAGTGTCCCG\nCTCGGGCCTGCTTTGAACAC\nTNF-\u03b1\nTGCCACTTCATACCAGGAGA\nCCGGAGTCCGTGATGTCTA\nBDNF\nCCCATCACAATCTCACGGTAATC\nTGCGGAGGGTCTCCTATGAA\niNOS\nAGGGAGTGTTGTTCCAGGTG\nTCTGCAGGATGTCTTGAACG\nIL-10\nAAGTGATGCCCCAGGCAGAGAA\nAAATCGATGACAGCGTCGCAGC\nOpen in a new tab\n\n2.9. Statistical analysis\nIntegrated phrenic nerve burst amplitudes were averaged over 1 min during baseline and 15, 30, and 60 min after AIH. Peak integrated inspiratory phrenic nerve bursts at baseline were similar within treatment groups; thus nerve bursts were normalized to baseline measurements to appropriately quantify the magnitude of pLTF (expressed as a percentage change from baseline). Statistical comparisons between treatment groups for AIH studies (amplitude, PaCO\n2\n, PaO\n2\n, and mean arterial pressure) were done using a two-way ANOVA with a repeated-measures design. Since there were no differences between successive hypoxic exposure within groups (\np\n> 0.05, data not shown), comparisons of the short-term hypoxic phrenic response were made using a one-way ANOVA, in which phrenic burst amplitude during the fifth minute of hypoxic episodes was averaged from all three episodes. For TC rats receiving no AIH exposure, a two-way ANOVA with repeated-measures design was performed; since there were no differences among them, they were grouped into single TC groups per treatment (i.e., keto and keto veh) within control and CTB-SAP rats (keto veh TC control,\nn\n= 8; keto veh TC CTB-SAP,\nn\n= 6; keto TC control,\nn = 7\n; keto TC CTB-SAP,\nn\n= 7). A one-way ANOVA was used when comparing phrenic nerve burst amplitudes across groups at 60 min post-hypoxia, and when comparing the qRT-PCR data across groups where 7d and 28d controls were combined into one control group since no differences were detected between time points in the absence (TNF-\u03b1, BDNF, and IL-10,\nn\n= 17; iNOS,\nn\n= 16) or presence of ketoprofen (TNF-\u03b1,\nn\n= 13; BDNF, iNOS, and IL-10,\nn\n= 14). For parameters evaluated using IMARIS software in the phrenic motor nucleus, the 7d and 28d control and CTB-SAP rats were grouped together in their respective treatment groups because no differences were observed between time points within each treatment. A\nt\n-test was then performed to compare control rats to CTB-SAP rats. When significant ANOVA differences were detected, individual comparisons were made with Fisher\u2019s least significant difference post hoc test (Sigma Plot version 14.0; Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Differences between the groups were considered significant if\np\n< 0.05; all values are expressed as means \u00b1 S.E.M."

    "Methods": "2.1. Generation of the PK1 R104Q mice\nThe\nPK1\nguide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed using the online CRISPR tool (\nhttp://tools.genome-engineering.org\n) and tested in the N2A cell line before injections. The embryo microinjection was carried out at the UCSD transgenic core. The CRISPR mix containing Cas9 protein, sgRNA, and the single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODN) repair template was delivered by pronuclear injection into 0.5-day-old C57BL6 embryos. On the same day, injected embryos were implanted into the fallopian tube of recipient ICR females. Pups were born 21 days post implantation and genotyped. To avoid potential off-target effects, we backcrossed the mutant mice to the B6 background for seven generations before conducting analyses. The sgRNA sequence used for generating this mouse line is TCAAACTCTTGTCCAGAGCT. Sequence of the ssODN is TTTGAGCGAAGAAGAGAAGAAGGAGCTGCAGGTGTTCAGTGCTCAGCAAAAGAAAGAAGCTCTGGGGAGAGGAACTATTAAGTTGTTGTCCAGAGCTGTGATGCACGCCGTGTGTGAGCAGGTAGGCCCTCTCTAGAGCGAGCAGAGGGTTGGTGGGAGC.\n\n2.2. Genotyping\nGenotyping of all animals was done by PCR using genomic DNA prepared from tails. Tail lysates were prepared by immersing 0.5-cm tail pieces in 300 \u03bcl 50 mM NaOH solution, and incubating for 1 h at 95\u00b0C to lyse the tissue. Tail lysates were mixed with 30 ul 1 M Tris (pH 8) by vortexing and then centrifuged at 12000\nxg\nfor 2 min. The supernatants were used as DNA templates for PCR (Apex Taq RED 2\u00d7 Master Mix, Genesee Scientific, 42138). WT allele was genotyped using primers: 5\u2032-TGGGGAGAGGAACCATCAAACTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032- ACCGAGGCTTGAGCAGTTCAG-3\u2032. The PK1 R104Q mutant allele was genotyped using primers: 5\u2032- CTGGGGAGAGGAACTATTAAGTTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ACCGAGGCTTGAGCAGTTCAG-3\u2032. The PCR products for WT and mutant alleles are 717 bp and 718 bp respectively.\n\n2.3. Immunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (\nThakar et al., 2017\n). Briefly, mice were first perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and subsequently with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) dissolved in PBS. Brains were dissected out and fixed in 4% PFA in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C. Brains were cryoprotected by immersing in 30% sucrose until the tissue sank to the bottom and then embedded in OCT (Sakura, 25608\u2013930)/ 30% sucrose (1:1) mixture and frozen on dry ice. 40 \u03bcm-thick coronal free-floating sections were collected, treated with 1% SDS for antigen retrieval, and stained with antibodies against Bassoon (Synaptic Systems, 141004) and PSD-95 (Abcam, ab12093). Fluorescent image stacks (20 images per stack) were acquired using LSM510 or LSM 880 Zeiss confocal microscopes with a 63\u00d7 oil-immersion lens and 2.5\u00d7 zoom. Quantification and colocalization analyses of synaptic puncta were performed using the ImageJ\u2019 plugin, \u201csynapse counter\u201d(\nDzyubenko et al., 2016\n). Investigators were blinded to the genotypes of animals while conducting imaging and analysis.\n\n2.4. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and western blot\nNuclear and cytoplasmic lysates from adult mouse hippocampus (HPC) were prepared using NE-PER\n\u2122\nNuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (ThermoFisher Scientific, 78833). Lysates were IPed with anti-REST antibody (Abcam, ab202962, lot#GR3259950\u20139)) and with Dynabeads\u00ae Protein G (ThermoFisher Scientific, 10007D). Rabbit IgG (Millipore Sigma, 12\u2013370, lot#3281600) was used as a negative control. Denatured protein samples were run in an 8% SDS-PAGE gel (home-made). Proteins were then transferred onto a Immobilon-P PVDF membrane (Millipore Sigma; IPVH00010), blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST (0.05% Tween-20 in Tris-buffered saline), and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. Membrane was washed three times in TBST for 10 min each and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature followed by the same washing steps. Bands were detected by incubating the membrane with WestPico chemiluminescent substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific, 34580) and documented with X-ray film (ThermoFisher Scientific, 34091). Primary antibodies used for western blot include anti-PK1 (Proteintech, 22589\u20131-AP, lot#00018803), anti-PK2 (Millipore Sigma, MABN1529, lot#Q2785035), anti-HSP90 beta (ThermoFisher Scientific, PA3\u2013012, lot#TH269376), anti-HDAC1 (ThermoFisher Scientific, PA1\u2013860, lot#UH292524), and anti-GAPDH (Millipore Sigma, MAB374, lot#3291346).\n\n2.5. Overview of mouse behavioral assays\nPK1\nR104Q/\n+\nmice were backcrossed into wildtype (WT) C57BL/6 for seven generations. All behavioral tests were performed with mice 2 to 3 months of age. Mice were weaned at P21 and housed in groups of two to five of the same gender. They were maintained under a 12-h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water, except during the tests. One cohort of mice ran through a behavioral test battery designed to assess locomotor activity, exploratory activity, anxiety-like behavior, and cognitive phenotypes. Tests were run in the order listed: open field test (day1), elevated plus maze (day2), light-dark transition (day3), novel object recognition (day4\u20135), three-chamber social interaction (day8\u201310), and Barnes maze (day17\u201326) (\nBailey and Crawley, 2009\n;\nCrawley and Paylor, 1997\n;\nJanecka et al., 2017\n;\nLad et al., 2010\n;\nMcIlwain et al., 2001\n;\nPaylor et al., 2006\n). The housing room for mice used in the test battery was maintained on a reversed 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with white lights on from 8 pm to 8 am. Tests in battery were performed in the dark cycle between 10 am and 4 pm. Activities of mice in the test battery were captured using the EverFocus\u00ae 1080P camera mounted on the ceiling above the apparatus and streamed to the image acquisition software IC Capture (The Imaging Source). Videos were analyzed using the software Viewer (Biobserve). PTZ injection was performed using a different cohort of mice without training history, which were housed in normal light-dark cycle with white lights on from 7 am to 7 pm. PTZ injection experiments were conducted in the light cycle between 9 am to 3 pm. Both male and female mice were used in these assays. We pooled data from male and female animals together since we did not detect differences in their performance based on sex. On the test day, mice were habituated to the behavior room for 1 h before testing began. All apparatuses were cleaned with 70% (\nv\n/v) ethanol between animals. Visual cues were minimized unless they were required. Littermate controls were used in all tests. Investigators who performed the behavioral tests and video analysis were blind to the genotypes of tested animals.\n2.5.1. Open field test\nThe open field arena (40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 34 cm\n3\n) is made of non-reflective gray plastic. Each mouse was placed in the arena facing the walls of the releasing corner (same location for all tested mice). Mice were allowed to freely explore the arena for 10 min. Experiments were conducted under dim red light. For analysis, the open field arena was divided into a 20 cm \u00d7 20 cm central zone and the surrounding border zone. The center of the mouse\u2019s body was tracked. Total distance and time spent in the border zone was measured. Thigmotaxis (a tendency to remain close to the vertical wall) was calculated as the proportion of time animals stay in the border zone.\n2.5.2. Light dark transition test\nThe light dark box (40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 34 cm\n3\n; Stoelting) is composed of a dark compartment and a light compartment of equal size, separated by a partition with a door. The dark compartment was painted black with a closed top, whereas the light compartment was painted white with an open top and brightly illuminated (600 lx) with an indirect light source. The door connecting the two compartments was blocked until the animal was released to the center of the light chamber. Individual mouse was allowed to move freely between the two compartments for 10 min. For analysis, the center of the body was tracked when animals explored the light compartment. The number of total transitions and the time spent in the light chamber was measured.\n2.5.3. Elevated plus maze\nThe elevated plus maze (Stoelting) is made of non-reflective gray plastic and consists of four arms (15 cm long and 5 cm wide). Two open arms (without wall) and two closed arms (enclosed by 15 cm high walls) are connected to a central platform (5 cm \u00d7 5 cm). Each arm is attached to a sturdy metal leg to raise the apparatus 50 cm from the ground. Experiments were conducted in a brightly-lit area. Each mouse was placed in the central platform facing one of the closed arms and allowed to freely explore the maze for 10 min. For analysis, the entry in any arm was counted when all four paws were located within the space of the arm. Time spent in the open arms were measured. Animals fell off the maze were excluded from analysis.\n2.5.4. Novel object recognition test\nThe test was conducted in a customized arena which is 40 cm long, 25 cm wide, and 34 cm high. Individual animals were habituated to the empty arena for 30 min 24 h before the training session. During the training session, two identical objects were placed in opposite directions ~8 cm away from the corner in order to distinguish between the animal\u2019s preferences to the corner or the objects. Objects were customized geometric solids with different shapes and textures. Objects were secured to the arena with sticky magnets to prevent mice from moving them. Mice were placed in the center of the arena and allowed to explore freely for 5 min. 24 h later, animals\u2019 recognition memory was tested by swapping one of the familiar objects with a novel object. The test was performed under dim red light during the dark phase of the cycle. The snout of each mouse was tracked and interaction time was measured as time spent with snouts within 2 cm around the object. Animals spending less than 20 s exploring the two objects were excluded from analysis.\n2.5.5. Three chamber social approach test\nThe social approach apparatus is a rectangular non-transparent three-chambered plexiglass box. Each chamber is 40 cm long, 20 cm wide, and 20 cm high. Dividing walls are made from clear plexiglass with small openings (10 cm wide and 8 cm high) which can be blocked by sliding doors. In the first 10-min session, mice were habituated to the center chamber with the two openings blocked. Immediately after the first session was finished, the two sliding doors were removed to allow animals to explore the three chambers freely for 10 min. Before the test session, two steel wire pencil cups were placed in each of the side chambers. An age and gender-matched stranger mouse was placed under one of the inverted cups. The location of the stranger mouse was randomly arranged for each tested animal. Stranger mice were habituated to the inverted wire cup and the Plexiglass chamber prior to the experiments. Each stranger mouse was placed under a clean wire cup in one of the two side chambers for 10 min, and this was repeated for three times. Animals showing signs of aggression and disruptive behaviors, such as continuous bar-biting were not used in the test. During the test session, an individual mouse was placed in the center chamber and allowed to explore the three chambers freely for 10 min. 1 h later, social memory was tested by placing a novel mouse underneath the wire cup located in the empty chamber and measuring the animal\u2019s preference between the familiar mouse and the novel mouse. The test was performed under dim red light during the dark phase of the cycle. The snouts of the mice were tracked and interaction time was measured as time spent with snouts within 2 cm surrounding the wire cup. Experiments in which the stranger mouse showed signs of aggression and disruptive behaviors were excluded from analysis.\n2.5.6. Barnes maze test\nThe Barnes maze apparatus is a customized white circular plexiglass table (90 cm diameter) with twenty circular holes (5 cm diameter) located equidistantly from the perimeter. The maze was elevated 56 cm above the ground. Four colored geometric shapes (cone, cross, triangle and circle) equally spaced around the table were used as extra-maze visual cues. The escape box is a black Plexiglas box (15 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6.6 cm\n3\n) with a ramp covered with black plastic mesh which allows the animal to easily enter the escape box. Ceiling lights were positioned 192 cm above the maze (~800 lx) and a buzzer (2 kHz, 90 dB) were used as aversive stimuli.\nThe Barnes maze task was run over the course of 11 days in 4 phases: habituation (day0), acquisition training (day1-day4), probe test (day5), and reversal training (day6-day9). On the habituation day, each animal was placed in the maze next to a hole with escape box, restrained underneath a clear 2 litter glass beaker and given 5 min to enter the escape box through the hole. If they did not enter on their own, they were guided by the experimenter to enter the escape box and allowed to stay in the escape box for 1 min before being returned to its home cage. The habituation procedure allowed animals to experience the aversive bright light and to practice using the ramp to step down to the escape box.\nDuring the acquisition training phase, only the target hole had the escape box underneath, the other 19 holes had \u201cfalse escapes boxes\u201d (a shallow black box which is 5 cm long, 5 cm wide and 1.5 cm deep) attached underneath. Locations of target hole were randomly arranged for each animal and covered all the four quadrants of the maze. An individual mouse was placed underneath a start chamber (a black cardboard box) located in the center of the maze for 15 s allowing the animal to face a random direction. A buzzer was turned on and the start chamber was removed to start the trial. If a mouse successfully entered the escape box, the buzzer was turned off and the trial ended. The mouse was allowed to stay in the escapes box for 1 min before being returned to its home cage. Mice failing to enter the escape box during the 3 min session were guided into the escape box by the investigator. Animals were trained twice a day with 15 min inter-trial interval for 4 days. Location of the target hole was kept constant during the training phase and was randomly selected for each animal. The latency to locate the target hole was measured. If mice failed to enter the escape box within the 3 min training session, latency was counted as 3 min.\nFor the probe test on day 5, the escape box was removed and all of the twenty holes led to false escape boxes. A mouse was released from the start chamber and allowed to freely explore the maze for 3 min with the buzzer turned on. The center of the body was tracked and the time animals spent in each quadrant was measured. Procedures of the reversal training were similar to the acquisition training phase, except that the location of the target hole was opposite to its location during the acquisition training phase. Animals fell off the maze were excluded from analysis.\n2.5.7. PTZ injection to induce seizure\n2 mg/ml PTZ (Sigma-Aldrich, P6500) was prepared in sterile 0.9% (\nw\n/\nv\n) NaCl. 50 mg/kg PTZ was injected intraperitoneally with a 1-ml syringe attached to a 27-gauge needle into left or right quadrant of the abdomen of each mouse. An individual animal was placed in a clear plastic cage with bedding and monitored by a side view webcam for 30 min. The latencies to the first jerk and tonic-clonic seizure were recorded by observer.\n\n2.6. Statistical analysis\nMethods and complete results of statistical analysis were described in corresponding figure legends. All statistical analysis was performed using the software GraphPad Prism."

Participants were advised to refrain from caffeine and nicotine products for at least 6 hours, and eating for at least 30 minutes prior to testing, as they may affect breathing (\nBenowitz, 1990\n;\nGong et al., 1986\n;\nHayashi et al., 2019\n) and/or alter AIH responses.\nTable 1.\nDemographics of ALS patients.\nParticipants\nSex\nAge\nOnset type\nALS-FRS/48\nTime since diagnosis (yrs)\nFVC (% predicted)\nSleep disordered breathing\nUse of NIV at night\nALS001\nM\n59\nBulbar\n33\n0.5\n64\nYes\nBiPAP\nALS002\nM\n57\nSpinal\n42\n0.9\n96\n-\n-\nALS003\nM\n68\nSpinal\n39\n0.5\n103\nYes\n-\nALS004\nF\n59\nBulbar & Spinal\n42\n0.25\n113\nYes\nCPAP\nALS005\nM\n69\nSpinal\n38\n4.5\n81\n-\n-\nALS006\nM\n69\nSpinal\n40\n9\n75\n-\n-\nALS007\nM\n71\nBulbar & Spinal\n34\n0.1\n68\nYes\nCPAP\nALS008\nF\n64\nSpinal\n42\n0.4\n88\n-\n-\nALS009\nM\n72\nSpinal\n40\n0.25\n82\n-\n-\nALS010\nF\n70\nSpinal\n35\n0.85\n61\nYes\nCPAP\nALS011\nM\n73\nSpinal\n35\n1\n106\n-\n-\nALS012\nM\n56\nSpinal\n45\n0.4\n81\n-\n-\nALS013\nM\n62\nSpinal\n40\n1\n65\n-\n-\nOpen in a new tab\nNIV= non-invasive ventilation, ALS-FRS= amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale, BIPAP= bi-level positive airway pressure, CPAP= continuous positive airway pressure.\nAfter consenting and screening, subjects completed two study visits, in which they received \u201cAIH\u201d or \u201csham-AIH\u201d in random order. To reduce carry over effects, 2 weeks elapsed between visits. Subjects were blinded to treatment. During visits, measurements included sEMG, tidal volume and respiratory rate during quiet breathing, and then maximal inspiratory efforts.\n\nAIH and sham-AIH protocols\nDuring AIH sessions, subjects were seated upright and exposed to 15 hypoxic episodes, consisting of 1 minute of 10% oxygen, separated by 2 minutes of room air breathing (21% oxygen). Hypoxic gas was delivered using a latex-free facemask attached to a hypoxia generating device (Everest Summit II, Hypoxico Inc., NY, USA). In the sham or control visit, participants received only normoxia, consisting of 15 episodes of 21% oxygen for 1 minute, with 2 minute intervals (\nFigure 1\n); in these sham trials, room air was delivered with the same mask and hypoxia generating device (Everest Summit II, Hypoxico Inc., NY, USA). AIH and sham sessions were designed to give similar gas switching sensations during the protocols; subjects were generally unable to detect if they had received hypoxia versus normoxia on any given day.\nFigure 1. Experimental protocol.\nOpen in a new tab\nThe study consisted of two randomly assigned visits. During the sham visit (\nA\n), the intervention sequence lasted for approximately 45 minutes and room air (21% oxygen) was delivered the entire time (with all other procedures simulating AIH test days). The AIH visit (\nB\n) consisted of delivering 15 60 second episodes of 10% oxygen, separated by 120 seconds of room air breathing (21% oxygen). Quiet breathing, MIP and SNIP tests, as well as sEMG recordings, were performed before (baseline) and 60 min after interventions.\nHeart rate and blood pressure were measured before, during, immediately after, and 60 minutes post-AIH. Oxygen saturation was measured continuously, and Borg dyspnea ratings (used to measure breathlessness) were assessed after every AIH or sham AIH sequence. We targeted moderate hypoxia (SpO\n2\nnadir: 80\u201383% (\nNavarrete-Opazo et al., 2017a\n;\nSandhu et al., 2019\n;\nTrumbower et al., 2012\n)); however, if oxygen saturation dropped below 78% during any hypoxic episide, that episode was terminated early; in subsequent hypoxic episodes, the inspired oxygen was raised to 11%. No subjects reported breathlessness or discomfort during hypoxic episodes, and only one ALS participant showed an SpO\n2\nvalue lower than 78% during an hypoxic episode; in that individual, the protocol was modified as described above.

Data is presented as mean \u00b1 SEM.\nTo examine AIH effects on breathing function, quiet breathing and maximal respiratory efforts were recorded prior to intervention (Baseline), and 60 minutes post-AIH or sham-AIH (Post\n60\n).\nFigure 1\nsummarizes the protocol.\n\nQuiet breathing assessment\nWhile sitting upright, subjects breathed with a facemask (series 7450 V2, Hans Rudolph) connected to a pneumotachograph (MLT 1000L, AD instruments, Dunedin, New Zealand, Sampling rate 1000 Hz); quiet breathing was recorded for 5 minutes. The facemask was fixated in position with head straps to prevent air from escaping near its edges. The pneumotachograph was sampled with a data acquisition system (Powerlab 16/30, AD instruments, Dunedin, New Zealand) and fed into a computer equipped with LabChart analysis software (LabChart 8, AD instruments, Dunedin, New Zealand).\n\nMaximal respiratory efforts\nAfter recording during quiet breathing, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) were measured with a pressure manometer (MicroRPM, CareFusion, California, USA). ATS/ERS guidelines were followed during these tests (\nLaveneziana et al., 2019\n). For MIP, at least 3 measurements within 10% variability of one another were recorded and a minimum of 30 seconds was allowed between repetitions. SNIP was repeated at least 10 times, with ~30 second intervals. If the 10\nth\nmeasurement was the highest value, additional measurements were taken until increases were no longer seen (\nLofaso et al., 2006\n). For both MIP and SNIP, the highest 3 values were averaged for statistical analyses.\n\nRespiratory muscle activity\nMuscle activity was recorded during quiet breathing and maximal inspiratory efforts using a Bagnoli-8 desktop system (Delsys Incorporated, Natick, MA, USA). The skin was shaved when necessary and cleaned with alcohol. Electrodes (Bagnoli surface electrode, Delsys, Massachusetts, USA) were positioned bilaterally on the anterior scalene (anterior scalene located in the posterior triangle of the neck at the level of the cricoid cartilage) (\nMurray et al., 2008\n), sternocleidomastoid (SCM) (the 2/3 of the muscle from the origin to insertion) (\nThompson et al., 1997\n), 2\nnd\nparasternal (the 2\nnd\nintercostal space, 2cm lateral of the sternum on the second intercostal space) (\nLuu et al., 2015\n), and diaphragm muscles (the 7\nth\nor 8\nth\nintercostal space on the midclavicular line to record the costal diaphragm) (\nHodges and Gandevia, 2000\n). sEMG recordings were bandpass filtered (20\u2013450 Hz), differentially amplified (Gain: 10k), and digitized at 4kHz.\n\nData analysis\nEMG signals were analyzed with MATLAB v.9.2 (Mathworks, Inc. USA). Since the root-mean-square (RMS) EMG integration is correlated with muscle force (\nFuglevand et al., 1993\n;\nLawrence and De Luca, 1983\n), we analyzed peak RMS values for each muscle during quiet breathing and maximal respiratory efforts. To minimize recording artifacts, a running median filter was used with a 300-ms window sliding 1 sample at a time (i.e., 0.25 ms for each iteration). ECG artifact was removed in several steps; first ECG waveforms were selected during expiration, and an average ECG waveform template was calculated. We localized ECG artifacts by amplitude-modulated cross correlation and, finally, the average ECG waveform was subtracted from the ECG-contaminated EMG signal (\nBartolo et al., 1996\n).\nIn addition to comparing peak RMS values from individual muscles, a composite signal representing combined activity of 8 inspiratory muscles was generated. A vector based approach (\nAslan et al., 2013\n;\nLee et al., 2004\n) was used to generate a composite EMG magnitude and activation pattern from RMS values for each muscle. The vector analysis computes 2 values per participant. First, the magnitude (Mag), corresponding to the vector length, is calculated from RMS values for all muscles; this value expresses cumulative sEMG activity recorded during the condition analyzed. Thus, Mag represents the recruitment summation of cumulative respiratory muscle activity during the specific task investigated (\nAslan et al., 2013\n). Second, the similarity index (SI), which reflects differences in the pattern of EMG activity among muscles, was calculated as the cosine of the angle between each participant\u2019s response vector, and the averaged baseline response vector of the control group (termed the \u201cprototype response vector\u201d). In this way, SI is a value between 0 and 1.0; the closer SI is to 1.0, the closer muscle activiation patterns in that individual resemble the prototype response vector (\nAslan et al., 2013\n;\nLee et al., 2004\n). Differences between average Mag and SI values in ALS and control subjects indicate shifts in the (relative) contributions of respiratory muscles to breathing.\nThe Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS; v.25.0. IBM) was used for statistical analysis; graphs were generated with Prism (v.9.0; GraphPad Software, CA, USA). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to examine the distribution of dependent variables.\nA mixed effects model was applied to assess the separate and combined effects of treatment (AIH vs. sham) and group (ALS vs. control) on respiratory parameters and muscle activity (and other variables) during resting breathing and maximal respiratory efforts. These differences were expressed as a percent change from baseline.\nGroup differences (\ni.e\n. ALS vs control) in demographics and baseline respiratory variables were compared with Mann-Whitney or unpaired t-tests (baseline values were an average of AIH and Sham sessions). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare safety measurements (heart rate, dyspnea rating, blood pressure) between sessions in the ALS group. Significance was set at p<0.05; means \u00b1 1 SEM are reported."

    "Methods": "Experimental Procedures in Human Participants\nThe myelin imaging study recruited participants from two ongoing clinical trials designed to investigate the effect of eccentric-focused, downhill training on motor control after SCI (\nNCT02498548\n,\nNCT02821845\n). All individuals provided informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and all aspects of the study were approved by The Ohio State University\u2019s (OSU) Institutional Review Board.\n\nExperimental Procedures in Human Participants\nParticipants with SCI (\nn\n= 20) were recruited from the primary study and met the following inclusion criteria: age 18\u201385 years old, motor incomplete SCI within C1\u2013T10, some capacity to step over ground and on a treadmill, had completed an intensive treadmill-based locomotor training program, and were at least 6 months since discharge from outpatient rehabilitation. Exclusion criteria were: lower motor neuron injury innervating the legs, co-existing neurological conditions (i.e., brain injury), cognitive conditions that prevented informed consent, pregnancy, active deep vein thrombosis, skin wounds in regions where harness or hands provide support, or a history of Botox use for spasticity management within the 3 months prior to enrollment. Age-matched, uninjured control participants (\nn\n= 7) were recruited from the primary study and the community. All participants completed MRI safety screening. The disposition of participants and reasons for exclusion is shown in\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n. See\nSupplementary Table 1\nfor demographics of participants who completed the study and all data processing.\n\nRehabilitation Paradigm\nDownhill training for human participants with SCI began at least 6 months after neurorehabilitation ended (\nFig. 1\n). Trainer-assisted downhill stepping occurred 3 times a week for 12 weeks on a 10% grade, using an instrumented, split-belt treadmill (Bertec; Columbus, OH) with custom body-weight support system. Training duration totaled 20 minutes per session, performed in up to 5-minute stepping bouts separated by at least three, 5-minute seated rests to prevent delayed onset muscle soreness. Individualized eccentric training complexity occurred by modulating body-weight support and treadmill walking speed to target frontal plane hip motion or sagittal plane knee motion (\nWorthen-Chaudhari et al., 2015\n). A team led by a licensed physical therapist in collaboration with up to three clinical rehabilitation assistants provided intermittent manual assistance to allow error-based motor learning. The objective was self-correction by participants with SCI to attain normal kinematic alignment of the head, trunk, pelvis and legs. Trainers intervened briefly when biomechanical stepping errors predominated. Verbal cues during stepping bouts promoted knowledge of performance, and verbal feedback during rest breaks provided knowledge of results. Verbal cues were structured to facilitate external focus of attention when possible.\nFigure 1. Translational research design and experimental timelines.\nOpen in a new tab\nIndividuals or mice with SCI completed the experiments described above. In mice, group randomization is denoted by a star. Abbreviations: DH = Downhill\n\nMRI Acquisition\nImage acquisition occurred at the OSU Wright Center for Innovation using a 3-tesla (T) MRI system (Ingenia CX, Philips Healthcare). To acquire brain images, a dStream head/spine radiofrequency (RF) coil was used. The following scans were collected of the brain: 1) High-resolution 3D fast-field echo (FFE) T1-weighted sequence (repetition time (TR) = 9.9ms, echo time (TE) = 4.6ms, matrix = 232 \u00d7 192, in-plane field of view (FOV) = 232 \u00d7 232mm, slice thickness = 1mm, number of slices = 150, number of signal averages = 1, flip angle = 8\u00b0, turbo field echo (TFE) factor = 192, scan time = 5min 20sec) and 2) 32-echo gradient and spin echo (GRASE) T2-weighted sequence (TR = 1200ms, TE = 10,20,30\u2026,320ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, refocusing flip angle = 180\u00b0, matrix = 224 \u00d7 90, in-plane FOV = 224 \u00d7 180mm, slice thickness = 1.5mm, number of slices = 80, number of signal averages = 1, scan time = 9min 30sec).\nTo acquire images of the cervical spinal cord (C2-C4), the following scans were collected: 1) merged fast-field echo (M-FFE) T1-weighted sequence (TR = 650ms, first TE = 4.1ms, number of echoes = 4, echo spacing = 7ms, matrix = 188 \u00d7 188, in-plane FOV = 150 \u00d7 150mm, slice thickness = 2.5mm, number of slices = 16, number of signal averages = 2, flip angle = 28\u00b0, scan time = 4min 10sec) and 2) 32-echo GRASE T2-weighted sequence (TR = 1500ms, TE = n*10ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, refocusing flip angle = 180\u00b0, matrix = 240 \u00d7 196, in-plane FOV = 180 \u00d7 147mm, slice thickness = 2.5mm, number of slices = 16, number of signal averages = 1, scan time = 9min 10sec).\nFor individuals with SCI, MRI-acquisition occurred within 6 weeks prior to downhill training (range = 3d to 39d) and within 24 hours of the final training session. For uninjured control participants, two sets of data were collected within a single session. Scans of the brain and spinal cord were performed back-to-back, separated by changing of RF coils.\n\nGeneration of MWF Maps\nGeneration of brain and spinal cord MWF maps from T2 relaxation imaging used the latest non-negative least squares method (\nWhittall et al., 1997\n), implemented with an extended phase graph algorithm to correct for stimulated echoes (\nPrasloski et al., 2012\n). The T2 distribution of each imaging voxel was partitioned into short (<40ms), intermediate (40\u2013200ms), and long (>1500ms) components using an in-house MATLAB code (MATLAB R2013b, MathWorks Inc) developed at the University of British Columbia (UBC; code requests:\nhttps://mriresearch.med.ubc.ca/news-projects/myelin-water-fraction/\n). The MWF is the sum of the amplitudes within the short T2 component divided by the amplitude sum of the total T2 distribution. Voxel-based MWF maps were generated for each participant.\n\nProcessing of Brain Imaging\nFurther processing of brain MRI data was performed as previously described by Lakhani\net al\n(\nLakhani et al., 2017\n). Here, we utilized the freely available FreeSurfer Software Suite v5.3 (\nhttps://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/\n) to perform all morphometric procedures, including automated cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation (technical details described previously (\nDale et al., 1999\n;\nDeoni et al., 2015\n;\nFischl and Dale, 2000\n;\nFischl et al., 2001\n;\nFischl et al., 2002\n;\nFischl et al., 2004\n;\nLakhani et al., 2017\n;\nReuter et al., 2010\n;\nReuter et al., 2012\n;\nSalat et al., 2009\n;\nSegonne et al., 2004\n)). Processing included motion correction and averaging (\nReuter et al., 2010\n) of multiple volumetric T1-weighted images, removal of non-brain tissue using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure (\nSegonne et al., 2004\n), automated Talairach transformation, segmentation of the subcortical white matter (\nFischl et al., 2002\n;\nFischl et al., 2004\n), intensity normalization (\nSled et al., 1998\n), tessellation of the gray matter white matter boundary, automated topology correction (\nFischl et al., 2001\n;\nSegonne et al., 2007\n), and surface deformation following intensity gradients to optimally place the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders at the location where the greatest shift in intensity defines the transition to the other tissue class (\nDale et al., 1999\n;\nDale and Sereno, 1993\n;\nFischl and Dale, 2000\n). Images were automatically processed with the longitudinal stream (\nReuter et al., 2012\n). Specifically, an unbiased within-subject template space and image was created using robust, inverse consistent registration (\nReuter et al., 2010\n). Processing steps, such as skull stripping, Talairach transforms, atlas registration as well as spherical surface maps and parcellations were then initialized with common information from the within-subject template, significantly increasing reliability and statistical power (\nReuter et al., 2012\n). Visual inspection of FreeSurfer surface reconstructions occurred at each stage of the longitudinal processing pipeline. Manual correction of errors included removing dura misidentified as cortex and re-processing the current and subsequent steps.\nLinear co-registration occurred in three steps, using established methods by Lakhani\net al\n(\nLakhani et al., 2017\n) and Deoni\net al\n(\nDeoni et al., 2015\n): 1) registration of the first echo from the T2 scan to the MWF map, 2) registration of the first echo of the T2 scan to the parcellated T1 anatomy, and 3) registration of the MWF map to the parcellated anatomy. All processing occurred on the same workstation, using the same software version (\nGronenschild et al., 2012\n), and individualized intensity normalization was used to increase registration accuracy (\nSled et al., 1998\n). The FreeSurfer-generated white matter parcellation map (\nSalat et al., 2009\n) was used to extract mean MWF from a priori identified regions of interest (ROI).\n\nProcessing of Spinal Cord Imaging\nSpinal cord MRI data post-processing occurred as described by Liu\net al\n(\nLiu et al., 2020\n). Spinal cord segmentation of the GRASE image occurred using the Spinal Cord Toolbox PropSeg tool (\nDe Leener et al., 2017\n;\nYiannakas et al., 2016\n), which generated a mask of the whole cord. Segmentation used the 16\nth\necho of the GRASE image, because it has the greatest contrast between the spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid. Visual inspections occurred and manual corrections to the mask were made when needed. The whole cord mask was then registered to the PAM50 template (\nDe Leener et al., 2018\n) using a nonlinear transformation that involved a combination of center of mass rotation, affine, symmetric normalization, and bsplinesyn algorithms. This process obtained the warping functions used to transform the GRASE images and subsequently MWF maps into the template space. Visual inspection of all registered images occurred. MWF values were extracted from the PAM50 atlas labels.\n\nMRI Data Analysis\nFor analysis of MWF data, subcortical white matter regions corresponding to areas known to be responsive to motor learning were identified\na priori\n. Motor learning areas included white matter underlying the precentral, postcentral, caudal middle frontal, inferior parietal, and precuneus cortices, and the anterior and posterior regions of the corpus callosum (CC) (\nLohse et al., 2014\n). Regions not expected to change following an eccentric-focused locomotor task were also identified\na priori\n. Non-motor learning brain regions included white matter underlying the fusiform, inferior temporal, middle temporal, superior temporal, lateral orbitofrontal, lateral occipital, and lingual cortices (\nLohse et al., 2014\n). We measured white matter plasticity in the cervical cord because frank demyelination, above-level atrophy, and neuroplasticity are localized here (\nFreund et al., 2012\n;\nLiu et al., 2017\n;\nRaineteau and Schwab, 2001\n). Due to the bilateral nature of the locomotor task, MWF data from right and left ROI\u2019s were combined and averaged to calculate an overall MWF value for each region.\nWe determined reliability of MWF measures by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Regions with poor reliability (ICC < 0.5) were excluded from subsequent analyses (\nKoo and Li, 2016\n). Next, we determined whether individual MWF changes surpassed measurement error (\nBeckerman et al., 2001\n) by calculating the minimal detectable change (MDC) for each ROI using the formula MDC = SD * \u221a(1 \u2013 r) * 1.96 as described by Forrest et al (\nForrest et al., 2014\n). Here, SD represents the standard deviation (SD) of the difference between pre- and post-intervention measurements, r represents the ICC, and 1.96 is the 97.5% quantile of the standard normal distribution of a two-tailed test with the significance set at\n\u03b1\n= 0.05.\nWe compared the mean percent change of the downhill trained SCI participants (SCI+DH) with the mean percent change of the within-session data in the uninjured control group (Control) using a Mann Whitney U, nonparametric test to determine whether the mean percent MWF change within each ROI for the SCI+DH group exceeded the variability of the measure established by the Control group. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD.\n\nExperimental Procedures in Mice\nAnimal experiments were conducted with approval and in accordance with The Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Adult, male and female mice were group housed (3\u20135 per cage), fed standard chow\nad libitum\n, and maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle throughout the experiments.\n\nGeneration of PDGFR\u03b1-CreERT2:mT/mG (mT/mG) Transgenic Mice\nBecause OPCs express platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b1 (PDGFR\u03b1), we utilized Cre-inducible\nPDGFR\u03b1\nmice (\nRivers et al., 2008\n) to generate inducible reporter mice as described by Hesp\net al\n(\nHesp et al., 2015\n). Heterozygous\nPDGFR\u03b1-CreER\nT2\nmice were backcrossed with C57BL/6J mice for four generations, then bred with mice that express membrane-bound tdTomato on all cells prior to Cre-mediated recombination (B6.129(Cg)-Gt(ROSA)26Sor\ntm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo\n/J; Jackson Laboratories) (\nMuzumdar et al., 2007\n), to generate\nPDGFR\u03b1-CreER\nT2\n:mT/mG\nmice. Recombination was induced by oral tamoxifen administration (300mg/kg dissolved in corn oil) via gavage for four consecutive days. During tamoxifen treatment, mice were given prophylactic subcutaneous injections of sterile saline (2cc) and high calorie food supplements daily to prevent dehydration and weight loss. After recombination, cells transcribing the PDGFR\u03b1 promotor down-regulate mT and begin to express membrane-bound green fluorescent protein (GFP), which is maintained for the life of the cell. Randomization into downhill training (SCI+DH) or unexercised control (SCI Unex) groups occurred immediately prior to injury. The disposition of all\nmTmG\nmice are described in\nSupplementary Fig. 2\n.\n\nExperimental SCI Procedures\nIncomplete spinal cord contusion was performed (\nFaw et al., 2018\n). Mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal ketamine (138mg/kg) and xylazine (20mg/kg). Prophylactic antibiotics (gentocin, 1mg/kg) were administered subcutaneously prior to surgery. The spinal cord was exposed by removal of the T9 lamina. The Infinite Horizon device delivered a 75 kilodyne (kdyn) contusive force to the spinal cord. Paraspinal muscles were sutured, and the skin was closed using surgical clips. Mice received sterile saline (2cc) to prevent dehydration and recovered overnight in warm cages. Postsurgical care included daily subcutaneous injections of prophylactic gentocin and saline for 5 days and twice-daily manual bladder expression for the duration of the experiments. Animals with impactor force or displacement values that exceeded \u00b1 2 SD from the overall mean were excluded from analyses.\n\nRehabilitation Paradigm\nMice received eccentric-focused, downhill treadmill training from 36 to 49 days post-injury, which consisted of quadrupedal stepping on a custom-built treadmill (Columbus Instruments) at the same 10% decline grade used for humans. Animals performed two, 10-minute bouts of downhill stepping separated by a 20-minute rest break in order to deliver 1000+ steps during each 20-minute session (\nCha et al., 2007\n). Training speed was initially set at a comfortable pace (7.0m/min) and progressively increased within and between sessions to the fastest speed that did not degrade stepping performance. Training progression was individualized based on performance. Manual assistance was provided as needed for trunk stability during locomotion. For both mice and humans, training paradigm length (weeks) was set at 150% of previously established flat treadmill rehabilitation efficacy (Mice = 1 week; Humans = ~6 weeks) (\nHansen et al., 2013\n;\nMorrison et al., 2018\n).\n\nOpen Field Locomotion\nLocomotor recovery was assessed in the open field using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) (\nBasso et al., 2006\n) prior to SCI, at 1 and 7 days post-injury, and weekly thereafter. Two raters, blind to group assignment, rated locomotor performance over 4 minutes considering joint movement, weight support, plantar stepping, coordination, paw position, trunk and tail control. Scores range from no hindlimb movement (0) to normal locomotor function (9). To maximize consistency, screening of BMS scores occurred at 1 day post-injury and mice with 1 day BMS scores > 0.5 were excluded (\nHansen et al., 2013\n).\n\nTwo-dimensional Kinematics\nFine characteristics of locomotion were assessed prior to SCI and 49 days post-injury using two-dimensional kinematics during flat treadmill walking as described previously (\nHansen et al., 2013\n). Briefly, animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane, the left hindlimb was shaved, and bony prominences (iliac crest and greater trochanter) were identified by palpation and passive range of motion. Depilatory cream removed hair from bony prominences to maintain marker locations for the duration of the study. The lateral malleolus and fifth metatarsal head were marked with white paint immediately prior to assessment. We recorded 20 steady-state hindlimb steps per animal per timepoint at 60 hertz using a Nikon D3200 digital video recorder. Movies were uploaded and markers were digitized using PEAK Motus software. Due to movement of the knee joint under the skin during locomotion, a triangulation program estimated the knee position based on post-mortem femur and tibia measurements (\nGoslow et al., 1973\n;\nHansen et al., 2013\n). Positional data (X,Y coordinates) were obtained at distinct gait phases: Initial Contact (E1; end of swing), Lift Off (E3; end of stance), and Flexion (F; mid-swing). End point kinematic data were compared between SCI+DH and SCI Unex groups using independent samples t-tests.\n\nThermal Sensitivity\nSensitivity to thermal stimuli was assessed at a consistent time of day at baseline and at six weeks post-injury using Hargreaves\u2019 Method (\nHargreaves et al., 1988\n) (Plantar Test Apparatus; Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy). A male rater, blind to experimental groups, performed all testing, which eliminated sex effects of the rater (\nSorge et al., 2014\n). Mice acclimated for 30 minutes prior to testing in individual clear plastic compartments (11cm \u00d7 17cm) with a glass floor. Infrared, radiant heat was applied to the plantar L5 dermatome through the glass until a withdrawal response occurred. A photocell on the heat source determined withdrawal and the duration (in seconds) of heat application (latency to withdraw). To prevent tissue damage, a 20 second maximum application was set. Mice were tested randomly with 5 trials per hind paw. The longest and shortest latencies were dropped for each paw before averaging the remaining latencies to yield a single withdrawal threshold for each mouse. End point latencies were divided by pre-injury latencies and scores are expressed as a percent of baseline. An independent samples t-test was used to compare SCI+DH and SCI Unex groups.\n\nTissue Processing\nMice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine (207mg/kg) and xylazine (30mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 0.1M PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Spinal cords were removed, including the cervical enlargement, divided into C1-C3 and C4-T1 segments, and a 6mm thoracic segment centered on the injury site (SCI groups) or T9 (Naive). Tissue was post-fixed in 4% PFA for 1 hour at 4\u2103, placed in 0.2M phosphate buffer overnight, then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, before being embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (ThermoScientific) and frozen on dry ice. Upper cervical and thoracic segments were oriented for cutting in the transverse plane. Lower cervical segments were oriented in the coronal plane to allow analysis along the length of axons. All tissue was cut at 20\u03bcm using a Microm HM 505E cryostat and stored at \u221280\u2103.\n\nImmunofluorescence\nTo label the lesion border, axons, or paranodes, slides were thawed and rehydrated in 0.1M PBS, blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, incubated in primary antibody overnight (\nSupplementary Table 2\n), then in secondary antibody (\nSupplementary Table 2\n) for 40\u201360 minutes before rinsed in PBS and coverslipped with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (ThermoFisher).\nTo identify new oligodendrocytes, slides were thawed and rehydrated in 0.05M tris buffered saline (TBS), blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum with 0.5% Triton X-100 in TBS, incubated in primary antibody overnight (\nSupplementary Table 2\n), then in secondary antibodies (\nSupplementary Table 2\n) at room temperature for 60\u201390 min, rinsed with TBS then PBS before being coverslipped as above.\n\nDigital Image Analysis\nFluorescent images were captured by confocal microscopy (Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope; OSU Campus Microscopy and Imaging Facility). All images were blinded prior to quantification, which was performed by a single rater. Secondary antibodies at 633 or 647 wavelength were pseudocolored magenta during microscopy.\nTo quantify epicenter lesion area, spinal cord images stained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were imaged at 10x magnification and analyzed using stereological point counting in Stereo Investigator (MBF Bioscience). Using the Cavalieri method, a point grid was placed randomly over the epicenter section and intersections over tissue were identified as either spared or lesioned tissue, representing a point (p). Point counts for each section were converted to area estimates using the formula: Estimated Area = (\u2211\nP\n)*(\na/p\n), where \u2211\nP\nis the sum of points for an individual mouse and\na/p\nis the area of each point. We calculated the percent sparing by dividing the area of GFAP\n+\ntissue by the total cross-sectional area. Animals whose percent sparing exceeded \u00b1 2 SD from the mean were excluded from the study. Independent samples t-test compared percent sparing between SCI+DH and SCI Unex groups.\nTo determine the density and location of new oligodendrocytes in the cervical spinal cord, CC1\n+\ncells that fit the proper size and shape criteria for oligodendrocytes (~10\u03bcm, round/oval), and colocalized with GFP and DAPI (\nHesp et al., 2015\n;\nMcKenzie et al., 2014\n) were quantified throughout spinal cord hemisections located at C2 or C3. Spinal white matter was subdivided into dorsal columns, lateral, and ventral funiculi. To delineate lateral and ventral funiculi, a line was drawn from the midpoint of the ventral horn gray matter to the anterolateral sulcus at the edge of the tissue (\nChung and Coggeshall, 1983\n). Cell counts were divided by the funiculi area, determined using ImageJ (\nhttps://imagej.nih.gov/\n), and are expressed as the number of CC1\n+\n/GFP\n+\n/DAPI\n+\nnew oligodendrocytes per square millimeter (mm\n2\n). One-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\ntest analyzed CC1/GFP/DAPI\n+\ncell density between Naive, SCI+DH, and SCI Unex groups.\nTo quantify oligodendrocyte lineage cell and axon interactions, GFP\n+\n/neurofilament (NF)\n+\naxon segments were quantified from high magnification (60x) images in the gracile tract of horizontally cut, cervical cord (C4-T1) tissue sections. Axon contacts were counted if GFP labeling surrounded NF\n+\naxons (in the same plane of focus) over at least a 5\u03bcm distance. Quantifications are expressed as the number of GFP\n+\n/NF\n+\naxon segments per mm\n2\nand analyzed between Naive, SCI+DH, and SCI Unex groups using a one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\ntest. Representative optical z-stacks were acquired at high magnification (180x) to illustrate GFP\n+\nprocesses wrapping NF\n+\naxons.\nContactin-associated protein (Caspr)\n+\nparanodes in the gracile tract of the cervical enlargement (C4-T1) were quantified as a surrogate measure of functional myelin. High magnification (80x) images were batch processed using MIPAR Image Analysis Software (Worthington, OH). Briefly, a threshold of positive labeling was determined for Caspr\n+\nlabeling. Caspr\n+\nprofiles were counted and binned into short (0.5\u20131.99\u03bcm) or long (2.0\u201319.0\u03bcm) profiles. The number of short and long profiles are expressed as a percent of total Caspr\n+\nprofiles. Between-group analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\ntest.\n\nStatistics\nData from human participants are expressed as either individual values or mean \u00b1 SD. For within-subject comparisons, individual differences between pre- and post-training MWF values were compared to the calculated MDC for brain and spinal cord ROIs. Levene\u2019s test showed there was not a statistically significant difference in variances between SCI + DH and Control groups. As such, we proceeded with between-group comparisons using a Mann-Whitney U, nonparametric test. For animal experiments, values are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Individual data points > 2 SD above or below the mean were considered outliers and excluded from subsequent analyses. Between-group comparisons were made using either independent samples t-test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\ntesting. Relationships between functional and immunohistochemical measures were determined using Pearson\u2019s correlation. All comparisons occurred using GraphPad Prism statistical software. Significance was set at\n\u03b1\n\u2264 0.05 for all statistical tests.\n\nData availability\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal experiments were approved by the responsible Animal Protection Authority (Regierung von Unterfranken, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany). Inbred congenic C57BL/6/J and Ca\nV\n3.2 knock-out (KO) mice (B6;129-Cacna1htm1Kcam/J; Jackson Laboratories) of both sexes and ranging in weight between 20\u201325g were housed in group cages in a temperature-controlled environment with a 12h light-dark cycle and were supplied with food and water\nad libitum\n. On the day of the final experiment accounted animals were killed in a rising CO\n2\natmosphere in accord with German and European laws.\n\nDiabetes model\nWe used multiple low-dosed streptozotocin (STZ) injections for inducing diabetes in C57BL/6J control and Ca\nV\n3.2 KO mice (\nFurman, 2015\n). On the day of STZ injections food was removed from cages 4 hours prior to injections, water supply remained\nad libitum\n. Prior to STZ injections 6 ml sodium citrate buffer was made by mixing 3 ml 0.1 M Na-citrate 1:1 with 3ml 0.1 M citric acid and pH was adjusted to 4.5. Citrate buffer and STZ powder were kept in darkness and cooled in ice. Immediately prior to injections STZ was dissolved in the citrate buffer to a concentration of 4 mg/ml. Mice were weighted and immediately injected with STZ solution intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 40 mg/kg. Mice were returned to their home cages and provided with food and 10% sucrose water for the rest of the day. STZ injections were repeated for 5 consecutive days; on the last day mice were provided with regular tap water. Glucose tail vein blood levels were measured in mice using a dipstick glucose monitoring device (Accu-Check, ROCHE, Germany) on days 14 and 21 (counting from the first injection day). Animals with blood levels above 250 mg/dL at day 21 were considered diabetic and were sacrificed for further experiments within a maximum of 14 days.\n\nCGRP release\nStimulated neuropeptide release was measured\nex vivo\nin hindpaw hairy skin or desheathed sciatic nerve preparations of healthy and diabetic mice as previously described (\nBabes et al., 2010\n;\nSauer et al., 1999\n). Samples were placed in carbogen-gassed SIF solution (see below; 5 mM glucose) or high-glucose SIF (25 mM) in case of preparations from diabetic mice and positioned in a shaking bath set to 32 \u00b0C (skin) or 38 \u00b0C (nerve) for a washout period of 30 min. The preparations then passed a series of four consecutive elution steps (S1-S4) each lasting 5 minutes The first two incubations were to determine basal CGRP release. In the third incubation step high potassium SIF solution at 40 mM (KCl) concentration was used for stimulation, the fourth incubation step assessed the recovery of the response. CGRP contents were determined using commercial enzyme immunoassays (EIAs; Bertin Pharma, Montigny, France), as described previously (\nBabes et al., 2010\n). Samples were photometrically analyzed using a microplate reader (Opsys MR\u2122, Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA, USA). To investigate dependence of stimulated CGRP release on Ca\nV\n3.2 or N- and L-type channels we used TTA-P2 (10 \u03bcM) or \u03c9-conotoxin (1 \u03bcM) combined with nifedipin (10 \u03bcM) to block these calcium channels in the skin of C57BL/6J mice, respectively. These blockers were added from the second to the fourth incubation period. In case of deglycosylation, neuramindase (2 units/ml) was dissolved in freshly bubbled SIF and the tissue samples were incubated as a pretreatment for 2 hours, after 1 hour the incubation solution was renewed to maintain oxygen supply and buffer capacity. Skin preparations were incubated at 32\u00b0C and isolated sciatic nerves at 38\u00b0C, respectively.\n\nDetermination of skin and nerve CGRP content\nSkin and sciatic nerve CGRP contents were determined as described previously (\nEberhardt et al., 2008\n). In brief, hairy hindpaw skin and sciatic nerve preparations of wildtype and Ca\nV\n3.2 knockout mice were heated in 1 ml acetic acid (2 M) for a 10 min period at 95 \u00b0C. Thereafter the preparations were homogenized by an Ultra-Turrax T8 (IKA Works, Staufen, Germany) and heated again for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C - CGRP is heat-stable. The suspension was then centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000g. The clear supernatant was diluted 1:50 with EIA buffer to adjust the pH value to 7.4 and to cope with the high concentrations of CGRP. The CGRP content of this solution was determined using the commercial assay as already described and the amounts of CGRP content are given in reference to 1g tissue weight in pmol/g (mean \u00b1 sem). The mean tissue weights of hairy skin and sciatic nerve preparations were comparable for wildtype and KO mice (wildtype 6.5 \u00b1 0.7 mg and 5.3 \u00b1 0.8 mg in KO, wildtype 2.8 \u00b1 0.2 mg and 2.7 \u00b1 0.6 mg in KO, respectively).\n\nSkin-nerve recordings\nThe isolated preparation of the mouse hind limb skin and innervating saphenous nerve was used to record extracellular action potentials from functionally singled cutaneous C-fibers using a compact all-in-one rig (Avere Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). A skin flap of the hairy hindpaw skin together with the saphenous nerve was excised and bond with vaseline to the bottom of an organ bath, corium side up. The chamber containing the skin was continuously perfused with SIF solution (for control mice) or high-glucose SIF (for tissue from diabetic mice) warmed to 32\u00b0C. The cut end of the nerve trunk was desheathed and thin free filaments were gently sucked into a recording glass pipette to obtain a single unit recording from a fiber with a delimited receptive field (RF). Voltage signals of the selected fiber were amplified (Avere Solutions, Erlangen, Germany), digitized (CED Micro1401, Cambridge Electronic Design, UK) and stored on disk for post-hoc analysis using custom written routines in Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design, UK). Mechanical stimulation was used as search stimulus and receptive fields were mapped using a blunt glass rod. Once a mechanical RF was identified, a metal microelectrode was placed on the skin inside the RF and served as the cathode for electrical stimulation. Axonal conduction velocity was determined on the basis of distance and action potential latency in response to electrical stimulation. Units conducting at < 1.4 m/s were classified as unmyelinated C-fibers (\nBessou and Perl, 1969\n). The marking technique, in which shifts in latency to electrical stimulation identify mechanically evoked action potentials (\nSchmelz et al., 1996\n), was used to confirm that mechanical and electrical stimuli affected one and the same C-fiber. Mechanical thresholds were determined using gravity-driven hand-held\nvon Frey\nprobes with calibrated buckling loads scaled from 1 to 128 mN in a geometric sequence. Responses to cooling or heating stimuli were determined by placing a metal ring (ca. 9 mm diameter) on the skin encircling the RF which was perfused using a feedback-controlled flow-through thermal stimulator (Avere Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). A fiber was considered cold/heat-sensitive, if more than two action potentials occurred during the cooling/heating ramp of 30 s duration to 47\u00b0 C, respectively. The activation threshold was defined as the temperature at which the second action potential of the response occurred. Individual C-fibers were classified functionally as mechano-heat sensitive (C-MH), high threshold mechanosensitive (> 5.6 mN, C-HTM), low threshold mechanosensitive (< 2.8 mN, C-LTM), mechano-cold (C-MC) or mechano-heat-cold sensitive (C-MHC). During characterization fibers were given at least 2 min rest between stimuli to prevent adaptation. After sensory characterization, in particular after heat stimulation, a proportion of C-fibers develops low-frequent irregular ongoing (\u201cspontaneous\u201d) activity (\nBessou and Perl, 1969\n). This ongoing firing was recorded for at least 10 minutes in SIF (control mice) or \u2018hyperglycemic\u2019 SIF (diabetic mice) followed by 10 minutes in hypoxic SIF solutions. To probe the Ca\nV\n3.2 involvement, a specific blocker TTA-P2 (10\u03bcM) in hypoxic normal or \u2018hyperglycemic\u2019 SIF solution was subsequently washed-in as a third step while continuously recording spontaneous firing in these fibers. The spontaneous discharge activity was analyzed over the last 8 minutes of each experimental period to exclude eventual after-discharge from previously applied mechanical/thermal stimulation. Spontaneous firing was defined as at least two spikes per minute, i.e. 16 spikes per 8 minutes recording. Bursting discharge pattern was defined as at least five consecutive spikes at a rate beyond the mean frequency of the individual fiber during the 8 min of recording. For instance, for a fiber with a mean firing frequency of 0.2 spikes/sec a burst would be defined as a cluster of at least 5 spikes during a coherent period of 25 seconds.\nFor evaluating the effects of de-glycosylation skin-flaps were immersed in neuraminidase-containing SIF (NEU, 2 units/ml) for at least 2 hours prior to experiment onset, and spontaneous firing was recorded while the RF was superfused with neuraminidase.\n\nChemicals and solutions\nSynthetic interstitial fluid (SIF; (\nBretag, 1969\n)) used for all\nin vitro\nexperiments consisted (in mM) of: 107.8 NaCl, 26.2 NaCO\n3\n, 9.64 Na-gluconate, 7.6 sucrose, 5.05 glucose, 3.48 KCl, 1.67 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.53 CaCl\n2\nand 0.69 MgSO\n4\n. PH was buffered to 7.4 using carbogen bubbling (95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide). To induce unspecific neuronal depolarization, SIF containing 40 mM KCl was generated by equimolar substitution of sodium chloride with potassium chloride. Hyperglycemia was mimicked by increasing the glucose concentration from 2.5 to 25 mM in SIF; tissue preparations from diabetic animals were always bathed in this solution. Hyperglycemic hypoxia: Hypoxia was induced by nitrogen gassing of normal or hyperglycemic HEPES-buffered SIF consisting of (in mM): 95.3 NaCl, 25 Na-gluconate, 7.6 sucrose, 25 glucose, 3.48 KCl, 1.67 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.53 CaCl\n2\n, 0.69 MgSO\n4\nand 10 HEPES bubbled with 97.5% N\n2\nand 2.5% CO\n2\ninstead of carbogen at pH 7.4. The hypoxic condition was verified in pilot experiments using an oxygen sensor (FireStingO2; Pyro Science, Germany); oxygen levels during continuous nitrogen gassing dropped to 7.5%. \u03c9-conotoxin (Alamone Labs, Israel) combined with nifedipin (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and a selective Ttype channel blocker 3,5-dichloro-\nN\n-[1-(2,2-dimethyl-tetrahydro-pyran-4-ylmethyl)-4-fluoro-piperidin-4-ylmethyl]-benzamide (TTA-P2; Alamone Labs, Israel) was diluted in normal or hyperglycemic SIF to a final concentration of 10\u03bcM. Neuraminidase (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) was used to deglycosylate Ca\nV\n3.2, the enzyme was diluted in normal or hyperglycemic SIF to a final concentration of 2 units/ml. Streptozotocin (STZ, Enzo Life Science GmbH, Germany), to induce diabetes, was dissolved in sodium citrate buffer (0.1 M Na-citrate mixed 1:1 with 0.1 M citric acid) \u2013 see diabetes model.\n\nStatistics\nFor iCGRP release experiments data is displayed in pg / ml (mean \u00b1 SEM). The column diagrams show the overall stimulated release (AUC, in pg / ml iCGRP). For this, values of the stimulated and the successive sample (S3 + S4) were added up and the sum of the baseline values (S1 + S2) was subtracted to gain quasi an area-under-the-curve (AUC, in pg / ml iCGRP). Within one experimental group data of iCGRP release were analyzed by Wilcoxon matched pairs test and to compare the time course of different groups ANOVA analysis together with Fisher\u2019s LSD post-hoc test were applied. AUC data from multiple groups were compared by one-way ANOVA again followed by Fisher\u2019s LSD post-hoc test.\nGroup variance of single-fiber recordings and of the \u2018success\u2019 rate of STZ treatment (i.e., development of hyperglycemia after STZ-treatment) were analyzed using \u03c7\n2\ntest. Excitability changes in fibers were tested using either Wilcoxon matched pairs (for comparison of pre- vs. post-treatment changes within a group) or Mann-Whitney U-test (for comparison between two fiber groups). All statistical tests were performed with Statistica 7 software (StatSoft, Tulsa, USA); differences were considered significant at p < 0.05 and marked with *."

    "Methods": "DsRed and Firefly Luciferase Expressing WEEV Viral Constructs.\nConstruction of recombinant WEEV (MacMillan strain) reporter viruses was previously described (\nLogue et al., 2009\n;\nPhillips et al., 2013\n;\nPhillips et al., 2016\n). Briefly, a duplication of the subgenomic promoter (SGP) sequence (nucleotides 7341\u20137500 of viral genome) of the WEEV McMillan strain was used to express firefly luciferase or DsRed. Plasmids were purified by QIAprep Spin MiniPrep Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA USA) and RNA was transcribed\nin vitro\nusing a T7 RNA polymerase (MAXIscript\u2122 kit, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY USA). BHK-21 cells (2\u00d710\n7\nin 400 \u03bcL) were transfected with 20 \u03bcL of total RNA using an ECM 630 electroporator (BTX Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA USA). The rescued virus was stored at \u221280\u00b0C before plaquing. All plaque titration assays were run in duplicate in Vero cells before experimental use as previously described (\nLiu et al., 1970\n).\n\nViral infections in wildtype and astrocyte Specific NF\n\u03ba\nB knock-out mice.\nAll animals were housed on a 12 hr light/dark cycle in a temperature-controlled room (maintained at 22-24\u00b0C) and had access to standard chow/water ad libitum. We generated astrocyte-specific NF\u03baB knockout mice as previously described by crossing mice expressing the human\nGfap-Cre\n+/\u2212\nmice with\nIkk2-loxP\n+/+\nmice (\nKirkley et al., 2019\n). Progeny were backcrossed four generations to produce\nGfap-Cre\n+/\u2212\n/Ikk2\nF/F\n(KO) or\nGfap-Cre\n\u2212/\u2212\n/Ikk2\nF/F\n(WT) animals for the study. Infections with recombinant WEEV were performed as previously described (\nBantle et al., 2019\n). Six-week-old male and female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Labs, Wilmington, MA USA) or astrocyte-specific NF\u03baB knockout mice were housed in a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility at the Infectious Disease Research Center at Colorado State University. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (Minrad Inc, Bethlehem, PA USA). We intranasally administered 20 \u03bcL of either DsRed-expressing or luciferase-expressing WEEV at a concentration of 1\u00d710\n4\nPFU/ml to anesthetized mice. All infected mice were euthanized at four days-post-infection and used to characterize the viral spread of WEEV. Mice infected with luciferase-expressing WEEV received a subcutaneous 150 mg/kg dose of luciferin and were analyzed using an IVIS 200 bioluminescence imaging system (Xenogen, Alameda, CA) 10\u201315 minutes later. Uninfected mice were used as an imaging control to adjust for background signal. The exposure time was 2 min under standard settings for the camera, and the Living Image 3.0 software (Caliper Life Sciences, Waltham, MA USA) was used to analyze and process images taken using the IVIS 200 camera. A threshold for significant BLM was established using negative imaging controls at 5\u00d710\n3\np/s/cm\n2\n/sr. Total light emission from each mouse was determined by creating a region of interest (ROI) of standard size for each mouse and collecting light emission data. All mice were handled in compliance with the PHS Policy and Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all animal protocols used in the study were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Colorado State University (Permit #11-2605A).\n\nGenerating anti-Alphavirus E1 Treatment Serum.\nWe vaccinated rabbits with recombinant WEEV McMillan strain E1-ectodomain antigen (10 \u03bcg antigen/dose), which was diluted in an immunological adjuvant comprised of polyI:C (dsRNA analog), ODN 1826 (unmethylated CpG DNA) (InVivoGen), and TiterMax Gold to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. A total of four doses were administered every two weeks before rabbits were terminally bled for serum collection. After collection, serum was heat inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Na\u00efve serum was also collected from control animals. All anti-E1 serum was tested against E1 antigen on coated titration plates before its use in the study and was found to have reciprocal antibody titer measurement greater than 26,000 reciprocal value, as previously reported (\nBantle et al., 2019\n).\n\nTissue Processing and Sectioning.\nOne, two, four, and eight weeks after infection with luciferase-expressing WEEV, animals were terminally anesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused. The brains were then extracted, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C and later processed for paraffin embedding and sectioned at 10 microns on a microtome through the anatomic midbrain and mounted on polyionic slides (Superfrost-plus, Fisher Scientific) (\nMiller et al., 2011\n;\nSmeyne et al., 2016\n).\n\nImmunofluorescence Staining and Imaging.\nCoronal and sagittal sections were deparaffinized and immunostained using anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 1:500; Millipore AB152) to identify dopaminergic neurons, anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:500; DAKO Z0334) to identify astrocytes and anti-calcium adaptor binding protein 1 (Iba-1; 1:250; WAKO 016-20001) to label microglia, per our previously published methods (\nHammond et al., 2017\n;\nMiller et al., 2011\n). Sections were visualized by automated montage imaging of individual 10X frames of each immunostained section using a Hammatsu Flash4.0 digital CMOS camera, ProScan III stage controller (Prior, Rockland, MA USA) and CellSens Dimension software (version 1.12, Olympus, Center Valley, PA, USA). Regions of interest representing distinct anatomical nuclei were analyzed on each composite montage image.\n\nStereological Assessment of neurons and glial cells.\nMethodologies for imaging and counting dopaminergic and total neurons in the substantia nigra, as well as microglia and astrocytes, were adapted from our previously reported studies (\nBaquet et al., 2009\n;\nTapias et al., 2013\n). To determine the number of dopaminergic neurons and microglia in the SNpc, deparaffinized sections were double-immunostained for TH and Iba-1 (mouse monoclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase and rabbit polyclonal Iba-1 (Wako Chemicals; 1:500)), using secondary antibodies including biotinylated mouse IgG (for TH, 1:1000) or biotinylated rabbit IgG (for Iba-1, 1:1000). Diaminobenzindine (DAB) or a VIP kit (Vector labs) reaction was used to yield a brown (TH) or a purple (IBA-1) chromogen, respectively. All tissue sections were counterstained with Nissl substance and Neutral Red to identify anatomical landmarks. Stereological analysis of dopaminergic neurons and microglia in the SNpc was performed as previously described (\nBaquet et al., 2009\n). To determine the number of resting and activated microglia, Iba-1-positive microglia in the SNpc were analyzed using our previously published morphological criteria to distinguish resting and activated microglia from infiltrating macrophages (\nGraeber and Streit, 2010\n;\nSadasivan et al., 2015\n;\nSmeyne et al., 2016\n;\nTansey, 2010\n). The number of microglia in the right and left SNpc were summed to provide an estimate of the total number of resting and active microglia in the SNpc (\nBantle et al., 2019\n). The investigator was blinded to the individual treatment groups when counting cells.\n\nAnalysis of catecholamines and monoamines.\nBrain samples were prepared and analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, as previously described (\nDe Miranda et al., 2015\n). Sample analysis for DA, 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) was performed at the VBI Neurochemistry Core, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. All tissue samples from each experimental group were coded and blinded for unbiased analysis.\n\nBehavioral Analysis.\nAll mice were acclimated to handling two weeks prior to infection and habituated to the video trackway with repeated runs prior to baseline measurements the day before infections with WEEV (\nGouveia and Hurst, 2013\n;\nStuart and Robinson, 2015\n). Multiple neurobehavioral parameters, including stride length, run duration, step cycle, cadence, duty cycle and stop time were measured using a custom-made real-time video gait analysis system, as previously described (\nHammond et al., 2018\n). All behavioral testing was performed on uninfected and infected mice on days 0, 14, 28 and 56. All parameter values were subtracted from the baseline measurements obtained on day 0 to normalize across all time points and treatment groups.\n\nImmunohistochemical Staining and Pathological Scoring of Phospho-serine 129+ Alpha-Synuclein Protein Aggregates.\nSections were processed for immunohistochemistry using a Leica Bond RXm automated staining system according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Antigen retrieval was performed in Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution 2 for 20 minutes at 37 \u00b0C. Reactive synuclein cell/cell aggregates were stained using a mouse monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein at Ser129, (pSyn#64, FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals) (\nJang et al., 2009a\n). Antibodies for phospho-Eif2\u03b1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 119A11, Rabbit mAb #3597) and phospho-PERK (Cell Signaling Technology, 16F8, Rabbit mAb #3179) were used at 1:500 dilution. Immunostaining and neuropathological scoring of P129+ protein aggregates were conducted in the cortex, hippocampus and midbrain on infected and uninfected brain sections by a veterinary pathologist blinded to the treatment groups using scoring methodology was adapted from previous reports (\nRey et al., 2016\n;\nRey et al., 2018\n). We assessed the presence of P129+ inclusions on two coronal sections per animal that were 20 \u03bcm in thickness, spaced at 100 \u03bcm intervals within the SNpc, with an\nN\n=6-8 mice at each timepoint for each treatment group (\nN\n=6-8 mice per group). Each section was analyzed at a 20\u00d7 magnification using an Olympus IX71 microscope (Center Valley, PA) with Retiga 2000R (Qimaging, Surrey, BC, Canada) and Qcolor3 (Olympus) camera and slidebook software (v6.0, Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Denver, CO) for image acquisition and analysis. A score of 1 to 5 was assigned to each brain region from a single coronal brain section and scored as follows: 1 = no aggregates, 2 = very sparse or one to two P129+ cells, 3 = mild with less than ten P129+ cells, 4 = dense with more than ten P129+ cells, 5 = very dense with more than 20 P129+ cells involved. The two scores obtained for each individual section were averaged for each mouse.\n\nQuantification of C3 and P129+ Alpha-Synuclein aggregates.\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin embedded mouse brain sections from the SNpc of infected mice were mounted on glass slides and immunofluorescently labeled on a Leica Bond RXM automated robotic staining system using Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution 2 for 20 minutes. Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies for mouse alpha synuclein phosphorylated Ser129 (P129) antibody (1:1000, clone pSyn#64, FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals) and rat anti-C3/C3b (1:500; Abcam 11871). Secondary antibodies included anti-mouse IgG AlexaFluor-488 and anti-rat IgG AlexaFluor-555. Whole brain fluorescent montage images of labeled tissue sections were visualized using a 20x objective and an automated Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-flash 4.0 LT CCD camera and collected using Olympus Cellsens software (v 1.15). Quantitative analysis was performed on dual- or triple-labeled fluorescence images generated by montage imaging of an entire coronal brain section, with individual images acquired using an Olympus Plan Apochromat 10X air objective (0.40 N.A.). The cortex, hippocampus and midbrain were delineated by anatomical landmarks and referenced to the Allen brain atlas. A region of interest (ROI) was generated around all P129+ cell aggregates in each neuroanatomical region of interest and the mean fluorescence intensity of C3/C3b was then obtained within each P129+ ROI. Duplicate tissue sections were stained and averaged for each mouse (\nN\n=6-8 mice at each time point for each treatment group). The investigator was blinded from all experimental groups for data acquisition. All slides were scanned under the same conditions for magnification, exposure time, excitation intensity and camera gain.\n\nImage analysis of reactive astrocytes.\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin embedded 8 \u03bcm brain sections were labeled by immunofluorescence staining as described above using a Leica Bond RXMm automated robotic staining system. Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies for anti-S100\u03b2 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500; Abcam 212816) and anti-C3 (mouse monoclonal, 1:50; Abcam 11871). Secondary antibodies included anti-rabbit IgG Alexafluor-647 and anti-rat IgG Alexafluor-555. To detect C3+ cells co-localizing with S100\u03b2+ astrocytes, individual ROIs were created around all S100\u03b2+ astrocytes within the SNpc and the mean C3 intensity was measured within each S100\u03b2+ astrocyte. Each brain was analyzed in duplicate, with a total of 6-8 mice per group at each time point for each treatment group. All slides were scanned under the same conditions for magnification, exposure time, excitation intensity, and camera gain.\n\nGeneration of Representative Normalized Pathological Overlays.\nTo generate the representative overlays at each time point, the total number of dopaminergic neurons, microglia, macrophages, astrocytes cellular counts and P129 pathological scores from infected mice were normalized to controls according to the following equation: [((1-0.2)*((x-y)/(y-z)))+0.2]*100=normalized percentage value (\nGopal Krishna Patro and Kumar Sahu, 2015\n). The control values obtained for each pathological parameter were averaged and then subtracted from the individual experimentally infected animal values yielding a pathological representative of activation (x). The minimum (y) and maximum (z) values were determined for each activation parameter dataset. Normalization was then performed by determining the difference between the control subtracted experimental infected values and the minimum overall value. The total obtained from this calculation serves as the numerator. The range of the data set was then determined by obtaining the difference from the minimum (y) and maximum (z) values, this would serve as the denominator. To account for phenotype associated with normal aging, a baseline value of twenty percent was factored into the equation for glial activation, protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. The value obtained from this overall calculation was then multiplied by 100 to represent total percentage activation of each parameter. The respective percentages at each time point (1 week, 2 weeks and 8 weeks) were averaged and plotted using spline curve fitting within GraphPad software (version 9.1.0; Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA).\n\nStatistical Analysis.\nAll data was presented as mean +/\u2212 SEM, unless otherwise noted. Experimental values from each mean were analyzed with a Grubb\u2019s (\u03b1=0.05) test for exclusion of significant outliers. Differences between each experimental group were analyzed using an unpaired t-test or a one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\ntest for multiple comparisons. Significance was identified as *\np\n< 0.05, **\np\n< 0.01, ***\np\n< 0.001, ****\np\n< 0.0001. All statistical analysis was conducted using Prism (version 6.0; Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA)."

    "Methods": "Chemicals: FK866 was obtained from National Institute of Mental Health Chemical Synthesis and Drug Supply Program (MH number F-901). Nicotinic acid riboside was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-478242). Nicotinamide riboside (NR) was a gift from ChromaDex, Inc.. NAD+(Sigma, N1636), NMN (Sigma, N3501), cADPR (Sigma, C7344) were purchased from Sigma.\n\nMouse studies: CD1 mice (gestation day 12.5; Charles River Laboratories) were housed (12 h dark/light cycle and less than 5 mice per cage) and used under the direction of institutional animal study guidelines at Washington University in St. Louis. NMRK1 knockout mice: Nmrk1tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi(NRK1\u2212/\u2212) and NMRK2 knockout mice: Nmrk2tm1.1(KOMP)Vlcg/J(NRK2\u2212/\u2212) were obtained from Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and Jackson laboratory respectively and were used to generated NRK1\u2212/\u2212:NRK2\u2212/\u2212(NRK1/2 dKO,Supplemental Figure 1).\n\nDRG neuronal culture and axon degeneration assay: mouse DRG neuron culture was performed as described before (Sasaki et al., 2016). Mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) was dissected from embryonic days 13.5 CD1 mouse embryo (50 ganglia per embryo) and incubated with 0.05% trypsin solution containing 0.02% EDTA (Gibco) at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. Then cell suspensions were triturated by gentle pipetting and washed 3 times with the DRG growth medium (Neurobasal medium (Gibco) containing 2% B27 (Invitrogen), 100 ng/ml 2.5S NGF (Harlan Bioproduts), 1 \u03bcM uridine (Sigma), 1 \u03bcM 5-fluoro-2\u2019-deoxyuridine (Sigma), penicillin, and streptomycin). Cells were suspended in DRG growth medium at a ratio of 50 \u03bcl medium/50 DRGs. The cell density of these suspensions was ~1\u00d7107cells/ml. Cell suspensions (1 \u03bcl/96 well, 5 \u03bcl/24 well) were placed in the center of the well using either 96- or 24-well tissue culture plates (Corning) coated with poly-D-Lysine (0.1 mg/ml; Sigma) and laminin (3 \u03bcg/ml; Invitrogen). Cells were allowed to adhere in humidified tissue culture incubator (5% CO2) for 15 min and then DRG growth medium was gently added (100 \u03bcl/96 well, 500 \u03bcl/24 well). Lentivirus transfer vector constructs harboring cDNAs including Venus, cytNMNAT1 (mouse), NRK1 (mouse), and NMN deamidase (E. coli) were previously described (Sasaki et al., 2016). Lentiviruses were added (1\u201310\u00d7103pfu) at 1\u20132 daysin vitro(DIV) and metabolites were extracted or axon degeneration assays (Sasaki et al., 2009) were performed at 6\u20137 DIV. Data were derived from minimum three biological replicates using independent batch of DRG cells originated from independent pregnant mice and minimum three technical replicates were included in each biological replicate. For protein transduction of NNM deamidase, lentivirus particles (5\u201350\u00d7103) were added at indicated time post axotomy. When using 24 well DRG cultures, 50% of the medium was exchanged for a fresh medium at DIV4. For axotomy experiments, cell bodies and axons were separated by a microsurgical blade.\n\nMetabolite extraction: At DIV6, tissue culture plates were placed on ice and culture medium replaced with ice-cold saline (0.9% NaCl in water, 500 \u03bcl per well). For collection of axonal metabolites, cell bodies were removed using a pipette. For collection of intracellular metabolites, saline was removed and replaced with 160 \u03bcL ice cold 50% MeOH in water. The axons were incubated for a minimum of 5 min on ice with the 50% MeOH solution and then the solution was transferred to tubes containing 50 \u03bcl chloroform on ice, shaken vigorously, and centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. The clear aqueous phase (140 \u03bcl) was transferred into a microfuge tube and lyophilized under vacuum. Lyophilized samples were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until measurement.\n\nMetabolite measurements: Lyophilized samples were reconstituted with 5 mM ammonium formate (15 \u03bcl), centrifuged (13,000 x g, 10 min, 4\u00b0C), and 10 \u03bcl clear supernatant was analyzed. NMN, NAD+, and cADPR were measured using LC-MS/MS (Hikosaka et al., 2014). Samples were injected into a C18 reverse phase column (Atlantis T3, 2.1 \u00d7 150 mm, 3 \u03bcm; Waters) using HPLC (Agilent 1290 LC) at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min with 5 mM ammonium formate for mobile phase A and 100% methanol for mobile phase B. Metabolites were eluted with gradients of 0\u201310 min, 0\u201370% B; 10\u201315 min, 70% B; 16\u201320 min, 0% B. The metabolites were detected with a triple quad mass spectrometer (Agilent 6470 MassHunter; Agilent) under positive ESI multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using parameters specific for each compound (NAD+, 664>428, fragmentation (F) = 160 V, collision (C) = 22 V, and cell acceleration (CA) = 7 V: NMN 335 > 123, F=135 V, C=8 V, CA = 7 V: cADPR, 542>428, F = 100 V, C = 20 V, and CA = 3 V: NaMN 336>124, F=80 V, C=10V, CA = 7 V: NaAD 669>428, F=150 V, C=20 V, CA = 7 V: NaR, 256>124, F=35 V, C=10V, CA = 3 V: NR 255 >123, F=130 V, C=20 V, CA = 1 V). Serial dilutions of standards for each metabolite in 5 mM ammonium formate were used for calibration. Metabolites were quantified by MassHunter quantitative analysis tool (Agilent) with standard curves and normalized by the protein. Data were derived from a minimum of three biological replicates using independent batches of DRG cells dissected from independent pregnant mice and a minimum of three technical replicates were included in each biological replicate.\n\nWestern blot: DRG cell suspension (1\u00d7107cells/ml, 5\u03bcl) was spotted in the center of 24-well and cultured for 6 to 7 days as described above. Cell bodies were separated from axons using the micro surgical blade and were removed from the culture vessel by aspirating with P200 pipet. After indicated time post axotomy, culture medium was removed, and axons were collected with 300 \u03bcL of 0.9% NaCl in water and transferred to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. After centrifugation (12,000xg, 5min), the supernatant was removed and added 100 \u03bcl 10mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 138mM NaCl, 2.7mM KCl, and protease inhibitor cocktail (cOmplete, Roche) and axons were lysed by sonication and protein concentration was measured using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierc). Then axon lysates were mixed with sample buffer (375mM Tris-HCl (pH6.8), 9% SDS, 50% glycerol, and 0.03% bromophenol blue) and about 10 \u03bcg of the lysates were used for western blotting. SDS-PAGE was performed using Bolt\u2122 4 to 12%, Bis-Tris (Invitrogen) with Bolt MOPS SDS Running Buffer (Invitrogen) and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham, 10600002). Membranes were incubated with blocking solution (5% BSA in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS-T)) for one hour then with NMNAT2 antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-515206, 1:1000 dilution in blocking solution) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Membranes were washed in PBS-T and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno Research, 115\u2013007-003, 1:5000 dilution in PBS-T) for one hour and developed with chemiluminescent reaction (VWR, 490005\u2013008).\n\nIn-vitroSARM1 NAD+hydrolase assay: human SARM1 without mitochondria targeting sequence and with N-terminal tandem StrepTag II was expressed in HEK293T cells expressing NRK1 supplemented with NR (Essuman et al., 2017) and purified with MagStrep (Strep-Tactin) type 3 XT beads suspension (IBA Lifesciences). The purified protein attached on beads was incubated with NAD+(10 \u03bcM forFigure 5 B,Cand 50 \u03bcM forFigure 5A) for 0, 5, 15, and 30 minutes at 25\u00b0C in the presence or absence of various concentrations of NMN, NaMN, or NMN plus NaMN that were preincubated with SARM1 before NAD+addition. Metabolites were extracted with the chloroform/methanol method, lyophilized, and measured by HPLC as previously described (Essuman et al., 2017).\n\nSaturation-transfer difference (STD) NMR: both hSARM1 and dSARM1 ARM were produced as per Figley et al (Figley et al., 2021), and STD NMR was performed in a similar fashion as described previously (Figley et al., 2021). Briefly, samples for STD NMR were prepared in a total volume of 200 \u03bcl, with each sample consisting of 175 \u03bcl HBS buffer, 20 \u03bcL D2O, and 5 \u03bcl DMSO-d6. STD NMR spectra were acquired with a Bruker Avance 600 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with1H/13C/15N triple resonance cryoprobe at 298 K. The pulse sequence STDDIFFGP19.3, built-in within the TopSpin\u2122 program (Bruker), was employed to acquire STD NMR spectra (Mayer and Meyer, 1999). This pulse sequence consists of a 3\u20139-19 water suppression pulse, the parameters of which were obtained from the water suppression pulse program (P3919GP), to suppress the resonance from H2O. The on-resonance irradiation was set close to protein resonances at 0.8 ppm, whereas the off-resonance irradiation was set far away from any protein or ligand resonances at 300 ppm. A relaxation delay of 4 s was used, out of which a saturation time of 3 s was used to irradiate the protein with a train of 50 ms Gaussian shaped pulses. The number of scans was 512. All spectra were processed by TopSpin (Bruker) and Mnova 11 (Mestrelab Research).\n\nCrystallization and crystal structure determination: Crystallization of dSARM1 ARM (residues 315\u2013678) was performed as previously described (Figley et al., 2021). The crystals were soaked in 1.7 M sodium malonate (pH 5.8) with 20 mM NaMN (Sigma, N7764) at 18 \u00b0C overnight, protected with Paratone-N and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected using the wavelength of 0.95373 \u00c5 at the Australian Synchrotron MX2 beamline (Arag\u00e3o et al., 2018) and processed with the program autoPROC (Vonrhein et al., 2011). The structure (PDB: 7RTC) was determined using the molecular replacement approach, with the ligand-free dSARM1ARM (PDB: 7LCY) structure as a search model using Phaser (McCoy et al., 2007), and refined and manually (re)-built using phenix.refine (Afonine et al., 2012) and Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004), respectively."

    "Methods": "Female rats (n= 8/group) were housed in EE one week before and one week during exposure to water avoidance stress (WAS) while controls were housed in standard cages (SH). One day after the final WAS exposure, colonic and somatic sensitivity were assessed by the visceromotor response (VMR) to colorectal distension (CRD) and withdrawal threshold elicited by an electronic von Frey on the hind paw of the rats respectively. All rats were returned to SH for 3 weeks before colonic and somatic sensitivity were reassessed on day 28. The rats were then immediately euthanized and the spinal cord was collected to assess changes in neuronal activation (assessed via ERK phosphorylation) in response to noxious CRD. A separate cohort of animals (n= 8/group) that did not undergo behavioral assessments was euthanized the day after the final WAS exposure and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) was collected to investigate WAS and EE induced epigenetic changes at the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) promoter. The colon from these rats was also collected to assess colonic permeability via changes in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in vitro."

Animals were housed with two other littermates, food and water ad libitum, temperature maintained between 20\u00a0\u00b0C and 25\u00a0\u00b0C, artificial illumination established to light-on at 8:00\u00a0h., and light-off at 20\u00a0h., and bedding changed three times per week. For immunohistochemistry, rats were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital 63\u00a0mg/kg; when eyelid reflex was abolished, the animals were perfused transcardially with 0.9% NaCl solution followed by 0.1\u00a0M phosphate buffer (PB, pH\u00a07.4) containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 15%\nv\n/v of a saturated picric acid solution. The brains were quickly removed and thoroughly washed with PB. Sagittal 70\u00a0\u03bcm sections through the whole mediolateral span were obtained with a vibratome (Leica VT1000S, Germany). All animals were handled according to the guidelines and requirements of the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th edition) and the Mexican Official Norm for Use, Care and Reproduction of Laboratory Animals (NOM-062-ZOO-1999). Experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the local Research and Ethics Committee (CIEFM-062-2016).\n\n2.2. Immunohistochemistry\nFor immunoperoxidase staining for ACE2, sagittal serial sections (at intervals of 140\u00a0\u03bcm) were selected from two rats. Sections were first blocked against unspecific labeling through incubation in 10% normal donkey serum (NDS) in 0.05\u00a0M Trizma buffer, with 0.9% NaCl and 0.3% Triton X-100 (TBST), at room temperature (RT) for two hours. Primary antibody rabbit anti-ACE2 (ab15348, 1:1000, Abcam, MA, USA, see also\nTable 1\nfor antibody information) was used, diluted in TBST +1% NDS during 48\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with gentle shaking. After being washed with TBST, sections were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, 711\u2013035-152, PA, USA) for 2\u00a0h. at RT. Sections were washed with 0.1\u00a0M\u00a0PB, and immunoreaction was chromogenically developed using 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich, D5637, MO, USA) and H\n2\nO\n2\nas substrates. Negative control sections were processed without adding the primary antibody. Finally, slices were mounted on glass slides, dehydrated with ethanol, transferred to xylene, and cover-slipped using Permount mounting medium.

After this blocking step, sections were incubated for 48\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with cocktails of primary antibodies against ACE2 and combinations of the following markers: calretinin (CR, a calcium-binding protein with a high expression in several nuclei of the brainstem and the olfactory bulb); the glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2, a marker of glycinergic neurons, highly expressed in the pontomedullary region of the brain); tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, a marker for catecholaminergic neurons), tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH, a marker for serotoninergic neurons); AVP-neurophysin (a marker for vasopressinergic neurons); neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN, a pan-neuronal marker); von Willebrand Factor (vWF, a marker for endothelial cells) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, a marker for astrocytes). See\nTable 1\nfor details about the antibodies used in this study. After primary antibody incubation, the sections were washed three times in TBST and incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies (see\nTable 1\n). Finally, sections were washed thoroughly in TBS and mounted on glass slides with Vectashield antifade mounting medium (Vector, H1000, CA, USA). The DAB-developed slices were observed with an Olympus CX31 light microscope. Panoramic reconstructions of chromogenic developed sections were obtained with a Zeiss AxioZoom V.16 microscope. Fluorescent images were obtained using a Zeiss confocal LSM 880.\n\n2.3. Quantification of ACE2 expression by optical intensity measurement in immunofluorescence photomicrographs\nUsing the whole-brain digitally scanned images of the chromogenically developed slides, we identified regions of high vascularization. A confocal fluorescence image was obtained from similar regions in the adjacent sections that were processed for immunofluorescence. Laser intensity, Airy disk diameter, detector gain, offset, and exposure time parameters were fixed between photomicrographs. Images were obtained in an 8bit format. Thus the possible values for each pixel ranged from \u201c0\u201d (no light) to \u201c255\u201d (maximum possible value). To calculate the optical intensity (O.I.) from the light emitted at a determined region of interest (ROI), the average O.I. of the pixels in a square 2500\u00a0\u03bcm\n2\narea within the ROI was measured with the program ZEN lite 3.1 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Germany). The average O.I. value of the background was calculated from five regions with no tissue, thus only obtaining the value from the glass slide and mounting medium. This background value was subtracted from the value obtained in the ROIs. Finally, O.I. values were standardized, assigning 10 relative fluorescence intensity units to the main olfactory bulb (the region with the highest measured O.I.)."

    "Methods": "All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Florida and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and complied with all standards set forth in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Rats were double-housed and maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with access to food and waterad libitum.\n\n2.1. Experimental groups\nOur primary goal was to assess the impact of chronic C2Hx on phrenic motor neuron survival post-injury. Thus, intrapleural injections of the monosynaptic retrograde tracer CtB were performed in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (~300 grams, Envigo, Indianapolis IN, Colony 208A, University of Florida) to enable the precise identification of phrenic motor neurons in the cervical spinal cord (\nFigure 1A\n). Fourteen days after tracer injections, rats were randomized to one of four groups: 1) spinal intact (no surgery/injury) 2-week time controls (n=7); 2) spinal intact 8-week time controls (n=7); 3) 2-weeks post-C2Hx (n=8); and 4) 8-weeks post-C2Hx (n=9).\nFigure 1: Experimental Model.\nOpen in a new tab\nA.\nSchema depicting the experimental timeline. All rats received bilateral intrapleural injections of CtB. Two weeks after injection, rats were randomized to one of four groups: 2-wk intact, 8-wk intact, 2-wk C2Hx, or 8-wk C2Hx. Rats were sacrificed at the pre-determined end-point and cervical spinal tissues processed for CtB, NeuN, and ChAT immunohistochemistry.\nB.\nSchema depicting intrapleural tracer injection methods. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5%) while under hypercapnic conditions (FICO\n2\n=7.1%, FIO\n2\n=20.8%, balance N\n2\n). Bilateral intrapleural injections of CtB were administered, isoflurane was withdrawn, and animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia while remaining under hypercapnic normoxia.\n\n2.2. Intrapleural CtB injections\nThe basic methods for intrapleural CtB injections were adapted from previously published reports (\nAllen et al., 2018\n;\nMantilla et al., 2009\n;\nNichols et al., 2015b\n) as described in\nFigure 1B\n. Briefly, anesthesia was induced with 2.5% isoflurane (in 100% O\n2\n) and maintained at 2% via nose cone. Based on findings from an initial study (\nFig. 2\n), intrapleural tracer injections were performed under hypercapnic conditions (FICO\n2\n=7.1%, FIO\n2\n=20.8%, balance N\n2\n) to increase breathing, and maximize retrograde labeling of the phrenic motor pool (increased motor neuron activity and/or greater CtB mixing in the pleural space). Upon transfer to the nose cone (\nFigure 1B\n), all rats were exposed to hypercapnic normoxia (FICO\n2\n=7.1%, FIO\n2\n=20.8%, balance N\n2\n) during and after intrapleural injections to maximize retrograde labelling of phrenic motor neurons with CtB. 12.5 \u03bcL of CtB (0.2% w/v CtB; dissolved in sterile H\n2\nO; Calbiochem, Billerica, MA) was loaded into a 25 \u03bcL Hamilton syringe attached to a 9.52 mm sterile needle (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV; syringe: 7636-01, needle: 7804-04). Injections were administered bilaterally (2 \u00d7 12.5 \u03bcL = 25\u03bcL total per animal) at the 5\nth\nintercostal space at a depth of approximately 6 mm. Following injections, isoflurane was discontinued, and rats were placed in Plexiglas chambers to recover from anesthesia while under the same hypercapnic normoxic conditions for 15 minutes. Rats were monitored closely for any signs of respiratory distress; however no such signs were observed.\nFigure 2. Validation of Modified Intrapleural Injection Methods to Optimize Retrograde Labeling of Phrenic Motor Neurons with Cholera toxin B.\nOpen in a new tab\nIn preliminary experiments, we validated improved intrapleural CtB tracing methods in spinal intact rats by comparing phrenic motor neuron labelling after injections delivered under isoflurane anesthesia with either poikilocapnic (n=7; FICO\n2\n=0%, FIO\n2\n=100%; white bars) or hypercapnic conditions (n=7; FICO\n2\n=7.1%, FIO\n2\n=20.8%, balanced N\n2\n; gray bars) using previously published methods (\nNichols et al., 2013\n;\nNichols et al., 2017\n;\nNichols et al., 2015a\n). Briefly, transverse sections from the C4 spinal cord were dual labeled for CtB and NeuN. Tissues were incubated in primary antibodies (goat anti-CtB (1:2000); mouse anti-NeuN (1:500)) overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 594 (donkey anti-goat 594; 1:1000); 488 (donkey anti-mouse 488; 1:1000) for 2 hours at room temperature. The total number of phrenic motor neurons within the C4 region was extrapolated from manual phrenic motor neuron cell counts from six C4 sections per animal (left and right phrenic motor neuron counts were not different from each other, and thus were averaged together for each section for extrapolation); briefly, we divided the total C4 segment length (2000 \u03bcm) by the thickness of each section (40 \u03bcm), and multiplied by the average number of phrenic motor neurons per animal.\nA.\nRepresentative images depict CtB labeling in the cervical spinal ventral horn from isoflurane anesthetized normocapnia and hypercapnia treated rats. (4x with a 20x inset of the phrenic motor pool; Scale bar at 4x = 400\u03bcm, 20x = 50\u03bcm. We observed increased CtB-labelling with injections performed under hypercapnia vs. normocapnia (*p<0.001).\nB.\nTissue sections from these preliminary studies were also dual labeled with NeuN and manually counted by a blinded observer. The number of large, NeuN-labelled neurons was not different between groups (normocapnia: 307\u00b113, hypercapnia: 320\u00b118; data not shown). Thus, the ratio of CtB-labelled to NeuN-labelled cells was increased by hypercapnia (normocapnia: 0.60\u00b10.04; hypercapnia 0.85\u00b10.02; p<0.001), suggesting improved CtB labelling efficiency of phrenic motor neurons. Data were analyzed using Student\u2019s\nt\ntest. Differences were considered significant if p< 0.05. Data are displayed as mean\u00b1SEM.\n\n2.3. Surgical preparation\nAnesthesia methods and surgical preparation have been previously described (\nDougherty et al., 2012\n;\nGonzalez-Rothi et al., 2015b\n). Briefly, anesthesia was induced with isoflurane (2.5% in 100% O\n2\n) and maintained via nose cone for the duration of the surgical procedure (2\u20132.5% isoflurane in 100% O\n2\n). Adequate anesthesia was confirmed by the absence of toe pinch and palpebral responses. Body temperature was maintained at 36.5\u201337.5\u00b0C with a heating pad. Artificial tears were applied, nails clipped, and the surgical site shaved and prepped.\n\n2.4. Cervical hemisection\nC2Hx methods have been described previously (\nDougherty et al., 2012\n;\nGonzalez-Rothi et al., 2015b\n). Briefly, after anesthetic induction and pre-operative preparation, a dorsal cervical incision was made from the base of the skull to C3, and the skin and dorsal paraspinal muscles were separated to expose the C2 spinous process. The spinal cord was exposed at C2 via dorsal laminectomy. A lateralized hemisection was performed on the left side of the spinal cord just caudal to the dorsal C2 spinal nerve roots using a microscalpel followed by gentle aspiration. After confirming completeness of the C2Hx injury, the dura and overlying muscles were sutured (9\u20130 and 4\u20130 sutures, respectively), and the skin closed with stainless steel wound clips. After surgery, rats were administered buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg, Hospira, IL), meloxicam (2 mg/kg, Portland, ME) and lactated Ringer\u2019s (5mL) subcutaneously for pain management and fluid replacement. Intact rats in control groups did not undergo any surgical procedures.\nFollowing surgery, rats were housed in a heated incubator overnight, then returned to their home cages the following day. Subsequent post-operative care and monitoring was provided twice per day (AM/PM) until rats were fully upright, gaining weight, and displaying no overt signs of pain or distress. Pain was managed by administering buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg, 2x/day, Hospira, IL) and meloxicam (2 mg/kg, Portland, ME) subcutaneously for 72 hours post-injury. Rats received subcutaneous injections of lactated Ringers (5 mL/day) and were manually fed a nutritional supplement (Diet Gel Boost; Clear H\n2\nO; Westbrook, ME) until volitional drinking and eating resumed. Nutritional supplement and chow were provided at the bottom of home cages to ensure food was easily accessible to injured rats.\n\n2.5. Tissue Preparation\nRats were sacrificed at either 2- or 8-weeks post-C2Hx (or the equivalent time point in spinal intact controls). Rats were anesthetized and perfused intracardially with cold 0.1M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), followed by paraformaldehyde (4% w/v in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.4). The spinal cord was removed from the vertebral column and post-fixed in paraformaldehyde overnight. Spinal cords were cryoprotected in 20% sucrose solution in 0.1M PBS for 3 days, followed by 30% sucrose solution in 0.1M PBS for 3 days. The cervical spinal cord (C3\u20137) was sectioned longitudinally (40 \u03bcm) using a freezing microtome (Leica SM2000R, Buffalo Grove, IL) and individual tissues placed sequentially into cell culture wells. Sections were stored in antifreeze solution at \u221220\u00b0C until processed (30% glycerol, 30% ethylene glycol, 40% 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4.).\n\n2.6. Immunolabeling\nImmunofluorescence was used to identify CTB-positive phrenic motor neurons in the cervical spinal cord of spinal intact and C2Hx rats. Manual counts of CtB-positive phrenic motor neurons were conducted in all tissue sections. All tissue sections were processed for visualization of CtB, with a subset of these tissues co-labeled with antibodies to NeuN (1 out of every 4 sections) and the remaining co-labeled with antibodies to ChAT (3 out of 4 sections). The antibody used against CtB (goat, Millipore Cat# 227040, RRID:AB_211712) recognizes the B subunit of Cholera toxin. Goat anti-CtB does not bind to any protein if CtB has not been introduced to the animal (\nSeven et al., 2018\n). The antibody used for ChAT (rabbit, Millipore Cat# AB143, RRID:AB_2079760) has been validated in conditional ChAT knockout mice (\nYoung et al., 2008\n). The antibody for NeuN clone A60 (rabbit, Millipore Cat# ABN78, RRID:AB_10807945) has been used extensively and targets most neurons (\nMullen et al., 1992\n;\nWolf et al., 1996\n).\nTissue sections were washed 3 \u00d7 5 minutes with 0.1M PBS and then incubated in a blocking solution (10% NDS in 0.1M TBS-Triton (0.1%), pH 7.4; SD32\u20130500, Equitech-Bio, Inc, Kerrville, TX) for 1 hour at room temperature. Tissues were then incubated in primary antibody solution (3% NDS in 0.1M TBS-Triton (0.1%), pH 7.4) with goat anti-CtB (1:2500), and either rabbit anti-ChAT (1:100), or rabbit anti-NeuN (1:500) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The following day, tissues were washed 3 \u00d7 5 minutes with 0.1M TBS-Triton (0.1%) and then incubated in secondary antibody solution (3% NDS in 0.1M TBS-Triton (0.1%), pH 7.4) with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 (A-21206, 1:1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and 594 (A212207, 1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 2 hours at room temperature to label CtB and ChAT or NeuN, respectively. Tissues were then washed 3 \u00d7 5 minutes with 0.1M TBS and mounted on positively charged slides using VectaShield Hardset mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, UK) and then coverslipped. Slides were stored at 4\u00b0C until staining was assessed. Control experiments included incubating tissues without primary or secondary antibodies. Tissues were processed slightly differently in the initial, pilot study to test the impact of hypercapnia on phrenic motor neuron labeling (see figure legend\n2\n).\n\n2.7. Image acquisition\nAll longitudinal tissue sections were imaged using an epifluorescent microscope with 10x magnification (Keyence BZ-X700, Keyence Corporation of America, Itasca, IL). For tissues dual labelled with CtB and ChAT, a GFP filter was used for CtB (OP-87763; 0.43 seconds) and a Texas Red filter was used for ChAT (OP-87765; 0.10 seconds). For tissues dual labelled with CtB and NeuN, a GFP filter was used for CtB (OP-87763; 0.59 seconds) and a Texas Red filter for NeuN (OP-87765; 0.33 seconds). All image sets (CtB+ChAT and CtB+NeuN) were collected with the same exposure time setting and no binning was performed. Separate investigators imaged and analyzed data, to ensure injury and time-point remained blinded until analyses completion.\n\n2.8. Image analysis\nCtB-positive phrenic motor neurons were manually counted from single plane 10x images in all longitudinal cervical tissue sections. During tissue blocking, the right side of the cervical spinal cord was marked to ensure accurate determination of \u201cside\u201d during imaging and analyses. Only CtB-labelled neurons with a visible nucleus were counted in order to minimize double counting of labelled neurons. Data were expressed as number of cells.\nIn addition to manual counts of all CtB labelled neurons, we assessed expression of two proteins commonly used to identify neurons (NeuN) and more specifically motor neurons (ChAT) within CtB-labelled phrenic motor neurons. Optical density of ChAT or NeuN expression was measured within CtB-labelled phrenic motor neurons using semi-automatic quantification software (Keyence Hybrid Cell Count, Keyence Corporation of America, Itasca, IL). This algorithm identified CtB-positive phrenic motor neuron soma and quantified the optical density of ChAT or NeuN immunoreactivity within each soma. Data were expressed as arbitrary units (a.u.).\nGroup data were averaged and expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean. data were analyzed using three-way Mixed Model ANOVA with repeated measures (independent variables: injury, time-point and side relative to injury as the repeated measure). Statistical analyses were performed using SAS JMP (Cary, NC). Differences were considered significant if p<0.05."

    "Methods": "4.1. Lentivirus\npLenti-GIII-CMV-RFP-2A-Puro lentiviral vector with Nkx6.1-RFP (9947 bps) gene insert was purchased from Applied Biological Materials Inc. (Cat. #\nLV476460\n). The expression of Nkx6.1 and RFP is under the control of the promoter of CMV and SV40, respectively. The presence of a gene in the lentiviral vector was verified using PCR followed by gel electrophoresis. A lentiviral vector expressing only RFP was used as a negative control (lenti-Ctrl-RFP). Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293T) cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% nonessential amino acid (NEAA), and 1% Glutamax. Once the HEK293T cells were about 50%\u201360% confluent, they were transfected with target vector (lenti-Nkx6.1-RFP or lenti-Ctrl-RFP), envelope plasmid (pMD2.G/VSVG, Addgene 12259), and 3rd generation packaging plasmids (pMDLg/pRRE, Addgene 12251 and pRSV-Rev, Addgene 12253). The virus-containing supernatant was collected at two- and four-days post-transfection. Once all supernatant was collected on day two, fresh media was added to the cells. Viral particles were concentrated by polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG6000) method(\nKutner et al., 2009\n) and titer was determined by infecting HEK293T cells (\nKutner et al., 2009\n).\n\n4.2. Lateral hemisection spinal cord injury (SCI) and lentivirus injection\nAll experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the Institutional Biosafety Committee at Rutgers University. All animal work was conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations of the IACUC. Young adult C57BL/6 mice (8\u201312 weeks-old) were used for this study. Mice (both males and females) were kept at a 12-h light/dark cycle and were blindly and randomly chosen for each treatment condition. Animals were divided into the following groups (3 animals/group): (1) the sham group (the skin and muscle were cut to expose the spine, but SCI was not performed), (2) mice received SCI and lenti-Ctrl-RFP treatment (SCI + Ctrl), and (3) mice received SCI and lenti-Nkx6.1-RFP treatment (SCI + Nkx6.1). For SCI groups, a lateral hemisection was performed by first exposing the spinal cord around T9-T10 by laminectomy and then laterally cut on the left side of the spinal cord from the midline to the end. Immediately after the SCI, two injections of 1.0 \u03bcl of lentiviral particles (1 \u00d7 10\n7\nTU/ml) each at ~1 mm rostral and caudal to the lesion site, respectively. The needle was kept in place for 2\u20133 min after the injection to avoid backflow and allow virus diffusion into the tissue. The wound was then sealed by stitching the muscle and 2\u20133 clips on the skin. After surgery, animals from all three groups subcutaneously received painkiller (1 mg/kg Meloxicam) and antibiotics (50 mg/kg Cefazoline). Completeness of the hemisection was determined by the observation of paralysis in the left hind limb at the day-post injury (0 DPI) and 1 DPI.\n\n4.3. Behavioral/locomotor assessment\nLocomotion behavior of each animal was evaluated based on the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) from an open field test (\nBasso et al., 2006\n). BMS scale ranges from 0 (completely paralyzed) to 9 (normal). The BMS score assessment was given 4 min of observation per animal by three independent observers who are blinded to the type of treatment. The BMS assessment was performed once before the surgery and then twice a week until 56 DPI.\n\n4.4. Tissue processing\nSpinal cord tissues were harvested at 3, 14, 35, and 56 DPI (n = 3/group/time point). At each time point, mice were intracardially perfused with 1\u00d7 (v/v) sterile phosphate buffer saline followed by 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA). About 5\u20136 mm of the spinal cord tissue containing the injury and injection sites was removed and fixed overnight with 4% PFA. The next day, fixed tissue was washed with 1\u00d7 PBS and transferred to 30% (w/v) sucrose for dehydration for about 24 h. Dehydrated tissue was embedded using Tissue-Tek\u00ae optimum cutting temperature (O.C.T.) and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. At each time point, tissues were sectioned on the sagittal plane at 12 \u03bcm thickness using a cryostat (ThermoScientific).\n\n4.5. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)\nIHC was performed based on a previously established protocol with minor modifications (\nLi et al., 2016\n). The sections were treated with cold methanol for 10 mins at room temperature, followed by incubating samples with blocking solution (0.05% Triton X-100, 2% donkey serum, and 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)) to reduce background signal. Then, samples were incubated with primary antibodies (\nTable S1\n) in 1\u00d7 (v/v) phosphate buffer saline (PBS) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The next day, samples were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies (\nTable S1\n) for 1 h at room temperature. Lastly, samples were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS and incubated with DAPI (200 ng/ml) for 5 mins followed by the final wash and the slides were sealed with Cytoseal 60 (ThermoFisher Scientific 8310\u20134).\n\n4.6. Image analysis\nFor image analysis, at least five sections from each slide (each with different antibodies)/animal were analyzed. Images were captured at the same exposure and threshold, and at the same intensity per condition using Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope or Zeiss AxioVision Imager A.1. The automatic cell counter in ImageJ (\nRueden et al., 2017\n;\nSchneider et al., 2012\n) was used to count the total number of cells. Colabeled cells with cell type-specific markers and viral marker RFP were counted manually in separate RGB channels and with the following stereological considerations: 1) systematic and random sampling; 2) calculation of total cell numbers instead of signal densities, 3) counting of cells with aid from DAPI staining, not cell profiles, and 4) specific staining to identify the cells of interest. Data were presented as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance between two conditions was calculated by Student's\nt\n-test and multi-group comparisons were performed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey post-hoc test. A\np\n-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n4.7. RNA isolation\nFor RNA isolation, about 5 mm small region of the spinal cord tissue (containing the injury and the injection site) were extracted at 3 and 35 DPI, to reduce the heterogeneity due to the treatment and no treatment. At least 3 samples for each condition per timepoint were harvested. Total RNA from spinal cord tissue was preserved by fast freezing the tissue samples in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated from spinal cord tissue using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini kit (Qiagen, #74804) using the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was treated with DNase I (Qiagen) to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. The concentration and the quality of the total RNA were determined by NanoDrop Lite Spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific).\n\n4.8. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis\nFrom the total RNA, complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, #18080051) using the manufacturer's protocol. qPCR was performed with Power SYBR\u2122 Green PCR Master Mix and gene-specific primers (\nTable S2\n) using StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystem). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a housekeeping gene. The Livak method was used to calculate the fold change of SCI + Ctrl and SCI + Nkx6.1 groups normalized to the sham group.\n\n4.9. Library preparation and RNA-seq analysis\nQuality control of the total RNA (using RNA 6000 Nano chip on the 2100 Bioanalyzer), library preparation (Illumina MiSeq) and RNA-Seq were performed by Admera Health (South Plainfield, NJ). The RNA-Seq was performed at 3 DPI and 35 DPI (n = 3/group/time point) using Illumina MiSeq using the manufacturer's protocol. Each sample was sequenced as paired-end (2 \u00d7 150 bp) on the Illumina MiSeq platform and generated a total of 40 million reads per sample.\nQuality of the raw fastq file was assessed using the FastQC (\nhttp://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/\n). Once the sample passed quality control (QC) all sequences were aligned to the mouse reference genome, mm10, using STAR (version 2.0;\nDobin et al., 2013\n). The raw read counts were assembled as a matrix using HTSeq (version 0.6.0;\nAnders et al., 2015\n) and normalized using the DESeq2 (\nAnders and Huber, 2010\n;\nLove et al., 2014\n), a R/Bioconductor package. Next, DESeq2 was used to call for differential expressed gene (DEGs;\np\n< 0.05) from the count matrix. The downstream pathway analysis was carried out using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN, Inc.,\nhttps://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis\n;\nKramer et al., 2014\n)."

    "Methods": "2.1. Study approval\nAll animal protocols were approved by the Institutional of Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Chicago, in accordance with National Institute of Health guidelines.\n\n2.2. Animals\nMice were housed in AAALAC-approved facilities with a 12 h/12-h light-dark cycle and ad libitum to food and water. Male and female mice (P40 to P70, maintained on a C57BL/6 background) were exposed to either room air (control) or 9.5 \u00b1 0.5 days of IH (IH\n10\n). Unless explicitly stated, no sex-based differences were observed throughout the experiments conducted here.\n\n2.3. IH protocol\nAs previously described (\nPeng and Prabhakar, 1985\n), the IH paradigm was executed during the light cycle and lasted for 8 \u00b1 1 h per day of IH exposure. A single hypoxic cycle was achieved by flowing 100% N\n2\ninto the chamber for approximately 60 s. This created a hypoxic environment where the nadir O\n2\nchamber reached 4.5 \u00b1 1.5% for 8.5 \u00b1 1.5 s immediately followed by an air break (19 \u00b1 2.5% O\n2\n; 300 s). In a subset of experiments, in vivo treatment with MnTMPyP was performed where mice were treated daily with the cell-permeable superoxide anion scavenger, manganese (III) tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin (MnTMPyP, 5 mg kg\n\u22121\n) via intraperitoneal injection throughout the exposure to IH.\n\n2.4. Slice preparation for electrophysiology\nAcute hippocampal slices were prepared from (P40-P70) unexposed to IH (control) or from mice exposed to IH\n10\n. Tissue harvest occurred within 1 day following the end of IH\n10\nexposure. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized by rapid decapitation. The brain was rapidly harvested and blocked, rinsed with cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and mounted for vibratome sectioning. The mounted brain tissue was submerged in aCSF (4 \u00b0C; equilibrated with 95% O\n2\n, 5% CO\n2\n) and coronal cortico-hippocampal brain slices (350 \u03bcm thick) were prepared. Slices were immediately transferred into a holding chamber containing aCSF equilibrated with 95% O\n2\n, 5% CO\n2\n(at 20.5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C). Slices were allowed to recover a minimum of 1 h prior to the transfer into recording chamber and were used up to 8 h following tissue harvest. The composition of aCSF (in mM):118 NaCl, 10 Glucose, 20 sucrose, 25 NaHCO3, 3.0 KCl, 1.5 CaCl\n2\n, 1.0 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\nand 1.0 MgCl\n2\n. The osmolarity of aCSF was 305\u2013315 mOsm and equilibrated with 95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n, the pH was 7.42 \u00b1 2. Recordings were made at 30 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C in 95% O\n2\n5% CO\n2\n. The composition of Mg\n2+\nfree aCSF (in mM): 119.5 NaCl, 10 glucose, 20 sucrose, 25 NaHCO\n3\n, 3.0 KCl, 1.5 CaCl\n2\n, 1.0 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n.\n\n2.5. Extracellular recording of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP)\nThe extracellular recording of the fEPSP was established in aCSF (31.0 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C, equilibrated with 95% O\n2\n5% CO\n2\n) superfused and recirculated over the preparation. The stimulation electrode, a custom constructed bipolar electrode composed of twisted Teflon coated platinum wires (wire diameter:127 \u03bcm, catalog number 778000, AM Systems.), was positioned in the Schaffer Collateral and recording electrode (1\u20132 M\u03a9) was placed into the stratum radiatum of the CA1. The intensity of the electrical current (100\u2013400 \u03bcA; 0.1\u20130.2 ms duration) was set to the minimum intensity required to generate the 50% maximal fEPSP and evaluate pared-pulse ratio. To examine the unpotentiated fEPSP was evoked at 100 \u03bcA to 700 \u03bcA and examined in aCSF, Mg\n2+\nfree aCSF, Mg\n2+\nfree aCSF with DNQX [30 \u03bcM] (Tocris, MN), Mg\n2+\nfree aCSF with DTT [0.7 mM] (Sigma-Aldrich, MN) and Mg\n2+\nfree aCSF with D-AP5 (20 \u03bcM) (Sigma-Aldrich, MN).\nThe fEPSP was evoked every 20 s. After 10 min of recording the baseline fEPSP, LTP was induced using High Frequency Stimulation (HFS: four 500 msec trains of stimuli (100 Hz) given at 30 s intervals; LTP\nHFS\n) or Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS: four trains of 10 bursts at 5 Hz, each burst was comprised four pulses at 100 Hz; LTP\nTBS\n). LTD was induced by Low Frequency Stimulation (LFS: 900 individual pulses delivered at 1 Hz, LTD\nLFS\n). Metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) dependent LTD was induced by either Pair-Pulse Low Frequency Stimulation (PP-LFS: PPF-LFS 900 paired pulses (interpulse interval = 50 msec) delivered at 1 Hz, LTD\nPP-LFS\n). LTD can also be induce pharmacologically through the activation of mGluR by the group 1 selective agonist (\nRS\n)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglicine (DHPG, 100 \u03bcM, Tocris, MN) for 10 min. Following stimulation, recordings continued for up to 1 h. The fEPSP slope was normalized to baseline values. D-AP5 (20 \u03bcM, Sigma-Aldrich, MN) was used to block NMDAr; Nifedipine (30 \u03bcM, Tocris, MN) was used to block voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC, Tocris, MN); and AIDA (250 \u03bcM, Tocris, MN) was used to block mGluR group 1. The paired pulse response of the unpotentiated fEPSP was evaluated at interpulse intervals ranging from 20 msec to 500 msec. The current stimulus was set at the minimum current value (150 to 250 \u03bcA) required to evoke the initial fEPSP at 50% the maximal value.\nTo obtain the NMDAr-mediated field EPSP (fEPSP\nNMDAr\n), the fEPSP, first established in aCSF, was transitioned to into Mg\n2+\nfree aCSF where DNQX (30 \u03bcM, Tocris, MN) and picrotoxin (10 \u03bcM, Tocris, MN) were applied to block non-NMDAr ionotropic receptors and GABA\nA\nreceptors, respectively. A NMDAr-fEPSP baseline response was collected for at least 10 min prior experimental manipulation with the chemical reductant DTT (0.7 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, MN) or MnTMPyP (25 \u03bcM, Enzo life sciences). To assess the impact of acutely manipulating redox state with DTT or MnTMPyP on synaptic plasticity, slices were incubated in aCSF and recorded for 10 min followed by a 40 min incubation period in DTT (0.7 mM) or MnTMPyP (25 \u03bcM). During this period, the recording of the fEPSP was continued. After 40 min of in DTT or MnTMPyP, either LTP\nTBS\nor LTD\nLFS\nwere induced. The fEPSP was tracked for 60 min following the induction of synaptic plasticity.\nRecordings were made using either a Multiclamp 700B (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) or using a differential amplifier (AM system, Washington, DC, USA).\nAcquisition and post hoc analyses were performed using either Axon pCLAMP10 software suite (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Analog signals were digitized either by a BNC-2110 (National Instruments Austin, TX, USA) or by a Digi Data 1550B (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Digitized data was acquired and analyzed either in Igor Pro (Wave Metrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR, USA) or in the PLCAMP 10 software package (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA).\n\n2.6. Western immunoblot assays\nHippocampal homogenates were prepared by homogenizing either the entire formation or prepared from hippocampal slices. In both cases, the hippocampus was rapidly extracted following decapitation of anesthetized mice. Prior to homogenization of hippocampal slices, the slices were incubated in aCSF. aCSF supplemented with DTT (0.7 mM), or aCSF supplemented with MnTMPyP (25 \u03bcM) for 90 min at 30 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C in 95% O\n2\n5% CO\n2\n. Homogenization was performed in M-PER (Thermo, Waltham, CA, USA) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo, Waltham, CA, USA) in cold ice and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until used. Thawing of stored homogenate samples occurred on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 12.000 rpm for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C and the pellet was discarded. Samples were boiled for 15 min in loading buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and denatured by \u03b2-mercaptoethanol at 60 \u00b0C before loading 20\u201330 \u03bcg protein onto 4\u201320% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-FreeTM Protein Gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Electrophoresis was performed using 120 V for 120 min, then gels were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) using Transfer-Blot Turbo System (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). Later, membranes were subsequently blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% non-fat milk (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA USA) or 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, MN, USA) in Tris buffered saline (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA USA). Membranes were incubated under constant shaking with primary antibodies: rabbit anti GluN1 (1:2000, Abcam, UK), anti-mouse GluN2A (1:1000, Thermo Fisher, MA USA), anti-rabbit GluN2B (1:1000, Cell signal, MA, USA) and anti-mouse GAPDH (1: 10000, Abcam, UK). Incubations were performed at 4 \u00b0C overnight in 5% non-fat milk or BSA. After washing three times with TBS-Tween 0.2% for 15 min, the membranes were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with appropriate secondary antibodies. Finally, the membranes were washed three times with TBS-Tween 0.2% for 15 min and immunoreactive proteins were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents according to the manufacturer instructions (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA USA). Signals were captured with the ChemiDoc system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The IMAGE J image program (National Institutes of Health, USA) was used to quantify optical band intensity.\n\n2.7. TBARS assay\nA subset of mice was used exclusively for assessing lipid peroxidation. Anesthetized mice were rapidly decapitated the hippocampus was immediately extracted. Whole cell protein lysates were isolated from entire hippocampal tissues using RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher, MA USA) in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher, MA, USA) in cold ice. Protein lysates were immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen processed, stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until used, and thawed on ice when ready to be used. The amount of lipid-peroxidation was determined using a TBARS Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical, Cat#10009055, MI USA), per manufacturer instructions. Absorbance was measured between 530 and 540 nm using a plate reader. The analysis for determine MDA values was made according with per manufacturer instructions.\n\n2.8. Statistical analyses\nUnless explicitly stated otherwise, reported n-values represent the number of animals used. Changes in synaptic transmission were calculated as a percent change from baseline. Statistics were performed using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Comparisons between two groups were conducted using unpaired two-tailed\nt\n-test with Welch\u2019s correction or paired comparisons, where appropriate. The equality of variances between two groups was determined with an F test. Analyses involved comparisons beyond more than two groups were assessed by a one-way ANOVA of means followed by a Dunnett\u2019s. Unless otherwise stated, data are presented as mean \u00b1 S.E.M, and where appropriate, individual responses overlaid over the mean. Significance was defined as P < 0.05."

    "Methods": "Closed head injury model and drug treatment\nAll experiments were performed using male C57/BL6 mice (16 to 18 weeks old, 26-28gr). Mice were randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. Sham-CHI or CHI was administered as previously published (\nGrin\u2019kina et al., 2016\n). Sham-injured mice received identical anesthesia treatment without the impact procedure, therefore the sham ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were combined. Immediately after injury, recovery of righting reflex was evaluated as a measure of acute neurological function and injury severity. Injured mice were randomly assigned to drug or saline treatment groups. At 72 hours after CHI or sham-CHI, mice received an intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of MINO (22.5 mg/kg) plus NAC (75 mg/kg) in physiological saline or saline alone. Each group received two additional i.p. injections at 4 and 5 days post-injury. Sham-CHI mice only received saline treatment. All assessments done at 3 days after sham-CHI or CHI were on mice that did not receive drug or saline treatments. MINO plus NAC was prepared as previously described (\nSangobowale et al., 2018\n). All drugs were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). This study was carried out in strict accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the State University of New York-Downstate Medical Center (protocol #18-10558). Experimenters were blinded to injury or treatment status since all mice were assigned a code number upon arrival at SUNY-Downstate that was used during all determinations.\n\nBarnes Maze\nBehavioral assessment on Barnes maze (\nn\n=13-14/group) was performed as described by Sangobowale et al. (\nSangobowale et al., 2018\n). Testing began seven days after sham-CHI or CHI, after transient motor deficits in injured mice return to sham-CHI levels (\nGrin\u2019kina et al., 2016\n). For four consecutive days, each mouse received four 3-minute spatial acquisition trials with a 15-minute intertrial interval. On the 5\nth\nday, mice received a 90-second probe trial with the escape box removed. Debut video software tracked the mouse position at 10 frames per second using a webcam (Tecknet C016 720p HD) located 1.5 m above the maze. Video records were analyzed using AnyMaze software (Stoelting) by an observer blind to the experimental treatment. The average of the four daily trials was calculated to produce the primary acquisition measure of latency to find the escape box. Latency, the number of erroneous holes searched, path length and speed were measured across the training trials. The probe trial was analyzed by time spent and number of holes searched in the target quadrant. Following behavioral assessment, animals were randomly assigned to histological analyses.\n\nGolgi-Cox staining and analysis\nFourteen days after sham-CHI or CHI, mice were anesthetized with urethane (0.1 mL 40%) and whole brains were stained as described in the FD Rapid Golgi Stain kit (FD Neurotechnologies, Columbia, MD, USA). Coronal sections (180\u03bcm) were prepared on a vibratome (Leica VT 100M), mounted and stained. Z-stacks of Golgi-stained dorsal hippocampus (from Bregma \u22121.3 to \u22122.7) were obtained with a Nikon DS-U3 camera on a Nikon Eclipse Ci-L microscope and processed with NIS-Elements D 4.40.00 software. Individual CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons were analyzed that had a fully impregnated dendritic tree that was minimally obscured by the dendrites of nearby neurons. CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells meeting these criteria (10 cells per region) in each group (\nn\n=5 animals/group) were reconstructed into 3-dimensional traces using Neurolucida 360 software (Version 11.03, MBF Bioscience). NeuroExplorer software (MBF Bioscience) measured the reconstructed neurons for surface area and volume, branch morphology (total number, length, surface area and volume), and node number. Basal and apical dendritic trees were analyzed separately. Built-in convex hull analysis (NeuroExplorer, MBF Bioscience) measured neuronal volume and dendritic field size. Built-in Sholl analysis measured dendritic intersection number at 10\u03bcm intervals from the neuronal soma.\n\nDendritic spine quantification and classification\nSpines were quantified in CA1 apical dendrites proximal (<75 \u03bcm) and distal (>75\u03bcm) from the soma using NIS-Elements D 4.40.00 software. Secondary or tertiary dendritic branches were selected that did not overlap with other branches and were either parallel or at acute angles to the coronal section surface. Spine density per 10\u03bcm was assessed in at least 10 neurons and 50 branches per group (Table 7-1). Five distinct spine types (filopodia, stubby, thin, mushroom and branched) were manually sub-typed based on previously published methods (\nArellano et al., 2007\n;\nBloss et al., 2011\n;\nRisher et al., 2014\n;\nAfroz et al., 2016\n). Filopodia spines were defined as having a length of >2\u03bcm with no head; thin spines had a head/neck ration of >1:1 and a head diameter of <0.4\u03bcm; stubby spies had a length to width ratio of 1:1; mushroom spines had a head/neck ratio of >1:1 with a \u22650.4\u03bcm head width; and branched spine types contained 2 or more heads.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice (\nn\n=3-5/group) were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (3\u20135%) in oxygen (0.8 L/min) and fixed transcardially with paraformaldehyde (4%, w/v). Brain were post-fixed overnight in paraformaldehyde (4%, w/v), embedded in paraffin, and parasagittal sections (10\u03bcm) prepared 0.8-2mm from the midline (HistoWiz, Brooklyn, NY). Sections were stained with antibodies against MAP2 (Abcam, catalog #ab32454; antibody registry ID: AB 776174; rabbit polyclonal 1:500), NeuN (Abcam, catalog #ab104225; antibody registry ID: 10711153; rabbit polyclonal 1:500), synaptophysin (LifeSpanBioSciences, catalog #LS-C203763; antibody registry ID: AB 2864290; rabbit polyclonal, 1:500), and PSD-95 (Abcam, catalog #ab2723; antibody registry ID: 303248; mouse monoclonal, 1:500) with the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The specificity of each antibody binding was tested by staining adjacent regions with only primary or secondary antibodies. Sections were imaged using an Olympus Fluoview FV100 laser scanning confocal microscope using a 60x oil immersion objective and Leica Application Suite 1.8.2. Image J software measured MAP2 immunoreactivity in CA3 and CA1. Changes in MAP2 protein expression were examined separately in apical and basal dendritic trees.\n\nAnalysis of neuronal and synaptic density\nHippocampal cell density was quantified in NeuN-stained sections using stereological methods in NIH ImageJ software (\nWang et al., 2003\n;\nSun et al., 2006\n). NeuN immunopositive cells (NeuN\n+\n) were manually counted within each region in three 10\u03bcm sections beginning 0.8mm from Bregma. NeuN\n+\ncell number in each section was divided by the product of the area of counting frame and section thickness, averaged and expressed as number of neurons per mm\n3\n. Synaptic density was quantified by staining intensity and colocalization of fluorescently labeled synaptophysin and PSD-95 using the method of Chakroborty et al. (\nChakroborty et al., 2019\n) performed with Metamorph software (Version 7.1, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). A median filter was applied to background-subtracted red and green imaging channels to reduce noise, and images were set to inclusive threshold levels. Equally sized image boxes (100 \u03bcm x 100 \u03bcm) were placed over the CA1 stratum radiatum. Staining intensity was determined as the percentage of area containing puncta of synaptophysin or PSD-95, over a threshold intensity level. Colocalization was measured using the Measure Colocalization plugin and expressed as the percentage of overlap of red and green fluorescent puncta. For each image stack, staining intensity and colocalization was measured in 3 serial planes and the results were averaged.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nTwo-way repeated measures (RM) ANOVA analyzed group differences in Barnes maze latency, errors, speed and path length on the factors of group and trial for each day assessed followed by pairwise comparisons using Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. Spearman rank correlation was used for righting reflex correlation analysis. A two-level mixed-effects model analyzed Sholl analysis on the factors of distance from the soma and treatment, followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. All remaining analyses used one-way ANOVA followed by pairwise comparisons using Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism software (La Jolla, CA) with significance set at 0.05. P-values in the text are from post-hoc comparisons unless noted otherwise as from ANOVA. This study used Barnes Maze latency as a primary outcome measure. Sample size was therefore determined using MN24 dosing from the study of Sangobowale to estimate an effect size of 0.9 that results in 13 mice per group and produces an actual power of 0.95 (\nSangobowale, et al., 2018\n). Sample size was determined using G* power v. 3.1.9.6 software (Faul, F., Erdfelder, E., Buchner, A., Lang, A.-G. , Statistical power analyses using G*Power 3.1: Tests for correlation and regression analyses. Behav. Res. Meth. , 2009. 41: p. 1149-1160.) All values are reported as mean\n\u00b1\nstandard error of the mean."

    "Methods": "Human pluripotent stem cells\nHuman pluripotent stem cells were acquired from several sources. The ALS lines used \u201cC9-ALS 1\u201d (NINDS ID NDS00239 clone 3, C9ORF72 ALS, Caucasian/Ashkenazi female, age 64), \u201cC9-ALS 2\u201d (NINDS ID NDS00239 clone 5, C9ORF72 ALS, Caucasian/Ashkenazi female, age 64), \u201cSOD1-ALS 1\u201d (NINDS ID NDS00248 SOD1\nA4V\nALS, Caucasian female, age 44), \u201cTDP43-ALS 1\u201d (NINDS ID NDS00245, TARDBP\nG892A\nALS, Caucasian male, age 43), \u201cSporadic-ALS 1\u201d (NINDS ID NDS00243, Sporadic ALS, Caucasian male, age 49), \u201cSporadic-ALS 2\u201d (NINDS ID NDS00244, Sporadic ALS, Caucasian male, age 38) were received from Target ALS stem cell core at RUCDR Infinite Biologics (Piscataway Township, NY, USA). Healthy control pluripotent cell lines [human female embryonic stem cell line H9 (WA9), referred to as \u201cESC 1\u201d and human female iPSC line IMR90, referred to as \u201ciPSC 1\u201d] were from WiCell, (Madison, WI, USA). Stem cell lines were cultured according to established feeder-free protocols\n20\n,\n21\n.\n\nDifferentiation of skeletal myocytes from human pluripotent stem cells\nHuman pluripotent stem cells were differentiated into myogenic progenitors and mature skeletal myocytes according to our lab\u2019s previously established protocol\n22\n,\n23\n. Briefly, the stem cells were lifted using 2 mg/mL of dispase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or 0.1% collagenase (Life Technologies) and transferred to a flask coated with poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (polyHEMA, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) in order to grow in suspension and form spheres of expanding myogenic progenitors. The expansion medium consisted of Stemline medium (S-3194, Sigma-Aldrich) with 100 ng/mL of recombinant human FGF-2 (WiCell), 5 \u03bcg/mL of heparin sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (PSA; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The spheres were mechanically chopped weekly using a McIlwain tissue chopper (Mickle Laboratory Engineering, Surrey, UK).\nAfter around 6 weeks of expansion in suspension culture, the spheres were dissociated with TrypLE (Life Technologies) and plated down onto poly-L-lysine (0.1 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) and laminin (5 \u03bcg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) coated glass coverslips at a density of 200,000 cells per coverslip. At this point the cells were switched to a terminal differentiation medium consisting of DMEM/GlutaMAX (10566\u2013016, Life Technologies), 2% B-27 serum-free supplement (Life Technologies) and 1% PSA. Myocytes became fully differentiated around 2 weeks of culture in this medium and were maintained for up to 6 weeks.\n\nRNA Sequencing\nTotal RNA was isolated from cells using Direct-zol RNA Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA-seq libraries were constructed from 500 ng of total RNA using KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kits with RiboErase (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Completed libraries were quantified using D1000 ScreenTape system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and were sequenced using Hiseq 4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).\nAfter pre-filtering the raw data by removing sequence adapters and low-quality reads, paired-end 100 bp sequences were conducted to align the human genome (hg38) by HISAT2 software in a Galaxy browser (\nwww.galaxy.psu.edu\n). Transcript assembly, abundance and evaluation of differential expression were accomplished using the Cufflinks and DEseq software in a Galaxy browser. Genes exhibiting a fold change \u2265\u00b1 1.5 and FDR < 0.05 were considered differentially expressed in the cells derived from ALS patients compared to in control cells (H9 and IMR90). Gene ontology analysis, protein-protein interaction analysis, and Venn diagram visualization were performed with Metascape (\nhttp://metascape.org/\n), STRING (\nhttps://string-db.org/\n) and Venny (\nhttps://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/\n) software, respectively. The raw RNA sequencing data file can be found in the\nSupplemental Material\n.\n\nQuantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for iPSC-derived skeletal myocytes\nFirst-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 \u03bcg of total RNA using ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix with gDNA Remover (Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). qPCR was performed with FastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) using Light Cycler 96 (Roche). PCR was performed with the following thermocycling conditions: denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes and 45 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 seconds, annealing at 58 \u00b0C for 10 seconds and elongation at 72 \u00b0C for 10 seconds. Data were normalized to the expression of\nACTB\n. Primer sequences can be found in\nSupplemental Table 1\n.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nCells were fixed with ice cold methanol then permeabilized and blocked for 20 minutes with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5% normal donkey serum (NDS; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. Primary antibodies were added according to the dilutions in\nSupplemental Table 2\nand incubated at room temperature for one hour. Secondary antibodies (listed in\nSupplemental Table 3\n) were added at a dilution of 1:1000 and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Hoechst 33258 (0.5 \u03bcg/ml in PBS, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to label nuclei. Coverslips were mounted to slides using Fluoromount-G mounting medium (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL, USA).\n\nSOD1\nG93A\ntransgenic rats\nSOD1\nG93A\ntransgenic rats used in this study were maintained as previously described\n16\n,\n18\n,\n19\n,\n24\n\u2013\n27\n. All rats were housed, bred, and sacrificed in accordance with UW-Madison and NIH standards of animal care. Breeder male SOD1\nG93A\nrats were crossed with female Sprague Dawley rats (Taconic Biosciences, Germantown, NY, USA). Genotyping of SOD1\nG93A\npositive rats and wild-type (WT) controls was determined from ear punches using real-time PCR, which was performed by Transnetyx (Cordova, TN, USA). Rats were sacrificed at various disease stages including presymptomatic (Day 90), symptomatic, and end point. Disease stage was determined using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale between 0 (no movement) to 21 (normal locomotion)\n28\n. Rats were considered symptomatic with a BBB score between 17 and 12\n18\n,\n19\n,\n27\n. The average age at which rats became symptomatic was at 179.5 \u00b1 8 days (n=8 total; 188 \u00b1 7 days in female rats (n=4) and 171 \u00b1 6 days in male rats (n=4), mean \u00b1 SEM). Rats were considered to be at end point when they no longer had the reflexes to right themselves from a sideways position within 30 seconds. For each time point, an age-matched wild-type control was also sacrificed, and hindlimb (tibialis anterior, TA) muscles were harvested from each.\n\nRT-qPCR on homogenized hindlimb muscles\nTA muscles from each disease stage were homogenized using the Silent Crusher M homogenizer (Heidolph, Schwabach, Germany) and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNase treatment and reverse transcription were performed according to product instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). qPCR was performed with Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the DNA Engine Opticon 2 System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The following thermocycling conditions were used: denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 10 minutes and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 10 seconds and annealing at 60 \u00b0C for 45 seconds. Data were normalized to the expression of\nHPRT1\nand displayed as relative to the age-matched WT animals corresponding to presymptomatic SOD1\nG93A\nrats. Primer sequences can be found in\nSupplemental Table 4\n.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nTA muscles were sectioned at 20-micron thickness using a cryostat. The muscle sections were placed on a glass slide and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) in PBS for 20 minutes at room temperature. Sections were then blocked in 5% NDS in PBS for 2 hours at room temperature followed by primary antibody incubation in 5% NDS and 0.3% Triton-X 100 overnight at 4\u00b0C. Next, the sections were washed five times for 5 minutes each with PBS before adding secondary antibodies diluted in 5% NDS in PBS. The wash step was repeated, then the sections were incubated in Hoechst 33258 for 15 minutes at room temperature, followed by additional washes. The last PBS wash was removed from the slide and Fluoromount-G mounting medium was added and a glass coverslip was placed on top. NMJs were labeled using \u03b1-bungarotoxin (BTX) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647, which was added at the same time as the primary antibodies. The information and dilutions of primary and secondary antibodies can be found in\nSupplemental Table 2\nand\nSupplemental Table 3\n. While rabbit monoclonal anti-Bet1L antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific/Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) was used for most of the Bet1L immunohistochemistry, mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) was used for co-labeling with anti-NG2 antibody. In this case, the mouse antibody was identified by an antibody detection kit (Vector Fluor\n\u2122\nExcel Amplified anti-mouse IgG DyLight 488\n\u00ae\nAntibody Kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Additionally, the specificity of rabbit polyclonal anti-Bet1L antibody was tested by antigen blocking. Before staining with muscle sections, the antibody was incubated with 100x molar excess protein containing recombinant Bet1L (human Bet1L 293T cell lysate, sc-115664; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 \u00b0C overnight.\n\nImage acquisition and analysis\nFluorescent images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescent microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with a DS-QilMC CCD camera (Nikon). The three-dimensional renderings of rat NMJ immunohistochemistry were created using the z-stack feature of a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope (Leica, St Galen, Switzerland). Skeletal myocyte differentiation was quantified as previously described\n9\n. Day 14 skeletal myocytes were stained for Pax7, MyoD, Myogenin, and Myosin heavy chain (MHC). Additionally, beta-Tubulin III (TuJ1) was stained to identify the presence of neuronal cells in terminally differentiated cells. Stained cells were imaged at 6 randomly selected fields of view. The total number of nuclei and the number of nuclei within positively labeled myocytes were counted to obtain a percentage for each image.\nTo quantify the number of rat NMJs positive for Bet1L, muscle sections were labeled with BTX and a Bet1L antibody. Muscle sections were scanned using the Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescent microscope and the number of NMJs positive or negative for Bet1L were analyzed. The average number of total NMJs counted per animal was 81. Four WT and four SOD1\nG93A\nrats were counted for each time point (presymptomatic, symptomatic, and end point), leading to approximately 250 NMJs counted per condition. When analyzing Bet1L-stained NMJs, the person performing the quantification was blinded to the sample genotype and age to avoid bias.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA, USA). Graphs were presented as means \u00b1 SEM. One-way ANOVA was used to compare data points across cell lines or time points. A statistically significant one-way ANOVA was followed up with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. An unpaired Student\u2019s t-test was used when comparing only two groups. Gaussian distributions were assumed, and differences were considered significant when P<0.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Experimental design\nThis study included two cohorts of adult, male-only dystonia mouse models (D2KO and Ch2KO), each with their own respective litter-mate control group. We chose to perform this imaging investigation in male-only mice, as prior behavioral studies in several DYT1 dystonia mouse models found that only male mice had significant motor deficits (\nDang et al., 2006\n,\n2005\n;\nYokoi et al., 2020\n). We used litter-mate control groups specific to each model in order to minimize the effects of background strain and cage-to-cage variability on comparisons of mutant\nversus\ncontrol animals. Motor behavior assessment was performed on all animals and included accelerated rotarod and beam-walking tests. Three types of MRI scans were acquired for every animal: an anatomical scan, sensory-evoked fMRI, and diffusion MRI. Experimenters performing behavioral testing and magnetic resonance imaging were blind to which animals belonged to the experimental or control groups for each model. After all testing and data pre-processing was complete, animals were genotyped, and experimenters were unblinded in order to enable group-wise comparisons. Methods for each aspect of this study are described in detail in the following sections.\n\n2.2. Animals\nAll experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of Laboratory animals (NIH Publications No. 8023, revised 1978). The D2KO cohort included 21 mice with homozygous conditional knock-out of\nDyt1\nspecific to dopamine-2 receptor expressing neurons (mean age: 194.6 \u00b1 26.6 d) and 22\nDyt1\nloxP +/\u2212 or\nDyt1\nloxP \u2212/\u2212 control mice (mean age: 194.2 \u00b1 27.3 d). Generation of the D2KO mouse line has been previously described in detail (\nYokoi et al., 2020\n). The Ch2KO cohort included 20 mice with homozygous conditional knock-out of\nDyt1\nspecific to cholinergic neurons (mean age: 180.6 \u00b1 12.19) and 22\nDyt1\nloxP +/\u2212 or\nDyt1\nloxP \u2212/\u2212 control mice (mean age: 184.6 \u00b1 10.91). Generation of the Ch2KO mouse line has been previously described in detail (\nLiu et al., 2021\n). Mice were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water\nad libitum\n. All experiments were approved and monitored by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Florida and were conducted in ethical compliance with the USPHS Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\n2.3. Motor behavior tests and analysis\nLocomotor function was evaluated using accelerated rotarod (Ugo Basile) and beam-walking assessments as described previously (\nYokoi et al., 2020\n). Rotarod and beam-walking tests respectively occurred 32.0 \u00b1 13.9 d and 25.4 \u00b1 13.6 d before D2KO imaging, and 29.7 \u00b1 9.97 d and 34.33 \u00b1 17.30 d before to Ch2KO imaging. For rotarod, mice were placed on a rotating spindle with an initial speed of 4 rpm and a gradual acceleration rate of 0.2 rpm/s. Latency-to-fall time was measured with a 180 s cutoff time and final speed of 40 rpm. Mice were tested across three separate trials each day for two consecutive days (6 total trials), with a 1 h inter-trial rest period. For beam-walking, mice were trained to traverse a medium size (14 mm width) square beam across three trials each day for two consecutive days (6 total training trials). Mice were evaluated on total beam slips across the two testing sessions. Day 3 included one testing trial traversing a medium square (14 mm width) and one trial traversing a medium round beam (17 mm diameter). Day 4 included one testing trial traversing a small square (7 mm width) and one trial traversing a small round beam (10 mm diameter). All beams were 100 cm in length and total beam slips were recorded for the middle 80 cm section. For both rotarod and beam-walking tests, group differences in latency-to-fall times and total beam slips were analyzed using the non-parametric GENMOD procedure in SAS (\nDang et al., 2005\n).\n\n2.4. MRI preparation\nMice were placed under general anesthesia for the duration of imaging. Initial knock-down occurred within an enclosed chamber under brief administration of 3% isoflurane delivered by compressed air through Surgivet vaporizer (Dublin, OH) connected to a charcoal trap. Anesthesia was maintained between 1 and 1.5% for the remaining experimental duration to accommodate necessary vitals and motion considerations. Research suggests that sensory neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord that respond to noxious stimuli have relatively spared firing rates under isoflurane anesthesia (\nKim et al., 2007\n). The experimental setup for mouse imaging is displayed in\nFig. 1\n. Mice were placed in a prone position on a custom 3D printed mouse platform equipped with a bite-bar that immobilized the head and delivered anesthesia. Respiration was monitored using a respiration pad (SA Instruments, Stony Brook, NY) placed beneath the abdomen. Core body temperature was maintained using an in-house recirculating waterbed heating system and monitored\nvia\na thermal rectal probe (SA Instruments, Stony Brook, NY). A 256 mm\n2\nMR compatible advanced thermal stimulator (ATS) thermode (PATHWAY System, Medoc Advanced Medical Systems, Ramat Yishay, Israel) was affixed to right plantar hind paw, which delivered heat stimulation during imaging.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nImaging setup. Imaging was performed on an 11.1 Tesla MRI scanner with a Magnex Scientific 40 cm horizontal magnet (Bruker BioSpin, Billerica, MA). For imaging, animals were placed on a custom-designed mouse platform, which included anesthesia provided through a head stabilizer with a surface transmit/receive radio-frequency head coil. Core body temperature was maintained during imaging with a heated waterbed tube placed underneath the animal. A Medoc PATHWAY heating thermode was placed on the right hindlimb of the animal and controlled by an associated computer setup.\n\n2.5. MRI acquisition\nMRI data were acquired using an 11.1 Tesla Magnex Scientific 40 cm horizontal magnet (Agilent, Inc. Palo Alto, CA, USA) with RRI BFG-240/120-S6: bore size 120 mm, Gmax = 1000 mT/m @325A with 200 \u03bcs rise time. B\n1\nexcitation and signal detection were achieved using an in-house 2.5 \u00d7 3.5 cm quadrature surface transmit/receive mouse head coil tuned to 470.7 MHz (\n1\nH resonance) (AMRIS, University of Florida). Acquisition sequences were prepared and controlled using ParaVision, Version 6.0.1 (Bruker BioSpin, Billerica, MA).\nAnatomical T2-weighted images were acquired for spatial normalization using a turbo RARE sequence with the following parameters: TR = 5500 ms; TE = 30 ms; excitation angle = 90\u00b0; refocusing angle = 180\u00b0; dummy scans = 1; averages = 7; slices = 13; orientation = coronal; thickness = 0.9 mm; gap = 0 mm; FOV = 15 \u00d7 15 mm; data matrix = 256 \u00d7 256 in-plane.\nTwo separate sensory-evoked fMRI runs were acquired using a 2-shot EPI sequence with the following parameters: TR = 2000 ms; TE = 15 ms; repetitions = 360; flip angle = 90\u00b0; dummy scans = 2; slices = 13; coronal orientation; thickness = 0.9 mm; gap = 0 mm; FOV = 15 \u00d7 15 mm; data acquisition matrix = 64 \u00d7 64 in-plane.\nAcquisition of diffusion MRI data involved a two-shell HARDI protocol with the following parameters: TR = 4000 ms; TE = 19 ms; averages = 4; flip angle = 90\u00b0; slices = 17; orientation = coronal; thickness = 0.7 mm; gap = 0 mm; FOV = 15 \u00d7 11 mm; data matrix = 128 \u00d7 96 in-plane. The following diffusion parameters were used: two non-diffusion weighted b0 images; small shell b-value = 600 s/mm2; large shell b-value = 2000 s/mm2; directions = 52 total (six at b-value = 600 s/mm2; 46 at b-value = 2000 s/mm2).\n\n2.6. Sensory-evoked fMRI thermal stimulation\nAcquisition of sensory-evoked fMRI involved heat-induced stimulation of the right plantar hind paw. The PATHWAY System was calibrated such that thermal stimulation was applied in a block paradigm alternating between 60 s at the stimulation temperature (42 \u00b0C) and 60 s at the baseline temperature (30 \u00b0C), beginning and ending with a 30 s baseline block. The change in temperature between blocks was achieved within 300 ms\nvia\na cooling rate of 40 \u00b0C/s and a heating rate of 70 \u00b0C/s.\n\n2.7. Sensory-evoked fMRI processing and analysis\nData processing and for sensory-evoked fMRI images were performed using custom-designed UNIX shell scripts in FMRIB Software Library (FSL: Oxford, UK) and Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI;\nCox, 1996\n). Two separate analyses were performed: (1) examination of thermal stimulation induced blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response and (2) a seed-based BOLD correlation analysis to examine functional connectivity in response to the thermal stimulation. Pre-processing for each sensory-evoked fMRI run included removal of five base volumes to account for magnetization equilibrium, rigid-body volume registration, spatial co-registration of the fMRI scan to the anatomical scan of each mouse, spatial warping of each scan to an anatomical template image, and in-plane spatial smoothing with a Gaussian full width at half-maximum (FWHM) kernel of 0.5 mm\n2\n. Six head motion parameters (three rotational and three translational) were calculated and included as regressors of no-interest. The regression step also included censoring of consecutive functional volumes with more than 0.45 mm in relative motion. Six D2KO mutant and seven D2KO controls, as well as two of the controls in the Ch2KO cohort were, flagged for having high motion in more than 25% of total TRs and were removed from fMRI analyses. Processing for functional connectivity included an additional regressor of the mean CSF-related signal and bandpass filtering of the time series between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz.\nTo examine the sensory-induced BOLD activation response, the instantaneous BOLD signal at each voxel and each time-point was scaled by the average BOLD signal across its respective time-series for each mouse. The BOLD signals obtained from the baseline and stimulation blocks were modeled using a boxcar regressor convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Using 3dDeconvolve in AFNI, the regression was performed across baseline and stimulation blocks to estimate the \u03b2-coefficient and its associated t-statistic for the BOLD contrast, separately for each run. Prior to investigating brain-wide differences in brain function and connectivity, we first compared sensory-evoked BOLD response in the hindlimb region of the primary somatosensory cortex using a region-of-interest (ROI) approach. ROIs for the left and right hindlimb region of primary somatosensory cortex were manually drawn according to The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates atlas (Paxinos and Franklin, 2nd edition). The mean \u03b2-coefficient for all voxels within the hindlimb ROI was compared using a 2 (group: mutant, control) by 2 (scan: 1,2) ANOVA. We then performed a whole-brain voxelwise ANOVA of \u03b2-coefficients using a 2 (group: mutant, control) by 2 (scan: 1, 2) design. In order to limit false-positives for the whole-brain analysis, a one-sample\nt\n-test in AFNI with\nClustsim\nbootstrapping option was also performed on the control dataset from the first sensory-evoked fMRI scan to advise the cluster-extent threshold. In accordance with the advised threshold, between-group effects were considered significant (\np\n< 0.05 FWER-corrected) at a minimum cluster size of 0.07 mm\n3\n, for a\np\n-value threshold of\np <\n0.005.\nFunctional connectivity was analyzed by examining the entire sensory-evoked fMRI time-series across baseline and stimulation blocks using a seed-based correlation approach, separately for each run. A total of 16\na priori\nselected seed regions-of-interest in the striatum were used in this analysis. Seeds were manually drawn on the template image in both the right and left striatum across two in-plane coronal slices (rostral and caudal striatum) in each of the dorsolateral, dorsomedial, ventrolateral, ventromedial quadrants. The selection of the striatum as the point of origin for seed-based connectivity was based on the hypothesis that knock-out of\nDyt1\nfrom dopamine-2 receptor expressing cells (D2KO mice) and striatal cholinergic interneurons (Ch2KO mice) would disrupt sensorimotor networks of the striatum. Furthermore, a significant loss of striatal cholinergic interneurons has been observed in both models, suggesting a specific vulnerability of the striatum (\nLiu et al., 2021\n;\nYokoi et al., 2020\n). After obtaining the residual time-series, Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were computed between the time-series of the seed and that of all other brain voxels, separately for each sensory-evoked fMRI run. Correlation coefficients were converted to\nZ\n-scores using Fisher r-to-z transformations. For the group-level analysis, Z-scores were analyzed using a 2 (group: mutant, control) by 2 (run: 1, 2) whole-brain voxelwise ANOVA, separately for each seed. Results were considered significant at a cluster-extent threshold of 0.05 mm\n3\n(\np <\n0.05 FWER-corrected) based on the advised threshold for the BOLD activation analysis.\n\n2.8. Diffusion MRI processing and analysis\nData processing for diffusion MRI was performed using custom-designed Unix shell scripts in FSL and AFNI. One D2KO and two corresponding control animals, as well as one Ch2KO animal were discarded due to high motion-related image distortion in the diffusion-weighted images. The processing pipeline included eddy-current and head motion correction, compensation of diffusion gradient rotations, and skull stripping of non-brain tissue. Next, calculation of voxelwise fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps was performed using DTIFIT in FSL. The fitted FA map for each mouse was non-linearly warped to a standard FA template using the ANTs toolbox (\nAvants et al., 2010\n) and the resultant transformation matrix was applied to the MD map.\nGroup-level FA and MD effects between mutant and control animals were examined using two separate approaches. In the first analysis, FA and MD differences were examined using whole-brain independent-samples\nt\n-tests between mutant animals (D2KO, Ch2KO) and their respective control counterparts. These voxelwise t-tests were carried out using Randomise, a statistical analysis tool in FSL, with 1000 permutations and threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE;\nSmith and Nichols, 2009\n). In the second analysis, independent-samples t-tests were performed in R to examine the difference in mean FA and MD values with a set of specific regions-of-interest (ROI) selected\na priori\nbased on their relevance to DYT1 dystonia: striatum, sensorimotor cortex, thalamus, midbrain, pons, anterior medulla, posterior medulla, cerebellar cortex, and cerebellar vermis. Group effects were considered significant at\np\n< 0.05 FDR-corrected.\n\n2.9. Correlation between behavior and sensory-evoked fMRI\nSpearman rank correlations were carried out separately for each mutant cohort using Graphpad Prism (Version 8.4.1) to determine the relation between locomotor function and imaging outcomes. Significant between-group activation and connectivity clusters from the ANOVA analyses were masked to respectively compute mean \u03b2-coefficient and\nZ\n-score values for each mouse. Mean \u03b2-coefficient and Z-score values were then averaged across both sensory-evoked fMRI runs, resulting in a single value for each. \u03b2-coefficient and Z-score values were tested against average latency-to-fall times across the six trials in the rotarod assessment and total beam slips across the four total trials for the small round and square beams. The medium-sized beams yielded insufficient slips and thus were not included in this correlation analysis to avoid floor effects. We FDR-corrected for each voxel cluster in relation to behavioral tasks. BOLD activation and connectivity clusters were examined independently for each behavioral task."

    "Methods": "All animal experiments were approved by the local Animal Welfare Committee, conducted in compliance with theNational Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Use of Animals in Neuroscience Research, and are reported following the Animal Research: Reporting in Vivo Experiments guidelines.\n\nSixty-two adult male C57BL/6J mice (28\u201336 g) and 6 P0 C57BL/6J pups were used. Only male mice were used since a recent study showed that \u03b17-AChR agonism is beneficial to male and female mice after SAH (Dienel et al., 2021). Mice were housed in a humidity- and temperature-controlled room with a 12 hour light-dark cycle. Mice were givenad libitumaccess to food and water. Mice were electronically randomized into groups prior to surgery. Sample sizes were estimated with SigmaPlot 11.0 using data from previous publications, \u03b1=0.05, and \u03b2=0.2. Individuals performing functional assessment, measurement of outcomes, or data analysis were kept blinded to the experimental groups.\n\nTo examine the effects of \u03b17-AChR agonism on behavior and neuronal survival, mice (n=8/group) were allocated into sham, SAH+Vehicle (normale saline), SAH+Galantamine (\u03b17-AChR agonist, Tocris Bioscience), or SAH+Galantamine+MLA (methyllycaconitine citrate, \u03b17-AChR antagonist, Tocris Bioscience). MLA is 40-fold more selective for \u03b17-AChR than its other cholinergic receptors (\u03b14\u03b22 or \u03b16\u03b22). Neurobehavioral performance (n=8/group) was assessed one day after SAH prior to euthanasia and tissue collection for histology (n=6/group).\n\nTo test the effect of \u03b17-AChR knockout on neuronal degeneration, we utilized brain tissue from \u03b17-AChR knockout mice (subjected to either sham, SAH+Vehicle, or SAH+Galantamine in a previous study (Dienel et al., 2021) and stained for fluoro-jade C.\n\nTo study the mechanism by which galantamine reduces neuronal degeneration and improves neuronal survival, mice were allocated into either sham, SAH+Vehicle (5% mannitol), SAH+Galantamine, SAH+Galantamine+MLA, or SAH+Galantamine+BAY80-6946 (PI3K inhibitor, Selleckchem). Mice (n=6/group) were used to examine functional performance and protein expressions of the PI3K/AKT/CC3 pathway. BAY80-6946 was chosen as the antagonist for PI3K since it is 1000-fold more selective for PI3K than mTOR (FDA New Drug Application 209936). Neurobehavioral performance was assessed one day after SAH prior to euthanasia and tissue collection for Western blot.\n\nTo test the specific effect of galantamine on neuronal cells, we investigated neuronal degeneration and apoptosis using primary neuron cultures. Briefly, cortical tissues from P0 mouse pups were dissected, dissociated, and plated on tissue-culture plates (6\u00d7105/well for immunocytochemistry) coated with poly-D-lysine (A-003-E, BD Biosciences), as we have previously done (Moruno-Manchon et al., 2020). Primary cortical neurons were grown in Neurobasal Medium (A3582901, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with B-27 (A3582801, Thermo Fisher Scientific), GlutaMAX (35050061, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and penicillin-streptomycin (15070063, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cultures were grown for 15 days before being subjected to experimental conditions. Wells received MLA (1.3 \u03bcM) or saline (10 \u03bcL), then 30 minutes later were given galantamine (10 \u03bcM) or saline (0.8 \u03bcL), and then 1 hour later hemoglobin (3 \u03bcM) (Chen-Roetling and Regan, 2016) or saline (10 \u03bcL) administered. Twenty-four hours after hemoglobin administration, cells were prepared for either western blot (media removed, lysis buffer added, and then cells collected) or immunocytochemistry (fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde) (Moruno-Manchon et al., 2020).\n\nSubarachnoid Hemorrhage Model\nThe endovascular perforation model of subarachnoid hemorrhage was performed as previously described (\nDienel et al., 2020\n). Perforation was confirmed by respiratory distress. Vehicle, galantamine (0.5 mg/kg), MLA (0.1 mg/kg), and BAY80-6946 (0.1 mg/kg, 5% mannitol) were intranasally administered 1 and 8 hours post-SAH. Briefly, 5 \u03bcL was given, alternating each nostril, for a total of 30 \u03bcL with a one minute delay between administrations. Animals not recovering from surgery were excluded and replaced. Animals which recovered from surgery but did not survive until neurobehavioral testing were excluded from all analysis. After euthanasia and brain removal, the circle of Willis was observed for blood and used to confirm SAH.\n\nNeurobehavioral Performance\nAll animals underwent functional performance evaluation using a 24-point neuroscore, beam walking, T-maze, and rotarod one day post-surgery. The neuroscore test evaluates sensorimotor function (\nMatsumura et al., 2019\n). Beam walking examines the mouse\u2019s ability to traverse a round rod (\nMcBride et al., 2015\n). T-maze assesses working memory; mice were given 10 individual trials to walk to the end of a \u201cT\u201d and choose to turn into either the left or right arm. The choices for each trial were recorded and the number of spontaneous alterations (\ni.e.\nchoosing to explore a different arm from the previous trial) are reported. Rotarod tests the mouse\u2019s motor skills. Briefly, mice were trained using two trials of a constant 5 RPM. Mice were then tested using a 5 RPM starting speed with an 8 RPM acceleration and then a 5 RPM starting speed with a 16 RPM acceleration (2\u20133 trials each). Each trial was a total of 2 minutes. Animals were given a minimum of 2 minutes rest time between trials.\n\nFluoro-Jade C Staining\nBrains were sectioned at a thickness of 30 \u03bcm using a vibratome and the \u22122 from bregma sections were stained with fluoro-jade C following the manufacture\u2019s protocol (Millipore). Stained sections were imaged at 6 different cortical locations and the number of fluoro-jade positive cells were recorded. The cell count is presented as the number of fluoro-jade positive cells per mm\n2\n. The number of cells stained with fluoro-jade within the hippocampus (dentate gyrus, CA1, and CA3) was also recorded and presented as the total number of cells with positive staining.\nParaformaldehyde-fixed primary cortical neurons (3 wells per group) were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin at 4\u00b0C, and then incubated with antibodies against MAP2c (1:100, sc-390543, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Cells were washed, and incubated with an anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor 546 (1:1000, A11003, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 hr at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with DAPI and washed with PBS. Neurons were then subjected to fluoro-jade C following manufacture\u2019s protocol (Millipore). Seventy-five percent of each well was imaged with an EVOS FL Auto Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then ImageJ multi-point tool was used to count (by an investigator blinded to group assignment) cell number for the green (fluoro-jade C) and blue channels (DAPI staining was used as the total cell count). Replicates were not performed.\n\nWestern Blot\nFrozen brains (left and right cerebrum without olfactory blubs), placed in Lysis buffer (Biorad), were homogenized and sonicated, and the protein concentration was measured. Cells from neuron cultures (6 wells per group) were sonicated in lysis buffer and the protein concentration was measured. Western blot was performed, as we have previously done (\nWu et al., 2018\n), using primary antibodies for p-AKT (4060S, Cell Signaling Technology), AKT (4691S, Cell Signaling Technology), p-GSK-3\u03b2 (ab68476, Abcam), GSK-3\u03b2 (9315, Cell Signaling Technology), BCL2 (2870S, Cell Signaling Technology), CC3 (9661, Cell Signaling Technology), and \u03b2-actin (sc-47778, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For each gel, signals were normalized to \u03b2-actin for each lane and then all lanes were normalized to the sham values (2\u20133 per membrane). Replicates were not performed for the cell culture samples.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nData is presented as individual data points with the mean and standard deviation. All tests were two sided. Data was assessed for normality and homoscedasticity, and if not meet, non-parametric tests were used. A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data for cell counts, western blot, and rotarod were analyzed using one-way ANOVAs with Tukey post-hoc. Neuroscore, beam walking, and T-maze were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn\u2019s post-hoc. GraphPad Prism 6 (La Jolla, CA, USA) and SigmaPlot 11.0 (SysStat, Germany) were used for analyzing and graphing data."

    "Methods": "Animals\nOne hundred nineteen adult male WT mice on a C57BL/6J background were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and used in these studies. All mice weighed 25\u201330 g and were ~12\u201314 weeks old when used in this study. Mice were single housed for 7 days before initiating any pharmacological manipulations. All mice were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on from 7 am to 7 pm) in a temperature and humidity-controlled facility and allowed ad libitum access to food and water throughout the experimental period. All experiments used n = 5\u20138 mice per group. All experiments were approved by the Indiana University Bloomington Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nDrugs\nMorphine sulfate was obtained from the NIDA Drug Supply Program (National Institute on Drug Abuse, Bethesda, MD), dissolved in saline and administered via i.p. injection. Naloxone (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in saline. The antibiotic cocktail treatment consisted of vancomycin (Abbot, Abbot Park, IL), neomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and metronidazole (Actavis, Hafnarfjordur, Iceland) dissolved in sterile water and administered via oral gavage; and ampicillin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) via drinking water\nad libitum\n(\nReikvam et al., 2011\n). The probiotic treatment consisted of\nBifidobacterium longum subspecies longum\n35624\u2122 (Align) or\nLactobacillus rhamnosus\nGG (Culturelle) in sterile water administered via oral gavage. The MLCK inhibitor, ML-7 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was diluted in 3% DMSO and saline, and administered via i.p. injection. Drug concentrations and regimens employed are described for each respective experiment below.\n\nMouse model of opioid dependence and naloxone-precipitated withdrawal\nMorphine dependence was induced in mice by repeated injections for three consecutive days using an escalating dose schedule (112.5 mg/kg i.p. cumulative morphine dose) as described previously (\nIyer et al., 2020\n;\nLiu et al., 2011\n) (\nFig. 1A\n). Mice received morphine injections (or saline as a control) twice daily (9 am and 5 pm) for 2 consecutive days (day 1: 7.5 and 15 mg/kg i.p.; day 2: 30 and 30 mg/kg i.p.). On day 3 (48 h following first injection), mice received a final dose of morphine (30 mg/kg i.p.) or saline and were immediately placed into individual Plexiglas observation chambers to allow for habituation. After 30 min, all mice were injected with saline and returned to chambers. Then, 60 min (49 h) after the final morphine dose, all mice were challenged with naloxone (10 mg/kg i.p.) to precipitate a \u03bc-opioid receptor-dependent withdrawal syndrome, as described previously (\nIyer et al., 2020\n;\nLichtman et al., 2001\n;\nRamesh et al., 2011\n). Mice were video recorded continually throughout the observation interval and the number of withdrawal jumps observed over 30 min following the saline challenge and the naloxone challenge was subsequently quantified by a blinded scorer using the BORIS open source software (\nFriard and Gamba, 2016\n).\nFig. 1. Morphine FMT attenuates naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in morphine-dependent mice.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) The schematic shows the timing and doses of the escalating i.p. morphine dosing schedule used to produce opioid dependence. The grey vertical arrows show the timing of the FMT gavage treatments. After 49 h, naloxone was injected to precipitate opioid withdrawal. (B) Naloxone (10 mg/kg i.p.) produced characteristic jumping behavior consistent with the development of dependence. Morphine-treated mice receiving FMT from morphine-treated donor mice exhibited fewer withdrawal jumps compared to morphine-treated mice receiving FMT from saline-treated donor mice. Withdrawal jumps were induced by morphine but not saline treatments in recipient mice. Withdrawal jumps were higher in the morphine-treated mice receiving saline FMT compared to all other groups. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. (n = 5 per group) ****\nP\n< 0.0001 vs. FMT (Sal) - Mor group, ***\nP\n< 0.001, two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc test.\n\nFecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)\nTo study the effect of manipulation of the gut microbiota on morphine dependence, fecal microbiota from donor mice receiving either morphine (morphine FMT) or saline (saline FMT) were transplanted via oral gavage into recipient mice also receiving either morphine or saline (\nFig. 1A\n). Fecal samples were collected directly from donor mice, pooled together and immediately suspended in ice cold sterile water by homogenization with sterile blue pestles at a concentration of 60 mg of feces/ml. After resting on ice for approximately 2 min, 200 \u03bcl of supernatant was collected, and delivered to each recipient mouse via oral gavage 30 min before each morphine or saline injection using the FMT protocol described previously (\nZhou et al., 2017\n). Donor and recipient mice received chronic morphine injections concomitantly. To avoid confounding factors due to previous housing situation, we carefully assigned the mice to experimental groups in such a way that animals that previously shared the same cage would not be in the same experimental group. Only recipient mice were tested for naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal.\n\nCecum content dissection\nApproximately 30 min following naloxone challenge, cecum contents were dissected from each mouse to assess impact of FMT on gut microbiome. Before cecum content collection, mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane, and then transcardially perfused with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% heparin. Cecum content samples were flash frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis.\n\nDNA extraction, 16S rRNA gene amplification, sequencing, and sequence processing\nCecum content samples were analyzed (Microbiome Insights, BC, Canada) to determine bacterial composition. Specimens were placed into a MoBio PowerMag Soil DNA Isolation Bead Plate. DNA was extracted following MoBio\u2019s instructions on a KingFisher robot. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were PCR-amplified with dual-barcoded primers targeting the V4 region (515F 5\u2019-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3\u2019, and 806R 5\u2019-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3\u2019), as described previously (\nKozich et al., 2013\n). Amplicons were sequenced with an Illumina MiSeq using the 300-bp paired-end kit (v.3). Sequences were denoised, taxonomically classified using Greengenes (v. 13_8) as the reference database and clustered into 97%-similarity operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with the mothur software package (v. 1.39.5) (\nSchloss et al., 2009\n), following the recommended procedure (\nhttps://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP\n; accessed Nov 2017). The potential for contamination was addressed by co-sequencing DNA amplified the same way as the specimens. Operational taxonomic units were considered putative contaminants and were removed if their mean abundance in controls reached or exceeded 25 % of their mean abundance in specimens.\n\nShort-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations\nCecum content samples were analyzed (Microbiome Insights, BC, Canada) to measure the concentration of short-chain fatty acids. The SCFA extraction procedure was similar to that published previously (\nZhao et al., 2006\n). Material was resuspended in MilliQ-grade water, and homogenized using MP Bio FastPrep, for 1 min at 4.0 m/s. 5M HCl was added to acidify the fecal suspensions to a final pH of 2.0. Acidified fecal suspensions were incubated and centrifuged at 10,000 RPM to separate the supernatant. Fecal supernatants were spiked with 2-Ethylbutyric acid for a final concentration of 1 mM. Extracted SCFA supernatants were stored in 2-ml GC vials, with glass inserts. SCFA were detected using gas chromatography (Thermo Trace 1310), coupled to a flame ionization detector (Thermo Fisher).\n\nAntibiotic treatment\nTo study the effect of antibiotic treatment on morphine dependence, mice received an antibiotic cocktail as described previously (\nReikvam et al., 2011\n) twice daily (10 ml/kg) via oral gavage (\nFig. 4A\n). The antibiotic cocktail consisted of vancomycin (50 mg/kg), neomycin (100 mg/kg) and metronidazole (100 mg/kg). Ampicillin (1 g/L), also part of the antibiotic cocktail, was administered via drinking water\nad libitum\nfor the duration of the experiment (with water replacement at 4-day intervals). Water consumption and body weight were monitored to ensure that mice were not dehydrated and did not show signs of weight loss in response to antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic treatment was initiated (day 1), five days prior to the start of chronic morphine dosing (day 6) and continued until the last day of the experiment (day 8). When administered on the same day as morphine, antibiotic gavage was given 30 min before morphine or saline injection.\nFig. 4. Antibiotic treatment by oral gavage effectively reduces fecal bacterial DNA load and attenuates naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in morphine-dependent mice.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) The schematic shows the experimental timeline. The grey vertical arrows show the timing of the antibiotic cocktail (ABX) gavage treatments. The grey horizontal arrow show the duration of the oral ampicillin antibiotic treatment. On day 8, 49 h after the first morphine injection, naloxone was injected to precipitate opioid withdrawal. (B) Antibiotic treatment reduced bacterial load in the Day 8 fecal samples compared to Day 1 samples. (C) Naloxone (10 mg/kg i.p.) produced characteristic jumping behavior consistent with the development of dependence. Withdrawal jumps were significantly lower in the antibiotic-treated mice compared to the saline-treated mice. Impact of antibiotic treatment and three days of escalating morphine treatment on (D) water consumption and (E) body weight in mice. Antibiotic treatment initially reduced water consumption (day 1\u20134) but did not reliably alter water consumption during morphine treatment (day 5\u20137) with the exception of the antibiotic-morphine group compared to the water-saline group on Day 7 alone. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. (n = 5\u20138 per group), #\nP\n< 0.05 antibiotic + morphine group vs. water + saline group, ****\nP\n< 0.0001 vs. water-morphine - treated group or as indicated, ordinary or repeated measures two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc test.\n\nAbundance of bacterial 16S rRNA gene in fecal samples following antibiotic treatment\nFecal pellets were collected directly from mice receiving either the antibiotic cocktail or water, weighted, and immediately flash frozen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted with QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD) as recommended by the manufacturer (protocol for isolation of DNA for pathogen detection). Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were quantified by real-time PCR using specific primers as described previously (\nKang et al., 2017\n). To determine the number of 16S rRNA copies present in each sample, a standard curve was created by extracting and quantifying DNA from a known number of\nEscherichia coli.\n\nProbiotic treatment\nTo study the effect of probiotic treatment on morphine dependence, mice received\nBifidobacterium longum subspecies longum\n35624\u2122 or\nLactobacillus rhamnosus\nGG via oral gavage (10 ml/kg) 30 min before every morphine injection (\nFig. 5A\n). Probiotics were freshly-prepared by suspending the probiotic capsules in sterile water at a concentration of approximately 10\n6\nCFU/ml. Sterile water was administered via oral gavage in control mice.\nFig. 5. Probiotic treatment by oral gavage does not alter naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in morphine-dependent mice.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) The schematic shows the experimental timeline. The grey vertical arrows show the timing of the probiotic gavage treatments. After 49 h, naloxone was injected to precipitate opioid withdrawal. (B) Naloxone (10 mg/kg i.p.)-precipitated jumping differed between treatment groups; morphine-treated mice receiving water or\nBifidobacterium longum subspecies longum\n35624\u2122 (Align) by gavage showed naloxone-precipitated jumping compared to saline-treated mice receiving water by gavage. Naloxone precipitated jumps did not differ reliably in morphine-treated mice receiving\nLactobacillus rhamnosus\nGG (Culturelle) by gavage and saline-treated mice receiving water by gavage. Withdrawal jumps in mice receiving either\nBifidobacterium longum subspecies longum\n35624\u2122 (Align) or\nLactobacillus rhamnosus\nGG (Culturelle) probiotic treatment by gavage did not differ from each other or from morphine-treated mice receiving water by gavage. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. (n = 6 per group), **\nP\n< 0.01, *\nP\n< 0.05 as indicated, one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc test.\n\nML-7 treatment\nTo study the effect of blocking the increase in gut permeability on morphine dependence, mice were treated with the MLCK inhibitor, ML-7 (2 mg/kg, i.p.), administered 30 min before every morphine injection (10 ml/kg) (\nFig. 6A\n). This dose of ML-7 has been previously shown to reliably inhibit MLCK activity and protect the barrier function of endothelial cells in mice (\nHuppert et al., 2010\n;\nMeng et al., 2013\n).\nFig. 6. ML-7 treatment by gavage does not alter naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in morphine-dependent mice.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) The schematic shows the experimental timeline. The grey vertical arrows show the timing of the ML-7 treatments. After 49 h, naloxone was injected to precipitate opioid withdrawal. (B) In the same animals shown in C, morphine treatment increased gut permeability (\nP\n= 0.0363) compared to saline-treated mice. ML-7 treatment reduced gut permeability (\nP\n= 0.0378) and the interaction approached significance (\nP\n= 0.067). Plasma FITC-dextran concentrations were measured to assess impact of morphine and ML-7 treatment on gut permeability. Post hoc analysis confirmed that morphine increased gut permeability, as defined by higher FITC-dextran plasma concentrations, and this increased gut-permeability was blocked by ML-7 treatment. (C) Morphine treatment increased withdrawal jumps precipitated by naloxone (10 mg/kg i.p.) challenge, consistent with the development of dependence. Withdrawal jumps were not significantly altered in ML-7 treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice and the interaction was not significant. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. (n = 6\u20138 per group), ****\nP\n< 0.0001, ***\nP\n< 0.001, **\nP\n< 0.01 as indicated,\n# P <\n0.05 vs. the vehicle-morphine -treated group, two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc test.\n\nFluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran assay\nTo measure intestinal permeability in the present mouse model of opioid dependence, FITC-conjugated dextran (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or PBS was used as described previously (\nKang et al., 2017\n). Following naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, mice received oral gavage of FITC-labeled dextran (44 mg/100 g body weight). After 4 h, whole blood was collected, and plasma was isolated by centrifugation for 15 min at 3000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C. FITC concentration was fluorometrically quantified by emission spectrometry (Promega, Madison, WI) at 528 nm, using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm. All concentrations were measured against a standard curve of serially diluted FITC-dextran.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAlpha diversity was estimated with the Shannon index on raw OTU abundance tables after filtering out contaminants. The significance of diversity differences was tested with a one-way ANOVA. To estimate beta diversity across samples, OTUs occurring with a count of less than 3 in at least 10 % of the samples were excluded and then computed Bray-Curtis indices. The beta diversity was analyzed, emphasizing differences across samples, using Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) ordination. Variation in community structure was assessed with permutational multivariate analyses of variance (PERMANOVA) with treatment group as the main fixed factor and using 9999 permutations for significance testing. All analyses of beta diversity were conducted in the R environment. All other data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 7.05 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). 2 \u00d7 2 ANOVAs were used to assess the impact of FMT, antibiotic and ML-7 treatment on dependent measures (i.e. withdrawal jumps, Shannon diversity index, FITC dextran levels) in morphine- and saline-treated mice. Time course data was analyzed using repeated measures two-way ANOVA. Bonferroni post hoc tests were used, as appropriate, for follow up analyses to explain the source of significant main effects and interactions. Analyses of withdrawal jumps following probiotic treatments were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests.\nP <\n0.05 was considered statistically significant."

Each testing session measured (a) twitch and tetanic plantarflexion contraction torque and (b) electrophysiological measures of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude and average single motor unit potential (SMUP) amplitude, from which motor unit number estimation (MUNE) was calculated. Animals were weighed at the beginning of each testing session. All contractility and electrophysiology measurements were performed on the left (stroke-affected) hindlimb blinded to group. An additional cohort of rats with (D14 Stroke group) and without stroke (D14 Sham group) were used for myofiber analysis (soleus).\nTable 1.\nObjectives and Design\nObjectives by Experiment\nControl Groups\nStroke Groups\nAnalysis Parameters\nExperiment 1:\nIn vivo:\nAssess longitudinal impact of stroke on muscle contractility, electrophysiology, and motor unit connectivity\nSham n=3\nStroke n=7\n*\nMaximum plantarflexion twitch and tetanic torques following tibial nerve stimulation (\nin vivo\n)\nMUNE, derived from electrophysiological output of gastrocnemius after sciatic nerve stimulation (\nin vivo\n)\nHistology:\nExamine stroke-induced changes in myofiber phenotype\nD14 Sham n=3\nD14 Stroke n=8\nFiber type distribution, determined by histochemical visualization of soleus myofiber oxidative capacity\nExperiment 2:\nCharacterize NMJ morphology and innervation following stroke\nNa\u00efve n=5 (158 NMJs)\nStroke\n\u2212\nRAMT\nn=6 (233 NMJs)\nPresynaptic (nerve terminal), postsynaptic (AChR), and derived variables of gastrocnemius NMJ morphology\nTest therapeutic modulation of NMJ alterations via RAMT\nStroke\n+\nRAMT\nn=6 (279 NMJs)\nNumber of axonal inputs at each junction; identification of either mono- or polyaxonal innervation\nOpen in a new tab\nExperiment 1: Sham = sham MCAO; Stroke = MCAO.

(E) Diagram showing RAMT administration.\nExperiment 2\nexamined NMJ morphology and innervation after stroke and evaluated NMJ parameters as potential therapeutic targets of RAMT (\nTable 1\n;\nFigure 1B\n). Three experimental groups were assessed: Stroke\n\u2212RAMT\nrats (MCAO only, no treatment), Stroke\n+RAMT\nrats (MCAO followed by daily RAMT), and Na\u00efve rats (healthy age-matched controls, no stroke, no RAMT). Gastrocnemius muscles from the left (stroke-affected) hindlimb of Stroke\n\u2212RAMT\nand Stroke\n+RAMT\nrats were harvested at post-stroke D14 and frozen for histological analysis of NMJs. Healthy gastrocnemius muscles were harvested from the left hindlimb of age-matched Na\u00efve rats for comparison.\n\nIn vivo\nProcedures\nAnimal Preparation and Anesthesia.\nRats were anesthetized for MCAO or sham surgery, MRI, electrophysiology and contractility testing, and RAMT treatment by inhaled isoflurane (5% induction, 1.5-2% maintenance) delivered in medical air. Artificial tear ointment was applied to the eyes. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C using a heated table or warming pad, and respiration rate was monitored for the duration of each procedure. Rats recovered from all anesthetic events in their cage on heated surface maintained at 37\u00b0C under observation. Following stroke induction, animals received 3mL warm (37\u00b0C) sterile NaCl via subcutaneous injection and were closely evaluated for body temperature, body weight, incision healing, and overall health.\nIschemic Stroke Induction.\nTransient (60min) cerebral ischemia was induced in the right hemisphere of 8- to 10-week-old rats using the intraluminal suture method of MCAO (\n40\n,\n47\n). Following permanent distal ligation of the right external carotid artery, a 4-0 monofilament nylon suture with silicon tip was inserted and directed to the common carotid bifurcation, then advanced into the right internal carotid artery to the origin of the MCA. Laser Doppler Flowmetry (DRT4; Moor Instruments, Wilmington, DE, USA) monitored cortical blood flow and confirmed occlusion (>40-70% decrease in MCA-supplied territory). Sham MCAO surgery was performed as presented above, but without suture placement and MCA occlusion. Animals were monitored for health through the duration of the study. One rat from the D14 Stroke group (n=9) and two rats from the Stroke\n+RAMT\ngroup (n=10) were excluded per IACUC protocol early removal criteria, specifically respiratory distress, inability to eat or drink, or >20% body weight loss (\nTable 1\n).\nBrain MRI.\nBrain imaging (9.4-T MRI, Bruker BioSpec 94/30, Billerica, MA, USA) was performed at 48hr post-MCAO (\u00b1 24hr) to confirm MCA stroke (\nFigure 1C\n,\nD\n). After localizer scans, T2-weighted spin echo with Rapid Acquisition with Relaxation Enhancement (RARE) sequence providing 8 echo train length was applied (FOV = 30\u00d730 mm; acquisition matrix = 256\u00d7256; TR = 3500ms; TE = 46.924ms; flip angle = 162 degrees; images in acquisition = 30; resolution = 8.533 pixels/mm; number of averages = 2). Four rats from the Stroke\n\u2212RAMT\ngroup (n=10), and two additional rats from the Stroke\n+RAMT\ngroup, were excluded due to unsuccessful MCA-territory infarction (\nTable 1\n).\nMotor Unit and Muscle Electrophysiology.\nCMAP and average SMUP amplitudes were recorded from the left (stroke-affected) gastrocnemius after stimulation of the sciatic nerve using a clinical electrodiagnostic device (Cadwell, Kennewick, WA, USA), as previously described by our group (\n48\n,\n49\n). In brief, the hindlimb and posterolateral thigh were shaved with clippers. Rats were placed prone with hindlimbs abducted at the hips, extended at the knees, and secured with tape. One active and one reference surface disk recording electrode were placed over the gastrocnemius mid-belly and the calcaneus, respectively (TECA 6030-TP, Natus Neurology, Middleton, WI, USA). To reduce skin/electrode electrical impedance, both disks were coated with electrode gel (Spectra 360, Park Labs, Fairfield, NJ, USA) before placement on the skin. A disposable tab adhesive electrode (Natus Neurology, Middleton, WI, USA) on the tail served as a ground. Two disposable 28-gauge insulated monopolar needle electrodes (TECA, Oxford Instruments Medical, NY, USA) were inserted at the proximal hindlimb subcutaneously to stimulate the sciatic nerve. The low and high frequency filters were set to 10Hz and 10kHz, respectively. The sciatic nerve was stimulated at increasing intensities until the maximum CMAP response was observed (square wave pulse, 0.1-0.2ms duration, from 1mA to 20mA intensity). A supramaximal stimulation (120% stimulus required for maximum response) was then delivered, and baseline-to-peak and peak-to-peak CMAP amplitudes were recorded. For SMUP measurements, also optimized by our group (\n48\n,\n49\n), gradually-increasing submaximal sciatic nerve stimulations (adjusted in 0.027mA steps) were delivered to obtain ten all-or-none increments, all of which were averaged to determine the average SMUP amplitude. To calculate MUNE, the CMAP peak-to-peak amplitude was divided by the average SMUP peak-to-peak amplitude.\nMuscle Contractility.\nAfter electrophysiological recording, plantarflexion torque was assessed using an\nin vivo\ncontractility apparatus, with a force footplate on rotating axis connected to a force detection motor (Model 1300A, Aurora Scientific Inc, Canada), akin to methods described previously by our group in mice (\n50\n-\n53\n) and rats (\n48\n). The left hindpaw was taped to the force plate such that the hindpaw dorsum was angled 90\u00b0 to the anterior tibia. The leg was extended with the knee joint securely clamped, non-invasively, at the femoral condyles, avoiding compression of the fibular nerve at the fibular head. Two disposable 28-gauge insulated monopolar needle electrodes (Natus Neurology, Inc, Middleton, WI, USA) were inserted subcutaneously over the tibial nerve, just posteromedial to the knee.\nTo identify the maximum stimulus intensity, a series of increasing square stimuli (0.2ms pulse duration) were delivered at 0.5Hz frequency until the twitch response no longer increased. Maximal twitch torque was then recorded following a single supramaximal stimulus. Next, a 200ms train of supramaximal square stimuli was delivered at 125Hz frequency to acquire the maximum tetanic contraction torque. Three rats from the Stroke group (n=7) were excluded from contractility analyses after confirming insufficient stimulation during baseline acquisition based on tetanic waveform visualization; thus, for contractility data, the Stroke group was n=4 (\nTable 1\n).\nRAMT Treatment.\nAs previously published (\n40\n), the RAMT device was designed to facilitate objective study of mechanical physiotherapy on preclinical stroke outcomes. Following MCAO to induce stroke, Stroke\n+RAMT\nrats received 30min of RAMT treatment, 5 days per week, beginning post-stroke D1 and continuing to D14, for a total of 10 treatments. For each treatment session, rats were maintained under inhaled isoflurane (1.5-2%). The paretic hindlimb was then positioned under an 8mm-diameter contact head connected to a load cell on a z-axis stage, controlled for mechanical force, frequency, and pattern of motion. Administered to the left (stroke-affected) hindlimb over the medial aspect of the gastrocnemius muscle, RAMT was delivered at 0.5N force across a 10mm linear path (proximal-to-distal pattern, 1Hz) (\nFigure 1E\n). To control for potential effects of anesthesia during RAMT sessions, the Stroke\n\u2212RAMT\ngroup received a matching dose, schedule, and duration of anesthesia.\n\nHistology and Immunohistochemistry\nNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) tetrazolium reductase (-TR) histochemistry.\nRight and left soleus muscles were fixed and cryoprotected in a series of overnight incubations (formalin, 15% sucrose, 20% sucrose) and frozen in optimal cutting temperature embedding medium (OCT) floated on liquid nitrogen, then stored at \u221280\u00b0C until sectioning. For histochemical analysis of myofiber type distribution, transverse 10\u03bcm sections were incubated 30min at 37\u00b0C in a solution of 1.5mM nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (NBT; Sigma), 1.5mM \u03b2-NADH-reduced disodium salt hydrate (Sigma), and 0.2M Tris HCl at pH 7.4. After a series of 2min acetone washes (30%, 60%, 90%, 60%, 30%), slides were mounted with Vectamount AQ (Vector Labs, CA, USA).\nImmunofluorescence.\nThe left gastrocnemius muscles were frozen in OCT floated on liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until sectioning. Samples were acclimated 30min in the cryostat and sectioned at \u221220\u00b0C in 50\u03bcm mid-belly longitudinal sections onto Superfrost Plus glass slides (Fisher Scientific). Slides were dried 1hr at room temperature (RT) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until histological processing. At RT, slides were thawed 30min, fixed in 4% PFA 30min, and washed (3\u00d710min) in 1X PBS. Slides were incubated in blocking solution (10% goat serum, 4% BSA, 3% Triton-X-100, in 1X PBS) 2hr at RT, followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C in primary antibody solution containing chicken \u03b1-NF-200 (Abcam, Ab72996, [1:5000]) and rabbit \u03b1-Synapsin-1 (Cell Signaling, 5297S, [1:200]). After washes (3\u00d710min) in 1X PBS, slides were incubated 2hr at RT in secondary antibody solution containing goat anti-Chicken Alexa Fluor 594 (Life Technologies, A11042, [1:1000]), goat anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 546 (Life Technologies, A11010, [1:1000]), and \u03b1-bungarotoxin (-BTX) Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies,\nB13422\n, [1:1000]). Slides were then washed (3\u00d710min) in 1X PBS and mounted with Fluoromount-G (Invitrogen).\nMyofiber Phenotype Identification.\nSoleus myofibers were imaged on an Axio Scan Z.1 (brightfield, 20X objective; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and viewed in ZEN 2.3 imaging software (blue edition; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). ROIs measuring 800\u03bcm x 800\u03bcm were selected, each containing 100-150 myofibers. The phenotype of each myofiber was then determined by observer in ImageJ (\n54\n) (v. 1.51h, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) based on resulting myofiber staining intensity (\n55\n,\n56\n). Mitochondrial NADH-TR enzyme activity transfers a hydrogen from reduced NADH to NBT dye; the resulting tetrazolium reduction yields a purple/blue formazan precipitate present heavily in highly oxidative fibers but sparsely in glycolytic fibers.\nNMJ Imaging and Quantification.\nGastrocnemius NMJs were imaged on an Andor Revolution WD spinning disk laser confocal microscope system (Inverted Nikon TiE microscope, 40X water immersion objective, 488nm and 561nm lasers) with MetaMorph 7X Premier software (v. 7.7, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Individual channel images were merged and processed as Z stacks in ImageJ (\n54\n) (v. 1.51h, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA), after which maximum intensity projections were quantified using a custom-designed workflow, including modifications from NMJ-morph (\n57\n). It was discovered upon imaging that sections from one rat in the Na\u00efve group (n=6) were photobleached. Therefore, for NMJ analysis, the Na\u00efve group was n=5. The total number of NMJs imaged per group are shown in\nTable 1\n.\nNeuronal components at the NMJ were identified by presence of neurofilament (axon) and synapsin (axon terminal). The quantified presynaptic variables included area and perimeter of the nerve terminal (distal branchpoint of innervating axon and associated axon terminal branches). Postsynaptic AChRs were stained with \u03b1-BTX. Postsynaptic variables of interest were area and perimeter of the AChRs (all stained clusters) and the motor endplate (ellipsoid receptor footprint; all stained clusters and unstained spaces). Additional observations included the number of AChR clusters and the number of axons innervating each NMJ. Finally, a number of variables were derived using ImageJ functions or calculated from existing pre- or postsynaptic variables. NMJ quantification variables are defined in\nTable A.1\n.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nSample sizes were estimated based on our previous experience employing the MCAO model of ischemic stroke (\n40\n,\n47\n,\n58\n). The sample size per group, per data set is reported in the figure legends. Statistical tests were performed in GraphPad Prism (v. 8.4.3, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Differences in group means from our\nin vivo\nlongitudinal study (2 groups, 4 timepoints) were tested via Repeated Measures (RM) 2-way ANOVA, followed by Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons\npost hoc\ntest to evaluate Stroke vs. Sham groups at each timepoint (BL, D7, D14, D21). For fiber type histology data, a 3-way ANOVA was performed to test interactions between the following variables: group (Stroke vs. Sham), myofiber type (type I, type IIA, type IID/X), and hindlimb (stroke-affected/left vs. contralateral/right). ANOVA data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM, unless otherwise noted. Histological NMJ data (3 groups) were analyzed using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test and are presented graphically as median \u00b1 95% confidence interval (CI), unless otherwise noted. Differences between the mean rank of each group and that of a statistical control (Stroke\n\u2212RAMT\ngroup) were identified using Dunn\u2019s multiple comparisons\npost hoc\ntest. Group means \u00b1 SEM and KW test data (Kruskal-Wallis statistic (H),\np\nvalue) are provided in\nTable 2\n; Dunn\u2019s\npost hoc\nresults of comparisons between groups are provided in the figure legends (Stroke\n\u2212RAMT\nvs. Na\u00efve; Stroke\n\u2212RAMT\nvs. Stroke\n+RAMT\n). Statistical significance was set at\np\n0.05.\nTable 2.\nQuantified Variables of NMJ Morphology Across Experimental Groups\nVariable\nNa\u00efve\nStroke\n\u2212RAMT\nStroke\n+RAMT\nKruskal-Wallis test\np\nvalue, H statistic\nPresynaptic:\nNerve terminal area (\u03bcm\n2\n)\n85.6 \u00b1 3.1\n****\n121.4 \u00b1 4.9\n117.9 \u00b1 3.9\np\n<0.0001, H=28.60\nNerve terminal perimeter (\u03bcm)\n108.1 \u00b1 3.3\n****\n160.5 \u00b1 10.5\n124.7 \u00b1 3.2\n*\np\n<0.0001, H=28.26\nPostsynaptic:\nMotor endplate area (\u03bcm\n2\n)\n269.8 \u00b1 9.4\n**\n303.9 \u00b1 7.9\n269.0 \u00b1 6.5\n**\np\n=0.0008.

    "Methods": "Data resulting from these experiments are available upon request.\n\nAnimals.\nSwiss Webster mice were purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA) and bred at OSU and WVU. Swiss Webster mice were used because their skulls are much less likely to fracture with our injury device than other strains. Pups were weaned at 21 days of age and were housed in a 14:10 light cycle with\nad libitum\naccess to food (Harlan-Teklad #8640) and filtered tap water. All procedures were approved by the OSU and WVU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees and were conducted in accordance with NIH guidelines. In all cases, animals were randomly assigned to groups (injury, drug, and ischemia) and all observations were conducted by researchers blind to experimental conditions.\n\nSurgical Procedures.\nA single closed-head mild TBI was conducted on male mice (6\u20138 weeks of age) as previously reported (\nKarelina et al., 2017\n) (see below). Given the significant sex difference reported for the incidence of TBI in young adult males, and increased mortality in post-TBI stroke in males, we elected to conduct these experiments in young male mice. (\nFaul et al., 2010\n;\nLiao et al., 2014\n).\n\nTraumatic brain injury.\nMice were randomly assigned to an experimental group and then placed into a stereotaxic frame under inhaled isoflurane anesthesia (3% induction, 1.5% maintenance). The injury was induced with an Impact One device (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). A 3mm diameter impactor tip was retracted and driven into the skull along the midline (\u22122mm AP relative to bregma) to a depth of 1.2 mm at a rate of 3mm/sec (dwell time: 30 msec). The skin was sutured with 6/0 nylon suture and mice were returned to their cages. The control procedure was performed identically but the impactor was not driven into the skull (just placed on the surface and retracted). A subset of mice were treated intraperitoneally (IP) with 10mg/kg Pioglitazone (Abcam) or the vehicle (5% DMSO in olive oil). Mice were treated 15 minutes after injury and again 24 hours later.\n\nMiddle cerebral artery occlusion.\nBriefly, following a 7-day recovery period after TBI, mice were re-anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane (3% induction, 1.5% maintenance) and a unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was achieved by insertion of a 0.23mm occluder (Doccol) into the right middle cerebral artery via the internal carotid artery and extending 6mm beyond the internal carotid-pterygopalatine artery bifurcation. The occluder was secured and the mouse was returned to its home cage for 1 hour. Following the 1-hour occlusion period, the mouse was re-anesthetized, and reperfusion was initiated by removal of the occluder. Sham surgeries included all the surgical preparation up to the exposure of the internal carotid artery but omitted occlusion, all other aspects of the surgery were identical. All animals were treated with the analgesic buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg). MCAO mice were included in the study if a measurable infarct was present.\n\nDetermination of infarct volume.\nMice were euthanized by rapid decapitation; brains were sectioned into 4 2mm-thick coronal sections through the forebrain and incubated in 1% TTC (made in saline) for 10 minutes at 37\u00b0C. TTC produces a pink formazan product in the presence of live mitochondria, thus ischemic lesions are visualized as unstained white tissue. Slices were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, photographed, and infarct area was outlined on both sides of each slice using Fiji imaging software(\nSchindelin et al., 2012\n). Infarct size was determined after correcting for edema and reported as percent of the contralateral hemisphere using the formula: (1-(total ipsilateral hemisphere \u2013 infarct)/total contralateral hemisphere) *100. Following tissue imaging for TTC, the paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue slices were cryopreserved, frozen, and further sectioned coronally on a cryostat at 40\u03bcm throughout the forebrain. The thin-sliced tissue was then used for free-floating immunohistochemistry and silver staining. Histochemistry was conducted as previously described (\nKarelina et al., 2017\n). Axon degeneration was assessed via silver staining (FD NeuroSilver) per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Of note, TTC-stained tissue has successfully been used for further protein analysis (i.e. immunohistochemistry) as a means of reducing the total number of animals needed for experiments, as well as providing maximal converging information regarding ischemia-related pathology and behavior from each animal (\nKramer et al., 2010\n;\nSun et al., 2012\n).\nA separate subset of animals was transcardially perfused seven days post-TBI and tissue was cut on a cryostat and processed for immunochemical labelling of IgG, CD31 and GFAP.\n\nBehavioral testing.\nMotor function was assessed in the corner test by placing a mouse facing into the corner of two Plexiglas boards (attached at a 30\u00b0 angle) to the depth at which both sides of the vibrissae were touching each board. The direction the mouse turned to exit the corner was recorded, the mouse was replaced in its home cage for 30 seconds, and the trial was repeated for a total of 10 times. The percent time turning toward the non-impaired side (right) was calculated for each mouse by a blinded observer.\n\nHistological analysis\nFollowing tissue imaging for TTC, the paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue slices were cryopreserved, frozen, and further sectioned coronally on a cryostat at 40\u03bcm throughout the forebrain. The thin-sliced tissue was then used for free-floating silver staining (NeuroSilver, FD Neurotechnologies, Columbia, MD) per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nA separate subset of animals was transcardially perfused seven days post-TBI (or the control procedure) and the brains were postfixed, cryoprotected and frozen before being cut on a cryostat at 40 microns. Sections were then blocked in 1% normal horse serum containing 0.01% Triton-X and incubated overnight in primary antibodies CD-31 (RNDSystems, Minneapolis, MN, 1:200) and GFAP (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA 1:250) at room temperature. Tissue was then incubated in secondary antibodies (rabbit-anti mouse 546, donkey anti-goat 647, and IgG labelling was assessed with goat anti-rabbit IgG 488).\n\nImaging and Analysis\nAxonal degeneration was assessed live, by an investigator blinded to the experimental conditions on a Leica microscope. Sections were imaged initially at low magnification (4x) and areas of degeneration were examined at higher power (20x). Experimenters made qualitative analyses of silver staining using a 4-point scale (0 = no silver staining, 3 = dense axon degeneration in white matter tracks throughout the forebrain) as previously reported (\nWeil et al., 2014\n). IgG/CD31/GFAP immunohistochemistry of a section (between bregma \u22121.5 and \u22122.0) was imaged and stitched on an Olympus VS-120 microscope with a 10X Plan S Apo/0.40 NA objective using a Monochrome XM10 camera (1376 \u00d7 1032 imaging array, 6.45 \u00d7 6.45-micron pixel size, and 14-bit digitization). Resulting images of the entire section were assessed via qualitative analysis using a 5-point scale (0 = no staining, 1 = sparse vascular staining, 2 = moderate vascular staining limited to the injury site, 3 = extensive vascular staining throughout the injury site, 4 = extensive vascular staining evident within and beyond the injury site).\n\nReal time PCR.\nFresh brains were removed, placed in RNAlater and cortex and striatum were dissected out of the ischemic hemisphere. RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies), and reverse transcribed with M-MLV. Primer and probe sets were purchased from Applied Biosystems (CD68: Mm03047343_m1, TNF-\u03b1: Mm00443258_m1, and Il1\u03b2: Mm00434228_m1) and a Taqman 18S ribosomal RNA primer/probe set was used as an internal control (Applied Biosystems #4319413E). Universal RT-PCR cycling conditions were performed on an ABI 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System using the TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (#4444963). Gene expression is normalized to 18S rRNA and expressed as a relative quantity based on the relative standard curve method.\n\nEx vivo insulin stimulation.\nMice were rapidly decapitated and fresh brains were collected and sliced through the entire forebrain at 0.4 mm intervals using a McIlwain tissue chopper. Slices from each brain were evenly split among two wells containing aCSF bubbled with carbogen (127 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO\n3\n, 1.2 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 25 mM glucose, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n), one well was incubated with 10nM insulin (Sigma, St. Louis MO) and the other well with only aCSF for 10 minutes at 37\u00b0C (\nKarelina et al., 2016\n). Tissue was then lysed in RIPA buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Invitrogen), centrifuged, and protein concentration was assessed with a BCA protein assay (Bio-Rad).\n\nWestern blotting.\nProtein lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE as previously reported (\nKarelina et al., 2016\n). Protein (30\u03bcg) was electrophoresed into a precast gel (Bio-Rad, 4\u201315%) and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Membranes were washed with TBS containing 0.01% tween, blocked in 5% BSA and incubated overnight with goat anti-rabbit phosphorylated Akt Ser473 (1:3,000 Cell Signaling), anti-rabbit pan Akt (1:2,000 Cell Signaling), or GAPDH (1:2000 Cell Signaling) at 4\u00b0C. Following secondary antibody incubation (HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, R&D), the blots were visualized with an ECL substrate (Invitrogen). Protein expression was determined by a densitometry calculation performed in Fiji (\nSchindelin et al., 2012\n). Phosphorylated Akt expression was first determined relative to pan Akt (pAkt/Akt), then reported as percent change pAkt expression [(pAkt/Akt insulin \u2013 pAkt/Akt aCSF)/pAkt/Akt insulin X 100)]."

    "Methods": "Contusion SCI.\nAnimal procedures were approved by Thomas Jefferson University\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) committee and were conducted in compliance with the\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\nand the\nARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines\n. Male C57BL/6 mice (25-30g; Jackson Laboratories, n=5-8 per group for various analyses) were anesthetized with 1% isofluorane. Contusion SCI was conducted as previously described [\n17\n]. The Infinite Horizons impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation) was used to generate contusion to the right side of C5/C6 spinal cord using the following parameters: 0.7mm impactor tip, 40kdynes of force, 2 seconds of dwell time. Laminectomy-only controls received identical surgeries, but did not receive a contusion.\n\nBehavioral testing.\nThermal sensory testing was performed as previously described using the Hargreaves apparatus (Ugo Basile) [\n17\n]. After being acclimated to the testing room for 1 hour per day for 5 days, baseline measurements were taken one week prior to surgery, and then once per week for 6 weeks following surgery. Animals were held gently by the scruff only, and placed on a glass plane with the infrared heat source positioned directly under the paw to be tested. Thermal stimulation was then initiated and time to paw withdrawal recorded. The withdrawal latency for baseline/pre-injury varies depending on the intensity of thermal stimulus that is chosen. We used the same thermal stimulation intensity for every animal tested in this study, as well as for all four limbs. In our previous work with this mouse model of unilateral cervical contusion SCI using the same Hargreaves testing paradigm, baseline latency was approximately 20 seconds, which is the same as in our current study [\n18\n,\n19\n]. Movement of the paw remained unimpeded throughout testing, and withdrawal was defined as a quick movement away from the thermal stimulus, often accompanied by paw licking. Trials were repeated 3 times per paw per testing period, in an alternating manner, with a 120 second interval between measurements. Tactile sensory assessment was performed using the von Frey filament test, as previously described [\n17\n]. Animals were acclimated to a plexiglass box placed on a wire mesh for 1 hour per day for 5 days prior to testing. The box was sized such that the movement of the mice was not impeded. Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments (Stoetling Company; Dale, IL) producing 0.07 grams to 2 grams of force were applied to the plantar surface of the paw being tested. Care was taken to apply filaments to the center of the paw, avoiding the footpad. Following the \u201cup-down\u201d method, filaments were applied 10 times per paw, with paw withdrawal thresholds defined as the filament which produced a paw withdrawal at least 50% of the time, with a minimum of 3 applications. Measurements were taken 1 week prior to surgery and continued for 6 weeks post-surgery. During both Hargreaves and von Frey testing, we also assessed whether each paw withdraw response was accompanied by any supraspinal-associated behaviors (e.g. paw licking, vocalization, guarding). In the current study, we found that supraspinal responses in both Hargreaves and von Frey paradigms accompanied greater than 80% of all paw withdrawals.\n\nTissue processing.\nAnimals were sacrificed using an overdose of ketamine (100mg/kg) and xylazine (5mg/kg). Animals were then transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Spinal cord was dissected and placed in 4% PFA overnight, then transferred to 0.1% phosphate buffer for 24 hours before being placed in 30% sucrose for at least 3 days before cryosectioning. Spinal cords were sectioned transversely at a thickness of 30\u03bcm.\n\nLocation of histological analyses.\nFor immunostaining [\n17\n], cervical spinal cord sections were located one segment caudal to the contusion epicenter (corresponding to the C6/C7 spinal level). Lesion epicenter was defined as the transverse spinal cord section with the largest percentage of lesion area. This caudal location was chosen because it is the site of input to DH from primary sensory afferents that innervate the plantar surface of the ipsilateral forepaw. The dorsal horn was completely intact at these sections. Lumbar spinal cord analysis was performed at L4/L5, as these segments receive primary afferent input from the plantar surface of the hindpaw. We performed histological analyses at both the C6/C7 and L4/L5 spinal cord levels to anatomically correspond to the locations of our behavior testing. We chose not to also perform similar histological analyses rostral to the C5/C6 contusion site because we would not be able to perform corresponding NP-related behavior testing to go along with these high-cervical spinal cord locations; we believe an assessment of above-level pain would instead be best achieved using the combination of a thoracic SCI model and forepaw behavioral testing.\n\nImmunohistochemistry.\nAntibodies used were rabbit anti-Iba1 (WAKO, AB_839504, 1:600), rat anti-mouse CD68 (Bio-rad, AB_322219, 1:500), rat anti-CD86 (BD Pharmingen, AB_394994, 1:100), goat anti-CD206 (anti mMMR, R&D Systems, AB_2063012, 1:00), goat anti-YM1 (R&D Systems, AB_2079008, 1:250), and rat anti-mouse MARCO (Bio-rad, AB_322923, 1:500). Secondary Antibodies from Jackson Labs: Donkey anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 647, AB_2492288; Donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488, AB_2340846; Donkey anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488, AB_2340683; Donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488, AB_2340428.\n\nImaging and analysis.\nImaging of ipsilateral sDH was conducted on a Zeiss AXIO microscope, and FIJI was used for image analysis. Iba1\n+\ncells were counted in laminae I-II. Separate immunostaining for Iba1/CD86, Iba1/MARCO, Iba1/CD206 and Iba1/YM1 co-labeling was conducted. Cell counts represent averages from 3 fields per animal, chosen randomly within a region approximately 900\u03bcm caudal to the injury epicenter. Iba1\n+\ncells were classified as either expressing or not expressing the phenotypic markers CD86, MARCO, CD206 or YM1. Fluorescence intensity of CD86 or CD206 expression by individual Iba1/CD86 or Iba1/CD206 co-labeled cells was then determined using FIJI, in one randomly chosen sDH section per animal. Per cell intensity was measured by outlining and measuring the intensity of each CD86-positive or CD206-positive cell individually and then expressing it as a function of directly-adjacent background intensity. Images for display were obtained at 40x magnification using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope.\n\nQuantitative PCR.\nWe micro-dissected a 2mm rostral-to-caudal length of spinal cord tissue (restricting harvest to only the dorsal quadrant on the side of contusion). The rostral end of this 2mm-long piece of tissue was located at the C6/C7 level of the spinal cord. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), DNase-cleaned, and reverse transcribed using the iSCript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). PCR was performed using SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in CFX96 optics module real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Each sample was normalized to GAPDH and expressed as 2\n\u2212\u0394Ct\n. The following primers were used (5\u2032 to 3\u2032):\nIL-1\u03b2, CTGGTGTGTGACGTTCCCATTA (sense) and CCGACAGCACGAGGCTTT(antisense); TNF-\u03b1,\nCCTCACACTCACAAACCACCA (sense) and ACAAGGTACAACCCATCGGC (antisense); iNOS,\nGCTATGGCCGCTTTGATGTG (sense) and TCGAACTCCAATCTCGGTGC (anti-sense);\nIL-10, GCTCTTACTGACTGGCATGAG (sense) and CGCAGCTCTAGGAGCATGTG(antisense); IL-4,\nTGGGTCTCAACCCCCAGCTAGT (sense) and TGCATGGCGTCCCTTCTCCTGT (antisense); Arginase-1,\nCAGAAGAATGGAAGAGTCAG (sense) and CAGATATGCAGGGAGTCACC (antisense); GAPDH,\nCCGCATCTTCTTGTGCAGT (sense) and AATGGCAGCCCTGGTGAC (antisense);\n\nStatistical analysis.\nAll data are presented as mean +/\u2212 SEM, and all statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. D\u2019Agostino-Pearson test for normality was done to all data to choose the appropriate comparisons test. Parametric ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s test was used for cell count comparisons. Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric ANOVA with multiple comparisons was used for comparisons of marker expression. Mann-Whitney tests were used for RT-PCR comparisons. Grubb\u2019s test to identify outliers was also performed on all RT-PCR data; outliers were identified in two graphs (1 data point per group in both iNOS and IL4) and removed from statistical comparisons. 2-way ANOVA with Sidak\u2019s Multiple Comparison\u2019s Test comparing SCI to laminectomy-only at each time point was used for the behavioral analyses."

    "Methods": "Animals\nTransgenic B6.Cg-\nMapt\ntm1(EGFP)Klt\nTg(MAPT)8cPdav/J mice (male and female) were produced in house from breeders obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Jax# 005491; Bar Harbor, ME). This mouse line was generated previously by introducing a transgene encoding six isoforms of human tau without disease-associated mutations onto homozygous tau\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice (\nAndorfer et al., 2003\n). These mice lack any obvious disease phenotype at birth, but develop impairments in Morris Water Maze, spatial learning, and food burrowing with age (\nGeiszler et al., 2016\n;\nPhillips et al., 2011\n;\nPolydoro et al., 2009\n). This mouse strain was originally generated on a hybrid Swiss Webster/B6D2F1 hybrid background but has been backcrossed to C57BL/6J for more than 10 generations. SNP analysis performed by The Jackson Laboratory were consistent with a pure C57BL/6J background, which served as the control strain. All breeding mice were homozygous for a disruption of the murine tau gene. One mouse in each breeding pair was hemizygous for a transgene expressing all six isoforms of non-mutant human tau protein. The offspring are therefore either full tau knockout (tau\n\u2212/\u2212\n) or express only human tau (htau).\nDNA was extracted from tail snips and genotype was confirmed via PCR according to the protocols supplied by Jackson labs. Disruption of the endogenous murine tau gene was confirmed using the primer pair 5\u2019-CGTTGTGGCTGTTGTAGTTG-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-TCGTGACCACCCTGACCTAC-3\u2019, which amplifies a fragment at 270 bp in both tau\n\u2212/\u2212\nand htau mice. Presence of the human-tau transgene was confirmed using the primer pair 5\u2019-CGAAGTGATGGAAGATCACG-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-GTCTTGGTGCATGGTGTAGC-3\u2019, which amplifies a fragment at 79 bp in htau mice. Protein expression was confirmed via western blot of hippocampal homogenate using the H150 antibody (\nFig. 1\n; 1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Age matched male C57BL/6J control mice were obtained from Jackson labs (Jax#000664) and allowed to acclimate after delivery for at least one week prior to any experiments. All mice were housed under a 14 hour light / 10 hour dark cycle in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care Internal (AALAC) facility. Food and water were available\nad libitum\n. The University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all procedures.\nFigure 1.

In control mice, DGCs from 4 month old mice fire more action potentials than at 1.5 months.*: Different from control at same age (p<0.05) \u2020: Different from 1.5 month of same genotype (p<0.05) \u01c2: Different from 4 month of same genotype (p<0.05). Error bars indicate SEM. Statistical comparisons were made between all groups by two-way ANOVA with age and genotype as factors (Tukey post hoc).\n\nHippocampal slice preparation\nMice were deeply anesthetized via inhalation of isoflurane to effect (lack of tail pinch response) and decapitated while anesthetized. The brain was rapidly removed from the skull and immersed in ice-cold oxygenated (95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n) cutting/holding artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). The cutting/holding aCSF contained (in mM): 85 NaCl, 75 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 25 glucose, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n\u00b7H\n2\nO, 4 MgCl\n2\n\u00b76H\n2\nO, 0.5 CaCl\n2\n\u00b72H\n2\nO, and 24 NaHCO\n3\n(pH 7.2\u20137.4). Coronal sections (300 \u00b5m) were cut on a vibrating microtome (Vibratome Series 1000; Technical Products International, St. Louis, MO). Each slice was divided with a midsagittal cut and hippocampi were isolated and transferred to a holding chamber with warmed (30\u201332\u00b0 C), oxygenated cutting/holding aCSF and incubated for at least 1 hour before recordings. In a subset of animals, 5\u20138 hippocampal slices were set aside for protein analysis. Extrahippocampal tissue was removed from these slices. Approximately 30mg of hippocampal tissue was collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. One slice at a time was transferred to a chamber mounted under an upright microscope (BX51WI; Olympus) and was superperfused with warmed (30\u201332\u00b0 C) oxygenated recording aCSF. The recording aCSF contained (in mM): 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 1.3 MgCl, 1.4 NaHCO\n3\n, and 11 glucose (pH 7.2\u20137.4). Each slice was equilibrated in the microscope chamber for >10 minutes before recording.\n\nElectrophysiological recordings\nWhole-cell patch-clamp recording were obtained from hippocampal DGCs, identified by location and morphological characteristics. Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (open tip resistance 3\u20135 M\u03a9; King Precision Glass Co.). The pipette recording solution contained (in mM): 126 K\n+\n-gluconate, 4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, and 10 PO-creatine (pH 7.2). Electrophysiological recordings were performed using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), low pass filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 20 kHz (Digidata 1440A; Molecular Devices), and recorded onto a computer using pClamp 10.2 software (Molecular Devices). Seal resistance was typically 2\u20135 G\u03a9. Series resistance was <25 M\u03a9 (mean: 11.4 M\u03a9 ) and was monitored periodically during the recordings. Recordings were discontinued if series resistance changed by more than 20% during the recording.\nSpontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) were recorded in voltage-clamp mode at a holding potential of \u221270 mV. Resting membrane potential and input resistance were measured in current clamp mode. Current steps (\u2212100 pA to 400 pA in 50 pA steps) were injected to record membrane voltage response. The input resistance was calculated from the slope of the linear portion of the resulting current-voltage curve. The resting membrane potential was averaged from the portions of recorded traces between current steps. A platinum-iridium concentric-bipolar electrode (125 \u00b5M diameter; FHC) was positioned on the lateral perforant pathway of each slice. A series of 30 pairs of current pulses (10\u201360 \u00b5A; 400 \u00b5s; interpulse interval 75 ms; 5 seconds between pulse pairs) were administered to evoke EPSCs. The stimulus intensity was adjusted so that responses occurred after >80% of pulses. Stimulus sweeps that failed to elicit a response with both stimuli were excluded from analysis.\n\nTissue Homogenization and Western Blot\nThe hippocampal tissue from each mouse was homogenized as described previously (\nKoren et al., 2019\n). Tissue samples were mechanically homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer (VWR) with phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 2 and 3 (Sigma), cOmplete protease inhibitor (Sigma), and PMSF (1 mM final concentration, Roche Diagnostics). Homogenates were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C at 13,000 rpm for 30 minutes. The fresh supernatant from each sample was divided into aliquots and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Protein concentration was quantified using the Pierce BCA kit (ThermoFisher, 23225).\nSample protein concentrations were normalized with lysis buffer and denatured by boiling for 5 minutes in 4x Laemmli buffer (BioRad) plus 10% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). The samples were separated on a 10% tris-glycine gel (BioRad) and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 6% non-fat dry milk (w/v) in 0.01M tris-buffered saline (TBS). All antibodies were diluted in 6% non-fat milk in TBS. Primary antibodies used are as follows: AT8 (pS202/pT205 tau; 1:2000; ThermoFisher), H-150 (human tau; 1:2000; Santa Cruz), GAPDH (1:5000; Cell Signaling Technology). Goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotech) used were diluted in 6% non-fat dry milk in TBS (w/v). Images were collected on an Amersham Imager 600 (General Electric).\n\nData Analysis\nAll electrophysiological measures (evoked action potential frequency, resting membrane potential, input resistance, spontaneous EPSC frequency, and paired pulse responses) were analyzed with MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft, Fort Lee, NJ). Statistical measures were performed with Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Data were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Data that were not normally distributed were log-transformed prior to further analysis. Data were normally distributed except where noted. A two-way ANOVA (Tukey posthoc test for multiple comparisons) with age and genotype as factors was used to compare mean values for each electrophysiological value. All data for each electrophysiological measurement were analyzed together. Some control data are presented in multiple figures for presentation clarity. Data were disaggregated by sex and no sex-dependent differences were detected for any measure, so sexes were combined for all analyses. Total cell counts for each electrophysiological measurement are summarized in\nTable 1\n. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and statistical significance was set to p<0.05 for all tests.\nTable 1.\nSummary of Replicates Used for Electrophysiological Measurements\nAge\nGenotype\nN (cells)\nInduced Action Potential Frequency\nSpontaneous EPSC Frequency\nPaired Pulse Ratio\n1.5 months\ntau\n\u2212/\u2212\n26\n20\n21\nhtau\n25\n16\n26\ncontrol\n25\n13\n22\n4 months\ntau\n\u2212/\u2212\n24\n15\n17\nhtau\n19\n11\n17\ncontrol\n35\n21\n16\n9 months\ntau\n\u2212/\u2212\n28\n23\n23\nhtau\n18\n16\n12\ncontrol\n30\n21\n19\nOpen in a new tab"

    "Methods": "2.1. Study design\nThe animal protocol for this study was approved by the Institutional Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC). All experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The basic timeline for the experiment is shown in\nFig. 1\n.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nTimeline of the study. Pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (Status) was followed by a stabilization period of 120 days. Behavioral seizures were then monitored for 30 days. A 60-day period then intervened (not shown) prior to initiating treatment. A 4-day treatment phase included two episodes of imaging (MRI), four intraperitoneal injections of Quinolinic Acid (QA), and the delivery of focused ultrasound (FUS). Behavioral seizures were then monitored for 30 days. At the end of seizure monitoring, imaging was again performed, after which animals were euthanized and prepared for histological analyses (Histo).\n\n2.2. Induction of status epilepticus (SE)\nAn established model of temporal lobe epilepsy involving pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) followed by the development of spontaneous, recurrent seizures was utilized for this study (\nToyoda et al., 2013\n). Status epilepticus was induced in 30 male Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) weighing 100\u2013150 g each. Pilocarpine hydrochloride (Sigma) was dissolved in bacteriostatic 0.9% NaCl to a final concentration of 200 mg/ml. 380 mg/kg of the pilocarpine solution was injected intraperitoneally into each rat. Thirty minutes prior to pilocarpine treatment, 1 mg/kg of scopol-amine methyl bromide (Sigma) was administered subcutaneously, in order to antagonize peripheral side effects of pilocarpine. Status Epileptics was gauged by the presence of continuous and/or repetitive motor convulsions. Thirteen animals died during or soon after pilocarpine treatment. After 2 h of SE, seizures were suppressed with diazepam administered intraperitoneally at 5\u201310 mg/kg. Diazepam treatment was repeated every 2\u20133 h for up to 6 h, in order to maintain seizure suppression. After SE, lactated Ringers solution was administered subcutaneously to maintain hydration. Sixteen of the surviving animals developed spontaneous, recurrent seizures, weighed 350\u2013425 g each, and were retained for testing. 6 male Sprague Dawley rats with similar weight and without pilocarpine injection were included in two control groups. The study was comprised of the following 7 groups:\nNo FUS/No QA\n(\nn\n= 4)\nFUSit/No QA\n: FUS targeting the intermediate-temporal hippocampus in rats with pilocarpine injection (n = 4)\nFUSit/QA\n: FUS targeting the intermediate-temporal hippocampus with QA administered in rats with pilocarpine injection (n = 4)\nFUSs-it/No QA\n: FUS targeting septal and intermediate-temporal hippocampus in rats with pilocarpine injection (\nn\n= 2)\nFUSs-it/QA\n: FUS targeting septal and intermediate-temporal hippocampus with QA administered in rats with pilocarpine injection (n = 2)\nFUSit/QA control\n: FUS targeting the intermediate-temporal hippocampus with QA administered in rats without pilocarpine injection (\nn\n= 3)\nFUSs-it/QA control\n: FUS targeting septal and intermediate-temporal hippocampus with QA administered in rats without pilocarpine injection (n = 3)\nThe rationale for assigning fewer animals to the groups in which the septal hippocampus was affected was that evidence from prior work indicated that damage to that area produced by FUS together with QA severely aggravated seizure activity, and adverse outcomes could be anticipated (\nZhang et al., 2020\n).\n\n2.3. Monitoring of behavioral seizures\nFor the animals injected with pilocarpine, a post-SE period of 120 days was allowed for stabilizing the rats\u2019 condition and allowing for the development of spontaneous, recurrent seizures. After this period, rats were video-recorded daily for 30 days to detect and quantify behavioral seizures. A 30-day recording period for the seizure frequency baseline was selected because previous evidence from this model has shown that seizure rates are either stable or increase slightly after this post-SE time frame. Recordings were begun at approximately 8:00 a.m. each day, and were continued for 10\u201311 h per day. Video recordings were reviewed in a fast-forward playback setting for identifying behavioral convulsive seizures of grade 3 (forelimb clonus) or greater (\nArida et al., 1999\n;\nRacine, 1972\n). The motor seizures were rated on a five-point scale with respect to strength: (1) Mouth and facial movements. (2) Head nodding. (3) Forelimb clonus. (4) Rearing. (5) Rearing and falling. A full motor seizure, with loss of postural control, will be referred to as a Class 5 motor seizure. Seizure frequency was measured by an investigator who was blinded to the group identity of the animals. The same video monitoring procedure was repeated for an additional 30 days post-treatment. The 6 animals in\nFUSit/QA control\nand\nFUSs-it/QA control\ngroups were monitored for 30 days post-treatment.\n\n2.4. Magnetic resonance imaging and experimental treatments\nAt the end of the initial 30 days of video monitoring, baseline MRI scans were performed. T2-weighted fast spin echo (FSE) images (repetition time/echo time [TR/TE] =4800/68 milliseconds, 2 averages, field of view = 50 mm, matrix size = 248 \u00d7 256, slice thickness = 1.0 mm) were obtained for structural assessment of the rat brains.\nAdministration of QA was then initiated with a total of 4 injections given at 6-h intervals. Quinolinic Acid (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) was dissolved in saline (10 mg/mL) and injected intraperitoneally at 80 mg/kg body weight per injection. This injection protocol was designed to achieve a relatively stable plasma concentration of QA during the period of BBB opening. Previous findings demonstrate that MR guided low-intensity focused ultrasound combined with similar dosages of QA induced focal neuronal loss in the hippocampus (\nZhang et al., 2016\n). Two hours after the third QA injection, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% induction and 2% maintenance), and microbubbles were administered. Definity\u00ae Microbubbles (300 uL/kg, mean diameter range: 1.1\u20133.3 \u03bcm, 1:20 diluted to a concentration of 5.0\u20138.0 \u00d7 10\n8\nbubbles per ml; Lantheus Medical Imaging, MA, USA) were injected through the tail vein.\nMagnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound was then delivered at an acoustic peak negative pressure of 0.4 MPa characterized using a fiber-optic hydrophone in free water (Precision Acoustics, Dorset, UK), in order to open the BBB. Sonication parameters were 650KHz, pulse duration 20-ms, duty cycle of 2%, 1-Hz pulse repetition frequency, 90-s duration per sonication. Multiple sonications were administered in the vicinity of the targeted area of the hippocampus by moving the sonication zones slightly rostro-caudally and medio-laterally. After sonicating a target on one side of the brain, the system was re-directed to sonicate the same target on the contralateral side of the brain. The MRgFUS system (Image Guided Therapy, Pessac, France) was configured as previously described (\nZhang et al., 2019\n;\nZhang et al., 2020\n). The system includes an MR-compatible, pre-focused, six-element annular array, 650-kHz transducer (spherical radius = 30\u00b12 mm, active diameter = 30 mm [focal ratio = 0.8]; Imasonic, Voray surl\u2019Ognon, France), which was connected to a phased array generator and radiofrequency power amplifier. An MR-compatible motorized positioning stage was used to move the transducer in the rostral-caudal and medial-lateral directions. The membrane in front of the transducer was filled with degassed water and inflated to ensure good ultrasonic coupling between the membrane and the head of the animal. For sonication, the animals were placed in a prone position and maintained in that position using a bite bar and ear bars. The scalp hair was shaved and removed with depilatory cream. Acoustic gel was applied between the transducer and skin. The experimental apparatus of this study is shown in\nFig. 2\n.\nFig. 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nExperimental apparatus and post contrast T1-weighted image immediately after sonication. A: FUS system, a 650-kHz transducer (T) in brown rests upon the top of the rat head and can move in X-Y planes and be focused in the Z axis.

C: Post contrast T1-weighted image immediately post sonication; enhancement of the bilateral intermediate-temporal hippocampus (black arrows) indicated BBB opening.\n\n2.5. Tissue preparation and analysis\nRats were euthanized one day after completion of the second round of behavioral monitoring with pentobarbital (>100 mg/kg, i.p.), and perfused through the ascending aorta at 30 mL/min for 1 min with 0.9% NaCl and then for 30 min with 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4). Brains were post-fixed overnight at 4 \u00b0C and then transferred into 30% (\nw\n/\nv\n) sucrose in PB. After equilibrating in the 30% sucrose solution, the brains were sectioned coronally (40 \u03bcm) with a sliding microtome. Serial sections were collected in 30% ethylene glycol and 25% glycerol in 50 mM PB and stored at 20 \u00b0C until use. A 1-in-6 series of sections were processed for Nissl staining. The sites of lesions were identified in Nissl-stained sections by an investigator blinded to the seizure frequency outcomes and to the identity of the group to which the animal belonged. The hippocampus was present in approximately 40 sections in each animal. Five areas were examined (CA1, CA2, CA3, dentate gyrus, and subiculum), and each area was assessed in three aspects of the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus (septal, intermediate, and temporal). Hippocampal damage was measured using previously reported methods (\nZhang et al., 2020\n). For each rat, series of Nissl-stained sections were evaluated with a 10 \u00d7 objective and a Neuro-lucida system (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT, USA). Contours were drawn around the hippocampus, and hippocampal volume was calculated (\nFig. 3\n). Lines were drawn along the pyramidal cell layer and granule cell layer where those cell layers were populated by neurons, but not along gaps where neuron loss occurred. The total lengths of cell layers were recorded and calculated for analysis.\nFig. 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nMethod for measuring hippocampal cell layer loss and volume loss.

Anesthesia was induced with 3.5% and then maintained with 2% isoflurane in oxygen (3 L/min). The dorsal cervical region was shaved (2 cm wide and 4 cm long) and the skin was cleaned with three alternating rounds of chlorhexidine and 70% ethanol to assure aseptic conditions. Rats were covered with a sterile drape with a cutout over the surgical site. A midline dorsal incision was made from the base of the skull to the fifth cervical segment with a scalpel. Muscle layers were retracted to access C2 vertebral process, and a laminectomy was performed at C2 to gain access to the spinal cord. The dura was cut (approximately 2 mm) and a left lateral hemisection was performed using a microscalpel. The muscles were sutured with sterile 4\u20130 Vicryl sutures and the skin closed using sterile wound clips. Throughout surgical procedures, body temperature was maintained between 37 and 38 \u00b0C by a temperature regulated, water-circulating heating pad. After wound closure, the rats were treated with 5 mL lactated Ringer\u2019s solution to prevent dehydration, as well as buprenophrine (0.03\u20130.05 mg/kg) and meloxicam (2 mg/kg) for pain.\n\nTerminal neurophysiology procedures\nAll surgical procedures have been previously described (\nGolder & Mitchell, 2005\n;\nPerim\net al.\n, 2019\n,\n2020a\n). Rats were placed in an acrylic chamber and anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in 3 L/min oxygen. Body weight was measured, and rats were transferred to a heated surgical table. Body temperature was regulated at 37.5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C and anesthesia maintained via nose cone with 3% isoflurane in 60% inspired oxygen (balance nitrogen). The trachea was exposed via midline ventral incision of the neck, and cannulated with a 1 cm polyethylene catheter (I.D., 1.67 mm) to enable mechanical ventilation (2.5 mL tidal volume, 70 breaths/min; VentElite small animal ventilator; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). End-tidal CO\n2\nwas continuously monitored via CO\n2\nanalyzer with sufficient response time to measure end-tidal CO\n2\nin rats (Capnogard; Respironics, Inc., Andover, MA), and maintained at 41 mmHg during surgical procedures by adding a small amount of CO\n2\nto the inspired gas. Anesthesia was slowly converted from isoflurane to urethane (2.1 g/kg), administered at 6 mL/hr via tail vein catheter (24 Gauge; Surflash, Somerset, NJ, USA). Bilateral vagotomy was performed ~1 cm caudal to the thyroid cartilage to prevent respiratory entrainment. The right femoral artery was isolated and cannulated (polyethylene catheter; I.D., 0.58 mm) to record pulsatile arterial pressure and withdraw arterial blood samples (60 \u03bcL per sample) at specified times during experimental protocols (ABL 90 Flex, Radiometer, OH, USA).\nA dorsal midline incision was made from the base of the skull to the fifth cervical segment. Muscle layers were retracted to expose the C3-C5 vertebrae. A laminectomy was performed at C4 vertebrae. A longitudinal cut was made in the dura mater to facilitate insertion of a 50 \u03bcm oxygen micro-optode mounted on a micromanipulator (Unisense; Aarhus, Denmark). The tip of the optical sensor was coated with a fluorophore that, when excited with 610 nm red light pulses, emits 780 nm infrared light that varies with intensity inversely proportional to the oxygen partial pressure. The micro-optode was placed on the left side 1 mm lateral to midline at ~ 1.5 mm depth to measure PtO\n2\nnear/in the phrenic motor nucleus. Coordinates were obtained from previous studies (\nMcGuire\net al.\n, 2005\n). Raw signals were acquired at 1 Hz and converted to mmHg using a two-point calibration. Saline was warmed to 37 \u00b0C and aerated with 21% oxygen over 40 minutes for the first calibration point (i.e. normoxia). Sodium hydroxide (0.1 M) and sodium ascorbate (0.1 M) were then added in warmed saline to create an anoxic solution for the second calibration point (i.e. zero oxygen). Calibration was verified\nin vivo\nby PtO\n2\nvalues reaching 0\u20131 mmHg several minutes after death from a urethane overdose (not shown).\nPhrenic nerves were isolated and cut distally. The central end of the cut nerve was desheathed and sucked into recording electrodes using negative pressure. Phrenic electrical activity was acquired at a sampling frequency of 25 kHz,10,000 fold amplified, and band-pass filtered (0.3 to 5 kHz) using a differential amplifier (Model 1700, A-M Systems; Sequim, WA, USA). The amplified and filtered signal was digitalized using an A-D converter (CED 1401; Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). Rats were paralyzed with pancuronium bromide (3mg/kg, i.v., Sigma-Aldrich; Saint Louis, MO, USA) to eliminate spontaneous respiratory muscle activity. Adequacy of anesthesia after paralysis was confirmed by the absence of blood pressure or phrenic nerve activity changes in response to toe pinch.\nApneic CO\n2\nthreshold determination was initiated at least 1-hour following conversion from isoflurane to urethane anesthesia. With stable phrenic nerve activity, end-tidal CO\n2\nwas slowly reduced by decreasing the FICO\n2\n, thereby lowering respiratory drive until sustained apnea was observed. In a few experiments, rhythmic phrenic nerve activity continued even after the inspired CO\n2\nhad been reduced to zero. In these rats, it was necessary to increase ventilator frequency to further decrease end-tidal CO\n2\n. The apneic CO\n2\nthreshold is the end-tidal CO\n2\nat which sustained apnea is observed. After 60 seconds of apnea, FICO\n2\nwas slowly and progressively increased (with ventilator frequency at 70 bpm) until rhythmic phrenic nerve burst activity resumed (i.e. the CO\n2\nrecruitment threshold). Baseline conditions were established by increasing end-tidal CO\n2\nby 2 mmHg above the CO\n2\nrecruitment threshold, and actively maintaining it there throughout the study.\n\nData analyses\nPhrenic nerve activity was rectified and integrated (0.05 s time constant) using Spike2 software (version 8.18; Cambridge Electronic Design; Cambridge, England, UK). Peak integrated phrenic nerve burst amplitude was extracted from the integrated phrenic activity. One-minute averages were calculated during baseline, at the end of the first hypoxic episode, and 30 and 60 minutes post-AIH; i.e. immediately before blood samples were drawn at the respective time points.\nThe spinal PtO\n2\nsignal was smoothed and analyzed as one-minute averages before AIH, during the nadir of the first hypoxic episode, and at the peak during reoxygenation following the first hypoxic episode. Dependent variables (i.e. PtO\n2\nand phrenic bust amplitude) were compared between mAIH and sAIH rats, or between intact-mAIH and C2Hx-mAIH rats using unpaired t-tests. Differences between ipsilateral (i.e. injury side) and contralateral phrenic amplitude in C2Hx-mAIH rats were tested using a paired t-test. Normal distribution of residual errors was assessed by visual inspection of histograms and normal probability plots. Values are expressed as mean values \u00b1 1 standard error of the mean. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. All analyses and graphs were made using R (Version 3.4.2; R Core Team, Vienna, Austria)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants were recruited from the community and outpatient centers associated with a large urban rehabilitation health system. Study information was listed on\nclinicaltrials.gov\n(\nNCT03071393\n). Enrollment criteria included adults ages 18\u201365 years, who were greater than 6 months post-SCI, C4-T12 levels. Exclusion criteria included self-reported diagnoses of cardiovascular disorders, sleep apnea, other neurologic disorders (i.e., brain injury or stroke), and pregnancy. Study procedures were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board (2016\u201301680) and were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent.\n\nParticipant Characterization\nParticipant characteristics such as age, health, and injury history were obtained via selfreport questionnaires. A clinical examination which included upper and lower extremity strength tests and injury classification using the International Standards for the Neurologic Classification of SCI (\nKirshblum et al., 2011\n) was conducted by a licensed physical therapist with expertise in SCI rehabilitation.\n\nExperimental Design\nThis study was a double-blind, randomized crossover, repeated-measures design. An outline of procedures and an experimental timeline is presented in\nFigure 1\n. Participants completed two sessions (AIH and sham sessions), at least 7 days apart. Demographics and the clinical examination were completed during the first session. Breathing measures were obtained before and after AIH and sham (pre- and post-AIH; pre- and post-sham). The delivery of AIH vs. sham was randomized for each participant. Participants and assessors administering breathing assessments were blinded to the AIH or sham intervention assignment.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nProcedures and experimental timeline. After recruitment and consenting, participants were randomized to receive an acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) or sham on Day 1. Outcomes were collected before and 30 minutes after AIH or sham. At least 7 days later, participants repeated the procedures (Day 2) but received the opposite intervention.\n\nBreathing Assessments\nExperimental set-up\nBreathing assessments were conducted while the participants reclined with their head and shoulders elevated 45 degrees on a wedge with pillows to support the head and arms as necessary. Breathing was measured using a custom circuit consisting of a flanged rubber mouthpiece attached to a disposable filter and heated neumotachograph (Hans Rudolph, Shawnee, KS, USA) connected to a non-rebreathing valve and amplifier (Hans Rudolph, Shawnee, KS, USA). This circuit enabled continuous breath-by-breath measurement of respired flow, volume and mouth pressure. Breathing assessments adhered to standard guidelines (\nAmerican Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society, 2002\n). Following acclimation to the breathing circuit and procedures, mouth occlusion pressure within 0.1s (P\n0.1\n) during quiet breathing was assessed. Subsequently, tests of maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure generation and forced vital capacity were performed in a randomized order for each participant.\nResting neuromuscular drive to breathe\nMouth occlusion pressure (P\n0.1\n) is often used as a measure of resting neuromuscular drive at the beginning of a breath (\nWhitelaw and Derenne, 1993\n). This measure is relatively independent of the resistance or compliance of the respiratory system, or lung/chest wall sensory feedback associated with a breath. A large bore tube (~1m) was attached to the inspiratory port of the non-rebreathing valve. Following 2 minutes of baseline breathing for familiarization, a study team member out of sight of the participant occluded the open end of the tubing while the participant was expiring. Subsequently, inspiration was briefly occluded (~0.5s). The occlusion was removed once inspiratory pressure exceeded \u22125.0 cmH\n2\n0. Following this first occlusion, inspiration was randomly occluded every 4\u20137 breaths until a minimum of 9 occlusions were obtained.\nMaximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure generation\nMaximal inspiratory mouth pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory mouth pressure (MEP) are standard measures of inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength, respectively (\nAmerican Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society, 2002\n). To assess MIP, participants exhaled fully while the inspiratory port of the non-rebreathing valve was plugged. Then, participants inhaled forcefully for at least 3 seconds, after which the plug was removed. MEP was assessed in a similar fashion, in that the expiratory port was plugged during a full inhalation, and then participants were asked to forcefully exhale for 3 seconds. A minimum of 4 MIP and MEP maneuvers were completed to ensure 3 tests within 10% or less variability were recorded. Participants rested a minimum of 60 seconds between attempts.\nPulmonary function\nForced vital capacity (FVC) is a standard measure air volume exhaled during a maximal effort following full inspiration (\nMiller et al., 2005\n). Using the aforementioned breathing circuit and standard test procedures (\nMiller et al., 2005\n), a minimum of 3 trials of FVC were performed to ensure at least 2 trials within 150ml were recorded. Three to five preparatory and recovery breaths were taken before and after each FVC maneuver and participants rested between attempts.\nPeak accessory breathing muscle activation\nAccessory breathing muscle activity during the maximal pressure generation maneuvers was assessed using surface EMGs recorded bilaterally from the rectus abdominis and the 6\nth\nintercostal space. After shaving excess hair and skin preparation, pairs of Ag/AgCl electrodes (MLA1010, AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA) were placed ~2.5 cm apart, centered on the muscle belly (\nOvechkin et al., 2010\n). Rectus abdominis EMGs were recorded at the level of the umbilicus, halfway between the umbilicus and the rib cage. Intercostal EMGs were recorded laterally after manual palpation of the ribs and 6\nth\nintercostal space (\nOvechkin et al., 2010\n). To allow for detection and removal of the electrocardiogram signal from the EMG recordings, a 3-lead ECG signal was recorded.\nSignals were continuously recorded at 2,000 Hz (Powerlab 16/35, AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA), monitored online using LabChart data acquisition software (Version 8.1, AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA) and stored for off-line analysis.\n\nDelivery of AIH or Sham\nParticipants remained seated, reclined with head and shoulders supported and elevated at 45 degrees for delivery of AIH or sham. The instrumentation and procedures for AIH and sham were identical. A commercially available low-oxygen generator (HYP-123, Hypoxico, New York, NY, USA) and a non-rebreather facemask were used. One minute of low oxygen air or sham was delivered through the facemask, followed by a 90-second bout when the mask was removed to allow room air breathing. This sequence was repeated 15 times. Due to the varied arm and hand impairments in some participants and for consistency, the study staff managed use of the mask to ensure a secure fit and transition between bouts. During AIH, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO\n2\n) was measured with an oxygen analyzer (Handi+, Maxtec, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) and participants received a 10.3% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO\n2\n), and 20% FiO\n2\nwas delivered for the sham. Vital signs were monitored for adverse responses. SpO\n2\nwas continuously monitored via a finger pulse oximeter (Infrared Plethysmograph Finger Clip, AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA). Blood pressure was monitored via an arm cuff at the end of every other hypoxic or sham interval. Following delivery of AIH or sham, participants rested for 30 minutes and then post-tests were conducted.\n\nOffline Data Processing\nData were processed offline using LabChart software (Version 8.1, AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA). Flow, volume, and pressure signals were smoothed using a 0.01-second moving average. To determine P\n0.1\n, a custom script was used to determine inspiration onset and pressure generation 0.1s after onset was quantified. A minimum of eight pressure traces were assessed and averaged for each test session. MIP and MEP were determined by identifying the minimum or maximum value of the pressure trace for each attempt, respectively. FVC was assessed from the volume traces using the Spirometry Module of LabChart. The single best attempt for these maneuvers (MIP, MEP, FVC) was used in the analysis (\nAmerican Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society, 2002\n). This approach was used to capture each individual\u2019s maximal performance or capacity. Automated LabChart scripts were used to detect the fluctuations (peak and trough) of SpO\n2\nassociated with the hypoxic, sham and room air intervals.\nEMGs were full-wave rectified and high-pass filtered at 30 Hz. Custom LabChart scripts were used to \u201cblank\u201d the ECG artifacts from the original signals, and a matching length of data from the preceding time window was then copied and inserted into the signal, similar to research devices designed for the same purpose (\nChowdhuri et al., 2008\n). Subsequently, the signal was smoothed using a 6 Hz low-pass filter. Peak EMG amplitudes during the MIP and MEP maneuvers were determined within a window spanning from the inspiration or expiration preceding the MIP or MEP attempt, respectively, to the end of the recovery inspiration or expiration following the MIP or MEP attempt, respectively. This window length was used to ensure that the maximal motor output associated with the maneuvers was captured. Since we sought to determine if motor output was increased post-AIH and individuals with SCI use varied motor strategies, we reasoned that our analysis should broadly include all motor activity associated with the maneuvers. Custom LabChart scripts were used to calculate the average of a 100ms window around the peak amplitude. Peak EMG activity was zeroed by subtracting baseline EMG activity. Baseline EMG activity was based on the mean EMG amplitude calculated from 1s of baseline or quiet activity recorded ~2s before the maneuver. The average of 3 peak amplitudes was calculated for maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure generation for each participant. Post-intervention EMG amplitudes were normalized to pre-intervention amplitudes, yielding an EMG percent change score for AIH and sham.\n\nStatistics\nBreathing outcome data were analyzed to determine if AIH induced a greater improvement from baseline compared to sham. Data were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and were examined for kurtosis and skewness. FVC outcomes were normally distributed and were assessed using a 2\u00d72 repeated-measures fully-within analysis of variance. MIP, MEP, and P\n0.1\noutcomes were non-normally distributed. Thus, the effects of AIH versus sham on these outcomes were assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests; separate tests were conducted to assess differences between baseline sham and AIH values and post AIH and sham change scores. To further characterize breathing outcomes following AIH and sham, Cohen\u2019s d effect sizes were calculated using formulas for parametric or non-parametric analyses as appropriate (\nIvarsson et al., 2013\n). Sham and AIH EMG percent change scores were compared using Wilcoxon sign-rank tests. Statistical significance was established at p<.05.\nPrevious reports have established MIP and MEP correlate with neurologic level of injury (\nMateus et al., 2007\n). Thus, secondary analyses were conducted using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to determine if baseline MIP, MEP, and post-intervention changes were different for participants with cervical versus thoracic level injuries. Previous reports also have demonstrated an inverse relationship between P\n0.1\nand MIP in populations with ventilatory weakness (\nBudweiser et al., 2007\n;\nCapdev\u00efla et al., 1995\n). Spearman\u2019s correlations were used to examine the relationships between MIP and P\n0.1\nat baseline and between change scores due to AIH or sham.\nStatistics were calculated using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA). Results are presented as means (parametric analyses) or medians (non-parametric analyses) \u00b1 95% confidence interval (CI). Uncorrected p values are reported (\nGreenland et al., 2016\n;\nRothman, 1990\n;\nSaville, 1990\n)."

    "Methods": "All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and followed standards established by the NIH and The Ohio State University animal care guidelines. Female Sprague Dawley rats (~250 g; Harlan Laboratory) were used for all studies to facilitate comparison with our prior work (Goodus et al., 2018;Sauerbeck et al., 2015). All rats were randomly assigned to treatment groups and all outcome measures were assessed in a blinded manner. Rats were housed in a climate-controlled facility (22\u201324 \u00b0C) in ventilated cages with a 12-h light/dark cycle with lights on between 0700 and 1900 local time. Ad libitum access to water was provided in each cage. All rats were group-housed up to 3 rats per cage. Rats were fed a nutritionally complete diet (Teklad Global 16% Protein Rodent Diet) consisting of 66% energy from carbohydrate, 22% from protein and 12% from fat.\n\n2.1. Bile duct ligation (BDL)\nBile duct ligation (BDL) is commonly used as a model of biliary acid accumulation and hepatic inflammation (\nKountouras et al., 1984\n;\nMarques et al., 2012\n). Here this model was used since it is simple and reliable and could easily be adapted to our SCI model. To determine when significant hepatic inflammation occurs after BDL, pilot studies were conducted. Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). After laparotomy, the common bile duct was exposed at the level of the duodenum. Two methods were used to ligate the common bile duct. The first was a permanent BDL method in which two nylon 4\u20130 sutures were spaced 0.5 mm apart around the common bile duct to occlude bile flow. The second method referred to \u201creversible BDL\u201d or \u201crBDL\u201d used a single strand of 0.5 mm wide umbilical tape tied around the common bile duct. The thick umbilical tape obstructed bile flow while also allowing for subsequent easy removal and restoration of bile flow, which is not possible with sutures. Control sham surgeries involved laparotomy and bile duct exposure without ligation. The laparotomy was closed with a continuous suture and animals were injected with 10 cc of saline and 0.25 cc of 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine subcutaneously for pain relief. Buprenorphine can have inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects on different tissues and systems, including the liver (\nBlaha and Leon, 2008\n;\nGuarnieri et al., 2012\n;\nHerv\u00e9 et al., 2004\n). Thus, all rats receiving a laparotomy were administered buprenorphine for 5 days to eliminate any confounds from drug-induced effects on hepatic inflammation. Animal weights were monitored, and daily injections of saline were given to maintain hydration. At 1d or 5d post-ligation or post-sham surgery (\nn\n= 5/group), rats were anesthetized with 1.5\u00d7 surgery dose of ketamine/xylazine and exsanguinated via intracardiac perfusion with DEPC-treated phosphate buffered saline (PBS). A 0.5 g segment of fresh liver was collected from the right medial lobe and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total fresh liver weight and body weight were noted. This study revealed consistent and significant hepatic inflammation by 5d compared to time-matched sham controls, so in subsequent studies, SCI was induced at 5d post-BDL or 5d post-rBDL.\n\n2.2. Moderate midthoracic spinal cord contusion injury\nBriefly, 5d after BDL or rBDL, a laminectomy was performed at T8 and the exposed spinal cord was contused using the Infinite Horizons device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation) at 200 kD (\nSauerbeck et al., 2013\n;\nTripathi and McTigue, 2008\n). Back muscles were sutured, and the skin was closed with wound clips. For rats in the rBDL+SCI group, the laparotomy was re-opened and the umbilical tape around the bile duct was carefully removed to restore bile flow. Sham rats received a similar laparotomy and bile duct exposure. The abdominal cavity was sutured, and rats proceeded to SCI surgery. Twice daily manual bladder expressions were performed until spontaneous voiding returned (~14d post-injury).\n\n2.3. BDL + SCI experimental groups\nIn the permanent BDL study, rats were randomized into the following groups: laparotomy sham (\nn\n= 5), BDL (n = 5), SCI (received sham BDL surgery;\nn\n= 8) and BDL + SCI (\nn\n= 10). Five rats in the permanent BDL + SCI died from a ruptured bile duct (\nn\n= 2) or ascites accumulation (\nn\n= 3) ~20d post-SCI, leaving n = 5 in the BDL + SCI group. All BDL and BDL + SCI rats exhibited signs of jaundice and changes in urine acidity by the endpoint of the study.\n\n2.4. rBDL + SCI experimental groups\nRats were randomized to the following groups: laparotomy sham (\nn\n= 4), rBDL (n = 4), SCI (received sham rBDL surgery;\nn\n= 7), and rBDL+SCI (n = 7). A subsequent independent replication rBDL experiment was performed with sham (n = 3), rBDL (n = 3), SCI (\nn\n= 6), rBDL+SCI (n = 6) groups. Rats were sacrificed at 28 days post-ligation/23 days after BDL release + SCI. No pre-mature mortality occurred, and no rats exhibited signs of jaundice or changes in urine acidity.\nAn additional cohort of rats was used to examine gene expression of cytokines in the injured spinal cord and liver acutely at 1 dpi. Rats were randomized to the following groups: laparotomy sham (n = 4), rBDL (n = 4), SCI (received sham rBDL surgery; n = 4), and rBDL+SCI (n = 4).\n\n2.5. Open field activity assessment via activity box\nThree-dimensional movements of individual animals in an open-field environment were measured using an activity monitoring device (Opto-M3, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) as previously described (\nPopovich et al., 2014\n). Animals were placed in activity boxes for 30 min. Data for each 30-min period was divided into three 10-min segments and averaged. Animals were tested pre-BDL then at 1-, 2- and 3-weeks post-SCI.\n\n2.6. Hindlimb locomotor assessment\nAll rats were acclimated to handling and testing in the open field environment prior to any surgeries. Rats were tested by two trained observers blinded to the treatment groups at 1 and 5 days post-BDL and on days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14 and 21 days post-SCI using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale (\nBasso et al., 1995\n). Hindlimb scores for each rat were averaged and used to create group means at each day. BBB subscores were calculated and reported as previously described (\nMcTigue et al., 2007\n). If BBB and activity box testing fell on the same day, activity box testing occurred at least 2 h after BBB testing.\n\n2.7. Tail vein blood collection\nLateral tail vein blood samples were collected every 4\u20135 days. Rats were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and tails were immersed in warm water. A 28-gauge butterfly needle was inserted into one of the veins and ~ 500 \u03bcl of whole blood was collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 300\ng\nunder sterile conditions to separate serum and plasma. ~200 \u03bcl of serum and plasma were collected from each rat at each time point. Flash-frozen aliquots of serum and plasma were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until analysis.\n\n2.8. CSF collection\nCSF from the cisterna magna was collected just after tail vein blood was withdrawn. Rats were affixed to a stereotaxic frame; a midline incision was made at the nape and the underlying muscles were cut and separated to expose the cisterna magna. A pulled glass capillary with a ~ 40 \u03bcm beveled tip was inserted through the dura. ~50 \u03bcl of CSF (without blood contamination) was slowly withdrawn with a 1 ml syringe that was affixed to the open end of the glass capillary via fitted rubber tubing under sterile conditions. Samples were flash frozen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until analysis. The muscles were sutured, and the incision closed with surgical staples. Animals were returned to their home cages and allowed to recover on heated pads until fully ambulatory.\n\n2.9. Fetuin-A intraspinal microinjections\nRecombinant Fetuin-A (Sigma; SRP6217) was diluted in 0.9% saline vehicle solution. All solutions were filter sterilized using a 0.22 \u03bcm filter and mixed immediately before use. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (~ 250 g;\nn\n= 27) were randomly assigned to treatment groups (0.9% saline vehicle control, 10 \u03bcM Fetuin-A and 100 \u03bcM Fetuin-A (\nn\n= 8/group)), then anesthetized for surgery as above. Using aseptic technique, a laminectomy was performed at the T8 vertebral level. Custom pulled UV-sterilized glass micropipettes beveled to an outer tip diameter of 25\u201340 \u03bcm were loaded with the proper solution. Two independent microinjection experiments using a hydraulic micropositioner were completed (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). The first group received a unilateral microinjection into the white matter/gray matter border (\nn\n= 3/group) using coordinates 0.7 mm lateral and 1.1 mm ventral to the dorsal spinal cord midline. The second was unilaterally microinjected into the ventral gray matter (\nn\n= 5/group) using coordinates 0.5 mm lateral and 1.2 mm ventral to the dorsal spinal cord midline. A 500 nl bolus injection was slowly administered using a PicoPump (World Precision Instruments). Injection sites were labeled with sterile charcoal (Sigma), muscles surrounding the laminectomy were sutured, skin was stapled with wound clips, and rats were given 5 ml sterile saline subcutaneously before being placed into a heated recovery cage. Rats were transcardially perfused with saline followed by 4% PFA 3 days post-injection as described earlier (\nGoldstein et al., 2017\n). Spinal cords were sectioned at 10 \u03bcm and collected sections spanned the entire rostral to caudal extent of the injected area, as previously described (\nGoldstein et al., 2017\n).\n\n2.10. Tissue extraction and preparation\nAt the end of each SCI study, rats were fasted for 6 h, then anesthetized with 1.5\u00d7 surgical dose of ketamine/xylazine. Cardiac blood samples were collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 300\ng\n. Serum and plasma were removed, flash frozen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until analysis. Next, rats were exsanguinated with DEPC PBS and a 0.5 g segment of fresh liver was collected from the right medial lobe and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Next, rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M PBS. Liver samples, brains and spinal cords were removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 2 h and transferred to 0.2 M phosphate buffer (PB) overnight. Total fixed liver and body weights were recorded. Samples then were removed from PB and cryoprotected for 2\u20133 d in 30% sucrose solution. Fixed liver, brain and spinal cord samples were quickly frozen on dry ice and blocked using optimal cutting temperature (OCT) solution. 10 \u03bcm thick spinal cord and 20 \u03bcm thick brain and liver sections were sectioned on cryostat at \u221220 \u00b0C and slide-mounted (Super-frost Plus Slides, Fisher Scientific). Slides were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until used.\n\n2.11. Serum and CSF alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bile salts, ammonia, endotoxin, glucose, insulin and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) analysis\nSerum ALT (Point Scientific, A7526), bile salts (Cell Bio Labs, STA-631) and endotoxin (Thermo Scientific Pierce, 88282), and plasma ammonia (Sigma-Aldrich, AA0100 were measured using spectrophotometric clinical assays at 450 nm with a microplate reader (ELx 800 uv; BIO-TEK Instruments Inc., Winooski, Vt) in accordance with manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Serum glucose was measured using a clinical assay in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Point Scientific, G7521-120) at a wavelength of 340 nm using a spectrophotometer (DU 600; Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA). Serum insulin was measured using a commercial ELISA kit (Millipore Corporation, EZRMI-13 K) by an enzyme immunoassay at 450 nm with the aforementioned microplate reader. Serum NEFAs were measured spectrophotometrically using a commercially available assay (Wako Diagnostics, 294\u201363601), as previously described (\nLi et al., 2017\n).\n\n2.12. Serum TNF\u03b1 and serum and CSF fetuin-A analysis\nTNF\u03b1 was measured in serum samples using an ELISA kit (AbCam Cat# ab46070) according to manufacturer\u2019s directions. Serum and CSF Fetuin-A was measured with an ELISA kit (BD ELISA MBS019821, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer\u2019s directions.\n\n2.13. Liver histology\nImmunohistochemistry was performed on liver sections as previously described (\nGoodus et al., 2018\n;\nSauerbeck et al., 2015\n). Briefly, anti-CD11b (Ox42; Serotec, MCA275, 1:2000) and anti-Clec4f (ThermoFisher Scientific, PA5-47396, 1:400) were used to visualize liver macrophages (Kupffer cells). Anti-Myeloperoxidase (MPO) (ThermoFisher Scientific, DOM00001G, 1:100) was used to visualize neutrophils and anti-CD3 (Abcam, ab5690, 1:2000) was used to visualize T cells in the liver. Liver non-heme iron was visualized using Perls Prussian Blue reagent and H-Ferritin visualized immunohistochemically (Santa Cruz, sc-376,594, 1:1000) as previously described (\nSchonberg et al., 2012\n;\nSchonberg and McTigue, 2009\n). All liver antibody protocols include sections treated without primary or secondary antibodies and routinely show an absence of labeling. Oil Red O histology (Sigma, cat# O0625) was used to assess lipid accumulation as previously described (\nSauerbeck et al., 2015\n). Hematoxylin and eosin was used to visualize hepatocyte ballooning, inflammatory infiltrates and lipid deposition in the liver as previously described (\nBruno et al., 2008\n;\nMasterjohn and Bruno, 2012\n).\n\n2.14. Brain and spinal cord histology\n20 \u03bcm thick coronal cross-sections of the brain were used to visualize microgliosis and astrocytosis in the cortical gray matter as previously described (\nGoodus et al., 2016\n;\nMorrison et al., 2017\n). Briefly, Iba1 (Wako, 019-19741, 1:2,000) was used to visualize microglia/macrophages and anti-GFAP (Dako, Z0334, 1:15,000) was used to visualize astrocytes. Cross-sections of the spinal cord spanning the rostral to caudal extent of the lesion and microinjection sites were used for immunohistochemistry as previously described (\nGoodus et al., 2018\n;\nSauerbeck et al., 2013\n). Briefly, axons and white matter were visualized with anti-neurofilament (NF) antibody (DSHB, RT97, 1: 2000) and eriochrome cyanine (EC), respectively. Anti-CD11b (1: 2000) and anti-CD68 antibodies (Serotec, MCA341GA, 1:1000) were used to visualize macrophages/microglia. Neurons were visualized with anti-NeuN antibody (EMD-Millipore, MAB377, 1: 25,000). All spinal cord antibody protocols include sections treated without primary or secondary antibodies and routinely show an absence of labeling.\n\n2.15. Tissue analysis and quantification\nImmunolabeled tissue sections were imaged at 16\u00d7 magnification using an Axioplan 2 imaging microscope equipped with an AxioCam digital camera and AxioVision v.4.8.2 software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). An investigator blinded to experimental groups performed all histological analyses using either MCID elite imaging software (Imaging Research Inc.,\nhttps://mcid.co.uk\n.), Image J (NIH,\nhttps://imagej.nih.gov/ij/\n), or MIPAR image analysis software (\nhttps://www.mipar.us/\n). Liver sections were randomly selected from each group. The proportional area of Clec4f, CD11b, Oil Red O and Perls Prussian Blue stain was quantified from 6 random fields per section by dividing the labeled \u201ctarget\u201d area by the total hepatocyte area measured in each field. Staining levels are expressed as % of total hepatocyte area. MPO+ neutrophils and CD3+ T cells were counted in 6 random fields, and the average number of stained cells per field was reported. Liver sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin were scored for signs of NAFLD and NASH as previously described (\nBruno et al., 2008\n;\nMasterjohn and Bruno, 2012\n).\nThe density of Iba1+ microglia/macrophages and GFAP+ astrocytes in brain sections was quantified and averaged from 5 coronal brain sections spaced 100 \u03bcm apart in each brain, as previously described (\nGoodus et al., 2016\n;\nMorrison et al., 2017\n). The proportional area of Iba1 and GFAP was quantified in a 200 \u03bcm \u00d7 200 \u03bcm region in the cortical gray matter using MIPAR imaging software.\nFor spinal cords, the injury epicenter was identified as the section with the least myelin (EC) labeling; analyses of spared white matter at the lesion epicenter and in 10 sections spaced 200 \u03bcm apart for a total of 2 mm analyzed rostral and caudal to the epicenter were completed using Cavalieri estimation (\nMcTigue et al., 2007\n). The total immunoreactivities for CD68+ macrophages/microglia were quantified and converted to proportional area of the intact spinal cord tissue using MCID and ImageJ software at the lesion epicenter and in 10 sections spaced 200 \u03bcm apart for a total of 2 mm analyzed rostral and caudal to the epicenter. Areas of missing tissue were excluded from all analyses.\nFor Fetuin-A microinjected spinal cords, CD11b+ microglia/macrophages, NeuN+ neurons and Perls iron images were digitized and thresholded using MCID and/or ImageJ analysis software. Sample boxes (0.0961 mm\n2\n) were placed in the lateral white matter/gray matter border and ventral gray matter at both injection sites. The area of CD11b+ and Perls+ labeling was reported as a % of the total sample area in the white and gray matter. NeuN+ neurons were counted via MCID and/or ImageJ software.\n\n2.16. Analysis of gene expression\n250 mg of frozen liver tissue and 100 mg of frozen spinal cord epicenters were homogenized in Trizol Reagent (15,596,018, Life Technologies) to preserve nucleic acids. Samples were frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C until used. RNA was isolated by a standard extraction protocol using chloroform/phenol (\nAlmad and McTigue, 2010\n;\nSauerbeck et al., 2015\n). The purity of all samples was assessed prior to amplification using microdrop spectrophotometry. The extracted RNA was synthesized into cDNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Expression of specific genes was assessed using quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (Applied Biosystems). Each qPCR reaction used 100 ng of cDNA with QuantiTec primers for tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1\u03b1), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), Fetuin-A and SYBR green for detection (\nTable 1\n). The amplification of each sample was normalized using Quantum RNA18S (Applied Biosystems) gene expression as a control standard. The relative mRNA expression in each sample was determined with the \u0394\u0394CT method and reported as fold-change vs. Sham controls (\nSchmittgen and Livak, 2008\n).\nTable 1.\nPrimers for rtPCR quantification of gene expression in rats.\nName\nForward sequence\nReverse sequence\nTNF-\u03b1\nTCGTAGCAAACCACCAAGCG\nATGGCAGAGAGGAGGCTGACTTTC\nIL-1\u03b1\nTCACTCGCATGGCATGTGCTGA\nTCGGGCTGGTTCCACTAGGCT\nIL-1\u03b2\nGAAGATGGAAAAGCGGTTTG\nAACTATGTCCCGACCATTGC\nTGF\u03b2\nTGCTAATGGTGGACCGCAA\nCACTGCTTCCCGAATGTCTGA\nFetuin-A\nTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG\nTAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGG\n18S\nTTCGGAACTGAGGCCATGAT\nTTTCGCTCTGGTCCGTCTTG\nOpen in a new tab\n\n2.17.

Student\u2019s\nt\n-test, 1-way ANOVA or 2-way repeated measures ANOVA were used to examine main effects for all study endpoints when appropriate. Bonferroni post-hoc test was used to examine group differences following statistically significant main effects found via 1-way ANOVA; Bonferroni post-hoc test was used to examine group differences via 2-way repeated measures ANOVA. Outliers that were greater than 2 times the standard deviation were identified for each data set via Grubb\u2019s test and excluded from analysis. All analyses were considered statistically significant at\np\n< .05. Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated using the formula (Glucose concentration (mg/dl) \u00d7 Insulin concentration (mU/L))/40.5 (\nAntunes et al., 2016\n)."

    "Methods": "Participants.\nFourteen individuals with SCI (mean age 46.9\u00b111.9 years, 2 females; 12 males;\nTable 1\n) participated in the study. All participants gave informed consent to the experimental procedures, which were approved by the local ethics committee at Northwestern University and performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (IRB protocol #202027). Participants with SCI had a chronic injury (\u22656 months) and were classified using the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury examination as having a C4-C7 level SCI and by the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale as C (n=7) or D (n=7). Recruitment was done through a research volunteer database at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab (SRALab). Participants needed to have a preserved ability to voluntarily produce a visible grasping movement in at least one hand. Two individuals were not able to perform pinch grip on the left side (participant #16,\nTable 1\n) and on the right side (participant #17,\nTable 1\n). Only grip data was used from these individuals. No adverse clinical events were recorded in this study.\nTable 1.\nDemographic characteristics of study participants. AISA, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale.

Following screening and informed consent, participants received instructions to maintain normal activity and not alter their medications. All experiments were performed at the SRALab in Chicago, IL, USA.\n\nStudy Design.\nWe conducted a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled and cross-over study consisting of one session each of AIH and sham AIH (i.e., normoxia). Prior to the first visit, a member of the study staff who was not involved with data collection randomized subjects with a computer-based random number generator. The two interventions were separated by at least one week to minimize carryover effects. Outcome measures (see below) were recorded prior to, and for up to 5 hours post-AIH, and on the next day.\nTo determine the cumulative effects of successive AIH administration, we performed a second protocol in six individuals from the first study (marked by * in\nTable 1\n). In this protocol, participants visited the laboratory on three consecutive days. They received AIH on the first two days. Outcome measures were recorded prior to, and for up to 5 hours post-AIH on both days. These participants visited the laboratory on a third day for outcome measures. No sham AIH was given in this protocol. Study designs are illustrated in\nFigure 1\n.\nFigure 1. Study Experimental Design.\nOpen in a new tab\nPanel A: In the first protocol, outcome measures (marked by downward arrows) were collected prior to administration of AIH or sham AIH (baseline), every 30 minutes for up to 5 hours post-intervention (T\n0\n\u2013 T\n5\n) and at 24 hours post-intervention (T\n24\n). The AIH protocol consisted of 15, 60-second alternating episodes of inspiring hypoxic air (~9% O\n2\n) with ambient room air (20.9% O\n2\n). Sham AIH consisted of episodes of normoxia. Panel B: In the second protocol, AIH was administered on two consecutive days, and outcome measures were obtained prior to and after AIH on both days (marked by downward arrows), as well as on day 3.\n\nAIH Administration.\nParticipants were fitted with a latex-free full non-rebreather mask using a custom neoprene head strap. A single AIH sequence was administered using a hypoxia generator (Model HYP-123, Hypoxico Inc., New York, NY, USA), constituting 60 seconds of 9% O\n2\n(Fraction of inspired air [FIO\n2\n]: 0.09), alternating with 60 seconds of 21% O\n2\n(FIO\n2\n: 0.21). The delivery of hypoxia and normoxic air mixtures was repeated 15 times per session, for a total of 30 minutes; oxygen saturations (SpO\n2\n) were between 82\u201388% during hypoxic exposures. Sham AIH consisted of alternating exposures to normoxic air. Heart rate and oxygen saturation (SpO\n2\n) were recorded continuously during the AIH administration, and blood pressure measurements were made prior to and after each administration.\n\nOutcome Measures.\nDuring each session, hand dynamometry and clinical performance tests were performed. The testing order was constant for all participants and conditions: grip strength and pinch strength, Nine Hole Peg Test (9-HPT), and Box and Block Test (BBT). For hand dynamometry, participants began with the pretest measurements of grip and pinch strength, which were followed by 30 minutes of AIH or sham AIH. A follow-up assessment was done immediately after intervention (T\n0\n) and then every 30 minutes for the next 5 hours (i.e., T\n0.5\n\u2013 T\n5\n). Individuals visited the laboratory for another measurement on the next day, the 24-hour time-point (T\n24\n). Functional tests were performed prior to and at 0, 1, 4, and at 24 hours post-intervention (i.e. T\n0\n, T\n1\n, T\n4\nand T\n24\n).\n\nHand Dynamometry.\nParticipants were seated with the shoulder adducted and neutrally rotated, elbow positioned at 90\u00b0; the forearm and wrist were in a neutral position. The forearm was in neutral rotation, and was not supported by arm rest or research personnel. Grip strength for each hand was measured using a hand dynamometer (Jamar Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer, Model: 5030J1). Measurement of maximal voluntary force was conducted by asking the subject to contract the hand against the handgrip. Each contraction lasted for approximately 3 to 5 seconds, and was repeated 3 times on each hand after a rest period of at least 1 minute. The average of 3 trials was used for each assessment. Maximal key pinch strength was tested using a digital dynamometer (MicroFet4, Hoggan Health Industries, West Jordan, UT). Participants held the dynamometer between the lateral aspect of the middle phalanx of the index finger and thumb pad. Similar to hand-grip assessment, they were instructed to squeeze as hard as they could for 3 s. Maximal pinch grip force was measured on each trial, and the average of 3 consecutive maximal pinch force measurements was calculated for each individual.\n\nFunctional Tests.\nClinical hand performance was tested using the 9-HPT and BBT. The 9-HPT test is a measure of finger dexterity and involves the placement of pegs from a container into holes on a board, and subsequent removal, as quickly as possible. The total number of seconds until task completion was recorded, measured by when the subject touched the first peg to when the last peg was placed back into the container. The BBT is a measure of manual dexterity that requires repeatedly moving 1-inch blocks from one side of a box to another in 60 seconds. For both tests, an average of two tests at each time-point was calculated for assessment.\n\nStatistical Analyses.\nPerformance metrics were averaged across all observations in a given time-point for each participant. A liner-mixed model repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM ANOVA) was used to examine the effect of intervention (AIH, sham AIH) and time point (BL \u2013 T\n24\n) on grip strength, pinch strength, and hand function. The Tukey\npost hoc\ntest was used to identify significance in individual comparisons. For the second protocol, one-way RM ANOVA was used to examine the effect of time (BL \u2013 T\n48\n) on grip and pinch strength. The repeated measures linear mixed model takes into account correlation across time for the same subjects and interventions. Values are reported as mean \u00b1 1 standard error of the mean (SEM). A 2-sided P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nYoung adult C57BL/6J mice (Jackson laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were maintained at ambient temperature and humidity with a 14-hour light/10-hour dark cycle and fed standard chow\nad libitum\n. Similar numbers of males and females were used for the study, thus reducing sex bias (\nWill et al., 2017\n). Thus, the combined data from both sexes are presented in this study. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Kentucky and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS).\n\n2.2. IHK mouse model of TLE and video monitoring for behavioral seizures\nSix to eight-week-old males and females (49 \u00b1 1 day-old mice, n = 111 total) were anesthetized under isoflurane and unilaterally injected with 50\u2013100 nl (85.6 \u00b1 1.2 nl) of sterile 0.9% saline (42 mice; 26 females and 16 males) or kainate (69 mice; 35 females and 34 males; KA, 20 mM in saline; Tocris Biosciences, Minneapolis, MN, USA) using the following stereotaxic coordinates relative to the bregma (anterior-posterior, \u22122.0 mm; medial-lateral, \u22121.25 mm; dorsal-ventral, \u22121.60 mm) as described previously (\nKrook-Magnuson et al., 2013\n). In order to minimize losses of mice caused by status epilepticus (>30 minutes of Racine stage 3\u20135 seizure;\nTrinka et al., 2015\n), diazepam (7.5 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 1 hour after the first Racine stage 5 seizure, characterized by tonic-clonic convulsions, rearing, running, jumping and falling (\nRacine, 1972\n). Saline-injected mice (i.e., sham controls) also received intraperitoneal injections of diazepam. All postsurgical mice were individually housed and recovered in the vivarium. Three to four weeks after KA (n = 60, 29 females and 31 males) or saline (n = 42, 26 females and 16 males) injection, spontaneous behavioral activities were video-recorded continuously for 24 hours a day for 3 days using video cameras and Sirenia software (version 1.7.10; Pinnacle Technology, Lawrence, KS, USA) without implanting EEG electrodes. IHK mice that displayed Racine stage 3\u20135 seizures at least two times during the 3-day video recordings were defined as \u201cepileptic\u201d mice and used in this study.\n\n2.3. Video-EEG recordings\nFour to five weeks after KA (n = 8) or saline (n = 4) injection, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and ipsilaterally implanted with a 2-channel depth electrode (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA, USA) in stereotaxic coordinates (anterior-posterior \u22122.5 mm, medial-lateral \u22121.75 mm, dorsal-ventral \u22121.25 mm with respect to bregma) as described in previous studies (\nKrook-Magnuson et al., 2013\n). Implanted electrodes were firmly secured on the skull using mounting screws and dental cement. One week after the surgery, the mice were monitored by synchronized video-EEG recording for 24 hours a day for 3 days. Electrodes were connected to the 3-pin head mount (Plastics One), which was connected to the customized Mouse Preamplifier (Pinnacle Technology). EEG data were acquired at a 500 Hz sampling frequency with 500 Hz low pass filter and 1.0 Hz high pass filter using 8401-HS Data Conditioning and Acquisition System (Pinnacle Technology). LED-equipped video cameras were projected from the top of cages for video recordings. Synchronized video-EEG files were acquired with Sirenia Acquisition software (version 1.7.10) and 8400 Tethered Mouse System (Pinnacle Technology), and analyzed using Sirenia Seizure Pro software (version 1.8.0; Pinnacle Technology).\n\n2.4. Behavioral tests: Open field test and object location memory test\nFour weeks after injection, IHK (n = 9) and sham control (n = 10) mice were subjected to the open field test followed by the object location memory (OLM) test. All behavioral tests were performed in a dedicated quiet room, where light illumination and temperature were maintained at 45\u201348 Lux and 20\u201322\u00b0C. Open field test was performed to examine anxiety-like behaviors based on locomotive activities. Mice were brought in their home cages from the vivarium to the testing room and acclimated at least 1 hour prior to the test. A clear acrylic arena (40 width \u00d7 40 length \u00d7 35 height cm) was placed on a table where the testing area was separated from experimenters by curtains. Mice were placed in the open arena one at a time, and their locomotive activities were digitally recorded for 5 minutes using the GigE Basler acA1300\u201360gc camera (Noldus, Wageningen, Netherlands) and analyzed by the video tracking software, Ethovision XT 13.0 (Noldus). The area of the arena was digitally divided into 25 equal squares (5 \u00d7 5) and the 9 center squares were defined as the center zone. Each video file was encrypted and analyzed to acquire total traveled distance, mean speed of movement, and cumulative time spent in the center zone during the 5 minutes. The arena was cleaned with 10% ethanol and water using a paper towel after each use.\nWe performed the OLM test, known as a hippocampal-dependent learning paradigm, to determine whether IHK mice displayed hippocampus-dependent memory impairment as reported earlier (\nBui et al., 2018\n;\nKim et al., 2020\n). Based on the published protocol (\nVogel-Ciernia and Wood, 2014\n), after mice were handled for 5 days (2 minutes per day), they were habituated in an empty open field arena (white acrylic, 23 width \u00d7 30 length \u00d7 23 height cm) filled with regular bedding for 6 days (5 minutes per day). On the following day, mice were trained for 10 minutes by placing them in the arena where two identical objects were symmetrically placed in two locations (i.e., familiar locations). 24 hours after the training, mice were tested for 5 minutes by placing them back in the arena, where one of the two identical objects was randomly moved to a novel location. Locomotive activities during the 10-minute training and 5-minute testing were digitally recorded using the GigE Basler acA1300\u201360gc camera (Noldus). All objects were sanitized with 10% ethanol and water between animals. Video files were encrypted for unbiased analysis. Exploration time on each object during the training and the testing periods were measured using the manual scoring mode of Ethovision XT 13.0 (Noldus), while excluding behaviors such as rearing or mounting on the objects, or digging on the ground near the objects. The discrimination index (DI) was calculated as: (time exploring the novel object \u2212 time exploring the familiar object) / (time exploring the novel object + time exploring the familiar object) \u00d7 100. We excluded data from mice that failed to explore both objects for >3 seconds during the training or testing, or if animals displayed DI values less than \u221220 or greater than +20 due to a significant location bias during the training session, as previously described (\nVogel-Ciernia and Wood, 2014\n).\n\n2.5. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings\nHorizontal hippocampal slices (300 \u03bcm) from ventral hippocampi were prepared from both sexes of C57BL/6J mice 8\u20139 weeks after IHK or saline injection. All data in this study originating from the ventral hippocampus were from a restricted area (dorsal-ventral: approximately \u22122.4 to \u22123.6 mm from Bregma; 4 ipsilateral and 4 contralateral slices from each mouse). The slices were assigned for electrophysiology or immunohistochemistry (1:1). For electrophysiology, brain slices were incubated in sucrose-containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) for one hour at 33\u00b0C, and then stored at room temperature until electrical recording. ACSF contained, in mM, 85 NaCl, 75 sucrose, 25 glucose, 24 NaHCO\n3\n, 4 MgCl\n2\n, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, and 0.5 CaCl\n2\n. For immunohistochemistry, brain slices were fixed immediately in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Hippocampal slices destined for electrophysiology were transferred to a recording chamber in ACSF containing, in mM, 126 NaCl, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 10 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 2CaCl\n2\n, 2 MgCl\n2\n, and 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n. Slices were visualized with an upright microscope (Eclipse FN1; Nikon Instruments Inc., Tokyo, Japan) with infrared-differential interference contrast optics.\nTo examine intrinsic properties of CCKBCs, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CCKBCs were performed in current-clamp configuration using the pipette solution containing (in mM) 126 K-gluconate, 4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.3 GTP-Na, 10 phosphocreatine, and 5.4 biocytin with a pH of 7.2 and osmolarity of 290\u2013295 mOsm. Patch pipettes had resistances of 3\u20135 M\u03a9. All electrical recordings were made at 33\u00b0C using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Electrical signals were filtered at 10 kHz using a Bessel filter and digitized at 20 kHz with a Digidata 1440A analog-digital interface (Molecular Devices). Series resistance was carefully monitored; electrical recordings were discarded if the series resistance changed >20% or reached 25 M\u03a9. The recorded traces were analyzed using Clampfit software (Molecular Devices, version 10.7.0) and Mini Analysis (Synaptosoft Inc., Fort Lee, NJ, USA; version 6.0.7). Subthreshold and suprathreshold membrane responses of CCKBCs were evoked from resting membrane potential by 1 second current steps (\u2212200 to +300 pA, +50 pA increments). To examine connections of CCKBC with CA1 PCs, we performed paired whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from presynaptic CCKBCs and postsynaptic CA1 PCs as previously described (\nLee et al., 2017\n,\n2015\n,\n2014\n,\n2010\n). Membrane potential of presynaptic CCKBCs was adjusted to \u221260 mV. Postsynaptic CA1 PCs were recorded in voltage clamp at a holding potential of \u221270 mV. The CA1 PC pipette solution contained (mM) 90 K-gluconate, 40 CsCl, 10 phosphocreatine, 10 HEPES, 3.5 KCl, 2 Mg-ATP, 1.8 NaCl, 1.7 MgCl\n2\n, 0.4 Na\n2\nGTP, and 0.05 EGTA, with a pH 7.2, and osmolarity of 290 mOsm. Trains of action potentials (APs) in presynaptic CCKBCs were evoked in current clamp by 2 millisecond depolarizing current steps (+2 nA, 50 current steps at 10 Hz) every minute to evoke unitary IPSCs (uIPSCs) in CA1 PCs.\nTo examine overall CCK+ interneuron-mediated inhibition of CA1 PCs, we used carbachol, which is known to excite CCKBCs, but not parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (\nKarson et al., 2008\n), as previously described (\nWyeth et al., 2010\n). To examine the carbachol-induced increase in amplitude and frequency of IPSCs in CA1 PCs, we recorded from CA1 PCs in voltage-clamp configuration at a holding potential of \u221270 mV. The pipette solution contained (in mM) 90 K-gluconate, 40 CsCl, 10 phosphocreatine, 10 HEPES, 5 QX314, 3.5 KCl, 2 Mg-ATP, 1.8 NaCl, 1.7 MgCl\n2\n, 0.4 Na\n2\nGTP, and 0.05 EGTA, with a pH 7.2, and osmolarity of 290 mOsm. QX314 included in the pipette solution blocks muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChRs)-mediated current in CA1 PCs (e.g., persistent sodium current;\nYamada-Hanff and Bean, 2013\n). NBQX (10 \u03bcM) and APV (40 \u03bcM) were included in the ACSF to block excitatory synaptic transmission mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors. High-speed perfusion of the ACSF (7\u20138 ml/minute) was used, since high oxygen supply is critical for carbachol-induced CCK+ interneuron network activity (\nH\u00e1jos and Mody, 2009\n).\nIntrinsic and synaptic properties of CCKBCs were measured as we previously described (\nArmstrong et al., 2016\n;\nKang et al., 2018\n;\nLee et al., 2017\n,\n2015\n). Briefly, intrinsic properties were measured from their voltage responses to a series of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current steps from the resting membrane potential. The following properties were examined using Clampfit software (Molecular Devices): (1) Resting membrane potential was measured from the average voltage after an equilibration period. (2) Input resistance was measured from voltage responses to small current steps (1 second duration; \u221250 to +50 pA in 50 pA increments). The slope of current-voltage curve was calculated at steady state (0.8\u20131.0 second from the start of current steps). (3) Membrane time constant was measured from voltage responses to 1 second hyperpolarizing steps (\u221250 pA). Single exponential functions were fitted to the voltage responses from the start of current step to the hyperpolarization peak to measure decay time constant. (4) Sag amplitude was measured from the voltage responses to 1 second hyperpolarizing steps (\u2212300 pA). Sag was defined as the difference between the hyperpolarization peak and the average voltage at steady state (0.8\u20131.0 second from the start of current step). (5) AP threshold, amplitude, and half-width were measured from the first three APs evoked by a 1 second depolarizing current step (+200 pA). AP threshold was defined as the point at which the derivative of the membrane potential (dV/dt) first exceeded its mean by two standard deviations during the interspike interval. AP amplitude was measured from threshold to peak; half-width was defined as the AP duration at one half AP amplitude.\nCCKBC-mediated inhibition in CA1 PCs was calculated using current responses in postsynaptic CA1 PCs to APs generated in presynaptic CCKBCs. uIPSC amplitude and success rate were measured from 2\u20133 trains of 50 APs (10 Hz) in CCKBCs (1 minute interval between each train of 50 APs) using Clampfit software (Molecular Devices). All current responses in CA1 PCs were visually inspected and inward current responses were defined as uIPSCs only if they started within 3 ms from the peak of presynaptic APs and their amplitude was greater than three times the root mean square (RMS) noise level. In case of CCKBC-CA1 PC pairs showing no uIPSCs (i.e., \u201cnot connected pairs\u201d) we examined all current responses in CA1 PCs immediately after evoked APs in CCKBCs and found no uIPSCs that were relatively well timed locked to the peak of presynaptic APs in connected pairs as we previously described (\nLee et al., 2017\n,\n2015\n,\n2014\n,\n2010\n). We averaged current responses to trains of 50 APs (2\u20133 trains for each \u201cnot connected pair\u201d) to further examine whether there were missed uIPSCs when each sweep was examined individually. All current averages from not connected pairs revealed no deviation from baseline, as expected. In contrast, the current averages showed prominent inward currents (>3x RMS) when both successful events and not successful events were used to generate current averages (\nFig. 6D\n). Connection probability was calculated as the number of connected pairs/the number of tested pairs.\nFigure 6.\nOpen in a new tab\nIntrinsic and synaptic properties of surviving CCKBCs in IHK mice. (A) A representative image of a CCKBC. The CCKBC was filled with biocytin during electrical recordings and was imaged using Zeiss confocal microscope.

APs in CCKBCs were evoked by 2 millisecond depolarizing current steps (2 nA) from a membrane potential of \u221260 mV. uIPSCs in CA1 PCs were measured at a holding potential of \u221270 mV. Black traces show individual currents in CA1 PCs and APs in CCKBCs and red traces show the mean of all currents and APs. (E, F, G) Summary of connection probability, uIPSC amplitude, and success rate of CCKBC-to-CA1 PC pairs. The numbers in E represent connected pairs/tested pairs. The numbers in the bars (F and G) represent the numbers of pairs.\nAmplitude and frequency of spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) were measured using Mini Analysis. A 2-minute control recording before bath application of carbachol and an additional 5-minute recording in carbachol for each CA1 PC were used for measuring amplitude and frequency of sIPSCs and CCK+ interneuron-mediated IPSCs, respectively. The IPSCs were manually detected using Mini Analysis and included for this study only if amplitudes of the synaptic currents were greater than three times RMS noise level as previously described (\nButler et al., 2016\n).\n\n2.6. Interneuron identification\nAll CCKBCs were identified based on firing properties (i.e., accommodating AP firing pattern),\npost hoc\nanatomical properties (i.e., preferential location of axon terminals in the CA1 PC layer), and expression of an immunohistochemical marker (i.e., cannabinoid type 1 receptor, CB\n1\n) in axon terminals, as we previously described (\nKang et al., 2018\n;\nLee et al., 2017\n,\n2015\n,\n2014\n,\n2010\n;\nLee and Soltesz, 2011\n). We also used other immunohistochemical markers (i.e., CCK and GABA\nB\nreceptor 1, GABA\nB1\nR) and found that all tested CCKBCs (n = 8) manifested immunopositivity for CCK and GABA\nB1\nR, which is in agreement with previous findings (\nLee et al., 2010\n;\nLee and Soltesz, 2011\n).\nBriefly, interneurons were first selected under infrared-differential interference contrast based on soma location in the stratum radiatum, large cell bodies and multipolar shape, and accommodating firing pattern. After electrical recordings with pipettes containing biocytin, the slices were fixed in a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and stored at 4\u00b0C for 24\u201348 hours. The slices were washed in phosphate buffer and cryopreserved with 30% sucrose solution. They were embedded and frozen in OCT compound (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA), and cryosectioned using Leica Cryostat CM-1950 (Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany) at 60 \u03bcm thickness. Biocytin-filled cells were stained with streptavidin conjugated with Rhodamine Red-X (\nTable 1\n; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA) and subjected to acquire tile scans of Z-stacks using Airyscan mode of a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at the Digital Microscopy Core Facility at UAMS. Using Zen 2.3 (Blue Edition; Zeiss) Z stack images were projected two-dimensionally and stitched together in order to reconstruct biocytin-filled neurons. The sections were then subjected to immunohistochemistry using primary and secondary antibodies shown in\nTable 1\n. For primary antibodies against CB\n1\n, pro-CCK, and GABA\nB1\nR, tissues were pre-treated with 0.2 mg/ml pepsin in 0.2 N HCl at 37\u00b0C for 10\u201315 minutes and washed in phosphate buffer. All tissues were blocked in 5\u201310% normal goat serum (NGS) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4) containing 0.3% Triton-X 100 for 1 hour at room temperature and followed by incubations in primary and secondary antibodies diluted in TBS with 0.3% Triton-X 100 and 1% NGS. After washing thoroughly in TBS with 0.05% Tween-20, the sections were mounted in Vectashield medium and subjected to Z-stack image acquisitions using a Nikon C1 confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc.) equipped with S Fluor 40x NA 1.3 objective lens.\nTable 1.\nList of reagents used for fluorescence microscopy\nReagent type\nProduct name\nManufacturer\nCatalog number\nDilution\nPrimary antibody\nMouse anti-NeuN\nMillipore\nMAB377\n1:100\nRabbit anti-GFAP\nAbcam\nAb7260\n1:500\nGuinea pig anti-CB\n1\nFrontier Institute Co.\nCB1-GP-Af530\n1:2,000\nRabbit anti-Calbindin\nSwant\nCB-38a\n1:500\nRabbit anti-vGAT\nSynaptic Systems\n131003\n1:1,000\nRabbit anti-proCCK\nFrontier Institute Co.\nCCK-pro-Rb-Af350\n1:1,000\nMouse anti-GABA\nB1\nR\nAbcam\nAb55051\n1:5,000\nSecondary antibody\nGoat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), AF 488\nInvitrogen\nA11001\n1:500\nGoat anti-mouse IgG2a, AF 555\nInvitrogen\nA21137\n1:500\nGoat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), AF 594\nInvitrogen\nA11005\n1:500\nGoat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), AF 488\nInvitrogen\nA11008\n1:500\nGoat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), AF 594\nInvitrogen\nA11012\n1:500\nGoat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), CF 633\nBiotium\n20122\n1:500\nGoat anti-Guinea Pig IgG (H+L), AF 488\nInvitrogen\nA11073\n1:500\nOther\nDAPI\nInvitrogen\nD1306\n1:1,000\nRhodamine Red-X (RRX) Streptavidin\nJackson ImmunoResearch\n016-290-084\n1:500\nOpen in a new tab\n\n2.7. Quantification of CCK+ interneuron somata and presynaptic terminals in the CA1 region of the hippocampus\nA. Immunohistochemistry and image acquisition.\nSince we performed electrical recordings using a restricted area of the ventral hippocampus (dorsal-ventral: approximately \u22122.4 to \u22123.6 mm from Bregma), we performed quantification of CCK+ interneuron number using a similar area of the ventral hippocampus from 10 sham control and 8 IHK mice. Horizontal ventral hippocampal slices (300 \u03bcm thickness) destined for immunohistochemistry were placed in fixative solution (4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) and stored at 4\u00b0C for 24\u201348 hours. After washing in phosphate buffer, fixed brain slices were embedded in OCT Compound (Fisher Scientific) and resectioned at 30 \u03bcm thickness using a cryostat (Leica CM-1950). The sections were then subjected to immunohistochemistry using primary and secondary antibodies shown in\nTable 1\n. For primary antibodies against NeuN, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), pro-CCK, and GABA\nB1\nR, the sections were pre-treated with 0.2 mg/ml pepsin in 0.2 N HCl at 37\u00b0C for 10\u201315 minutes and washed in phosphate buffer. All tissues were blocked in 5\u201310% NGS in TBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.3% Triton-X 100 for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by incubations in primary and secondary antibodies diluted in TBS with 0.3% Triton-X 100 and 1% NGS. After washing thoroughly in TBS with 0.05% Tween-20, the sections were mounted in Vectashield medium and subjected to Z-stack image acquisitions using a Nikon C1 confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc.) or a Zeiss LSM 880 inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss). Images were analyzed with Fiji (version 1.0), ImageJ (version 1.50i), or Zen 2.3 (Blue Edition; Zeiss) software.\nImmunohistochemical data were obtained from ventral hippocampal slices that were fixed by immersion and resectioned. Similar resectioning of fixed brain slices was used for quantification of GABAergic interneurons in animal models of TLE (\nArmstrong et al., 2016\n;\nCossart et al., 2001\n). Importantly, a similar degree of CA1 GABAergic interneuron loss in animal models of TLE was reported, regardless of fixation method. For example, immunohistochemical results showed 42% and 46% loss of CA1 somatostatin-positive interneurons in a pilocarpine model of TLE when brains were fixed by transcardiac perfusion (\nDinocourt et al., 2003\n) and when brain slices were fixed by immersion and resectioned (\nCossart et al., 2001\n), respectively. Thus, immunostaining of interneuron markers on resectioned hippocampal slices for interneuron quantification in TLE is a well-validated quantification method.\nB. Quantification of CCK+/GABA\nB1\nR+ interneuron somata in the CA1 region.\nThree to four 30 \u03bcm-thick hippocampal sections were obtained from each sham control and IHK mouse. Those sections were stained with anti-pro-CCK and GABA\nB1\nR antibodies as described in\nsection A\n. Using a 20x objective (Plan-Apochromat 20x/0.8, M27) controlled by a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope, 3\u00d73 tile-scanned Z stack images (1275 \u03bcm \u00d7 1275 \u03bcm) of the CA1 region were acquired at 3 \u03bcm intervals (total 4 sections) and projected into 2-dimensions. Pro-CCK+/GABA\nB1\nR+ neurons from sham controls and TLE mice were manually counted in a double-blinded manner. The volume of the CA1 region used for soma quantification was measured and the number of counted neurons was normalized to tissue volume. These image analyses were conducted using the \u201cPolygon Contour\u201d and \u201cMarker\u201d modules in Zen 2.3 software (Blue Edition; Zeiss). The mean of CCK+ interneuron numbers within each animal was used to determine whether there was a difference in CCK interneuron numbers between sham control and IHK mice.\nC. Quantification of CB\n1\n+/vGAT+ boutons in CA1 layers.\nThree to four 30 \u03bcm-thick resectioned ventral hippocampal sections from each sham control (n = 10) and IHK mouse (n = 8) were stained with anti-CB\n1\nand vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT) antibodies as described in\nsection A\n. Using a Zeiss LSM 880 inverted confocal microscope equipped with a 100x oil objective (Plan-Apo 100x/1.46 oil DIC III), Z-stack image series were acquired for the CA1 layers (i.e., stratum oriens, stratum pyramidale, stratum radiatum, and stratum lacunosum moleculare) at 0.4 \u03bcm Z-interval per resected slice. Due to high densities of CB\n1\n+/vGAT+ boutons in the stratum pyramidale, cropped Z stack images (40 \u03bcm \u00d7 40 \u03bcm \u00d7 1.2 \u03bcm in the x, y, and z axes) were used for bouton quantification in the stratum pyramidale. Larger Z stack images (85 \u03bcm \u00d7 85 \u03bcm \u00d7 1.2 \u03bcm in the x, y, and z axes) were used for CB\n1\n+/vGAT+ bouton quantification in other CA1 layers (i.e., stratum oriens, stratum radiatum, and stratum lacunosum moleculare). The number of CB\n1\n+/vGAT+ boutons within Z-stack images of each layer was manually counted in a double-blinded manner using \u201cCell Counter\u201d Plugins available in Fiji or ImageJ. The mean of CCK+ axon terminal numbers within each animal was used to determine whether there was a difference in the number of axon terminals of CCK interneurons between sham control and IHK mice.\nD. Quantifying somatically projecting CB\n1\n+ axon terminals closely juxtaposed to CA1 PCs.\n30 \u03bcm-thick ventral hippocampal sections from sham controls (n = 6) and IHK mice (n = 5) were stained with anti-CB\n1\n(for CCK+ interneurons) and anti-calbindin antibodies (for CA1 PCs) as described in\nsection A\nand used to generate Z-stack image series. Using a Zeiss LSM 880 inverted confocal microscope with a 100x oil objective (Plan-Apo 100x/1.46 oil DIC III), Z-stack images (0.4 \u03bcm interval) were obtained from the stratum pyramidale. As previously described (\nArmstrong et al., 2016\n), 2 image sections (85 \u03bcm \u00d7 85 \u03bcm) that were separated at least by 2.4 \u03bcm were chosen for the analysis from each Z-stack in order to avoid double counting of CB\n1\n+ boutons juxtaposed to calbindin+ somata of CA1 PCs. Encrypted images were analyzed by researchers blind to animal treatment or identity using the \u201cMarker\u201d and \u201cPolygon Contour\u201d analysis modules available in Zen 2.3 software. The sum of perimeters of calbindin+ CA1 PCs was obtained and used to normalize the number of juxtaposed CB\n1\n+ boutons in each analyzed image.\n\n2.8. Statistical analysis\nUnpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t-tests were used to compare two groups when the data showed a normal distribution on the basis of the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test (\nFig. 3\n). If the data did not show a normal distribution, a Mann\u2013Whitney Rank Sum test (for unpaired data) was used (\nFig. 3\n). One-way or two-way ANOVAs were followed by Tukey or Dunn\u2019s tests (\nFigs. 4\n,\n5\n,\n6\nand\n7\n). Fisher\u2019s exact test was used for connection probability between presynaptic CCKBCs and postsynaptic CA1 PCs (\nFig. 6E\n). Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K\u2013S) test was used with Bonferroni\u2013Holm multiple corrections (\nFig. 7B\n,\nD\n). Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was followed by Tukey tests for mean comparisons (\nFig. 8\n). Data were presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant (*\np\n< 0.05; **\np\n< 0.01; ***\np\n< 0.001; ns, not significant). Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaPlot 14 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) or Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).\nFigure 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nIHK mice manifest elevated anxiety-like behaviors and memory impairment.

    "Methods": "Animal handling and care\nFemale C57bl/6J mice (8\u201310 weeks of age) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and used in all experiments. All animals were housed in groups of 3\u20135 in temperature-controlled conditions under a light/dark photo-cycle with food and water supplied ad libitum.\nLasmiditan was obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and dissolved in saline/0.1% DMSO. To determine the MB effect of lasmiditan in the spinal cord under physiological conditions, na\u00efve mice were treated with 0.1 mg/kg lasmiditan, intraperitoneally (i.p.) once daily for 3 days followed by euthanasia using isoflurane overdose and subsequent isolation of the T10\u201312 region of the spinal cord.\nIn the SCI model, mice were randomized into sham and SCI groups. Animals were anesthetized with 10 mg/kg ketamine and 6 mg/kg xylazine via i.p injection and continuously monitored for spontaneous breathing. Mice underwent a complete single-level laminectomy at the thoracic vertebral arch (T10\u201312) and spinal cord was exposed (\n6\n,\n10\n). The vertebral column was clamped and stabilized at the upper thoracic and lumbar levels, and a controlled contusion with a force of 80 kilodynes and 0 second dwell time was administered using the Infinite Horizon IH-0400 impactor (Lexington, KY) with the dura intact. Sham mice received laminectomy only. Manual bladder expression was performed twice daily until functional recovery. Injured mice were further randomized into lasmiditan- or vehicle-treated groups and treated i.p with either 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 mg/kg lasmiditan or vehicle control beginning 1h after injury and continuing daily until euthanasia.

Samples were agitated for 2\u2009h at 4\u00b0C and then centrifuged at 14,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 15\u2009min and the supernatant collected. Protein was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid assay, and 10\u201312\u2009\u03bcg of protein was separated via electrophoresis using 4\u201315% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST and incubated overnight with primary antibodies with constant agitation at 4\u00b0C. Membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized using chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) on a GE ImageQuant LAS4000 (GE Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). Optical density was determined using Image Studio Lite software. Primary antibodies used were as follows: PGC-1\u03b1 (1:1000), Occludin (1:1000), Claudin-5 (1:1000), and \u03b1-tubulin (1:1000). All primary antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK).\n\nTransmission Electron Microscopy\nApproximately 4\u2009mm\n2\nsamples of T10\u201312 spinal cord were fixed overnight in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1\u2009M PIPES buffer (pH\u20097.4) then transferred to PBS at which point they were delivered to the University of Arizona Microscopy Alliance Core, where they were placed in 0.1\u2009M PIPES buffer (pH\u20097.4) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Samples were then transferred to 0.1\u2009M PIPES/Glycine buffer for 30\u2009min at room temperature, then washed in deionized water (diH2O) twice for 5\u2009min each, placed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1h, washed twice in diH2O for 10\u2009min, then stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1\u2009h and washed again in diH2O for 10\u2009min. Samples were then dehydrated with increasing ethanol dilutions (5\u2009min, 50, 70, 90, 100%) and acetone (2\u2009\u00d7\u20095min), infiltrated with 1:1 acetonitrile/Spurr\u2019s resin overnight, then 100% Spurr\u2019s resin for 24h and flat-embedded overnight at 60\u2009\u00b0C. Cross-sections of the spinal cord samples (80\u2009nm) were cut on an RMC PTXL ultramicrotome, placed onto uncoated 150-mesh coper grids and counterstained with 2% lead acetate for 2\u2009min. Images were viewed by FEI Tecnai Spirit microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) operated at 100\u2009kV and captured using an AMT 4 Mpixel camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Woburn, MA) at a magnification of 4200X. Images of myelinated axons were captured for analysis; our sampling did not discriminate ascending or descending tracts of the spinal cord. Mitochondrial count and morphology were analyzed using the analyze particles plug-in in ImageJ FIJI. In all cases, 5\u20136 images were evaluated containing 145\u2013241 mitochondria for each spinal cord sample (n=1) by a trained observer blinded to the treatment groups. Images were analyzed for the average mitochondrial number per field and average mitochondrial area per field, and normalized to axonal area per field. Analysis of mitochondria were restricted to axons.\n\nMitochondria Isolation\nMitochondria were isolated from the na\u00efve spinal cord or the injury site (approximately 5mm of spinal cord centered at the epicenter (\n6\n)) 3d post-treatment using techniques modified as previously described (\n30\n). The isolated spinal cord segments were immediately transferred into a Teflon-glass dounce homogenizer, each containing approximately 2ml mitochondrial isolation buffer (215 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA; pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH). The tissues were homogenized manually using 20\u201330 strokes and were centrifuged at 1,300\ng\nfor 3 minutes. The supernatants containing mitochondria were transferred to fresh tubes and spun at 13,000\ng\nfor 10 minutes. Mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in approximately 700 \u03bcL isolation buffer. The mitochondria trapped in the synaptosomal vesicles were released by pressurized N\n2\ncell disruption at 1,200 psi for 10 minutes. The resulting total mitochondrial suspensions were centrifuged at 10,000\ng\nfor 10 minutes. The pellets were resuspended in 50 \u03bcL isolation buffer (without EGTA). Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Cat # 23,227) recording the absorbance at 560 nm on Biotek Synergy HT plate reader (Winooski, VT).\n\nAnalysis of Oxygen Consumption\nOxygen consumption rate (OCR) of isolated mitochondria was measured from the na\u00efve spinal cord or the injury site after 3d of treatment using the Seahorse Bioscience XF-96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (\n30\n). On the day prior to the assay, the sensor cartridge of Extracellular Flux kit was soaked in XF calibrant solution and kept at 37\u00b0C overnight. Before loading, carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP) was diluted appropriately in respiration buffer (RB) (215 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 0.1% BSA, 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, and 2.5 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, adjusted pH 7.2 with KOH) pre-warmed at 37\u00b0C, containing 5 mM pyruvate and 2.5 mM malate. Mitochondria were diluted in RB and 6 \u03bcg mitochondria were loaded per well in a volume of 30 \u03bcL. The assay plate was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 4 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Final volume per well was brought to 100 \u03bcL with RB. Initial OCR was measured before and after injection of FCCP (6\u2009\u03bcM) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to measure the uncoupled OCR (FCCP-OCR) (\n20\n). For each n, samples were run in triplicate and OCR averaged.\n\nBMS Assessment\nLocomotor capability was assessed using the ten-point (0\u20139) Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) (\n30\n) by two trained observers blinded to experimental groups. Each mouse was observed for 4 min, with bladder expression taking place prior to assessment. Animals were observed 24h after surgery and every week thereafter until euthanasia. Sham animals maintained full locomotor capabilities with a BMS score of 9 throughout the experiment.\n\nSpontaneous locomotor activity\nSpontaneous locomotor activity was assessed in na\u00efve and SCI mice in a Digiscan Animal Activity Monitor system (Omnitech Electronics Model RXYZCM(\n8\n) TAO, Columbus, OH, USA), (\n26\n,\n31\n). Mice were placed in plexiglass chambers with photocell emitters and receptors spaced equally along the perimeter, creating a grid of infrared beams measuring total distance and vertical activity. Total distance was determined by centimeters travelled. Mice were tested in a darkened environment, and data were collected continuously for 10 min at the same time of day for each group.\n\nLesion Volume Analysis\nHistopathological analysis was performed on injured spinal cords following 7d treatment. Mice were transcardially perfused with 0.1 M PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). A 1cm segment of the spinal cord centered on the injury epicenter was removed and post-fixed in PFA for 2h, then washed in 0.2 M phosphate buffer overnight at 4\u00baC. Tissues were then cryoprotected in 20% sucrose with 0.1% sodium azide at 4\u00baC until the spinal cords sank (\u22653 days). Spinal cords were trimmed to 6 mm segments centered on the injury sight and frozen in OCT at \u221280\u00baC. The entire 6mm was cryosectioned into 10 \u03bcm coronal sections and every section collected.\nEriochrome cyanine (EC) staining for myelin was used to distinguish damaged and spared myelinated tissue (\n32\n). Slides were warmed for 60 minutes at 37\u00baC, then hydrated in dH\n2\nO, submerged in acetone for 2 minutes, and rehydrated in dH\n2\nO. Slides were exposed to serial dilutions of decreasing concentrations of ethanol and incubated in EC solution for 30 minutes. Selective myelin staining was obtained by differentiation in 0.3% ammonium hydroxide for 30 seconds. Slides were then exposed to serial dilutions of increasing ethanol concentrations. Analyses were performed in a blinded fashion, with respect to treatment group, using the EVOS M5000 Imaging System microscope (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) at 40X magnification and ImageJ software. Lesion and spared tissue areas were quantified across 2mm of spinal cord centered on the epicenter at 100 \u03bcm intervals using the Cavalieri method (\n24\n,\n32\n), totaling 21 sections per animal.\n\nImmunofluorescence\nSlides containing frozen sections were washed in 1% Tris-Triton Buffer (TTB) (50 mM Tris Saline, pH 7.6) for 30 min then blocked in 4% normal goat serum for 60 min. Sections were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight in primary antibody claudin-5 (1:50) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) in TTB containing 4% normal goat serum. Secondary antibody Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488) (1:1000) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) in TBB was applied for 60 min at room temp. Sections were counterstained with DAPI (Life Technologies Corporation, Eugene OR), mounted with gold antifade reagent (Life Technologies Corporation, Eugene OR), cover slipped and imaged using the EVOS M5000 Imaging System microscope (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) at a final magnification of 200X. Images were captured from the ventral horn 1mm caudal to the epicenter of injury (\u00b1 10\u03bcm) as determined by the sample\u2019s respective EC analysis.\n\nEvan\u2019s Blue Extravasation\nIntegrity of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) was assessed at 7d post-SCI using Evans Blue (EB) dye extravasation (\n24\n,\n33\n). Evans Blue dye (2%, 0.08 mL) was administered via intraocular injection and allowed to circulate for 30 minutes. Mice were then transcardially perfused with saline and a 6mm segment of spinal cord centered at the epicenter was collected. EB dye was extracted in formamide at room temperature for \u2265 3d and optical density values of the prepared samples were measured at 620 nm with a Spark multimode microplate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). EB content was calculated as ng dye/mg tissue using a standard curve.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nFor all studies, an individual mouse represents one\nn\n(\nn\n=\u20091). Behavioral assays were\nn\n=8 sham mice and\nn\n=9\u201310 injured mice per group and data were analyzed using Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. Differences in mtDNA, protein expression, total EB content and OCR between all three groups (Sham, SCI + vehicle, SCI + lasmiditan) were analyzed using One-way ANOVA and with\nn\n=5\u20136. Histological analysis between two injured groups (SCI + vehicle, SCI + lasmiditan) as well as analysis of na\u00efve studies (vehicle, lasmiditan) were performed using two-tailed TTEST and with\nn\n=5\u20136. In all cases, GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA) was used and a p<0.05 was considered indicative of a statistically significant difference between mean values. For expression analyses, different superscripts are indicative of statistically significant differences, while bars with the same superscript are not significantly different. For BMS scores (\nFigure 1.A\n), \u201ca\u201d denotes a statistically significant difference of 0.1 mg/kg lasmiditan compared to SCI + Vehicle, \u201cb\u201d denotes a statistically significant difference of 0.01 mg/kg lasmiditan compared to SCI + Vehicle and \u201cc\u201d denotes a statistically significant difference compared with day 1.\nFig. 1. Effect of lasmiditan on locomotor recovery post-SCI and MB in the na\u00efve spinal cord.\nOpen in a new tab\nMice were subjected to moderate SCI followed by daily administration with either 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 mg/kg lasmiditan or vehicle beginning 1h after injury and continuing for 21d (A). Data are representative of 8 sham mice and 9\u201310 mice per SCI group and are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM (\na\np<0.05 0.1 mg/kg lasmiditan compared to SCI + Vehicle,\nb\np<0.05 0.01 mg/kg lasmiditan compared to SCI + Vehicle and\nc\np<0.05 compared to Day 1 by Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. Injured mice treated with 1.0 mg/kg lasmiditan were not significant from SCI + Vehicle. Na\u00efve mice were exposed to lasmiditan (0.1 mg/kg i.p) or vehicle daily for 3d. The spinal cord was extracted and analyzed for mtDNA content (B). Scale bar=2\u03bcm. Mitochondria were also isolated and uncoupled mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates (FCCP-OCR) were measured for complex I-driven respiration using Seahorse XF96 analyzer (C). An additional cohort of na\u00efve mice were treated with lasmiditan or vehicle daily for 3d. Spinal cord was extracted, fixed and imaged using transmission electron microscopy (D) to obtain the number of mitochondria (E) and mitochondrial area (F) per field. Analysis of mitochondrial number and mitochondrial area per field were also normalized to axonal area per field (G,H). Data represent n=5 and are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM (*\np\n<\u20090.05\ncompared to Vehicle\nby two- tailed student\u2019s t-test)."

    "Methods": "Generation of knock out mice and maintenance of mouse colony\nMice lacking GPR37 (\nGpr37\n\u2212/\u2212\n) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (strain\nGpr37\ntm1Dgen\n, stock number 005806). This strain contains a bacterial LacZ reporter gene in the Gpr37 locus. To ensure uniformity of genetic background, these mice were backcrossed with wild-type mice (The Jackson Laboratory) for ten consecutive generations. The successful deletion of\nGpr37\nwas then confirmed via DNA sequencing and the loss of GPR37 protein expression validated by western blotting brain tissue samples from WT and\nGpr37\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice with an anti-GPR37 antibody (MAb Technologies). All mice were housed in a 12-hour light/dark cycle with food and water available\nad libitum\nand all experiments performed prior to 5:00 pm. Male mice were used for all stroke induction paradigms. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory University.\n\nAntibodies\nThe following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal to GPR37 (Mab Technologies, WB 1:1000); chicken polyclonal to \u03b2-gal (Abcam, ab9361, IHC 1:500) ; mouse monoclonal to CC1(Millipore, OP80, IHC 1:500); rat monoclonal GFAP(Invitrogen,13-0300, IHC 1:500); goat polyclonal to Iba1(Abcam, ab5076, IHC 1:500); mouse monoclonal to NG2 (Santa Cruz, sc 53389, IHC 1:200); rabbit polyclonal to Olig2 (Millipore, AB9610, IHC 1:500); rabbit polyclonal to Sox2 (Stemgent, 09\u20130024, IHC 1:200); rabbit polyclonal to cleaved Caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9661, IHC 1:200). Secondary antibodies were species specific Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 568, or Alexa Fluor 647 immunoglobulin G (IgG) (heavy and light chains) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:500).\n\nFocal ischemia stroke model\nA sensorimotor cortex ischemic stroke was induced within\nGpr37\n\u2212/\u2212\n, WT littermate controls and C57BL/6 mice (male mice, 2\u20133 months of age). This paradigm used was induced based on prior reports of barrel cortex stroke with mofified artery occlusion protocols (\n30\n,\n31\n). Animals were given ketamine/xylazine (ketamine 80\u2013100 mg/kg i.p., xylazine 10\u201312.5 mg/kg, i.p.) anesthesia following which the right middle cerebral artery was permanetly ligated (10-0 suture, Surgical Specialities CO, Reading, PA, USA). The production of right sensorimotor ischemia was then followed by bilateral occlusions of the common carotid artery for seven minutes and reperfusion. This modified ischemic procedure resulted in the production of a specific infarct formation within the right sensorimotor cortex.\nBefore and after surgery, the animals were housed in groups of 5 animals per cage, and allowed access to food and water\nad libitum\n. During the surgery and in the recovery phase, animal body temperature was monitored using a rectal probe and maintained at \u00b137\u00b0C by a homeothermic blanket control unit (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, US) and animals were kept within a ventilated humidity controlled incubator (Thermocare, Incline Village, NV, USA) . Before surgery, animals were given a single dose of meloxicam (oral, 5 mg/kg), followed by daily doses of meloxicam (oral, 5 mg/kg) for three days post-surgery. Following the surgery animals were monitored for 60min to confirm proper recovery from anesthesia and monitor locomotor activity and animal health. The overall mortality rate for this paradigm was 5%. Mice were sacrificed with an overdose of isoflurane and decapitation three days following stroke. The brains were then immediately removed and transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde or stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Emory University School of Medicine.\n\nWestern blot\nIsolated protein samples were reduced and denatured in Laemmli buffer and then analyzed via SDS-PAGE. Samples were loaded onto 4\u201320% Tris-glycine gels (BioRad) and then subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad). For analysis via chemiluminescence, membranes were blocked in 5% milk (5% non-fat milk in 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma) in ultrapure water) and then incubated shaking overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies. Densitometric protein quantification was performed using ImageJ software.\n\nImmunofluorescence\nFor immunohistochemistry, brains were removed and postfixed for 24hrs. at 4\u00b0C in 4% PFA. The brains were then cryopreserved at 4\u00b0C in a solution of 30% sucrose/PBS overnight. From each brain 40\u03bcm frozen sections were cut coronally using a freezing microtome. Sections were collected, three per well into 96 well plates containing cryoprotectant solution (\nTBS/30% ethylene glycol/15% sucrose/0.05% sodium azide)\nand stored at \u221220\u00b0C prior to histological processing. Sections were then washed with PBS, incubated in 1% H\n2\nO\n2\n, washed again with PBS and then blocked for 60 min in a solution containing 1M Tris-Brij 35 (pH 7.5), 0.3% Triton X-100/15% normal goat serum before overnight incubation with specified primary antibody diluted in Tris-Brij 35 (pH 7.5). To make a 1M Tris-Brij solution, Brij 35 (30%) was used to make a final working buffer containing 2.5% Brij 35 in 1M Tris. Sections were then rinsed in Tris-Brij 35(pH 7.5) and incubated for two hours with specified secondary antibodies. In instances where signal amplification was necessary, TSA amplification(\n32\n) (Akoya Biosciences) was utilized. For double labeling experiments, a region of tissue known to contain the protein of interest was used as a positive control and tissues incubated in secondary antibodies without primary antibodies present were used as negative controls in the staining protocols. All double-label experiments were done in parallel for incubation of primary antibodies, followed by sequential incubation of secondary antibodies. Anti-mouse AffinPure Fab fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used to minimize non-specific labelling of mouse primary antibodies used in mouse tissue.\nConfocal images were acquired using a Leica SP8 inverted microscope using the LASX unmixing software to obtain z-stack datasets. Three to four sections per mouse were used for immunofluorescence staining. Immunoreactive cells were analyzed within the peri-infarct region utilizing ImageJ software. Cell counting was performed for immunoreactive cells within the peri-infarct region. The \u2018Sum projection\u2019 feature in ImageJ was used to obtain a composite image of multiple z-stacks. Fluorescence intensity was calculated for a region of interest (ROI) within the peri-infarct region. A threshold was determined across all images for each antibody used. The total fluorescence intensity of immunoreactive cells within the ROI was calculated using the \u201cMeasure\u201d feature of ImageJ. All colocalization analyses were performed using ImarisColoc software (Imaris 9.3), which enables processing of three-dimensional microscopy images.\n\nStatistical analyses\nPrism 6\n(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA)\nwas used to perform statistical analysis and generate graphical representations. For comparisons between two experimental groups, a two-tailed student\u2019s t-test with unequal variance was used. For comparisons between multiple experimental groups, one-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA were used followed by Holm-Sidak multiple comparisons correction. Mander\u2019s overlay coefficient was used to measure the degree of colocalization between specified outputs. Statistical significance was defined as p\u22640.05. All graphical data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM."

Anti-4-hydroxynonenal antibody was purchased from R&D Systems (MAB3249, Minneapolis, MN (\nGhosh et al., 2016\n)), while anti-BDNF was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-546, Dallas, TX). CREB and p-CREB (Ser133) antibodies were obtained from Cell signaling (9104, 87G3, Boston, MA (\nJin et al., 2011\n)). The anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 680 conjugated anti-mouse IgG and IRdye 800 conjugated anti-rabbit IgG) were purchased from Invitrogen and Rockland Inc., respectively.\n\nExperimental design\nThe experimenter was blinded to mouse genotype for each behavioral test by flipping cage cards and randomizing mouse order prior to beginning the experiment. A third party was used to conceal treatment and vehicle solution identity prior to drug administration. Genotype and administration blinding was decoded after data acquisition was complete. Power analysis using the \u201cfpower\u201d function in SAS was used to determine the following animal requirements based on 80% power, alpha=0.05, and four groups. Clinically significant differences and standard deviations used to determine delta were taken from ANOVA analyses of previous studies in our lab. Based on preliminary forced swim test data, a minimum of 11 animals per group were used for behavioral animal studies to detect an effect size of 1.5. Male and female mice were combined, for a total of 19 MitoParks and 25 Littermate control mice used for all behavioral experiments. Mice unable to swim to a visible platform were to be excluded from Morris water maze (MWM) on day one, however, no such mice were observed in our study.\n\nAnimal treatment\nMitoPark mice were originally kindly provided and generated by Dr. Nils-Goran Larson at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm (\nEkstrand et al., 2007\n).

Quantification of (C) horizontal and (D) vertical activities as determined by VersaMax analyzer during 10-min open-field test. E, Average time (in seconds) spent on RotaRod at 20 rpm during 5 trials. F, Grip strength and (G) body weights from 8- to 24-wk-old littermate control and MitoPark mice. *, p\u22640.05; ***, p<0.001. n=15 LC males, n=10 LC females, n=11 MP males, and n=8 MP females.\n\nMotor function test\nFor the open-field test, a VersaMax system (VersaMax monitor, model RXYZCM-16, and analyzer, model VMAUSB, AccuScan, Columbus, OH) was used for monitoring locomotor activity. For horizontal and vertical activity and corresponding plots, mice were acclimated for 2 min prior to recording for 10 min using the VersaMax system. RotaRod equipment (AccuScan) was used to test movement coordination as previously described (\nGhosh et al., 2012\n). Briefly, time spent on rod rotating at 20 rpm was measured for a maximum of either 20 min or five trials, each of which ended with a mouse falling from the rod.\n\nNeuromuscular function and muscular strength\nEach mouse was lifted over the grip strength meter (GSM)\u2019s baseplate by the tail so that its forepaws could grasp onto the steel grip. Each mouse was then gently pulled backward by the tail until its grip released. The GSM measures the maximal force before the mouse releases the bar (\nDanilov and Steward, 2015\n). Three trials were performed for each mouse with a 1-minute resting period between trials. Latency to release (sec) and gram-force (gF) were recorded.\n\nSocial discrimination and novel scent tests\nTo determine the olfactory function of control and MitoPark mice, we used a social discrimination test as previously described (\nNgwa et al., 2014\n). However, this procedure was adapted to use ANY-maze tracking software (AMS, Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL ) to determine time spent sniffing based on the animal\u2019s head being within a defined zone (1-cm perimeter around dish) surrounding the bedding. Total time spent sniffing the opposite sex\u2019s bedding (from a group-housed cage) was recorded during a 3-min trial. Similarly, AMS was used to determine time sniffing a novel scent as described by Taylor\net al.\n(\nTaylor et al., 2009\n). During a 3-min trial, time spent sniffing scented and non-scented zones was recorded using AMS. Scents used were lemon, peppermint and vanilla, whereas water served as the non-scent.\n\nCognitive testing\nA six-day MWM protocol was used as described previously in an Alzheimer\u2019s disease mouse model (\nBromley-Brits et al., 2011\n). Briefly, each mouse gets five 1-min trials per day. On the first day, the platform is visible and its position changes between trials to show that the ability to see and swim to the platform is not impaired by visual or motor deficits. On days 2\u20135, mice are placed into the MWM tank filled with white (Tempera paint), opaque water to learn to find a hidden platform whose position does not change between trials. The time required for a mouse to find and mount the platform is reported here as escape latency. Finally, the platform is removed on the sixth day when mice performed a single 1-min probe trial to show memory retention of the previously located platform, reported here as time spent searching in the quadrant that contained the platform during Days 2\u20135. Each trial was monitored using AMS. Each inter-trial interval was a minimum of 20 min, during which time mice were warmed and dried on heating pads placed under cages. Water temperature in the MWM tank was maintained at 23\u00b11\u00b0C.\n\nForced swim and tail suspension tests\nFor depressive-like phenotyping, tail suspension and forced swim tests were used to measure behavioral despair or stress-coping response during inescapable tasks (\nCommons et al., 2017\n). During tail suspension trials, mice were individually suspended at a height of 30 cm by attaching the tail to a horizontal ring stand bar using adhesive tape. Each 6-min test session was videotaped and scored using AMS for escape-oriented behavior/mobility and bouts of immobility. The time spent immobile was recorded for each mouse as a correlate of depression-like behavior (\nCan et al., 2012b\n;\nTaylor et al., 2010\n).\nFor the Porsolt \u201cforced swim\u201d test, mice were placed individually in a glass cylinder (24 \u00d7 16 cm) with 15 cm of water maintained at 25\u00b0C as previously described (\nCan et al., 2012a\n;\nPorsolt et al., 1979\n). Mice were left in the cylinder and their behavior was videotaped from the side of the cylinder for 6 min. After the first 2 min, the total duration of time spent immobile was recorded during a 4-min test. A mouse was deemed immobile when it was floating 65% passively for at least 2.5 sec according to AMS. A separate cohort of mice underwent the forced swim test with intraperitoneal administration of the antidepressant desipramine or saline 30 min prior to testing (n=7). These mice were immediately sacrificed for dissection and Western blotting, so were not subjected to any additional behavioral testing.\n\nElevated plus maze\nTime spent in the open arms is inversely correlated with an anxious phenotype (\nLister, 1987\n), which in rodents emerges as the trade-off between risk avoidance and spontaneous exploration of novel environments (\nCrawley, 2008\n). Mice were placed into the center of the elevated plus maze (Stoelting) and video-recorded for 10 min as previously described (\nKomada et al., 2008\n). Time spent in open arms was determined by AMS.\n\nSleep latency test\nAnimals were allowed to acclimate 4 h in the VersaMax monitor, and were then video-recorded from above after being awakened by gentle handling. Latency to sleep was determined by observer video-monitoring behavioral signs of sleep. Sleep was defined as 2 min of uninterrupted sleep behavior and 75% of the next ten minutes spent in sleep behavior as previously described (\nTaylor et al., 2009\n).\n\nHigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)\nStriatum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb samples were prepared and processed for HPLC as described previously (\nGordon et al., 2016\n). Briefly, dissected brain regions were placed in a buffer comprising 0.2 M perchloric acid, 0.05% Na\n2\nEDTA, 0.1% Na\n2\nS\n2\nO\n5\nand isoproterenol (internal standard) to extract monoamine neurotransmitters. Monoamine lysates were placed in a refrigerated automatic sampler (model WPS-3000TSL) until being separated isocratically by a reversed-phase C18 column with a flow rate of 0.6 mL/ min using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (pump ISO-3100SD, Thermo Scientific, Bannockburn, IL). Electrochemical detection was achieved using a CoulArray model 5600A coupled with a guard cell (model 5020) and an analytical cell (microdialysis cell 5014B) with cell potentials set at \u2212350, 0, 150, and 220 mV. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Chromeleon 7 and ESA CoulArray 3.10 HPLC Software and quantified data were normalized to wet tissue weight.\n\nBrdU treatment paradigm\nLittermate control and MitoPark mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 mg/kg BrdU daily for 3 days and sacrificed 12 h past the last injection as previously described (\nFu et al., 2016\n). For each age, 6\u20138 mice were used per genotype. Mouse brains were perfused with PFA, and then cryoprotected in sucrose before being cryo-embedded in OCT and cryosectioned at 30 \u03bcm. Sections were treated with HCl to denature DNA prior to IHC to allow binding of BrdU antibody. DAB immunostaining was performed for BrdU and hematoxylin was used to counterstain the nuclei. Prior to antigen retrieval in citrate buffer, DNA was denatured by keeping sections in 1N of ice-cold HCl for 10 min, 2N HCl at 37\u00b0C, followed by 2 washes (15 min) in borate buffer at pH 8.5. Color deconvolution and cell counting were performed in Image J Software.\n\nWestern blot\nProtein lysates from the striatum and SN were prepared in RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors and ran on a 12\u201315% SDS-PAGE as previously described (\nJin et al., 2014\n) before being transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking for 1 h, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at 4\u00baC overnight. Next, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 680 and Rockland IR800) at RT for 1 h, and images were captured via a LI-COR Odyssey imager. Densitometric analysis was done using ImageJ software.\n\nStatistical analysis\nBehavioral tests were analyzed by 3-way ANOVA to determine any significant effect of sex or an interaction between sex and genotype. For behavioral tests where sex was not a significant source of variation, data were combined and analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests in GraphPad Prism software. Data in which sex and/or the interaction between genotype and sex was a significant source of variation were separated by sex, graphed, and analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests. Similarly, biochemical and neurochemical analyses were performed by 2-way ANOVA to check for the effect of sex before combining and analyzing by two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test. No data sets analyzed for this study violated the normality assumption, so nonparametric tests were not used. For ANOVA and t-tests, p\u22640.05 was used to determine significance. Plotted data represent mean \u00b1 SEM.\n\nData Availability\nRaw data supporting the results reported in this article are in the figure source data files available upon request."

    "Methods": "2.1. Study Design\nA 2\u00d72 study design was employed to assess the interaction between age (aged vs. young) and traumatic brain injury (TBI vs. sham injury). A power analysis was used to determine the minimum number of mice per experimental group necessary to detect a statistical difference (utilizing the conventional values of 0.05 and 0.2 for \u03b1 and \u03b2, respectively). The resultant animal numbers per experimental group are detailed in each subsection below. Experimental groups were randomly assigned, and all experiments were performed in duplicate. Investigators blinded to experimental groups performed the data analysis.\n\n2.2. Mice\nMale C57BL/6 mice were used in all experiments. All mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed within a barrier facility at the Northwestern University Center for Comparative Medicine, Chicago IL. Young mice underwent TBI vs. sham injury at 14 weeks of age (n =22) and aged mice underwent TBI vs. sham injury at 78\u201380 weeks of age (n=26). Animals were housed in cages based on group with an average of 3 animals per cage. All procedures were approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and are reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines on\nin vivo\nexperimentation.\n\n2.3. Controlled Cortical Impact\nTBI or sham injury was induced via a controlled cortical impact (CCI) as previously described by our laboratory. In brief, all mice were size and weight matched prior to injury to ensure equivalent degrees of injury between groups. All mice were anesthetized with 50mg/kg Ketamine (Ketaset, Fort Dodge, IA) and 2.5mg/kg Xylazine (Anased, Shenandoah IA) via intraperitoneal injection. All mice underwent a 1cm longitudinal scalp incision placed in the midline of the scalp exposing the sagittal and coronal sutures of the skull. TBI mice underwent a 5mm craniectomy located 2mm left of the sagittal suture and 2mm rostral to the coronal suture. The dura mater was left intact. The mice were then secured in a stereotaxic operating frame and a commercially available impactor (Leica Biosystems, IL) was rotated into the field. TBI was administered with a 3mm impacting rod at 2.5 m/s to a depth of 2mm and a 0.1s dwell time. Sham-injured mice underwent all the same procedures except for craniectomy and CCI. Scalp incisions were sealed with VetBond 3M (Santa Cruz Animal Health, Dallas, TX). All mice received 0.1mg/kg buprenorphine SR for post-operative analgesia (SR Veterinary Technologies, Windsor, CO). Mice were allowed to recover in their home cages over a warming pad and observed until they regained their righting reflex. There were 3 immediate mortalities related following CCI, all within the aged TBI group. Tissues from these mice were excluded from study. Mice were euthanized at experimental endpoints via carbon dioxide inhalation and cervical dislocation per AVMA guidelines(\nMakinde et al., 2017b\n;\nMakinde HM, 2018\n;\nSchwulst and Islam, 2019\n;\nTrahanas et al., 2015\n).\n\n2.4. Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry\nAnimals (n=5/per group) were euthanized and perfused with 4 \u00b0C 1x Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were excised and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After fixation the brains were paraffin-embedded and 4\u03bcm brain sections were cut. Sections were processed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and neuronal nuclei (NeuN) at the Northwestern University Mouse Histology and Phenotyping Laboratory. Slides were imaged using an Olympus BX41 microscope equipped with an Olympus DP21 camera and photographed at 1.25x and 5x magnification. To quantify cerebral edema we assessed the percentage of vessels showing perivascular vacuolation/enlargement. 5 random 10x microscopic fields per slide were assessed and given scores according to edema level (0, none, 1, mild \u2013 30 % or less, 2, moderate, -- 60 % or less, 3, severe -- more than 60%. (\nSobel, 2015\n). Sections were scored for neuronal degeneration and results are reported as the mean objects per unit area (mm\n2\n). All samples were analyzed by a neuropathologist blinded to the experimental groups and scored from 0\u20133, with 0 representing no neurodegeneration and 3 representing \u201csevere\u201d neurodegeneration as previously published by our group (\nMao et al., 2017\n;\nMao et al., 2019\n).\n\n2.5. MRI Acquisition and Image Processing Methods\nAt 30 days post-TBI or sham injury mice (n=3\u20134/per group) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. Mice were scanned in a 7T Clinscan MRI (Bruker, Billerica, MA) at the Northwestern University Center for Translational Imaging. Each mouse was anesthetized using isoflurane with 100% O\n2\nand secured within a stereotaxic frame within the dedicated animal holder. During the procedure the animals received continuous anesthesia delivered via a nose cone. Their body temperature and respiration were monitored during the procedure using a physiological monitoring system (SAI, New Jersey, USA). A four-channel mouse brain surface coil was positioned over the mouse head and brain images were acquired, MR images processed, and region of interest selected as we previously published (\nMakinde HM, 2018\n). A 3D multi gradient echo sequence (mGRE) with the following parameters was used to obtain high isotropic resolution of each mouse brain (150 micrometers in each direction) as well as 3D R2* maps with the following MR timing and acquisition parameters: TR=80msec, and 12 echoes with TE=2.5, 6.3, 10.1, 13.9, 17.7, 21.5, 25.3, 29, 32, 36.7, 40.4, and 44.2 milliseconds) and FA=20. A 2D T1 map was generated using a gradient echo sequencing (GRE) sequence with multiple flip angles (5, 10, 15, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 90). Finally a 2D echo planar sequence with 3 orthogonal directions and multiple -values was used to obtain diffusion weighted images and to generate modified fractional anisotropy (FA) patterns as described in(\nMakinde HM, 2018\n). Contrast agent (\nAgliozzo et al., 2012\n) and a 3D scan was repeated using the same 3D sequence as described with the aim of enhancing possible lesions associated with blood-brain-barrier disruption. Analysis of morphological data and extraction of quantitative parameters was accomplished using several different software packages: ImageJ (Xinapse) for generating quantitative maps and ITK-SNAP for threshold-based segmentation.\nAfter generating FA Index maps for each subject, analysis and extraction of FA Index values was done using a threshold approach. Brain FA maps were loaded in ITK-SNAP and segmentation of high FA regions was obtained using IT-SNAP\u2019s semi-automated 3D segmentation approach based on a threshold value (i.e. only brain regions with highest FA values were included in the final segmentation volume). The volume of the segmented high FA regions were then divided by the total brain volume (for each subject) and recorded as an index % value (FA Index). Higher FA index values correspond to subjects with more defined FA patterns while subjects with lower FA index are reflective of white matter loss.\n\n2.6. Behavioral Phenotyping\nAll mice (n=9\u201313/group) underwent behavioral phenotyping starting at 30 days post-injury in the Northwestern University Behavioral Phenotyping Core. Studies took place over the course of 3 months and were conducted during the light phase cycle.\n\n2.7. Elevated Zero Maze\nThe elevated zero maze (ZM) began 31 days post injury (DPI) and was used to evaluate the anxiety response of mice (\nCrawley, 2009\n). The maze is grey and has a 45cm inner diameter with a 6cm wide track and is elevated 30cm from the floor (Phenome Technologies Skokie, IL). The ZM has 2 open quadrants and 2 closed quadrants with 13.3cm tall acrylic walls. The mice were placed inside the center of the closed quadrant and were exposed to white/yellow light. The animals were recorded for 10 minutes using Limelight 4 software (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL) to track their movements. The maze was cleaned between trials using 70% ethanol.\n\n2.8. Morris Water Maze\nMorris water maze (MWM), conducted 32 DPI, was used to evaluate spatial learning and memory (\nOh et al., 2003\n). In this test, mice were trained to find a hidden platform in a 5ft diameter pool of opaque water (~25 degrees C, 152cm diameter pool). The mice underwent 4 days of training with a visible platform(\nWatase et al., 2002\n). Each day of training consisted of 8 trials in which the platform was placed in a different quadrant for each trial. Each trial lasted a maximum of 60s and animals were allowed to stay on the platform for 15s before being dried and returned to their home cage. 48 hours after last day of training the animals underwent 5 days of testing using a hidden platform. Each day had 6 trials. The time spent to reach the platform and the distance swam to reach the platform were recorded. Additionally, a probe test was administered without a platform at the end of days 3\u20135 of testing. During this probe trial the animals were placed into the center of the maze and allowed 60s to swim freely about the maze with learning indicated by close proximity to where the escape platform had been located. All trials were recorded using the Actimetrics WaterMaze software (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL).\n\n2.9. Open Field\nOpen field (OF) testing, conducted 67 DPI, was used to measure anxiety, exploratory behavior, and locomotive activity (\nCrawley, 2009\n;\nTodd D. Gould, 2009\n). Mice were placed in the center of an enclosed 54.5 \u00d7 54.5 cm square box with 30cm tall walls and exposed to white/yellow light. Each trial lasted 5 minutes and movement was recorded and tracked using LimeLight 4 software (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL). The box was cleaned with 70% ethanol in between trials to minimize olfactory cues. Behavior was recorded with LimeLight 4 software.\n\n2.10. Fear Conditioning\nThe last assay performed was contextual and cued fear conditioning at 93 DPI(\nShors et al., 1992\n;\nWeiss et al., 2020\n). The mice were trained in a 29.5 \u00d7 25 cm x 29.5cm chamber equipped with rods that were sized and spaced for use with mice (Coulbourn Instruments, Holliston, MA). During the training the animals received 3 tone-shock stimuli over the span of 15 minutes. 24 hours post-training the animals were placed back into the training chamber and the contextual fear in the form of freezing behavior was assessed for 6 minutes. ~4 hours after contextual fear was assessed, cued fear was sassed by placing the animals into a novel 34 \u00d7 28 \u00d7 18.5 cm chamber for 8 minutes. 180s into the test the tone from training was played for 60s. Data were recorded using FreezeFrame software (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL).\n\n2.11. Statistical Methods\nStatistical analyses were performed using the statistical software package Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). One-way ANOVA with Holm-\u0160\u00edd\u00e1k\u2019s multiple comparison test was used to assess interaction across groups while two-way ANOVA with a Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test was used to analyze the interaction between age and TBI. Data are reported as mean \u00b1 SEM, unless otherwise stated. Data points were categorized as outliers and excluded if the values were more than two standard deviations away from the mean."

    "Methods": "Experimental design\nA timeline for the experiments is shown in\nFigure 1A\n. Animals were trained to walk across the horizontal ladder. Animals were then bilaterally implanted with epidural electrodes over the M1 forelimb representation for chronic daily stimulation. Rats received a C4 moderate contusion (200 kdyn). After 2 weeks of recovery, animals were randomly assigned to a group that received 10 days of dual M1 and tsDCS electrical stimulation, followed by 6 weeks of rehab on the horizontal ladder. The second group received no stimulation for 10 days followed by 6 weeks of rehab. Forelimb motor performance was assayed on the horizontal ladder task once a week during rehab and for 2 additional weeks to determine persistence of effects. CST and PA axons were traced for histological analysis.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nExperimental protocol and injury verification. A) Schematic illustrating project timeline. B) Electrical stimulation protocol; 10 days of dual M1 iTBS + cathodal transcutaneous tsDCS. C&D) H&E staining of lesion at C4. Groups did not differ in lesion size (p>0.05). C is representative section from a rehab-only animal, D is representative section from a stim+rehab animal.\n\nAnimals\nA total of 19 female Sprague-Dawley rats (225\u2013250g) were used for this study; 15 were used for the final analysis. Of the 4 animals that were excluded, 3 did not show clear spinal bruising after the contusion nor did they exhibit overt forelimb impairment, and 1 animal had cortical electrode malfunction after 3 days of stimulation. All surgeries were performed under aseptic conditions and general anesthesia using oxygen (0.8mL) and isoflurane, 5% for induction and 2.5% for maintenance throughout surgery. All experiments were approved by the City University of New York Advanced Science Research Center Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n\nC4 Contusion\nA longitudinal incision was made from the base of the skull to T2. Overlying tissue was bluntly dissected to expose the vertebrae and a laminectomy was performed at C4. Clamp forceps, attached to the arms of the Infinite Horizon (IH) Spinal Impactor, were fixed into the transverse foramens of C3 and C5 in order to stabilize the spine and prevent spinal compression during the impact. The impact probe (3.5mm diameter tip) was lowered to touch the surface of C4 dura while ensuring a clear path without contacting adjacent bony structures. The probe was raised 3.9mm and impact was set at 200 kdyns with 0 dwell time, which typically results in clear bilateral bruising of the spinal cord (\nAnderson et al., 2009\n;\nZareen et al., 2017\n) . After the contusion, we typically observed a midline petechial hemorrhage at the impact site and bruises on each side of the impact. After the impact, overlaying neck muscles and skin were sutured in layers. Rats were given subcutaneous injections of buprenorphine (0.03mg/kg), cephazolin (10mg/kg) and lactated ringer\u2019s solution (5mL) and placed over a heating pad until awoken and conscious. Buprenorphine was administered for 2 more days post-surgery while Ringer\u2019s solution and a high calorie food supplement (STAT; 10mL/day) were given for 7 days post-surgery or until animal was able to self-feed. All animals start to weight bear using their front limbs and self-feed by 7\u20138 days after SCI.\n\nBilateral M1 Electrode Implantation\nThe procedure for M1 electrode implantation was similar to our previously published study (\nZareen et al., 2017\n). Electrode implantation was performed before obtaining baseline error rate. Animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame and an incision along the head was made to expose the skull. Overlaying connective tissue was removed and square craniotomy, approximately 0.5cm x 0.5cm in size, was made over the right and left forelimb areas of M1 using a dental drill with a 0.9mm diameter stainless steel burr (Fine Science Tools). Three-channel stainless steel epidural electrodes (length: 8mm long, diameter 0.005\u201d) (PlasticsOne, Inc), bent to form an L-shape to increase contact area over the distal forelimb region of M1 were bilaterally placed on the dura overlying each M1 forelimb representation, at coordinates AP: 1.5\u20132.0 and ML: 3.0\u20133.5, with respect to the bregma. Dental acrylic cement was applied over the skull and the electrodes. The acrylic cement covering the craniotomies and electrodes was fixed in place by 4 stainless steel screws (3.2 mm; Plastics1, Inc); 2 inserted on both sides of the lambda, and 2 over the frontal sinus bone.\n\nM1 iTBS + Cathodal tsDCS\nWe used the same iTBS+tsDCS protocol as in our previous experiments (\nYang et al., 2019\n;\nZareen et al., 2017\n) (\nFigure 1B\n). As animals moved freely in their cage, implanted M1 electrodes delivered phasic iTBS at 75% of motor threshold. Motor threshold was determined daily using multi-pulse stimulation (0.2ms biphasic pulse, 333 Hz, 45 ms duration) while the animal was held gently and its forelimbs were free to move in response to stimulation (\nCarmel et al., 2014\n;\nCarmel and Martin, 2014\n). The current was increased from 0 mA to the current that evoked a contra movement. We typically repeated this but from slightly above threshold and reducing the current to a current that no longer produced a movement. The iTBS pattern consisted of a burst of 3 pulses with an interstimulus interval of 50ms, repeated 10 times for 2 seconds, followed by 8 seconds of no stimulation. This was repeated 20 times for a total of 600 pulses which was referred to as a \u201cblock.\u201d The stimulation protocol included 5 blocks of iTBS over a period of 27 minutes, with 2 minutes of no stimulation between each block, for a total of 3000 pulses each day. This specific protocol was modelled after human transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies, showing its efficacy in enabling long term potentiation (\nHuang et al., 2005\n;\nSong et al., 2016\n). Since iTBS threshold was set at 75%, there were no noticeable movements elicited by the stimulation during the treatment period.\nConcomitant with iTBS was 27 minutes of continuous cathodal tsDCS. tsDCS was delivered through 2 percutaneous hydrogel electrodes (PALS; North Coast Medical), the cathode (1.4cm x 4cm) was placed dorsally extending over C4-T2 and the anode (2cm x 2 cm) over the chest. The dorsal surface of the neck and the chest were shaved and depilated (Nair) on day 1 and day 5 of stimulation. This placement was in accordance with results from Finite Element Modelling, which predicted the area of the spinal cord that receives maximal current flow within the cervical enlargement (\nSong et al., 2015\n;\nZareen et al., 2017\n). Electric current was delivered using a programmable waveform generator (A-M Systems, model 3800) and stimulus isolation units (A-M Systems, model 3820). Rats wore a custom-made Velcro jacket to hold the electrodes in place on the skin surface as they were freely moving in their cage. tsDCS intensity was ramped up from 0 to 1.5mA (3 \u00d7 10\n\u22123\nmA/mm\n2\n) over a 2.5 second period, and after 27 mins of stimulation was ramped back to 0 over 2.5 seconds. Electrodes were covered with conductive gel before each use to enhance current flow and reduce skin irritation during the treatment. No rats showed signs of discomfort or skin damage during or following the stimulation.\n\nHorizontal Ladder Training\nPrior to training, animals were handled for 2 days to acclimate them to contact with the experimenters. Over the course of 2 weeks prior to injury, rats were trained to walk across a 2-foot horizontal ladder from one end to the other and jump in their home cage, which was placed at the end of the ladder. Animals were given sugar water at the end of each run for motivation. In order for rats to get accustomed to the task, they were first trained to walk across the ladder without gaps between the rungs, followed by removal of every other rung and finally alternating between single and double spaces between the rungs. Each training day consisted of 24 runs across the ladder and the order of the rungs was changed every 12 runs to prevent rats from memorizing limb placement. After 2 weeks of training, a baseline score for forelimb error rate was obtained by videotaping forelimb placement on the rungs for each of the 24 runs (Sony Handycam FDR-AX33 Digital Camcorder). By watching the videos in slow motion, we were able to discern if the paw grasped the rung (correct), was too far forward with the wrists placed over the rung, opposed to grasped (overstep), too far behind the rung with only the digits placed over the rungs (under step), or a missed step (rat\u2019s limb falls into the space between the rungs). The number of oversteps, under steps and misses were added and divided by the total number of steps for each limb to obtain a total percent error rate. Animals were trained until forelimb error rate was equal to or less than 15% (\nMetz and Whishaw, 2002\n;\nYang et al., 2019\n;\nZareen et al., 2017\n).\n\nRehabilitation\nRehab on the horizontal ladder started after completion of 10 days of iTBS + tsDCS or 10 days of no stimulation so that both groups began rehab at the same time post-injury. Rehab consisted of 24 runs on the ladder, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. As with training, during rehab the ladder rungs were spaced irregularly and the pattern was changed every 12 runs. In this way the rehab was to perform the complex motor task; it was not simply exercise. Compared to pre-injury, animals after SCI were much slower, poorly coordinated, and less motivated to walk across the ladder. Rats were encouraged to cross the ladder (nudged from behind or tapped on their tail) and, after each run, were given sugar water. Forelimb performance was videotaped and analyzed for errors once at the end of each week except for week 1 of rehab, where we also filmed on day 1 of rehab to obtain a Pre-rehab score. Pre-rehab was not recorded on a separate day to prevent the rats from receiving an extra day of training. Error rates were calculated at the end of each week as described above.\n\nCST anterograde tracing\nAfter all behavioral tests were conducted, descending CST axons were traced anterogradely. Animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame, the screws holding the head cap in place were loosened, gently removing the entire head cap along with the cortical electrodes, thereby exposing the skull. The bilateral craniotomies were cleared of reactive tissue. We confirmed at this time that the electrodes appeared not to have caused any dural damage. To trace the CST bilaterally, seven biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) injections were made in each hemisphere (300nL/injection; BDA: 10,000MW; Molecular Probes; 10% in 0.1 M PBS) at the listed coordinates (AP: 0.5mm ML: 2.0mm; AP: 0.5mm ML:2.8mm; AP:0.5mm ML:3.9mm; AP:1.5 ML:3.5; AP:1.5 ML:2.5; AP:2.02 ML:2.5 and AP:2.02 ML:3.5); each at a depth of 1.5mm and an injection rate of 2nL/sec. BDA injections were made by piercing the dura with the beveled 35 ga. injection needle. BDA was injected slowly over a period of 3 mins and the needle remained in the cortex for an additional 2 mins before withdrawal to ensure no leakage. Animals were allowed to survive for two weeks after tracer injection.\n\nPA anterograde tracing and retrograde motoneuron tracing\nSeven days before perfusion cholera toxin B-fragment (CTB; 1%, 10\u03bcl; List Biologicals) was bilaterally injected into the extensor carpi radialis muscle, using a Hamilton syringe, to anterogradely label PA axons in the spinal gray matter as well as retrogradely label motoneurons in the ventral horn. CTB was tinted with Evan\u2019s Blue Dye to visualize it inside the muscle, intramuscular CTB injections were made slowly (10 secs) and the needle was slowly withdrawn from the muscle to minimize leakage. Every effort was made to ensure that the injection on each side were the same. This was verified by counting the number of retrogradely-labeled motoneurons.\n\nTissue Preparation and staining\nAnimals were euthanized with Euthasol (1mL IP) and transcardially perfused with saline (300mL) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (500mL) by opening the thoracic cavity and cannulating the left ventricular apex. The spinal cord was dissected from the vertebrae and removed from the dura, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in room temperature for 3 hours, then transferred in 20% sucrose for 48 hours in 4\u00b0 temperature. Tissue was transversely cut at 40\u03bcm with a sliding microtome (frozen sections). C2 spinal segments were used to visualize BDA-traced CST axons rostral to the lesion and to count axons to calibrate tracer efficacy, and C6\u20137 was used for analysis caudal to the lesion. To visualize BDA staining, free-floating sections were incubated in phosphate-buffered (pH 7.4) saline containing 1% avidin-biotin complex reagent (ABC Kit; Vector Laboratories), followed either by the chromogen diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma) for rostral sections or streptavidin conjugated to Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for caudal sections.Staining for CTB was performed with primary antibody goat anti-CTB (1:1000; List Biologicals) and secondary donkey anti-goat conjugated to FITC. Vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGlut1) was localized using a primary anti-VGlut1 antibody (1:10; NeuroMab) and a secondary donkey anti-mouse conjugated to Cy5.\n\nCavity Size Analysis\nThe bilateral cervical contusion produces a central cavity that damages most of the dorsal columns, including all of the dorsal CST, but spares dorsolateral and ventral CST projections (\nTuszynski and Steward, 2012\n), as shown in the representative section (\nFigure 1C\n). This type of injury is inherently more variable compared to complete and partial spinal transections (\nAnderson et al., 2009\n). The size and location of the injury affects the amount and type of spared axons, respectively, and can therefore be a source of variability in functional recovery and response to treatment (\nHurd et al., 2013\n). To measure cavity size, the postmortem C4 contused area was serially cut into transverse sections (40 \u03bcm) using a sliding microtome, directly mounted on glass slides and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). The 5 serial sections in the epicenter of the lesion, which also had the largest cavity, were analyzed by trained laboratory personnel, blinded to animal treatment group, using an unbiased stereological technique (Cavalieri Probe; Stereo Investigator; MBF Bioscience, Williston, Vermont, USA). The lesioned tissue sections were viewed under 10x magnification using the program\u2019s live imaging mode. The software creates a grid that overlays the entire tissue (50 \u03bcm between each grid point). All grid points inside the lesion cavity were marked. Lesion cavity size is then calculated from the total number of marked grid points and the distance between each in a 3-dimensional orientation. The calculated mean area of each cavity was corrected for the respective section\u2019s surface area.\n\nCST anatomical data acquisition analysis\nAnalyses were performed by trained laboratory personnel blinded to animal treatment group. Sections caudal to the injury were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 880 meta confocal microscopy at 20x magnification. A montage of images was collected to visualize all labeled axons. A Z-stack was captured with a 4\u00d75 tile at 20x magnification to visualize spared CST fibers in the entire gray matter. We manually traced the full length of all labeled axons in the gray matter using the program Neurolucida (MBF Bioscience, Williston, Vermont USA). It was important to examine CST axonal length bilaterally in the gray matter because both the injury and rehabilitation (stepping on the horizontal ladder) were bilateral. CST axon labelling can be influenced by tracer efficacy, such as injection size and uptake and transport of BDA by cortical neurons. To ensure that potential differences in caudal CST length were not due to variability in tracing efficacy, caudal CST axonal length was normalized to the total number of BDA-labelled CST axons in the dorsal columns rostral to the injury. To quantify rostral CST fibers, as described in our previous studies (\nCarmel et al., 2010\n;\nSong et al., 2016\n;\nZareen et al., 2017\n), we used an unbiased stereological technique (Optical Dissector; Stereo Investigator; MBF Bioscience, Williston, Vermont USA) under 40x magnification to count BDA-labelled CST fibers in 75 \u00d7 75 \u03bcm bins.\n\nPA, motoneuron and VGlut1 anatomical data acquisition and analyses\nImages of the gray matter of the caudal cervical enlargement were captured using confocal microscopy under 10x magnification for bilateral PA analysis. Since this was an optical density assay, the same microscope laser settings were used for all sections. Micrographs were analyzed using ImageJ software (JAVA 1.8.0_112; NIH) and the background was thresholded to eliminate non-specific labelling to accurately measure intra-axonal CTB. In order to make sure that the same areas of each section were analyzed, we divided the dorsoventral extent of the gray matter into 3 equal quadrants corresponding to the dorsal horn, intermediate zone and ventral horn. The dorsal horn and intermediate zone were assayed for PA labelling. For each section, the total amount of bilateral PA density was summed and normalized for the number of motor neurons in the ventral horn. Because it is not possible to distinguish between transganglionic (anterograde afferent) CTB labeling and motoneuron (retrograde) recurrent axon labeling, we used VGlut1 to visualize PA terminal synapses contacting ECR motoneurons. Large-diameter PA fibers use the glutamate vesicular transporter VGlut1 (\nAlvarez et al., 2004\n) that can be used as a marker for the monosynaptic 1A afferent terminals on MNs. The only other source of VGlut1 in the spinal cord is in the CST terminals. However, there are no CST terminals in the motor pools (\nJiang et al., 2016\n). Moreover, 1a afferent terminals, where present, are 6-times larger than CST terminals (4.0 \u03bcm versus 0.67 \u03bcm) . Individual CTB-labelled ECR motoneurons, and surrounding VGlut1, were captured under 63x magnification using high-resolution confocal microscopy. Images (z-stacks; 1 \u03bcm optical sections) were transferred to Neurolucida and motoneurons were reconstructed by drawing contours around the soma and proximal dendrites and counting the number of VGlut1 boutons contacting motoneurons in each section. The tracing data files were transferred to Neurolucida Explorer to obtain the sum of VGlut1 and the mean area of the corresponding motoneuron, which was used as a normalization factor.\n\nHeat Map Analysis of CST axons and PA labeling caudal to C4 contusion\nTo determine the location of CST and PA labeling in each animal group, we constructed average topographic color-coded heat maps for gray matter CST axon length and PA axon density caudal to the injury, similar to our prior studies (e.g.,\nBrus-Ramer et al., 2007\n). Axon labeling data were exported as individual sections and combined into a single layered file (Adobe Photoshop 2020). Each section was aligned with one another according to fiduciary marks. The aligned layers were then exported as individual TIFF files for each section and average heat maps were constructed, as in our prior studies, using custom programs written in Matlab (MathWorks). For PA afferent gray matter terminations, thresholded PA density images from ImageJ were exported and processed as for the CST axons. For further quantification of CST axons, individual section data were analyzed using custom programs written in Matlab (MathWorks) to compute the dorsoventral distribution of labeling, as in prior studies (\nFriel and Martin, 2007\n;\nSalimi et al., 2008\n). We determined the amount of labeling for both sides of the spinal cord, from the dorsal horn to the ventral horn. Since, section size varied slightly from animal-to-animal and within animals, the distribution was interpolated to obtain 100 data points and we constructed an average for all animals in each treatment group (see\nFig 4D\n,\nE\n). For individual animal analyses, we regressed the average amount of CST label within particular gray matter territories, as the ratio of regional label to total label, with the motor outcome (absolute ladder walking error rate at week 6).\nFigure 4.\nOpen in a new tab\nCST plasticity and its relation to motor performance. A&B) Color-coded heat maps of caudal CST axons. A) Average normalized CST axonal length. Stim+rehab group displays significantly longer caudal CST axons compared to rehab-alone (p<0.05). B&C) Color-coded heat maps. B. Rehab-only, C. Stim+rehab. Maps show both groups to have dense CST projections in parts of the dorsal horn and intermediate zone, with the stim+rehab group having more yellow and red hotspots, demonstrating greater local CST axonal density compared to rehab-alone. Color scales are the same for the two plots. D, E) Dorso-ventral CST axonal distribution; D: Rehab-only, E: Stim+rehab. Stim+rehab group shows more lateral and ventral CST collateralization than rehab-only. The scale for the dorsoventral plots for each group is that same. F) Combined group regression between ratio of ventral CST density to total CST density and motor function at week 6 of rehabilitation. Ventral CST density is significantly correlated with motor function at week 6 (p<0.01. * significantly different than rehab-only.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll data were examined for normality using Shapiro-Wilk Test. Parameteric statistics were used for normally distributed data while the non-parametric counterpart was used for non-normally distributed data. For behavioral data, we performed a mixed ANOVA to determine group by time interactions for the 6-week rehab period. Post-hoc Bonferroni test was performed if interaction was significant. We performed un-paired t-tests to compare motor function between groups in the weeks following rehab as well as for CST data. The PA data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney test as it was not normally distributed but performed parametric unpaired t-tests to examine density of Vglut1 on CTB-labelled motoneurons. Pearson\u2019s and Spearman correlations were used to determine relationships between anatomy and relative changes in error rate. Data are presented as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean, all statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Software (IBM) and statistical significance was set at p<0.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Experimental design\nThe design of each experiment is provided in detail in the\nmethod\nsections, including the between-subjects factors and a full description of critical variables required for independent replication. All experiments were approved by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (\nCouncil, 2011\n).\n\n2.2. Treatments\nCultured microglia were incubated with HIV-1 Tat\n1\u201386\n(100 nM; IIIB, #1002, ImmunoDx, MA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 \u03bcg/mL; L2880, Sigma-Aldrich, MO), PF3845 (100 nM, Dr. Benjamin Cravatt; Scripps, CA), the endogenous GPR18 agonist NAGly (100 nM \u2013 10 \u03bcM, Tocris, UK), the CB\n2\nR agonist HU-308 (100 nM; #90086, Cayman, MI), the CB\n1\nR antagonist SR141716A (SR141, 100 nM, Tocris, UK), the CB\n2\nR antagonist SR144528 (SR144, 100 nM, Tocris, UK), the selective GPR18 antagonist CID-85469571 (CID, 100 nM, AOB9837, Aobious, MA), the selective GPR55 antagonist ML193 (100\u20131 \u03bcM, Tocris, UK), the MCP-1 inhibitor bindarit (300 \u03bcM; #11479, Cayman, MI), and/or the MMP-9 inhibitor I (150 nM; #444278, Sigma-Aldrich, MO). Tat 100 nM concentration was selected as it produces cellular deficits in vitro comparable to those found in post-mortem tissue samples collected from individuals with HAND (\nEl-Hage et al., 2008\n;\nEl-Hage et al., 2011\n;\nKruman et al., 1998\n;\nPerry et al., 2010\n). Tat concentrations in human brain tissue have not been determined yet but have been detected immunohistochemically and in protein extracts from the brains of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaques with encephalitis (\nHudson et al., 2000\n). Even though the concentrations of Tat in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) has been reported at around 1.14 nM (~16 ng/mL), higher concentrations of Tat could be attainable locally within close proximity of HIV-1 infected cells (\nWestendorp et al., 1995\n). At DIV 14 microglial cultures were incubated with PF3845 or NAGly for 1 h prior to Tat treatment. Tat was added to cultures and allowed to incubate for 24 h before media was collected. Treatment with selective inhibitors or receptor antagonists was conducted 1 h or 30 min prior to PF3845 treatment, respectively, and were present throughout the duration of Tat incubation. GPR18 antagonist CID-85469571 (CID) was selected because it has been shown to have 36-fold selectivity compared to GPR55 (\nRempel et al., 2014\n). For a positive control experiment DIV 14 microglial cultures were treated with LPS and 1 h later HU-308 was added to the cultures, similar to what has been published previously (\nPresley et al., 2015\n). After 24 h, MCM was collected for ELISA analysis to determine MCP-1/CCL2 and pro-MMP-9/MMP9 levels.\n\n2.3. Cell culture and conditioned media\nPrimary microglial cultures were derived from whole brain punches taken from C57BL/6 (Charles River, NC) neonatal mouse pups at postnatal day 0\u20131. In addition, for calcium imaging experiments, both FAAH wildtype (WT) and FAAH knockout (KO) animals were used to derive cultures. These animals were provided by Dr. Aron Lichtman (Virginia Commonwealth University, VA). Punches were suspended in DMEM (Invitrogen, CA) with fetal bovine serum, and 7.5% sodium bicarbonate, in six well ultra-low attachment plates (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) to prevent neuronal and astroglial growth. Cells were grown to confluency over 2 wks (97.5 \u00b1 17.9 cells/mm\n2\n) and used for experiments on days in vitro (DIV) 14\u201317. Media was completely changed one day after plating and partial media replacement was carried out every 3 d after initial change. All drug treatments were diluted in Brainphys culture media (Stemcell Technologies, Canada) and collected 24 h following Tat administration. Microglia conditioned medium (MCM) was collected through 0.2 \u03bcm filter before being immediately frozen. Samples were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C for no longer than 4 wks and never freeze-thawed more than twice before experimental use. Whole MCM was used for ELISA, multiplex, and mass spectrometry while 1:4 dilution was used for calcium imaging and synaptic integrity experiments.\nPrimary neuronal cultures were derived from dissociated frontal cortex tissue of embryonic day 16\u201317 C57BL/6C mice. Frontal cortex tissue was dissected from the rostral portion of the neocortex similar to the frontal cortex size that has been shown with gene expression markers (\nCholfin and Rubenstein, 2007\n). Cultures for calcium imaging were prepared as previously described (\nHermes et al., 2018\n). In brief, collected tissue was minced and incubated (30 min, 37 \u00b0C) with trypsin (2.5 mg/mL) and DNase (0.015 mg/mL) in HBSS (Invitrogen, CA) and centrifuged 2\u00d7 for 5 min. Cells were then plated on MatTek 35 mm glass bottom dishes, coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, MO), at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 10\n5\ncells per dish and maintained in neurobasal medium (NBM) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen, CA), 0.5 mM L-glutamine, 0.025 mM glutamate at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO\n2\n. Calcium imaging experiments were performed on neuronal cultures at DIV 7\u201311 ensuring that rudimentary dendritic/axonal structures were established. Neurons used for synaptic integrity experiments were collected in HBSS using papain (0.5 mg/mL, Stemcell Technologies, Canada) for dissociation with no centrifugation. Cells were plated on glass coverslips (1 \u00d7 10\n5\ncells per coverslip) and maintained in NBM Plus (Invitrogen, CA) with B27 Plus (Invitrogen, CA), 0.5 mM L-glutamine, 0.025 mM glutamate for DIV 9 and changed into NBM Plus without glutamate. Synaptic integrity experiments were carried out on DIV 21 so that fine synaptic structures were present. All cell media was supplemented with antibiotic mixture (Invitrogen, CA). Media was completely changed one day after plating and partially changed every 2\u20133 d.\n\n2.4. Calcium imaging\nLive cell imaging was conducted on frontal cortex neuronal cultures using a Zeiss Axio Observer Z.1 inverted microscope (20\u00d7 objective) with an automated, computer-controlled stage encoder with environmental control (37 \u00b0C, 95% humidity, 5% CO\n2\n). The cell permeant acetoxymethyl (AM) ester-linked [Ca\n2+\n]\ni\nindicator fura-2 AM (Kd = 145 nM; 2.5 uM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used for measuring [Ca\n2+\n]\ni\nand diluted in Brainphys culture media. MCM was added 1 min after experiment start. Neurons were imaged for a 30 min period. Using ZEN 2010 blue Edition software, images were acquired with a MRm digital camera (Zeiss, MN) at a frame rate of 0.2 Hz during the first 5 min, and 0.033 Hz from 5 min to 30 min. Relative fluorescence ratio images were acquired at 340/380 nm excitation and 510 nm emission wavelengths. Conversion to [Ca\n2+\n]\ni\nwas calculated according to an equation described previously (\nGrynkiewicz et al., 1985\n). Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually assigned to neuronal somata. Due to the heterogeneity among neurons, the mean standard error of the mean (SEM) values for changes in [Ca\n2+\n]\ni\nwere computed comparing individual neurons before and at specific intervals during treatment using a repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA). Quantitative analyses of [Ca\n2+\n]\ni\nlevels in neuronal somata were performed on 10\u201315 randomly selected neurons per treatment per experiment. At least three independent experiments were run for each treatment group.\n\n2.5. Immunocytochemistry\nDIV 21 neuronal cultures grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Dendritic structures were visualized using Acti-stain 488 phalloidin (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) to label mature and immature pre-synaptic structures. Neurons were then counter-stained with Hoechst 33342 for 3 min and mounted using ProLong Gold (Molecular Probes, OR). PBS 1\u00d7 washes were applied between each step. Cells were visualized as immunofluorescent image z-stacks acquired using a Zeiss LSM 700 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 20\u00d7 objective (Zeiss, MN). Randomly selected regions containing phalloidin-positive neuronal processes were selected and orthogonal projections were taken from each image stack. Phalloidin-positive (F-actin) staining of neuronal dendrites has been shown to generate discrete \u201chot spots\u201d or bright \u201cpuncta\u201d, which represent a variety of dendritic structures, including mature spines, non-spiny synapses and immature spines (\nLi et al., 2016\n). Thus, puncta, as the analyzed particles, were defined as objects between 0.3 and 1.2 \u03bcm, similar to what has been described previously (\nLi et al., 2016\n;\nRoscoe et al., 2014\n). Selection threshold criterion was determined by the size of punctate structures found in the randomly collected images (minimal pixel threshold: 20). Square ROIs were randomly assigned to areas containing positive fluorescent signal using ImageJ. Mean gray pixel values and number of phalloidin-positive punctate structures contained in each ROI were computed using built-in ImageJ functions. 10 images were analyzed per treatment group, with 22 ROIs randomly assigned to each. Based on the calcium imaging data only the four main treatment groups were included (MCM Control, MCM Tat 100 nM, MCM PF3845 100 nM+Tat, MCM CID 100 nM+PF3845+Tat), with excluding drug only conditions. Gray pixel values and puncta count were used as dependent factors.\n\n2.6. ELISA and multiplex quantification of cytokines/chemokines and MMP-9\nLevels of cytokines/chemokines and MMPs in MCM were quantified using the following products, CYTOMAG-70 K (cytokine panel, Millipore, MA), MMMP3MAG-79 K (proMMP-9, Millipore, MA), and Pico-Kine EK0466 (MMP-9, Boster Bio, CA). Levels of both the inactive proMMP-9 and cleaved/activated MMP-9 were quantified. Experiments were carried out as detailed in the manufacturer\u2019s instructions except all standards were run in Brainphys to match the MCM samples. For ELISAs a BioTek Synergy HT multi-mode plate reader (BioTek, VT) was used to measure absorbance and for multiplexes a Bio-Rad Bio-Plex 200 (Bio-Rad, CA) reader was used to measure mean fluorescence intensity. At least three independent experiments were run per treatment group. Concentrations of MCP-1/CCL2 and MMPs were used as dependent factors.\n\n2.7. Fractal analysis of microglial morphology\nAs microglial function is well-correlated with microglia morphology (i.e. ramified/resting compared to unramified/activated microglia) we employed fractal analysis as a quantitative method to assess the morphology of microglia based on complexity (\nKarperien and Jelinek, 2015\n;\nMorrison et al., 2017\n). Phase images of DIV 14 live microglial cells were acquired using Zeiss Axio Observer Z.1 inverted microscope equipped with a 20\u00d7 objective. 10 randomly selected regions, per treatment group, containing microglia were selected for analysis. All images were processed using ImageJ as previously described (\nYoung and Morrison, 2018\n). In brief, a bandpass and unmask filter were applied to images followed by the despeckle function. The threshold function was used to make cells into solid, single object representations. Cells that were difficult to delineate from bordering cells were excluded from analysis. Gaps in the borders of cells were filled in manually. Fractal analysis of individual microglial cells was carried out using the box-counting method provided with the FracLac plug-in for ImageJ. Fractal dimension (D\nF\n) and lacunarity (\u039b) are measures of microglial morphological complexity. Fractal dimension quantifies the number of repeating complex pattern within the cell\u2019s shape (\nKarperien and Jeli- nek, 2015\n). Thus, activated (more circular shaped) microglia are less complex and have a lower fractal dimension compared to ramified/resting microglia. On the other hand, lacunarity describes the degree of heterogeneity that exists in a cell\u2019s shape. Activated ameboid microglia are expected to be more homogenous with more similarly sized gaps and little rotation variance in their morphology, and thus have low lacunarity. Ramified/less activated microglia tend to show more heterogeneity with many different sized gaps and notable rotational variance, and thus have higher lacunarity (\nKarperien and Jelinek, 2015\n). The ROIs used for analysis were identical for all cells. Around 15 cells were analyzed per image. Fractal dimension and lacunarity were used as dependent factors.\n\n2.8. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry\nMicroglia (post 24 h drug treatment) were aspirated and washed with PBS 1\u00d7 to remove residual culture media. Cells were suspended in 250 \u03bcL of 70% methanol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Details regarding sample preparation can be found in the\nSupplementary Methods\nsection. In brief, solid phase extraction was performed to enrich for molecules of interest followed by drying with N2 and reconstitution in 200 \u03bcL of resuspension buffer (7:1.5:1.5 0.1% acetic acid:acetonitrile: isopropanol). LC/MS/MS analysis of endocannabinoids was performed as described previously (\nGouveia-Figueira and Nording, 2015\n) with some modifications (for details see\nSupplementary Methods\n). Briefly, mass spectrometric analysis was performed on an Agilent 6490 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in positive ionization mode. Quantitation of endocannabinoids was achieved using a general isotope dilution strategy. Calibration standards were analyzed over a range of concentrations from 0.2\u201340 pg on column for all of the ethanolamides. At least three independent experiments were run per treatment group. Concentrations of AEA (pg/mL) was used as the dependent factor.\n\n2.9. Statistical analysis\nData were analyzed using analysis of variances (ANOVAs) followed by Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc test as appropriate (SPSS Statistics, Version 25, IBM). Violations of compound symmetry in repeated-measures ANOVAs for the within-subjects factors (i.e., comparing time points) were addressed by using the Greenhouse-Geisser degrees (\np\nGG\n) of freedom correction factor (\nGreenhouse and Geisser, 1959\n). An alpha level of\np\n< 0.05 was considered significant for all statistical tests. Statistics not shown in the text were found to be non-significant.\n\u03c9\n2\nwas provided as a measure of effect size. Data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM. All experiments and data analyses were carried out by experimenters blind to treatment condition."

    "Methods": "Construction of engineered MSC-exosome carrying miR-146a (exo-146a)\nMouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs, purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were transfected with XMIR-146a oligo (SBI System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Briefly, MSCs were seeded in 6-well plate and cultured in D-MEM/F-12 medium containing 5% exosome-depleted FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to 80% confluency. 2\u03bcg XMIR-146a oligo and 7.5 \u03bcL lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were diluted in 250 \u03bcL Opti-MEM\u2122 Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific), respectively before mixture. The DNA-lipid complex was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and added to MSCs for 4h. The transfection mixture was then removed and added to the exosome-free culture medium. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the medium was collected, centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris, and used fresh or stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.\nTo explore the in vivo distribution of MSC-exosomes, we produced GFP-CD63 containing exosomes. Brifely, MSCs were seeded in six-well plates and transfected with 4 \u03bcg/well of purified pCMV6-GFP-CD63 (pCMV6-GFP-CD63, OriGene Technologies Inc, Rockville, MD, USA) using lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 4 h, then remove the transfection mixture and add to exosome-free culture medium.\nThe cell culture medium containing exosomes was filtered through 0.22-\u03bcm filters. Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) at 100,000g for 2h at 4\u00b0C (\nFan et al., 2020\n). The exosomes in the pellet were suspended in saline and quantified using Nanosight system (NS300, Cambridge, UK). Western blot analysis was performed to detect common exosome markers.\n\nAnimals\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Henry Ford Hospital and conducted in strict accordance with NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Male BKS.Cg-\nm+/+Leprdb/J\n(db/db) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Same aged heterozygote mice (dm) were used as the control. At the age of 20 weeks, db/db mice were randomly divided into the following groups according to a randomization scheme: saline (db/db+vehicle), na\u00efve MSC-exosomes (db/db+exo-na\u00efve), and exo-146a (db/db+exo-146a). N= 8 per group. Exo-na\u00efve and exo-146a were injected via a tail vein once a week for four consecutive weeks. Db/db group and dm group were administrated with same volume of saline. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), glucose (Glc), total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) levels in blood were monitored weekly using Accu-check active test strips (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Serum insulin was tested prior to and after exosome treatment using a mouse ELISA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\n\nMechanical and thermal sensitivity tests\nThe plantar test was performed to examine the sensitivity of the mice to heat (\nFan et al., 2020\n;\nFan et al., 2018\n). Mice were acclimated for 20 min on a glass surface. A thermal stimulation meter (IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA, USA) was placed under the plantar of the left hind paw. The withdrawal latency in response to the radiant heat (heating intensity was set as 15%) was recorded. Each mouse was tested three times at 15 min intervals. Von Frey test was performed to examine tactile allodynia (\nChaplan et al., 1994\n).\n\nNeurophysiological Measurements\nMotor and sensory nerve conduction velocity (MCV, SCV) were examined using orthodromic recording methods (\nFan et al., 2020\n). The electrodes were placed at the right knee and the right sciatic notch of mice under anesthesia. Single square wave current pulses were given by the stimulator (Model 2100, A-M Systems, Sequim, WA, USA). MCV and SCV were calculated according to published studies (\nFan et al., 2018\n;\nObrosova et al., 2007\n).\n\nVasa nervorum blood flow\nBlood perfusion in plantar and sciatic nerve were measured using laser Doppler perfusion imager (LDPI) system (PeriCam PSI System, Perimed AB, USA) (\nFan et al., 2020\n;\nFan et al., 2018\n). The perfusion color scale was adjusted as 0\u2013250 for plantar and 0\u201360 for sciatic nerve. The Perfusion Units (PU) in selected regions of interest (ROI) were recorded. Mean perfusion values were calculated within 1 minute.\n\nMyelin sheath staining\nThe sciatic nerves were processed and cut into 2-\u03bcm thick transverse sections as previously described (\nFan et al., 2018\n;\nLiu et al., 2017a\n). The sections were stained with 1% toluidine blue. The diameter of axons, and myelinated and unmyelinated fibers were measured. The g-ratio was calculated as axon diameter/fiber diameter.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nFootpad samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin, then cut into sections (6 \u03bcm). The primary antibodies used were polyclonal rabbit anti-protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5, MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA) and CD68 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Normal rabbit IgG (Abcam) was used as a negative control and followed by Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Abcam) incubation. The number of PGP 9.5-immunoreactive nerve fiber density was calculated as previously described (\nFan et al., 2020\n;\nLiu et al., 2017a\n). One section was chosen every ten sections for a total of three cross-sections per animal, which were used for immunostaining.\n\nFlow cytometry\nBlood was collected and monocytes were isolated using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation (MilliporeSigma). The isolated monocytes were suspended in flow cytometry staining buffer (BD Biosciences) and incubated with fluorescence-conjugated antibodies for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. After washing with staining buffer, all samples were resuspended in PBS. Flow cytometry was performed using an SH800 flow cytometer (Sony Biotechnology, San Jose, CA). Antibodies against the following mouse antigens were used: CD11b (PE, 1:100, eBioscience), Ly-6C (APC, 1:100, eBioscience). Three distinct subsets of monocyte were characterized based on Ly-6C expression level: Ly6C\n+\n(classical), Ly6C\nint\n(intermediate), and Ly6C\n\u2212\n(non-classical) monocytes.\n\nQuantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)\nTo compare the content of miR-146a in exosomes, exo-na\u00efve and exo-146a were lysed in trizol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). For in vivo miR-146a analysis, sciatic nerve and footpad tissues were dissected from db/db mice treated with exo-na\u00efve or exo-146a (n = 3 mice/group) and lysed in trizol. Total RNA in each sample was isolated using miReasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed using miRNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystem). The program was set as 16\u00b0C 30min, 42\u00baC 30min and 85\u00baC 5min. TaqMan\u00ae microRNA assays were performed on a ViiA\n\u2122\n7 real-time PCR Instrument (Applied Biosystem) using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystem). The program was set as 95\u00b0C 10 min, followed by 95\u00b0C 15 s and 60\u00b0C 1min for 40 cycles. Each TaqMan assay was done in triplicate for each sample tested. Relative quantities were calculated as the endogenous control using the 2\n-\u0394\u0394Ct\nmethod with U6 snRNA as control (4427975, ID#000200, Applied Biosystem). Mmu-miR-146a-5p (4427975, ID#000468, Applied Biosystem)\n\nCell culture\nDb/m and db/db mice at the age of 20 weeks were anesthetized and injected intraperitoneally with PBS (containing 5 mmol/l EDTA). Macrophages were elicited and cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) in 24 well plates (10\n5\ncells/well) (Arroyo et al.). To test the effects of exo-na\u00efve and exo-146a on polarization, macrophages were treated with/without exosomes at a concentration of 1\u00d710\n6\nparticles/ml for 48 Both cells and medium were collected for further analysis.\nTo mimic the diabetes-like environment in vitro, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs, ATCC) were cultured with 25mM glucose for 48 h and then treated with/without exosomes at a concentration of 1\u00d710\n6\nparticles/ml for 48h. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer for Western blot analysis.\nQuantification was performed from at least three independent experiments.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nSciatic nerve or footpad dissected from db/db mice treated with/without exosomes were lysed with RIPA buffer containing 1% proteinase and centrifuged at 12,000g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C to remove debris. Protein concentration in supernatant was measured using BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 30\u03bcg of total protein from tissue or HMVEC sample was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. After being blocked with 3% BSA blocking buffer, the membranes were incubated with the following antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C: anti-\u03b2-actin (1:2000, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, 1:1000, EMD Millipore), Arginase-1 (Arg-1, 1:200, Santa Cruz), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4, 1:200, Santa Cruz), MyD88 (1:1000, Abcam), NF-KB p65 (1:500, Abcam), interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1, 1:200, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA), TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF6, 1:200, Santa Cruz), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1, 1:500, Abcam), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1, 1:1000, Abcam), CD9 (1:500, Abcam), CD63 (1:500, Abcam), Alix (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), HSP60 (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology), calreticulin (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology). The next day, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies for 2h and washed. The signals were visualized using an enhanced ECL substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Image J software was used to quantify the band intensity in Western blot images.\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)\nELISA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to quantify TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 concentrations in the supernatant of cell culture according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Non-parametric one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey`s post hoc test was performed for multiple group comparisons. Two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test was performed for two-group comparisons. A value of p<0.05 was taken as significant."

    "Methods": "Subjects.\nExperimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Florida (approval number: IRB201901170) and conformed to the\nDeclaration of Helsinki\n. Eleven healthy young adults (age = 29 \u00b1 6 years) were recruited (see\nTable 1\nfor subject characteristics). Exclusion criteria consisted of: history of asthma, smoking and/or cardiopulmonary or neurological illness, history of seizures and/or epilepsy, pregnancy, or presence of upper body metal implants. Subjects were asked to refrain from caffeine for 8 h before arrival to the laboratory.\nTable 1:\nSubject Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nValue\nAge\n29 \u00b1 6\nHeight (cm)\n173 \u00b1 8\nWeight (kg)\n80 \u00b1 21\nBody Mass Index (kg/m\n2\n)\n26 \u00b1 6\nMale:Female\n7:4\nOpen in a new tab\n\nExperimental design.\nA single AIH session was administered. Subjects were informed prior to testing that they would be assigned to receive either low (i.e. AIH) or normal oxygen; however, all subjects received AIH in a false-placebo design. Evoked diaphragm potentials were recorded before (PRE) and between 30\u201360 min post-AIH (POST). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to elicit diaphragm MEPs, whilst cervical magnetic stimulation (CMS) was used to elicit CMAPs. Both TMS and CMS were performed PRE and POST to isolate the site of plasticity along the pathway from brain to muscle. The delivery order of TMS and CMS was randomised and counter-balanced in the following fashion:\n1\n) AB-AB,\n2\n) AB-BA,\n3\n) BA-BA, or\n4\n) BA-AB; A is TMS, B is CMS; the first pair is PRE and the second pair is POST. The diaphragm electromyogram (EMG) was recorded using surface electrodes placed on the chest wall. On a separate day (at least one week later), six participants repeated the experiment with ambient (normoxic) room air instead of hypoxia as a sham control.\n\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation.\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation was performed according to the technique originally described by\nMaskill et al. (1991)\n. The vertex (Cz, international 10\u201320 electroencephalogram electrode placement system) of the skull was identified by the intersection between nasion to inion and tragus to tragus. Stimuli were delivered using a handheld 70-mm figure-of-eight remote coil (P/N 3190\u201300; peak magnetic field strength = 2.2 T, average inductance = 15.5 \u03bcH) powered by a magnetic stimulator (200\u20132, Magstim; Whitland, UK). The coil was held tangentially over the left hemisphere of the brain with current flowing in the anteroposterior direction and rotated in 45\u00b0 instalments until the largest MEP was observed. This location was marked on a cloth treatment cap (MagVenture; Farum, Denmark) or the scalp to ensure accurate coil positioning in future stimulations. Recruitment curves were plotted by gradually increasing the stimulus intensity from 60\u2013100% of the maximal stimulator output (MSO) in 5% increments. The stimulation order was randomised to avoid any potential confounding influence of an incremental paradigm. A minimum of seven stimuli were delivered at each intensity separated by 20\u201330 s. Stimuli were delivered at end-expiration, as determined using a piezoelectric respiration transducer (model 1132, Pneumotrace II, UFI; Morro Bay, CA, USA) placed securely around the abdomen at the level of the umbilicus.\n\nCervical magnetic stimulation.\nCervical magnetic stimulation was performed according to the technique described by\nSimilowski et al. (1989)\n. A 90-mm handheld circular coil (P/N 9784\u201300; peak magnetic field strength = 2.0 T, average inductance = 23.3 \u03bcH) was placed over the cervical spine between cervical vertebrae C\n3\n-C\n7\n. The coil was held horizontal with current flowing clockwise. Subjects were seated comfortably with the neck flexed. The optimal site of stimulation was identified by gradually moving the coil along C\n3\n-C\n7\nuntil the largest CMAP was observed. Stimulus-response curves were plotted as per TMS, with the first set of stimuli delivered at 40% MSO. Three stimuli were delivered at each intensity separated by 20\u201330 s. Stimuli were delivered at end-expiration.\n\nElectromyography.\nTo record electrical activity of the contralateral costal diaphragm, self-adhesive surface Ag/AgCl electrodes (6801, The Prometheus Group; Dover, NH, USA) were placed on the chest wall in bipolar arrangement (\u223c3 cm apart) between the sixth and eighth intercostal spaces along the anterior-axillary line. Surface recordings of diaphragm EMG in response to phrenic nerve stimulation (both TMS and CMS) have been previously validated (\nVerin et al., 2002\n;\nDemoule et al., 2003\n) and reliability established (\nWelch et al., 2017\n;\nWelch et al., 2020a\n). The ground electrode was placed on the acromion process of the scapula. Skin was lightly abraded and cleaned prior to electrode placement.\n\nAcute intermittent hypoxia.\nAcute intermittent hypoxia (target inspired oxygen fraction [F\nI\nO\n2\n] = 0.09) was delivered via a facemask attached to an oxygen generator (GO2altitude, Biomedtech; Melbourne, Australia). The oxygen generator was calibrated prior to testing using a gas analyser (model 17625, VacuMed; Ventura, CA, USA). The facemask (7900, Hans Rudolph; Kansas City, MO, USA) was connected to a two-way non-rebreathe valve (2700, Hans Rudolph; Kansas City, MO, USA) with the inspired limb attached to a three-way stop-cock (2100, Hans Rudolph; Kansas City, MO, USA) to allow for quick transition between hypoxic gas and room air. A total of 15 hypoxic episodes were delivered, each lasting one minute in duration interspersed by one minute breathing room air (30 minutes total). A sham hypoxia (F\nI\nO\n2\n= 0.21) control condition was administered to a subgroup of subjects (\nn\n= 6) on a separate day, using the same apparatus.\n\nCardiovascular responses (safety).\nOxyhaemoglobin saturation (S\np\nO\n2\n) and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously during AIH and sham hypoxia using finger pulse oximetry. Blood pressure (BP) was monitored during baseline eupnoea and once every three episodes during AIH and sham hypoxia using an automated sphygmomanometer (BP710N, Omron Healthcare Inc.; Lake Forest, IL, USA).\n\nData processing and analysis.\nEvoked diaphragm potentials were analysed using a previously detailed procedure (\nWelch et al., 2017\n;\nWelch et al., 2020a\n) for the following variables: latency (difference in time between stimulus artefact and MEP/CMAP onset), duration (difference in time between MEP/CMAP onset and offset), amplitude (voltage difference between positive and negative peaks), and area (total area of rectified EMG). Resting motor threshold (rMT) was defined to the nearest 5% increment as the lowest stimulus intensity that elicited an evoked potential amplitude of \u2265 50 \u03bcV in three consecutive stimulations (\nRossini et al., 1994\n). To take into account inter-individual differences in the shape of the stimulus-response curve, separate analyses were performed by comparing evoked responses PRE-POST for each individual at the nearest stimulation intensity to 50% of the difference between minimum and maximum amplitudes (\nV\n50\n) achieved PRE (\nNierat et al., 2014\n). This standardised technique places all individuals on the linear portion of their recruitment curve and is therefore insensitive to a ceiling effect. Recruitment curves were expressed as a percentage of the maximum amplitude response (% Mmax). Twitches were excluded from analysis for any of the following reasons:\na\n) the subject was not resting at functional residual capacity immediately preceding stimulation (determined by visual inspection of the respiration transducer trace/abdominal displacement),\nb\n) a cardiac artefact was superimposed upon a stimulus, and\nc\n) lack of diaphragmatic relaxation evidenced by the root mean square (RMS 250 ms) of diaphragm EMG immediately preceding a stimulus (conservative window was selected based upon estimated diaphragm EMG frequencies of 20\u2013250 Hz (\nSchweitzer et al., 1979\n)). Diaphragm RMS EMG was analysed for burst amplitude and frequency (number of bursts per minute/respiratory rate) during the final 2 min of eupnoea prior to stimulation. Electrocardiogram contamination of the EMG signal was removed using the gating technique (\nBartolo et al., 1996\n) and replaced with adjacent EMG activity (\nSinderby et al., 1998\n). Signals were amplified and band-pass filtered (0.01\u20131 kHz; ML-132, AD Instruments; Colorado Springs, CO, USA), sampled at 10 kHz (PowerLab 8/35, AD Instruments; Colorado Springs, CO, USA), and monitored online using LabChart data acquisition software (version 8.1, AD Instruments; Colorado Springs, CO, USA).\n\nStatistics.\nChanges in evoked potential amplitudes after AIH were assessed at all stimulation intensities using a repeated measures two-way ANOVA (stimulation intensity and time point [PRE\nvs\n. POST]). If there were significant main effects, pairwise comparisons were made using Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\ntest. Standardised comparisons were made PRE and POST at\nV\n50\nusing a paired-samples\nt\n-test. To compare changes in MEP/CMAP amplitudes at all stimulation intensities relative to baseline between AIH and sham hypoxia, a mixed two-way ANOVA was used (stimulation intensity and condition [AIH\nvs\n. sham]). Diaphragm RMS EMG for burst amplitude and frequency were compared PRE\nvs\n. POST using a paired-samples\nt\n-test. Data was inspected visually for normal distribution of residuals and homoscedasticity using histograms, Q-Q and residuals plots. Significance was set at\np\n< 0.05 for all statistical comparisons (SigmaPlot v12.5, Systat Software Inc.; San Jose, CA, USA). Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD, unless otherwise stated."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nTwelve-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice were sourced from The Jackson Laboratory. They were housed with a maximum of 4 mice per cage under 12-h light/12-h dark cycles with free access to food and water. Starting one week after PFF/PBS injection, the mice received subcutaneous injections of 0.24 mg/kg of a long-acting, extended release GLP-1 analogue (provided by Peptron Inc.) or vehicle (0.5% Carboxymethyl cellulose sodium, 5.0%\nd\n-mannitol and 0.1% Tween80 in sterile water) once every two weeks (\nFig. 1A\n). The dose was selected based on what previously was shown to be an effective dose in mice (\nBader et al., 2019\n). In addition, this dose was estimated to achieve plasma levels comparable to those measured in humans participating in the Exenatide PD trial (\nAthauda et al., 2017\n).\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nTreatment with a long-acting GLP-1 analogue increases cc-syn pathology in a prodromal PD model. (A) Experimental timeline; C57BL/6 J mice were injected with PFF or PBS and starting at one-week p.i., they received bi-weekly GLP-1 analogue or vehicle injections until the 5- or 13-week end points. (B) At both 5 and 13 weeks p.i., the long-acting GLP-1 analogue could be detected in plasma from mice treated with the drug (\nn\n= 1\u20137 for control groups and\nn\n= 6\u201312 for GLP-1 analogue groups). The effect of the GLP-1 analogue on \u03b1-syn pSerl29 spread and pathology burden was evaluated in (C) the AON and (D) the PRh at two different timepoints by quantifying the %area occupied by pSerl29 immunopositive signal using an AI algorithm. At the 13-week timepoint, \u03b1-syn pSerl29%area was significantly higher in the GLP-1 analogue treatment group compared to the control group in both the AON and PRh (74.5%;\np\n= 0.005). Representative images in panels below each graph show pSerl29 positive staining in the ipsilateral AON and PRh, scale bar = 250 \u03bcm and 100 \u03bcm, respectively. High magnification inserts scale bar = 50 \u03bcm. At 5 weeks,\nn = 6\nmice per group and at 13 weeks\nn\n= 9\u201310 mice per group were analyzed. (E) Neither PFF injection nor GLP-1 analogue treatment had any effect on neuronal cell survival assessed in the AON at 13 weeks p.i. (F) Representative images of NeuN/CV positive cells in the ipsilateral AON at 13 weeks p.i., scale bar = 250 \u03bcm and\nn\n= 7\u201310 mice per group. (G) The ipsilateral AON in PFF mice treated with the long-acting GLP-1 analogue had a significant increase in the area/perimeter ratio of Iba-1 positive cells compared to the ipsilateral AON of PFF control mice (p = 0.005), the ipsilateral AON of PBS GLP-1 analogue mice (\np\n\u2264 0.001) and the contralateral side of PFF GLP-1 analogue mice (\np\n= 0.004) 13 weeks p.i. (H) Representative images of the Iba-1 immunopositive microglia in the ipsilateral AON 13 weeks p.i., scalebar = 50 \u03bcm and\nn\n= 5\u20136 mice per group were analyzed. 0) No significant differences in astrocyte activation (GFAP immunopositive %area) were observed between any of the groups in the AON 13 weeks p.i. (J) Representative images of the ipsilateral AON immunostained for GFAP, scale bar = 25 \u03bcm and n = 6 mice per group were analyzed.\nThe study presented here was performed in parallel with the insulin sensitizer (MSDC-0160) study; the control groups (i.e., no GLP-1 analogue treatment) are the same as published in Peelaerts et al., Free Neuropathology 1:33 (doi:\n10.17879/freeneuropathology-2020-3049\n) (\nPeelearts et al., 2020\n). Tissue and blood plasma were collected 5- and 13-weeks post injection (p.i.) and at both timepoints all mice that received the drug had detectable plasma levels of the GLP-1 analogue, ranging from 42 to 1053 pg/mL (\nFig. IB\n). The housing of animals and all procedures were performed in accordance with the\nGuide for die Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n(United States National Institutes of Health) and were approved by Van Andel Research Institute\u2019s Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n2.2. \u03b1-Syn preformed fibril olfactory bulb injections\nWe performed unilateral stereotactic injections of mouse \u03b1-syn PFF into the right olfactory bulb (\nRey et al., 2016\n). Before surgery, PFFs were prepared by sonication of \u03b1-syn aggregates in a water-bath cup-horn sonicator for four min (QSonica, Q700 sonicator, 50% power, 120 pulses 1 s ON, 1 s OFF). Either 0.8 \u03bcL of PFF (5 \u03bcg/\u03bcL;\nn\n= 18, 9 females/males) or 0.8 \u03bcL of PBS as a control (n = 18, 9 females/males) were injected using the following coordinates from bregma: AP: +5.4 mm; ML: \u22120.75 mm and DV: \u22121.0 mm from dura. Injections were made with a rate of 0.2 \u03bcL/min using a glass capillary attached to a 10 \u03bcL Hamilton syringe.\n\n2.3. GLP-1 analogue plasma levels\nWhole blood was collected 5 and 13 weeks p.i. from the submandibular vein in BD heparinized tubes. The samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C (2000 g), followed by collection of the supernatant which was snap frozen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Plasma GLP-1 analogue levels were quantified by using the Peptron Exendin-4 EIA Kit (Peptron Inc., Daejeon, South Korea); the same assay used to quantify plasma levels of Exenatide in previous studies (\nAthauda et al., 2017\n;\nBader et al., 2019\n). Each sample was evaluated in duplicate at a volume of 50 \u03bcL each, with a plasma dilution of 1:5. Concentrations of the long-acting GLP-1 analogue were subsequently determined from standard curves of newly prepared GLP-1 analogue, following preliminary studies to ensure that all results fell within the linear range of the plasma standard curves.\n\n2.4. Immunohistochemistry\nMice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (130 mg/kg; Sigma) and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Brains were removed, post-fixed overnight at 4 \u00b0C in 4% PFA and subsequently placed in 30% sucrose. All immunohistochemical analysis was done on 40 \u03bcm coronal sections containing the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) and the perirhinal cortex (PRh), collected as serial tissue sections spaced by 240 \u03bcm. Immunostaining using 1:10,000 pSerl29 \u03b1-syn antibody (Abeam, Ab51253), 1:1000 NeuN antibody (Millipore, Ab377) or 1:800 Ibal antibody (Wako, 019\u201319741) was carried out as described in Peelaerts et al. at Free Neuropathology 1:33 (doi:\n10.17879/freeneuropathology-2020-3049\n). For immunostaining of activated astrocytes, a 1:800 antibody directed against GFAP was applied (Abeam, ab7260) and incubated at RT overnight. A secondary biotinylated goat-anti-rabbit antibody was added at 1:500 (Vector Laboratories, BA-1000) for 2 h, RT. The antibody signal was amplified using a standard peroxidase-based method (VectaStain ABC kit) and developed using a DAB kit (Vector Laboratories). Immunostained sections were mounted onto gelatin coated glass slides, dehydrated and coverslipped.\n\n2.5. pSerl29 quantification\nThe quantification of phosphorylated \u03b1-syn (pSerl29) in the AON and PRh at 5 and 13 weeks p.i. was performed as described in Peelaerts et al., Free Neuropathology 1:33 (doi:\n10.17879/freeneuropathology-2020-3049\n). In short, 20\u00d7 z-stack images with extended depth focus (EDF) of glass slides containing the tissue were collapsed into 2D images using a whole slide scanner (Zeiss, Axioscan Zl). The regions corresponding to the AON and the PRh were outlined according to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (Allen Institute) and a deep learning convolution neural network (Aiforia) was used to quantify the area percentage that contained pSerl29 immunopositive signal.\n\n2.6. Stereology\nWe quantified NeuN and CV-positive cells on every 6th AON (240 \u03bcm) section using the optical fractionator probe in Stereo Investigator software (MBF Bioscience). The counting was done using a 60\u00d7 oil objective, with the grid set to 200 \u00d7 200 and the frame to 40 \u00d7 40, in the AON outlined according to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas using a 2.5\u00d7 objective. The dissector height used was 10 \u03bcm, with a 3 \u03bcm guard zone. The Gunderson estimated m = 1 error was less than 0.1 and a total of 9 to 10 animals was counted per group. The data for the control groups reported here are the same as in Peelaerts et al. at Free Neuropathology 1:33 (doi:\n10.17879/freeneuropathology-2020-3049\n).\n\n2.7. Microglia morphology\nThe ratio of area/perimeter (referred to as hydraulic radius) was calculated as previously described (\nGeorge et al., 2019\n). The area/perimeter index is used as a measure for microglial activation. Because activated microglia are amoeboid in shape, these cells have a large surface area and small perimeter, increasing the index score. In short, color (RBG) images were generated using a 60\u00d7 oil objective. Following imaging, a custom MATLAB script assessed the morphology of the imaged microglia, calculating the area/perimeter ratio. Five to six animals per group were analyzed. Microglia were imaged from every 6th AON section and a minimum of 26 individual microglia were analyzed per animal, with the average microglia area/perimeter ratio reported. The data for the control groups reported here are the same as in Peelaerts et al., Free Neuropathology 1:33 (doi:\n10.17879/freeneuropathology-2020-3049\n).\n\n2.8. Astrocyte activation\nAt 13 weeks p.i., we quantified the percentage area containing activated astrocytes (GFAP immunopositive) in the AON. Slides with mounted tissue sections immunostained for GFAP positive astrocytes were scanned using a whole slide scanner (Aperio AT2, Leica Biosystems). Analysis of GFAP immunopositive area in the AON was performed using the HALO image analysis platform (Indica Labs). The Area Quantification tool (v2.1.3*) was used to quantify the GFAP immunopositive area percentage (stain min OD: 0.18, 0.25, 0.35). Images were collected at 20\u00d7 from every 6th AON section (i.e., every 240 \u03bcm), with six animals analyzed per group.\n\n2.9. Statistics\nAll data were analyzed using R v3.6.0 (\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/\n) and assumed two-sided hypothesis tests with a significance level < 0.05 after Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) multiple testing corrections. BH corrections included the additional tests attributed to the shared control group from Peelaerts et al., Free Neuropathology 1:33 (doi:\n10.17879/freeneuropathology-2020-3049\n). The quantification of pSerl29 was analyzed using a beta mixed-effects model, the number of NeuN-immunoreactive cells was analyzed using a negative binomial mixed-effects model, and both GFAP- and Iba-1 immunostained cells were analyzed via linear mixed-effects models (LMMs). LMM assumptions were verified via standard regression diagnostics (normality of residuals and random effects via qq-plots, leverage via Cook\u2019s distance, and equal variance via boxplots of the residuals); no evidence of assumption violations was identified. All mixed-effects models included random intercepts to account for the paired hemispheres."

    "Methods": "Animals:\nTwenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats (6 weeks old, 250\u2013275 g at arrival, Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) were single-housed in a temperature and humidity controlled 12-hr reverse light/dark cycle room with food and water available\nad libitum\n. Rats were divided into four groups based on lesion or L-DOPA treatment: na\u00efve non-lesioned controls (\nn\n=8), PD (\nn\n=7), LID 7-d priming (\nn\n=6), and LID 21-d priming (\nn\n=7). Sample sizes for groups were determined by previous experiments (\nYe et al., 2018\n). Following the initial set of experiments (days 1\u201310), animals in the 7-d priming group were kept in the colony room and did not receive any L-DOPA priming injections for 28 days (\nFig. 1A\n). This condition allowed us to investigate what occurs when the effects of priming wears off. All procedures were in accordance with NIH guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved IACUC protocols at the University of Arizona. The experimental design for the studies is summarized in\nFig. 1\n.\nFigure 1. Experimental Design and Neural Recordings.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A)\nSchematic of 7-day priming protocol in Experiment 1. 6-OHDA-lesioned animals received L-DOPA (\ni.p\n., 12 mg/kg) for 7 consecutive days. Animals then received a 7 mg/kg injection of L-DOPA on days 8\u201310. Following a 28-day abstinence from L-DOPA, the same animals once again received a single injection of L-DOPA (12 mg/kg) paired with ketamine (20 mg/kg).\n(B)\nTimeline of neural recording sessions on days 7 and 38 of the 7-day LID priming animals. Recordings began with 1-hr baseline. Animals were then injected with L-DOPA (12 mg/kg). LAO + AIMs scored every 20 minutes. On Day 38 (but not Day 7) ketamine (20 mg/kg,\ni.p\n.) given 90 minutes after L-DOPA.\n(C)\nSchematic of 21-day priming protocol for Experiment 2. 6-OHDA-lesioned animals were administered L-DOPA (7 mg/kg) daily for 21 days. After 21 days, maintenance injections of L-DOPA (7 mg/kg) were given every 3 days. Neural recordings were not conducted during the 21-day priming period.\n(D)\nTimeline of neural recordings for na\u00efve and PD animals (top) and 21-day priming LID animals (bottom). Recordings began with a 1 hr baseline followed by a ketamine injection (20 mg/kg,\ni.p\n.) every two hours, totaling to 5 injections. For LID animals (bottom), the 5\nth\nketamine injection was paired with L-DOPA (7 mg/kg).\n(E)\nA custom-made 32-channel electrode surgically implanted into the right hemisphere of all experimental animals.\n(F)\nSchematic of electrode array placement (AP: +1.3, ML: +2.7 centered, DV: \u22126.8 deepest electrode) and representative example of histological verification of targets. RIGHT: Verification of 6-OHDA lesioning in 6-OHDA and LID animals via tyrosine-hydroxylase staining. Expression of tyrosine-hydroxylase (dark pigmentation; left hemisphere) is a marker of functioning dopaminergic neurons.\n(G)\nVerification of a successful (>90%) 6-OHDA lesion results in a light pigmentation of the striatum (right hemisphere). Behavioral verification of 6-OHDA lesion via amphetamine rotation tests provided in\nSupplementary Table 1\n.\n\nUnilateral 6-OHDA-lesion PD model:\nAs previously published (\nBartlett et al., 2016\n), 6-OHDA hydrochloride was injected into 2 locations (5 \u03bcg/site) of the medial forebrain bundle: MFB: AP = \u22121.8 mm, ML= +2.0 mm, DV= \u22128.2 mm and AP = \u22122.8 mm, ML= +1.8 mm, DV = \u22128.2 mm. Amphetamine-induced (5.0 mg/kg,\ni.p\n., Sigma-Aldrich) rotations were administered ~3 weeks post-surgery and were scored by blinded experimenters to assess the degree of lesion (\nSupplementary Table 1\n). An average score \u22655 corresponds to >90% dopamine depletion (\nDekundy et al., 2007\n). Rats that reached criteria were divided into three groups: LID induction with 7-d priming (\nn\n=6), 21-d priming (\nn\n=7), or PD (\nn\n=7).\n\nElectrode implantation:\nFollowing the procedure reported in\nYe et al., 2018\n, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and implanted with two custom-made 32-channel electrode arrays by the experimenters (\nFig. 1E\n), with each array composed of 16 twisted-wire stereotrodes (California Fine Wire Co., Grover Beach, CA). All recordings were referenced to a cerebellar skull screw. The anterior array was placed in the right hemisphere, and individual stereotrodes targeted M1 (AP:+1.3, ML:+2.3, DV:\u22121.4), DLS (AP:+1.3, ML:+3.5, DV:\u22123.8), DMS (AP:+1.3, ML:+2.9, DV:\u22124.6), and NAc (AP:+1.3, ML:+1.7, DV:\u22126.8) (\nFig. 1F\n). The posterior array was implanted over the hippocampus (centered at AP: \u22123.0, ML: +2.2) with electrodes lowered near the fissure (DV: \u22123.2), CA1 (DV: \u22122.3), dentate gyrus (DV: \u22123.8), and S1 (DV: \u22121.4). Data from the posterior hippocampal array was not included in analyses. Rodent welfare was monitored daily by experimenters and animal care staff. Post-operative analgesia: 5 mg/kg (\ns.c\n.) Carprofen (Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ) for 48 h post-surgery. Topical anti-biotic ointment (Water-Jel Technologies, Carlstadt, NJ) given for up to 5 days as needed. The non-lesioned na\u00efve control rats were surgically implanted 2\u20133 weeks after arrival (~2 months old). The PD and LID 7 d priming groups were implanted approximately one week after amphetamine rotation tests (~5 months old), and the LID 21-d priming group were implanted after the 21-d priming period (~6 months old).\n\nDrug treatments:\nUsing a paradigm described in\nBartlett and colleagues (2016)\n, drugs were delivered during neural recording sessions through five intraperitoneal (\ni.p\n.) injections of ketamine or saline (\nFig. 1D\n). The first injection was delivered (6 AM) after one hour of baseline recording. Each injection was separated by two hours. Injections were either ketamine hydrochloride (20 mg/kg) (Clipper Distributing, St. Joseph, MO) or 0.9% saline (SAL) solution. For the rats in the LID-priming group (LID rats), the 5\nth\ninjection of ketamine or SAL included a co-injection of L-DOPA (7 mg/kg,\ni.p\n., Sigma-Aldrich).\n\n7-d and 21-d LID priming in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, maintenance, and behavioral analysis:\nApproximately 6 weeks after the 6-OHDA lesion, rats in the high-dose 7-d L-DOPA priming group (\nn\n=6) were treated daily with L-DOPA (12 mg/kg) + benserazide (15 mg/kg,\ns.c\n., Sigma-Aldrich) for 7 d (\ni.e\n., during L-DOPA priming) (\nFig. 2A\n\u2013\nD\n). Rats in the low-dose 21-d L-DOPA priming group were treated daily with L-DOPA (7 mg/kg,\ni.p\n.) + benserazide (14 mg/kg) for 3 weeks, as previously published (\nBartlett et al., 2016\n) (\nFig. 1C\n). Rats in the 21-d group received maintenance doses of L-DOPA (7 mg/kg + 15 mg/kg benserazide) following the 21-d priming period (two doses per week, every 2\u20133 days for the remainder of the experiment). L-DOPA-induced AIMs were scored by an experimentally blinded investigator on a scale from 0 to 4, and cumulative limb, axial, and orolingual (LAO) scores for all LID rats across all sessions are presented in\nFig. 3B\nas previously published (\nBartlett et al., 2016\n). After the 21-d priming period, rats that met behavioral criteria (\nn\n=7) proceeded to surgical implantation, and were given maintenance injections of L-DOPA (7 mg/kg) every 2\u20133 days to maintain stable dyskinesia (\nBartlett et al., 2016\n). This contrasts with the 7-d priming group that was implanted prior to L-DOPA exposure. Neural recordings began one week following implantation.\nFigure 2.

Average spectral power is shown for Day 10 (7 mg/kg).\n(D)\nAfter abstaining from L-DOPA for 28 days, animals once again received 12 mg/kg of L-DOPA followed 90 minutes by an injection of ketamine (20 mg/kg).\n(E)\nCumulative Limb, Axial, and Orolingual (LAO) scores (mean\u00b1SEM) for each 20 min time point of the recording sessions on Days 7, 10, and 38.

A light-emitting diode (LED) was attached to the rat\u2019s implant for video tracking (Manta G-033C, Allied Vision, Exton, PA). Recordings and drug injections were conducted in a polycarbonate cage (47cm \u00d7 51cm \u00d7 20cm) once per week for each animal commencing at 5 AM. Food and water were available\nad libitum\n. Recordings for the 7-d priming experiments were conducted in a large (150cm \u00d7 150cm \u00d7 23cm) open field to limit artifacts from dyskinetic animals hitting cage walls. AIMs were scored during each neurophysiological recording only for the animals in the 7-d priming group (\nFig. 1A\n).\n\nHistology and immunohistochemistry:\nDirect current stimulation (20 \u03bcA for 20 s) was used for electrolytic lesions at each recording site. Three-days following the lesion, rats were injected with a fatal dose of Euthasol (0.35 mg/kg,\ni.p\n.; Virbac, Fort Worth, TX) and transcardially perfused via phosphate buffered saline and 4% paraformaldehyde. A frozen microtome was used to produce coronal sections (40 \u03bcM) for Nissl staining (\nYe et al., 2018\n) (\nFig. 1F\n) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH;\nBartlett et al., 2016\n) (\nFig. 1G\n) for verification of electrode placement and dopamine-depleted striatum, respectively.\n\nData pre-processing and statistical analysis:\nRaw LFP signals were acquired at 20 kHz and down sampled to 500 Hz for analysis. Absolute values of the LFP trace that exceeded 1.5 mV or the 99.98\nth\npercentile after cross-band power (2\u2013160 Hz) summation were considered artifact and omitted from the analyses. To reduce the impact of volume-conduction, signals were locally re-referenced using a second within-region electrode (0.7 mm inter-electrode distance) at the same depth (\nYe et al., 2018\n). ANOVAs and Student\u2019s\nt\n-tests (\u03b1=0.05) were used to assess statistical significance. All\npost-hoc\ncomparisons were Tukey-Kramer or Holm corrected to adjust\np\n-values. All analyses were performed using MATLAB.\n\nAnalysis of spectral activity, cross-frequency coupling, and movement speed:\nThe spectral power across frequency bands was determined using a fast Fourier transform spectrogram (frequency bin=0.5 Hz, 10 s Hanning window, spectrogram() in Matlab). The frequency bands used for statistical analysis were defined as follows: delta (1\u20134 Hz), theta (5\u201310 Hz), beta (15\u201330 Hz), low-gamma (35\u201355 Hz), high-gamma (70\u201385 Hz), broadband gamma (35-\u201385 Hz), and HFO (120\u2013160 Hz). Gamma was divided into separate bands given evidence for distinct roles played by different frequencies in neuronal communication (\nBuzs\u00e1ki, 2010\n;\nLisman and Idiart, 1995\n;\nLisman and Jensen, 2013\n), plasticity (\nBuzs\u00e1ki and Wang, 2012\n;\nColgin et al., 2009\n;\nGaluske et al., 2019\n), and motor activity (\nJohnson et al., 2017\n;\nMuthukumaraswamy, 2010\n). Broadband gamma was also included given the association between broadband activity and increased neuronal excitability and desynchronized activity (\nSohal and Rubenstein, 2019\n;\nYizhar et al., 2011\n). The band used here to define high gamma is narrower than some definitions given the focal nature of 80-Hz activity in LID.\nTo address the issue of power-law 1/f scaling, data was normalized using the Z-transform (Cohen, 2014). The baseline mean (\u221232 to \u22122 min preceding the first injection) was subtracted from the spectral power and then divided by the standard deviation (S.D.) to yield a z-score. Video tracking of rat\u2019s movement was measured in cm/second (s). This data was also normalized using the baseline mean with same Z-transform procedure to yield a z-score (i.e., Z-speed) to assess change in overall movement compared to the baseline period.\nPhase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (PAC) was measured as described in Cohen (2014) and\nYe et al., (2018)\n. First, LFP signals were filtered in the target low- and high-frequency bands using a Butterworth filter (fs=500 Hz, order=6). Phase was extracted using a Hilbert transform. Power was extracted as the envelope of the absolute value of the filtered signal. CFC was computed as\nP\nA\nC\n=\n|\nn\n-\n1\n\u2211\nt\n=\n0\nn\na\nt\ne\ni\n\u03c6\nt\n|\nwhere\na\nis high-frequency power and \u03d5 is the phase of the low-frequency signal. This value was compared to values computed using a randomized shuffle control (\nn\n=200 permutations). The mean and SD of this null hypothesis distribution were used to convert the measured PAC score into a z score (PACz). All data in figures show mean \u00b1 SEM unless otherwise noted.\n\nData Availability\nThe data are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request."

All studies were conducted in accordance with the United States Public Health Service\u2019s Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and ARRIVE guidelines. Animals were randomized into groups using an online tool (http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/) and all evaluations were performed in a blind fashion. Information for the experimental design and animals used in all stroke outcome experiments is summarized inFigure S2andTable S1.\n\nAnimals and surgeries.\nXbp1\nf/f\n;Emx1-Cre (Xbp1-cKO) knockout mice, tTRE-XBP1s;Camk2a-tTA (XBP1s-TG) transgenic mice, C57BL/6 mice and aged F344 rats were used. Animal surgeries included 2 models of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), a photothrombotic stroke model, and a transient global brain ischemia model. Thiamet-G (30 mg/kg) and glucosamine (200 or 300 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally or intravenously.\n\nBehavioral tests.\nBehavioral tests included rotarod, tape removal test, pole test, open field, foot fault, cylinder test, and 48-point scoring.\n16\n\nInfarct, immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting.\nInfarct volumes, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blotting were performed as described previously\n4\n.\n\nViral construct and stereotaxic injection.\nAn adeno-associated virus (AAV)\nXbp1s\nexpression vector was constructed and used to generate high-titer AAV8-XBP1s viral particles. Unilateral viral injections into the hippocampus of young and aged mice were performed.\n\nMeasurement of UDP-GlcNAc in the brain.\nTo quantify UDP-GlcNAc in the brain, we developed a novel and simple LC-MS/MS-based method (the method is detailed in the\nsupplemental Methods\nsection).\n\nStatistical Analysis.\nAll data analyses were performed using Prism 8 (GraphPad Software). The primary outcome for stroke experiments was infarct volume (short-term) or neurologic score (long-term), which was used to determine the group size for each experiment based on our previous studies or pilot experiments. All stroke outcome data have been subjected to Shapiro-Wilk tests to assess normality. Most of the data were normally distributed and thus were analyzed with parametric tests, but when data did not exhibit a normal/Gaussian distribution, non-parametric tests were applied. Statistical analysis was assessed by unpaired Student\u2019s\nt\n-test or Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest. To compare more than 2 groups, one-way ANOVA with\npost hoc\nHolm-Sidak correction for multiple comparisons was performed. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD or the median (neurologic score). Univariate scatterplots were used to present all stroke outcome data. The level of significance was set at\np\n< 0.05."

    "Methods": "We recruited 11 persons with chronic (> 1 year), incomplete SCI to participate in a randomized, double-blind, balanced, crossover study. Participants first received either daily (5 consecutive days) AIH (15, 90-sec episodes of 10.0% O2with 60s intervals at 20.9% O2) or SHAM (15, 90s episodes at 20.9% O2with 60s intervals at 20.9% O2) followed by 30-minutes of overground walking practice. They received the second treatment after a minimum 2-week washout period. We quantified overground walking performance, in terms of speed and endurance, using the 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT) and 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), respectively. We quantified intralimb motor coordination using kinematic variability measures of foot trajectory (i.e., endpoint variability, EV) and of inter-joint coupling between the hip and knee, as well as between the knee and ankle joints (i.e., angular coefficient of correspondence, ACC). We compared the changes in walking performance relative to baseline (BL) between daily AIH+WALK and daily SHAM+WALK on treatment day 5 (T5), 1-week follow-up (F1), and 2-weeks follow-up (F2). We also compared these changes between participants who used bilateral walking aids (N=5) and those who did not. To assess the effects of daily AIH+WALK on intralimb coordination, we compared potential treatment-induced changes in EV and ACC relative to BL at F1and F2."

    "Methods": "Animals\nExperiments used male and female mice aged 10\u201316 weeks at the start of experiments, obtained from Jackson Labs (C57BL/6J #000664) or bred in-house (Ai9 RCL-tdT Jackson #007905 on C57Bl6 background, receiving no Cre). Mice were group housed under a 12/12 light/dark cycle (6am on time) with experiments carried out during the light phase. To ensure that animals were acting under food motivated conditions, all animals in necessary experiments were maintained on food deprivation 7 days/week. They were fed daily following behavioral testing and maintained at 80% of initial body weight, both during the training and testing phases. All animals had unlimited access to food starting 2 days prior to surgery and extending to 7 days post operation. All experiments were approved of by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Safety Committee at Marquette University and in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nViral delivery to cortical neurons\nCortical neurons were transduced using intracerebral microinjection(\nBlackmore et al., 2012\n;\nWang et al., 2018\n,\n2015\n). Mice were anesthetized IP with ketamine/xylazine cocktail (100mg/kg, 10mg/kg). Animals received cortical injections of either control AAV9-luc-EGFP:saline 1:3 or AAV9-luc-EGFP:AAV8 KLF6 1:3 delivered into motor cortex through a pulled glass pipette fitted onto a 10\u03bcl Hamilton microsyringe. Mice received two injections to target the corticospinal tract (bregma AP 0.0 ML 1.3 DV .5, AP .5 ML 1.3 DV .5). Each injection was .5\u03bcL/site delivered at a rate of .05\u03bcl/min using a Stoelting QSI pump (#53311). Following each injection the pipette was left in place for 1 minute to minimize the back flow of viral solution. Viruses were designed in house and generated from the University of North Carolina Vector Core as previously described (\nWang et al., 2018\n).\n\nPyramidotomy transection of CST\nAnimals received unilateral pyramidotomy at the level of medullary pyramid to fully transect the CST of the tract that was not virally labeled (\nKathe et al., 2014\n;\nWang et al., 2018\n,\n2015\n). Animals were anesthetized as described above and depth of anesthesia was maintained throughout surgery. The medullary pyramids were exposed, the dura was removed, and a .5mm deep cut was made on the medial portion of the medullary pyramid to disrupt the CST using Vannas spring scissors (FST 15002\u201308). The injury site was then manually traced with a 30g syringe tip to ensure complete transection of the CST (\nStarkey et al., 2005\n;\nKathe et al., 2014\n).\n\nHistology\nAnimals were euthanized using CO\n2\nand subjected to transcardiac perfusion with PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brain and spinal column were postfixed in 4% PFA for 3\u20135 hours, followed by fine dissected of brain, medulla and cervical spinal cord (a 6mm segment spanning C1-C6), which were fixed overnight in 4% PFA in 4\u00b0C and stored in PBS. Tissue was embedded in gelatin and fixed in 4% PFA overnight before being sliced to 100\u03bcm (Leica VT1200) and stored in PBS with .02% w/v NaAzide. For PKC\u03b3 immunohistochemistry, 100\u03bcm sections from C2\u20133 spinal cord were blocked in a 10% NGS, 3% triton in PBS solution for 1hr at room temperature, incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with PKC\u03b3 rabbit antibody (Abcam 4145, 1:500), rinsed, incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 546 secondary antibody (ThermoFisher A-11035 1:500) for 2hrs at RT with DAPI (1:2000), and then mounted on slides and imaged on an Olympus IX81 microscope at 20x. Success of pyramidotomy was evaluated by measuring the intensity of PKC\u03b3 signal on the injured side as compared to the intact side. Any animal that had more than 20% of signal on the injured side was considered incomplete and not included in any behavioral or anatomical analyses (\nSupplementary Figure 1\nand\nSupplementary Table 2\n) (\nBlackmore et al., 2012\n;\nWang et al., 2018\n).\n\nQuantification of CST sprouting and calculation of fiber index\nThree transverse slices cervical spinal cord sections at C1/C2, C3/C4 and C5/C6 from each animal were imaged at 20x magnification on the Olympus IX81 microscope. The number of EGFP+ axons at 200 and 400\u03bcm distance from the central canal was counted (\nWang et al., 2015\n). The medullary pyramids were imaged on the Olympus IX81 confocal microscope at 60x magnification and EGFP+ axons were counted for each animal. A minimum of 1,000 labelled CST neurons in the medulla was required for inclusion criteria (\nSupplementary Table 2\n). The fiber index was calculated by dividing the spinal cord axon count by the total number of EGFP+ axons quantified in transverse sections of medullary pyramid (\nSupplementary Table 1\n) (\nBlackmore et al., 2012\n;\nWang et al., 2015\n,\n2018\n).\n\nAssessment of skilled motor grasping\nTo assess forelimb dexterity animals were trained on the mouse staircase (Lafayette Instruments #80301) to retrieve 20mg high fat high cholesterol (21% w/v, 2.1% w/v) dustless precision pellets custom designed by BioServ (\nMontoya et al., 1991\n;\nJayaprakash et al., 2016\n). Staircases were modified by adding a glass barrier at the edge of the platform to prevent the animals from reaching pellets that had fallen to the floor from the stairs. To reduce neophobia animals were habituated to food pellets in home cage for 2 days preceding food deprivation. On each pretraining day animals were placed on the staircase for 30 minutes with all eight steps of the staircase loaded with 2 pellets each. At the end of each session the number of pellets retrieved, and pellets displaced were recorded for each side of the staircase. Criteria for inclusion in experiments was a pellet retrieval of \u22658 pellets by the end of the training period which lasted 15\u201318 days (\nFig. 3A\n). Animals that met criterion were included in surgical experiments and further testing, animals that did not meet criterion were dropped from the study (\nSupplementary Table 2\n). For postinjury testing all animals were tested on the staircase 2x/week and the average for that week was used as the score for that animal for that time point (\nPagnussat et al., 2009\n;\nFouad et al., 2010\n). Data represent postsurgical pellet retrieval normalized to presurgical training retrieval for each animal.\nFigure 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nKLF6 and delayed rehabilitative training produce no improvements in forelimb function after pyramidotomy injury. (A) Experimental overview; animals were pretrained on the staircase and modified ladder tasks, treated with AAV-control or AAV-KLF6, and then received pyramidotomy. Weekly behavioral testing began 2 weeks post-injury, and half of the animals received rehabilitation starting 4 weeks post-injury. (B) Shows the staircase pellet retrieval task, in which the animal reaches downward to grasp food pellets (black arrow), which become progressively more difficult to retrieve as the stair deepen. (C) Modified ladder walking assay, in which animals walk atop a wheel with irregularly spaced rungs (black arrow) that rotate beneath the animals at a constant speed. (D-G) show categories of scored steps, including correct placement (D), toe stepping (E), heel stepping (F) and complete misses (G). (H) Quantification of correctly placed foot placements show an injury-induced reduction in performance that persisted for the duration of the experiment, and which did not differ significantly between any groups (p>.05 3-way RM ANOVA). (I) Quantification of pellets retrieved shows an injury-triggered reduction followed by a prolonged deficit that did not differ between KLF6 or rehabilitation-treated groups (p>.05 3-way ANOVA). (J) Quantification of displaced pellets in the grasping staircase task show stable levels throughout the experiment with no difference between the groups (p>.05 3-way ANOVA). N= 7 (untrained AAV-control), N=7 (untrained AAV-KLF6), N=6 (trained AAV-control), N=10 (trained AAV-KLF6). Error bars show \u00b1SEM. Scale bar is 200\u03bcm.\n\nAssessment of skilled fine motor limb placement\nTo test skilled forelimb placement we utilized a custom-built apparatus consisting of a wheel (circumference 50.26cm) of irregularly spaced rungs (spaced .9\u20131.8cm), designed as a modified form of horizontal ladder-crossing (\nMetz and Whishaw, 2009\n;\nWang et al., 2015\n). In this task animals walked in place atop the wheel, which was rotated at a constant speed (1.26 cm/s) and the task was videorecorded with the camera placed to capture the motion of the affected limb (\nFig. 3C\n). The animal walked for three full revolutions of the wheel, with the final two rotations scored for walking behavior. Animals were habituated to the wheel in three 5-minute sessions before the first recorded time point. Animals were first tested before surgery, and then weekly starting 2 weeks following pyramidotomy. Ladder testing was scored by a blinded viewer watching the videos in slow motion (Windows Media Player 10). A correct step was classified as the paw centered on the rung with the digits closing over the rung. Any weight bearing step in which the toes or heel were placed on the rung, or in which the foot missed the rung completely, was classified as incorrect (\nFig. 3D\n\u2013\nG\n). The number of errors at each postsurgical time point was normalized to the number of errors in the presurgical test for that animal.\n\nTask-based rehabilitation of CST forelimb behavior\nAAV-control and AAV-KLF6 animals were divided into untrained and trained groups following injury, and the training group received behavioral training as detailed above starting at 4 weeks post injury. The rehabilitation training groups received staircase training 5 days/week with 2 days counted for weekly testing. The rehabilitation group also received 4 days a week of ladder walking training on a grate with evenly spaced horizontal bars spaced 1.25cm apart. Each time an animal crossed the ladder it entered into a holding chamber and received a 20mg high fat pellet and after 30 seconds the gate opened and the animal crossed back across the ladder to enter into the opposite holding chamber and receive another food pellet. Animals crossed the ladder 60 times each training day. Rehabilitation training continued for 10 weeks, until 14 weeks post injury, when the experiment was terminated and tissue was collected.\n\nStatistics\nInjury-dependence and rehabilitation axon sprouting experiments were assessed for significance using 2-way anovas with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc testing at 200 and 400\u03bcm (GraphPad). The axon sprouting time course was analyzed using Student\u2019s one tailed t-test for each time point at each 200 and 400\u03bcm. To determine if AAV-KLF6 plus rehabilitation training impacted behavior 3-way anovas (SPSS) were run for each the staircase and the modified ladder walking tasks."

    "Methods": "2.1. Creation and Genotyping of glut3\nflox/flox/Cre+\nMice\n2.1.1. Glut3\nflox/flox/Emx1-Cre+\n:\nGlut3\nflox/+\nmice were generated on C57BL/6 background by inserting LoxP sites into introns 5 and 6 (Mouse Biology Program, University of California, Davis). We crossed male glut3\nflox/+\nmice with female glut3\nflox/+\nmice generating glut3\nflox/flox\nmice as previously described (\nShin et al., 2018\n). For generation of glut3\nflox/flox/Cre+\nby Cre/loxP recombination, we next crossed glut3\nflox/flox\nmice with transgenic mice that expressed\nCre\nrecombinase under the regulation of an\nEmx1\npromoter, namely\nEmx1-Cre\nmice (B6.Cg-Tg[Emx1-cre]1Kln/J; Jackson Laboratory, USA), thereby creating\nglut3\nflox/+/Emx1-Cre+\nmice. Subsequently, mating male glut3\nflox/+/Emx1-Cre+\nmice with female glut3\nflox/+/Emx1-Cre+\nmice generated glut3\nflox/flox/Emx1-Cre+\nmice. Finally, female glut3\nflox/flox\nmice were crossed with male glut3\nflox/ flox /Emx1-Cre+\nmice, generating the glut3 conditional knockout (KO) mice designated as glut3\nflox/flox/Emx1-Cre+\n(homozygous KO). Since glut3\nflox/flox\nwithout\nCre\nin preliminary studies expressed a phenotype no different from the wild type (\nwt\n, glut3\n+/+\n) despite the introduction of\nloxP\nsites in two intronic regions, glut3\nflox/flox\nserved as the control (CON) genotype for our subsequent studies as previously described (\nShin et al., 2018\n).\n2.1.2. Genotyping of conditional glut3 deleted mouse lines:\nBy polymerase chain reaction (PCR) upon analysis of mouse tail DNA samples, the presence of glut3\nflox/flox\npresented as a 402bp DNA fragment which served as control without the presence of\nCre\n, while the absence of glut3\nflox/flox\n, namely wild type for the glut3 gene (glut3\n+/+\nwhich is not\nfloxed\n) produced a 233bp DNA fragment as previously described (\nShin et al., 2018\n). The presence of\nCre\nwas seen as an additional 554bp DNA fragment (\nEmx1\ncre), and when a homozygous (glut3\nflox/flox/Cre+\n) deletion (402 bp & 554 bp) occurred, this could be detected based on the presence of specifically sized DNA fragments observed upon genotyping of mouse lines.\n\n2.2. Body and brain weight:\nAdult body weight was measured at 12 months of age in glut3\nflox/flox/Emx1-Cre+\n(KO) versus glut3\nflox/flox\nmice which served as controls. Following euthanasia, brains were retrieved after craniotomy and total brain weights were measured in KO and CON groups.\n\n2.3. Blood Glucose Measurement:\nFollowing inhalational anesthesia with isoflurane, whole blood from 12-month-old mice was collected through puncture of the retro-orbital venous plexus and glucose concentrations were measured by the AlphaTRAK 2 glucometer (Zoetis, NJ).\n\n2.4. Brain Studies in glut3\nflox/fox/Emx1-Cre+\nmice\n2.4.1. Brain sample preparations:\nMice were deeply anesthetized under inhalational isoflurane (4% for induction, and 1.25% to 1.5% for maintenance), and brains (2 month and 10\u201312 month old) collected after craniotomy performed after intraperitoneal administration of sodium pentobarbital (50\u2013100 mg/kg). Brains were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for subsequent Western blot analysis as previously described (\nBaldauf et al., 2020\n;\nShin et al., 2018\n;\nZhao et al., 2010\n). In other cases, mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and embedded in OCT compound for immunohistochemical analysis as previously reported by us (\nBaldauf et al., 2020\n;\nGanguly et al., 2007\n;\nShin et al., 2018\n;\nZhao et al., 2010\n).\n2.4.2. Brain Protein Concentrations by Western Blot Analysis:\nBrain homogenates were subjected to Western blots as previously described (\nShin et al., 2018\n). The blotted membranes were sequentially incubated in primary antibodies consisting of the rabbit anti-GLUT3 (1/1000, from Takata, RRID:AB_2631293), synaptophysin (1/1000, Millipore, Cat# 04\u20131019, RRID:AB_1977519), \u03b2-tubulin (1/1000, Covance, Cat# MMS-435P, RRID:AB_2313773) and Map2 (1/1000, Neuromics, Cat# MO22116, RRID:AB_2737343) antibodies. The proteins were visualized using a Typhoon 9410 Phosphor imager (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) by blotting with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) plus detection kit (GE Healthcare BioSciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ) following horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-IgG (for anti-mouse, 1/7,000, Vector Cat# PI 2,000, RRID:AB_2336177; for anti-rabbit, 1/5,000, GE healthcare Cat# NA934, RRID:AB_772206) chosen based on the species in which primary antibodies (GE Healthcare Biosciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ) were raised. Each protein was quantified by using ImageQuant 5.2 software (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and normalized to vinculin (served as the internal loading control) as previously described (\nBaldauf et al., 2020\n;\nShin et al., 2018\n).\n2.4.3. Spatial Localization by Immunohistochemical Studies:\nSagittal brain sections (10 \u03bcm) and transverse placenta sections (10 \u03bcm) obtained by a cryostat (Leica RM2235; Leica Microsystems, Deerfield, IL) were subjected to immunofluorescence staining using rabbit anti-EMX1 (1/50, Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# PA5\u201335373, RRID:AB_2552683) as the primary antibody, followed by corresponding secondary antibodies carrying the fluorescence tag of Alexa 488 (1/500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs Cat# 711\u2013545-152, RRID:AB_2313584). DAPI was used for DNA staining, and sections subjected to microscopy as previously described (\nShin et al., 2018\n).\n2.4.4. Cortical Pyramidal Neuron Patch clamp study:\nCoronal brain slices (300 \u03bcm) from the rostral (motor) or caudal (somatosensory) cerebral cortices (2\u20133 month and 10\u201312 month old male mice) were maintained in oxygenated artificial CSF. Cortical pyramidal neurons (CPNs) in layer V were recorded in voltage-clamp mode as described previously (\nCummings et al., 2009\n). CPNs were identified by their typical triangular soma shape, the presence of a thick apical dendrite, and in some cases by addition of biocytin. First, basic membrane properties (cell capacitance, input resistance, and decay time constant) were determined using a depolarizing step voltage command (10 mV). The frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic (Vhold=\u221270 mV) and GABAergic (Vhold=+10 mV) synaptic currents was also estimated. After 3\u20135 min of baseline recording at \u221270 mV, the GABA\nA\nreceptor antagonist bicuculline (10 \u03bcM) was applied in the bath and kept for 10 more min before washout. This treatment increases cortical excitability and can induce epileptiform activity manifested by large inward currents. Data were analyzed using Clampfit 10.3 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California) and the number of paroxysmal events and their latency were determined. Spontaneous synaptic currents were analyzed using the Minianalysis program (Synaptosoft, version 6.0).\n\n2.5. Neurobehavioral studies\nTen to 12-month-old adult mice were subjected to the rotarod, open field, contextual fear conditioning, Morris water maze, sociability and social novelty testing after habituation and adequate training as previously subscribed (\nDai et al., 2017\n;\nShin et al., 2018\n;\nZhao et al., 2010\n).\n2.5.1. Accelerating rotarod test \u2013\nEvaluation of motor coordination and motor learning was achieved by performing the accelerating rotarod test (RotaRod3375\u20135, TSE system, Hamburg, Germany). The constant speed of 5 rpm was used at the first trial during the acquisition day. The rest of the four consecutive trials started at a beginning speed of 5 rpm but increased by 5 rpm after each 5 sec up to a maximum speed of 60 rpm. Data were collected after the test subject mouse either demonstrated falling from the rod or stayed for 300 sec at a maximum speed of 60 rpm.\n2.5.2. Open field test \u2013\nAssessment of anxiety, exploratory behavior and general locomotor activity was accomplished by placing each of the test mice individually in a square Plexiglas enclosure for 20 min. Their movements were recorded by video cameras and the different parameters measured which included total distance traveled in whole arena, percent of time spent in the center of the arena, average velocity and resting time, by the associated Topscan software (Clever Sys, Inc., Reston, VA).\n2.5.3. Fear Conditioning \u2013\nFor assessment of learning and memory about the associated environment with aversive experiences, contextual fear conditioning was performed. At acquisition trial, mice were placed in a chamber and received 0.75 mA electric foot shock 3 times within 5 min of contextual conditioning. Twenty-four hours after the training session, mice were returned to the same contextual environment and their freezing behavior was recorded with an associated video and software system in the absence of the associated shock (Med Associates Inc., Fairfax, VT).\n2.5.4. Morris water maze test \u2013\nThe invisible platform test was performed to investigate spatial learning and memory in mice. Before the first trial, mice were initially trained to find the escaping platform (12 cm diameter) set in a constant place in a water maze pool (1 m diameter, water temperature = 24\u00b0C), according to distal cues as achieved by placing the mice on the platform for 30 sec. They were returned to the platform if they jumped off 3 times and were subsequently placed in the pool to swim for 30 sec. First training trial began after a 2 min interval. Each mouse was released in the pool from different starting quadrants that did not contain the platform. They were allowed to swim until they found the platform or when 60s had elapsed. Subsequently they were allowed to stay on the platform or placed on the platform for 5 secs. Three trials were performed per day and these trials lasted for 5 days. The latency to find the platform was recorded for each trial. To monitor whether the mice had learned the platform location accurately or found the platform by chance, they were given a single platform trial after completion of the training trials by removing the platform and allowing them to swim for 60 secs in the pool from the same beginning location for each mouse. Finally, they were given 2 consecutive visible platform trials (made visible by locating a visible cue on the platform). Tracking information was processed by the Topscan software.\n2.5.5. Social Interaction \u2013\nAn interconnected three-chambered box was used for evaluation of memory of interaction in subject mice. Test included three phases: habituation (phase I), assessment of sociability (phase II) and social recognition (phase III) phases. At the habituation phase, the subject mouse was placed in the middle chamber and allowed to explore all chambers for 10 min. In phase II, after habituation of the subject mice for 10 min one day before testing, a novel mouse (sex-matched with subject mouse) was placed inside an upside-down wire cup in either the left or right chamber, and the other side contained an empty wire cup. The subject mouse was then returned to the middle chamber. Exploration activity and time spent with either the empty cup or the cup with novel mouse were recorded and scored by the Topscan software. In phase III a new and unfamiliar mouse was placed in the empty wire cup while the opposite side chamber of the apparatus contained the familiar mouse from phase II. Time spent within 10 minutes with the novel mouse versus the familiar mouse was compared.\n\n2.6. Statistical Analyses\nAll data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM. Student\u2019s t-test or Fisher\u2019s exact test was used when two groups were compared simultaneously. Student\u2019s t-test with Bonferroni\u2019s correction when indicated for multiple parameters being tested simultaneously or when indicated one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for more than two groups being compared simultaneously. When significant differences were identified, this was followed by the Fisher\u2019s PLSD post-hoc analysis to determine inter-group differences. Null hypothesis was rejected at a p<0.05. All Statistical analyses were performed using a GraphPad Prism 7 (RRID:SCR_002798)."

    "Methods": "iPSC cell culture.\nBJ (CRL-2522) fibroblasts from ATCC were reprogrammed to establish the BJFF.6 iPSC line using the non-integrating Sendai virus by Genome Engineering and iPSC Center (GEiC) at Washington University in St. Louis. iPSC cells were maintained on Matrigel (Corning) coated plates in Stem-Flex medium (ThermoFisher). Matrigel coating was performed by diluting the concentrated matrix in ice-cold DMEM/F12 medium, transferring the diluted solution to plates, and allowing the solution to coat the plates for at least 1h at RT. The human iPSCs were passaged by washing once with DPBS, followed by dissociation into small clumps using ReLeSR passaging solution (STEMCELL Technologies). The cells were collected and diluted (from 1:4 to 1:8) according to the initial density of the culture for passaging. iPSC cultures were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO\n2\n.\n\nGeneration of SARM1 knockout iPSC.\nThe human BJFF.6 iPSC cells were used to generate SARM1-deficient iPSCs using CRIPSR/Cas9 technology. The hPSCs were dissociated into single cells with 0.75X TrypLE-select reagent. Approximately 1 to 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n6\nhPSCs were washed in DPBS and resuspended in P3 primary buffer with 1 \u03bcg gRNA (5\u2019- AAACCAGGCGTTTCAGGCTC \u22123\u2019) expression construct (MLM3636 was a gift from Keith Joung; Addgene plasmid # 43860), 1.5 \u03bcg Cas9 vectors (p3s-Cas9HC was a gift from Jin-soo Kin; Addgene plasmid #43945) and 0.5 ug GFP expression construct and then electroporated using a 4D-Nucleofector (Lonza) using CA-137 program. Following nucleofection, cells were plated in a 6-well plate with warm medium supplemented with ROCKi for 24 hrs. The next day, the medium was replaced with fresh medium without ROCKi. After growth for 1\u20132 days, the nucleofected cells were sorted into 96-well plates with one cell per well as previously described\n25\n. Single cell clones were screened for SARM1 disruption via Cas9 editing using targeted NGS analysis\n26\n.\n\nSensory neuron differentiation.\nThe sensory neuron differentiation was performed as previously described with slight modifications\n24\nto improve differentiation efficiency. Human iPSCs were dissociated with 0.75X TrpLE-select, and 30,000 cells/well were seeded onto a Matrigel-coated 6-well plate in Stem-Flex medium supplemented with 1X RevitaCell (Thermo Fisher). The next day the medium was replaced with differentiation medium (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% KnockOut Serum Replacement (KOSR) (Thermo Fisher), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.3 \u03bcM LDN-193189, 2 \u03bcM A83\u201301, 6 \u03bcM CHIR99021, 2 \u03bcM RO4929097, 3 \u03bcM SU5402 and 0.3 \u03bcM Retinoic acid) for 10 days. It is critical to perform total medium change every 2 days. On day 10, the medium was switched to sensory neuron maturation medium [neurobasal plus medium supplemented with 1X B-27 plus, 10 ng/ml neurotrophin 3 (NT3), 20 ng/ml brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), 20 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF), and 20 ng/ml glial cell line-derived growth factor (GDNF)) with 2 \u03bcM 5-Fluoro-2\u2019-deoxyuridine (FdU)] for 5 days. On average, 2.5 million sensory neurons per well of 6-well plate could be expected on day 15. Continued culture in maturation process in maturation medium plus Culture One\nsupplement\n(Thermo Fisher) for additional 5 days (day 15\u201320 of the differentiation protocol). On day 28, matured sensory neurons were ready for experiments. For spot cultures, early differentiated neurons (day 15), are dissociated and pipetted into a small area and then cultured in maturation medium plus Culture One\nsupplement\nas above and continue the differentiation process for total 28 days.\n\nImmunofluorescence and immunoblotting assays.\nFor immunostaining, cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffer saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 mins at room temperature (RT), and treated with blocking buffer (PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 hour at RT. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Next day, the cells were rinsed with PBS three times and incubated with Alexa 488- or Alex 568-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher) for 1 hour at RT. Nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-Phenylindole (DAPI). Images of the stained cells were captured using the Nikon fluorescence microscope and CCD camera. Antibody against SARM1 (Cell Signaling Technology, D2M5I, cat# 13022) and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used for Western blotting.\n\nFlow cytometry.\niPSC-derived sensory neurons were dissociated and harvested at day 17 or 28 after initiation of neuronal differentiation using TrypLE-Select. Cyto-Fast Fix/Perm buffer set (BioLegened) was used for intracellular staining. The dissociated cells were fixed in Cyto-Fast Fix/Perm buffer for 20 min at RT, then washed twice with 1X Cyto-Fast Perm Wash solution. After washing, the cells were incubated with appropriate antibodies (10ng/\u03bcl) for 30 min at RT. Lastly, cells were washed and resuspended in cell staining buffer. Flow cytometry was performed using a Sony SH800S cell sorter and the data was analyzed using FlowJo software.\nAxotomy and vincristine induced axon degeneration.\nHuman iPSCs derived sensory neurons (15 days after initiation of differentiation protocol described above) were dissociated with TrypLE-Select for 3 min at 37 \u00b0C. The cell suspensions at a density of 1\u00d710\n7\ncells/ml were prepared in the maturation medium and 1.2 ul (96 well) or 10 ul (24 well) of cell suspension was placed in the middle of culture wells coated with Poly-D-Lysine (PDL) and laminin. After the neurons were attached, maturation medium was gently added and neurons were cultured for an additional 13 days to allow axonal extension. At 28 days after differentiation axons were injured either by transection with a microsurgical blade or by addition of vincristine. The imaging fields were predetermined in a unbiased manner and continuously imaged using an IncuCyte S3 (Sartorius) for 48 hours after axon injury."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experiments were conducted with adult male (initially ~350 grams) Sprague-Dawley rats (Envigo, Indianapolis IN, Colony 208A). Rats were housed in pairs in a controlled environment (12 hour light/dark cycles) with food and water\nad libitum\n. All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Florida Health Sciences Center. A total of 79 rats were studied, beginning at 11-12 weeks of age. Spinal intact and C2 hemisection (C2Hx) rats were randomly assigned to intermittent hypoxia exposure groups at 8 weeks post-injury (or equivalent time for uninjured rats), and exposed for 28 consecutive days to either: 1) normoxia (Nx28; n=8 intact, n=9 with C2Hx); 2) daily acute intermittent hypoxia (dAIH28, n=10 intact, n=8 with C2Hx), 3) mild chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH28-5/5, 8 hours per day; n=10 intact, n=12 with C2Hx) equivalent to an apnea/hypopnea index equivalent of ~6; and 3) moderate chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH28-2/2; n=10 intact, n=12 with C2Hx) equivalent to an apnea/hypopnea index equivalent of 15.

Rats were randomly assigned to groups: 1) spinal intact+Nx28 (n=8); 2) spinal intact+dAIH28 (n=10); 3) spinal intact+IH28-5/5 (n=10); 4) spinal intact+IH28-2/2 (n=10); 5) C2Hx+Nx28 (n=9); 6) C2Hx+dAIH28 (n=8); 7) C2Hx+IH28-5/5 (n=12); and 8) C2Hx+IH28-2/2 (n=12).\n\nPhrenic Motor Neuron Labeling\nAnesthesia was induced with 3.5% isoflurane (in 100% O\n2\n) in a plexiglass chamber, and then maintained at 2-2.5% isoflurane via nose cone. Adequate anesthetic depth was confirmed by the absence of toe pinch and palpebral responses. To retrogradely label phrenic motor neurons, rats received bilateral intrapleural injections of Cholera toxin B fragment (CtB; 0.2% w/v CtB; dissolved in sterile H\n2\nO; Calbiochem, Billerica, MA) at least 14 days prior to C2Hx (\nDale-Nagle et al., 2011\n;\nGuenther et al., 2010\n;\nMantilla et al., 2009\n). 25 \u03bcL of CtB was loaded into a 25 \u03bcL Hamilton syringe attached to a 9.5 mm sterile needle for bilateral injections (2 \u00d7 12.5 \u03bcL = 25\u03bcL total per animal) at the 5\nth\nintercostal space ~6 mm deep.\n\nC2Hx Injury\nAnesthesia, C2Hx, and animal care were performed as described previously (\nFuller et al., 2008\n;\nGonzalez-Rothi et al., 2015b\n). Rats were induced with 3.5% isoflurane (in 100% O\n2\n) in a chamber and then maintained (2-2.5% in O\n2\n) via nose cone throughout the surgery; adequate anesthetic depth was confirmed by the absence of toe pinch and palpebral responses. Body temperature was maintained at 36.5\u201337.5\u00b0C with a heating pad. Artificial tears were applied to prevent eye damage (Rugby, NDC 0536-1086-91). Toenails were clipped on all limbs. The surgical site was shaved and cleaned (chlorhexidine scrub, 58829-140-01, First Priority, Inc., Elgin, IL). C2Hx was performed by making a dorsal incision on the neck and dissecting muscle to expose the C2 lamina. Following C2 laminectomy and durotomy, the left spinal cord was hemisected with a micro-knife caudal to the C2 dorsal roots. A gap (~1 mm) at the injury site was created by aspiration. At this time, visualization of C2Hx showed anatomically complete lesions with the absence of white and gray matter from the left lateral edge to the spinal cord midline. The dura was closed with 9-0 ethilon nylon suture, the overlaying muscles were closed with 3-0 Polysorb absorbable suture and the skin was closed with 9 mm stainless steel wound clips. Post-operative care included pain management with an analgesic (buprenorphine, 0.03 mg/kg, s.q., Hospira, IL) and an anti-inflammatory drug (meloxicam, 2 mg/kg., s.q. Portland, ME) given at 12 and 24-hour intervals for 2 days post-surgery. Rats received lactated Ringer\u2019s solution (5 ml 2x/day, s.q.) and were manually fed a nutritional supplement (Diet Gel Boost; Clear H\n2\nO; Westbrook, ME) until adequate volitional drinking and eating were observed.\n\nIntermittent Hypoxia Protocols\nEight weeks post-C2Hx (or equivalent time point in uninjured rats), rats were housed in PlexiGlass exposure cages with free access to food and water (Therapeutiq, Kansas City, MO). IH protocols were administered to the cages daily for 28 days. Normoxia control rats received continuous air flow (21% O\n2\n, 8 hours per day;\nFigure 1B\n). Rats assigned to the dAIH28 groups received 10, 5 minute episodes of 10.5% O\n2\n, alternating with 5 minute normoxic intervals for ten episodes per day (~1.5 hours/day;\nFigure 1C\n). Rats assigned to IH28-5/5 groups received 5 minute episodes of 10.5% O\n2\n, alternating with 5 minute normoxic intervals for 8 hours/day (48 episodes per day;\nFigure 1D\n). Five minute hypoxic/normoxic intervals yield 6 hypoxic episodes per hour, somewhat equivalent to mild sleep apnea (5 to 10 events per hour) (\nAmerican Academy of Sleep MedicineAmerican and medicine, 1999\n;\nYoung et al., 2008\n). Rats assigned to IH28-2/2 received 2 minute episodes of 10.5% O\n2\n, with 2 minute normoxic intervals for 8 hours/day (120 hypoxic episodes per day;\nFigure 1E\n). This protocol consisting of 15 hypoxic episodes per hour is equivalent to clinical criteria for the transition to moderate sleep apnea (\nAmerican Academy of Sleep MedicineAmerican and medicine, 1999\n;\nYoung et al., 2008\n).\n\nTissue Harvesting & Histology\nOne day after their final exposure, rats were perfused intracardially with cold 0.1M phosphate buffer saline (PBS), followed by paraformaldehyde (4% paraformaldehyde w/v in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.4). The spinal cord was harvested and then: 1) post-fixed overnight in paraformaldehyde (4% in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.4); and 2) cryoprotected at 4\u00b0C in 20% sucrose solution in 0.1M PBS for 3 days followed by 30% sucrose solution in 0.1M PBS for 3 days.\nAlthough the C2Hx was visualized for completeness at the time of injury, we confirmed complete injuries via immunohistochemistry. Cervical spinal segments C1-C3 were embedded in paraffin, cut at 7 \u03bcm, mounted on positively charged slides (Fisherbrand, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), and allowed to dry overnight. Four sections per rat ranging from dorsal to ventral were stained with Luxol Fast Blue and cresyl violet. Sections were deparaffinized by heating at 60\u00b0C for 20 minutes and submerged 3 times in xylene for 5 minutes each. Sections were rehydrated by graded alcohol (100%-70%) for 2 minutes each and then stained overnight using Luxol Fast Blue (0.1 g Luxol Fast Blue in 100 mL of 95% ethanol and 0.5 mL 10% acetic acid). The following day, tissues were rinsed with 95% ethanol for 2 minutes and distilled water for 5 minutes. Differentiation was achieved by dipping the tissue in 0.5% lithium carbonate and 70% ethanol, then rehydrated by distilled water for 5 minutes. Tissues were placed in 0.1% cresyl violet for 15 minutes. Cresyl violet was rinsed by dipping tissue into distilled water twice. Tissue was then dehydrated through graded alcohol (70\u2013100%) for 1 minute each, cleared in Histoclear twice for 2 minutes each (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) and cover-slipped (Eukitt, Electron Microscope Science, PA). Injury sites were imaged using bright field at 10x zoom level (BZ-\u00d7710, Keyence Co., Osaka, Japan). Complete lateral C2Hx was verified by absence of tissue in all representative sections from midline to the lateral border (data not shown).\nCervical (C3-C5) and thoracic (T4-T6) spinal segments were transversely sectioned (40 \u03bcm thickness) using a freezing microtome (Leica SM 200R, Buffalo Grove, IL). Tissues were stored in antifreeze solution at \u221220\u00b0C until processed (30% glycerol, 30% ethylene glycol, 40% 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4). A total of 24 representative tissue sections from each rat were selected and stained for serotonin and CtB-labeled phrenic and intercostal motor neurons. Starting at C3 and ending at C5, 4 tissue sections from each cervical level were selected 12 sections apart (480 \u03bcm apart) for a total of 12 cervical sections per rat. Similarly, 4 tissue sections, 12 sections apart, were selected from each T4, T5, and T6, resulting in 12 representative thoracic sections per rats. These free-floating sections were washed with 0.1M PBS (pH 7.4), then incubated in heat induced epitope retrieval (TissuePro, cat#: HIER01-32R) for 30 minutes at 85\u00b0C. Tissues were washed again with 0.1M PBS-Triton (0.1%, pH 7.4) and then incubated in a blocking solution (5% normal donkey serum (NDS, GeneTex) in 0.1M PBS-Triton (0.1%, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 60 minutes. Primary antibody staining was performed by incubating tissue sections in 5% NDS in 0.1M PBS-Triton (0.1%, pH 7.4) with anti-5-HT (1/2000, rabbit serum, Immunostar #20080) and anti-CTB (1/2500, goat serum, Millipore #227040) in 4\u00b0C overnight. The following day, tissues were washed with 0.1M PBS-Triton (0.1%, pH 7.4). Secondary antibody staining was performed by incubating tissues in 5% NDS in 0.1M PBS-Triton (0.1%, pH 7.4) with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor\u00ae 594 (donkey anti-rabbit 594; 1:500, Invitrogen, Ref# A11055) and Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 (donkey anti-goat 488; 1;1000, Invitrogen, Ref# A21207) in a dark box at room temperature for 2 hours. Sections were washed with 0.1M PBS-Triton (0.1%, pH 7.4) and mounted on positively charged slides (Fisherbrand, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and allowed to dry overnight. Slides were cover slipped with VectaShield Antifade Hard Set Mounting Medium (Cat# H-1400). Fluorescently labeled sections were captured using an epifluorescent microscope with 20x magnification (Keyence BZ-X700, Keyence Corporation of America, Itasca, IL). Spinal cord sides were marked prior to tissue sectioning to ensure accurate side determination during imaging. Phrenic and intercostal motor neurons were determined by CtB-positive cell labeling within the ventral horn.\n\nSerotonin Image Acquisition\nAll immunofluorescently labeled tissue sections (transverse, 40 \u03bcm thickness) were imaged using an epifluorescent microscope with 20x magnification (Keyence BZ-X700, Keyence Corporation of America, Itasca, IL). At 20x magnification the aspect ratio of pixel per micron is 1:0.377. We optimized our acquisition parameters such that the background intensities are ~5% of the dynamic range with minimal (<0.1%) saturation for the positively labeled areas. All images were collected using the sectioning module with a 2D pinhole setting of 6, resulting in clear, high-resolution confocal-like images. No black balance or binning was performed. A Texas Red filter was used for 5-HT (OP-87765) and a GFP filter was used for CtB (OP-87763). Exposure times of 1/15 seconds for 5-HT and 1/5 seconds for CtB were used for imaging serotonin immunofluorescence around CtB labeled phrenic motor neurons in the cervical cord. Exposure times of 1/10 seconds for 5-HT and 1/3 seconds for CtB were used for imaging serotonin immunofluorescence around CtB labeled intercostal motor neurons in the thoracic cord. Regions for imaging were determined by CtB-positive cell labeling within the ventral horn, signifying phrenic/intercostal motor neurons. One image was taken on the left side (ipsilateral) and one on the right side (contralateral) resulting in 2 images per tissue section and 24 total images per animal (12 left, 12 right). Spinal cord side was marked prior to tissue sectioning to ensure accurate side determination during imaging. The exposure time for serotonin immunofluorescence near the cervical central commissure was 1/15 seconds. Imaging regions were determined by centering the central canal in the middle of the imaging field, resulting in 12 total images per animal.\n\nData Analysis\nSerotonin immunofluorescence:\nSerotonin immunofluorescence was quantified in each image using a custom MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) code. Local background intensities within each image were calculated using a running-window median filter and were subtracted from the raw pixel intensities to obtain the background-subtracted intensities. We performed our analyses on the background-subtracted intensities. Images were binarized using a custom adaptive threshold algorithm in MATLAB as previously described (\nAllen et al., 2019\n). The adaptive threshold was calculated by constructing a pixel intensity histogram from the image. The pixel intensity corresponding to the 99th percentile was selected as the threshold to account for animal-to-animal and image-to-image differences in signal and background intensities. The images were binarized using the automated algorithm to identify the serotonin-positive areas. Two investigators compared the identified serotonin structures with the original image to ensure the accuracy of identification. Automatically identified structures significantly matched investigator analysis. Injury (or intact) and intermittent hypoxia exposure protocol remained blinded throughout analyses. We observed serotonin-positive boutons and fibers; however, we cannot differentiate between serotonin boutons and fibers using our analysis. Thus, we call these \u201cserotonin structures\u201d. Independent serotonin structures were determined by being larger than 4 pixels and being at least 1 pixel apart. Using these parameters, we quantified the number of structures, area per structure, total area, and intensity per structure in 24 representative images. The results in the 12 cervical and 12 thoracic sections were then averaged for each rat. Quantified parameters are described below:\nNumber of structures:\nThe number of structures was determined using in the representative images from each tissue section. The total number of structures in each section was averaged to obtain the average number of immunolabeled structures per rat.\nArea per structure:\nThe area per structure was determined by the pixel size of each structure. The pixel numbers were multiplied by the aspect ratio of pixel per micron (pixel dimensions: 0.377 \u03bcm x 0.377 \u03bcm) to determine the area per structure using a representative image from each tissue section, and then averaged to obtain the average area of each immunolabeled structure per rat.\nTotal area:\nThe total area of serotonin-positive immunolabeling was calculated by multiplying the number of structures by the area per structure within a representative image from each tissue section and then averaged to obtain the average total area of serotonin immunolabeling per rat.\nIntensity per structure:\nThe fluorescent intensity in each immunolabeled structure was determined within a representative image from each tissue section and then averaged per rat to obtain the intensity of each structure. All intensity measurements were normalized to the maximum possible intensity (i.e. 65536).\nIdentification of phrenic motor neurons:\nWithin the cervical C3-C5 spinal sections, the custom MATLAB code first identified CtB-labelled phrenic motor neurons versus non-positive areas and assigned them binary values (CtB-positive=1, CtB-negative=0) to determine phrenic vs. non-phrenic areas. Then, the center of gravity of the CtB-labelled phrenic motor neurons was calculated. The final region of interest was defined by a circular area with a 50 \u03bcm radius centered at the center of gravity of CtB-positive phrenic motor neurons (\nSeven et al., 2018\n). The center of gravity equation was defined as:\nG\n\u2192\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n=\n\u2211\n(\np\ni\n\u00d7\nr\n\u0131\n\u2192\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n)\n\u2211\np\ni\nG: the center of gravity, p\ni\n: binary value of each pixel after thresholding (i.e. 0 for serotonin-negative or 1 for serotonin-positive), and r\ni\n(x, y): the coordinate of each pixel in the image. Center of gravity was calculated based on the distance from a standardized reference point (image origin) and binary values. One rat in the intact+Nx28 groups was excluded in the phrenic motor neuron analysis because there were no sections with CtB-labeled phrenic motor neurons.\nIdentification of serotonin immunolabeling in the central commissure:\nThe same cervical spinal tissue used to identify serotonin innervation around phrenic motor neurons was used to quantify the total area of serotonin positive pixels in the central commissures, including the dorsal and ventral commissures (lamina X). A point at the center of the central canal was selected and a circular region of interest was created with a radius of 100 \u03bcm.\nIdentification of intercostal motor neurons:\nWithin thoracic T4-T6 spinal segments, the MATLAB code first identified CtB-labelled intercostal motor neurons. Then, regions of interest were defined by a circular area with a 35 \u03bcm radius centered at the center of gravity of each CtB-positive intercostal motor neuron. If there were overlapping areas of interest within in a tissue section, serotonin positive pixels in the overlap were not counted twice. We report the raw values for serotonergic innervation of intercostal motor neurons, but we also normalized the number of serotonin structures and total area to the number of labeled intercostal motor neurons per section. Results of normalized serotonin immunolabeling around intercostal motor nuclei were consistent to the raw data, so only the raw data is presented (normalized data not shown).\n\nStatistics:\nAll computed values were first averaged within the image to obtain a value for the image. Then, image values were averaged for each animal, which was used for statistical calculations. Statistical calculations were performed using JMP 11.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Serotonin immunofluorescence data were first analyzed using a mixed model with repeated measures design. The independent variables were injury (intact vs. C2Hx), IH protocol (Nx28, dAIH28, IH28-5/5, and IH28-2/2), and spinal cord side relative to injury (ipsilateral vs. contralateral as the repeated measure).\nDue to the large number of comparisons within the mixed model, we were concerned that significance would be hidden within intact and C2Hx groups. To avoid type 2 statistical errors, the intact and C2Hx groups were analyzed separately. In the intact groups, we averaged the left and right sides of spinal cord and ran a one-way ANOVA with IH protocol as the independent variable (Nx28, dAIH28, IH28-5/5, and IH28-2/2). In C2Hx groups, we ran a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with IH protocol (Nx28, dAIH28, IH28-5/5, and IH28-2/2) and spinal cord side relative to injury (ipsilateral vs. contralateral as the repeated measure) as the independent variables.\nThus, we report significant interactions in all 3 analyses for each for each outcome measure of serotonin immunofluorescence within the phrenic and intercostal motor nuclei: 1) overall Mixed Model, 2) one-way ANOVA for intact groups, and 3) two-way repeated measures ANOVA for C2Hx groups.\nSerotonin immunofluorescence crossing the central commissure was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA. The independent variables were injury (intact vs. C2Hx) and protocol (Nx28 vs. dAIH28 vs. IH28-5/5 vs. IH28-2/2). A significance level of 0.05 was set for all statistical comparisons. When significant differences were observed, individual comparisons were made based on the Fisher Least Significance Difference\npost hoc\ntest. All data are displayed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean."

    "Methods": "Experimental Design.\nIn a rat model of complete thoracic SCI (T12), we investigated the effects of pharmacologically increasing KCC2 activity on spasticity and hyperreflexia and how this approach interacts with exercise. The KCC2 enhancer, CLP257, was used to increase KCC2 activity in chronic SCI rats, whereas control rats received saline. SCI animals were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: chronic spinal cord injured + CLP257 (SCI+CLP257), chronic spinal cord injured + saline (SCI), chronic spinal cord injured + bike-training + CLP257 (SCI+Ex+CLP257), and chronic spinal cord injured + bike-training + saline (SCI+Ex). Five weeks post injury, a terminal experiment was conducted in which either CLP257 or saline was administered, and signs of hyperreflexia were compared pre- and post-CLP257 or saline. Hyperreflexia and spasticity were assessed by examining: 1) the excitability of the plantar H-reflex and its modulation through rate-dependent depression (SCI+CLP257: n=10, SCI: n=8, SCI+Ex+CLP257: n=11, SCI+Ex: n=5), muscle forces and EMG activity in response to stretches to the triceps surae (SCI+CLP257: n=4, SCI: n=6, SCI+Ex+CLP257: n=3, SCI+Ex: n=4) and, where it was present, spontaneous motor unit activity in the lateral gastrocnemius (SCI+Ex+CLP257: n=5, SCI+Ex: n=4).

Briefly, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (1\u20134%) in O\n2\nand, under aseptic conditions, a laminectomy was performed at the T10\u2013T11 vertebral level. The dura was carefully slit open, the spinal cord completely severed with small scissors, and the cavity filled with absorbable hemostats (Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) to promote hemostasis. The completeness of the lesion was ensured by the distinctive retraction of the rostral and caudal spinal tissue and by examining the ventral floor of the spinal canal during surgery and was later confirmed post-mortem. Paravertebral muscles were sutured, and the skin closed with wound clips. Upon completion of the surgery, animals received a single injection of slow-release buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, s.c.), then saline (5ml, s.c.) and Baytril (15mg/kg, s.c.) were given daily for 7 days to prevent dehydration and infection, respectively. Bladders were expressed manually at least twice daily until the voiding reflex returned.\n\nExercise regimen.\nBeginning 4\u20135 days post-injury, exercised groups received 20 min of daily cycling (hereafter referred to as \u201cexercise\u201d), 5 days/week until completion of the study. No exercise was provided the day of the terminal experiment, so that the last exercise session took place >24h beforehand. Animals were secured in a support harness with the hindlimbs hanging and the feet fastened to pedals with surgical tape. The hindlimbs went through a complete range of motion during pedal rotation (45 rpm). Although the movement of the hindlimbs is passively generated by a custom-built motor-driven apparatus (\nHoule et al., 1999\n;\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2011\n;\n2014\n), this exercise protocol evokes rhythmic activity in both flexor and extensor muscles (\nBeverungen et al., 2019\n).\n\nDrug Preparation.\nThe KCC2 enhancer CLP257 (generous gift from Dr. Y. de Koninck, Universit\u00e9 Laval, Qc, Canada) was re-suspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as 100mM stock solution, then was freshly diluted to 100\u03bcM in saline immediately before administration. The KCC2 inhibitor VU0240551 (Cat# 3888, Tocris Bioscience, Minneapolis, MN) was prepared from a 50mM stock solution re-suspended in DMSO and diluted to 30\u03bcM in saline immediately before administration during the terminal experiment. Drugs were administered directly onto the exposed lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord, as described below.\n\nTerminal experiment.\nFive weeks post-injury, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (1\u20134%) in O\n2\nfor the terminal experiment. Body temperature was maintained ~37\u00b0C through a DC heating pad via a rectal probe. The lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord was exposed, and the dura carefully removed. Using skin flaps of the back, an agar bath was created, and a small window was made in the solidified agar above the exposed lumbar enlargement (\nGagnon et al., 2013\n) (\nFig. 1C\n). The agar bath was filled with saline for baseline recordings and refilled with 0.5mL of the CLP257 solution for post-drug testing (or saline for control). As the half-life of CLP257 is ~15 minutes and is known to take effect at this time point (\nGagnon et al., 2013\n), post-treatment recordings were collected 15 minutes after the application of CLP257/saline. The tibial nerve of the right hindlimb was dissected free and fitted with a cuff electrode for stimulation. The triceps surae (TS) muscles were isolated, the Achilles tendon severed distally, and tied to the lever of a servo-motor muscle puller (\nFig. 1A\n) (Aurora Scientific, Aurora, ON, Canada). Bipolar wire electrodes (Cooner Wire, Chatsworth, CA) were inserted into the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) to record EMG activity in response to stretches of the TS (\nFig. 1B\n), and into the interosseous muscle for H-reflex recordings (\nFig. 1D\n). Muscle Force, muscle length and EMG activity obtained during the experiment were amplified (100\u20131000x; A\u2013M Systems, Carlsborg, WA), band-pass filtered (10\u20135,000Hz) and the signal was digitized (10kHz) before being stored on a computer for analysis in Signal version 6 or Spike2 version 8 (Cambridge Electronic Design Limited, Cambridge, UK).\nFigure 1: Experimental Setup.\nOpen in a new tab\nA)\nA dual mode muscle lever is attached to the left Achilles tendon to stretch the isolated triceps surae at varying lengths and speeds. The resultant force is recorded throughout the experiment.\nB)\nBipolar electrodes are inserted into the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscle to measure EMG in response to physiological stretches.\nC)\nWindow cut into an agar bath just above exposed lumbar enlargement for drug application.\nD)\nThe H-reflex is evoked by a stimulation to the tibial nerve and recorded in the interosseous muscles of the right leg.\n\nH-Reflex.\nThe H-reflex was evoked in the interosseus muscles by stimulating the tibial nerve with an isolated pulse stimulator delivering single biphasic pulses (100\u03bcs, A\u2013M Systems). H-reflexes and M-waves were first recorded in response to a range of increasing stimulus intensities to determine the threshold for activation of the reflex (H-reflex threshold) and the motor response (MT). A recruitment curve was plotted by expressing the peak-to-peak amplitude of the H-reflex and M-wave responses as a function of stimulus intensity. The maximal amplitude of the H-reflex (H\nmax\n) and the amplitude of the response of all motor units with supra-maximal stimulation of the tibial nerve axons (M\nmax\n) were determined. Response latencies for the H-reflex and M-wave, the H\nmax\n/M\nmax\nand the H\nmax\n/M ratios were measured before and 15 minutes after treatment.\nThe rate-dependent depression (RDD) of the H-reflex was estimated as described previously (\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2014\n;\nBeverungen et al., 2019\n). Briefly, the stimulation intensity that evoked approximately 70% of the H\nmax\nresponse was used for a series of 20 consecutive stimulations at 0.3, 5 and 10Hz. The 0.3Hz series was then repeated to verify that the M-wave amplitude was still within 95% of the initial trial. The first five responses in a stimulation series were discarded to allow for reflex stabilization, and the peak-to-peak amplitude of the remaining 15 responses was averaged for each animal and frequency. The change in H-reflex response at 5Hz and 10Hz was calculated as a percentage of the response measured at 0.3Hz. The properties of the H-reflex and M-wave and the RDD were assessed before, and 15 minutes after application of CLP257 or saline onto the exposed spinal cord. All data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM).\n\nStretch-Induced Reflex and Muscle Force.\nThe ankle joint was held at 90\u00b0 flexion and the muscle was positioned to achieve a baseline tension of 0.3 Newtons (N), which corresponds to the muscle length of the animal with an intact Achilles tendon in this joint position (\nPingel et al. 2016\n). Passive and reflex-mediated forces in the triceps surae were assessed by using a protocol similar to those previously described in rodents (\nPingel et al., 2016\n) and humans (\nLorentzen et al., 2010\n;\nWillerslev-Olsen et al., 2013\n). Data were collected in length servo-mode, with computer driven TS muscle stretches evoked while monitoring TS muscle force and length, and EMG activity in LG. Two different ramp-hold-release stretches were applied to the TS muscle: a \u2018slow\u2019 stretch of 3mm with 150ms rising phase (20mm/s velocity) (\nFig. 4A\ni\n) and a \u2018fast\u2019 stretch of 3mm with 5ms rising phase (600mm/s) (\nFig. 4A\nii\n). The slow stretch had a hold phase of 500ms and a release phase of 150ms, while the fast stretch had a hold phase of 200ms and a release phase of 100ms. Force output from the TS muscle and EMG activity from the LG muscle were recorded in response to a series of 8\u201312 stretches repeated at 12s intervals. A second series of stretches was collected 15 minutes after application of CLP257, or saline for control animals. Response latencies were measured between the onset of stretch and onset of EMG response.\nFigure 4: CLP257 reduces reflex-mediated forces.\nOpen in a new tab\nA)\nExample force output of triceps surae and EMG activity in LG muscle in response to stretches. When a slow stretch (Ai) was applied, no EMG activity was present and no reflex was elicited. With a fast stretch (Aii) a stretch reflex was reliably evident in the EMG, and a small increase in reflex-mediated force was present. Depicted also in each stretch are the peak force and the plateau force.\nB\u2013C)\nWith slow stretches that elicited no reflex activity, CLP257 had no significant effect on either the plateau force (B) or the peak force (C).\nD)\nWith fast stretches that elicited reflex activity, the reflex-mediated force was significantly reduced by CLP257 (t(3) = 8.466, p =0.0035 n=4), but not by saline (t(5) = 0.8251, p =0.4469 n=6) in SCI animals. In exercised animals, the reflex-mediated force was not affected by either CLP257 (n=3) or by saline (n=4).\nE)\nIn animals displaying tonic EMG activity, the plateau force was significantly reduced by CLP257 (t(2) = 21.24, p = 0.0022, n=3) but not by saline (t(2) = 1.998, p = 0.1396, n=4). In animals without tonic EMG activity however, CLP257 had no significant effect on the plateau force, indicating that CLP257 only affects forces mediated by reflex activity.\nF)\nSimilarly, the peak force was unaffected by CLP257 in all groups. SCI n=6, SCI+CLP257 n=4. SCI+Ex n=4, SCI+Ex+CLP257 n=3. Analysis was conducted on responses averaged for each animal, represented by squares. Circles represent individual trials. All values are expressed as percentage of baseline values. **p<0.01 between groups. # p<0.05 compared to baseline.\nEMG recordings were analyzed in response to the \u2018fast\u2019 stretch (3mm amplitude, 5ms rising time) as this parameter reliably yielded the most discernable reflex responses. The signal was rectified and band-pass filtered 70Hz\u20132500Hz offline for analysis. Muscle stretch evoked a phasic EMG response in LG that was measured as the integrated area of a window from 0\u201315ms following the onset of the stretch. An additional tonic component, defined as EMG activity that persisted >15ms after stretch onset, was also quantified when present, using the integrated area from 15ms to the end of the hold phase of the stretch. EMG responses were averaged across 8 trials before and after CLP257 or saline.\nFor both slow and fast stretches, the peak force and the plateau force were determined. The peak force was measured using peak-to-peak amplitude, and the plateau force was determined as the integrated area of the force over the final 60% of the hold phase of the stretch, before release. Each were averaged across 8 trials both before and after drug or saline. The reflex-mediated force was also measured to confirm results of phasic EMG analysis. Approximately 30ms following the onset of the stretch, a clear increase in force is observed whenever a stretch reflex is present in the EMG (\nFig. 4A\nii\n). This additional force response, elicited by a stretch reflex contraction of the muscle, represents the reflex-mediated force (\nPingel et al., 2016\n). The reflex-mediated force was measured as the integrated area within a 60ms window beginning 20ms into the stretch (following the peak force) and preceding the plateau force (\nFig. 4A\nii\n). As with EMG recordings, this was solely analyzed for the stretch of 600mm/s velocity (3mm amplitude, 5ms rising time) as this stretch reliably yielded reflex responses.\n\nSpontaneous spiking recordings and analysis.\nIn some animals, EMG activity in LG muscle was recorded continuously and the effect of CLP257 (n=5) or saline (n=4) on spontaneous spiking activity was assessed. Using a template matching function (Spike2, CED), individual motor units were discriminated based on spike shape, amplitude, and width, and confirmed with visual inspection. Spike count was averaged for each motor unit over five-minute intervals before (baseline), and up to 20 minutes after application of CLP257 or saline. In two animals (12 firing motor units), CLP257 was then washed off the exposed lumbar enlargement 20 minutes following its application and was replaced with the KCC2 inhibitor VU0240551. The average spike count following application of VU0240551 was then measured to determine if the effects of CLP257 on spiking could be attributed to changes in KCC2 function. In addition to spiking frequency, the number of recruited motor units was also estimated. A motor unit was termed as \u201crecruited\u201d when the template matching software in Spike2 plotted a unit exclusively after application of terminal treatment. Care was taken to validate that each recruited unit was in fact separate from those that fired during baseline recordings.\n\nImmunofluorescent staining.\nRats were sacrificed using an overdose of Euthasol (390 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital and 50mg/kg phenytoin, i.p.) immediately following the terminal experiment, and perfused transcardially with cold saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The lumbar spinal cord (L1\u2013L6) was harvested, post-fixed overnight, and transferred to 30% sucrose in PBS for cryoprotection. Spinal cord tissue was then sectioned transversally (25\u03bcm) on a cryostat and mounted on slides for immunostaining. Sections were first pre-incubated in BSA (1%), donkey serum (10%) and 0.2% Triton x-100 OX in PBS for one hour at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with the following primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight: rabbit anti-KCC2 (1:1000, Cat#07\u2013432, Millipore, RRID: AB_310611) and goat anti-ChAT (1:100, Cat#AB144P, Millipore, RRID: AB_2079751). Species-specific secondary antibodies (1:1000, goat anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexafluor 488 for KCC2, and donkey anti-goat conjugated to rhodamine for ChAT; Jackson ImmunoResearch) were applied for 2h at room temperature, and the slides were cover-slipped before imaging. Spinal cord sections were imaged using a Leica DM550B fluorescent microscope and a Retiga-SRV digital color camera (QImaging) controlled by Slidebook imaging software version 6.0.11 (Olympus). Eighteen lumbar motoneurons were averaged per group (6 motoneurons for each animal, n=3 per group), and were identified with ChAT\n+\nlabeling, typical large size, and location within the ventral horn. The fluorescence intensity of KCC2 immunolabelling for the motoneuronal membrane was measured using ImageJ software and averaging the integrated area of the density curve obtained by drawing three lines across each motoneuron (yielding six data points per cell) (\nBoulenguez et al., 2010\n;\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2014\n;\nLiabeuf et al., 2017\n). To examine the amount of KCC2 expressed in the membrane compared to the cytosol, mean pixel intensities for membranes were normalized to intensities in the cytoplasm for each motoneuron (\nBoulenguez et al., 2010\n).\n\nStatistical Analysis.\nPaired t-tests were used to compare differences in H-reflex and M-wave maximum amplitudes, latencies, and threshold for activation, the H\nmax\n/M\nmax\nratio and the stimulation intensity required to evoke H\nmax\n(expressed at x MT). These were compared for each animal before and after receiving either CLP257 or Saline. Where data was not normally distributed, a Wilcoxon test was used. For RDD measurements, three-way mixed ANOVAs followed by Holm-Sidak\npost-hoc\ntests were used to determine significant differences in H-reflex amplitude across stimulation frequencies (5Hz and 10Hz, normalized to 0.3Hz; within-subject factor), treatments (CLP257/Saline; between subject factor) and condition (pre and post treatment; within-subject factor). This was done separately for SCI and SCI+Ex groups. To compare effects of CLP257 and exercise on the RDD in SCI animals, a two-way mixed ANOVA was run followed by Holm-Sidak\npost-hoc\ntest. Differences in H-reflex amplitude were compared across stimulation frequencies (5Hz and 10Hz, normalized to 0.3Hz; within-subject factor) and groups (un-exercised + CLP257 or exercised; between-subjects factor). Unless otherwise stated, values were normally distributed as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s test (\np\n> 0.05) and Normal Q-Q plot. There was homogeneity of variances, as assessed by Levene\u2019s test of homogeneity of variance (\np\n> 0.05). Mauchly\u2019s test of sphericity indicated that the assumption of sphericity was met (\np\n> 0.05). Where it was violated, a Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied.\nPhasic and tonic EMG responses, as well as peak, plateau and reflex-mediated forces following CLP257 or saline were averaged across 8 trials and normalized to the average baseline response (also averaged over 8 baseline trials) in each animal. Unpaired t-tests were then used to compare normalized post-drug/saline responses between CLP257 and saline treated animals. This was done separately for the SCI and SCI + Ex groups. Where data was not normally distributed, a Mann-Whitney test was used. One sample t-tests were used to compare normalized post-treatment values in each group to the normalized baseline value with a theoretical mean of 100%. Where data was not normally distributed, a Wilcoxon test was used.\nTo analyze the effect of CLP257 on spike count, we used a generalized linear mixed model with a negative binomial distribution to account for the data not being normally distributed. Fixed effects for time, treatment and their interaction were included. Using a stacked random effect for each motor unit and animal, the model controlled for inter-individual differences. The glmmTMB package (\nBrooks et al., 2017\n) for R 3.2 was used to fit the model and account for zero-inflation and overdispersion. Backwards elimination was used starting with the full factorial model for the random effect, zero inflation and dispersion terms. Effects were removed from the model if the likelihood-ratio test was not significant. The intercepts for the random effect and the zero-inflation remained in the model, along with the dispersion terms (time and treatment). Q-Q plots and histograms of Pearson\u2019s residuals were used to confirm negative binomial distribution of the residuals. Post-hoc comparisons using the Tukey\u2019s test were used to assess spike count following VU0240551 application compared to CLP257 application.\nFinally, unpaired t-tests were used to compare membrane-cytosol ratios of KCC2 immunolabelling between CLP257 and saline treated motoneurons. This was done separately for SCI and SCI + Ex groups. Where standard deviations were unequal, Welch\u2019s correction was applied."

    "Methods": "2.1. Cell culture and differentiation of hESC-derived neurons\nRC17 hESC cells (Roslin Cells, Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Edinburgh) were cultured in Essential 8 medium, supplemented with 2\u00a0mM\nl\n-Glutamine and 0.2% Penicillin Streptomycin (P/S, Gibco, Life Technologies) on Geltrex coated plates (150\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, Invitrogen) and passaged using EDTA (0.5\u00a0mM, Sigma-Aldrich) and used for differentiation towards neural cells of a telencephalic fate (\nKirkeby et al., 2012\n). On day (d)0, stem cells were detached and re-plated to a non-treated dish containing 14\u00a0ml neural induction medium (NIM: DMEM/F12: Neurobasal (50%\u00a0+\u00a050%), 1 x N2, 1\u00d7 B27, 2\u00a0mM\nl\n-Glutamine, 0.2% P/S, 10\u00a0\u03bcM Y-27632, 10\u00a0\u03bcM SB431542 (SB, R&D systems), 100\u00a0ng/ml noggin, 200\u00a0ng/ml C24II sonic hedgehog (shh, R&D systems) and 0.9\u00a0\u03bcM CHIR99021 (CH, Tocris Bioscience) and cultured on a rotating platform to allow embryonic body (EB) formation. On d4, the EBs were plated in neural proliferation medium (NPM: DMEM/F12: Neurobasal (50%\u00a0+\u00a050%), 0.5 x N2, 0.5 x B27, 2\u00a0mM\nl\n-Glutamine, 0.2% pen/strep, SB (10\u00a0\u03bcM), noggin (100\u00a0ng/ml), shh, CH) on Poly-ornithine (PO)(1:10000)/Laminin (lam)(5.2\u00a0\u03bcg/mL)/Fibronectin (FN) (4.35\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) coated well plates. On d7, the medium was replaced with fresh NPM medium, followed by plain NPM medium on d9. Next, on d11, the cells were replated. Firstly, the cells were washed twice with PBS and a minimal amount of accutase was added for 10\u00a0min to allow detachment of the cells. The cells were dissociated from the well plate using a pipette and spun down for 4\u00a0min at 0.3 rcf. The cells were resuspended to a density of 10.000 cells/\u03bcl in neural differentiation medium NDM (Neurobasal, 1 x B27 (1:50), 2\u00a0mM\nl\n-Glutamine, 0.2% pen/strep) and added in 7.5\u00a0\u03bcl droplets to dry PO/FN/lam coated \u03bc-slide 8 well plates (iBidi) and 10\u00a0\u03bcl droplets to 13\u00a0mm PO/FN/lam coated cover glasses or 6-well plates. Cells were kept in the incubator for 10\u00a0min to allow attachment of the cells. Next, NDM medium + BDNF (20\u00a0ng/ml)\u00a0+\u00a0GDNF (10\u00a0ng/ml)\u00a0+\u00a0AA (0.2\u00a0mM) was added to the wells. After 14\u00a0days, neuroprogenitor cells are created and medium was changed to NDM medium + BDNF (20\u00a0ng/ml)\u00a0+\u00a0GDNF (10\u00a0ng/ml)\u00a0+\u00a0ascorbid acid (0.2\u00a0mM)\u00a0+\u00a0db-cAMP (500\u00a0\u03bcM)\u00a0+\u00a0DAPT (1\u00a0\u03bcM) to induce terminal differentiation and maintained until the end of the experiment with the medium changed twice weekly\n.\n\n2.2. Laser-mediated axotomy\nLaser axotomy of hESC-derived neurons was performed as described previously (\nKoseki et al., 2017\n;\nNieuwenhuis et al., 2020\n). Neurons were axotomised between d40-d65 as stated in text. Except for co-culture with hOPC where transfection took place 10\u00a0days prior, neurons were transfected 2\u20133\u00a0days prior to axotomy, with eGFP containing plasmid using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The GFP signal was used to visualise single cells within the dense culture and to identify the axon. Only clearly polarised neurons with many dendrites and a single axon were used in the experiments. Axons were severed in vitro using a 365\u00a0nm laser (Micropoint, Andor) connected to an Andor spinning disk confocal microscope at >500\u00a0\u03bcm distal from the cell body on a section of axon free from branches. A single axon cut was made per neuron. Images (z-stack spanning 40\u00a0\u03bcm) after axotomy were acquired every 20\u00a0min for 16\u00a0h. Regeneration was classed as the development of a new growth cone followed by axon extension for a minimum of 50\u00a0\u03bcm.\nFor analysis of age-related decline in regeneration, we pooled data from previously published experiments (\nKoseki et al., 2017\n,\nNieuwenhuis et al., 2020\n) and added six additional datapoints from new experiments. A minimum of 10 cells was measured for each datapoint. Each hESC-neuronal conversion was used for two datapoints corresponding to a younger (<d50, typically around d45) and an aged (>d50, typically around d65) time point. This corrects for any potential differences between neuronal culture conversions.\n\n2.3. In vitro differentiation and co-culture of hESC-derived OPC\nA membrane bound GFP hESC line of RC17s was generated using zinc-finger recombinase. First, the palmitoylation sequence of GAP43 was used to tag GFP. This 60\u00a0bp sequence from the N-terminal of GAP43 is associated with its attachment to the membrane (see Supplemental Material 1&2 for plasmid map and sequence). The membrane-targeting GFP was then inserted at the AAVS1 locus. This was done using the pZDonor-AAVS1 Puromycin Vector Kit (Sigma) in conjunction with the CompoZr Targeted Integration Kit (Sigma) as per the manufacturer's instructions. GFP+ hESCs were cultured in StemMACS\u2122 iPS-Brew XF, human medium (Miltenyi Biotec Inc.) on human recombinant laminin-521 coated plates (5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, Biolamina) with puromycin (0.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Sigma). Cells were passaged using EDTA (0.5\u00a0mM, Sigma). hESCs were differentiated to oligodendroglia as described (\nLivesey et al., 2016\n). Briefly, once confluent, colonies were lifted using dispase (1\u00a0mg/ml Life Technologies) and collagenase (2\u00a0mg/ml,Life Technologies). Embryo bodies were cultured, on a rotatory shaker, in chemically defined medium composed of 50% Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) 50% F12 (Invitrogen), BSA (5\u00a0mg/ml, Sigma), 1% chemically defined Lipid 100 (Invitrogen), monothioglycerol (450\u00a0\u03bcM, Sigma), insulin (7\u00a0mg/ml, Roche), transferrin (15\u00a0mg/ml, Roche), 1% Antibiotic Antimycotic Solution (Sigma). Embryoid bodies were neuralized with dual-SMAD inhibition (\nChambers et al., 2009\n) by supplementing medium with\nN\n-acetyl cysteine (1\u00a0mM, Sigma), activin inhibitor SB 431542 (10\u00a0\u03bcM, Sigma), and dorsomorphin (2\u00a0\u03bcM, Merck Millipore) for 7\u00a0days. Neural spheres were caudalized for 7\u00a0days in chemically defined medium supplemented with heparin (5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, Sigma),\nN\n-acetyl cysteine (1\u00a0mM, Sigma), retinoic acid (0.1\u00a0\u03bcM, Sigma) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) (10\u00a0ng/ml, PeproTech). Neural conversion was assessed by the morphology of cells when plated on laminin-coated plates (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, L2020, Sigma). Neuralized spheres were picked and transferred to advanced DMEM (Invitrogen), containing 1% Antibiotic Antimycotic Solution, 1% B27 (Invitrogen), 1% N2 (Invitrogen), 0.5% GlutaMAX (Invitrogen) and heparin (5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). Neural spheres were ventralized by supplementing the media with FGF-2 (10\u00a0ng/ml, PeproTech), purmorphamine (1\u00a0\u03bcM, Calbiochem) and retinoic acid (1\u00a0\u03bcM) for 7\u00a0days. FGF2 was then withdrawn from this media for 2\u00a0weeks. Oligodendrocyte precursor proliferation was promoted by supplementing the media with FGF2 (10\u00a0ng/ml), PDGF\u03b1 (20\u00a0ng/ml, PeproTech), purmorphamine (1\u00a0\u03bcM), and SAG (1\u00a0\u03bcM, Calbiochem), IGF-1 (10\u00a0ng/ml, PeproTech) and T3 (60\u00a0ng/ml, Sigma). Spheres were dissociated after 2\u00a0weeks using the Worthington papain dissociation system as per the manufacturer's instructions and 30,000 cells were added to the neuron cultures.\n\n2.4. Visualization and identification of newly-synthesized proteins\n2.4.1. OPP tagging and fluorescent labelling for visualization\nNeurons were labelled in \u03bc-slide 8 well plates (ibiTreat surface Ibidi). First, the cells were pre-incubated for 30\u00a0min with NDM (neurobasal medium containing BDNF, GDNF and ascorbic acid) or NDM supplemented with protein synthesis inhibitors Anisomycin (100\u00a0\u03bcM) or cycloheximide (CHX) (40\u00a0\u03bcM) or with cell permeable G3BP1 190\u2013208 peptide (\nSahoo et al., 2018\n)\n.\nNext, the cells were incubated for 20\u00a0min with neurobasal medium containing the Click-iT OPP (20\u00a0\u03bcM) including the Anisomycin or CHX or medium only in the control group. CHX and OPP bind to the same site, so both Anisomycin and CHX were used to confirm that any reduction in OPP binding was due to a decrease in protein synthesis and not competition for a shared binding site. The cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 15\u00a0min at room temperature using 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. Afterwards, 0.5% TritonX-100 in PBS was added for 15\u00a0min to allow permeabilization of the cells. Next, the OPP tagged proteins were fluorescently labelled for visualization. The Click-iT Plus OPP Alexa Fluor 647 reaction cocktail was prepared according to manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Fisher). The cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with the OPP cocktail for 30\u00a0min, protected from light. The cells were rinsed using the Click-iT Reaction Rinse Buffer and incubated for 30\u00a0min with HCS NuclearMaskTM Blue Stain solution (1:2000 in PBS). Finally, the cells were washed twice with PBS and ready for immuno labelling\n.\n2.4.2. OPP tagging and biotin labelling for identification using mass spectometry\nFor biochemistry experiments, cell culture was scaled up to 6-well plates (with 100.000 cells per well) where maximum axonal outgrowth is achieved and mechanic dissection of cell body fraction from axonal fraction is possible. To identify proteins that are translated as a result of axonal injury, cultures were split in injury and control conditions. In the injury group, axons were severed at the proximal end using a scalpel under dissection microscope and returned to the incubator for two hours. To label protein synthesis, cells were incubated with OPP (O-propargyl-puromycin, alkyne analog of puromycin, 20\u00a0\u03bcM, Sigma) in NDM for two hours. Cells were then washed in ice cold PBS followed by stereotactic dissection to separately collect cell body clusters and remaining isolated axons. Axon and cell body fractions from 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06 well plates were pooled to obtain sufficient cellular fraction material for downstream application. The samples were centrifuged for 10\u00a0min at 9000 rcf at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The pellet was washed with 1\u00d7 PBS and centrifuged again for 10\u00a0min at 9000 rcf at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Pellets were snap-frozen and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C for further analysis. The pellets were lysed using RIPA buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail. The lysate was pre-cleared prior to biotin labelling by incubating with high capacity streptavidin agarose beads. Biotin labelling was done using the Click-iT\u2122 Protein Reaction Buffer Kit (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell lysates were incubated with biotin-azide (40\u00a0\u03bcM, Thermo Fisher) added to the reaction buffer, to enable the binding reaction to alkyne OPP present on newly synthesized proteins. OPP-biotin double-labelled proteins were precipitated, and the dried pellets were stored at \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C and shipped on dry ice for further processing. Upon protein clarification, the pulldown and trypsin digest were performed on a Kingfisher duo liquid handling station (Thermo). The lysate was incubated with 5\u00a0\u03bcl of Streptavidin Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 4\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C under mixing. Following incubation, the beads were washed 2\u00d7 with 0.3\u00a0ml of wash buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris-HCl 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% NP40) and 3\u00d7 with wash buffer without NP40. The beads were transferred into 100\u00a0\u03bcl of 2\u00a0M Urea, 50\u00a0mM TrisCl pH\u00a08, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg porcine Trypsin (Promega) and Trypsin and processed as previously described (\nTurriziani et al., 2014\n). Mass spectrometry was done using a Lumos Fusion (Thermo) mass spectrometer coupled to an RLS-nano uHPLC (Thermo). Peptides were separated by a 40-min linear gradient from 5 to 30% Acetonitrile, 0.05% Acetic acid separated on an Aurora column (Ionoptiks, Australia). The mass spectrometer was operated using the following setting: MS was set 120\u00a0k resolution in the Orbitrap, ions selected for fragmentation were isolated with a window of 1.1 Th, fragmented in the HCD trap with a normalized collision energy of 30 and read out in the ion trap using rapid scanning. Proteins were identified and quantified the MaxQuant software suite using label-free quantification and searching against the human Uniprot database.\n\n2.5. Immunocytochemistry\nCells were fixed for 15\u00a0min at room temperature using 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. Where protein synthesis labelling was performed, cells were first processed as described above and immunolabeling was performed on labelled cells. Following fixation or protein labelling, the cells were washed 3 times at room temperature. The cells were blocked by 2% normal donkey serum (NDS), 2% normal goat serum (NGS) and 0.2% triton-x for 30\u00a0min. Next, the primary antibody solution was added diluted in blocking buffer (see table). The cells were incubated overnight in the fridge. The next day, the cells were washed 3 times with PBS. The secondary antibody solution, consisting of blocking buffer, donkey/goat anti mouse 488 (Invitrogen, 1:500) and goat anti chicken 568 (Invitrogen, 1:500), was added for 30\u00a0min at room temperature. The cells were washed and embedded in Fluoromount-G, followed by microscopic imaging or storage in fridge protected from light. Images were collected using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with 63\u00d7 objective and 405, 488 (argon), 552 & 638\u00a0nm lasers.\n\n2.6. Microfluidic chambers\nCoverslips were acid washed in 1\u00a0N HCl overnight at room temperature (rotating), rinsed several times with sterile H\n2\nO and stored in 70% ethanol. Prior to use, the coverslips were washed with MQ water, air-dried, and coated overnight with polyornithine (0.01%, Sigma) in 37\u00a0\u00b0C incubator. The coated cover slips were washed with sterile H\n2\nO and air-dried. Microfluidic chambers with 450\u00a0\u03bcm grooves (RD450, Xona) were washed with 70% ethanol followed by sterile H\n2\nO. Non-plasma bonding was used to mount the chambers to the coated coverslips. Mounted devices were coated overnight with laminin (0.6\u00a0mg/ml) and fibronectin (0.5\u00a0mg/ml). Cell suspensions (50,000 cells) of d11 neurons (prepared according to described cell culture protocol) were plated in the proximal compartment and cultured in NDM medium.\n\n2.7. Image analysis\nFluorescent intensity of antibody staining and OPP labelling was quantified using confocal microscopy images collected as described above. After collection of the confocal z-stacks, the images were exported to FIJI. Output of the axon data was generated by a custom-made macro. Using this macro, a fixed threshold (which was determined for each batch of labelled cells and where each batch contained all experimental conditions and controls) was set to determine the areas positive and negative for axons (SMI312) and newly synthesized proteins (OPP). Cell body containing areas were removed from the images to prevent misidentification of the protein content in the axons due to a much higher amount of protein synthesis in the cell bodies. Next, the overlap between the OPP positive areas and SMI positive areas was determined for each frame in the z-stack and divided by the axonal area to correct for differences in axon density in the different frames. The means of these areas (overlap/area axons per frame) were compared between the different experimental conditions and controls. Similarly, the level of newly synthesized proteins in the cell bodies was determined by measuring the mean OPP intensity of the z-stack within the Hoechst-stained area. This avoids variability due to irregular cell body shapes. Significant differences between the two groups (d45 and d65) were tested using an independent\nt\n-test.\n\n2.8. Western blot\nCell pellets were lysed in 50\u00a0\u03bcl lysis buffer (RIPA buffer; Thermo Scientific, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail; Calbiochem). Concentration was measured with the Pierce BCA kit (ThermoFisher) and the Omega FluoSTAR microplate reader (BMG LabTech). For western blot analysis, 7.5\u00a0\u03bcg protein was used per slot. Cell lysates were denatured in 1\u00d7 NuPage LDS Sample Buffer buffer (Novex, Life Technologies) supplemented with 1:10 \u03b2-mercapto-ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by incubation for 5\u00a0min at 95\u00a0\u00b0C. Next, the cell lysates were separated on a gradient BioRad gel (7\u201312%) in 1\u00d7 Tris Glycine SDS (TGS) running buffer (BioRad). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) in transfer buffer (1\u00d7 NuPage transfer buffer (Novex, Life Technologies), 10% ethanol) at 160\u00a0mA for 1\u00a0h. Following a washing step in Tris-buffered Saline with 0.01% Tween-20 (TBS-T, Sigma- Aldrich), blots were blocked in 5% non-fat milk powder (Tesco) in TBS-T for 30\u00a0min. Subsequently, blots were incubated overnight (O/N) with primary antibody\n(see Table in Material and Methods)\nin TBS-T at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The next day, the blots were washed in TBS-T and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies anti-mouse (1:60,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch) or anti-rabbit (1:30,000, Thermo Scientific) for 1\u00a0h at RT. The sections were washed in TBS-T and antibody binding was visualized using ECL kit (Thermo Fisher) and a medical film processor (Konica Minolta Medical & Graphic). Films were digitised and then analysed with ImageJ Software. Background was subtracted and \u03b2-Actin bands were used as loading control.\nMaterial and methods; primary antibodies\nAntibody name\nManufacturer\nNumber\nSpecies\nPurified Map2 (PCK-554P)\nBioLegend\n822,501\nChicken\nNeurofilament marker, pan-axonal\nBiolegend\nSMI-312R\nMouse\nB3-Tubulin\nAbcam\nab7751\nMouse\nTyrosine Hydroxylase (TH)\nEMD Millipore\nAB152\nRabbit\nSortilin\nAbcam\nab16640\nRabbit\nEIF3b\nAtlas Antibodies\nHPA048983\nRabbit\nFibronectin (\nH\n\u2212300)\nSanta Cruz\nsc-9068\nRabbit\nMap2 (AP-20)\nAbcam\nab11268\nMouse\nRPL35\nAbcam\nab190162\nRabbit\nRPL26\nBethyl Laboratories\nA300-686A-M\nRabbit\nrRNA Y10b\nSanta Cruz\nsc-33,678\nMouse\nb-Actin\nMerck Millipore\nMAB1501\nMouse\nHuR\nMerck Millipore\n07\u2013468\nRabbit\nFMRP\nCell Signaling\n4317\u00a0s\nRabbit\nOlig2\nAtlas Antibodies\nHPA003254\nRabbit\nOpen in a new tab\n\n2.9. Mass spectrometry of axonal proteins at d45 and d65 in vitro\nTo compare the proteomes of axons grown by human ES cell-derived neurons after 45 and 65\u00a0days in vitro cultures in 6-well plates were used, enabling 100.000 cells to be plated into the centre of each well so as to allow radial axonal outgrowth towards the edge of the well. For sample collection, the wells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (1\u00d7 PBS, Life Technologies). Subsequently, 500\u00a0\u03bcl PBS was added. The cell bodies, forming a pellet in the middle of the well, were removed and collected using a dissection microscope (Olympos) and scalpel. Next, the remaining axons were collected in PBS by gently pipetting. Axons from 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06-well plates were pooled to obtain sufficient material for proteomic analysis. The samples were centrifuged for 10\u00a0min at 9000 rcf at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The pellet was washed with 1\u00d7 PBS and centrifuged again for 10\u00a0min at 9000 rcf at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Pellets were snap-frozen and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C for further analysis.\nFor liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), frozen cell and axon pellets were lysed in 50\u00a0\u03bcl lysis buffer (RIPA; Thermo Scientific +1:100 protease inhibitors) and protein concentration was measured. For each sample 50\u00a0\u03bcg of protein was used for LC-MS/MS. Proteins in urea sample buffer were loaded on a pulse gel for 5\u00a0min. The proteins were digested on gel O/N with trypsin. Once digested, the peptides were separated using reversed phase chromatography. Next, the samples were run in the Thermo Scientific QExactive Mass Spectrometer (\nMichalski et al., 2011\n). The peptides were identified with a human uniport database and MASCOTT. For quantification, Progenesis software was used. Proteins with less than 2 unique peptides were excluded from further analysis. Functional classification by gene ontology (GO) was performed in PANTHER, as described in (\nMi et al., 2013\n). Enriched biological processes were identified by comparing to the whole human genome PANTHER database."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals, surgical procedures, and DNP delivery\nAll procedures followed institutional and national guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals as approved by the University of Kentucky\u2019s Animal Care and Use Committee. Female C57/Bl6 mice of age 4- (n = 63; Jackson Laboratories) and 14-months old (MO) (n = 67; National Institute for Aging) received surgical laminectomy followed by a 60 kdyn T9 contusion SCI (Infinite Horizons Impactor) as previously described (\nZhang et al., 2016\n), or laminectomy only (n = 12). Mice of age 4- and 14-MO were chosen as the most phylogenetically comparable ages to represent the shift in clinical demographics from young adults to middle age at time of SCI (\nDutta and Sengupta, 2016\n;\nSemple et al., 2013\n). Further, a 60 kdyn injury was chosen empirically based on previous work demonstrating that a 50 kdyn injury is too mild to sustain detectable functional deficits in 4-MO mice, while a 75 kdyn injury is too severe in 14-MO mice, resulting in increased mortality and an inability to weight support during objective functional analysis. Mice were anesthetized using intraperitoneal (IP) injections of ketamine (100.0 mg/kg) and xylazine (10.0 mg/kg), and received analgesic (Buprenex SR, 1.0 mg/kg day of surgery), antibiotic (Enrofloxacin, 5.0 mg/kg for 5 days), and saline (1.0 mL/day for 5 days) support following surgery. All mice were group housed for the duration of the study on a 14 h light/10 h dark cycle. Manual bladder evacuations were performed 2\u00d7/day for the duration of the study.\nMice were randomly assigned to receive DNP (Sigma Aldrich CO. St. Louis, MO; 1.0-, 2.5-, or 5.0-mg/kg), or vehicle (1% dimethyl sulfoxide; DMSO), which were delivered\nvia\nintraperitoneal (IP) bolus injections (10 \u03bcL per g body weight) 30 min post-injury then daily for up-to 7 days. Stock 50.0 mg/mL concentrations of DNP were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in sterile phosphate buffered saline (0.01 M; PBS) immediately before use. Throughout the following three major experiments (1.\nEx vivo\nmitochondrial analyses, 2. 7-day survival, 3. 28-day survival) a total of n = 4 4-MO mice, and n = 9 14-MO mice were lost due to premature morbidity or mortality or surgical complications. Respectively for 4- and 14-MO mice, n = 1- and 2-mice died overnight after SCI; n = 2- and 5- mice died under anesthesia for unknown reasons; n = 1- and 1-mice were excluded based upon\na priori\nexclusion criteria for abnormal impact parameters indicative of a bone hit or spinal movement at the time of injury; and n = 0- and n = 1-mice were euthanized two days prior to the end of study due to a major open and untreatable skin wound; the spinal cord from this mouse was included in histology and did not vary from others in group. The cause of mortality remains unknown for the three mice that died overnight after receiving SCI. Two of the three mice received a 5.0-mg/kg dose of DNP, while the third received a 1.0-mg/kg dose, therefore toxicity from DNP may be possible. All other mice experiencing mortality under anesthesia died prior to delivery of DNP.\nSupplementary Table 1\ncontains lists of final sample sizes used for all groups in all outcomes.\n\n2.2. Ex vivo mitochondrial response to DNP\nMitochondria were isolated as previously described (\nBrown et al., 2004\n) from 4- and 14-MO sham, or SCI-treated mice at 3- and 7-days post-injury (dpi). Briefly, mice were euthanized using CO\n2\nfollowed by rapid decapitation. A 7-mm section of cord surrounding the lesion was quickly isolated and mechanically homogenized in respiration buffer. Tissue suspension was centrifuged at 1300\ng\nto pellet debris, followed by collecting the supernatant and pelleting crude mitochondria at 13,000 g. Crude mitochondrial extract was suspended in respiration buffer and synaptic mitochondrial fractions were liberated using nitrogen bombing. Crude mitochondria were standardized based on protein content and evaluated for oxygen consumption rate (OCR) on the Seahorse (Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer; Agilent Technologies, Inc.; Santa Carla, CA) as previously described (\nPatel et al., 2009\n). The sensitivity of mitochondria to uncoupling was performed using pre-loaded auto-injection ports to administer 1-, 10-, or 100-\u03bcM DNP in series and the change in OCR was obtained. Next, to perform a mitochondrial stress test, mitochondria were isolated from sham or vehicle-treated SCI-mice, as well as SCI-mice treated with 1.0 mg/kg DNP for 3- or 7-dpi. All mitochondrial experiments were initiated by treating wells with 5 mM Pyruvate, 2.5 mM Malate, and 1.0 mM ADP to drive State III respiration. Mitochondrial stress tests proceeded as previously described (\nSauerbeck et al., 2011\n), using sequential delivery of Pyruvate/Malate/ADP (State III), Oligomycin (State IV), FCCP (State V\nCI\n), and Rotenone/Succinate (State V\nCII\n) to test different respiratory states. Experiments were performed using 2\u20133 technical replicates per biological sample (n = 3/ group) depending upon auto-injecting success.\n\n2.3. Functional analysis\nPrior to SCI all mice were acclimated to testing paradigms including an open field for the Basso mouse scale (BMS; (\nBasso et al., 2006\n)) and the horizontal ladder (\nCummings et al., 2007\n). Functional abilities were assessed after SCI using the BMS at 1-, 3-, 7-, 14-, 21-, and 28-dpi. Horizontal ladder was tested prior to injury and at 28-dpi for animals capable of performing at least coordinated stepping. This resulted in exclusion of 2 vehicle-treated 14-MO mice from analysis for an inability to step. To analyze horizontal ladder, video was captured from underneath as mice traversed a small 1.0 m ladder containing evenly spaced rungs. Misplaced hindlimb steps resulting in foot-slips beyond the plane of rungs were analyzed from video acquisition. Two reviewers who were blinded to experimental groups were used to assign BMS scores and one reviewer counted foot-slips on the horizontal ladder.\n\n2.4. Histological outcomes\n2.4.1. Tissue preparation\nAt 7- and 28-dpi, vehicle and DNP-treated mice were anesthetized with a lethal dose of ketamine, exsanguinated using 0.1 M PBS, and perfused using 4% formaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Spinal cord segments were collected, post-fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 2 h at room temperature, incubated overnight in 0.2 M phosphate buffer, then dehydrated with 30% sucrose (Sigma Aldrich CO., St. Louis, MO) at 4 \u00b0C. Spinal cords were placed side by side in cryomolds in sets of 4\u20135 cords/block in Optimal Cutting Temperature Compound (OCT), and frozen on dry ice. Spinal cords were arranged in a random order while ensuring at least one cord per group was frozen in each block. Sections were cut in the transverse plane at a 10-\u03bcm thickness and mounted in serial order, with 100 \u03bcm between serial sections on a slide. Prior to immunolabeling all slides were processed using heat-mediated antigen retrieval in 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 80 \u00b0C for 5 min.\nEach set of immunolabeling, imaging, and analysis was performed for all animals in a single cohort, using identical staining, imaging acquisition, and analysis settings. Images were acquired using Zeiss Axioscan (model Z1, Carl Zeiss AG., Oberkochen, GE) and analyzed using Halo software (Indica Labs, Albuquerque, NM). Histology and immunohistochemistry was performed by individuals blind to group inclusion as follows.\n2.4.2. Tissue sparing and axon sprouting\nSlides were stained with eriochrome cyanine (EC; Sigma Aldrich CO., St. Louis, MO) for myelin and counterstained with fast red (nuclei) at 7-dpi, or immunolabeled for axons using neurofilament 200 kD (1:2500; NFH; Aves Labs Inc., Davis, CA) at 28-dpi. Immunolabeling was visualized using 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlington, CA) as a chromogen. To analyze lesion areas, regions of spared tissue were traced, and areas were obtained. Tissue was considered spared based on macro structure morphology, evident by the clearly stained presence of white matter, or gray matter containing neurons and organized axonal architecture; tissue sections at the lesion epicenter typically have no spared gray matter and only a small rim of spared white matter. Spared tissue was assessed in each section to identify the section containing the least amount of spared tissue, which was used to define the lesion epicenter. All histological analyses were performed with respect to this defined epicenter. Due to a dynamic nature of lesion volumes at 7-dpi, the epicenter was used as a single predictor of tissue sparing for purposes of identifying an optimal dose for behavioral studies. At 28-dpi tissue sparing was analyzed every 100 \u03bcm for 700 \u03bcm rostral and caudal to the lesion. Tissue sparing at the lesion epicenter was compared between groups, as well as total sparing throughout all measured sections.\nAxon sprouting was analyzed within the lesion at 28-dpi using a staining threshold to detect DAB labeled axon filaments. The average proportion of positive labeled pixels to lesion area was analyzed in 3 sections surrounding the epicenter per animal and used for comparison between groups.\n2.4.3. Reactive nitrogen species accumulation\nReactive nitrogen species (RNS) damage was assessed at 7-dpi using immunolabeling against 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT; 06-284; 1:2000; Sigma Aldrich CO., St. Louis, MO), as a measure of protein nitration (\nCarrico et al., 2010\n). To analyze 3-NT labeling, tissue sections up to 1-mm rostral and caudal to the epicenter were traced and a threshold was created to exclude non-positively labeled pixels from analysis. A threshold for determining positive pixel density was set based on tissue containing no 3-NT labeling from a 4-MO mouse section. No 3-NT labeling was performed at 28-dpi as increases in 3-NT have been reported to return to near-baseline conditions before 14-dpi (\nCarrico et al., 2010\n).\n2.4.4. Neuronal survival\nNeuronal sparing was assessed using immunolabeling against neuronal nuclei (NeuN; NBP1-77686; 1:4000; Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO). Neuron viability was determined by tracing around the ventral horns of tissue sections and applying a particle counting algorithm available on the Halo software. Parameters were set to identify neurons based on density, circularity, size, and contrast. Neuron counts from every other section between 500 \u03bcm rostral and caudal to the epicenter was summed and used to analyze 7-dpi tissue, and every section between 500 \u03bcm rostral and caudal to the epicenter was summed for 28-dpi tissue.\n\n2.5. Statistics\nStatistical modeling was performed in collaboration with University of Kentucky\u2019s interdepartmental Applied Statistics Laboratory (ASL). General linear models were created to determine the effects of age, dose, and injury when appropriate. When comparing between ages was appropriate two- or three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. This includes analysis of\nex vivo\nmitochondrial experiments, proportional area of 3-NT labeling, and horizontal ladder using two-way ANOVA, as well as analysis of motor functions on BMS and BMS sub-scores using three-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Because spinal cord size increases with age, outcomes dependent on absolute tissue area (sparing) and cell counts (neuron survival) were analyzed using within age-group comparisons with one-way ANOVA or two-way repeated measures ANOVA when appropriate. To directly compare outcomes between ages, values of DNP treated groups were normalized to mean values of within-age vehicle treated groups and treatment effects were compared between ages using two-way ANOVA. Dunnett\u2019s pair-wise comparisons were made to limit analysis within ages and between vehicle and DNP-treated groups. Sidak\u2019s pair-wise comparisons were used to compare between-group treatment effects when normalized to vehicle controls. During analysis of neuron counts at 7-dpi, a single outlier was found using Grubbs\u2019 analysis (value = 81; G = 1.737;\np\n< 0.05) in the 4-MO 5.0-mg/kg/day DNP treatment group and was removed from analysis. No other outliers were identified. Statistical support was obtained from ASL to analyze BMS and BMS sub-scores due to the non-normal repeated measures nature of BMS sub-score data. BMS score models adjusted for the Day 1 score and BMS sub-scores were normalized by using a square root transformation of the change from Day 3. BMS analyses were completed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All other analyses were completed using Prism v. 8.0 (Graphpad, San Diego, CA). Animal numbers for\nin vivo\nexperiments were estimated by power analyses (1-\u03b2 = 0.80; \u03b1 = 0.05; one-way ANOVA) using standard deviations from pilot studies, as well as estimated effects from prior experiments in our lab investigating effects of age on treatment efficacy using antioxidant therapies (\nZhang et al., 2019\n). For behavioral outcomes n = 10 was predicted sufficient to power BMS analyses, while n = 5 was estimated for histological tissue sparing. For\nex vivo\nmitochondrial experiments, routine use of n = 3 with 3 technical replications has proven sufficient power in prior experiments from our group (\nYonutas et al., 2015\n)."

    "Methods": "Animal care and ethics\nThis experiment was performed on 25 female CD1 mice (body weight: 25 g; Charles River Laboratories, Saint-Constant, QC, Canada). Animals arrived two weeks prior to testing to habituate to their environment, ambient temperature (26 \u00b0C) and cage mates (5 mice/cage). The laboratory staff provided the animals with a 12 \u2013 12h light-dark cycle and constant access to food and water. All handling and procedures were carried out in accordance with Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines. The protocol was approved by the UQTR Animal Care Committee and complies with guidelines from the Committee for Research and Ethical Issues of the International Association for the Study of Pain.\n\nSurgical procedures\nSurgical procedures were performed under anesthesia with isoflurane (2% mixed with medical O\n2\n, flow rate: 100 ml/min), preceded by the administration of the analgesic drug buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.) and followed by the administration of sterile saline solution (0.9 %, 1 ml, s.c.). Moreover, perioperative care initiated the day before surgery and terminated the day after surgery was provided by administering the anti-inflammatory drug carprofen (10 mg/kg, s.c., q.d.) and the analgesic drug buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg, s.c., p.r.n.). After surgery, hydration was closely monitored and bladders were manually expressed twice a day. Access to water was facilitated and a bolus of warm saline (1 ml, s.c.) was provided when required. Spinal transections were performed as described previously (\nLeblond et al., 2003\n). Adequate body temperature was maintained by placing the animal on a heating pad while anesthetized. The skin overlying the spine from T5 to T9 was shaved and incised. The paraspinal muscles were separated from the spine on each side. The spinal cord was approached posteriorly by performing a double laminectomy of T7 and T8 vertebrae and removing the posterior aspect of the vertebral arches. Then, lidocaine droplets were applied on the spinal cord to avoid secondary damage just before complete transection with micro-scissors. The dural sac was also completely transected, causing a retraction of the rostral and caudal stumps and a clear discontinuation of the spinal cord. Absorbable hemostats (Surgicel, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) was applied to fill the cavity to promote hemostasis. Muscular and cutaneous tissues were sutured back in layers, after which anesthesia was discontinued.\n\nExperimental interventions\nSpinally transected mice were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: untrained (n=6), trained (n=6), untrained with CFA (n=7) and trained with CFA (n=6). Trained mice and trained mice with CFA were provided with daily step-training (6 days/week) consisting of 10 min session of tail pinching-triggered locomotion on the treadmill. This step-training regimen was initiated on day 2 post-transection and terminated at the end of the experiment on day 28 post-transection. Untrained mice with CFA and trained mice with CFA were administered 4 boluses of CFA (Sigma F5881, 4X25 \u03bcl of 0.5 mg/ml heat-killed\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\ndiluted 1:1 in warm saline 0.9 %) in left and right lumbar muscles at L1 and L5 segments. These injections were performed on isoflurane anesthetized animals on day 4 post-transection to avoid interaction with the anti-inflammatory drug carprofen given perioperative. One centimetre of skin overlying the L1-L5 spine was incised and injections were performed directly in exposed lumbar muscles. Injecting needles were secured in place for 10 min to ensure proper CFA diffusion in the muscles. Thereafter, skin was sutured and anesthesia discontinued. This procedure has been shown to cause an inflammatory response that persists over a month (\nAmbalavanar et al., 2006\n).\n\nAssessment of locomotor recovery\nTreadmill locomotion (Exer-3/6, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA) with an implemented speed of 12 m/min was evaluated once before spinal transection (baseline) and once a week after (on day 2, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-transection). Locomotor evaluations of the spinally transected mice or step-training sessions were performed while animals were provided with 1) a platform overhanging the treadmill on which they can rest their forelimbs, 2) balance from tail holding by the experimenter and 3) tail pinching. The latter has been experimentally recognized as a non-invasive stimulation that allows stepping generation in animals transected as adults (\nMeisel and Rakerd, 1982\n) and used to study locomotor recovery after spinal transection by our group (\nJeffrey-Gauthier et al., 2018a\n;\nLeblond et al., 2003\n) and others (\nS\u0142awi\u0144ska et al., 2014\n). This amount was set individually for each animal to the lowest pressure that induced locomotion. Locomotor bout selection and analysis was performed by a second experimenter blind to the group affiliation of animals. The longest bout of consecutive stepping that mice could achieve in 5 min sessions was recorded by a high-speed camera (Proselica GC, Allied Vision Technologies, Irwin, PA, USA; 90 frames/s) facing the left side of the animal. Anatomical landmarks (iliac crest, great trochanter, knee, ankle, 5\nth\nMTP and 5\nth\ntoe) were marked and digitalized to XY coordinates to document angular motion of the hip, knee, ankle and MTP throughout the locomotor bout. Right and left paw contacts and lifts were detected. They were used to divide step cycles into stance and swing phase and to document phases duration and step length at each cycle. In the absence of clear paws lifts, swing and stance were identified as forward and backward paw movements, respectively. Dragging during swing was calculated as the proportion of the swing phase being achieved with the paw in contact with the treadmill belt. Coordination between hind limbs was assessed with the evaluation of the homologous coupling, i.e., the phase relation between left and right step cycles. Homologous coupling value was scored between 0 and 1 with 0.5 consisting of out-of-phase left and right step cycles. Homologous coupling constancy over locomotor bout was also scored between 0 and 1 with 1 consisting of a constant phase coupling throughout the recording.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and microscopy\nAnesthetized mice were perfused through the heart with PBS followed by paraformaldehyde (4 % in PBS). The perfused lumbar spinal cord was removed and immersed in sucrose (30 % in PBS) for cryoprotection. After 24 h, the spinal cord was removed from sucrose, put in OCT, then stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.\nFrozen perfused tissue samples were cut in transversal sections of 25 \u03bcm from L2-L4 with a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S, Leica Biosystems, Concord, ON, Canada) and disposed on two sets of microscope slides for each mouse. Immunofluorostaining was achieved directly on these slides. Sections were covered with PBS-based incubation buffer (5 % donkey serum, 3 % bovine serum albumin \u2013 BSA, 0.1 % Triton X) with 0.9 % lysine for 1 h at room temperature (RT) to suppress non-specific binding. Slides from set #1 were incubated overnight at RT in incubation buffer with rabbit anti-KCC2 antibody (1:100, Millipore Catalog No. ab07-432) and goat anti-ChAT antibody (1:50, Millipore Catalog No. AB144P). Slides from set #2 were incubated overnight at RT in incubation buffer with rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:1000, Wako Catalog No. 019\u201319741), a marker specifically found on microglia. On the next day, the slides were washed 3x10 min in PBS, incubated in a dark chamber at RT for 2 h with a FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:400, Jackson Laboratories Catalog No. 711-095-152) and rhodamine red-conjugated donkey anti-goat (1:400, Jackson Laboratories Catalog No. 705-295-003) antibodies for set #1 and AF647-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:400, Jackson Laboratories Catalog No. 711-605-152) for set #2. Then, the slides were washed 3x10 min in PBS, dipped in distilled water and dried at RT in a dark chamber. At the end, the slides were covered with DAPI fluoromount (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) and protected with a cover slip.\nFor KCC2 visualization on motoneurons, images were acquired at 40X using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP8, Leica Microsystems, Concord, ON, Canada). The motoneurons were identified as large choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-expressing cells in the ventral horn with a soma diameter greater than 20 \u03bcm. KCC2 expression measurement was achieved on every motoneuron for which the soma was clearly visualized. Signal intensity was averaged from 3 regions of interest (ROI) evenly distributed on the plasma membrane and normalized to the signal intensity in the cytosol. In motoneurons selection and measurement were performed using LAS X software by a blind experimenter. A minimum of 13 motoneurons was examined per animal. For KCC2 evaluation in the dorsal horn and Iba1 evaluation in both ventral and dorsal horns, images were acquired at 20X using a fluorescent photonic microscope (Olympus BX51WI, Olympus Lifescience, Richmond Hill, ON, Canada). ROIs for KCC2 mean signal intensity and Iba1 area fraction evaluation were determined based on the mouse spinal cord anatomy described in the Allen Mouse Spinal Cord Atlas (\u00a9 2018 Allen Institute for Brain Science. Allen Mouse Spinal Cord Atlas. Available from:\nmousespinal.brain-map.org\n) and measured using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) by a blind experimenter. A minimum of 3 sections were averaged per animal.\n\nData analysis and statistics\nAll results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. For locomotor recovery data, the parameter values were averaged over the locomotor bout for each time point post-injury. Statistical analyses were conducted with Statistica v13.3 (TIBCO Software, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The significance threshold was set at p\u22640.05. Differences in locomotor parameters (number of steps, angular motion of hind limb joints, step length, stance and swing duration, drag, homologous coupling value and homologous coupling constancy) were assessed with a mixed ANOVA, with one within-subject factor (number of days after transection, 5 levels) and two between-subject factors (CFA vs no CFA; training vs no training). Significant effects were decomposed with the Tukey HSD test. The effect of step-training and CFA on Iba1 area fraction and KCC2 signal intensity were assessed with a two-way ANOVA, with two between-subject factors (CFA vs no CFA; training vs no training)."

End-stage \u03947 SMA mice\nwere euthanized when functional death endpoints were reached (20% loss of body\nweight, inability to right within 30 seconds after placement in supine position,\nand/or visible distress).\nThe official name of the\nSmn\nnull allele\n(\nSmn\n\u2212\n) reported by\nSchrank\net al.\n(1997)\nand used here\non a congenic C57BL/6 background is\nFVB.Cg-Smn1\ntm1Msd\n(\nSchrank et al., 1997\n) (Jax stock no.\n006214). The official name of the\nSmn\n2B\nallele is\nB6.129(Cg)-Smn1\ntm1.1Cdid\n/J\n;\nit was used in these studies on a congenic C57BL/6 background (Jax stock no.\n34285). This allele was generated from the progenitor line\nSmn\n2B-Neo\n(\nB6.129-Smn1\ntm1Cdid\n) by removal\nof the flox-neo cassette (\nHammond et al.,\n2010\n). Mice expressing the\nTrp53\nnull allele\n(\nTrp53\n-\n) (\nJacks et al., 1994\n) or the\nP21\nnull\nallele (\nP21\n-\n) (\nDeng et al., 1995\n) on congenic C57BL/6J backgrounds\n(official names\nTrp53\ntm1Ty\nand\nCdkn1a\ntm1Led\n, respectively)\nwere obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Jax stock no. 002101 and 016565,\nrespectively) and bred to\nSmn\n2B/2B\nand\nSmn\n+/\u2212\nmice.\nSmn\n2B/+\n(control) and\nSmn\n2B\n/\u2212\n(SMA) mice\nexpressing\nTrp53\n+/+\n,\nTrp53\n+/\u2212\nor\nTrp53\n\u2212/\u2212\nwere generated by\ncrossing\nSmn\n+/\u2212\n;\nTrp53\n+/\u2212\nor\nSmn\n+/\u2212\n;\nTrp53\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice with\nSmn\n2B/2B\n;\nTrp53\n+/\u2212\nor\nSmn\n2B/2B\n;\nTrp53\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice. Similarly,\nSmn\n2B/+\nand\nSmn\n2B\n/\u2212\nmice expressing\nP21\n+/+\n,\nP21\n+/\u2212\nor\nP21\n\u2212/\u2212\nwere generated by breeding\nSmn\n+/\u2212\n;\nP21\n+/\u2212\nor\nSmn\n+/\u2212\n;\nP21\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice with\nSmn\n2B/2B\n;\nP21\n+/+\n,\nSmn\n2B/2B\n;\nP21\n+/\u2212\n, or\nSmn\n2B/2B\n;\nP21\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice. At weaning,\nSmn\n2B\n/\u2212\nmice were weaned\nwith at least one\nSmn\n2B/+\nlittermate (if available) and received moist chow three times weekly to assist\nwith food and water intake. Both male and female mice were included in\nexperiments. However, more male mice homozygous for the\nTrp53\nnull allele were included compared to females of the same genotype, due to sex\nratio distortion arising from embryonic-lethal developmental defects common to\nfemale\nTrp53\nnull mice (\nHu et\nal., 2008\n).\n\nGenotyping\nDNA extracted from mouse tail biopsies was genotyped using multiplex\nPCR. Genotyping the\nSmn\nnull allele and\nSmn\n2B\nallele was done as\npreviously described (\nGogliotti et al.,\n2012\n;\nSchrank et al., 1997\n).\nThe\nTrp53\nnull allele was genotyped using a common primer\n(5\u2019-TGG ATG GTG GTA TAC TCA GAG C), a mutant forward primer\n(5\u2019-CAG CCT CTG TTC CAC ATA CAC T), and a wild type forward primer\n(5\u2019-AGG CTT AGA GGT GCA AGC TG). The product sizes of the wild type and\nknockout alleles were 321 bp and ~110 bp, respectively. The\nP21\nnull allele was genotyped using a common forward primer\n(5\u2019-GTT GTC CTC GCC CTC ATC TA), a wild type reverse primer\n(5\u2019-GCC TAT GTT GGG AAA CCA GA), and a mutant reverse primer\n(5\u2019-CTG TCC ATC TGC ACG AGA CTA). The sizes of the wild type and knockout\namplicons were 240 bp and 447 bp, respectively. The cycling conditions for PCR\ngenotyping of both\nTrp53\nand\nP21\nnull alleles\nwere: 94\u00b0C/30 s, 63\u00b0C/45 s, 72\u00b0C/45 s, 35 cycles.\n\nAssessment of\nSmn\n2B\n/\u2212\nmouse weight and survival\nSmn\n2B\n/\u2212\nmice were\nmonitored daily for survival and weight. Functional death was defined as the\ninability to right within one minute of placement in a supine position. If\nfunctional death endpoint was reached, that day was noted as the date of death\nin survival analysis. Mice that died perinatally, or from a cage flood, or were\nunexpectedly missing from the cage, were excluded from survival analyses. In the\nevent of cage flooding, weight measurements obtained the same day and one day\nafter the event were eliminated from weight analysis. Crossing the\nTrp53\nor\nP21\nnull allele onto the\nSmn\n2B\n/\u2212\nline frequently\nproduced runts (both in control and SMA mice). Runts were identified as mice\nweighing less than either 1.9 g at P5 or 3.5 g by P10. These thresholds were\nselected because they are greater than two standard deviations below the\nhistorical mean body weight of\nSmn\n2B\n/\u2212\nmice at P5 and\nP10, respectively. All runts, except those so severely runted that death\noccurred prior to postnatal day P6, were included in survival and weight\nanalyses.\n\nWestern blotting\nTissues were dissected and snap frozen on dry ice or liquid nitrogen.\nTotal protein was extracted from homogenized tissues using RIPA buffer\nsupplemented with Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific, cat. #\n87786), resolved by 10% or 4\u201312% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels using MOPS\nor MES running buffer, and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes\nfor western blotting. Ponceau S was applied to visualize total transferred\nprotein levels then the membranes were blocked overnight at 4 \u00b0C in\nOdyssey\n\u00ae\nBlocking Buffer in PBS (LI-COR, cat.\n#927\u201340000). Membranes were probed with primary antibodies for either two\nhours (Smn, \u03b2-tubulin) or overnight at 4 \u00b0C (p53, p21,\n\u03b2-actin, \u03b2-tubulin) followed by corresponding secondary antibody\nincubations for one hour at room temperature. Detection was performed using the\nLI-COR Odyssey Imaging System. Densitometric quantification was performed using\nImageJ software. Details for primary and secondary antibodies utilized in these\nstudies were as follows: p53 immunoblots used 40 \u03bcg/sample, rabbit\nanti-p53 antibody (1:1000, Leica Novacastra, cat. #NCL-L-p53-CM5p), rabbit\nanti-\u03b2-actin antibody (1:1000, LI-COR, cat. #926\u201342210) and goat\nanti-rabbit IgG IRDye\n\u00ae\n680RD antibody (1:5000, LI-COR, cat.\n#926\u201368071); Smn immunoblots used 22 \u03bcg/sample, mouse anti-Smn\nantibody (1:2500, BD Biosciences, cat. #610646), goat anti-mouse IgG\nIRDye\n\u00ae\n800CW antibody (1:5000, LI-COR, cat.\n#926\u201332210), rabbit anti-\u03b2-tubulin antibody (1:5000, Cell\nSignaling, cat. #2128), and goat anti-rabbit IgG IRDye\n\u00ae\n680RD\nantibody (1:5000, LI-COR, cat. #926\u201368071); p21 immunoblots used\n48\u201350 \u03bcg/sample, mouse anti-p21 antibody (1:1000, Santa Cruz, cat.\n# sc-6246), goat anti-mouse IgG IRDye\n\u00ae\n800CW antibody (1:5000,\nLI-COR, cat. #926\u201332210) and either rabbit anti-\u03b2-tubulin or\n\u03b2-actin antibody with corresponding secondary antibody as noted above.\nSpecificities of p53 and p21 antibodies were confirmed using protein lysates\nobtained from\nTrp53\nand\nP21\nnull tissues.\nPositive control lysates for p53 and p21 that were included on immunoblots were\ngenerated from GL26-luc cells treated for 12\u201324 hours with 1 \u03bcM\ndoxorubicin.\n\nRNA preparation and qRT-PCR analysis\nAnimals were euthanized and tissues dissected at varying time points.\nTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and an RNeasy Mini kit\n(Qiagen, cat. #74106) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA\nconcentration was determined using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo\nScientific) and sample integrity was confirmed by resolution of 28S and 18S rRNA\nbands in a 2:1 ratio, respectively, by agarose gel electrophoresis. Samples were\ntreated for DNA contamination using Turbo DNase treatment (Invitrogen, #AM1907)\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and cDNA was prepared from\nRNA using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Life Technologies\n#4368814). qRT-PCR reactions were performed with an ABI Quant Studio 3\nthermocycler using TaqMan assays and fast master mix (Life Technologies, cat.\n#4352042) in a 20 \u03bcl volume. Each assay was performed at least in\nduplicate and biological replicates for each group analyzed ranged from\nN=3\u20134 samples. Samples with C\nq\nvalues >35 cycles were\nconsidered as having no detectable expression. Data was analyzed using the\n\u0394\u0394CT method. TaqMan primer/probe assays used in this study were:\nGapdh (4352339E), Actin (4352341E), Trp53 (Mm01731290_g1), Cdkn1a\n(Mm04205640_g1), Fas (Mm01204974_m1), Pmaip1 (Mm00451763_m1), Fasl\n(Mm00438864_m1).\n\nElectrophysiological studies\nElectrophysiological measurements were recorded from mice at ages\nP12-P18. These included controls and\nSmn\n2B\n/\u2212\nmice that\nwere wild type, heterozygous or homozygous null for either\nTrp53\nor\nP21\n.\nTrp53\ngroups were studied at P12, P14, and P17\u201318 and\nP21\ngroups were studied at P14. Compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and motor\nunit number estimation (MUNE) were measured using a portable electrodiagnostic\nsystem (Synergy EMG machine; Natus Neurology, Middleton, WI) as previously\ndescribed in detail (\nArnold et al., 2014\n;\nQuinlan et al., 2019\n). In brief,\ninsulated monopolar needles were inserted into the proximal hindlimb to provide\nsciatic nerve stimulation. Ring electrodes were positioned over the proximal\ntriceps surae muscle to record CMAP amplitude; a reference electrode was placed\nover the metatarsals. A disposable strip electrode (CareFusion, Middleton, WI)\nwas placed on the tail (or contralateral limb) to serve as the ground electrode.\nThe sciatic nerve was stimulated with single square-wave pulses of 0.1-ms\nduration. Supramaximal responses were generated maintaining stimulus currents\n< 10 mA; baseline-to-peak and peak-to-peak CMAP amplitude measurements\nwere obtained.\nMUNE was measured using an incremental stimulation technique. Average\nsingle motor unit potential (SMUP) amplitude was calculated from 10 incremental\nresponses obtained using submaximal stimulation. The first increment (the\nminimal all-or-none SMUP response) was evoked by delivering 1-Hz square-wave\nstimulations at an intensity between 0.21 and 0.70 mA. Stimulation intensity was\nadjusted in 0.03-mA steps to obtain subsequent incremental responses;\nincremental responses were distinguished visually in real time to obtain nine\nadditional increments. To be accepted, each increment was required to be: 1)\nobserved for a total of three duplicate responses; 2) visually distinct from the\nprior response; and 3) at least 25 \u03bcV greater than the prior response.\nThe peak-to-peak amplitude of each individual incremental response was\ncalculated by subtracting the amplitude of the prior response. Average\npeak-to-peak SMUP amplitude was defined as the mean peak-to-peak amplitude of\nthe 10 incremental values. Maximum CMAP amplitude (peak-to-peak) was divided by\naverage peak-to-peak SMUP amplitude to yield the estimated number of motor units\n(MUNE).\n\nSpinal cord immunostaining\nSpinal cord immunofluorescence experiments utilized P16\nSmn\n2B/+\nand\nSmn\n2B/\n\u2212\nmouse cohorts.\nAfter euthanasia, spinal cords were exposed by dorsal laminectomy and spinal\ncolumns were isolated. Spinal columns were fixed overnight at 4 \u00b0C in 2%\nparaformaldehyde, rinsed in PBS, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose (in PBS).\nSpinal cords were freed from underlying spinal columns by blunt dissection,\nembedded in OCT, and rapidly frozen in dry ice-chilled isopentane. Serial\ntransverse sections from T13-S1 were cut at 12 \u03bcm thickness. To avoid\nrepeat counts, every 15\nth\nsection was used for analysis. Following\nantigen retrieval, sections were blocked for one hour in 5% donkey serum, 0.5%\nTriton X-100, and 0.5% glycine (in PBS). Primary antibody incubation was done\novernight at 4 \u00b0C with goat anti-ChAT antibody (1:100, Millipore, cat.\n#AB144P) and rabbit anti-p53 antibody (1:1000, Leica Novacastra, cat. #\nNCL-L-p53-CM5p). Secondary antibody incubations were performed sequentially\n(each for three hours) at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 594 donkey\nanti-rabbit antibody (1:250, Life Technologies, cat. # A-11055) then Alexa Fluor\n488 donkey anti-goat antibody (1:250, Life Technologies, cat.# A-11029). Nuclei\nwere stained with DAPI. Sections were coverslipped using\nProLong\n\u2122\nDiamond Antifade Mountant (Life Technologies,\ncat. #\nP36970\n) or Aqua-Mount (Lerner Laboratories, cat. #13800). Images were\nacquired at 5x and 10x using a Leica DMR-HC upright microscope; composite images\nwere stitched using Image Composite Editor (Microsoft). Spinal cord sections\nfrom end-stage (P12-P15) \u03947 SMA mice treated in the same manner as above\nwere included as positive controls for p53 immunostaining.\n\nMuscle weights and myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA) distributions\nQuad, calf, and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were dissected from\nhindlimbs of P18 control (genotypes:\nSmn\n2B/+\n;\nP21\n+/+\nand\nSmn\n2B/+\n;\nP21\n\u2212/\u2212\n),\nSmn\n2B\n/\u2212\n;\nP21\n+/+\nand\nSmn\n2B\n/\u2212\n;\nP21\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice and weighed using an\nanalytical balance. Muscle weights were normalized to body weight. Unless only\none dissected muscle was intact, the left and right quad, calf, and TA\nnormalized muscle weights were averaged for analysis. Muscles were fixed\novernight in 2% paraformaldehyde at 4 \u00b0C, rinsed in PBS, and\ncryoprotected in 30% sucrose (in PBS). TA muscles from\nSmn\n2B/+\n;\nP21\n+/+\n,\nSmn\n2B\n/\u2212\n;\nP21\n+/+\nand\nSmn\n2B\n/\u2212\n;\nP21\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice were dabbed dry,\nembedded in OCT, and frozen on dry ice. Serial transverse sections from muscle\nmid-belly were collected at 12 \u03bcm thickness. Sections were rehydrated in\nPBS and blocked for 30 minutes in 5% goat serum, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.5%\nglycine (in PBS). Primary antibody incubation was performed overnight at 4\n\u00b0C with rabbit anti-dystrophin antibody (1:250, Abcam, cat. # ab15277).\nAfter washing, sections were incubated for two hours at room temperature in\nsecondary antibody solution with Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit antibody\n(1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. # 111-545-145). Nuclei were labeled with\nDAPI then slides were coverslipped using ProLong\n\u2122\nDiamond\nAntifade Mountant (Life Technologies, cat. #\nP36970\n). Images were acquired at\n20x and 40x with a Leica DM2500 upright microscope and stitched using Image\nComposite Editor (Microsoft). TA myofiber CSAs were measured automatically\n(minimum detection threshold: 10 \u03bcm\n2\n) using ImageJ (NIH) with\nminor manual editing. Myofibers that prominently deviated from\nen\nface\norientation, or were damaged or rolled, were excluded from\nanalysis.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism V.8.0\n(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Survival data was represented with\nKaplan-Meier survival curves and statistically significant differences between\ngroups were evaluated using log-rank tests. Weight curves were analyzed by\nmixed-model two-way ANOVA (with Tukey\u2019s tests for main column effects).\nFor all other analyses, unpaired t-tests (with Welch\u2019s correction, in the\nevent of unequal variances) ordinary one-way ANOVA (with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc\ntests), Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA tests (with Dunnett\u2019s T3 multiple\ncomparisons tests) in the event of unequal variances, Kruskal-Wallis one-way\nANOVA tests (with Dunn\u2019s post-hoc tests) in the event of nonparametric\ndistributions, or two-way ANOVA (with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc tests) were\nperformed as needed.\nP\n-values <0.05 were considered\nstatistically significant."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nTrkB.T1 knockout and TrkB.T1-V5 mice have been described previously (\nDorsey et al. 2006\n;\nFulgenzi et al. 2020\n). SOD1G93A [B6SJL-TG (SOD1*G93A)1GUR/J; 002726], GFAP-Cre [B6.Cg-Tg(GFAP-cre) 73.12Mvs/J; 012886] and HB9-Cre [B6.129S1-Mnx1tm4(cre)Tmj/J; 006600] transgenic mice were acquired from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were backcrossed on C57/B16J background for at least 10 generations before performing genetic experiments. SOD1-TrkB.T1 KO (SOD1 T1) were described earlier (\nQuarta et al. 2018\n;\nYanpallewar et al. 2012\n), whereas astrocyte-specific (GFAP cre-SOD1T1 CKO GFAP) or motor neuron-specific (HB9 cre- SOD1T1 CKO HB9) knockout of TrkB.T1 receptor in SOD1 G93A mutant mice were generated by crossing the conditional allele of TrkB.T1 (\nDorsey et al. 2006\n) with the specific cre-Tg mouse and the SOD1 G93A allele. Conditional GFAP cre- SOD1T1 CKO and HB9 cre- SOD1T1 CKO mice were obtained by introducing a conditional (CKO) and a constitutive TrkB.T1 KO allele together with the cre transgene into the SOD1 mutant background to increase the efficiency of the cell-type specific recombination in astrocytes or motoneurons, respectively. This strategy greatly enhances the cell-type specific recombination since only one conditional allele has to undergo recombination. All procedures for mouse experiments were approved by the NCI-Frederick Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) and followed the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for animal care and use.\n\n2.2. Motor neuron survival and immunostaining\nTwelve-week-old mice were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 1xPBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The lumbar spinal cord was isolated and 50-\u03bcm transverse sections were cut on a cryostat. Every 10th section (18\u201320 sections/animal) was collected for Nissl staining to analyze the number of surviving motor neurons (\nYanpallewar et al. 2012\n). For immunostaining analysis, 5 sections/animal were first incubated with the primary antibody followed by the specific fluorescent conjugated secondary antibody. The following antibodies were used: Rabbit anti-GFAP (1:500, Dako), Rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:250, Wako), Rabbit anti-V5 mAb (1:200 Cell Signaling Technology), Rabbit anti-iNOS (1:500 BD Transduction Laboratories) and Rabbit anti-nitrotyrosine (1:500, Millipore). For comparison of GFAP and Iba1 immunoreactivities, immunofluorescence images were obtained under constant setting on a confocal microscope and differences in florescent signal intensities between the genotypes were analyzed quantitatively using NIH Image J software.\n\n2.3. Measurement of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 by ELISA\nLumbar spinal cords were homogenized in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (Sigma) supplemented with protease (Sigma, USA) and phosphatase inhibitor (Roche, USA) cocktails. After centrifugation, protein concentration in supernatants was measured with the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, USA). Samples from 12 week and end-stage groups containing equal amounts of protein were then used for measuring the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 (LSBio, USA, mouse ELISA Kit) and IL-1\u03b2 (R&D System mouse IL-1\u03b2 ELISA Kit) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For the end-stage group, spinal cord lysates from 24-week old WT mice were used as the control group. Levels of cytokines are expressed as pg/ml and mean values were compared between genotypes.\n\n2.4. Western blot analysis\nImmunoblotting was performed on lysates from lumbar spinal cords dissected from WT, SOD1 and SOD1T1 KO mice at 12 weeks of age. Samples were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer (Millipore, USA) with a protease (Sigma, USA) and phosphatase (Roche, USA) inhibitor cocktail. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA protein estimation kit (Thermo Scientific, USA). Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes (Life Technologies, USA) that were then blocked in 5% BSA in TBST. Primary antibodies were: Rabbit monoclonal anti TNF-R1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling); mouse monoclonal anti-VEGF (1:1000, SantaCruz) and Rabbit anti-nitrotyrosine antibody (1:500, Millipore). Membranes were then incubated with the specific HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and the signal generated by the ECL reagent (GE Healthcare) was detected with a Syngene Bio-Imaging System. \u03b2-actin served as a loading control using Anti-\u03b2-actin HRP (1:5000, SantaCruz).\n\n2.5. Evaluation of motor performance\nMuscle strength and coordination were assessed by an accelerating rota-rod (Ugo Basile, Italy) that rotates from 4 to 40 RPM over 5 min as previously described (\nYanpallewar et al. 2012\n). After two training trials of 5 min each (at 11 weeks) animals were run three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 12 weeks on) and the duration for which the animal stayed on the rota-rod without falling (up to a maximum of 300 s) was recorded (\nYanpallewar et al. 2012\n)."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nBrain tissue used in this study was from nine aged female rhesus monkeys used in\nMoore et al., 2019\n. The monkeys ranged in age from 16 to 26 years old (analogous to humans approximately 48 to 78 years old, Tigges et al. 1988,\nSupplementary Table 1\n). Monkeys were acquired from a private vendor (World Wide Primates, Inc.) and were maintained in the Animal Science Center of Boston University Medical Campus (fully AAALAC accredited). Experiments were approved by the Boston University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. During the study, aged monkeys were individually housed within visual and auditory range of other monkeys in the colony room. Enrichment procedures used either met or exceeded USDA requirements. Aged monkeys were fed once a day, immediately following testing, and water was available continuously. Diet consisted of a commercial monkey chow that was supplemented with fruits and vegetables. Before entering the study, monkeys were assessed for pre-existing abnormalities in overall health. As detailed in\nMoore et al. (2019)\n, monkeys were trained on a fine motor task then randomly assigned to a vehicle control or EV treatment before receiving a cortical injury targeted to the hand representation of the primary motor cortex (M1). Following injury, they were given intravenous vehicle control (PBS) or EV treatment (4 x 10\n11\nparticles/kg) at 24 hours after surgery and again at 14 days after surgery. All staff were blinded to the treatment groups for all procedures and experiments.\n\nMesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicle Preparation and Administration\nEVs were isolated from bone marrow derived MSCs of a young monkey, as described previously (\nXin et al., 2013\n;\nMoore et al., 2019\n). Briefly, a young monkey (approximately 5 years old - equivalent to 15 human years) was sedated with ketamine (10 mg/kg IM), then anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (15-25 mg/kg IV). Bone marrow was extracted from the iliac crest and shipped on wet ice, with same day delivery to Henry Ford Health Systems in Detroit. Upon arrival, marrow was spun at 4000 x\ng\nfor 15 minutes to separate cells. The buffy coat was discarded, and remaining cells were washed in culture medium. Cells were then plated in a T75 flask using media containing 20% FBS and alpha-MEM, grown to confluence, and passaged as necessary. To grow enough cells for EVs, 10 x 10\n6\ncells were seeded into a Quantum Incubator (Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO) and grown in alpha-MEM with 10% EV-depleted FBS (Systems Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). To harvest EVs, media was collected every other day for four days, then every day for two days. As described in Zhang et al. (2017), media was centrifuged in multiple stages at 250 x\ng\nfor 5 minutes, then 3,000 x\ng\nfor 30 minutes, then filtered and centrifuged a final time for 100,000 x\ng\nfor 2 hours to pellet EVs. The pellet was resuspended in a small volume of PBS. EV concentrations and particle sizes were measured using a qNano (Izon, Cambridge, MA, United States), then diluted to 4 x 10\n11\nparticles/kg for each monkey in 4mL of PBS. EVs had an average diameter of 111 nm in size (\nSupplementary Figure 1\n), and had confirmed expression of CD9, CD81, and CD63 by western blot, per MISEV guidelines (data not shown) (\nWitwer et al., 2017\n). The dose was chosen based on previous dosing studies conducted in rats (\nXin et al., 2013\n;\nZhang et al., 2015\n). Following resuspension, EVs were stored at 4\u00b0 C until the day before treatment, then shipped to Boston University the day prior to intravenous administration in monkeys.\n\nMotor Testing and Lesion of the M1 Hand Representation\nTo assess motor function, monkeys were trained on the Hand Dexterity Task (HDT) for five weeks, a modified version of the Kl\u00fcver board, as described in (\nMoore et al., 2012\n,\n2013\n,\n2019\n). After pre-training, the dominant hand was determined using free choice trials. To create an injury in the hand representation of M1, a craniotomy was performed over the contralateral hemisphere of the dominant hand. The dura was opened, and the precentral gyrus was electrophysiologically mapped using a small silver ball surface electrode to locate the precise area of M1 that controlled hand and digit function. Using this map, a small incision was made in pia above the hand representation, and a small glass suction pipette was placed under the pia to bluntly separate penetrating arterioles from the underlying cortex in the mapped area as well as through the adjacent anterior bank of the central sulcus. This approach disrupts the blood supply to the underlying cortex without mechanically damaging the underlying grey matter. After injury, monkeys were given two weeks to recover then monkeys resumed fine motor testing for 12 weeks to assess the rate and extent of recovery of fine motor function on the HDT, with and without EV treatment.\n\nCerebrospinal Fluid Extraction\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was drawn at multiple time points across the recovery period (Baseline (Pre-operation), 14 days after injury, 28 days after injury, 6 weeks after injury, and at euthanasia 14 weeks after injury) to assess Myelin Basic Protein. Briefly, monkeys were sedated with Ketamine (10 mg/kg IM), CSF was drawn from the cisterna magna, immediately placed in 4\u00b0 C for temporary storage (< 2 hours), then frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C until processed.\n\nBrain Tissue Section Preparation and Storage\nFollowing completion of motor testing (\nMoore et al., 2012\n,\n2013\n,\n2019\n) monkeys were sedated with ketamine (10 mg/kg IM) and anesthetized with intravenous sodium pentobarbital (25 mg/kg IV to effect). While under a surgical level of anesthesia, the chest was opened and monkeys were euthanized by exsanguination during transcardial perfusion-fixation of the brain, first with cold Krebs-Heinsleit buffer (4\u00b0C, pH 7.4) during which fresh tissue biopsies were collected, after which the perfusate was switched to 4% paraformaldehyde (30 \u00b0C, pH 7.4) to fix the brain. Fresh tissue was immediately snap frozen in pulverized dry ice, then stored at \u221280\u00b0C until processed. The fixed brains were blocked,\nin situ\n, in the coronal plane, removed from the skull, and cryoprotected in a solution of 0.1 M phosphate buffer, 10% glycerol, and 2% DMSO followed by buffer with 2% DMSO and 20% glycerol. Brains were then flash frozen at \u221275\u00b0C in isopentane and stored at \u221280\u00b0C (Rosene et al, 1986). For histological analyses, brains were removed from the \u221280\u00b0C storage and cut on a microtome in the coronal plane into interrupted series (8 series of 30 \u03bcm sections, and one 60 \u03bcm section series) giving a 300\u03bcm spacing between sections in each series. If not processed immediately, sections were transferred to cryoprotectant (15% glycerol in buffer) and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C until thawed for immunohistochemistry.\n\nRegions of Interest\nSections containing the lesion were first identified in a series of thionin stained coronal sections from each monkey based on the presence of tissue damage in the hand area of primary motor cortex, indicated by glial scarring, disrupted neuronal profiles, and discontinuity of the pial surface and cortical lamination, as described previously (\nOrczykowski et al., 2018\n). Within the range of sections containing the lesion, a subset of sections spaced 2400 \u03bcm apart was selected for further analysis with defined the regions of interest (ROI) which included the sublesional white matter (SW) - delineated as the white matter just beneath the gray matter lesion. Coronal sections from adjacent series were matched to thionin-stained sections containing the lesion and selected for immunofluorescent labeling of markers (\nFig. 1F\n). To illustrate the typical distribution of oligodendrocytes in a normal, aged brain, images from the white matter from the contralateral primary cortex were scanned and were denoted as \u201ccontrol\u201d panels, as shown in\nFigures 2\n,\n4\n, and\n5\n.\nFigure 1: Spectral Confocal Reflectance (SCoRe) Microscopy demonstrates increased densities of myelinated axons in the EV group as well as more defined fiber orientations.\nOpen in a new tab\nA) Regions of interest for Spectral Confocal Reflectance Microscopy were aligned beneath the lesion, adjacent to the junction of Layer VI.

E&F) Assessment of the directionality and orientation of the myelinated axons revealed different distributions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p = 0.04) between Vehicle (E) and EVs (F). Directionality analyses demonstrated fibers in vehicle treated brains had a relatively uniform orientation, confirming the appearance in (B). In contrast, (F) shows axons in the EV group (C) with a bimodal distribution of axon orientation, indicating a more linear, grid-like organization. Scale bar = 50.\nFigure 2: Densities of oligodendrocytes (Olig2) colocalized with 8OHdG, a marker of oxidative DNA damage, show reduced oxidative damage to oligodendrocytes in EV-treated monkeys.\nOpen in a new tab\nTissue sections stained with Olig2, 8OHdG, and DAPI counterstaining were imaged with confocal microscopy in the sublesional white matter.

E) Cell density analysis of Olig2+ oligodendrocytes, co-labeled with 8OHdG (DNA damage marker) revealed reduced densities of oligodendrocytes with DNA-damage in the EV-treated animals (p = 0.014).

Scale bar = 50 microns.\nFigure 4: Oligodendrocyte precursor cell densities are not significantly different between groups.\nOpen in a new tab\nA\n1\n, B\n1\n, and C\n1\n) Confocal images of oligodendrocyte precursor cells marked by NG2.

D) There were significantly more CC1+ cell densities (p = 0.004) in the EV animals. E) The combined densities of all BCAS1+ cells were not different between treatment groups (p = 0.12). F-I) The BCAS1+ cells were further stratified into the various stages of maturation (BCAS1+/CC1\u2212, BCAS1++/CC1\u2212, BCAS1++/CC1+, BCAS1+/CC1+). Within these subpopulations, we found F) no statistically significant differences between groups in the BCAS1+/CC1\u2212 cells (p = 0.67). G) We found greater densities of BCAS1++/CC1\u2212 cells (p = 0.03) and H) BCAS1++/CC1+ cells (p = 0.01) in the EV group. I) However, the densities of BCAS1+/CC1+ cells were not different between groups (p = 0.12).\n\nFluorescent Immunohistochemistry of Oligodendroglial Markers\nThree tissue sections through the lesion spaced 2400 \u03bcm apart (selected based on the thionin series) were removed from \u221280\u00b0C, thawed, and batch processed with immunohistochemistry to assess oligodendroglial markers. Sections were washed with PBS, blocked using Superblock (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), then incubated overnight at RT with primary antibodies (single, double, or triple-labeled) to rabbit anti-BCAS1 (marker of newly myelinating oligodendrocytes, Abcam, ab106661,\nFard et al. 2017\n), mouse anti-CC1 (marker of mature oligodendrocytes, Abcam, ab16794), rabbit anti-Olig2 (marker of all oligodendrocyte lineage, Abcam, ab42453), mouse anti-8OHdG (marker of oxidative DNA damage, Abcam, ab62623), and rabbit anti-NG2 (marker of Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells, Abcam, ab129051) in a PBS solution containing 0.5% Superblock and 0.3% Triton-X (\nSupplementary Table 2\n). Following an overnight incubation, tissue was washed, then incubated in the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse at 1:200,\nSupplementary Table 2\n) in a PBS solution containing 0.5% Superblock and 0.3% Triton-X. Tissue was washed again, then counterstained with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 30 minutes RT. Sections were then placed in cupric sulfate for 15 minutes at RT to reduce autofluorescence (\nSchnell et al., 1999\n) and rinsed briefly in dH\n2\nO. Finally, sections were mounted, air-dried for 30 minutes, coverslipped in DABCO mounting medium (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until ready to be imaged.\n\nConfocal Imaging of Oligodendroglial Cells\nFluorescently labeled oligodendroglia were imaged with a Leica TCS SPE laser scanning confocal microscope, using UV, 488 and 561 diode lasers. To ensure proper blinding, slides were blinded by assigning codes prior to imaging. For each section, 12 images were taken through the SW, spaced 500 \u03bcm apart. Each site was imaged through the z-stack using a 40x 1.3 N.A. oil objective lens at a resolution of 0.135 x 0.135 x 1.0\u03bcm per voxel. Confocal Z-stack images were deconvolved, and converted to 8-bit images using AutoQuant (Media Cybernetics) to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, as described (\nMedalla and Luebke, 2015\n).\n\nSpectral Confocal Reflectance Microscopy Imaging\nSpectral Confocal Reflectance (SCoRe) Microscopy as described in (\nSchain et al., 2014\n;\nHill et al., 2018\n) was used to assess the density of myelinated axons at the junction of perilesional grey matter and sublesional white matter (Layer VI). Briefly, 30 \u03bcm sections were mounted onto gelatin-subbed slides, air-dried for 30 minutes, then coverslipped using prolong gold (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Slides were imaged on a Leica TCS SPE laser scanning confocal microscope using a 40x 1.3 numerical aperture oil immersion objective by exciting slides with 488, 561, and 647 laser diodes. Slides were imaged at a resolution of 0.135 x 0.135 x 1.0\u03bcm per voxel through the z-stack in four regions of Layer VI spaced 500 \u03bcm apart.\n\nQuantification and Analysis of Oligodendroglia\nAll images were analyzed using ImageJ. To assess densities of BCAS1+ (new myelinating cells) and CC1+ (mature oligodendrocytes) cells, 8OHdG+ (oxidative DNA damage marker) and Olig2+ (general oligodendrocyte marker) cells, and NG2+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells, images were opened, channels were split, then merged again to create a composite image. To estimate oligodendrocyte cell densities, cells were counted through the z-stack using the plugin \u201cCell Counter\u201d (\nhttps://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/cell-counter.html\n), a plugin that allows for manual counting by marking each cell with a marker using adapted stereological rules (\nFiala and Harris, 2001\n). To analyze oligodendrocytes with and without oxidative DNA damage, blinded double-labeled images of 8OHdG+ and Olig2+ cells were separated into oligodendrocytes with (Olig2+/8OHdG+) and without oxidative DNA damage (Olig2+/8OHdG\u2212). Similarly, slides single-labeled for oligodendrocyte precursor cells positive for NG2 immuno-reactivity were analyzed using the cell counter to estimate cell densities.\nTo quantify BCAS1+ cells, labeled cells were stratified based on morphology and BCAS1+ expression levels. Since BCAS1 is transiently expressed during oligodendrocyte maturation, oligodendrocytes were separated into distinct maturation stages. Briefly, as described in\nFard et al. (2017)\n, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) first express BCAS1 only in the soma (BCAS1+/CC1\u2212). As they mature, they express BCAS1+ more strongly in both the soma and in long, radiating processes (30 \u03bcm or longer; BCAS1++/CC1\u2212). Eventually, CC1, a marker of mature oligodendrocytes is expressed in the soma where it colocalizes with BCAS1+ cells (BCAS1++/CC1+). Finally, expression of BCAS1+ begins to decrease in the processes, but remains in the soma colocalized with CC1+, indicating maturation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes (BCAS1+/CC1+). Finally, in the last stage of maturation, BCAS1+ expression ceases, and CC1+ alone is expressed (\nFard et al., 2017\n). Thus, for the quantification of oligodendrocytes, with and without BCAS1+ and CC1+ staining, we stratified oligodendrocytes into five distinct maturation stages: BCAS1+/CC1\u2212, BCAS1++/CC1\u2212, BCAS1++/CC1+, BCAS1+/CC1+, and CC1.\nTo analyze SCoRe images, slices were analyzed using particle analysis on ImageJ by thresholding and assessing the percent area containing reflectance from myelinated axons. Additionally, we assessed the directionality and orientation of the myelinated fibers using the ImageJ plugin \u201cdirectionality\u201d (\nhttps://imagej.net/Directionality\n), a plugin that assigns angular direction to individual fibers and determines the frequency of each angular orientation.\n\nEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Myelin Basic Protein\nTo assess myelin damage, we used an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA; Ansh Labs, Houston, TX, USA) to measure longitudinal levels of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) in CSF. Previous literature has demonstrated that MBP is found in CSF of patients when a demyelinating lesion is present (\nOhta and Ohta, 2002\n). The ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, CSF samples from every time point (pre-operative, 14 days, 28 days, 6 wks, and 14 weeks after injury) across all animals were thawed at the same time and each was diluted 1:2 using assay buffer. Standards were reconstituted according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol and standards and samples were plated in duplicate. Samples were gently agitated on an orbital shaker at 800 RPM for one hour, then decanted and washed. Samples were then incubated in anti-MBP antibody and agitated at 800 RPM for one hour at room temperature (RT), on an orbital shaker. Solution was decanted, the plate was washed, and a biotinylated conjugate was added, then incubated and agitated for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT) at 800 RPM. Solution was decanted again, and the plate was washed. Finally, a chromogen detection solution was added and incubated for 20 minutes in the dark on the orbital shaker and read immediately on a plate reader (BioRad, Berkeley, California, USA).\n\nRNA Isolation and qPCR of Myelin Related Genes\nFresh-frozen perilesional brain tissue containing white matter dissected at euthanasia (14 weeks after injury) from all animals was used for this study. Tissue samples were removed from \u221280\u00b0 C storage, placed on dry ice, then dissected into 100 mg pieces (one for each animal). Each sample was mechanically homogenized using an RNAse free scalpel, then chemically triturated using the TRIzol method (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). Briefly, tissue was placed in TRIzol, then passed through an 18-gauge needle to further homogenize tissue. An organic extraction was then performed using chloroform and ethanol, according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). The extracted RNA was then air-dried, resuspended in 40 \u03bcL of PCR-grade water, then checked for A260/280 using a NanoDrop (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA).\nFollowing extraction, RNA was converted to cDNA using a High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, then normalized to 2 \u03bcg for each sample. Finally, qPCR was performed in triplicate using forward and reverse kiqStart primers (Sigma Adlrich, St. Louis, MO) for Myelin Basic Protein (MBP), a marker of mature myelinating oligodendrocytes; Myelin Regulatory Factor (MyRF), a gene for oligodendrocyte differentiation and regulation; Breast Carcinoma Amplified Sequence 1 (BCAS1), a gene upregulated in newly myelinating oligodendrocytes; and GAPDH as a housekeeping gene.\n\nData Analysis and Statistics\nAll of the studies were performed with the experimenter blinded to treatment groups. To assess any treatment specific group differences, SCoRe signal and cell density counts were all analyzed using unpaired two-sample Student\u2019s T-tests. To further assess the axons (imaged by SCoRe), we assessed histogram outputs from the directionality plugin and used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess differences in the distribution of myelinated axon orientation. To evaluate longitudinal measures of Myelin Basic Protein in CSF, a two-way ANOVA was performed to assess any differences between groups or time points. To assess relative fold changes of myelin gene expression of the EV group relative to the vehicle control group at 14 weeks post-injury, we used the ddCT analysis method. Finally, to assess relationships between myelin measurements and recovery, we used Pearson\u2019s correlation. Due to the availability of using only female subjects in the study, we did not evaluate the effect of sex as a variable in any analysis. All tests were analyzed using an alpha of p \u2264 0.05 to determine significance.\n\nData availability\nThe data that support the findings in this study are available from the corresponding author upon request."

    "Methods": "Experimental Neonatal Intermittent Hypoxia Model.\nThe study received approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of NorthShore University HealthSystem.\nC57BL/6J mice, originally obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine), were bred at the NorthShore University HealthSystem animal facility. Neonatal mice of both genders from each litter were randomly assigned to the IH group or control group and subjected to IH paradigm as previously reported (\nGoussakov et al., 2019\n). Briefly, the IH paradigm consisted of intermittent exposure to humidified 5% O\n2\nbalanced with 95% N\n2\nfor 2.5 min followed by reoxygenation in room air for 10 min. During hypoxic exposure, pups were separated from their dams and placed into a 250 mL volume air-tight chamber in a temperature controlled neonatal incubator with an ambient temperature of 35 \u00b0C. The paradigm was initiated at postnatal day 3 (P3, day of birth considered as P0) and continued for 5 consecutive days. The number of daily hypoxic episodes was 20, 20, 16, 14, and 12, equally divided into morning and afternoon sessions. Between the sessions, mice were returned to their dams for 2 h for recovery and nursing. Control mice were also separated from their dams for the same period of time as the experimental animals, but kept in room air in the same incubator at 35 \u00b0C. Upon completion of IH, mice were taken for in vitro electrophysiology studies at P10-P15 and after 6 weeks. Experiments was conducted in a blind manner to IH group assignment.\n\nElectrophysiology\nIn vivo fEPSP recording during intermittent hypoxia in neonatal mice\nNeonatal mice at P5-P7 (n=5) were anesthetized via inhalation of 3% isoflurane delivered through a nose cone mask. The skull was exposed with a 10 mm skin incision and a small hole was drilled at coordinate 1.7 mm posterior bregma, 1.5 mm lateral central line. Three 12 M\u03a9 tungsten electrodes, 127 \u03bcm diameter, 10 \u03bcm tip (#575400, A-M Systems) were glued together as an assembly and mounted onto a micromanipulator. The distance between bipolar stimulating electrodes was 50 \u03bcm and a recording electrode was placed 300 \u03bcm apart medially. The electrodes were lowered to approximately 1 mm below dura, directly above the dorsal hippocampus. The electrodes were further advanced by micrometer-steps during continued paired-pulse stimulation in order to get paired-pulse facilitation of recorded excitatory field potentials (fEPSP) as an indicator of correct electrodes placement in CA1 stratum radiatum. A 300 \u03bcM silver chloride reference electrode was inserted caudally under the skin and secured with acrylic glue onto the skull. Head was additionally immobilized with a cross-bar glued to the skull. The incision was irrigated with 2% lidocaine, and isoflurane was reduced and kept at 0.5% during recording, providing a sufficient level of anesthesia. Animal body temperature was kept at 35\u00b0 during recording session by heating pad connected to temperature controller (TC-1000, CWE, Inc.). Respiration and heart rate was recorded with a pulse oximeter (MouseOx).The setup was stable for several hours of recording with a stable baseline. The setup did not cause distress to the animal based on absence of movements and a stable heart rate. Stimulation was delivered through an isolator (IsoFlex, I.M.P.I., Israel). Responses were recorded with Multiclamp 700B amplifier, digitized with Digidata 1440 and recorded in current clamp using pCLAMP-10 software (Molecular Devices, CA) with sampling rate 100\u2009kHz, and low pass filter set at 5 kHz. Direct current (DC) potential recordings were obtained from same electrodes using common ground reference electrode. Recording of fEPSP was conducted during IH protocol and for several hours after with inter-stimulus intervals of 30 sec during IH and 1 min before and after IH. Gas mixture, either 21% O\n2\nor 5% O\n2\n(balanced with 95% N\n2\n) was supplied from tanks, mixed with isoflurane and delivered to animal through the nose cone mask. After obtaining a stable baseline recording, the IH session started and consisted of 5 episodes of 5% O\n2\nhypoxia duration 2.5 min interleaved with 10 min of 21% O\n2\n, similar to the IH protocol as above. After IH session, fEPSP recording continued for 4 hours, followed by a depotentiation protocol with low frequency stimulation or theta burst stimulations (2xTBS) and was recorded for 1 more hour.\nSynaptic depotentiation with low frequency stimulation (LFS).\nDepotentiation protocol consisted of 900, 0.1 sec square pulses, delivered at 2 Hz to Schaffer collateral/commissural \u2013 CA1 synapses. After one hour after LFS depotentiation, when fEPSP amplitude stabilized, pLTP was invoked with 2xTBS, as described above. The mean of the 10 min of fEPSP time course before TBS was taken as a baseline for calculation of depotentiation level and the last 10 min of recording after depotentiation was taken for calculation of LTP levels.\nPhysiological long term potentiation (pLTP)\nwas elicited with two theta burst stimuli\u2019s (2xTBS) separated by 1 min. Each TBS stimulation consisted of 10 trains with 4 pulses each, delivered at 100 Hz with 200 ms between the trains. Time course of fEPSP slope was recorded during 20 min before TBS and 60 min after to measure pLTP. LTP time course was calculated as percentage of baseline fEPSP slope for each recording and then averaged. For statistical comparison, the average of the last 10 min of each individual recording was taken.\nAfter the recording, 1 mA, 15 second direct current was applied to produce a small electrolytic lesion. The mice were euthanized, and the brains were fixed and Nissl stained to confirm the location of the recording and stimulation site in CA1 stratum radiatum.\nEx vivo fEPSP recording after IH\nHippocampal slice preparation and maintenance.\nTwo days after completion of IH protocol, at P10, mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (3%) and decapitated. Brains were rapidly removed and the right hippocampus, with adjoined cortex, was dissected out in ice cold artificial spinal fluid (aCSF) of the following composition (mM): 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO\n3\n, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 2 MgSO\n4\n, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 10 HEPES, 10 D-glucose, bubbled with carbogen (95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n) to maintain pH of 7.4. Osmolarity of this solution was 300\u00b15 mOsm. Dorsal hippocampus slices were cut 300 \u03bcm thick using Leica vibrotome (VT1000S, Leica Biosystems). Slices were maintained in an incubation chamber filled with room temperature 21\u00b0C aCSF and bubbled with carbogen for at least 1 hour before recording. The same aCSF solution was used during recording and perfused 3 mL/min at 21\u00b0C. All drugs were purchased from (Sigma-Aldridge Inc., MO).\nField excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings.\nFor extracellular recordings, slices were transferred to a recording chamber (model RC-24, Warner Instruments Hamden, CT, US) fEPSPs were recorded in stratum radiatum of CA1 region of hippocampus in response to electrical stimulation of Shaffer collateral/commissural axons with bipolar platinum-iridium electrode, 25 \u03bcm diameter of wires, placed approximately 300 \u03bcm apart from recording electrode. Recording electrodes were pulled from capillary tubes 1B150F-4 (World Precision Instruments Inc., FL) using P97 puller (Sutter Instrument, CA) and filled with aCSF (resistance 2\u20134 M\u03a9). Stimulus pulses with 0.1 ms width were delivered from stimulus isolator. Stimuli to evoke fEPSP were applied ones per minute in all recordings. Input-output curves were generated by increasing stimulus intensity in 20 \u03bcA increments from 0 to 300 \u03bcA and recording fEPSP responses. Stimulus intensity required to evoke fEPSPs of 40% of maximum amplitude (at the level of pop spike appearance) was determined and used for evoking all subsequent fEPSPs. Electrical signals were amplified using Axopatch-700B amplifier, digitized at the sampling rate 100 kHz, and recorded in current clamp using pCLAMP-10 software (Molecular Devices). fEPSP slope was used as a metric to compare individual fEPSPs changes in different experimental conditions. The difference in fEPSP or DC time course relative to baseline was tested with one sample t-test.\nWhole-cell patch-clamp\nWhole-cell patch clamp recordings were made in hippocampus CA1 pyramidal neurons in brain slices obtained from mice at 2 to 5 days after IH course and from age matched controls. Glass micropipettes were filled with intracellular solution of the following composition in mM; 83 K-gluconate, 30 KCl, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl\n2\n, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 MgATP, and 0.1 NaGTP (adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH), osmolarity290\u00b15 mOsm. High Cl\n2+\nconcentration was used to reproduce its intracellular concentration in neonatal animals. Filled electrodes had resistance of 2\u20134 M\u038f. For all patch clamp recordings pipette capacitance and whole cell compensations was applied. Series resistance (Rs) was not compensated but monitored and recordings with more than 15% change in Rs were discarded.\nIntrinsic and firing properties of CA1 pyramidal cell\nwere measured, including input resistance (Rin), membrane potential (Vm), cell capacitance (Cm), firing threshold (FT), spikes amplitude (SA), spike width at the level of half amplitude (SW), after hyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude and duration (AHP-A and AHP-D), and spike on-of delta current (dI), determined as difference between threshold to spike current and stop spiking current in response to increasing and decreasing current ramps.\nSynaptic depotentiation with low frequency stimulation and physiological long term potentiation protocols were the same as for in vivo experiments above. Paired pulse facilitation (PPF) was elicited by applying two consequent stimuli 70 ms apart. PPF was expressed as a ratio of amplitudes of the second fEPSP to the first.\nAMPA and NMDA miniature currents (mEPSC)\nwere measured in voltage clamp at \u221270 mV holding potential. In order to reveal and measure the NMDA component, the recording of mEPSC was first done in normal Mg\n2+\ncontaining aCSF during 15 min and then after 15 min washing with Mg\n2+\nfree solution (\nWatt et al., 2000\n). The aCSF contained 1 \u03bcM tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 100 \u03bcM of picrotoxin (PTX) to prevent action potential and GABAergic events, and 20 \u03bcM glycine to saturate NMDA binding sites. Therefore, we recorded only glutamatergic events, confirmed by application of CNQX (50 \u03bcM) and AP5 (100 \u03bcM), AMPA and NMDA receptor blockers, respectively, at the end of each recording. Application of CNQX and AP5 completely removed miniature events confirming that all mEPSC\u2019s were glutamatergic. 10 mM EGTA in pipette solution prevented occurrence of synaptic plasticity due to NMDA activation in Mg\n2+\nfree solution. AMPA current was measured at the maximum amplitude of response and NMDA current at 15 ms after stimulus artifact, where AMPA component of mEPSC is no longer present. mEPSCs recordings were analyzed using in-house software written on Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).\n\nMeasurement of silent synapses fraction by minimal stimulation technique.\nSilent synapses are defined by a large failure rate of evoked EPSCs at a hyperpolarized membrane, comprised of AMPA receptors EPSCs, concurrent with a small failure rate to the same stimuli at depolarized membrane, comprised of NMDA or mixed NMDA and AMPA EPSCs (\nLiao et al., 1995\n;\nMarie et al., 2005\n). EPSCs were evoked using minimal stimulation (\nIsaac et al., 1995\n;\nLiao et al., 1995\n) and using method by (\nHinds et al., 2003\n) with a fine tip (several micrometers) concentric electrode made from a patch pipette covered with electro-conductive carbon paint DAG-T-502 (Ted Pella, Inc., US). GABA receptors were blocked with 100 \u03bcM picrotoxin. Stimulus intensity, eliciting 50\u201360% synaptic responses at \u221270 mV, was determined during 50\u2013100 consecutive trials. The same stimulation intensity was applied to evoke responses at +50 mV. Response failures were visually identified and counted. Failure rates to evoke EPSC at \u221270 and +50 mV were used to calculate the fraction of silent synapses assuming Poisson model of neurotransmitter release by using formula (1-ln(F\n\u221270\n)/ln(F\n+50\n)) (\nLiao et al., 1995\n) where F\n\u221270\nand F\n+50\nare the failure rates at \u221270 mV and at +50 mV membrane potential. AMPA and NMDA origination of EPSC\u2019s were confirmed with application of CNQX (50 \u03bcM) and AP5 (100 \u03bcM), the inhibitors AMPA and NMDA channels respectively. For minimally evoked EPSC\u2019s recordings K-gluconate was replaced with 110 Cs-methanesulfonate in equimolar concentration and pH was adjusted to 7.3 with CsOH. Osmolarity of intracellular solutions was adjusted to 290\u00b15mOsm, patch electrode resistance was 2\u20134\u2009M\u03a9. All recordings were performed at room temperature 21\u00b0C.\nDrug treatments\nMK-801, a selective and non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist (0.25 mg/kg), and CMIQ, 4-Cyano-3-methylisoquinoline, a specific inhibitor of PKA, 0.02 mg per animal, (both from Sigma-Aldridge, MO) were applied via intracerebraventricularly injection. CMIQ was dissolved in 10% DMSO, 20% emulphor, and 70% saline, with the final concentration of 10 mg/ml. MK-801 was dissolved in sterile saline at final concentration 0.1 mg/ml. Drags were sterilized by filtering through 0.2 \u03bcm sterile syringe filter, aliquoted in sterile tubes and frozen at \u221220\u00b0 C until use. Mice pups were anaesthetized with 3% isoflurane and 1\u03bcl of the drugs (CMIQ and MK-801) were injected with 33G needle through the skin and skull in each lateral ventricle 1 hr before IH session. For chronic IH, MK-801 was administered 1 hour before each IH session twice a day for five days from P3 to P7.\nManganese enhanced magnetic resonance imaging\nManganese enhanced MRI was performed on neonatal mice undergoing IH to reveal brain areas with increased intracellular Ca\n2+\ninflux. Mn\n2+\ncontrast agent entered neurons via calcium voltage gated channels (Malheiros, Paiva et al. 2015) and NMDA receptors (\nItoh et al., 2008\n). MnCl\n2\n(60 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to neonatal mice at P4 (n=5). The injected solution consisted of 100 mM MnCl\n2\n(Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.01M PBS. The repeated injection of MnCl\n2\nwith the same dose was done at P6. Animals received IH course as described above and were repeatedly scanned before the injection, and 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after the first injection. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a 14.1 T Bruker Avance imaging spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA) using a 20-mm bird cage resonator. Mice were sedated with 3% isoflurane inhalation in air for induction and 1.5% for maintenance. Animals\u2019 respiration rate and rectal temperature were monitored with a small animal physiological monitor (SAII\u2019s Small Animal Instruments, NY). Body temperature was kept at 35\u00b0C by maintaining ambient temperature at 32 \u00b0C using the spectrometer gradient temperature controller. A T1-weighted three-dimensional fast low angle shot (FLASH) magnetic resonance imaging sequence was used with the following parameters TR/TE 133/4/3 ms, flip angle = 90 degrees, 12 averages, in-plane resolution 61\u00d761 microns, slice thickness 0.3 mm, 12 slices. Imaging time was 5 min and 14sec. To ensure consistent and reproducible ROI placement between groups and between sessions for the different age of the same animal, imaging slices were positioned using anatomical landmarks. The imaging plane was oriented perpendicular to the plane passing through lowest portions of anterior and posterior cortex. Six axial slices of variable thickness (depending on animal age) we placed between anterior commissure and front end of superior colliculi on a sagittal localizer. Regions of interest (ROI) were manually drawn on CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus of hippocampus on a single slice using the thickest portion of corpus callosum splenium as a landmark (slice 3). Image intensities in ROIs were normalized to the global brain intensity on the same slice.\n\nStatistical analysis.\nData are presented as means \u00b1 standard error of means. All variables were checked for normality and homogeneity (using Shapiro Wilk and Levene\u2019s tests). The variables were compared across treatment groups using Student T-test or one-way ANOVA. Post-\nhoc\ngroup comparisons were performed using Tukey-Kramer method. Significance was determined by\np\nvalues \u2264 0.05. The effect of the IH factor on normalized signal intensity in serial MEMRI measurements was tested using repeated measures ANOVA, separately for each hippocampus region. RM AVOVA was implemented as a general linear model with fixed Group and Time factors and random Subject factor nested within Group factor in Minitab 16 software."

    "Methods": "Experimental design, pigs, and brain collection.\nAll experiments with live animals were conducted following the protocols approved by the University of Memphis or the University of Tennessee Health Science Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Newborn pigs were obtained from artificially inseminated sows of a consistent genetic lineage maintained at a commercial facility. Consistently with previous studies (\nMiller et al., 2016\n;\nSharma et al., 2016\n) we considered newborn pigs with body mass less than 0.9 kg (average weight 0.75\u00b10.09 kg, range from 0.6 to 0.88 kg), which correspond to the lowest body weight 10th percentile, small for gestational age (SGA). The SGA pigs originated from multiple litters, and littermates of normal birthweight (normal for gestational age, NGA), (body weight 1.64\u00b10.22 kg, range 1.24 to 1.99 kg) were used as controls. Pigs were euthanized either within 12 hours after birth (at postnatal day 0, P0 pigs) or after rearing for 20 days (P20 pigs) in AAALAC accredited facilities using a commercially available milk replacement (\nBuddington et al., 2018\n). Both males and females were used in the study. All animals had normal physical appearance and behavior at the time of necropsy. On macroscopic and microscopic examination, none of the brains had evidence of injury.\nImmediately after euthanasia, the entire brain was removed, and the cerebellum was cut sagittally into ~0.5 cm thick slices that were processed for immunohistochemistry,\nex-vivo\nslice culture experiments or laser capture microdissection.\n\nImmunohistochemistry.\nUpon collection, cerebella were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4\u00b0 C for 48 h, washed in PBS three times, sunk in 30% sucrose in PBS, and embedded in OCT (optimum cutting temperature) compound. The OCT blocks were sectioned sagittally on a Leica CM3050 cryostat. Sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus slides. Immunohistochemistry with all antibodies, except anti-BrdU and anti-Ki67 antibodies, was performed following our previous protocols (\nIskusnykh et al., 2016\n;\nChizhikov et al., 2019\n). Slides were dried for 20 min at room temperature, washed in PBS (3 times, 10 min each), and blocked with 1% heat-inactivated goat serum and 0.1% Triton X100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Then, slides were incubated for 10 h at 4\u00b0 C with primary antibodies followed by species-appropriate Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. Anti-Ki67 and anti-BrdU immunostaining was performed as described above, except after washing in PBS, slides were boiled in 1X antigen retrieval solution (Sigma) for 10 min. Primary antibodies included rabbit anti-Calbindin D-28k (Swant, catalog #CB-38, dilution1:200), mouse anti-NeuN clone A60 (Sigma Aldrich, catalog # MAB377, dilution 1:500), rabbit anti-Pax6 (BioLegend, catalog # Prb-278p-100, dilution 1:350), rabbit anti-GFAP (Dako, catalog # Z0334, dilution 1:200), mouse anti-Ki67 clone B56 (BD Pharmingem, catalog # 556003, dilution 1:250), rat anti-phospho histone H3 (Abcam, catalog # ab90543, dilution 1:200), rabbit anti-cleaved Caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, catalog # 9664, dilution 1:300), mouse anti-Tag1 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, dilution1:5), and rabbit anti-BrdU (Rockland, catalog # 600\u2013401-C29S, dilution 1:300). DAPI staining was used to identify cell nuclei and to assess gross tissue morphology.\n\nEx-vivo\norganotypic cerebellar slice culture experiments.\nOrganotypic slices obtained from SGA and NGA pig cerebella were used to study GC migration. Cerebellar slices were prepared from P0 pigs as previously described (\nIskusnykh et al., 2018\n). Briefly, blocks of cerebellar vermes were embedded in 4% low temperature melting agarose in Krebs buffer (pH=7.2) and sagittally sliced on a vibratome at 400 \u03bcm. Slices were transferred to Millicell cell culture inserts (0.4 \u03bcm pore size, Millipore, USA), which were placed on the surface of DMEM medium (Invitrogen, USA) containing glutamine, glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, and Penicillin/Streptomycin, and then incubated in a CO\n2\nincubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\nfor 1 h (\nDaza et al., 2007\n;\nEnglund et al., 2006\n). Then, the DMEM medium was changed to a serum-free neurobasal/B27 medium (Invitrogen, USA) with BrdU (1:1000 dilution of the BrdU labeling reagent, Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat # 000103). After a 6 h exposure to label dividing GC precursors in the EGL, the BrdU-containing medium was replaced with BrdU-free medium of the same composition. Then, 24 h or 48 h after the beginning of the incubation, slices were rinsed in PBS three times (30 min each), fixed in 4% PFA in PBS at 4\u00b0 C for 1.5 h, cryoprotected using 30% sucrose solution in 1x PBS at 4\u00b0 C, and embedded in OCT compound. OCT blocks were sectioned on a Leica CM3050 cryostat and used for immunohistochemistry, which was performed as described above for cerebellar tissue analysis.\n\nEx vivo\ncerebellar electroporation.\nP0 cerebella were removed from the skull, separated from the meninges, cut into 0.5 cm thick pieces, and placed into a Petri dish platinum electrode chamber (Btx, cat # 45\u20130505) filled with endotoxin-free plasmid DNA in complete Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco, USA). The EGL was oriented toward the negative electrode to facilitate the negatively-charged plasmid DNA moving toward the positive electrode to enter GC precursors superficially located in the EGL (\nFamulski et al., 2010\n;\nRenaud and Ch\u00e9dotal, 2014\n). To visualize transfected cells, in all experiments a vector encoding nuclear mCherry (\npCIG2-H2B-mCherry\n) was electroporated alone or co-electroporated with\npCIG2-JamC\nand/or\npCIG2-Pard3a\nexpression plasmids (\nFamulski et al., 2010\n). Electroporations were performed using 5 pulses (120 V, 50 ms each, 500 ms interval between pulses) delivered via an ECM630 electroporator (Btx, Harvard Apparatus). After the electroporation, cerebella were embedded in 4% low temperature melting agarose, sagittally sliced on a vibratome at 400 \u03bcm and cultured\nex vivo\nfor 36 h or 48 h as described above for organotypic cerebellar slices (except no BrdU was added to the medium). After fixing slices in 4% PFA, embedding in OCT, and sectioning at a cryostat, electroporated cells were identified based on mCherry fluorescence.\n\nLaser Capture Microdissection (LCM) and qRT-PCR.\nFresh cerebellar tissue blocks were embedded in OCT on dry ice. Tissue was sectioned using a Leica cryostat, and 10 \u03bcm thick sections were collected on plain glass slides. For the EGL visualization, fresh frozen tissue sections were dehydrated using ethanol and stained with Cresyl violet in 50% EtOH for 30 sec. The sections were dehydrated again in ethanol and xylene. After drying for 5 min at room temperature, entire EGL (blue layer in\nFig. 3D\nand diagram in\nFig. 5\n) was isolated by LCM from five sections of each cerebellar vermis, using an Arcturus XT machine with CapSure Macro Caps (Arcturus, USA). RNA was extracted with a PicoPure\u2122 RNA Isolation Kit (Arcturus, San Diego, CA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNase-Free DNase Set (Cat #79256, Qiagen) was used to remove traces of the genomic DNA absorbed on columns, prior to RNA elution. RNA samples with the RNA integrity number (RIN) higher than eight were used for qRT-PCR analysis. Reverse transcription of RNA was performed with the iSciptTM cDNA Synthesis Kit (Biorad, USA). Amplification was performed using the Roche LightCycler 480 machine and KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix Kit as described previously (\nCurrle et al., 2005\n;\nYoo et al., 2014\n). Relative gene expression was calculated by the 2-\u0394\u0394CT method (\nLivak et al., 2001\n). The expression of each gene was normalized against\nGapdh\n. The primers used are listed below:\nFig. 3. Increased proliferation, apoptosis, and expression of Shh-regulated genes in the EGL of SGA pig cerebellum at P0.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A, B, G-J, N, O) Sagittal sections of medial vermis stained with indicated antibodies. Panels A, B, N, O show the EGL, panels G, H show both the EGL and the molecular layer (ML), panels I, J show high magnification of the IGL. The outer and inner boundaries of the EGL are outlined by solid and dashed line, respectively (A, B, G, H, N, O). The lower solid line shows the lower boundary of the ML (G, H).\n(A-C) Arrows point to mitotic (pH3+) cells in the EGL (A, B), that were increased in the number in SGA relative to NGA pigs (C) (t\n4\n=3.18, p=0.034, n=3 pigs per group). *p <0.05.\n(D-F) qRT-PCR analysis of\nGli1\nand\nPtch1\nexpression in laser capture microdissected EGL (blue layer in the diagram D).\nGli1\nand\nPtch1\nexpression (E, F) was significantly upregulated in the EGL of SGA pigs (t\n7\n=3.15, p=0.016 for\nGli1\nand t\n7\n=2.63, p=0.034 for\nPtch1\n, n=4 NGA and 5 SGA pigs). *p < 0.05.\n(G-J) Arrowheads point to apoptotic (act Casp3+) cells in the EGL (G, H) or IGL (I, J).

Apoptotic cells were very rare in the outer (DAPI+/NeuN-negative) EGL in both NGA and SGA pigs, and no difference was detected between the two groups (N-P). In contrast, there was a dramatic increase in the number of apoptotic act Casp3+/NeuN+ differentiating pre-migratory cells in SGA cerebella (t\n4\n=8.16, p=0.0012) (N, O, Q). **p <0.01. n=3 pigs per group.\nAll data are means \u00b1 sd, all statistical values are from two-tailed t-test.\nScale bar: 300 \u03bcm (panels A, B, G, H), 100 \u03bcm (panels I, J) and 80 \u03bcm (panels N, O).\nFig. 5.

Data are presented as the means \u00b1 sd. Comparisons between SGA and NGA pigs were made using the two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test, with p<0.05 considered statistically significant.\n\nCell counts, measurements, and statistical analysis.\nThe numbers of Pax6+, Ki67+, and NeuN+ GC precursors in the EGL, GFAP+ Bergmann glial fibers in the ML, and NeuN+ GCs in the IGL were determined using the optical fractionator method with 20 \u03bcm-thick sections. Z-stack images with 1 \u03bcm optical step were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope and uploaded into the Stereo Investigator Software for an unbiased cell count analysis as previously described (\nIskusnykh et al., 2018\n;\nGlaser et al., 2007\n). The number of Ki67+, Pax6+, and NeuN+ cells was calculated in 100 \u03bcm-long segments of the EGL with 15 \u03bcm dissector height. The number of GFAP+ Bergmann glial fibers was evaluated in 200 \u03bcm x 200 \u03bcm squares of the molecular layer with 12 \u03bcm dissector height. The number of NeuN+ cells in the IGL was calculated in lobes III and VIII of the cerebellar vermis. First, the density of NeuN+ cells in the IGL was calculated in 100 \u03bcm x 100 \u03bcm squares with 12 \u03bcm dissector height. Then, GC counts per lobe were obtained by multiplying the density of NeuN+ cells in the IGL and IGL volume for a particular lobe in each section. For clarity, the numbers of NeuN+ cells in the IGL of each lobe in SGA pigs were normalized to those in NGA pigs, which were set as 1.\nThe thickness of Tag1+ layer, the number and diameter of (Calb+) Purkinje cells, the numbers of histone H3 (pH3+) and activated caspase 3 (act Casp+) - positive cells were estimated using 12 \u03bcm-thick sections, which were captured by Zeiss A2 fluorescent Microscope equipped with Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera. The measurements were performed using Image J software (NIH) as previously described (\nIskusnykh et al., 2018\n). Purkinje cells were counted along the 500 \u03bcm line drawn parallel to the Purkinje cell layer. Purkinje cell diameter was measured in 40 randomly selected Purkinje cells in lobes III and VIII of the cerebellar vermis. The numbers of mitotic pH3+ cells were measured per 1 mm of the EGL; the numbers of apoptotic (act Casp+) cells were measured per 1 mm of the EGL or per 1mm\n2\nof the ML and IGL (\nZhang et al., 2015\n;\nFauquier et al., 2014\n).\nFor migration experiments using cerebellar slices, the distance of mCherry+ or BrdU+ cells was measured from the outer surface of the EGL using ImageJ (NIH) software.\nFor consistency, all measurements and cell counts in NGA and SGA cerebella were performed in sections (or slices) taken from medial cerebellar vermis. At least three NGA and three SGA cerebella (three sections per cerebellum) at each developmental stage were analyzed for each marker. All data are presented as means \u00b1 sd. Statistical significance was determined by either a two-tailed t-test (when two experimental conditions were compared) or by one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post hoc test (when more than two experimental conditions were compared); p<0.05 was considered statistically significant for all comparisons."

Compliance with ethical standards\nAll animal study procedures were carried out in accordance with UK Home Office legislation (Scientific Procedures Act 1986) and approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body at King's College London, where tissue was generated for this study.\n\n2.2. Animal surgery and tissue collection\nCervical level 6 (C6) spinal contusion surgeries were performed on adult male Lister Hooded Rats (320 to 380\u00a0g at time of surgery; Harlan), as previously described (\nBurnside et al. 2018\n;\nJames et al. 2015\n). Briefly, animals were anesthetised by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a ketamine (60\u00a0mg/kg) - medetomidine (0.25\u00a0mg/kg) mix. Once no longer reflexive, an area overlying the shoulder blades was shaved and swabbed with ethanol and iodine. Animals were then transferred to a sterile field overlying a heat pad to maintain core temperature at ~36.5\u00a0\u00b0C (monitored with a rectal probe) during surgery. Muscle layers overlying spinal level C6 were then retracted and a C6 laminectomy performed to expose the underlying spinal cord. A 225 kDyne midline contusion was delivered to the exposed cord using a 2.5\u00a0mm diameter probe (Precision Systems Instrumentation, USA). Animal muscle and skin layers were then re-sutured, and animals transferred to a holding incubator until anaesthesia was reversed 1.5\u00a0h after induction. All animals received 3\u00a0days of post-operative saline (3\u20135\u00a0mL) and analgesia (carprofen; 5\u00a0mg/kg) and a one-week course (or until end-point) of antibiotics (baytril; 0.05\u00a0mg/kg) during recovery. In total, 27 animals were used to generate the pathology time course data (5 WPI,\nn\n=\u00a06; 1 WPI, n\u00a0=\u00a06; 72 HPI, n\u00a0=\u00a06; 24 HPI, n\u00a0=\u00a06; SHAM,\nn\n=\u00a03). SHAMS received only a laminectomy.\nAt the appropriate time after injury, animals were sacrificed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (Euthatal, 80\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.). They were then transcardially perfused with PBS heparin (0.01%), followed by 400\u00a0mL of 4% PFA (0.1\u00a0M\u00a0PB, pH\u00a07.4). Tissues were then post-fixed overnight in the same fixative solution before being rinsed in 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a024-h PBS (pH\u00a07.4) washes.\n\n2.3.\nEx vivo\nLugol's iodine staining and paraffin wax embedding\nFixed whole spinal cords were stained by incubation in an excess of 25% Lugol's Iodine (LI) solution for 48\u00a0h (\nMetscher 2009\n;\nStrotton et al. 2018\n). Tissues were then agitated in 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a024-h PBS washes to remove excess iodine. For paraffin embedding, tissues were dehydrated through 8-h incubations in 30, 50 and 70% ethanol with agitation before being transferred to a paraffin wax processing station (Leica TP1020). Here, tissues were entirely dehydrated through 2-h washes in 90% ethanol and 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100% ethanol. Tissues were then cleared through 2-h washes in Xylene-ethanol 1:1 and 3 x Xylene, before being infiltrated by wax with 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02-h paraffin wax incubations at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Tissues were then transferred to a paraffin wax embedding station and cast in custom silicon moulds, ensuring the spinal cord was centrally embedded and surrounded by ~3\u00a0mm of wax on all sides. Once embedded, tissues were stored at room temperature until tomographic imaging.\n\n2.4. Synchrotron microtomography imaging\nMicrotomography was performed at the Diamond-Manchester Imaging Branchline I13-2 of the Diamond Light Source Synchrotron (Oxfordshire, United Kingdom)(\nPe\u0161i\u0107 et al. 2013\n;\nRau et al. 2011\n) using previously optimised imaging conditions (\nStrotton et al. 2018\n). Briefly, in-line phase contrast imaging was performed with a sample-to-detector propagation distance of 160\u00a0mm and a filtered pink X-ray beam with weighted mean energy of 27\u00a0keV.\nSamples were mounted and vertically aligned to the tomography rotational axis on a HUBER 1002 manual goniometer (HUBER Diffraktionstechnik GmbH & Co. KG, Germany). This was mounted on an Aerotech ABRT-260 (Aerotech Inc., USA) rotation stage. 4\u00d7 compound magnification imaging was conducted with a pco.edge 5.5 (PCO AG, Germany) detector (sCMOS sensor of 2560\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02160 pixels), by using a 2\u00d7 objective coupled to a 500\u00a0\u03bcm CdWO\n4\nscintillator, mounted ahead of a second 2\u00d7 lens. This gave a field of view (FoV) of 4.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.5\u00a0mm (effective pixel size 1.625\u00a0\u03bcm) that could encompass the entire lateral and dorso-ventral width and depth of the rat spinal cord cervical enlargement. 40 flat- and 40 dark-field images were collected before 6001 equally-spaced sample projections (step-size 0.03\u00b0) across 180\u00b0 of continuous constant-speed rotation. Exposure times of 0.12\u00a0s (~15\u00a0min/scanset) maximised use of the detector dynamic range without saturation.\nAfter sample alignment, a custom script for automatic collection of concatenated datasets performed automated stage raising of 3.43\u00a0mm. A second scanset with the same imaging conditions was then collected, overlapping the former by 2%. This overlap aided later alignment and tomogram concatenation. For each spinal cord sample, at least 3 sequential datasets spanning 10.29\u00a0mm of spinal cord (~50\u00a0min total scan time) were collected. For SHAM spinal cord samples, between 5 and 9 concatenated datasets were collected.\n\n2.5. Tomographic reconstruction of spinal cords\nTo derive high quality tomographic reconstructions, data were filtered to remove artefacts and correct distortions introduced by the imaging system (\nStrotton et al. 2018\n). Briefly, sample projections were normalised (flat- and dark-field corrected) and corrected for radial lens distortion (\nTitarenko et al. 2010\n). Sinograms for reconstruction were ring artefact corrected (\nTitarenko 2016\n). Phase retrieval was then conducted on projections using a Paganin filter (\nPaganin et al. 2002\n) set to the peak X-ray energy of 27\u00a0keV, effective pixel size 1.6125\u00a0\u03bcm, propagation distance 160\u00a0mm and a\n\u03b4\n/\u03b2 ratio of 3 (optimised in (\nStrotton et al. 2018\n)). Tomographic slices were then generated\nvia\nthe filtered back projection algorithm (FBP)(\nAtwood et al. 2015\n;\nKak and Slaney 2001\n;\nWadeson and Basham 2016\n). Tomograms were concatenated by manually removing overlapping tomographic slices in ImageJ (NIH, USA)(\nSchneider et al. 2012\n).\n\n2.6. Histology and immunolabelling\nFor histology, removing iodine from tissue helped sections adhere to glass slides. To remove iodine, tissues were dewaxed by heating to 60\u00a0\u00b0C and then passed through 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08-h xylene washes with agitation at room temperature. Tissues were then rehydrated through 8-h incubations of ethanol:ddH\n2\nO at 100, 70, 50, 30 and 0%. Next, iodine was then removed from tissue by incubating in a 5% (\nw\n/\nv\n) solution of sodium thiosulphate overnight (\nStrotton et al. 2018\n). Tissues were then dehydrated and re-embedded in paraffin wax as above. 7\u00a0\u03bcm transverse sections cut with a microtome were collected onto positively charged glass slides for staining.\nFor haematoxylin and eosin staining, sections were first dewaxed in an oven for 60\u00a0min at 60\u00a0\u00b0C, then washed in 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-min xylene incubations and rinsed 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030-s in 100% ethanol. Slides were then rinsed in ddH\n2\nO and placed in haemalum for 5\u00a0min. Slides were rinsed in running cold water to remove excess haemalum, before dipping 5 times in 0.5% HCl in 70% ethanol to differentiate. Sections were then rinsed in water and counterstained with 0.5% eosin for 10\u00a0min. Excess stain was removed in water, then stained sections were dried onto slides by placing in an oven for 60\u00a0min at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Sections were then cleared in xylene for 5\u00a0min before cover-slipping in DPX mounting media overnight to dry.\nFor Nissl staining, sections were dewaxed and xylene cleared as for H&E. Sections were rehydrated, placed in cresyl violet (5% w/v in ddH2O) for 10\u00a0min, rinsed in ddH2O to remove excess cresyl violet, then dried onto slides in an oven for 60\u00a0min at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Sections were then cleared in xylene for 5\u00a0min before cover-slipping in DPX mounting media overnight to dry.\nFor immunolabelling of CD68 positive cells and IgG, sections were dried onto slides overnight at room temperature, then heated to 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 60\u00a0min to dewax. Slides were placed in 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-min xylene incubations, then rinsed 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030-s in 100% ethanol. For antigen retrieval, tissues were then incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10\u00a0min, before placing slides in a pressure cooker at 90\u00a0\u00b0C filled with 1% citric acid (pH\u00a06.04) for 5\u00a0min. Slides were then rinsed in water and blocked in 1% goat serum (in TBS pH\u00a07.6) for 1-h, followed by biotinylated goat anti-rat IgG (Vectorlabs, #BA-9401) at 1:1000 in block solution overnight. For CD68 staining, slides were blocked in 1% bovine serum (in TBS pH\u00a07.6) for 1\u00a0h, followed by mouse anti-rat CD68 (Abcam, #ab31630) at 1:500 in block solution overnight. Slides were then washed in 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-min TBS washes, before applying StreptABC-HRP (Vectorlabs, #PK-6100) to slides for 30\u00a0min. Slides were rinsed with 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0min TBS washes, then placed in 10% ImmPact DAB solution (3,3- diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride; Vectorlabs, #SK-4105) for ~1-min. Slides were then rinsed in water before counterstaining in haemalum as detailed above. Slides were dehydrated for 60\u00a0min at 60\u00a0\u00b0C, placed in xylene to clear for 5\u00a0min and cover-slipped in DPX mounting media at room temperature overnight to dry. All slides were imaged under brightfield illumination using a Zeiss AxioCam.\n\n2.7. Morphological assessments and statistics\nAll tomogram image processing, segmentation and analyses were performed using ImageJ (NIH, USA)(\nSchneider et al. 2012\n). For measuring macro features, the complete scanset for each sample was compressed to 16-bit and median binned 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 (to an effective voxel size of 3.2\u00a0\u03bcm). This reduced salt-and-pepper noise and \u2013 together with the bit-depth reduction \u2013 reduced file size for faster image processing (2\n4\ntimes smaller files) during analysis. Spinal cord area, tissue damage (defined as tissue debris and cavity), gray matter, white matter and dorsal columns were then manually annotated by a blinded investigator in 3.2\u00a0\u03bcm thick serial sections extracted\nin silico\nat regular 403.2\u00a0\u03bcm (every 126th slice) intervals through the entire imaged volume. Data, statistical comparisons and graphs were generated in GraphPad Prism (v7.0a). All statistical outputs for 2-way ANOVA (\nFig. 4\n.A, E, I, M, Q) and 1-way ANOVA (\nFig. 4\n.B-D, F\u2014H, J-L, N\u2014P, R-T) are available in index matched Supplementary Tables (Table.S1.A-T) available in Supplementary file 7. Summary graphs were generated in orthogonal planes by re-slicing data within ImageJ, with average (mean), maximum and minimum intensity projections of multiple 1.6\u00a0\u03bcm thick\nin silico\nslices, as indicated in figures. In\nFig. 6\n, tomograms were matched to histological images by re-slicing and thickness adjusting in IMOD (\nKremer et al. 1996\n).\nFig. 4.\nOpen in a new tab\nQuantifying acute-to-chronic cord area, tissue damage, gray matter, white matter and dorsal column area changes following a C6 midline contusion.

Comparisons made with two-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc multiple comparisons. (B, F, J, N, R) Rostral, (C, G, K, O, S) epicentre and (D, H, L, P, T) caudal changes occurring in shade-matched regions of (A, E, I, M, Q). Each point represents an individual animal.

All statistical comparisons available in index matched supplementary tables (Supplementary table 1).\nFig. 6.\nOpen in a new tab\nAcute spread of injury along the base of the dorsal columns and associated vasculature. (A-D) Sagittal projections of insets from\nFig. 3\n. (A) At 24 HPI, focal damage (white high contrast signal areas, cyan arrows) is located just dorsal to the central canal. This region is local to an area at the base of a dorsal spinal vein (green arrow) as shown in E-J. (B) By 72 HPI, acute damage has been replaced by gross tissue damage that begins to collapse by (C) 1 WPI, contributing to overall tissue atrophy. (D) By 5 WPI, caudal damage appears relatively limited to focal dorsal column lesions (yellow arrows), with gross damage replaced by an overall tissue atrophy (see quantification in\nFig. 4\n). (E-G) Different tissue thickness and intensity projections at 24 HPI from the inset in A) highlight caudal tissue damage and local vasculature. (E) A single 3.2\u00a0\u03bcm thick slice, (F) an average intensity projection of a 121.6\u00a0\u03bcm thick mid-sagittal section highlights a white band corresponding to a focal area of damage (cyan arrows) just dorsal to the central cord. This appears at the base of the large diameter dorsal spinal veins (green arrows) better highlighted in (F), a minimum intensity projection of the same 121.6\u00a0\u03bcm thick section. Fine vasculature associated to dorsal spinal veins (DSVs, green arrows) branches into the high intensity signal (cyan arrows) area of tissue damage. Central spinal arteries (CSAs, pink arrows) projecting from the anterior spinal artery (ASA) on the ventral aspect of the cord can also be seen. (H-J) Orthogonal projections of the inset in E, highlight damage around the base of the dorsal column near the collecting pool of the large dorsal spinal vein.\nCell size-frequency distribution was performed on Nissl stained spinal cord sections from rostral and caudal border regions of SHAM (\nn\n=\u00a03), 24 HPI (\nn\n=\u00a05), 72 HPI (n\u00a0=\u00a05) and 1 WPI (n\u00a0=\u00a05) animals in a blinded manner. For each animal, 1 rostral and 1 caudal section corresponding to the shaded rostral and caudal border regions in\nFig. 4\n.A were selected for analysis (36 sections total; 1 rostral and 1 caudal section from 18 animals). On these 36 sections, an Ilastik (v1.1.3) (\nBerg et al. 2019\n) pixel classifier was trained to recognise Nissl stained features within a manually traced gray matter mask (Sup.\nFig. 2\n.A,B). Using CellProfiler (v4.0) (\nMcQuin et al. 2018\n), Nissl features were segmented to individual objects (Sup.\nFig. 2\n.C) that were then filtered to Nissl positive cells containing a manually identified nucleus (Sup.\nFig. 2\n.D; 6871 neurons across all sections). Graphs and statistical comparisons of the Nissl positive cell size-frequency distributions were generated in Python using the Seaborn and SciPy packages, respectively.\nFig. 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nSerial transverse projections through a C6 midline contusion epicentre at multiple time points after injury. (A) 24-h after a dorsally delivered contusion injury, immediate damage is noted within the injury epicentre. The dorsal and ventral columns are particularly damaged, but fragmented \u2018gray matter\u2019 can still be recognised. Damage extending rostral and caudal to the injury is mainly within the dorsal column. Satellite regions of damage (high contrast regions indicated by cyan arrows) appear in tissue surrounding the injury epicentre, though are not apparent at later time points. (B) At 72 HPI, gross damage predominates. \u2018Gray matter\u2019 regions can no longer be discerned and the extent of damaged tissue has spread relative to 24 HPI. Swelling of the cord following the initial contusion is apparent at 24 and 72 HPI at the epicentre (~4.5\u00a0mm). (C) Swelling has subsided by 1 WPI. Central damage leaves only a thin rim of tissue intact at the epicentre, with most of the central region being filled with debris. Moving rostro-caudal, damage is predominantly in the dorsal columns. (D) At 5 WPI, a cavity has formed in the epicentre spanned by tissue bridges (green arrows, also seen in the longitudinal plane in\nFig. 3\n). These tomograms are quantified in\nFig. 4\n.\n\n2.8. Behavioural assessments\nMotor and sensory forelimb behaviours were assessed in a separate cohort of age and weight matched Lister hooded rats that received the same contusion injury as the synchrotron pathology group (\nn\n=\u00a08). These animals were assessed in multiple behavioural tasks, including the forelimb locomotor scale (FLS) (\nSingh et al. 2014\n), grip strength (\nMeyer et al. 1979\n), horizontal ladder (\nMetz and Whishaw 2009\n) and sticker sensation latency task (\nKomotar et al. 2007\n). All behaviours were scored at 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28 and 35 DPI. FLS, grip strength and horizontal ladder were also scored at 3 DPI. Three horizontal ladder and grip strength baseline scores were collected after 2\u00a0weeks of habituation training at \u22121, \u22123 and\u00a0\u2212\u00a05 DPI with the average of these taken as baseline. FLS and sticker sensation baseline scores were collected once (\u22121 DPI), to maintain task novelty.\nFor grip strength, rats were supported by their hindlimbs and ventral side, then withdrawn from a grip strength bar (Linton instruments, U.K.) to which they reflexively grip before relinquishing the bar to give a force readout. On each test day, the maximum reading from 10 passes over the bar was recorded at 3 intervals separated by at least 1\u00a0h. The mean of these 3 recordings was the grip strength score for that day.\nFor horizontal ladder, rats were trained to run across a 1\u00a0m ladder with unevenly spaced rungs for 10\u00a0min, 5\u00a0days/week, 2\u00a0weeks prior to baselining. Recordings were made (Sony DCR-SX30E Handycam) and later forelimb slips scored in videos of 3 ladder crossings. The number of forelimb slips were scored as a percentage of total forelimb steps.\nFor sticker sensation, a circular sticker (\u00f8\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0mm, Rymans, U.K.) was applied to the plantar surface of both forepaws and the rat placed in a clear Perspex testing chamber (\u00f8\u00a0=\u00a045\u00a0cm). The time to acknowledge/sense the sticker (apparent as a hand to mouth movement or wrist flick) on either paw (whichever first) was recorded as sticker sensation latency. If this exceeded 60\u00a0s, a score of 60\u00a0s was assigned. Animals were kept in the chamber for at least 120\u00a0s regardless of how early sticker sensation was detected."

    "Methods": "Experimental Animals.\nA total of 57 male 3-month old Sprague-Dawley rats (ENVIGO) weighing about 300g were included in these experiments. Animals were housed as pairs in an animal facility with controlled temperature and humidity, a 12 hour light-dark cycle, and food and water were provided ad libitum. All procedures were approved by the VCU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nBrain slice recording was conducted in a total of 37 rats, which underwent TBI or a sham injury and were allowed to survive for either 30 or 60 days prior to recording. Rats were randomly assigned to recording conducted in the presence of picrotoxin [(+)Pic condition] or with no picrotoxin present [(\u2212)Pic condition]. Group sizes for the (+)Pic condition were TBI-30 d (n=7), TBI-60 d (n=7), Sham-30d (n=3), Sham-60d (n=4). Group sizes for the (\u2212)Pic condition were TBI-30 d (n=5), TBI-60 d (n=6), Sham-30d (n=2), Sham-60d (n=3). The sham rats recorded at 30 d and 60 d did not differ on any of the electrophysiological parameters measured, and were pooled for the statistical analysis for each condition.\nHistological studies were conducted in a total of 20 rats, which underwent TBI or a sham surgery and survived for either 30 or 60 days. Group sizes were TBI-30 d (n=7), TBI-60 d (n=5), Sham-30 d (n=4), Sham-60d (n=4). The sham rats sacrificed at 30 d and 60 d did not significantly differ on any of the anatomical regions measured, and were pooled for the statistical analysis.\n\nSurgical Procedure.\nAnimals received a moderate lateral fluid percussion injury (LFPI) or sham surgery following our published protocol (\nSun et al., 2007\n,\n2015\n). Briefly, the rats were placed in an acrylic induction chamber to anesthetize with 4% isoflurane. To stabilize their heads in preparation for surgery, the rats were placed in a ventilated stereotaxic frame with an inlet containing 2.5% isoflurane in a gas mixture (30% O\n2\nand 70% N\n2\n). A midline incision was made to expose the skull, and a 4.9mm trephine was used to make a craniectomy on the left parietal bone halfway between the lambda and bregma sutures. A Luer-slip style hub was made from a 20-gauge needle cap and placed to the craniectomy site with cyanoacrylate and reinforced with dental acrylic to the skull, then anesthesia was turned off. As animals regained consciousness the Luer-slip style hub was filled with saline and connected to a pre-calibrated FPI device and a pulse of 2.01 \u00b1 0.05 ATM was administered to induce a moderate TBI. Immediately after injury the hub was removed and animals were returned to the surgical table to monitor righting time. Sham control rats received the same surgical procedure but without the fluid pulse. After injury or sham surgery the incision site was sutured and the animals were returned to their cage.\n\nElectrophysiological Recording Procedures.\nAt 30 or 60 days following FPI or sham injury, rats were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane for 4 minutes and the brain rapidly removed. Horizontal 400-\u03bcm slices were taken from the hemisphere ipsilateral to injury, and cut into low-calcium artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF: 2\u20134 \u00b0C) containing (in mM) NaCl 124, KCl 3,MgSO4 5, NaHCO3 26, NaH2PO4 1.25, glucose 10, saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2. Slices were then transferred to an equilibration chamber containing oxygenated ACSF used for electrophysiological recording containing (in mM) NaCl 124, KCl 3, MgSO4 2, NaHCO3 26, NaH2P4 1.25, glucose 10, CaCl2 2, and either 50 \u03bcM picrotoxin or no picrotoxin. Slices were allowed to equilibrate for at least one hour prior to recording. For recording, one slice per brain was recorded. Briefly, the slice was transferred to a submersion-type recording chamber perfused at a rate of 2 ml/min with the solution used for equilibration at 32\u00b0C. A bipolar stimulating electrode and a micropipette recording electrode (filled with ACSF, resistance 2\u20134 M\u03a9) were positioned in the DG molecular layer to evoke field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) through the medial perforant pathway (MPP). To verify placement in the MPP, and not the lateral perforant pathway, responses to paired stimulus pulses (interpulse intervals of 50, 100 and 150 ms) were confirmed to produce paired-pulse depression or no change (\nWang et al., 2016\n). Paired-pulse depression or facilitation, when evoked with the low current levels used here (sub-threshold for population spikes), reflect mainly presynaptic short term plasticity (\nLomo, 1971\n;\nZucker, 1989\n). Our analyses confirmed that responses to paired stimulation were not systematically different among experimental groups, to provide further evidence that TBI-induced changes in LTP primarily reflected alterations at the postsynaptic level. For LTP experiments, a stimulating intensity that evoked fEPSPs of 50% maximum, as based on input-output testing, was delivered at a rate of one pulse every 30 s and used to obtain a 30-min period of baseline recording. LTP was then induced using three trains of theta-burst high frequency stimulation (HFS), consisting of 10 bursts of four pulses at 100 Hz, with 200 ms separating the onset of each burst. Each train was separated by 50 s. Following HFS, fEPSPs were acquired for 60 min using stimulus parameters identical to those of the baseline recording. For LTP baseline and post-HFS data, mean fEPSP slopes were aggregated into 2-min epochs for graphical and statistical analyses.\n\nBrain tissue histological assessment.\nFollowing TBI, injured brain often undergoes atrophy. To assess the degree of this change at 30 or 60 days after injury, a separate cohort of rats were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were harvested and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stored at 4\u00b0 C in PBS+0.05% sodium azide until processed for experiments. Coronal 60\u03bcm slices were collected in 24-well plates containing PBS+0.05% sodium azide and stored at 4\u00b0 C until staining. For visualization of tissue structure in volume ratio measurements, slices were processed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (\nSmith et al., 1997\n). Every 6th slice in sequence beginning near \u22122.30 mm from Bregma were taken until a total of 6 slices per animal were collected and mounted on slides, providing a thorough representation of both the cortex and hippocampus. Images were taken with a widefield microscope to visualize the entire slice. Tissue volume of the dentate gyrus, total hippocampus, and cortex were measured using Image J program.\nBriefly, Image files of H&E stained slices were imported into FIJI software for analysis using the plugin TrakEM2 (\nCardona et al., 2012\n). Files for all 6 slices per animal were grouped together as a sequence and correct calibration values were set based on pixels per \u03bcm. Within each layer the z-resolution was adjusted based on magnification of the microscope camera, original slice thickness in \u03bcm, and distance apart each layer was respective of each other within the Z coordinate. The software generated an image sequence for each animal where we could selectively highlight a specific region of interest. Values from the highlighted regions were generated to create a total area measurement for ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres of the dentate gyrus, total hippocampus, and cortex.\n\nStatistical analysis.\nThe effects of injury condition (sham-injury, TBI 30 dpi, TBI 60 dpi) on LTP magnitude and evoked paired-pulse responses were evaluated using ANOVA (SPSS v21 \u2013 GLM Procedures) combined with Bonferroni post hoc tests. The significance of shifts in input-output curves was evaluated with the Mann-Whitney U test. A nonparametric approach was selected in the latter case, because homogeneity of variance requirements were not met when ranges of stimulus intensities were applied. The % IPSI / CONTRA representing brain tissue atrophy (sham-injury, TBI 30 dpi, TBI 60 dpi) was evaluated using ANOVA (JMP Pro v15) combined with Tukey HSD post hoc tests. The significance level, \u03b1 = 0.05, was used for all inferential statistics, and averaged values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM."

Expression and purification of UCHL1 recombinant proteins\nThe mouse UCHL1 gene was cloned into the pET-22b(+) expression vector (Millipore Sigma, Burlington MA) using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends respectively (forward primer 5\u2019 -GGGAATTCCATATGCAGCTGAAACCGATGGAGATTAACC-3\u2019 and reverse primer 5\u2019 -AAATTTCTCGAGTTAGGCTGCTTTGCAGAGAGCCAC-3\u2019 were used), resulting in a protein with eight additional residues (LEHHHHHH) at its C terminus as described (\nKoharudin et al., 2010\n). The Cys-to-Ala mutation of C90A UCHL1 was generated by Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis (Millipore Sigma). For protein expression, Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) cells (Novagen) were transformed with UCHL1 wild type (WT) or UCHL1 C90A vectors. Cells were initially grown at 37\u00b0C, shaking at 300 rpm, for approximately 24 h, induced with 1 mM Isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 35\u00b0C when the OD 260 was 0.8\u20131.0, then grown for an additional 5 h. Proteins were purified using a Qiagen Ni-NTA Fast Start Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Protein purity was assessed by SDS\u2013PAGE and Coomassie blue staining.\n\n2.3.\nIn vitro\nhydrolase activity assay\nThe UCHL1 hydrolase activity assay was performed as previously described with slight modifications (\nLiu et al., 2011\n;\nLiu et al., 2002\n). Briefly, 100 nM C90A UCHL1 recombinant protein was mixed with 500 nM ubiquitin-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC, Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA) diluted with UCH hydrolase buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin, 5 mM DTT). Free AMC fluorophore was read using a fluorescence plate reader (ex 360 nm, em 460 nm) over a period of 14 mins with 2 min intervals between each reading. WT UCHL1 protein (100 nM) was included as a positive control.\n\n2.4. Generation of UCHL1 C90A knockin (C90A) mice\nThe\nin vitro\nhydrolase activity assay confirmed that mutation of the cysteine 90 to alanine in the UCHL1 construct completely abolished the hydrolase activity of the C90A recombinant protein (\nFig. 1A\n). A UCHL1 C90A mouse was then constructed following a procedure described previously to convert the cysteine 90 located on exon 4 to alanine (TGT>GCT)(\nLiu et al., 2015\n). As shown in\nFig. 1B\n, a C57BL/6J mouse genomic clone from the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was modified to carry the TGT<GCT mutation as well as a G418 resistance cassette (PGK-neo) flanked by flippase (FLP) recognition target (FRT) sites. The FLP recombinase enzyme recognizes FRT sites and is used to remove the cassette. The targeting vector was constructed by gap repair from the BAC and was confirmed by sequencing to ensure the correct position of the TGT<GCT mutation, insertion of the PGK-neo cassette as well as the presence of the diagnostic Nsi I restriction enzyme site for the identification of gene-targeted embryonic stem (ES) cells. The vector was then selected in mouse C57BL/6J ES cells as described previously (\nLiu et al., 2015\n). ES cells with homologous recombination identified by southern blots were shipped to Taconic Artemis (Koeln, Germany) and injected into blastocysts to generate heterozygous UCHL1 C90A mice on a C57BL6 background. UCHL1 C90A heterozygous males were then back bred to C57BL6 female mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME), and the resulting heterozygous offspring were crossbred to produce homozygous mutant UCHL1 C90A and WT UCHL1 lines. Mouse genotypes were verified by genomic DNA extraction and PCR amplification with primers 5\u2019TGTTTATCTCTTTAGAACTGGCTGG-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-CTAGAGAATAGGAACTTCGCGG-3\u2019.\nFig.1.

Controlled cortical impact (CCI) surgery\nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were housed in a temperature and humidity controlled environment with 12 h light cycles and free access to food and water. Surgery was performed under isoflurane anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Animals were randomized across groups into multiple cohorts based on availability of the appropriate genotype and age. The surgeon was blinded to the genotype of the mouse. The CCI model of traumatic brain injury used in this study was performed as described (\nDixon et al., 1991\n;\nLiu et al., 2017\n). Male mice, age 10 \u2013 12 weeks, were anesthetized using 5% isoflurane in 60% nitrous oxide, balance oxygen, and then placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) fitted with a nosecone. A midline incision was made, the skin retracted, and a 5 mm craniectomy was performed over the right parietotemporal cortex (bregma \u2013 2.5 mm, lateral right + 3.0 mm). The impactor tip (3 mm) was zeroed to the surface of the brain prior to injury (impact speed: 6 m/sec, injury depth: 1.6 mm, dwell time: 50 msec, angle of impact 20\u00b0); the wound was closed without repair of the craniectomy. Sham surgery was identical to that described above without trauma. Mice were monitored daily post injury. Animals exhibiting signs of infection (redness, swelling or discharge), pain (hunched posture, freezing, or vocalization) or weight loss greater than 20% of controls were removed from the study and euthanized using the carbon dioxide inhalation method.\n\n2.6. Beam balance test\nVestibulomotor function was measured on D0 (baseline, pre-injury) and D1 \u2013 5 post injury as described previously (\nDixon et al., 1987\n;\nFeeney et al., 1981\n). UCHL1 C90A and WT CCI and sham-operated mice were placed on a 10 mm round beam above a padded surface and latency of up to 60 sec was measured in 3 trials daily. N = 8\u201310 per group.\n\n2.7. Total protein extraction and western blotting\nWT and C90A hippocampi were dissected from mouse brains 24 h and 7 d post CCI, rapidly frozen on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. For UCHL1 detection, na\u00efve WT and C90A cortices and hippocampi were used. Total protein extraction, quantification and sample preparation were performed as described previously (\nLiu et al., 2019\n). Samples were resolved on 12% (for mono-Ub) or 4\u201320% (for all other markers) Mini-protein TGX precast protein gels (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Equal number of samples from each group were loaded onto each gel. Two replicates of pooled mouse forebrain lysates were included on each gel serving as internal controls. Gels were transferred onto Odyssey\u00ae Nitrocellulose Membranes (LICOR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE), which were then probed with indicated markers following LICOR\u2019s protocol. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using an Odyssey CLx Imaging System (LICOR). Densitometric analysis was performed using Image Studio Lite Ver. 5.2 (LICOR) and data were normalized to the average of the two internal controls on each gel to reduce gel to gel variation (N=8\u201310 per group). To examine the effect of the UCHL1 C90A mutation on protein ubiquitination in aged mice, cortical and hippocampal tissues were dissected from na\u00efve 18 mo old WT and C90A mice and processed following the procedures described above (N=5 per group). GAPDH or \u03b2- actin was used as loading control as indicated in figure legends. Data were normalized to the loading controls.\n\n2.8. Cell survival measurement\nCell survival measurement was performed as described previously (\nLiu et al., 2017\n). After euthanasia, mice were transcardially perfused with 20 ml of heparinized saline (4 units/ml) followed by 10 ml of 10% buffered formalin 21 days post CCI. Whole brains were embedded in paraffin and 7 \u03bcm thick serial sections were collected every 0.5 mm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and hippocampi were examined using 20X brightfield magnification. Neurons exhibiting normal morphology with visible nucleoli were counted in the ipsilateral medial 1mm of CA1 region of hippocampus and normalized to the respective contralateral region (bregma \u22121.9 mm). Data are expressed as percent contralateral. N = 10 per group.\n\n2.9. Assessment of Spared Tissue Volume\nSpared tissue volume was calculated by measuring surviving brain tissue in ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheric areas every 0.5 mm (bregma \u22124.3 to +3.0 mm) using ImageJ 1.50i software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Spared volume was determined by multiplying slice area by slice interval thickness then adding together slices and is expressed as percent contralateral hemisphere (\nSwanson et al., 1990\n). N = 9\u201310 per group.\n\n2.10. Luxol fast blue staining (Kluver-Barrera)\nAssessment of gracile nucleus and gracile fasciculus demyelination was performed by examining coronal sections of medulla (bregma \u22127.5 mm) and C1 spinal cord in 18 mo old WT and C90A mice (N=4 per group) after staining with Luxol fast blue following the protocol described previously (\nKluver and Barrera, 1953\n).\n\n2.11. APP, SMI-32 and MBP immunohistochemistry\nAPP immunostaining was performed on WT and C90A mouse brain sections (bregma 2.1 mm) 24 h post CCI as well as in cross sections of medulla from 18 mo old na\u00efve WT and C90A mice as described previously (\nLiu et al., 2017\n;\nMarmarou and Povlishock, 2006\n). In injured mice, APP-positive spots in thalamus (mediolateral 1.25 \u2013 2.25, dorsoventral 2.5 \u2013 3.0) and lateral corpus callosum (mediolateral 3.0, dorsoventral 2.0 \u2013 2.5), with diameters between 5 and 10 \u03bcm, were counted as previously described (\nXia et al., 2018\n) and divided by area to yield APP density. APP density in 18 mo old WT and C90A mice was assessed in gracile nucleus (bregma \u22128.0 mm) and normalized to area. SMI-32 and myelin basic protein (MBP) immunofluorescent staining was performed on WT and C90A mouse brain sections 7 d post CCI. Sections were immunostained with anti-SMI-32 and MBP antibodies, then incubated with CY3 and AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, respectively. SMI-32 and MBP expression were assessed by measuring fluorescence intensity using ImageJ software after normalization of backgrounds. Brain sections incubated without application of primary antibody served as negative controls.\n\n2.12. Statistical Analysis\nData are expressed as means +/\u2212 SEM. SMI32/MBP ratio, APP expression, cell counting, spared tissue volumes, and densitometric comparison of immunoblots in post-injury mice were analyzed using two-way ANOVA; Beam latency was analyzed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA with LSD post hoc testing. Comparisons of APP quantification and immunoblot densitometric analysis for 18 mo old WT and C90A mice were performed using Student\u2019s T test. All statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS statistical software (IBM Corp, Armonk, NH). Results were considered to be significant when p \u2264 0.05."

    "Methods": "Machine learning (ML) approaches for data-driven exploratory analysis offers unique opportunities for knowledge discovery and predictive modeling (Schultebraucks and Galatzer\u2010Levy, 2019). In past years, a large number of early factors immediately after trauma have been examined as candidate predictors for PTSD susceptibility and multiple independent studies have shown that early factors comprise significant predictive signals to discriminate clinically meaningful trajectories of symptom development or long-term risk (Galatzer-Levy et al., 2013;Galatzer-Levy et al., 2014;Galatzer-Levy et al., 2017;Karstoft et al., 2015;Papini et al., 2018;Segman et al., 2005;Shalev et al., 1998;Yehuda et al., 1998).\n\nHowever, no clinical prediction model is yet available to be used directly in the acute care setting without additional clinical screening or diagnostic interviews in an already clinical and resource stretched setting (van der Mei et al., 2020). This lack significantly impedes the feasibility of clinical risk prediction models under conditions of ED overcrowding, large-scale emergency events, disasters, and epidemic outbreaks. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and future similar situations are a paradigm case illustrating the critical need to support highly charged EDs through computational methods to identify the possible risks of long-term mental health care needs.\n\nIn response to this fact, a vital public mental health funding objective of the NIMH is to enable \u201cpractical, scalable, and sustainable mental health screening and triage, and providing interventions at scale\u201c (Gordon and Borja, 2020). The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has funded a large multi-site consortium to collect data to build generalized models of posttraumatic stress courses (McLean et al., 2019;NIMH, 2016). Similarly, military agencies are engaged in large initiatives to identify and predict risk for PTSD in soldiers deployed to warzones (Dean et al., 2019;Schultebraucks et al., 2020a;van der Wal et al., 2019). The use of ML-algorithms for the improvement of prognosis directly implemented into the ED is a new and emerging field aiming to prevent trauma-related stress pathology at first contact with the health system.Schultebraucks et al. (2020b)demonstrated that readily available data such as vital signs and lab tests abstracted from electronic medical records yield probabilistic information to discriminate patients with high non-remitting PTSD symptoms vs. patients with low symptoms (resilience). The authors recruited participants in two Level-1 Emergency Trauma Centers in the U.S. The model development sample was collected at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia (N=377), and the external validation sample was collected at Bellevue Hospital Center, New York, New York (N=221). The predictive model achieved high accuracy to discriminate PTSD trajectories of non-remitting symptoms vs. resilience using data from electronic medical records including biological markers from blood sampling along with four items from a validated stress questionnaire (discovery dataset, N=377, f1-score=0.85, AUC=0.85), and equivalent accuracy on the independent test set (Validation dataset, N=211, f1-score=0.86, AUC=0.86) (Schultebraucks et al., 2020b). These findings support the feasibility to develop and validate clinical prediction models using readily available data collected directly in the ED and show that important predictors of adverse mental health effects after trauma exposure can be used by utilizing routinely collectible data (Schultebraucks et al., 2020b). Since this algorithm is based on psychometric data of a four-item stress questionnaire it is not yet fully automated. However, it is very promising to further explore whether routinely collected data from electronic medical records alone is sufficient to predict PTSD risk with high discriminatory accuracy and there is a large-scale project funded by the National Institute of Health that promises to provide further evidence to test the potential of this research avenue (McLean et al., 2019).\n\nThis builds on a larger vision of how computational psychiatry can lead to new directions to prognosticate who is at risk at the early onset directly after the traumatic event took place when the patients are still in contact with the health care systems and follow-up care can be planned (Fig. 1). Eventually, this may open new ways for precision psychiatry at scale and directly implemented into the electronic medical system of the acute care setting. These initially promising findings will need to be extended to the broad clinical population of ED patients from routine practice and to other types of acute emergencies such as ACS or stroke to demonstrate the full potential as an automated clinical readout of posttraumatic risk."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nForty-eight postnatal day (PND) 16\u201318 male Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Envigo RMS, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were randomly assigned to receive an ACA or sham surgery, and either EE or STD housing that began immediately after surgery for 21 days: ACA + EE (n=12), ACA + STD (n=12), Sham + EE (n=12), and Sham + STD (n=12). All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Pittsburgh. Every attempt was made to limit the number of rats used and to minimize suffering.\n\nSurgery\nAll surgeries were performed as previously described (\nFink et al., 2004\n). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5%, 50/50 mixture of N\n2\nO and O\n2\n), endotracheally intubated, mechanically ventilated, and then provided femoral central venous and arterial catheters. Ventilation parameters were adjusted such that PaCO\n2\nlevels were maintained within a target range of 35\u201345 mmHg. Neuromuscular blockade was achieved with vecuronium (1mg/kg/h, i.v.) administered 1 min before the onset of asphyxia to prevent gasping. A 9.5 min period of asphyxia was produced by disconnecting the ventilator. Following the period of asphyxia, the ventilator was reconnected with FiO\n2\n=1, and resuscitation was initiated through the administration of epinephrine (0.005 mg/kg), sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/kg), and manual chest compressions that were administered until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved. Rats were continuously monitored for 1 h post-ROSC before being placed in an incubator for recovery. Sham rats received the same surgical manipulations as ACA, but they did not receive asphyxia or resuscitation. All rats were kept normothermic (37.0\u201337.5\u00b0C) for the duration of the surgery with a heating lamp. When able to mobilize on their own after the procedures, the rats were returned to their lactating mother (dam) and littermate cage until PND 21.\n\nHousing\nCohorts of rat pups (6\u20138) assigned to enrichment were placed in the EE cage with their dam until weaning on PND 21, and afterwards the dam was removed. The EE cages are large, stainless-steel wire cages (91 \u00d7 76 \u00d7 50 cm) containing three levels connected by ramps for increased ambulatory space. Additionally, toys, tubes, and nesting materials create a novel stimulatory environment, which is maintained by rearrangement of the objects daily and replacement of the objects with each cage cleaning (twice per week). The pups assigned to STD housing conditions were maintained in the home cage with the dam and littermates until weaning (PND 21), at which point they were separated and housed in pairs in standard Plexiglas cages (37 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 18 cm) for the duration of the experiment. After weaning, all pups (EE and STD) were provided laboratory chow and water\nad libitum\n. Rats remained in their respective housing conditions (EE or STD) for 21 days until sacrifice.\n\nNeurologic deficit score (NDS)\nAcute neurologic outcome was assessed at 3 h post-surgery using the NDS by an investigator blinded to the experimental conditions. The NDS is an acute measure of neurologic impairment, evaluating cranial nerves, motor and coordination, sensory perception, consciousness, and breathing (\nShaik et al., 2015\n). A score of 0 indicates normal behavior, or no perceptible deficits and a maximum score of 500 points indicates 100% deficit (death).\n\nMotor performance (beam-balance)\nRats were trained for three consecutive days prior to surgery on a well-established beam-balance task (\nKline et al., 2010\n,\n2012\n;\nCheng et al., 2012\n), which assesses vestibulomotor function. The beam-balance task consists of placing the rats on a suspended, narrow (1.3 cm wide) elevated wooden beam and recording the time (maximum of 60 s) before they lose their balance and fall. The test was performed on post-surgery days 1\u20135 and three trials were provided (30 s inter-trial interval). The average of the three trials was used in the statistical analyses.\n\nAnxiety-like behavior (affect)\nAll rats were evaluated for anxiety and exploratory behavior on day-12 post-surgery using the open field test (OFT). Briefly, rats were placed in a 60 \u00d7 60 cm opaque Plexiglas arena where they could freely explore for 5 min. The time spent in the peripheral and central areas of the arena were recorded. The greater the percentage of time spent in the center indicates decreased anxiety, whereas more time in the periphery is indicative of impaired affect (i.e., anxiety). The data were recorded with ANYMAZE 5.10 software version (Any-maze, Wood Dale, IL).\n\nNovel object recognition (declarative memory)\nOn post-surgery days 12 and 13 the rats were assessed for intact memory with the novel object recognition (NOR) task. The habituation phase took place on day 12 (after the OFT) and consisted of placing the rats (singly) in a 60 X 60 cm opaque Plexiglas arena where they were presented with two dissimilar objects (a permanent object and a decoy object) that they could explore and interact with for 30 min. Day 13 was the testing phase in which the rats were assessed for their ability to recognize a novel object. Briefly, the rats were exposed to the original objects for 2 min, then one of the original objects was replaced and 1-hr later the percent time spent interacting with the permanent object and with the novel object during a 5 min period was recorded. The NOR ratio was calculated as (time with novel object) / (total time with both objects) and then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage of time spent with the novel object. A ratio above 50% indicates novel object preference, whereas a ratio below 50% indicates familiar object preference (\nAntunes and Biala, 2012\n). All data were recorded with ANYMAZE software version 5.10 (Any-maze, Wood Dale, IL).\n\nAcquisition of spatial learning\nThe Morris water maze (MWM) is a well-validated test to assess spatial learning and memory in normal and CNS injured rats (\nKline et al., 2010\n;\nKline et al., 2012\n;\nFink et al., 2004\n;\nManole et al., 2012\n;\nBondi et al., 2018\n). Briefly, rats are placed into a pool (180 cm diameter, 60 cm depth, 20\u201322\u00b0 C) containing a submerged escape platform that is in the southwest quadrant of the pool and kept constant for all trials. Visual cues to aid the rat in locating the platform are saliently hung on the walls. Four daily trials with randomized entry locations (north, east, south, and west) and a maximum exploration time of 120 s/trial were provided. The mean of the four daily trials was used for the analysis. On day-19 post-surgery, the rats received a probe trial to evaluate memory retention. The concept of the probe trial is that rats that have learned the location of the platform will spend more time in the quadrant of the pool where it was previously located (i.e., target quadrant) suggesting that they remember where it was located during the training sessions. Thus, after removing the escape platform the rats swam freely for 30 s and the percent time spent in the target quadrant was recorded. Additionally, on day 19 post-surgery and following the probe trial, a visible platform test was provided to assess visual ability. The platform was raised 2 cm above the water surface and was marked by white tape to make it easy for the rats to see the cue. The rats failing to find the escape platform on 4 consecutive trials were believed to be visually impaired and excluded from the study because intact vision is required to discern the spatial cues and acquire spatial associations. All data were recorded with ANYMAZE software version 5.10 (Any-maze, Wood Dale, IL).\n\nHistology\nOn post-operative day-21, all rats that underwent behavior were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and 1:1 O\n2\nand N\n2\nO and transcardially perfused with 50 mL of 1% heparinized saline. The brains were further fixed by immersion in 10% phosphate buffered formalin for 24 h, then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose until submerged, flash frozen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until processing. Coronal sections (35 \u03bcm thick) were obtained at ~3.12 mm anterior to bregma using a cryostat, stained with Cresyl violet, and CA\n1\nhippocampal neurons were quantified by an investigator blinded to group conditions.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using StatView on data obtained by researchers blinded to experimental conditions. Physiological data, beam-balance, and MWM were assessed using repeated measures ANOVA. All other endpoints were assessed using one factor ANOVAs. When the ANOVAs revealed an overall difference, the Newman-Keuls post-hoc test was used to specify group differences. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and\np\n<0.05 is considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Drugs:\n6-OHDA.HBr, apomorphine, MPTP, saline and ampicillin were purchased from Sigma USA. SK609 was synthesized in house as described previously [\n42\n]. Safety toxicology studies of SK609 in rats have shown the maximum tolerated dose of SK609 is 30mg/kg and all the doses used in this study are well within the no-observed-adverse-effect level of SK609.\n\nAnimals:\nAll rodent experiments were conducted at Drexel University and care and use of all laboratory animals followed NIH guidelines and all experimental procedures were approved by the Drexel University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7AM) and experimental sessions occurred between the hours of 9AM and 12PM. For pharmacokinetics (PK) experiments, seventeen male Sprague Dawley rats (300\u2013400g, ~4-months old; Charles River) were maintained on food and water\nad libitum\n. For sustained attention testing, a separate group of similar animals were maintained on food ad libitum with water intake limited to 10 min/day (n=6, 350\u2013450g, ~4 months old at the beginning of the study and ~7 months old at the end of the study; Charles River) and met criteria for apomorphine-induced rotational asymmetry (see below).\n\nRodent Surgery:\nSurgeries were conducted as previously described [\n44\n]. Briefly, 6-OHDA (8\u03bcg/2\u03bcl in 0.9% saline and 1% L-ascorbic acid) was injected using a Hamilton syringe unilaterally into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB; coordinates AP: \u22122.2mm, ML: \u00b11.5mm, DV: \u22128.0mm relative to Bregma) at a rate of 1.5 \u03bcl/min under isoflurane anesthesia. The syringe was left in place for 5 minutes to allow the toxin to dissipate into the tissue before slowly removing the syringe and suturing the incision. Post-surgery animals were administered with a subcutaneous injection of bupivacaine (0.05 mg/kg) and a systemic administration of saline (0.9%) and ampicillin (100 mg/kg) and allowed to recover for 2 weeks.\n\nRodent apomorphine rotation testing:\nRats were administered a subcutaneous injection of apomorphine (0.50 mg/kg) and returned to their home cage for 10 min. Animals were placed in a customized plexiglas cylinder (40 cm H \u00d7 30 cm D) and each animal\u2019s motor activity within the cylinder was video recorded for 1 hr without disturbing the animal. The videos were scored for complete rotations contralateral to the site of the unilateral lesion independently by blind experimenters. Animals were considered to have an effective 6-OHDA lesion if they exhibited \u2265 60 contralateral rotations with minimal ipsilateral rotations.\n\nRodent PK studies:\nRats (n=17) were administered with SK609 (4mg/kg; i.p) dissolved in 0.9% phosphate buffered sterile saline. Fifteen minutes post drug administration, blood was collected from the first group of 12 animals from the saphenous vein into heparinized BD microtainer tubes and plasma was extracted from the blood samples by centrifuging the samples for 6 minutes at 3,000 \u00d7 g. Post blood collection, the 12 animals were euthanized, and whole brain was rapidly removed on ice and stored. The second group of animals (n=5) was euthanized 15 minutes post drug administration and prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatum (STR) and hippocampus with amygdala (HIPPO) areas were dissected on ice. All brain samples were homogenized with w/v saline and centrifuged at 3000 \u00d7 g and the supernatant was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. SK609 was quantified by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. All plasma and brain samples were analyzed on an Ultimate 3000 UHPLC (Thermo) with a chilled auto-sampler (6\u00b0C), column heater (60\u00b0C), using a Waters XBridge BEH C18 (2.5 \u03bcm, 2.1 mm \u00d7 50 mm) column with a water to acetonitrile reversed phase gradient and coupled to a Q Exactive Plus Mass spectrometer in positive ion mode switching between full scan and MS/MS mode. Data were analyzed in Xcalibur (Thermo), Tracefinder v 3.1 (Thermo) and GraphPad v6 (Prism, La Jolla, CA) using the major [M+H] ion at 184.0890 with a 5ppm mass window. No interfering peaks in analyte or internal standard channels were noted in sample with or without matrix. All solvents were from Thermo Fisher and were Optima LC-MS grade, and analysts were blinded to sample identity until final analysis. For sample processing, 20 \u03bcL of the brain homogenate or plasma was added to 10 \u03bcL of a 10 ng/\u03bcL solution of diclofenac in methanol which was used as an internal standard. The sample was vortexed, and the protein was precipitated with 70 \u03bcL ice cold acetonitrile. Brain homogenates were bath sonicated for 5 minutes to ensure extraction. Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes. 50 \u03bcL of the supernatant was transferred to a HPLC vial, then diluted 1:1 with 50 \u03bcL of water, then vortexed. Standard curves, as well three quality control samples at the top, middle and bottom of each range, were generated using dilutions of SK609, diclofenac and 20 \u03bcL charcoal stripped serum (Golden West Biologicals) as a surrogate matrix. Since there was no observable noise in the blank samples, conservative limits of detection and quantitation were set at the 1st and 2nd non-zero standard curve point, respectively.\n\nRodent sustained attention testing:\nThe sustained attention task was performed as described previously, using a sound attenuated operant chamber ((Med Associates Inc.) [\n46\n]). 6-OHDA lesioned animals (~3 weeks post lesion surgery) were trained to lever press for water reward using their unaffected paw to avoid any potential motor impairment from affecting task performance. Briefly, animals were trained to sustain attention for a cue light and press the trained lever for signal trials (designated as correct response) and the opposite lever for non-signal trials (designated as correct rejection) to obtain a water reward. Incorrect lever presses were recorded as misses during signal trials or false alarms during non-signal trials and did not result in any reward delivery. Failure to respond to the levers after 5 sec in either the signal or signal trials resulted in retraction of the levers and a 5 sec timeout period of darkness with no cue or house light and were recorded as omissions. The cue light duration and the intertrial intervals were varied randomly. A visual index (VI) adopted using signal theory was calculated, as described previously [\n47\n], by taking all of the above parameters into account with 1 being representative of peak performance, 0 being no performance, and 0.35 being considered as minimum cutoff for training [\n45\n]. To account for the baseline inter-animal variability, performance in the task was measured as difference in VI (DVI) between performance with drug treatment and the previous day vehicle (saline) treatment.\n\nNon-human primates:\nThe study was conducted under an approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol by Atuka Inc. at our facility in Jiangsu Province, PRC. Fourteen specific-pathogen-free female cynomolgus (\nMacaca fascicularis\n, 9.5\u201312.3 years of age, 3.0\u20134.5 kg) were used for these studies, eight for PK experiments and six for cognitive testing. All animals were group housed with 2\u20133 animals per cage. The cage sizes exceeded UK, EU, NIH and CCAC minimum size recommendations, 152 (w) \u00d7 136 (d) \u00d7 192 (h) cm. The housing room was subject to a 12-hour light-dark cycle (lights on 7 AM), temperature 20\u201328\u00b0C in a room containing only animals of the same sex. Fresh fruit, primate pellets and water were available ad libitum. In preparation for PK studies, animals were acclimatized to the experimental setting and trained to provide blood samples. The animals used for PK and cognition studies were rendered parkinsonian by once daily subcutaneous injection of 0.2 mg/kg MPTP, administered for 8\u201312 days, until the first appearance of parkinsonism symptoms. After this time, a parkinsonian syndrome progressed over approximately 30 days, and stabilized. Additional administrations of MPTP were given to some animals to titrate to similar degrees of parkinsonism in individuals across the group. If additional MPTP was administered, animals were monitored for a minimum of an additional 30 days to verify that symptoms were stable.\n\nNon-human primate PK studies:\nIn an escalating non-randomized dose design, three oral doses of SK609 (0.5, 2 and 4 mg/kg; n=8 per dose) followed by a single IV dose (2 mg/kg) were administered with a minimum of 3 days washout period between drug administrations. Eleven blood samples for drug level analysis were collected immediately before (t = 0 min) and then +5, 10, 15, 30 min and +1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h and 24 h post drug administration for each dose from each animal. Samples of 0.5 ml whole blood were taken from the saphenous or cephalic veins and transferred to blood collection tubes with sodium-heparin additive. The tubes were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1500g at 4\u00b0C and the resulting plasma layers removed, split into two equal aliquots and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Analytical assays were performed using the same protocol as described for rodent PK studies for analyzing the drug concentration. PK parameters were estimated from curve fitting the data using Graphpad Prism (v8).\n\nNon-human primate object retrieval testing:\nObject retrieval (OR) testing was performed as described previously [\n48\n\u2013\n50\n]. Briefly, the task required the macaque to reach into a clear Plexiglass box (15 cm by 15 cm by 5 cm) with one open side to retrieve a food reward (raisin or apple piece). The open side of the box can face left, right, or front relative to the animal and the food reward was placed at the front edge, center, or rear edge of the box. The box was mounted on an opaque white tray positioned outside of the testing cage and was centered or placed to the far left or far right relative to the testing cage. A testing session consisted of 30 trials that differed in the combination of placement of the reward within the box, the location of the open side of the box, and the position of the box on the tray, thus affecting the difficulty level of the motor and cognitive demands of each trial. Trials were designated as \u201ceasy\u201d or \u201cdifficult\u201d based on cognitive requirement of the trial. Easy trials (n = 15) were defined as ones in which the opening of the box was facing the animal (requiring only a straight through reach), or when the opening of the box was facing the same way as the previous trial. Difficult trials (n = 15) were defined as ones in which the opening of the box faced to the side (requiring a detour reach) and followed a trial in which the opening either faced the animal or faced the opposite side. Several measures including task completion time i.e. time between presentation of the box and correct retrieval response; number (percent) of successfully completed trials i.e. those on which reward is retrieved on the first attempt; number (percent) of correctly performed trials i.e. those on which reward is eventually retrieved but not on first attempt, were recorded. In addition, if the reward is not retrieved on the first attempt, the type of errors made were recorded and included: cognitive errors or barrier reach errors (made when an animal reached for and hits a closed side of the box rather than making a detour); motor errors (when an animal reached into the open side of the box but failed to retrieve the reward or dropped the reward before eating it); perseverative reaches (reaches made to a closed side of the box and the reach is to the same location where the opening was on the previous trial). Further, omissions (number of trials that were not attempted within 30 seconds of trial presentation) and aborted trials (the number of trials that were initiated by the animal, but the animal stopped responding before retrieving the reward) were also recorded.\n\nStatistics:\nData were analyzed using Graphpad Prism v8 and outliers were determined using Grubbs test and removed from further analysis. Significance was tested using repeated measures one-way ANOVA or paired t-tests as appropriate and is reported in respective results and p<0.05 was maintained for significance."

    "Methods": "2.1. Human iPSC cell culture and maintenance, iSN differentiation, and bortezomib treatment\nThree iPSC lines created from the skin biopsies of individuals with no known health concerns were acquired from the Mayo Clinic Biotrust according to IRB approved guidelines. Fibroblasts were reprogrammed using Cytotune-iPS 2.0 (courtesy of Regen Theranostics) and karyotypically normal iPSC clones for each line that passed quality control testing for pluripotency and germ layer differentiation were selected. The lines used in this study were from 2 females (21-year-old, 6BT1; 77-year-old, 1BT1) and one male (18-year-old, 100BT8), and a single iPSC clone was used to represent each iPSC line. iPSCs were maintained on LDEV-free Geltrex in mTeSR\u2122 1 and manually passaged every 4 days.\nThe differentiation of iPSCs into sensory neurons followed a well-established approach based on dual-SMAD inhibition (\nChambers et al., 2012\n) with modification as described previously (\nAnkam et al., 2019\n). Briefly, iPSCs were dissociated into single cells using Accutase and plated as a monolayer (2 \u00d7 10\n5\ncells/cm\n2\n) in mTeSR\u2122 1 supplemented with Y-27632. Differentiation was initiated 24h post-plating with a surface density of 80% confluence. The differentiation medium consisted of KSR medium, N2 medium, or a mixture of both. Days 0 \u2013 4 included 100 nM LDN193189 and 10 \u03bcM SB431542 in the culture medium, and for days 2 \u2013 10 the medium was supplemented with 3\u03bcM CHIR99021, 10\u03bcM DAPT, and 5\u03bcM SU5402. Eleven days post-induction, neural crest derivatives were dissociated with Accutase and plated in neuronal media for subsequent iSN maturation and maintenance (N2 supplemented with growth factors: 25 ng/ml NGF, BDNF, GDNF, and NT3, 0.5 mM cAMP, and 200 \u03bcM L-ascorbic acid). Typical iSN yields were in the range of 60-70%. The dissociation of cells by Accutase consisted of incubation for an appropriate duration (6 min for iPSCs, and up to 30 min for iSN precursors) followed by trituration to dissociate cell aggregates, and centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min.\nWe have previously reported an assessment of iSN maturity for the iPSC lines used in this study using RNA profiling, an analysis of methylation patterns throughout the differentiation process, and the electrophysiological behavior at d30 and d60 (\nAnkam et al 2019\n). Proteins representative of neuroectoderm (PAX6, DLK1, CUZD1, OTX2, DKK1) or neural crest (SOX10, MSK1, ID2, AP2B, ETS1, FOXO3, NGN1) were not detected by LC-MS/MS in the samples generated for this study. Proteins indicative of neural progenitors and nociceptors were detectable, and the total protein abundance based on total protein intensities are presented in\nSupplemental Figure 1\n. Levels of ion channels, cell surface receptors, and synaptic vesicle proteins are suggestive of a functional nociceptor phenotype.\nBortezomib (PS-341) was dissolved in DMSO for a stock concentration of 3.5mg/ml and diluted in neuronal media to a final concentration of 100nM for all experiments. The amount of DMSO vehicle in the media was 0.0001% for bortezomib-treated iSNs and DMSO controls. An equivalent volume of neuronal media was used for the blank controls.\nA complete list of materials and reagents used in this study is located in\nSupplemental Table 1\n.\n\n2.2. Study design and sample generation\niSNs were allowed to mature to day 21 prior to the exposure of a clinically relevant dose of bortezomib based on blood plasma levels (\nStaff et al., 2013\n), (\nJudge et al., 2017\n), (\nGeisler et al., 2019\n), (\nKarademir et al., 2018\n). Since proteasome inhibitors are known to prolong the half-lives of short-lived proteins (\nHakim et al., 2016\n), a timeframe of 48h was chosen for the duration of exposure. Blank and DMSO controls were included as a baseline for comparison. Samples were plated in triplicate for each condition and 4 experiments were completed for each iPSC line. At the time of harvest, technical replicates were combined into a single representative sample prior to cell lysate extraction. Cells were dissociated using Accutase and washed in PBS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, followed by centrifugation at 200 x g for 5 minutes. Cell pellets were flash frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\n2.3. Proteomics methodology & bioinformatic analyses\nA label-free shotgun approach guided subsequent sample preparation and has been described previously (\nAyers-Ringler et al., 2016\n). Cell pellets were lysed in buffer comprised of 1.2% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.2, HALT Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitors, and Benzonase Nuclease, and then cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes. Protein concentrations were measured by BCA assay. 20 ug protein from each sample was denatured and reduced with 2x Laemmli buffer containing 5% \u03b2ME for 10 minutes at 85\u00b0C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10.5-14% Criterion Tris-HCl gel, Bio-rad) and visualized with Bio-Safe Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 stain (Bio-rad). Samples were subdivided into 7 different fractions that represented different ranges of molecular weights. Proteins were digested into peptide fragments using trypsin prior to LC-MS/MS analysis, and MaxQuant software (version 1.5.2) was used in the identification and quantification of peptide fragments and proteins (\nZhang et al., 2013\n), (\nTyanova et al., 2016\n). For groups of proteins indistinguishable by LC-MS/MS, a minimum of two identifying peptides and a false discovery rate (FDR) of < 1% was required for inclusion in the differential protein expression profile. Protein level changes were based on quantifying differences in protein abundance. Protein intensities were log-transformed and normalized for batch effects. The normalization of protein intensities was modeled using a Gaussian-linked generalized linear model that used study parameters (collection time and experimental group) as independent variables. A separate background model was generated based on collection time as independent variable. An ANOVA test was used to detect significant changes in protein abundances between groups. Differential expression p-values were FDR corrected using Benjamini-Hochberg-Yekutieli procedure. The complete list of protein groups is included in\nSupplemental Table 2\n. Protein groups with an adjusted p < 0.05 and an absolute log\n2\nfold change \u2265 0.5 were considered significantly differentially expressed. DMSO exposure appeared to have minimal effects on the levels of most proteins, with 33 proteins that met significance thresholds with 0.05 < p < 0.001 (\nSupplemental Table 3\n). The complete list of proteins was analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) using default settings for appropriate cell and tissue sources associated with the nervous system (QIAGEN Redwood City, CA, USA;\nwww.qiagen.com/ingenuity\n) (\nKramer et al., 2014\n). Additional analysis of gene lists created by IPA was completed using the ClueGO application (version 2.5.4) within Cytoscape (version 3.7.1) (\nMlecnik et al., 2018\n).\n\n2.4. Microscopy & immunofluorescence staining\n2.4.1. Immunocytochemistry:\nCells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature, permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 minutes, incubated in SuperBlock Blocking Buffer for 2-4h, and stained overnight with primary antibodies. Antibody information is listed in\nSupplemental Table 1\n. The manufacturers\u2019 recommendations were followed for secondary (Alexa Fluor) antibody and DAPI staining. Cells were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade mountant.\n2.4.2. Mitochondrial tracking\nExperimental:\niSNs plated on Geltrex coated glass bottom dishes were treated with bortezomib or a DMSO vehicle for 24h, and then stained with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM, 20nM) for 30min prior to image acquisition. Each video consisted of 200 frames that were taken at intervals of 1.2s. Each frame was 212.5\u03bcm x 212.5\u03bcm with a resolution of 2.4 pixels/um. In each experiment, 2 \u2013 3 plates were prepared per condition, and 5 \u2013 7 videos were acquired per plate, all at 37\u00b0C. Three independent experiments were completed.\nAnalysis:\nVideos were imported into Fiji (\nSchindelin et al., 2012\n) and edited to exclude mitochondria contained outside of iSN neurites. Mitochondrial mobility was analyzed using the automated particle tracker TrackMate with an extension for the inclusion of additional track parameters (\nTinevez et al., 2017\n). The Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) detector was used to identify mitochondria according to a blob diameter of 3 microns, and the simple LAP (Linear Assignment Problem) algorithm was selected to model track parameters associated with each mitochondrion. Tracks < 5s in duration were eliminated prior subsequent analysis in R.\nAnalysis of track parameters for mobile mitochondria:\nIn order to determine the effects of bortezomib on the mitochondria that exhibit characteristics of axonal transport, mitochondria were subdivided into mobile and stationary populations. 15 videos collected for all three iSN lines in which > 98% mitochondria appeared to be stationary on the basis of displacement were used to determine thresholds that appropriately define the stationary fraction. The independent distance-related parameters of confinement ratio and maximum distance traveled provided the most accurate stratification between both populations (\nSupplementary Figure 2A\n). The confinement ratio (CR) is defined as the distance traveled from the initial position divided by the total distance traveled. The maximum distance traveled is the furthest distance traveled from the initial position throughout the duration of video acquisition. The mobile fraction of mitochondria was defined by a single threshold of CR > 0.25, and the track parameters for these mitochondria were compared to assess the dose-dependent effects of bortezomib. Analysis of the subset of mitochondria with CR > 0.5, and presumably more representative of axonal transport, indicated a greater reduction in the fraction of mitochondria at lower doses of bortezomib without significant effects on displacement or velocity (\nSupplemental figure 2C\n,\n2D\n).\n2.4.3. Analysis of MAP2, Tuj-1, and Rab6 staining:\nfluorescence intensities for MAP2 and neuronal specific Tuj-1 were determined by encircling whole cell bodies to obtain the WCB measurement and the interior portion of cell bodies for the ICB measurement using Zen 2.0 (blue edition) (Carl Zeiss AG). The interior portion was defined as the region of distinctively lower MAP2 and Tuj-1 fluorescence intensities in bortezomib-treated iSNs. The width between the ICB and WCB was approximately 1\u03bcm, and this measurement was used to define the corresponding ICB in control iSNs. Rab6 fluorescence intensities were based on the measurements determined for the ICB. Rab6 fluorescence intensities in the region exterior to the ICB but within the WCB were negligible.\n2.4.4. Microscopy:\nAll immunofluorescent images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 780 laser scanning confocal microscope using a C-Apochromat 40x/1.20 W Korr FCS M27 water immersion objective (Carl Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany)). Images were processed and analyzed for immunofluorescent intensities with ZEN software (Carl Zeiss AG, Version ZEN black 2.3, Oberkochen, Germany). For live cell imaging, cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO\n2\nin an LCI microscope top-stage incubation system (Live Cell Instrument, Model Chamlide TC-W system, CU-501 controller, and Model FC-9 (O\n2\n/CO\n2\n/N\n2\nmixer), Seoul, Korea). Laser power was set to 1-2% to minimize photobleaching.\n\n2.5. Westerns\nQuantification of specific proteins in cell lysates was determined by a Simple Western immunoassay using a Wes system and chemiluminescent detection (ProteinSimple, San Jose, California). Approximately 3ug cell lysate was loaded per capillary. Antibodies and other materials and reagents used for these assays are included those in\nSupplementary Table 1\n. Assays were visualized and analyzed in Compass software (version 3.1.7). Protein abundance was determined from the signal intensity (peak area). Unless indicated otherwise, GAPDH was used for the normalization of protein levels within each sample. Discrepancies in protein mobility in blot images arose from incompatibilities between the protein lysis and assay buffers and were accentuated in assays for the 2-40kDa size range.\n\n2.6. Statistical analyses (R)\nStatistical analyses were completed using R (version 3.6.1) (\nwww.R-project.org\n). Statistical significance was determined from a Student's\nt\n-test for pairwise comparisons. An ANOVA test was used to detect significant differences between groups. Tukey's multiple comparison test was used to determine significance among the conditions tested for the mitochondrial tracking experiments. P < 0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Animal Preparation and Intracerebral Infusion\nThe University of Michigan Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the protocols of all animals. The reporting of the in vivo experiments with this study complies with ARRIVE guidelines. Animals were randomized to either an odd or even number. A total of 133 mice ages 2 to 3 months old were obtained for the experiment. A single male wild-type (WT) mouse died at day 7 after intracerebral injection extracellular PRX-2 and was therefore excluded from this study. LCN-2 KO and LCN-2 HET mice came from the U of M Breeding Core, while C57BL/6 WT mice came from Charles River Laboratories (Roanoke, IL).\nMice were anesthetized using ketamine (90 mg/kg)/xylazine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) and their body temperature was maintained at 37.5 \u00b0C as described previously\n9\n. The mice were fixed to a stereotaxic frame (Model 500; Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). A drill was used to create a cranial burr hole (1 mm) close to the right coronal suture, 2.5 mm lateral to the midline. A microinfusion pump was used to inject recombinant rat PRX-2 (10 \u03bcl, 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl, Novus biological, NBP2\u201352150) with or without recombinant mouse LCN-2 protein (1\u03bcg, R&D System) into the right basal ganglia at a speed of 1.5 \u03bcl/min using the following coordinates: 0.2 mm anterior, 3.5 mm ventral and 2.5 mm lateral to the bregma. The animals used for the control were injected with 10-\u03bcL saline. Co-injections of recombinant mouse LCN-2 (1 \u03bcg) in male LCN-2 KO mice (e.g. LCN-2 replacement) were used to further examine the potential role of LCN-2 in PRX-2 induced brain injury. In our previous study, intracaudate injection of 1\u03bcg LCN2 into LCN2 knockout mice did not cause marked brain injury but enhanced thrombin-induced brain damage\n9\n. The needle was kept in place for 10 minutes to restrict backflow and then withdrawn. Bone wax was used to fill the hole and sutures were used to close the skin incision.\n\nExperimental Groups\nThis study included three parts. Animals were randomized to either an odd or even number. In the first part, male WT mice (n=12) received an intracerebral injection of 10\u03bcl saline, while male LCN-2 KO mice (n=18), LCN-2 HET mice (n=18), and WT mice (n=18) received an intracerebral injection of 10 \u03bcl PRX-2. Following MRI and behavioral testing on day 1, 12 saline control mice and 10 mice in each of the LCN-2 KO, LCN-2 HET, and WT PRX-2 groups were euthanized for brain histology and Western blotting. The remaining 8 mice in the LCN-2 KO, LCN-2 HET, and WT PRX-2 groups underwent behavioral testing on days 3, 7, and 14 and had a MRI on the day 14 before being euthanized for brain histology.\nIn the second part, male LCN-2 KO mice (n=8 each group) received an intracerebral injection of 10 \u03bcl PRX-2 with 1 \u03bcg recombinant mouse LCN-2 protein or vehicle. Male WT mice (n=8) had only 10 \u03bcl PRX-2 with vehicle. Behavioral tests and MRI were performed at day 1 before the mice were euthanized for brain histology.\nIn the third part, female LCN-2 KO mice (n=14), LCN-2 HET mice (n=14), and WT mice (n=14) received an intracerebral injection of 10 \u03bcl PRX-2. Following MRI and behavioral testing on day 1, 6 mice in each of the LCN-2 KO, LCN-2 HET, and WT groups were euthanized for brain histology. The remaining 8 mice in each of the groups received behavioral tests on days 1, 3, 7, and 14. MRI was obtained on day 14. The mice were then euthanized for histology.\n\nMRI and Brain Swelling/Atrophy Measurement\nT2- weighted MRIs were performed using a 9.4-T Varian MR scanner (183-mm horizontal bore; Varian, Palo Alto, CA) on days 1 and 14, as described preciously\n9\n,\n15\n. A blinded investigator measured all MRI images using NIH ImageJ. Brain swelling (ventricular compression) calculations at day 1 were based on every other third section around the needle tract. The value was calculated as follows: [(contralateral ventricular volume\u2212ipsilateral ventricular volume)/contralateral ventricular volume] \u00d7 100%. Brain atrophy was measured at day 14 by two methods. 1) Enlargement of the ipsilateral ventricle: [(ipsilateral ventricular volume-contralateral ventricular volume)/contralateral ventricular volume] \u00d7 100%; and 2) Hemisphere brain tissue loss: [(contralateral hemisphere \u2013 ipsilateral hemisphere)/contralateral hemisphere] x 100%.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence Double Staining\nImmunostaining was performed as previously described\n15\n,\n16\n. Mice brains were sliced into 18\u03bcm sections on a cryostat. For immunohistochemistry, the primary antibodies (Ab) were goat anti-lipocalin 2 (1:200 Dilution, B&D Systems), goat anti-Iba-1(1:200 dilution, abcam), rabbit anti myeloperoxidase IgG (1:200 dilution, Thermo Fisher). Negative controls omitted the primary Ab. We selected three different areas in each region from every other section in high-power images (\u00d740 magnification) for counting (expressed as cells/mm\n2\n). All measurements were repeated 3 times using ImageJ by a blinded investigator\n1\n,\n17\n.\nFor immunofluorescence double staining, the primary Abs were goat anti-lipocalin 2 (1:200 dilution, B&D Systems), polyclonal rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; astrocyte marker; 1:400 dilution, Millipore, Billerica), rabbit anti myeloperoxidase (MPO; neutrophil marker; 1:200 dilution, Thermo Fisher), rabbit anti-Iba-1 IgG (microglia /macrophage marker; 1:200 dilution, Proteintech), rabbit anti-von Willebrand factor (vWF; endothelial marker; 1:200 dilution, Sigma), polyclonal rabbit anti-neuronal specific nuclear protein (NeuN; 1:500 dilution, Abcam). Secondary Abs were Alexa Fluro 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat mAb (1:500 dilution, Invitrogen), Alexa Fluro 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit mAb (1:500 dilution, Invitrogen). Negative controls excluded the primary Ab.\n\nFluoro-Jade C Staining\nFluoro-Jade C Staining was used to assess neuronal death. Brain sections were stained with Fluoro-Jade C (Millipore, AG325) as previously described\n18\n. Briefly, a digital camera was used to take three high-power images (\u00d740 magnification) around the ipsilateral basal ganglia injection site. All measurements were repeated 3 times using ImageJ by a blinded investigator.\n\nWestern Blot Analysis\nWestern blot analysis was performed as described previously\n19\n. Briefly, mice were perfused with pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.1mmol/L) after euthanasia. Then samples of the contralateral and ipsilateral basal ganglia tissues were obtained. The concentrations of protein were calculated using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Hercules, CA) and 30 \u03bcg protein of each sample was used for the Western blot analysis. The primary Abs were polyclonal goat anti-LCN2 (R&D System, 1:200 dilution), and rabbit anti-\u03b2-actin (1:20000, dilution, Cell Signaling). The secondary Abs were rabbit anti-goat IgG (Bio-Rad, 1:2000 dilution) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad, 1:5000 dilution). Western blots were analyzed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham) followed by exposure to Kodak X-OMAT film. Analysis of the relative densities of bands was obtained using NIH Image J. LCN-2 protein levels were normalized with beta-actin.\n\nCell Counting\nCell counting of brain coronal sections was obtained by a blinded investigator, as previously described\n5\n. Three brain locations in the ipsilateral and contralateral caudate were observed using high power images (\u00d7 40 magnification). Three slides from each brain were obtained; each slide contained three fields of interest were digitized. Mean values were obtained from three repeated measurements.\n\nBehavioral Tests\nForelimb use asymmetry and corner turn tests were performed for behavioral assessment as our previous study elaborated\n20\n. For the forelimb use asymmetry test, we observed the forelimb use of mice in a standing transparent cylinder. We recorded the numbers of times the ipsilateral forelimb (A), the contralateral forelimb (B), and both forelimbs (C) were used by the mice to explore the sides of the cylinder. Forelimb use asymmetry scores were calculated as follows: forelimb use asymmetry score=[A/(A+B+C)]-[B/(A+B+C)]. For the corner turn test, mice was allowed to move forward into a corner whose angle was 30\u00b0. The mice could turn either left or right. The percentage of right turns was calculated after repeating the test 10 times. All animals received behavioral tests before surgery and at days 1, 3, 7, and 14 after surgery. Both tests were performed by an investigator blinded to the study.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nResults are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. The data was analyzed using Student\u2019s t test, or one-way ANOVA tests using a Tukey post hoc test. Significant levels were set at P < 0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals.\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Envigo Inc., (Indianapolis, IN) and housed on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle at 22\u00b0C and 40% humidity with food and water available\nad libitum\n. In brief, 3 wk old rats were allowed to acclimate to the vivarium for ~1 week prior to placing them in the hypoxic chamber for an additional 2 days of acclimation, after which animals were exposed to 10 days intermittent hypoxia or normoxia. The age of rats was guided by our previous studies demonstrating significant changes in synaptic plasticity by CIH in autonomic nervous system nuclei at this age (\nKline et al., 2007\n,\n2010\n,\n2019\n). All experiments were conducted following the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals guidelines and protocols were approved by the University of Missouri Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nExposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia.\nRats exposed to CIH inspired alternating cycles of 21 and 6% O\n2\n, 10 episodes per hour, 8 hr per day between 0900\u2013 1700 for 10 days as described previously (\nKline, 2010\n;\nKline et al., 2007\n;\nKline et al., 2019\n). IH was induced by flushing the chamber with alternating cycles of oxygen and nitrogen for 3 min each, which resulted in an inspired oxygen of 6% for ~45 sec. O\n2\nmeasurements and rate of flow occurred via a negative feedback system (Biospherix, Richmond NY). CIH rats were housed in standard rat cages within a clear Lucite chamber with ambient O\n2\n, CO\n2\n, temperature, and humidity levels continuously monitored. Normoxic animals consisted of rats only exposed to alternating cycles of room air for exposure to similar air movement and sounds. Normoxia or CIH exposed rats were housed no more than 5 rats per cage. All experiments were conducted the morning following the last hypoxic exposure.\n\nMeasurement of arterial blood pressure and heart rate.\nFollowing 10d CIH or their normoxic controls, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 2% maintenance, in 100% O\n2\n). A femoral arterial catheter (PE-10 fused to PE-50, A-M Systems, Sequim, WA, USA) was implanted for measurement of arterial pressure and heart rate (HR), which was connected to a bridge amplifier via the Harvard Apparatus Small Animal Physiological Monitoring System (Holliston, MA). The signal was also sent to a PowerLab system (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs CO) where the pulsatile arterial pressure signal was used to determine mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). MAP and HR was determined after 30 minutes of stable parameters for a 5-minute period.\n\nRT-PCR.\nThe relative expression of mRNA for alpha-adrenergic receptor (\nAdra\n) subtypes was examined as previously in the PVN (\nColdren et al., 2015\n). Norm and 10d CIH-exposed rats were anesthetized with isoflurane, rapidly decapitated and the brain was flash frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until used. One mm-thick coronal sections of the forebrain were taken and a section containing the region of the PVN was identified by comparison to a standard rat brain atlas (\nPaxinos and Watson, 1997\n). The optic tracts were visualized (ventrolateral surface) and punches of the PVN were collected bilaterally (20G blunt needle) lateral to the top of the 3\nrd\ncerebral ventricle. RNA was then isolated using the RNAqueous-Micro RNA isolation kit (Ambion, Life Technologies) and RNAse-Free DNAse Set (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was generated from 100 ng of RNA using SuperScript III First-Strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). Real-time RT-PCR amplification of 2 \u03bcL of cDNA was performed in triplicate for the reference gene\nGapdh\nand\nAdra\nsubtypes 1a, 1b, 1d, 2a, 2b using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq kit (Takara, Mountain View, CA) and the SmartCycler II System (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). Primers (10 \u03bcM) were designed by Real Time Primers (Elkins Park, PA) and sequences are shown in\nTable 1\n. Relative expression was calculated using the 2\n\u2212\u0394\u0394CT\nmethod (\nLivak and Schmittgen, 2001\n;\nMatott et al., 2020\n). To determine effects of CIH on expression within each\nAdra\nsubtype, mRNA following CIH was determined relative to Norm. To compare expression of the different subtypes relative to each other, expression of all\nAdra\nsubtypes was calculated relative to the\nAdra\n1a subtype within the Norm and CIH groups.\nTable 1:\nQuantitative Real Time PCR Primer Sequences\nGene\nNCBI ref seq\nForward 5\u2019\u2013 3\u2019\nReverse 5\u2019\u2013 3\u2019\nGAPDH\nnm_017008\nAGACAGCCGCATCTTCTTGT\nCTTGCCGTGGGTAGAGTCAT\nAdra1a\nnm_017191\nACTGGCCATCATTCTGGTTA\nATTCTTGGCACTGCTGACTC\nAdra1b\nnm_016991\nCGCATCTTCTGTGACATCTG\nGAGATGACCGTGGACAAGAC\nAdra1d\nnm_024483\nGGAAAAGATCCGTGGACAGT\nAGCGGAAGAGCAACAGATTT\nAdra2a\nnm_012739\nTTACCTCCCCTTGCTTTTCT\nTGAGCAACAAGTGCTGACAT\nAdra2b\nnm_138505\nAGAGGTTCACCTTTGTGCTG\nCGGTGTAGATGACAGGGTTC\nOpen in a new tab\n\nImmunohistochemical staining.\nAfter exposure to normoxia or CIH, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with 0.01 M PBS solution (pH\u2009=\u20097.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, 250 ml, pH\u2009=\u20097.4, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), and the brain were removed. Tissue was post-fixed in 4% PFA and placed in PBS, after which the PVN was sectioned at 30 \u03bcm in the coronal plane with a vibratome. Sections were rinsed (3 \u00d7 10 min PBS), blocked [30 min, 10% normal donkey serum (NDS) in 0.3% Triton-PBS], and 1 in every 6 consecutive sections (\nRuyle et al., 2018\n) incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with an antibody against dopamine-\u03b2-hydroxylase (D\u03b2H, mouse anti-D\u03b2H, 1:2000, MAB 308, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) in PBS containing 0.3% Triton and 3% NDS. Following a rinse, slices were then incubated for 2h in a Cy2-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA) in 3% NDS and 0.3% Triton X-100\u2013PBS. After a final PBS rinse, sections were mounted on 0.5% gelatin-coated slides, placed in the dark to dry then coverslipped with Prolong Diamond (\nP36970\n, ThermoScientific Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA,) and sealed with nail polish. An upright fluorescence microscope (BX51, Olympus America, Inc., Melville, NY, U.S.A.) equipped with an ORCA-ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, K.K., Hamamatsu City, Japan) visualized and acquired D\u03b2H-immunoreactivity. Staining through multiple plans (0.5 \u03bcm step per layer) was obtained by a spinning disk confocal unit (Olympus). Analysis of D\u03b2H terminals occurred as described by\nThorsdottir et al. (2019)\nusing FIJI Image J. Two regions of interests (ROI, 150 \u00d7 150 \u03bcm) in the dorsal portion of the PVN that spanned the area in which we recorded was isolated and deconvolved (Parallel Spectral Deconvolution by Piotr Wendykier) to eliminate out of focus fluorescence. Images were processed with a Gaussian filter followed by automatic Triangle thresholding and particle analysis. The individual z-stack section which possessed the highest values within each stack was used for analysis. Within each Norm and CIH rat, the values for the individual ROIs were similar and thus averaged together.\n\nIn vitro brain slice PVN preparation.\nSimilar to our previous PVN study (\nDantzler et al., 2019\n), rats were decapitated under 5% isoflurane anesthesia and the forebrain containing the hypothalamus was quickly removed and placed in ice-cold N\u2010methyl\u2010D\u2010glucamine (NMDG) cutting solution (in mM: 93 NMDG, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 10 MgSO\n4\n, 30 NaHCO\n3\n, 20 HEPES, 25 D\u2010glucose, 5 L\u2010ascorbic acid, 2 thiourea, 3 sodium pyruvate and 0.5 CaCl\n2\n, aerated with 95% O\n2\n+ 5% CO\n2\n, pH\u2019d to 7.4 with ~93 HCl, 300\u2013310 mOsmol l\n\u22121\n). The hypothalamus was blocked based on the rostral-caudal landmarks of the optic tract. Coronal sections (\u223c280 \u03bcm) containing the PVN (from \u22121.5 to \u22122.1 mm relative to Bregma) were generated with a vibratome (VT 1000S, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Slices recovered at 35\u00b0C for 12 min in NMDG\u2010cutting solution and then transferred to room temperature recording aCSF that was used throughout the study (in mM: 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.2 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.2 MgSO\n4\n, 25 NaHCO\n3\n, 11 D\u2010glucose, 0.4 L\u2010ascorbic acid and 2 CaCl\n2\n, aerated with 95% O\n2\n+ 5% CO\n2\n, pH 7.4, 300\u2013310 mOsmol l\n\u22121\n). After at least 30 minutes of rest, a single PVN slice was transferred to a heated submerged recording chamber, secured with a nylon mesh harp, and superfused with recording aCSF at 32\u201335\u00b0C. Slices were acclimated to temperature and superfusion flow for another 15\u201330 min prior to recording.\nNeurons were visualized on an Olympus BX51WI fixed stage upright microscope with DIC optics. Recording electrodes (3\u20136 M\u03a9) were pulled from borosilicate glass and filled with (in mM) 130 potassium gluconate, 10 NaCl, 11 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl\n2\n, 1 CaCl\n2\n, 2 MgATP and 0.2 NaGTP. Electrodes were positioned using a piezoelectric micromanipulator (PCS-6000, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ, USA). Signals were filtered at 2 kHz and acquired at 10 kHz using a Digidata 1440 interface and MultiClamp 700B amplifier controlled by Clampex 10 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).\n\nElectrophysiological protocols and analysis.\nRecordings focused on PVN parvocellular neurons in the dorsal subnuclei (\nDantzler et al., 2019\n;\nMilanick et al., 2019\n;\nRuyle et al., 2019\n), identified by its location lateral to the 3\nrd\nventricle, dorsal and rostral to the medial magnocellular neurons, when the optic tract moves lateral (\nPaxinos and Watson, 1997\n). Recorded neurons lacked large A-type transient K\n+\ncurrents and bursting discharge, and in some neurons possessed transient low threshold spikes, suggestive of generalized type II neurons (\nLuther and Tasker, 2000\n;\nStern, 2001\n;\nTasker and Dudek, 1991\n). To examine synaptic currents, neurons were voltage clamped at \u221260 mV, the chloride reversal potential under our recording conditions, and recorded in gap-free mode. All electrophysiological properties were analyzed in Clampfit v.10.6 (Molecular Devices, LLC., San Jose, CA, U.S.A.) and Microsoft Office Excel v.2016. Cells were excluded from analysis if initial membrane potential was more depolarized than \u221240 mV. Spontaneous and miniature EPSC frequency and amplitude was detected via template search algorithm in Clampfit. We utilized a balanced design so that each experiment included multiple animals. Each neuron reported in a figure originated from a unique rat and each cell was only exposed to a single agonist.\n\nDrugs used in recording.\nRecorded neurons were exposed to 5 minutes of baseline aCSF followed by adrenergic receptor agonists and/or antagonists for 5 minutes and followed by aCSF wash. Each rat and slice was only exposed to a single agonist, while some neurons had Pz + NE. Synaptic currents were analyzed for 30 seconds at the end of each 5-minute baseline or drug period. The following adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists were bath applied at concentrations based on previous studies: Norepinephrine [NE, 10 & 100 \u03bcM, (\nDaftary et al., 1998\n;\nDaftary et al., 2000\n;\nLuther et al., 2002\n)], the \u03b1\n1\n-AR agonist Phenylephrine [PE, 100 \u03bcM (\nChen et al., 2006\n)], and the \u03b1\n1\n-AR antagonist Prazosin [Pz, 10 \u03bcM, (\nDaftary et al., 2000\n)]. In recordings examining miniature (m) EPSCs, the bath solution contained tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 \u03bcM) to block voltage gated sodium channels, and Gabazine (25 \u03bcM) to antagonize GABA\nA\nreceptors (\nLuther et al., 2002\n;\nMatott and Kline, 2016\n;\nPalma et al., 2007\n). All drugs were purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Minneapolis, MN) and Sigma-Aldrich (St. Luis MO). All other compounds were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Hampton, NH).\n\nStatistical analysis.\nAll data was checked for normality and tests were run with GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software). MAP and HR was compared between Norm and CIH via unpaired t-test. Within the Norm and CIH groups, \u03b1-AR subtype expression was examined relative to expression of the \u03b1\n1a\nsubtype via 1-way repeated measures (RM) ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc test. Within a given\nAdra\nsubunit, Norm vs CIH was compared via two-tailed t-test. Outliers were identified in some RT-PCR data via Grubbs test, and if not normally distributed compared via Mann-Whitney test. Immunohistochemistry D\u03b2H terminal density was compared via two-tailed t-test. Synaptic transmission during aCSF, NE, PE, and/or Pz treatments within and between Norm and CIH groups was examined via two-way RM ANOVA followed by post-hoc Bonferroni analysis. Two-tailed unpaired t-tests (unequal variance) or one-way ANOVA with Fishers LSD was used to compare the magnitude of effect of NE, PE, Pz treatment between Norm or CIH groups. The magnitude of response to a given adrenergic receptor treatment (e.g., NE) was calculated from its prior aCSF and presented as a percentage (e.g., NE-aCSF/aCSF \u00d7100). P < 0.05 was considered significant. Data is shown as group means \u00b1 standard error of the mean. \u201cN\u201d denotes number of animals, \u201cn\u201d denotes number of neurons."

    "Methods": "2.1. Traumatic brain injury and delayed hypoxemia\nAll procedures were approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee and are consistent with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of animals. Animals were housed 5/cage and had free access to water and food with 12-h light/dark cycle. C57BL/6J 8-week old male mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were used in all experiments. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane at induction, followed by maintenance at 2% isoflurane for the duration of the procedure. Buprenorphine sustained release (0.5 mg/kg subcutaneously, Zoopharm, Windsor, CO) was administered prior to scalp incision. The head was shaved and ear bars were used to stabilize the head within the stereotaxic frame (MyNeurolab, St. Louis, MO). Then, a single 5-mm craniectomy was performed by an electric drill on the left lateral side of the skull centered 2.7 mm lateral from the midline and 3 mm anterior to lambda. For long-term behavioral studies, animals were randomized to sham or injury after craniectomy using a computer-generated numbers randomization. For injured animals, the 3-mm electromagnetic impactor tip was then aligned with the craniectomy site at 1.2 mm left of midline, 1.5mm anterior to the lambda suture. The impact was then delivered at 2 mm depth (velocity 5 m/s, dwell time 100 ms). All animals then received a loose fitting 7 mm plastic cap secured over the craniectomy with Vetbond (3M, St. Paul, MN). The skin was closed with interrupted sutures and treated with antibiotic ointment before removing the mouse from anesthesia and allowing recovery on a warming pad. One day after surgery, animals who had undergone CCI experienced hypoxemia (8% O\n2\n, 4% CO\n2\n) for 60 minutes in a Coy labs Hypoxia Chamber (Coy Laboratory, Grass Lake, MI). A mixture of N\n2\n, O\n2\n, and CO\n2\nwas utilized to maintain normocarbic hypoxemia. Sham animals did not experience hypoxemia and were placed in cages directly next to the chamber while injured animals were in hypoxia chamber. After hypoxemia, sham and CCI littermates were returned to the same cage. All animals were subjected to identical transport and handling regardless of group assignment throughout all experiments.\n\n2.2. Glutathione measurements\n15 mice were randomized to sham, CCI or CCI + hypoxemia conditions. Four hours after hypoxemia, mice were euthanized under isoflurane anesthesia and transcardially perfused with cold 0.3% heparin in phosphate-buffered saline. Whole brains were removed and homogenized with cold phosphate buffer and then centrifuged at 14,000 G at 4 \u00b0C for 15 minutes. Supernatant was mixed with equal volume of 5% metaphosphoric acid and total glutathione was measured using a commercially available assay kit (Enzo Life Sciences, PA, USA). Protein concentration was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, IL, USA). Total glutathione was expressed as nanomole/mg protein.\n\n2.3. N-acetylcysteine administration\nPrevious preclinical studies have reported efficacy with dosing ranging from 150 \u2013300 mg/kg/day with 150 mg/kg/day for 1\u20133 days after injury the most common dosing utilized. (\nBhatti et al., 2017\n;\nDu et al., 2013\n;\nThomale et al., 2005\n,\n2006\n). We designed a two-step funnel design for two different dosing regimens of NAC with an initial evaluation of efficacy using short-term neuropathology followed by selecting the more efficacious dosing for long-term behavioral outcome studies. We chose two dosing regimens that were either the most commonly reported (150 mg/kg/day) or the highest dosing utilized in rodents (300 mg/kg/day) (\nBhatti et al., 2017\n;\nDu et al., 2013\n;\nNaziroglu et al., 2014\n). On post injury day 1, 2 hours prior to hypoxemia, animals were randomized to receive NAC (Sigma, St Louis, MO) 150 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg or saline vehicle via intraperitoneal injection (IP). NAC was dissolved in sterile saline at a concentration of 30 mg/mL (150 mg/kg dosing) or 60 mg/mL (300 mg/kg dosing). Control animals received an equal volume by weight of sterile saline. Mice were weighed each day to determine dose. One cohort of mice (N=10 for each group) were euthanized 24 hours after hypoxemia. An additional cohort (N=10 for each group) received a second and third dose on post-injury days 2 and 3 and euthanized on post-injury day 4.\n\n2.4. Immunohistochemistry\nMice were killed under isoflurane anesthesia by transcardial perfusion with cold 0.3% heparin in phosphate-buffered saline. Whole brains were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 48 hours, followed by equilibration in 30% sucrose for at least 48 hours before sectioning. Serial 50 \u03bcm thick coronal slices were cut on a freezing microtome starting with the appearance of a complete corpus callosum and caudally to bregma \u22123.08 mm. Cresyl violet staining was performed on slices mounted on glass slides. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on free-floating sections washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) between applications of primary and secondary antibodies. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubating the tissue in TBS + 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. Normal goat serum (3%) in TBS with 0.25% Triton X (TBS-X) was used to block nonspecific staining for all antibodies. Slices were then incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight with one of the following primary antibodies: polyclonal rabbit anti-\u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2-APP; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at a concentration of 1:1000, polyclonal rabbit anti-neuronal nuclei (NeuN; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) at a concentration of 1:4000, or polyclonal rabbit anti-ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1; Wako Chemicals USA, Richmond, VA) at a concentration of 1:1000. Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in TBS-X were used at a 1:1000 concentration to detect bound primary antibodies. Colorization was achieved using the Vectastain ABC Elite Kit (Vector Laboratories) followed by the application of 3\u20133\u2019-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).\n\n2.5. Quantification of immunohistochemistry\nThe extent of tissue loss of the ipsilateral hemisphere for each animal was quantified utilizing cresyl violet stained slices acquired using a Zeiss AxioScan ZI microscope system (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, White Plains, NY). Tissue loss in the injured hemisphere was calculated as a percentage of the tissue volume in the contralateral hemisphere as described by others (\nHuh and Raghupathi, 2007\n). Stereological analysis was performed using Stereo Investigator software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, Vermont). Assessments were made by an investigator blinded to group assignment. The optical fractionator function was used to quantify target markers per cubic millimeter of tissue and every 6\nth\nsection was analyzed. For quantification of axonal injury a grid size of 250 \u00d7 250 \u03bcm, a counting frame of 40 \u00d7 40 \u03bcm, and a dissector height of 15 \u03bcm with a guard zone of 3 \u03bcm were used as previously described (\nParikh et al., 2016\n). The ipsilateral corpus callosum and external capsule spanning 12 sections starting with the appearance of a complete corpus callosum and caudally to bregma 3.08 mm were used as the ROI. Injured axons were identified by \u03b2-APP-positive varicosities greater than 5 \u03bcm. A grid size of 125 \u00d7 125 \u03bcm and a counting frame of 25 \u00d7 25 \u03bcm was used for stereological quantification of NeuN positive cells in the pyramidal layer of CA3 region of the ipsilateral hippocampus. For stereological quantification of Iba-1 positive cells in the CA3 region of the ipsilateral hippocampus, the optical fractionator function was again used, with a grid size of 180 \u00d7 180 \u03bcm and a counting frame of 80 \u00d7 80 \u03bcm. Gunderson\u2019s coefficients of error were <0.1 for all stereological quantifications.\n\n2.6. Behavioral studies\nAnimals underwent behavioral testing 6 months after sham surgery or CCI. A total of 30 male mice underwent long-term behavioral testing divided into 2 groups of 15 animals spaced 6 weeks apart to facilitate completing of surgeries and daily behavioral testing. In each group, 3 animals were randomized to sham surgery and 12 animals randomized to CCI. On post-injury day 1, injured animals were randomized to NAC 150 mg/kg IP or an equivalent volume of normal saline and received subsequent doses on post-injury day 2 and 3. All tests were conducted by an experimenter blinded to group assignment. The order of tests was as follows: novel object recognition, Barnes maze, 3 chamber social interaction, and fear conditioning with each test performed 1 week apart (\nFigure 1\n). Prior to each testing day, animals were acclimated to the testing room for 1 hour. For novel object recognition and 3 chamber social interaction test ambient light was maintained at 20 lux. All behavior tests were recorded and analyzed with Smart video tracking software (Harvard Apparatus/Panlab Holliston, MA). One animal from the vehicle and one animal from the NAC treated group died on post-operative day #1 and did not undergo behavioral testing.\nFigure 1: Total glutathione depletion is exacerbated by delayed hypoxemia.\nOpen in a new tab\nTotal glutathione measured 1 day after controlled cortical impact (CCI) and 4 hours after delayed hypoxemia. ANOVA F\n(2,12)\n= 131.3, p < 0.0001. * p < 0.05. ANOVA followed by\npost hoc\ntukey tests.\n2.6.1. Novel object recognition test\nNovel object recognition (NOR) testing occurred over 4 consecutive days as adapted from previous reports (\nAkkerman et al., 2012\n;\nLeger et al., 2013\n). Animals were acclimated to handling and the behavior testing room the day prior to initiation of testing. Day 1 and 2 consisted of 5 minutes of open field testing. On Day 3 two identical objects were placed in the open field and mice were allowed to explore the arena for 10 minutes. On Day 4, one of the objects was randomly removed and replaced with a novel object. Mice were allowed to explore the arena for 10 minutes. We calculated the Discrimination Index (DI), to measure the discrimination between the novel and familiar objects; the exploration time for novel object (TN) was divided by the total amount of time interacting with the novel and familiar objects (TF): %DI = (100 \u00d7 TN)/(TN + TF).\n2.6.2. Barnes maze\nBarnes maze was adapted from previous reports (\nKoopmans et al., 2003\n;\nPompl et al., 1999\n). Ambient light on the Barnes maze was set at 2300 lux as an averse stimulus. Mice were acclimated to the escape box for 2 minutes prior to testing on Day 1. Each mouse underwent 2 trials per day for 5 consecutive days. Maximum time allowed for each trial was 5 minutes. At the start of each trial, a 75 db 2 kHz tone was activated and continued until the mouse either entered the escape box or 5 minutes had elapsed. Total distance prior to entering the escape box was recorded. On Day 5, 2 hours after the final trial, the escape box was removed and each mouse underwent a 90 second probe trial. Percentage of time spent in a zone encompassing the hole where the escape box was and the adjacent holes on either side was measured.\n2.6.3. Three chamber social interaction\nThree chamber social interaction was performed as previously described (\nMoy et al., 2004\n). Animals were singly housed for 24 hours prior to testing. Stimulus mice were acclimated for 5 minutes to the wire cups prior testing. Empty wire cups were placed in the lateral chambers and both doors were open while the test mouse was allowed to explore the apparatus for 10 minutes. The test mouse was placed in the middle chamber and the doors were then closed to prevent exploration. A stimulus mouse was randomly placed in one of the wire cups and a dummy toy mouse was placed in the other. Both doors were then opened simultaneously and the mouse was allowed to explore for 10 minutes. Finally the dummy mouse was replaced with another stimulus mouse and the test mouse was allowed to explore for another 10 minutes. The amount of time the test mouse spent with familiar and stranger mouse was recorded.\n2.6.4. Fear conditioning\nEvaluation of fear memory was adapted from previous reports utilizing the Ugo Basile fear conditioning system (Gemonio, Italy) (\nBalogh et al., 2002\n;\nKlemenhagen et al., 2013\n;\nWehner and Radcliffe, 2004\n). On Day 1, mice were first exposed to 3 pairings of 30 second tones (75 dB, 2 KHz) with an electric shock (0.5 mA) for the final 2 seconds of the tone. On Day 2, the same context is used without tone or shock and the percentage of freezing time in 30 second epochs was measured to assess contextual fear memory. On Day 3, the chamber walls and floor were changed to alter the context and the mice experienced the same three 30 second tones without shocks and the percentage of freezing time in 30 seconds epochs was again measured to assess cued fear memory.\n\n2.7. Statistical analysis\nAll data for each animal was entered and tracked utilizing a REDCap database to maintain data integrity (\nHarris et al., 2009\n). For initial short-term studies, experiments were powered to detect a 30% difference between vehicle control and NAC treated animals. For long-term behavior studies, experiments were powered to detect a 33% improvement in performance of NAC treated mice compared with vehicle controls. Sham animals were utilized to assess consistency between cohorts. Data was assessed for normal distribution with Shapiro Wilk test. All error bars represent standard error of the mean. Student t test, Mann Whitney U test, or one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for histological data and behavioral data when appropriate. For Barnes maze, data were found to have normal distribution and a repeated measures two way ANOVA was performed. All analysis was performed with Statistica v13.3 (TIBCO software. Palo Alto, CA)."

    "Methods": "gp120 transgenic (Tg) mice\nBreeder mice expressing the HIV gp120\nIIIB\nenvelope protein driven by the GFAP promoter(\nToggas et al., 1994\n) were kindly provided by Dr. Marcus Kaul who has characterized the development of neuropathology in the mice(\nKaul et al., 2007\n). Mice were bred at the University of North Carolina and experiments were conducted under an approved IACUC protocol in an ALAC certified facility. All mice were genotyped at weaning and randomly separated into treatment groups. Wild type littermates were used as controls. Since small numbers of mice homozygous for gp120 were obtained, heterozygous male and female mice were used in the experiments. Three major treatment groups were designated to assess the interaction of the gp120 phenotype with age: young mice (3\u20138 months), middle aged mice (12\u201316 months) and old mice (19\u201323 months). Males and females negative for the gp120 transgene (Wild Type, WT) were included as controls for each experiment.\nMice were dosed once daily with 50 mg/kg LM11A-31 bisulfate or vehicle (water) by oral gavage. The compound was prepared at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in sterile deionized water. Mice in the middle aged and old groups were treated for 3 months ending at the indicated times with some variation in the start times depending on mouse availability. After the last dose, each mouse was euthanized by the isoflurane drop method in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and perfused with 0.01 M PBS. The brain was removed and split in the sagittal plane. One half was fixed in phosphate buffered 4% paraformaldehyde and the other half frozen.\n\nTissue preparation and staining\nThe fixed brain was embedded in paraffin and sagittal sections were cut at 5 \u03bcm for subsequent staining. Sections were deparaffinized, incubated for 25 min in 1% H\n2\nO\n2\nand gently boiled for 20 min in 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 6.0 to unmask antigen. Sections were then washed 3x in PBS and incubated in 3% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Immunostaining was performed for MAP-2 (EMD Millipore AB5622, MAB 3418, Aves, MAP), Iba1 (Wako, 019\u20131941), GFAP (DAKO, Z0334), Tau-1 (EMD Millipore, MAB 3420), Tau T22 (EMD Millipore, ABN 454), p75\nNTR\n(EMD Millipore, AB 1554, 07\u2013476) and parvalbumin (Swant PV25, Sigma P3088). In addition, staining was done with antibodies to amyloid beta (EMD Millipore, MAB 348), phospho-Tau (AT8, Biolegend,137401), and C1q (Abcam, ab182451) but no positive staining was found (not shown). A thioflavin T stain to identify plaque-like material was also negative (not shown). For the primary comparisons, changes in immunostaining were compared between the gp120 Tg mice treated with LM11A-31 versus placebo.\n\nIsolation and culture of human monocyte-derived macrophages\nHuman monocyte-derived macrophages were used to generate conditioned medium that would mimic the effects of inflammation in vitro. De-identified human buffy coat leukocytes were purchased and shipped within 24 hours after blood draw from healthy donors at the New York Blood Center (\nhttp://nybloodcenter.org/\n), a non-profit organization specifically for the collection and distribution of blood for clinical and research purposes. The proposed research was screened and approved by the New York Blood Center prior to initiation of the studies. Blood was diluted 1:1 with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) centrifuged at 500 X g for 20 min over Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare 17\u20131440-03) and the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from the interface. PBMCs were washed for 10 min with 10 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer to remove any red blood cell contamination, diluted to 40 ml with PBS and centrifuged at 100 X g for 15 min. After a second wash, the supernatant was aspirated and the pellet re-suspended in Dulbecco\u2019s modified eagle medium (DMEM) with high glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco 160000\u2013044) and 20 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin (Gibco 15750\u201360). Cells were seeded into ultralow adhesion 6 well plates (Corning 3471) at a density of 10\n7\ncells/well. PBMCs were cultured for 5\u20137 days to allow monocyte attachment. The remaining white blood cells were washed, from the plate yielding a pure monocyte/macrophage culture. The adherent cells were differentiated into monocyte-derived macrophages using human GM-CSF (15 ng/ml) in complete DMEM for 5 days. A previous comparison of GM-CSF with M-CSF indicated that the former yielded cultures with slightly greater neurotoxic secretory activity in response to HIV gp120. Following differentiation, the cells were maintained in complete DMEM.\n\nPrimary cultures of mouse microglia\nMouse microglia were obtained from E16 fetal mice and were cultured from explants of brain tissue. Mice were euthanized in isoflurane and the uterus was removed, washed briefly, and placed in sterile ice cold HEPES buffered Hank\u2019s Balance Salt Solution (HBSS). The brain was removed from each fetus, washed sequentially in sterile HBSS followed by complete medium (DMEM+glutamine+10% FBS+20 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin). The brain was stripped of membranes and vessels and minced with microdissecting scissors. The tissue pieces were then gently drawn into a syringe fitted with a 21 ga needle engineered to cut smoothly through the tissue (blunt tip with sharpened edges). The needle was removed and the small cores of tissue that were collected in the syringe were then transferred to a 15 ml tube containing 8\u201310 ml of medium. The tissue \u201cpunches\u201d were washed twice with gentle agitation and then re-suspended in 12 ml fresh medium. The punches were then evenly distributed into 6 well ultra low adhesion plates such that each well had the tissue from ~1\u20132 brains. The tissue punches formed small organoid-like balls of tissue that were maintained as a suspension culture. Microglia are the only cells in the culture capable of attaching to the low adhesion surface. After about 4\u20135 days, microglia growing within the punches begin to migrate out and attach to the plate. Over the next week, the numbers of microglia increased until the well was confluent, at approximately 2 weeks (depending on the density of tissue punches). This procedure allows the development of the microglia in a neural environment. The neural tissue (suspended punches) is easily removed by washing leaving a pure microglial culture.\n\nPreparation of macrophage/microglial conditioned medium (MCM)\nCultures of macrophages or microglia were stimulated with 200 pg/ml HIV gp120\nADA\nvirions for a period of 1 hour to generate conditioned medium. The MCM was centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 minutes to remove any cells, ultrafiltered at 300 kDa to remove virions and then frozen in aliquots at \u221280\u00b0 C. Prior to use, the medium was tested to verify the ability to provoke a dysregulation of neuronal intracellular calcium homeostasis and cytoskeletal damage as previously described(\nMeeker et al., 2005\n;\nMeeker et al., 2012\n;\nMeeker et al., 2016a\n). The medium was used in the current studies to provoke inflammation-associated damage and determine if the p75\nNTR\nwas expressed during the earliest stages of damage (calcium dysregulation and beading).\n\nPrimary cultures of mouse cortex and hippocampus\nAll culture work was done in accordance with NIH animal welfare guidelines and was approved by the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Timed gestational embryonic day 16 (E16) pregnant female CD1 mice (Charles Rivers) were sacrificed by anesthetizing with isoflurane drop method until breathing and heart stopped. A thoracotomy was then performed, the uterus removed, briefly rinsed in ice cold 70% ethanol and rinsed twice in ice cold, sterile HEPES-buffered Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS). The brain was dissected from each fetus, extensively washed and cleaned of dura-arachnoid membrane and visible vessels. The cortex/hippocampus was dissected from each brain and transferred to a 15 ml tube containing 5 ml calcium-magnesium free-HBSS + 2.4 U/ml dispase + 2 U/ml DNase I and incubated for 25\u201330 min at 36\u00b0 C. Tissue was triturated and allowed to settle for 2 min. The suspended cells were transferred to a 50 ml culture tube containing 25 ml of Neurobasal medium with added B27 supplement, glutamine, 5% fetal bovine serum and 20 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin (Note: more recently we have determined that Neurobasal Plus with B27 Plus provides even better results). After several rounds of trituration in 2\u20133 ml calcium-magnesium free HBSS, the dissociated cells were seeded at a density of 12,000 \u2013 20,000 cells/cm\n2\non poly-D-lysine-treated coverslips. After 24 hours, cultures were transferred to Neurobasal medium with added B27 supplement and glutamine. The resulting cultures were >95% neurons at day 4 after seeding.\n\nStatistical analysis\nGraphpad Prism software was used for data summaries and graphics. Parametric statistics were used to evaluate most changes induced by LM11A-31 relative to untreated controls. In cases where the data were not normally distributed non-parametric statistics were used. Means and the standard error of the mean were calculated for at least three replicate experiments. T-tests were used for paired comparisons, analysis of variance for multiple groups, analysis of variance with repeated measures for temporal data and Chi-square for the analysis of cell populations. A probability of <0.05 for rejection of the null hypothesis was considered significant."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (Protocol 17183). All animals had food and water available\nad libitum\nand were housed in a 14 h:10 h light:dark cycle with lights off at 1800 h. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-Cre:Ai9 transgenic mice used in this study were bred by crossing GnRH-Cre+ females (Jackson Labs #021207) and Ai9 males (Jackson Labs #007909) on the C57BL/6J background. Cre+ female pups of this cross at postnatal day 42 and older were used due to requirements for ongoing projects in our laboratory that require fluorescent tdTomato expression in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons (\nLi et al., 2018\n). To verify that Cre recombinase and/or tdTomato expression did not influence the EEG results presented here, we also examined C57BL/6J female mice that were obtained from Jackson Labs at 6 weeks of age.\n\n2.2. Estrous cycle monitoring\nEstrous cycle monitoring was conducted from 0900\u20131100 h and performed both before and after saline/KA injection (\nFigure 1A\n) using a vaginal cytology protocol described previously (\nPantier et al., 2019\n). All mice in this study displayed pre-injection estrous cycles with regular 4- to 5-day periods, consistent with previous findings (\nByers et al., 2012\n;\nLi et al., 2017\n;\nNelson et al., 1981\n). Proestrus is difficult to determine in many mice, and smears appearing as a transition state between proestrus and estrus are common. Therefore, smears with more nucleated epithelial cells than cornified cells were classified as proestrus, whereas smears with more cornified epithelial cells were classified as estrus. A stage of \u201cfew\u201d was designated when very few cells could be obtained, and was typically observed when diestrus was prolonged (\nPantier et al., 2019\n). Cycle length was calculated as the time to progress from one day of estrus to the next, with each stage displayed in order in between (\nLi et al., 2017\n;\nPantier et al., 2019\n). At least one cycle was calculated for each mouse at each time point examined; when two cycles were detected, these were averaged for group comparisons.\nFigure 1:\nOpen in a new tab\nExperimental design and development of convolutional neural network machine learning for seizure detection. A) Timeline of procedures and experiments. dpi = days post-injection B) Flowchart of steps in validating the machine learning seizure detection algorithm and analyzing EEG recordings. The version of Seizure Analyzer software used is available in (\nZeidler et al., 2018\n).\n\n2.3. Stereotaxic surgeries\nEpilepsy induction by unilateral KA (Tocris #0222; 50 nl of 20 mM in 0.9% sterile saline) injection in left or right dorsal hippocampus (from Bregma: 2.0 mm posterior, 1.5 mm lateral, 1.4 mm ventral to the cortical surface) was performed on diestrus as previously described (\nLi et al., 2017\n). Controls were injected with an equivalent volume of saline. Saline/KA injection was assigned randomly. 14\u201317 days after injection, a twisted bipolar EEG electrode (P1 Technologies #MS303/3-A/SPC) was implanted in the ipsilateral hippocampus slightly dorsal and lateral to the injection location (from Bregma: 1.25 mm ventral, 1.75 mm lateral). Anchor microscrews (J.I. Morris Co. #FF00CE188) were inserted in the skull bilaterally posterior to the electrode, with two screws placed over parietal cortex and two over the cerebellum. Electrode and screw implants were stabilized to the skull using dental cement (Coltene Whaledent #H-00280).\nAll surgical procedures were performed under isoflurane anesthesia (2\u20133%, vaporized in 100% oxygen; Clipper Distributing Company #57319-507-06). For analgesia, mice were administered subcutaneous carprofen (5 mg/kg, Zoetis #PI 4019448) at the beginning of each surgery and 2.5% lidocaine plus 2.5% prilocaine cream (Human Pharmaceuticals #191.49600.3) was applied topically on sutured incisions and at the base of the dental cement implant, along with antibiotic Neosporin gel (Johnson and Johnson). Mice were individually housed after electrode implantation and allowed to recover >7 days before recording.\n\n2.4. Video-EEG recording\nFor EEG recordings, mice were singly housed in custom plastic cages (L*W*D = 20*22*20 cm) in a dedicated recording room and connected through an electrical commutator (P1 Technologies #SL2C/SB) to a Brownlee 440 amplifier (NeuroPhase) with the gain set at 1K. EEG signals, recorded as the local field potential differential between the two electrodes (\nArmstrong et al., 2013\n), were sampled at 2 kHz and digitized (National Instruments) to a Dell recording computer with recorder software written in MATLAB (\nArmstrong et al., 2013\n) running in Windows 10. Videos were obtained using webcams (Logitech #C930e) synchronized to the recorder software. Mice were EEG- and video-recorded at 21\u201335 days post-injection (1 month) and again from 49\u201370 days post-injection (2 months) (\nFigure 1A\n). Mice were returned to the colony and individually housed in regular cages for 14 days between recording periods. Both EEG and videos were recorded 24/7, with red light illumination provided to enable video recording in the dark phase of the light cycle.\n\n2.5. Development and implementation of machine learning method for seizure detection and analysis\nA convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was designed in TensorFlow (\nwww.tensorflow.org\n) and trained to detect seizures recorded from the EEG (\nFigure 1B\n). The supporting Python code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ChristianLabUIUC/SeizureDetector\n. The raw EEG signal (down-sampled to 250 Hz) was entered as the input layer (height*width = 1*1024). After the input layer, the CNN consisted of three convolution-pooling units, a flattened layer, a dropout layer, a dense layer, and a final output layer. Each convolution-pooling unit consisted of a convolution layer and a max pooling layer. The 1st, 3rd and 5th layers were convolution layers, which computed the signal with kernel size*num of kernel as 1*64*16, 1*32*32, and 1*16*8, respectively. The 2nd, 4th, and 6th layers were max pooling layers with 1*2 sub-sampling. The signals were then flattened (7\nth\nlayer) and connected to a dropout layer (8th) for regularization. The 9th layer was a dense layer connected to the final output layer by a sigmoid activation function.\nEvents used in training and evaluating the CNN model were extracted using the MATLAB-based software, Seizure Analyzer (\nZeidler et al., 2018\n), from a subset of recordings selected at random in a blinded fashion encompassing data from across the estrous cycle. These events were designated as epileptiform (high-amplitude seizure spikes occurring at 2 Hz frequency and higher, with at least 8 spikes occurring within 4 seconds) or non-epileptiform (containing movement artifacts). Extracted EEG traces that contained epileptiform events were used as positive data in training the CNN. All data in the training dataset were set to contain 1024 sampling points. If the EEG trace contained an epileptiform event extending beyond 1024 points, a random portion of 1024 continuous points within the event was selected. Non-epileptiform events and other randomly extracted stable baseline traces were used as negative data. The amplitudes of all traces were normalized to a \u22121 to +1 range centered on the baseline of the trace. A dataset for model training and evaluation consisting of 46762 total events extracted from both control and IHKA mice was randomly split into training data (~70%, or 37264 events) and validation data (~30%, or 9498 events). In testing the CNN model with the validation dataset, 92% recall, 93% specificity, 93% precision, and 93% accuracy was achieved when the dataset was balanced (positive:negative events = 1:1). On an imbalanced validation dataset (positive:negative = 5:1), the model achieved 91% recall, 93% specificity, 73% precision, and 92% accuracy.\nUpon successful CNN training, a sliding window method (window size = 1024 points, step = 750 points) was applied to detect seizures from all recordings collected from both control and IHKA mice across the different stages of the estrous cycle in a blinded manner. Consecutive windows marked as positive (epileptiform) were combined as one seizure. Minimal seizure duration was set at 6 seconds and the minimal interictal interval was set at 5 seconds. The end of a seizure was delineated when the spiking fell below the 2 Hz threshold after at least a 6-s bout of epileptiform spiking; if a subsequent epileptiform event initiated within 5 s, the two events were combined into one epileptiform event for analyses, with the end of the longer epileptiform event determined by spiking rate falling below the 2 Hz threshold. These analysis parameters were applied to all EEG recordings from all mice and all cycle stages for consistency, so that differences in detection settings would not produce artificial differences in seizure parameters between cycle stages.\nNote that when seizures are frequent (i.e., \u22651% of time spent in seizure activity), the CNN model detects the events with high accuracy. If seizure frequency is low, however, visual confirmation of seizures and other behaviors are needed to accurately separate epileptiform events from false positive events (\nFigure S1\n). Therefore, seizures identified from EEG traces in mice with low seizure frequency near the false positive detection rate were verified in videos by an observer blinded to mouse identity and cycle stage. Paroxysmal activity scored at Racine stage 3 and above was the minimum criterion for behavioral seizure classification. The IHKA mouse model most often displays nonconvulsive electrographic hippocampal seizures (\nLevesque and Avoli, 2013\n;\nTwele et al., 2017\n). Therefore, lack of movement (but not sleeping) was also classified as seizure activity. Spikes that occurred with exploring, grooming, eating, or drinking behaviors were classified as movement artifacts.\nAll detected days of diestrus, proestrus, and estrus at 2 months post-injection were used in EEG analyses (\nTable S1\n). Recordings from 2100 to 0300 h were considered as the transition times between two different estrous cycle days and were not used in analyses. Similarly, metestrus and \u201cfew\u201d stages were considered as transition stages between diestrus and pro/estrus and were not included in the present analyses. Seizure burden for each mouse was quantified by the percentage of time in seizure activity, seizure frequency (number of seizures per hour), average seizure duration, and total seizure EEG power, calculated as the short-term Fourier-transformed signal power at frequencies from 0.1\u2013100 Hz averaged across the time axis.\n\n2.6. Statistics\nStatistical analyses were performed using Python or OriginPro. Data normality was tested using Shapiro-Wilk tests. Comparisons of cycle length and time spent in diestrus between control and IHKA mice were performed using two-tailed t-tests. Comparisons of EEG parameters between cycle stages were performed as parametric two-tailed paired t-tests or nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests as appropriate based on data normality. Correlations were tested using Spearman\u2019s correlations. Data are presented as means \u00b1 SEM. p<0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Fabrication of \u03bcLED implant\nTwo silver plated soft copper core wires with PFA insulation (36 AWG, Micron Meters, Saint George, UT) were tightly twisted together and cut to 10 cm. Approximately 3-4 mm of insulation was then removed from both wires on each side. A high-power CREE \u03bcLED (Xlamp XB-D Blue, 475 nm, Cree Inc., Durham, NC;\nFigure 1A\n) was soldered to the copper wires such that the positive wire was soldered to the anode-soldering pad and the ground wire soldered to both the cathode and central heat sink pads. Epidural catheter tubing (19 ga.; Arrow International Inc., Reading, PA) was then cut to 2 mm, and slid over both wires adjacent to the LED (\nFigure 1B\n). A second piece of catheter was cut to 2 cm and positioned on the side furthest from the LED (\nFigure 1D\n, asterisk).\nFigure 1: \u03bcLED implant.\nOpen in a new tab\nA) Image of the Cree \u03bcLED used in our implants for optogenetic spinal stimulation. (B) The LED portion of the implant is coated in 2-ton epoxy with a small hole placed in the center to allow for anchoring with a microscrew. Asterisk identifies the small catheter above. (C) The total length of the LED portion of the implant is less than 1 cm. (D) The total implant length is approximately 10 cm. Asterisk identifies the long catheter above.\nThe connector end of the two de-insulated wires were then soldered to gold-plated pins (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA). A small, circular piece of laboratory tape was placed onto the underside of a 6-channel pedestal (Plastics One) to seal open holes from epoxy. The soldered pins were then pierced through the tape into the two central pinholes of the pedestal. The longer piece of catheter was then positioned immediately beside the connector pedestal for strain relief and 2-ton epoxy (Devcon, Danvers, MA) was poured onto the pedestal to completely cover all pins. Epoxy was allowed to cure overnight.\nThe following day, the smaller catheter was positioned 4-5 mm from the LED. The wires were then positioned at 45\u00b0 relative to the LED. The wires between the catheter and LED were separated to allow space for a microscrew (5/32 inch #000 flat fillister, J.I. Morris Company, Oxford, MA) that is used to secure the implant to the vertebra (\nFigure 1B\n). The LED, wires, and small catheter were then dipped into 2-ton epoxy and allowed to cure overnight. This step was repeated several times until the LED and wires were fully insulated.\nA small hole was then drilled into the epoxy between the two wires using a .0210\u201d/.533 mm drill bit (\nFigure 1B\n, arrow; Gyros Precision Tools, Monsey, NY). The epoxy was then shaped into a smooth oval, approximately 8 mm long (\nFigure 1C\n) using a Dremel tool (407 1/2\u201d Sanding Drum, 520-02 1/2\u201d SIC Impregnated Wheels; Dremel, Racine, WI). A thin layer of epoxy was painted over the lens to reduce reflected light (\nFigure 1B\n,\nC\n). The entire length of the implant, including wiring and pedestal, was approximately 10 cm (\nFigure 1D\n). Lastly, complete insulation was confirmed by immersing the implant in 0.9% sodium chloride solution and testing the resistance of each wire against an independent wire via a multimeter to ensure there were no shorts. Implants were sterilized in an autoclave for 30 minutes.\n\nFabrication of \u03bcLED controller\nTo control the LED, we fabricated a simple LED driver circuit (\nFigure 2A\n). A 12V supply (3, 4V batteries in series) was used to power a constant current LED driver (1000 mA BuckBlock with DIM, LEDdynamics Inc., Randolph, VT), which is the dimmable power source for the implanted LED allowing for an adjustable light intensity. The timing of the implanted \u03bcLED (light on/light off) was controlled using an AtTiny85 microcontroller (Atmel). The \u201cDIM\u201d lead (\nFigure 2A\n) on the LED driver was connected to the collector of an NPN transistor and the emitter connected to the ground. The transistor base pin was switched ON (AtTiny GPIO pin 2 = high;\nFigure 2A\n) or OFF (GPIO pin 2 = low;\nFigure 2A\n), based on the information provided by the AtTiny. The AtTiny was programmed using a \u201cTiny AVR Programmer\u201d (Sparkfun, PGM-11801 developed by David Mellis, MIT Media Lab), in Arduino (Arduino; Italy). The microcontroller (AtTiny85) gated the timing (pulse width and interpulse period) of the \u03bcLED, which was connected to the \u201cLED+\u201d and \u201cLED\u2212\u201c leads of the LED driver (\nFigure 2A\n). The current, which dictates the light intensity, was controlled using a 20 kOhm potentiometer (\nFigure 2A\n,\nB\n) attached to the LED driver between the \u201cDIM GND\u201d and \u201cDIM\u201d leads (\nFigure 2A\n). We added a connector to measure the resistance set by the potentiometer (\nFigure 2C\n) to standardize intensity. We included two indicator LEDs to monitor the two power sources (5V, 12V; orange;\nFigure 2A\n,\nB\n) and one indicator LED that mirrors the timing of the implanted \u03bcLED (blue;\nFigure 2A\n,\nB\n). Rats were tethered to the controller during periods of stimulation, which allowed them to walk freely around their cage while receiving stimulation (\nFigure 2D\n).\nFigure 2: Implant controller.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Schematic of \u03bcLED implant controller. (B,C) Images of the implant controller bud box. Orange LEDs indicate functional 5V and 12V power sources. Blue LED indicates the implant is properly powered. (D) Image of rat tethered to a functioning implant driver box.\n\nOptional addition of thermistor to \u03bcLED implant\nConstruction of an implant that also contains a thermistor was similar to that of the \u03bcLED implant with a few additions. Four 30-gauge wires are wound together to form leads that connect to a pedestal connector for mounting on the animal\u2019s headcap. On the opposite end, two of the four leads were soldered to a \u03bcLED as above, while the other two leads were soldered to a NTC thermistor 100 kOhm bead (\nFigure 3\n; Murata Electronics, Irvine, CA). The thermistor itself was positioned directly onto the back of the LED to ensure the temperature readouts were of the hottest point of the implant (\nFigure 3\n). The LED and thermistor were then epoxied together and tested to ensure no electrical shorts existed between channels. The entire device was then covered in 2-ton epoxy (Devcon) for insulation, with the epoxy shaped with a Dremel tool into a smooth oval (\nFigure 3\n). The other end of the leads were soldered to the pedestal and coated in epoxy to ensure insulation. A final check of the insulation was done by immersing the implant in 0.9% sodium chloride solution and testing the resistance of each channel via a multimeter.\nFigure 3: Optional thermistor.\nOpen in a new tab\nA thermistor (blue bead) was added to the \u03bcLED implant to allow for real-time temperature assessment.\n\nCalibration of the \u03bcLED implant\nThe \u03bcLED implants were calibrated for light production as a function of current intensity. Current was adjusted using a potentiometer on the LED controller and resistance of the potentiometer was measured using a multimeter. Light intensity was measured using a ThorLabs light intensity meter paired with a standard photodiode power sensor attachment (Thorlabs, Newton, NJ). Light intensity and current intensity were measured at approximately 25 mW light intensity intervals, from the lowest to the highest light intensity produced by the \u03bcLED (~200 mW or 50 mW/mm\n2\n).\n\nCalibration of the thermistor implant\nEach thermistor implant was calibrated by comparison to a high-precision integrated temperature sensor (ITC; TSYS01, Elecrow, Shenzhen city, China). The ITC was connected to an Arduino Uno, and thermistor leads from the implant were directed to a voltage divider (100kOhm fixed resistance) that also connected to the Arduino. The ITC and implant were held together with a metal clip and submerged in a beaker containing water. The beaker was then set on a hot plate at a low setting. The water was heated from 25 to 50\u00b0 C. Coefficients for the Steinhart-Hart equation were then calculated for each thermistor using MATLAB\u2019s (Mathworks, Natick MA) linear regression function to fit parameters to the known temperature readings from the ITC.\n\nSurgical procedures & animal care\nAnimals\nAll procedures were conducted in accordance with NIH guidelines and were approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Long-Evans rats (250 \u2013 350g; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were used in the implant longevity study (n=12) and in the thermal safety study (n=3). All rats received a cervical contusion injury since these implants will be used to test treatments for spinal cord injury in future studies. We therefore performed a C4 cervical contusion injury 2-5 weeks before LED implant (\nMondello et al., 2015\n). In this regard, male rats were excluded from the study as they have a higher rate of urine retention and bladder infection after spinal injury.\nSpinal cord injury and intraspinal injections of ChR2 AAV vector\nDuring the same surgical procedure, rats received both a C4 hemicontusion (see below) and intraspinal injections of the optogenetic vector\nAAV2-hSyn-ChR2-YFP\n(UNC Vector Core, Chapel Hill, NC) at spinal segment C6 per our prior work (\nMondello et al., 2018\n). Rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (80 mg/kg) with xylazine (10 mg/kg). Supplemental dosages of ketamine were supplied throughout the procedure, as needed. Rats were then shaved across the upper back, and eyes coated with a layer of ophthalmic ointment. Rats then received an intradermal injection of lidocaine (1 mg/kg) and bupivacaine (1 mg/kg) at the intended site of incision (C2-T2), as well as a subcutaneous injection of enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg) to reduce infection, and a subcutaneous injection of sterile saline (5 ml) to maintain hydration.\nThe surgery site was then prepared with betadine and alcohol. Rats were placed on a thermal pad and an incision was made in the skin and muscle layers over spinal segments C2-T2. A hemi-laminectomy was completed over C4 and a hemicontusion was produced using the Infinite Horizon Impactor (150 kdyne; Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Fairfax Station, VA).\nRats then received a partial laminectomy ipsilateral to injury, at the caudal aspect of C6 for spinal injections of the optogenetic AAV vector. Rats were then positioned in a spinal stereotaxic frame (Kopf, Tujunga, CA). Two injections were made using a Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV) with a glass-pulled pipette attached to a model 5000 microinjection unit (AgnTho\u2019s AB, Liding\u00f6, Sweden) into the dorsal root entry zone, and 1 mm lateral to the dorsal root entry zone, respectively.\nA 1.5 \u03bcl deposit of\nAAV2-hSyn-ChR2-YFP\n(UNC Vector Core) was injected at a depth of 0.5 mm at both injection sites (3 \u03bcl total). The injection pipette was left in place for 10 minutes to permit complete dissipation of virus into the spinal tissue before withdrawing the syringe.\nAfter the injections, gelfoam was placed over the exposed cord and the muscles and skin were sutured closed in layers. Rats were placed on a heating pad and provided intraperitoneal saline injections and a reapplication of ophthalmic ointment. Once the rats were awake, they received a subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) for pain management, which continued 2x/day for the following two days. Weight and hydration were monitored daily for several days post-operatively.\n\u03bcLED implant and thermistor implant procedure\nFive weeks after receiving a spinal injury and injections, rats underwent a second surgery for \u03bcLED implant placement. The anesthesia and surgical preparations are the same as described above. A hemi-laminectomy was performed at C6, where the optogenetic AAV vector was previously injected, and a small hole was drilled into ipsilateral and contralateral C5 using a Dremel tool with a .0210\u201d/.533 mm drill bit (Gyros Precision Tools). A 5/32 inch #000 flat fillister head screw (J.I. Morris) was then inserted into the contralateral hole at C5 (\nFigure 4A\n,\nB1\n) and a second screw was positioned in the hole of the \u03bcLED implant (\nFigure 1B\n). This second screw is included to increase anchoring of liquid dentin to the implanted region in one of the following steps. Liquid dentin adheres strongly to stainless steel and weakly to the bone and tissues surrounding the implant. The implant was then screwed into the hole at ipsilateral C5, positioning the LED over the laminectomy at C6 (\nFigure 4A\n,\nB2\n). Kwik-Sil (WPI, Sarasota, FL) was injected to fill the gap between the implant and top of the exposed spinal cord and dura. Next, UV-curable Fusio\u2122 liquid dentin (Pentron, Orange, CA) was applied over the top of the implant and contralateral lamina and cured using an LED light cure lamp (NSKI dental, Hoffman Estates, IL;\nFigure 4A\n,\nB3\n). Importantly, liquid dentin provides an extra barrier to slow the infiltration of scar formation to the site of implantation, which eventually blocks the diffusion of light into the spinal cord for optogenetic stimulation.\nFigure 4: \u03bcLED implant strategy.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Schematic of the \u03bcLED spinal implant and current injury model. Rats received a spinal hemicontusion at C4 (purple oval) and the implant at C6. A microscrew is used to anchor the implant into ipsilateral C5. A second microscrew is positioned into contralateral C5 to help anchor liquid dentin around the implant as liquid dentin has a stronger adherence to stainless steel compared to bone/tissues. Kwik-sil is placed over the spinal cord dura and under the implant at C6 (green rectangle). Cyanoacrylate is painted onto the bony segments and liquid dentin is layered over the implant and surrounding vertebra, bilaterally. (B) Step-wise representative images of the implant procedure. (1) A hemi-laminectomy is performed at caudal C6 for optogenetic vector injection. Holes are drilled bilaterally at C5 and a microscrew is placed in the contralateral hole. * = hemi-laminectomy; # = microscrew; arrow = screw hole. (2) The implant is anchored into the ipsilateral hole at C5 using a second screw. # = microscrews; LED implant is located on the bottom half of the image (3) Liquid dentin is placed over both the implant and contralateral laminae. Liquid dentin = opaque white reagent covering the implant and screws.\nThe catheter was routed under the skin and the pedestal was fixed to the top of the skull using microscrews (5/32 inch #000 flat fillister head screw; J.I. Morris). A mixture of C & B Metabond Quick Adhesive System (Parkell, Edgewood, NY) and Ortho Jet Liquid Acrylic and Jet Denture Repair Powder (Lang, Wheeling, IL) created a skull cap that bonded the screws and connector together. The muscle and skin layers were sutured closed. Ophthalmic ointment was reapplied and buprenorphine was administered subcutaneously twice daily for the following two days. Enrofloxacin (25 mg/kg) was added to water bottles for 7 days to provide additional protection against infections.\n\nDetecting\nin-vivo\ntemperature changes\nRats implanted with the dual \u03bcLED and thermistor (n=3) were anesthetized with isoflurane to minimize variability in baseline temperature due to moving about their cages. Rats were placed in plexiglass induction chamber and anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and 1L/min oxygen. Once rats were sufficiently anesthetized, they were transferred to a heating pad and isoflurane was reduced to 1.5 \u2013 2.5%. Before stimulation, the Arduino system and MATLAB software described above were used to estimate current amplitude as a function of potentiometer readings. Low (12.5 mW/mm\n2\n), medium (25 mW/mm\n2\n) and high (37.5 mW/mm\n2\n) current intensities were measured. Testing began when the temperature at the LED site was stable for 2 minutes. A total of 11 stimulation parameters were investigated (\nTable 1\n). Over the course of 2 \u2013 3 hours, each animal received optical stimulation from several of the specified parameters, which were carried out in random order. An ATTiny85-20PU (Atmel, San Jose, CA) was programmed with the specified parameters. For each trial, a baseline temperature recording was measured over two minutes before initiating stimulation. If the temperature appeared stable by the end of this two-minute period, a trial began. Temperature changes were measured over a five-minute stimulation period.\nTable 1: Parameters tested.\nThe last two parameters use continuous pulse trains.\nPulse width (ms)\nIntensity (mW/mm\n2\n)\nFrequency (Hz)\n3\n12.5\n4\n3\n25\n4\n3\n37.5\n4\n5\n12.5\n4\n5\n25\n4\n5\n37.5\n4\n7\n12.5\n4\n7\n25\n4\n7\n37.5\n4\n5\n25\n10\n5\n25\n20\nOpen in a new tab\n\nAssessing\nin-vivo\nfunctionality of the \u03bcLED implant\nTo ensure the implant remained intact, we measured the current being passed across the LED once a week. To do this we placed a relatively small (22 ohms) resistor in series with the LED and observed the voltage drop across the resistor with an oscilloscope. If a voltage drop no longer occurred, paired with a lack of LED-induced movements, the implant was assumed to have shorted or otherwise failed.\n\nAssessing\nin-vivo\nlongevity of the \u03bcLED implant\nThe minimal light intensity to evoke a visible forelimb movement in rats implanted with a \u03bcLED implant (n=12) was determined at least 1x/ week for 6 weeks. For each testing period, a thermally safe protocol was used: 4 Hz, 5 ms pulse width, delivered using a stimulation paradigm delivering light pulses for 5 seconds followed by 15 seconds between stimulus trains. Rats were awake and freely-moving throughout testing. Light-evoked movements were discerned from spontaneous movements by first coaxing the rat to rear against their cage, leaving the optogenetically-stimulated limb with SCI-induced deficits dangling in the air, relatively still. The LED controller was then turned on containing an indicator LED that mirrors the\nin-vivo\nLED implant. Rhythmic movements (twitches) timed with the indicator LED on the LED controller box that also increased and decreased in magnitude with adjustments to the implant\u2019s light intensity, were deemed true light-evoked movements.\n\nHistology\nPerfusion and tissue sectioning:\nRats received an intraperitoneal injection of Beuthanasia (200 mg/kg) and were transcardially perfused using 0.9% sodium chloride, followed by 10% formalin. The cervical spinal cord was dissected and placed in 10% formalin overnight for 24 hours at 4\u00b0C. Spinal cord tissue was cryopreserved in 30% sucrose for 24 hours at 4\u00b0C. Approximately 4 mm blocks of tissue were embedded in O.C.T. and then placed in a mixture of dry ice and acetone to rapidly freeze the tissue. Tissue was sectioned into 40 \u03bcm-thick crossections using a cryostat.\nAssessment of AAV vector transduction\nTissue from the rats in the implant longevity study were checked to confirm transduction of the optogenetic AAV vector into the cervical spinal cord. Tissue sections from cervical segment C6 were mounted onto superfrost plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) and covered with a coverslip using polyvinyl alcohol mounting media (PVA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Sections were then assessed using an SPX8 confocal microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) to confirm the presence of fluorescence indicating AAV transduction. Rats that did not have viral transduction were excluded from the study.\nCresyl violet and myelin dye\nTo determine if optogenetic stimulation using the \u03bcled implant induces tissue damage and/or demyelination, sections from spinal segment C6 were mounted onto subbed superfrost plus slides and stained with cresyl violet and myelin dyes as described in our previous work (\nMondello et al., 2015\n). In short, tissue was fume fixed onto slides for 24 hours with 10% formalin. Tissue was then incubated for 5 minutes in water, followed by 70%, 95%, 100% Ethanol (EtOH), and Xylene. This process was repeated in the opposite order. Sections were then incubated for 10 minutes in myelin dye consisting of eriochrome cyanine R (Fluka, St. Louis, MO) and then differentiated in water mixed with ammonium hydroxide. Next, sections were incubated in cresyl violet dye consisting of cresyl violet with acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 3 minutes. Afterwards, sections were dipped 10 times in 70%, and 95% EtOH then differentiated with glacial acetic acid mixed in 95% EtOH. Sections were then incubated for 10 mins in 100% EtOH followed by Xylene, then coverslipped with Eukitt (Sigma-Aldrich). Tissue was assessed for damage using a Zeiss Axio Zoom microscope (Oberkochen, Germany).\nImmunohistochemistry\nTo identify if the \u03bcLED implant upregulates astroglioses, sections from spinal segment C6 were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) mixed with 1% normal donkey serum (DS; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and triton X-100 (T; 1% DS-PBS-T; Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 x 10 minutes on a shaker table at room temperature. Next, tissue was incubated in a blocking solution consisting of 5% DS-PBS-T for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were transferred to a 1:750 GFAP antibody solution (AB5894; Millipore, Burlington, MA) for an overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C. The following day sections were washed with 1% DS-PBS-T for 3 x 10 minutes. Sections were then incubated in a 1:200 donkey anti-rabbit alexafluor 594 secondary antibody (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA) for 1 hour on a shaker table at room temperature. Afterwards, sections were washed 3 x 10 minutes with PBS and mounted onto superfrost plus slides (Fisher Scientific) and coverslipped with PVA mountant (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were viewed with an SP8X confocal microscope (Leica).\n\nStatistics\nA one-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni corrections was used to compare changes in peak temperature during different stimulation paradigms. SPSS software (IBM, Armonk, NY) was used to complete this analysis. A significant p value was considered to be p < .05 for all tests."

    "Methods": "Participants.\nSixteen spinal cord injured participants (mean age 50.2\u00b112.8 years; 4 females) participated in the study. All procedures were approved by the local ethics committee at the University of Miami in accordance with the guidelines established in the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants had a chronic SCI (\u22651 year) and were classified as having a C1-C7 SCI based on the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) exam. Three out of 16 individuals were categorized by the American Spinal Cord Injury Impairment Scale (AIS) as AIS A (complete injury) due to the lack of sacral sparing (Marino et al., 2003), despite being able to elicit voluntary force with the targeted muscle. The other 13 individuals were classified as incomplete AIS C (n=8) or D (n=5;\nTable 1\n). SCI participants were able to exert maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC, measured as the highest mean rectified EMG activity found in 1 s during the MVC burst) into index finger abduction to a lesser extent compared with age-matched control subjects (Note that data in aged-matched control obtained from\nBunday and Perez, 2012\n; controls=0.5\u00b10.3 mV, SCI=0.3\u00b10.1 mV, p<0.001). Each subject underwent all testing sessions at the same time of the day and the majority of subjects were tested in the morning. All subjects (n=16) participated in the two main experimental sessions were we examined the effect of PCMS+AIH and PCMS+sham-AIH on the amplitude of MEPs elicited by TMS. Later, in a subgroup of subjects, we examined the effect of both interventions on the amplitude of MEPs elicited by electrical stimulation (n=9), and small levels of voluntary motor output and MVCs (n=10).\nTable 1:\nSpinal cord injury participants\nParticipants\nAge\nSex\nEtiology\nLevel of lesion\nAIS\nYears since injury\n1\n67\nM\nT\nC2\nC\n11\n2\n50\nM\nT\nC5\nD\n4\n3\n53\nF\nT\nC5\nD\n14\n4\n39\nF\nNT\nC1\nD\n25\n5\n34\nM\nT\nC7\nC\n2\n6\n38\nM\nT\nC7\nC\n3\n7\n38\nM\nT\nC5\nC\n11\n8\n55\nM\nT\nC7\nA\n18\n9\n51\nF\nT\nC2\u20136\nA\n10\n10\n33\nM\nT\nC2\nC\n9\n11\n66\nM\nT\nC4\nD\n6\n12\n69\nM\nT\nC2\nC\n5\n13\n48\nF\nT\nC6\nC\n7\n14\n60\nM\nNT\nC1\nD\n3\n15\n36\nM\nT\nC5\nC\n2\n16\n66\nM\nNT\nC5\u20137\nA\n6\nOpen in a new tab\nAIS=American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale, F=Female, M=Male, T=Traumatic, NT=Non-traumatic\n\nEMG and force recordings.\nEMG was recorded from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) through surface electrodes (Ag\u2013AgCl, 10 mm diameter) in a muscle tendon montage with one electrode placed over the belly of the muscle. All signals were amplified, filtered (30\u20131000 Hz), and sampled at 2 kHz for off-line analysis (Cambridge Electronic Design 1401 with Signal software v4.1). At the start of the experiment, subjects were instructed to perform 3 brief MVCs for 3\u20135 s into index finger abduction, separated by 2 min of rest. Participants were verbally cued to commence the contraction by the experimenter whom also provided strong verbal encouragement throughout the contraction. EMG data were processed offline calculating the mean rectified EMG over a 100 ms window centered over peak EMG. In brief, EMG digitized signals were rectified and smoothed using a 4th order Butterworth filter and low-passed at 5 Hz (\nTrumbower et al., 2012\n). Peak EMG was found through visual inspection and the mean value within a window ranging from 50 ms before to 50 ms after the peak was noted. Background EMG was subtracted from this value and the average of the 3 trials was noted. Three MVCs were also measured at baseline and 3 MVCs were collected 30 min after each intervention.\n\nExperimental setup.\nDuring testing, all participants were seated in an armchair with both arms relaxed and flexed at the elbow by 90\u00b0 with the forearm pronated and the wrist and forearm restrained by straps (\nFig. 1A\n). Participants participated in two sessions in a randomized order separated by at least one week: PCMS combined with AIH (PCMS+AIH) and PCMS combined with sham AIH (PCMS+sham-AIH). During both sessions, participants remained at rest for all electrophysiological measurements taken before and after each protocol (\nFig. 1B\n). PCMS was applied using a paired pulse paradigm previously described (\nBunday and Perez, 2012\n;\nTaylor and Martin, 2009\n;\nUrbin et al., 2017\n).\nFigure 1. Experimental set-up.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A)\nParticipants were seated in a customized chair during paired corticospinal-motoneuronal stimulation (PCMS) combined with acute intermittent hypoxia (PCMS+AIH) and sham AIH (PCMS+sham-AIH). PCMS was delivered using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the hand representation of the primary motor cortex and supramaximal peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) over the ulnar nerve with 180 pairs of stimuli delivered every 10 s (0.1 Hz). The position of the TMS coil was monitored using a frameless stereotaxic system and electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle to record electrophysiological outcomes. AIH was administered by using the Hypoxico Inc. (EVEREST SUMMIT II, New York) and the protocol consisted of 15 cycles of 1 min of inspiring ambient air with 1 min of hypoxic air.\n(B)\nTimeline of the experimental procedures. Electrophysiological outcomes were measured before (Baseline) and 30 min after each protocol.\n\nPCMS.\nA total of 180 pairs of stimuli were delivered every 10 s (~34 min, 0.1 Hz) where corticospinal volleys evoked by TMS over the hand representation of the primary motor cortex were timed to arrive at corticospinal-motoneuronal synapses of the FDI muscle 1\u20132 ms before antidromic spikes evoked in motoneurons by supramaximal peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) of the ulnar nerve. Magnetic stimuli were delivered with 100 % of the maximal stimulator output (MSO). PNS was set at an intensity of 150% of the intensity needed to evoke the maximal motor response (M-max) in the FDI muscle. Inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) between TMS and PNS were tailored to individual subjects based on central (CCT) and peripheral (PCT) conduction times calculated from latencies of MEPs, C-root, F-wave, and M-max (\nFig. 2\n). In 6 out of 16 participants, the ISI was calculated based on F-waves instead of C-root stimulation. This was done upon participant\u2019s request based on preferred stimulation site and was kept consistent across all sessions. There was no significant difference in ISIs calculated based on F waves (6.1\u00b11.4) and C-root stimulation (5.1\u00b11.0, p=0.2). At ISIs of ~5.5 the F-wave resulting from the antidromic activation of the motoneuron somas and potentials evoked from magnetic stimulation cannot be distinguished. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the combined response was analyzed and expressed in relation to M-max for each subject. For statistical comparisons the responses to the 180 paired pulses were pooled in blocks of 10 resulting in 18 data points for each participant (\nFig. 3C\n;\nBunday and Perez, 2012\n). MEP latencies were recorded during isometric 10% of MVC index finger abduction to determine the shortest and clearest response for our estimations. C-root potentials, F-waves and M-max latencies were investigated during rest. For MEPs, C-root potentials and M-max, the onset latency was defined as the time when each response exceeded 2 SD of the mean rectified pre-stimulus activity (100 ms) in the averaged waveform, whereas the earliest onset latency of 40 F-waves was used. Cervical roots were stimulated using the same figure-of-eight coil with the outer edge of the coil placed between C7 and T1 spinous processes with the handle in a horizontal position pointing away from the cervical spine (Schmid et al., 1990; Inaba et al., 2002). Potentials evoked at the most proximal part of the C-roots were identified by increasing stimulation intensities in 5% increments until a consistent small response appeared. F-waves were measured using supramaximum stimulus intensity to the ulnar nerve at the wrist (200 \u03bcs pulse duration, DS7A; Digitimer) with a monopolar bar electrode with the cathode positioned proximally. The stimuli were delivered at 1 Hz at an intensity of 150% of the M-max. The M-max was similar across sessions (PCMS+AIH=13.5 mV, PCMS+sham-AIH=12.9 mV, p=0.4). For each trial, we quantified each F-wave\u2019s latency. F-wave trials were filtered using a 2nd order Bessel high-pass filter (200 Hz) to \u2018flatten the tail of the M-wave\u2019 (Khan et al., 2012). M-max was acquired using our regular filter parameters (30\u20131000 Hz). Sixty F-waves were tested to determine PCMS ISIs. An F-wave was considered to be present if a response with a proper latency (minimum of 20 ms) had an amplitude >20 \u03bcV above background. The PCT was calculated using one of the two following calculations: (C-root \u2013 M-max+0.5) or (F-wave\u2013 M-max) * 0.5 and the CCT was calculated as MEP \u2013 C-root +1.5 or MEP - (PCT + M-max).

The AIH protocol consisted of 15 cycles of 1 min of inspiring ambient air (20.9% O2) with 1 min of hypoxic air (9.4% O2).\n(C)\nThe abscissa shows the number of pairs of stimuli during each protocol (a total of 180 pairs of stimuli).

The hypoxic (F\ni\nO =9\u00b10.1) and normoxic (F\ni\nO\n2\n=20.9\u00b13%) gas mixture was delivered through the top valve. The protocol consisted of 15 episodes of hypoxia/normoxia interspaced with 1 min inspiring ambient air (gas mixture supply unplugged). We monitored oxygen concentration before during, and after both sessions using a Handi\n+\n\u00ae oxygen monitor (maxtec, Salt Lake City, Utah, US). Participants breathed through the mask for 2 min before the first cycle to familiarize them with procedures; heart rate and blood pressure were monitored for safety during the AIH protocol and values remained similar to baseline measurements at all times. Normal blood oxygen saturation levels (S\np\nO\n2\n) and heart rate were assessed via pulse oximeter (Nonin 3150 WristOx2 \u2122, Nonin medical Inc, Plymouth, Minnesota, United States). SpO\n2\nnadir after each 60 s exposure was noted and is presented in\nFigure 3D\n. During sham AIH, subjects breathed throughout the same mask the protocol consisted of 15 episodes of normoxia/normoxia interspaced with 1 min inspiring ambient air.\n\nTMS.\nTranscranial magnetic stimuli were applied using a figure-of-eight coil (loop diameter 70 mm) through a Magstim 200\n2\nmagnetic stimulator (Magstim, Whitland, Dyfed, UK) with a monophasic current waveform. Optimal position for eliciting a MEP in the FDI muscle (hot spot) was found by moving the coil with the handle pointing backward and 45\u00b0 away from the midline in small steps across the hand representation of the contralateral primary motor cortex. With this coil position, the current flowed in a posterior-anterior direction and probably produced predominantly early I wave activation (\nSakai et al., 1997\n). Coil position was monitored using a frameless stereotaxic neuro-navigation system (Brainsight 2, Rogue Research, Montreal, Canada). Two sets of 20 MEPs were collected at baseline and 30 min after each intervention.\n\nMEPs elicited by TMS.\nThe resting motor threshold (RMT) was defined as the minimal stimulus intensity required to induce MEPs >50\u03bcV peak-to-peak amplitude above the background EMG in 5/10 consecutive trials in the relaxed muscle (\nRothwell et al., 1999\n). MEPs were tested at rest at an intensity that evoked a MEP with amplitude of approximately 50% of MEP-max in both sessions (PCMS+AIH=75.5\u00b111.7% of MSO, PCMS+sham-AIH=74.1\u00b113.9% of MSO, p=0.8). MEP-max was defined at rest by increasing stimulus intensities in 5% steps of maximal device output until the MEP amplitude did not show additional increases (PCMS+AIH=1.9\u00b11.7 mV, PCMS+sham-AIH=2.5\u00b13.8 mV, p=0.4). At baseline, TMS pulses were delivered at 4 s intervals in sets of 20 separated by resting periods as needed. MEPs were visually inspected and analyzed trial by trial. Two sets of 20 MEPs were collected at each time point.\n\nMEPs elicited by electrical stimulation.\nWe measured corticospinal transmission and/or motoneuron excitability by stimulating the corticospinal tract using high voltage electrical current (200 \u03bcs duration, Digitimer DS7AH) passed between two small gold-cup electrodes (GRASS Technologies \u00ae, Astro Med \u00ae, Inc., Warwick, Rhode Island, USA) placed behind the mastoid process at the cervicomedullary level (n=3; Taylor and Gandevia, 2004a). We adjusted the stimulation intensity to produce a MEP of ~3% M-max. This response was not contaminated by activation of cervical spinal roots. This was verified by increasing intensity until a latency decrement of ~2 ms indicated that the ventral roots were stimulation directly and then turning it back down with an ensuing increment in latency (Taylor and Gandevia, 2004a). In 6 subjects the corticospinal tract was stimulated through the scalp with the cathode at the vertex and anode 7 cm lateral towards the external meatus acusticus (\nDay et al., 1989\n) using a stimulus intensity needed to elicit MEPs of ~3% of M-max in the FDI muscle. The latency of MEPs elicited by cortical electrical stimulation (24.1\u00b12.2 ms) was shorter than the latency of MEPs evoked by TMS (26.0\u00b12.0 ms, p=0.007), suggesting that we stimulated corticospinal axons directly. Because MEPs elicited by cervico-medullary and cortical electrical stimulation showed the same changes across conditions we grouped all results together under MEPs elicited by electrical stimulation. Ten MEPs elicited by electrical stimulation were tested at baseline and 20 MEPs were collected 30 min after each protocol.\n\nSmall voluntary contractions.\nIndex finger abduction force and FDI EMG activity were measured during short, ballistic, isometric contractions into abduction using a custom LabView program (n=10). One cursor showed the target force (10% of MVC) and another cursor showed the force exerted by the subject. Subjects were instructed to perform index finger abduction to move the actual force to the target force as fast as possible without correcting the applied force production during the contraction based on the online visual feedback. After familiarization, four sets of 20 contractions were performed with partially simulated visual feedback of the cursor. Here, subjects controlled the movement of the cursor up to 8% of MVC and the remaining 2% of MVC was simulated by LabView. During the simulation period the speed of the cursor was maintained constant (1 video frame: 15.6ms duration, range=0.61 to 0.67% MVC/ms), while the end point of the cursor was randomly varied within \u00b10.5% standard deviation of the target (10% of MVC). This strategy was used to avoid online real feedback of the force exerted to help to maintain subjects unaware of the possible effects of the stimulation (\nBunday and Perez 2012\n). Force and EMG during each contraction were measured during a 250 ms window (125 ms before and 125 ms after the peak force and EMG values). Forty contractions were performed before and 30 min after each intervention.\n\nStatistics.\nSphericity was tested using Mauchly\u2019s test. The distribution of the dependent variables was examined using Shapiro Wilkinson\u2019s test and was natural log transformed (ln) in cases where it was not normally distributed. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to examine the effect of INTERVENTION (PCMS+AIH and PCMS+sham-AIH) and TIME (baseline and 30 min after each intervention) on MEP size, small voluntary contractions, and MVC. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to examine the effect of BLOCK (from 1 to 18) and INTERVENTION on the response size of measurements acquired during PCMS. Paired t-tests were used to compare the size of the baseline MEPs and MVCs as needed. Bonferroni\u2019s\npost hoc\nanalysis was used to test for significant comparisons. Changes in SpO\n2\nfrom baseline over the course of 15 cycles were analyzed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA in a 2 by 16 design. Response amplitudes during the intervention were contrasted to the first block of 20 to reduce the risk of type 2 errors. This resulted in 17 within and 18 between group comparisons. Ln-transformed relative changes in electrically evoked potentials were compared between the two conditions using a paired t-test. Significance was set at p<0.05. Group data are presented as the mean\u00b1SD in the text and figures."

The surgical area was cleaned with three, alternating rounds of betadine surgical scrub followed by 70% ethanol and a dorsal incision was made over the spinal midline from the base of the skull to the fifth cervical segment. A C2 laminectomy was performed to expose the spinal cord and a left, C2 hemisection (C2Hx) was performed using a micro-scalpel. The overlying muscles, and separately the skin, were sutured with sterile 4\u20130 Vicryl suture. Rats received buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg, s.q.) for the initial 48 hours post-injury, and Lactated Ringer\u2019s solution (10ml/day, s.q.) and oral Nutri-cal supplements (1\u20133 ml, Webster Veterinary, MA, USA) until adequate volitional eating and drinking resumed.\n\nDrugs\nAmpakine CX717 was provided by RespireRX and was mixed in 10% 2-Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HPCD) solution (Sigma) at highest soluble concentration (5 mg/ml) and stored in 1.5 mL aliquots at \u221218 \u02daC. Aliquots were thawed and allowed to warm to room temperature prior to use on the day of each experiment. The CX717 was used at a concentration (15 mg/kg) that can stimulate breathing in neuromuscular disease (\nElMallah et al., 2015\n) and enhance hypoglossal LTF in anesthetized mice (\nTurner et al., 2016\n). HPCD solution (10% HPCD in 0.45% saline solution), used for vehicle injection, was stored at 4 \u02daC and allowed to warm to room temperature prior to use on the day of each experiment. All drugs were administered intravenously over the course of 1 minute via a tail vein catheter.\n\nIn vivo Neurophysiology\nRats were studied using established\nin vivo\nelectrophysiology methods, the fundamentals of which have been recently described (\nStreeter et al., 2017\n;\nWollman et al., 2020\n). Rats were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane (in 100% O\n2\n) and a tail vein catheter was placed for intravenous delivery of urethane and fluids. Rats were placed on an electric heating pad on medium heat, and maintained under 1% isoflurane as urethane (1.7 g/kg, i.v.; 0.7 g/ml in distilled water) was slowly infused (6 ml/h; Harvard Apparatus syringe pump) until the absence of hindlimb withdrawal after toe pinch. Rats were then transferred to a heated surgical station where core body temperature was maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.2 \u02daC (model 700 TC-1000, CWE). The trachea was cannulated, rats were pump-ventilated (Rodent Ventilator 683, Harvard Apparatus), and a bilateral vagotomy was performed. Inspired CO\n2\nwas added to maintain end-tidal CO\n2\nbetween ~45 and 50 mmHg (Capnogard, Respironics, Inc.). Tracheal pressure was continuously monitored and lungs were periodically hyperinflated (~ 1/hour, 2\u20133 breaths) via expiratory line occlusions. Femoral arterial catheter was placed to monitor blood pressure and sample blood gasses (ABL90 FLEX, Radiometer).\nUsing a dorsal approach, the left and right phrenic nerves were isolated and cut distally. The epineurium was removed at the distal end of the nerve to enable suction electrode recordings. Animals received a neuromuscular paralytic, pancuronium bromide (2.5 mg/kg, i.v., Hospira) to prevent respiratory muscle contraction during nerve recordings. A continuous infusion (1 ml/h) of a 1:4 solution (8.4% sodium bicarbonate/lactated Ringer\u2019s solution, i.v.) was maintained during the experiment. Adequacy of anesthesia was monitored prior to the start of each experimental protocol by assessing arterial blood pressure response to toe-pinch. Urethane supplements (0.2 ml bolus) were given in the event of toe pinch response. Experiments were started at least 20 minutes after the discontinuation of I.V. urethane and once the amplitude and frequency of inspiratory phrenic bursts were stable.\nBilateral phrenic nerve output was recorded using custom-made bipolar suction electrodes filled with 0.9% saline. Compound action potentials were amplified (x10 kHz, Grass Instruments, P511), analog bandpass filtered (3 Hz- 3 kHz), digitized [16 bit, 25 k samples/s/channel; Power1401, Cambridge Electronic Design, (CED)], and integrated (time constant: 20 ms) with Spike2 software (CED).\n\nExperimental protocols\nFor each experimental time point, rats were exposed to one of three treatments (N=8 per group for both 2-week and 8-week time points): Ampakine alone (15 mg/kg, i.v.; 5 mg/ml in 10% HPCD solution), Ampakine followed by hypoxia (12.5% inspired O\n2\n) (ampakine + hypoxia), or vehicle (10% HPCD, matched to CX717 volume, i.v.) followed by hypoxia (HPCD + hypoxia) as a control. In preliminary studies we observed that the acute effects of ampakine CX717 on phrenic motor output are evident rapidly following the i.v. infusion, with a modest increase in burst amplitude observed after approximately 2 minutes. Our\na priori\ngoal was to provide the acute hypoxic exposure during the period associated with the peak effects of ampakine. Previous work has shown that this protocol produces a sustained increase in phrenic motor amplitude in spinal-intact rats (\nWollman et al., 2020\n). Accordingly, a single episode of hypoxia (5-min duration) was initiated 2-minutes following the ampakine or vehicle infusions. Recordings were maintained for 90-minutes following each treatment. The primary hypotheses focused on phrenic motor output during the stable conditions associated with the baseline recordings (which could be considered as \u201ceupneic\u201d breathing in the anesthetized state). However, we also evaluated phrenic motor output during acute exposure to hypoxia as well an even stronger chemoreceptor challenge by briefly stopping the mechanical ventilator. This latter test produces a few \u201cgasp-like\u201d intense respiratory efforts (\nWollman et al., 2020\n), after which the ventilator was immediately turned back on. The purpose of this was to determine if the ampakine or ampakine + hypoxia treatments had influenced the output of the phrenic system during periods of intense respiratory drive.\nArterial blood samples were obtained at baseline, during the first episode of hypoxia (for treatments ampakine + hypoxia and HPCD + hypoxia), and at approximately the 20-, 40-, 60-, and 90-minute time points. If baseline PaCO\n2\nwas not between 40\u201350 mmHg or if subsequent PaCO\n2\nvalues were not within 2 mmHg of baseline, inspired CO\n2\nwas adjusted to bring the values back to the isocapnic range. If adjustments were made, data for that respective time point was collected during the minute prior to the acceptable blood sample.\n\nAnalyses\nAll data were collected using Spike2.v8 software (CED) and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7. Phrenic nerve burst amplitude and frequency, and mean arterial pressure and heart rate were measured. Integrated phrenic nerve amplitude was reported as absolute amplitude (at baseline) and % above baseline and phrenic burst frequency was expressed as bursts per minute. Heart rate was expressed as beats per minute and mean arterial pressure (MAP), expressed as mmHg, was calculated using the following equation: MAP = [Systolic Blood Pressure + (2 x Diastolic Blood Pressure)] / 3. Arterial partial pressure CO\n2\n(PaCO\n2\n), O\n2\n(PaO\n2\n), and pH were obtained from arterial blood samples. The cardiovascular and respiratory response to acute i.v. ampakine (or vehicle solution) consistently peaked ~ 2 minutes after the start of i.v. infusion. Therefore, data representing the peak response to ampakine or vehicle were averaged over the third minute after the start of infusion.\nData from time points associated with arterial blood gas measurements were averaged over the 1-minute period prior withdrawal of the blood sample. Data from the final hypoxia challenge was averaged over the third minute after the onset of hypoxia. The peak response to maximal chemoreceptor activation was measured from the largest single burst amplitude that occurred during the ventilator off challenge (usually the last burst prior to apnea).\nData from 48 rats (n=8 in each experimental group). Age, body weight, and baseline phrenic burst amplitude and frequency, heart rate and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were all evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to statically compare the proportion of rats which responded to ampakine or vehicle with an increase in phrenic burst amplitude. We did this because in several cases the baseline phrenic output recorded ipsilateral to the C2Hx lesion was either absent or too small to reliably quantify. Such data points could not be included in the calculation of the phrenic output as \u201c% baseline\u201d and could therefore not be included in the associated statistical tests. The Fisher\u2019s exact test allowed us to include all the data points in the statistical testing. Phrenic nerve responses to acute hypoxia and the brief period of withholding ventilator support to maximally stimulate chemoreceptors were evaluated using one-way ANOVA. The response to hypoxia or maximal chemoreceptor stimulation in ampakine versus vehicle treated rats was compared using Student\u2019s unpaired t-test. The acute responses to ampakine or vehicle solution (HPCD) were compared using two-way ANOVA. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare inspiratory phrenic burst amplitude, frequency, heart rate, MAP, and arterial blood gas data between the three treatment groups. When appropriate, individual multiple comparisons were made using Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison\npost hoc\ntest. Statistical significance was assumed if P \u2264 0.05. Mean data are presented with \u00b1 1 standard deviation."

Heterozygous\ndb/+\nmice (B6.BKS(D)-Lepr\n<db/+>/\nJ) were used as euglycemic controls. Male db/db and db/+ mice (Jackson Laboratories, Sacramento, CA) were used in experiments involving experimental stroke to eliminate potential effects caused by sex hormones, while female mice as well as males were used in other experiments. Mice were housed 5 per cage on a 12h dark/light cycle with food and water access ad libitum. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the\nGuide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n, and reported in compliance with\nAnimals in Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines\n(\nKilkenny et al., 2011\n;\nPercie du Sert et al., 2019\n), and were approved by the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were coded at the beginning of the experiment. The identity of each mouse subject was blinded to investigators who conducted the experiments and data analysis.\n\nIschemic Stroke\nIschemic stroke was induced by distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) as previously described (\nAkamatsu et al., 2015\n). An incision was made on the scalp to expose the calvaria over the bilateral cerebral hemispheres. The left common carotid artery (CCA) was isolated and dissected out, with a nylon suture placed across the CCA from the bottom for future ligation. Along the sagittal suture, a straight skin incision was made, and the scalp was drawn back. After creating a 1.5 mm diameter burr hole 1.2 mm rostral to the anterior junction of the zygoma and temporalis bone with a dental drill, the dura was exposed with a fine needle. Then, the main trunk of the left MCA was permanently occluded with electric cauterizer. followed by transient ligation of the ipsilateral CCA for 60 minutes. Sham animals did not receive either MCA or CCA occlusion.\n\nPeripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell isolation\nBlood was collected by cardiac puncture with anti-coagulant ACD (Catalog No. sc-214744, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) and mixed with an equal volume of balanced salt solution (0.1 g/L anhydrous D-glucose, 0.00074 g/L CaCl\n2\n\u00b72H\n2\nO, 0.01992 g/L MgCl\n2\n\u00b76H\n2\nO, 0.04026 g/L KCl, 1.7565 g/L TRIS, 7.371 g/L NaCl). Mononuclear cells were collected from the interface between 2 layers following centrifugation at 500g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C in Ficoll-Paque gradient (Catalog No. 17-5446-02, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL).\n\nBrain Mononuclear Cell isolation\nThree days post-surgery, ipsilateral forebrain hemispheres were harvested after cardiac perfusion with heparinized GKN buffer (8 g/L NaCl, 0.4 g/L KCl, 1.41 g/L Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.6 g/L NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2 g/L D(+) glucose, pH 7.4). The tissues were digested in NOSE buffer (4.0 g/L MgCl\n2\n, 2.55 g/L CaCl\n2\n, 3.73 g/L KCl, 8.95 g/L NaCl, pH 6\u20137) supplemented with 200 U/ml DNase I (Catalog No. D5025-150KU, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 0.2 mg/ml collagenase type I (Catalog No. L5004196, Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Thoroughly washed cells were subjected to an isotonic Percoll gradient (90% Percoll, Catalog No. 17-0891-01, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL) by suspending cells in 4 mL of 1.03g/mL Percoll in GKN buffer/0.2%BSA and overlaying cell suspension on 4 mL of 1.095 g/mL Percoll in PBS/0.2%BSA. After centrifugation at 900xg for 20 min at RT, the cells were collected from the interface, washed, and processed further for FACS staining and analysis.\n\nBone marrow isolation\nIsoflurane sedation followed by cervical dislocation were used to sacrifice the mice. The tibia and femur were removed, the bone ends were carefully snipped off, and the bone marrow was flushed out with Mg\n2+\n/Ca\n2+\n-rich PBS. After centrifugation, the bone marrow pellet was resuspended and treated with 5 mL of 1X red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer (Catalog No. 00-4333-57, eBioscience, San Diego, CA) for 5 min and thoroughly washed with PBS. After washing, the mononuclear cells were collected and processed.\n\nBone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM)\nAfter isolating the bone marrow, the cells were plated into 3 non-TC coated petri dishes 10 cm in diameter per femur and tibia. The cells were cultured in MEM-alpha (Catalog No. 012571-063, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin-streptomycin, glutamine, and 15% CMG-conditioned medium containing M-CSF for 7 days in a 37\u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\nincubator. On day 8, the confluent cells were harvested following incubation in enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Catalog No. 13151-014, Life Technologies), and stored frozen at \u221280\u00b0C in Recovery Cell Culture Freezing Medium (Catalog No. 12648010, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for future use. Frozen cells were thawed and cultured overnight in a 37\u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\nincubator in either medium containing 5 mM glucose (normal glucose environment) or 25 mM glucose (high glucose environment) to mimic hyperglycemia.\n\nFlow Cytometry\nMononuclear cells were suspended in 100 \u03bcL FACS buffer and blocked with 1\u03bcL anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (clone 93, Catalog No. 14-0161-85, eBioscience) for 20 min. The cells were immunostained for 30 min in the dark with 1\u03bcL of each of the following antibodies against: CD11b (clone M1/70, PerCP 5.5, Catalog No. 45-0112-82, eBioscience), CD45 (clone 30-F11, FITC, Catalog No. 11-0451-81, eBioscience), Ly6G Gr-1 (clone 1A8-Ly6G, PE-eFluor 610, Catalog No. AB_2574679, eBioscience), CD36 (clone CRF D-2712, PE, Catalog No. 562702 BD Pharmingen; clone 72-1,PE, Catalog No. 12-0361-82, eBioscience), IgG Isotype control (clone M18-254, PE, Catalog No. 562141, BD Pharmingen; clone eBR2a, PE, Catalog No. 12-4321-82, eBioscience), and fixable viability dye (eFluor 506, Catalog No. 65-0866-14, eBioscience). 50 \u03bcL Absolute counting beads (Catalog No.\nC36950\n, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) were used for cell counting. After washing, the cells were resuspended in 100 \u03bcL of FACS buffer and 100 \u03bcL 2% PFA. Data were acquired using a BD FACS ARIAIII and were analyzed using FlowJo v10 software (FlowJo). BMDM cell death rate was calculated as (100%- %viability).\n\nELISA\nThe concentration of soluble CD36 (sCD36) in platelet poor plasma was measured by Mouse CD36 ELISA kit (Catalog No. ELM-CD36, RayBiotec, Peachtree Corners, GA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The detection range was between 30 pg/mL and 20,000 pg/mL.\n\noxLDL uptake assay\ndb/+ and db/db BMDM were plated in 96-well plates at 1\u20133 \u00d7 10\n4\ncells/well and incubated overnight in 37\u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\n. The following day, half of the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0Cwith DiI-labeled oxLDL (Catalog No.\nL34357\n, 10 \u03bcg/ml) in either normal (5 mM) or high (25 mM) concentration of glucose for 2 hrs. Cells were harvested, fixed with 2% PFA for 15 min on the shaker, and washed thoroughly with 0.1 M PB. They were then counterstained with DAPI (0.1 ug/mL) for 15 mins on the shaker at RT. After thoroughly washing the cells with 0.1M PB, they were stored in PB with 0.2% sodium azide at 4 \u00b0C until further analysis. The remaining other half of cells were incubated with antibodies to FITC-anti-mouse CD45 (clone 30-F11, Catalog No. 11-0451-81, eBioscience, 1:50 dilution) and PE-anti-mouse CD36 (clone CRF D-2712, Catalog No. 562702 and 72-1, Catalog No. 12-0361-82) for 30 minutes followed by washing in PBS and fixing in 4% PFA.\nDiI signals were examined using high speed widefield/confocal microscopy (Nikon Ti Microscope, Andor Borealis CSU-W1 spinning disk confocal, 40x/0.95 Plan APO lens). Five random images/well were captured for quantification and analysis. Images were coded and the identity of the cells and treatment were blinded to the examiner who performed cell counting based on oxLDL uptake intensity. Briefly, mean fluorescence intensity values were determined from the binary image of the RGB microscope images in Fiji. Cells were counted using \u201cAnalyze particles\u201d under the Fiji tool kit with a minimum threshold of 170 and size between 15\u2013300 pixels. Mean intensity values between 170 to 230 were categorized as low uptake cells, 230\u2013300 as medium uptake cells and 300\u2013400 as high uptake cells. False positives were excluded for cells with a maximum intensity over 1000.\n\nPioglitazone Treatment\nTwenty weeks old db/+ and db/db mice were randomly divided into two groups and treated with a regular diet (vehicle) or a pioglitazone (Catalog No. H60507MD, Alfar Aesar, Haverhill, MA)-supplemented diet (120 ppm pioglitazone chow diet, Envigo, Huntingdon, UK) for 4 weeks. At the end of 4 weeks, mice were subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test to determine treatment effect on insulin sensitivity. Mice were sacrificed the following day, and brains were harvested for FACS analysis. Additionally, 10 \u03bcMand 20 \u03bcM pioglitazone/0.01% DMSO were used to compare the uptake of DiI-labeled oxLDL in BMDM cultured in the presence of normal (5 mM) or high (25 mM) glucose for 24 hr in medium. 0.01% DMSO was used as the vehicle control.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nData were expressed as Mean \u00b1 SD. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test was used to determine whether data were normally distributed. Log transformation was used to bring back normality of data in\nFigure 6B\n. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA (\nFigures 3\n,\n4\n,\n8A\n-\nD\n), or two-way ANOVA for strain and temporal effects (\nFigure 2\n), strain and pioglitazone effects (\nFigure 5A\n,\nC\n&\nD\n,\n8C\n) or for strain and glucose effects (\nFigure 6B\n,\n6F\n-\nG\n,\n7\n,\n8B\n); followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test using Prism 8 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.\nFigure 6. T2DM or hyperglycemia interferes with oxLDL uptake.\nOpen in a new tab\nA\n, the amount of DiI-oxLDL uptake in BMDM cells was divided into low or no uptake (green bell), medium uptake (white circle) and high uptake (solid white) category, depending on the fluorochrome intensity of the DiI determined by Fiji and presented as percentage of positive cells with respect to total cell number in that category in the bar graphs below.\nB\n, Representative images of DiI labeled oxLDL uptake in from db/+ or db/db BMDM cells cultured in normal glucose (NG)- or high glucose (HG)-containing medium.\nC-E,\nTwo-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test was used to analyze the data. In the normoglycemic (NG) condition fewer db/+ BMDM cells displayed low or no uptake of DiI ox-LDL compared to that of db/db cells (P< 0.01). There are also more db/+ BMDM cells with low/no uptake in the hyperglycemic (HG) culture compared to NG culture condition (P<0.01). A significant reduction (P<0.01) of cells number with medium level of uptake was found in the db/db BMDM compared to that of db+ cells when cultured in the NG medium. Moreover, DiI ox-LDL uptake was significantly reduced in db/+ BMDM in HG compared to NG medium (P<0.01). No significant difference was detected between conditions or genotypes with high uptake, likely representing non-specific binding that was seen in very few cells.\nF\n, There was a trending global effect of high glucose environment on the total number of cells taken up oxLDL (glucose effect: P= 0.06).\nG\n, Hyperglycemia also increased cell death (glucose effect: P< 0.05). *P<0.05, **P<0.01.

CD36 was significantly increased 7 days after stroke in brain macrophages in both db/+ and db/db mice. Microglia CD36 level was increased at 3 and 7 days after stroke in db/+ mice, compared to increase at 7 days after stroke in db/db. Monocytes and neutrophils in db/db blood expressed a significantly less level of CD36 than those in db/+ mice after stroke and at baseline, respectively.

    "Methods": "Animal care.\nAll experimental protocols were approved by the Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), complied with ARRIVE guidelines, and were carried out according to the NIH guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. Experiments were performed on 22 adult C57BL6 male (25-30g) and female (20-25g) mice, receiving ad libitum food and water, and maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle.\n\nSurgeries.\nMice received a unilateral C5/6 contusion SCI, as previously described (\nWatson, Hala, Putatunda, Sannie, & Lepore, 2014\n). Briefly, a unilateral laminectomy was performed, and animals received a unilateral contusion injury to the C5/6 spinal cord using the Infinite Horizon Impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation; Lexington, KY). SCI mice received an injury with an impactor tip of 0.7 mm in diameter, a force of 40 kilodynes, and a 2 second dwell time; control animals received a C5/6 laminectomy with no SCI.\n\nBehavioral testing.\nA total of 22 mice were evaluated in 2 separate trials. The first experiment was performed with 8 mice (n=4 SCI, n=4 laminectomy-only controls); in this trial, we evaluated both Hargreaves and MGS assays. The second experiment was performed with 14 mice (n=8 SCI, n=6 laminectomy-only controls); in this study, we added the von Frey assay to the previously measured Hargreaves and grimace tests to more comprehensively evaluate different modalities of NP behaviors. Therefore, Hargreaves and MGS assays have a total of 22 mice in the analysis, and the von Frey assay has a total of 14 mice in the analysis. For behavioral testing, mice were acclimated to the testing room and handled for one hour per day for five days before baseline testing, and then again for one hour before each testing session. Baseline measures were collected one week prior to surgery, and then once weekly beginning two weeks post-surgery. Week 1 post-surgery was excluded because SCI animals and laminectomy-only controls were still recovering from the surgery at this time point, and we wanted to avoid any false reductions in withdrawal responses or grimace features due to the surgery and not due to the group (SCI vs. laminectomy-only control). No more than one behavioral assay was performed per day.\nThe MGS (\nLangford et al., 2010\n) was used to measure spontaneous, non-evoked supraspinal aspects of NP after SCI. All MGS testing was performed in the morning with up to 2 mice recorded at once. The mice were placed in plexiglass \u201ccubicles\u201d about 9 x 5 x 5 cm high, the camera was placed directly in front of the animals, and the mice were recorded for 30 minutes using a RICH AV-01 Video Camera Camcorder. Videos were downloaded to a computer, identifying information was blinded to the researcher, and screenshots of the video clearly showing the mouse\u2019s face and ears were taken every 2-3 minutes. Screenshots were compiled in a Powerpoint presentation with identifying information in the notes section, and slides were randomized using a macro. Images were scored all at once at the end of the experiment by a researcher blinded both to group and timepoint of the study. For each image, orbital tightening, nose and cheek bulge, and ear position were scored 0-2 (0 = not present, 1 = somewhat present, 2 = obviously present). If a characteristic was not apparent, animals were given a score of 0 for that image feature. If the characteristic was obvious (eyes halfway closed or more, a visible bump or vertical ridges apparent down the nose, a noticeable bulge at the cheek, or ears oriented away from the face), that characteristic was given a score of 2. An intermediate phenotype was given a score of 1 (\nLangford et al., 2010\n). We omitted scoring change in whisker position because the whiskers were not always visible on the black mice in the video. The scores of the four categories for each image were averaged together. All of the images per timepoint were then averaged together to generate the grimace score for that mouse for each timepoint.\nModified versions of the Hargreaves and von Frey filament tests were used to measure thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, respectively, in the ipsilateral forepaw, as previously described (\nWatson et al., 2014\n). For the Hargreaves test, mice were restrained by scruffing, with one forepaw held loosely on a glass pane directly above the infrared stimulus, and the time to withdrawal from the stimulus was recorded. We chose to loosely restrain the mice for technical reasons \u2013 when mice are placed in cubicles, they often balance on their hindpaws and place their forepaws up on the plexiglass walls of the cubicles. While this method works well to evaluate hindpaw pain behaviors (for example, after a thoracic SCI), when they are in this position with their forepaws up, it is impossible for the thermal or mechanical stimulus to reach their forepaws and it makes evaluating at-level NP behaviors after a cervical SCI very difficult. Therefore, we used this modified scruffing method to allow the stimulus to reach the anatomical area of interest. We and others have previously published several studies with an interval of 120 seconds between trials for behavioral assays (\nDetloff, Wade, & Houle, 2013\n;\nWatson et al., 2014\n). We do not see any within-day sensitization to the heat stimulus (i.e. Trial 3 is not significantly different from Trial 1 for each animal). We also do not see any chronic sensitization (i.e. in uninjured mice, Week 5 post-surgery is no different than baseline). Therefore, during each Hargreaves session, three trials were conducted for each forepaw with a 120-second interval between each trial. For the von Frey test, mice were placed on top of a wire mesh and loosely restrained by scruffing, and von Frey filaments were applied to the plantar surface of the forepaw. 10 filaments were applied according to the up-down method, with a 120-second interval between each application. Forepaw withdrawal for Hargreaves and von Frey was defined by a quick removal of the paw from the infrared or mechanical stimulus, as well as a supraspinal or cognitive awareness of stimulus (i.e. licking or flapping of the forepaw, guarding of the forepaw, vocalization); spontaneous movements were not recorded and the trial was repeated. Cutoffs of 30 seconds for the Hargreaves test and 2g of force for the von Frey test were used to prevent damage to the animal\u2019s paw.\n\nStatistics.\nExperiments included both male and female mice, and no differences between sexes were observed. Behavioral assays were analyzed using a repeated measures two-way ANOVA, with comparisons made over time and between groups. Linear regression analyses were used to compare the relationship between the evoked and spontaneous behavioral assays. Statistics were calculated with Graphpad Prism 8. Assignment of mice to groups, surgical procedures, and behavioral analyses were conducted in a blinded manner.\nBased on previous publications (\nOliver et al., 2014\n;\nReid et al., 2007\n;\nSchneider et al., 2017\n), we used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate the threshold for the analgesic intervention score. Diagnostic tests are useful to determine the presence or absence of a disease, but a binary yes/no diagnosis is difficult when the test uses a continuous variable as a reporter of the disease (\nHoo, Candlish, & Teare, 2017\n). In these cases, an ROC curve is often used as a statistical tool to determine the binary threshold value (\nHoo et al., 2017\n). Using GraphPad Prism, an ROC curve was generated by tabulating all of the possible values for the threshold, as well as the sensitivity (true positive rate) and 1-specificity (false positive rate) (\nHoo et al., 2017\n). The area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve is a measure of how accurate the ROC curve can distinguish between the disease and non-disease groups, with an AUC of 1.0 meaning perfect distinction between the two groups and an AUC of 0.5 meaning the test cannot distinguish between the two groups at all. We then chose the optimum cutoff value that maximized both sensitivity and 1-specificity, or the value that was closest to the upper left corner of the ROC curve."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nExperiments were conducted on adult (3\u20134 months old) male Sprague Dawley rats (Envigo Colony 208; Indianapolis, IN). Rats were housed in pairs and maintained under a 12:12 light:dark cycle. Animals had access to a standard commercial pelleted diet and water ad libitum. All procedures in this manuscript were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Missouri in accordance with National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The University of Missouri is an AAALAC-accredited institution that operates under Animal Welfare Assurance ID A3394\u201301.\n\n2.2. Intrapleural injections\nRats received bilateral intrapleural injections (6 mm deep, fifth intercostal space) using a 50 \u03bcl Hamilton syringe and a custom needle (6 mm, 23 gauge, semi-blunt to prevent lung puncture) while under isoflurane anesthesia (1.5% in 100% oxygen as previously described by\nMantilla et al. (2009)\n. Control rats were intrapleurally injected with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB; 25 \u03bcg dissolved in doubly distilled H\n2\nO; Calbiochem; Billerica, MA) unconjugated to saporin (SAP; 25 \u03bcg dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS); Advanced Targeting Systems; San Diego, CA) to enable comparisons for respiratory plasticity. CTB conjugated to saporin (CTB-SAP; 25 \u03bcg dissolved in PBS; Advanced Targeting Systems; San Diego, CA) was intrapleurally injected to target respiratory motor neurons as described previously (\nNichols et al., 2015b\n,\n2017\n). CTB-SAP treated rats also received an additional 20 \u03bcg of CTB dissolved in double distilled H\n2\nO (Calbiochem; Billerica, MA) in their administered intrapleural injections. Rats were then monitored to ensure respiration was not compromised following intrapleural injections and were housed for 7 or 28 days before the below surgical preparation and neurophysiological experiments were performed.\n\n2.3. Surgical preparation\nExperimental procedures were performed as described previously (e.g.,\nHoffman et al., 2012\n;\nNichols et al., 2018\n). Briefly, rats were isoflurane anesthetized, tracheotomized, and ventilated (Small Animal SAR-1000 Ventilator; CWE, Ardmore, PA, USA; tidal volume ~ 2.5 mL, frequency ~ 70\u201380 breaths per minute). Rats remained under isoflurane anesthesia (3.5% in 50% O\n2\n, balance N\n2\n) throughout surgical procedures before being converted to urethane anesthesia over 15\u201320 min (1.85 g kg\n\u2212 1\n,\ni.v.\n) while isoflurane was slowly withdrawn. Once converted to urethane anesthesia, rats were then paralyzed using pancuronium bromide for neuromuscular blockade (2.5 mg kg\n\u2212 1\ni.v.\n). To maintain body fluid and acid-base balance, rats were given a 1:2:0.13 mixture of 6% Hetastarch (in 0.9% sodium chloride), lactated Ringer's solution, and 8.4% sodium bicarbonate via continuous intravenous infusion (1.5\u20136 mL kg\n\u2212 1\nh\n\u2212 1\n). Lack of the pressor responses or obvious respiratory neural responses to a toe pinch with a hemostat was used to confirm the adequacy of anesthesia before and immediately after surgical and neurophysiological protocols were complete. Body temperature was maintained (37 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) with a custom-made heated surgical table, and was accessed with a rectal thermometer (Physitemp, Clifton, NJ, USA). Throughout the surgical preparation, end-tidal PCO\n2\n(P\nETCO2\n) was maintained at ~45 mmHg and monitored with a flow-through carbon dioxide analyzer designed to sufficiently measure response time for P\nETCO2\nmeasurements in rats (CapStar-100, CWE, Ardmore, PA).\nRats were bilaterally vagotomized and blood pressure was monitored in the right femoral artery by the insertion of a polyethylene catheter (PE50 ID: 0.58 mm, OD: 0.965 mm; Intramedic, MD, USA) connected to a pressure transducer (APT300 Pressure Transducer, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). Arterial blood samples were taken during baseline, the first hypoxic episode, and at 15, 30 and at 60 min post-AIH and analyzed for partial pressures of O\n2\n(PO\n2\n) and CO\n2\n(PCO\n2\n), pH, and base excess (BE) using a blood gas analyzer (ABL80 Flex, Radiometer, Brea, CA).\nThrough a dorsal approach, the left phrenic nerve was isolated, distally cut, desheathed, and covered with a saline soaked cotton ball until it was placed on a bipolar silver electrode (described in the following section). For intrathecal delivery of drugs (see below), a laminectomy was performed at cervical level 2 (C2), and a small incision was made in the dura. A soft silicone intrathecal catheter (2 Fr, Access Technologies, Skokie, IL) was caudally inserted subdurally (3\u20134 mm) until the tip of the catheter rested over the phrenic motor nucleus in the C4 section of the spinal cord. The catheter was attached to a 50 \u03bcl Hamilton syringe filled with drug or vehicle solutions as described below. A minimum of 1 h was allowed following the conversion to urethane anesthesia before neurophysiological recordings began to eliminate the dampening effect of isoflurane on phrenic nerve output.\n\n2.4. Neurophysiological recordings\nThe left phrenic nerve was submerged in mineral oil and placed on bipolar silver electrodes to record nerve activity. Neural signals were amplified (10,000 \u00d7), band-pass filtered (300\u201310,000 Hz, Model 1800, A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA, USA), full-wave rectified, and integrated (50 ms time constant, MA-821, CWE Inc., Ardmore, PA, USA). Integrated nerve bursts were digitized (8 kHz) and analyzed using a WINDAQ data acquisition system (DATAQ Instruments, Akron, OH, USA).\n\n2.5. Experimental protocol\nApneic and recruitment thresholds were determined at least 1-h post urethane anesthesia conversion. First, ventilation was increased and P\nETCO2\nwas reduced until rhythmic nerve bursts had ceased (i.e., apneic threshold). After 1 min of nerve cessation, the ventilator rate was decreased and P\nETCO2\nwas slowly increased until the resumption of rhythmic nerve bursts occurred (i.e., recruitment threshold). To establish baseline conditions, P\nETCO2\nwas held approximately 2 mmHg above the recruitment threshold until stabilization of neural activity had occurred (\u226515 min). A baseline arterial blood sample was taken to document baseline blood gas levels. Following baseline measurements, rats were exposed to three 5-min episodes of isocapnic (\u00b1 1.5 mmHg) acute intermittent hypoxia [10% inspired O\n2\n, arterial PO\n2\n(PaO\n2\n): 35\u201345 mmHg] separated by 5-min intervals of baseline O\n2\nconditions (50% inspired O\n2\n, PaO\n2\n: \u2265 150 mmHg). Rats were returned to baseline inspired O\n2\nlevels after the third bout of hypoxia, and inspired O\n2\nlevels were maintained for the duration of the experiments. Manipulation of inspired CO\n2\nand/or the ventilation rate was done to maintain isocapnic arterial PCO\n2\n(PaCO\n2\n) within \u00b1 1.5 mmHg of the respective baseline value.\n\n2.6. Intrathecal drug delivery protocol\nTo test the hypothesis that new spinal TrkB and/or BDNF protein synthesis are required for AIH-induced pLTF, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting BDNF and TrkB mRNA were injected via an intrathecal catheter over the cervical spinal cord (~C4) before AIH to prevent the translation and new BDNF or TrkB protein synthesis. TrkB siRNAs were obtained as a pool of four 21-nucleotide duplexes (siTrkB; ON-TARGET plus, Dharmacon; gene,\nRat NTRK2\n; GenBank Accession No.\nNM 012731\n, Lafayette, CO); this same pool has been shown previously to effectively block new TrkB synthesis using the same experimental preparation.(\nGolder et al., 2008\n) BDNF siRNAs were also obtained as a pool of four 21-nucleotide duplexes (siBDNF; ON-TARGET plus, Dharmacon; gene,\nRat BDNF\n; GenBank accession number,\nNM012513\n); these same pool has also previously been shown to prevent new synthesis of spinal BDNF in the same experimental preparation.(\nBaker-Herman et al., 2004\n) We used a nontargeting siRNA sequence (siNT; ON-TARGETplus Nontargeting siRNA #1; Dharmacon) as a negative control for potential non-specific effects of siRNAs. siRNAs were reconstituted with siRNA universal buffer (Dharmacon), and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. Stock siTrkB or siBDNF (4 \u03bcl of 5 \u03bcM solution) was combined with: siNT (4 \u03bcl of 5 \u03bcM solution) so that the same amount of total siRNA was used for all groups; the transfection reagent, oligofectamine (32 \u03bcl, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA); and RNase-free water (160 \u03bcl, final concentration: 100 nM), and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. siNT experiments were performed by taking the stock siNT solution (8 \u03bcl of 5 \u03bcM solution), oligofectamine (32 \u03bcl), and RNase-free water (160 \u03bcl; final concentration, 100 nM), and then incubated as described above. siRNAs were slowly injected 2 h before baseline measurements and AIH exposures and were performed over the C4 spinal segment via an intrathecal catheter (two, 10 \u03bcl injections separated by 10 min). 7d control treated control groups included three groups that received AIH treatment: 1) siBDNF (\nn\n= 6), 2) siTrkB (n = 6), and 3) siNT (\nn\n= 8); and one group that received no AIH treatment: time controls (TCs; 32 \u03bcl oligofectamine, 168 \u03bcl of RNase-free water;\nn\n= 4). 28d control treated control groups included three groups that received AIH treatment: 1) siBDNF (\nn\n= 7), 2) siTrkB (\nn\n= 6), and 3) siNT (\nn\n= 8); and one group that received no AIH treatment: TCs (\nn\n= 4). 7d CTB-SAP treated groups included three groups that received AIH treatment: 1) siBDNF (\nn\n= 6), 2) siTrkB (n = 6), and 3) siNT (n = 6), and one group that received no AIH treatment: TCs (\nn\n= 3). 28d CTB-SAP treated groups included three groups that received AIH treatment: 1) siBDNF (n = 6), 2) siTrkB (\nn\n= 8), and 3) siNT (n = 8); and one group that received no AIH treatment: TCs (n = 4). All TC treated rats were grouped together within control and CTB-SAP rats. Approximately 2 h after siRNA delivery, animals were exposed to either AIH or no AIH (TC), and phrenic nerve activity was recorded for 60 min after AIH or sham AIH.\nAdditionally, selective inhibitors were intrathecally injected for MEK/ERK (UO126, [1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(o-aminophenylmercapto)butadiene; 12 \u03bcl, 100 \u03bcM; MEK/ERK inhibitor; Promega]), and PI3K/Akt (PI828 [2-(4-Morpholinyl)-8-(4-aminopheny)l-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one; 12 \u03bcl, 100 \u03bcM; PI3K/Akt inhibitor; Tocris Bioscience]) to evaluate their involvement in AIH-induced pLTF. 7d control treated groups included the following: 1) UO126 + AIH (n = 7), 2) UO126 TC (n = 4), 3) PI828 + AIH (n = 7), 4) PI828 TC (n = 3), and 5) vehicle + AIH (12 \u03bcl, 20% DMSO; n = 6). 28d control treated groups included the following: 1) UO126 + AIH (n = 6), 2) UO126 TC (n = 4), 3) PI828 + AIH (n = 7), 4) PI828 TC (n = 4), and 5) vehicle + AIH (n = 8). 7d CTB-SAP treated groups included the following: 1) UO126 + AIH (n = 6), 2) UO126 TC (n = 4), 3) PI828 + AIH (\nn\n= 7), 4) PI828 TC (n = 3), and 5) vehicle + AIH (n = 6). 28d CTB-SAP treated groups included the following: 1) UO126 + AIH (\nn\n= 7), 2) UO126 TC (\nn\n= 5), 3) PI828 + AIH (n = 7), 4) PI828 TC (n = 3), and 5) vehicle + AIH (\nn\n= 8). All TC treated rats were grouped together within control and CTB-SAP rats. Approximately 20 min after drug or vehicle delivery, animals were exposed to either AIH or no AIH (TC), and phrenic nerve activity was recorded for 60 min after AIH or sham AIH.\n\n2.7. Data and statistical analysis\nIntegrated phrenic nerve burst amplitudes were averaged over 1 min during baseline and 15, 30, and 60 min after AIH. Peak integrated inspiratory phrenic nerve bursts at baseline were similar within treatment groups; thus nerve bursts were normalized to baseline measurements to appropriately quantify the magnitude of pLTF (expressed as a percentage change from baseline). Statistical comparisons between treatment groups for AIH studies (amplitude, PaCO\n2\n, PaO\n2\n, pH, BE, and mean arterial pressure) were done using a two-way ANOVA with a repeated-measures design. Comparisons of the short-term hypoxic phrenic response were made using a one-way ANOVA, in which phrenic burst amplitude during the fifth minute of the first hypoxic episode was compared. For TC rats receiving no AIH exposure, a two-way ANOVA with repeated-measures design was performed; since there were no differences among them, they were grouped into a single TC group within control and CTB-SAP rats (siTC control, n = 8; siTC CTB-SAP, n = 7; UO126 TC control, n = 8; UO126 TC CTB-SAP,\nn\n= 9; PI828 TC control, n = 7; and PI828 TC CTB-SAP,\nn\n= 6). A one-way ANOVA was used when comparing phrenic nerve burst amplitudes across groups at 60 min post-hypoxia. A one-way ANOVA with ranks was used when comparing phrenic nerve burst frequency (expressed as an absolute change from baseline (bursts/min)) across groups at 60 min post-hypoxia. When significant ANOVA differences were detected, individual comparisons were made with Fisher's least significant difference post hoc test (Sigma Plot version 13.0; Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Differences between the groups were considered significant if\np\n< 0.05; all values are expressed as means \u00b1 S.E.M."

    "Methods": "The experimental procedures in this study were performed after obtaining approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of Brown University and of Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island. All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.\n\n2.1. Preparation of IAIPs\nIAIPs were produced and purified as previously described in detail (\nLim, 2013\n;\nOpal et al., 2011\n;\nSpasova et al., 2014\n). Briefly, IAIPs were extracted from fresh frozen human plasma (Rhode Island Blood Center, RI, USA). A scalable purification process was used to extract IAIPs with a monolithic anion-exchange chromatographic media (CIMmultusTM, BIA Separation, Ajdov\u0161\u010dina, Slovenia), and an additional separation step using a proprietary synthetic chemical ligand affinity chromatographic media (Astrea Bioseparations, Cambridge, UK) was applied to obtain high yield, high purity (>90%), and biologically active human plasma-derived IAIPs. Eluted proteins were concentrated and buffer-exchanged using a tangential flow filtration device (Labscale TFF System, MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA) using Pellicon XL50 cartridge with 30 kDa cut-off Biomax membrane (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA). Analyses of the purity and biological activity of IAIPs were performed using SDS-PAGE, Western immunoblot, protein assay, and competitive immunoassay. The biological activity was measured based on the ability of IAIPs to inhibit the hydrolysis of N-benzoyl-L-arginine-p-nitroaniline HCl (L-BAPNA, MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) by trypsin (\nLim et al., 2005\n;\nThrelkeld et al., 2014\n). Inhibition was observed by a decrease in the rate of change in absorbance per minute at 405\u2013410 nm wavelengths (\nLim et al., 2005\n). Endotoxin in the purified products was monitored using a limulus amebocyte lysate endotoxin-based chromogenic test (Pierce Biotechnology, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The chromatographic equipment and containers/tubing were treated with 1 M NaOH to reduce or eliminate potential endotoxin contamination during the purification process.\n\n2.2. Animal preparation, surgical procedures, experimental design, and necropsies\nPregnant Wistar rats at embryonic day 15 or 16 were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA) and housed in a temperature controlled, 12-hour light/dark-cycled facility with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water in the Animal Care Facility at Brown University. The dates upon which the rat pups were delivered were confirmed and designated as postnatal day zero (P0). Litters were culled to a maximum of 10 pups on P1 such that there were as close to equal numbers of male and female pups within each litter as possible to reduce intra-litter variability.\nThe Rice-Vannucci method was used to induce HI in the neonatal rats (\nRice et al., 1981\n). At P7, the pups were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Sham-operated controls (Sham), HI placebo-treated (HI-PL), or HI IAIP-treated (HI-IAIP). Surgery was performed after anesthetic induction with 4% isoflurane and maintained with 2% isoflurane using a Vapomatic Anesthetic Vaporizer (Bickford Anesthesia Equipment, Wales Center, NY, USA). Rat pup sex was documented. The rat pups were placed in a supine position on a heated surgical platform to maintain body temperature at 36\u00b0C during surgery. A small vertical midline incision of 0.5\u20131 cm was made above the suprasternal notch and the right common carotid artery was isolated from the trachea and surrounding veins and nerves to specifically avoid the vagus nerve. Two sterilized 5\u20130 silk sutures were looped around the right common carotid artery and tied tightly with two double knots in the HI-PL and HI-IAIP groups. In the Sham group, an equivalent incision was made, but the right common carotid artery was not ligated. The incision was closed and disinfected with betadine and 70% ethanol. Each pup was marked with tail ink injections for identification (Neo-9, Animal Identification & Marking Systems, Inc., Hornell, NY, USA), and returned to the dam for 1.5\u20133 h before exposure to hypoxia.\nWe have previously shown that 90 minutes of hypoxia (8% oxygen plus 92% nitrogen) induces moderate to severe HI related brain injury in HI-PL treated male and female neonatal rats (\nChen et al., 2019\n). Thus, in the present studies, we placed pups in a temperature-controlled oxygen/hypoxia (8% oxygen with 92% nitrogen) airtight chamber (Biospherix, Parish, NY, USA) for 120 minutes in order to induce severe brain damage in the neonatal rats (\nFernandez-Lopez et al., 2007\n;\nGeddes et al., 2001\n;\nVannucci et al., 1997\n;\nVannucci and Hagberg, 2004\n). One non-ligated sentinel pup per litter had a rectal temperature probe inserted with an accuracy of 0.1\u00b0C (RET-4, Physitemp, Clifton, NJ, USA) to monitor body temperature before and during hypoxia. The sentinel pup was not further included in the experimental investigations because it has been shown that the stress experienced during the placement of the rectal probe alters the outcome of the HI related brain injury (\nThoresen et al., 1996\n;\nThoresen et al., 2009\n). In addition, rectal temperature has been shown to reflect brain temperature accurately in the HI rodent model (\nDingley et al., 2006\n;\nThoresen et al., 1996\n). The rectal temperature was recorded every 10 minutes during hypoxia and maintained at 36.0\u00b0C (\nOsredkar et al., 2014\n;\nThoresen et al., 2009\n). Sham subjects were placed in a similar chamber and remained in room air for 120 minutes.\nThe experimental designs for our study are illustrated in\nFigure 1\n. After recovery from surgery and exposure to hypoxia for 2 hours, the immediate treatment group (\nFigure 1A\n) was given three intraperitoneal (I.P., open arrows) injections of 60 mg/kg of human plasma-derived IAIPs (ProThera Biologics, Inc., Providence, RI, USA) immediately (time zero), 24, and 48 hours after the termination of hypoxia. In the delayed treatment group (\nFigure 1B\n), the pups were treated with I.P. injections of IAIPs (60 mg/kg, open arrows) at 1, 24, and 48 hours after the termination of hypoxia. We have previously shown that treatment with 30 mg/kg of IAIPs attenuates the development of HI related brain injury after exposure to 90 minutes of hypoxia (\nChen et al., 2019\n;\nThrelkeld et al., 2014\n). In the current study, we elected to utilize a larger dose of IAIPs (60 mg/kg) in an effort to attenuate the potentially more extensive brain injury resulting from severe HI. The Sham treated groups were given phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or IAIPs, and HI-PL treated groups were given equivalent I.P. injection volumes of placebo (PBS) administered as described above. Separate time-matched, Sham or HI-PL pups were included for both immediate and delayed treatment groups for the measurement of infarct volumes.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Schematic for immediate treatment with IAIPs. The pups were returned to the dams for 1.5 to 3 hours after right common carotid artery ligation. Thereafter, the pups were exposed to 8% oxygen with balanced nitrogen for 120 minutes at a constant temperature of 36 \u00b0C. Sixty mg/kg of human blood derived IAIPs or placebo were given intraperitoneally (I.P.) immediately (zero), 24 and 48 hours after termination of hypoxia. Body weight was measured before surgery, immediately (zero), 24, 48 and 72 hours after hypoxia. Seventy-two hours after hypoxia, necropsy was performed, and brain weight obtained. (B) Schematic for the delayed treatment with IAIPs. The procedures were the same as for the schematic in A except that IAIPs or placebo were given 1, 24 and 48 hours after the termination of hypoxia. Body weight was measured before surgery, 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours after hypoxia. Seventy-two hours after hypoxia, necropsy was performed, and brain weight obtained. The \u2212 / + signs indicate the time (hours) before/after the end of hypoxia (0 hour). IAIPs = Inter-Alpha Inhibitor proteins, PBS = phosphate buffered saline.\nThe Sham treated groups received IAIPs (60 mg/kg, n = 11) or an equivalent volume of PBS (n = 9) in the immediate treatment group, and IAIPs (n = 21) or PBS (n = 19) in the delayed treatment groups. Differences were not observed in the values for any of the measured variables between the IAIP Sham or PBS Sham treated groups in either immediate or delayed treatment groups. Therefore, the IAIP and PBS Sham treated groups were combined into a single Sham group in both the immediate and delayed study groups.\nEach pup was weighed before surgery, at the time of each IAIP or placebo injection, and at 72 hours after HI (body weights, solid circles). The brains were collected 72 hours after hypoxia (\nFigure 1\n, stars). The pups were sedated with a mixture of ketamine (74 mg/kg, I.P.) and xylazine (4 mg/kg, I.P.). Brains were perfused with PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) via cardiac puncture at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. Thereafter, the brains were removed, weighed, post-fixed in PFA for 24 hours, and stored in 30% sucrose in phosphate buffer (0.1 M) at 4\u00b0C before cryo-sectioning for infarct volume analysis (\nChen et al., 2019\n;\nZhang et al., 2004\n).\n\n2.3. Brain sectioning\nTo measure the infarct volume of HI brain injury, the rat pup brains were cut into four or five 2 mm coronal sections using a brain slicer matrix (Zivic instruments, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), immersed in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) embedding medium (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA), and frozen in a metal beaker containing isopentane (MilliporeSigma) surrounded by crushed dry ice (\nChen et al., 2019\n;\nZhang et al., 2004\n). Five cryosections (20 \u03bcm) were obtained from each 2 mm section and mounted on gelatin-coated Superfrost\u2122 Plus microscope slides (Fisherbrand\u2122, Fisher Scientific International, Inc., Hampton, NH, USA) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C before cresyl violet staining.\n\n2.4. Cresyl violet staining\nEach 2 mm coronal brain section was further divided into histological sections for analysis. Every third cryosection from each 2 mm section was obtained for histological quantification in the immediate treatment group. On the other hand, the first cryosection of each 2 mm section was obtained for histological quantification in the delayed treatment group. Each of these sections was selected to be stained with cresyl violet for evaluation of HI injury and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until staining. The cryosections were removed from the \u221280\u00b0C freezer and air-dried overnight. After exposure to 1:1 absolute ethanol/chloroform mixture (1 mL per slide) for 20 minutes, the sections were stained with cresyl violet (0.1%, w/v, MilliporeSigma) for 4\u20135 minutes, and then rinsed in distilled water for 1 minutes. Thereafter, the sections were differentiated in 95% ethanol for 1\u20134 minutes, dehydrated in 100% ethanol, and 95% ethanol for 1\u20134 minutes each, cleared in xylene for 5 minutes twice, air-dried overnight, and mounted with Cytoseal\u2122 XYL (Richard-Allan Scientific\u2122, San Diego, CA, USA).\n\n2.5. Infarct volume measurement\nImages of the cresyl violet-stained brain sections were obtained using a Micropublisher 6 CCD Camera (Qimaging, Surrey, British Columbia, Canada) in order to measure the infarct volumes of the whole hemispheres and damaged areas of the brains in the sham, HI placebo-treated, and HI IAIP-treated groups. The resultant images were analyzed with ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) without knowledge of the group assignment. The respective volumes were calculated from each measured area by multiplying the distance between the sections. The infarct volumes were calculated as a percent ratio of the damaged hemisphere as the ratio to the total contralateral hemisphere with correction for hemispheric edema, according to the following formula: infarct (%) = [1 - (total ipsilateral hemisphere \u2013 ipsilateral hemisphere damage)/total contralateral hemisphere)] x 100% (\nLi et al., 2010\n;\nSawada et al., 2000\n;\nSwanson et al., 1990\n).\n\n2.6. Statistical analyses\nAll results were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Two factor ANOVA for repeated measures was used to compare body weight gain over time between the treatment groups. To further describe statistically significant differences in body weight gain over time in the Sham, HI-PL and HI-IAIP groups, separate ANOVAs for repeated measures were used to compare the Sham and HI-PL, Sham and HI-IAIP, and HI-PL and HI-IAIP groups over time. The body weight gain over time was also compared between the subjects in the immediate and delayed IAIP treatment groups by separate ANOVAs for repeated measures. The brain weight and infarct volume results were normally distributed based on the Shapiro Wilk W normality test, and thus were analyzed with one-way ANOVA. Sex differences in body and brain weights, and infarct volume were analyzed with factorial ANOVA to analyze interactive effects of multiple categorical independent variables (sex vs. treatment). If a significant difference was detected by ANOVA, the Tukey\u2019s honestly significant difference (HSD) test for multiple comparisons was used as a post-hoc test. The brain weights and the percent infarct volumes between the subjects in the immediate and delayed IAIP treatment groups were also compared by ANOVAs with the Tukey\u2019s honestly significant difference (HSD) test for multiple comparisons used as a post-hoc test. The generalized extreme studentized deviate (ESD) test was used to detect outliers (\nRosner, 1983\n;\nSozda et al., 2011\n;\nYou et al., 2016\n) using Excel software (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA). Outliers were only apparent in the infarct volume analysis for the delayed treatment group. Two outliers were detected in each of the sham, HI placebo-treated, and HI IAIP-treated groups and, consequently, were eliminated from the analysis. Except for the generalized ESD test, all statistical analyses were done using the STATISTICA package (TIBCO Software Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA), and a\nP\n< 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance."

Animals\nMale\nSwiss\nmice (55\u201360\u202fdays of age) were housed in groups of 8 in a cage (41\u202f\u00d7\u202f34\u202f\u00d7\u202f16\u202fcm), under controlled temperature (21\u202f\u00b1\u202f1\u202f\u00b0C) and humidity (50\u202f\u00b1\u202f20%) with a 12:12\u202fh light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00\u202fa.m.), and with free access to food and water. The animals were used according to the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the experiments were performed after approval of the protocol by the Institutional Ethics Committee.\n\n2.2. Drugs and treatments\nMice received a single administration of ketamine (1 or 5\u202fmg/kg, i.p., dissolved in 0.9% saline) or guanosine (1 or 5\u202fmg/kg, p.o., dissolved in distilled water) 1\u202fweek prior to the administration of vehicle or CORT. Both drugs were administered in a volume of 10\u202fml/kg body weight. In another set of experiments, mice were daily administered with fluoxetine (10\u202fmg/kg, p.o., dissolved in distilled water) for 3\u202fweeks before the onset of the administration of vehicle or CORT. In the last set of experiments, mice received a single administration of ketamine (1\u202fmg/kg, i.p.) plus guanosine (5\u202fmg/kg, p.o.) 1\u202fweek before the administration of vehicle or CORT. Vehicle or CORT (20\u202fmg/kg, dissolved in distilled water with 2% Tween 80 and 0.2% DMSO) was administered by gavage (p.o.) once a day (between 9:00\u202fa.m. and 10\u202fa.m.) for 21\u202fdays. On the 22nd day, 24\u202fh after the last CORT administration, animals were subjected to the depression-related behavioral tests (10\u202fmin apart). Subsequently, mice were immediately euthanized by decapitation, and the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were collected for western blotting analysis. The drugs (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, USA) were freshly prepared before administration, and all doses and time points of administration were chosen based on previous studies (\nBettio et al., 2012\n;\nBrachman et al., 2016\n;\nCamargo et al., 2020a\n;\nPazini et al., 2016\n). A diagram of the treatment regimen, behavioral and neurochemical analyses is provided in\nFig. 1\n.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nExperimental design and schedule of the treatment regimen, behavioral and neurochemical analyses. a Mice were treated with a single administration of ketamine (1 or 5\u202fmg/kg, i.p.) or guanosine (1 or 5\u202fmg/kg, p.o.) 1\u202fweek prior to the administration with vehicle or corticosterone. b Mice were daily administered with fluoxetine (10\u202fmg/kg, p.o.) for 3\u202fweeks before starting the chronic administration with vehicle or corticosterone. c Mice were treated with a single administration of a subthreshold dose of ketamine (1\u202fmg/kg, i.p.) plus a high dose of guanosine (5\u202fmg/kg, p.o.) 1\u202fweek before the administration with vehicle or corticosterone. a, b, c Vehicle or corticosterone (20\u202fmg/kg) was administered orally (p.o.), once a day, for 21 consecutive days. On the 22nd day, 24\u202fh after the last corticosterone administration, animals were subjected to the depression-related behavioral tests, namely tail suspension test, open-field test, and splash test (10\u202fmin apart). Subsequently, mice were immediately euthanized by decapitation and the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were collected for western blotting analysis. Figure designed using images from Mind the Graph.\n\n2.3. Tail suspension test (TST)\nThe total immobility time of mice suspended by the tail was measured as previously proposed (\nSteru et al., 1985\n). Visually isolated mice were suspended 50\u202fcm above the floor by adhesive tape placed approximately 1\u202fcm from the tip of the tail. Immobility time was recorded for 6\u202fmin by an experienced observer blind to the experimental groups. Mice were considered immobile only when they hung passively and completely motionless.\n\n2.4. Open-field test (OFT)\nMice were individually subjected to the OFT as previously described (\nRodrigues et al., 1996\n). The apparatus consisted of a wooden box measuring 40\u202f\u00d7\u202f60\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202fcm high. The floor of the arena was divided into 12 equal squares. The number of squares crossed for 6\u202fmin was considered a parameter of locomotor activity.\n\n2.5. Splash test (SPT)\nThe SPT consists of squirting a 10% sucrose solution (\nw\n/\nv\n) on the dorsal coat of mice placed in clear boxes (12\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f\u00d7\u202f30\u202fcm). Due to its viscosity, the sucrose solution dirties the mice which then initiate a grooming behavior. After applying the sucrose solution, the latency time to the first grooming and the total time spent grooming were recorded for 5\u202fmin, as an index of self-care and motivational behavior (\nRosa et al., 2014\n;\nWillner, 2005\n).\n\n2.6. Western blotting\nWestern blotting was conducted as previously described (\nLeal et al., 2020\n). The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were mechanically homogenized in 400\u202f\u03bcl of 50\u202fmM TRIS pH\u202f7.0, 1\u202fmM EDTA, 100\u202fmM NaF, 0.1\u202fmM PMSF, 2\u202fmM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 1%Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor cocktail. Lysates were centrifuged (10,000\ng\nfor 10\u202fmin, at 4\u202f\u00b0C) and the supernatants were diluted 1/1 (\nv\n/v) in 100\u202fmM TRIS pH\u202f6.8, 4\u202fmM EDTA, 8% SDS, and boiled for 5\u202fmin. Thereafter, sample dilution (40% glycerol, 100\u202fmM TRIS, bromophenol blue, pH\u202f6.8) in the ratio 25:100 (v/v) and \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (final concentration 8%) were added to the samples. Protein content was quantified using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard (\nPeterson, 1977\n). The samples containing 60\u202f\u03bcg protein/track were separated by SDS-PAGE using 7\u201310% gel and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (1.2\u202fmA/cm2; 1.5\u202fh). To verify the transfer efficiency process, membranes were stained with Ponceau and subsequently, the membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in TBS (10\u202fmM Tris, 150\u202fmM NaCl, pH\u202f7.5). The immunocontent of total and phosphorylated forms of protein kinase B (Akt \u2013 Ser\n473\n, #9271), glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2 \u2013 Ser\n9\n, #9336), mTORC1 (Ser\n2448\n, #2971) and 70\u202fkDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K \u2013 Thr\n389,\n#9205), as well as the total immunocontent of Akt (#9272), GSK-3\u03b2 (#9315), mTORC1 (#2972), p70S6K (#9202), PSD-95 (#2507), GluA1 (#13185), synapsin (#2312), and \u03b2-actin (loading control, #4970) were detected using specific antibodies (Cell Signaling, 1:1000) diluted in TBS-T (10\u202fmM Tris, 150\u202fmM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-10, pH\u202f7.5) containing 2.5% BSA and incubated overnight. Next, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling, 1:2500) for 60\u202fmin, and the immunoreactive bands were developed using a chemiluminescence kit (Amersham ECL Select, Piscataway, USA). The optical density (OD) of the bands was quantified using Image Lab Software\u00ae 4.1 (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The phosphorylation levels of Akt, GSK-3\u03b2, mTOR, and p70S6K were determined as a ratio of OD of the phosphorylated band over OD of the total band. The immunocontent of PSD-95, GluA1, and synapsin was determined as a ratio of the specific protein band over the OD of the \u03b2-actin band. Results are expressed as compared to the control group 100%.\n\n2.7. Statistical analysis\nThe D'Agostino-Pearson test was used to assess data normality. The differences among experimental groups were determined by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Newman-Keuls\npost hoc\ntest, when appropriate. Data are presented as mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard error of mean (SEM). A value of\np\n<\u202f.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of CCHMC and complied with the Guideline for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Kv4.2\nKO\nmice were obtained as a kind gift from Dr. Jeanne Nerbonne (Washington University, St Louis). Male heterozygous Kv4.2 (Kv4.2\nHET\n) mice in C57BL/6J background and female C57BL/6J wildtype (WT) mice (Jackson stock number 000664, RRID: IMSR_JAX:000664) were bred at CCHMC to generate heterozygous Kv4.2 and WT littermates. Pups were weaned at P21\u201328 and were housed with same sex littermates (maximum 4 per cage) in a standard cage with food and water provided\nad libitum.\nMice were maintained on a 14:10 hour light:dark cycle, and all experiments were performed during the light cycle. Male Kv4.2\nHET\nmice and WT littermates were used for all experiments, except for the analysis of nesting and marble burying behavior and the analysis of dendritic spine morphology where both male and female mice were used. For dendritic spine morphology analyses, female\nthy1\n-EGFP mice (B6.Cg-Tg(Thy1-EGFP)OJrs/GfngJ Jackson, catalogue no. 007919, RRID:IMSR_JAX:007919) and male Kv4.2\nHET\nmice were used for breeding, and male and female\nthy1\n-EGFP-positive offspring was used at P60 for analysis. Male 6\u20138 week-old C57BL/6J WT mice were used for bilateral intrahippocampal CA1 injection of lentiviral particles.\n\nAntibodies, drugs, lentiviral particles and primers\nThe following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-Kv4.2 (UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility Cat# 75\u2013016, RRID:AB_2131945), mouse monoclonal Kv4.3 (UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility Cat# 75\u2013017, RRID:AB_2131966), mouse monoclonal anti-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology Cat# 2920, RRID:AB_1147620), mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b2Actin (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# A1978, RRID:AB_476692), rabbit polyclonal anti-DPP6 (Abcam Cat# ab41809, RRID:AB_732017), rabbit polyclonal anti-DPP10 (Abcam Cat#ab42082, RRID:AB_2093405), mouse monoclonal anti-KChIP2 (UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility Cat# 75\u2013004, RRID:AB_10671304), and mouse monoclonal anti-KChIP3 (UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility Cat# 75\u2013005, RRID:AB_2130257). Secondary antibodies used for detection of western blot with chemiluminescence were obtained from GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Marlborough, MA, and for fluorescent detection from LI-COR, Lincoln, NB. Lentiviral particles expressing\nKcnd2\nand control lentiviral particles (virus containing the empty vector) were obtained from GeneCopoeia (Cat# LPP-Mm03412-Lv105\u2013100, and LPP-NEG-LV105\u2013100-C). Kainic acid (cat# 0222) was obtained from Tocris Biosciences, MN, USA, and was dissolved in sterile Ringers (Hospira, IL, USA). Diazepam (cat# 1185008) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The following qRT-PCR primers were used: Kv4.2for: GCTTTGAGACACAGCACCAC; Kv4.2rev: TGTTCATCGACAAACTCATGG; \u03b2-tubfor: TCGTGGAATGGATCCCCAAC; \u03b2-tubrev: TCCATCTCGTCCATGCCCT.\n\nRNA isolation and qRT-PCR\nRNA was extracted from tissue punches using Trizol\u00ae (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and cDNA was generated using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), followed by SYBR green quantitative real-time PCR (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using a QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Relative changes were quantified with the comparative cycle threshold method (2\n\u2212\u0394CT\n). Quality and quantity of mRNA was measured using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Reverse transcription for qPCRs was carried out using 1\u03bcg RNA.\n\nWestern blots\nWestern blots were done as described previously (\nMuddashetty et al., 2007\n) using lysates from the whole hippocampus of Kv4.2\nHET\nmice and their WT littermates. Kv4.2, Kv4.3, KChIP2, KChIP3, Akt and \u03b2-Actin were detected with HRP-coupled secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence. DDP6 and DPP10 were detected with fluorescent secondary antibodies. Specific bands were quantified using NIH ImageJ software and normalized to a loading control on the same gel. The loading control for Kv4.2, Kv4.3, DDP10 and KChIP2 was Akt, and for DPP6 and KChIP3 \u03b2-Actin or Akt. For DPP and KChIP detection, blots were cut in half after transfer. The top part was used for DPP detection, the bottom part for KChIP and \u03b2-Actin or Akt detection. All samples were run and quantified in duplicates.\n\nHippocampal tissue punches\nTo obtain CA1 hippocampal tissue punches from lentivirus-infected brains, whole brains were dissected, flash frozen and cut into slices of 1mm thickness with a coronal steel brain matrix (Stoelting Inc, Wood Dale, IL). Using a mouse brain stereotaxic atlas, the hippocampal CA1 region was identified (\nGeorge Paxinos, 2012\n), dissected with a micro puncher (1 mm diameter, Harris-UniCore\u2122, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hartfield, PA), and flash frozen on dry ice. Slices between bregma levels \u22121.5 to \u22122.5 mm were selected for the tissue dissection.\n\nDendritic spine density analysis\nMale and female offspring from female\nthy1-\nEGFP positive and male Kv4.2\nHET\nbreeders were used at P60. Mice were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and brains were dissected and postfixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. 500 \u03bcm-thick coronal sections were prepared using a vibratome (VT1000S, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), and sections were cleared using passive clearing technique (PACT) as described previously (\nYang et al., 2014\n). Briefly, slices were incubated in 4% acrylamide hydrogel overnight, cleared with 8% SDS for 24 hours, washed and stored in 0.02% sodium azide at 4\u00b0C until mounting. Sections were mounted using Fluoromount-G\u00ae (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) and imaged on a Nikon A1R HD inverted microscope equipped with LUN-V laser launch using a 100x objective (Nikon Instruments, Inc, Melville, NY). Acquired z-stacks were deconvolved by blind 3D deconvolution (NIS-Elements, Nikon Instruments). Dendritic spines were analyzed on apical secondary dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 area. Dendrites were analyzed for up to a total length of 100 \u03bcm or wherever the secondary dendrite ended. Overall spine density was quantified manually using Image J (NIH), and dendritic spine classification was performed semi-automatedly using Neurolucida\u00ae360 software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT) with a preset algorithm (\nRodriguez et al., 2008\n;\nDickstein et al., 2016\n). Five to six brains per genotype were analyzed with two to six neurons per brain (details in figure legends). Dendritic spine counts of all analyzed neurons from WT and Kv4.2\nHET\nmice were pooled for statistical analysis. Dendritic spine analysis was performed by two independent experimenters with very comparable results.\n\nBehavioral experiments\nAnxiety- and autism-associated behavioral analyses were conducted in the following order on separate days: nesting, marble burying, elevated zero maze. A separate cohort was utilized to test for audiogenic seizures. A third cohort was used to test prepulse inhibition and fear conditioning. These experiments were performed using male Kv4.2\nHET\nmice with WT littermate controls. In addition, a cohort of female Kv4.2\nHET\nand WT littermates was used to assess nesting and marble burying. Experimenters and analyzers were blind to the genotype of the tested mice.\nNesting\nNesting behavior was assessed at 2 h and 24 h post nestlet placement as per described protocols (\nDeacon, 2006\n;\nGross et al., 2015a\n). Before starting the test, mice were individually housed for a period of 3 days to acclimatize and avoid behavioral changes due to a novel environment. Nests were scored on a rating scale of 1 to 5 as described in\nDeacon, 2006\n. Briefly, a score of 1 indicates more than 90% intact nestlet, 2 indicates 50\u201390% nestlet remains intact, 3 indicates mostly shredded nestlets (>90%) with no identifiable nest, 4 indicates an identifiable nest with more than 90% nestlet torn and 5 represents a near perfect nest with walls taller than the mouse with more than 90% nestlet torn. In addition, the leftover nestlet was weighed and the percentage torn was calculated and compared. While scoring is less objective than weighing used nestlet it captures the capability of a mouse to build a nest regardless of how much nestlet material was used.\nMarble burying\nMarble burying was assessed as described previously (\nGross et al., 2015a\n). Briefly, rat cages (16in \u00d7 14in \u00d7 8in) were used for the test, and 20 dark blue glass marbles were arranged in a 4 \u00d7 5 grid pattern on 4 inches of standard cage bedding. Marbles covered 50% or more were recorded as buried. Latency to start burying and the number of marbles buried at 5, 10 and 15 min were recorded.\nElevated zero maze (EZM)\nEZM was performed as per the protocol described in\nSchaefer et al 2009\n. The apparatus consisted of a circular runway with closed and open quadrants located on opposing ends. The runway was 5 cm wide with a 50 cm internal diameter and was elevated 40 cm above the floor with 0.5 cm curbs to prevent accidental slipping off the edge (San Diego Instruments, CA). The room light was set to 5 LUX at the maze level. Mice were placed in the enclosed quadrant and were allowed to explore for 5 min. Sessions were video recorded using a camera mounted above the apparatus which was connected to an outside computer allowing the experimenter to exit the room as soon as the mouse was placed in the apparatus. Latency to enter the open quadrant, time spent in open and closed quadrants, as well as number of quadrant entries were analyzed using Odor (Macropod Software, Yarraville, Australia).\nAudiogenic seizures\nAudiogenic seizures were performed as described previously (\nGross et al., 2015b\n). P26-P28 day old mice were tested with two mice per cage between 7 and 8 pm. Before the actual testing, mice were habituated in the testing chamber and the environment for 30 minutes. A personal alarm (120dB attached with an A/C power adaptor and installed inside the testing cage) was used for the sound induction. The alarm sound was played twice for two minutes with a one-minute silence interval. Sound-induced behaviors such as wild running or a full tonic-clonic convulsion were recorded.\nPrepulse inhibition\nTo assess sensorimotor gating, prepulse inhibition testing of the acoustic startle response was performed as described in (\nSchaefer et al., 2009\n). Briefly, mice were singly placed in a sound-attenuated chamber (SR Laboratory, San Diego Instruments, CA) inside a cylindrical acrylic holder with sliding door at each end mounted on a platform. A piezoelectric force transducer was mounted beneath the platform to record movement of mice. Background white noise was set at 55 dB. Mice were placed in the cylindrical test chamber for a 5 min acclimatization period followed by four types of 4\u00d74 Latin square sequences of trials (zero stimulus, startle stimulus alone, 59 dB prepulse + startle stimulus, 70 dB prepulse + startle stimulus, or 80 dB prepulse + startle stimulus), repeated three times for a total of 48 trials. The intertrial interval and interstimulus interval from prepulse onset to startle signal onset was 8 sec and 70 ms, respectively. The startle signal was 120 dB which lasted 0.2 s.\nContextual conditioned freezing\nThe mice were tested as per the protocol by (\nKuerbitz et al., 2018\n) with modifications. The apparatus consisted of an acrylic chamber (25 \u00d7 25 cm, Freeze Monitor System; San Diego Instruments, CA) equipped with a 16 \u00d7 16 photo beam array, ceiling light and speaker, and had metal grid floors connected to a foot shock source. On day 1, mice were placed in the chamber for 12 min consisting of 6 min of acclimation without stimulus followed by 6 min with nine tone-shock pairings (82 dB for 30 s paired with a 2 s long 1 mA foot shock during the last second of the 30 s tone interval). Day 2 consisted of 6 min exploration period in the same chamber without shock or stimulus to assess contextual memory. On day 3, mice were placed in a different environment (black, triangular box with black lid with light, 50% smaller than the conditioning chamber). A 3 min no-tone interval was followed by ten 30 s periods of alternating tone and silence to test cued memory and extinction. Day 4 was similar to day 3 except only 5 alternating periods of tone silence were used to measure cued recall. The number of photo beam breaks while in the chamber was used as a measurement of activity versus freezing.\n\nElectrode implantation and electroencephalography\n6\u20138 week-old male Kv4.2\nHET\nmice and littermate WT controls were implanted with wireless transmitters for EEG monitoring (Castro et al 2012). The mice were first anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in medical grade oxygen in a closed chamber, and then maintained at 0.7\u20131.5% isoflurane throughout the surgery and monitored for adequate respiration patterns. Single channel wireless EEG transmitters (TA11ETA-F10, Data Science International (DSI), St. Paul, MN) were used. The head was first shaved and disinfected using Dermachlor (2% Chlorhexidine), and carprofen (100 \u03bcl) was administered subcutaneously. The skull was exposed by making an incision along the midline. Dorsoventral coordinates were measured from bregma and two holes were drilled at AP = \u22122.5 mm, L = \u00b1 2.0 mm (\nTse et al., 2014\n). Approximately 1 mm length of each of the two leads of the transmitter was inserted into the burr holes on top of the dura and sealed using GLUture (Zoetis Inc., Kalamazoo, MI). The wireless transmitter was placed subcutaneously by creating a pocket behind the neck. A screw was attached to the back of the skull and dental cement (Lang Dental, IL) applied to secure the assembly. After the cement had dried, the incision was closed using surgical sutures (Coviden, Dublin, Ireland) and sealed with GLUture (Abbott Laboratories). Post-surgery, the mice were injected with 1 ml saline, placed on a heating pad, and monitored during recovery.\n\nVideo-EEG recording and spectral power analysis\nPost-recovery, the mice were housed in individual cages placed on wireless receiver plates (RPC1; DSI). DATAQUEST A.R.T software was used for recording EEG data received from the telemetry system sampled at 500 Hz, which provided readouts for frequencies between 1 and 200 Hz (maximal sampling rate of the wireless transmitter TA11ETA-F10). Video was continuously recorded (Axis 221, Axis communication) in parallel and synchronized with the EEG signal. Video-EEG data were recorded for up to 4 weeks. The EEG recording data were analyzed using NeuroScore software (DSI). For EEG power analyses, the raw EEG signal was exported in 10 s epochs and subjected to Fast Fourier Transformation to generate power bands. A 5 min period of recording (free of any grooming behavior to avoid grooming-associated artifacts) was selected from individual mice from 2-h intervals during the day and night period (12pm to 2pm and 12am to 2am, respectively, with very few exceptions for which the hours of analysis were extended to 11am-3pm or 11pm-3am because of excessive signal artifacts, movement or grooming during the 12\u20132pm/am periods). These time periods were selected as there was minimum traffic of other experimenting personnel in the room. The EEG signal was split into power bands of the following frequencies: delta (\u03b4, 0.5\u20134 Hz), theta (\u03b8, 4\u20138 Hz), alpha (\u03b1, 8\u201312 Hz), sigma (\u03a3, 12\u201316 Hz), beta (\u03b2, 16\u201324 Hz) and gamma (\u03b3, 24\u201380 Hz) (\nTse et al., 2014\n). These individual power bands were compared between the Kv4.2\nHET\nand WT mice. The data were pooled from 10 s epochs for a total of 5 min duration. Mice with EKG signal or highly noisy EEG were removed from analysis (10 mice per genotype were implanted and 4 from each group were excluded).\n\nSpike analysis\nEEG spikes were detected using a spike detector module in NeuroScore\u2122 version 3.2.1 (EEG analysis software). A spike was defined as having a duration of 1 \u2013 70 ms and an absolute amplitude value of 150 \u03bcV \u2013 1500 \u03bcV (\nPuttachary et al., 2015\n). Spike trains were defined as having a minimum duration of 5 ms with a minimum of 4 spikes spaced within 80\u20135000 ms apart from one another (\nPuttachary et al., 2015\n;\nLosing et al., 2017\n). EEG artifacts due to movement or grooming (identified by the video recordings) were manually removed. As described for the power analyses, mice with EKG signal or highly noisy EEG were removed from analysis (10 mice per genotype were implanted and 4 from each group were excluded). Data were analyzed in the same 2-h periods as described for EEG power analysis above.\n\nKainic acid seizure model\n6\u20138 week-old mice were implanted with transmitters for cortical surface EEG telemetry recording as above. Post-surgery, the mice were allowed to recover for 24h and baseline EEG was recorded for 15\u201320 min, followed by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with kainic acid (2 mg/ml solution in sterile Ringers, 15 mg/kg body weight). Mice were returned immediately to the recording platform to measure seizure onset and EEG power. EEG was recorded for 90 min, following which the seizures were terminated with a subcutaneous injection of diazepam (15 mg/kg).\n\nIn vitro assessment of lentivirus-mediated overexpression of Kv4.2 in HEK293 cells\nHEK-293 cells (CRL-1573\u2122, ATCC, Manassas, VA) were transfected at 80% confluency with increasing amounts of lentiviral (50,000\u2013500,000 transfective units/ml). Cells were harvested after five days and analyzed by western blotting.\n\nIntrahippocampal injection of lentivirus\nTwo different sets of experiments were performed using lentiviral overexpression of Kv4.2, aimed at measuring the effect of lentivirus injection on seizure susceptibility and the effect on Kv4.2 mRNA expression, respectively. The tissue from the seizure onset mice was not used for the biochemical quantification of Kv4.2, as kainic acid-induced seizure was shown to reduce the expression of Kv4.2 (\nGross et al., 2016\n), and hence the specific effect of lentivirus overexpression would not have been measured accurately in those mice. To quantify\nKcnd2\nmRNA levels, 6\u20138 week old C57/BL6 mice were subjected to bilateral intrahippocampal CA1 injections of\nKcnd2\nexpressing lentivirus or a negative control at bregma level AP = \u2212 2.0 mm; L = \u00b1 1.8 mm and V = 2.0 mm (2 \u03bcl/side= ~200,000 transfective units/side). Using a 5 \u03bcl Hamilton syringe, lentivirus was administered slowly over a 5 min duration and the needle was left in place for 10 min to allow the diffusion of the injected volume followed by a slow retraction of needle over a 5 min duration. Tissue was collected two weeks after virus injection. Before the experimental surgeries, the specificity of injection was confirmed using a dye injection. To assess seizure onset, mice were implanted with transmitters for EEG recording and at the same time received a bilateral intra-hippocampal injection of lentivirus overexpressing\nKcnd2\nor a vector control at two different doses (1 \u03bcl/side= ~100,000 transfective units/side and 2 \u03bcl/side= ~200,000 transfective units/side). The transmitters were implanted as described above under \u201celectrode implanting\u201d followed by lentivirus injection as described above. Post injection, the incision was closed using surgical sutures, and GLUture and antibiotic ointment was applied. The mice were later administered with 1 ml of sterile Ringer\u2019s saline and placed on heating pad and monitored until recovery. Kainic acid-induced seizure onset and severity were analyzed two weeks after virus injection.\n\nImage processing\nFigures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop CS6 software. To enhance visibility, brightness and contrast of western blot images were adjusted equally across conditions using the \u201clevel\u201d tool without changing midtone. Quantification was performed on the raw images using ImageJ (NIH).\n\nExperimental design and statistical analysis\nNon-behavioral data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism7 software. All data were analyzed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s test. For two-sample comparisons, appropriate parametric (unpaired two-sided t-test) or non-parametric tests (unpaired two-sided Mann Whitney test) were used as indicated in each figure legend. Dendritic spine morphology was analyzed by 2-way ANOVA (genotype \u00d7 spine type as variables) followed by planned post-hoc comparisons of genotype-dependent differences for each spine type using Sidak\u2019s posthoc tests. Marble burying was analyzed by repeated measurements 2-way ANOVA (genotype and time as independent variables) followed by planned post-hoc comparisons of genotype-dependent differences for each time point using Sidak\u2019s tests. Statistical tests, sample sizes and p values are specified in the figure legends. Statistical significance was set to \u03b1 < 0.05. No mice were excluded from biochemical studies. Some mice were excluded from EEG power and spike/spike train analysis due to unusable signal as described in the respective method sections. Data are represented as scattered plots with bars and error bars indicating mean \u00b1 SEM, except for EEG power, spikes and spike trains, which are presented as box-and-whisker plots which show minimum to maximum (whiskers), 25\nth\nto 75\nth\npercentile (boxes) and median (line). Behavioral data were analyzed using mixed linear model ANOVAs (Proc Mixed, SAS v9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The autoregressive moving average (ARMA) variance-covariance model was used in conjunction with Kenward-Roger first order degrees of freedom. Significant interactions were analyzed using slice-effect ANOVAs. For PPI of the startle response, separate analyses were done for each day since Proc Mixed is unable to handle two repeated measures involving time.\nWhere applicable, statistical power was calculated using free online sample size and power calculators (\npowerandsamplesize.com\n). Sample sizes were determined as follows: We expected to detect a reduction in Kv4.2 protein or mRNA by half in Kv4.2 heterozygous with the commonly observed 30% variability in western blot and qRT-PCR. The required sample size for statistical power of 0.8 was determined as n=10. We previously observed that a sample size of 23\u201327 was needed for detecting a difference in dendritic spine density of 0.96/1.133 with a standard deviation of 0.23 yielding a statistical power of 0.76 (\nGross et al., 2019\n). After reaching a sample size of ~27 in the analysis of Kv4.2 heterozygous and wildtype mice, we performed power analyses of the data and determined a sufficient statistical power of p=0.9995. Here, male and female mice were analyzed together (3 male mice per genotype, 3 female WT and 2 female Kv4.2\nHET\nmice). Sample sizes for behavioral experiments were based on previous data (\nSchaefer et al., 2009\n). As no trends or differences were determined with ~20 mice or 12 mice per group, no further power analyses were performed. Startle response and conditioned freezing were performed in 12 cohorts with one mouse per genotype per litter, reducing litter effects, whereas on some occasions, multiple mice per genotype per litter were used for nesting and marble burying assays. Sample sizes were based on previous data (\nGross et al., 2016\n). For quantification of western blots, seizure onset and EEG power, analyzers were blind to the condition. For behavioral assays and dendritic spine analyses, experimenters and analyzers were blind to the condition."
