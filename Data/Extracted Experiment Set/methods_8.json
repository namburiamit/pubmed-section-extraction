    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal experiments were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in accordance with the\nNational Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n. Young male C57BL/6J mice (10-week-old) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and aged male C57BL/6J mice (18-month-old) were obtained from the National Institute of Aging (NIA) aged mouse colony at Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA). Animals were housed in groups of four per cage in a temperature- and humidity-controlled animal facility with a 12-hour light\u2013dark cycle. Food and water were available\nad libitum\n. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and the number of animals killed.\n\nMurine model of permanent focal ischemia\nAll animals were randomly assigned to sham and distal MCAO groups through the use of a lottery-drawing box. Focal cerebral ischemia was produced by permanent distal MCA occlusion, as previously reported (\nLubjuhn et al., 2009\n), plus ipsilateral common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane in a 30% O2/68.5% N\n2\nO mixture under spontaneous breathing conditions. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37.0\u00b0C\u00b10.5\u00b0C during surgery with a temperature-regulated heating pad. First, a skin incision was made at the midline of the neck. After being separated from the vagal nerve, the left CCA was exposed and occluded by ligation. The skin was sutured and another skin incision was made between the left eye and the ear. The temporal muscle was dissected by bipolar electrocautery (Bipolar Coagulator, Codman & Shurtleff Inc., Randolph, MA, USA). The temporal muscle temperature was maintained at 37.0\u00b0C\u00b10.5\u00b0C by a heat lamp. After opening the burr hole and performing a craniotomy, the distal part of the MCA was exposed. The dura mater was then cut and the distal MCA occlusion was completed with low-intensity bipolar electrocautery at the immediate lateral part of the rhinal fissure. Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured in all stroke animals using laser Doppler flowmetry. Animals that did not show a regional CBF reduction to <30% of pre-ischemia baseline levels were excluded from further experimentation. Sham-operated animals underwent the same anesthesia and surgical procedures but were not subjected to CCAO and MCAO. All behavioral (sensorimotor and memory tests) and histological (immunostaining and cell counting) assessments were performed by investigators blinded to experimental group assignments. Forty-five young mice and 46 aged mice were used in this study, for a grand total of 91 mice (16 sham-operated and 75 ischemic mice). Only 3 mice died during the perioperative period.\n\nCortical cerebral blood flow measurements\nReal-time 2 dimensional cerebral blood flow was monitored using a laser speckle contrast imager (PeriCam PSI HR System, Perimed, Sweden) as previously described (\nLindahl et al., 2013\n). Select numbers of mice in both groups were subjected to repeated measurements of CBF at 0d (baseline, at left CCAO, and at left distal MCAO), 3d, 7d, 14d, and 21d after dMCAO. After induction of anesthesia, mouse was placed in the prone position, and the skull was exposed through a cut in the skin at the parietal midline. Images were acquired through the laser speckle contrast imager at a working distance of 10 cm from the skull surface. To evaluate CBF changes, the region of interest (ROI) included the left cortical infarct region, which is posterior to the coronal suture and medial to the linear temporalis.\n\nMeasurements of infarct volume\nFor 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, brains were removed and sliced into 7 coronal sections, each 1 mm thick. Sections were then immersed in prewarmed 2% TTC (Sigma) in saline for 10 min, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The neuron-specific marker microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) was visualized with anti-MAP2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Infarct volume was determined on these TTC or MAP2-stained sections using NIH Image J software. The actual infarct volume with edema correction was calculated as the volume of the contralateral hemisphere minus the non-infarcted volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and cell counting\nBrains were removed following perfusions with saline and 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS. Following cryoprotection, 25 \u03bcm-thick brain sections were cut on a freezing microtome and subjected to immunofluorescence. Primary antibodies include goat anti-CD206 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), rat anti-CD16/32 (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), rabbit anti-myelin basic protein (MBP; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), mouse anti-non-phosphorylated neurofilaments (SMI-32, Abcam), rabbit anti-MAP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), and rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako, Richmond, VA, USA). All images were processed with Image J for counting of automatically recognized cells. Average cell numbers were calculated from 3 randomly selected microscopic fields, and 3 consecutive sections were analyzed for each brain. Data are expressed as mean numbers of cells per square millimeter.\n\nFluorescence quantification\nAll fluorescence images were acquired using confocal microscopy (FV1000, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed semi-quantitatively with Image J. For the measurements of MBP staining intensity, the regions of interest (ROI) were set in the striatum. Average staining intensity was calculated from 3 randomly selected microscopic fields in the striatum, and 3 consecutive sections were analyzed for each brain. Data are expressed as the mean intensity of these 9 images from each mouse.\n\nAccelerating Rotarod test\nFor Rotarod testing, animals were placed on an accelerating rotating rod (4 to 40 rpm over 120s) and their latency to fall off the rod was recorded as previously reported (\nBouet et al., 2007\n). Preoperative training was performed for 3 days with 3 daily trials. The last three trials serve as a preoperative baseline. Postoperative testing was performed at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 35 days after dMCAO, for 3 trials per day, and the mean latency to fall was analyzed.\n\nHanging wire test\nThe wire hanging apparatus was comprised of a stainless steel bar (50 cm length; 2 mm diameter), resting on two vertical supports and elevated 37 cm above a flat surface. This test was performed as previously described (\nWang et al., 2013\n). Mice were placed on the bar midway between the supports and were observed for 30 seconds in 4 trials. The amount of time spent hanging was recorded and scored according to the following system: 0, fell off; 1, hung onto the bar with two forepaws; 2, hung onto the bar with added attempt to climb onto the bar; 3, hung onto the bar with two forepaws and one or both hind paws; 4, hung onto the bar with all four paws and with tail wrapped around the bar; 5, escaped to one of the supports.\n\nMorris water maze test\nThe Morris Water Maze test was carried out as previously described (\nBouet et al., 2007\n;\nWang et al., 2013\n). For this test, an 11-cm square Plexiglas platform was submerged in a circular pool (109 cm diameter) and white, nontoxic tempera paint was added to the water. The platform was submerged 1 cm under the opaque water surface. The water temperature was maintained at 20\u00b11\u00b0C and the room temperature was kept at 21\u00b11\u00b0C. This test was composed of two parts: the acquisition phase for spatial learning and the memory test. For the acquisition or spatial learning phase, each mouse was released from one of four locations and was allotted 60 seconds to search for the hidden platform 16-20 days after distal MCAO. At the end of each trial, the mouse was placed on the platform or allowed to remain on the platform for 20 seconds with prominent spatial cues displayed around the room. Data from three trials per day for 5 consecutive days were expressed as the time (in seconds) or latency to reach the submerged platform. After the last day of the hidden platform test, a single, 60-second probe trial was performed for the memory test. The platform was removed and each mouse was placed in the pool once for 60 seconds, at the same starting location as was used initially in hidden platform testing. The time spent in the goal quadrant (where the platform had been previously located) and the swim speed were recorded.\n\nStatistical analyses\nAll data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Data with two groups were analyzed with the Student's\nt\n-test (non-directional). For multiple comparisons, the one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was followed by a Tukey\npost hoc\ntest, unless otherwise indicated. The Pearson correlation was also determined.\np\n<0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Cholera toxin was used to induce corticosterone synthesis in a rodent Y1 adrenal cortical cell line by increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Both corticosterone and cAMP were quantitatively measured using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The downstream signaling components of the G-CSF receptor, including Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2)/Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Protein kinase B (Akt) and Phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B), were detected by western blot. Sprague-Dawley rat pups at the age of 10 days (P10) were subjected to unilateral carotid artery ligation followed by hypoxia for 2.5 hours. Brain infarction volumes were determined using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazoliumchloride monohydrate (TTC) staining."

    "Methods": "Experimental subjects, surgeries, and histology\nAll procedures were approved by the University of Toronto Animal Care Committee and the Animal Care Committee of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. Experimental subjects were 15 male, Sprague\u2013Dawley rats between 2 1/2 to 4 months old (Charles River). Following habituation to our animal facility, the animals were randomly assigned to those receiving DBS (n = 8) or sham stimulation (n = 7; electrodes implanted with no stimulation being delivered).\nSurgeries were performed under isoflurane anesthesia. In each rat, monopolar stimulating electrodes (250 \u03bcm diameter with approximately 100 \u03bcm of insulation removed at tips) were placed bilaterally into the IL (3.0 mm anterior and 0.8 mm to the left and right of bregma lowered 4.4 mm ventral from the brain surface). One stainless steel (76 \u03bcm diameter bare, 140 \u03bcm coated) electrode was twisted around the right-side stimulating electrode to record local field potentials (LFPs), with tips of the two electrodes estimated to be 50 to 200 \u03bcm from one-another. Using different electrodes for stimulation and recording ensured that observed physiological changes could not be explained by stimulation effects on the tissue immediately adjacent to the electrode tip. A second LFP recording electrode was placed in the CA1 subfield of the ventral hippocampus (6 mm posterior and 5.7 mm to the right of bregma, lowered 6.2 mm from the brain surface). Approximate target locations are illustrated in\nFig. 1A\n. A third stainless steel electrode was implanted into the cerebellum to be used as reference. A ground screw placed above the parietal cortex was wired to the ground of the recording equipment and used as an alternative reference channel. Rats were given at least two days of recovery from implantation surgery before recordings and treatment began.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nExperimental design.

B) Nissl-stained coronal sections showing example electrode tracks and estimated tip location in one rat brain for both the IL (left) and hippocampal (right) electrodes. Arrows point to estimated electrode tip locations. C) Timeline of epochs within a session, for all non-injection sessions. D) Timeline of treatment and recording sessions. Recordings were performed on the day before treatment, following 1 and 10 days of treatment, and 1, 10, and 11 days after treatment ended; on Post-Day 1 and 11 rats were treated with either fluoxetine or saline (dashed lines).\nFollowing the experiment, the rats were administered an overdose of sodium pentobarbital and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Electrode location was confirmed in Nissl-stained sections (\nFig. 1B\n).\n\nSchedule of recording sessions and treatments\nFig. 1C\nshows the timeline of the experiments. Each recording session took place in a 50 \u00d7 50 cm square box where rats were allowed to move freely and involved three recording epochs. The first fifteen minutes of the session together constituted the \u201cspontaneous behavior\u201d epoch. This was followed by the \u201cauditory stimulation\u201d epoch, during which a brief auditory tone (100 ms, 2.5 kHz, 95 DB) was presented from speakers placed 50 cm above the rat. The tone was repeated 80 times over 33 min, each pulse presented between 20\u201330 s following the previous. The purpose of the auditory stimulation was to evoke attentional responses that provided a temporal reference for the analysis of neural activity. Following auditory stimulation, recording sessions continued for another 45 min, the \u201crest\u201d epoch, to allow further investigation of physiological patterns across animals' activity states.\nData were collected in 5 or 6 recording sessions for each rat. The first recording session took place one day prior to the first day of DBS or sham treatment (Day 0). Other recording sessions took place in the evening or night (near the transition of rats' dark-to-light cycles) after 1 day of treatment, after 10 days of treatment, and 10 days following the termination of treatment (Day Post-10). An additional recording session took place (Day Post-1 or Post-11) while rats were injected with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine (10 mg/kg). As a control for the effects of injections, a subset of animals (4 DBS, 3 sham) was also recorded from after a single saline injection (Day Post-1). During injection days, protocols included pre- (15 min) and post-injection (30 min) baseline recording periods. These epochs were followed by a 33 min auditory stimulation epoch and a shortened (approximately 20 min) rest epoch.\nDBS treatments consisted of 8 continuous hours of unipolar stimulation (90 \u03bcs pulses of 100 \u03bcA at 130 Hz) delivered bilaterally to the IL. Treatments were administered in each rat's homecage by a handheld medical stimulator (St. Jude Medical model 6510; Plano, Texas), interfaced by a headcap and cable (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA) and commutator to ensure freedom of movement. Rats receiving sham stimulation were connected on the same days that DBS rats were connected but stimulators were not turned on.\n\nData collection\nBehavioral and neural data were acquired during each recording session. Movements were monitored by an overhead camera (14 Hz frame rate) tracking red LEDs attached to the headcap. Movement data was synchronized with neural data using a custom-built program in Python (\nhttps://www.python.org/\n) implementing the OpenCV library (\nhttp://opencv.org/\n). Position information was computed from video using a custom-written program in MATLAB (MathWorks; Natick, MA). Neural data was collected using a Tucker Davis Technologies (Alachua, FL) RZ5D system and consisted of LFPs sampled at 2034 Hz and filtered between 0.1 and 400 Hz, collected from the right infralimbic cortex and the right ventral hippocampus. All were referenced against the cerebellar electrode. The cerebellar reference electrode was recorded against the ground screw to allow for re-referencing.\n\nData analysis\nCoherence during spontaneous behavior\nAll analyses were implemented in MATLAB. Coherence measures relied on a multitaper technique provided within the Chronux toolbox (\nhttp://www.chronux.org/\n). LFP signals during the first 15 min of recording (the spontaneous behavior epoch) were segmented into non-overlapping, 10 s windows. Three to five tapers were applied to each window and a Fast-Fourier Transform was used to compute spectra of LFPs recorded in each individual regions and the cross spectra between regions. Coherence was defined as the square of the cross-spectra divided by the product of the individual spectra (i.e., magnitude squared coherence). These scores were then averaged across windows. The frequency resolution for the chosen sampling rate and window length was 0.06 Hz.\nSignal amplitude during spontaneous behavior\nLFP signal amplitude can vary according to non-physiological factors such as electrode impedance and precise position. To standardize measurements of LFP spectra across animals we used the relative amplitude of one frequency component compared with another. As described in the Results, theta (6 to 10 Hz) coherence was not found to significantly change with DBS treatments; we therefore used the ratio of 2\u20134 Hz to theta amplitude as our dependent variable.\nMovement and coherence\nInstantaneous velocity was computed for each 14 Hz (about 71 ms) sampled video interval from the position information. To reduce the impact of jitter, video data were first smoothed by convolving with a 10-sample (roughly 700 ms) hamming window (analyses were additionally run on non-smoothed data for confirmation). Total movement in a session was then calculated as the cumulative sum of instantaneous velocity divided by the video sampling rate. Orienting responses to the auditory stimulus were quantified by averaging the stimulus-aligned instantaneous velocity traces. The relationship between LFP coherence and movement was evaluated by binning instantaneous velocity vectors into 714 ms intervals (i.e., converting 14 Hz signals to 1.4 Hz). From these, 80 bins were selected at random that fell within 1 cm/s intervals, up to 20 cm/s. The 80 bins for a given velocity window were treated as \u201ctrials,\u201d over which signal amplitude and coherence were computed at both 2\u20134 Hz and 6\u201310 Hz frequency bands.\nStimulus-related coherence and amplitude\nInstantaneous measures of amplitude and coherence were computed so that stimulus-related changes could be evaluated. Amplitude of 2\u20134 Hz and 6\u201310 Hz LFP patterns was computed by first filtering the signals at the respective frequency bands with a 3rd order, Chebyshev Type I filter and then taking the absolute value of the Hilbert transformation. For improved temporal resolution, phase correlations were measured not with magnitude squared coherence but by using a phase synchronization method. To compute phase differences between the two regions, signals were 1) filtered as just described, 2) transformed using the Hilbert transform, 3) converted to phase values by taking the arctangent of real and imaginary components, 4) subtracted one from the other using circular subtraction, and 5) the result was averaged over window lengths of 500 ms (2\u20134 Hz) or 200 ms (6\u201310 Hz), stepped at 250 and 100 ms respectively.\nSignificance testing\nSignificance was assessed by comparing scores between animal groups, as described on a case-by-case basis in the Results. In most cases, scores across animals were assumed to vary according to a Gaussian distribution, and we therefore often applied\nt\n-tests and ANOVAs."

    "Methods": "Synthesis of P53 inhibitors\nPifithrin-\u03b1 (PFT-\u03b1: 1-(4-methylphenyl)-2-(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2-imino-3 (2H)-benzothiazolyl)ethanone) was synthesized as its HBr salt, according to the route of Zhu et al. (\nFig. 1A\n). In contrast to sulfur containing PFT-\u03b1, the oxygen containing close analogue (PFT-\u03b1 (O): 1-(4-methylphenyl)-2-(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2-imino-3(2H)-benzooxazolyl)ethanone) was prepared from 2-hydroxycyclohexanone dimer and cyanamide. Specifically, 2-hydroxycyclohexanone dimer was reacted with cyanamide in a 95 \u00b0C oil bath to provide 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzoxazole, which was separated and characterized. This 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzoxazole was then stirred with \u03b1-bromomethyl ketone at room temperature for 2 days, and the precipitate was collected by filtration and recrystallized from MeOH/EtOAC to provide PFT-\u03b1 (O), which was then prepared as a HBr salt. Chemical characterization confirmed the structures of the desired compounds in high purity (>99%), which were dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for cell culture studies. In brief, neuronal cultures were challenged with excess glutamate (Sigma, St Louis, MO) to evaluate PFT-\u03b1 and PFT-\u03b1 (O) mediated neuroprotective actions (see below).\nFig. 1. Post-injury administration of PFT-\u03b1 or PFT-\u03b1 (O) at 5 h after TBI significantly reduced contusion volume at 24 h.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Chemical structures of PFT-\u03b1 and PFT-\u03b1 (O).

(C) Contusion volumes induced by TBI at 8 h and 24 h (associated with the primary mechanical injury and secondary apoptotic phases, respectively). All TBI challenged groups were significantly different from the sham group at 8 and 24 h. Whereas the contusion volume of TBI groups were not different from one another at 8 h, by 24 h it was significantly reduced by PFT-\u03b1 or PFT-\u03b1 (O) (2mg/kg) treatment compared to the TBI vehicle group. Data are expressed as means \u00b1SEM. * p <0.05, ** p <0.01, ***p<0.001 versus sham group; # p <0.05; ## p <0.01, versus TBI + veh group (n= 5 for each group).\n\nAnimal model of traumatic brain injury (TBI)\nAll animals were treated in accordance with the International Guidelines for animal research, and the study design was approved by the animal ethics committee of Taipei Medical University. Animals were housed in groups in a temperaturee- (21\u201325\u00b0C) and humidity (45\u201350%)-controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle and ad libitum access to pellet chow and water. All animals were randomized into 4 groups (sham injury, CCI+vehicle, CCI+PFT-\u03b1 and CCI+ PFT-\u03b1 (O)). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250\u2013300 g, body weight) were anaesthetized and placed in a stereotaxic frame. A 5-mm craniotomy was performed over the left parietal cortex, centered on the coronal suture and 3.5 mm lateral to the sagittal suture. Injury was made using a controlled cortical impact (CCI) instrument with a rounded metal tip (5 mm diameter). A velocity of 4 m/s and a deformation depth 2 mm below the dura were used as we previously described (\nChen et al., 2008\n). Sham animals received anesthesia and crainiotomy but no CCI. Body temperature was monitored throughout the surgery by a rectal probe; temperature was maintained at 37.0\u00b10.5\u00b0C using a heated pad. Rats were placed in a heated cage to maintain body temperature, while recovering from anaesthesia.\n\nDrug Administration\nCCI rats received vehicle (10% DMSO in saline), PFT-\u03b1 or PFT-\u03b1 (O) injections (2 mg/kg, i.v.) at 5-hr (n = 5) or 7-hr (n = 5) post-injury. Notably, body temperature was evaluated in a group of parallel TBI animals following vehicle, PFT-\u03b1 or PFT-\u03b1 (O) treatment over a period of 3 h, and no changes in body temperature were evident. Furthermore, no temperature changes were seen after PFT \u03b1 or PFT \u03b1 (O) in normal or sham animals as well. All behavioral testing and histological analysis were carried out by experimenters blinded to treatment conditions.\n\nPrimary rat cortical neuronal/glial cocultures\nPrimary neuronal/glial cocultures were isolated from cerebral cortex of 1-day-old neonatal Sprague\u2013Dawley rats as previously described (\nHuang et al., 2009\n). These procedures were performed according to the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. Rat pup brains were removed immediately after sacrificed and the cerebral cortex were placed in ice-cold Hank\u2019s solution (without Ca\n2+\nor Mg\n2+\n). Cortical cells were dissociated and suspended in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Thereafter, cells were plated at a density of 5\u00d710\n5\ncells/ml, and then incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified incubator (5% CO\n2\n, 95% air). All experiments were performed in 13\u201314-day after the plating. We used immunostaining to determine the percentage of the cell composition that was additionally followed by cell counting. Under our culture conditions, the neuronal/glial cocultures consisted of approximately 40% to 42% neurons, 40% to 45% astrocytes, and 8% to10% microglia, as previously described (\nHuang et al., 2009\n).\nNeuronal/glial cocultures were treated with glutamate (Sigma-Aldrich) to mimic TBI-induced excitotoxicity in vitro. Different concentrations of glutamate were assessed to induce excitotoxicity. The concentration of 50 mM glutamate, which was sufficient to cause a mild cellular loss was selected for the following experiment. To evaluate neuroprotection against excitotoxicity, different concentrations of PFT-\u03b1, PFT-\u03b1 (O) or vehicle (0.1% DMSO in PBS) was added at 30 min after glutamate challenge (50 mM) and cytotoxicity was appraised at 24 h by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, as previously described (\nHuang et al., 2009\n). LDH activity was determined by measuring optical absorbance at 340 nm wavelength, and scaled to the value of maximal death (100%) measured after freeze-thaw treatment of sister cultures. LDH release was expressed as the percentage of values relative to vehicle-treated control cultures.\n\nBehavioral evaluation of neurological outcome\nBehavioral testing was performed before CCI and at 24 h after CCI. The evaluation consisted of a modified neurological severity score (mNSS) assessment, a tactile adhesive removal test, an elevated body swing test and a beam walk test. All were performed by an observer blinded to the experimental groups.\nTo compare neurological deficit severity in TBI rats, a mNSS which is a composite of motor, sensory, reflex and balance tests was performed (\nChen et al., 2008\n). One point was scored for the inability to perform the test or for the lack of a tested reflex; thus, the higher the score, the more severe the injury. Neurological function was graded on a scale of 0\u201318 (normal score, 0; maximal deficit score, 18).\nA tactile removal test was used to evaluate somatosensory function. Two small adhesive-backed stickers (each 113.1 mm\n2\n) were used as bilateral tactile stimuli that were placed on the distal\u2013radial region on the wrist of each forelimb (\nChen et al., 2008\n). Rats were pre-trained daily for 3 days before CCI. The time required (not to exceed 180 s) for the rat to remove the sticker from the forelimb was recorded for five trials at 24 h after CCI.\nBody asymmetry was quantitatively analyzed with the use of the elevated body swing test (EBST). Briefly, rats were examined for lateral movement/turning when their bodies were suspended 10 cm above the testing table by lifting their tails. A left/right swing was counted when the head/torso of the animal moved more than 10\u00b0 from the vertical axis after elevation by their tail. As CCI was performed on the left side, a resulting weakness (hemiparesis) develops on the right side. The frequency of left/right swings was scored across 20 consecutive trials and expressed as a percentage [calculated by: (number of right-biased swings / the total number of swings) \u00d7 100%]. An uninjured animal showed an equal frequency to swing to either the left or right side.\nThe beam walk test was used to assess the fine motor coordination and balance (\nFeeney et al., 1982\n). Each rat was placed on a bright light platform and was allowed to walk along a narrow beam (2.5 \u00d7 122.0 cm) to reach a darkened goal box at the end of the beam (\nChen et al., 2008\n). The beam-walk latency for a rat to reach the goal box was recorded (not to exceed 60 s). Five trials were recorded 1 h before CCI (baseline) and at 24 h after CCI. The mean values of latency were then quantified.\n\nFluoro Jade C staining\nFluoro Jade C (FJC) is a polyanionic fluorescein derivative that selectively binds to degenerating g neuronal cell, and is more specific and sensitive than Fluoro Jade B (\nSchmued et al., 2005\n). We used Fluoro-Jade C ready-to-dilute staining kit for identifying degenerating neurons (Biosensis, TR-100-FJ), with some modification. Tissue sections were de-paraffinized, rehydrated, incubated in distilled water for 2 min. They were then incubated in a solution of potassium permanganate (1:15) for 10 min, rinsed in distilled water for 2 min and incubated in FJC solution (1:25) for 30 min. The slides were then washed and mounted on coverslips with Vecta-shield mounting medium (Vector). All sections were observed and photographed under a fluorescence microscope with a blue (450\u2013490 nm) excitation light.\n\nContusion volume\nTo measure contusion volume, cresyl violet-stained sections were digitized and analyzed using a 1\u00d7 objective and computer image analysis system. Contusion volume measurement was performed as previously described (\nChen et al., 2007\n). Contusion area was calculated from all images of cresyl violet-stained sections that contained contused brain; volume was computed by summation of areas multiplied by inter-slice distance (500 \u03bcm). Hemisphere tissue loss was expressed as a percentage calculated by [(contralateral hemispheric volume-ipsilateral hemispheric volume) / contralateral hemispheric volume) \u00d7 100%], as previously reported (\nZhang et al., 1998\n).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAll sections were dried, rehydrated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and rinsed in PBS. Sections were blocked for 60 min in 5% BSA (PBS containing 5% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100; Sigma) and incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies, either mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN antibody (Millpore; 1:500, NeuN is a neuronal marker)/ anti-p53 antibody (GeneTex ; 1:500) / anti-annexin V antibody (Abcam ; 1:500) / anti-p-p53 antibody (Cell signaling ; 1:1000) / or anti-PUMA antibody (Abcam ; 1:200) at 4\u00b0C overnight and with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA); Alexa Fluor\u00ae 594 anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA)) at room temperature for 2 h. Sections were mounted with Mounting Medium H-1000 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). The numbers of NeuN-, p53-, annexin V-, p-p53-, and PUMA\u2013positive cells were counted in 5 randomly selected fields by means of SPOT image analysis software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI)\n\nQuantitative measurement of messenger RNA encoding for p53-regulated pro-apoptotic genes\nTotal RNA of tissue (approximately 50 mg)/cells isolated from neuronal/glial co-cultures was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), as recommended by the manufacturer. The concentration and purity of RNA were determined by measuring absorbance at 260 and 280 nm wavelength. For reverse transcriptase (RT) and cDNA synthesis, 3 \u03bcg RNA was performed using a total reaction volume of 20 \u03bcl with ReverTra Ace set (no. PU-TRT-100; Purigo, Taipei, Taiwan). The RT products were chilled on ice as templates in quantitative (real-time) PCR or were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. For quantification of mRNA levels, we performed qPCR by using QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) with primers in a Rotor-Gene Q 2plex HRM Platform (Qiagen). The primers were designed using published cDNA sequences: PUMA, 5\u2032-CATGGGACTCCTCCCCTTAC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-CACCTAGTTGGGCTCCATTT-3\u2032 (reverse); Bax, 5\u2032-GTGAGCGGCTGCTTGTCT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GTGGGGGTCCCGAAGTAG-3\u2032 (reverse); Bcl-2, 5\u2032-GTACCTGAACCGGCATCTG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GGGGCCATATAGTTCCACAA-3\u2032 (reverse); Apaf1, 5\u2032-CATGAGCTGAAGGGC CATA-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GGCCATCTGAGACATTCCAT-3\u2032 (reverse); p21, 5\u2032-ACATCTCAGGGCCGAAAAC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GCGCTTGGAGTGATAGAAAT-3\u2032 (reverse);\n\u03b2\n-actin, 5\u2032-GACCCAGATCATGTTTGAGACCTTC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GGTGACCGTAACACTACCTGAG-3\u2032 (reverse). Reaction conditions were carried out for 35-40 cycles (5 min at 95 \u00b0C, 10 s at 95\u00b0C and 30 s at 60 \u00b0C). Finally, relative transcript expression of p53-regulated pro-apoptotic mRNA were normalized to\n\u03b2\n-actin, which was used as an internal control, and were expressed as values relative to the control group using the comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method.\n\nStatistical analysis\nComparisons between four groups were conducted using one-way ANOVA with a post hoc test; Bonferonni correction was used for repeated measures. All statistical analyses and bar graph displays were performed using Sigma Plot and Stat version 2.0 from Jandel Scientific, San Diego, CA. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) values."

    "Methods": "FrozenTorpedo californicaelectroplaque tissue is crushed in mortar and pestle and added to cold homogenization buffer (1 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM EGTA, 10 mM iodoacetamide and 1 mM PMSF). The slurry is grinded in a homogenizer or blender and the homogenate is then centrifuged at high speed to collect non-soluble membranes. It is preferable to spin this homogenate at 100,000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. The pellets are resuspended in cold homogenization buffer containing 1% (v/v) of Triton\u00aeX-100. Sample is rotated or agitated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Homogenate is then centrifuged at high speed, as described above, and the supernatant containing the AChR is collected for column chromatography and stored on ice. Neurotoxin affinity column is prepared by coupling of \u03b1-cobratoxin (Naja naja kauthia) to CNBR-agarose. CNBR-agarose resin is placed into 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and allowed to settle; the supernatant is then aspirated. The resin is washed with 1 mM hydrochloric acid swirl twice by resuspending resin, allowing resin to settle, and aspirating supernatant. The resin is then washed once with a coupling buffer (10 mM sodium carbonate [Na2CO3], 90 mM sodium bicarbonate [NaHCO3], 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.3). The resin is resuspended in coupling buffer and \u03b1-cobratoxin, dissolved in coupling buffer, is added. The resin and \u03b1-cobratoxin solution is rotated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The resin is then washed twice in coupling buffer. The resin is resuspended in a blocking buffer (100 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0) for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. The resin is allowed to settle and the buffer is removed. Acetate buffer (100 mM Na acetate trihydrate, 500 mM NaCl, pH 4.0) is added to resuspend the resin and allowed to settle. The buffer is removed. Resin is washed four times in a column buffer (100 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl). The resin can be added to a 1.5 by 20 cm column (35 mL volume) affixed with a 2-way stopcock on the outlet port placed in the stop flow position. First, the column buffer is added to column and then the stopcock is opened. The resin is poured in slowly. Additional column buffer may be used to resuspend resin in flask and add to column. The column is allowed to run until all resin is added. The column stopcock is closed and resin is allowed to settle. The column is washed five times in NaCl/Triton buffer (500 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 7.4). The column is now ready to use.\n\nMicrocrystalline hydroxyapatite in cross-linked 4% beaded agarose column is prepared by combining with equal volume 10 mM sodium phosphate (NaPi) buffer, pH 7.5 in an Erlenmeyer flask. The resin is washed twice in NaPi buffer. Resin is poured slowly into a 1.5 by 20 cm column (35 mL volume) affixed with a 2-way stopcock on the outlet port placed in the stop flow position. Residual resign in the flask may be resuspended in additional column buffer. The column is opened and allowed to run until all resin is added. The column stopcock is closed and resin is allowed to settle. When resin is completely settled, the stopcock is opened to let the buffer drain, by gravity, to just below the top of the column. The column is now ready to use.\n\nTo load theT. californicaelectroplaque tissue supernatant on the neurotoxin affinity column: the cap from neurotoxin affinity column is removed and the stopcock is opened to allow the column buffer to drain out just until it reaches the top of the resin. The resin is gently overlayed with 10 mM NaPi buffer and the column is opened until the buffer is drained just to the top of the resin. The column is gently refilled with a NaPi buffer to the top, filling the remaining head space of the column. The inlet cap is replaced and Luer tubing or similar (male luer connector, short silicon tubing and non-luer Teflon tubing) is attached at the top. The tubing is connected to a reservoir of NaPi buffer that is placed above to allow gravity to fill the column for constant free flow to exchange the buffer. The flow is stopped, the tubing is removed from the reservoir and the remaining buffer is removed from the top of the resin with a Pasteur pipette. TheT. californicaelectroplaque tissue supernatant is overlayed on top of the column, filling the column headspace. The column\u2019s stopcock is opened and the homogenate is allowed to run into the resin. The addition of more homogenate is applied to the top until all the homogenate samples are contained in the resin of the column. The NaPi buffer is gently overlayed on top of the resin to completely fill the column. The column is re-connected with a cap and tubing. The reservoir of the NaPi buffer that is placed above to allow gravity to fill the column. The column is washed with 2 column volumes of 10 mM NaPi buffer to remove non-bound proteins from the neurotoxin affinity column. The column\u2019s stopcock is closed.\n\nThe neurotoxin affinity column is attached to the hydroxyapatite column to begin collection of AChR. A carbachol buffer (1 M carbamylcholine chloride, 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100) is added to the system by first washing the carbachol buffer through hydroxyapatite column. The buffer in the space above the resin in the neurotoxin affinity column is replaced with the carbachol buffer. The neurotoxin affinity column\u2019s stopcock is connected to the top of the cap of the hydroxyapatite column by tubing. The stopcock of the hydroxyapatite column runs to the pump which will connect back to the top of the neurotoxin affinity column. The pump is set at the highest speed possible without developing leaks from high back pressure and run in a refrigerated chromatography cabinet or cold room for 24 h.\n\nAChR can be eluted from the hydroxyapatite column using a 152 mM NaPi buffer [102 mM Na2HPO4, 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4]. Fractions of approximately 1 mL (10\u201315 mL per run) are collected and tested for the presence of protein (colorimetric assay or absorbance reading). All the fractions that contain protein are pooled. The purified AChR is then dialyzed in dialysis tubing overnight at 4 \u00b0C with stirring against PBS. Glycerol is added to the AChR as 10% (v/v). The final preparation stored in small aliquots at \u221280 \u00b0C. The protein concentration amount should be determined. A SDS-PAGE gel stained by Coomassieblue should be performed to determine the purity of the AChR sample.\n\nRegenerating the neurotoxin affinity column and the hydroxyapatite column: the columns are disconnected. The columns can be regenerated by attaching a reservoir and flushing the column with 10 column volumes of NaCl/Triton buffer [1 \u00d7 PBS, pH 7.4, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100]. When complete, turn off the stopcocks and store at 4 \u00b0C until next use."

    "Methods": "Animals and drug treatment\nTransgenic SOD1G93A\n+\n(#002726), A\n2a\nR (#010685, C129 strain) knock-out (\n\u2212/\u2212\n) and F1 hybrid wild-type (#100012) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). This SOD1G93A mouse strain is in the mixed B6SJL background with high copy numbers of SOD1G93A transgene. For each established colony, only 5\u20136 generations of breeding were performed to maintain high copy numbers of SOD1G93A transgene. SOD1G93A mice were bred to F1 hybrid mice to maintain the colony, as suggested by the Jackson labs. The SOD1G93A\n+\nand A\n2a\nR\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice were bred to generate A\n2a\nR\n+/\u2212\nSOD1G93A\n+\nmice and subsequently littermates A\n2a\nR\n+/\u2212\nSOD1G93A\n+\n, A\n2a\nR\n\u2212/\u2212\nSOD1G93A\n+\n, and A\n2a\nR\n+/+\nSOD1G93A\n+\nmice. Both male and female mice were used in all experiments. Mice were housed in humidity-, temperature- and light-controlled environment and provided with food and water\nad libitum\nin accordance with the procedures of the National Institutes of Health\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\nand the Guidelines for the Use of Animals in Neuroscience Research and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Tufts University. For\nin vivo\nKW6002 administration, sterile KW6002 (3 mg/kg, permeable to the blood\u2013brain barrier) or PBS (sham control) was administered to SOD1G93A mice starting at P90\u201395 by daily intraperitoneal injection (i.p.).\n\nPrimary astrocyte cultures\nCortices were dissected, and the meninges were removed from the cortices under the dissecting microscope. The tissue was then minced with a razor blade and trypsinized (0.05% trypsin; Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min in a 37 \u00b0C water bath and then dissociated gently by trituration with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Dissociated cells were filtered through a 70 \u03bcm strainer to collect the clear astrocyte cell suspension. For setting up astrocyte and motor neuron co-cultures, 50,000 astrocytes per well were directly seeded on eight-well culture slides (BD Biosciences).\n\nDifferentiation and purification of motor neurons from mouse ES cells\nMouse ES cells (a kind gift from Dr. Kevin Eggan, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) were derived from Hb9-driven eGFP transgenic mice. ES cells were grown on top of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to 70\u201380% confluence in ES cell medium (knock-out DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 5% knock-out serum, 1% Glutamax, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.14% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1000 U of leukemia inhibitory factor). ES cells were then dissociated to induce the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs) in EB medium (DMEM/F-12, 10% knock-out serum, 1% Glutamax, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol). To differentiate EBs into motor neurons, retinoic acid (final concentration of 0.1 \u03bcM) and smoothened agonist (final concentration of 1 \u03bcM) were added into the medium for 5 d. Differentiated motor neurons were further purified through fluorescence-activated cell sorting based on the eGFP fluorescence, driven by Hb9 promoter activation during differentiation. Purified eGFP\n+\nmotor neurons were plated on a confluent astrocyte layer (35,000 per well) or directly (50,000 per well) on poly-D-lysine-coated eight-well culture slides (BD Biosciences) in motor neuron culture medium (DMEM/F-12, 5% horse serum, 1% Glutamax, 2% B27, 1% N-2 supplement, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 ng/ml GDNF, 10 ng/ml CNTF, and 10 ng/ml BDNF). Half of the motor neuron medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with growth factors every day. Fresh medium was replenished with adenosine (final conc.: 300 nM or 1 \u03bcM), A\n1\nR antagonist DPCPX (final conc.: 50 or 200 nM, Tocris Bioscience), or A\n2a\nR antagonist KW6002 (final conc.: 1 or 10 \u03bcM, Axon Medchem Reston, VA) for up to 21 d.\n\nDetermination of disease onset and end stage\nEarly disease onset in mice was determined by the loss of 10% forelimb grip strength from its baseline value. Briefly, the forelimb grip strength of an individual mouse was measured once a week starting at postnatal day 60 (P60) (for A\n2a\nR\n+/\u2212\nSOD1G93A\n+\n, A\n2a\nR\n\u2212/\u2212\nSOD1G93A\n+\n, and A\n2a\nR\n+/+\nSOD1G93A\n+\nmice) or every 4 d starting at P90 (for KW6002 administration), using the grip-strength meter (model 1027 DSM; Columbus Instruments). We first calculated the average of three peak grip-strength values as the baseline for forelimb grip strength for each mouse. We then assessed the 10% decreased value based on the baseline and determine the age at which the grip strength equals a 10% decrease of baseline value. The weight was measured along with the grip strength. Late disease onset was determined by the loss of 10% weight. Disease end stage was determined by a delayed (30 s) righting reflex. We started to analyze the righting reflex at P100. Both the measurement of grip strength and weight was performed in a complete blind manner.\n\nImmunoblot\nFreshly dissected (mouse) or frozen (human) spinal cord ventral horns were homogenized in lysis buffer (Tris\u2013HCl 20 mm, NaCl 140 mm, EDTA 1 mm, SDS 0.1%, Triton 1% and glycerol 10%). 50 \u03bcg of total cell lysate was loaded into 4\u201315% gradient SDS-PAGE gels. Separated proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) for 1 h. The membrane was blocked with 3% BSA in TBST (Tris buffer saline with 0.1% Tween 20) then incubated with a specific primary antibody overnight at 4 \u00b0C. On the following day, the membrane was incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000) diluted in TBST. Bands were visualized on CL-XPosure\u2122 film (Thermo Scientific) by ECL Plus chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific). The following antibodies were used on the immunoblots: anti-A\n1\nR (1:300, Abcam), anti-A\n2a\nR (1:2500, Millipore), anti-Iba 1 (1:1000, Wako), anti-\u03b2-actin (1:3000, Sigma), and anti-GFAP (1:30,000, Dako).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nESMNs that are co-cultured with WT astrocytes for 3 d were washed three times with PBS and fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with blocking solution (0.2% Triton X-100, 5% goat serum, and 1% BSA) for 30 min, followed by overnight incubation with the primary antibodies A\n2a\nR (1:200, Millipore) at 4 \u00b0C. After overnight incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS, and the immunostaining signal was detected with an Alexa Fluor-555-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Confocal images were captured with a Nikon A1R confocal microscope using NIS-elements software under a 20\u00d7 lens (Nikon Instruments).\n\nTRAP mRNA extraction and QRT-PCR\nRibosomal bound translating mRNAs from spinal cord astrocytes were specifically extracted using immunoprecipitation of BAC ALDH1L1 TRAP transgenic mouse spinal cords, as previously described (\nDoyle et al., 2008\n;\nHigashimori et al., 2013\n). Briefly, the anti-eGFP antibody (HtzGFP-19C8) was coupled to magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Invitrogen) as described in the kit instructions. Spinal cord supernatant was prepared and mixed with eGFP antibody-coupled beads for immunoprecipitation. Following immunoprecipitation, RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent and precipitated with isopropanol. The total RNA from the cortex was prepared using the Trizol reagent. RNA was then converted to cDNA using a high archive cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA). The relative abundance of A\n1\nR and A\n2a\nR transcripts was assessed using SYBR-Green (Life Technologies) and custom made primers (A\n2a\nR, F: 5\u2032GCCATCCCATTCGCCATCA3\u2032, R: 5\u2032GCAATAGCCAAGAGGCTGAAGA3\u2032; A\n1\nR, F: 5\u2032TGTGCCCGGAAATGTACTGG3\u2032, R: 5\u2032TCTGTGGCCCAATGTTGATAAG3\u2032). \u03b2-Actin was used as an endogenous control for the normalization of RNA quantity.\n\nMeasurement of forelimb grip strength\nThe forelimb grip strength was measured as described previously (\nKawamata et al., 2014\n;\nYamanaka et al., 2008\n). Grip strength was assessed using a grip-strength meter (model 1027 DSM; Columbus Instruments). We decide to focus on forelimb grip strength, as it gives consistent readout (\nYamanaka et al., 2008\n), while the hindlimb measurement is subject to high variability. Measurements of grip strength and animal weight usually start at P60. The baseline grip strength was calculated as the average of three peak grip strength values. There is an initial training period for the animals just before the first measurement on the same day. Animals were not trained to perform the grip strength task prior to P60.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStudent\u2019s t-test or one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni\u2019s test, were mainly used to determine statistical significance. The linear mixed-effects model was used to calculate the significance for all longitudinal forelimb grip strength changes. The Log-Rank analysis was used to determine the significance for Kaplan\u2013Meier curves. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results were presented as mean \u00b1 S.E.M., unless otherwise stated."

    "Methods": "Dietary supplementation with fish oil\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the\nAnimal Care and Use Committee\nat Fudan University. Four-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (Laboratory Animal LLC, Shanghai, China) were either fed a regular laboratory rodent diet with an inherently low n-3 PUFA concentration (0.5%) or the same diet supplemented with n-3 PUFAs (docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids, triple strength n-3 fish oil, Puritan\u2019s Pride, Oakdale, NY, USA; final n-3 PUFA concentration 4%) for 3 months before exposure to transient cerebral ischemia and up to 35 days after ischemia until sacrifice.\n\nTransient focal cerebral ischemia model\nTransient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in adult male mice (4 months old, 25\u201330g) by intraluminal occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) for 60 minutes, as described previously (\nWang et al., 2014\n). Experimental procedures were performed following Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) guidelines (\nFisher et al., 2009\n). Mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane vaporized in 30% O\n2\n/70%N\n2\nuntil they were unresponsive to the tail pinch test. Animals were then fitted with a nose cone blowing 1.5% isoflurane for anesthesia maintenance. A monofilament (7-0) with a silicone-coated tip was introduced into the common carotid artery, advanced to the origin of the MCA, and left in place for 60 minutes. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37\u00b10.5\u00b0C during surgery with a temperature-controlled heating pad. Arterial blood gases were analyzed at 15 minutes after the onset of ischemia and 15 minutes after reperfusion. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using laser speckle during the entire procedure. Animals that did not show an rCBF reduction of at least 75% of the baseline levels or that died after ischemia induction were excluded from further experimentation. Sham-operated mice underwent the same anesthesia and surgical procedures without MCA occlusion (MCAO).\n\nLaser speckle imaging\nAnimals were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane. A midline incision was made on the scalp, and tissues were removed with a scalpel to expose the skull surface. All procedures were performed using sterile technique. Laser speckle images (696 \u00d7 512 pixels) were acquired at 23 fps (exposure time T = 5 ms) by the laser speckle imaging system (Dolphin BioTech Ltd. Shanghai, China) with a laser diode (780 nm; Dolphin BioTech Ltd. Shanghai, China) placed over the skull (\nMiao et al., 2010\n). Briefly, 200 consecutive frames of speckle images were recorded per trial. Image processing took place off-line with Matlab software (Mathworks Co., Ltd, USA). Raw speckle images were processed by the random process estimator (RPE) method after registration to obtain the contrast image. Changes in cerebral blood flow and the ischemic area were calculated by Matlab software.\n\nMeasurement of infarct volume\nFourty-eight hours after MCAO, TTC staining was performed by a blinded investigator as we described previously (\nStetler et al., 2008\n). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and sacrificed. Brains were harvested and the forebrain was sliced into seven 1-mm-thick coronal sections. Sections were then stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) in saline at pH7.4 (37\u00b10.5\u00b0C) for 20 minutes, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 minutes before photography. Infarct volume was determined using the ImageJ software. To minimize the effect of edema on the measurement of infarct size, the hemispheric infarct area in each section was calculated by subtracting the area of normal, TTC-stained brain in the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere from the contralateral nonischemic area. Infarct volume was then calculated by summing the infarct areas over all sections and multiplied by the slice thickness.\n\nAssessment of neurological functions\nNeurological tests were performed 1 day before and 1\u201321 days after ischemia. Sensorimotor deficits were assessed by the Rotarod, pole, and cylinder tests. The Rotarod test was performed as described previously (\nWang et al., 2014\n). Briefly, mice were placed on a rotating drum accelerating from 4 to 40 rpm over 300 seconds. The latency to fall off the drum was then recorded. Preoperative training was performed for 3 days in 3 trials per day, with the last 3 trials serving as preoperative baseline. Postoperative tests were performed every two days for 14 days in 3 trials per day. The pole test was performed as described previously (\nBalkaya et al., 2013\n). Briefly, the mouse was placed face forward on the top of a vertical steel pole (height: 50 cm, diameter: 0.9 cm), which was covered with tape to create a rough surface. The latency to turn downward and the total time to reach the bottom of the cage with its front paws were recorded 4 times per day. Preoperative training was performed for 3 days in 4 trials per day. Postoperative tests were performed every other day for two weeks following surgery. The cylinder test was performed to assess asymmetries in forepaw use. The mouse was placed in a transparent cylinder (height: 15 cm, diameter: 9 cm) and videotaped for 5 minutes. Forepaw use during the first contact against the cylinder wall after rearing was then recorded. Forepaw preference was expressed as the relative proportion of right forepaw contacts, and calculated as follows: (left \u2013 right) / (left + right + both) \u00d7 100%. Neurological function tests were always performed by investigators blinded to experimental groups. Each neurobehavioral test was conducted on at least 8 animals per group.\n\nBrdU labeling of proliferating cells\nThe S-phase marker 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was used to label recently proliferated cells. BrdU (50 mg/kg body weight, Sigma-Aldrich) was injected intraperitoneally daily for 3\u201314 days after surgery. Animals were subsequently deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 0.9% NaCl followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer. Brains were then sequentially cryoprotected in 20% and 30% sucrose, and frozen serial coronal brain sections (25 \u00b5m) were prepared on a cryostat (Leica, Bensheim, Germany). Sections were pretreated with 2N HCl for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, followed by 0.1M boric acid (pH 8.5) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Sections were then blocked with the M.O.M kit (Vector, Brulingame, CA, USA), followed by incubation with mouse anti-BrdU antibody (1:1000, BD bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) for 1 hour at room temperature and overnight at 4\u00b0C. After a series of washes, sections were incubated in 594 or 488-Affinipure goat anti-mouse IgGs (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. West Grove, PA, USA) for 1 hour at room temperature.\n\nVascular labeling and analysis of vascular density\nLectin was applied as described previously (\nWang et al., 2014\n). Briefly, animals were transcardially perfused 5 minutes before euthanasia with biotin-conjugated tomato lectin (Vector labs, Burlingame, USA) at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg body weight. Coronal brain sections were prepared and incubated with FITC-streptavidin secondary antibodies to stain perfused vessels. Four sections at 0.1 mm intervals were analyzed in each brain. The vascular surface area (mm\n2\n) and the total vascular length (mm) per volume of tissue (mm\n3\n) were calculated using ImageJ software by a blinded observer.\n\nLipid extraction and fatty acid analysis\nCortices were fast frozen and dried into powder in a vacuum freeze dryer until subjected to analysis. Fatty acids were extracted as described previously (\nZhang et al., 2010\n). Fatty acid composition was determined by capillary gas chromatography using a Clarus 500 Gas Chomatograph (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Tissue fatty acid methyl ester peak identification was performed by comparison to the peak retention times of a 30-component methyl ester standard (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA). The concentration of each fatty acid was determined by calculating peak areas. Five animals were analyzed in each group.\n\nImmunohistochemical staining\nImmunohistochemical staining was performed on 25 \u00b5m-thick free-floating sections. Briefly, coronal brain sections were blocked with 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton-X 100 for 1 hour, followed by primary antibody incubations for 1 hour at room temperature and overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C. Mature neurons were visualized using anti-NeuN (1:1000; Millipore, Billerica, MA). After a series of washes, sections were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with goat anti rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with DyLight 594 (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labortories, Inc). Sections were mounted and coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA). Immature neural progenitor cells were visualized using anti-doublecortin (DCX, 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by Cy3-conjugated secondary IgG antibody (1:1000; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Myelin and abnormally dephosphorylated neurofilaments were visualized with anti-myelin basic protein (MBP, 1:500; Abcam) and anti-SMI32 (1:1000; Millipore, Billerica, MA), respectively. OPCs were visualized with anti-NG2 (1:500; Millipore, Billerica, MA). Fluorescence images were captured by a blinded observer as described above.\n\nWestern blot\nProtein isolation from brain tissues was performed as described previously (\nStetler et al., 2008\n). Western blot was performed using the standard SDS-PAGE method. PVDF membranes were blocked by 5% non-fat dried milk in TBS-T (10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween) at room temperature for 1 hour. Then membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against angiopoietin 1 (1:500, Abcam), angiopoietin 2 (1:500, Abcam), meteorin (1:500, R&D) and mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (1:1500, Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Chemilumiescence was detected with luminescencence detection system (Pierce, Rockford, USA) and semi-quantitatively analyzed by Quantity One 4.5.2 software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). Data were quantified from 4 animals per group.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are reported as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Significant differences between means were assessed by ANOVA and\npost hoc\nScheffe tests for multiple comparisons, unless otherwise indicated."

    "Methods": "Animal preparation and intracerebral injection\nAll animal procedures were approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals, University of Michigan, and all studies were conducted in accordance with the United States Public Health Service's Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. A total of 230 of male Fisher 344 rats at age of 18-month (body weight at 380\u2013450g from National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) were used for study. Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (45 mg/kg, i.p.) and the right femoral artery was catheterized to sample blood and monitor arterial blood pressure, blood pH, PaO\n2\n, PaCO\n2\n, hematocrit, and glucose levels. Body temperature was maintained at 37.5 \u00b0C by a feedback-controlled heating pad. Rats were then positioned in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, U.S.A.) and a cranial burr hole (1 mm) was drilled near the right coronal suture 3.5 mm lateral to the midline. A 26-gauge needle was inserted into the right basal ganglia (coordinates: 0.2 mm anterior, 5.5 mm ventral, and 3.5 mm lateral to the bregma). Autologous arterial blood (100\u00b5L) was infused at the rate of 10\u00b5l/min using a microinfusion pump (World Precision Instruments). After that, the needle was remained in position for 10 minutes for the blood clotting and then gently removed. The burr hole was filled with bone wax, and the skin incision was closed with suture after infusion.\n\nExperimental groups\nThere were 5 parts of experiments in this study.\nPart 1: ICH rats were treated with DFX (10, 50 or 100 mg/kg administered intramuscularly; n=9 for each dose) or vehicle (n=12) at 2 and 6 hours after ICH and then every 12 hours for 7 days. Sham rats were treated with 100mg/kg DFX (n=5) or vehicle (n=5). Rats were euthanized for histologic examination at 56 days after surgery.\nPart 2: Rats were treated with 50 mg/kg DFX 2 and 6 hours after ICH, then every 12 hours for either 2, 5, 7, or 14 days (n=9 for each duration) or treated with vehicle (n=3) for 14 days. Sham rats were treated with DFX (n=3) or vehicle (n=3) for 14 days. Rats were then euthanized for histologic examination at 56 days after surgery.\nPart 3: ICH rats were treated with DFX starting at 2, 4, 12, 24, or 48 hours (n=9 for each) or administered vehicle at 48 hours (n=3), and then a second injection was administered 4 hours after the first injection, then followed by an injection every 12 hours for 7 days. Rats were killed for histologic examination at 56 days after ICH.\nPart 4: ICH or sham rats were treated with DFX (100mg/kg administered intramuscularly; 2h after blood infusion and then at 12h intervals for up to 7 days) or vehicle (the same amount of saline) treatment. The ICH rats were euthanized at 1, 3 and 7 days later (n=5 each group, each time points), and the sham control rats were killed at 7 days (n=3 each group), for histological examination.\nPart 5: Rats received an intracerebral infusion of 100 \u00b5L autologous blood, and then received either DFX (100mg/kg administered intramuscularly; 2h after blood infusion and then at 12h intervals for up to 7 days) or vehicle (the same amount of saline) treatment. Rats were euthanized at days 1, 3 and 7 (n=4 each group) for Western blot analysis.\n\nImmunohistochemistry staining\nImmunohistochemistry staining was performed as described previously\n16\n. Briefly, Rats were euthanized (pentobarbital, 60mg/kg i.p.) and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1mM phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Brains were harvested and kept in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours and immersed in 30% sucrose for 3\u20134 days under 4\u00b0C. After that, the brain samples were embedded in a mixture of 30% sucrose and optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Inc., Torrance, USA) and sectioned to 18\u00b5-thick slices on a cryostat. Immunohistochemistry studies were performed with avidin-biotin complex technique as previously described\n17\n. The primary antibody was rabbit anti-phosphorylated-JNK antibody (Cell signaling, 1:200 dilution). The second antibody was biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 1:400 dilution). For immunofluorescence, the primary antibody was rabbit anti-phosphorylated-JNK antibody (Cell signaling, 1:200 dilution) and mouse anti-myelin basic protein (MBP, AbD Serotec, 1:100 dilution). The secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit mAb (Invitrogen, 1:500 dilution) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-mouse mAb (Invitrogen, 1:500 dilution). The double labeling was analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, BX51).\n\nLuxol fast blue staining\nLuxol fast blue staining was performed using Luxol fast blue-cresyl echt violet stain kit (American Mastertech). Brain sections were dehydrated with alcohols, and then incubated in in Luxol fast blue stain solution at 60\u00b0C overnight, followed by washing with distilled water. Sections were then quickly dipped in 0.05% lithium carbonate and 70% regent alcohol for gray and white matter differentiation. Then, the slices were incubated in cresyl echt violet stain for 10 minutes, dipped in 70% regent alcohol for 5\u201310 times, dehydrated through 3 changes of absolute alcohol and finally mounted with Permount (Fisher Scientific). The white matter bundles were examined by light microscopy. The quantitative analysis for Luxol fast blue stained section was performed as described in the previous literature\n18\n. The area of reduced Luxol fast blue staining in the ipsilateral basal ganglia was measured and expressed as a percentage of the contralateral side.\n\nWestern blotting\nWestern blot analysis was performed as previously described\n19\n. Briefly, brain tissue was perfused with 0.1mM phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) after euthanasia and bilateral basal ganglia were sampled. Then, each sample was immersed in western sample buffer and sonicated. Protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and 50\u00b5g protein from each sample were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a Hybond-C pure nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). The primary antibodies were rabbit anti-JNK antibody (Cell signaling, 1:1000 dilution) and rabbit anti-phosphorylated-JNK antibody (Cell signaling, 1:1000 dilution). The secondary antibodies were goat anti rabbit IgG (1:2000 dilution). The antigen\u2013antibody complexes were visualized with the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham) and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT film. The relative densities of bands were analyzed with NIH Image J.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll the data in this study are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Data were analyzed by Student t test for single comparisons or ANOVA with by post hoc Bonferroni-Dunn correction for multiple comparisons. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Animals and trauma brain injury model\nNeonatal Wistar rats at post-natal day 14 (P14) were subjected to controlled cortical impact insult. Pathological and behavioral changes were examined different days after TBI. The rats were housed in standard cages in 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle. The animal protocol was approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), in compliance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines. The experimental TBI procedures were performed as previously described with minor modifications. P14 rats were anesthetized with 1.5 % isoflurane and placed on a stereotaxic frame. After a midline skin incision, a 3.5 mm circular craniotomy was performed midway between lambda and bregma, 2.0 mm to the right of central suture using an electric drill. Controlled cortical impact was induced with an electric impact device using an impact tip. The PCI3000 precision cortical impactor (Hatteras Instruments, Cary, NC) and a 3.0 mm diameter flat fact tip with a slightly rounded edge (velocity=3m/s, depth=2.0 mm, and contact time=150 ms). Temperature was monitored by a rectal thermometer in all groups and maintained at 36 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C during surgery, using a heating pad controlled by a homeothermic blanket control unit (Havard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). After the injury, the skin was glued, and rats were allowed to recover in a humidity-controlled incubator (Thermocare, Incline Village, NV, USA). Animals in the sham and TBI groups were injected with saline after TBI, and their body temperature was maintained at 36-37\u00b0C in a humidity-controlled incubator for up to 6 hr after TBI. In the hypothermia group, animals were subjected to HPI201 and no other intervention of temperature change was applied.\n\nDrug administration and hypothermia induction\nAnimals were randomly divided into 3 groups: Sham control, TBI plus saline vehicle control and TBI plus HPI201-induced hypothermia group. HPI201, dissolved in saline, was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected. The first bolus injection (2 mg/kg) was given 15 min after TBI followed by additional one or two injections at a half of the initial dose (1 mg/kg, 1.5-4 hr interval) to keep a constant mild hypothermia (32-35\u00b0C) for 6 hr.\n\nTemperature measurement\nRectal and brain temperatures were measured during and after injury. Rectal temperature was monitored using a rectal probe (Harvard Apparatus) and measurements were repeated every 15 min for the first hour and every 60 min thereafter. Brain temperature was measured using a Physitemp probe (Temperature data acquisition system, Physitemp, Clifton, NJ) placed on the surface of the cerebral cortex. The Physitemp system allows simultaneous monitoring and data acquisition from 7 animals either during or after anesthesia. The implantable thermocouple probe has a tip diameter of 0.16 mm. The microprobe was connected to a guide cannula that attached to the caps of two dummy cannulas (model C313 DC, Plastic Products Co., Roanoke, VA, USA). A small hole was drilled into the caps of a size sufficient to accommodate the shaft of the microprobe. The microprobe was then inserted through caps, positioned, and glued into place with epoxy resin. The cap closer to the needle tip was used to screw the modified probe into an implanted guide cannula; the other cap provided additional mechanical strength. The probe was connected with an extension wire to the data acquisition system controlled by a computer.\n\nQuantification of contusion volume\nTo measure the contusion volumes, Nissl staining was performed on the brain sections collected at different time points after TBI. The rat brains were harvested and cut into 10 \u03bcM-thick fresh-frozen brain sections with 200 \u03bcm intervals. Sections were then fixed with a 1:1 mixture of 10% formalin and acetic acid for 10 min. After washing with distilled water for 5 min, slices were stained with a working solution containing buffer solution (0.1 M acetate acid and 0.1 M sodium acetate. 94:6) and Cresyl Violet acetate at a ratio of 5:1. The sections were then dehydrated in 100% ethyl alcohol and mounted.\nAfter Nissl staining, the sections were digitized using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA), and the areas of the contusion tissue and the two hemispheres quantified by an investigator blinded to the treatment of the animals (n=5-8 per group). Contusion volume was assessed based on the Cavalieri method as previously described (\nLee, et al., 2014\n). The number of sections and the section thickness (10 \u03bcm) were multiplied by the mean area of the remaining cortex. Contusion volumes were calculated based on the contusion areas (C) obtained from 10-12 sections as follows: C1*D+0.2(C1+C2+3+\u2026C12), with D being the distance between two sections (0.2 mm). Additionally, to consider the effects of swelling or edema, hemispheric tissue loss was calculated as a percentage calculated by [(contralateral hemispheric volume-ipsilateral hemispheric volume)/(contralateral hemispheric volume)\u00d7100%]. The calculated result is reported as the ratio of lesion volume against the corrected hemisphere volume.\n\nTerminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining\nA TUNEL assay kit (DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL system; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used to assess cell death by detecting fragmented DNA in 10-\u03bcm-thick coronal fresh frozen sections, followed the manufacture\u2019s instruction and as described previously (\nLi, et al., 2013\n). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (1:20,000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) for 5 min.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nTissues were collected and protein was isolated with RIPA buffer or Trizol. After sacrifice, animals were subjected to transcardial perfusion using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). Brain penumbra tissue was lysed in a buffer containing 0.02 M Na\n4\nP\n2\nO\n7\n, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% Triton, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 15,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Protein concentration was determined with a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA). Equivalent amounts of total protein were separated by molecular weight on an SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel, and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. The blot was incubated in 10% nonfat dry milk for 1 hr and then treated with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. The primary antibodies used and the dilutions for each were rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) at 1:400, rabbit anti-B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2; Cell Signaling) at 1:1000, rabbit anti-bcl-2 associated X protein antibody (Cell Signaling) at 1:2000, mouse anti-actin (Sigma) at 1:5000, rabbit anti-MMP-9 antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) at 1:2500, and rabbit anti-MMP-2 antibody (Millipore) at 1:2500. After washing with TBST, membranes were incubated with AP-conjugated or HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) for 2 hr at room temperature. After final washing with TBST, the signals were detected with bromochloroidolylphosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBP) solution (Sigma) or film. Signal intensity was measured by ImageJ (NIH) and normalized to the actin signal intensity.\n\nRT-PCR analysis\nTotal RNA from tissues of TBI rats were isolated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). RNA integrity was confirmed by detection of a 28S and 18S rRNA band. RNA was confirmed to be free of genomic DNA contamination by PCR in the absence of reverse transcriptase. The RNA samples were reverse transcribed in 20 \u03bcl of a reaction mixture containing 2X RT buffer and 20X RT enzyme mix according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. The samples were then incubated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and transferred to 4\u00b0C. The RT product (1 \u03bcl) was subjected to PCR amplification with 10 pmole primer, 10X standard Taq reaction buffer, 10 mM dNTP, and 0.625 unit Taq polymerase in 20 \u03bcl PCR reaction buffer (New England Biolabs Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA). PCR primers were used as follows (5\u2032-3\u2032): for TNF-\u03b1, GATCTCAAAGACAACCAACTAGTG (forward) and CTCCAGCTGGAAGACTCCTCCCAG (reverse); for IL-1beta, TCGGCCAAGACAGGTCGCTCA (forward) and TGGTTGCCCATCAGAGGCAAGG (reverse); for IL-6, GAGGATACCCCCAACAGACC (forward) and AAGTGCATCATCGTTGTTCATACA (reverse); for 18s, GACTCAACACGGGAAACCTC (forward) and ATGCCAGAGTCTCGTTCGTT (reverse). PCR mixtures were heated to 95\u00b0C for 10 min and cycled 30-37 times for each primer; cycles consisted of 95\u00b0C for 15 sec, 60\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 30 sec. After additional incubation at 72\u00b0C for 10 min, the PCR samples were transferred to 4\u00b0C. PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. Relative intensity of a PCR band was analyzed using InGenius3 manual gel documentation systems (Syngene, Frederick, MD, USA).\n\nExtravasation of Evans blue (EB) dye\nSterilized 2% Evans Blue (EB) solution was administered intravenously (i.v.) at a dosage of 0.08 ml per rat at 6 hr before sacrifice to visualize the BBB leakage. BBB permeability was investigated by monitoring extravasation of EB dye as previously described (\nLee, et al., 2014\n). The red auto-fluorescence of EB dye-albumin conjugate is evident in tissue sections examined by fluorescence microscope. Sterilized 2% EB dye (Sigma) solution was administered i.v. at a dosage of 0.08 ml per mouse 6 hr before sacrifice to visualize the BBB leakage. Six hours after 2% EB injection, and 12 hr after TBI, rats were sacrificed with an overdose of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg), decapitated and brains removed. Coronal sections were used to examine the EB extravasation by photographing under the TRITC (red) excitation wavelength at 1.25x for fluorescent microscopy (BX51, Olympus, Japan). Photoshop Professional was used to make an image mosaic (Adobe\u00ae Photoshop\u00ae CS5, San Jose, CA, USA).\n\nStatistical analysis\nStudent\u2019s 2-tailed t-test or 1-way ANOVA was used to compare different groups. Significant differences between groups were identified by a value of p<0.05. Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for statistical analysis and graphic presentation. Student\u2019s two-tailed t-test was used for comparison of 2 experimental groups, and One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction was used for multiple-group comparisons. Two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction was used for repeated measurements. Significant differences between groups were identified by a P value of <0.05. All data are presented as Mean\u00b1SEM."

    "Methods": "The PTMG model is developed by the injection of AChR-specific antibodies directly\ninto the animal. The method of injecting the antibody is intravenous (iv) or\nintraperitoneal (ip) to assure full delivery of the maximal calculated dose and rapid\nequilibration with extracellular fluid. Injection sites should be cleaned prior to\ninjection and observed for irritation. A brief isoflurane anesthesia is useful for both iv\nand for ip injections for the following reasons: 1) reduction in both pain and stress\nduring injection, 2) increase precision of injection since anesthesia renders the animal\nimmobile 3) elimination of manual restraint of the animal, thus freeing the hands of the\nexperimenter and 4) reduction of tension on the abdominal skin. By manually lifting the\nabdominal skin of the animal, the attached muscles and peritoneum are slightly elevated\nand IP injections can be performed easily, while minimizing the risk of injecting antibody\ninto an organ or of causing injury with the needle tip. To perform intravenous injections,\ntails should be warmed to produce vasodilation. A small gauge needle is placed bevel side\nup into the observed vein and the injection should occur slowly to ensure proper placement\nand to avoid cardiovascular failure. Resistance or blebbing of the tissue indicates an\nimproper placement. Animals should be monitored for signs of distress during the first six\nhours which would demonstrate too rapid disease progression and require euthanasia before\na treatment effect could be observed. For reproducibility and consistency of results,\ndocumentation of experimental design must be comprehensive. Weight and clinical scores (or\nother side effects related to model or therapeutic) that occur during disease progression\nshould be noted."

    "Methods": "All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the NIH guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals and were approved by both the VA Medical Center and University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Animals used across the various aspects of the current study, along with the general experimental paradigm, are presented inFigure 1. Twelve cats (6 ch'abc treated, 6 control) with similar hemisection magnitudes were used in the initial aspects of this study to assess the effects of 2 weeks of ch'abc treatment. These 12hemisections were similar to each other (Figure 2), and comparable to those reported in our prior studies assessing a longer treatment period (Tester and Howland, 2008;Jefferson et al., 2011). All 12 animals were trained 5x/week on a range of simple to challenging locomotor tasks and used in the behavioral aspects of the study. Eight of the 12 (4 vehicle control and 4 ch'abc treated), which met the following Fluorogold (FG) inclusion criteria, were included in the cell count aspects of the study: 1) FG labeling across the entire cross-sectional extent of the spinal cord, particularly in the ipsilateral and contralateral dorsolateral funiculi ; 2) no tracer spread into the lesion site; 3) FG-labeled neurons in the non-axotomized RN or MC which are easily detectable at 20X. Due to section loss during cutting in 2 of the 8 animals (1 from each group), one was excluded from red nucleus (RN) cell counts and the other from motor cortex (MC) cell counts."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll procedures involving mice were performed in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmology and Vision Research and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Miami. To block TLR and IL-1R signaling pathways, we bred\nrd1\nmice with global MyD88 knock-out mice (\nMyD88\n-/-\n), which have a constitutive deletion of MyD88 exon 3 and show reduced innate immune responses to TLR ligands and IL-1 and IL-18 (\nHou et al., 2008\n). The\nrd1\nmice (C3H/HeOuJ, The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA), Stock number 000635), are homozygous for the\nretinal degeneration 1\nmutation (\nPde6\u03b2\nrd1\n) (\nBowes et al., 1990\n;\nGibson et al., 2013\n) and were bred with\nMyD88\n-/-\nmice (B6.129P2(SJL)-MyD88\ntm1.1Defr\n/J, Stock number 009088, The Jackson Laboratory) (\nHou et al., 2008\n) to produce breeders that were homozygous for the\nrd1\nmutation and heterozygous for the MyD88 genotype (\nMyD88\n+/-\n). The breeders were backcrossed for 4 generations and were used to produce litters containing the\nrd1/MyD88\n+/+\nand\nrd1/MyD88\n-/-\ngenotypes. All mice were housed in a 12-hour light/dark cycle and were kept at equivalent distances from the overhead light.\n\nElectroretinograms (ERGs)\nERGs were performed as previously described (\nPatel and Hackam, 2014\n). After 4 hours of dark adaptation, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a solution containing 100 mg/Kg body weight ketamine (Vedco, Inc., St. Joseph, MO) and 10 mg/Kg xylazine solution (AnaSed, Akron, Lake Forest, IL) and the pupils were dilated with 10% phenylepherine hydrochloride (Akorn, Lake Forest, IL). The mice were placed on a small stage and wrapped in a modified heating blanket attached to a constant running water bath to maintain body temperature. A reference electrode was placed subcutaneously at the head and a ground electrode was inserted into the tail. Silver wire electrodes shaped into a large loop were placed on both corneas, and the stage was placed into a Ganzfeld light-emitting chamber (\nLi et al., 2010\n). Single flash stimuli were produced using the UTAS system controlled by EM for Windows software (LKC Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). Scotopic stimuli were flashes of white light ranging from 1 to 100 cds/m\n2\non a white background light, and photopic stimuli were flashes of green light on low intensity green background light.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and outer nuclear layer cell counts\nEnucleated eyes were fixed with cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and processed through increasing sucrose concentrations from 5% to 20%, then embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound and frozen. Embedded globes were sectioned into 8 \u03bcm thick sections and mounted onto Superfrost micro slides (VWR International, Radnor, PA) (\nYi et al., 2012\n). To detect activated microglia, the slides were first blocked with 20% goat serum then incubated with primary antibody rabbit anti-IBA-1 (Wako, Osaka, Japan) overnight at 4\u00b0C, washed with PBS and then incubated with secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor-488 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The retinas were washed and counterstained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and then viewed using a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200). Control slides omitting the primary antibody were viewed using the same microscopy and exposure settings. Microglia counts were performed by counting IBA-1 positive microglia with an ameboid shape from the outer plexiform layer (OPL) to the RPE, and expressed as density of activated microglial cells within a specific area of outer retina. Microglia were counted in the entire section in 3 adjacent retinal sections, in the equivalent regions of the retina in each animal.\nFor photoreceptor nuclei counts, columns of nuclei were counted at the periphery, near the ora serrata, and centrally, near the optic nerve region, to account for the recognized central-peripheral temporal gradient of degeneration (\nCarter-Dawson et al., 1978\n). Ten columns of DAPI-positive nuclei in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) were counted at each site centrally on either side of the optic nerve, and at each side of the cornea peripherally, adjacent to the ora serrata, while viewed at a 20\u00d7 magnification. Three adjacent retinal sections were counted in each region, and nuclear column counts averaged for central and peripheral regions, for a total of 60 columns per region per eye.\n\nRNA isolation and Quantitative PCR (qPCR)\nTotal mRNA was isolated from dissected retinas using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), as described (\nSilva et al., 2010\n). One microgram of RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Thermoscript RT (Invitrogen), and the cDNA samples were used for qPCR in the Mastercycler ep\nrealplex\n(Eppendorf, Biotech, Hamburg, Germany) using SYBRGreen (Biorad, Hercules, CA). Primer sequences specific to the genes of interest were selected to span at least one intron (\nTable 1\n). Amplification of each sample was performed in triplicate for each gene, and the expression levels were normalized to the housekeeping gene Acid Ribosomal Phosphoprotein (ARP) using the delta-delta C\nt\nmethod (\nHackam et al., 2004\n). The expression of each gene was then normalized to expression levels in wild type adult mouse retina, except for TNF-\u03b1, which was not detected in wild type retina, and was instead normalized to TNF-\u03b1 expression levels in the murine microglial cell line BV2.\nTable 1.

    "Methods": "Mice\n2D2 (\nBettelli et al., 2003\n) mice expressing the TCR transgene specific for MOG35-55 peptide / I-A\nb\n(Jackson Labs, #006912) were crossed with B6.129 (ICR)-Tg actin-beta CFP mice (Jackson Labs, #004218) to derive mice expressing 2D2-CFP cells for\nin vivo\ntracking by TPM. Similarly, OTII mice expressing the TCR transgene specific for OVA323 339 peptide / I-A\nb\n(Taconic, #1896) were crossed with C57BL/6-Tg ubiquitin GFP mice (Jackson Labs, #004353) to derive OTII-GFP cells for\nin vivo\nTPM tracking. C57BL/6J, B6.FVB-Tg CD11c-DTR/GFP mice (Jackson Labs, #004509) and B6.129P CX\n3\nCR1\n+/GFP\nmice (Jackson Labs, #005582) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory. All animals were housed and handled in accordance with protocols approved by the CWRU IACUC.\n\nActive EAE induction\nEAE was actively induced in 8\u201312 week old female mice as previously described (\nStromnes and Goverman, 2006\n). 3\u00d710\n6\nnaive splenic 2D2-CFP CD4 T cells, isolated by negative depletion using Dynal beads (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) were injected into recipient mice. 24 hours later, an emulsion with 200\u03bcg myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide 35 55 (MOG35 55; Anaspec, San Jose, CA, USA) with CFA (8 mg/mL H37RA and Incomplete Freund\u2019s Adjuvant (IFA); Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) was injected subcutaneously (s.c.) bilaterally on the lower back of the recipient mouse (Hooke Laboratories, Lawrence, MA, USA). Control mice were injected s.c. bilaterally with an emulsion consisting of PBS and CFA. 100 ng Pertussis toxin was administered intraperitoneal (i.p.) on days 0, 1 and 2. Daily clinical assessment of mice was performed. Clinical scores were assigned as previously described (\nMi et al., 2007\n;\nStromnes and Goverman, 2006\n).\n\nBlood brain barrier leakiness analysis\nTo compare the pattern of vessel leakiness induced by different inflammatory stimulants, 100ng LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 100ng PTx or 200 \u03bcL of PBS were injected i.p. into C57BL/6 mice on days 0, 1 and 2. 700ng of 150kDa TRITC dextran (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) vessel dye was injected i.v. on day 1 and day 2. On day 3, QTracker-655 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) was injected to highlight the vessels. The mice were sacrificed and whole brain tissues were imaged immediately by TPM.\n\nPriming of antigen-specific T cells\nTo determine whether myelin specific T cells require antigen-specific APCs for recruitment to the CNS, EAE was actively induced using a combination of two antigenic peptides in 8\u201312 week old female recipient mice. 3\u00d710\n6\nna\u00efve 2D2-CFP and 3\u00d710\n6\nna\u00efve OTII-GFP CD4\n+\nT cells were isolated separately by negative depletion using Dynal beads and co-injected into naive recipient mice. 24 hours later, an emulsion of 200 \u03bcg MOG35-55 only, 10 \u03bcg OVA323-339 only, or 200 \u03bcg MOG35-55 and 10 \u03bcg OVA323-339 combined (Anaspec, San Jose, CA, USA) with CFA (8 mg/mL H37RA and IFA; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) was injected s.c. bilaterally on the lower back of the recipient mice. Control mice were injected s.c. bilaterally with an emulsion of PBS and CFA. 100 ng PTx (List Biological Laboratories, Inc, Campbell, CA, USA) was administered i.p. on days 0, 1 and 2 to induce EAE.\n\nFlow cytometry analysis\nFor single-cell APC and T cell characterization, brain tissue was harvested on days 0 through 12 of EAE induction. Tissues were dissociated by collagenase D (1 mg/mL) and DNAse (250 units/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to form a single cell suspension after gentle dissociation with a dounce homogenizer and subjected to a 70%/37%/30% Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) gradient (\nCardona et al., 2006\n). Isolated cells were stained for CD45, CD11c, CD11b, CD4, CD8, IL-17, IFN-\u03b3 and FoxP3. Absolute numbers of cells per brain were determined by multiplying the number of events on FACS per collection volume by the total volume of cell samples. Spleen and LN were isolated from mice at the end of imaging on Day 12. Organs were crushed with the ends of 1ml syringes through a 40-\u03bcm cell strainer into single cell suspensions and were stained for V\u03b12 (OTII TCR\u03b1 chain), V\u03b211 (2D2 TCR\u03b2 chain), CD4, CD25, CD44, and CD69. Samples were collected and analyzed using the Accuri flow cytometer (BD Biosciences Co, San Jose, CA, USA).\n\nTissue histology analysis\nAfter injection of TRITC vessel dye and completion of intravital imaging, CX3CR1\n+/GFP\nmice were sacrificed and subjected to transcardial perfusion with 4% PFA. The brain tissue was harvested and 12-\u03bcm cryo-sections were performed and the samples were then subjected to confocal microscopy to obtain fluorescent images.\n\nIntravital TMP imaging\nCranial windows were created as previously described (\nMostany and Portera-Cailliau, 2008\n). The window surgery was performed 4 to 10 days before EAE induction to allow the local surgical site inflammation to subside. On the day of intravital imaging, 150kDa TRITC dextran or QTracker 655 was injected i.v. 10 minutes prior to imaging to highlight the vasculature. Image acquisition was conducted using Leica SP5 microscope system on an upright DM6000 stage (Leica Microsystems, Inc.) fitted with a 20X (N.A. 1.0) water immersion lens. The SP5 microscope was coupled with a Ti/sapphire laser (16W Cameleon XR laser, Coherent, Inc) tuned to 880 nm to illuminate fluorescent elements within the live tissue. An image volume of 750 \u00d7 750 \u00d7 150 \u03bcm was routinely collected every 30 seconds to yield\nxyzt\nimaging data set.\n\nHydroxyzine treatment\nOral administration at 5mg/kg/day was used for treatment with hydroxyzine. For the incidence curve, hydroxyzine was administered via drinking water at a concentration of 0.1mM starting from day \u22121. Later, for FACS and TPM analyses, 5 mg/kg of hydroxyzine was administered via daily gavage from day \u22121 to day 12.\n\nImaging data analysis\nSecond harmonic generation (SHG) signal produced by high collagen content structures were used to identify the pial layer and to discriminate parenchyma from meninges. Relative fluorescent intensity region of interest (ROI) measurements of dextran leaking into the parenchyma were made using the LAS-AF software (Leica Microsystems Inc, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). Timing and duration of vessel leaks were manually processed. Cellular dextran uptake and CD11c-GFP were identified by fluorescent intensity. Co-localization of TRITC and GFP signals and volume data were calculated using the Imaris software (BitPlane Inc, Zurich, Switzerland). T cell motility data was also analyzed using the Imaris software, which allows cell identification, as well as 3D tracking over time by producing information on individual positions, time and track length. T cell interactions with APCs were grouped into short contacts (< 2 min) and prolonged interactions (\u2265 2 min). Individual T cell migration tracking was further analyzed for track length, velocity, mean fluorescent intensity and cell flux using MATLAB software (Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA, USA). Cell flux was calculated by determining the vector between the beginning of the T cell track and the point at which the T cell came within a 50-\u03bcm radius from the center of an APC cluster. Contact time between APC and T cells, and T cell movement to and from the blood vessel were analyzed manually by visual inspection of individual image slices over time using the Imaris software.\n\nStatistical consideration\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA). For all analyses P < 0.05 was considered significant and degrees of freedom (df) are noted."

    "Methods": "Experimental animals\nExperimental animals were adult female mice (PTEN\nloxP/loxP\nstrain C;129S4-Pten\ntm1Hwu/J\n) (\nhttp://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/004597.html\n) that were between 5 and 7 weeks of age (20\u201325g) at the beginning of the experiment. Females mice were used because it is easier to manually express bladders of female mice following SCI, leading to fewer complications due to urinary tract infections. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of California Irvine.\nThirty eight mice received spinal cord injuries on two consecutive days (13 mice on the first day and 25 mice on the second day). Mice from each cage were assigned to 3 groups by a technician who was not involved in either surgeries or AAV-CRE/GFP injections. Groups were: 1) injury only, 2) vector control (AAV-GFP) and 3) PTEN-deleted group (AAV-CRE). Assignment to groups was not explicitly random; assignment to groups was made at the time the mice were removed from the cage maintaining approximately equal numbers between groups. The individuals performing the spinal cord injury surgery were blind as to group assignment. At the end of the surgery, mice were assigned a code by the technician so that testing could be done blind.\nA total of 3 out of 13 mice operated on the first day of surgery died or were euthanized. Two of those were a result of anesthesia complications during SCI surgery and one was euthanized due to excessive weight loss. A total of 4 out of 25 mice operated on the second day of surgery died or were euthanized, 3 of which were a result of anesthesia complications during SCI surgery and one was euthanized due to excessive weight loss. Behavior data were included in the analyses for mice that survived until the tracer injection surgeries (see below). Thus, after attrition due to all causes, total animal numbers at the end of all experiments were: injury only group n=10, vector control n=10 and PTEN-deleted group n=11 (\nTable 1\n).\nTable 1.\nFinal number of mice per group in each experiment\nGroup\nInjury only\nAAV-GFP\nAAV-CRE\nTOTAL\nExp #1\n3\n3\n4\n10\nExp #2\n7\n7\n7\n21\nTOTAL\n10\n10\n11\n31\nOpen in a new tab\n\nSpinal cord surgical procedures\nThe spinal cord injury model was previously described by\nAguilar et al 2010\n. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine (100mg/kg and 10mg/kg, respectively). When supplemental anesthesia was required, one-fourth of the original dose was given. Hair overlying the cervical vertebrae was removed by shaving, the skin was incised and the connective and muscle tissue was dissected to expose the vertebral column from C4\u2013C6. A dorsal laminectomy was performed on C5. The spinal column was clamped at C4 and C6 using forceps attached to the Infinite Horizon (IH) device platform. The impacting tip (1 mm diameter) was positioned at the middle of the dorsal spinal cord at C5 to generate the bilateral contusion. Impact force was 80 kilodynes (kdyn) to produce a moderate contusion. After creating the lesion, the muscle was sutured with 5\u20130 chromic gut and the skin was closed with 7-mm wound clips.\n\nAAV-CRE Injections\nAbout 20 min following the contusion injury, mice were transferred to a stereotaxic device, the scalp was shaved and drill holes were placed over the sensorimotor cortex. Mice received unilateral intra-cortical injections of either AAV-Cre to delete PTEN or the control vector AAV-GFP 6.8 \u00d7 10\n10\ngenome copies. Injections were made at 4 sites (0.4 \u03bcl/site) in the right sensorimotor cortex at 1.0mm lateral, 0.5 mm deep to the cortical surface and + 0.5, \u22120.2, \u22120.5, \u22121 mm with respect to bregma. The total time required to complete the intra-cortical injections was approximately 20 minutes. Following completion of the injections, the scalp was closed with 4-0 silk suture.\n\nPost-operative care\nFollowing the surgeries, the mice were immediately placed on water\u2013circulating jacketed heating pad at 37\u00b0C. After recovering from the anesthetic, mice were housed 4\u20135 per cage on Alpha-Dri bedding. For 5\u20137 days post-injury, mice received lactate Ringer solution (1ml/20g, sub-cutaneously) for hydration, Buprenorphine (0.01mg/kg) for analgesia, and Baytril (2.5mg/kg, subcutaneously) for prophylactic treatment against urinary tract infections. Animals were monitored twice daily for general health, coat quality (indicative of normal grooming activity) and mobility within the cage. Injured mice typically resume these activities within a few days following injury. Bladders were manually expressed twice/day for the first week and body weight was measured once per week for the remainder of the experiment. Diet supplements (fruit loop cereal) and regular food pellets were placed on the floor of the cage to provide easy access. Nutri-cal (1ml, Henry Schein, Melville, NY) was administered orally for the first week post-injury.\n\nBehavioral testing\nA 3 week handling and pre-training procedure was used prior to SCI, in order to calm the mice and enhance reliability when testing, during which the animals were trained and baselines were collected for all tasks. Behavioral testing was conducted for 14 weeks post-injury as described below for the individual tasks. Testing was done blind with respect to treatment groups except that scalp scarring made it possible to identify mice that received intra-cortical injections but not which vector was injected.\n\nGrip strength meter (GSM) task\nReliable assessment of gripping ability requires that animals are accustomed to being held. Therefore, the first week was limited to handling each animal for 5 min each day. In week 2, mice were trained on the Grip Strength Meter (GSM) task using a device designed by TSE-Systems and distributed by SciPro, Inc. For testing, mice are held by the tail next to the bar so that they reach out to grip the bar. To test grip strength of one paw, the opposite forepaw was gently taped with non-stick surgery tape (Micropore\u2122 surgical tape from 3M, catalog nr.1530-0) so that it could not be used for gripping. The dimension of the working piece of tape was approximately 0.5 \u00d7 0.75 inches to prevent the tape from hindering the pull by the opposite forepaw. In the two-paw version, mice are allowed to grip with both paws simultaneously. Once grip was established, mice are gently pulled away until they released their grip.\nGrip strength of each paw was tested three times per week (10 trials/session). The mice were held facing the bar so that they did not reach at an angle during the trials. Bar height was set as 3.5mm so that as mice were gently pulled away, they remain suspended just above the surface, but did not drop extensively when they released the bar.\nEach testing session assessed each forepaw separately or both paws together until 4 successful grips were recorded for a maximum of 15 trials per session. A positive grip was scored when the digits extended and then flexed upon contacting the bar followed by the digits being extended as the mouse released the bar and landed on the platform. A score of zero was given when a clenched/closed forepaw engaged the bar or if the forepaw landed on the platform in a clenched/closed position. When gripping by both forepaws was assessed, a score of zero was given if grip was only established by only one forepaw.\nIn each session, if the mouse did not grip within the first 10 trials then the mouse was given 0 for the four data points/session/forepaw(s). If the mouse gripped successfully during the first 10 trials, then the testing continued until 4 successful trials were executed or the 15 trials maximum was reached. Mice were tested 3 times prior to injury and 2 times/week for 14 weeks post-injury.\n\nHanging task\nTo assess the ability of the forepaws to grasp and maintain grip, we assessed the ability of mice to hang from a suspended metal rod as previously described (\nDiener et al 1998\n) with few modifications. Following handling as described above mice were trained for 2 days before collecting the baselines. For testing, the GSM base was placed vertically against a wall. The grip strength bar was raised to its maximal height so the mice could not lean against the base. For testing, hindpaws were taped to prevent their being used for climbing atop of the metal bar. We recorded how long the mice were able to hang before falling onto a pad about 10 ins below. Three trials were collected per session per mouse. If the mouse tried to use any parts of the body to hold onto the bar, the mouse\u2019s tail was gently pulled so that the mouse only used its forepaws to grasp the bar. Testing was performed two times prior to injury and every two weeks for 14 weeks post-injury.\n\nMini-ruby BDA tracing of CST projections\nIn order to trace the corticospinal tract, tracer injections were made into the right sensorimotor cortex at 15 weeks post-injury using the same coordinates as for AAV-CRE and AAV-GFP injections. For this purpose, mice were anesthetized using 2.5% isofluorane and positioned in a stereotaxic device, the fur was removed by shaving, the scalp was incised and the skull overlying the sensorimotor cortex was carefully removed with a dental drill. Mini-ruby BDA (dextran, tetramethylrhodamine, and biotin: molecular weight 10,000; 10% in dH\n2\nO (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was injected into a total of 4 sites (0.4 \u03bcl/site over a 3\u20135 min time period) using a 10 \u03bcl Hamilton microsyringe tipped with a pulled glass micropipette. After the injections were completed, the skin overlying the skull was sutured with 4-0 silk, and mice were placed on soft bedding on a water-jacketed warming pad at 37\u00b0C for 4h after surgery. Behavioral tests were not performed during the time between BDA injections and perfusion.\n\nTissue preparation\nAt the end of the study, mice were killed humanly with an overdose of Euthasol (0.1 ml/30g) and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n), pH=7.4. Spinal cords and brains were dissected and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight, then immersed in 27% sucrose for cryoprotection overnight, frozen in TissueTek OCT (VWR International) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until they were sectioned with a cryostat.\nThree tissue blocks were prepared from the spinal cords: 1) a tissue block extending from ~4mm above to 4mm below the lesion and containing the injury site; 2) the portion of the spinal cord rostral to the tissue block containing the lesion and 3) the portion of the spinal cord caudal to the tissue block containing the lesion, extending to the caudal most segment. The main block containing the lesion was sectioned at 20 \u03bcm in the horizontal plane, and the rostral end of spinal cord above the injury block and the caudal end below the injury were sectioned transversely. The brains were sectioned at 20\u03bcm in the coronal plane and sections were collected in TBS.\n\nImmunostaining to assess PTEN deletion\nTo address the PTEN deletion following AAV-Cre injection, free-flating coronal sections through the brain were incubated in 1% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min. After blocking in Tyramide Signal Amplification (TSA) blocking buffer (0.5g blocking reagent/ 40ml TBS, PerkinElmer, FP1012) sections were incubated in primary antibody at RT overnight (rabbit anti-PTEN, Cell Signaling 9188S, 1:250). Sections were washed in TBS and incubated with secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit HRP, Jackson Immunolabs 711-065-152, 1:250) in TSA blocking buffer for 2 hours at RT. Following a wash in TBS, sections were stained with 3\u20133\u2032 diaminobenzidine (DAB, Vector Labs SK-4100) for 5 min, rinsed in TBS, mounted on gelatin subbed slides in weak mounting solution (0.5% gelatin and 0.05% chromium potassium sulfate, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), air-dried and cover-slipped with DPX mounting medium.\n\nBDA and GFAP immunostaining\nThe block of the spinal cord containing the lesion was frozen in OCT and sectioned in the horizontal plane at 20 \u03bcm thickness, collecting every section, and maintaining serial order during histological processing. All the sections from the block containing the lesion site were co-stained for BDA and glial fibrilary acidic protein (GFAP). BDA staining was used to confirm interruption of CST axons due to the contusion injury and to analyze spared and regenerating axons. GFAP immunostaining was used for lesion identification.\nFree-floating sections were collected in PBS. After blocking in 5% normal goat serum in PBS, sections were incubated in primary antibody at 4\u00b0C overnight (rabbit anti-GFAP Dako ZO334, 1:1000) in PBS with 5% normal goat serum. The following day, sections were washed in PBS and incubated with the fluorescent secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, Molecular Probes A-11034, 1:250) in PBS with 5% normal goat serum for 2h at room temperature. Following GFAP immunohistochemistry, the sections were processed for BDA amplification signal using the TSA (PerkinElmer, NEL704A001KT) kit. After 15 min wash in PBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST), sections were incubated in horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated streptavidin (PerkinElmer, NEL750001EA, 1:200) in PBST for 2h at room temperature. The sections were washed three times in PBS and incubated in Cyanine 3 Tyramide reagent (PerkinElmer, FP 1046, 1:100) in amplification diluent (PerkinElmer, FP1052) for 15 min at room temperature. After being rinsed twice in PBS, sections were mounted on gelatin-subbed slides air-dried and cover-slipped with Vectashield\u00ae mounting medium.\nCross sections from the blocks rostral and caudal to the injury were washed twice in 1X PBS and 0.1% Triton X-100, incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (Vectastain ABC Kit, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). The next day, sections were washed twice in PBS, and then reacted with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride with nickel (DAB-N, Vector Labs, SK-4100) for 25 min at room temperature, rinsed in PBS and mounted onto gelatin coated slides, air-dried, dehydrated and coverslipped with DPX mounting media (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).\n\nAssessment of regenerative growth of corticospinal tract (CST) axons\nTotal BDA-labeled axon counts\nCross-sections from the rostral-most block were used to determine the extent of CST labeling above the lesion and the number of BDA-labeled axon arbors that enter the gray matter of the cervical spinal cord above the lesion. Images were captured on an Olympus AX-80 microscope (Olympus Provis) using MagnaFire SP 21B software (Optronics Software, Goleta, CA). The density of BDA labeled axons in the dorsal CST was very high, making it difficult to count all axons. Therefore, to estimate axon numbers in dCST, images were taken at 120\u00d7 initial magnification (a 60\u00d7 objective magnified 2\u00d7 under oil immersion). The axons were counted using the cell counter analyzer in ImageJ software. For the quantitative assessments the sample group was disclosed at the end of measurements.\n\nQuantification of regenerative growth\nTo determine the number of BDA-labeled axons that extended into and caudal to the lesion, 20 \u03bcm horizontal sections through the block containing the injury were examined. Images were captured at 10\u00d7, montages were created and exported to ImageJ software. Perpendicular lines to the dorsal surface were set in the middle of the lesion (0mm) and at 0.2mm intervals through the entire spinal cord caudal to the lesion (as illustrated in Fig 11A). BDA-labeled axons crossing these lines were quantified in three regions through the spinal cord: dorsal column, lateral column and gray matter caudal to the lesion. The axon counts were summed for each mouse and averaged for each group. Data are represented as an index for each category following the formula: Index dorsal column (Dc) = number of BDA labeled axons in dorsal column/total number of BDA labeled axons; Index lateral column (Lc) = number of BDA labeled axons in lateral column/total number of BDA labeled axons; Arbor index (AI) = total number of axon arbors in gray matter caudal to the lesion/total number of BDA labeled axons.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nData were analyzed using Prism software by One-Way ANOVA or Two-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Results were plotted as means plus or minus SEM."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experiments began with 3-4 months old, male Sprague-Dawley rats (310-440 g, colony 211, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN). Rats were individually housed in a controlled environment (12-h light/dark cycle). The Animal Care and Use Committee at the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Wisconsin approved all experimental procedures in this study.\n\nExperimental preparation\nSurgical preparation\nFor telemetry implantation and C\n2\ncervical hemisection, sterile surgery was performed under isoflurane anesthesia (in 100% O\n2\n). The rats were injected with buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg), carprofen (Rimadyl, 5 mg/kg) and enrofloxacin (Baytril, 4 mg/kg) subcutaneously to minimize potential post-operative pain and infection. Body temperature was maintained at 36.5-37.5\u00b0C using a rectal probe and external heating pad. A cannula was inserted into the trachea and the rats were artificially ventilated (tidal volume, 2.0-2.5 ml; Rodent Ventilator, model 683; Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA) with 1.5-2.5% isoflurane in 100% O\n2\nduring surgery. Effective anesthesia was confirmed by abolition of pedal withdrawal and corneal blink reflexes. Oxygen saturation was monitored by pulse oximetry (model 8600; Nonin Medical Inc. Plymouth, MN) during surgery. At the end of surgery buprenorphine, carprofen and enrofloxacin (see above for dosage) were administered at 12 h intervals for 48 h post-surgery. Rats were visually monitored and weighed daily. In spinally injured rats, post-surgical care included trimming nails after surgery, and cleaning fur, eyes and snout with warm water daily for 7 days to avoid accumulation of porphyrin. Rats had free access to pellets and high caloric nutritional gels inside their cages. In telemetry implantation and spinal injury surgeries, stainless steel staples were used to close the wound, and were removed 7 days post-surgery.\nTelemetry transmitter implantation\nAfter anesthetic induction, rats were placed in a supine position and the ventral surface of the abdominal muscle exposed. A sterilized transmitter (model 4ET-S1/2; Data Sciences International [DSI], St. Paul, MN) was inserted into the peritoneal cavity. The transmitter allowed simultaneous and continuous monitoring of electrical bio-potentials, body temperature and general locomotor activity. In the present study, the four bio-potential channels were used to record electromyographic (EMG) activity from bilateral diaphragm and second external intercostal (T2 EIC) muscles. Implantations were performed as follows. First, both right and left hemi-diaphragms were exposed through a midline incision. On both hemidiaphragms, two leads were implanted on the mid-costal area using a 23-G syringe needle guide and tissue adhesive (Vetbond 1469SB; 3M Animal care product, St. Paul, MN) as reported in previous studies (\nTerada and Mitchell, 2011\n). Next, right and left T2 EIC muscles were exposed through a 2.5 cm mid-sternum incision, starting in the upper edge of sternum, followed by retraction of pectoralis major and minor on the right and left side. The right and left T2 EIC muscles were implanted 1.0 cm right and left from the sternum respectively and the second interspace was identified by counting from the first interspace. The bi-potential lead pairs targeting T2 EIC muscles were tunneled subcutaneously from the body of the transmitter placed in the peritoneal cavity. As used in the diaphragm, all T2 EIC leads were implanted using a 23-G syringe needle guide and tissue adhesive to keep the leads on place. Finally, abdominal muscles and pectoralis major were sutured in the midline with polysorb 3.0 and the skin was closed with wound staples in both ventral thorax and abdomen.\nCervical C\n2\nhemisection\nOne week after telemetry implantation, spinal hemisections at the second cervical level (C\n2\nHS) were performed. The surgical technique was consistent with previous reports (\nDougherty et al., 2012b\n;\nFuller et al., 2009\n;\nVinit et al., 2009\n). After appropriate anesthesia and pre-operative care, the spinal cord was exposed at C\n2\nvia a dorsal laminectomy. The dura matter was cut and a left C\n2\nhemisection (C\n2\nHS) performed using a micro-scalpel followed by aspiration. The overlying muscles were sutured with polysorb 3.0 and the skin closed with stainless steel wound clips. Sham rats underwent cervical laminectomy without spinal injury.\nWhole-body plethysmography\nRats were placed individually in a 4 L DSI Plethysmography chamber (model 600-1211-001). Pressurized air flowed through the chamber at 4L/min, allowing control of inspired gas composition. The chamber was positioned onto a receiver (see below for telemetry signal acquisition) to measure EMG and plethysmography simultaneously. Compensated whole body plethysmography was used to assess tidal volume (V\nt\n); compensation was based on chamber temperature (model P/N 60-1210-001) and humidity sensors (model P/N 600-1211-001). The system used a transducer (Buxco, model TRD5700) and a gas analyzer (CWE, Gemini). Plethysmography data were analyzed in 1 min bins during baseline (i.e. normoxia, 20 minutes) and during maximum chemoreceptor stimulation (hypoxia: 10.5% O\n2\nand hypercapnia: 7% CO\n2\n; 20 min). To obtain more accurate V\nt\nassessments, we used intraperitoneal temperature from the telemetry system to compensate for body temperature changes.\nTelemetry signal acquisition\nFor the AIH protocol (see below), rats were placed in custom-made Plexiglas chambers positioned on receivers (model RPC-2; DSI, St. Paul, MN). Signals from the implanted radiotelemetry transmitter were detected by the receivers and sent to a data exchange matrix (model ACQ-7700; DSI, St Paul, MN). Four channels of EMG, body temperature and general locomotor activity in unanesthetized freely moving rats were monitored during experiments on a laboratory computer (data acquisition system: PONEMAH Physiology Platform; DSI, St. Paul, MN). EMG signals were sampled at 1200 Hz and analyzed with Neuroscore software (DSI, St. Paul, MN).\nGrooming Test\nForelimb grooming function was assessed using a scoring system adapted from Bertelli and Mira (\nBertelli and Mira, 1993\n), originally developed to examine recovery in a rat brachial plexus reconstruction model. Cool tap water was applied to the rat\u2019s head and back with soft gauze, and the rat was returned to the chamber. Grooming activity was recorded with a video camera from the onset of grooming through at least two stereotypical grooming sequences (~2 min), which include: 1) licking of the forepaws and face washing, 2) forelimb grooming of the face, 3) repetitive licking of the body, and 4) hindpaw scratching (\nBerntson et al., 1988\n). Scoring was done as illustrated in\nFig.8\n. Slow motion video playback was used to score each forelimb independently by the maximal contact made while initiating any part of the grooming sequence. The animals were tested after telemetry implantation, after spinal cord injuries, and weekly after dAIH exposure until the end of the study.\nFig 8.\nOpen in a new tab\nGrooming Test scoring.\nDrug preparation\nKW6002 (Istradefyline, Sigma-Aldrich) is a selective adenosine A\n2a\nreceptor antagonist with a molecular weight of 384 and a Ki of 29.6 nM in rats. It\u2019s half-life of 110 min, 97% bio-availability after intraperitoneal injection, and ability to cross the blood brain barrier (\nYang et al., 2007\n), make it a suitable drug for our\nin vivo\nexperiments. The drug was dissolved in DMSO at 9.3 mg/ml, sonicated and stored at 4\u00b0C in a dark vial protected from light. The day of the experiment, the drug was administrated via intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg.\nExperimental design\nFive days after telemetry implantation, grooming tests were performed, and then simultaneous plethysmography and EMG recordings were made during baseline air breathing (Nx) and maximum chemoreceptor stimulation (MCS) to establish pre-C\n2\nHS values. One day after C\n2\nHS, the same protocols were done to demonstrate a complete hemisection.\nSeven days post-C\n2\nHS, 32 rats were randomly allocated into the following groups: 1) dAIH + KW6002 (n=8), 2) dAIH + vehicle (n=8); 3) dNx + KW6002 (n=6); 4) dNx + vehicle (n=6); and 5) Sham (n=4). Group 1 rats received an intraperitoneal injection of KW6002 (0.5 mg/kg) 5 minutes before AIH on 7 consecutive days starting day 7 post-C\n2\nHS, and then weekly presentations of AIH with KW6002 (3-7 weeks post-C\n2\nHS). Group 2 rats received the same protocol, but KW6002 was replaced with vehicle (DMSO). During the same time window, rats in groups 3 and 4 (time control rats) were exposed to normoxia and KW6002 or vehicle, respectively. Sham rats were exposed to normoxia and did not receive intraperitoneal injections. All groups were compared over time through assessment of weekly video recording of grooming test performance, and simultaneous plethysmography and EMG recordings during normoxia and MCS until the end of the study (see\nfig.1\n, experimental design).\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nTimeline describing the experimental design from day 1 (1d) until 52 days post-spinal cord injury (dps). C2HS: cervical hemisection in second segment, dAIH/dNx: daily acute intermittent hypoxia or normoxia for seven days depending on groups (see methods), R1-R5: weekly presentations or \u201creminders\u201d of acute intermittent hypoxia or normoxia, M1-M6: weekly measurements including grooming test and simultaneous plethysmography and electromyography of bilateral diaphragm and second external intercostal muscles.\nAcute intermittent hypoxia\nNormoxic (21% O\n2\n) and hypoxic (10.5% O\n2\n) conditions were established in custom-made chambers (Plexiglas cylinder, 12 \u00d7 4 inches id; 1 rat per chamber) by mixing O\n2\nand N\n2\ngas with a custom-made computer-controlled mass-flow controller system to obtain the desired inspired oxygen concentrations. Within the chambers, CO\n2\nand O\n2\nlevels were continuously monitored during the entire protocol (O\n2\nAnalyzer, model 17518; CO\n2\nAnalyzer, model 17515; VacuMed Inc, Ventura, CA). Gas flowed through the chamber at a rate of 4 L/min, keeping chamber CO\n2\nconcentration less than 0.5% at all times. 95% of the change in O\n2\nlevels within hypoxic episodes was achieved in 25 \u00b1 5 sec. At 8:00 am, on the experimental day, rats were placed in the chamber for 2-hour acclimation. Next, intraperitoneal injections of either KW6002 or vehicle were administrated accordingly (see experimental design). Once all rats were in the chambers, the experimental groups were administered the AIH protocol (10, 5-min 10.5% O\n2\ninterspersed with 5-min 21% O\n2\n, for a total of 95 min). Control and sham rats were administered continuous normoxia (i.e. time controls; TC). Chamber temperature was kept at 22.5-24.5\u00b0C during the entire protocol.\nMaximum chemoreceptor stimulation\nNormoxic (21% O\n2\n), hypoxic (10.5% O\n2\n) and hypercapnic conditions (7% CO\n2\n) were established in plethysmography chambers (see above) by mixing O\n2\n, N\n2\nand CO\n2\ngas via a custom-made, computer-controlled mass flow controller system to obtain the desired inspired gas concentrations. After 30 min acclimation, baseline breathing during normoxia was recorded for 20 min, followed by 20 min of maximum chemoreceptor stimulation (MCS) (10.5% O\n2\nand 7% CO\n2,\n20 min). This protocol enables assessment of a standardized, high breathing level elicited by maximal chemoreflex activation (\nNavarrete-Opazo and Mitchell, 2014\n). EMGs and whole-body plethysmography were used to measure tidal volume (V\nt\n) and breathing frequency, along with respiratory muscle EMG signals.\nTissue Processing\nTo verify the extent of hemisections, each spinal cord was removed after completion of the experiments, immersed in paraformaldehyde (4%, overnight at 4\u00b0C) and cryoprotected in increasing concentrations of sucrose (20\u201330%). Tissues were then frozen in isopentane (\u221245\u00b0C) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Longitudinal sections of the spinal cord (C1 to C6, 30 \u03bcm thick) were stained with cresyl violet and examined histologically with light microscopy to reconstruct the injury in a transverse plane (\nVinit et al., 2006\n), according to Paxinos and Watson (\nPaxinos and Watson, 1998\n). We used ImageJ software (National Institute of Health;\nhttp://rsb.info.nih.gov/jj\n) to measure and compare the extent of the hemisection among groups.\n\nData analyses\nEMG signals were analyzed with Neuroscore software. The raw signal was filtered (100-624 Hz), rectified, integrated (100 msec) and averaged for each muscle. EMG values during active locomotor activity and grooming behavior were excluded in the analysis. Absolute values of tidal volume and breathing frequency were averaged. EMG amplitudes in each muscle were expressed as a percent change from pre-injury values. Grooming test score (0-5) was assessed separately in right and left forelimb.\nAll variables were compared among groups, and statistical inferences were made using two-way, repeated measures ANOVA for time (baseline and MCS) and treatment (see experimental design); individual comparisons were made using Fisher\u2019s LSD\npost hoc\ntests (Sigma-Stat version 2.03, Systat Software Inc, San Jose, CA, USA). Differences indicated as statistically significant were\nP\n< 0.05. All values are expressed as means \u00b1 SEM."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAnimals were housed and treated following the National Institutes of Health guidelines[\n38\n]. Each experiment utilized adult (4-6 month old) male Wistar rats (200-225g) as subjects. Rats were obtained from Harlan Animal Research Laboratory (Indianapolis, IN). The animal facility at the University of Cincinnati is accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and complied with all Federal animal care and use guidelines. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Cincinnati, where these studies were performed, approved all protocols pertaining to these experiments.\n\nExperimental Design\nRats were acclimated to their new environment for 24 hours before beginning experiments then randomized and divided into four groups (saline-no lesion, amitriptyline (AMI)-no lesion, saline +lesion, AMI +lesion) and given daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of sterile saline (Henry Schein) or 5mg/kg of amitriptyline hydrochloride (AMI, Sigma) for 14 days (\nFig. 1A\n). This 14-day pretreatment regimen and low dosage was based on previous studies indicating that this timing is important to achieve antidepressant efficacy [\n3\n,\n5\n,\n11\n]. On day 14, rats in the appropriate groups (+lesion) received unilateral intrastriatal injection of the DA neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), after which all rats continued to receive daily i.p. AMI or saline injections for the remainder of the experiment (four weeks). Lesioned and non-lesioned cohorts of rats from both saline and AMI groups were sacrificed on days 14, 17, 24 and 42, which corresponds to the following days post-lesion: day 0 (D0), day 3 (D3), day 10 (D10) and day 30 (D30). All rats were sacrificed at prescribed time-points and brains extracted and processed for either immunohistochemical or ELISA analyses.\nFigure 1. Experimental design and nigrostriatal interconnectivity.\nOpen in a new tab\nThe experimental timeline depicts the cross-sectional time course design highlighting specific time-points at which select cohorts are treated and sacrificed (A). Time course in gray (Days 0-42) shows sacrifice times for non-lesioned animals treated with saline or AMI. Structures dissected at these times are indicative of the trophic response elicited by saline or AMI treatment in intact animals. Time course in black (Days 0-30) depicts sacrifice times post-lesion for animals treated with saline or AMI. Structures dissected at these times are indicative of the trophic response elicited by saline or AMI in the degenerating nigrostriatal system. Representative map detailing the interconnectivity between dissected structures of interest (B).\nAbbreviations: AMI=amitriptyline hydrochloride, D=day, Sac=sacrifice, 6OHDA=6-hydroxydopamine, IHC=immunohistochemistry, ELISA=enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, STR=striatum, HIPP=hippocampus, SN=substantia nigra, FCX=frontal cortex, ACC=anterior cingulate cortex, PIR=piriform cortex\nTo assess trophic factor levels within the nigrostriatal system, we examined BDNF and GDNF protein in the SN and striatal structures. However, BDNF is not produced in the striatum [\n39\n,\n40\n], yet receives BDNF protein via anterograde/retrograde transport from various interconnected regions including the SN [\n41\n], hippocampus [\n42\n,\n43\n], frontal [\n39\n,\n40\n,\n44\n], piriform [\n45\n,\n46\n] and anterior cingulate cortices [\n47\n-\n50\n] (\nFig. 1B\n). Therefore, we extended the scope of the project to include these structures, and each hemisphere was microdissected and processed as an independent sample as described previously [\n51\n].\n\n6-OHDA Lesions\nPrior to surgery, all rats were anesthetized (30 mg/kg, pentobarbital, i.p.) and placed into a stereotaxic device. The 6-OHDA (dissolved in a 0.2% ascorbic acid-physiological saline) was made immediately prior to surgery and kept on ice. All rats received 2\u03bcl of 6-OHDA (5\u03bcg/\u03bcl) into the ipsilateral left striatum (AP +0.7, ML +3.0, DV -5.5 from skull) at a rate of 0.5\u03bcl per minute. After each injection, the needle was left in place for 2 minutes and then slowly withdrawn. Lesions were verified by stereological assessment of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive (THir) neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAnimals were euthanized via pentobarbital overdose (60mg/kg) and intracardially perfused with 0.9% saline followed by ice cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M PO\n4\nbuffer. Brains were extracted and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24 hours and sunk in 30% sucrose. Brains were cut into 40\u03bcm thick sections on a freezing microtome. A 1:6 series of coronal sections was double labeled for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (marker of dopamine neurons) and NeuN (general neuronal marker) using the free-floating method. A sequential approach was utilized to visualize these proteins using antibodies from the same host (mouse)[\n52\n]. Tissue was incubated in 0.3% H\n2\n0\n2\nfor 45 minutes, rinsed and blocked in 10% normal goat serum (1 hour) then incubated in primary mouse anti-NeuN antibody (1:500; Chemicon) overnight at 4\u00b0 C. Following primary incubation, sections were incubated in biotinylated secondary antisera against mouse IgG (1:400, Chemicon) followed by the Vector ABC detection kit employing horseradishperoxidase (Vector Labs). Antibody labeling was visualized by exposure to 0.5 mg/ml 3,3\u2019 diaminobenzidine (DAB), 2.5mg/ml nickel ammonium sulfate and 0.03% H\n2\nO\n2\nin Tris buffer. Tissue was rinsed and blocked again overnight at 4\u00b0C. The following day, tissue was incubated in mouse anti-TH antibody (1:4000, Chemicon) for four hours, followed by biotinylated secondary antisera against mouse IgG (same as above) and the Vector ABC detection kit. Labeling was visualized using the NovaRed kit (Vector Labs) and sections were mounted on subbed slides, dehydrated to xylene and coverslipped with Cytoseal (Richard-Allan Scientific). Since TH is localized to the cytoplasm, any cross reactivity to the biotinylated secondary antisera against mouse IgG labeling did not interfere with nuclear NeuN visualization.\n\nELISA\nAnimals were anesthetized (60mg/kg, pentobarbital, i.p.) and perfused with heparinized saline (0.9%). Brains were flash frozen in 3-methyl butane (Fisher) then stored at -80\u00b0C. 1-2 mm coronal slabs were blocked utilizing a brain blocker (Zivic, Pittsburg, PA) and both hemispheres of the SN, striatum, hippocampus, frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the piriform cortex were microdissected at a constant - 12\u00b0C on a cold plate (Teca, Chicago,IL) and stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C until analysis. Samples were homogenized on ice in 200ul of lysis buffer (M-PER; Pierce) with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). The Pierce BCA Protein Kit (Rockford, IL) was utilized for protein determination. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 20 minutes at 14,000g and the supernatant was collected. ELISAs were run using the Immunolon 4 HBX 96 well plate according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (GDNF/BDNF Promega Emax ImmunoAssay Kit). Samples were read (<30 minutes) on a spectrophotometer (Multiskan Spectrum, Thermolab Systems) with unknown values interpolated against standard curves.\n\nStereology for Cell Counts\nMicroBrightfield stereological software (MBF Bioscience, Inc.) was used for stereological quantitation of TH and NeuN cells. Outline of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) region of interest (ROI) was performed under low magnification (1.25X) and 20% of the designated area was sampled via a random series of counting frames systematically distributed throughout the contour. Cell counts were performed using the optical fractionator probe under high magnification (60X with oil) by an investigator blind to the animal experimental status. For the ROI, a z-stack of images was acquired at each sampling site within the stereological probe. Cells were counted by focusing through the tissue at 1-2 \u03bcm intervals (dissector height was 25\u03bcm with top/bottom guard zones of 2.5\u03bcm), and then a marker was placed over each NeuN/THir or NeuNir/TH negative neurons within the counting frame (50x50\u03bcm). Between 50 and 300 objects were counted to generate the stereological estimates. The total number of stained neurons (N) in the regions of interest was calculated using the following formula: N = N\nV\n\u00b7 V\nROI\nwhere N\nV\nis the numerical density and V\nROI\nis the volume of the region of interest. The volume was calculated according to the procedure of Cavalieri and variability within groups was assessed via the Coefficient of Error (CE). The Gunderson method was used for calculating the CE value (< 0.1) for the population estimate [\n53\n].\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAMI-mediated differences in trophic factor levels over time in intact animals were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison post-hoc analysis comparing all time points to the baseline control value. Differences between groups in 6-OHDA lesioned animals over time were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Comparisons in THir and NeuNir/TH negative neurons between groups were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. When appropriate, post-hoc comparisons were made between groups using the Student-Newman-Keuls or Bonferonni method. The level of significance was set at P \u2264 0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals, surgery, and drug treatment\nAdult Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles Rivers) were used for all experiments. The animals were housed at the Vanderbilt University\u2019s animal facility with 12h/12h light/dark cycle and had free access to food and water. All procedures followed NIH guidelines and were approved by the institutional IACUC committee. Rats were deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (75/5 mg/kg i.p.) and mounted on stereotaxis. The 6-OHDA lesion was performed as previously described (\nAhmed et al., 2007\n;\nBychkov et al., 2007\n). Briefly, rats were treated with desimipramine (25 mg/kg i.p.) 30 min prior to infusion of 6-OHDA. 6-OHDA (8 \u03bcg in 4 \u03bcl of 0.05% ascorbic acid) was infused unilaterally into the medial forebrain bundle at coordinates A=\u22124.3 mm, L=1.2 mm, H =\u22128.5 mm. After 3 weeks, the animals were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental groups for chronic treatment, saline or L-DOPA (L-3,4-Dyhydroxyphenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride in saline, 25 mg/kg s.c. twice daily) (\nFig. 1\n).\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of the experimental design.\nOpen in a new tab\nRats received unilateral 6-OHDA injection into the medial forebrain bundle and were allowed to recover for 3 weeks before being randomly assigned to the SALINE or L-DOPA treatment groups. Rats from the L-DOPA group were pretested for apomorphine-induced rotations once and then for L-DOPA-induced rotations for 5 days. Following pretesting, rats of both SALINE and L-DOPA groups were assigned to GFP or GRK6 groups and received unilateral injections of respective lentiviruses into the lesioned dorsolateral caudate-putamen as described in Methods. Following 5-day recovery period, rats were tested for L-DOPA-induced rotations (L-DOPA group) or treated with saline (SALINE group) for 10 days. Approximately 14 h after the last injection, the rats of each group were randomly challenged with either saline or L-DOPA and sacrificed 45 min later. The design produced 8 experimental groups; N \u2013 number of rats in each group.\nThe rats assigned to the L-DOPA group were tested for rotational response to apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg s.c.) for 1 h using an automated rotometer (AccuScan Instruments, Columbus, OH) and then pre-tested for L-DOPA-induced rotations for 5 days, as described previously (\nAhmed et al., 2010\n) (\nFig. 1\n). Since even a single injection of a dopaminergic drug produces priming (\nNadjar et al., 2009\n;\nSantini et al., 2010\n), the rats assigned to the saline treatment group were injected with saline instead of apomorphine and then with saline twice daily instead of L-DOPA, and exposed to the apparatus but did not display rotations. Since we found no clear relationship between the degree of DA depletion and rotation frequency or LID (\nAhmed et al., 2010\n;\nAhmed et al., 2007\n;\nGuigoni et al., 2005b\n), we did not exclude animals from the study based on apomorphine-induced rotations. Instead, apomorphine was used to maintain consistency in the experimental design with previous experiments (\nAhmed et al., 2010\n). The consistency with the previous experiments was important, since we were interested in signaling mechanisms underlying anti-LID activity of GRK6 we have documented.\nUpon completion of pre-testing phase, rats of saline group were randomly assigned to the GFP or GRK6 groups (\nFig. 1\n). Animals expressing GFP were used as a control. For gene transfer, the lentiviral vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) incorporating GFP or untagged wild type rat GRK6A under control of CMV promoter was used. Lentivirus was produced using 4-plasmid system in HEK293-FT cells and titered in HEK293A cells, as described previously (\nAhmed et al., 2010\n). The rats were injected with the GFP or GRK6 [rat GRK6c isoform; equivalent to human GRK6A (\nMushegian et al., 2012\n); accession #\nNP_001106183\n] lentivirus into the lesioned dorsolateral CPu under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia (75/5 mg/kg i.p.) at coordinates AP 0.2; ML 3.5; DV 5.7, as described (\nAhmed et al., 2010\n). The rats were allowed to recover for 5 days, and then drug treatment resumed and continued for 10 days. The L-DOPA-treated rats were tested for rotations for 1 h every day after the morning injections starting 15 min after the drug injection. The saline-treated rats were injected with saline twice daily instead of L-DOPA, and exposed to the apparatus but did not display rotations. At the end of the 10-day treatment period, the GFP and GRK6 saline- and L-DOPA-treated groups were randomly split in two to receive either saline or L-DOPA challenge (25 mg/kg s.c) 14 h after the last injection (\nFig. 1\n).\n\nTissue preparation\nThe rats were decapitated 45 min after the saline or L-DOPA challenge under isoflurane anesthesia, the brains were collected and rapidly frozen on dry ice. The brain area in the dorsolateral CPu surrounding the injection site in the lesioned striatum was outlined precisely on the cryostat-cut 100 \u03bcm-thick coronal sections, and the tissue was scraped into 200 \u03bcl of Lysis solution (Ambion, Austin, TX). The corresponding area approximately of the same size was collected from the intact striatum. Protein concentration in the samples was measured with Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until needed.\n\nQuantitative Western Blotting\nTo prepare samples for Western blotting, 100 \u03bcg of total protein was precipitated from Lysis buffer with 90% (v/v) methanol. The protein was then pelleted by centrifugation [10,000g, 10 min at room temperature (RT)], washed with 1 ml of 90% methanol, dried, and dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer at the final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The samples (samples from different groups loaded in counterbalanced order) were run in 26-well Criterion cassettes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Electrophoresis and transfer onto Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) membrane were performed essentially as we described previously (\nAhmed et al., 2010\n;\nAhmed et al., 2008\n;\nBezard et al., 2005\n;\nBychkov et al., 2007\n;\nBychkov et al., 2010\n). To estimate the degree of dopamine denervation, we measured tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) concentration in dorsolateral CPu using rabbit polyclonal antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) at 1:10,000. We used rabbit polyclonal antibodies (catalog #sc-566; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) to quantify endogenous GRK6 (1:500). Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (JL-8 Clontech, 1:500) was used to quantify expressed GFP. The following antibodies to signaling proteins were used (all from Cell Signaling Technologies; catalog numbers given in parentheses) at dilutions recommended by the manufacturer: mouse monoclonal antibody to phospho-ERK1/2 (#9106), mouse monoclonal antibodies to phospho-p38 (#9216), rabbit polyclonal to phospho-Akt(Thr\n308\n) (#4056) and phospho-Akt(Ser\n473\n) (#9277), rabbit monoclonal to phospho-SAPK/JNK (#9251), rabbit polyclonal to ERK1/2 (#9102), Akt (#9272), p38 (#9212), rabbit monoclonal to SAPK/JNK1/2/3 (#9258). The antibodies uses were not isoform-specific detecting all isoforms of signaling proteins of interest. \u0394FosB was detected with rabbit polyclonal antibody (#9890) that recognizes \u0394FosB and \u03942\u0394FosB [a double truncated FosB that lacks N-terminal Fos-homology domain; produced from \u0394fosB mRNA by alternative translation initiation (\nSabatakos et al., 2008\n)], but does not cross-react with FosB. Blots were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with appropriate primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at 1:10,000 dilution (1 h at RT) and SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence reagent WestPico (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Upon development, the blots were exposed to X-ray film for appropriate periods of time.\nStandards were used to help with band identification, ensure signal linearity for quantification, and normalize inter-blot variations. For GRK6, dilutions of standard Sf9 cells-expressed purified human GRK6 (\nLodowski et al., 2006\n) kindly provided by Dr. John Tesmer (University of Michigan at Ann Arbor) in sample buffer were loaded onto each gel along with samples. Appropriate dilutions of GRK6 protein were loaded onto each gel alongside the samples to generate calibration curves. To determine absolute ERK1/2 concentrations, we used recombinant purified phospho-ERK2 or unphosphorylated ERK2 expressed in\nE. coli\nand purified as described (\nWaas et al., 2003\n) as standards. To identify bands corresponding to phosphorylated p38 and Akt at Thr\n308\nor Ser\n473\n, we used lysates prepared from HEK293 cells stimulated with FGF (10 ng/mL) for 5 min. To identify phospho-JNK bands, we used lysates prepared from HEK293 cells stimulated with anisomycin (1 \u03bcM for 15 min).\n\nIsolation and characterization of the nuclear and cytosolic fractions\nThe Nuclei Pure Prep Nuclei Isolation Kit (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was used to prepare nuclear and cytosolic fractions from the rat tissue. The intact and lesioned striatal from rats injected with either GFP or GRK6 lentivirus and chronically treated with L-DOPA as described above were dissected and homogenized in 8 ml of Lysis buffer and the nuclei were separated from the cytosolic structured by differential centrifugation according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Final nuclei preparations were dissolved in 200 ml of Nuclei Storage buffer from the kit. Protein concentration in the samples was measured with Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Proteins from the nuclear and cytosolic fractions were precipitated with methanol and dissolved in in sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer at the final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. \u0394FosB was detected with rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, cat.#9890, 1:1000) as described above. Lentivirally-delivered GFP and GFP-tagged GRK6 were detected with mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (JL-8 Clontech, 1:500). Caspase-3 detected with rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, cat.#9662, 1:1000) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1, Cell Signaling Technology, cat.#2062, 1:1000) were used as markers of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions, respectively.\n\nData Analysis\nFor Western blots, the gray values of the bands were measured on X-ray film using Versadoc imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Calibration curves were fitted to linear equations using Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to ensure that all the samples were in the linear range and to reduce blot-to-blot variability, as previously described (\nAhmed et al., 2010\n;\nAhmed et al., 2007\n;\nBychkov et al., 2007\n;\nBychkov et al., 2010\n;\nBychkov et al., 2011\n;\nBychkov et al., 2013\n;\nBychkov et al., 2008\n). For the statistical analysis StatView software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used. The rat rotational behavior was analyzed by two-way repeated measure ANOVA with Protein (GFP and GRK6) as between and Session as within group factor. Alternatively, rotations within each testing session were analyzed by two-way repeated measure ANOVA with Protein (GFP and GRK6) as between and Bin (5 min testing intervals) as within group factor. The experiment with signaling pathways essentially followed full factorial design with Protein (GFP versus GRK6), Treatment (SALINE versus L-DOPA), and Challenge (Saline and L-DOPA), in addition to within group factor Hemisphere (Intact versus Lesioned). The interaction of Protein with Hemisphere was limited, since GFP or GRK6 were only expressed in the lesioned striatum. The full analysis was rarely informative. Western blot data were analyzed separately for each Treatment by repeated measure ANOVA with Hemisphere as repeated measure factor and Protein and Challenge as between group factors (\nTable S1\n). Since the effect of GRK6 was confined to the lesioned striatum, separate analysis of the data in the lesioned hemisphere by three-way ANOVA with Protein, Treatment, and Challenge yielded most meaningful results. In some cases, a separate analysis of the L-DOPA-challenged groups by two-way ANOVA with Protein and Treatment was also performed. The comparison of values in the intact and lesioned striata within each experimental group was performed with paired Student\u2019s t-test. Post hoc comparisons of means were performed in some cases using Student\u2019s t-test (for two-group comparisons). In all cases the value of p<0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "All experimental procedures were performed in compliance with the University of California Los Angeles Chancellor\u2019s Animal Research Committee and complied with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nSurgical and drug injection procedures\nAll survival surgical procedures were performed under aseptic conditions. Ten adult female Long Evans rats (280\u2013300 g) were anesthetized with 1.5\u20132.5% isoflurane in 0.4% O\n2.\nA ventral skin incision of the neck was made and the underlying muscles, trachea, and esophagus were displaced. A small piece of the ventrocaudal part of the occipital bone was removed and the medullary pyramids were exposed. The pyramids were incised bilaterally with a sharp scalpel blade. The esophagus, trachea, and muscles were repositioned, and the skin was sutured (\nKanagal and Muir, 2009\n). A partial laminectomy at spinal segments C4\u2013C5 was performed to expose the spinal cord. The dura was cut and an ~1.5 mm deep incision was made in the right and left lateral funiculi and the tissue displaced laterally using a sharp scalpel blade. This procedure damaged the most dorsal aspect of the dorsolateral funiculi. A laminectomy then was performed at C7 and two injections, each containing 1 \u03bcl of chondroitinase-ABC at 100 U/ml (Seikagaku) (CHASE group,\nn\n= 5) or Penicillinase (Sigma) (PEN group,\nn\n= 5), were made into the most rostral and caudal edges of the exposed spinal segment. A glass micropipette was lowered ~1 mm into the gray matter and the drug delivered over a period of 10 min (\nGarcia-Alias et al., 2011\n). The muscles and skin were sutured. The rats were allowed to fully recover in an incubator (37 \u00b0C) before being returned to their home cages. To evaluate the extension of CSPG digestion in the cervical spinal cord, three additional rats received a spinal cord injury followed by chondroitinase-ABC injection and were perfused the following day. Their tissue was processed as described below.\n\nTraining and testing of reaching and grasping\nThe rats were placed individually inside a clear plastic box (18 cm \u00d7 15 cm \u00d7 31 cm) with a small opening in the front wall (3 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm) and trained to reach and grasp for chocolate pellets (45 mg, Bio-Serv) placed on a platform positioned 1 cm outside the window. The rats had to extend their preferred forelimb to reach and grasp the pellets. During each testing session, 20 pellets were presented to the rats and the ratio of the number of pellets eaten to the number of attempts was calculated (\nWhishaw et al., 2008\n). The rats were tested prior to the injury and weekly for 6 weeks post-injury. The rats were video recorded at 400 frames/s (Casio EX-FH25) and the movement elements during each attempt were analyzed following Whishaw\u2019s score (\nPiecharka et al., 2005\n). Five reaches with each limb by each rat were rated for qualitative features of the movement. A score of \u201c0\u201d was given if the movement was performed normally. A score of \u201c2\u201d was given if the movement was abnormal. A score of \u201c1\u201d was given in cases where there was some ambiguity concerning the normality of the movement. Seven component movements of a reach were rated: 1) advance: the limb is advanced directly through the slot toward the food target; 2) digits extend: during the advance, the digits extend so that the digit tips are pointing toward the target; 3) arpeggio: when the paw is over the target, the paw pronates from digit 5 (the outer digit) through digit 2 and, at the same time, the digits open; 4) grasp: the digits close and flex around the food, with the paw remaining in place, and the wrist is slightly extended to lift the food; 5) supination I: as the paw is withdrawn, the paw supinates by almost 90\u00b0; 6) supination II: once the paw is withdrawn from the slot to the mouth the paw further supinates by about 45\u00b0 to place the food in the mouth; and 7) release: the paw contacts the mouth and the paw opens to release the food.\n\nGrip strength\nAt 6 weeks post-injury, the grip strength of each rat was measured with a custom designed grip strength meter. Rats were allowed to grip a horizontal bar connected to a force transducer with both forepaws and then pulled away until the grip was released. The force exerted on the bar at the time of release was measured in three consecutive trials (\nGarcia-Alias et al., 2009\n). The maximum force for the right and left forepaws was calculated and compared with a group of three intact, age and weight matched, control rats.\n\nAssessment of overground locomotor ability\nOverground locomotor ability was tested prior to the injury and at 1 and 6 weeks post-injury. The forepaws and hindpaws were inked with different colors. The footprints were recorded on paper as the rats walked across a runway (8 cm wide and 100 cm long). The footprints then were used to determine mean stride length. The stride length was measured between the central pads of two consecutive prints on each side for the right and left forelimbs and hindlimbs. For each animal, the stride length was calculated as the average distance of 3\u20134 consecutive steps (\nGarcia-Alias et al., 2011\n).\n\nReaching and grasping rehabilitation\nStarting at 1 week post-surgery, rats in the CHASE group were subjected to reaching and grasping rehabilitation. Groups of 2\u20133 rats were placed in a cage with a plastic grid with square openings on the floor for 1 h/day, 5 days/wk. Seeds were placed in the square openings and the rats had to retrieve the seeds by extending their paws and grasping the seeds (\nGarcia-Alias et al., 2009\n). Rats in the PEN group did not undergo any rehabilitation regime; instead, the rats were placed in an empty cage without a grid on the floor, and with no seeds, for the same amount of time as the rats in the CHASE group were performing rehabilitation.\n\nHistological analyses\nAt the end of the functional evaluation, the rats received a unilateral stereotaxic injection of 1 \u03bcl of 10% dextran amine conjugated to 555-Alexafluoro in the gigantocellular nucleus of the reticular formation ipsilateral (coordinates: AP: \u221211.5 cm; DL: 0.15 cm; depth: 0.95 cm) to the preferred paw to reach and grasp (\nPaxinos and Watson, 1998\n). Ten days after the injection, the rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) The brainstems and spinal cords were removed and stored in a 30% sucrose solution. Coronal sections (30 \u03bcm thick) were cut in a cryostat. Two sections per spinal segment were selected and used to determine CST preservation and RST fiber density, respectively. To evaluate the extent of the injury, serial transverse sections at the site of injury were stained with cresyl violet. The images were magnified (10\u00d7) and the area of the dorso-lateral funiculi injuries was quantified using ImageJ software. To evaluate the localization of the injury the contour of the spinal cord and injury area was outlined. To verify the CST injury, 5 coronal sections per spinal segment were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against \u03b3PKC (1:500, Santa Cruz, CA). After several washes, the sections were incubated with the secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500; Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA, USA) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Following additional washes, the sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides. For evaluating antibody specificity, some sections were processed as described, but primary antibodies were not added. To evaluate the digestion of extracellular CSPG by the injected chondroitinase-ABC, serial transverse sections were incubated 72 h at 4 \u00b0C with mouse monoclonal antibodies against CS-56 (1:200, Sigma). After several washes, the sections were incubated with the secondary biotinylated antibody goat anti-mouse IgM (Jackson 1:500) and amplified with TSA + kit (1:500; Perkin-Elmer) and followed the procedures aforementioned. For determining RST fiber density, magnified images (10\u00d7) of serial coronal spinal cord sections were taken. A grid was overlaid on each image and the traced axons were tagged following the inclusion criteria of\nRosenzweig et al. (2010)\n. Tagged coordinate points were imported to Microsoft Excel that translated the coordinate points into a spreadsheet grid that represented the distribution of axons in the segment when divided into a 45 \u00d7 45 frame grid. Grid values indicate the number of axons counted in that particular frame. A color gradient was applied based on the value in each grid frame. A heat map color gradient was adjusted for each segment according to its highest value. A diagram of the laminae distribution in each segment was overlaid on each heat map to quantify the number of axons found in each lamina for each spinal segment between C2 and T1. Finally, the number of quantified axons per in each laminae was normalized with the total number of axons quantified in the white matter of the most rostral section of the same spinal cord segment.\n\nStatistical analyses\nThe data are reported as mean \u00b1 SEM. Comparisons in the behavioral parameters among groups were made using repeated measures ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni post-hoc analyses. Histological data were compared using two tailed Student\nt\n-tests. Differences were considered statistically significant at\nP\n< 0.05."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nAdult male C57Bl/6 mice, aged 2.5\u20135 months, were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (\nwww.jax.org\n) and used in all experiments. Mice were housed under a 12/12 hr light/dark cycle under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. All procedures were performed in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Use of Experimental Animals and were approved and overseen by Yale University\u2019s IACUC.\n\nDrugs\nPicrotoxin (PTX), muscimol (Musc), (RS)-4-(phosphonomethyl)-piperazine-2-carboxylic acid (PMPA), and D-amphetamine sulfate were all purchased from Sigma, St. Louis, MO. They were dissolved in sterile saline for intracranial or intraperitoneal administration.\n\nProcedures\nStainless steel single- or double-injection guide cannulae (PlasticsOne, Roanoke, VA) were unilaterally implanted 1 week before experiments, using standard stereotaxic methods under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Initial mapping experiments (\nFigure 1A\n) used a range of targeting coordinates; subsequent experiments focused on three regions: AP+0.5, L \u22122.2, V \u22123.2 for dorsolateral striatum (DLS); AP+0.4, L \u22121.7, V \u22123.5 for central striatum (CES); or AP-0.1, L \u22122.0, V \u22121.5 for sensorimotor cortex (Cx) (all refer to the tip of injection cannula; see\nFigure 1A\n). For pharmacological and EEG experiments only DLS and Cx sites were used, as these were the sites where tics were most reliably elicited (see\nFigure 1\n). The total number of mice used for mapping and dose-response PTX experiments was 67. The number of animals for dose-response experiments in Cx, DLS, and CES is presented in\nTable 1\n.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nA.\nDiagram of frontal sections (from\nwww.brain-map.org\n) showing sites of injections and evoked effects in exploratory pilot experiments:\ntic-like movements;\nno apparent behavioral effect;\nlocomotor activation, sniffing, hindpaw licking;\nbehavioral depression.\nB.\nCresyl violet staining of a typical injection site in striatum after infusion of 0.3 uL toluidine blue 20 min before euthanasia.\nC\n.

During microinjection the animal was freely moving in the home cage. At the end of infusion the injector remained in place for an additional 1 min. Two Hamilton syringes were used for simultaneous double injections into striatum and cortex. For experiments requiring local pre-treatment with other pharmacological agents, the pre-treatment injection was performed 10 min before PTX injection into the same site, or a different site using double cannulae. A within-subjects design was used. The number of animals in each experiment is as follows: 4 in intra-DLS PTX/Musc, 7 in intra-DLS PTX/PMPA, 5 in intra-DLS PTX/intra-cortical Musc, 5 in intra-cortical PTX/intra-DLS Musc.\nTic-like movements of the head or limbs were counted over 5-min intervals at 5, 15, 25, and 45 min after PTX microinjection. Data are represented at each time point or as the total number of tics summed over all intervals.\nFollowing all striatal targetings and most cortical targetings, 0.3 uL of toluidine blue was microinjected through the cannula 15 min prior to sacrifice and cannula placement was confirmed by visualization of the dye in brain slice.\n\nEEG\nEEG recordings were performed as previously described (\nBuchanan et al., 2014\n;\nBuchanan and Richerson, 2010\n). Briefly, mice were implanted with stainless steel guide cannulae (PlasticsOne, Roanoke, VA) into striatum as before, and an EEG head mount (PlasticsOne, Roanoke, VA) was secured to the skull with 4 epidural screws and dental cement. EEG was recorded from epidural screw electrodes over right frontal and parietal cortex with the aid of custom software written in Matlab. Two leads for EMG recording were implanted into the neck muscles, contralateral to the injection cannula. One week after surgery the animals were connected to the pre-amplifier (PlasticsOne, Roanoke, VA) and placed into a Plexiglass recording chamber. Baseline EEG was recorded for 30\u201340min followed by injection of PTX. Videos were recorded with two web cameras (Logitech Orbit AF) from the opposite sides, and video recording was temporally synchronized with EEG and EMG.\nFour mice were tested with 2 PTX injections, spaced 1\u20132 weeks apart: low (0.1\u20130.2ug) and high (0.3\u20130.6ug) doses of PTX to compare tic- and seizure-associated EEG. In each experiment 10-s intervals of digitized data recording, corresponding to 5, 10, 20, and 40 min after PTX, were extracted in MatLab (Mathworks, Natick, MA). EEG was analyzed in epochs corresponding to tic-like motor events, identified by the corresponding EMG bursts. These events were frequently associated, especially at higher PTX doses, with complex discharges consistent with electrographic spikes lasting up to 70 msec, characterized by a brief positive sharp transient followed by a negative EEG deflection with an amplitude at least twice that of the baseline activity. Using these electrographic parameters, the EEG was re-evaluated for the presence of similar complex discharges in the absence of tic-like motor events.\n\nAnalysis\nResults are presented as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. or medians and 25 to 75 percentile range, as appropriate. Between-subject designs were analyzed by one or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s posthoc test. Latency data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA followed by Dunn\u2019s posthoc test. Within-subject designs, where same animals received repeated treatments, were analyzed by repeated measures (RM) ANOVA with Geisser-Greenhouse\u2019s correction or paired t-test where appropriate. The level of significance was p < 0.05 for all analyses."

Cells were differentiated for 8 days under these conditions.\n\nEthanol treatment\nDissociated neurosphere cells were treated at the onset of differentiation at day 0 (D0) with ethanol (Commercial Alcohols) at a final concentration of 70 mM. To study binge ethanol exposure, ethanol treatment was done only once at D0 for 48 hours (h) and cells were collected at day 2 (D2). For continuous ethanol exposure, cells were treated with ethanol starting at D0 for 8 days continuously and ethanol with media was refreshed every two days. To study the effect of ethanol withdrawal, the culture media was exchanged with fresh culture media after 48 h, and cells were kept in culture for an extra 6 days. The media was refreshed every other day. Control cells were cultured under similar experimental conditions in the absence of ethanol. Cells were harvested at D2 and day 8 (D8).\n\nQuantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)\nTotal RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA was converted to cDNA with a reaction set up containing Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) using previously described methods (\nKobrossy et al., 2006\n;\nLiyanage et al., 2013\n;\nNolte et al., 2006\n;\nRastegar et al., 2004\n).

Briefly, differentiated cells on coverslips were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, GIBCO) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized with 2% NP40 in PBS for 10 min, followed by preblocking with 10% normal goat serum (NGS, Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBS for 1 h. Appropriate primary antibodies were added and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C followed by washes with PBS. This was followed by incubation with secondary antibodies that were diluted in 10% NGS (1 h at room temperature). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with antifade containing 2 \u03bcg/ml DAPI. ICC signals were detected by an Axio Observer Z1 inverted microscope. Images were obtained using Zen 2011 software and assembled using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. For cell population determination, approximately 250 DAPI\n+\ncells from D2 and 400\u2013500 DAPI\n+\ncells from D8 collectively from 3 biological replicates were counted using ImageJ program, as described previously (\nLiyanage et al., 2013\n).\nTable 2.\nList of primary antibodies used in western blot and immunocytochemistry.\nPrimary antibody\nApplication and dilution\nMolecular weight (kDa)\nDescription\nSource\nMeCP2 (C-terminal)\nWB 1:1000\n72\nMouse monoclonal\nMillipore, 07-013\nBeta (\u03b2) ACTIN\nWB: 1:2500\n42\nMouse monoclonal\nSigma, A2228\nGAPDH\nWB: 1:500\n37\nRabbit polyclonal\nSanta Cruz, Sc-25778\nGFAP\nIF 1:200\nN/A\nMouse monoclonal\nInvitrogen, 421262\nBeta (\u03b2) TUBULIN III (TUB III)\nIF 1:200\nN/A\nMouse monoclonal\nChemicon, MAB1637\nMBP\nIF 1:100\nN/A\nRabbit polyclonal\nAbcam, ab40390\n5mC\nDot blot 1:1000\nN/A\nMouse monoclonal\nAbcam, Ab73938\n5hmC\nDot blot 1:1000\nN/A\nRabbit polyclonal\nActive Motif, 39769\nNESTIN\nIF 1:200\nN/A\nRat polyclonal\nDevelopmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Rat-401c\nKI67\nIF 1:200\nN/A\nRabbit polyclonal\nSc-15402\nOLIG2\nIF 1:200\nN/A\nRabbit polyclonal\nMillipore, AB9610\nRNA Polymerase (Pol) II\nWB 1:1000\n217\nMouse monoclonal\nAbcam, Ab817\nHDAC2\nWB 1:1000\n55\nMouse monoclonal\nAbcam, Ab12169\nAlpha (\u03b1) TUBULIN\nWB 1:1000\n50\nMouse monoclonal\nSigma, T9026\nOpen in a new tab\nTable 3.\nList of secondary antibodies used in western blot and immunocytochemistry.\nSecondary antibody\nApplication and dilution\nSource\nAlexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG\nIF 1:2000 or 1:3000\nInvitrogen, A11017\nAlexa Fluor 594 conjugated goat anti rabbit IgG\nIF 1:2000 or 1:3000\nInvitrogen, A11037\nPeroxidase-AffiniPure Gt anti-mouse IgG\nWB 1:7500, Dot blot 1:7500\nJackson ImmunoResearch 115-035-174\nPeroxidase-AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit IgG\nWB 1:7500, Dot blot 1:7500\nJackson ImmunoResearch 711-035-152\nOpen in a new tab\n\nMeasurement of neurite branching and glial cell surface area\nImmunofluorescence signals for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and \u03b2 Tubulin III (TUB III) were detected by an Axio Observer Z1 inverted microscope and the images were obtained using Zen 2011 (Carl Zeiss). For quantification of the surface area of GFAP\n+\nastrocytes, superimposed Z-stacked images taken at 0.32 \u03bcm sections were analyzed. The surface area of GFAP\n+\nastrocytes was measured using the spline contour tool within Zen 2011 software, as shown in a previous study (\nSchade et al., 2013\n). The signal intensity was adjusted to observe all the cellular processes of GFAP\n+\ncells and the outer margin of each cell was carefully marked using the spline contour tool, which directly provides the area in \u03bcm\n2\n. At least 20 GFAP\n+\nastrocytes per biological replicate (three biological replicates) of control and ethanol-treated cells were measured. For the quantification of number of neurites, at least 20 TUB III\n+\nneurons per biological replicate (three biological replicates) were imaged and neurites were marked and counted in ImageJ program as described in our previous study (\nRastegar et al., 2009\n).\n\nWestern blot (WB)\nWestern blotting was performed as previously described (\nBarber et al., 2013\n;\nRastegar et al., 2000\n;\nWu et al., 2001\n;\nZachariah et al., 2012\n). NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Thermo Scientific) was used to extract nuclear proteins as previously described (\nLiyanage et al., 2013\n;\nOlson et al., 2014\n). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with 10\u201330 \u03bcg of nuclear extracts and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked in 1\u20132% skim milk in Tris buffered saline with Tween (TBST: TBS+ 0.1% Tween) for 1 h at room temperature. All primary antibody incubations were done overnight at 4 \u00b0C. This was followed by three washes with TBST. Subsequently, we incubated the membranes with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Next, membranes were washed with TBST (three times). An enhanced chemiluminescence method was used to develop the membranes. The developing X-ray films were blue in color and they were converted into gray color before quantification and assembly of the figures. Note that the brightness or contrast of the bands was not adjusted. RNA Pol II, HDAC2 (nuclear markers) and \u03b1-TUBULIN (mostly used as cytoplasmic marker), ACTIN and GAPDH were tested to select the best endogenous loading control. ACTIN and GAPDH were chosen to be the most reliable and suitable loading controls (for further details see the Results section). Quantification of WB bands was done with Adobe Photoshop CS5 software and normalized to ACTIN or GAPDH signals as described previously (\nLiyanage et al., 2013\n;\nOlson et al., 2014\n). MeCP2 expression in ethanol-treated samples was compared to the corresponding control untreated cells within the same biological replicate. Note that the exposure times were not the same for different experiments.\n\nDNA dot blot assay for 5mC and 5hmC\nDNA dot blot was performed using a previously described protocol (\nLiyanage et al., 2013\n). Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen) as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For each sample, 250 ng of DNA in 250 \u03bcl final volume was heat denatured in 0.4 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 10 mM ethylenedi-aminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min and neutralized with equal volume of ice-cold 2 M ammonium acetate (pH 7.0) to obtain 500 \u03bcl of final volume. Denatured DNA was loaded onto Zeta-Probe GT blotting membrane (Bio Rad) set up in a dot blot apparatus (Bio Rad). Wells were rinsed with 0.4 M NaOH to keep DNA denatured. The membrane was rinsed with 2\u00d7 saline\u2013sodium citrate (SSC), air-dried and UV cross-linked. Then the membrane was blocked with 3\u20135% skim milk in PBST (PBS+ 0.1% Tween) for 3 h at room temperature followed by incubation in primary antibody [5mC or 5hmC (1:1000) in PBST] at 4 \u00b0C overnight. After three washes with PBST, the membrane was incubated in secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Total DNA levels were detected by staining the same membrane with 0.02% methylene blue (MB) in 0.3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2). Adobe Photoshop was used to quantify dot blot signals.\n\nBisulfite pyrosequencing\nBisulfite pyrosequencing was performed as a service at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada using previously described methods (\nLiyanage et al., 2013\n;\nOlson et al., 2014\n). Genomic DNA was isolated as described using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen) as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Three regions in\nMecp2\npromoter and three regions in\nMecp2\nintron 1 were analyzed, which we have reported to impact\nMecp2\nexpression in differentiating NSC and adult mouse brain (\nLiyanage et al., 2013\n;\nOlson et al., 2014\n). The primers used for pyrosequencing analysis are listed in\nTable 4\n. The control D2 methylation data were extracted from a recent report from our lab (\nLiyanage et al., 2013\n).\nTable 4.\nList of primers used for bisulfite pyrosequencing.\nMecp2\nregions\nSequence\nR1\nFP: 5\u2032-TGGGTTTTATAATTAATGAAGGGTAA-3\u2032\nRP: 5\u2032-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACATTTTACCACAACCCTCTCT-3\u2032\nSP: 5\u2032-AGGTGTAGTAGTATATAGG-3\u2032\nR2\nFP: 5\u2032-AGTTTGGGTTTTATAATTAATGAAGGG-3\u2032\nRR: 5\u2032-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACATTTTACCACAACCCTCTCT-3\u2032\nSR: 5\u2032-AAGGGTAATTTAGATAAAGAGTAAG-3\u2032\nR3\nFP: 5\u2032-GGTGAATTATTTAGTAGGGAGGTTTTAA-3\u2032\nRP: 5\u2032-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACAAAAAAAAAACCAACCCCATTCAACTAC-3\u2032\nSP: 5\u2032-AGTAGGGAGGTTTTAATAG-3\u2032\nR4\nFP: 5\u2032-GTTTTAAAAAGTTTTGGGAAAAGGTGTAGT-3\u2032\nRP: 5\u2032-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACCTAAACCCTAACATCCCAACTACCAT-3\u2032\nSP: 5\u2032-AGTTTAATGGGGATTTTTAATT-3\u2032\nR5\nFP: 5\u2032-AGTAGAAGTTATTATTTGTGGTGTGTAT-3\u2032\nRP: 5\u2032-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACACTATATTACTTCCCAACTCAACTAATT-3\u2032\nSP: 5\u2032-AGAGGTGTAAGGATTTT-3\u2032\nR6\nFP: 5\u2032-GAAGTAGGAAGAATTGAGTTTGAGGATAG-3\u2032\nRP: 5\u2032-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACATCTATACACTACCCACATATAATACC-3\u2032\nSP: 5\u2032-GTTTGAGGATAGTTTGAAT-3\u2032\nOpen in a new tab\nF: Forward PCR primer, R: Reverse PCR primer (Biotinylated), S: Sequencing primer, R: Region.\nReference:\nLiyanage et al.

For hMeDIP with D2 samples, 100 ng per reaction was used (due to the limited amount of the D2 samples), while for all D8 samples 500 ng per reaction was used. For MeDIP, 1 \u03bcg of DNA per reaction was used. The immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by qPCR using the primers specific for each\nMecp2\npromoter or intron 1 region (\nTable 5\n). For each hMeDIP and MeDIP reaction, 2\u20133 qPCR technical replicates from 4 independent biological replicates were done to confirm the results. In order to confirm the specificity of the signals obtained from 5mC and 5hmC antibodies for both hMeDIP and MeDIP experiments, non-immunogenic IgG antibody was used. Quantitative PCR with\nGapdh\nprimers was used as an unmethylated negative control. For hMeDIP, a positive control DNA with 44 5hmC-CpG sites provided within the kit was used as a positive control for immunoprecipitation and was amplified using control primers provided within the kit. For MeDIP, primers specific for\nMajor Satellite Repeats\nwere used as a positive control for methylated DNA. The percentage input for the Ct values obtained from each qPCR was calculated relative to the Ct value of the input DNA used.\nTable 5.\nList of primers used in qPCR for hMeDIP and MeDIP.\nMecp2\nregion\nDirection\nSequence (5\u2032 to 3\u2032)\nReference\nR1\nForward\nCAGGTGCAGCAGCACACAGGC\nDesigned in the lab\nReverse\nCGGACGGGTTTTACCACAGCC\nR2\nForward\nGAACTCCACC AATCCGCAGC\nReverse\nCCTGTGTGCTGCTGCACCTG\nR3\nForward\nCAGGCTCCTCAACAGGCAAC\nReverse\nGGCTGGTTTTGTGGGCAGCA\nR4\nForward\nCTAGCTGAGCTGGGAAGTAAC\nReverse\nGAGCTGGTCTACAGAAGCAAG\nR5\nForward\nCTGTATAGTGTGGTGGAAGAAG\nReverse\nGTTACTTCCCAGCTCAGCTAG\nR6\nForward\nGAGTTTGAGGACAGCCTGAAC\nReverse\nCTACCCACATGTAGTGCCTGC\nOpen in a new tab\nR: Region.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism software and represent average of two to four independent experiments.

    "Methods": "Surgical procedures for traumatic brain injury\nAll procedures and protocols were approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Young adult male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats weighed 250\u2013300 g (Harlen Laboratories, IN) were housed for 7 days prior to experimentation to allow them to acclimate to the environment. All animals were maintained in a temperature-controlled vivarium room with free access to food and water. The surgical and controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury procedures have been described in detail previously (\nSullivan et al., 1999\n). Briefly, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (4%) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf, Tujunga, CA) prior to brain surgery. Isoflurane (2.5%) was delivered via a nose cone throughout the surgical procedure. Using sterile procedures, the skin was retracted and a 6-mm craniotomy was made lateral to the sagittal suture and centered between bregma and lambda. The skull-cap was carefully removed without disruption of the underlying dura. The exposed brain was then injured using a pneumatically controlled impacting device consisting of a 5 mm diameter rod tip that compressed the cortex at 3.5 m/s velocity to a depth of 2.0 mm. The use of these injury parameters results in a severe injury to the cortex overlying the hippocampal formation (\nBaldwin et al., 1997\n;\nDavis et al., 2008\n;\nGilmer et al., 2009\n). Following CCI, the Surgicel (Johnson and Johnson) was laid over the dura and the skull-cap was replaced. A thin coat of dental acrylica was then spread over the craniotomy site and allowed it to dry before closing the overlying skin with surgical staples. The core body temperatures of the animals were maintained at 37 \u00b0C throughout the surgical procedures and recovery period.\nAt 12 hr post-injury, animals were euthanatized with CO\n2\nand the hippocampus from both the injured and na\u00efve animals (n=5 animals per group) were rapidly removed. Any potential effect of a unilateral CCI on miRNA changes in the contralateral hippocampus has not been investigated. Therefore, the hippocampi from na\u00efve, uninjured animals were used to obtain control tissue.\n\nIsolation of mitochondria\nFor studies examining miRNA expression, the nuclear (P\n1\n), cytosolic (S\n2\n) and purified total mitochondria (MT) fractions were isolated from rat hippocampus according to a previously published ficoll density gradient procedure (\nPandya et al., 2009\n). Briefly, tissue homogenates were prepared in ice-cold mitochondrial isolation buffer (215 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA; pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH), followed by centrifugation two times at 1,300\ng\nfor 3 min to obtain P\n1\n. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000\ng\nfor 10 min to obtain crude mitochondrial pellets (P\n2\n) and the supernatant was saved as S\n2\n. The P\n2\npellets were re-suspended in isolation buffer and placed in a nitrogen cell disruption chamber (1200 psi, 10 min, at 4 \u00b0C) to rupture and release synaptosomal mitochondria (\nBrown et al., 2004\n). This fraction was further purified using a discontinuous ficoll gradient (7.5% layered over 10% ficoll) and centrifugation at 100,000\ng\n(in SW 55Ti rotors) at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. The resulting MT pellet was washed and centrifuged at 10,000\ng\nat 4 \u00b0C for 10 min in mitochondrial isolation buffer without EGTA and finally resuspended to achieve a concentration of ~10 mg/ml in mitochondrial isolation buffer without EGTA for the miRNA expression studies. The protein content of the above listed fractions was analyzed using BCA protein assay kit.\n\nIsolation of mitochondrial sub-fractions from ficoll-purified mitochondria\nA mitochondria (MT) fraction was obtained from adult na\u00efve rat brain as described above, and further processed to generate mitochondrial sub-fractions according to a previously published method (\nAtorino et al., 2003\n) with slight modifications. Briefly, 5 mg of MT was subjected to hypotonic swelling in 1.5 ml of 5 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4 for 20 min on ice to rupture the outer mitochondrial membrane. The solution was then centrifuged at 1900\ng\nat 4 \u00b0C for 15 min to obtain a mitoplast pellet (MP) and mitochondrial supernatant (MS) containing broken outer mitochondrial membrane and inter-membrane space (IMS) compartments. The MS fraction was then sonicated (10 seconds X 3 times) and centrifuged 35,000\ng\n(utilizing SW 55Ti rotors) further at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min to pellet down the outer membrane (OM), with the resulting supernatant containing only the inter-membrane space (IMS) of mitochondria. The dense MP pellets were re-suspended in 250 \u03bcl of ice-cold isolation buffer, sonicated (10 seconds X 3 times) and further centrifuged at 100,000\ng\n(utilizing SW 55Ti rotors) at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. The resultant membrane-enriched pellet contained the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) and the resulting supernatant contained the mitochondrial matrix (MTX) fractions. The protein content of the mitochondrial sub-fractions was determined using BCA protein assay.\n\nWestern Blot Procedure\nThe purity of the mitochondria samples as well as identification of miRNA machinery proteins in the sub-mitochondrial fractions were analyzed using standard Western blotting techniques. Briefly, a total of 15 \u03bcg of protein was resolved according to molecular weight by SDS\u2013PAGE using either Criterion 4\u201320% Tris\u2013HCl (10\u2013250 kD) or Criterion 3\u20138% Tri-acetate (25\u2013250 kD) gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The gels were transblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for an hour, and then incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight with the primary antibody of interest. The primary antibodies used included anti-Dicer mAb (1:500 dilution; cat # sc-136979; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Histone 3 rabbit mAb (H3; 1:25,000 dilution; cat # 4499; Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), anti-pyruvate dehydrogenase rabbit mAb (PDH; 1:10,000 dilution; cat # 3205; Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), anti-voltage-dependent anion channel rabbit polyAb (VDAC; 1:10,000 dilution; cat # PA1-954A; Thermo Scientific Inc.), anti-complex IV mAb (CoxIV; 1:200,000 dilution; Cat # A21348; Life Technologies Inc.), anti-beta tubulin rabbit polyAb (1:100,000 dilution; cat # ab6046; Abcam Inc.), anti-beta actin mAb (1:75,000 dilution; cat # A5316; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-CD45 rabbit polyAb (1:2,000 dilution; cat # ab10558; Abcam Inc.), anti-iNOS (1:10,000 dilution; cat # 610332; BD Transduction Laboratories), and anti-Argonaute 2 mAb (2A8; 1:1000 dilution). The 2A8 Ago2 antibody has been described previously (\nNelson et al., 2007\n). Peroxidase-conjugated affinipure secondary antibodies included goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG (cat # 115-035-166 and 111-035-144, respectively; Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories, Inc.).\n\nPrimary rat brain cell culture\nPrimary cortical neuronal, astrocyte and microglial cultures were generated from Sprague\u2013Dawley rat pups at E18 as described previously (\nWang et al., 2014\n).\n\nRNA isolation from mitochondria and cytosol\nTotal RNA isolation using TRIZOL LS reagent (Life Technologies, USA) from cytosolic fractions followed the modified procedure described previously (\nNelson et al., 2008b\n;\nWang et al., 2008a\n). Total mitochondrial RNA isolation employed the same procedure with minor modifications (double extraction) to accommodate RNA isolation from limited sample quantity. Briefly, mitochondria were lysed in 250 \u03bcl RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) in the presence of protease inhibitors (Pierce, cat. # 78439) and RNasin (0.2 U/\u03bcl, Promega, cat. # N2615). TRIZOL LS was then added to the mitochondria lysate. After chloroform extraction and centrifugation, a 450-\u03bcl clear aqua-phase supernatant was saved. The remaining 150\u2013200 \u03bcl supernatant (which may contain some protein interface) was collected separately, and was brought up to 250 \u03bcl using RIPA buffer. This supernatant was then subjected to a second round of TRIZOL LS extraction following the same procedure. The aqua-phase supernatants from both extractions were combined, and total RNA precipitated using iso-propanol with glycogen (Roche, cat. # 10901393001) as carrier. Isolated RNA concentrations were quantified using NanoDrop1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.).\n\nTaqMan\u00ae miRNA RT-qPCR array\nTotal RNA isolated from mitochondria and cytosol of each hippocampal tissue was subjected to TaqMan\u00ae miRNA RT-qPCR array using Rodent Card A (Life Technologies). Because of the relatively low levels of mitochondrial RNA and the benefit of uniformity, a preamplification step using Megaplex\n\u2122\nPreAmp Primers (Life Technologies) was carried out to enhance the detection ability for low-expression miRNAs. TaqMan\u00ae miRNA RT-qPCR array was performed as described previously (\nWang et al., 2014\n). Briefly, equal amount of total RNA (50 ng) was reverse transcribed using the TaqMan\u00ae MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit with Megaplex\n\u2122\nPrimer Pools, Rodent Pool A (Life Technologies). The resulting cDNA was pre-amplified using Megaplex\n\u2122\nPreAmp Primers, Rodent Pool A (Life Technologies) before performing RT-qPCR Array. PCR was carried out on the ViiA\n\u2122\n7 Real-Time PCR System and qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) raw data processed with ViiA 7 RUO software (Life Technologies).\n\nTaqMan\u00ae single-tube miRNA RT-qPCR\nIndividual miRNA was subjected to single-tube TaqMan\u00ae assay (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. TaqMan\u00ae assays were designed to follow MIQE (Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments) guidelines (\nBustin et al., 2009\n). An equal quantity (10\u201350 ng) of RNA was used in the TaqMan\u00ae assays. All single-tube TaqMan\u00ae assays were performed without a pre-amplification except for the evaluation of miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, and miR-146a, in which the pre-amplification step was performed as in the array assays. A total of 3-5 biological replicates with 3 technical triplicates were performed for individual experiments.\n\nData analysis\nRaw PCR Ct values were first determined using ViiA 7 RUO software (Life Technologies) with the same parameter settings across all samples (threshold set at 0.15 with automatic baseline). Data corresponding to failed QC as determined by ViiA 7 RUO software were excluded from the analysis. In addition, miRNAs with a PCR Ct value >35 were considered as undetectable. DataAssist\u00ae software (Life Technologies) was then used to analyze miRNA array data. Different array data from cytosol and mitochondria fractions were normalized separately. The Global Mean Normalization method (\nMestdagh et al., 2009\n) was applied to normalize the pooled dataset of both Na\u00efve and TBI. The Ct values presented in this report, including the\nSupplemental data\n, are normalized data. The miRNA expression levels between treatments (TBI\nvs\nNa\u00efve) or mitochondria versus cytosol fractions from na\u00efve rat brain samples were expressed as fold changes using the following equation: fold change=2^\n\u2212(Ct\nTBI\n\u2212 Ct\nNaive\n)\n, or fold change=2^\n\u2212(Ct\nMito\n\u2212 Ct\nCyto\n)\n, and were evaluated using an unpaired Student\nt\n-test. Benjamini-Hochberg or permutation tests were used to control False Discovery Rate (FDR), and all significant data points (\np\n<0.05) had a FDR< 5%. The data from the TaqMan\u00ae single-tube miRNA RT-qPCR assays were compared using unpaired student\nt\n-tests with a\np\n<0.05 considered as statistically significant."

Investigators were blinded to genotype information in all experiments. Protocols were approved by the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Animal Research.\n\nIsolation of DRG neurons\nAdult mice were decapitated after anesthesia. L4-6 DRGs were removed and treated with collagenase (type IA, 1.5 mg/ml, Sigma) and trypsin (1 mg/ml, Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. DRGs were then washed five times and gently triturated using fine fire-polished glass pipettes. Dissociated DRG neurons were plated onto poly-D-lysine (100 \u03bcg/mL) and laminin (5 \u03bcg/mL) -coated coverslips. For electroporation; cells from 15-20, 8-to-10-week-old age-matched AQP1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice were centrifuged at room temperature for 5 min at 800 rpm. 3\u00d710\n5\ncells per 20 \u03bcl and 2 \u03bcg plasmid were electroporated using the Neon Transfection System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the suggested protocol.

After application of silicone grease (Dow Corning, Midland, MI), a Camp-10 Teflon divider (Tyler Research, Alberta, Canada) was seated into a collagen-coated 35-mm diameter tissue culture dish (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Before setting the divider, the collagen in the middle region of the dish was scraped with a pin rake to allow axon growth on the collagen between the scratches. One drop of medium containing 1% methylcellulose was placed in the scratched region to prevent the silicone grease from adhering to the collagen to allow axon growth under the silicon grease barrier without flow or diffusion of medium between compartments. The integrity of the seal was checked by filling the side compartments with medium and incubating the chambers at 37\u00b0 overnight; only cultures without leakage were used for experiments (\nTsui-Pierchala and Ginty, 1999\n). Dissociated DRG neurons (50,000/chamber) were plated in the middle compartment and maintained in 100 ng/mL NGF; after 3 days, 1 or 10 ng/mL recombinant NGF (2.5S, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was added to the side compartment, and NGF concentration in the middle compartment was reduced to 1 ng/mL. After 7 days many axons had sprouted in the side compartment.\n\nExplant cultures\nSensory ganglia were removed from adult wildtype or AQP1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice, and the dorsal and peripheral roots were carefully trimmed and whole ganglia were cultured in a shallow layer of Matrigel (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) (\nTonge et al., 1998\n) in multi-well plates containing 0.5 ml of RPMI medium and 50 ng/ml NGF. After 3 days in culture preparations were fixed with formaldehyde in PBS for 1 h. Axonal outgrowth was measured using Scion Image following immunofluorescence with the neurofilament marker Tuj1 (1:500, Millipore) and Alexa 555-conjugated secondary antibody. The longest axons growing from the cut ends of the peripheral nerves were quantified.\n\nSciatic nerve crush injury\nMice were anesthetized using 2.5% isoflurane and the skin was shaved. Under aseptic conditions a small incision was made on the skin at the mid-thigh level, followed by a small incision between the gluteus superficialis and biceps femoris muscles to expose the left sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve was carefully separated from surrounding connective tissue and then crushed by a 15-s compression with a pair of fine Dumon #5 forceps (Fine Science Tools, Foster city, CA). Mice were monitored for 7 d after the injury (\nBauder and Ferguson, 2012\n).\n\nDRG cell line culture\nND7/23 DRG neuroblastoma cells (\nWood et al., 1990\n) were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine at 37 \u00b0C in humidified air with 5% CO\n2\n. In some studies cells were stably transfected with cDNA encoding human AQP1, AQP4, GFP-GPI or AQP1 C189F using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. AQP1 stably transfected cells were selected with 200 \u03bcg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). To initiate differentiation, cells were incubated in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS, 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP and 100 ng/mL NGF (\nRoobol et al., 1995\n;\nWu et al., 2008\n). Cells were fixed 2 days after differentiation.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and DRGs were postfixed for 24 h in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed in paraffin. DRG and sciatic nerve specimens of the control and injured sides from the same mouse were processed together. Sections (7 \u03bcm) were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded ethanol. Epitope retrieval was done with citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6, 30 min, 95-100 \u00b0C). Staining was also done on isolated cells that were seeded onto 12-mm diameter coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100, samples were incubated with rabbit anti-AQP1 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-AQP4 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc) or chicken anti-peripherin (1: 200, Millipore) antibody, followed by Alexa 488 or 555 conjugated secondary antibody. Nuclei were counterstained blue with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).\n\nNeurite outgrowth assay\nNeurite outgrowth was assayed in DRG neurons and differentiated ND7/23 cells. Neurons with processes were defined and neurite length measured using the NeuroJ plug-in of NIH ImageJ software (\nMeijering et al., 2004\n). The longest process of individual neurons in each replicate was measured and averaged.\n\nQuantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR\nL4-6 DRGs (in control and sciatic nerve crush studies) were collected after euthanasia, total RNA was isolated by a PureLinkTM Micro-to-midi kit (Invitrogen), and cDNA was reverse-transcribed from mRNA with the Super-Script First Strand Synthesis System for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). Fluorescence-based quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR was carried out using the LightCycler 480 and with LightCycler FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics). Primers were as follows: 5\u2032-TGTATGCCTCTGGTCGTACC-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-CAGGTCCAGACGCAGGATG-3\u2032 (antisense) for GAPDH; 5\u2032-CTCAACTACATGGTCTACATGTTCCA-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032- CCATTTCGGCCTTGACTGT-3\u2032 (antisense) for AQP1, 5\u2032-CAGGAAAGATCCCAAGTCCA-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-GAACGGAACATTGCACACAC-3\u2032 (antisense) for GAP-43. Data were analyzed by LightCycler software 4.0 (Roche Diagnostics) and reported as calibrated ratios normalized to GAPDH. Data were averaged from six mice."

    "Methods": "Animal experimentation\nAll animals used in the present study were housed in the UB Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine vivarium, and procedures were approved by UB\u2019s Animal Care and Use Committee, and conducted in accordance with the guidelines in \u201cGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\u201d from the National Institutes of Health.\n\nPrimary cultures of cortical OPCs\nPrimary cultures of cortical OPCs were prepared as described by\nAmur-Umarjee et al. (1993)\n. First, cerebral hemispheres from 1 day old mice were mechanically dissociated and were plated on poly-D-lysine-coated flasks in Dulbecco\u00b4s modified Eagle\u00b4s medium and Ham\u00b4s F12 (1:1 v/v) (Invitrogen), containing 100\u00b5g/ml gentamycin and supplemented with 4mg/ml dextrose anhydrous, 3.75mg/ml HEPES buffer, 2.4mg/ml sodium bicarbonate and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Omega Scientific). After 24 hours the medium was changed and the cells were grown in DMEM/F12 supplemented with insulin (5\u00b5g/ml), human transferrin (50\u00b5g/ml), sodium selenite (30nM), d-Biotin (10mM), 0.1% BSA (Sigma), 1% FBS (Omega Scientific) and 1% horse serum (Omega Scientific). After 9 days, OPCs were purified from the mixed glial culture by the differential shaking and adhesion procedure of\nSuzumura et al., (1984)\nand allowed to grow on poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips in defined culture media (\nAgresti et al., 1996\n) plus PDGF (10ng/ml) and bFGF (10ng/ml) (Peprotech). OPCs were kept in mitogens (PDGF and bFGF) for 2 days and then induced to exit from the cell cycle and differentiate by switching the cells to a mitogen-free medium (mN2) (\nOh et al., 2003\n) (\nFigure 1A\n).\nmN2\n: DMEM/F12 supplemented with d-glucose (4.5gm/l), insulin (5\u00b5g/ml), human transferrin (50\u00b5g/ml), sodium selenite (30nM), T\n3\n(15nM), d-Biotin (10mM), hydrocortisone (10nM), 0.1% BSA, 1% horse serum and 1% FBS.\nFIGURE 1. L-type VOCC activation stimulates OPC maturation.\nOpen in a new tab\n(\nA\n) One day after plating, OPCs were treated with high K\n+\nand the L-type VOCC inhibitor verapamil. Verapamil (5\u00b5M) was added to the culture media for three consecutive days and high K\n+\n(20mM) was applied in five consecutive pulses (5min/each) distributed during the first 5h of the second day in vitro. (\nB\u2013C\n) After treatment OPCs were stained with antibodies against Olig1, NG2, MBP, MOG and CC1 and the percentage of positive cells in each experimental condition was examined by confocal microscopy. Scale bar = 60\u00b5m (Olig1, MOG, CC1); 80\u00b5m (NG2, MBP). (\nD\n) Morphological complexity of MBP-positive cells was scored in four categories.

Briefly, 6pmol of each siRNA duplex were mixed with Lipofectamine\u2122 RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) and the mixture was added to 35mm Petri dishes containing 80% confluent OPCs. After transfection OPCs were further cultured for 24h in defined culture media (\nAgresti et al., 1996\n) plus PDGF (10ng/ml) and bFGF (10ng/ml) and then the cells were switched to a mitogen-free medium (mN2) to induce differentiation (\nOh et al., 2003\n) (\nFigure 2A\n). Control cells were transfected with siRNA designed to minimize sequence homology to any known vertebrate transcript and with a similar GC content as our siRNAs. Additionally, following the transfection protocol described above, OPCs were treated with fluorescein-labeled dsRNA oligomers (BLOCK-iT\u2122 Fluorescent Oligos, Invitrogen) to determine siRNA transfection efficiency.\nTable I.\nSequences of Stealth RNAi\u2122 siRNA duplexes used for Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 knockdown.\nsiRNA Duplex Oligoribonucleotides Sequence\nCav1.2\nsiRNA1\nGCCAUGAAUAUACUCAACAUGCUUU\nAAAGCAUGUUGAGUAUAUUCAUGGC\nsiRNA2\nUGAUGUCAUUCUCAGUGAGACUAAU\nAUUAGUCUCACUGAGAAUGACAUCA\nsiRNA3\nAGGCAGCAUGGAAGCUCAGCUCUAA\nUUAGAGCUGAGCUUCCAUGCUGCCU\nCav1.3\nsiRNA1\nGCCAUGAGAGAUAACAACCAGAUCA\nUGAUCUGGUUGUUAUCUCUCAUGGC\nsiRNA2\nCCUCCAGCUGGUGAUGAUGAGGUAA\nUUACCUCAUCAUCACCAGCUGGAGG\nsiRNA3\nCGUAUGGACUGUUGCUGCAUCCUAA\nUUAGGAUGCAGCAACAGUCCAUACG\nOpen in a new tab\nFIGURE 2. siRNA knockdown of L-type VOCCs in OPCs.\nOpen in a new tab\n(\nA\n) One day after plating, OPCs were transfected with a combination of three different siRNA duplexes specific for Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 (siCav1.2/1.3). After transfection OPCs were further cultured for 24h in defined culture media plus PDGF and bFGF and then induced to exit from the cell cycle and differentiate by switching the cells to a mitogen-free medium (mN2). (\nB\n) OPCs were treated with fluorescein-labeled dsRNA oligomers to determine siRNA transfection efficiency. 24h after transfection the cells were stained with antibodies against NG2 and Olig2. Scale bar = 80\u00b5m. (\nC\n) 72h after siRNA transfection semi-quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis of Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 expression in OPCs was performed using \u03b2-actin as internal standard. Data from three independent experiments are summarized based on the relative spot intensities and plotted as percent of controls. (\nD\n) 72h after siRNA transfection VOCC activity was examined in cultured OPCs using Fura-2 as intracellular Ca\n++\nindicator. Note that each trace corresponds to a single cell and the horizontal bars indicate the time of addition of external solution containing high K\n+\n. (\nE\n) The bar graph shows the average amplitude of the Ca\n++\nresponse, calculated from the responding cells expressed as a percentage of change of the emission intensities.

Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM of at least six independent experiments. *p<0.05, ***p<0.001 vs. control.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nCells were stained with antibodies against several oligodendrocyte markers and examined by confocal microscopy. Briefly, the cells were rinsed in PBS and fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde for 30min at room temperature. After rinsing in PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10min at room temperature and then processed for immunocytochemistry following the protocol as outlined by\nReyes et al., (2002)\n. Essentially, fixed cells were incubated in a blocking solution (5% goat serum in PBS) followed by an overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibody. Cells were then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies (1:200; Jackson), nuclei were stained with the fluorescent dye DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Invitrogen), mounted onto slides with Aquamount (Lerner Laboratories), and fluorescent images were obtained using an Olympus spinning disc confocal microscope (Olympus, IX83-DSU). Quantitative analysis of the results was done counting the antigen-positive and DAPI-positive cells (total number of cells) in 20 randomly selected fields, which resulted in counts of >2,000 cells for each experimental condition. The primary antibodies used for immunocytochemistry were against: CC1 (1:300; Calbiochem), MBP (1:1000; Covance), MOG (1:200; Millipore), NG2 (1:400; Millipore), neurofilament M (1:250; Millipore), Olig1 (1:500; Millipore), Olig2 (1:500; Millipore), PDGFr (1:200; Millipore), phospho-histone H3 (1:500; Millipore) and PLP (1:200; Thermo Scientific).\n\nIncorporation of bromo-deoxyuridine\nTwenty-four hour pulses of 10\u00b5M bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (BD Pharmingen) were applied at 24, 48 and 72h post siRNA transfection (\nFigure 5A\n). After each BrdU pulse, cells were fixed and immunostained in order to determine the number of positive cells. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After treatment with 6N HCl and 1% Triton X-100 to denature nuclear DNA, the cells were incubated in 0.1M sodium borate (in PBS and 1% Triton X-100) for 10min. Immunocytochemistry was done using anti-BrdU antibody (1:1000; BD Pharmingen) and anti-NG2 (1:400; Millipore) with the corresponding fluorescent secondary antibodies. The percentage of BrdU positive cells was estimated on the basis of the total number of NG2 positive cells.\nFIGURE 5. Decreased cell division in OPCs lacking Cav1.2.\nOpen in a new tab\n(\nA\n) OPCs were transfected with siRNA duplexes specific for Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 (siCav1.2/1.3) and grown either in the presence or absence of PDGF. 24h pulses of BrdU were begun at 24h, 48h and 72h after siRNA transfection. After each BrdU pulse, cells were fixed and immunostained with anti-BrdU and anti-NG2 antibodies. (\nB\u2013C\n) Microphotographs showing NG2\n+\n/BrdU\n+\nand P-Histone H3\n+\ncells grown in mN2 at different time points after siRNA transfection. Arrows indicate P-Histone H3\n+\ncells.

Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM of four independent experiments. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 vs. respective controls.\n\nCell cycle time analysis\nTo examine cell cycle time, primary cultures of GFP labeled OPCs were used (\nMallon et al., 2002\n). These cultures were incubated in a stage top chamber with 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C, which was placed on the stage of a spinning disc confocal inverted microscope (Olympus, IX83-DSU) equipped with a motorized stage and an atmosphere regulator. Fluorescent images were obtained at 6min intervals. Individual clones of mouse OPCs were followed for a period of 30h. In these time-lapse experiments, ~20 clones were analyzed per experimental condition. MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) was used in the analysis of video microscopic image sequences. The MetaMorph software allows an investigator to cycle back-and-forth through the movie files frame-by-frame (minute-by-minute), facilitating the accurate determination of event time. To quantitatively analyze the dynamics of cell division, 120 cytokinetic events were randomly selected from movies at different time points. Cell proliferation was assessed by calculating the average cell cycle time (time between birth cytokinesis and division cytokinesis) in different OPC clones. Tracking of cells was performed by visual observation of image sequences as described above. Tracking was performed forwards and backwards in time from each identified cytokinesis event to maximize the number of lineally related cytokinetic events identified. Furthermore, the percentage of cycling OPCs during the first 12h of the time-lapse experiment was performed by visual observation.\n\nCaspase-3 assay\nNucView 488 Caspase-3 substrate, a cell membrane-permeable fluorogenic caspase substrate designed for detecting caspase-3 activity within live cells in real time, was used in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (Biotium Inc). Briefly, OPC primary cultures were incubated in medium containing NucView 488 Caspase-3 substrate (final concentration 5\u00b5M) in a stage top chamber with 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C, which was placed on the stage of a spinning disc confocal inverted microscope (Olympus, IX83-DSU). Fluorescent field images were obtained with a specific GFP filter at 6min intervals for a total of 24 hours. MetaMorph software was used to assess apoptotic cell death by calculating the percentage of Caspase-3 positive cells in a total of five experiments on four random fields.\n\nMTT assay\nThe MTT survival assay was performed as described by\nMosmann (1983)\n. The sterile solution of MTT (Molecular Probes) was added to all wells and the micro plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 45min. The reaction was stopped by addition of SDS and the product was quantified by spectrophotometry at 570nm.\n\nCo-culture of cortical neurons and OPCs\nCortical neurons were prepared from the brains of 1- to 2-day-old mouse pups using established procedures (\nEcheverria et al., 2005\n) with minor modifications. Briefly, brains were removed aseptically and placed into DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen). After the brains were dissected, the blood vessels and meninges were carefully removed under a dissecting microscope. Brain cortices were isolated and dissociated by digestion with a solution of 0.05% trypsin (Sigma) containing DNase I (0.06%) in Neurobasal medium for 10min at 37\u00b0C. The digestion reaction was stopped with Neurobasal medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific) and triturated by repeated passages (20 times) through a 10ml pipette. The cell suspension was filtered through a sterile cell strainer (70\u00b5m; BD Biosciences) into a 50ml centrifuge tube. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 200g for 5min, and resuspended in Neurobasal medium plus 2% (v/v) B27 supplemented with 0.25mM GlutaMax I (Invitrogen), 0.25mM glutamine (Invitrogen), and 100\u00b5g/ml gentamicin (Omega Scientific). High-density cultures (5\u00d710\n5\ncells, ~2500 cells/mm\n2\n) were plated onto 20mm\n2\ntissue culture wells coated with poly-D-lysine (Sigma). The neurons were kept at 37\u00b0C in 95% air 5% CO2 for 7 days in vitro and used for co-cultures. After 7 days in vitro, cortical neuron cultures consisted of neurons essentially free from non-neural cells. Co-cultures were prepared by the addition of OPCs to the cultures of cortical neurons at a density of 3\u00d710\n5\ncells/ml. These cultures were maintained in DMEM/F12, 1% FBS for 7 and 14 days.\n\nCell morphology assessment\nOligodendroglial cell morphology was evaluated using the procedure described by\nSperber and McMorris (2001)\nwith slight modifications. Individual MBP-positive cells were scored according to their morphological complexity in four categories, based on the length and number of primary processes, whether the processes were radially distributed, the relative development of secondary and tertiary processes, and the overall size of the cell, including the process arbor.\n\nRT-PCR\nTotal RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. RNA content was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 260nm and the purity was assessed by measuring the ratio of absorbance: 260/280nm. PCR primers for Cav1.2 (F-CAGCTCATGCCAACATGAAT, R-TGCTTCTTGGGTTTCCCATA) and for Cav1.3 (F-AATGGCACGGAATGTAGGAG, R-GACGAAAAATGAGCCAAGGA) were designed based on published sequences by\nRosati et al., (2011)\nand\nXu et al., (2007)\nrespectively. First-strand cDNA was prepared from 1\u00b5g of total RNA using SuperScriptTM III RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 1\u00b5g of oligo(dT). The mRNA samples were denaturated at 65\u00b0C for 5min. Reverse transcription was performed at 50\u00b0C for 55min and was stopped by heating the samples at 85\u00b0C for 5min. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using the Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 isoform-specific primers listed above and PCR Platinum Supermix reagent (Invitrogen). PCR conditions were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 2min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30s, 58\u00b0C for 30s followed by 68\u00b0C for 2min. After completion of the 40 cycles, samples were incubated at 72\u00b0C for 10min. A \u03b2-actin positive control was run alongside the experimental samples, as well as a negative control with no reverse transcriptase. The PCR products were visualized on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel and the bands digitized using a Gel Doc\u2122 EZ System (BioRad).\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR\nTotal RNA was extracted from primary cultures of pure oligodendroglial cells and co-cultures of OPCs with cortical neurons using TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Samples were further purified by treatment with TURBO DNA-free\u2122 (Ambion), followed by a second extraction with phenol-chloroform. RNA was reverse transcribed using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad) then analyzed for various transcript expressions. qPCR was set up using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad) and performed in triplicate as previously described (\nGhiani et al., 2006\n) on an iCycler MyiQ Real Time PCR machine (BioRad). Negative controls (samples in which reverse transcriptase was omitted) were amplified individually using the same primer sets to ensure the absence of genomic DNA contamination. PCR amplification resulted in the generation of single bands. Amplification specificity was assessed by melting curves and standard curves made from serial dilutions of control RNA and were used for quantification. Data were normalized to the internal control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Primers used for real-time PCR were designed based on published sequences by\nMattan et al., (2010)\n,\nLi et al., (2008)\nand\nConrad et al., (2009)\n(see\nTable II\nfor primer sequences).\nTable II.\nSequences of primers used for real-time PCR\nGene\nForward\nReverse\nPDGFr\n5\u2019-TCTCACTGAGATCACCACCGA\n5\u2019-CGCTGTCTTCTTCCTTAGCC\nMAG\n5\u2019-GGTGTTGAGGGAGGCAGTTG\n5\u2019-CGTTGTCTGCTAGGCAAGCA\nCGT\n5\u2019-TGCCAACGTATCCTTCTTCC\n5\u2019-CATTGTCCCATGTCAAGCAC\nCNPase\n5\u2019-AACCAATGGCAGCTGTCG\n5\u2019-TCAGGAACCAGCCAAAGTAAA\nPLP\n5\u2019-CCCACCCCTCTCCGCTAGTT\n5\u2019-CAGGAAAAAAAGCACCATTGTG\nMBP\n5\u2019-CATTACTTAGTGCCAATTAGGTTC\n5\u2019-GTCAGTCGTCTTGTTACTCTAC\nGAPDH\n5\u2019-ACTCCACTCACGGCAAATTC\n5\u2019-TCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGACA\nOpen in a new tab\n\nWestern blot analysis\nTotal protein was collected from primary cultures of pure oligodendroglial cells and co-cultures of OPCs with cortical neurons. The final protein pellet was homogenized in lysis buffer containing 50mM Tris-HCl, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1mM sodium vanadate, 1mM AEBSF, 10ug/ml aprotinin, 10ug/ml leupeptin, 10ug/ml pepstatin, and 4uM sodium fluoride. Western blots were performed as previously described (\nGhiani et al., 2010\n). Twenty-five to thirty-five micrograms of total protein was loaded onto a 4\u201320% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen). Protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence using the Amersham ECL kit (GE Healthcare) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling). Relative intensities of the protein bands were quantified by scanning densitometry using the NIH Image Software Image J. Equal protein loading was verified by Ponceau S solution (Sigma) reversible staining of the blots and each extract was also analyzed for relative protein levels of P84, GAPDH and \u03b2-actin. The primary antibodies used for Western blots were against: Cav1.2 (1:1000; Alomone), Cav1.3 (1:1000; Alomone), GAPDH (1:10000; Genetex), MBP (1:1000; Covance), NG2 (1:400; Millipore), P84 (1:6000; Genetex), PLP (1:1000, Thermo Scientific), Tuj1 (1:3000; Covance), CNPase (1:1000; Millipore), MOG (1:1000; Millipore) and \u03b2-actin (1:10000; Sigma).\n\nCalcium imaging\nMethods were similar to those described previously (\nPaez et al., 2007\n). Briefly, primary cultures of OPCs were washed in serum and phenol red-free DMEM containing a final concentration of 4\u00b5M Fura-2 (AM) (TefLabs) plus 0.08% Pluronic F127 (Molecular Probes) to load dye into the cells, incubated for 45 min at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\n, then washed four times in DMEM and stored in DMEM for 10min before being imaged. Resting Ca\n++\nlevels were measured in serum-free HBSS containing 2mM Ca\n++\nbut no Mg\n++\n. Other measurements were made in HBSS. Calcium influx and resting Ca\n++\nlevels were measured on individual cells, and the results were pooled from five separate experiments for each condition. The fluorescence of Fura-2 was excited alternatively at wavelengths of 340 and 380nm by means of a high-speed wavelength-switching device (Lambda DG4; Sutter Instruments). A spinning disc confocal inverted microscope (Olympus, IX83-DSU) equipped with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-R2) measured the fluorescence. Image analysis software (MetaFluor, Molecular Devices) allowed for the selection of several \u201cregions of interest\u201d within the field from which measurements are taken. To minimize bleaching, the intensity of excitation light and sampling frequency was kept as low as possible. In these experiments, measurements were made once every 2s.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nNormal distributions were tested in each data set using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. For data with normal distributions, single between-group comparisons were made by the Student paired t-test, and multiple comparisons were investigated by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni\u2019s multiple comparison tests to detect pair-wise between-group differences. All statistical tests were performed in Graphpad Prism (Graphpad Software). A fixed value of p<0.05 for one tailed tests was the criterion for reliable differences between groups. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM unless otherwise noted."

    "Methods": "Patients, therapeutic plasma exchange, and preparation of IgG fractions\nAll four NMO patients from whom plasma exchange material was available fulfilled the revised diagnostic criteria for NMO (\nWingerchuk et al., 2006\n) and had positive serum titers of ABs against AQP4. Human NMO immunoglobulin G (NMO1-4) was purified from plasma filtrates as described previously (\nBuchwald et al., 2002\n) and from disease-control patients with chronic demyelinating inflammatory polyneuropathy who were negative for anti-AQP4 reactivity (control IgG). Purified IgG from one patient (NMO3) was previously utilized and described in another study (\nBradl et al., 2009\n). All IgG fractions were dialyzed against distilled water, freeze dried and stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C. Lyophilized IgG was dissolved in normal saline just before use (100 mg/ml concentration for NMO1, 2, and 4, and control IgG 1 and 2; 12 mg/ml for NMO3). Titers of anti-AQP4 ABs were then measured at a 1 mg/ml concentration by a commercial indirect immunofluorescence test with AQP4 transfected HEK 293 cells (Euroimmun L\u00fcbeck, Germany). All purified NMO IgG fractions displayed a strongly positive anti-AQP4 binding pattern (titers \u22651:100).\n\nRecombinant patient antibodies\nPurified human recombinant IgG ABs were generated as previously described (\nBennett et al., 2009\n). Recombinant antibodies rAB\nAQP4\nand rAB\ncontr2\nwere generated from plasmablast clones recovered from a NMO patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). rAB\ncontr2\nis specific for human AQP4 but does not bind rat AQP4 (\nBennett et al., 2009\n). rAB\ncontr1\nis an isotype-matched control human recombinant AB specific for measles virus nucleocapsid protein (\nBennett et al., 2009\n).\n\nAnimals, surgery, and intrathecal injections\nA total of 112 female Lewis rats were included in the experiments reported here. Adult rats (8\u201310 weeks old) were purchased from Harlan-Winkelmann (Borchen, Germany). All experiments were approved by the Bavarian and Thuringian State authorities. Intrathecal (i.th.) catheters (0.61-mm outer diameter, intrathecal length 6.5 cm) were placed as described (\nGeis et al., 2010\n;\nYaksh and Rudy, 1976\n). Rats developing signs of paralysis after surgery with catheter placement were sacrificed immediately. All others were allowed to recover for 8\u201310 days, and rats were randomized to receive either purified patient IgG or recombinant ABs. The principal experimental groups contained a minimum of 6 animals for each treatment mode. All i.th. injections were painless as judged by daily observation of the rats and were done in the awake rat while gently immobilizing them for 30 seconds.\nThe IgG fractions were injected at the following concentrations: NMO IgG 1, 2, 4 or control IgG 1 or 2 at 100 mg/ml, NMO IgG 3 at 12 mg/ml; for estimating a dose\u2013response relation, NMO IgG 4 was injected at 30 mg/ml and 70 mg/ml in two groups of 3 rats each; rAB\nAQP4\nwas injected at a concentration of 1 mg/ml (or of 0.5 mg/ml in 7 rats for estimating the dose\u2013response relation) and rAB\ncontr1\n, rAB\ncontr2\nat 1 mg/ml. Because of their monoclonality for the respective antigens, rAB IgG fractions were used in a 100-fold lower concentration than polyclonal NMO-IgG or control IgG fractions. The high concentrations of patient IgG and of control IgG did not produce any unspecific effects as observed in this and in previous experiments (\nGeis et al., 2010\n,\n2012\n). Injections of 10 \u03bcl purified NMO IgG or rABs or control IgG were performed with a subsequent flush of 10 \u03bcl saline in three series of daily injections for 5 days each with a 2 days break before the subsequent series, resulting in 15 total IgG injections over a 3 week period (\nFig. 1\n). This approach was chosen because it had been found useful in earlier studies (\nGeis et al., 2010\n,\n2011\n). Moreover, the action of ABs can be studied independent of additional co-factors including complement, and the time course of developing disease signs can be followed. In a further group of animals we studied the recovery potential using the IgG fraction named NMO IgG 3 after a full course of injections observing the rats for another 30 days without any further IgG application.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nI.th. injections of IgG preparations via implanted catheters (white arrow) were performed in three series of five daily applications with a two-day interval between the three series. Disease severity was scored daily and RotaRod (RR) and grip strength (GS) testing was performed weekly. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) testing were done at the indicated time points.\n\nBehavioral analyses\nBehavioral analyses were performed by investigators who were masked as to the treatment assignments. Animals were observed daily for at least one hour while moving in their cages and freely over a large table. Body weight was monitored daily. Motor disability was rated on a spinal cord disease score modified from an EAE score (\nLinker et al., 2002\n) ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (death due to complete immobilization;\nSupplementary Table\n). Before surgery, rats were trained on an accelerating RotaRod (TSE Systems, Bad Homburg, Germany) and quantitative testing was performed 8\u201310 days after surgery just before the 1st injection to be taken as baseline, and then after the 5th, 10th and 15th i.th. injections (\nFig. 1\n). Grip strength of the forelimbs was tested with a digital grip force meter (DFIS series, Chatillon, Greensboro, NC, USA) before and after surgery and after the 5th, 10th and 15th i.th. injection.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging and contrast agent\nThe experimental contrast agent gadofluorine M (a gift from Bayer Schering Pharma GmbH, Berlin, Germany), which is known to be up to 10 times more sensitive than standard gadolinium in detecting leakage of the blood\u2013brain barrier, was applied intravenously in the tail vein of experimental rats 24 hours before MRI imaging (0.1 mmol/kg) (\nBendszus et al., 2008\n). All measurements of rat spinal cord were performed in the anesthetized rat on a 3T MRI Unit (Siemens TIM Trio, Erlangen, Germany) using a commercial 7 cm coil (Siemens). Rats were placed in a custom-made plastic chamber in a stretched position. The MRI protocol included a scout sequence in three planes, then sagittal and coronal scans were done to identify gadofluorine M enhancing lesions. In total, 22 rats were investigated in this way (NMO IgG1\nn\n= 5, NMO IgG2\nn\n= 3, NMO IgG3\nn\n= 3; control IgG\nn\n= 4; rAB\nAQP4\nn\n= 4, rAB\ncontr1\nn\n= 3).\n\nFunctional analyses of afferent spinal cord nerve tracts by recording somatosensory evoked potentials\nSomatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) were recorded in NMO1 and NMO2 IgG injected groups of rats and in the respective control groups\nin vivo\nunder ketamine\u2013xylazine anaesthesia (100 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively) before any injections and after terminating i.th. injections. In these groups, two skull recording electrodes and one reference electrode were implanted bilaterally after placing the i.th. catheter. Steel screws were placed according to the following coordinates: 2 mm lateral to midline and 2.5 mm caudal to bregma. Another screw was placed midline 1.5 mm caudal to lambda and served as reference electrode. Holes were drilled (Dremel 300-1/5 driller) under stereomicroscopic control and care was taken not to damage the dura mater. Screws were fixed in the scull using dental cement (Dental Manufaktur GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Recordings were performed using a digital Toennies electromyograph and NeuroScreen\nplus\nsoftware (Erich Jaeger GmbH, Hoechberg, Germany). The tibial nerve on either side was serially stimulated 200 times at 1 Hz with a stimulation current 30% above the current needed to obtain the maximal response (supramaximal stimulation) with a stimulus duration of 1 ms. SSEP were recorded from the contralateral somatosensory cortex. Latencies to the first positive deflection (P1) and the amplitudes between P1 and the first negative deflection (N1) were measured.\n\nTissue harvesting and immunohistochemistry\nOne to 3 days after the last injection animals were deeply anesthetized and blood was collected after vessel transection in an axillary skin pouch. The spinal cord was removed after laminectomy and subdivided into cervico-thoracic and lumbar regions. Spinal cord specimens were then embedded in Tissue Tec OTC embedding compound (Sakura Finetek, Zoeterwoude, Netherlands) and snap-frozen in isobutane cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C. Serial 10 \u03bcm cryosections of the mounted spinal cord were cut at different levels (cervico-thoracic, and lumbar segment) on a cryostat (CM 050S Kryostat, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Standard hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed for basic histology. For immunohistochemistry, sections were blocked with 10% BSA, incubated at 4 \u00b0C over night with various antibodies, and visualization was done with streptavidin\u2013biotin peroxidase or with immunofluorescence. The following antibodies were used with pre-incubation of 2% milk powder to block non-specific binding: polyclonal rabbit anti-human IgG (Dako, Hamburg, Germany; 1:200), polyclonal rabbit anti-AQP4 (A5971; Sigma Aldrich, St.Louis, USA; 1:500), polyclonal rabbit anti-AQP4 (sc-20812, Santa-Cruz, CA, USA; 1:500), polyclonal rabbit anti-GFAP (EMD Millipore, Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA; 1:5000), monoclonal mouse anti-GFAP (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA, USA; 1:100), polyclonal rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako, Osaka, Japan; 1:500); polyclonal rabbit anti-EAAT2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; 1:100), monoclonal mouse anti-ED1 (Linaris, Wertheim, Germany; 1:500), polyclonal rabbit anti-neurofilament H (Affiniti Ltd., Exeter, UK, 1:2000), monoclonal mouse anti-NogoA (kindly provided by Professor M. Schwab, Zurich, Switzerland; 1:5000), monoclonal mouse anti-APP (clone 22C11, EMD-Millipore; 1:2000), rabbit anti-C9neo (kindly provided by B.P. Morgan, Cardiff, Wales, UK; 1:5000), monoclonal mouse NR1 (EMD-Millipore, 1:1000). Visualization with diaminobenzidine was performed after incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature with the biotinylated secondary antibodies and the streptavidin\u2013biotin complex (Vectastain ABC-Peroxidase Kit, Linaris). Washing steps were done using tris-buffered saline. For immunofluorescence staining, we used Cy3 antibody (donkey anti-mouse 1:100 or anti-rabbit 1:100, respectively; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and Alexa-Fluor 488 antibody (donkey anti-mouse 1:400 or anti-rabbit 1:400, respectively; Dianova) and DAPI counterstaining. For myelin staining, sections were incubated in Luxol fast blue solution (Sigma Aldrich, Germany; 1 g in 1000 ml ethanol 96% with 5 ml 10% acetic acid) at 60 \u00b0C, then washed with ethanol 96% followed by aqua dest., and then differentiated in lithium carbonate (Sigma; 0.5 g in 1000 ml) together with ethanol 70%. After dehydration in ascending alcohol series, sections were mounted with Vitroclud (Langenbrinck, Emmendingen, Germany).\nSpinal cord sections were viewed with an Axiophot 2 microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) by an examiner masked as to treatment allocation with the appropriate filter settings and digitized using SPOT imaging software version 4.5 (SPOT imaging solutions, Burroughs, Sterling Heights, USA). Analyses were performed with Image Pro Plus version 4.5 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, USA).\n\nDensitometric analyses and counting of immunoreactive cells\nAll immunostains were digitized with the identical microscope and software settings. For quantification, a standardized area of interest (AOI, 62 \u03bcm\n2\n) was placed in the grey and in the white matter in the ventral and the dorsal horn on either side. Means of grey and white matter values of each animal were then taken for further analyses. Intraspinal regions with high density staining for human IgG, typically near the catheter ending, were defined as a potential lesion areas and AOI were also placed into these regions (see\nFig. 3H\nfor scheme of quantitative analyses). Comparisons were then made with the grey and white matter AOI of the contralateral side. In control IgG treated animals, mean values of both sides were taken for analysis. Mean density values on the color scale (red, green, blue scale, 0\u2013255 color grades), areas of positively stained cells, and numbers of positive cells were all determined semi-automatically using custom-made macros with Image Pro Plus software by an investigator masked as to treatments.\nFig. 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nLongitudinal lesions and human IgG deposition in spinal cord tissue after i.th. passive-transfer A: Representative contrast-enhanced MRI of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions (T1 weighted, repetition time 860 ms, echo time 15 ms; slice thickness of 1.0 mm) of a control IgG treated rat (left sagittal sections and right transversal section) with only marginal local enhancement of the experimental contrast agent Gadofluorine M (Gf) adjacent to the tip of the catheter (arrow). Anatomical landmarks are indicated. B: Representative spinal MRI of a rat injected i.th. with NMO1-IgG for 15 days. Twenty-four following Gf administration, T1-weighted contrast enhancement was most pronounced in the region adjacent to the tip of the i.th. catheter (arrow) and extended several segments above it (left panel). Transverse sections (right panel) revealed accumulation of Gf in white and grey matter areas predominantly ipsilateral to the injection side (arrows, slice thickness 1.5 mm). C: Transverse spinal cord sections at low magnification showed intraspinal human IgG deposition in the spinal white and grey matter which was gradually reduced at increasing distance from the site of the catheter ending. D to G: Higher magnification reveals strong IgG deposition in the white (*, D) and grey (#, E) matter, along astrocytic structures, vascular structures and perineural spaces. After i.th. application of control IgG (F,G), immunoreactivity against human IgG was clearly less intense. H: Schematic drawing to illustrate the quantitative evaluation of immunoreactivity. Standardized areas of interest (AOI) were placed in the grey and in the white matter in the ventral and the dorsal horn on either side for densitometric measurements (black squares). At lesion sites, a further AOI was placed in the area of highest human IgG deposition (red square; C: catheter, IgG: area of human IgG deposition) and density measurements were compared with contralateral AOI. Densitometry was done with the red, green, and blue scale (RGB, 0\u2013255 color grades covering the whole color spectrum). Note, that this method reflects large differences in staining intensities by small numeric changes. I: Quantitative evaluation of IgG deposition in spinal cord lesion areas as compared to contralateral white and grey matter for all experimental groups (**\np\n< 0.01, ***\np\n< 0.001). For detailed information on densitometry see Materials and methods.\n\nInvestigation of specific IgG tissue binding\nIn a series of cryosections, we investigated if tissue-bound human IgG could be dissociated to address the question of nonspecific binding. Adjacent sections were either treated with 0.5% polyethylene glycol (PEG) or with 0.5 M acetic acid (pH 2.5) before staining with the specific primary AB (human IgG, AQP4, and EAAT2). To exclude or minimize steric hindrance or blocking of the specific ABs by the high concentrations of tissue-bound human IgG we performed double-immunofluorescence stainings on control spinal cord sections using two different commercial anti-AQP4 ABs (rabbit polyclonal, A5971; Sigma Aldrich, 1:500; rabbit polyclonal, sc-20812, Santa-Cruz, CA, USA, 1:500) both directed at the C-terminal domain of AQP4 which is not recognized by the NMO patient IgG fractions (\nCrane et al., 2011\n) in combination with purified NMO-IgG and patient-derived AQP-specific recombinant AB (rAB\nAQP4\n). These stains showed a reproducible binding pattern to predominantly perivascular astrocytic structures. There was no difference in the staining pattern with rAB\nAQP4\n, purified NMO IgG, and both commercial anti-AQP4 AB. Double immunofluorescence staining of naive spinal cord tissue with rAB\nAQP4\nor purified NMO IgG together with the commercial anti-AQP4 AB gave clear co-labeling (not shown) confirming different binding epitopes of patient and commercial AB and excludes steric hindrance.\n\nStatistical analyses\nAll data are presented as means and SEMs. Statistical analyses were done using SigmaPlot software version 12.0 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Evaluation of normal distribution of data was done by using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test. Depending on data distribution, the significance of differences between 2 treatment groups was tested by using the Student's\nt\n-test or the Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\n-test. Multiple comparisons were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc analysis or one-way repeated measures ANOVA with Holm\u2013Sidak pairwise multiple comparison procedures in case of repeated analyses of multiple treatment groups."

    "Methods": "This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in\nthe Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of\nHealth. All experiments were approved by the University of Washington Institutional\nAnimal Care and Use Committee (Animal Welfare Assurance #A3464-0 l). All\nsurgery was performed under halothane anesthesia, and all efforts were made to\nminimize suffering.\n\nAnimals\nOutbred male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Hollister, CA) were\nadministered head injury at 32\u201336 days of age. Rats were housed 2 to 3\nper cage prior to epidural electrode implantation, and individually afterward.\nAnimals were kept in a specific-pathogen-free facility with controlled light (12\nh light-dark cycle), temperature and humidity, and ad libitum access to food and\nwater.\n\nSurgical procedures\nrpFPI and epidural electrode implantation were performed as detailed\npreviously (\nD\u2019Ambrosio et al.,\n2013\n;\nEastman et al., 2010\n).\nFor rpFPI, 17 animals were anesthetized (4% halothane), intubated and\nmechanically ventilated (1\u20131.5% halothane, 30%\nO\n2\nand air). Rectal temperature was monitored and maintained at\n37 \u00b0C with a heat pad. A 3 mm burr hole was drilled centered at 2 mm\nposterior to bregma and 3 mm from the midline over the right convexity. Animals\nwere disconnected from the ventilator and a pressure pulse (8 ms, 3.5 atm) was\ndelivered with the FPI device (Scientific Instruments, University of Washington)\nand measured by a transducer (Entran EPN-D33-100P-IX, Measurement Specialties,\nHampton, VA). Mechanical ventilation was resumed 10 s after injury to\nstandardize posttraumatic apnea and hypoxia, and terminated when spontaneous\nbreathing resumed. All animals survived the injury.\nEpidural electrodes were implanted 14\u201315 days after injury.\nBriefly, 1 mm diameter stainless-steel screw electrodes were implanted through\n0.75 mm diameter guiding craniotomies. The full ECoG montage consisted of five\nepidural electrodes (\nFig. 1A\n): a reference\nelectrode placed midline in the frontal bone and two electrodes per parietal\nbone, placed at coordinates bregma 0 mm and \u22126.5 mm, 4.5\u20135 mm\nfrom the midline. Three anchoring screws (one frontal and two occipital) were\nimplanted to help secure the headset. All electrodes were connected through\ninsulated wire to gold-plated pins in a plastic pedestal (PlasticsOne inc.,\nRoanoke, VA). Parts of the craniotomy not covered with thick connective tissue\nwere covered with biocompatible silicone (Kwik-Cast., WPI, Sarasota, FL). The\nentire assembly was then cemented onto the skull with measured amount of dental\nacrylic (Jet, Lang Dental Manufacturing Co., Wheeling, IL) to standardize the\nheadsets, and further secured with VetBond (World Precision Instruments,\nSarasota, FL) adhesive. Because unintended damage to the neocortex induces focal\nastroglial reactivity and is often associated with focally abnormal ECoG (\nD\u2019Ambrosio et al., 2009\n), our\nsurgical procedures incorporate routine precautions to minimize thermal and\nmechanical damage. During drilling, the skull and drill bit are cooled with\nroom-temperature sterile saline to minimize frictional heating, and particular\ncare is taken to avoid deforming or tearing the dura. In addition, the depth of\nanchoring screws and screw electrodes is carefully controlled to avoid brain\ncompression. During the exothermic phase of the curing process, the acrylic\nheadset is cooled with compressed air to prevent overheating of the brain.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nDistribution of seizure durations as observed by continuous ECoG with the full or\noccipital montages. A) Spontaneous seizures were observed with a week of\ncontinuous epidural ECoG recording 1 month post-injury either by the full\nmontage (electrodes 1\u20135), or by the occipital montage (electrodes 2, 3,\nand 5). Black dots indicate the location of the numbered epidural electrodes in\nthe rat skull. Electrode 5 is the reference in both montages. Gray circle\nindicates the rostral parasagittal site of FPI. B) Histogram shows counts of\nseizures in logarithmically scaled (i.e. unequal width) bins. Numbers above the\ncolumns indicate count for full and occipital montages, respectively. The\noccipital montage fails to detect a large number of shorter focal seizures that\nare detected by the full montage. Empirical cumulative frequency distributions\nare shown in the inset. Arrows indicate the proportion of seizures that are\nexcluded under the indicated duration-based seizure definitions. C\u2013E)\nFocal seizures observed 1 month postinjury include both perilesional cortical\nseizures (C) and spreading seizures (D and E). Note that the focal perilesional\ntype (C) and the focal seizures spreading frontally (D) can be detected only\nwith the full montage, while the seizures spreading to the occipital cortex (E)\nare ultimately detected also by the occipital montage.\n\nVideo/ECoG monitoring and seizure identification\nThe ECoG was acquired continuously for 1 week with the full 5-electrode\nmontage, in seven sequential one-day epochs from the 22nd to the 28th day after\nrpFPI. Animals were tethered to the amplifier headstage. Brain electrical\nactivity was amplified (\u00d75000) and filtered (0.3 Hz high-pass, 300 Hz\nlow-pass) using a Neurodata 12 or a M15 amplifier (Grass Instruments, Quincy,\nMA), acquired at 600 Hz per channel on computers equipped with SciWorks 4.1 or\nExperimenter V3 software (Datawave Technologies Inc., Longmont, CO), and DT3010\nacquisition boards (DataTranslation Inc., Marlboro, MA). Videos were recorded in\nVHS using digital cameras connected to VCRs. Each camera monitored a maximum of\ntwo cages (1 animal per cage).\nData analysis was conducted blind to subject and day postinjury. ECoG\nwas visualized in Matlab (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA) and manually scrolled\noffline. This approach is laborious and requires expert raters, but it permits\nreliable analysis of all seizure activity generated by the epileptic focus and\nit is the approach used to evaluate human ECoG data at the UW Regional Epilepsy\nCenter. Seizures were characterized by 1) focal trains of ~150 ms long spikes\nlasting at least 1 s that are clearly distinct from baseline, 2) a sudden\nincrease in spectral power in the theta band over the baseline (\nButler et al., 2013\n;\nD\u2019Ambrosio et al., 2004\n;\nIkeda et al., 2009\n), and 3) simultaneous stereotyped ictal\nbehavioral changes according to a behavioral scale previously described (\nD\u2019Ambrosio et al., 2009\n) and\naccording to the clinical practice of seeking evidence of abnormal neuronal\nactivity paired to behavioral signs (\nD\u2019Ambrosio et al., 2009\n;\nD\u2019Ambrosio and Miller, 2010\n;\nFisher et al., 2005\n). Trains of spikes shorter than 1 s were\nconsidered likely interictal (\nD\u2019Ambrosio\net al., 2009\n), and were excluded from study. Identified seizures\nranged from 1 s to over 5 min (\nTable 1\n).\nEvents occurring within 5 s of each other were defined as a single seizure. In\naccord with previous work (\nD\u2019Ambrosio et\nal., 2005\n;\nPearce et al.,\n2014\n;\nWilloughby and Mackenzie,\n1992\n), age-dependent idiopathic seizures, were not seen in this study\nbecause that seizure type typically appears after 5\u20136 months of age in\nthis rat strain and gender. The following data were extracted for each seizure:\n1) onset time, 2) duration, and 3) ECoG channel(s) at which the event was\ndetected.\nTable 1.\nEffect of recording montage and seizure definition on experimental epilepsy\noutcome measures.\nDuration-based seizure\ndefinition\nFull montage\nOccipital montage\n\u22641 s\n>3 s\n>5 s\n>10 s\n>15 s\n>1 s\n>3 s\n>5 s\n>10 s\n>15 s\nRats\nMean frequency (seizures/h)\n3.7\n1.9\n1.3\n0.6\n0.4\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.4\n0.3\nRange (seizures/h)\nLow\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nHigh\n17.4\n10.9\n7.6\n4.4\n2.8\n4.3\n3.9\n3.4\n2.5\n1.9\nTime seizing (s/h)\n28.1\n24.5\n22.1\n17.7\n15.0\n14.9\n14.6\n14.1\n12.9\n11.7\nRange (s/h)\nLow\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nHigh\n180.3\n167.3\n154.8\n132.1\n111.9\n103.4\n103.0\n100.9\n94.4\n86.7\nIncidence\n94%\n94%\n88%\n88%\n88%\n88%\n82%\n76%\n71%\n71%\nEpileptic seizures\nSeizure count\n10,274\n5296\n3517\n1783\n1148\n2138\n1765\n1488\n1069\n815\nMean duration (s)\n7.6\n12.9\n17.5\n27.7\n36.2\n19.3\n22.9\n26.4\n33.9\n40.7\nDuration range (s)\nLow\n1.0\n3.0\n5.0\n10.0\n15.0\n1.1\n3.0\n5.0\n10.0\n15.0\nHigh\n318.3\n318.3\n318.3\n318.3\n318.3\n318.3\n318.3\n318.3\n318.3\n318.3\nOpen in a new tab\nSummary statistics are shown for the 17 rats used and the 10,274 seizures\nobserved. Time seizing, and seizure frequency, duration and incidence are\ncomputed on the basis of the indicated subsets of the data obtained from\nweek-long continuous video-ECoG recordings from rpFPI rats.\n\nPower analyses\nThe ECoG data acquired from week-long continuous recordings of 17 rats\nwere used in Monte-Carlo simulations to conduct bootstrapped non-parametric\nstatistical power analyses. These simulations were similar in principle to those\nwe reported previously (\nEastman et al.,\n2010\n,\n2011\n), but were designed\nto assess the effects of different experimental variables (\nTable 2\n), such as seizure definitions, recording\nmontages, and duration of recordings on the statistical power to detect the\ntreatment effects. The seizure activity of each rat was represented as a list of\nall the seizure onset times observed during the week of continuous monitoring.\nThese lists were aggregated in a database, which was indexed by subject, that\ncontained the onset times of all seizures longer than 1 s that were detected\nusing the full 5-electrode recording montage. This database was filtered to\nproduce subset databases representing the seizures that would have been detected\nusing the occipital montage and/or other seizure definitions based on duration.\nThus, a database filtered to remove seizures that were shorter than 5 s and/or\nwere not detected by at least one of electrodes 2 and 3 (\nFig. 1A\n) represented the seizures that would have been\ndetected in these animals using the occipital montage and defining seizures to\nlast at least 5 s. A total of 10 databases were used to examine 2 recording\nmontages and 5 duration based seizure definitions. Recordings of different\nlengths were simulated by changing the length of the interval in which onsets\nwere counted, and measurement-to-measurement variation was modeled by choosing\nintervals of the specified length at random, with replacement, within the\nweek-long records. The frequency of seizure assigned to each subject in a\nsimulated experiment was determined by counting seizure onsets within a\nspecified time interval and dividing by the length of the interval. Thus,\nseizure frequencies were simulated based on the actual temporal patterns of\nseizure onsets recorded from rpFPI rats. Ten thousand experiments were simulated\nfor each set of variables investigated, and the statistical power to detect a\nspecified treatment effect was determined as the fraction of experiments in\nwhich significant differences in seizure frequency between the control and\ntreated groups were detected using the statistical test appropriate for the\ndifferent types of experiment: seizure control and seizure prevention.\nTable 2.\nVariables investigated by bootstrap power analyses.\nDuration of ECoG recordings (from 4 h to 7 days per week)\nECoG montage type:\nFull montage: electrodes 1\u20135 in\nFig. 1A\nOccipital montage: electrodes 2, 3, 5 in\nFig. 1A\nSeizure definition based on duration (>1 s; >3 s; >5\ns; >10 s; >15 s)\nTreatment effect: 10%\u2013100% decrease\nin probability of seizure precipitation\nGroup size: ranging 6\u201330\nPower\nOpen in a new tab\nSeizure-control experiments (Fig. 7) are conducted to determine whether\na treatment has an AS effect, i.e. suppresses seizures once the epileptic focus\nhas developed. Such experiments are best conducted with a repeated measures\ndesign (\nEastman et al., 2010\n), in which\neach subject serves as its own control, to minimize the impact of\nsubject-to-subject variability. Rats are recorded at baseline and epileptic rats\n(defined as rats exhibiting seizures during the baseline observation period) are\nadministered treatment. They are recorded again after a specified period on\ntreatment, and seizure frequencies at baseline and\n\u201con-treatment\u201d are compared to assess the effect of treatment.\nFor each simulated seizure-control experiment a group of subjects was chosen\nrandomly, with replacement, from a database. Baseline seizure frequencies for\neach subject were determined as described above, and any subjects without\nseizures at baseline were counted and replaced with another random selection\nfrom the database. A specified treatment effect was simulated by tagging each\nseizure within the selected time window with a uniform random real number\n(0\u2013100) and eliminating seizures tagged with random numbers less than\nthe target percent drug effect. Treated seizure frequencies were determined\nbased on a count of seizure onsets remaining within the observation interval. We\nhave previously shown that seizure frequency has a log-normal distribution in\nrpFPI rats 1 month after injury, and that the seizure frequency data acquired in\nseizure control experiments are best analyzed after logarithmic transformation\n(Log\n10\n), using a paired\nt\n-test (\nEastman et al., 2010\n). Thus, that strategy was\nadopted for the simulated seizure control experiment, and results are reported\nin terms of the effective group size, that is the number of animals that must\nactually be injured and recorded (at least once), required to provide\n80% power to detect the indicated effects.\nIn seizure prevention experiments (Fig. 6), seizure frequencies are\ncompared in independent groups of untreated and treated subjects to assess\nwhether a treatment administered after an epileptogenic insult prevents or\ndiminishes the later development of CSRSs. For each simulated seizure prevention\nexperiment, independent groups of control and treatment subjects were chosen\nrandomly, with replacement, from a database. Control seizure frequencies were\ndetermined as described above for baseline seizure frequency in seizure-control\nexperiments, except that control subjects without seizures were not replaced. A\nstatistical comparison of control and treatment groups was performed after each\nsimulated experiment. Reductions in seizure frequency were assessed using a\none-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest (\u03b1 =\n0.05) with tie correction (\nSiegel, 1956\n).\nAll power analyses were performed using the Statistics101 resampling statistics\nprogram (\nhttp://www.statistics101.net/\n). Other statistical procedures,\noutside the power analyses, were conducted using SPSS v17 (IBM inc., NY)."

    "Methods": "Primary culture of rat optic nerve head astrocytes\nThe protocol for the present studies was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Missouri \u2013 Kansas City, and was executed in accordance with the ARVO Statement on the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Visual Research.\nThe isolation of ONHAs was modified from the report by Murphy\net al\n.(\nMurphy, et al., 2010\n) Three months old male Brown Norway rats were euthanized and optic nerve heads with approximately 2 mm optic nerve stump attached were dissected and cultured retina side down in a well of a 24-well plate (TTP, Midwest Scientific, St. Louis, MO), in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (PAA Laboratories, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ) 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin. At 5 days\nin vitro\n(DIV), astrocytes had migrated onto the plate as confirmed under a tissue culture microscope (DM IL, Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Remaining tissue and media were aspirated by vacuum suction and fresh media added. Media was subsequently refreshed every 72 hr. At DIV 10, cells had reached approximately 80% confluency in the well and were passaged into a T25 tissue culture flask (TPP, Midwest Scientific, St. Louis, MO) by trypsinization (0.25% Trypsin, 2.21 mM EDTA in Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution; MediaTech Inc., Manassas, VA). ONHA culture was successfully maintained for more than 10 passages at a sub-culturing ratio of 1:4 every 72 hr. Passages 3 \u2013 6 were used for the experiments described herein.\n\nImmunocytochemistry and image acquisition\nImmunocytochemistry was performed essentially as described previously (\nKaja, et al., 2011\n,\nKaja, et al., 2011\n,\nKaja, et al., 2012\n). Briefly, ONHAs were seeded onto poly-L-lysine coated glass coverslips (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) at a density of 25,000 cells. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline for 15 min. The primary antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), IP\n3\nRs and RyRs have previously been validated extensively for use in immunocytochemistry and are listed in\nTable 1\n. Secondary antibody was AlexaFluor\n\u00ae\n488 labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2,000 dilution; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were co-labeled with AlexaFluor\n\u00ae\n647 Phalloidin (1:200 dilution; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) to visualize actin filaments, and Hoechst 33258 (120 ng/\u00b5L; Enzo Life Sciences Inc., Farmingdale, NY) to label cell nuclei. Cells were mounted using AquaPolymount (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA). Images were acquired using a Leica SP5X WLL microscope (Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL).

All antibodies are well-characterized and their specificity for their respective epitopes has been shown previously.\n\nOptical imaging of the intracellular calcium concentrations\nCalcium imaging experiments and analysis were performed essentially as described previously.(\nPayne, et al., 2013\n) Experiments were conducted in Extracellular Solution buffer (ECS; 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 1 mM MgSO\n4\n, 10 mM HEPES, 22 mM D-(+)-glucose, and 1.8 mM CaCl\n2\n. Final concentrations of the excipient, dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma, St Louis, MO), were maintained at 0.1%. Cells were seeded as detailed above and incubated for 20 min with 1 \u00b5M Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (AM) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) in growth media supplemented with 3 mM sodium pyruvate (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) to counter potential effects of byproducts of the AM hydrolysis reaction.(\nTiffert, et al., 1984\n) Coverslips were rinsed in ECS supplemented with 55 mM KCl to fill intracellular stores prior to being mounted for imaging on a Leica DMI 6000 fluorescent microscope (Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL) with an Orca-R2\nC10600\ndigital camera (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) with DG5 fast wavelength switcher (Sutter, Novato, CA) controlled by MetaFluor (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and Fura2 filter set 71000av2 (D340xv2, D380xv2, 400DCLP, D510/40m; Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT) and allowed to equilibrate in ECS for at least 5 minutes prior to imaging. Cells were imaged with a HCX PL APO 40x/1.25\u20130.75 oil objective (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Mounted coverslips were constantly perfused with ECS buffer warmed to 37\u00b0C by a temperature controller (TC-344B; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and an inline heater/cooler (SC-20; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Drugs were delivered through a software-controlled perfusion system (VC-8T; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) driven by high flow peristaltic pumps (P720/66; Instech, Plymouth Meeting, PA) at speed of 2 ml/min. For RyR-mediated responses, caffeine-treated coverslips were imaged at 1 Hz and were perfused with 50 mM caffeine in ECS solution for 300 s, followed by 120 s in ECS buffer. Cells did not respond to depolarization with 55 mM KCl (data not shown). Maximum release of intracellular Ca\n2+\nwas obtained from the same cells by perfusion with 2.5 \u00b5M ionomycin in ECS for 120 s, 5 min after return of the signal to baseline. For IP\n3\nR-mediated responses, cells were incubated and recorded with 10 \u00b5M Bt\n3\nIns(1,4,5)P\n3\n/AM (AG Scientific, San Diego, CA) for 20 minutes in a total of 300 \u00b5l with a heated cover. Images were recorded at 2 Hz, to reduce photobleaching.\nFor pharmacological experiments, dantrolene (DAN; 20 \u00b5M; Enzo, Farmingdale, NY) and Xestospongin D (Xes D; 10 \u00b5M; EMD Millipore, Gibbstown, NJ), inhibitors of RyR and IP\n3\nR, respectively, were applied 30 min prior to application of the respective agonists, and the concentration maintained during the experiment.\nRegions of Interest (ROIs) were selected based on fluorescent and brightfield images, identifying cell perimeter, cytosol and nucleus. Data was background corrected utilizing the mean fluorescence signal intensity from 5 randomly placed background ROIs in the field of view, normalized for surface area and section volume and exported to Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) for analysis, as described previously (\nPayne, et al., 2013\n). Specifically, a single ROI was used for the total cellular response by outlining the cell based on the DIC image. For subcellular analysis, a single ROI was used for the nuclear Ca\n2+\nresponse, whereas 3\u20135 ROIs were placed in the cytosol. Signal intensity of cytosolic ROIs was averaged to obtain the mean fluorescence intensity value for each cell.\n\nData Analysis and Statistics\nStatistical analysis was conducted using Prism version 5 (Graphpad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Experimental groups were compared by Student\u2019s\nt\n-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Newman-Keuls post hoc test, as appropriate. Ca\n2+\ntransients were analyzed with respect to amplitude, the maximal intracellular calcium release from ER stores, and presented as mean F/F\n0\nmax, and as mean area under the curve (AUC), a correlate measure of total calcium release. This experimentally-defined AUC was calculated from the baseline (F\n0\n) to the amplitude (F/F\n0\nmax) plus the next 100 time points (equaling 100s for caffeine experiments) or 250 time points (equaling 500s for IP\n3\n-AM experiments), and is shown as integrated relative fluorescence units (iRFU). Transients were defined by thresholding at 5% above baseline (F/F\n0\n> 1.05). The 5% threshold was applied after normalization and was used to distinguish artifacts or noise from specific signals in a standardized way. The 5% threshold served as inclusion criterion for cells responding at different intensities, thus permitting differentiation of lower cytosolic responses compared with stronger nuclear responses. Data was compiled from the number of cells (\nn\n) derived from a minimum of three to five separate experiments for each experimental condition. When referring to the number of cells responding to pharmacological stimuli,\nn\nrepresents a single experiment, consisting of 3\u20135 coverslips. For histograms, binned data (in F/F\n0\nmax = 0.05 bins, based upon the applied 5% threshold) was fitted with a non-linear regression for Gaussian distribution (1,000 iterations) and data contingency tables were compared with the Pearson\u2019s chi squared (\u03c7\n2\n) test, as described by us previously.(\nPayne, et al., 2013\n)"

    "Methods": "This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Loma Linda University.\n\nAnimal Groups and Interventions\nTwo hundred and eighty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). HBO at 2.5 ATA was administrated for 1 hour daily for 5 consecutive days. 50% dextrose (DX, 6 ml/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 30 minutes before MCAO to induce acute hyperglycemia. PPAR\u03b3 inhibitor GW9662 was administrated intraperitoneally to designated animals for intervention. Animals were divided into six groups: DX+sham (n=20), DX+MCAO (n=54), DX+HBO+MCAO (n=50), DX+NBO+MCAO (n=50), DX+HBO+MCAO+GW9662 (n=50), and DX+HBO+MCAO+DMSO (n=48). Infarction volume, hemorrhage volume, neurological scores and mortality were measured for outcome study. The protein level of PPAR\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, as well as the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were evaluated at 24 hours after MCAO. Two additional groups of animals (Na\u00efve and Na\u00efve+HBO-PC, n=6 for each group) were added to measure the effects of HBO-PC on the level of 15d-PGJ2 in na\u00efve rats.\n\nHyperglycemia Induction and MCAO\nAll rats received 50% dextrose (6 ml/kg) intraperitoneally 30 minutes before MCAO to induce acute hyperglycemia. Anesthesia was induced with ketamine and xylazine (80 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg respectively, intraperitoneally), followed by atropine at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously. During the surgery and postoperative period, rectal temperature was maintained at 37.0\u00b0C by using a feedback-controlled heating pad. MCAO was performed as previously reported (\nHu et al., 2011\n). Briefly, the right external carotid artery was isolated and coagulated. A 4-0 nylon suture with a round tip was inserted into the internal carotid artery through the external carotid artery stump and advanced to occlude the origin of middle cerebral artery. The suture was removed at 2 hours after occlusion. Sham operated rats underwent the same surgical procedures without insertion of the suture.\n\nHBO-PC Regimen\nDue to its potential toxic effects, HBO is currently restricted to short sessions (less than 2 hours), at pressures below the threshold of central nervous system toxicity (0.3 MPa) (\nTibbles and Edelsberg, 1996\n). In our previous studies and preliminary experiments, we tested HBO-PC at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 ATA and found 2.5\u20133 ATA produced more pronounced protective results compared to 1\u20132 ATA. Therefore in this study, we used HBO at 2.5 ATA for 1 hour.\nRats were pressurized in a research hyperbaric chamber (1300B; Sechrist) at 2.5 atmospheres absolutes with 100% oxygen (flow of 22 L/min). Compression and decompression were maintained at a rate of 5 psi/min. HBO was administered for 1 hour daily for 5 consecutive days and the last session was performed 24 hours before MCAO. In the intervention groups, PPAR inhibitor GW9662 (4mg/kg) or 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, vehicle) was injected intraperitoneally 1 hour before MCAO.\n\n2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium Chloride (TTC) Staining\nTTC staining was performed to determine the infarct volume at 24 hours after MCAO as previously reported (\nHu et al., 2011\n). The possible interference of brain edema with infarct volume was corrected by standard methods (whole contralateral hemisphere volume \u2013 nonischemic ipsilateral hemisphere volume) and the infracted volume was expressed as a percentage of the whole contralateral hemisphere.\n\nSpectrophotometric Assay of Hemoglobin\nHemorrhagic volume was quantified with spectrophotometric assay of brain hemoglobin content at 24 hours after MCAO. Cerebral hemorrhage was quantified using a previously described spectrophotometric assay (\nHu et al., 2011\n). A standard curve was obtained using a \u201cvirtual\u201d model of hemorrhage. Incremental volumes of homologous blood (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 \u03bcl) were added to the perfused brain tissue. The hemispheric brain was then homogenized in distilled water followed by 30-minute centrifugation (13,000 g). Drabkin reagent (1.6 ml; Sigma) was added to 0.4 ml supernatant aliquots and optical density was measured at 540 nm via spectrophotometer (Spectronix 3000; Milton-Roy). Hemoglobin measurements were performed and compared with the standard curve to obtain data in terms of hemorrhage volume. The total hemispheric hemoglobin content was expressed as \u03bcl of blood per hemisphere.\n\nNeurological Scores\nA neurological examination was performed by a blinded investigator as previously described with modifications (\nGarcia et al., 1995\n) at 24 hours after MCAO. The scores given to each rat at completion of the evaluation was the summation of 7 individual test scores (spontaneous activity, symmetry in the movement of four limbs, forepaw outstretching, climbing, body proprioception, response to vibrissae touch, and beam walking). The neurological scoring ranged from 3 (most severe deficit) to 21 (maximum).\n\nEnzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for 15d-PGJ2\n15d-PGJ2 brain levels were determined using ELISA kit (MyBioSource, Inc, Canada). Rats were fatally anesthetized with isoflurane (\u2265 %5) followed by cardiovascular perfusion with ice-cold 0.01M phosphate buffered saline. Brains were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately following removal and kept in \u221280\u00b0C. Right hemisphere of the brain tissues were homogenized by sonication in an ice-cold 0.01M phosphate buffered saline and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 1500\u00d7g. The supernatants were collected and Aliquots were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until tested. Enzyme immunoassay isolation and prostaglandin quantification were carried out following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Protein concentration of each sample was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit.\n\nWestern Blot Analysis\nAnimals were anesthetized and underwent transcardiac perfusion using 0.01 M PBS until colorless perfusion fluid was obtained from the right atrium. Tissue samples of the ipsilateral hemisphere were obtained and immersed in 0.5 ml of the Western blot sample buffer and then sonicated for Western blot analysis. Protein concentration of each sample was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The Western blot analysis was performed as previously described(\nHu et al., 2011\n). Primary antibodies used were: PPAR\u03b3 (sc-271392, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), TNF-\u03b1 (sc-243, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IL-1\u03b2 (sc-554859, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ZO-1 (sc-10804, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Occludin (sc-5562, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and \u03b2-actin (sc-1616, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).\n\nMMPs Zymography\nSimilarly prepared protein samples as for Western blot were subjected to gelatin zymography. Approximately 50 \u03bcg of each sample was loaded per lane into the well of precast gels (10% polyacrylamide minigels containing 0.1% gelatin; Invetrogen) with SDS running buffer (1:1; Novex). Electrophoresis was performed with a Tris-glycine running buffer at 125 V constant voltage for 1.5\u20132 h. The gel was removed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in 100 ml of 2.7% Triton X-100 (renature buffer, Invetrogen) on a rotary shaker, then washed with distilled water 10 times. Each gel was incubated with 100 ml of development buffer (50 mM Tris base, 40 mM HCl, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, and 0.2% Brij 35; Invetrogen) at 37\u00b0C for 14 hours on a rotary shaker. Staining was performed with 100 ml of 0.5% Coomassie blue G-250 in 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid for at least 1 hour, and gels were then destained with three changes of solutions. Gelatinolytic activity was demonstrated as clear zones or bands at the appropriate molecular weights. Human MMP-9 and human MMP-2 (from Chemicon Temecula, CA) were used as standards. The activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was quantified in ImageJ software.\n\nStatistical Analyses\nData were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical differences among groups were analyzed by using ANOVA followed by the Tukey method. Mortality was evaluated by Fisher\u2019s exact test.\nP\n< 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Surgical procedures\nSciatic nerve crush\nAll animal work in this research was approved by the University of California, San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Unilateral or bilateral sciatic nerve crush was performed on adult female Fischer 344 rats (120-135g) unresponsive to toe or tail pinch under isoflurane anaesthetic. An area over the hindlimb was shaved and cleaned with povidone-iodine before incision caudal and parallel to the femur. The sciatic nerve was exposed and crushed for 10s with a pair of fine (#55) forceps. After crush, the skin was closed with surgical staples.\nSciatic nerve injection\nUnilateral or bilateral sciatic nerve injection was performed on adult female Fischer 344 rats (120-135g) unresponsive to toe or tail pinch under isoflurane anaesthetic. The sciatic nerve was exposed as above and injected with 4\u03bcl (2\u03bcl/branch) 1%wt/vol LPC in PBS with 10%vol/vol DMSO, 2\u03bcl (1\u03bcl/branch) of 0.01%, 0.05% or 0.1%wt/vol EtBr in PBS or PBS alone. Injections were made longitudinally towards the DRG, with a 36ga NanoFil needle (World Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota, FL) at a rate of 2\u03bcl/min and the needle was held in place for an additional 10s following injection. After injection, the skin was closed with surgical staples.\nC4 dorsal column injury\nAnimals were deeply anaesthetized with 2ml/kg of ketamine cocktail (25mg/ml ketamine, 1.3mg/ml xylazine and 0.25mg/ml acepromazine). Spinal level C4 was exposed by laminectomy and the dura was punctured over the dorsal horn, approximately 1.2mm lateral to midline. A Scouten wire-knife (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) was lowered to a depth of 1mm from the surface of the spinal cord and extruded. The dorsal columns were lesioned with two passes of the wire-knife and the intact dura was pressed against the wire edge of the lifted wire-knife to ensure complete transection of ascending dorsal column sensory axons. The lesion cavity was filled with approximately 200,000 syngeneic bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) suspended in PBS [100,000cells/\u03bcl], injected using glass micropipettes connected to a picospritzer (General Valve, Fairfield, NJ) as previously described (\nHollis II and Zou, 2012\n). Primary BMSCs were isolated from adult female Fischer 344 rats by flushing cells out with DMEM with 10% FBS and Pen/Strep/Glu, cells were cultured in the same media and passaged at 80% confluence. The dorsal musculature was sutured with 4-0 silk sutures and the skin was closed with surgical staples. Three days prior to sacrifice, animals were injected bilaterally into the sciatic nerve with a 1%wt/vol solution of the transganglionic tracer cholera toxin B (CTB; List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) in dH\n2\nO using a 36ga NanoFil syringe. The sciatic nerve was exposed as described above and 1\u03bcl was injected into each of the tibial and common peroneal branches bilaterally (4\u03bcl total).\n\nSacrifice and tissue processing\nAnimals were deeply anaesthetized with ketamine cocktail and transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS followed by 4%wt/vol paraformaldehyde in PBS. Spinal columns, sciatic nerves, DRGs and\ntibialis anterior\nmuscles were post-fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C in 4%wt/vol paraformaldehyde. Tissue was transferred to 30%wt/vol sucrose in PBS for cryoprotection and sectioned on a cryostat (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL) at 20\u03bcm (DRGs, sciatic nerves) or 30\u03bcm (muscle) and mounted directly on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Grafted spinal cords were sectioned sagittally at 40\u03bcm thick and collected as free-floating sections. Sections were washed three times with PBS, blocked for one hour at room temperature (RT) in PBS with 0.25% triton-X100 (PBST) and 5% donkey serum, then incubated overnight (except where noted below) at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies in PBST plus 5% donkey serum. On the second day of staining, sections were washed three times, incubated with Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 2.5hrs at RT, counterstained with DAPI [1 g/ml] (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and washed three final times in PBS. For Frizzled2 immunohistochemistry, antigen retrieval with ice-cold acetone for 10 minutes prior to staining was utilized. Antibodies used for fluorescent immunohistochemistry were: goat anti-CTB [1:10,000; 3-day incubation] (List Biological Laboratories, Cat# 703, RRID:AB_10013220), monoclonal N52 anti-NF200 [1:500] (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# N0142, RRID:AB_477257), rat anti-Frizzled2 [1:50] (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, Cat# MAB1307-050, RRID:AB_2109221), rabbit anti-GFAP [1:750] (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, Cat# Z0334, RRID:AB_10013382), rabbit anti-cJun [1:100] (Cat# 9165, RRID:AB_2130165) and rabbit anti-pSmad [1:100] (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, Cat# 9516S, RRID:AB_491015), rabbit anti-ATF3 [1:200] (Cat# sc-188, RRID:AB_2258513), goat anti-arginase I [1:200] (Cat# sc-18354, RRID:AB_2227469) and rabbit anti-synaptophysin [1:100] (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, Cat# sc-9116, RRID:AB_2199007), rabbit anti-Iba1 [1:1500] (Wako Chemicals USA, Inc., Richmond, VA, Cat# 019-19741, RRID:AB_839504), monoclonal ED1 anti-CD68 [1:500] (AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC, Cat# MCA341R, RRID:AB_2291300), monoclonal 24F anti-CD86 [1:100] (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, Cat# 555016, RRID:AB_395648), Isolectin B\n4\nbiotin conjugated [1:100] (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# L2140), tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated \u03b1-bungarotoxin [1:1500] (Life Technologies, Cat# T-1175).\n\nMyelin staining\nMyelin staining was performed as described (\nSchmued, 1990\n). Briefly, sections washed twice in dH\n2\nO then twice in 0.025\nM\nPB with 0.9% NaCl (working solution) were incubated for 1hr at RT in 0.2%wt/vol gold (III) chloride solution with 0.0075%vol/vol H\n2\nO\n2\nin working solution. Sections were washed twice more in working solution, then incubated for 5min in 5% sodium thiosulfate at room temperature before three final washes in dH\n2\nO.\n\nDRG neuron culture\nRats were deeply anaesthetized with ketamine cocktail, L4 and L5 DRGs were surgically removed, and the animals were decapitated. DRGs were collected in ice-cold L15 medium then digested for 1hr at 37\u00b0C in collagenase type XI (1:1, DMEM/F-12:0.5% collagenase XI in L15 medium; Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ) with gentle agitation every 15min. Cells were centrifuged 2min at 3000rpm, collagenase solution was removed and gently replaced with DMEM/F-12 + 10% FBS so as not to disturb the cell pellet. Cells were then washed twice by gently applying DRG culture medium (DMEM/F-12 with B-27 supplement and Pen/Strep/Glu) so as not to disturb the pellet. Cells were resuspended in DRG culture medium, allowed to settle for 45s then the top cell suspension was added to DRG culture medium, leaving behind the sedimented tissue fragments. DRG cell suspension was then plated on poly-D-lysine coated cell culture dishes. 16 hours after plating, cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 30min at RT, washed 3 times in PBS and stained with monoclonal N52 anti-NF200 as described above for free-floating sections.\n\nImage acquisition and analysis\nImages were acquired on an inverted Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope with LSM acquisition software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC, Thornwood, NY). Ethidium bromide fluorescence emission at 590nm was imaged on a Zeiss LSM510. An Axiovert 40 CFL with an AxioCam MRm and AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC) was used to image gold (III) chloride myelin staining of sciatic nerves. For neurite length quantification images of NF200-immunoreactive DRG neurons were acquired with PictureFrame software for a MicroFire digital camera (Optronics, Goleta, CA) mounted on an upright fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). The NeuronJ plugin for ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) was used for longest neurite tracing and quantification on acquired images (\nMeijering et al., 2004\n). Image density quantification was done on thresholded images using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). ImageJ was used to measure myelin density along a 100\u03bcm thick tracing of thresholded panoramic images stitched together in Photoshop CS5 (Adobe, San Jose, CA). NF200 ratios were calculated by comparing ImageJ density measurements of thresholded and skeletonized (linearized) NF200 images 1.5mm distal and proximal to the sciatic injury site. For neuromuscular junction (NMJ) innervation, 100 tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated \u03b1-bungarotoxin labeled NMJs per animal were examined, in\ntibialis anterior\nmuscles, for apposition by synaptophysin-labeled pre-synaptic terminals. Statistical tests indicated in main text were performed using JMP 9 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). An investigator blinded to the experimental group performed all analyses.\n\nBehavioral testing\nAnimals were trained on accelerating rotarod (5rpm initial, 45rpm max, 300s max; Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) and beam crossing (1inch diameter, 60inch span, 3 passages per trial) for two weeks prior to bilateral sciatic injection of 0.1%wt/vol EtBr, 1%wt/vol LPC, or sciatic nerve crush. For toe spread analysis, hind paw plantar surfaces were dipped in povidone-iodine solution and animals walked on paper in a narrow path between two barriers. The mean distance between the first and fifth toes from three prints was averaged bilaterally. Animals were tested prior to sciatic injury and weekly for 16 weeks after spinal cord injury by investigators blind to the experimental groups.\nPaw 50% withdrawal threshold (PWT) was assessed bilaterally using a series of calibrated von Frey filaments, (Kom Kare, Middletown, OH, USA) using the up-down method exactly as described elsewhere(\nChaplan et al., 1994\n;\nCalcutt, 2004\n). Thermal withdrawal latency was assessed bilaterally using a Hargreaves apparatus (UARDG, Department of Anesthesiology, University of California, San Diego; La Jolla, CA). Prior to testing, rats were acclimated in individual acrylic chambers on a glass surface that was maintained at 30\u00b0C. After an initial acclimation measurement, the median of three subsequent measurements tested at a heating rate of 1\u00b0C/sec with a maximal cut off at 20 sec was taken as the thermal response latency for that paw, and the mean of values of both paws was used to represent each animal.\n\nElectrophysiology\nFor measurement of motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV), rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and nerve temperature maintained at 37\u00b0C using a heating lamp and near-nerve thermistor. The sciatic nerve was stimulated (single 5 V, 0.05 ms square wave pulse) by fine needle electrodes placed at the sciatic notch and Achilles tendon and the evoked electromyograms (EMGs) recorded from the interosseus muscles of the ipsilateral foot via two fine needle electrodes. MNCV was calculated by dividing distance between the two stimulation sites by the time difference between their associated M wave peaks."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nA total of 17 Tg2576 (n=2 female and 3 male 3 MO, n=2 female and 3 male 6 MO, n=3 female and 4 male 16 MO) and 21 age-matched B6sJLF/J WT (n=4 female and 3 male at 3, 6, and 16 MO) mice were obtained from a breeding colony at the Nathan S. Kline Institute for use in the present study for electrophysiology, histology and immunohistochemistry. All animals were recorded from within 1 week (+/-) of the specified age ranges. Animals were housed in groups of 3\u20134 animals per polypropylene cage until at most 4 days before recording, during which time they were separated and individually housed. Food and water was available\nad lib\nunless otherwise noted. All handling, housing and experimental procedures were in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines at Nathan S. Kline Institute as well as NIH guidelines for the proper treatment of animals.\n\nAcute Unit and LFP Recordings and Odorant Stimulation\nAcute single-unit recording procedures in the LEC were performed similarly to\nXu and Wilson, 2012\n. Animals were anesthetized with urethane (1.25 mg/kg). Single units were recorded with a tungsten microelectrode (1\u20135 Mohm) and signals were acquired and analyzed with Spike2 physiology software (CED). Units were identified and separated off-line with template matching and PCA (Spike2 software) and showed at least a 2-ms refractory period in interval histograms. LEC units (filtered 0.3\u20133 kHz) were identified with histological confirmation of electrode position. Electrode placement here was confirmed through evoked responses from stimulation in the OB as well as histological confirmation.\nOlfactory stimuli were delivered with a flow-dilution olfactometer positioned 2 cm from the animal\u2019s nose. Odor vapor was introduced with a computer-controlled pinch valve at a rate of 0.1 liters per minute (LPM) to a constant 1 LPM flow of nitrogen gas. Stimuli were introduced for 2 s per trial with at least a 30 s inter-stimulus interval. A total of 6 odors were used (3 monomolecular, 3 odor-mixtures). Each odor was presented randomly for 4 trials for each single-unit recording. The monomolecular odorants used were ethyl valerate, isoamyl acetate and heptanal. The odor-mixtures used have been previously described (\nBarnes, et al., 2008\n,\nChapuis and Wilson, 2012\n,\nLovitz, et al., 2012\n,\nXu and Wilson, 2012\n). As noted in these publications, 10C is a mixture comprised of 10 different monomolecular odors, 10C-1 is the same mixture as 10C with one component removed, and 10CR1 is the same mixture as 10C with one component replaced with a different component. The component removed in 10C-1 and replaced in 10CR1 were consistent across animals and throughout the present experiment. Both pure odorants and mixtures were diluted in mineral oil to a concentration of 100 ppm based on vapor pressure. As a result, mixtures had a higher concentration than pure monomolecular odorants.\n\nData Analysis\nSingle-unit and LFP data were all analyzed with Spike2 (CED, Inc). Single units were identified with principal components analyses as well as templating. Recordings were identified as coming from a single-unit by confirming a minimum 2 ms refractory period using interval histograms. Single-unit odor-evoked activity was defined as the spike count 3 s after stimulus onset with basal firing rate (3 s pre-stimulus onset) subtracted. Odor-evoked responses were normalized to the maximal odor response (best odor) of a cell to obtain a relative response magnitude to each odor by each neuron. Spontaneous activity was defined as the per second spike rate 3 s before stimulus onset.\nLFP responses were investigated in the theta (7\u201312 Hz), beta (15\u201335 Hz) and gamma (40\u201380 Hz) frequency bands. Spontaneous power was defined as the activity 3 s before stimulus onset. Odor-evoked power was defined as the activity 3 s after stimulus onset. Odor-evoked and spontaneous power was averaged across the 6 odorants to obtain one set of evoked and spontaneous LFP power per frequency bands per animal.\nIn addition to odor responses, single-unit entrainment to LFP beta oscillations were analyzed. This was done by first extracting a time stamp for each beta oscillatory wave. Negative oscillatory peaks were extracted from the beta frequency filtered LFP by thresholding at two times the standard deviation of the filtered signal. Phase plots of single-unit activity were constructed relative to these peak events and analyzed with Rayleigh statistics using MatLab sub-routines for circular statistics called CircStat (\nBerens, 2009\n). MatLab was used to conduct Raleigh statistics on entrainment data. A Chi-square test was employed to check for significance between genotypes.\nAll statistical comparisons were done using StatView. Two-way repeated measures ANOVAs were used to compare single-unit odor-evoked receptive fields. Two-way between groups ANOVAs were used to compare spontaneous and odor-evoked LFP power in the theta, beta, and gamma frequencies and spontaneous and maximal evoked single-unit activity. T-tests and post-hoc Fisher\u2019s tests were used where appropriate to make pair-wise comparisons.\n\nHistology\nAfter recording, mice were overdosed with urethane and transcardially perfused with PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Brains were removed and post-fixed in 30% sucrose/4% paraformaldehyde. Coronal brain sections (40 \u03bcm) were cut using a sliding microtome (Leica). A portion of these were mounted and stained with cresyl violet for electrode verification (\nFig. 1\n). The remainder sections were stored as floating sections in 0.2% sodium azide/PBS for thioflavin S staining and for immunohistochemistry. Coronal sections were stained with thioflavin S as previously described in (\nWesson, et al., 2010\n). Briefly, tissue samples were mounted and allowed to dry before immersion in 1% thioflavin S (Sigma-Aldrich). These were then rehydrated through immersion in increasing concentrations of ethanol before rinsing with dH\n2\nO and cover slipped. Staining groups always included sections from each age group and genotype.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nElectrode placement in lateral entorhinal cortex. Images from Franklin and Paxinos, 2008. Sections are representative electrode placement positions in LEC from 3.54 mm to 4.24 mm posterior to Bregma.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nCoronal sections were immunolabeled with the antibodies 6E10, C1/6.1 or 22C11 as previously described in (\nWesson, et al., 2010\n). Briefly, sections were rinsed and blocked for 1 hour with 20% filtered normal goat serum diluted in PBS. Sections were then incubated in 6E10 (1:200), C1/6.1 (1:200) or 22C11 (1:100) or buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. Sections were rinsed with PBS and incubated for 2 hours in Alexafluor488 anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500). After incubation, tissue was rinsed a final time, mounted onto glass slides, dried and covered using GelMount. Immunolabeled groups always included sections from each age group and genotype.\n\nWestern Blot\nA separate group of 3 MO (n=3 females and 1 male WT, n=4 females Tg2576), 6 MO (n=2 females WT, n=2 females Tg2576), and 12 MO (n=3 females and 1 male WT, n=4 females Tg2576) mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and sacrificed. Brains were removed, placed on ice and bilateral OB, PCX, HPX, LEC and cerebellum were dissected out for western blot analysis.\nMethods were adapted from (\nMorales-Corraliza, et al., 2013\n). Brain tissue was homogenized in THB (1 ml/100 mg of sample) [1M Tris base (pH 7.4)] and frozen (\u221280\u00b0C) overnight. Protein concentration was determined by BCA Protein Assay Kit. Equal amounts of total protein (20 \u03bcg for A\u03b2PP-CTF and full-length A\u03b2PP (flA\u03b2PP, 40 \u03bcg for A\u03b2) were loaded on a 4\u201320% Tris glycine SDS gel (SDS-PAGE), separated electrophoretically, and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membrane was washed and incubated in 5% milk in TBST for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C with either C1/6.1 or 4G8 mouse antibody (1:1000) and washed in TBST before secondary antibody incubation in anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:5000) in 5% milk in TBST for 1 hour at room temperature. After a final wash in TBST, Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (2 ml/blot) was employed for detection of flA\u03b2PP, and 1 ml of this solution was mixed with 1 ml of SuperSignal Western Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate for detection of A\u03b2PP-CTF and A\u03b2. Stripped membranes were blotted with anti-GAPDH antibody for internal control for loading. Densitometry analysis using ImageJ (NIH) was utilized to quantify protein bands and densities were normalized as a ratio of GAPDH.\n\nSandwich Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for detection of A\u03b2\nBilateral OB, PCX, HPX, LEC and cerebellum were dissected out and tissues from two mice were combined (n=6 Tg2576 at each age group). Brain tissue was homogenized in THB as described for western blot analysis and following treatment with diethylamine (DEA) and centrifugation at 135,000 x g, levels of human A\u03b2 were determined by sandwich ELISA as previously described (\nMorales-Corraliza, et al., 2009\n)."

    "Methods": "Ethics Statement\nBrain tissue from fetal cadavers of gestational age from 17 to 24 weeks is used as the starting material for isolation and purification procedures of hGRPs. Tissue is procured by Procurement Specialists employed by Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR; Alameda CA; FEIN 3005208435) following Donor ID and Informed Consent SOPs and Donor Medical Record Review procedures.\nThe Johns Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved the research protocol #MO13M403 for the transplantation studies of these cells on January 10, 2014 (expires Jan 10, 2015).\n\nDerivation and Culture of Human Glial-Restricted Progenitors (hGRPs)\nhGRPs (also referred to as Q-Cells\u00ae) were derived as previously described (\nCampanelli et al., 2008\n,\nSandrock et al., 2010\n), with the addition of two passages for a total of 21 days of\nin vitro\nexpansion. Briefly, fetal forebrain (17-24 weeks gestational age) was mechanically and enzymatically dissociated, followed by positive selection via magnetic-activated cell sorting with the glial progenitor-specific cell-surface antigen, A\n2\nB\n5\n. Following selection, hGRPs were cultured\nin vitro\non polyornithine-coated flasks [DMEM-F12 with L-glutamine and 15 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (Life Technologies; Carlsbad, CA), 1X N1 (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO), 0.01% human serum albumin (Baxter; Deerfield, IL), 20 ng/mL bFGF (Peprotech; Rocky Hill, NJ), 10 ng/mL PDGF-AA (Peprotech)] for 20 days and subsequently frozen [0.5X medium, 1X ProFreeze non-animal origin freezing medium (Lonza BioWhittaker; Basel, Switzerland), 7.5% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich)]. Frozen aliquots were thawed and immediately prepared for injections as described below (\nLepore et al., 2008b\n).\n\nHuman GRP Transplantation\nHuman GRPs were suspended (in basal medium) at a concentration of 7.5 \u00d7 10\n4\ncells/uL. After the completion of the transplantation session, cell viability was assessed using the trypan blue assay and was always found to be greater than 75%. Immune suppressed animals received transplants at 50-60 days of age. Animals were immune suppressed by intraperitoneal administration of FK-506/Rapamycin (1mg/kg/each; LC Laboratories; Woburn, MA) daily beginning five days before grafting and continuously until sacrifice. Each mouse received 2 grafts (bilaterally at C5) of 1.5\u00d710\n5\ncells/site (in 2\u03bcL basal media) into the ventral horn. Cells were delivered using a 10 \u03bcL Hamilton Gastight syringe with an attached 30-gauge 45\u00b0 beveled needle (Hamilton; Reno, NV). The injection pipette was secured to a manual micromanipulator (World Precision Instruments; Sarasota, FL) attached to an 80\u00b0 tilting base (\nLepore et al., 2008b\n). The tip was lowered to a depth of 0.75 mm below the surface of the cord and was held in place for 2 minutes before and after cell injection. Cells were delivered under the control of a microsyringe pump controller (World Precision Instruments) at a rate of 1\u03bcL/minute.\n\nAnimals\nTransgenic mice carrying the human SOD1 gene with the G93A mutation (B6SJL-Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J: Stock # 002726) or their wild-type B6SJL littermates were used . Male and female mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), and maintained as an in-house colony. On average, SOD1\nG93A\nmice developed clinical disease onset at 90 days of age and reached disease endstage at approximately 125 days of age (\nGurney et al., 1994\n). For all studies, equal numbers of males and females were included in all groups, and animals from the same litter were distributed amongst groups. All procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the guidelines set by the European Communities Counsel Directive (November 24th, 1986), the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Guidelines for the Use of Animals in Neuroscience Research and the Johns Hopkins University IACUC, and measures were taken to minimize any potential pain or animal discomfort. Mice were housed at standard temperature (21\u00b0C) and in a light controlled environment with \u201cad libitum\u201d access to the food and water, and were maintained in racks of ventilated cages. In order to avoid dehydration, Hydrogel packs were provided when animals started to show disease symptoms.\n\nTissue Processing\nAnimals were sacrificed at 90 days of age or at endstage for SOD1\nG93A\nmice with endstage defined as the inability to right themselves during a 30 second time window. Wild-type B6SJL littermates were sacrificed at either 90 days of age or at the same time as endstage SOD1\nG93A\nmice in order to obtain an age-matched set of wild-type mice. Mice were deeply anaesthetized and then transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.9% saline, followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (Fisher Scientific; Pittsburgh, PA). Spinal cords were removed from the animal, followed by cryoprotection in 30% sucrose (Fisher)/0.1 M phosphate buffer at 4\u00b0C for 3 days. The tissue was embedded in Tissue Freezing Media (Triangle Biomedical Sciences), fast frozen with dry ice, and stored at\n\u2212\n80\u00b0C until processed. Spinal cord tissue blocks were cut in transverse plane at 30 \u03bcm thicknesses. Sections were collected on glass slides and stored at\n\u2212\n20\u00b0C until analyzed. Subsets of spinal cord slices were collected in TBS for free-floating immunohistochemistry.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nTissue sections were blocked for 1 hr. in 10% goat serum with 0.3% triton-X, probed overnight with primary antibody at 4\u00b0C in 2% goat serum with 0.3% triton-X, washed in TBS and then incubated with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor, Life Technologies at 1:1000 or Jackson Immunoresearch at 1:200) for 2 hrs. at room temperature followed by further washing in TBS. Tissue sections were mounted with Prolong Gold with DAPI (Life Technologies). Primary antibodies used: Human nuclear antigen (HuNA) (Millipore #MAB1281, 1:100), Tuj1 (Covance #MRB-435P, 1:500), Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) (DAKO #Z0334, 1:400), GFAP (Millipore, #AB5541, 1:300), Human-specific GFAP (Stem Cells, Inc #STEM123, 1:500), Ki67 (Thermo Scientific #RM-9106, 1:400), and Olig2 (Millipore #AB9610, 1:500). Images were acquired on either a Zeiss fluorescence microscope using a Photometric Sensys KAF-1400 CCD camera (Roper Scientific) or on a Zeiss laser confocal microscope.\nTransplanted cells were localized by staining for human nuclear antigen (HuNA) antibody (to identify human cells in rat spinal cord). To estimate the total number of surviving cells, spinal cord sections were stained for HuNA and DAPI and mosaic images were acquired on a Zeiss fluorescence microscope to capture the entire mouse spinal cord section in one image. Every 6\nth\nsection was imaged throughout the entire rostral-caudal extent of the spinal cord where HuNA\n+\ncells were present. The images were converted to tif files for analysis using Adobe Photoshop CS5 to further magnify the images during the quantification process. In these sections, all HuNA\n+\n/DAPI\n+\ncells were counted. The total number of HuNA\n+\n/DAPI\n+\ncells from all sections was summed and multiplied by 6 to estimate the total number of surviving cells as we have described previously (\nLepore et al., 2008b\n,\nLepore et al., 2011\n).\nTo quantify the percentage of transplanted cells differentiating toward astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, the transplanted cells were identified by HuNA immunohistochemistry and double stained for either GFAP or Olig2. Images were acquired at the site of injection as well as 1 mm and 2 mm rostral and caudal from the site of injection for analysis. For the rostral-caudal distribution analysis, images were taken both rostral and caudal from the injection site and pooled together since our previous studies have shown no differences in differentiation at rostral versus caudal sites. For grey/white matter differentiation analysis, images were taken at the site of injection as well as 1 mm and 2 mm rostral and caudal from the injection site and pooled together. Immunohistochemistry for GFAP was used to delineate grey/white matter borders.\nImages were acquired at 20X magnification on a Zeiss confocal microscope as z-stacks which were converted to orthogonal projections which allowed for sufficient resolution for quantification purposes. The images were then converted to tif files for analysis using Adobe Photoshop CS5 to further magnify the images during the quantification process. For each image, the total number of double positive (HuNA\n+\nGFAP\n+\nor HuNA\n+\nOlig2\n+\n) cells was counted and divided by the total number of HuNA\n+\ncells per image to calculate the percentage of cells differentiating toward astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. The same process was used to quantify the percentage of proliferating cells using double labeling for HuNA and Ki67. Due to technical limitations of the antibody staining, separate spinal cord sections were used in some cases for HuNA\n+\nGFAP\n+\nand HuNA\n+\nOlig2\n+\nimmunohistochemistry, which accounts for about 5% of cells being double-counted. Six 20X images were acquired at the site of transplantation for analysis since the majority of cells resided at this site. For sites 1 mm and 2 mm rostral and caudal from the injection site, three 20X images were acquired at each site for analysis. For each group, 3-5 mice were analyzed.\n\nNanoString Analysis\nNanoString (NanoString Technologies, Inc., Seattle, WA,\nhttp://www.nanostring.com\n) analyses were performed for all groups at 90 days of age and endstage. NanoString probe design and sequence information has been previously described (\nHaidet-Phillips et al., 2014\n). Mice were perfused with ice-cold 0.9% saline, and spinal cord tissue was harvested and fast-frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was isolated using TRIzol, followed by DNase treatment and RNA cleanup using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany,\nhttp://www.qiagen.com\n). For analysis of gene expression by hGRPs\nin vitro\n, RNA was isolated from hGRPs at the time of transplantation using an identical method as described above. For the NanoString assay,100 ng of RNA was loaded per sample. All samples were normalized using internal positive controls and three housekeeping genes (B2M, GAPDH, and OAZ1) with human-specific probes. Gene expression was normalized using these human-specific housekeeping genes to discount any effects of increased proliferation of hGRPs in the endstage SOD1\nG93A\nspinal cord. Before normalization, all raw values reading less than 10 total counts were eliminated from analysis because they were under the standard limit of detection. Total counts, after normalization, were graphed. Raw counts prior to normalization are shown in\nSupporting Table 1\n. In terms of gene expression, a \u201ccount\u201d is referred to as a single molecule of mRNA transcript bound by the Nanostring\u00ae probes.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA,\nhttp://www.graphpad.com\n). Data in all graphs are represented as the mean +/\u2212 SEM. For immunohistochemistry analyses, 3-5 mice were analyzed per group. For NanoString analyses, 3-6 mice were analyzed per group. Data were analyzed by either one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test or by two-tailed t-test."

Prior to surgery, animals were randomly assigned to five groups: 1) Sham (n = 6), 2) Saline-treated only (Veh, n = 6), 3) bpV(pic) treated (n = 6), 4) GFP-SCs (n = 7), 5) bpV(pic) + GFP-SCs (n = 9). The experimental groups were established based on findings reported in previous publications testing the effects of bpV and SCs alone (\nWalker et al., 2012\n;\nWang and Xu, 2014\n). In these experiments, the injury only groups and the injury plus saline group showed no difference. Therefore, we used the injury plus saline group as the non-treatment control. This helped to reduce the number of animals necessary for the present study, and allow for an emphasis on the comparison of the three treatment groups, bpV, SCs, and bpV + SCs to each other and compared to injury and sham animals. Due to respiratory complications from surgery (n = 2) or inadequate contusion injury as recognized by rapid functional recovery (n =1), the final animal number for the study was 31 (Sham = 6, Veh = 5, bpV = 5, SCs = 7, bpV + SCs = 8). Final impactor displacement of the spinal cord was 2.02 \u00b1 0.21 mm and impact velocity was 0.47 \u00b1 0.02 m/s, indicating consistent contusive SCI among experimental animals.\nFigure 1. Experimental design and treatments for the bpV(pic)/GFP-SC combination study.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Time course and milestones of the experiment. (B) The structure of bpV(pic). (C) A photomicrograph of confluent pure GFP-SCs used for transplantation. Scale bar = 200 \u03bcm.\nFor surgical procedures, animals were anaesthetized intraperitoneally (IP) with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail ([87 mg/kg]/[12 mg/kg]), and received laminectomy only (sham operation) or unilateral cervical SCI performed as previously published (\nWalker et al, 2012\n). Briefly, the 5th cervical vertebra was stabilized with a customized device (\nZhang et al., 2004\n) and a partial unilateral laminectomy was performed to expose the right side of the cord. A moderate unilateral injury was produced using the NYU/MASCIS Impactor (\nGruner, 1992\n) (2.5 mm tip, 10g weight, 12.5 mm height) using previously published methods (\nGensel et al., 2006\n;\nWalker et al., 2012\n). Sham animals underwent surgery but did not receive injury. All animals received subcutaneous injection of 5 mL 0.9% saline for hydration and were monitored for 24 hours in housing with controlled temperature. Animals were returned to the campus animal housing facility under veterinarian-guided observation and care upon recovery. A laboratory animal technician assisted in animal care. All procedures and surgeries were approved under the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council) and the Guidelines of the Indiana University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nIntraspinal GFP-SC transplantation\nTransplantation of GFP-SCs was slightly modified from previously published methods (\nHu et al., 2013\n). Seven to eight days post-injury, GFP-SCs were harvested from culture flasks using 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA, washed and suspended in DMEM + 10% FBS on ice for cell transplantation. In preparation for transplantation, injured and sham rats were anesthetized using ketamine/xylazine and the surgical site was re-opened. Two groups of animals, SCs only and bpV + SCs, were designated for SC transplantation into the lesion cavity epicenter. The spine was stabilized as described, and cell suspension (1 \u00d7 10\n6\nGFP-SCs in 5 \u03bcl DMEM medium) was stereotaxically injected into to lesion epicenter at a depth of 1.2 mm through a glass micropipette with an outer diameter of 50\u201370 \u03bcm and beveled sharpened tip at a rate of ~1 \u03bcl/min. After injection, the pipette was left in place for 2 min to prevent cell leakage. Animals not receiving SC injection were surgically opened and the sham laminectomy or injury site exposed. Following surgery, animals were allowed to recover under conditions described for the initial surgical procedures.\n\nbpV(pic) administration\nGroups were randomly designated to receive intraperitoneal (IP) injections of bpV(pic) or 0.9% saline vehicle according to methods previously described (\nWalker et al, 2012\n). Briefly, 400 \u03bcg/kg/day bpV(pic) (Enzo Life Sciences, Inc., Farmingdale, NY) was injected IP beginning immediately after injury, 2 hours post-injury, and twice daily for 7 days following SCI. Ultimately, two groups received bpV(pic) and the rest, including sham animals, received IP injections of saline according to the described treatment schedule.\n\nBehavioral testing\nFor assessment of forelimb sensorimotor functional recovery, rats were provided flavored cereal rings in their home cage prior to and once per week for 11 weeks following injury (10 weeks after transplantation surgery) and tested as previously described (\nWalker et al. 2012\n). Briefly, the rats were scored on a 0 to 8 point scale, with 8 being the maximal score, according to their ability to support, grasp, and manipulate treats with the injured and non-injured forelimb while eating the treats. Coordinated treat manipulation was defined as obvious consistent coordinated handling of the treat by both forelimbs during eating. Three trials (rings) were scored and the average score was presented for each rat during a testing session. Two individuals blinded to the animals\u2019 conditions performed the test.\n\nLesion and spared tissue assessment\nTwelve weeks post-injury (11 weeks post-transplantation), all rats were given an overdose of ketamine/xylazine and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS. Spinal tissue was dissected and processed as previously described (\nLiu et al., 2006\n;\nWalker et al., 2012\n). In brief, a 1 cm segment of cervical cord including the injury epicenter was isolated, cryopreserved, and sectioned using a cryostat (Leica) at 20 \u03bcm thickness in the transverse or longitudinal horizontal planes on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific). Tissue was kept at \u221220\u00b0C until utilized. Cresyl violet acetate staining with eosin counterstaining (CVE) of sectioned tissue was used to aid in identification of the injury epicenter. Adjacent sections were processed as previously described for immunofluorescence labeling. Briefly, tissues were blocked for non-specific binding of antibody and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of reactive astrocytes and the glial scar (1:200, Sigma). To use a clearly defined lesion border, GFAP immunolabeling demarcated the interior and exterior of the lesion by the labeling of the glial scar interface. This interface served as the boundaries of the lesion, and the area interior to this interface was assessed as a measure of lesion area at the epicenter. As the inverse of this value, spared tissue was calculated as all area of the ipsilateral cord outside the internal glial scar interface.\n\nLesion cavity and ventral horn neuron quantification\nCVE staining was used to quantify the epicenter cavity area (\nFig. 4\n) and number of ventral horn neurons at and 2 mm rostral and caudal to the injury epicenter (\nFig. 5\n). Open cavities were traced using contour mapping in Neurolucida software (Microbrightfield, Inc., Williston, VT) to obtain cavity area. To quantify spared ventral horn neurons, a horizontal line was drawn across the transverse section passing through the central canal to establish a standard anatomical region for analysis. All identifiable ipsilateral neurons ventral to this line, exhibiting dark, evenly distributed cresyl violet staining, were manually quantified using Neurolucida software.\nFigure 4. bpV, SCs, used alone or in combination, reduced lesion cavity.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A\u2013D) Cresyl violet/eosin (CVE) staining shows cavities at the lesion epicenter in different groups. All three bpV and/or SC treatment groups (B\u2013D) showed marked reduction of lesion cavities as compared to the Vehicle-treated control (A). (E) The three treatment groups showed statistically significant reduction of lesion cavitation as compared to the Vehicle group, although no difference was found between these treatment groups. *,\np\n< 0.05; **,\np\n< 0.01. Scale bar = 1 mm.\nFigure 5. bpV and bpV + SCs increased the number of ventral horn neurons adjacent to the epicenter of injury.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Cresyl violet/eosin-stained cross sections cut at 2mm rostral, epicenter, and 2 mm caudal to the injury in groups received different treatments. Ventral horn neurons were clearly seen (right column). (B) Only bpV and bpV + SCs groups significantly increased the number of ventral horn neurons at 2 mm caudal to the lesion. *,\np\n< 0.05. Scale bar: 2 mm rostral & epicenter = 1mm; 2mm caudal = 250 \u03bcm.\n\nQuantification of the GFP-SC graft\nTo provide an estimation of the SC graft relation to the lesion, both GFP-labeling and CVE staining of transverse sections were used to identify the graft at the epicenter of injury, which corresponded to region of maximal graft area. At the epicenter, SC grafts, if present, were traced using contour mapping in Neurolucida for each transplanted animal in the SCs group and bpV + SCs group. The average SC graft area per group was determined, and was presented as mean absolute graft area at the lesion epicenter. The total area of the graft for each animal was also divided by the epicenter section lesion area, which provided a % SC graft size of lesion area.\n\nImmunofluorescence labeling\nImmunofluorescence double labeling was performed on sections prepared as described above and incubated with the following primary antibodies simultaneously with rabbit anti-GFAP (1:200): mouse anti-SMI31, a marker for axons (1:1000; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), and mouse anti-rat endothelial cell antigen-1 (RECA-1), a marker for rat vascular endothelium (1:200) (ABD Serotec, Inc., Raleigh, NC). The next day, sections were incubated with rhodamine-, fluoroisothiocyanate-, or AMCA-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab, West Grove, PA). Coverslips were mounted on the slides with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Pre-immune serum was used as a control to confirm the specificity of the antibody. Images were obtained with an Olympus BX60 epifluorescent microscope and Neurolucida software (Microbrightfield, Inc.).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nA two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t-test was used to determine statistical significance between two groups. Statistical significance between multiple groups was determined using a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc analysis if significance was established. For functional assessment and comparison between groups over time, a repeated-measures ANOVA was performed followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc analysis. All statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad, Inc., La Jolla, CA), with a\np\nvalue < 0.05 considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Mice\nHomozygous transgenic male mice expressing human mutant P301S tau (Tg P301S) under the control of the murine\nThy1\npromoter were used for this study. In humans, the presence of the P301S mutation in the Tau gene leads to a progressive tauopathy causing frontotemporal dementia (\nBugiani et al., 1999\n). This mouse model presents progressive tau pathology with the first tau deposits in homozygous mice appearing at 2\u00a0months of age and developing until the age of 5\u20136\u00a0months when the mice have to be culled due to their motor phenotype (\nAllen et al., 2002; Delobel et al., 2008\n). Age- and sex-matched C57BL/6S mice (Harlan, UK) were used as controls. Behavioral studies were performed in male mice at 1, 2 and 3\u00a0months of age, before the development of the overt motor phenotype (number of animals: 1\u00a0month: WT\nn\n=\u00a07, P301S\nn\n=\u00a09; 2\u00a0months: WT\nn\n=\u00a05, P301S\nn\n=\u00a07; 3\u00a0months: WT,\nn\n=\u00a06 P301S\nn\n=\u00a010). In order to ensure the specificity of the transgene effect in the behavioral deficit, heterozygous male Tg P301S mice (P301S Het) which start to develop tau pathology at the age of 7\u00a0months and have to be culled at the age of 14\u201315\u00a0months, were tested with their littermate controls at 3 and 7\u00a0months of age (number of animals: 3\u00a0months: WT\nn\n=\u00a06, P301S Het\nn\n=\u00a07; 7\u00a0months: WT\nn\n=\u00a08, P301S Het\nn\n=\u00a07). For AAV injection 8\u20139\u00a0week old male C57BL/6S mice (Harlan, UK) were used. Animals had unrestricted access to food and water, and were maintained on a 12\u00a0h light/dark cycle (lights off at 7:00\u00a0P.M.). All behavioral testing was conducted during the light phase of the cycle. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the UK Home Office Regulations for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.\n\nSpontaneous object recognition task\nThe spontaneous object recognition (OR) task was conducted as previously described for mice (\nRomberg et al., 2013\n), using a Y-shaped apparatus adapted for mice. The Y-apparatus had high, homogenous white walls constructed from Perspex to prevent the mouse from looking out into the room, thereby maximizing attention to the stimuli. One arm was used as the start arm, and the other two arms were used to display the objects (dimensions approximately 10\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0cm). All walls were 30\u00a0cm high, and each arm was 15\u00a0cm in length and 8\u00a0cm wide. A lamp illuminated the apparatus and a video camera was mounted 50\u00a0cm above the apparatus to record trials for analysis. All mice were habituated in three consecutive daily sessions in which they were placed in the start arm and left to explore the empty Y-apparatus for 5\u00a0min. The following test sessions were separated by a minimum of 48\u00a0h. Each test session consisted of a sample phase and a choice phase. In the sample phase, the animal was placed in the start arm and left to explore the two identical objects, which were placed on the end of two arms for 5\u00a0min. The choice phase followed after a delay of either 1\u00a0min or 3\u00a0h which the animal spent in the home cage. The choice phase was procedurally identical to the sample phase, except that one arm contained a novel object, whereas the other arm contained a copy of the object which was presented in the sample phase. An unused copy of the repeated object was used in order to avoid olfactory disturbance. Each animal received 2 test sessions for each delay. A different object pair was used for each session for a given animal, and the order of exposure to object pairs as well as the designated sample and novel objects for each pair were counterbalanced within and across groups. This test was performed 7\u00a0days after ChABC injections. The object exploration time was assessed from video recordings of the sample and choice phase. The direct nasal or head contacts only were regarded as an exploratory behavior. For the choice phase, a discrimination ratio was calculated by dividing the difference in exploration of the novel and familiar objects by the total object exploration time. Therefore, the discrimination ratio varies from 0 (equal exploration for novel and familiar objects) to 1 (exploration of the novel object only). The mean discrimination ratio across two test sessions was calculated for each animal. Group means were compared by ANOVA followed by Tukey post-hoc test with a significance level of\np\n<\u00a00.05, using GraphPad Prism version 5.0. A two-tailed\nt\n-test was used for two-group comparisons. (Number of mice for P301S homozygous study: P-nase\nn\n=\u00a016, ChABC\nn\n=\u00a013; Control: P-nase\nn\n=\u00a07, ChABC\nn\n=\u00a05; number of mice for P301S heterozygous study: P-nase\nn\n=\u00a04, ChABC\nn\n=\u00a04; Control: P-nase\nn\n=\u00a04, ChABC\nn\n=\u00a03; number of mice for the AAV-fpmax study: P-nase\nn\n=\u00a06, ChABC\nn\n=\u00a06; AAV-TauWT: P-nase\nn\n=\u00a06, ChABC\nn\n=\u00a06; AAV-P301S: P-nase\nn\n=\u00a06, ChABC\nn\n=\u00a06).\n\nChABC injections\nProtease-free ChABC (Seikagaku, Japan) or penicillinase (P-nase; Sigma-Aldrich, UK) as a non-relevant control enzyme was dissolved in 0.1% BSA to 50\u00a0U/ml of concentration and filtered through a 0.2\u00a0micron filter. Six injections in the PRh (3 per hemisphere, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcl with a speed of 0.2\u00a0\u03bcl/min) were performed stereotaxically under isoflurane anesthesia with a 10\u00a0\u03bcl Hamilton syringe and a 33 gauge needle at the following sites (in mm from bregma and the surface of skull): 1. anterior\u2013posterior (AP): \u2212\u00a01.8; lateral (L): \u00b1\u00a04.6; ventral (V): \u2212\u00a04.4, 2. AP: \u2212\u00a02.8; L: \u00b1\u00a04.8; V: \u2212\u00a04.3 and 3. AP: \u2212\u00a03.8; L: \u00b1\u00a04.8; V: \u2212\u00a03.8. The needle remained in place at the injection site for 3\u00a0min before being slowly withdrawn over 2\u00a0min.\n\nGeneration of adeno-associated virus (AAV: serotype 2/6) vectors\nHuman 4R0N cDNAs encoding wild-type and mutant P301S tau were each cloned into a pAAV shuttle vector harboring the AAV serotype 2 inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) and an expression cassette composed of the mouse PGK1 promoter, the human \u03b2-globin intron, a multiple cloning site (MCS) and the woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) (modified from Stratagene's pAAV-MCS vector using standard cloning procedures). Both tau inserts were generated by PCR from previously described pHA/Tau vectors (\nGoedert et al., 1989\n) using the following primers: Forward 5\u2032 CGA GTT CTC TCG AGG CCG CCA CCA TGG CTG AGC CCC GCC 3\u2032 and Reverse 5\u2032 CGA GTA CTA GAT CTT CAC AAA CCC TGC TTG GC 3\u2032. PCR products were digested by XhoI and BglII and subcloned into the MCS of pAAV shuttle vector (XhoI/BglII) to generate pAAV-PGK-TauWT-WPRE and pAAV-PGK-Tau P301S-WPRE vectors.\n\nProduction and titration of pseudotyped recombinant AAV2/6 vectors\nRecombinant AAV2/6 vectors were produced and purified as previously described (\nDusonchet et al., 2009\n). Briefly, AAV particles were generated by transient co-transfection of 293-AAV cells with pAAV shuttle vectors (bearing AAV2 ITRs) and a pDP6 helper plasmid (coding for AAV6 capsids) (\nGrimm et al., 2003\n) for 48\u00a0h. After collection, cells were lysed by three consecutive freeze/thaw cycles and AAV particles were purified on iodixanol density gradient followed by heparin affinity chromatography. Finally, AAV particles were eluted in sterile PBS and stored at \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C until use. Following purification each batch was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by a Coomassie staining to assess AAV purity. Infectious titers were determined as described previously (\nDusonchet et al., 2009\n) and expressed in transducing units (TU)/ml. For the present study, the following vectors were produced: AAV-TurboGFP (fpmax): 2.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n10\nTU/ml; AAV-TauWT: 1.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n10\nTU/ml; and AAV-P301S: 1.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n10\nTU/ml.\n\nStereotaxic injection of AAV vectors\nAAV vectors encoding human wild-type tau (AAV-TauWT) or mutant P301S tau (AAV-P301S) were used to generate a local tauopathy in the mouse PRh. AAV-TurboGFP (fpmax) was used as a control vector. To inject AAV2/6 vectors in the PRh, stereotaxic surgery was performed under isoflurane anesthesia in 8\u20139\u00a0weeks old male C57BL/6S mice (Harlan, UK). In order to cover a significant portion of the PRh, the vector suspension was bilaterally injected at 4 sites (2 sites per hemisphere, each site injected with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcl at a rate of 0.2\u00a0\u03bcl/min) using a microsyringe pump controller (Micro4, World Precision Instruments). The stereotaxic coordinates for the PRh used in this study were 1. AP: \u2212\u00a01.8\u00a0mm; L: \u00b1\u00a04.2\u00a0mm; V: \u2212\u00a04.0\u00a0mm and 2. AP: \u2212\u00a03.2\u00a0mm; L: \u00b1\u00a04.1\u00a0mm; V: \u2212\u00a03.8\u00a0mm. The needle remained in place at the injection site for 3\u00a0min before slow withdrawn over a period of 2\u00a0min. The total dose of vector injected in each animal was 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n7\nTU. Animals were subjected to spontaneous OR task at 1\u00a0month and 2\u00a0months post-injection of the vector. Number of mice: AAV-fpmax\nn\n=\u00a012, AAV-TauWT\nn\n=\u00a013, and AAV-P301S\nn\n=\u00a012.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAnimals were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1\u00a0M PBS, pH\u00a07.4. Brains were quickly dissected out and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 0.1\u00a0M PBS for at least 24\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Coronal brain sections (30\u00a0\u03bcm) were cut on a Leica SM2400 microtome (Leica Microsystems, Bucks, UK) and stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C in 0.1\u00a0M PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide. A monoclonal antibody NeuN (1:400, Millipore) was used for neuronal cell counting. AT8 (1:1000, Innogenetics) and PHF1 (1:500, a gift of Dr Peter Davies) were used to detect hyperphosphorylated forms of tau. The biotinylated\nWisteria floribunda\nagglutinin (WFA, 1:400, Sigma-Aldrich) was used to visualize PNNs. Labeling was performed by first rinsing tissue with 0.1\u00a0M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by quenching of endogenous peroxidase activity with 10% methanol, 3% H\n2\nO\n2\n, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBS-T) for 20\u00a0min at room temperature (RT). Sections were rinsed three times in PBS-T and were subsequently blocked with 5% normal goat serum (NGS) or normal horse serum (NHS), in PBS-T for 1\u00a0h at RT. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with the primary antibody diluted in PBS-T. Following 3 washes in PBS they were incubated for 2\u00a0h at RT with the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody (Vectastain; Vector Laboratories) diluted 1:1000 in PBS-T. The immunostaining was visualized with an avidin\u2013biotin system (Vectastain; Vector Laboratories) and 3\u2032,3\u2032diaminobenzidine as the chromogen (DAB kit; Vector Laboratories). Sections were then mounted on glass slides, examined using a light microscope and photographed using a digital camera (Leica DM6000 Microsystems).\n\nElectrophysiology\nAnimals were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. The brain was rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold cutting solution bubbled with 95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\ncontaining the following (in mM): 132.8 NaCl, 3.1 KCl, 1 CaCl\n2\n, 2 MgCl\n2\n, 1 K\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 4 NaHCO\n3\n, 5\nd\n-glucose, 0.01 glycine, 1 ascorbic acid, 0.5 myoinositol, 2 pyruvate, and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH\u00a07.35. A midsagittal section was made and the rostral part of one hemisphere was cut at 45\u00b0 to the dorsoventral axis (\nCho et al., 2000\n). The cerebellum was removed from the brain with a further caudal cut along the dorsoventral axis. The hemisphere was glued by its rostral end to a Vibratome stage (VT 1000S; Leica). Slices (350\u00a0\u03bcm) of PRh were taken in the region \u2212\u00a02.5\u00a0mm to \u2212\u00a04.0\u00a0mm rostral from bregma. Slices were stored submerged in bubbled, artificial CSF (20\u201325\u00a0\u00b0C, same composition as cutting solution, except 2\u00a0mM CaCl\n2\n, 1\u00a0mM MgCl\n2\n) for 2\u00a0h before the onset of recordings. A single slice was placed in an interface recording chamber superfused by artificial CSF (30\u00a0\u00b0C, flow rate 2\u00a0ml/min). Evoked field EPSPs (fEPSP) were recorded from layers II/III from directly below the rhinal sulcus (area 35). A stimulation electrode was placed in layer II/III on the temporal side (0.5\u00a0mm, area 36) of the recording electrode. Stimuli (0.1\u00a0ms duration) were delivered to the stimulation electrode at 0.1\u00a0Hz. Input/output curves were produced with stimulation intensities from 50 to 500\u00a0\u03bcA in steps of 50\u00a0\u03bcA. For monitoring baseline synaptic transmission before LTD induction, fEPSPs were reduced to 50\u201360% of the maximum amplitude and recorded for at least 30\u00a0min or until responses were stable (<\u00a020% amplitude change over 30\u00a0min), (Number of mice for the study: WT P-nase\nn\n=\u00a011, P301S P-nase\nn\n=\u00a011, P301S ChABC\nn\n=\u00a011). For LTD induction, 900 stimulus pairs (1\u00a0ms each, 20\u00a0ms). Subsequently, fEPSPs elicited by 0.1\u00a0Hz stimulation were recorded for further 60\u00a0min (number of mice for the study: WT P-nase\nn\n=\u00a07, P301S P-nase\nn\n=\u00a07, P301S ChABC\nn\n=\u00a06). Field potentials were amplified with a CyberAmp 320 (Molecular Devices), recorded and analyzed with custom-made software written in LabView (National Instruments). For offline LTD analysis, fEPSPs were averaged across 1\u00a0min and the peak amplitude of the mean fEPSP was expressed relative to the preconditioning baseline. Group means were statistically compared using either paired or unpaired\nt\ntests or repeated-measures (RM) ANOVA, followed by tests of simple main effects, if applicable.\n\nStereology\nFor stereological counting of neurons, pathological tau or PNN-positive cells, brain sections were stained with NeuN, AT8 or WFA, respectively. Immunolabeling of each antibody was revealed using 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) and coverslips were applied using DPX mounting medium. Stereology was performed using an Olympus microscope with the stereological software StereoInvestigator (MBF Bioscience). A total number of 5\u20136 sections per animal (\nn\n=\u00a05\u20136 mice for each group), taken every 12th brain sections were used for immunohistochemistry. The whole brain section was first highlighted at 4\u00d7 objective and PRh contour was outlined. Sample counting windows were identified using the computer software. The number of sample counting windows was normally between 15\u00a0 and 20. The number of NeuN, AT8 or WFA-positive cells in each window was counted at 40\u00d7 magnification. The counting frame and the counting grid were set by the operator; 40\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a040\u00a0\u03bcm and 200\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0200\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively. Movements among counting frames of each grid were controlled by a motorized x\u2013y microscope stage. Cells located inside the counting frame or touching its top or right borders only were counted. For the Z calibration, the tissue thickness at every counting frame was determined and the mean of sections thickness was taken into account for calculating the total number of cells. The total number of NeuN, AT8 or WFA-positive cells was calculated using the following equation:\nN\n=\n\u2211\nQ\n\u2212\n\u22c5\nt\nh\n\u22c5\n1\na\ns\nf\n\u22c5\n1\ns\ns\nf\nasf\narea sampling fraction\nH\nheight of counting space\nQ\n\u2212\nnumber of object\nssf\nsection sampling fraction\nt\nthickness of the section.\n\nSarkosyl insoluble tau extraction\nP-nase or ChABC was stereotaxically injected into C57BL/6S wild-type and P301S mice as described in the\nChABC injections\nsection. After 2\u00a0weeks from the injection, the mice were culled by cervical dislocation and brains were excised for sarkosyl-insoluble tau preparation, which was performed as previously described (\nAllen et al., 2002; Delobel et al., 2008\n) with a slight modification. Brain tissues containing mouse PRh were homogenized in ice with the electronic tissue grinder (IKA\u00ae ULTRA-TURRAX\u00ae dispersers, Germany) in 10-fold volume of A68 buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl pH\u00a07.4, 0.8\u00a0M NaCl, 1\u00a0Mm EGTA and 10% sucrose) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The homogenates were centrifuged at 2000\ng\nfor 10\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C to remove membranes. Aliquot of the supernatant was used to quantify proteins. Samples were centrifuged again at 18,000\ng\nfor 30\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and then supernatant was collected into a new tube. The pellet was resuspended in 5-fold volume of A68 buffer by vortexing and was subjected to a second centrifugation at 18,000\ng\nfor 30\u00a0min. The first and second supernatants were pooled and then incubated with 1% N-Lauryl-Sarkosyl for 1\u00a0h at RT and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 70,000\ng\nfor 1\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C (Optima\u2122 Max Ultracentrifuge, Beckman Coulter, UK). The pellet was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) and denatured for 15\u00a0min at 95\u00a0\u00b0C and loaded in the gel. The remaining amount was stored at \u2212\u00a020\u00a0\u00b0C until further use. (Number of mice for the study: Control: P-nase\nn\n=\u00a02, ChABC\nn\n=\u00a02; P301S: P-nase\nn\n=\u00a04, ChABC\nn\n=\u00a04).\n\nProtein quantification\nTotal protein concentration of brain homogenate was measured using the bicinchoninic-acid (BCA) assay (Pierce, Thermo Scientific, UK). Absorbance was read at 562\u00a0nm using a BioTek \u03bcQuant microplate reader. Protein concentration was determined by calculation from the standard curve using Excel software 2007 (Microsoft).\n\nWestern blot analysis of sarkosyl-insoluble tau\nProteins were separated by electrophoresis on NuPAGE\u00ae Bis\u2013Tris precast gel (Novex\u00ae, Life Technologies\u2122) at 120\u00a0V for 90\u00a0min, and then transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore Corporation) at 30\u00a0mA for 150\u00a0min. Non-specific background of membranes was blocked with incubation for 1\u00a0h at RT in TBS-T (10\u00a0mM Tris/HCl pH\u00a07.8, 100\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) plus 5% (w/v) non-fat milk, and then washed three times with TBS-T. Membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-human tau polyclonal antibody (1:2000, DAKO), phosphorylation dependent anti-tau monoclonal antibody AT8 (1:1000, Innogenetics) or anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and then washed three times with TBS-T. This was followed by incubation with donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (1:5000, GE Healthcare UK Ltd.) for 2\u00a0h at RT. This was followed by three washes with TBS-T. All the antibody dilutions were prepared in 1% non-fat milk in TBS-T and the duration of each wash step was 10\u00a0min. The proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce\u00ae ECL Western blotting substrate, Thermo Scientific, UK) and recorded by\nchemiluminescence imaging system\n(UVITEC Cambridge, UK)."

    "Methods": "Animal Use\nAnimal procedures were approved by the University of Chicago Animal Care and Use Committee, and were conducted in accordance with the guidelines published in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (2011). Wistar rats were obtained from Charles River.\nWe model SD (i.e., MwA) in hippocampal slice cultures and translate the findings to the\nin vivo\ncondition using neocortical SD in rats. The rationale of this strategy is based on the fact that SD is a well-conserved neural circuit phenomenon that has been demonstrated in a wide array of grey matter structures and in a wide range of animal species\n8\n,\n19\n,\n20\nIn each instance, the defining electrical characteristics of SD are analogous. Furthermore, microenvironmental conditions in hippocampal slice cultures can be accurately controlled, the cultures are long-lived, and they retain a functionally intact tri-synaptic loop. Thus, the consequences of synaptically-induced SD (as well as interventions to prevent SD) can be studied for days to weeks after SD induction. Also, these cultures retain a neurovascular unit,\n21\nneuronal vitality after SD,\n22\nand quiescent astrocytic\n23\nand microglial states,\n24\n\u2013\n28\nas well as astrocytic and microglial reactivity to SD\n24\n,\n26\n\u2013\n28\nand pro-inflammatory cytokine changes\n11\nlike those seen\nin vivo\n. Of special importance to our work here, SD in hippocampal slice cultures induces OS like that seen in the neocortex after SD. Furthermore, abrogation of OS by pretreatment with insulin-like growth factor-1\n14\nor interleukin-11\n28\nequivalently abrogates SD in hippocampal slice cultures\nin vitro\nand neocortex\nin vivo\n.\n28\n,\n29\n\nCulture preparation and maintenance\nWhile brain slice cultures are a well-accepted biological preparation used to model neurological disease\nin vitro\n, their use for SD/migraine research has lagged behind, perhaps due to difficulties in reproducibly evoking SD in slice cultures. Our lab has overcome this impediment and established a long-lived and highly reproducible model of SD in hippocampal slice cultures, in part, by allowing cultures to mature\nin vitro\n.\nHippocampal brain slice cultures are especially well-suited as an\nin vitro\nmodel to study the reaction of neural tissue to brain disease. Although they are deafferented, hippocampal slice cultures show typical regional and cellular form and function, consistent with those observed\nin vivo\n. Importantly, microenvironmental conditions in slice cultures can be accurately controlled over extended periods of time. For these reasons, we used hippocampal slice cultures for proof-of-principle studies that were then translated to the\nin vivo\ncondition.\nWe have detailed the specifics of how to grow, maintain, and elicit SD in mature hippocampal brain slice cultures elsewhere.\n28\nThese methods involve enhanced prenatal care\n28\n,\n30\n\u2013\n32\nand, once cultures reach maturity, maintenance in a serum-free medium to avoid confounding effects of serum constituents. When evoking SD, serum-free medium gassed with 5% carbon dioxide/balanced air was used in lieu of the standard Ringer\u2019s solution gassed with excessive levels of oxygen, which would promote epileptiform behavior.\n22\nUntimed pregnant Wistar female rats (12 total pregnant female rats, ten pups per litter; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were single-housed with Enviro-dri paper bedding (Shepherd Specialty Paper, Hubbard, OR) and Nestlets (#NES3600; Ancare, Bellmore, NY). We prepared 350 \u00b5m hippocampal slice cultures from Wistar rat pups (P9-P10) of either sex. Slice cultures were initially maintained in a horse serum-based medium,\n33\nthen transferred to serum-free medium after 18 days\nin vitro\n, and used for experiments between 21\u201335 days\nin vitro\n.\n13\n,\n14\n,\n17\n,\n18\n,\n24\n,\n28\n\u2013\n32\nSlice cultures were tested at 21 days\nin vitro\nand showed \u2265 95% vitality\n28\n,\n30\n,\n31\nas evidenced by the dead cell marker Sytox (#S-34860; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).\n22\nSeveral steps in our use of hippocampal slice cultures are important to reliably evoke SD in this preparation. First, we enrich the environment of pregnant rats. This enhances slice culture vitality from 80\u201385% to \u2265 95%.\n32\n,\n34\n,\n35\nSecond, we allow cultures to mature\nin vitro\nfor at least 21 days before use, as opposed to using them at 8\u201313 days. This prevents triggering spreading depolarizations or seizures,\n34\n,\n35\nwhich would preclude induction of SD. Third, cultures are initially grown in serum-supplemented medium and then transferred to a serum-free medium after 18 days\nin vitro\n. Fourth, we have shown that cultures require at least 15 mM glucose.\n22\nOur habit is to use 42 mM glucose, as originally described for preparation of brain slice cultures.\n33\nFifth, we do not expose cultures to oxygen levels above that found in room air (~21%), as this tends to provoke seizures which prevents induction of SD.\n22\nSixth, we do not use penicillin/streptomycin since this antibiotic combination, provokes seizure activity,\n22\nwhereas, gentamycin does not. Seventh, physiological recordings (as well as all manipulations) are completed while cultures are exposed to serum-free medium, not Ringer\u2019s, since the latter reduces culture vitality if used for extended periods. Eight, our serum-free medium contains glutathione, in addition to cysteine, glycine and glutamate which are essential to maintain cellular glutathione levels. The medium also contains ascorbate and tocopherols and the antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, as noted in the work of Grinberg and coworkers from our lab (Gemini BioProducts Material Data Safety Sheet; Brewer\net al\n., 1993).\n13\n,\n14\n\nExperimental manipulations in slice cultures\nSpreading depression\nSD was induced in a static, interface-recording configuration as previously described.\n13\n,\n14\n,\n17\n,\n24\n,\n28\nAll recordings were made at the genu of the CA3 interstitial pyramidal neuron area using 2\u20134 \u00b5m tip diameter micropipettes filled with 150 mM sodium chloride. First, the normalcy of slice electrophysiological behavior was confirmed by monitoring the interstitial field potential responses to bipolar dentate gyrus electrical stimulation (100 \u00b5s pulses at \u2264 0.2 Hz and 5\u201320 \u00b5A). Slices with CA3 field post-synaptic responses \u2265 3mV were used for experiments.\nSecond, SD was induced by a uniform injection of current [i.e., 10 pulses, 10 Hz (100 \u00b5s/pulse)] at 1,000 uA (i.e., 1,000 nC) as previously described.\n13\nWe have established the typical threshold of current delivery needed to evoke slice culture SD in prior experiments.\n13\n,\n28\nFor example, threshold was determined by progressively doubling the amount of applied current [10 pulses, 10 Hz (100 \u00b5s/pulse)] beginning with that needed to trigger a half-maximal field potential response from a single stimulus. Currents for SD threshold were applied no faster than once every three minutes and ranged from 10\u201310,000 \u00b5A (10\u201310,000 nC). The latter current was the highest we were able to apply and does not necessarily indicate a current that successfully induced SD (i.e., SD threshold). This stimulation strategy was used for experiments reported in\nFigure 2C\n.\n13\n,\n28\nAs reported previously,\n14\nwe chose a non-injurious and uniform ~10-fold increase in current injection of 1,000 uA (i.e., 1,000 nC) as a stereotypic stimulus to reliably trigger recurrent SD.\nFigure 2. T cells in slice cultures produced IFN\u03b3 which acutely reduced spreading depression threshold.\nOpen in a new tab\nConfocal fluorescence image showing immunostaining of T cells\n(A)\nin parenchyma of hippocampal slice cultures with CD6, a pan T cell marker.

Numerical data are mean \u00b1 SEM and comparisons between groups made via ANOVA plus Holm-Sidak\npost hoc\ntesting.\nFor experiments in\nFigure 1\n,\nTable 1\nand\nFigure 3\n, six SDs were triggered every 7\u20139 minutes over an hour to elicit robust SD-related responses. As previously noted,\n14\nwe use a repetitive epoch of SDs to model high frequency and chronic migraine in order to replicate the hyperexcitable phenotype seen in the brain of migraineurs.\n36\n\u2013\n40\nFigure 1.

T cells/IFN\u03b3 and sphingomyelinase activity are responsible for loss of myelin basic protein following spreading depression.\nOpen in a new tab\nWestern blot analysis of MBP was used to determine changes in myelin following various treatments of slice cultures. IFN\u03b3 exposure triggered a significant (*\np\n= 0.04) decline in MBP, a loss that was significantly enhanced (*\np\n< 0.001) by co-incubation with TNF\u03b1 (100 ng/mL)\n(A)\n. Removal of T cells from slice cultures at seven days\nin vitro\nby exposure to anti-CD4 (\u03b1CD4) did not alter MBP levels when measured at 21 or more days\nin vitro\n(B)\n. However, removal of T cells abrogated the decrease in MBP seen one day after SD. Pharmacological inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase-2 by GW4869 prevented the loss of MBP otherwise seen one day after SD or exposure to IFN\u03b3\n(C)\n. Numerical data are mean \u00b1 SEM and comparisons between groups made via ANOVA plus Holm-Sidak\np ost hoc\ntesting.\nControl slice cultures were placed in electrophysiological recording unit for one hour, with evoked standard field potentials instead of SD.\nT cell lymphocyte depletion\nT cells in slice cultures were depleted via incubation with a neutralizing dose (10 \u00b5g/mL) of anti-CD4 (mouse anti-rat; clone OX-38; isotype IgG2a) antibody (#MCA372G; AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK) at nine days\nin vitro\nfor three days. Control cultures were treated with mouse IgG2a isotype control (#MG2a00; Invitrogen). T cell ablation was confirmed by immunostaining slices for presence of CD6-positive cells (see below) versus isotype control-treated cultures. Slice viability was assessed prior to use at 21 days\nin vitro\n, using the dead-cell fluorescent marker Sytox as previously described.\n22\nAnti-CD4 treatment did not elicit any evidence of neural cell death (data not shown).\nInterferon gamma treatment\nRecombinant rat IFN\u03b3 (#585-IF; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used at a physiological dose of 500 U/mL (0.5 \u00b5L/mL). 500 U/mL did not result in any evidence of cell injury in slice cultures as measured via Sytox, yet was a sufficient stimulus to initiate an adaptive response.\n41\nSlices were exposed to IFN\u03b3 for the indicated amounts of time, then fixed for immunostaining or harvested for protein extraction.\nNeutral sphingomyelinase-2 inhibition\nGW4869 (#567715; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), a specific nSMase2 inhibitor, was used at 10 \u00b5M in recording medium.\n42\nFor determination of MBP changes after SD, slices were pre-incubated with GW4869 for one hour, followed by induction of six SDs in normal medium. The slices were then returned to GW4869-containing serum-free medium for 24 hours before being harvested for protein extraction. For evaluation of MBP levels after stimulation with IFN\u03b3, cultures were pre-incubated with GW4869 for one hour then transferred to serum-free medium containing both GW4869 and IFN\u03b3 (500 U/mL) for 24 hours. Slices were then washed and transferred to GW4869-containing serum-free medium for one day before harvest for protein extraction.\n\nElectron microscopy\nFixative for electron microscopy (EM) as previously described\n30\n,\n31\nconsisted of the following: 4% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Slice cultures were fixed at room temperature for 10 minutes followed by overnight fixation at 4\u00b0C before embedding and sectioning. Whole animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (80 mg/kg and 7.5mg/kg respectively, delivered by intraperitoneal injection) and euthanized by intracardiac perfusion with room temperature solutions of 0.1 mL 0.05% EDTA/saline, followed by 250mL of saline and finally 250 mL of EM fixative. Brains were removed and post-fixed at room temperature for 10 minutes followed by overnight fixation at 4\u00b0C before embedding and sectioning. EM for visualization of myelin sheath integrity was performed from slice cultures sectioned perpendicular to Schaffer collateral and CA1 output axons at CA3, and rat brains were sectioned at a 45 degree angle to the vertical of the transverse axis at the paramedian neocortex (~ 4 mm caudal to Bregma). Images were acquired using the University of Chicago Electron Microscopy Core Facility, and the extent of myelin disruption was quantified (i.e., the number of cells with myelin disrupted per total cells counted).\n\nGene expression studies\nTissue collection\nSamples were collected and processed as previously described.\n43\n,\n44\nBriefly, slice culture inserts were submerged in 3 mL RNA\nlater\n(#AM7021; Ambion, Carlsbad, CA). The CA3 hippocampal region was dissected out of slices with a glass knife (#10100-00; Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA), and harvested in 1 mL of cold sterile PBS in RNase/DNase free 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. PBS supernatant was then removed and slices resuspended in 500 \u00b5L of cold TRIzol reagent (#15596026; Ambion). Samples were incubated for five minutes at room temperature, then used immediately or stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Total RNA isolation was performed using a combination of TRIzol and Qiagen\u2019s RNeasy Micro Kit columns (#74004; Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Quantification of RNA was performed using RiboGreen (#R-11491; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\nqPCR\nInflammatory cytokine expression after SD versus control was assayed via PCR arrays directed against a focused panel of genes involved in inflammation (RT\n2\nProfiler\u2122 PCR Array #PARN-011A, PARN-021A; SABiosciences, Frederick, MD) run on a real-time iCycler\u2122 PCR platform (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized using RT\u00b2 first strand kit (#C-03; SABiosciences), and real-time PCR was performed using SuperArray RT\n2\nSYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (#330510; SABiosciences). Thermocycling protocol was as follows: 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of amplification at 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 60 seconds. Melting curves were run for all plates. Relative gene expression normalized to ribosomal protein L13a (Rpl13a) was calculated using the RT\n2\nProfiler PCR Array Data Analysis version 3.4 software (SABiosciences). Fold changes of greater than two were taken to be significant.\n43\n\u2013\n45\nFor assaying IFN\u03b3 in slice cultures, which contain ~50 T cells each, cDNA was pre-amplified using the RT\n2\nPreAMP cDNA (#PBR-011A; SABiosciences) and a real-time rat IFN\u03b3 primer assay (#PPR45050C; SABiosciences).\n\nImmunohistochemical and histochemical staining\nSlice cultures were fixed and processed for immunohistochemical staining as previously described\n43\nwith few modifications. Briefly, slices were fixed overnight in periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde fixative.\n46\nThe next day, slices were rinsed in PBS and then incubated in 95% acetic acid/5% ethanol for 20 minutes. Negative controls in all experiments excluded incubation with the primary antibody. After blocking in 10% goat serum (#16201-064; Gibco, Grand Island, NY), slice cultures were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. After 3 rinses in PBS, slices were incubated in secondary antibody for one hour at room temperature and staining was visualized with 3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine (#D8001-1G; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), cleared and coverslipped using Permount (#SP15100; Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ). Sections were stained using anti-MBP (#18-0038; Zymed), or anti-IFN\u03b3 (#ARC4033; Invitrogen), followed by the appropriate HRP conjugated secondary antibody [anti-rabbit (#\nG21234\n; Invitrogen) and anti-mouse (#\nG21040\n; Invitrogen), respectively]. For IFN\u03b3 staining, slice cultures were pre-treated with lipopolysaccharide (10 \u00b5g/mL x 24 hours; #L4774; Sigma) to stimulate T cells.\nMBP immunostaining was quantified using digital imaging strategies to assess integrated optical density.\n46\nThe area of interest was restricted to the CA3 pyramidal neuron layer as illustrated in\nFigure 2\n, but using bright field illumination with details described below for glutathione quantification.\nT cell fluorescent immunohistochemical staining followed the same procedures as above, staining with anti-CD6 (#MCA339R; AbD Serotec; a pan T cell marker) followed by fluorescent secondary antibody (#A-11001, Goat anti-mouse IgG; Invitrogen). Slides were coverslipped using ProLong Gold Antifade reagent (#\nP36930\n; Invitrogen).\nMicroglia were labeled after fixation with 10% phosphate buffered formalin (#SF100-4; Fisher Scientific) using the fluorophore-tagged isolectin-GS-IB\n4\n(#\nI21411\nfrom Griffonia simplicifolia, Alexa Fluor\n\u00ae\n488 conjugate; Invitrogen).\n24\n\nWestern blots\nExpression of MBP in hippocampal slice culture samples was evaluated using standard SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting procedures. Briefly, equal amounts of total protein (20 \u00b5g) hippocampal slice culture homogenates were loaded to SDS-PAGE gels for separation, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunolabeled for MBP (#NBP1-05203; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) with \u03b2-actin (#A5316; Sigma-Aldrich) as a loading control. \u03b2-actin was chosen as a loading control, as its protein levels do not change with spreading depression (unpublished observation). Blots were visualized by standard chemiluminescence and densitometric quantification performed with Quantity One 1-D Analysis Software (#170\u20139600; Bio-Rad). MBP was quantified using all three bands: 21.5, 18.5, and 17.2 kDa.\n\nOxidative stress quantification\nCellROX Deep Red Reagent (#\nC10422\n; Invitrogen), a cell-permeant fluorogenic probe, was used as previously described to assess OS.\n13\n,\n14\nSlices were exposed to IFN\u03b3 (500 U/mL \u00d7 12 hours) as an initial OS-producing stimulus, then incubated for one hour with CellROX (acute OS response). CellROX fluorescence intensity was quantified via digital imaging strategies as described below. A standardized area of interest at the CA3 pyramidal neuron layer was used for all quantifications.\n\nProtein carbonyl quantification\nA Protein Carbonyl Content Assay Kit (#ab126287; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was used according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol for measurement of protein carbonylation as a readout of OS in rat brains after whole animal SD. Briefly, protein was extracted from the neocortex of animals exposed to KCl-induced SD or controls using RIPA buffer as previously described.\n30\nProtein homogenate was treated with Streptozocin to remove any nucleic acid contaminates and reacted with 2, 4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine, followed by quantification of the acid hydrazones at 405 nm. BCA assays (#23225; ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) were simultaneously run and a standard curve constructed for the calculation of protein carbonyl content based on optical density.\n\nGlutathione quantification\nThiolTracker (#\nT10095\n; Invitrogen) is a fluorescent dye that reacts with reduced thiols in intact cells and thus is an excellent marker for glutathione, which is the most prevalent cellular thiol.\n47\nProcedures for staining followed those of the manufacturer, modified for use with hippocampal slice cultures. ThiolTracker was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (2 mM) and used at 20 \u00b5M in a thiol-free solution. Briefly, cultures inserts were dipped into three separate 60 mm culture dishes containing 10 mL/each of Gey\u2019s balanced salt solution [(#G9779; Sigma) supplemented with 7.25 mL 45% glucose (#G8769; Sigma)] to remove extracellular thiols. Inserts containing cultures were then incubated in Gey\u2019s supplemented with glucose and containing ThiolTracker pre-equilibrated to normal incubation conditions which was continued for 30 minutes. Inserts were then washed again as described above and fixed in 10% phosphate buffered formalin at 4\u00b0C overnight, mounted, and coverslipped as described above for fluorescence immunostaining procedures.\nGlutathione was quantified using a self-calibrating sensitive CCD digital imaging system consisting of a QuantEM-512SC camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ), electronic shutter (Lambda SC Smart Shutter; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA), standard 100 watt Hg light on a DMIRE2 inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL) at 20x gain. A standardized area of interest at the CA3 pyramidal neuron layer was used for all quantifications. Resultant digital images were thresholded to a range applied to all images and the average optical intensity registered using MetaMorph software (ver. 7.5.4.0; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).\nRepresentative confocal images of control microglia-ThiolTracker staining were acquired using a Leica TCS SP5 II AOBS laser scanning confocal microscope (University of Chicago Integrated Microscopy Core Facility). Imaging section thickness was 772 nm to reduce potential cell body overlap. Images were acquired at 63x gain (1024 \u00d7 1024 pixels @ 12-bit). Alexa Fluor\n\u00ae\n594 tagged isolectin excitation/emission parameters were 561/576\u2013655 nm and while those for ThiolTracker were 488 nm/510\u2013533 nm.\n\nWhole animal electrophysiology\nWhole animal SD recordings were completed using aseptic techniques, as previously described\n46\n,\n48\n,\n49\nand recently updated.\n28\nBriefly, male Wistar (300\u2013400 gm) rats were anesthetized with isoflurane in oxygen (5% induction, 3% during surgical procedures, and 2\u20133% during recordings) via an inhalational mask and mounted in a standard table-top nose clamp with ear bars and kept warm with an overhead infrared lamp to keep core temperature at 37\u00b0C. Eyes were coated with Artificial Tears (#17478-062-35; Akorn, Lake Forest, IL) and the head shaved and cleansed with Betadine (Purdue Pharma, Stamford, CT). Next, 0.05 mL Bupivacaine (#0409\u20134272-01; Hospira, Lake Forest, IL) was injected subcutaneously to both sides of the surgical site, and a midline scalp incision was made from just behind the eyes to the lambdoid suture area. Two 1\u20132 mm craniotomies were made: a stimulation craniotomy at \u22122.0 mm from Bregma and 1.5 mm to the left of the sagittal suture, and a recording craniotomy at \u22126.0 mm from Bregma and 4.5 mm lateral to the sagittal suture. Craniotomies were performed under saline cooling and without damaging the underlying dura.\nAnesthetized animals were then transferred to a stereotaxic recording setup where gaseous anesthesia (1.5\u20132.0% isoflurane remainder oxygen), oxygen monitoring, and warming were continued. The skull was warmed (37\u00b0C) directly with sterile saline superfusion. For interstitial DC recordings, a 2\u20134 \u00b5m tip microelectrode was placed 750 \u00b5m below the pial surface with a Canberra micromanipulator (Narishige, Long Island, NY) and recordings begun using an Axoprobe A1 amplifier system and Digidata 1440A analog-digital conversion board. For KCl-induced SD threshold measurements, a microelectrode with tip broken to 8\u201312 \u00b5m (1.0 mm outside diameter, 0.58 mm inside diameter; Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) and filled with 0.5M KCl was positioned 750 \u00b5m below the pial surface. Micro-injections of KCl were administered via pressure from a Picospritzer-II electronic valve system (Parker, Hollis, NH), whose injection periods were registered directly to the permanent digital recording of SD induction.\nIn prior experiments, injection electrodes were raised immediately after SD induction and moved into a microscope slide with depression wells (ThermoFisher Scientific) filled with light 3-In-ONE oil (WD-40 Company, San Diego, CA). KCl injections were then repeated into oil and volumes calculated from diameter measured using a compound microscope fitted with an optical micrometer within an eye piece.\n28\n,\n29\nHere, we increased this nL volume by 2\u20133 fold to reliably evoke six SDs. Right neocortex, which did not experience SD, was used for control measurements.\n\nNeutral Sphingomyelinase Assay\nnSMase2 activity in rat brain was determined using a Neutral Sphingomyelinase Assay Kit (#K-1800; Echelon, Salt Lake City, UT) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, brain tissue was homogenized in cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl and 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Samples were diluted to 250ng/\u00b5L and 100\u00b5L (25 \u00b5g) was incubated with Reaction Mixture (5x Enzyme Mix, DAOS, Sphingomyelin, Choline Oxidase, Sphingomyelin Reaction Buffer [0.05 M Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.66 mM CaCl\n2\n, pH 7.4]) at 37\u00b0C with agitation for four hours, then read at 595 nm. Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism (v.6.0; GraphPad Software, Inc. San Diego, CA).\n\nStatistical methods\nData were analyzed using SigmaPlot software (v. 12.5; Systat Software, San Jose, CA). All data were subject to normality testing (\np\n-value to reject: 0.05), equal variance testing (\np\n-value to reject: 0.05), and power (1-\u03b2: > 0.8). Controls in each experiment were set to 1.0 with experimental data scaled proportionally to better allow inter-experiment comparisons. Molecular biological data (mRNA and Western blot protein) analyses included two technical replicates per experimental measurement. All experimental groups consisted of biological replicates of\nn\n\u2265 3. All experimental samples were compared to age-matched controls (or contralateral neocortical controls). Statistical tests are noted in the figure legends."

    "Methods": "2.1 SC Harvest and Isolation\nMuscle and cutaneous nerve-derived SCs were collected from adult male Lewis rat muscle and cutaneous femoral nerve branches as previously described (\nJesuraj et al., 2012\n). Femoral muscle branches were used to harvest muscle SCs as opposed to pure ventral motor roots in order to provide a clinically accessible cell source. To isolate the SCs, nerve branches were placed in Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with 1% Collagenase (Fischer, Pittsburgh, PA) and 2.5% Tryspin-EDTA (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Branches were centrifuged for 5 min at 130 g, supernatant removed, and then washed 3\u00d7 with SC medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM), Invitrogen; 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; 1% antibiotic antimitotic (ABAM), Invitrogen). Cells were then plated onto 10 \u03bcg/mL poly-L-lysine (PLL; Sigma Aldrich) coated 100 mm Petri dishes (Corning) with SC media. Cell proliferation was stopped at day 2 with 10 \u03bcM cytosine-beta-arabino furanoside HCl (Ara-C; Sigma-Aldrich) and fibroblasts were removed from culture at day 6 through complement killing using Thy1.1 antibody (Serotec, Raleigh , NC) and rabbit complement (Sigma Aldrich). Fresh media was supplied with 20 \u03bcg/mL pituitary extract (Biomedical Tech, Stoughton, MA) and 2 \u03bcM forskolin (Sigma Aldrich) to promote SCs proliferation. Complement killing was performed at all subsequent passages to remove any surviving fibroblasts and all experimental procedures were performed with SCs between passages 2 and 4.\n\n2.2 Motor and Sensory Neuron Isolation\nMotor and sensory neurons were harvested from embryonic day 15/16 Sprague-Dawely rat spinal cords and dorsal root ganglia, respectively, as previously described (\nGingras et al., 2007\n;\nGraber and Harris, 2013\n). Sprague-Dawley rat neurons were used in co-culture with the Lewis rat-derived SCs to approximate the response of axons to allogeneic SCs similar to what is used for cell transplantation therapies. Briefly, dorsal root ganglia were collected and dissociated for 30 min with 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA at 37\u00b0C. After which, the cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 240\ng\nand resuspended in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen). Cells were pipetted through a 10 \u03bcm cell sieve and 40 \u03bcm sieve, where the cells that passed through the sieve were discarded as glia and cells that remained within the sieve were collected for neurons. Motor neurons were isolated from the spinal cord as previously described (\nGingras et al., 2007\n;\nLeach et al., 2011\n). Briefly, the spinal cords were dissociated in 0.25% Trypsin in L-15 medium for 40 min at 37\u00b0C. The cords were then allowed to settle and the supernatant was replaced with DMEM:F12 (3:1) media supplemented with 4 \u03bcg/mL of DNase I (Sigma Aldrich). The cords were mechanically dissociated at this point with a Pasteur pipette and the mixture was placed onto a 4 mg/mL BSA cushion and centrifuged at 100\ng\nfor 10 min. The pellet was collected and resuspended in the DMEM:F12/DNase I media and placed on a 7.42% Nycoprep density gradient (Axis Shield, Cosmo Bio USA) The gradient was centrifuged at 500\ng\nfor 20 min and the cell solution at the interface of the Nycoprep and media was collected. This cell solution was also pipetted through the cell sieves as described above and the motor neurons were collected.\n\n2. 3 Microdevice Fabrication\nThe master silicone wafer for the co-culture microdevice was fabricated using standard soft photolithography (\nLu et al., 2012\n;\nTaylor et al., 2005\n). In order to generate the master wafer, two steps were used to create the smaller 5 \u03bcm tall microchannels and then the larger 100 \u03bcm tall cell culture reservoirs. Briefly, to form the microchannels, a 5 \u03bcm tall layer of negative photoresist SU8-2 (Microchem, Newton, MA) was spun-coated onto a silicone wafer upon which the transparency was placed and exposed to UV light. Uncrosslinked areas were dissolved and washed using an SU8 developer (Microchem). Subsequently, the wafer underwent another spinning coating process with SU8 2050 (Microchem) to form a 100 \u03bcm layer and exposed to UV light with a transparency mask generating the neuronal and SC chambers. Again, the wafer was developed and baked to its final form.\nMicrodevices were formed using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) molded from the master wafer. In a ratio of 10:1 (base:curing agent) the elastomer, Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning, USA), was poured over the master wafer within a 100 mm Petri dish and placed in a vacuum desiccator for 2h to remove bubbles. The PDMS covered wafer was then placed in a 60 \u00b0C oven overnight to harden and autoclaved to complete any crosslinking. Microdevices were then cut from the molds and cell seeding chambers were created using 6 mm semicircular punches. Microdevices were placed in a plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma, Ithaca, NY) for 2.5 min with glass cover slips attached to 35 mm dishes in order to form a tight seal and prevent any leakage. Once bonded, the devices were sterilized by UV exposure. The devices were coated with 10 \u03bcg/mL PLL for 1 h in the SC soma chamber and with 10 \u03bcg/mL poly-d-lysine and 10 \u03bcg/mL laminin in the neuronal and microchannel chambers.\n\n2.4 Microdevice Cell Seeding and Culture\nOnce the microdevices had been prepared, muscle or cutaneous nerve-derived SCs were seeded into the PLL-coated SC chamber at 7 \u00d7 10\n3\ncells/cm\n2\nin SC media or with SC media supplemented with 100 ng/mL of GDNF. SCs were then allowed to grow for 5 days prior to neuronal seeding, at which point the devices were washed 3\u00d7 to remove any exogenous GDNF that could affect neurite growth. Motor and sensory neurons were seeded into the neuronal somal chambers of the microdevices at 2.5\u00d710\n5\ncells/cm\n2\nin neurobasal media supplemented with 1\u00d7 B27, 1\u00d7 penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 10 \u03bcg/mL of fluorodeoxyuridine (FDU, Sigma Aldrich) to again remove any remaining endogenous glia. Motor neurons were also supplemented with 4 \u03bcg/mL of hydrocortisone in order to improve their survival after removal of supporting cell types based on previous reports in the literature, this is not commonly added to sensory neuron cultures (\nBanker and Goslin, 1998\n;\nGingras et al., 2007\n). In order to ensure only factors secreted by SCs affect the neurons and not vice versa, a 30 \u03bcL volume difference was used between the two chambers such that the higher volume of media in the SC chamber allowed only for flow from the SC chamber into the neuronal chamber. Media was collected and replaced from the SC chambers at days 2 and 7 for protein analysis, while SC lysates were collected from the devices at day 7 for mRNA gene expression analysis. Finally, neurite extension of motor and sensory neurons into the microchannels was visualized by Calcein-AM dye (Invitrogen) and images were taken on a fluorescent microscope with a CCD Olympus camera at a 10\u00d7 objective. Neurite extension length was measured by ImageJ software. The level of extensions into the microdevices allow for us to determine the degree of preferential growth toward the SC chamber. A schematic of the experimental paradigm is shown in\nFigure 1\n.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nSchematic of study design and timeline for culture in microdevices. A) Microdevice and microchannels dimensions are 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 500 (L\u00d7W\u00d7H) \u03bcm. Volume difference allows for one way flow and diffusion of media and growth factors. B) Timeline of cell seeding, media/cell lysate collection, and neurite length analysis is shown.\n\n2.5 Quantitative Real Time- Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)\nSC lysates were collected from the microdevices and RNA was purified using RNeasy mini prep kit (Qiagen). The purity and concentration of mRNA was determined using a Nanodrop and then mRNA was converted to cDNA using High Capacity mRNA-to-cDNA kit (Life Technologies). Gene expression for S100b, Nestin, GDNF, and the housekeeping gene (\u03b2-actin was determined using Taqman gene expression assays (Life Technologies) and Fast Master Mix (Life Technologies) on the Step One Plus Real Time PCR system.\n\n2.6 GDNF Protein Quantification\nGDNF protein levels in collected media samples were determined using R&D System GDNF DuoSet ELSIA kit. Control microdevices were concurrently run in which devices with no cells were given identical GDNF treatments and washes in order to ensure no exogenous GDNF remained within the wells and GDNF detection was purely that of GDNF produced by the SCs.\n\n2.7 Statistics\nStatistical analysis was performed using Statistica software (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK) with comparative ANOVA analysis and a Scheff\u00e9's post hoc test with p<0.05. Data represented is shown as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean. Data included n=4-6 microdevices per condition; n=14-239 neurites measured per condition."

    "Methods": "Animals\nExperiments were conducted on adult (3\u20134 months old) male Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan Colony 211; Indianapolis, IN) maintained on a 12:12 light:dark cycle with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Wisconsin, and were in agreement with standards set forth in the National Institutes of Health Guide (NIH) for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The University of Wisconsin is accredited by AAALAC, and is covered by NIH Assurance (A3368-01).\n\nIntrapleural injections\nCholera toxin B subunit conjugated to saporin (CTB\u2013SAP; 25\u201350 \u03bcg dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS); Advanced Targeting Systems; San Diego, CA) was administered intrapleurally to target respiratory motor neurons. Intrapleural injections were done according to\nMantilla et al. (2009)\nusing a 50 \u03bcL Hamilton syringe and a custom needle (6 mm, 23 gauge, semi-blunt to avoid puncturing of the lung). CTB\u2013SAP plus extra CTB (25 or 50 \u03bcg dissolved in doubly distilled H\n2\nO; Calbiochem; Billerica, MA; to label spared phrenic motor neurons) were bilaterally injected into the right and left pleural spaces (6 mm deep, fifth intercostal space) while the rats were under isoflurane anesthesia (1.5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen). Control rats received an injection of CTB (25\u201350 \u03bcg) unconjugated to saporin (SAP, 25\u201350 \u03bcg dissolved in PBS; Advanced Targeting Systems; San Diego, CA) or CTB + SAP as a control to demonstrate SAP alone does not cause respiratory motor neuron death. Rats were monitored for overt signs of respiratory compromise.\n\nPlethysmography\nA sub-set of rats were placed in a whole-body flow-through plethysmograph (BUXCO Electronics, Troy, NY) 7 and 28 days following intrapleural injection. This technique allows quantitative measurement of ventilation in freely-behaving rats with altered inspired gas concentrations. The system was calibrated, the rats weighed, and their body temperature was measured with a rectal thermometer (Type T Thermocouple Thermometer, Model 600-1020, Barnant Company, Barrington, IL) before being placed in the plethysmograph chamber (~2 L volume). Ventilation was assessed in control rats (CTB + SAP; 25 \u03bcg CTB + 25 \u03bcg SAP for 7 and 28 days; n = 3 each; with no differences between 7 and 28 days, control rats were grouped for analysis) and CTB\u2013SAP (25 \u03bcg for 7 and 28 days: n = 3 each) treated rats. The rats acclimated to the chamber while breathing room air (21% O\n2\n, balance N\n2\n; flushed at ~3 L/min). Recording commenced once the rats were quiet but awake; ventilatory measurements were made during baseline conditions, before exposing them to 5% hypercapnia (21% O\n2\n, 5% CO\n2\n, balance N\n2\n; 15 min), 7% hypercapnia (21% O\n2\n, 7% CO\n2\n, balance N\n2\n; 15 min) and an hypoxic + hypercapnic gas mixture (10.5% O\n2\n/7% CO\n2\n; 15 min). A pressure calibration signal, plethysmograph temperature, rat body temperature, ambient and chamber pressures, and rat body mass were used to calculate breath-by-breath tidal volume (VT;\nDrorbaugh and Fenn, 1955\n;\nJacky, 1978\n), respiratory frequency, mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI) and minute ventilation (V\u0307E). VT, V\u0307E and VT/TI are reported normalized to body mass (per 100 g). Data were rejected if there was evidence of pressure fluctuations caused by gross body movements or sniffing behavior. At the conclusion of the study, rats were removed from the chambers and their body temperatures recorded.\n\nNeurophysiological experiments\nRats were prepared as described previously (\nHoffman et al., 2012\n;\nNichols et al., 2012\n). Rats were induced and maintained with isoflurane (3.5% in 50% O\n2\n, balance N\n2\n) throughout surgical procedures. Rats were trachotomized, pump ventilated, (Rodent Ventilator, model 683; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA; tidal volume = 2.5 mL), and bilaterally vagotomized. A polyethylene catheter (PE50 ID: 0.58 mm, OD: 0.965 mm; Intramedic, MD, USA) was inserted into the right femoral artery to monitor blood pressure (Gould Pressure Transducer, P23ID, USA) and blood gases (ABL 800, Radiometer, Westlake, OH). A rectal thermistor (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) was used to monitor body temperature, which was maintained (37.5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) with a heated surgical table. To monitor end-tidal PCO\n2\n(P\nETCO2\n), a flow-through carbon dioxide analyzer was used with sufficient response time to measure P\nETCO2\nin rats (Capnogard, Novametrix, Wallingford, CT, USA). P\nETCO2\nwas maintained at ~45 mm Hg throughout surgery. Phrenic nerves were isolated (dorsal approach), cut distally, desheathed and covered with a saline soaked cotton ball until protocols commenced. Once surgery was complete, rats were converted to urethane anesthesia over 20\u201330 min (1.8 g kg\n\u22121\n,\ni.v.\n). The adequacy of anesthesia was tested before protocols commenced, and immediately after the protocol was complete; adequacy of anesthetic depth was assessed as the lack of pressor or respiratory neural response to a toe pinch with a hemostat (\nBach and Mitchell, 1996\n;\nHoffman et al., 2012\n;\nNichols et al., 2012\n). Once rats were converted to urethane, a minimum of 1 h was allowed before experiments commenced. Rats were given continuous intravenous infusions (1.5\u20136 mL kg\n\u22121\nh\n\u22121\n) of a 1:2:0.13 mixture of 6% hetastarch in 0.9% sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's solution, and 8.4% sodium bicarbonate to maintain blood volume, fluid and acid\u2013base balance.\n\nExperimental protocol\nPhrenic nerve activity was recorded with bipolar silver electrodes, amplified (10,000\u00d7), band-pass filtered (300\u201310,000 Hz, Model 1800, A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA, USA), rectified and integrated (Paynter filter, time constant, 50 ms, MA-821, CWE Inc., Ardmore, PA, USA). Integrated nerve bursts were digitized (8 kHz) and analyzed using WINDAQ data acquisition system (DATAQ Instruments, Akron, OH, USA). Rats were then paralyzed using pancuronium bromide for neuromuscular blockade to prevent spontaneous breathing efforts (2.5 mg kg\n\u22121\n,\ni.v\n.) (\nBach and Mitchell, 1996\n).\nTo begin protocols, the apneic threshold was determined by lowering P\nETCO2\nuntil nerve activity ceased for approximately 1 min. The recruit ment threshold was then determined by slowly increasing the P\nETCO2\nuntil nerve activity resumed (\nBach and Mitchell, 1996\n). P\nETCO2\nwas raised to ~2 mm Hg above the recruitment threshold and approximately 15\u201320 min were allowed to establish stable neural activity (\ni.e.\nbaseline). Blood samples were analyzed for arterial partial pressures of O\n2\n(PaO\n2\n) and CO\n2\n(PaCO2), and were assessed during baseline, the two hypercapnic challenges and the hypercapnic + hypoxic episode. PaO\n2\nwas \u2265150 mm Hg during baseline, and during hypercapnic challenges, but was between 35\u201345 mm Hg during hypercapnia + hypoxia. Following ~15\u201320 min of baseline, PaCO2 was set 20 mm Hg above baseline for 5 min and then PaCO2 was set 40 mm Hg above baseline for 5 min by adjusting inspired CO\n2\n. Following the final 5 minute hypercapnic + hypoxic episode (PaCO2 was set 40 mm Hg above baseline and PaO\n2\nwas between 35\u201345 mm Hg), rats were returned to baseline inspired O\n2\nand CO\n2\nlevels. Phrenic motor output was assessed in control (25 \u03bcg CTB + 25 \u03bcg SAP for 3 (n = 2), 7 (n = 5) and 28 (n = 3) days; 50 \u03bcg CTB + 50 \u03bcg SAP for 14 days, n = 3; since there were no differences between control groups, all control rats were grouped for analysis) and CTB\u2013SAP (25 \u03bcg for 3 (n = 4), 7 (n = 9) and 28 (n = 7) days; 50 \u03bcg for 7 (n = 3) and 14 (n = 3) days) treated rats.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAt the end of neurophysiology experiments, rats were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH ~ 7.4) and the brainstem and spinal cord tissue harvested. The brainstem and spinal cord were post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and cryoprotected in graded sucrose (20 and 30%) at 4 \u00b0C until sinking. Transverse sections (40 \u03bcm) were cut using a freezing microtome (Leica SM 200R, Germany) and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C in antifreeze solution (30% ethylene glycol, 30% glycerol and 1\u00d7 PBS) until processed for motor neuron counting.\nBrainstem sections containing the Nucleus Ambiguus, cervical (C3\u20135) and thoracic (T2\u20137) sections (6 per area/rat) taken from control and CTB\u2013SAP rats were stained using immunohistochemistry techniques. Sections were separated and washed with 1\u00d7 PBS three times for 5 min; each rat's tissue was contained in a separate well. To prevent non-specific antibody binding, 5% normal donkey serum (NDS), 1\u00d7 PBS, and 0.2% Triton were added to each tissue sample and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibody solution was added, consisting of 5% NDS, 1\u00d7 PBS, 0.1% Triton, and the antibody against cholera toxin B subunit (CTB; goat polyclonal, 1:2000, Calbiochem; Billerica, MA) and/or CD11b (Ox42; mouse monoclonal, 1:500, AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC). Sections were incubated overnight in the primary antibody solution on a shaker at 4 \u00b0C.\nThe following day, tissues were washed three times with 1\u00d7 PBS (5 min each), and then incubated in the secondary antibody solution, which was composed of 5% NDS, 1\u00d7 PBS, 0.1% Triton and the secondary antibody (donkey anti-goat Alexa-Fluor 594, 1:2000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; and/or donkey anti-mouse Alexa-Fluor 488, 1:500; Molecu lar Probes, Eugene, OR) on a shaker for two hours in the dark at room temperature. Following incubation, tissues were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS using the same procedure (3 \u00d7 5 min). Finally, sections were mounted on positively charged glass slides, covered with ProLong\u00ae Gold Antifade Reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to prevent quenching of fluorescence, cover-slipped and air-dried. Slides were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until quantification of staining was performed using a confocal microscope at 4\u00d7, 10\u00d7 and/or 20\u00d7 magnification.\n\nMotor neuron counts\nLive confocal microscopy and C1\u2013ES program software (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U, Melville, NY) was used to quantify and take photomi crographs of Nucleus Ambiguus, phrenic and intercostal motor neurons in all brainstem and spinal cord tissues. Location of the phrenic and intercostal motor neurons in the ventral horn were determined and manually counted based on diagrams from\nThe Spinal Cord\n(\nWatson et al., 2009\n). Specifically, phrenic motor neurons are defined as the cluster of neurons medio-lateral of the cervical ventral horn (\nBoulenguez et al., 2007\n;\nMantilla et al., 2009\n). Surviving motor neurons were characterized as those exhibiting a CTB (+) stain, an identifiable cell body and nucleus. Right and left CTB (+) motor neurons were counted by a blinded investi gator. The number of CTB (+) motor neurons were counted from all rats in each group and compared between CTB\u2013SAP and control rats using Microsoft Excel to allow for graphical and statistical comparisons. The number of phrenic motor neurons in the C3\u20135 segment was extrapolated from the 6 sections (length of the entire phrenic motor nucleus is ~2000 \u03bcm; 40 \u03bcm sections), and the number of intercostal motor neurons in the T2\u20137 segment was extrapolated from the 6 sections (length of segments T2\u20137 each was ~1000 \u03bcm; 40 \u03bcm sections). The number of phrenic motor neurons in the C3\u20135 segment and the number of intercostal motor neurons in the T2\u20137 segment were compared and there were no differences between segments, so all segments were grouped together. Phrenic motor neuron survival was assessed in control (25 \u03bcg CTB +25 \u03bcg SAP for 3 (n = 2), 7 (n = 5) and 28 (n = 3) days; 50 \u03bcg CTB + 50 \u03bcg SAP for 14 days (n = 3); since there were no differences between control rats, all control rats were grouped) and CTB\u2013SAP (25 \u03bcg for 3 (n = 4), 7 (n = 9) and 28 (n = 7) days; 50 \u03bcg for 7 (n = 3) and 14 (n = 3) days) treated rats. Intercostal motor neuron survival was assessed in control (25 \u03bcg CTB + 25 \u03bcg SAP for 7 (n = 5) and 28 (n = 3) day; 50 \u03bcg CTB + 50 \u03bcg SAP for 14 days (n = 3); there were no differences between control rats, so all rats treated as controls were grouped) and CTB\u2013SAP treated rats (25 \u03bcg for 3 (n = 4), 7 (n = 9) and 28 (n = 7) days; 50 \u03bcg for 7 (n = 3) and 14 (n = 3) days).\nNucleus Ambiguus motor neuron location in the brainstem were similarly determined and manually counted based on diagrams from\nThe Spinal Cord\n(\nWatson et al., 2009\n). Specifically, Nucleus Ambiguus motor neurons are a cluster of neurons medio-lateral of the brainstem just dorsal to the ventral respiratory column and extending from bregma \u221214.6 mm to \u221211.3 mm (interaural parameters \u22125.6 mm to \u22122.3 mm;\nWatson et al., 2009\n). Surviving or healthy Nucleus Ambiguus cells were characterized as described above for spinal motor neurons. The number of Nucleus Ambiguus neurons was extrapolated from 6 sections (length of the entire Nucleus Ambiguus is ~3000 \u03bcm; 40 \u03bcm sections). Nucleus Ambiguus motor neuron survival was assessed in control (25 \u03bcg CTB + 25 \u03bcg SAP for 7 (n = 5) and 28 (n = 3) days; 50 \u03bcg CTB + 50 \u03bcg SAP for 14 days (n = 3); there were no differences between control rats, so all control rats were grouped) and CTB\u2013SAP (25 \u03bcg for 3 (n = 4), 7 (n = 9) and 28 (n = 7) days; 50 \u03bcg for 7 (n = 3) and 14 (n = 3) days) treated rats.\n\nCD11b image analysis\nRaw images were analyzed using Image J (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Analysis was performed using images taken at 20\u00d7 magnification from 2 regions of interest: 1) the phrenic motor nucleus (area surrounding CTB(+) phrenic motor neurons at spinal segments C3\u20135; 320.61 \u03bcm \u00d7 257.71 \u03bcm) and 2) the ventral horn at spinal segments C3\u20135 (700 \u03bcm \u00d7 700 \u03bcm). The fractional area occupied by CD11b label in raw image files was computed by Image J for the phrenic motor nucleus (as the percentage of the total field for the phrenic motor nucleus occupied by label positive pixels), and interpreted as the fractional area of microglia surrounding the phrenic motor nucleus. The fractional area occupied by CD11b label in raw image files was calculated manually for the non-phrenic ventral horn. Total label positive pixels were determined for the phrenic motor nucleus (fractional area multi plied by total pixels in the phrenic motor nucleus) and for the ventral horn (fractional area multiplied by total pixels in the ventral horn). Total label positive pixels for the non-phrenic ventral horn were deter mined by subtracting total label positive pixels in the phrenic motor nucleus from those in the ventral horn. Total label positive pixels for the non-phrenic ventral horn were then divided by the total pixels of the non-phrenic ventral horn (total pixels of the phrenic motor nucleus was subtracted from the total pixels in the ventral horn). Increased fractional area of CD11b staining indicates microglial activation (\nLing and Wong, 1993\n;\nLing et al., 1990\n;\nRobinson et al., 1986\n;\nRoy et al., 2006\n;\nWindelborn and Mitchell, 2012\n). This analysis does not allow distinction between greater cell size\nvs.\ncell number. CD11b fractional area on both sides in the phrenic motor nucleus and non-phrenic ventral horn for all rats in each group were compared between CTB\u2013SAP and control rats. CD11b fractional area was assessed in control (25 \u03bcg CTB + 25 \u03bcg SAP for 7 (n = 5) and 28 (n = 3) days; 50 \u03bcg CTB + 50 \u03bcg SAP for 14 days (n = 3); there were no differences between control groups, so they were grouped in the analysis) and CTB\u2013SAP (25 \u03bcg for 3 (n = 4), 7 (n = 9) and 28 (n = 7) days; 50 \u03bcg for 7 (n = 3) and 14 (n = 3) days) treated rats.\n\nAnalysis\nPlethysmography, apneic and recruitment thresholds, and integrated phrenic nerve burst amplitude data were compared with a two-way repeated measures ANOVA, with group (control vs. CTB\u2013SAP) and level (baseline\netc.\nor threshold) as factors. There were no differences in animals injected with control or in animals injected with CTB\u2013SAP for apneic and recruitment thresholds, so thresholds were combined for all control and CTB\u2013SAP treated rats. Integrated phrenic nerve burst ampli tudes were averaged over 1 min during baseline, during the two hypercapnic challenges and during the hypercapnia + hypoxia challenge. Only baseline and hypercapnia + hypoxia data are reported for both plethysmography and integrated phrenic nerve burst amplitudes. Phrenic nerve burst amplitude is reported as the voltage of the integrated signal (\ni.e.\narbitrary units). Statistical comparisons between treatment groups for phrenic nerve burst amplitude were done using a one-way ANOVA to compare baseline values or the hypercapnia + hypoxia challenge across treatment groups (the results of this analysis did not differ from the results of the two-way repeated measures ANOVA; since fundamental conclusions were the same, we report phrenic nerve burst data during baseline and hypercapnia + hypoxia separately to increase clarity). For histological analysis, a one-way ANOVA was used to compare motor neuron survival and CD11b fractional area within and across control and CTB\u2013SAP treatment groups. If significant differences were indicated, individual comparisons were made using a Fisher's least significant difference (LSD)\npost hoc\ntest (Sigma Plot version 12.0; Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). All differences between groups were considered significant if p < 0.05; all values are expressed as means \u00b1 1 S.E.M. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed between baseline or maximal phrenic activity with phrenic motor neuron survival, baseline or maximal VT/100 g with phrenic motor neuron survival, baseline or maximal VT/100 g with baseline or maximal phrenic activity, and baseline or maximal VT/100 g with intercostal motor neuron survival."

    "Methods": "Facet joint distraction procedures\nAll surgical procedures were performed using adult male Holtzman rats (362\u2013464g) under inhalation isoflurane anesthesia (4% induction, 2\u20133% maintenance). Facet joint loading was performed using a distraction of the bilateral C6/C7 facet joints, which has been described previously to produce physiologic or injurious tissue loading under different magnitudes of distraction (\nDong and Winkelstein, 2010\n;\nLee et al., 2004\n;\nLee and Winkelstein, 2009\n). Briefly, the overlying paraspinal musculature was separated to expose the vertebrae from C4-T1. The C6 and C7 vertebrae were attached to a custom loading device using microforceps and the C6 vertebra was distracted rostrally to stretch the facet capsule across the C6/C7 joints (\nFigure 1\n). Distraction of 0.2mm was applied for physiologic loading and 0.7mm imposed for injurious loading, in separate rats. Bead markers were placed on the C6 and C7 vertebrae, as well as in a grid on the right C6/C7 facet capsule, and were tracked with a Phantom v4.3 CCD camera (\nFigure 1\n) (Vision Research, Wayne, IN) during distraction of the joint. Using the marker locations before joint loading and at the peak of loading, both the vertebral and facet capsule displacements were quantified, and the maximum principal capsular strain was calculated during each joint distraction (\nFigure 1\n). Sham surgery included all of the same procedures with no joint distraction applied and controlled for the effect of the surgical procedures. Following surgery, the incision was closed with 3-0 polyester suture and surgical staples, and rats recovered under supervision in room air.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nCharacterization of the mechanical loading of the C6/C7 facet joint.\n(A)\nInjurious loading (Inj) imposes greater C6/C7 vertebral distraction and generates higher maximum principal strains (MPS) in the facet capsule than does physiologic loading (Phys).\n(B,C)\nVertebral distraction, capsule distraction, and load across the facet joint are significantly higher during injurious loading than physiologic loading. Data are mean\u00b1SD (n=18\u201319 rats per group). *p<0.0001 compared by Student\u2019s t-test.\n(D)\nRepresentative images of the facet joint are shown before distraction (unloaded), and at the peak of injurious loading of the joint. The maximum principal strain field is shown for the corresponding loaded facet capsule of a representative rat, with injurious joint loading inducing 0.92mm of vertebral distraction and a mean MPS of 34%.\n\nAssessment of behavioral sensitivity\nTactile allodynia was measured in the forepaws of each rat by quantifying the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) during application of a series of von Frey filaments, with increasing strength (1.4, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, and 26g), to the plantar surface of the forepaw (\nLee and Winkelstein, 2009\n). Each filament weight was applied five times, and a positive response was recorded if a rat responded to von Frey stimulation by licking, shaking, or withdrawing the forepaw. If a rat displayed a positive response to two consecutive filaments, the lower weight filament was taken as the paw withdrawal threshold. Rats not responding to any of the filaments were assigned the maximum threshold of 26g. Testing was repeated in three rounds on each day, separated by at least 10 minutes, and the average threshold from the three rounds was calculated for each rat.\n\nWestern blot analysis of DRG & spinal cord tissue\nRats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (65mg/kg, i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 300mL of PBS before removing the spinal cord the C6 and C7 level and the DRG at C6. Tissue samples were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 50mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.; St. Louis, MO). Protein samples (25\u03bcg for DRG, 50\u03bcg for spinal cord) were loaded on a polyacrylamide gel for SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) and run for 75 minutes at 150V. Protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane using an iBlot (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) and was blocked for 1 hour in 5% dry-milk blocking reagent in 0.1% Tween-20 Tris-buffered saline (TBS-Tween). The membrane was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with rabbit anti-thrombospondin-4 (TSP4) antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz; Dallas, TX) and mouse anti-\u03b2-tubulin (1:2000; Covance; Princeton, NJ). The PVDF membrane was washed in TBS-Tween three times for 10 minutes each time, followed by 2 hour incubation at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit 800 and goat anti-mouse 680 IRDye fluorescent secondary antibodies (1:10,000; Li-Cor Biosciences; Lincoln, NE). The membrane was imaged using an Odyssey Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences; Lincoln, NE). The fluorescence of the TSP4 band was analyzed using the Odyssey 2.1 software to quantify the intensity of the pixels within the bands and normalized to the corresponding \u03b2-tubulin fluorescence as a protein loading control for each sample.\n\nImmunofluorescent labeling of spinal cord tissue\nRats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (65mg/kg, i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 250mL of PBS followed by 250mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The C6 and C7 spinal cord segments were removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight, then cryopreserved in 30% sucrose in PBS for 7 days at 4\u00b0C. Samples were freeze-mounted in OCT medium (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and axial cryosections (14\u03bcm each, 5\u20136 per rat) were mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific) for immunolabeling. For labeling of TSP4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), slides were blocked in 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 2 hours at room temperature. Slides were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies in 10% goat serum with 0.3% Triton-X PBS. Primary antibodies included chicken anti-TSP4 (1:1000; previously described in\nDunkle et al. (2007\n)), and rabbit anti-GFAP (1:500; Dako, Denmark). Sections were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with goat anti-chicken Alexa 488 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa 568 fluorescent secondary antibodies (1:1000, Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA), and incubated with DAPI (1:10,000, Invitrogen) for 10 minutes. After rinsing in PBS and deionized water, slides were air-dried and cover slips were applied with Fluorogel (EMS; Hatfield, PA). Each tissue section was imaged at 20\u00d7 using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Separate images of sub-regions of the spinal cord (superficial dorsal horn, deep dorsal horn, and dorsal column) were analyzed by densitometry using MATLAB code to quantify the percent of TSP4- or GFAP-positive or colocalized pixels in each dorsal horn region (\nDong et al., 2013b\n;\nHubbard et al., 2008\n).\n\nSynapse quantification in the dorsal horn\nSections were immunolabeled as described above with mouse anti-synapsin (1:100; Synaptic Systems; Goettingen, Germany) and rabbit anti-homer antibodies (1:200; Synaptic Systems). For each spinal cord section, one image stack was acquired from each of the superficial dorsal horn (laminae I\u2013II) and deep dorsal horn (laminae IV\u2013VI) at 0.33\u03bcm increments up to 3\u03bcm of depth using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. The image stacks were acquired from the same locations in each section based on the cytoarchitecture of the dorsal horn, so the areas that were analyzed were consistent in anatomical location across sections and rats. The maximum intensity projection of each set of 3 sequential images was used to generate a single image (0.02mm\n2\ntissue area) with 1\u03bcm of tissue depth. Because irregular surface topology of the spinal cord sections and lack of antibody penetration led to large variations in labeling efficiency in the outermost and innermost maximum intensity projections, only the middle projection from each spinal cord section was analyzed, corresponding to tissue at 1\u20132\u03bcm from the surface of the section. The Puncta Analyzer plugin for ImageJ (National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, MD) was used to identify puncta exhibiting colocalization of the pre- and post-synaptic markers in each maximum intensity projection, using previously published methods (\nIppolito and Eroglu, 2010\n). The area of the tissue parenchyma, excluding any holes and/or gaps in the tissue sections, was quantified using a customized MATLAB code. The number of colocalized puncta in each of the superficial or deep dorsal horn was normalized to the corresponding tissue area for that region. The synapse number per area was then averaged across all rats in each treatment group.\n\nIntrathecal injections\nRats were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% for induction, 2\u20133% for maintenance) and placed in a prone position. The skin over the lumbar spine was shaved and cleaned with Betadyne solution, and a 30-gauge needle attached to a microinjector (Hamilton; Reno, NV) was inserted vertically along the midline at the gap between the L5 and L6 spinous processes. The needle was angled approximately 30\u00b0 to the right or left and inserted into the spinal canal between the laminae of the L5 and L6 vertebrae, with placement in the cauda equina confirmed by the presence of a reflexive tail flick or hindpaw flinch. Antisense or mismatch oligonucleotides, gabapentin, saline, recombinant TSP4, or StrepII peptide were administered in single bolus injections. Each of these injectates were delivered intrathecally in the lumbar region for safety reasons of avoiding the spinal cord, and because that method has been shown to effectively deliver agents to the cervical spinal cord in the rat (\nDong et al., 2013a\n;\nKras et al., 2013\n). The needle was held in place for 30\u201360 seconds before removing to prevent leakage from the lumbar spine. Rats were then monitored during recovery in room air.\n\nOligonucleotide treatments\nThis study used antisense oligonucleotides that were previously reported to block TSP4 expression (\nKim et al., 2012\n). Antisense oligonucleotides were designed against a segment of the TSP4 mRNA using the sequence, CCATCATTGTTGCTATCTTCC, with stabilizing modifications as described previously (\nKim et al., 2012\n). An equal length random sequence of nucleotides, ACCATCGTTGTTACTTTCTCC, was used as a mismatch control for the oligonucleotide treatment. Antisense (75\u03bcg/rat/day) and mismatch (75\u03bcg/rat/day) oligonucleotides were delivered by bolus 25\u03bcL intrathecal injections. Injections were administered daily beginning 3 days before injurious facet joint distraction and continuing through day 7 after the joint distraction, when spinal cord tissue was harvested.\n\nGabapentin treatment\nRats received either gabapentin or a saline vehicle treatment in bolus intrathecal injections. Gabapentin (4.2\u03bcg in 30\u03bcL saline) was administered 90 minutes prior to injurious facet joint distraction. A second dose was administered 1 day after injurious joint distraction, immediately following behavioral assessment on that day. Saline vehicle injections (30\u03bcL) were administered under the same paradigm to control for the effects of the injections. The gabapentin concentration and treatment times were optimized previously in dose-response studies (\nDong et al., 2013a\n).\n\nRecombinant TSP4 purification\nFull length TSP4 protein was recombinantly expressed in 293-Ebstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) cells using previously described methods by\nHansen et al. (2011)\nfor COMP, another TSP family member. Briefly, 293-EBNA cells were stably transfected with cDNA for rat TSP4 (GenBank accession no.\nX89963\n) with a StrepII tag. Cell culture media were collected every other day and stored at \u221220\u00b0C with 1.2mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and 1.2mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) to inhibit protease activity. Secreted TSP4-StrepII proteins in the cell media were purified with a Streptactin affinity chromatography column (1.5mL; IBA; Goettingen, Germany), then concentrated from the elution fractions using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters with a 50kDa threshold (Millipore; Billerica, MA) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. To assess behavioral sensitivity after increases in spinal TSP4, purified recombinant TSP4 (20, 30, 45, or 60\u03bcg/rat) was administered intrathecally in bolus injections in 25\u03bcL, and allodynia was assessed for 10 days after TSP4 injection. In separate rats, the effect of increased spinal TSP4 on the development of allodynia after joint loading was tested by intrathecally injecting 20\u03bcg or 60\u03bcg TSP4 3 days before injurious or physiologic facet joint loading. In both studies, intrathecal injection of 60\u03bcg StrepII peptide was used to control for the presence of the StrepII tag on recombinant TSP4 protein.\n\nElectrophysiological recording of spinal dorsal horn neurons\nRats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (45mg/kg, i.p.) and given supplementary doses (5\u201310mg/kg, i.p.) as needed based on toe pinch reflexes. A bilateral laminectomy and dural resection were performed at C6 and C7 to expose the spinal cord. Rats were then immobilized on a stereotaxic frame using ear bars and a vertebral clamp at T2 to stabilize the cervical spine (David Kopf Instruments; Tujunga, CA). Core temperature was maintained at 35\u201337\u00b0C using a temperature controller with a rectal probe (Physitemp; Clifton, NJ). The exposed spinal cord was bathed in 37\u00b0C mineral oil for the entire period when spinal neuronal recordings were being performed to prevent drying.\nExtracellular potentials were recorded from dorsal horn neurons by lowering a carbon fiber electrode (Kation; Minneapolis, MN) through the pial surface of the C6 or C7 spinal cord with a micropositioner (Narishige; Tokyo, Japan). Neurons were identified by brushing the plantar surface of the forepaw, and were then mechanically stimulated at the forepaw with 10 seconds of light brushing, five consecutive 1-second stimulations at 1-second intervals with a series of von Frey filaments (1.4g, 4g, 10g, 26g), and, finally, 10 seconds of noxious pinch by a 60g vascular clip (\nCrosby et al., 2013\n;\nCrosby et al., 2014\n;\nHains et al., 2003\n;\nQuinn et al., 2010\n). Voltage recordings from each neuron were spike-sorted using Spike2 software (CED; Cambridge, UK) to ensure that spikes from only one neuron were considered at a time. For the brush and the pinch stimuli, spikes were summed over the 10 seconds that the stimulus was administered. For the von Frey filament stimuli, spikes were considered to be evoked by a single von Frey stimulus if they occurred during the 1-second application or the 1-second rest period immediately following its application (\nQuinn et al., 2010\n); each filament had a total of five spike counts since each filament was applied to the forepaw five times. Baseline spike counts recorded prior to stimulation were subtracted from the spike counts for each stimulus to isolate the evoked response, and spike counts for each stimulus were log-transformed due to a positive skew in the distributions of the spike totals."

Laminin, Texas Red conjugated alphabungarotoxin (\u03b1BT) (TxR-\u03b1BT), and fluorescence-tagged secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen Co. Secondary antibodies with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were provided by GE Healthcare Bioscience Co. Primary antibodies were used to the following targets: phosphorylated H2AX (Ser139; 1:500; Millipore) and cleaved caspase-3 and -9 (1:200; Cell Signaling).\n\nAnimals and tissue preparation\n4\u20136 month-old male wild type FVB mice and SCS transgenic mice (mSCS; \u03b5L269F and \u03b4S268F) were used in this study (\n15\n). Both were derived by targeted expression of the respective mutant cDNA to muscle using the muscle creatine kinase promoter (\n15\n). Both \u03b5L269F and \u03b4S268F mutations have been reported in patients with SCS (\n4\n,\n16\n). The clinical electrophysiological and pathological features of the transgenic mouse lines have been described in detail elsewhere (\n3\n,\n5\n,\n15\n,\n17\n). All drug treatments and surgical procedures followed the animal care and use protocols established by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

For immunohistochemistry, tissues sections were fixed in a 1:1 methanol-acetone mixture at \u221220\u00b0C for 30 min, air dried for 20 min, and incubated with blocking solution for 1hr at RT, followed by overnight incubation with primary antibody at 4\u00b0C. After washing, fluorescent secondary antibody in PBST (phosphate buffered saline and 0.05% Tween-20) for 1hr at RT. Confocal fluorescence microscopy was carried out under a TCS laser scanning microscope (Leica, Deerfield, IL). Optical sections of 0.5 \u00b5m were scanned for the\nz\n-axis. Image J was used to quantify the percentage of specific expression of antibody in NMJs of each sample.\n\nQuantitative studies in tissue sections\nQuantitation of the proportion of labeled NMJs in the TA muscle cryosections was carried out using sequential alternate sections stained for cholinesterase and test label (GBHA, pH2X and caspase 3 and 9) as described previously (\n3\n,\n15\n), using Image J (v5.3) for analysis.\n\nCaspase activity assay\nCaspase-3 and caspase-9 activities in muscle were measured using a firefly luciferase-based assay (Calpain-Glo\u2122 Protease Assay; Caspase-Glo\n\u00ae\n3/7 and 9 Assays; Promega).

Briefly, after dissection diaphragm muscle was continuously perfused with a Tyrode's solution with a composition (in mM): 137 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 1.8 CaCl\n2\n, 1.1 MgCl\n2\n, 11.9 NaHCO\n3\n, 0.33 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, and 11.2 dextrose, pH 7.4) and pinned to a SYLGARD (Dow Corning Corporation, Midland, MI) chamber containing the Tyrode's solution and bubbled with a mixture of 95% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\n. Intracellular potentials and currents were recorded using an Axon900A (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) amplifier and borosilicate microelectrodes were prepared using the Flaming/Brown Micropipette Puller Model P-87 (Sutter Instruments), filled with a solution 3M KCl and were later beveled using the BV-10 Micro-Pipette Beveler (Sutter Instruments) to improve morphology and clamp efficiency with a resistance raging from 5\u201315 M\u03a9 choosing the lowest in resistance for the current electrode. Using the TEVC, miniature endplate currents (MEPCs) were recorded at a holding potential of \u221270mV. The output of the recording instrument was filtered at 1 kHz analog to digital converter using a Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Currents were digitized at 100\u00b5s per point and stored, captured and analyzed using pClamp10.3 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The miniature end plate currents were analyzed using the mini analysis program (Synaptosoft Inc., Fort Lee New Jersey). Finally, the amplitude, time constant and frequency for the recorded MEPCs were fitted and graphed to address the open channel blocker effect of fluoxetine on SCS panel. Endplates from untreated \u03b5L269F SCS transgenic mice with WT-like miniature kinetics were excluded from further analysis.\n\nTreadmill gait analysis\nMouse gait analysis was performed via the DigiGait Imaging System (Mouse Specifics, Inc., Boston) as described previously (\n6\n). Briefly, mice walked on a motor-driven treadmill with a transparent treadmill belt. A high frame rate camera was focused on the ventral plane of the mice as they walked within an acrylic chamber, ~5 cm wide by ~25 cm long. Due to the remarkable reduction of muscle strength in mSCS, brake time was primarily selected as the most sensitive metric to demonstrate functional improvement of treated muscle in mSCS. The treadmill speed was set to 25 cm/s. Approximately 5 seconds of video were collected for each walking mouse to provide ~20 sequential strides. The right hind limb from every mSCS was measured at pre- and post-treatment with fluoxetine, in which mSCS administrated with saline was selected as control group.\n\nStatistics\nValues were represented as the mean \u00b1 STDEV. Data were analyzed using Student\u2019s\nt\n-test and Chi-square test where appropriate, and non-parametric Mann-Whitney\nu\n-test, for comparisons of percentages and ratio values, as indicated in figure legends."

    "Methods": "Construction of the MNTS1 Lentivirus\nThe MNTS1 molecule was generated via selective point mutations and amino acid residue exchanges on a mature human NT-3 backbone as discussed previously (\nUrfer\net al\n., 1994\n). MNTS1 complementary DNA was produced synthetically by GeneArt\u00ae Gene Synthesis (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and subcloned into the lentiviral vector pRRLsinPPT-CMV-MCS-WPRE as previously described (\nDull\net al\n., 1998\n). The lentiviral particles were generated by The Miami Project Viral Vector Core of University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Lentiviruses were produced using the four-plasmid method (\nFollenzi and Naldini, 2002\n). Viral titers, shown as transducing units from 10\n7\nto 10\n8\n, were determined by a p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) used to quantify p24 core protein concentrations. Purified lentiviral particles were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.\n\nIsolation and Preparation of Neural Progenitor Cells\nNPCs were isolated from Sprague Dawley rat fetuses at embryonic stage E15. Frontal cortical tissue was microdissected in Lebovitz\u2019s L-15 medium (GIBCO/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Cortical tissue was transferred to a conical tube, titrated to obtain a single-cell solution, and counted using trypan blue (Life Technologies). Between 600,000 to 700,000 cells were placed on sterile, polystyrene 10 cm tissue culture dishes (Corning, Corning, NY) in NeuralCult proliferation medium solution (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC) that was selective for neurospheres and supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin, 10 \u03bcg/mL of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), 10 \u03bcg/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), and 0.2% Heparin. Two days later, neurospheres were infected with lentiviral vectors containing MNTS1 and GFP (pLV-eGFP) constructs, or GFP and blue fluorescent protein (BFP; pLV-EBFP2-nuc) constructs, and 2\u20133 mL of fresh medium was added to dishes. After two days of proliferation, NPCs were assessed for positive lentiviral transduction and cell viability.\nIf infection was positive, cells were plated on 10 cm fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)-coated tissue culture dishes and allowed to adhere and colonize for an additional 1\u20132 days. On day of transplantation, NPCs were trypsinized with Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; GIBCO/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 4.5 min. Medium was carefully removed and pellet was resuspended in fresh medium. Cells were assessed for viability and counted using trypan blue in a hemacytometer, followed by microcentrifugation at 6500 rpm for 1.5 min. One million cells were resuspended in 10 \u03bcl of fresh medium (for a final volume of 100,000/\u03bcl) and kept on ice until transplantation (< 30 minutes).\n\nAnimals\nAdult male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 58) were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 groups: sham/vehicle (n = 12), sham/GFP-NPCs (n = 8), sham/MNTS1-NPCs (n = 7), TBI/vehicle (n = 15), TBI/GFP-NPCs (n = 8), or TBI/MNTS1-NPCs (n = 8). Animal care was in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the University of Miami Animal Care and Use Committee and the NIH\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n. Animals were housed in a temperature-controlled room (22\u00b0C) with a 12-h light/dark cycle and allowed at least 7 days of acclimation before undergoing any experimentation. All animals had access to food and water\nad libitum\n, except for a 24 h fast before the surgical procedure in order to maintain consistent glucose levels.\n\nFluid-Percussion Traumatic Brain Injury\nRats were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in 30% O\n2\n/70% N\n2\nO and placed in a stereotaxic frame. Animals received a 4.8 mm craniotomy over the right parietal cortex, 3.8 mm posterior to bregma and 2.5 mm lateral to midline. A modified plastic injury hub (3.5 mm inner diameter) was bonded to the skull over the exposed dura with cyanoacrylic adhesive. Twenty-four h after the craniotomy, animals were reanesthetized, intubated, and mechanically ventilated with 0.5\u20130.75% isoflurane. Pancuronium bromide (1.0 mg/kg) was administered intravenously to facilitate ventilation. The tail artery was cannulated to ensure blood gases, pH, glucose, and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) measurements were consistent among animals. Rectal and temporalis muscle thermometers measured body and brain temperatures using self-adjusting feedback warming lamps. All variables were maintained within physiological ranges from 15 min prior to TBI and for up to 30 min post injury. A moderate (1.8\u20132.2 Atmospheres) fluid percussion-induced TBI was produced over the right parietal cortex. Sham animals underwent identical procedures minus the fluid percussion insult.\n\nPhysiology\nAll physiological variables including pH, pO\n2\n, pCO\n2\nand MABP were within normal ranges before and after the fluid percussion insult. Animals displayed normal activity within 24 h after recovery from anesthesia as detected by visual inspection of grooming behavior, posture, and locomotion. There was no significant weight loss in any experimental group 7 days post surgery or at the time of perfusion-fixation (6 weeks post surgery).\n\nNPC Transplantation\nOne week after TBI or sham surgery, animals were returned to a stereotaxic frame and reanesthetized with 3% isoflurane in 30% O\n2\n/70% N\n2\nO. Staples were removed and craniotomy was identified. Stereotaxic injection coordinates were as follows: \u22123.5 and \u22123.0 mm below dura, \u22124.3 mm posterior to bregma, and \u22125.0 mm lateral to midline. Four \u03bcl of medium containing 400,000 NPCs (100,000 cells per \u03bcl) were aspirated into a Gastight\u00ae 26 gauge microsyringe (Hamilton Co., Reno, NV). Using a motorized stereotaxic injector (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, Illinois), medium + cells were slowly injected into the right parietal cortex at a rate of 1 \u03bcl per minute. 200,000 cells were transplanted at each depth. Before and after each injection, the syringe was allowed to remain in the parenchyma for 2 min for tissue acclimation. Cells were transplanted over the course of 12 min. Vehicle groups were injected with 4 \u03bcl of 0.9% sterile saline using identical transplantation procedures and coordinates. After the final injection, animals were restapled and returned to their home cages. All animals displayed normal activity within 24 h after recovery from anesthesia. All animals received 10 mg/kg of the immunosuppressant, cyclosporine A (CsA; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., East Hanover, NJ). Intraperitoneal (IP) injections of CsA began 2 days prior to transplantation procedure and continued daily for 14 days post transplantation. A subset of animals (total n = 25; sham/vehicle = 5; sham/GFP = 4; sham/MNTS = 3; TBI/vehicle = 5; TBI/GFP = 3; TBI/MNTS1 =5) received injections of a concentrated aqueous solution of 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and 5-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (FdUrd) labeling reagent (10:1; 1 mL/100g of rat bodyweight administered IP; Invitrogen Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) beginning day of transplantation and daily thereafter for 7 days.\n\nCognitive Assessment\nFive weeks after TBI or sham surgery, spatial memory was evaluated via the Morris water maze (MWM), which consisted of a circular pool (122 cm diameter, 60 cm deep) filled with water rendered opaque by white, non-toxic paint. Submerged heaters maintained the water temperature between 22\u201325\u00b0C. A round platform (10 cm diameter) was submerged 5 cm beneath the water surface. The pool was divided into 4 equal-sized quadrants, one of which included the hidden platform. Prominent extramaze cues served as visual reference points. Swim patterns were recorded and analyzed via Ethovision (Noldus Information Technology, Leesburg, VA). MWM parameters evaluated included escape latency (time to locate platform), percentage of total time spent in each quadrant, and swim speed.\nAnimals were tested for 3 consecutive days, each day consisting of 4 trials at 5-min intervals. For each trial, animals were released from the edge of the pool into a randomly selected quadrant. Release point order was identical for all animal groups. During each trial, the animals were allowed 60 sec to find the hidden platform. If they failed to locate it, they were guided to the platform. Animals were required to remain on the platform for an additional 30 sec for memory acquisition training.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAt 6 weeks post TBI or sham procedures, animals were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in 30% O\n2\n/70% N\n2\nO and transcardially perfused with saline (80 mL for 2 min) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (4\u00b0C, 350 mL at a pressure of 100\u2013120 mmHg for 28 min). Brains were immediately removed, placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h and then cryoprotected in 20% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline. Brains sections (45 \u03bcm thickness) were cut with a frozen sliding microtome (LEICA SM200R, Leica Microsystems, Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL). Serial sections at 270 \u03bcm intervals were immunostained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), rat anti-BrdU (when applicable, 1:150), mouse anti-neuronal nuclei (NeuN; 1:400), chicken anti-GFP (1:2000), mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:2000), rabbit anti-Olig2 (1:250), rabbit anti-NG2 (1:500), rabbit anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1; 1:1000), or mouse anti-aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (Aldh1; 1:800) as previously described (\nAtkins\net al.,\n2010\n;\nBregy\net al.,\n2012\n). Development of immunofluorescent staining was conducted with goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200), goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200), goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568/594/647 (1:200), or goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568/594/647 (1:200) depending on the outcome measure.\n\nVolumetric and Stereological Analyses\nAntibody penetration was verified in all sections using 100x magnification. Cortical contusion volumes were determined by tracing the contused areas in serial H&E sections with a 5x objective on an Axiophot 200 M microscope (Zeiss Microscopy, LLC, Thornwood, NY) using Neurolucida software (MicroBrightfield, Inc., Williston, VT). Cortical contusion boundaries were well demarcated by hemorrhage and shearing at the gray/white matter interface between the cortex and external capsule in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Serial bregma levels were observed beginning at \u22121.0 mm posterior to bregma. At first indication of contusion, all subsequent bregma levels were included for volumetric analysis up until \u22126.8 mm posterior to bregma. Separate serial sections from \u22123.0 to \u22125.8 mm posterior to bregma were chosen to determine neuron survival within parietal cortical regions. NeuN-immunoreactive cells were quantified by a blinded observer in an unbiased manner using Stereoinvestigator software (MicroBrightfield, Inc;\nGundersen\net al.\n, 1988\n). The parietal cortex overlying the contused area was contoured at 4x. The epicenter of neuronal loss was identified and a border was defined 1000 \u03bcm to the right and to the left of the epicenter to give a total rectangular contour width of 2000 \u03bcm. A counting grid of 250 \u00d7 250 \u03bcm was placed over the contoured parietal cortex. Using a 70 \u00d7 70 \u03bcm counting frame, NeuN-positive cells were counted in 30\u201340 randomly-placed sampling sites with a 60x 1.4 NA objective to obtain an estimated population of cells per \u03bcm\n3\n.\nStereoinvestigator software was also used to conduct quantitative assessment of BrdU/NeuN-immunoreactive cells in the ipsilateral hippocampus. The DG cell layer was contoured using a BX51TRF Olympus microscope (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA, USA) at 4x magnification. Using a PlanApo N 60x/1.42 oil objective, a blinded observer analyzed 5 sections between bregma levels \u22123.8 mm and \u22125.0 mm posterior to bregma with a 100 \u00d7 100 \u03bcm counting frame and 115 \u00d7 115 \u03bcm counting grid in 40\u201355 randomly-placed sampling sites. To determine numbers of internalized GFP- and GFP/NeuN-positive cells in transplanted animals, all sections positive for GFP-positive cell bodies in a single series were quantified.\n\nStatistics\nIn all quantification and analysis procedures, observers were blinded to the nature of the experimental manipulation. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). GFP-positive cell survival and neuronal differentiation quantifications were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test. Contusion volumes and cortical neuron protection were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Double-labeled BrdU/NeuN-positive cell quantifications were analyzed using the Student\u2019s t-test. Significance of MWM outcomes was determined using two-way repeated measures ANOVA or Student\u2019s t-test depending on the outcome measure. Post-hoc analysis was performed using Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) corrections. Significance level was p < 0.05 using two-tailed testing."

    "Methods": "I. General information\nAll chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise stated. Mice were housed in standard mouse cages, with a 12 hr: 12 hr light/dark cycle, and food (Purina 5001; W.F. Fisher, Somerville, NJ) and water\nad libitum\n.\n\nII. Methods to suppress adult neurogenesis\nFor focal, low-dose X-irradiation, male 6\u20138 week-old C57BL6/J mice (Jackson Laboratories) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (6 mg/kg), placed in a stereotaxic frame, and exposed to cranial irradiation using a XRAD320 system (Precision Xray Inc., North Branford, CT) operated at 300 kV and 12 mA. Animals were protected with a lead shield that covered the entire body, except for a 4 \u00d7 14 mm treatment field above the hippocampus. X-rays were filtered using a 2 mm aluminum filter with a 36 mm source-to-skin distance. Three 2.5 Gy doses were delivered over approximately 2 min 45 sec, with 3 days between doses, and a 7.5 Gy cumulative dose.\nAs an alternative method to suppress adult neurogenesis, we used mice with the herpes simplex virus \u2013 thymidine kinase (hsv-TK) transgene under the control of the mouse glial fibrillary acid protein promoter (GFAP-TK+) or mice without the transgene (GFAP-TK\u2212). Mice were backcrossed onto C57BL6/J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) for at least 6 generations. Starting 6 weeks of age, they were fed valganciclovir (VGCV; 165 mg/kg chow; Custom Animal Diets) 5 days/week and normal chow on other days. It is important to note that injection of GCV i.p. has adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract but treatment with VCGV in the chow does not (\nSchloesser et al., 2009\n). Presumably this is due to a direct exposure of the intestines during i.p. injection vs. indirect exposure during oral administration. We confirmed that the intestines were normal in appearance in 3 mice that were euthanized immediately after the 6 week-long treatment with chow containing VGCV. The appearance (skin, fur) was similar to control mice. We also measured body weight before and after VCGV treatment and found that it was not significantly different (GFAP-TK\u2212: 23.8 \u00b1 3.4 g, n = 36; GFAP-TK+: 24.4 \u00b1 2.3 g; n = 39; t-test, p = 0.211), suggesting that food intake was unaffected by the transgene.\n\nII. EEG recordings of KA-induced seizures\nA. Implantation of electrodes for EEG\nMice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (55 mg/kg i.p.) and implanted stereotaxically with an epidural electrode (0.10\u201ddiameter screws; # 8209; Pinnacle Technologies; Lawrence, KS) over the left frontal cortex (FC; anterior-posterior coordinate relative to Bregma, AP =\u22120.5 mm; mediolateral coordinate relative to the midline, ML = 1.5 mm) and another electrode overlying right occipital cortex (OC; AP = \u22123.5 mm; ML= 2.0 mm). Stainless steel 75 \u00b5m-diameter lacquer-coated wire (#787000; A-M Systems, Sequim, WA) was twisted to make bipolar electrodes that were placed into each dorsal hippocampus (AP = \u22122.5 mm, ML = 2.5 mm, depth below skull surface = 2.5 mm). Electrodes were soldered to an 8-pin connector (#8400-SE4, Pinnacle) and cemented (Grip cement; Caulk Dentsply). The location of electrodes in hippocampus was confirmed in 60 of 61 mice using cresyl violet staining. Video-EEG was acquired (500 Hz; Pinnacle) and analyzed offline (Acqknowledge; Biopac Systems, Inc.).\nB. Seizure induction\nKA (16\u201325 mg/kg s.c.; Milestone Pharmatech) was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS); ethosuximide (150 mg/kg; i.p.) was dissolved in 20% ethanol in PBS. Between 10:30 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., animals were removed from their home cage and placed in a new cage where their pin connector was attached to a cable with a commutator (Pinnacle) to allow freedom of movement. Baseline recordings were made for >10 min, and the animal was injected s.c. between the shoulder blades with KA using a 29 gauge needle and low-volume (0.33 cc) syringe to optimize the accuracy of each dose, which we estimate (from the accuracy of this syringe) was \u00b11.2 mg/kg. For this reason, doses between 20 and 25 mg/kg were not tested (see Results). KA was made as a concentrated stock solution (12 mg/ml in PBS) and was stored at 4\u00b0C for up to 1 month. For a subset of GFAP-TK mice, the investigator was blinded to the genotype during KA administration. This was not possible for X-irradiated animals because X-irradiation led to a band of hair where irradiation occurred that lacked pigmentation.\nC. Quantification of EEG\nA seizure was defined as rapid, rhythmic (>3 Hz) deflections >2x the standard deviation of noise, lasting >3 sec (the duration of the shortest seizure in the current study was 11 sec). Seizures were rated as convulsive if they were accompanied by stage 3\u20135 behaviors (\nRacine, 1972\n). In three mice, the interrater reliability of convulsive vs. nonconvulsive seizures was tested for 38 seizures by two investigators and there was 100% agreement. The two investigators measured the latency to the first convulsive seizure in these animals (25.0 \u00b1 0.9 min vs. 25.2 \u00b1 0.9 min; t-test, p = 0.855).\nThe latency to onset of a seizure was defined as the time of KA injection to the time when the peak-to-peak amplitude of the EEG exceeded 1.25x of the baseline mean in all electrodes. To validate interrater reliability, the onset of the first seizure was examined in three mice by two investigators; there was 100% agreement. The end of a seizure was defined as the time when the EEG returned to the baseline mean or (in the case of postictal depression) a value lower than the baseline mean. Duration was defined as the time between seizure onset and the end of a seizure (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n).\nInterictal spikes (IIS) were defined as brief (<200 msec) deflections in all leads that were >2x the standard deviation of noise. Digital detection of IIS was validated in 3 animals for the first 10 min of the 4th hour after KA; the mean number of IIS was 311 (manual) vs. 316 (digital).\nAs shown in\nFig. 1\n, animals developed seizures soon after KA administration, and they became progressively more frequent. After approximately 2\u20134 hrs, the EEG returned to baseline and there was intermittent spiking (i.e. IIS), which lasted up to 24 hrs after KA injection. The end of the acute period was the time when spiking on all leads had transitioned from a period of high frequency (>1 Hz) to low frequency (\u22641 Hz). In addition to analysis of this ~2\u20134 hrs after KA, we analyzed the first 45 min following KA injection, because we hypothesized that during this time, when seizures are not typically severe, an effect of a very small part of the brain (adult neurogenesis in the DG or olfactory bulb) might be more readily detected (\nSupplementary Fig. 2\n).\nFigure 1. Greater acute effects of KA in GFAP-TK+ mice compared to GFAP-TK\u2212 mice.\nOpen in a new tab\nA\n. The experimental timeline is shown. Valganciclovir (VGCV)-treated chow was used for 6 weeks. One week later, mice were implanted with electrodes, and approximately a week later, ethosuximide (Etx) was injected, followed by KA after 30 min. Sample sizes are as follows: 20 mg/kg, n = 7/group; 25 mg/kg, n = 3/group. In this figure and all others, sz = seizures.\nB\n. Representative traces from a GFAP-TK\u2212 and a GFAP-TK+ mouse (20 mg/kg KA) show that convulsive seizures (arrows) occurred sooner and more often in the GFAP-TK+ mouse.\nC\n. Dividing the 3 hrs after KA into 15 min-long bins shows that GFAP-TK+ mice had more convulsive seizures (stages 3\u20135,\nRacine, 1972\n). Each row is for a different mouse. Right: Colors are used to indicate the number of convulsive seizures/bin, ranging from 0 (blue) to 8 (red). After an animal died there are no more bins shown for that animal.\nD\n. 1\u20132. GFAP-TK+ mice that were administered 20 mg/kg KA had a shorter latency to the first convulsive seizure but not the first nonconvulsive seizure. 3. GFAP-TK+ mice had a greater number of convulsive seizures and fewer nonconvulsive seizures. 4. When all convulsive seizure durations were summed, the total duration was greater in GFAP-TK+ mice. The total duration of nonconvulsive seizures was shorter in GFAP-TK+ mice. For this figure and all other figures, two asterisks reflect a main effect of reducing adult neurogenesis by two-way ANOVA and significance by post-hoc test (p<0.05). A single asterisk indicates there was a significant main effect of suppressing adult neurogenesis but the post-hoc comparison did not reach significance.\n\nIII. Anatomical procedures\nA. General procedures\nMice were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde after deep urethane anesthesia (2.5 g/kg, i.p.). The brain was post-fixed overnight and 50 \u00b5m-thick sections were cut (TPI- 3000, Vibratome Co., St. Louis, MO). Figures were composed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems, Redmond, WA).\nB. Immunohistochemistry\nDetailed methods are provided in the\nSupplementary Material\n. In brief, sections were incubated in Triton-X 100 (0.25%) in 1 M TRIS buffer (\u201cTRIS A\u201d; pH 7.6). After washing in TRIS A for 10 min, sections were blocked with serum dissolved in TRIS A, washed, and incubated overnight in primary antibody diluted in TRIS containing 0.005% bovine serum albumin at room temperature. The next day, sections were washed, transferred to secondary antibody containing 0.005% bovine serum albumin diluted in TRIS A for 45 min, washed, and transferred to avidin-biotin complex solution (Standard ABC kit; Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA) at the dilution suggested by the manufacturer. After washing, sections were reacted in 0.5 mg/ml diaminobenzidine (DAB), 20 nM glucose oxidase, 7.5 mM ammonium chloride, and 11 mM D-glucose. For doublecortin (DCX), 5 mM NiCl\n2\nwas added to intensify staining. Sections were washed, mounted on subbed slides and dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol the next day, followed by clearing in Xylene. Slides were coverslipped with Permount (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Sections were viewed with a brightfield microscope (BX51; Olympus of America, Center Valley, PA). Photographs were taken with a digital camera (RET 2000R-F-CLR-12, Q-Imaging, Surrey, BC, Canada) using Q-capture software (Q-Imaging).\nAn antibody to DCX (goat polyclonal, 1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc., West Grove, PA) was used to stain immature neurons (\nBrown et al., 2003\n;\nCouillard-Despres et al., 2005\n). Sections were blocked in 5% normal donkey serum, incubated in primary antibody (goat polyclonal, 1:3,000; #SC-8066; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and then a biotinylated secondary antibody (donkey anti-goat; 1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc. West Grove, PA). To detect radial glia and mature astrocytes, an antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was used (mouse monoclonal; 1:1,000, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). Blocking serum was 5% normal horse serum (Vector) and a biotinylated secondary antibody was diluted 1:400 (horse anti-mouse; Vector). To detect TK expression, an antibody against hsv-TK was diluted 1:4,000 (a kind gift from Dr. Michael Sofroniew; rabbit polyclonal;\nImura et. al 2003\n). Normal goat serum (5%; Vector) and a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:400; Vector) were used.\nC. Immunofluorescence\nTo determine whether suppression of adult neurogenesis affected microglia, we used a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Iba-1, a marker of microglia (\nLalancette-Hebert et al., 2007\n;\nZattoni et al., 2011\n). Procedures for immunofluorescence are described in detail elsewhere (\nDuffy et al., 2011\n). In brief, free-floating sections were washed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), blocked in 5% goat serum for 1 hr and incubated in primary antibody (Iba-1, 1:500, #019-19741, Wako USA Inc., Richmond, VA) overnight at room temperature. Sections were then washed with PB, incubated in Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:400; Life Technologies; Grand Island, NY) for 2 hrs and washed with PB. Sections were mounted and coverslipped with Vectashield (#H-1000; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and viewed with a confocal microscope (LSM 510 Meta, Zeiss, Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY). For both immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, sections that were stained with a given antibody were photographed using the same settings.\nD. Quantification of immunolabeled sections\nImmunoreactivity (ir) was quantified by calculating the area within a region of interest (ROI) that exceeded a threshold (\nLee et al., 2012\n;\nDuffy et al., 2011\n). First, the ROI was outlined at 10x magnification (Image Analysis software; Bioquant; Nashville, TN;\nDuffy et al., 2011\n). In the DG, the ROI was drawn to outline an area in the DG where immature neurons were normally present, and could be drawn consistently across sections (based on landmarks in background staining such as the border of the GCL and inner molecular layer and the lateral tips of the upper and lower blades; as shown in\nFig. 7\n). The threshold was set so that the soma and dendrites of an immunoreactive cell was above threshold, but the area around the cell where ir was negligible was below threshold (\nFig. 7\n). The area of suprathreshold ir within the ROI was expressed as a percent of the total area of the ROI. The mean was determined for each animal based on 3 coronal sections in the dorsal DG, spaced approximately 300 \u00b5m apart. For all analyses, the investigator was blinded.\nFigure 7.

This analysis (n = 3/group;\nSupplementary Fig. 3\n) confirmed the result that was obtained using digital thresholding for C57Bl6 mice shown in\nFig. 7\n.\n\nIV. Statistics\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean and p<0.05. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA; two-way and repeated measures ANOVA; RMANOVA), post-hoc Fisher\u2019s PLSD tests, Student\u2019s t-tests (two-tailed), Mann-Whitney U tests, and Fisher\u2019s Exact tests used Statview (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Bartlett\u2019s test was used to assess homoscedasticity of variance; where there was departure from homoscedasticity, it was minimized by log transformation.\nTwo-way ANOVAs were conducted using condition (intact or reduced adult neurogenesis) and method (GFAP-TK or X-irradiation) as main factors. Note that the Results do not report interaction effects for the main factors in the ANOVAs because they were not significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThe studies described have been reviewed and approved by The Scripps Research Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Wild-type C57Bl/6 mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the closed breeding colony of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI).\n\nChronic Hypoxia Model\nWild-type C57Bl/6 littermate mice, 8-10 weeks of age, were housed 4 to a cage, and placed into a hypoxic chamber (Biospherix, Redfield, NY) for 7 days maintained at different oxygen levels of 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16% O\n2\n. Control mice were kept in the same room under similar conditions except that they were kept at ambient sea-level oxygen levels (normoxia, approximately 21% O\n2\nat sea-level) for the duration of the experiment. In subsequent experiments, mice were maintained at 8% and 13% O\n2\nfor periods of 7 and 14 days. Every few days, the chamber was briefly opened for cage cleaning and food and water replacement as needed.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and antibodies\nImmunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (\nMilner and Campbell 2002\n) on 10 \u03bcm frozen sections of cold phosphate buffer saline (PBS) perfused brains taken from mice subject to either normoxia (control) or hypoxic conditions. The following monoclonal antibodies were obtained from BD Pharmingen (La Jolla, CA): rat monoclonal antibodies reactive for: CD31 (clone MEC13.3), CD 105 (clone MJ7/18), and the integrin subunit \u03b1 (clone 5H10-27 (MFR5)). Other antibodies used included: rabbit anti-fibronectin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), mouse anti-\u03b1-SMA-Cy3 conjugate (Sigma, clone 1A4), rabbit anti-claudin-5 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and rabbit anti-Ki67 (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Secondary antibodies used included goat anti-rabbit Cy3 (Jackson Immunoresearch, Baltimore, PA) and anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen).\n\nImage analysis\nImages were taken using a 20X objective on a Zeiss Imager M1.m. All analysis was performed in the frontal lobe region of the brain. For each antigen, three images were taken per region at 10X or 20X magnification and the mean calculated for each subject over three different sections. All data analysis was performed using the Perkin Elmer Volocity software (Waltham, MA). This includes quantification of total vessel (CD31-positive) area, numbers of CD31/Ki67 dual-positive cells, \u03b1-SMA-positive vessels, \u03b15 integrin-positive vessels, low intensity CD105 vessels and the size distribution of vessels. To quantify the mean expression levels of vascular fibronectin, \u03b15 integrin, CD105, and claudin-5, Volocity software was used to measure the fluorescent intensity of each vessel, and thereby calculate the mean vessel intensity per field of view for each hypoxic condition. Each experiment was performed with four different animals per condition, and the results expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical significance was assessed by using the Student's t test, in which p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll procedures involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Florida. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (N=23) were obtained from Harlan Inc. (Indianapolis, IN, USA). The experimental design did not require uninjured animals since our\na priori\npurpose and hypotheses focused on whether or not a phrenic motor response (i.e., hypoxia-induced STP), which has been well documented in spinal-intact animals (\nLee et al., 2009\n), could also be evoked after SCI. Thus, in accordance with the recommendations of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) and the University of Florida IACUC we studied only C2Hx animals, and this served to reduce the number of experimental animals needed to complete this study. The C2Hx lesion was surgically induced at 3 months of age (93\u00b11 day), and all terminal neurophysiology procedures were done approximately 3 months post-injury (11\u00b11 wks).\n\nSpinal cord injury\nThese procedures were adapted from our prior reports (\nDougherty et al., 2012a\n;\nDougherty et al., 2012b\n). Animals were anesthetized by xylazine (10 mg/kg, s.c.) and ketamine (140 mg/kg, i.p., Fort Dodge Animal Health, USA), and then placed in the prone position. A dorsal cervical incision was made from the base of the skull to the C3 spinal segment followed by laminectomy and durotomy at C2. A C2Hx lesion was induced on the left side using a micro-scalpel followed by aspiration. The dura and overlying muscles were sutured with 9-0 suture (Ethicon, USA) and 4\u20130 polyglycolic acid suture (Webster Veterinary, USA), respectively. The skin was then closed with stainless steel wound clips (Stoelting, USA). Following surgery, yohimbine (1.2 mg/kg, s.c., Lloyd, USA) was given to reverse the effect of xylazine. Animals were then given sterile lactated Ringers solution (5 ml s.c.) and an analgesic (buprenorphine, 0.03 mg/kg, s.c., Hospira, USA). The post-surgical care protocol included daily injection of lactated Ringers solution (5 ml, s.c.) and a high calorie oral supplement (Nutri-cal, 1\u20133 ml, Webster Veterinary, USA) until adequate volitional drinking and eating resumed.\n\nNeurophysiology preparation\nIsoflurane anesthesia (3\u20134%) was induced in a closed chamber and then maintained via nose cone (2\u20133%). Rats were tracheotomized and mechanically ventilated (model 683; Harvard Apparatus, Inc., USA) with a hyperoxic gas mixture (50\u201360% O\n2\n, balance N\n2\n). The tidal volume was set at 7 ml/kg and frequency maintained at 60\u201370 per minute. Rectal temperature was monitored by an electrical thermometer and maintained at 37.5\u00b11\u00b0C by a servo-controlled heating pad (model TC-1000, CWE Inc., USA). The femoral vein was catheterized (PE-50) to enable conversion to urethane anesthesia (1.6 g/kg, i.v., Sigma, USA) and delivery of a neuromuscular blocking agent (pancuronium bromide, 2.5 mg/kg, i.v., Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, USA). Another catheter was inserted into the femoral artery for blood pressure measurement (Statham P-10EZ pressure transducer, CP122 AC/DC strain gauge amplifier, Grass Instruments, USA). The vagus nerves were isolated in the mid-cervical region and sectioned to prevent entrainment of phrenic bursting with the rate of the ventilator. The vagotomy procedure has been used extensively in studies of respiratory neuroplasticity and also crossed phrenic activity after C2Hx (\nDoperalski and Fuller, 2006\n;\nLee et al., 2010a\n). This procedure helps to ensure standardized conditions across animals and within each experiment, which is an important consideration for basic studies of hypoxia-induced plasticity. However, activation of vagal afferent neurons has an inhibitory influence on ipsilateral phrenic motor output after C2Hx (\nLee et al., 2010a\n), and accordingly the vagotomy is likely to have increased the relative activity of ipsilateral PhrMNs. The end-tidal CO\n2\npartial pressure (P\nET\nCO\n2\n) was monitored throughout the experiment using a Capnogard neonatal CO\n2\nmonitor placed on the expired line of the ventilator circuit (Novametrix Medical Systems, Wallingford, USA).\nThe phrenic nerves were isolated in the cervical region via a ventral approach and sectioned distally (\nLee et al., 2009\n;\nLee et al., 2010a\n). Activity of both phrenic nerves were recorded by silver hook electrodes, and then amplified (1000x, Model 1700, A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA, USA), band-pass filtered (0.3\u201310 kHz), full-wave rectified and integrated (time constant 100 ms; model MA-1000; CWE Inc., USA). In some of the experiments, the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to C2Hx (i.e. left side) was stripped of connective tissue, desheathed and then separated into small filaments to enable extracellular recording of PhrMN action potentials (\nLee et al., 2013\n;\nLee et al., 2009\n). All signals were digitized using Cambridge Electronic Design (CED) Power 1401 data acquisition interface and a sampling frequency of 10 KHz for the raw neural signals and 100 Hz for the blood pressure and integrated neural signals. These data were recorded on a PC and analyzed using Spike 2 software (CED Limited, UK).\n\nExperimental protocols\nIn the first protocol, bilateral phrenic nerve activity was recorded to investigate hypoxia-induced phrenic STP following chronic C2Hx (N=12). After establishing stable phrenic nerve recordings, P\nET\nCO\n2\nwas gradually reduced by increasing the rate of the mechanical ventilator until rhythmic bursting in the right phrenic nerve (i.e. contralateral to C2Hx) ceased for at least 2 minutes. The ventilator rate was then gradually decreased until inspiratory phrenic bursting reappeared, and this point was designated as the P\nET\nCO\n2\nrecruitment threshold. P\nET\nCO\n2\nwas then maintained at 2\u20133 mmHg above the recruitment threshold during all subsequent experimental procedures. After a stable baseline recording was maintained for at least 10 minutes, the animal was exposed to a three minute bout of hypoxia (12\u201314% O\n2\n, balance N\n2\n). Following hypoxia, both inspired O\n2\nand P\nET\nCO\n2\nlevels were regulated at the baseline levels.\nA second experimental protocol was used to study the discharge patterns of PhrMNs ipsilateral to C2Hx during hypoxia-induced STP. In these experiments, the right phrenic nerve and a left \u201cphrenic filament\u201d were recorded were recorded in 23 rats. Twelve of these rats were also studied as part of the first experimental protocol. Identification of PhrMNs which were inactive (i.e., silent) at baseline was accomplished by maintaining P\nET\nCO\n2\n10 mmHg above the recruitment threshold during the initial action potential recordings. After PhrMN recordings were established, the P\nET\nCO\n2\nwas returned to 2\u20133 mmHg above the recruitment threshold. A three minute bout of hypoxia (12\u201314 % O\n2\n, balance N\n2\n) was then used to induce STP.\nAll rats were exposed to identical experimental conditions, but arterial blood gases and pH were measured in a subset of animals (N=13) from 0.2 ml arterial blood samples (i-Stat, Heska, USA) during baseline and the final minute of hypoxia.\nPrevious authors have defined hypoxia-induced STP as the progressive augmentation of respiratory motor output that typically follows the acute hypoxic response (i.e., an \u201conset phase\u201d), and the short-lasting increase in phrenic activity that persists upon removal of the hypoxic stimulus (an \u201coffset phase\u201d) (\nLee et al., 2009\n;\nPowell et al., 1998\n). In this study, we focused on the post-hypoxia phrenic response, and therefore defined STP as an increase in phrenic nerve burst amplitude or PhrMN discharge rate (i.e., above pre-hypoxia baseline values) that was present during the period of 2:30\u20133:00 (minutes:seconds) following the hypoxic exposure.\n\nSpinal cord histology\nAt the end of the neurophysiology protocol, animals were systemically perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma, USA). The cervical spinal cord was removed, cryoprotected and sectioned at 40 \u03bcm using a vibratome. Spinal cord tissue sections were mounted on glass slides (Fisher Scientific, USA) and stained with the cresyl violet. The tissue sections were evaluated by light microscopy, and a C2Hx lesion was confirmed in each case by the absence of apparently healthy white and grey matter in the left C2 spinal cord (\nLee et al., 2010a\n).\n\nData analyses\nInspiratory (T\nI\n) and expiratory duration (T\nE\n) were calculated from the phrenic neurograms recorded contralateral to the lesion as previously described (\nLee et al., 2013\n;\nLee et al., 2009\n;\nLee et al., 2010a\n). Respiratory frequency (bursts*min\n\u22121\n) was calculated as 60/(T\nI\n+ T\nE\n). Phrenic burst amplitude was defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum value of the integrated phrenic neurogram during a respiratory cycle. Burst amplitude data were expressed as arbitrary units (a.u.) and also normalized relative to baseline activity (% baseline) and relative to the maximal response recorded during the protocol (% max). All normalization procedures were done in comparison to the same neurogram (i.e., ipsilateral normalized to ipsilateral).\nSome PhrMNs were inactive during the normocapnic baseline condition but were recruited during hypoxia. These motoneurons were classified as \u201csilent\u201d. Cells which discharged throughout the whole respiratory cycle during the baseline were classified as \u201ctonic\u201d. Parameters which were analyzed included the PhrMN discharge onset, frequency, duration and spike number. The burst onset time of PhrMNs was calculated using the right phrenic neurogram as an index of the respiratory cycle (e.g.,\nFig. 1\n). Discharge frequency was calculated by dividing the total spike number per inspiratory effort by the total discharge duration (i.e., the period between the first and last spike). Spike number was measured as the total number of spikes per inspiratory effort. These values were calculated during the 30 seconds immediately preceding hypoxia (i.e., the baseline period), the initial and final 30 seconds of hypoxia exposure, and for the final 30 seconds of the three minute post-hypoxic period.\nFig. 1. Representative data illustrating the impact of hypoxia on phrenic (Phr) nerve activity recorded ipsilateral (IL) and contralateral (CL) to C2Hx.\nOpen in a new tab\nThe \u222b Phr trace represents the moving averaged or \u201cintegrated\u201d signal. Panel B shows expanded time scale traces depicting a single neural breath taken from the areas indicated by i-iv in panel A. The horizontal solid line indicates the period of hypoxia exposure. Phrenic motor output recorded ipsilateral to the C2Hx lesion is relatively low during baseline (i) but shows a robust increase during hypoxia (ii and iii). Following hypoxia, the burst amplitude in both phrenic nerve recordings remains elevated above baseline values (iv). BP: Blood pressure\nThe impact of hypoxia on phrenic nerve bursting was examined using a one-way repeated measurement analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test. Two way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare the hypoxic response of the contralateral\nvs\n. ipsilateral phrenic nerves and silent PhrMNs showing post-hypoxia STP\nvs\n. those that did not. Changes in PhrMN firing were analyzed using one-way repeated measures ANOVA. All data are presented as the mean \u00b1 1 standard error. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll mouse breeding and protocols were approved by the Johns Hopkins IACUC. Breeding colonies of MCT1 Het mice, obtained from Luc Pellerin and Pierre Magistretti, and BAC MCT1 tdTomato reporter mice (MCT1 Rep), previously described(\nLee, Morrison et al. 2012\n), were maintained at Johns Hopkins University. MCT1 Het and MCT1 Rep mice were both on a C57Bl6 background. Proteolipid protein (PLP) eGFP reporter mice (\nMallon, Shick et al. 2002\n), provided by Dr. Dwight Bergles,, were on a B6/SJL mixed background.\n\nSciatic Nerve Crush\nFor nerve crush, 90\u2013110 day old male transgenic (i.e., MCT1 Het null, BAC MCT1 tdTomato reporter, or PLP-GFP reporter) or litter-mate wild-type mice were anesthetized with 2% isofluorane/oxygen, lateral thigh shaved, and a 1 cm incision in the skin made over the lateral femur, as published previously (\nMa, Omura et al. 2011\n). The muscle layers were split with blunt scissors, the sciatic nerve localized and crushed with a ultra-fine, smooth, straight hemostat (tip width 0.6 mm/ Fine Science Tools) for 20 seconds. The skin incision was closed with surgical staples and animals allowed to recover on a warming blanket. At various time points following nerve crush, mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate, perfused, either with saline or 4% paraformaldehyde, and dissected for dorsal root ganglia (DRG), spinal cord, sciatic nerve (both proximal and distal to crush zone), sural nerve, tibial nerve, and/or muscle. Mice were perfused with saline when isolating mRNA or protein to wash out red blood cells that express high amounts of MCT1 (\nDubinsky and Racker 1978\n;\nGarcia, Brown et al. 1995\n). The investigator performing the surgeries was blinded to the genotype of the mice.\n\nMuscle histology and neuromuscular junction quantification\nIn one cohort of WT and MCT1 Het mice, mice were anesthetized by an overdose of chloral hydrate and sacrificed by cervical dislocation (without transcardial perfusion) 6 weeks following sciatic nerve crush. Gastrocnemius muscles ipsilateral and contralateral to sciatic nerve crush were dissected, weighed, and either partly embedded in tragacanth and quick frozen in dry-ice cooled 2-methylbutane (for muscle histology) or cryoprotected in 25% sucrose, stretched and frozen in O.C.T. Tissue Tek compound (Fisher; for neuromuscular junction (NMJ) staining). For histology, gastrocnemius muscle sections (20 \u03bcm) were cut transversely on a cryostat and processed with hematoxylin and eosin. For NMJ staining, gastrocnemius muscle sections (40 \u03bcm) were cut longitudinally onto slides with a cryostat, incubated with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes, washed in PBS, blocked in 5% normal goat serum (in PBS with 0.3% Triton-X) and then incubated in primary antibody to synapsin (1:1000; R and D systems) for 2 days at 4\u00b0C. Following washes with PBS, the slides were then incubated simultaneously with biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Vector Laboratories) and tetramethyl rhodamine-conjugated \u03b1-bungarotoxin (1:50; Life Technologies) for two hours at room temperature. Finally, slides were washed in PBS, incubated in Streptavidin conjugated to Alexa-Fluor 488 (1:1000; Invitrogen) for 1 hour and coverslipped with Prolong Gold (Life Technologies). Quantification of NMJ staining (double-labelled or innervated post-synaptic NMJs versus total post-synaptic NMJs) was completed manually on a Nikon E800 fluorescence microscope by an investigator blinded to the animals\u2019 genotype.\n\nElectrophysiology\nPrior to and 2 weeks following nerve crush, mice were evaluated for recovery of compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) and conduction velocities biweekly through 6 weeks post-crush. These were completed by inserting stimulating electrodes in the sciatic notch in the vicinity of the proximal sciatic nerve, recording electrodes in the lateral plantar muscles of the foot pad, and a ground in the tail. All studies were completed with a Neurosoft-Evidence 3102 electromyograph. The stimulation parameters were a current of 10mA, duration of 0.05ms, and frequency of 1 Hz, and were designed to provide maximal stimulation of sciatic nerve. The investigator conducting the electrophysiology was blinded to the genotype of the mice throughout the study.\n\nMCT1 Antibody Production\nMCT1 antibody was produced for the Rothstein laboratory by Aves Labs (Tigard). Using proprietary software, the company identified an appropriate antigen (amino acids 477-493 at the C-terminus of the mouse protein) and conjugated this peptide to KLH. The antigen-KLH complex was used to immunize two chickens, the serum affinity purified and antibody production verified by ELISA. We further validated the antibody by Western blots of brain and sciatic nerves from wild-type and MCT1 Het mice and HEK cells expressing recombinant MCT1 protein (\nSuppl. Fig. 1A\n). Specificity of primary antibody was confirmed by blocking experiments (negative control) and recombinant MCT1 protein (positive control). For the blocking experiments in Western blots, the primary antibody was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with or without antigen peptide (MCT1 amino acids 477-493; concentration 5-fold primary antibody) prior to application to membrane. For the immunofluorescence blocking experiments, the primary antibody was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with or without antigen peptide (5-fold primary antibody) prior to application to sections. The positive control was HEK cells transfected with a lentivirus expressing the full MCT1 protein. These HEK cells were lysed and homogenized in TPER prior to running 50 \u03bcg of protein on Western blot.\n\nReal-time RT PCR and Western blots\nIn dissected DRG or nerve, MCT1 mRNA was isolated by RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), reverse transcribed to cDNA with High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) and quantified by real-time RT PCR using Taqman probes (Applied Biosystems) for MCT1 relative to 18sRNA (DRG), actin, or peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA; nerves) on a StepOne Plus RT-PCR System (Applied Biosystems). These housekeeping genes were chosen based on preliminary and/or published data (\nGirolami, Bouhy et al. 2010\n) that demonstrated gene expression to be stable following nerve crush. For Western blots, sciatic nerves, either proximal or distal to the crush, were homogenized in T-PER (Thermo Scientific) and run on Mini-Protean TGX Gels (10%; Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). For all Western blots, 5 \u03bcg of sciatic nerves and 20 \u03bcg of brain were run on the gel. Membranes were incubated overnight with Rabbit polyclonal \u03b2-actin antibodies (AbCam; 1:3000) and visualized with Amersham ECL Reagant (GE Healthcare) on ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare). After visualizing \u03b2-actin, blots were stripped with Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Scientific), reprobed overnight with chicken antibodies specific for mouse MCT1 (Rothstein laboratory; 1:300), and again visualized by ECL reagent, as described above.\n\nImmunofluorescence and Electron Microscopy\nFollowing transcardial perfusion with paraformaldehyde and dissection, as described above, tissue for immunofluorescence was post-fixed for 4 hours in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected in 20% sucrose and sectioned on a Leica CM1900 cryostat. Sections (20 \u03bcm thickness) were immunostained on slides for MCT1 (Rothstein lab; 1:500), S100 (Dako; 1:500), MAC2 (CedarLane; 1:1000), claudin-1 (Novus Biologicals; 1:200), non-phosphorylated or phosphorylated neurofilament (SMI32; Covance; 1:5000 or SMI31; Covance; 1:5000, respectively) either alone or in combination. Photomicrographs were taken on Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal microscope. MAC2 immunofluorescent intensity was quantified by taking three randomly placed photomicrographs on the confocal microscope from each WT and MCT1 Het sciatic nerve post-crush, importing these images and quantifying in NIH Image J. For electron microscopy or semi-thin nerve histology, perfused nerves were post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/2.5% glutaraldehyde for at least 3 days and embedded in Epon 812 resin. Embedded nerves were cut either semi-thin (1 \u03bcm) and stained with toluidine blue or thin (70 nm) and stained with citrate/uranyl acetate. Toluidine blue stained nerves were used for quantification of myelinated axon number, myelin debris, or g-ratios. For each of these histologic features, photomicrographs of sural nerves were taken on Nikon E800, imported and quantified manually with Zeiss AxioVision 4.8 software. G-ratios were calculated as the ratio of the diameter of axons divided by the diameter of myelin sheaths. If more than one fascicle was present in sample, the largest nerve fascicle was quantified in its entirety. The researcher quantifying the nerves was blinded to transgene status. EM photomicrographs were produced on a Zeiss Libra transmission electron microscope.\n\nStatistics\nStudent\u2019s t-test was used to compare CMAP amplitudes (\nFigs. 2C\n,\n3\n), axon number (\nFig. 2A\n), conduction velocity (\nFig. 2D\n), and MAC2 immunofluorescence intensity (\nFig. 7B\n). Log rank test was used to compare groups in time to recover compound motor action potentials (CMAPs;\nFig. 3A\n). One-way ANOVA with Sidak\u2019s multiple comparison tests was used to compare groups for MCT densitometry (\nFig. 1C\n), CMAP amplitudes (\nFig. 3C\n), muscle weights (\nFig. 3G\n), neuromuscular junction (NMJ) innervation (\nFig. 3H\n), G-ratios (\nFig. 8C\n), and CMAP latencies (\nFig. 8D\n). One-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison tests was used for MCT1 densitometry and mRNA (\nFigs. 4B,C\n,\n5H\n). Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test was used to compare groups for myelinated axon number (\nFig. 3C, D\n) and myelin debris over time (\nFig. 8\n).\nFigure 2.

    "Methods": "Animals and Surgical Preparation\nAll experiments for these studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Loma Linda University. A total of 157 postnatal Day 10 Sprague-Dawley rat pups (P10, weighing 14\u201320g) were used, of which 12 died while in the hypoxia chamber and were not included in the study (no significance for the mortality was observed between any of the groups). Both male and female animals were used in this study.\nAnimals were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane delivered with medical gas. Surgical procedures began after determining an adequate plane of anesthesia via the loss of paw pinch reflex. Reflex activity was monitored continuously throughout the surgery.\n\nModel of Neonatal Hypoxia-Ischemia Injury\nInduction of unilateral HI was performed in P10 rat pups as previously described (\nCalvert et al., 2006\n;\nChen et al., 2011\n;\nRice et al., 1981\n). Briefly, anesthetized P10 pups were subjected to unilateral right common carotid ligation using 5-0 surgical silk suture. Surgery time was controlled to be less than 5 minutes to maximize the infarct volume and minimize the standard deviation (\nChen et al., 2011\n). All surgical or isoflurane exposure times greater than 5 minutes were excluded.\nAnimals were allowed to recover for 1hr after surgery, and then placed in a hypoxia chamber (8% O\n2\nand 92% N\n2\n) kept in a temperature-controlled water bath at 37\u00b0C for 2.5hrs. The flow rate of the gas was 93.82mL/min for the first 1.25hrs and 77.30mL/min for the final 1.25hrs. After hypoxia, all animals were returned to their dams. Sham animals underwent the HI surgical procedures (\ni.e.\nexposure of the common carotid artery), but the artery was not ligated and the animals were exposed to normoxic conditions.\n\nExperimental Conditions and Pharmacological Interventions\nIn this study, the role of the G-CSF signaling pathway on GSK-3\u03b2 and consequent apoptosis following HI was examined using the following interventions: GSK-3\u03b2 siRNA, G-CSF receptor siRNA (G-CSFR siRNA), control siRNA, and Wortmannin.\nG-CSF (50\u03bcg/kg,Amgen Inc. Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) was given subcutaneously (sc) 1hr after removal from the hypoxia chamber. The following experimental groups studied to understand the effects of various antagonists with G-CSF treatment were: (1) Sham (n=15), (2) HI (n=33), (3) HI + control siRNA (n=6), (4) HI + GSK-3\u03b2 siRNA (n=14), (5) HI + G-CSF (n=14), (6) HI + G-CSF + control siRNA (n=16), (7) HI + G-CSF + G-CSFR siRNA (n=18), (8) HI + G-CSF + DMSO (vehicle for Wortmannin) (n=12), and (9) HI + G-CSF + Wortmannin (n=15).\nA solution of siRNA from two companies (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Danvers, MA, USA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA, USA) were combined into a single intracerebroventricular injection (4\u03bcL, 2\u03bcL of each siRNA) 48hrs before HI using a 10\u03bcL syringe (Hamilton, Nevada, USA) and stereotaxic apparatus that guided injection at 1.5mm posterior and 1.5mm lateral of bregma and 1.7mm below the dura in the contralateral hemisphere. The same volume of scramble siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA, USA) was administered as a control (control siRNA).\nG-CSF receptor siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA, USA, resuspended in RNA-free water) was stereotaxically injected (0.1/0.4nM, 2\u03bcL) 48hrs before HI using the same coordinates. The control group (control siRNA) was shared with the previous group.\nWortmannin (diluted in 2% DMSO, 86ng/pup, 2\u03bcL, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) was stereotaxically injected 1hr before HI at 2.0mm posterior and 2.0mm lateral of bregma and 2.0mm deep from the skull surface in the contralateral hemisphere. The same volume of 2% DMSO (diluted in saline, Sigma Aldrich, Inc., St-Louis, MO, USA) was administered as a control.\n\nTime course of GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation, GSK-3\u03b2, CC3, Bcl-2, and Bax after HI\nIn order to identify the time at which the maximum levels of p-GSK-3\u03b2, CC3, Bcl-2 and Bax occur, 30 animals were sacrificed at 0, 12, 24, 48 or 72hrs after HI (n=6/time), and ipsilateral hemispheres were collected to quantify p-GSK-3\u03b2, GSK-3\u03b2, CC3, Bcl-2, and Bax expression levels using Western Blot.\n\nExpression of Phosphorylated GSK-3\u03b2, GSK-3\u03b2, CC3, Bcl-2, and Bax 48hrs Following HI after Administering GSK-3\u03b2 siRNA\nTo measure the expression of p-GSK-3\u03b2, GSK-3\u03b2, CC3, Bcl-2, and Bax after administering GSK-3\u03b2 siRNA following HI (48hrs post-HI), animals were divided into 4 groups: Sham and HI (shared with the previous groups), HI + control siRNA, HI + GSK-3\u03b2 siRNA (n=6/group). Ipsilateral hemispheres were isolated to quantify p-GSK-3\u03b2, GSK-3\u03b2, CC3, Bcl-2, and Bax expression levels using Western Blot.\n\nMeasuring Infarct Volume\nInfarct volume was evaluated 48hrs after surgery with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazoliumchloride monohydrate (TTC) (Sigma Aldrich, Inc., St-Louis, MO USA) as previously described (\nLi et al., 2012\n;\nZhou et al., 2009\n). Briefly, 46 animals were euthanized and their brains removed, cut into 2mm slices using a rat brain matrix, incubated in 2% TTC solution for 5min in the dark, washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and then fixed in 10% formaldehyde. Brain infarct size was measured using ImageJ (Version 1.43u; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Infarct volume was calculated as:\nInfarct\nVolume\n=\nLeft\nHemisphere\nVolume\n-\nRight\nNonischemic\nVolume\n2\n\u00d7\nLeft\nHemisphere\nVolume\n\nImmunohistochemistry and TUNEL Staining\nUnder deep anesthesia, 18 pups were perfused transcardiacally with 0.1M PBS followed by 4% formaldehyde solution (PFA) 48hrs after HI. The brains were removed and post-fixed (4% PFA, 4\u00b0C, 24hrs), then transferred into a 30% sucrose solution for 2 days. Cryoprotected brains were sectioned into 10\u03bcm thick slices with a cryostat (Leica LM3050S) for double fluorescence staining.\nBrain slices were washed with 0.1M PBS 3 times and then incubated with blocking solution (10% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1M PBS) for 2hrs at room temperature. Primary antibodies anti-NeuN (1:200, Millipore, Inc., Billerica, MA,USA), anti-G-CSFR (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA, USA), anti-phospho-GSK-3\u03b2 (Tyr216,1:200, abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA,USA), anti-CC3 (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) were applied at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were then washed with 0.1M PBS and incubated for 2hrs at room temperature with secondary antibodies (anti-goat IgG labeled with Alexa Fluor-488, anti-rabbit IgG labeled with Alexa Fluor-568, anti-mouse IgG labeled with Alexa Fluor-568, anti-rabbit IgG labeled with Alexa Fluor-488, 1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase\u2013mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) (\nin situ\nCell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein, Roche Inc., Mannheim, Germany) was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Roche). Microphotographs were analyzed with a fluorescent microscope (Olympus BX51) and the Magna Fire SP system (Olympus).\n\nWestern Blot\nWestern blot was performed as described previously (\nChen et al., 2008\n). Animals were euthanized at various time points after HI. After transcardiac perfusion with cold PBS (pH 7.4) solution, brains were removed and quickly separated into ipsilateral and contralateral cerebrums. Samples were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. Whole-cell lysates were obtained by gently homogenizing tissue in RIPA lysis buffer (sc-24948, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., TX, USA) then centrifuged at 14,000g at 4\u00b0C for 30min. The supernatant, containing whole cell protein extract, was collected and the protein concentration was measured using a detergent compatible assay (Bio-Rad, Dc protein assay). Equal amounts of protein (50\u03bcg) were loaded into a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. After being electrophoresed and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat blocking grade milk (Bio-Rad, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) and incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. The primary antibodies used were anti-Actin (1:4000, Santa Cruz Biotecnology, Inc., CA, USA), anti-G-CSFR (1:4000), anti-p-GSK-3\u03b2, anti-GSK-3\u03b2 (1:10000, abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-p-Akt (Ser473), anti-Akt, anti-CC3, anti-Bcl-2, and anti-Bax (1:8000, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA). Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (1:8000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA, USA) for 1hr at room temperature.\nMore specifically, during the detection process, the membrane was cut into 3 strips according to their molecular weight. The first membrane strip included the proteins ranging from 80\u2013185kDa, the proteins in the second membrane contained proteins from 35\u201380kDa, and the third membrane contained proteins from 10\u201335kDa. The first membrane was incubated with the primary antibody for G-CSFR (rabbit, 90kDa) only. The second membrane was incubated with the primary antibody for \u03b2-actin (goat, 47kDa) and Akt (mouse, 55kDa), and re-blotted for p-Akt (mouse, 60kDa) and p-GSK-3\u03b2 (rabbit, 49kDa) or GSK-3\u03b2 (rabbit, 47kDa) after stripped. The third membrane was incubated with the primary antibody for Bcl-2 (rabbit, 26kDa) and Bax (mouse, 21kDa), and then stripped for Bax and Bcl-2 detection.\nAfter incubation with the secondary antibodies, immunoblots were then probed via ECL Plus chemiluminescence reagent kit (Fisher Scientific International, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and analyzed using ImageJ (4.0, Media Cybernetics, Silver Springs, MD). All Western blot data was analyzed by taking the ratios of the pixel intensities for the target protein to that of \u03b2-actin. The ratios were then normalized with respect to the pixel intensity ratio of the Sham group.\n\nStatistics\nData is expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. Statistical differences between more than two groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post-hoc analysis. A p<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAdult C57BL6 mice were purchased from Charles River. DLK conditional knockout (KO) mice (DLK\nf/f\n;Adv-CRE\n+/\u2212\n) were generated by crossing floxed DLK (DLK\nf/f\n) mice (\nMiller et al., 2009\n) with Advillin-Cre mice (\nZurborg et al., 2011\n). Control and DLK conditional KO mice were age and sex-matched. Mouse husbandry was performed under the supervision of Division of Comparative Medicine at Washington University.\n\nPrimary DRG Neuron Culture\nNeurons from cervical, thoracic, and lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) display enhanced growth after replating, indicating that DRG from all levels activate a pro-regenerative response when dissociated. Thus, all DRG were dissected from adult mice and pooled. DRG were incubated in an enzyme solution containing 0.35 mg/mL Liberase Blendzyme (Roche), 10 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 0.6 mg/mL DNase (Sigma) for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0C. After 15 minutes, the enzyme solution was removed and DRG were digested with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Trypsin was removed and replaced with DMEM (Invitrogen) culture media containting 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen). DRG were triturated with a plastic pipet tip and diluted in culture media. Cells were plated at a density of 0.7-1.4 DRG/mL.\nLab-Tek Permanox chamber slides (Fisher Scientific) or plastic tissue culture plates were coated with 10 mg/mL PDL (Sigma) overnight. Then the slides/dishes were washed and coated with 10 mg/mL laminin (Sigma) for at least 2 hours before cells were plated. As indicated, some slides were coated with 1 \u03bcg/mL chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG, Millipore) at the time of laminin coating (\nHur et al., 2011\n). CSPGs were a mixture of neurocan, aggregcan, versican, and phosphacan isolated from embryonic chicken brain. To ensure that any growth inhibiting effects were due directly to the CSPGs, neurons were cultured on PDL/laminin/CSPG coated slides that were pre-treated with 0.5 U/mL Chondroitinase ABC (Sigma) for 3 hours. Digestion of the chondrointin sulfate glycosaminoglycans rescued neurite formation and growth (data not shown). Neurons were maintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\n. Media was changed on DIV1, 4, and 7 and 10 nM AraC (Sigma) was added.\n\nReplating Assay and Neurite Length Analysis\nFor the replating assay, media was removed from cultured neurons and replaced with 0.025% Trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen). Neurons were incubated for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\n. Then trypsin was removed and replaced with fresh media. Cells were washed and gently pipetted to detach cell bodies and these were transferred to PDL and laminin coated Lab-Tek Permanox slides for neurite length analysis. After replating, neurons were cultured for 18 hours then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Services) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Triton and blocked with PBS containing 10% goat serum and 0.2% Triton. Next, cells were incubated in mouse anti-Tuj1 primary antibody (Covance, 1:500) with or without rabbit NF200 primary antibody (Sigma, 1:1000) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Then cells were washed in PBS containing 0.1% Triton followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse AF488 (Life Technologies, 1:1000) for at least 1 hour. Goat anti-rabbit Cy3 (Jackson Immuno, 1:1000) was used to detect NF200. Finally, cells were washed in 0.1% Triton PBS, mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and sealed with clear nail polish. Neurons were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope using a 10x air objective. Approximately 100 neurons were imaged per condition for each experiment and the length of the longest neurite was measured using the Neurite Tracer Plugin for Image J (\nPool et al., 2008\n). At least 3 independent experiments were used. Representative images were obtained using Nikon D-Eclipse C1 confocal microscope with 20X air objective.\n\nPharmacology\nJNK inhibitor (SP600125, Sigma) was applied to neurons immediately after dissociation at a final concentration of 15 \u03bcM. Twenty-four hours after treatment, vehicle (DMSO) and JNK inhibitor were removed by washing with DMEM. Neurons were then replated as described above. Forskolin (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 30 \u03bcM. Vehicle (DMSO) or forskolin were applied 24 hours before replating (pre-treatment and pre/post treatment). Immediately preceding replating, neurons were washed with DMEM to remove drugs before trypsinization. After replating vehicle or forskolin were added back to neurons in the pre/post- and post-treatment groups.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nNeurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Services) for 20 minutes at room temperature and then washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Triton and blocked with PBS containing 10% goat serum and 0.2% Triton. Cells were then incubated in mouse anti-Tuj1 (Covance, 1:500) and rabbit anti-phospho-cJun (p-cJun, Cell Signaling, 1:300) or rabbit anti-SCG10 ((\nShin et al., 2014\n), 1:5000), or rabbit anti-GAP43 (Millipore, 1:500) overnight at 4\u00b0C. SCG10 antibody was purified from Anti-SCG10 rabbit antiserum (Novus Biologicals) using the SulfoLink Kit (Thermo). Then cells were washed in PBS containing 0.1% Triton followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse AF488 (Life Technologies, 1:1000) and goat anti-rabbit Cy3 (Jackson Immuno, 1:1000) secondary antibodies for at least 1 hour. Finally cells were washed in 0.1% Triton, mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and sealed with clear nail polish. For intensity measurements of p-cJun, SCG10, and GAP43 staining, at least 50 cells per condition for each experiment were imaged using a Nikon D-Eclipse C1 confocal microscope with 40X oil immersion objective. All groups within an experiment were imaged with the same gain. Gain was set based on signal in the 24 hr/DIV1 condition such that the signal was not saturated. Nuclear p-cJun and somal SCG10 and GAP43 intensities were measured using ImageJ. \u03b2III-tubulin was used as a counter stain to identify neurons. At least 3 independent experiments were used. Representative images were obtained using a 60X oil immersion objective.\n\nQuantitative Real-Time PCR\nNeurons were cultured for the indicated duration before RNA was extracted using a standard trizol protocol. Briefly, neurons were treated with Trizol (Ambion), followed by chloroform and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 12,000 g (4\u00b0C). The aqueous fraction was collected and treated with glycogen (Roche). Then the aqueous fraction was washed with isopropanol and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature before centrifugation for 10 minutes at 12,000 g (4\u00b0C). The isopropanol wash was removed and the pellet was washed with 75% EtOH and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 7,400 g (4\u00b0C). After centrifugation the EtOH was removed and the pellet was air-dried for 5-10 minutes before being resuspended in RNAse-free water. RNA samples were treated with the RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C to remove any contaminating genomic DNA. The DNase reaction was terminated using the RQ1 stop solution (Promega) and incubating at 65\u00b0C for 10 minutes. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using Quanta Biosciences qScript cDNA synthesis kit according to manufacturer's instructions. The resulting cDNA was diluted for quantitative RT-PCR and an equivalent amount of DNase-treated RNA was used to confirm the absence of genomic DNA. Quanta Biosciences PerfeCTa SYBR Green FastMix with Rox was used for quantitative RT-PCR. Primers included: Galanin (Forward: 5\u2019-GCCCACATGCCATTGACAAC-3\u2019, Reverse: 5\u2019-CGGACAATGTTGCTCTCAGG-3\u2019), Sprr1a (Forward: 5-AGAGAACCTGCTCTTCTCTGAGT-3\u2019, Reverse: 5\u2019- CTGGTGCAGCTGAGGAGGTA-3\u2019), and GAPDH (Forward: 5\u2019-TGTGAACGGATTTGGCCGTA-3\u2019, Reverse: 5\u2019- ACTGTGCCGTTGAATTTGCC-3\u2019)(\nFinelli et al., 2013\n). Standard cDNA curves were used to validate primer sets and melt curve analysis ensured single PCR products. Data was analyzed using the \u0394\u0394CT Method (\nSchmittgen and Livak, 2008\n). Data from each time point was normalized to GAPDH from the same time point and then to the 24 hr/DIV1 timepoint.\n\nStatistics\nStudents t-test, 1-way ANOVA, and 2-way ANOVA were used to determine statistical significance as indicated. Tukey or Bonferroni post hoc tests were performed for mean comparisons following 1-way or 2-way ANOVA, respectively. For experiments described in Figure 9, repeated measures ANOVAs were used. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant."

    "Methods": "Animals and Surgery\nA colony of C57Bl/6 WT and Cx32KO mice were bred in-house. The Cx32KO mice were bred from founders that had been extensively backcrossed into C57Bl/6 (generously provided by S. Bennett, U. Ottawa, Canada). All animals were provided food and water ad libitum and housed according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\nFor nerve crush studies, age-matched, 35\u201337 day-old WT and Cx32KO male mice were induced and anesthetized using isoflorane. With minimal perturbation of the overlying muscle and fascia, the sciatic nerve was exposed and crushed 5 mm distal to the sciatic notch for 30 seconds with ultrafine curved hemostats until translucent. The crush site was then marked with India ink and the skin closed with surgical staples. The mice were allowed to recover in their home cages. To minimize pain, all mice received ibuprofen (4.7ml children\u2019s ibuprofen suspension in 500ml water) for 12h prior to surgery and for 36h following surgery, as per IPUPAC guidelines. Cage mates that did not undergo surgery served as uninjured age-matched controls.\nThe mice were sacrificed at 5, 7, and 14 dpi for tissue collection. A 5mm segment was collected distal to the crush site and stored in RNALater (Ambion) at \u221280\u00b0C, as per manufacturer\u2019s suggestions. For uninjured nerve samples, a 5mm segment was collected distal to the sciatic notch and processed as for crush samples. Nerve samples from four mice were pooled for each time point in an experimental series. Each experimental time series was repeated six times, for a total of six biological replicates.\n\nRNA Purification and Labeling\nRNA was extracted and purified from pooled nerve samples using RNAeasy Lipid Mini kit (Qiagen, Country), as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Purified RNA (500ng) was amplified and labeled using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion/Life Technologies). Biotin-labeled cRNA was stored at \u221280\u00b0C until needed.\n\nMicroarray Hybridization, Quality Control, and Normalization\nLabeled cRNA was outsourced to the Keck Microarray Section of Yale Center for Genome Analysis (Yale University, New Haven, CT) for microarray processing, hybridization, and background normalization using IIlumina MouseRef8-v2 BeadArray BeadChip technology. cRNA quality was confirmed prior to hybridization by the Keck microarray facility. Following hybridization and labeling, the arrays were scanned and the output normalized in BeadStudio (Illumina) for quality control, background, and data export.\nEach BeadArray chip contained eight cRNA samples permitting hybridization of single biological replicate for the full time series: uninjured nerve and nerve at 5, 7 and 14 dpi for Cx32KO and WT samples. Six Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 BeadChips were used for the gene expression analysis, corresponding to six replicate time series and six biological replicates for each time point.\n.Experiments were designed, performed, and analyzed based on MAIME (Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment) guidelines (\nBrazma, 2009\n).\n\nMicroarray Analysis and Statistical Tests\nLog\n2\n-transformed data from all BeadChip experiments were imported from BeadStudio (Illumina) into Partek Genomic Suite for statistical analysis. Following removal of batch effects, mixed-model ANOVA was used to identify differentially expressed genes. Comparisons between Cx32KO and WT at each time point were used to generate lists of DEG based on relative expression levels (fold-change) greater than 1.5 and false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-values (B-H p-Value) derived from the Benjamini-Hochberg step-up procedure (\nBenjamini and Hochberg, 1995\n) to account for multiple testing. FDR-corrected gene lists were also determined for each genotype with respect to time based on comparisons of uninjured versus 5, 7, or 14 dpi.\nFunctional and pathway analyses of gene lists at each time were conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), GOMiner (\nZeeberg et al., 2003\n;\nZeeberg et al., 2005\n), Mouse Genome Database (\nBlake et al., 2014\n), and Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) Batch Query (URL:\nhttp://www.informatics.jax.org\n) online analysis tools. Gene ontology (GO) annotations and GOSlim datasets were obtained or investigator-defined using EMBL QuickGO (URL:\nhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/\n) and MGI Batch Query tools.\n\nReal Time PCR Validation\nRNA was extracted and purified from pooled nerve samples as described. RNA samples were subjected to DNAse treatment (Turbo DNA-free Kit, Ambion) to remove chromosomal DNA contamination and quantitated by absorbance at OD260. cDNA from total RNA (5\u03bcg) was synthesized using the Superscript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer\u2019s suggestions. Qualitative Real Time PCR was performed using 15\u03bcl reactions containing 75ng sciatic nerve cDNA and SsoFast Sybr Green Supermix (Biorad) on a Chromo4 DNA Engine system with Opticon3 Monitor software (Bio-Rad). Validated primer pairs for TATA binding protein, Actin-b, GAPDH, S100b, and, c-fos were obtained from SABiosciences (Qiagen). Sequences for validated primers for CANX, CYC1, and p75\nNGFR\nwere obtained through PrimerBank (Spandidos et al., 2010). The sequences for these primers were as follows: CANX-For ATGGAAGGGAAGTGGTTACTGT; CANX-Rev GCTTTGTAGGTGACCTTTGGAG; CYC1-For CAGCTTCCATTGCGGACAC; CYC1-Rev GGCACTCACGGCAGAATGAA; p75\nNGFR\n-For CAATGTCCACCAGGAAAACGA; p75NGFR-Rev GGAAGTTAGGGGCAAGTCG. Data were preprocessed and analyzed for relative expression levels using GenEx5.4 (MultiD Analyses, Germany). Samples with CT>33 were considered above the limit of detection. Stable housekeeping reference genes were determined for sciatic nerve samples using geNorm and NormFinder programs embedded in GenEx5.4 prior to performing gene expression studies (Vandesompele et al., 2002; Andersen et al., 2004; Mestdagh et al., 2009). Real time PCR experiments were conducted using MIQE guidelines and suggested checklists (Bustin et al., 2009; Bustin et al., 2010)."

    "Methods": "Fluid-percussion injury surgery\nExperimental procedures complied with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of Miami Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were maintained on a 12/12 h light/dark cycle and had free access to food and water. Surgical and temperature groups were prospectively randomized and animals were assessed by individuals that were blinded to the experimental groups. A power analysis was conducted to determine the animal numbers needed to detect a 10% difference in water maze probe trial performance between groups at 80% power and with a significance level of 0.05 (\nTitus et al., 2013\n). The estimated sample size was 12 animals per group. To determine if hyperthermia in combination with a mTBI worsens cognitive recovery, we utilized the parasagittal fluid-percussion injury (FPI) model in adult male Sprague Dawley rats (\nn\n=61, 2\u20134 mos, Charles Rivers Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA). Animals were anesthetized (70% nitrous oxide, 1\u20133% isoflurane, and 30% oxygen) 24 h prior to injury and surgically prepared for FPI as previously described (\nSakurai et al., 2012\n;\nTitus et al., 2013\n). Briefly, anesthesia was induced with 3% isoflurane, 70% nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen, and animals were maintained at 1\u20132% isoflurane, 70% nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen. A 4.8 mm craniotomy (\u22123.8 mm bregma, 2.5 mm lateral) was prepared by trephination over the right parietal cortex and an 18 gauge syringe hub was secured to the craniotomy window with cyanoacrylate and dental cement. After recovery for 24 h during which the animals were fasted and provided water ad libitum, animals were anesthetized (70% nitrous oxide, 1\u20133% isoflurane and 30% oxygen), intubated and mechanically ventilated (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA). A catheter was placed in the tail artery to monitor mean arterial blood pressure and arterial blood samples were used to calculate blood gases (\np\nO\n2\nand\np\nCO\n2\n) and blood pH. Physiological parameters were monitored for at least 15 min prior to the mTBI, within 15 min after the mTBI, and hourly for the surgery duration. After stabilization of physiological parameters, animals received mTBI (1.4\u20131.6 atmospheres) or sham injury. Penicillin/benzathine (20,000 IU/kg, intramuscular) was give once prior to the brain injury surgery, and buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg, subcutaneously) and saline (5 ml, subcutaneously) were given once at the completion of the surgery.\nBeginning 15 min prior to the brain injury, the brain and body temperature of the animals were elevated to a mildly hyperthermic level (39 \u00b0C) or kept at normothermic levels (37 \u00b0C) as previously described (\nSakurai et al., 2012\n). A rectal thermistor was used to monitor core temperature and a thermistor placed into the temporalis muscle was used as an indirect measure of brain temperature (\nJiang et al., 1991\n). Two automatic feedback heating lamps were placed over the animal\u2019s head and body to regulate brain and core temperature. Animals were maintained at normothermia or mild hyperthermia temperatures for 4 h post-injury. To determine if cooling the brain and body to normothermic levels (37 \u00b0C) after hyperthermic mTBI would prevent cognitive deficits, a subgroup of hyperthermic mTBI animals were cooled to normothermic levels at 15 min post-injury and maintained for 4 h post-injury at normothermia. Sham-operated animals received identical surgical and temperature manipulations as mTBI animals but were not injured. Sham animals were maintained for 4 h at normothermia or hyperthermia during the surgery. No significant differences in behavioral outcome on the water maze task or fear conditioning were observed between normothermic sham and hyperthermic sham groups and therefore, the groups were combined.\nCriteria for exclusion from the study were: mortality (one normothermic sham, one normothermic TBI, and one hyperthermic TBI animal, 5% rate), >15% loss of body weight, non-resolving infection at the surgical site (one normothermic sham, one normothermic TBI, and three hyperthermic TBI animals), temperature not maintained at protocol levels for 4 h during surgery (two hyperthermic sham animals), inability to feed or drink, motor paralysis, listlessness (one normothermic sham and one hyperthermic sham animal), self-mutilation, excessive grooming leading to loss of dermal layers, spontaneous vocalization when touched, lack of completion through the behavioral experiments due to minor claw injuries (one normothermic sham and two hyperthermic TBI animals), or poor grooming habits. Animals were evaluated daily after surgery. Due to this exclusion criteria, 4 normothermic sham animals, 3 hyperthermic sham animals, 2 normothermic mTBI animals, 6 hyperthermic mTBI animals, and 0 hyperthermic/normothermic mTBI animals were removed from the study. Final\nn\nvalues were: normothermic sham (\nn\n=5), hyperthermic sham (\nn\n=7), normothermic mTBI (\nn\n=11), hyperthermic mTBI (\nn\n=11), and hyperthermic/normothermic mTBI (\nn\n=12).\n\nCue and contextual fear conditioning\nAnimals were allowed to recover for 7 days, and then evaluated for cue and contextual fear conditioning as previously described (\nTitus et al., 2013\n). This time point was chosen since most concussive symptoms resolve within 7\u201314 days post-injury (\nMcCrea et al., 2003\n;\nVagnozzi et al., 2010\n). On the first day, the animals habituated to the fear conditioning apparatus for 10 min (30.5\u00d724.1\u00d721 cm, Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA, USA). At 24 h following habituation, animals were placed in the apparatus for 180 s. A tone was given during the last 30 s (75 dB, 2.8 kHz). During the last 1 s of the tone, a 1 mA foot shock was delivered through the electrical grid floor. The apparatus was cleaned with 70% ethanol between animals. At 24 h and 3 weeks after training, contextual fear conditioning was assessed by placing the animals in the apparatus for 5 min and measuring freezing. Cue fear conditioning was assessed 1 h after contextual fear conditioning by placing animals in an altered apparatus with different ambient light, white background noise, changed textured chamber floor and walls, and a novel odorant. The animal\u2019s freezing behavior was measured for 3 min. The tone (75 dB, 2.8 kHz) was delivered for the last 1 min. Freezing behavior was measured using video-based analysis (FreezeFrame, Coulburn Instruments). Contextual fear conditioning was analyzed by comparing freezing levels on the training day prior to the tone and foot shock delivery versus the testing day. Cue fear conditioning was analyzed by comparing freezing levels in the novel context prior to the tone presentation versus freezing during the tone. Shock threshold was evaluated by determining the minimum shock intensity to elicit a flinch, jump, and vocalization. Foot shocks were delivered every 30 s in 0.02 mA increments beginning at 0.1 mA. This behavior test was performed at the end of all cognitive testing at 4 weeks post-surgery.\n\nWater maze\nThe standard hidden platform version of the Morris water maze task was used to test spatial memory at 2 weeks post-surgery (\nTitus et al., 2013\n). Acquisition was conducted with 4 trials per day (60 s trial duration) and inter-trial intervals of 4 min. If the rat failed to locate the platform by the end of the trial, the rat was guided to the platform and remained on the platform for 10 s. Probe trial duration was 60 s and assessed 24 h after the last acquisition day. Escape latency, time spent in each quadrant, and swim speed were analyzed with EthoVision software (Noldus Information Technology, Leesburg, VA, USA).\nAt 3 weeks post-surgery, spatial working memory was assessed with a delayed match-to-place task utilizing the water maze (\nHoskison et al., 2009\n). Four paired trials were given each day for 2 days with inter-trial intervals of 4 min. Trial duration was 60 s. The hidden platform remained invariant in location for each pair of trials. Upon reaching the platform, the animal remained on the platform for 10 s. After a 5 s delay, the animal was released into the water to again search for the hidden platform in the same location. Escape latency differences between the first location trial and subsequent match trial were measured. Improvement in escape latency, (location trial-match trial)/location trial, was calculated. Data shown are from day 2.\n\nHistopathological analysis\nAt 1 month post-surgery, animals were deeply anesthetized (3% isoflurane, 70% nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen) and transcardially perfused with saline (75 mL) and 4% paraformaldehyde (150 mL) in 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.4. Brains were sectioned coronally (10 \u00b5m thick) in a stereological series (150 \u00b5m apart). Tissue was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) plus Luxol fast blue. The ipsilateral and contralateral cortex and hippocampus were traced using Neurolucida 10.50.2 (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT, USA) with an Olympus BX51TRF microscope (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA, USA) between bregma levels \u22123.8 to \u22125.8 mm. Cortical contusions in the external capsule between the parietal cortex and hippocampus were traced across the entire extent of the contusion and demarcated by infiltrating inflammatory cells, vacuoles, edema, hemorrhage, and disordered white matter. Percent atrophy was calculated as the difference between contralateral and ipsilateral volume, normalized to the contralateral volume to account for differences in tissue shrinkage between animals. Images were obtained with a 20\u00d7 objective on an Olympus BX51TRF microscope (Olympus America) using Neurolucida 10.50.2 (MBF Bioscience).\n\nData analysis\nStatistical comparisons were made using GraphPad Prism 6.05 (La Jolla, CA, USA) and SigmaPlot 12.0 (San Jose, CA, USA). Significance was designated at\np\n<0.05. Results presented are mean\u00b1SEM. Physiological data were analyzed with repeated measures two-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s post-hoc analysis with factors surgery treatment x time. Cue and contextual fear conditioning data were analyzed with repeated measures two-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s post-hoc analysis with factors surgery treatment x time. Water maze data were analyzed with repeated measures two-way ANOVA (factors surgery treatment x training day) or one-way ANOVA where appropriate and Tukey\u2019s post-hoc analysis. Working memory data were analyzed with repeated measures two-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s post-hoc analysis with factors surgery treatment x trial or a one-way ANOVA where appropriate. Atrophy and contusion volume were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s post-hoc analysis."

    "Methods": "Spinal cord injuries\nAll procedures complied with Drexel University\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and National Institutes of Health guidelines for experimentation with laboratory animals. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, 225\u2013250 grams) were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane. The dorsal surface of the of thoracic level 7 (T7) was exposed by laminectomy and the spinal cord was completely transected by aspiration. A heterologous tibial nerve was harvested from a donor rat that received a tibial nerve cut one week prior to harvest. Four segments of the harvested predegenerated tibial nerve were grafted into the fresh cavity so that they spanned the lesion. The dura was sutured shut using 9-0 sutures. Then, an intrathecal catheter (ReCathCo) attached to an osmotic minipump (Alzet, model 2002) was placed subdurally so that the end of the catheter was just rostral to the distal PNG-host interface. The minipump was filled with 20U/mL ChABC (Amsbio) thermostabilized in trehalose/PBS (\nLee et al., 2010\n) and either 1mM monastrol (EMD Biosciences) or DMSO vehicle. To prevent rejection of the PNG, the recipient animals received daily subcutaneous injections of Cyclosporine A (10mg/kg, Sandimmune, Novartis Pharmaceuticals) starting 3 days before the injury and grafting for the duration of the experiment.\n\nBehavioral testing\nHindlimb function for animals treated with ChABC+DMSO (n=8) and ChABC+monastrol (n=8) was evaluated in an open field measuring 2.5 \u00d7 3 feet using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) rating scale by two individuals blinded to the treatment condition prior to injury and every other week for 13 weeks starting one week after the transection and grafting. The scores of the two groups were compared at each time point using a Mann-Whitney U test (SPSS).\n\nElectrical stimulation of the PNG\nSimilar to previously methodology (\nTom et al., 2009\n), at least 13 weeks after the transection and grafting, animals (n=5 per experimental group) were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and the T4 spinal cord was exposed by laminectomy. A multi-unit electrode (A4\u00d74 3mm 100\u2013125\u2013177, NeuroNexus) was used to stimulate spinal cord rostral to the PNG for one hour (1 mA amplitude, 100 \u03bcs pulse duration, and 50 Hz frequency). Animals were killed and perfused one hour later with 4% PFA.\n\nLabeling of regenerated axons in PNG\nTo trace axons that regenerated into the PNG, animals were deeply anesthetized. At least 13 weeks after the transection and grafting, the portion of the spinal column containing the lesion was exposed and 10% biotinylated dextran amine (BDA, Invitrogen) was injected into the PNG using a glass pipette to label regenerating axons [n=3 animals per group] (\nTom et al., 2009\n)]. Animals were perfused with 4% PFA one week later.\n\nHistology\nSegments of spinal cord containing the PNGs were dissected and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C. The tissue then was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose before sectioning on a cryostat. To visualize BDA-labeled axons in the animals injected with BDA, horizontal sections (25 \u03bcm) were cut in a series of six sets. Sections were blocked in 5% normal goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature and then incubated with anti-GFAP (Dako) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated in streptavidin-Alexa 488 or goat anti-rabbit Alexa 594 (Invitrogen) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Sections were rinsed in PBS, mounted onto glass slides, and coverslipped using FluorSave (Calbiochem).\nFor animals that were electrically stimulated, transverse sections of spinal cord within 1.5mm caudal to the distal interface was sectioned in a series of six, blocked in the same blocking solution described above, and incubated with an antibody to c-Fos (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The sections were rinsed and incubated with goat-anti rabbit Alexa 594 overnight at 4\u00b0C. Sections were rinsed in PBS, mounted onto glass slides, and coverslipped using FluorSave (Calbiochem).\nAll sections were imaged using an Olympus BX51 microscope.\n\nQuantification\nTo quantify BDA\n+\nregenerating axons that emerged from PNGs, horizontal sections (five sections per animal) containing a PNG were used for image analysis. The number of BDA+ axons located in the PNG just rostral to and just caudal to the distal interface was counted. The ratio of number of axons distal to the graft to axons caudal to the graft was calculated. The ratios of the ChABC+monastrol and ChABC+DMSO were compared statistically using a student\u2019s t test (SPSS). Significance was determined if\np\n< 0.05.\nTo quantify the number of c-Fos\n+\ncells after stimulation of the rostral cord, four transverse sections immediately caudal to the PNG from each electrophysiologically stimulated animal were imaged. A predetermined saturation threshold level (MetaMorph, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was applied to each section to eliminate background or non-specific staining. All images were subject to the same saturation threshold. Cells with c-Fos\n+\nnuclei above threshold were counted in gray matter ipsilateral and contralateral to the graft. The numbers of ipsilateral c-Fos\n+\nnuclei were statistically compared a student\u2019s t test (SPSS). Significance was determined if p< 0.05."

    "Methods": "Materials\nLeupeptin, pepstain, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), dithiothreitol (DTT), Triton X-100 (TX100), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), propidium iodide and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The following antibodies were used: anti-RhoA (Cell Signaling Tech, Danvers, MA, Cat# 2117), anti-GEF-H1 (Cell Signaling Tech, Danvers, MA, Cat# 4076), anti-beta-actin (Cell Signaling Tech, Danvers, MA, #4970), anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2, Sigma, St Louis, Cat# M9942), and anti-phospho-GEF-H1 (Ser885) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, Cat# ab94348). The anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (PA, USA).\n\nIschemia Model\nThe 2-vessel occlusion (2VO) rat transient forebrain ischemia model was produced by occlusion of two common carotid arteries while induction of hypotension as described in our previous publications (\nZhang et al., 2013\n). Male Wistar rats of about 3-month-old and approximately 300 g body weight were used in this study. All the experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee in the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Three series of sham-operated control rats and rats subjected to 20 min of ischemia followed by at 0.5, 4, 24 or 72 h of reperfusion were prepared for biochemical, histopathological, confocal microscopic, and electron microscopic (EM) studies. At least three rats in each experimental group were used in each of these series. For biochemical studies, brains were obtained by freezing them\nin situ\nwith liquid nitrogen while the animals were artificially ventilated (\nPonten et al., 1973\n). The brain subregions were dissected in a \u221212\u00b0C glove box in the coronal plane. For histopathology and confocal microscopy, rats were perfused via ascending aorta with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sectioned with a vibratome, and stored in an anti-freeze solution at \u221220\u00b0C until use. For EM, rats were perfused with ice-cold 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer.\n\nLight, confocal and electron microscopy\nFor light microscopic examination of histopathology, 50 um vibratome sections were stained with acid fuchsin and celestine blue. Brain sections at bregma \u22123.60 mm of the hippocampal level were employed to perform a quantitative analysis with the StereoInvestigator program and a custom-designed morphology and stereology software (\nTomimoto et al., 1994\n). The computer controls the stage to randomly place the counting frame on the first counting area, and then to systematically move it until the entire delineated field is sampled. Cell numbers were quantified according to the optical fractionator method (\nVereczki et al., 2006\n). Only cells on the top layer between 4 \u2013 14 \u00b5m were counted. The extent of injury will be expressed as percentage of dead neurons among the total neurons in the region examined. This experiment was conducted blindly.\nFor confocal microscopy, double-labeled fluorescence immunocytochemistry was performed on coronal brain sections (50 \u00b5m) according to the method described in our previous studies (\nHu et al., 1998\n).\nFor EM, brains after perfusion-fixation were sectioned with a vibratome at 100 \u00b5m, postfixed for 2 h in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer immediately, rinsed in distilled water, and stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate overnight. The tissue sections were then dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol to 100% followed by dry acetone and embedded in Durcupan ACM. Thin sections were counterstained with lead citrate prior to examination with a transmission electron microscope.\n\nPreparation of Subcellular Fractions\nThe neocortical tissues were dissected and chopped into small pieces in a \u221212\u00b0C glove box freezer (\nLiu et al., 2005\n). Subcellular fractions were prepared for analyzing subcellular redistribution of components of the GEF-RhoA pathway based on the method described in our previous studies (\nSabirzhanova et al., 2013\n). Briefly, the rat cortex tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 800 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 min to obtain P1 pellets and supernatants (S1). The S1 was centrifuged at 10,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 20 min to obtain P2 and S2. The S2 was further centrifuged at 165,000 g to obtain the cytosol S3 and a P3 fraction. In some experiments, the tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min to obtain a pellet fraction. This fraction was then washed with 0.5% TX100, and then centrifuged 10,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 20 min to obtain the detergent insoluble (D-I) and detergent soluble (D-S) fractions. Each subcellular fraction was assayed for total protein concentration using a detergent compatible protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).\n\nWestern Blot Analysis\nEqual protein amounts among samples were electrophoresed on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) according to method described previously (\nSabirzhanova et al., 2013\n). In addition to the loading of the same protein amounts to every lane on SDS-PAGE, \u03b2-actin levels on immunoblots were used as an internal sample loading control. All Western blot data were normalized to \u03b2-actin and expressed as the ratio between protein of interest and the \u03b2-actin protein level. Densitometry was performed with the ImageJ software in a no blinding way (version 1.48, National Institutes of Health).\n\nDephosphorylation of GEF-H1 and pull-down assay\nDephosphorylation studies were performed with protein homogenates prepared without phosphatase inhibitors according to our previous report (\nSabirzhanova et al., 2013\n). Equal protein amounts of sham cortical tissues samples (25 \u00b5g/25\u00b5l) were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in the presence or absence of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) (New England Biolabs, MA), and then were subjected to Western blot analysis with GEF-H1 antibody or phospho-GEF-H1 (Ser885).\nA pull-down assay was carried out to determine RhoA GTPase activity in the brain tissue samples after brain ischemia according to the method described previously (\nSabirzhanova et al., 2013\n). Briefly, the cortical tissues of sham-operated rats and rats subjected to ischemia followed by 0.5 h of reperfusion were homogenized in a lysis buffer, and then cleared by 10 min centrifugation at 13,000\ng\nat 4\u00b0C (\nSabirzhanova et al., 2013\n). The supernatants were incubated with Rho assay reagent (Cat# 14-382) (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The RhoA binding beads were collected by centrifugation and then washed three times with lysis buffer. The bead-binding complexes as well as homogenates aliquots were then subjected to Western blot analysis to determine the amount of the GTP-form of RhoA, as well as the total RhoA with antibody.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nData are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Four animals in each experimental group were employed for quantitative analysis of histophathology, and 3 animals in each experimental group for quantitative analysis of protein bands on Western blots. One-way ANOVAs followed by Dunnett\u2019s post-hoc tests were used for statistical analysis. *denotes\np\n<0.05 between sham and post-ischemia groups; #\np\n<0.05, 24h vs. 72h of reperfusion; \u00b6\np\n<0.05, DG area vs. CA1 or Cx region."

All materials were from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol\u00ae, then reverse transcription of equal amounts of RNA (200 ng) was performed using the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit and 1.3 mM dNTPs (with dTTP), 50 U reverse transcriptase, 10 U RNase inhibitor, and specific miRNA reverse transcriptase primers at 16\u00b0C for 30 min, 42\u00b0C for 30 min, and 85\u00b0C for 5 min. PCR reactions were then conducted using the TaqMan\u00ae MicroRNA Assay Kit at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Each reaction contained 0.75 \u03bcl of the RT reaction product, 5 \u03bcl TaqMan 2\u00d7Universal PCR Master Mix in a total volume of 10 \u03bcl using the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, South San Francisco, CA, USA). Predesigned primer/probes for miRNAs and mouse U6 were from Applied Biosystems. The expression of miR-181a was normalized using U6 as the internal control. Measurements were normalized to U6 (\u0394Ct) and comparisons calculated as the inverse log of the \u0394\u0394CT to give the relative fold change for all miRNA levels (\nLivak and Schmittgen, 2001\n). Liu et al have validated U6 as not changing in cerebral ischemia (\nLiu et al., 2010\n). The PCR experiments were repeated 3 times, each using separate sets of samples.\n\nTransient Focal Cerebral Ischemia\nAll experimental protocols using animals were performed according to protocols approved by the Stanford University Animal Care and Use Committee and in accordance with the NIH guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. Adult male CB57/B6 mice (25\u201330 g from Charles River) were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in balance O\n2\nby facemask and focal cerebral ischemia was produced by 1 hour of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with a silicone-coated 6-monofilament (Doccol Co, Redlands, CA, USA) followed by reperfusion as described before (\nOuyang et al., 2012b\n). Sham-operated mice underwent an identical procedure, without inserting the suture but tying off the ipsilateral external carotid artery. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37\u00b10.5\u00b0C controlled by a Homeothermic blanket control unit (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). Temperature and respiratory rate were monitored continuously. Mice were randomized to surgery or sham, and mice with no evidence of acute neurological deficit or with evidence of hemorrhage were excluded from analysis. A total of 220 mice were subjected to sham or MCAO surgery, 18 were excluded from analysis, 12 animals died prior to day 7, 4 had evidence of hemorrhage, and 2 had no evidence of neurological deficit acutely. After different durations of reperfusion, mice were deeply anesthetized, and brains were removed after transcardiac perfusion with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for RT-qPCR, Western blot analysis, or first with PBS and then 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for immunohistochemistry.\n\nIntracerebroventricular Infusion (ICV) and Intravenous Injection (IV) of 181a Antagomir\nTwo hours after MCAO miR-181a antagomir or control mismatch antagomir (MM) was injected intracerebroventricularly as previously (\nOuyang et al., 2012b\n). Mice were anesthetized and placed in a stereotaxic frame with a mouse head holder. The brain infusion cannula was stereotaxically placed into the left lateral ventricle (bregma: \u22120.58 mm; dorsoventral: 2.1 mm; lateral: 1.2 mm) via a burr hole (\nXiong et al., 2011\n) and affixed to the skull. Antagomir (3 pmol/gram in 2\u03bcl final volume) or MM (same amount) was mixed with the cationic lipid DOTAP (4 \u03bcl; Roche Applied Science, San Francisco, CA). After mixing for 5 seconds and incubating at 37\u00b0C for 15 min, the mixture (total 6 \u03bcl) was infused into the left lateral cerebral ventricle over 20 min. After that the bone wound was closed with bone wax. For intravenous infusion, 1 hour after MCAO miR-181a antagomir (30 pmol/gram) or control (MM) in sterile saline (100\u03bcl) was administered into the internal jugular vein. The schematic timecourse is shown in\nFigure 1A\n.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nA. Timeline of post-treatment with miR-181a antagomir in mouse stroke. miR-181a antagomir was injected 60 min (IV) or 120 min (ICV) after 60 min MCAO. After 24 or 48 hours of reperfusion brains were collected to determine infarction size, protein levels, or fixed for immunofluorescence staining. B. An example of a post-stroke cresyl violet stained brain section shows the ischemic infarction and the square indicates the approximate area within the penumbra used for cell counting and immunohistochemistry.\n\nDetermination of Infarct Volume and Neurological Status\nCerebral infarction volume was determined after 2,3,5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma, T8877, Louis, MO 63103, USA) staining of brains harvested at 48 hours reperfusion. Four sections/mouse were analyzed by a blinded observer, and corrected for edema using Adobe Photoshop CS3 as described previously (\nHan et al., 2009\n). Neurological status was assessed by neurologic deficit score at 24 hours reperfusion (\nXiong et al., 2011\n). Neurological deficit score: 0 - no observable neurological deficits, 1 - failure to extend right forepaw, 2 - circling to the right, 3 - falling to the right, 4 - cannot walk spontaneously.\n\nRotarod test\nMotor coordination and learning were assessed with the accelerating rotarod (SD Instruments, San Diego, CA). Beginning on the first day of training and continuing every other day for a total of 9 training days each mouse was placed on the 2.75cm diameter rod with rotation speed increasing from 5 to 10 rpm over 5 min. The time in which the mouse was able to stay on the rotating rod before falling was determined up to a maximum duration of 300 seconds. The test was repeated three times each day for each mouse, and the scores were averaged for each day. Any mouse not able to achieve at least a 200 seconds average on the rotarod after 9 days of training was excluded from the study. Rotarod testing was performed 3 days, and 1\u20134 weeks after surgery.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nIschemic or sham-operated mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused with cold 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) 24 or 48 hours after MCAO. The brains were kept in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 3 days then cut into 50 \u03bcm sections with a vibratome (VT1000S, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Sections were immunostained using Polyclonal Rabbit Anti-Human Myeloperoxidase (MPO dilution 1:600, Cat # A03978 Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) to detect infiltrating neutrophils, polyclonal antibody to Iba1 (Iba1, dilution1:200, Cat # 019-19741 Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA, USA) to identify activated microglia/macrophages, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) antibody (1:500 dilution, catalog #3331, ProSci, Poway, CA, USA).\nAfter staining, evaluation was done in a fixed 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm area of the penumbra. The penumbra was defined as the region of generally morphologically normal cells surrounding the core (see\nFigure 1B\n). To quantify levels of fluorescence intensity 4 brain sections for each of five animals per group were evaluated using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The number of MPO positive cells was counted in an area of 220 uM \u00d7 200 uM in the penumbra on 4 slides/mouse for 5 mice/group.\n\nImmunoblotting\nProtein samples from ipsilateral brain tissue were harvested 24 hours after MCAO. Immunoblotting was performed as previously (\nOuyang et al., 2012b\n). Equal amounts (50\u03bcg) of protein were separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, and electrotransferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked and incubated overnight with primary antibody against GRP78 (1:10, PA1-37806, Affinity BioReagents), BCL2 (1:1000, #2870, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), XIAP (1:1000, Catalog #3331, ProSci) and \u03b2-actin (1:1000, #926\u201342,210, LiCOR Bioscience), washed and incubated with secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the LICOR Odyssey infrared imaging system according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Densitometric analysis of bands was performed using ImageJ software (NIH) and the intensity was normalized to \u03b2-actin.\n\nMeasurement of NF-\u03baB (P65) Activation by ELISA\nAt 5 hours and 24 hours following MCAO or sham treatment mice were transcardially perfused with cold saline, and the ipsilateral cerebral cortices were dissected and placed in liquid nitrogen. Complete lysis buffer AM2 from the TransAM NF-\u03baB p65 Activity Assay kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA 92008, USA) was added to tissue at a 1:5 ratio and the mixture was sonicated for 5 seconds. In total 20 \u03bcl of the mixture was added to each well and measured according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All samples were run in duplicate. Data are presented as the fold change in absorbance value from sham to MCAO.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nNumbers of animals are indicated in figure legends. Data reported are means\u00b1SE. Statistical difference was determined using T-test for comparison of two groups or ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction for experiments with N>2 groups using Sigmaplot (Systat Software, San Jose, CA, USA). P<0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThis study utilized young adult (8 weeks old) male CF-1 mice (Charles River Labs, USA) weighing 28\u201332 grams at time of surgery. All animals had\nad libitum\naccess to food and water and were housed in the Division of Laboratory Animal Resources sector of the University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center, which is fully accredited by AALAC. All procedures described herein follow protocols approved by the University of Kentucky\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nMouse Model of Controlled Cortical Impact (CCI) TBI\nMice were initially anesthetized in a Plexiglas chamber using 3.0% isoflurane, shaved, weighed, and then placed into a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf, Tujunga, CA, USA). Core body temperature was maintained throughout the surgery process using an underlying heating pad. Throughout the surgical procedure, mice were kept anesthetized by a constant flow of 3.0% isoflurane and oxygen delivered via nose cone. The head was positioned in the horizontal plane with nose bar set at zero. A 2.0cm sagittal incision was made in the scalp and the skin retracted using hemostats to expose the skull. After exposing the skull, a 4.0mm diameter craniotomy was made using a dental bur (SS WHITE, Lakewood, NJ, USA) mounted on a cordless Dremel (Racine, WI, USA) lateral (left) to the sagittal suture, centered between bregma and lambda, while leaving the underlying dura mater intact. Sham-operated (control) mice received anesthesia and all surgical procedures (including craniotomy) but without the controlled cortical impact brain injury. Brain-injured mice received CCI utilizing an electronically controlled pneumatic impacting device (Precision Systems Instrumentation, TBI-0310 Impactor, Fairfax Station, VA, USA) with a 3.0mm diameter, beveled (flat) impactor tip. The impact velocity was held at 3.50 meters per second while the depth of cortical deformation was set at 1.0mm (severe) as described previously.\n(\n35\n)\nMortality following this severe CCI brain injury is rare (<5.0%). After injury, the craniotomy was closed by secure placement of a 6.0mm diameter disk of dental acrylic cemented in place with quick bonding liquid cyanoacrylate. The mice were then placed in a Hova-Bator Incubator (model 1583; Randall Burkey Co, Boerne, TX, USA) set at 37\u00b0C for at least 30 minutes to prevent post-traumatic hypothermia before returning them to their home cage. Consciousness (i.e. return of right reflex and mobility) was regained within 15 minutes after the surgery. Brain-injured and sham mice typically show no untoward effects after recovering from anesthesia, and resume normal eating, drinking and grooming patterns thereafter. In this study, animals survived from 24 hours (mitochondria assays) to 48 hours (dose response assessments) post-injury depending upon randomized group assignment. Additional details on surgical procedures have been previously published by our laboratory.\n(\n35\n)\n\nDrug Treatments\nThe pharmacological compound used in this study is CA, which has previously been shown to be a potent activator of the Nrf2-ARE pathway.\n(\n32\n)\nCarnosic Acid (Sigma, USA) was administered I.P. at 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg in a 10% Ethanol/ 90% PBS vehicle solution. The volumes administered of the compound solution I.P. did not exceed 0.3 ml. Carnosic acid or its vehicle, were administered at 15 minutes post-injury. The doses of CA were chosen based upon previous studies with this compound in a rat acute focal stroke model\n(\n32\n)\nand our own previously published work in mice.\n(\n34\n)\n\nChemicals\nSodium pyruvate, malate, rotenone, and carbonyl cyanide\np\n-rifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Oligomycin was obtained from Biomol, USA. 4-hydroxy 2-nonenal (4-HNE) was purchased from EMD Chemicals Inc. (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Chemicals were stored at -20\u00b0C as stock solutions. Working solutions for each bioenergetics experiment were always prepared fresh by creating appropriate dilutions in respiration buffer. All materials and reagents for the XF-24 assays were obtained from Seahorse Biosciences (North Billerica, MA, USA).\n\nIsolation of Ficoll-Purified Mitochondria\nCortical brain mitochondria were extracted as previously described.\n(\n2\n)\nBriefly, mice were decapitated and the brain rapidly removed. Cortical regions were dissected out in an ice-cold Petri dish containing isolation buffer (1mM EGTA, 215mM mannitol, 75mM sucrose, 0.1% BSA, and 20mM HEPES adjusted to a pH of 7.2 with KOH). Brain tissue was homogenized using Potter-Elvehjem homogenizers containing ice-cold isolation buffer. The tissue homogenates were centrifuged twice at 1300g for 3 minutes in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris and nuclei, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 13,000g for 10 minutes. The resulting crude mitochondrial pellet was subjected to nitrogen decompression to release synaptic mitochondria, using a nitrogen cell disruption bomb, at 4\u00b0C under a pressure of 1200 psi for 10 minutes. After nitrogen disruption, the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer and layered on top of a discontinuous Ficoll gradient (7.5% and 10%), and centrifuged at 100,000g for 30 minutes. The mitochondrial pellets at the bottom were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, topped off with isolation buffer without EGTA, and centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C to yield a tighter pellet. The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 20-50 microliters of isolation buffer without EGTA to yield a concentration of approximately 10 mg/ml. The final protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit measuring absorbance at 562nm using a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader (Winooski, VT). These samples were then analyzed for mitochondrial bioenergetics on the Seahorse XF-24 extracellular flux analyzer instrument (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA, USA).\n\nPreparation and Calibration of Seahorse XF-24 Sensor Cartridge Sample Plate\nA Seahorse Bioscience XF24 extracellular flux analyzer was used to measure mitochondrial bioenergetics in intact isolated mitochondria as previously described.\n(\n34\n)\nThe XF-24 creates a transient, 7\u03bcl chamber in specialized microplates that allows for the determination of oxygen and proton concentrations in real time. The day before the experiment, 1.0 ml of XF Calibrant solution (Seahorse Bioscience) was added to each well of a 24 well dual-analyte sensor cartridge (Seahorse Bioscience). The sensor cartridge was placed back on the 24 well calibration plate and put in a 37\u00b0C incubator without CO\n2\n(Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA, USA) overnight. The day of the experiment, the injection ports on the sensor cartridge were pre-loaded with the appropriate mitochondrial substrates or inhibitors at 10\u00d7 concentrations. Once the sensor cartridge was loaded with all of the experimental reagents it was placed into the Seahorse XF-24 extracellular flux analyzer for automated calibration. During the sensor calibration, isolated mitochondria were then seeded in 50\u03bcl volume of isolation buffer containing 5.0 \u03bcg \u03bcg of protein (determined by BCA method) per well in XF-24 V7 cell culture microplates. Following the centrifugation of the plates at 2000 rpm for 4 minutes at 4\u00b0C, 450\u03bcl of respiration buffer (215mM mannitol, 75mM sucrose, 0.1% BSA, 20mM HEPES, 2mM MgCl, 2.5mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\nat pH 7.2) at 37\u00b0C was gently added to each well for a final volume of 500\u03bcl per well at the beginning of the experiment. Plates were immediately placed into the calibrated Seahorse XF-24 extracellular flux analyzer for mitochondrial bioenergetics analysis.\n\nSeahorse XF-24 Assay Protocol for Isolated Mitochondrial Bioenergetics\nThe following protocol was utilized for the analysis of bioenergetic function in purified mitochondria using the Seahorse Biosciences XF-24 extracellular flux analyzer as previously described.\n(\n34\n)\nBriefly, pyruvate plus malate plus ADP, oligomycin, FCCP, and rotenone plus succinate were injected sequentially through ports A, B, C, and D, respectively, in the Seahorse Flux Pak cartridges to yield final concentrations of 5.0 mM (pyruvate), 2.5 mM (malate), 1.0 mM (ADP), 1.0 \u03bcg/ml (oligomycin), 4.0 \u03bcM (FCCP) and 10.0 mM (succinate) plus 100.0 nM (rotenone), respectively.\n\nWestern Blot Analysis of Oxidative Damage and Cytoskeletal Breakdown Markers\nA Western blotting technique was employed as previously described\n(\n34\n,\n35\n)\n\u2013 with some modifications \u2013 to detect 4-HNE adducts in tissue homogenates and mitochondrial pellets. Briefly, at a given time point post-injury, mice received an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (200.0mg/kg IP). The ipsilateral cortex (penumbra tissue and the injured core) and hippocampus were then rapidly dissected out on an ice-chilled stage and immediately transferred to Triton lysis buffer (1.0% Triton, 20.0mM Tris HCL, 150.0mM NaCl, 5.0mM EGTA, 10.0mM EDTA, and 10.0% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors (Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Samples were then sonicated and centrifuged for 30 minutes (13,000rpm at 4\u00b0C). The supernatants were collected and the remaining pellet was discarded. In the case of mitochondria pellets, after isolation of the mitochondria the samples were spun down and frozen at -80\u00b0C until further analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein Assay (Pierce; Rockford, IL, USA). An aliquot of each protein sample (15.0\u03bcg for 4-HNE and 3-NT; 5.0\u03bcg for spectrin) was separated on an SDS\u2013PAGE precast gel (12% Bis-Tris for oxidative damage markers, 3-8% Tris-Acetate for spectrin; w/v acrylamide; Criterion XT, Bio-Rad) using a XT-MES (4-HNE and 3-NT) or XT-Tricine (spectrin) running buffer system and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry electro-transferring unit at 15 volts for 30 minutes at room temperature. Preliminary experiments established protein concentration curves in order to ensure that quantified bands were in the linear range. Membranes were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in 5% milk/TBS blocking solution. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in blocking solution with 0.5 mM Tween-20 (TBST) containing the appropriate dilution of primary antibody. A mouse monoclonal primary antibody was used for detecting 4-HNE bands (1:100, Japan Institute for Control of Aging, JaICA MHN-100P, Shizouka, Japan). A mouse monoclonal primary antibody was used for detecting 3-NT bands (1:500, Genway #20-321-175259, San Diego, California, USA). A mouse monoclonal primary antibody was also used for detecting alpha spectrin breakdown products (SBDPs), with the 150 kD band representing calpain and caspase-3 generated SBDPs and the 145 kD band being a calpain specific SBDP (1:5000, Affiniti FG6090; Affiniti Biomol, Mamhead Castle, UK). A goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (2 hour incubation at room temperature) conjugated to an infrared dye (1:5000, IRdye800CW, Rockland) was used for detection of the primary labeled bands. Wet membranes were imaged and quantified using Odyssey Infra Red Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). For oxidative damage markers, all bands ranging from 250 kD to 50 kD were quantified for each lane, representing the smear of 4-HNE or 3-NT labeled proteins for each sample. For spectrin, both the 150 kD and 145 kD bands were quantified for each lane, representing spectrin breakdown products for each sample. This was then analyzed as percent of control samples (sham).\n\nSample Size and Statistical Analysis\nThe sample sizes for this study were 8-10 per group (dose response analysis) and 9-10 per group (mitochondrial bioenergetics analysis) and 8-10 per group (therapeutic window analysis). Data are presented as group means +/- standard deviation (SD) and were analyzed using GraphPad PRISM version 5.0 (San Diego, CA, USA). Both mitochondrial bioenergetics and immunoblot quantification data were analyzed by appropriately designed ANOVAs followed by Student Newman-Keuls (SNK) post-hoc tests as appropriate. A\np\nvalue of <0.05 was considered significant for all analyses."

Ten-week-old, female, sexually mature, ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, Massachusetts, USA). The animals were housed on a 12-hour light-dark cycle and given water and food\nad libitum\n. Animals were supplied a diet of soy and alfalfa free pellets (Teklad 2020x, Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, USA) to minimize the presence of dietary phytoestrogens. Rats were divided into groups based on application of inflammatory soup (IS, 1.0 mM bradykinin acetate, 1.0 mM histamine dihydrochloride, 1.0 mM serotonin hydrochloride, and 0.1 mM prostaglandin E2 in sterile PBS, pH 5.5, (\nBurstein, et al., 1998\n)) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS, adjusted to a pH of 7.4) and exposure to estradiol or vehicle corn oil. Animal numbers per group: IS control: 10 rats, IS+Estradiol: 7 rats, PBS control: 7 rats, PBS+Estradiol: 4 rats (data not shown). All behavioral experiments were conducted between 8:30 and 14:00 h in a dedicated, temperature-controlled room.\n\nCannula Implantation\nA Plastics One (Roanoke, VA, USA) cannula made of biocompatible material was used for dural delivery of IS or PBS. The cannula was implanted through the skull under isoflurane anesthesia as previously described in detail. (\nStucky, et al., 2011\n). Briefly, the cannula was placed on the right side of the skull over the occipital lobe 5 mm lateral to midline and halfway between bregma and lambda. One stainless steel screw was placed in rostral and caudal positions 3 mm from the center of the cannula as anchors for the dental cement (Ortho-Jet, Lang Dental Mfg. Co., Inc., Wheeling IL, USA) used to stabilize the cannula.\n\nTreatment\nEstradiol was dissolved in 100% ethanol. An aliquot was then diluted 1000-fold (ethanol final concentration 0.1%) in corn oil to a final concentration of 10 \u00b5g/ml. Rats were dosed subcutaneously at 2 \u00b5g/kg/day 30 min prior to migraine induction in order to achieve proestrus levels of estradiol in their system during behavioral analysis. This dose was based on both on previous literature values demonstrating levels of circulating estradiol during this stage to be 80\u2013140 pg/mL during proestrus (\nButcher, et al., 1974\n,\nHe, et al., 2002\n,\nNequin, et al., 1979\n,\nSmith, et al., 1975\n) and ELISA measurements performed for this study showing circulating levels of estradiol of 112.1 \u00b1 14.1 pg/mL. Rats were divided into groups which received either estradiol or a vehicle (corn) oil injection. Animals received IS or PBS through the cannula implant. During IS or PBS application, the obturator cap was removed and an internal delivery cannula was placed as previously described (\nStucky, et al., 2011\n,\nVermeer, 2014\n). All animals were weighed before behavioral testing throughout the study. No significant differences were found in weight gain between rats treated with estradiol and vehicle treated rats.\n\nTimeline\nThe same timeline was followed as previously described (\nVermeer, 2014\n). Briefly, rats were given one week to acclimate following arrival and then were subjected to two days of presurgical baseline testing. Animals then underwent the cannula implantation surgery and were given a further week to recover. Finally, rats were given two days of postsurgical baseline testing prior to dural IS application. As previously described, behavioral experiments using IS applications and estradiol exposure were performed every third day for seven total applications. Rats were injected with estradiol 30 min prior to IS application and behavioral testing was completed 30 min following dural stimulation by the IS (\nOshinsky and Gomonchareonsiri, 2007\n). Following recommendations of the Panel on Euthanasia, American Veterinary Medical Association, rats were dosed with 60 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium (Beuthanasia D, Schering-Plough, Summit, NJ, USA) and decapitated approximately 1 hr after the final behavioral experiment. The skull, brain, and cervical spinal cord were immersed in RNALater (Ambion, Foster City, CA, USA) and stored for up to 3 days at 4\u00b0C. The ipsilateral trigeminal nucleus, trigeminal ganglion, and dura mater were later dissected as previously described (\nStucky, et al., 2011\n).\n\nMultibehavioral Model of Migraine\nAs previously described, a multibehavioral model of migraine in rat was utilized to study behavioral changes associated with migraine following dural stimulation. This model was based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II and III) (\nSociety, 2004\n,\nSociety, 2013\n) as previously described (\nVermeer, 2014\n). Very briefly, following exposure to estradiol, rats were tested for total locomotor activity, photo- and phonophobia, evoked facial grooming, and acoustic startle reflex.\nLocomotor activity was studied utilizing a Force Plate Actimeter (BASi, San Diego, CA, USA), which transmitted data of rat movement during three phases; 0\u20135 min is the application of IS (\u201cdelivery phase\u201d), 6\u201310 min (\u201conset phase\u201d), and 11\u201315 min (\u201cpersistence phase\u201d). The total distance traveled and the bouts of low mobility (BLM, a measure of periodic inactivity) were measured.\nThe Photo- and Phonophobia task was performed in a modified Force Plate Actimeter to study place preference and used externally control speakers (75 dB white noise) and light (250 lux illumination) to examine light and noise sensitivity. The percent of time animals spent in the stimulus chambers while the stimulus was activated and BLM were assessed.\nRats were then examined for facial allodynia with the evoked facial grooming task, which included 3 sprays of water from a metered bottled to the face of the rat. Video recordings of the rats were subsequently analyzed for latency to first groom and percent time spent grooming during the 5 min following stimulus application. Only grooming to their face and heads was quantified, with cleaning swipes defined as the use of one or both forepaws cleaning at or above the eyes.\nFinally, rats were placed in Startle Reflex Chambers (Kinder Scientific, Poway, CA, USA). Fourteen randomly mixed pulses of white noise (85 or 90 dB) were emitted at one pulse/min and the maximum startle force (N) was recorded in the first 80 msec after the noise. The average response of 7 trials was calculated.\n\nGene Expression Analysis\nTissues utilized for these studies were the ipsilateral trigeminal nucleus, trigeminal ganglion, and dura mater. Total RNAs from each sample were extracted, purified, and quantified with a Nanodrop as previously described (\nStucky, et al., 2011\n) and GAPDH expression was measured as the internal control. Gene-specific primers for ERalpha, GPR30, ERK1, ERK2, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), sodium gated channel 1.8 (Na\nv\n1.8), fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and GAPDH were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA, USA) and qPCR occurred in a 96-well MicroAmp Optical reaction plate.\n\npERK Analysis\nTrigeminal nucleus and ganglion, and dura mater tissue samples were isolated as previously described (\nLiverman, et al., 2009\n). Western blot analysis was performed for phosphorylated ERK (the activated form) using a 10% resolving SDS-PAGE gel and 5 micrograms of protein were loaded for each sample as previously described (\nVermeer, 2014\n). Briefly, nitrocellulose membrane was used for transfer and the Odyssey blocking buffer system was applied for 2 hr at room temperature. Antibody dilutions were as follows: primary anti-pERK (1:10000) overnight at 4\u00b0C, secondary goat-anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor 680 (1:10000) for 1.5 hr at room temperature. The Odyssey Infrared Fluorescence Imaging System was used to detect and Image J was used to analyze band density. All data were normalized to the internal control \u03b2-actin to determine total activated ERK.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nBehavioral data were analyzed with a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA and a Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc comparison and confidence intervals using SPSS Statistics 20 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). Treatment (estradiol vs. vehicle) was used as the between subjects factor. Data from gene expression and western blot analysis were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s posttest. For behavioral data, significant differences between estradiol treatment and vehicle (corn oil) treatment are indicated by an asterisk (*). Differences were considered significant if\np\n\u2264 0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals and Surgery\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Auburn University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Bilateral injection of the thalamus and DCN were performed according to a previously published protocol [\n16\n]. ICV injection was performed under ultrasound guidance to confirm the correct placement of the injection needle. After visualization of the left lateral ventricle with an 8-5 MHz Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound probe (Philips Healthcare, Andover, MA), a single entry site was made through the skull with a 20G spinal needle. Vector was then delivered using a Hamilton syringe (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) fitted with a 25G non-coring needle (Harvard Apparatus). A total of 200uL was delivered in 10-15 uL aliquots at a rate of 3-5 uL/second with approximately 1 minute between aliquots. Cats were treated at 4-7 weeks of age, prior to symptom onset.\nAt humane or a predetermined endpoint animals were euthanized by pentobarbital overdose (100 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with cold, heparinized saline. The brain was divided into coronal blocks of approximately 0.6 cm from the frontal pole through the cerebellum. The right hemisphere of the brain was preserved in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium for determination of enzyme activity. The left hemisphere of the brain and all other tissues were formalin fixed or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and preserved at -80 \u00b0C.\n\nAAV Vectors\nThe feline HEXA/B cDNAs were cloned into an AAV backbone as previously described [\n16\n]. Feline HEX transgene expression was driven by the hybrid CBA promoter including the CMV immediate-early enhancer fused to the chicken \u03b2-actin promoter [\n24\n]. The woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) was included for enhancement of gene expression. AAVrh8 vector stocks encoding feline Hex subunits were produced as previously described [\n25\n].\n\nBlood and cerebrospinal fluid analysis\nBlood was collected from the jugular vein at predetermined time points after tranquilization with dexmedetomidine (0.4mg/kg IM). Blood for complete blood count was put into EDTA tubes and analyzed using ADVIA 120 Hematology System (Seimens Medical Solutions, Malvern PA). Blood for serology was placed in heparinized tubes and analyzed using a Cobas C311 chemistry analyzer (Roche Hitachi, Basel, Switzerland, Tokyo, Japan). For quantification of echinocytes, Diff-Quick stained blood smears were scanned on an Aperio ScanScope CS2 (Vista, CA) and 3 40\u00d7 magnification fields were counted.\nCSF collection was performed while under general anesthesia. Cats were anesthetized using dexmedetomidine (0.4mcg/kg IM) and ketamine (10mg/kg IM), underwent tracheal intubation and anesthesia was maintained using isoflurane (0.5-2%). CSF was collected from the cerebellomedullary cistern as previously described [\n26\n]. CSF samples were collected and aliquots were analyzed for cytology and total protein. Samples were then immediately centrifuged at 100\u00d7 g for 5 minutes to remove any blood contamination. Samples then underwent one freeze thaw cycle at -80\u00b0C and were analyzed using Cobas C311 chemistry analyzer (Roche Hitachi, Basel, Switzerland & Tokyo, Japan).\n\nLysoTracker\u00ae staining and quantification of PBMCs\nPBMCs were isolated from whole blood with Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) according the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated PBMCs were incubated with 200 nM of LysoTracker\u00ae Green (Molecular Probes, Grand Island, NY) for 20 minutes in the dark, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 200 \u00d7 g in an IEC HN-SII centrifuge (Damon/IEC, Needham Heights, MA), and resuspended in 250 uL of MACS buffer. Samples were analyzed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, California) and data collected using CFlow software. Further sorting of select samples was conducted using MoFlow XDP cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) and differential cell counts were performed on prepared cytospins.\n\nEnzyme Assay\nThe activity of lysosomal enzymes was determined using a previously published protocol [\n11\n]. The fluourescence of 4-methylumbelliferyl (4-MU) substrates (\u03b2-gal, 0.5 mmol/l 4-MU-\u03b2-D-galactoside, pH 3.8; HexA, 1 mmol/l 4-methylumbelliferyl 6-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (MUGS), pH 4.2; total Hex, 1 mmol/l 4-MU-N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosaminide (MUG), pH 4.3; and \u03b1-mannosidase, 2 mM 4-MU-\u03b1-D-manopyranoside, pH 4.2) was measured at an excitation/emission of 360 nm/450 nm on a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). Specific activity was expressed as nmol 4-MU cleaved/mg protein/hour.\n\n1.5T MRI Quantification\nMRIs were performed in SD cats at humane endpoint and in AAV-treated cats at 16 weeks post treatment. Cats were anesthetized with dexmedetomidine (0.4mcg/kg) and ketamine (10mg/kg), and maintained on 0.5-2% isoflurane after tracheal intubation. All MRI scans were performed on an Infinion 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner (Phillips Healthcare, Andover, MA) using a lower extremity quadrature coil (Phillips Healthcare, Andover, MA). Scan parameters were as follows: 2D transverse T2 weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) images with 5mm\n3\nresolution, TR/TE of 4072/141.7 ms, echo train length of 16, BW of 20.8 KHz/pix, and 3 averages.\nMRI based cortical and cerebellar changes were quantified using pixel intensity measurement. Pixel intensities were measured in quadruplicate at the individual area of interest. The average pixel values were then normalized to the intensity of CSF, also measured in quadruplicate, on that particular slice. All measurements were performed using the probe tool included in EFilm 3.2 software (Merge Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA).\n\nBAER\nBAER assessments were performed in SD cats at 8-12 weeks and at humane endpoint (approximately 16-23 weeks). Cats were sedated with 0.4mcg/kg dexmedetomidine and BAER was performed using a Nicolet VikingQuest electrodiagnostic instrument (CareFusion, San Diego, CA). BAER was performed using earplug and hollow tubing auditory transmission apparatus, a click stimulus of 11.4 Hz at 75dB, contralateral noise at 40dB. Electrode placement was as previously described [\n27\n] and is as follows: mastoid reference (negative electrode), vertex reference (positive electrode) and ground placed on midline at the level of the occipital condyles. Response to click stimulus was acquired over 1.5 ms sweep with an amplitude of 0.2\u03bcV and 1000 averages. Measurements were repeated 3 times per side per time point. Peak identification was performed as previously described [\n28\n,\n29\n].\n\nERG\nERGs were performed at 12 weeks and humane endpoint in SD cats. Ophthalmologic examination was performed and eyes were dilated using 1-2 drops tropicamide (1% solution). Cats were then sedated using dexmedetomidine (0.4mcg/kg) intramuscularly. Cats were dark adapted for 15 minutes prior to the procedure. Scotopic ERGs were recorded using a BPM-100 instrument (Retiongraphics, Norwalk, CT) with an active corneal contact lens electrode (Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY). The reference and ground electrodes were placed subcutaneously at the lateral canthus and skull vertex. This procedure was performed twice per eye per time point."

    "Methods": "Animal Experiments\nAll animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, which is in compliance with the 8th Edition of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Guide), NRC 2011 and the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes, Council of Europe (ETS 123). Timed pregnant New Zealand rabbits were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, Mass., USA). The premature pups were delivered by C-section at d 29 of gestational age (term= 32 d). Pups of either sex were dried with pre-warmed towels and placed in infant incubator at 35\u00b0C. The pups were gavage-fed with puppy formula (Esbilac, Petag, IL) in a volume of 2 ml every 12 h (100ml/kg/d) starting at 2 h age. Subsequently, feeds were advanced to 120, 150, 180, 220, 250, and 280 ml/kg at 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21 d respectively. The pups were euthanized at 3, 7, 14, and 21 d. We processed the brain tissues as described before (\nBallabh et al., 2007\n). Briefly, forebrains were sectioned into 2 mm slices starting from the rostral end. Brain slices at the level of mid-septal nucleus were used for immuno-histochemistry, Western blot analyses, microarray analyses, and real-time qPCR. For immunohistochemistry, the samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) overnight and were then cryoprotected by immersing into a 20% sucrose solution in PBS. The tissues were frozen after embedding them into optimum cutting temperature compound (Sakura, Japan). Frozen coronal blocks were cut in 30 \u03bcm sections. For Western blot analyses and qPCR, brain slices were frozen immediately on dry ice.\n\nGlucocorticoid treatment\nDexamethasone (West-Ward, Eatontown, NJ) was administered in two doses\u2014high (0.25 mg/kg twice daily) and low (0.1 mg/kg twice daily)\u2014for a maximum duration of 5 d or until euthanized. Similarly, betamethasone (Schering, Kenilworth, NJ) was used either in high (0.5 mg/kg once daily for 5 d) or low (0.2 mg/kg once daily for 5 d) doses. Betamethasone and dexamethasone used had aqueous base and they were diluted in saline. Hence, saline treatment was used as in control animals. The dose of GCs was based on its use in premature infants at risk of chronic lung disease in neonatal intensive care units (\nBarrington, 2001\n;\nDurand et al., 2002\n;\nMcEvoy et al., 2004\n;\nWalther et al., 2003\n). To block GC receptors, we used mifepristone (RU486, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in a dose of 200 mg/kg once daily for five days. This dose was based on the fact that 1 mg of dexamethasone antagonizes 400 mg of mifepristone (\nDeBattista and Belanoff, 2006\n). Mifepristone was given in the morning at the same time as dexamethasone while dexamethasone was given alone in the evening. Mifepristone was dissolved in DMSO and accordingly, vehicle consisted of DMSO. All medications were administered intramuscularly (IM).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nThe primary antibodies used in the experiments included rabbit monoclonal Ki67 (Catalog # 275R-14, Cell Marque, Rocklin, CA), goat polyclonal Olig2 (Catalog # AF-2418, R & D, Minneapolis, MN), mouse monoclonal glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, catalog #G6171, St Louis, MO), rat monoclonal myelin basic protein (Catalog # AB7439, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), mouse monoclonal myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG, Catalog # ab89780, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), mouse monoclonal APC antibody (Catalog # OP80, EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ), mouse monoclonal 2\u2032,3\u2032-Cyclic-nucleotide 3\u2032-phosphodiesterase (CNPase, Catalog # SMI91R, Covance, Dedham, MA), goat polyclonal Iba 1 antibody (catalog #ab5076, Abcam Cambridge, MA), mouse monoclonal Ki67 (catalog #M7240; Dako, CA), and O4 antibody (generous gift from Dr. Rashmi Bansal). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa 488 donkey anti-mouse, Alexa 647 donkey anti-goat, and Alexa 594 donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Briefly, sections were hydrated in 0.01M PBS, blocked in 5% normal donkey serum, and then incubated with the primary antibodies diluted in PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight. After washing in PBS, the sections were incubated with secondary antibody diluted in 1% normal donkey serum in PBS at room temperature for 60 minutes. Finally, after washing the sections in PBS, we mounted them with Slow Fade Light Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, CA). The stained sections were visualized under a confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments, Japan). Stereology was performed using a fluorescent microscope (Axioskop 2 plus, Carl Zeiss Inc) with motorized specimen stage for automated sampling (ASI, Eugene, OR), CCD color video camera (Microfire, Optronics, Goleta, CA), and stereology software (Stereologer, SRC, Baltimore, MD).\n\nStereological analysis of myelin and glia\nAll stereological analyses were performed at our stereology workstation which is equipped with a Zeiss Axioscope-2 microscope, motorized stage, an Optronics Microfire digital camera and computerized software system (Stereologer, SRC, MD). We quantified myelination (myelin load) and gliosis (GFAP\n+\nastrocytes cell bodies and fibers) in the corpus callosum and corona radiata of the brain section taken at the level of mid-septal nucleus. Briefly, coronal sections were cut on cryostat at a setting of 30 \u03bcm thickness with a section sampling interval of three (90 \u03bcm) to achieve at least 6 sections at the level of mid-septal nucleus. The sections were triple-labeled with GFAP and MBP antibodies along with DAPI (nuclear stain). The reference spaces (corona radiata, corpus callosum) were first outlined on the section under 5\u00d7 objective. The volume of the outlined area (reference space) was quantified using a point counting probe (frame 25 \u03bcm \u00d7 25 \u03bcm; guard zone 2 \u03bcm, inter-frame interval = 300 \u03bcm). The total volume fraction (load) of myelin labeled by antibodies to MBP through a defined reference space was quantified using the object area fraction probe under 60\u00d7 oil lens. For the area fraction probe (frame 25 \u03bcm \u00d7 25 \u03bcm; guard zone 2 \u03bcm, interframe interval 400 \u03bcm), the user clicked on the grid points that touched myelin fibers in sections stained with MBP. The area fraction of myelination was quantified as the ratio of product of the area per point and number of points hitting reference area [a(point)\u00b7 \u03a3P\nref\n] over the product of the area per point and number of points hitting the sampled area [a(point)\u00b7 \u03a3P\nsamp\n], as reported (\nBuser et al., 2012\n;\nMouton et al., 2009\n). Sampling continued until the coefficient of error (CE) was less than 0.10. To assess gliosis, we determined total volume fraction of astrocyte cell bodies and fibers (\nMouton et al., 2009\n). Volume fraction of astrocytes was quantified in a similar fashion as for myelin.\n\nWestern blot analyses\nWe homogenized the frozen brain tissue, collected as 2 mm slice at the level of mid-septal nucleus, in sample buffer (3% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 62.5 mMol Tris-HCl) using a mechanical homogenizer and boiled the samples immediately for 5 minutes. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce catalog # 23227, Thermo Scientifics, IL). Total protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE according to the previously described method (\nBallabh et al., 2007\n). Equal amounts of protein (10-20 \u03bcg) were loaded into a 4-20% gradient precast gel (Bio-Rad, CA). The separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane by electro-transfer. The membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies. We detected target proteins with chemiluminescence ECL system (Amersham Biosciences Inc., NJ) by using secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch, PA). We next stripped the blots with stripping buffer (Pierce) and incubated with \u03b2 actin primary antibody followed by secondary antibody and detection with chemiluminescence ECL system. As described previously (\nBallabh et al., 2007\n), the blots from each experiment were densitometrically analyzed using ImageJ. We used pre-calibrated optical density step tablet to calibrate on image J (\nrsbweb.nih.gov/ij/\n) and then measured the optical density of the bands. The optical density values were normalized by taking the ratio of the target protein and \u03b2 actin. A couple of times, same blot was used to probe for two markers, such as CNPase and MAG, and this followed actin detection.\n\nQuantification of proliferation and maturation of oligodendrocytes\nThree groups comprising high-dose betamethasone, dexamethasone, and vehicle were evaluated for a) OL proliferation (Olig2\n+\nKi67\n+\n) and b) OL maturation\u2014Olig2\n+\n, O4\n+\n, and O4\n+\nAPC\n+\ncount. Brain section were double labeled with Olig2 and Ki67 antibodies at 3 d and 7 d and double stained with O4 and APC antibodies at 7 d (Dummula et al.). Five 20 \u03bcm thick coronal sections from each brain were used for immunolabeling. Counting was performed under the confocal microscope using 60\u00d7 lens (Nikon Instruments, Japan) by a blinded investigator in an unbiased fashion and random basis. Cells were counted in the periventricular corpus callosum, and corona radiata. We countedv objects in ~30 images (6 images \u00d7 5 coronal sections) per brain region for each pup (n = 5-6 pups each group) for every parameter. The density of Iba1\n+\nmicroglia in the coronal radiata and corpus callosum (white matter) was assessed in high dose dexamethasone treated pups vs. controls, in a similar manner as OL progenitors.\n\nFluorescent in situ detection of DNA fragmentation (TUNEL)\nWe performed TUNEL staining on fixed brain sections as described previously (Dummula et al.) on three groups of preterm rabbit pups, including high-dose betamethasone, dexamethasone, and vehicle at d 3. We counted Olig2\n+\nOL co-labeled with TUNEL\n+\nnuclei. Briefly, tissue sections were air dried on slides, hydrated in 0.01 M PBS, and permeabilized for 5 min in 1:1 ethanol: acetic acid. An ApopTag-fluorescein\nin situ\nDNA fragmentation detection kit (catalog # S7110; Millipore) was used to visualize TUNEL-labeled nuclei. TUNEL\n+\nOlig2\n+\ncells were counted in the periventricular corona radiata and corpus callosum in a similar manner as OL, which is discussed in the previous paragraph.\n\nMicroarray\n\u201cTwo-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis\u201d protocol (\nwww.agilent.com\n) was employed as previously described (\nIacobas et al., 2008\n). The samples (n = 4 each, 2 mm coronal slice at mid-septal nucleus level at d 3) were hybridized to an Agilent rabbit gene expression microarray (Catalog # G2519F-020908, one glass slide formatted with four high-definition 44K arrays) at 65\u00b0C for 17 h. The hybridized chip was washed at room temperature with gene expression wash pack, stabilization solution, and drying solution. We next scanned the chip using an Agilent G2565A dual laser scanner at 5 \u03bcm resolution. The tiff images, obtained by Scan Control 8.3 (Agilent), were analyzed with (Agilent) Feature Extraction 10.7.3.1. All spots affected by local corruption or with the median foreground fluorescence less than twice the median background fluorescence were removed from the analysis (\nIacobas et al., 2008\n),\n\nTranscriptome analysis\nWe employed \u201cBetter Bunny\u201d software for augmented gene annotation, orthologue identification, and integrated functional analysis (\nhttp://cptweb.cpt.wayne.edu/BB/index.php\n) (\nCraig et al., 2012\n) We completed annotations of 12,118 unigenes probed from 43,603 array spots and to identify the human putative orthologs. The software was also used to quantify genes into various functional categories including cell location, molecular function, and biological process. Detection of significantly regulated genes relied on both absolute (> 1.5\u00d7) fold-change and statistical significance (P < 0.05, heteroscedastic t-test with Bonferroni correction) between means (\nIacobas et al., 2008\n).\n\nQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction\nQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed as before (\nBallabh et al., 2007\n). Briefly, total RNA were isolated form 1 mm thick slice taken at the level of mid-septal nucleus of the forebrain using Mini RNA isolation kit (Roche, NJ). RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II RT (Invitrogen, CA). Real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR was used to analyze mRNA expression using the Applied Biosystems 9700 (USA). Quantification was performed using the efficiency-corrected \u0394\u0394CT method. The primers used for qRT-PCR are in\nTable 1\n.\nTable 1.\nPrimers used in the study\nGene\nAccession\nnumber\nForward primer\nReverse primer\nOlig1\nXM_002716810.1\n5\u2032-CAGCAGCAGCAACTAAGG-3\u2032\n5\u2032-GAGTAGGGCAGGATGACC-3\u2032\nOlig2\nNM_005806\n5\u2032-GTGCGGATGCTTATTATAG-3\u2032\n5\u2032-ATCTGGATGCGATTTGAG-3\u2032\nID4\nNM_001546\n5\u2032-GCATAATGGCAAATCCTTCAAG-3\u2032\n5 \u2032-CACAAGAGATGGGACAGTAG C-3\u2032\nSox10\nXM_002723532\n5\u2032-AAGCCTTTCTGTCTGGCTCACT-3\u2032\nTCAGGTCCTGGATAGAGGGTCATT\nMBP\nXM_002723002.1\n5\u2032-GCAACCTGTACAAGGACCA-3\u2032\n5\u2032-GAAGAAGTGGACTACAGGGTTT-3\nGFAP\nNG_008401\n5\u2032-ACTCAATGCTGGCTTCAAGGAGAC-3\u2032\n5\u2032-ATGTAGCTGGCAAAGCGGTCATTG-3\u2032\nGAPDH\nNM_001082253.1\n5\u2032-CAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGCAGGCA-3\u2032\n5\u2032-CTTCACAAAGTGGTCATTGAGGG-3\u2032\nOpen in a new tab\n\nNeurobehavioral assessment\nNeurobehavioral assessment was performed by two blinded physicians using previously described scoring system at d 14 and d 21 (\nDummula et al., 2011\n). Cranial nerves were tested by smell (aversive response to ethanol), sucking, and swallowing (formula delivered by a plastic pipette). The response were scored on a scale of 0\u20133, 0 being the no response, and 3 normal response. We assessed motor activity by tone (flexion and extensions of extremities), righting reflex (ability and quick turning from supine to prone position), locomotion at 30\u00b0 angle, and gait. Grading of tone, and locomotion at 30\u00b0 angle are i llustrated in the footnote of\nTable 2\n. We performed two tests to evaluate sensory system, which included touch on face (touching face with cotton swab) and extremities and mild pin prick on limbs for pain assessment. We checked the coordination and muscle strength of pups by measuring the latency to slip down the slope after placing them on the upper end of a ramp pitched at a slope of 60\u00b0. Gait was assessed as grade 0 (no locomotion), 1 (crawls with trunk touching the ground for few steps and then rolls over), 2 (walks taking alternate steps, trunk low and cannot walk on inclined surface), 3 (walks taking alternate steps, cannot propel its body using the hind legs synchronously, but walks on 30\u00b0 inclined surface), 4 (walks, runs, and jumps without restriction, propels the body using synchronously the back legs, but limitation in speed, balance, and coordination manifesting as clumsiness in gait), or 5 (normal walking).\nTable 2.\nNeurobehavioral evaluation of GCs-treated pups compared to saline-treated controls at postnatal day 14\nSystem\nTests\nSaline\nControl\n(n = 12)\nDexa\nLow-dose\n(n = 7)\nBeta\nLow-dose\n(n = 7)\nDexa\nHigh-dose\n(n = 8)\nBeta\nHigh-dose\n(n = 9)\nHigh dose\nDexa and\nMifepristone\n(n = 8)\nCranial Nerve\nAversive response to alcohol\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\nSucking and Swallowing\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\nVision\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\nMotor\nMotor activity:\nHead\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\nFore legs\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (2,3)\n3 (2,3)\n3 (3,3)\nHind legs\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n2 (2,3)\n*\n\u2020\n2 (2,3)\n*\n\u2020\n3 (3,3)\nRighting reflex\na\n5 (5,5)\n4 (4,5)\n5 (4,5)\n3.5 (2.5,5)\n*\n4(2.7,4)\n***\n4 (4,5)\nLocomotion on 30\u00b0inclination\nb\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (1.5,3)\n3 (2,3)\n3 (3,3)\nTone in forelimb\nc\n0 (0,0)\n0 (0,0)\n0 (0,0)\n0 (0,0)\n0 (0,0)\n0 (0,0)\nTone in hind limb\nc\n0 (0,0)\n0 (0,0)\n0 (0,0)\n0 (0,0)\n0 (0,0)\n0 (0,0)\nAbility to hold their position\nat 60\u00b0inclination (Average\nlatency to slip down the slope,\nin seconds)\n22.1\n18.9\n18.1\n11\n***\n,\n\u2020\u2020\n11 4\n***\n\u2020\u2020\n20\n##\nDistance walked in inches in\n60s\n111.8\n103.9\n105.1\n67.6\n***\n,\n\u2020\u2020\n56.8\n***\n,\n\u2020\u2020\n101.6\n##\nPosture\n4 (4,4)\n4 (4,4)\n4 (4,4)\n3 (2.2,4)\n*\n3 (3,4)\n*\n3.5 (4,4)\nGait\n4 (4,4)\n4 (4,4)\n4 (4,4)\n3(1.5,4)\n*\n2.5 (2,4)\n*\n,\n***\n4 (3,4.4)\nMotor impairment (%)\nd\n0%\n0%\n0%\n37%\n44%\n0%\nSensory\nFacial touch\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\nPain\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\n3 (3,3)\nOpen in a new tab\nValues are median and interquartile range.

    "Methods": "Animals and drug treatment\nAge- and sex matched 3\u20134 months old HIV-1 gp120tg and non-transgenic littermate control mice (WT) (\nToggas et al., 1994\n) were s. c. injected with a sterile-filtered solution of METH ((+)-Methamphetamine hydrochloride, M-8750, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, WA) or with saline (SAL, vehicle control) (\nRoberts et al., 2010\n). METH was given for 25 days in an established escalating-dose, multiple-binge regimen that was developed to recapitulate a human usage pattern and avoids hyperthermia (\nHenry et al., 2013\n;\nKuczenski et al., 2007\n). Briefly, in the first 14 days, mice were injected 3 times a day, starting from 0.1 mg/kg and increasing step-wise by 0.1 mg/kg with each injection up to 4.0 mg/kg. This period was followed by an 11-day \u2018binge\u2019 with 4 injections per day of 6.0 mg/kg in 2-hour intervals and a 6\u20137 months long period without further METH exposure. All experimental procedures and protocols involving animals were in accordance with NIH guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute and The Scripps Research Institute.\n\nBehavioral testing\nAt 10\u201311 months of age, a sex-matched cohort of each experimental group was subjected to behavioral testing (HIV-1 gp120tg SAL n = 11, HIV-1 gp120tg METH n = 10, WT SAL n = 8, WT METH n = 10). Tests were performed in the order below, separated by 3\u20137 days. i)\nLocomotor activity test\n: Locomotor activity was measured in polycarbonate cages placed into frames mounted with two levels of photocell beams at 2 and 7 cm above the bottom of the cage (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA). These two sets of beams allow for the recording of both horizontal (ambulation, center activity and total horizontal activity) and vertical (rearing) behavior. Mice were tested for 120 min. For the purpose of analysis and graphing, the 120 min period was divided into time blocks of 24 \u00d7 5 min epochs. Mean values were calculated for each epoch and experimental group. ii)\nOptomotor vision test:\nThis test used a stationary elevated platform surrounded by a drum with black and white striped walls. The mouse was habituated on the platform to for one min and then the drum rotated at 2 rpm in one direction for one min, stopped for 30 sec, and then rotated in the other direction for one min. The total number of head tracks was recorded. iii)\nBarnes maze test\n: The Barnes maze is a spatial learning and memory test sensitive to impaired hippocampal function (\nBach et al., 1995\n;\nBarnes, 1979\n;\nHolmes et al., 2002\n;\nPaylor et al., 2001\n). Distinct spatial cues were located all around the maze and were kept constant throughout the study. On the first day of testing, a training session was performed, which consisted of placing the mouse in the escape box for one min before the first session was started. At the beginning of each session, the mouse was placed in the middle of the maze in a 10 cm high start chamber. After 10 sec the start chamber was removed, a buzzer (80 dB) and a light (400 lux) were turned on, and the mouse was set free to explore the maze. The session ended when the mouse entered the escape tunnel or after 3 min elapsed. Mice were tested once a day for 9 days for the acquisition portion of the study. For the probe test (day 10), the escape tunnel was removed and the mouse was allowed to freely explore the maze for 3 min. The time spent in each quadrant was determined and the percent time spent in the target quadrant (the one originally containing the escape box) was compared with the average percent time in the other three quadrants. Each session was videotaped and scored by an experimenter blind to the genotype and group of the mouse. Measures recorded included the latency to escape the maze, the number of errors made per session, and the strategy employed by the mouse to locate the escape tunnel. Search strategies were classified according to three operationally defined categories: 1) Random search strategy - localized hole searches separated by crossings through the center of the maze, 2) Sequential search strategy - systematic hole searches (every hole or every other hole) in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, or 3) Spatial search strategy - reaching the escape tunnel with both error and distance (number of holes between the first hole visited and the escape tunnel) scores of less than or equal to 3.\n\nImmunostaining and deconvolution microscopy\nImmunostainings of sagittal brain sections were performed as previously published (\nKang et al., 2010\n;\nMaung et al., 2014\n;\nMaung et al., 2012\n) with minor modifications. Briefly, mice were terminally anesthetized and immediately transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline. Brains were quickly removed and fixed for 48 hours in 4% paraformaldehyde. 30 \u00b5m thick brain sections were stained with antibodies to MAP-2 (Sigma, M-4403; 1 : 250) and Synaptophysin (Syp; Dako, A0010; 1 : 250). Additional sections were stained with mouse IgG1 (MOPC21, Sigma, M-9269) serving as isotype control for the MAP-2 antibody, or secondary antibody alone. Secondary antibodies were goat-anti-mouse-Rhodamine Red X (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1 : 125) and goat-anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen; 1 : 1,000). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen). Stained brain slices were mounted on glass slides and covered with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs, H-1000). Investigators blinded to treatment and genotype performed the microscopy analysis. Images were recorded with 0.5 \u00b5m steps along the Z-axis on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope using a 40\u00d7/0.75 EC Plan-Neofluar objective and constant exposure times. The images were deconvolved and analyzed using Slidebook Software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). To assess neuronal injury, we estimated the percentage of MAP-2 and Syp-positive neuropil as a measure for neurites and presynaptic terminals, respectively, in layer III of the fronto-parietal cortex and the molecular layer of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The volume of neuropil occupied by MAP-2-labeled processes or Syp-positive presynaptic terminals was estimated by threshold segmentation and calculated as the ratio of fluorescent to total volume of each image stack and expressed in percent.\n\nElectrophysiology experiments\nHippocampal slices were prepared from male WT or HIV-1 gp120tg mice with a mean age of 10.5 months. Mice were killed by decapitation under deep terminal anesthesia with isoflurane. Brains were surgically exposed, gently scooped out of the skull and placed in a Petri dish filled with oxygenated ice-cold sucrose-substituted artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; in mM, NaCl, 125; KCl, 3; NaHCO\n3\n, 25; NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.25; Glucose, 10; MgCl\n2\n, 1; and CaCl\n2\n, 2, aerated with 95% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\n). Slices (400\u00b0\u00b5m thick) containing the hippocampal formation and entorhinal cortex were kept in a holding chamber containing oxygenated aCSF at 32\u00b0C for a minimum of 2 hours before being transferred to the multielectrode array (MEA; MEA60 Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany) for electrophysiological recording.\nWhile in the recording chamber, slices were continuously superfused with oxygenated aCSF at an estimated flow rate of 12 ml/min. Slices were left to recover for 15\u201330 min while the background spontaneous electrical activity was continuously monitored. We used a two-input protocol for orthodromic stimulation of Sch\u00e4ffer collateral axonal fibers (CA3\u2192CA1) located in the stratum radiatum. The distance between the test and control inputs was between 600 to 800 \u00b5m. A single electrode located on the CA3 side was chosen as the test input while a second electrode located on the subicular side of the recording field was used as the control input. Electrical stimulation evoked field excitatory post synaptic potentials (fEPSP) in CA1 pyramidal neurons and long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced by a series of 4 high frequency stimuli (tetanic stimulation) following published protocols (\nBesl and Fromherz, 2002\n;\nBorkholder et al., 1997\n). The parameters used for data analysis were slope of the fEPSP amplitude of the presynaptic fiber volley and the intensity of the stimulus.\n\nGABA and glutamate RT\n2\nProfiler\u2122 PCR Array\nMice were terminally anesthetized and immediately transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline. Brains were quickly removed, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. RNA was purified from mouse hemibrains using a Qiagen RNeasy kit. Samples were analyzed for expression of 84 genes involved in the GABA and glutamate neurotransmitter systems by RT\n2\nProfiler\u2122 PCR Arrays (PAMM-152) following the supplier\u2019s instructions (SABioscience/Qiagen). The arrays were run on a ViiA7\u2122 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies). The RT\n2\nProfiler\u2122 PCR Array Data Analysis software package (version 3.5) used 2\n\u2212(\u0394\u0394CT)\n\u2013based fold change calculations (\nLivak and Schmittgen, 2001\n) and a modified Student\u2019s t-test to compute two-tail, equal variance\np\n-values. Data were normalized to the housekeeping genes hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (\nHprt\n), heat shock protein 90 alpha (cytosolic), class B member 1 (\nHsp90ab1\n), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (\nGapdh\n).\n\nBioinformatics analysis\nA list of 20 genes out of 84 tested showed significant fold changes of RNA expression in at least one of the comparisons between the experimental groups and was further analyzed for identification of functional gene networks using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Ingenuity\u00ae Systems,\nwww.ingenuity.com\n; build version: 261899; content version: 18030641; release date: 2013-12-06). The following settings were used: Reference set: Ingenuity Knowledge Base (Genes + Endogenous Chemicals); Relationship to include: Direct; Includes Endogenous Chemicals; Optional Analyses: My Pathways My List; Filter Summary: Consider only molecules and/or relationships where (confidence = Experimentally Observed) AND (tissues/cell lines = Cerebral Ventricles OR SF-539 OR Amygdala OR Parietal Lobe OR Brainstem OR Trigeminal Ganglion OR Spinal Cord OR U251 OR Sciatic Nerve OR Other Nervous System OR Olfactory Bulb OR Hypothalamus OR Brain OR Pituitary Gland OR Nucleus Accumbens OR Putamen OR Substantia Nigra OR SNB-75 OR U87MG OR Cerebellum OR Striatum OR Granule Cell Layer OR Other Neuroblastoma Cell Lines OR Thalamus OR Cerebral Cortex OR Nervous System not otherwise specified OR Other CNS Cell Lines OR SF-268 OR Dorsal Root Ganglion OR Caudate Nucleus OR Subventricular Zone OR Neuroblastoma Cell Lines not otherwise specified OR SNB-19 OR Medulla Oblongata OR Ventricular Zone OR Gray Matter OR Hippocampus OR SK-N-SH OR White Matter OR CNS Cell Lines not otherwise specified OR Choroid Plexus OR Corpus Callosum OR SF-295).\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatView software (version 5.0.1; SAS Institute Inc.) was used for statistical analysis. If not indicated otherwise, ANOVA with Fisher\u2019s protected least significant difference (PLSD) post hoc tests were performed. Values indicate mean \u00b1 SEM. For the behavioral tests, ANOVAs included the factors genotype (WT vs. HIV-1 gp120tg), group (SAL vs. METH), sex (male vs. female) as well as a within subjects factor time (locomotor test) or trial (Barnes maze test). Where significant effects were observed, follow-up 2-way ANOVAs were performed. In addition, analyses determined\na priori\nwere performed in order to specifically examine the difference between WT and HIV-1 gp120tg mice treated with SAL, the effect of METH in each of the two genotypes, as well as a comparison of METH effects in the two genotypes."

    "Methods": "Stable expression of wild-type (WT) ALDH2 or mutant ALDH2*2 in SH-SY5Y cells\nHuman neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium supplemented with Nutrient mixture F-12 (Ham) (1:1, v/v) (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), 2 g/L sodium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin and 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified air with 5% CO\n2\n. SH-SY5Y cells were grown to 80\u201390 % confluence and then sub-cultured into different culture plates. The cDNAs of WT ALDH2 (GenBank ID:\nBC002967\n) and (E504K) ALDH2*2 mutant were constructed and subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) containing FLAG-tag sequences (DYKDDDDK). Both plasmids were transfected to SH-SY5Y cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing WT ALDH2 and mutant ALDH2*2 were selected in the presence of 1.5 mg/ml G418 (geneticin sulfate) (Sigma-Aldrich). Positive clones were confirmed by Western blot analysis as described below and maintained in the medium containing 1 mg/ml G418.\n\nPreparation of primary culture of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons\nPrimary cultured substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic neurons were prepared as described previously (\nWang et al., 2011\n). Briefly, substantia nigra was dissected from embryonic day 12 to 15 rats and cultured in DMEM/F12 medium containing pronase (0.5 mg/ml, Roche) and DNase I (0.3mg/ml, Roche) for 50 min at 37 \u00b0C. Tissue fragments were subsequently triturated, and dissociated cells were plated onto poly-L-lysine and collagen-coated six well dishes. SN neurons were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum and GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic growth factor; 25 ng/ml). 5\u2032-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine and uridine, which prevent proliferation of glial cells, were added into culture medium after 24 hours. Primary neuronal culture of substantia nigra consisted mainly of large oval-shaped dopaminergic neurons and small non-dopaminergic cells. In accordance with our previous studies (\nWang et al., 2007\n,\nWang et al., 2011\n), two subpopulations of neurons, large multipolar or oval-shaped tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive dopaminergic cells (diameter = 25\u201330 \u03bcm), which was confirmed by TH immunostaining (data not shown), and small non-dopaminergic cells (diameter = 15\u201320 \u03bcm), were found in SN neuronal culture.\n\nImmunoblot analysis\nProtein samples were prepared by homogenization of SH-SY5Y cells or SN neurons in SDS sample buffer. Subsequently, protein lysate or the immunocomplex was separated on 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membrane. Then, the membrane was incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight with one of the following diluted primary antibodies: (1) Anti-FLAG monoclonal antiserum (Sigma-Aldrich). (2) Polyclonal anti-Complex IV antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). (3) Polyclonal anti-cleaved active caspase 9 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). (4) Polyclonal anti-cleaved active caspase 3 antiserum (Cell Signaling Technology). (5) Polyclonal anti-Bax antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). (6) Polyclonal anti-cytochrome c antiserum (Abcam). After the washes, the membranes were incubated with horse anti-mouse, anti-donkey or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP) linked secondary antibodies. Then, immunoreactive proteins were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (GE Biosciences). To confirm equal amount of protein sample loading, membranes were stripped and reblotted with monoclonal anti-actin antibody (Chemicon). Gel bands were quantified by a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics Model 375A) and normalized by reprobing the same blot for the actin signals.\n\nSubcellular expression of FLAG-tagged ALDH2\nTo analyze the subcellular distribution of ALDH2, mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions of SH-SY5Y cells expressing WT or (E504K) ALDH2*2 were prepared. Briefly, stable clones were lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 210 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, pH7.3, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 5 \u03bcg/ml pepstain, 5 \u03bcg/ml leupetin, 5 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin, and 0.3 mM PMSF. Cells were homogenized using a Dounce tissue grinder on ice, and cell lysate was centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 9500\u00d7g for 9 min at 4 \u00b0C to pellet the mitochondrial fraction. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C, and the final supernatant was used as cytosolic fraction. Protein samples (15 \u03bcg) of mitochondrial or cytosolic extracts were separated on a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membrane. Then, FLAG tagged ALDH2 on the membrane was visualized by using a ECL protocol as described above. To verify the purity of mitochondrial fraction and detect possible mitochondrial contamination of cytosolic extract, membrane was stripped and reblotted with monoclonal anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX-IV), a mitochondrial marker (Molecular Probes). We verified that COX-IV is present in mitochondrial fraction and not detected in cytosolic extract.\n\nMeasurement of ALDH2 activity\nALDH2 activity was determined in the samples, using aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 activity assay kit (Abcam), according to the manufacture\u2019s recommendation. Briefly, the diluted proteins were added into the well of the microplate, coating specific anti-ALDH2 antibody, and enzymatic activity of ALDH2 was determined by monitoring the generation of NADH. The production of NADH was coupled to a reporter dye to yield a yellow colored reaction product whose concentration could be determined by measuring the increase in absorbance at 450 nm for 60 min on a Beckman DU800 spectrophotometer.\n\nDetermination of 4-HNE level\n4-HNE-histidine ELISA kit (Cell Biolabs) was used to measure the levels of 4-HNE in cellular or tissue extracts. Briefly, protein extracts or bovine serum albumin (BSA) standards were adsorbed onto a 96-wells microplate for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. The anti-4-HNE-histidine antibody was used to probe with the 4-HNE-protein adduct content, which was subsequently measured by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary antibody and quantified by comparing with the standard curve of 4-HNE-BSA standards.\n\nConfocal imaging of mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation\nFor the determination of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m), SH-SY5Y cells or cultured SN dopaminergic neurons were loaded with a potential sensitive dye TMRM (tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; 100 nM; Molecular Probes) in HEPES buffered saline (NaCl 140 mM, KCl 5 mM, MgCl\n2\n1 mM, CaCl\n2\n2 mM, glucose 10 mM, HEPES 5 mM, pH 7.3) for 10 min at room temperature. SH-SY5Y cells or SN neurons were then washed with HEPES buffered saline, and transferred to the recording chamber mounted on a Leica DM6000 microscope equipped with Leica TCS SP5 confocal spectral scanning system and a 100\u00d7 oil immersion objective. TMRM was excited at 543 nm with a HeNe green laser, and the emitted fluorescent signal at 560\u2013620 nm was collected. Z-stacks of 15 confocal TMRM fluorescence images (with an acquisition interval along the z-axis of 0.3 \u03bcm) were processed and analyzed by LAS AF software (Leica) as previously described (\nWang et al., 2011\n).\nConfocal MitoSOX Red staining was performed to visualize mitochondrial level of superoxide anion in SH-SY5Y cells and SN dopaminergic neurons. MitoSOX Red selectively targeted to the mitochondria is oxidized by superoxide and exhibits red fluorescence. SH-SY5Y cells and cultured SN neurons were incubated with 5 \u03bcM MitoSOX Red (Molecular Probes) for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C. After washout, MitoSOX Red was excited at 514 nm with an Ar-blue laser, and fluorescence signal was detected at 540\u2013620 nm emission. MitoSOXRed fluorescence images were analyzed by Leica LAS AF software.\n\nAssays of cell survival\nCell survival was assessed by WST-8 [2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt] assays using Cell Counting Kit-8 (Fluka-Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA). A total of 1\u00d710\n4\nSH-SY5Y cells were seeded per well in a 96-well plate. SH-SY5Y cells were administered with various concentrations of rotenone ranging from 0 to 500 ng/ml. After 24-hour incubation, 10 \u03bcl of WST-8 was added into each well in a humidified 5% CO\n2\natmosphere at 37\u00b0C for an additional 1 hour of incubation. The optical density (OD) was measured with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) at 450 nm.\n\nRotenone-induced mouse model of parkinsonism and Alda-1 treatment\nC57BL/6 mice (2\u20133 months old) weighing 20\u201325 g were purchased from the National Laboratory Animal Center (Taipei, Taiwan). All animals used for this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Chang Gung University. Mice were randomly divided into the following 6 groups: control group, Alda-1 treated group, rotenone treated group, Alda-1 plus rotenone treated group, MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) treated group, and Alda-1 plus MPTP treated group. Mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with saline in the control group for 14 days. Mice treated with Alda-1 (50 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 14 days served as the Alda-1 treated group. In rotenone treated group, mice were treated with rotenone (50 mg/kg/day, oral administration) for 14 days. For Alda-1 plus rotenone treated group, mice were intraperitoneally administered with Alda-1 (50 mg/kg) six hours before rotenone dosing. In addition, we tested the effect of Alda-1 on MPTP model for parkinsonism. In MPTP treated group, mice were injected with MPTP (40 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 14 days. For Alda-1 plus MPTP treated group, mice were intraperitoneally administered with Alda-1 (50 mg/kg) six hours before MPTP dosing. Six animals from each group were used for the analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry.\n\nQuantification of SN tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons\nFor immunohistochemical analyses, mice were deeply anesthetized by chloral hydrate (450mg/kg, i.p.) and intracardially perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. The brains were rapidly removed from skull, postfixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and stored in 30% sucrose at 4 \u00b0C. The brains were frozen and processed into 30 \u03bcm-thick coronal sections using a microtome cryostat (CM3000, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) at \u221220 \u00b0C. The freeze-floating brain sections were rinsed in PBS and then incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min. The sections were washed in PBS containing 0.3% Triron X-100 (PBS-T) and then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibody (1:1000; Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) in PBS-T containing 10% normal goat serum overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After two washes with PBS-T, the sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in PBS-T for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by incubation in avidin-biotin complex (1:2000; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in PBS-T for 1 hour at room temperature. Visualization of TH immunoreactivity was performed by incubating with 0.05% diaminobenzidine-HCl (DAB) for 2\u20135 min. TH-positive dopaminergic neurons were visualized and counted under a Leica DM2500 microscope equipped with an RET 2000R CCD camera (Qimaging, Surrey, BC, Canada) and a 3-axis computer-controlled MAC 600 motorized stage (Ludl Electronics, Hawthorne, NY, USA) with the aid of StereoInvestigator software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT, USA) as previously described (\nChen et al., 2012\n). Each experimental analysis, 15\u201320 brain sections per mouse were processed.\n\nChemicals\nRotenone (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (1 mM stock solution) and then diluted in culture medium. Alda-1 (N-(1,3-Benzodioxol-5-ylmethyl)-2,6-dichloro-benzamide) was provided by Dr. Daria Mochly-Rosen. All other chemicals used in this study are of the highest grade purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD value of n experiments. Statistical significance among multiple experimental groups was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s test. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test (two-tailed) was used to determine the significant differences between two groups of data. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to measure the correlation between two variables. A\nP\nvalue <0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animals used in the experiments were managed according to the ARVO statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research. All experiments using animals were approved by the NEI Animal Care and Use Committee.\nOlfm1\nmutant mice have been reported previously (\nCheng et al., 2007\n,\nNakaya et al., 2013\n). A mouse line in which the cre expression is under the control of regulatory sequences of the mouse zona pellucida 3 gene promoter (ZP3-cre) (\nLewandoski et al., 1997\n) was obtained from the Jackson laboratory.\n\nGeneration and characterization of Olfm2 KO mice\nOlfm2\nKO (\nOlfm2\n-KO) mice were generated by deleting exons 2\u20136 of the\nOlfm2\ngene. A BAC clone containing mouse\nOlfm2\nlocus was obtained from Geneservices (Cambridge, UK) and was used to construct a targeting vector in which exons 2\u20136 were replaced with the\nLacZ\ngene (\u03b2-galactosidase or \u03b2-gal). This targeting vector also contained a PGK neo-cassette flanked by the LoxP sites. The targeting vector was electroporated into R1 (129S6) ES cell line. Clones resistant to G418 were selected, expanded, and screened for homologous recombination using long range genomic PCR and Southern blotting. For Southern blotting of the 5\u2032 flanking probe, genomic DNA was cleaved with ScaI to produce restriction fragments of 15.5 and 9.3 kb for the WT and KO alleles, respectively. For the 3\u2032 flanking probe, genomic DNA was cleaved with BamHI to produce restriction fragments of 14.2 and 12.3 kb for the WT and KO alleles, respectively. Further characterization of positive embryonic stem cell clones was done by karyotyping. Two positive clones were injected into the C57BL/6 mouse blastocyst. Generation of chimeric mice and germ line transmission were performed as described previously (\nMichalska and Choo, 1993\n). The selection marker LoxP-PGK-neo-LoxP was removed by mating mice with the ZP3-cre line. Genotyping of animals was performed by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from the tails of 4 week-old mice. A single PCR reaction was designed using a common forward PCR primer located in intron 1 - Olfm2C-F 5\u2032-GCTCTGTGGATGGGTTCCTA-3\u2032 and two reverse primers - Olfm2-WTR2 5\u2032-GAGGCAAAAGGGAATGTCAG-3\u2032 located in intron 2 for the WT allele and Olfm2-KOR2 5\u2032-CTTGAGCAGCTCCTTGCTG-3\u2032 located in\nLacZ\nfor the targeted allele. The PCR was performed by initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles with denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing and elongation at 60\u00b0C for 1 min and a final elongation at 72\u00b0C for 7 minutes using TaKaRa LA Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio).\nQuantitative RT-PCR (Q-PCR)\nRNA was isolated from the adult mouse brain using a Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cDNA was synthesize using 1 \u03bcg of total RNA and a cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems Inc. ABI). Q-PCR was performed with synthesized cDNA as a template using a SYBR Green PCR master mix (ABI) and a real-time thermocycler (7900HT; ABI).\nGAPDH\nwas used for normalization. Primers for Q-PCR have been previously described (\nSultana et al., 2011\n). Each sample was analyzed in triplicates. Experiment was repeated twice using independent samples.\n\nAntibody production\nPurified Olfm2 was purchased from R&D systems. A polyclonal antibody generated against purified Olfm2 was produced by Covance, Inc. This antibody detected Olfm2 but not closely related Olfm1 or Olfm3 proteins expressed in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with corresponding expression constructs. A polyclonal Olfm2 peptide antibody generated against synthetic peptide RSLDARLRAADGSVSAKSF was reported previously (\nSultana et al., 2011\n).\n\n\u03b2-gal enzymatic assay\nPostnatal and adult brains and eyes from WT,\nOlfm2\nheterozygous and homozygous KO mice were fixed for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and washed in PBS three times for 15 min. Coronal brain slices (100 \u03bcm thick) were made using a vibratome (Vibratome Leica VT 1000 S). Slices were incubated in stain buffer containing 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 1 mg/ml X-gal (Invitrogen) for 24\u201372 h at 37\u00b0C. The reactions were stopped by washing in PBS three times for 10 min. Sections were then mounted on slides, dried overnight, dehydrated through grades of alcohol, and mounted. Sections from WT mice were used as control for \u03b2-gal background staining. Some sections were counterstained with Vector nuclear fast red stain (Vector laboratories) for 5\u201310 min, washed for 10 min, dehydrated and mounted. Entire brains were incubated in stain buffer for whole brain staining. For retinal whole mount staining, retinas were incubated in stain buffer for 24\u201372 h, followed by PBS wash and flat mounting on slides. For frozen eye sections, fixed stained eyes were equilibrated in 30% sucrose, embedded in OCT compound (Electron Microscopy Sciences), 12 \u03bcm frozen sections were prepared, and counter stained with nuclear fast red stain.\nIntraocular pressure measurements\nIOP measurements in both the eyes of Olfm2 KO and WT littermates were measured using a handheld digital tonometer (Tonolab Icare, Helsinki, Finland) in the morning. The average value of five consecutive measurements with a deviation less the 5% was recorded.\n\nVisual evoked potential (VEP) and electroretinogram (ERG)\nMice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (9 mg/kg). Pupils were dilated with 1% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine. ERG and VEP were recorded simultaneously using an Espion E2 electrophysiology system (Diagnosys, LLC MA, USA). Two subdermal needle electrodes were placed 2 mm lateral to lambda on each side for VEP recording. Standard ERG were recorded on both eyes with a gold wire loop electrode placed in the center of the cornea, a reference electrode placed in the forehead, and a grounding electrode in the tail. White xenon flashes of 0.3\u2013100 cd.s/m\n2\nin white background were generated every 0.5 sec and responses were recorded simultaneously for 0.3 sec after each stimulation. Results were averaged from 100 repetitive responses.\n\nOptic nerve morphological analysis\nAnimals were perfused transcardially with a fixative containing 2% PFA and 2% glutaraldehyde. Optic nerves were carefully dissected and placed in a fixative overnight. The nerve segments were washed three times in PBS, placed in 2% osmium tetroxide for 1 h, washed with PBS, dehydrated in ethanol, and subsequently embedded in an epoxy resin. For light microscopy 1 \u03bcm thick semi thin cross sections were cut and stained with 1% toluidine blue/paraphenylenediamine. For electron microscopy analysis, 80 nm thin sections were cut. Total optic nerve cross-section area was measured using light microscopy pictures at 10x magnification and cross-section images of axons were photographed at 2,200x or 4,000x magnification.\n\nMouse behavioral tests\nWT and homozygous 2\u20138 month-old\nOlfm2\n-KO mice were used for behavioral analysis. Animals of the same age were used for each behavioral test.\nAn Elevated Plus Maze Test (EMT) was carried out on five pairs of\nOlfm2\n-KO and WT littermates with age ranging from 5 to 8 months. H10-35-EPM system (Coulbourn Instruments, PA) was used as described previously (\nLister, 1987\n,\nPark et al., 2005\n,\nMead et al., 2006\n). Briefly, each mouse was placed in the central area of the plus maze and was allowed to explore different areas for 10 minutes. Each experiment was recorded using a camera connected to a computer. The time spent in each area, the number of entries made into different areas, and the latency to enter an open and closed area was calculated for each animal. Marble burying behavior was also used to test the anxiety behavior of\nOlfm2\n-KO and their WT littermates. Twenty green marbles were placed on the top of a 10 cm deep flake bedding in a clear mouse cage. Each animal was placed individually in a cage and kept there for 20 min. At the end of the test, marbles with more than 2/3 of their surface area covered or completely hidden by the bedding were counted (\nThomas et al., 2009\n).\nGeneral locomotive activity was measured in the open field test as described previously (\nBasta-Kaim et al., 2011\n). Spontaneous locomotor activity was recorded by placing mice in the middle of an arena (44.5 \u00d7 44.5 cm). The distance traveled in 10 min was monitored by infrared beams using Auto-Track software (Columbus Instruments, Opto-Varimex 4). Anxiety-like behavior was tested by placing mice in the arena described above that was divided into light and dark compartments (44.5 \u00d7 22 cm each). The compartments were connected by a small opening (10 \u00d7 10 cm). Mice were placed in the light compartment and time that they spent in each compartment as well as the amount of entries into each compartment was recorded using infrared beams during the 10 min test period.\nCoordinated motor activities were measured by a rotarod apparatus (Ugo-Basile, Varese, Italy). Mice were placed on an accelerating rotating rod at 4 rpm. The speed of rotation was gradually increased up to 40 rpm and the time until the mice fell to the floor was recorded. Each animal was tested three times a day for three consecutive days and the mean values were calculated.\nOlfactory sensitivity of\nOlfm2\n-KO and WT littermates was assessed as described previously (\nWitt et al., 2009\n). Mice were individually habituated to the experimental environment by placing them sequentially in three clean, empty cages for 15 min in each cage. After habituation in the test cage, filter papers (5 \u00d7 5 cm) scented with either water or test odorant were sequentially placed in a cage for 3 min with an interval of 1 min between each odorant. Mouse behavior was recorded using a digital video camera. Exploratory time was measured in sec and defined as the time when the mouse nose was < 1 mm from the filter paper.\n\nSubcellular fractionation, Western blot and immunoprecipitation\nThe cerebral cortex and retina (n=5) were isolated from WT mice and were homogenized followed by fractionation as described previously (\nHallett et al., 2008\n). Briefly, for the synaptic membrane fraction, the dissected cortex and retina were homogenized in an ice cold buffer containing 320 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris base, 5 mM NaF, 1mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4 supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and centrifuged for 10 min at 800 g at 4\u00b0C. Supernatant (S1) was collected and centrifuged for 15 min at 9,200 g at 4\u00b0C. The resultant pellet (P2) was re-suspended in a buffer containing 35.6 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris base, 5 mM NaF,1 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 1 mM EDTA, 1mM EGTA, pH 7.4 supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail, vortexed for 5\u201310 sec, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The re-suspended P2 pellet was then centrifuged for 20 min at 25,000 g at 4\u00b0C. Supernatant (LS1) was removed and the pellet (LP1) containing synaptosomal membrane from the cortex and the retina were re-suspended after brief washing. The LS1 and LP1 fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against Olfm2 (peptide polyclonal 1:500 dilution), Olfm1 (monoclonal 1:2000 dilution), GluR2 (Millipore, 1:2000 dilution), PSD95 (Cell Signaling, 1:1000 dilution) and tubulin (Promega, 1:1000 dilution). The cerebral cortex was isolated from\nOlfm2\n-KO (n=3) and WT littermates (n=3) and was fractionated to get LP1 fraction as described above. The levels of various synaptic proteins was analyzed using antibodies against Olfm2 (polyclonal 1:500 dilution), Olfm1 (monoclonal 1:2000 dilution), GluR1, GluR3 and CNIH2 (Synaptic Systems, 1:2000 dilution), GluR4, GluR2, pGluR2 and synaptophysin (Millipore, 1:2000 dilution), PSD95, PKC\u03b1 (Cell Signaling, 1:1000 dilution), synaptogyrin3 (Abcam 1:1000) and tubulin (Promega, 1:1000 dilution). For co-immunopreciptation experiments, the LP1 fractions from\nOlfm2\nKO, and\nOlfm1\nmutant along with WT littermates were used. Briefly, the LP1 fractions were first treated with protein G at 4\u00b0C for 3 h to reduce the background followed by centrifugation to pellet the agarose G beads. The supernatant LP1 fraction was then incubated for 1 h with 0.5 \u03bcg of polyclonal antibodies against Olfm1, GluR2 (Millipore) or control IgG at 4\u00b0C. 50 \u03bcl of homogeneous protein G beads suspension blocked with 0.05% BSA was added to the mixture and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on a rotator. Protein G beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer and bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against Olfm2 (1:500 dilution), GluR2 (1:2000 dilution), CNIH2 (1:2000), PSD95 (1:1000), and Olfm1 (monoclonal,1:2000 dilution).\n\nStatistical analysis\nData from various experiments were analyzed using a student\u2019s unpaired t test."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (120\u2013140 g) were purchased from Charles River (Livermore, CA). They were housed 3\u20134 per cage under a 12/12 hr light-dark cycle in a temperature-controlled room, with free access to food and water.\n\nnAChR agonist treatment\nIn study 1, rats were surgically implanted with osmotic minipumps (\nFig. 1\n) (Alzet model 2006, delivery rate: 0.15 \u00b5l/hr; Durect Corporation, Cupertino, CA) containing vehicle or nicotine (1 mg/kg/d free base, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO). The rats were euthanized 8 wk after lesioning with depleted minipumps replaced as necessary.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nNAChR agonist treatment timeline of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Rats were pretreated with vehicle or nAChR agonists via an osmotic minipump and lesioned 2 wk later as detailed in Materials and Methods. The forepaw placement and adjusted stepping test were done 2 to 8 wk after lesioning to determine the extent of motor deficits.\nIn study 2, rats were implanted with minipumps containing vehicle, ABT-107 (0.25 mg/kg/d, AbbVie Inc. North Chicago, IL) or DMXB (2 mg/kg/day, from R.L. Papke). The ABT-107-treated and DMXB-treated rats were euthanized 8 and 4 wk after lesioning, respectively, with depleted minipumps replaced as necessary.\n\n6-OHDA lesioning\nTwo wk after minipump implantation, rats were unilaterally lesioned with 6-OHDA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) under isofluorane anesthesia, as previously described (\nBordia et al., 2008\n;\nBordia et al., 2010\n;\nCenci and Lundblad, 2007\n). 6-OHDA was dissolved in 0.02% ascorbic acid/saline at a concentration of 1.5 \u00b5g free base/\u00b5l. A 2 \u00b5l aliquot was stereotaxically injected into the medial forebrain bundle at the following coordinates relative to bregma and the dural surface: 1) anteroposterior bregma, \u22124.4; lateral midline, 1.2; dorsoventral dura, 7.8; tooth bar at \u22122.4; and 2) anteroposterior bregma, \u22124.0; lateral midline, 0.75; dorsoventral dura, 8.0; tooth bar at +3.4. The cannula was lowered into the injection site over a 2 min period. 6-OHDA was then infused over a 2 min period with the cannula maintained at the site of injection for an additional 2 min prior to removal, which was also done over 2 min. After surgery, the rats were given buprenorphine (0.02 mg/kg sc) for postoperative pain. All procedures conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by SRI Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nAssessment of motor impairment\nThe severity of 6-OHDA-induced motor impairment was assessed 2 to 8 wk after 6-OHDA lesioning, using two behavioral tests: the forepaw placement or cylinder test and the adjusted stepping test (Schallert et al., 2000;\nBordia et al., 2008\n;\nBordia et al., 2010\n). The forepaw placement test was performed by individually placing animals in a transparent, plexiglass cylinder. The number of upward contacts during exploratory rearing was then counted for 5 min for both forelimbs by a blinded rater. The use of the paw contralateral to the lesion was assessed as a percent of total contacts made, as previously described (\nBordia et al. 2008\n,\nBordia et al. 2010\n). The step test, another measure of contralateral forelimb use, was performed on the same day as the forepaw placement test, as described (\nSchallert et al., 1982\n,\nChang et al., 1999\n,\nFleming et al., 2012\n). The rat was held with the torso slightly raised and the hind limbs and one forelimb gently tucked. The rat was lifted above the table such that the weight of the body was supported by one forelimb alone. The rat was then moved slowly sideways with the forelimb bearing weight in the backhand and then forehand direction across a ~90 cm distance in ~5 sec. The number of steps made in each direction was recorded for both forelimbs. Three trials were performed and then averaged. The use of the paw contralateral to the lesion in the forehand direction was expressed as the percent of total forehand steps.\n\nTissue preparation\nThe rats were killed by decapitation using a guillotine. Brains were promptly removed and placed on ice. They were then bisected coronally at a mid-striatal level, with the anterior striatum used for\n3\nH-dopamine release and the striatum from the caudal portion frozen in isopentane on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. The caudal portion was later cut into 8 \u00b5m sections at \u221215 to \u221220\u00b0C in a cryostat (Leica Microsystems Inc., Deerfield, IL). The sections were thaw mounted onto poly-L-lysine coated slides, dried and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.\n\nDAT autoradiography\nStriatal DAT binding was performed using\n125\nI-RTI-121 (specific activity, 2200 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Waltham, MA) as described (\nQuik et al. 2003\n). The sections were preincubated at 22\u00b0C for two 15 min periods in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mM NaCl, and 5 mM KCl. Next, the sections were incubated for 2 h in the same buffer also containing 0.025% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 \u00b5M fluoxetine, and 50 pM\n125\nI-RTI-121. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of the uptake inhibitor nomifensine (100 \u00b5M). Afterwards, slides were washed four times for 15 min in ice-cold buffer, once for 10 s in ice-cold water and air dried. After drying, the slides were exposed to Kodak MR Film (Easterman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) for several days along with\n125\nI-microscale standards (American Radiolabeled chemicals, Inc., Saint Louis, MO).\n\nNicotine-evoked\n3\nH-dopamine release\nNicotine-evoked\n3\nH-dopamine release was performed as described (\nBordia et al., 2013b\n;\nQuik et al., 2003\n). Approximately 5 mg (wet weight) of the intact and lesioned striatum was homogenized in 2 ml of ice-cold 0.32 M sucrose buffered with 5.0 M HEPES (pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 12,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. The pellets obtained were re-suspended in 0.8 ml of uptake buffer (128 mM NaCl, 2.4 mM KCl, 3.2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM glucose, 1 mM ascorbic acid, 0.01 mM pargyline) and incubated for 10 min at 37\u00b0C.\n3\nH-Dopamine (100 nM, specific activity, 30\u201360 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Waltham, MA) was then added to the synaptosomes, followed by a 5 min incubation period. Next, 80 \u00b5l of re-suspended synaptosomes were pipetted onto glass-fiber filters mounted on polypropylene platforms and perfused for 10 min with perfusion buffer (uptake buffer with 0.1% BSA and 10 \u00b5M nomifensine).\n3\nH-Dopamine release was evoked by an 18 s exposure to 1 \u00b5M (sub-maximal) and 10 \u00b5M (maximal) nicotine concentrations. A separate set of filters were perfused with 50 nM \u03b1-CtxMII for 3 min prior to nicotine stimulation to determine the \u03b14\u03b22* and \u03b16\u03b22* nAChR-mediated components of total release. A total of twelve 18 s fractions were collected, which included basal release before and after stimulation. Radioactivity was counted using a liquid scintillation counter. The filters were dissolved in organic solvent and radioactivity also counted as a measure of\n3\nH-dopamine uptake into synaptosomes.\n\nData analyses\nAutoradiographic images were quantitated to determine the optical density values using the ImageQuant system (GE Healthcare (Chalfront, St. Giles, Buckinghamshire, UK). Background tissue values were subtracted from total tissue binding to evaluate specific binding of the radioligands. Specific binding values were then converted to fmol/mg tissue using standard curves generated from the\n125\nI-microscale standards. The sample OD readings were within the linear range of the standards. Data from the\n3\nH-dopamine release were analyzed using the curve-fitting algorithm of SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc, San Jose, CA), as previously described (\nBordia et al., 2013b\n;\nMcCallum et al., 2005\n). Statistical comparisons were done with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA) using student\u2019s t-test or ANOVA followed by a Dunnett or Bonferroni post hoc test. A value of p = 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Values are expressed as the mean \u00b1 S.E.M. of the indicated number of rats."

    "Methods": "Drosophila\nstocks and crosses\nAll flies were raised on corn-meal medium without propionic acid and were maintained at 25\u00b0C and 60% humidity under a 12:12 hr light-dark cycle unless otherwise stated. The following fly stocks were used: repo-Gal4, elav-Gal4, lGMR-Gal4 (longGMR, pan-photoreceptor-Gal4, BL8605), GMR-Gal4 (ninaE.GMR-Gal4, BL1104), UAS-ATP\u03b1-RNAi (short-hairpin, BL33646), UAS-nrv3-RNAi (BL29431) and tublin-Gal80\nts\n, all of which were obtained from the\nDrosophila\nStock Center in Bloomington. The fly stocks UAS-ATP\u03b1-RNAi (v100619), UAS-nrv1-RNAi (v103702) and UAS-nrv2-RNAi (v2660) were also used and supplied by the Vienna\nDrosophila\nRNAi Center. UAS-RNAi flies were crossed over specific GAL4 and Gal80\nts\nto either induce or inhibit the expression of RNAi, respectively.\nThe RNAi constructs of the Na\n+\n/K\n+\n-ATPase subunit genes were expressed in photoreceptors using the Gal4/UAS system (\nBrand and Perrimon, 1993\n;\nDietzl et al., 2007\n;\nRoy et al., 2013\n). The drivers lGMR-Gal4 (\nChen et al., 2014\n;\nTimofeev et al., 2012\n;\nWernet et al., 2003\n) and GMR-Gal4 (\nVelentzas et al., 2013\n) have a photoreceptor-specific expression pattern, and\nrepo-\n(\nAwasaki and Ito, 2004\n) and\nelav-\nGal4 (\nZhan et al., 2004\n) have glial and neuronal expression patterns, respectively. The Gal80ts/TARGET system was used for temporal control of UAS-RNAi expression (\nMcGuire et al., 2004\n).\n\nElectrophysiological recordings\nElectroretinograms (ERG) were recorded as previously described (\nLi and Montell, 2000\n). Flies were immobilized with thin strips of tape. Glass recording microelectrodes filled with Ringer\u2019s solution were placed on the eye surface of the fly. A second extracellular recording electrode was maintained on the thorax (as a reference). Five-second orange light pulses (4000 Lux) were used to stimulate the eye after adapting the fly to the dark for 1 min. The signal was amplified and recorded using a Warner IE210 intracellular electrometer.\nIn vivo\nphotoreceptor intracellular recordings were performed as previously described (\nJohnson and Pak, 1986\n). Briefly, a small portion of the cornea was removed with a sharp needle, and the opening was covered with Vaseline petroleum jelly. The intracellular recording electrodes were inserted into the retina through this opening. The recording electrodes had a resistance of 100\u2013150 M\u03a9 when filled with 4% neurobiotin (Vector Labs) in 2 M potassium acetate (KAc). The reference electrode was filled with Ringer\u2019s solution, and its tip was placed in the photoreceptor layer. The fly was dark-adapted for 10 min before measurement. Voltage responses were amplified using a Warner IE210 intracellular electrometer in current clamp mode. When the electrode was inserted into a cell, we measured the resting membrane potential in the dark based on a sudden increase of capacitance and tested the cell\u2019s response to 5 s orange light pulses (4000 Lux). After the recording, the cell was injected with neurobiotin by passing 1nA depolarizing rectangular pulses at 1 Hz for 5 min (\nKita and Armstrong, 1991\n). The retina was subsequently dissected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Invitrogen) and rhodamine phalloidin to confirm the photoreceptor identity of the recorded cell (\nSchnell et al., 2010\n).\n\nImmunofluorescence staining\nFor cryosectioning, 1-day-old fly heads were removed, incubated in 0.1 M phosphate buffer with increasing concentrations of sucrose, infiltrated and embedded in TFM tissue freezing medium (Ted Pella Inc.). Approximately 20 \u03bcm sections were cut at \u221220\u00b0C and subjected to immunofluorescence staining. After a 30 min incubation with blocking buffer (5% fetal bovine serum in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100), the brain sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer. After three washes in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, the brain sections were incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies for 3 hours at room temperature, washed and mounted in Vectashield medium (Vector Laboratories). The images were captured using confocal microscopy with an LSM 510 instrument (Zeiss). The monoclonal antibody \u03b15-IgG (1:100), which is specific for the \u03b1-subunit of the Na\n+\n/K\n+\n-ATPase, was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (\nBaumann et al., 2010\n;\nLebovitz et al., 1989\n;\nTakeyasu et al., 1988\n). We used the auto-fluorescent properties of visual pigments to mark pigment cells in the retina of red eye flies (\nPichaud and Desplan, 2001\n).\n\nElectron microscopy (EM)\nFly heads were removed, bisected and fixed in a solution of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH7.4), and processed for EM as previously described (\nMeinertzhagen and O\u2019Neil, 1991\n). After three washes, fly heads were post-fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide for 5 hours, dehydrated in ethanol, infiltrated with propylene oxide and embedded in polybed812 resin (08792-1; Polysciences). After sectioning and staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, the ultrastructures in the retina were examined at 80 KV using a Philips Tecnai 12 electron microscope.\n\nOptical neutralization analysis and retinal degeneration assay\nThis analysis was performed as previously described (\nFranceschini and Kirschfeld, 1971\n). Briefly, fly heads were separated from the body and immersed in a layer of lens oil to optically neutralize the cornea. On the microscope stage, a spotlight was shone into the head from the neck side to antidromically illuminate the compound eye. After the images were acquired with a CoolSNAP ES2 CCD Camera, the number of rhabdomeres that appeared as bright dots resulting from a high transmission of light were counted for each upright ommatidium (\nSengupta et al., 2013\n). Degeneration of photoreceptors was assessed directly with this method (\nLessing and Bonini, 2009\n). Briefly, a score ranging from 0 to 3 was given to each rhabdomere depending on the state of its degeneration: 3 was indicative of no degeneration; 0 corresponded to total loss of the rhabdomeres and a score of 1 or 2 suggested partial degeneration. The total score of an intact ommatidium is 21. The rhabdomere integrity index for a fly was the average score from 6 axially aligned ommatidia. For each group, the value of the integrity index was the average of 6 flies.\n\nMeasurement of extracellular K\n+\nconcentration ([K\n+\n]\no\n) in the retina\nThe extracellular K\n+\nactivity was measured in the fly retina using K\n+\n-selective double-barreled microelectrodes, which were fabricated as previously described (\nSandler and Kirschfeld, 1991\n;\nSemb et al., 1997\n). Briefly, a K\n+\n-selective microelectrode was pulled from the borosilicate double-barreled capillaries with a filament. The K\n+\n-selective barrel was silanized with\nN, N\n-Dimethyltrimethylsilylamine (41716, Fluka) at 200\u00b0C. The barrels were filled with 100 mM NaCl and 5 mM KCl. Next, the tip of the silanized barrel was filled by capillary action with a small amount (to approximately 100 \u03bcm from the tip) of the K\n+\nionophore I-Cocktail B (60398, Fluka). The electrodes were connected to the differential amplifier using a chlorinated silver wire. The K\n+\n-selective electrode was calibrated before and after each experiment in a series of solutions where concentrations of KCl and NaCl totaling 150 mM were varied reciprocally. To measure light-induced changes of the extracellular K\n+\nconcentration in the retina, the eye was illuminated for 40 seconds. The K\n+\nconcentrations were calculated from the Nernst equation. All the calibrations and experiments were carried out at room temperature (22\u201325\u00b0C) in a light tight Faraday cage.\n\nVisual behavior assays\nPhototaxis assays were carried out in a dark room with the countercurrent procedure as previously described (\nBenzer, 1967\n). After a 1-min equilibration period, groups of 10 flies in a long glass tube were given 1 min to move toward a white light source in an otherwise dark room. At the end of the assay, the number of responsive flies was counted. The results were the mean of the responsive flies from five groups per genotype.\nThe walking optomotor assay was conducted using a previously described method (\nRendahl et al., 1992\n;\nZhu et al., 2009\n) with minor modifications. An LED panel was put in the front of a clear tube of 10 flies. Dark stripes against a bright background continuously drifted from left to right and then from right to left. Control flies move against the direction of the stripe motion, and will change direction of movement when the direction of the stripe motion is reversed. Fly performance was evaluated by counting the number of flies changing direction in response to the flipping of the stripe motion. The results were the mean of the responsive flies from five groups per genotype.\n\nGiant fiber system (GFS) recording\nA fly will jump to a variety of stimuli, including a rapid light-off stimulus. Giant fibers (GF) are command neurons that are activated by a light-off stimulus through the excitation of photoreceptors and evoke a stereotypical pattern of activity in the thoracic muscles, producing an escape jump. We recorded GF-driven muscle potentials and the response to a rapid light-off stimulation following a previously described method (\nThomas and Wyman, 1984\n). Briefly, flies were immobilized with thin strips of tape. The potentials in the dorsal longitudinal muscles (DLMs) were recorded to measure the output of the giant fiber pathway. The signal was amplified and recorded using a Warner IE210 intracellular electrometer. Ten flies were examined per genotype."

Diabetes was induced in adult male Wistar rats (250\u2013325\u00a0g, Charles River, UK) with freshly dissolved STZ (55\u00a0mg/kg in sterile saline, i.p.), administered following an overnight fast. Diabetes was verified 3\u00a0days post-STZ (OptimumPlus; MediSense, UK) and rats with blood glucose >\u00a015\u00a0mmol/l were classified as diabetic. STZ-diabetic and age-matched control rats were maintained for 4\u201312\u00a0weeks. For the minocycline-prevention study: rats were randomly allocated into one of four treatment groups (control-vehicle (\nn\n=\u00a08); control-minocycline (\nn\n=\u00a08); diabetic-vehicle (\nn\n=\u00a010); diabetic-minocycline (\nn\n=\u00a010)). Minocycline was administered by daily gavage rather than the intraperitoneal route to avoid deposition of minocycline in the peritoneal cavity, which has been associated with inflammatory lesions and variability in absorption (\nFagan et al., 2004\n). Treatment with minocycline 25\u00a0mg/kg, p.o or vehicle (water, p.o.) commenced 3\u00a0days post-STZ, and continued daily for the duration of the trial. Animals were monitored daily, weighed twice weekly and maintained for 8\u00a0weeks post-STZ. Body weight and blood glucose data are shown in\nTable\u00a01\n.\nTable\u00a01.\nDiabetic rats are significantly lighter and hyperglycaemic compared to age-matched nondiabetic control rats. Minocycline had no significant effect on body weight or terminal blood glucose levels of control or diabetic rats (note, 1/10 rats from the diabetic-vehicle group and 5/10 rats from the diabetic-minocycline group became normoglycaemic between 4 and 8\u00a0weeks post-STZ \u2014 their data was excluded from all analysis).

Rats were then anaesthetized with isoflurane (2% in oxygen) and, under sterile conditions, the left sciatic nerve was exposed at mid-thigh level. The sciatic nerve was crushed with the tips of watchmaker's forceps (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015\u00a0s) the wound was closed in layers and the animals recovered under observation. Dosing continued daily for a further 3\u00a0days, then rats were killed and ipsilateral and contralateral lumbar (L)4/5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were removed for cell culture and sciatic nerves removed for PCR 3\u00a0h post last dose of minocycline.\n\nNerve conduction velocity (NCV)\nOne day following the last dose of minocycline, rats were terminally anaesthetized with isoflurane (2\u20134% in oxygen) and electromyograms were recorded from plantar foot muscles on a Powerlab 4 with ABI Scope software in response to stimulation (1.5\u20135\u00a0V, 2\u00a0ms pulses, Powerlab 4) at the sciatic notch and Achilles tendon. The length of nerve between the two stimulus points was measured\nex vivo\n. Motor NCV was calculated using the latencies of compound M waves, and sensory NCV was calculated from H reflex latencies.\n\nTissue processing\nRats were killed by anaesthetic overdose and the L4/5 DRG, plantar surface of hindpaws and sciatic nerves were rapidly dissected and either snap frozen on dry ice, or post-fixed for 4\u00a0h in 4% paraformaldehyde (in 0.1\u00a0M phosphate buffer (PB)), cryoprotected (10\u201330% sucrose in 0.1\u00a0M\u00a0PB at 4\u00a0\u00b0C over 48\u00a0h), frozen in OCT-embedding medium (VWR, UK) and then stored at \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\nSensory neuron culture\nDissociated sensory neurons were prepared from DRG obtained from either L4/5 DRG or all vertebral levels of adult male Wistar rats (200\u2013250\u00a0g, Charles River, UK). Sensory neurons were prepared as previously described (\nGardiner et al., 2005\n). Neurons were then either seeded onto repeatedly freeze-heated longitudinal sections of sciatic nerve (\nFerguson and Muir, 2000\n) obtained from control or diabetic rats (8\u00a0week post-STZ) or onto laminin (2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml)-coated 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (VWR, UK; (\nGardiner et al., 2005\n)) and then treated with combinations of: active MMP-2 (100\u2013200\u00a0ng/ml); nerve growth factor (NGF; 10\u00a0ng/ml); and minocycline (1\u201350\u00a0\u03bcM) for 18\u201348\u00a0h. Media were removed for analysis using a commercial NGF ELISA kit (NGD E\nmax\nImmunoassay G7330, Promega UK). Sensory neurons were either lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5\u00a0M Tris, pH\u00a07.6, 0.2\u00a0M NaCl, 10\u00a0mM CaCl\n2\n, 1% Triton-X-100), or fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15\u00a0min at room temperature.\n\nGelatin zymography\nSciatic nerves were desheathed, homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5\u00a0M Tris, pH\u00a07.6, 0.2\u00a0M NaCl, 10\u00a0mM CaCl\n2\n, 1% Triton-X-100), and centrifuged (9000\ng\n, 30\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C) and the supernatant was collected. 20\u00a0\u03bcg of protein from the supernatant was separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (containing 4.13\u00a0mg/ml gelatin under non-reducing, non-denaturing conditions). SDS was removed by incubating gels in wash buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH\u00a07.6, 5\u00a0mM CaCl\n2\n, 1\u00a0\u03bcM ZnCl\n2\n, 2.5% Triton X-100) to renature enzymes. Gels were incubated in reaction buffer (wash buffer without detergent) for 72\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C to stimulate gelatinolysis, then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (0.1% diluted in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid) for 1\u00a0h, then destained (in 10% methanol and 1% acetic acid) until clear gelatinolytic bands appeared. Gels were dried using DryEase Min-gel drying system (Invitrogen, UK), scanned and semiquantitative densitometry was performed on raw digitized images using SigmaScan Pro5 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL). For visual clarity within figures, the images were converted to greyscale and inverted (Adobe Photoshop), so digested bands appear as black on a white background.\n\nReal-time PCR\nTotal RNA was extracted from sensory neuron cultures using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and from desheathed sciatic nerve of control and STZ-diabetic rats (4, 8 and 12\u00a0weeks post-STZ) using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was removed using the DNA-free kit (Ambion). Equal amounts of RNA were reverse transcribed using MMLV reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) and quantitative PCR was carried out using SYBR green (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were set up in 96 well plates and each sample was assayed in duplicate, with the inclusion of a no template control (no cDNA) for each primer set. Plates were cycled on an ABI 7300 real-time PCR machine: 55\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min, followed by 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, and 40\u00a0cycles of 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0s and 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min. Data were normalized to cyclophilin B (PPIB). All primer pairs (see\nTable\u00a02\n) were optimised at a 60\u00a0\u00b0C annealing temperature using traditional PCR prior to use in a real-time PCR system.\nTable\u00a02.\nForward and reverse primer sequences\n.

Transverse sciatic nerve sections (12\u00a0\u03bcm) were immunostained with a combination of anti-MMP-2 (1:2000; Abcam, UK) and anti-S100\u03b2 (1:500; Sigma, UK) overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Slides were washed in PBS-T and incubated with secondary antibodies (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and cyanine-3 (Cy-3)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:500)) for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Transverse sections of hindpaw skin (20\u00a0\u03bcm) were immunostained overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with anti-PGP9.5 (1:4000; AbD Serotec). Slides were washed and incubated with secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit Cy3; 1:1000) for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Cultured sensory neurons were immunostained overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with anti-\u03b2 (III)-tubulin (1:500; Sigma) and with then donkey anti-mouse FITC (1:200). Following incubation in secondary antibodies (all from Jackson ImmunoResearch), slides were washed and mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Labs, UK). Immunofluorescence was visualised using a Leica DMR fluorescence microscope, Hamamatsu camera and software or a Leica TCS SP5 AOB5 inverted confocal microscope using 100\u00d7/0.50 plan Flouotar objective and LASAF software.\n\nImage analysis\nFor analysis of neurite outgrowth, 20 randomly selected fields of view per well were used in order to calculate the percentage of neurite bearing cells (defined as neurons with neurites longer than 1.5 times the associated cell body diameter). Then, images of every neurite-bearing neuron in each Lab-Tek chamber, or on each individual sciatic nerve cryosection were acquired to calculate the length of the longest neurite and neurite density, using concentric ring analysis as previously described (\nGardiner et al., 2005\n) using SigmaScan software (SPSS, UK). Data represent means\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation from independent culture experiments.\nFor analysis of intraepidermal nerve fibre density, the number of PGP-9.5-immunoreactive nerve fibre profiles which crossed the dermis/epidermis border was counted from 5 randomly selected fields of view from at least 5 sections per animal. Fibres that branched within the epidermis were counted as a single IENF. The length of the epidermis was measured using SigmaScan software (SPSS, UK) and data are expressed as mean density of IENF per unit length of epidermis (IENF/mm)\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation (\nLauria et al., 2005\n).\nAnimals, tissues and cells were all analysed in a blinded fashion to prevent observer bias. Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software using t-tests or one- or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's Multiple Comparison Tests as appropriate for the data set."

    "Methods": "Experimental Animals\nAll procedures met national guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals, and all experimental protocols were approved by the VCU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Both rats and mice subjects were utilized. Male Sprague Dawley rats (300\u2013350 g; Harlan Laboratories) were housed in pairs under a temperature (22\u00b0C) and humidity controlled environment with food and water\nad libitum\n, and subjected to a 12 hour dark-light cycle. Rats were subjected to unilateral entorhinal lesioned (UEC; n=62) and randomly assigned to subgroups which were evaluated at 1\u20137d postinjury by either Western Blot (WB), immunohistochemistry (IHC), qRT-PCR,\nin situ\nhybridization (ISH) or gelatin zymography methods. For the minocycline experiments, rats were randomly assigned to lesioned saline-treated or lesioned drug-treated groups, and evaluated at 2d postinjury by either WB or IHC (n=16). For all analyses, the matched contralateral uninjured brain region served as control.\nA second set of experiments used male WT C57BL/6J or OPN KO mice (B6.129S6 (Cg)-Spp1\ntm1Blh\n/J) (20\u201330 g; 8\u201311 weeks old; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) housed under the same environmental conditions as rat subjects. For molecular assessments, WT or OPN KO mice were randomly selected, subjected to UEC, and evaluated at 2d postinjury by WB, IHC, or gelatin zymography (n=40 each strain; total n= 80). For behavioral analysis, WT and OPN KO mice were randomly assigned to an uninjured or UEC group and evaluated using the novel object recognition (NOR) task at 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28d postinjury before being sacrificed (n=48). For molecular analyses, the matched contralateral uninjured brain region served as control for UEC lesion effects, and WT versus OPN KO compared for experimental effect. Uninjured mice served as controls for NOR behavioral analyses.\n\nUnilateral Entorhinal Cortex Lesion: Rat and Mouse\nThe rat UEC protocol was a modification of that described by\nLoesche and Steward (1977)\n. Rats were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in carrier gas of 70% N\n2\nO, 30% O\n2\nfor 4 min, heads shaved, then maintained on 2% isoflurane in carrier gas of 70% N\n2\nO, 30% O\n2\ndelivered via nose cone during surgery. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C by heating pad (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), and heart rate (bpm), arterial oxygen saturation (percent O\n2\n), breath rate (brpm), pulse/breath distention (\u00b5m) were monitored by pulse oximetry (MouseOx; Starr Life Sciences, Oakmont, PA). Anesthetized rats were secured in a stereotaxic device, a midline incision and 2 mm craniectomy performed to visualize intact dura mater above the right entorhinal cortex (EC). Electrolytic lesions were delivered through Teflon\u00ae-coated wire penetrating the dura and transmitting 1.5 mA for 40 s to 8 stereotaxic coordinates: 10\u00b0 lateral to perpendicular; 1.5 mm rostral to the transverse sinus; 3 and 4 mm lateral to the midline at 6, 4, and 2 mm ventral to the brain surface; and a third, 5 mm lateral at 4 and 2 mm ventral to the brain surface. After lesion, electrode was removed, incision sutured and topical anesthetic/antibiotic applied. Animals were housed singly in a warm chamber during post-operative recovery and monitored for discomfort or distress before being returned to home cages.\nThe mouse UEC protocol was a modification of the\nHardman et al., method (1997)\n. Mice were anesthetized, body temperature maintained and vital physiology monitored as described for rat subjects. Under anesthesia, mice were secured in a stereotaxic device and dura mater above the right EC exposed. Electrolytic lesions were delivered by Teflon\u00ae-coated wire penetrating the dura and transmitting 2.0 mA for 15 s to 3 coordinates: 10\u00b0 lateral to perpendicular; 0.5 mm rostral to the lamdoidal suture; 2 and 3 mm lateral to the midline at 3.5 mm ventral to the brain surface; and 3.5 mm lateral at 3.0 mm ventral to the brain surface. As for rats, electrode was removed, incision closed, anesthetic/antibiotic applied, and mice monitored prior to returning to home cages.\n\nAdministration of Minocycline\nPostinjury immune response was blunted using the tricyclic antibiotic minocycline. Selected rats received two acute minocycline doses (Sigma-Aldrich, Co., St. Louis, MO) of 45 mg/kg i.p., administered at 30 min and 6 h after UEC, a paradigm previously shown to induce immunosuppression (Homsi et al., 2009). Control animals underwent the same procedure but received saline vehicle.\n\nProtein Extraction\nSelected animals were anaesthetized with 4% isoflurane in carrier gas of 70% N\n2\nO, 30% O\n2\nfor 4 min, then sacrificed by decapitation at 1, 2, 4, or 7d after UEC, with whole hippocampus and molecular layer (ML) dissected (n=4/group) for assessment of protein expression. In the minocycline experiments, rats were sacrificed at 2d postinjury and hippocampi dissected (n=4 each saline and minocycline treated). Tissue samples were homogenized on ice in 125 \u00b5l of T-PER (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL), and centrifuged at 8,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatant was aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Prior to Western blot (WB), or zymography analysis, protein concentration was determined using Thermo Scientific Pierce Protein Assay Reagent (Rockford, IL) and the FLUOstar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech, Inc., Durham, NC).\n\nWestern Blot\nWB analysis was carried out utilizing Bio-Rad products (Hercules, CA). Twenty \u00b5g of protein were prepared for WB with XT sample buffer and reducing buffer, then denatured. Samples were electrophoresed on 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Criterion XT gels (200 V \u00d7 45 min) and protein transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Post-blot gels were stained with 0.1% coomassie brilliant blue (40% methanol (MeOH), 10% glacial acetic acid), then destained at RT to confirm even transfer. To prevent non-specific binding, membranes were blocked in 5% milk Tris-Buffered Saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (mTBST). Blots were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in mTBST with individual primary antibodies (goat anti-OPN 1:200, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; rabbit anti-OPN 1:500, Rockland Immunochemicals Inc., Gilbertsville, PA; rabbit anti-MAP1b 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX; mouse anti-N-cadherin 1:1000, B D Transduction Labs, San Jose, CA; goat anti-synapsin-1a/b 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX; rabbit anti-LCN2 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX). The region of each blot below 25kD was probed with rabbit anti-cyclophilin A (1:2,500, Millipore, Billerica, MA) as loading control. Blots were next washed with mTBST and incubated with appropriate secondary in mTBST (1:10,000 goat anti-mouse, Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA; 1:20,000 bovine anti-rabbit, 1:20,000 bovine anti-goat Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, TX) at RT for 1 h. Finally, blots were TBST washed and incubated with Super Signal Dura West chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) for signal detection. WB images were captured with Syngene G:Box and positive band signal subjected to densitometric analysis (relative optical density, ROD) with Gene Tools software (Syngene, Frederick, MD). Protein data were expressed as either fold change over controls or percent change relative to paired control cases run on same blot membrane.\n\nGelatin Zymography\nTwenty \u00b5g of protein from 2d hippocampal extracts described above were prepared with 2x Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer then separated by gelatin electrophoresis at 4\u00b0C on Novex\u00ae 10% zymogram gels (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Gels were renatured in Novex\u00ae Zymogram Renaturing Buffer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) at RT before development in Novex\u00ae Zymogram Developing Buffer over 6 d at 37\u00b0C. Gelatin lysis was visualized with coomassie brilliant blue and purified enzyme run as positive control. Zymogram signal was inverted and captured on Syngene G:Box, and densitometry analyzed as ROD with Gene Tools software (Syngene, Frederick, MD). Enzyme activity was expressed as percent change relative to paired controls run on the same gel.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAt 1 and 2d after UEC (n=4/group), rats were prepared for fluorescent immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis according to published protocol (\nWarren et al., 2012\n). Animals were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (90 mg/kg, i.p.), transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M NaHPO\n4\n, pH=7.4, after which brains were extracted and placed in fixative for 24 h before transfer to 0.03% NaN\n3\nin 1.0 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS). For IHC, brains were blocked at the dentate gyrus and 40 \u00b5m coronal sections were sliced using the VT1000S microtome (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL). To prevent non-specific binding, sections were blocked in Blotto (5% Cold Water Fish Skin Gelatin, Aurion, Netherlands, 0.5% Triton in 1.0 M PBS) for 30 min prior to overnight incubation with Blotto containing primary antibody (mouse anti-OPN MPIIIB10 1:300, Iowa Hybridoma, Iowa City, IA; rabbit anti-IBA1 1:300, Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA; rabbit anti-GFAP 1:20,000, Dako, Carpinteria, CA; goat anti-synapsin-1a/b 1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX). The next day, free floating tissue sections were washed with PBS, blocked in Blotto at RT, then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 or 594, 1:1,000, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) in Blotto for 1 h at RT. Sections were then PBS washed, equilibrated in phosphate buffer, and mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). IHC signal was visualized on the TCS-SP2 AOBS (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL) or LSM 700 (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) confocal microscope.\n\nqRT-PCR\nAt 1 or 2d after UEC, selected rats were anesthetized, decapitated, and whole hippocampi or ML fractions dissected (n=10/group). Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol\u00ae (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) then processed for OPN gene assessment utilizing Qc analysis and qRT-PCR with TaqMan\u00ae Assay Reagents (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Probes and primer sets for detection of OPN (Rn00582114m1) were obtained from Inventoried Assays (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Probes were labeled at the 5\u2019 end with 6-carboxyfluorescein and with a dark quencher at the 3\u2019 end. Efficiency was determined with 10-fold serial dilutions of template and cyclophilin A was used as an endogenous control (Pre-developed TaqMan\u00ae Assay Reagents; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Experiments were performed in the ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System using the TaqMan\u00ae One-Step PCR Master Mix Reagents Kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Samples were tested in triplicate under cycling conditions (48\u00b0C/30min, 95\u00b0C/10 min; 40 cycles 95\u00b0C/15 sec, and 60\u00b0C/1 min). Fold change in OPN mRNA was calculated by the 2\u2212\n\u0394\u0394Ct\nmethod (\nDumur et al., 2009\n).\n\nIn Situ\nHybridization\nSense and antisense probes were generated against full length OPN (Spp1, MRN1768-202780755) and synaptobrevin (Vamp1, MRN1768-202782932), the latter used as a positive control (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Riboprobes were synthesized using digoxigenin (DIG)-tagged dNTPs (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and the MAXIscript\u00ae in Vitro Transcription Kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), after which they were hydrolyzed to ~500nt as previously described (\nSu et al., 2010\n). Selected 40 \u00b5m coronal sections from 2d postinjury animals and controls (n=3/group) used for IHC studies were again mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), then hybridized at 65\u00b0C as previously described (\nYamagata et al., 2002\n). Bound riboprobes were detected by horseradish peroxidase (POD)-conjugated anti-DIG and fluorescent Cy3 staining with Tyramide Signal Amplification (TSA) systems (PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT). For fluorescent ISH and antibody co-labeling, standard IHC was performed following the TSA step. ISH/IHC signal was visualized using the TCS-SP2 AOBS (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL) confocal microscope.\n\nGenotype Confirmation and Protein Ablation Verification for KO Mice\nConfirmation of transgenic OPN KO was assessed utilizing the PCR-verification method of the Jackson laboratory to test for presence of the neo\nr\ncassette replacing exons 4\u20137 of the OPN gene, responsible for creating a null mutation, and rendering the animal incapable of producing an OPN transcript in B6.129S6 (Cg)-\nSpp1\ntm1Blh\n/J mice (\nLiaw et al., 1998\n). Genomic DNA was isolated from 1cm of tail snips, and genotyping confirmed utilizing the oIMR8444 primer \u20185GCC TGA AGA ACG AGA TCA GC3\u2019 for OPN and HotSHOT method (\nTruett et al., 2000\n;\nSu et al., 2010\n). To confirm the absence of OPN gene product in these animals, protein expression in the injured hippocampus was assessed. OPN KO and WT hippocampal protein extracts from mice subjected to UEC were analyzed by WB as described above, using goat anti-OPN (0.25 \u00b5g/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).\n\nNovel Object Recognition\nCognitive performance was assessed using a modified novel object recognition (NOR) test based on previous studies (\nEnnaceur and Delacour, 1988\n;\nHan et al., 2011\n;\nBaratz et al., 2011\n;\nSiopi et al., 2012\n). The NOR apparatus consists of a 42 \u00d7 42 \u00d7 30 cm\n3\nopen field arena under red light illumination (1 lux at mouse height) in a sound-isolated room (\nFuller et al., 2012\n). The NOR task consists of three phases: habituation, familiarization, and testing. During habituation (3, 6, 13, 20, 27d postinjury), UEC (C57BL/6 n=12, OPN KO n=9) or uninjured (C57BL/6 n=12, OPN KO n=12) mice were acquainted with the black opaque plastic testing chamber for two nonconsecutive 5 min intervals. Twenty four hours later, animals started the familiarization phase in the same chamber and were allowed to explore two identical objects: 50-mL conical plastic tubes affixed to the floor with Velcro\u00ae tape in symmetrical positions within the chamber. After a 1h delay, the animals entered the testing phase (4, 7, 14, 21, 28d postinjury) and returned to the chamber where one of the objects was replaced by a new object: a Lego\u00ae DUPLO\u00ae configuration of similar material and dimensions (h \u00d7 w), but differing in shape from that of the conical tube. Time spent exploring each object during both the familiarization and testing phases was recorded at one min periods with an overhead video camera, and later scored. Object exploration was operationally defined as object touching, or orienting behaviors (sniffing, rearing, or head orientation) occurring within 2 cm of the object. Sitting on top of or circling was not counted. To prevent olfaction distraction or bias, the chamber and objects were thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials. To avoid confounding effects of long term memory, a different novel object configuration was presented during each progressive trial. Results of the testing phase are represented by recognition index (RI=time spent with novel object/(time spent with familiar object+time spent with novel object) \u00d7 100). RI score of 50 represents a chance level of performance (no object preference) and RI significantly greater than 50 indicates an intact memory capacity for this task. Similar to previous reports (Meunier et al., 2013); a small percentage of mice did not explore either object, but engaged in unrelated behaviors (e.g., grooming or freezing). As determined with these earlier studies, no RI can be calculated from such behavior and mice which exhibited the non explorer pattern for greater than 50% of the recorded time (n=2 WT and n=5 OPN KO) were excluded prior to data analysis.\n\nStatistical Analyses\nChanges in rat protein or RNA levels, due to injury or minocycline treatment, were evaluated using the General Linear Model (GLM) in SPSS v.11. The time course of changes in OPN protein and transcript after UEC injury was assessed using a mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) with hemisphere (contralateral vs. ipsilateral to injury) as a within-subjects variable, and day postinjury as a between-subjects measure. The significance of changes at specific postinjury days was evaluated as\na priori\nplanned comparisons using simple-main effects based on marginal means, and implemented using multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) routines in SPSS.\nFor the mice studies, changes in protein levels or enzyme activity, induced by injury or associated with genetic strain, were evaluated using GLM in SPSS v.11. These alterations were assessed using a mixed model ANOVA with hemisphere (contralateral vs. ipsilateral to injury) as a within-subjects variable, and strain as a between-subjects measure, and specific pairwise comparisons evaluated as simple main effects. The effects of strain and UEC injury on NOR behavioral performance, was evaluated with a completely randomized ANOVA design followed by Duncan post-hoc tests. Both rat and mouse results are reported as mean +/\u2212 SEM. An alpha level of 0.05 was used in all analyses."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of the participating institutions. C57BL/6J mice were housed in a12:12 light/dark cycle with food and water supplied ad libitum. All mice were adults (70\u2013103 days of age) and were gonadally intact in order to identify sex differences that exist under normal, physiological conditions.\n\nBrain Dissections\nMice were sacrificed by CO\n2\ninhalation and the brain rapidly removed. Regions of interest were dissected under a microscope on an ice-cold slide. Two coronal cuts were made to obtain the BNST/POA: one just anterior to the optic chiasm and the second at the point where the optic tract enters the brain. Within this slab the BNST/POA was defined as the region just ventral to the lateral ventricle to about 1 mm ventral of the anterior commissure, bounded laterally by the medial edge of the internal capsule. For prefrontal cortex, samples were collected from a 2 mm thick transverse slab immediately caudal to the olfactory bulbs and rostral to the genu of the corpus callosum by dissecting the tissue between the left and right forceps minor of the corpus callosum. Dissected tissue was immediately placed on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until processing.\n\nChromatin Immunoprecipitation and Deep Sequencing (ChIP-seq)\nTo prepare the chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) library, three male and three female samples were processed; each sample was an independent replicate, comprised of the BNST/POA pooled from four same-sex animals. Samples were homogenized in ice-cold douncing buffer (DB) [10 mM Tris-Cl [pH 7.5]/4 mM MgCl\n2\n/1 mM CaCl\n2\n], then digested into mononucleosomes by incubation with 5 ul of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 7 min at 37 \u00b0C. Reaction was stopped with 30 ul of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8). Nuclei were lysed after the addition of hypotonisation buffer (0.2 mM EDTA, 0.1mM Benzamidin, 0.1mM PMSF, and 1 mM DTT). Samples were pre-cleared with protein G agarose, and incubated with anti-H3K4me3 antibody (rabbit polyclonal, Millipore, #07\u2013473) and ChIP dilution buffer (50 mM EDTA, 200 mM Tris and 500 mM NaCl) for 16 h at 4 \u00b0C under rotation. The antibody-DNA complexes were bound to protein G agarose beads, and the beads were washed with low salt, high salt, lithium chloride, and TE buffers. The antibody-DNA complexes were eluted from the beads, and incubated with Proteinase K for protein digestion. DNA was then eluted and purified by phenol-chloroform extraction.\nThe ChIP-seq library was prepared as previously (\nCheung et al., 2010\n). The ChIPed DNA was end-blunted using the End-it DNA Repair kit (Epicentre) and A-tailed by using the exo-Klenow DNA polymerase (Epicentre). Genomic adaptor oligos were added to the ChIPed DNA by using the Fast-Link kit (Epicentre), and the products were PCR amplified. A region of ~250 bps containing the expected DNA fragment of 150 bp mononucleosomal ChIPed-DNA and 100 bp adaptors was gel-extracted and DNA purified using PCR purification kits (Qiagen). Libraries were sequenced using Genome Analyzer II (Illumina).\n\nBioinformatical Analyses\nQuality control on the raw sequence reads was performed using FastQC software v0.10.0 (\nhttp://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/\n). Single end sequencing reads (36 bp) generated from ChIP-seq experiments were aligned to the July 2007 assembly of the mouse genome (UCSC version mm9, NCBI37) using Bowtie (version 0.12.8) (Langmead et al., 2009) to determine the total number of reads per library, as well as the number of uniquely-mappable reads. At most two mismatches in the seed sequence were allowed. Only uniquely mapped reads were kept for the subsequent peak-calling step. For one of the ChIPed female samples, the number of reads was significantly lower than for all others and this sample was excluded from the further analysis. An average of 97.94% of the reads were aligned with the five raw read sequences files F1, F2, M1, M2, M3. Detailed statistics are presented in\nTable 1\n.\nTable 1.\nSequencing statistics for samples used in the current study\nSample ID\nTotal Reads\nUnique Reads\nAlignment Percentage\nNumber of Peaks Returned by Peak Caller\nF1\n16741602\n16458175\n98.31%\n22431\nF2\n20416450\n20037137\n98.14%\n24726\nM1\n23778978\n23042614\n96.90%\n26463\nM2\n18474257\n17971304\n97.28%\n24023\nM3\n23863392\n22868641\n95.83%\n25921\nOpen in a new tab\nEnriched methylation signals of H3K4me3 were analyzed using the R statistical programming environment (R Core Team, 2012). Significant peaks of tag binding were determined using the iSeq program (Mo, 2012) and differential binding analysis between male and female samples was carried out with the DESeq Bioconductor package (\nAnders and Huber, 2010\n). Genes/loci of interest were initially identified as those with at least a 1.2-fold sex difference in H3K4me3 at any location throughout the gene length. Separate analyses were then run further restricting this list based on a range of p-value thresholds (p \u22640.1; p \u22640.05; p \u22640.01) for individual genes. The pattern of results was very similar regardless of p-value cutoff and the data presented below are presented for p \u22640.01.\nFor the graphical presentation of composite male and female peaks as in\nFigure 1\n, the two female and three male libraries were merged, and \u201cbedGraph\u201d files were generated (via BEDtools, version 2.17.0). This allowed visualization of the genomic distribution of H3K4me3 peaks in BedGraph format, averaged across all male and all female samples.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nH3K4me3 profiles for autosomal (\nCreb1, Syt4\n) and X-linked (\nKdm5c, Eif2sx\n,\nXist\n) genes shown separately for female and male BNST/POA, as indicated. UCSC genome browser tracks for female and male samples were averaged to create a composite peak within each sex. Note the sharp regulation of H3K4me3 around gene transcription start sites.\n\nReal-time RT-PCR\nFor gene expression analysis, BNST/POA and prefrontal cortex samples were obtained from a new cohort of animals. Dissections from four animals were pooled for each sample. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (QIAGEN, #74804). RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit. cDNA was then amplified using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied BioSystems). Primer sequences used are given in\nTable 2\nand analysis and quantification were performed as in Huang et al., 2006.

    "Methods": "Animals\nSix hypocretin/ataxin-3 transgenic (TG) narcoleptic mice from the congenic line (N13-15, backcrossed to C57BL/6) and 6 respective wild type (WT) littermates were used. We also collected the sleep EEG and PZT signals simultaneously in 4 WT mice (a total of 8999 ten-second epochs for 4 mice) and used this to analyze the agreement of the auto-PZT sleep/wake scoring with EEG/EMG-based sleep/wake scoring and the viability for using the PZT system to detect REM sleep. In a separate session, 6 TG narcoleptic mice were videotaped to evaluate the sensitivity of the PZT system to detect cataplexy-like behavior in narcoleptic mice. Mice were maintained on a stable light cycle of 12 hour light and 12 hour dark (LD 12:12). Room temperature was maintained at 24 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C throughout experimentation. The study was approved by and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Stanford University Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care and the Akita University Institutional Committee for Animal Studies.\n\nPZT data collection\nThe PZT system (ATC-402, Unique Medical Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) consists of a cage and a floor equipped with a heater. The PZT-sensor was used for sleep monitoring (\nFigs. 1A\u2013D\n). The PZT sensor consists of an upper sensor plate (95 \u00d7 165 mm) and a lower heater plate, which were combined with 6 small spacers (5 mm tall) placed around the corners of the plates. The sensor plate was made of a 3-mm thick aluminum plate and had a PZT element [disk shaped, 27-mm outer diameter (OD), EE27A-39A, FDK Corporation, Tokyo, Japan], which was adhered to the undersurface of the plate. The PZT surface temperature was set at 31.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C by controlling the heater plate. PZT signals were amplified with a DC amplifier (0\u201310 kHz) and stored by using the data acquisition software developed by one of the authors (NH) via an AD converter (ADA16-32/2(CB)F; CONTEC Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) at a sampling rate of 512 Hz. The heartbeat signals were analyzed using the output signal with high pass (280 Hz) and low pass (1 kHz) filters equipped in ATC-402.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nPiezoelectric transducer (PZT) system. A: Sensor device, B: piezoelectric (PZT) element, C: the main unit, and D: appearance of the cage with a PZT sensor.\nMice were placed on the PZT-sensor for 3 h during the light period (from zeitgeber time [ZT] 2 to 5). For the developmental experiments, the recordings of the mice were repeated on 14, 28, 56, 84 and 98 days after birth.\n\nSurgery for simultaneous EEG and PZT sleep recording\nIn a separate session, we also recorded the EEG sleep and PZT signals simultaneously using 4 WT mice. The mice were surgically prepared for EEG and EMG recordings with a headstage attached to a cable recorder (\nFujiki et al., 2009\n). Under 3% isoflurane anesthesia, 2 of 4 electrodes for the EEG (stainless steel screws) were screwed into the skull 1.5 mm lateral and 1.5 mm anterior to the bregma (over the motor cortex); the other 2 were screwed 3 mm lateral and 1 mm anterior to the lambda (over the visual cortex), and 2 EMG electrodes (multistranded stainless steel wires) were inserted into the neck extensor muscle. The 6 leads for these electrodes were attached to one 2 \u00d7 3 pin header that was secured to the skull using dental acrylic.\nAfter surgery, surgical wounds, animal behaviors, and body weight were monitored, with an analgesic (carprofen) and an antibiotic (enrofloxacin) supplied as needed. Mice were allowed to fully recover for a minimum of 2 weeks before the experiments.\n\nSimultaneous EEG and PZT data collection\nAfter 2 weeks of recovery period from the surgery, the mice were moved to the PZT system covered with a specially modified Nalgene microisolator cage equipped with a low-torque slip-ring commutator (Biella Engineering, Irvine, CA), and the cage was placed in the PZT-equipped recording chamber. The headstage of the animal was connected to a slip ring commutator through 15 to 20 cm of a lightweight 6-strand shielded signal cable (NMUF6/30-4046SJ; Cooner Wire, Chatsworth, CA). The commutator output was connected to the amplifier. The animals were allowed full freedom of movement in the recording cages. The EEG\u2013EMG signals were acquired using Grass Instruments (West Warwick, RI) model 12 amplifiers. The EEG and EMG signals, digitally filtered (30 Hz low pass filter for EEG; 10\u2013100 Hz band pass filter for EMG), were captured at 256 Hz using the data acquisition software developed by one of the authors (NH). EEG signals collected with ipsilateral bipolar EEG electrodes placed over motor and visual cortices together with the bipolar EMG signals were used for sleep scoring. We started the experiment at ZT = 2 and recorded the data for 6\u20137 h for each animal and the total recording time was 25 h (8999 ten-second epochs).\n\nSleep scoring by PZT signals\nFirst, the whole recorded signals were statistically analyzed, which yielded the averaged levels and the standard deviations. Subsequently, the absolute value of the difference from the averaged level was examined on each sampled data of every one second epoch. The epoch was marked as wake when the signal amplitude exceeded one standard deviation from the mean calculated from the whole recorded signal (\nFig. 2A\n). The period between wake epochs was considered as resting (wake without movement) and also marked as wake when the period length was less than 20 s. After that, the consecutive epochs with the same state were chosen as a single bout. Wake bouts of less than 10 s were considered as noise or immature, transitional states and therefore were marked as a continuous sleep bout. Lastly, all the one-second epochs were cast into 10-second epochs for comparison with the visual score by the human scorer. Each 10-second epoch was marked as wake when it contained five or more one-second wake epochs.\nFig. 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nPiezoelectric (PZT) signals. A: Large amplitude signals appear during movement (wake) while very little amplitude appears during rest (sleep). B: Both (a) ordinary resting (non-IMHB) and (b) IMHB show lower amplitude than movement period but IMHB is characterized by the appearance of heartbeat (heart sound) signals. C: (a) IMHBs: Sudden onset and large movement followed by IMHB. No fewer than 40 s of movement period must exist before IMHBs. (b) IMHBg: Gradual onset IMHB. Fewer than 40 s of movement period before IMHBg.\n\nSleep scoring by sleep polygraph signals\nWe visually scored the sleep stages based on EEG and EMG signals in 10-second epochs using our standard scoring criteria using SleepSign (Kissei America, Irvine, CA, USA). Fifty percent or more of a particular state in each epoch is required to score the epoch as that state. Briefly, wakefulness is characterized by a desynchronized, low-amplitude, mixed-frequency (>4 Hz) EEG and high EMG activity. Rhythmic theta/ alpha (7\u20139 Hz) waves with high EMG activities may also appear. NREM is characterized by a synchronized, high-amplitude, low-frequency (0.25\u20134 Hz) EEG and reduced EMG activity compared to wakefulness. EEG activity in REM sleep is similar to that in wakefulness with desynchronized, mixed-frequency, low-amplitude waves. EMG activity during REM sleep is reduced even further than that during NREM and is completely absent in many cases. Some muscle twitching may be apparent in the EMG trace during REM sleep. During the REM sleep, rhythmic theta/alpha (7\u20139 Hz) waves with reduced EMG activity may be dominant, but not necessarily, as has been shown in other species (\nKushida et al., 1985\n;\nRechtschaffen and K.A., 1968\n). Sleep state changes were recorded when at least one 10-second epoch was scored as having a different sleep stage, and state episode length was defined as the length of a continuous single state episode. All scoring was done by a single investigator (YS), blind to the animal information.\nTo determine the concordance rate of the result of the autoscored PZT signal and that of manually scored EEG, we collected the EEG sleep and PZT signals simultaneously in 4 WT mice.\n\nImmobile with heartbeat (IMHB) signal analysis\nSince PZT is very sensitive in detecting movements, we tried to identify the PZT signals corresponding to cataplexy. We observed that resting (sleep) PZT patterns most often occur during behavioral cataplexy, and more systematically examined resting (sleep) PZT periods, in relation to cataplexy. We found two different patterns of PZT signals during resting (sleep) periods. One is an ordinary resting pattern (\nFig. 2B(a)\n), while the other is a unique PZT signal pattern characterized by no movement signal (resting), but with clear heartbeat signals (\nFig. 2B(b)\n). We named the latter pattern as \u201cepisodes of immobility with heartbeat (IMHB) signal\u201d. Heartbeat signals can be detected when a mouse is flaccid and a larger part of the body is closely attached to the floor (i.e., PZT sensor). We therefore created manual scoring criteria for IMHB and scored IMHB episodes and recorded the start and the end time of each IMHB episode. The data was used to calculate the frequency of appearance and distribution of IMHB across ages and between genotypes. All scoring was done blind to the genotype information.\n\nScoring criteria for IMHB and IMHB subtypes\nResting state is defined as the state with lower PZT signal power than that for movement state (see the Sleep scoring by PZT signals section). IMHB signals are characterized by the appearance of heartbeat signals, and the amplitudes of heartbeat signals are more than twice as large as the resting PZT signals. Heartbeat signals (the combination of S1 and S2 heart sounds) appear at a rate of 8\u201312 beats per second (480\u2013720 bpm).\nIMHB signals are divided into a gradual onset type (IMHBg) and a sudden onset type (IMHBs, wake preceding 40 s) (\nFig. 2C(a)\n). Consistent with the definition of direct transitions from wakefulness to REM sleep (DREM) (\nFujiki et al., 2009\n), PZT signals show no fewer than 40 s of movement period before IMHBs. On the other hand, IMHBg is defined as the gradual onset of IMHB (\nFig. 2C(b)\n). Less than 40 s of movement period is followed by IMHBg.\n\nVideo monitoring of behavioral cataplexy and IMHBs\nTo evaluate the sensitivity for detecting behavioral cataplexy using the PZT system, the mice were videotaped simultaneously with the PZT recording for 4 h. All instances of behavioral cataplexy were recorded by video monitoring (by SK). Cataplexy was defined as a sudden onset of behavioral arrest or muscle atonia. Each instance was considered a case of behavioral cataplexy if the mouse showed at least 5 s of no movement, and the starting and the ending time of each episode were recorded. The mouse occasionally moved during cataplexy, and if such motion lasted for less than 10 s, we recorded the episode as a single bout. In the second half of the process, we visually scored PZT signals for each cataplexy episode (as IMHBg, IMHBs and non-IMHB) and calculated the sensitivity to detect behavioral cataplexy using the PZT signals (i.e. IMHBs). Moving was defined as episodes with large movement signals, and resting was defined as episodes with no movement that do not meet the IMHB scoring criteria. When longer than 5 s IMHBs episodes appeared during a single cataplexy episode, we assumed that cataplexy was detected by IMHBs.\n\nSensitivity and specificity of IMHBg for REM sleep detection\nTo evaluate the specificity and sensitivity for detecting REM sleep using the PZT system, the PZT signals of 4 WT mice in each 10-second epoch were (a total of 8999 epochs for 4 mice) visually classified into IMHBg, IMHBs and non-IMHB. These data were compared to EEG scoring results to obtain sensitivity and specificity values in detecting REM sleep by IMHBg.\n\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical significances of the wake and sleep amounts and the wake and sleep bout length in narcoleptic and WT mice were evaluated using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with genotype and age as the independent variables. The frequency of appearance and distribution of IMHB across ages and between genotypes were evaluated using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (K\u2013S) test for the distribution and the Wilcoxon test for the mean duration. Differences were considered to be significant when p < 0.05."

    "Methods": "All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the NINDS Animal Care and Use Committee. Every effort was made to minimize the number of animals used and their discomfort.\n\nSubjects and behavioral training\nMale Long-Evans rats (Taconic Farm, USA), weighing 250\u2013300 g were housed with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water in environmentally controlled conditions with a reversed 12:12hr light:dark cycle (lights on at 6 PM). All rats (n=13) received unilateral dopamine cell lesions as described below. Rats with electrodes implanted bilaterally in the SNpr (n=9) were used for lesioned hemisphere vs non-lesioned hemisphere comparisons of LFP spectral power, spike-LFP synchronization and dominant entrainment frequency across behavioral states and for assessment of motor deficits during treadmill walking before and after administration of drugs (see below). An additional group of rats (n=4) with the electrodes unilaterally implanted in the SNpr of the DA-lesioned hemisphere were used to explore the relationship between the expression of synchronized activity in the high beta/low gamma frequency range (25\u201340 Hz) in the SNpr and the extent of motor deficits over the course of 2 hours following administration of a therapeutic dose of L-dopa. During the week before surgery, rats were handled daily and trained to walk on a circular treadmill (\nAvila et al., 2010\n). Training consisted of 3\u20135 daily sessions during which rats were encouraged to walk for 5\u201310 min in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions at variable speeds with rest periods between walking epochs. At the end of the training, the rats were able to walk steadily in both directions at the speed of 9 RPM. After unilateral dopamine cell lesion, the hemiparkinsonian rats could make reasonable progress on the circular treadmill if they were oriented in the direction ipsiversive to the hemisphere with the dopamine cell lesion, with their affected paws on the outside of the circular path. They had significant difficulty walking in the direction contraversive to the lesion with their affected paws on the inside of the circular track.\n\nSurgical Procedures\nUnilateral lesion of the nigrostriatal pathway and implantation of electrodes for recording LFP and spikes and EMG electrodes were performed during the same surgery. Rats were anesthetized with 75 mg/kg ketamine (Ketaved, Vedco, St. Joseph, MO) and 0.5 mg/kg medetomidine HCl, administered i.p. (Dexdomitor, Pfizer Animal Health, New York, NY) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA) with heads fixed with atraumatic earbars. The incision area was shaved and a long acting local anesthetic (1%, Polocaine, APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC, Schaumberg, IL) was injected along the intended incision lines. Ophthalmic ointment (Lacrilube, Akorn, Inc., Lake Forest, IL) was applied to prevent corneal dehydration and lidocaine gel was placed in the ear canals. A heating pad was used to maintain body temperature at 37\u00b0C. Small supplemental doses of ketamine were administered during the surgery as needed.\nUnilateral lesion of the nigrostriatal pathway\nThirty minutes prior to intracerebral injections of 6-OHDA HBr ( Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO) into the left medial forebrain bundle to destroy the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway, desmethylimipramine HCl (15 mg/kg, i.p.) (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was administered to protect noradrenergic neurons. A hole was drilled in the skull at 4.4 mm anterior to the lambdoid suture, 1.2 mm lateral to sagittal suture. Six \u00b5g of 6-OHDA HBr in 3 \u00b5l of 0.9% saline with 0.01% ascorbic acid were infused via a 27 gauge stainless steel cannula into the medial forebrain bundle (8.3 mm ventral to the skull surface) at a rate of 1 \u00b5l/min over 3 min via a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). The cannula was left at the target site for 3 min after the infusion was completed. The efficacy of the dopaminergic lesion was assessed using the stepping test procedure at 5\u20137 days after the lesion (\nOlsson et al., 1995\n;\nSchallert and Tillerson, 1999\n). Rats were included in the study if they demonstrated a strong unilateral motor deficit (number of steps made by the contralateral limb <5% of steps made by the ipsilateral limbs) after the DA cell lesion.\nElectrode Implantation\nHoles were drilled in the skull over the target recording sites in the left and right hemispheres. Two electrode bundles were bilaterally implanted into the SNpr at coordinates: +3.2 mm anterior to the lambdoid suture, 2.2 mm lateral from the sagittal suture and 8.0 mm ventral from the skull surface. Bundles were secured to the skull with screws and dental cement (Ortho-Jet Liquid, Lang Dental Mfg. Co., Inc, Wheeling, IL) and ground wires from each set of electrodes were wrapped around a screw located above the cerebellum. Two electrode configurations were used for these experiments: bundles, consisting of 8 stainless steel teflon-insulated microwires plus an additional 9th wire with no insulation for ~1 mm on the recording tip serving as a local reference, and arrays, consisting of 9 stainless steel microwires arranged in a 3\u00d73 matrix with 200 \u00b5m between wires with the 9th reference wire at one corner of the array for recording from the larger area in the SNpr (NB Labs, Denison, TX, USA). Electrodes had impedances of ~0.6 M\u03a9, measured in physiological saline at 135 Hz, 9th wires had impedances of ~0.2\u20130.3 M\u03a9. All rats were also chronically implanted with bipolar EMG electrodes consisting of two stainless steel wires coated with Teflon (Cooner Wire, Chatsworth, CA). EMG electrodes were inserted into the left and right scapular head of the deltoid and secured to the muscle by sutures. After completion of surgeries, ketofluid was given subcutaneously (s.c.), and atipamezole HCl (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.; Antisedan, Pfizer Animal Health, New York, NY) was administered to reverse the sedative effect of medetomidine. Rats were retrained on the rotating treadmill on the 5th postoperative day.\n\nElectrophysiological recordings\nExtracellular multiunit and LFP recordings were obtained from the SNpr ipsilateral and contralateral to the nigrastriatal dopamine cell lesion (n=9). Recording sessions started on day 7 post-surgery and were conducted weekly for 5\u20138 weeks. Sessions consisted of two walking epochs (5\u201310 min each) and two rest epochs (5\u201310 min each). Recordings were typically made during ipsiversive walking in the treadmill at rotation speed of 9 RPM, which was compatible with a slow walking pace for the rat. In addition to walking in the direction ipsiversive to the lesioned hemisphere, data were collected during 5 additional behavioral states: episodes of spontaneous grooming, attentive rest (epochs during ongoing auditory stimulation, when rats were alert and not initiating movements other than whisking), inattentive rest (periods of rest when rats were not whisking or looking around but with eyes open), paradoxical sleep (REM, periods of sleep with twitching limbs or whisking, 2 rats) and under urethane anesthesia (1 g/kg, i.p.) with mild sensory stimulation (light stroking) on the last day of the recordings.\nData for comparisons between lesioned and non-lesioned hemispheres were obtained before and after drug administration at day 21\u201323 post lesion while rats were walking in the direction ipsiversive to the lesioned hemisphere. To assess motor deficits and the effects of drug treatment on gait, data were also collected when rats were walking in the direction contraversive to the lesioned hemisphere. For these studies, a range of treadmill speeds was used.\nExtracellular spike trains, LFPs, and bipolar EMGs were recorded using Plexon Inc. (Dallas, TX) and Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design, CED, Cambridge, UK) systems. Spikes and LFPs were referenced to the 9th wire in the SNpr from the same bundle or array. Sampling rates were 40 kHz for spikes and 1 kHz for LFPs and EMG. Action potentials were amplified (10,000X) and band-pass filtered (0.15\u20139 kHz). LFPs were amplified (1000X) and band-pass filtered (3\u2013170 Hz) and EMGs were amplified (1000X) and band-pass filtered (0.1\u20131 kHz). Discriminated spike signals, LFPs and EMG recordings were digitized, stored and analyzed using Spike2 data acquisition and analysis software (CED).\n\nDrug Administration\nDrugs (Sigma-Aldrich Co. St. Louise, MO) were dissolved in sterile saline and injected i.p. On day 21\u201323 post-lesion, rats were administered a therapeutic dose of L-dopa (5 mg/kg, supplemented with 15 mg/kg benserazide HCl). One group of rats were administered the D2 receptor antagonist eticlopride (0.2 mg/kg) 40\u201360 min after administration of L-dopa. Other rats received the serotonin (5HT) 1A specific receptor agonist (8-OH-DPAT, 0.2 mg/kg) 40 min after L-dopa, and after a subsequent 20 min, the 5HT-1A specific receptor antagonist (WAY-100635, 0.3 mg/kg).\n\nData Analysis\nIdentification of the epochs for analysis\nPeriods of LFP and spike recordings free of major artifacts were selected for analysis. EMG activity, direct observation, and videotaped motor behavior were used for selection of epochs representing different behavioral states. For spike-triggered waveform averages (STWA) and LFP power, epochs of 100 s were used during attentive rest (alert non-walking), walking, REM sleep and urethane anesthesia, and 40\u2013100 s epochs were used for inattentive rest and grooming. Epochs of 100 s were used to assess mean firing rates during walking. Walking epochs represent data taken when rats were walking on the circular treadmill in the direction ipsiversive to the lesioned hemisphere, unless otherwise indicated.\nSpectral analysis of LFPs\nLFP recordings were smoothed to 250 Hz and LFP power was analyzed by fast Fourier transform (FFT) with a frequency resolution of 1 Hz. Total power in 12\u201325 Hz (low beta) and 25\u201340 Hz (high beta/low gamma) and 45\u201360 Hz (gamma) frequency ranges was calculated using a Spike2 script. LFP power from two electrodes per bundle and two epochs for each behavioral condition were averaged, normalized by total power within the 70\u2013100 Hz range, and presented as the ratio of power in lesioned hemisphere versus power in non-lesioned hemisphere. In the experiments with L-dopa treatment and consecutive administration of other drugs, the alterations in total LFP spectral power in high beta/low gamma frequency range were evaluated before and after drug treatments while the rat was walking in the circular treadmill.\nTo visualize spectral power changes over time for the selected epochs, time-frequency wavelet spectra were constructed using continuous wavelet transforms. The Morlet wavelet was applied to the LFPs using 128 frequency scales and a time resolution of approximately 750 ms (Time-Frequency Toolbox,\nhttp:tftb.nongnu.org\n).\nEMG-LFP amplitude modulation\nRelationships between EMG from the shoulder muscle (scapular head of the deltoid) contralateral to the lesion and simultaneously recorded LFP were examined in 11 rats to assess amplitude modulation of 25\u201340 Hz SNpr oscillations in conjunction with motor activity. LFP recordings were band pass-filtered at 25\u201340 Hz, EMG and LFP signals were rectified and smoothed (time constant of 0.04 s). Waveform cross-correlations were calculated for four LFP channels per rat in the lesioned hemisphere paired with the contralateral EMG channel, using the EMG channel as the reference. Results were then averaged for each rat and then across the rats. Modulation in 25\u201340 Hz LFP amplitude was considered significantly correlated with EMG activity during treadmill walking if the peak and trough of the cross correlation centered around time 0 exceeded 3 standard deviations (SD) of the mean waveform amplitude from the \u22122.0 to \u22121.5 and 1.5 to 2.0 s segments of the cross correlation. A further comparison of relative changes in 25\u201340 Hz SNpr LFP power and contralateral EMG over the first 6 min of walking epochs was performed. Instantaneous RMS was obtained for 6 consequtive 1 min intervals of rectified EMG activity. SNpr LFP power from 4 channels over the same intervals was averaged per rat for 8 rats and the averaged across rats. A separate group of 6 non-lesioned rats were used for control data. The Pearson correlation coefficient was computed to assess change over time of SNpr LFP vs rectified EMG RMS.\nCell sorting\nFor rate and spike-triggered waveform average (STWA) peak-to-trough analysis, spikes were sorted offline using Spike2 algorithms and principal component analysis (PCA). To assess the effectiveness of the single cell sorting procedure, interspike interval histograms were generated and inspected to ensure that the first ms of the histogram, representing the refractory period, was free of spikes. For multiunit spike-triggered waveform averages, action potential waveforms on a given wire were discriminated as single units initially and then recombined to form a multiunit spike train typically consisting of 2\u20135 cells to reflect population activity.\nSNpr spike-LFP synchronization\nSTWAs were used to assess the degree of phase-locking (i.e. synchronization or entrainment) of the spiking activity to LFP oscillations. STWAs were generated from two 100 s epochs of single or multiunit spike trains and simultaneous LFP recordings (except during rest when epochs varied from 40 to 100s). LFPs were smoothed to 500 Hz and band-pass filtered at 12\u201345 Hz. STWAs were generated from epochs of spike and LFP recordings from the lesioned and non-lesioned hemisphere over the range of behaviors and the STWA peak-to-trough amplitude around time 0 was obtained. To determine the significance of the peak-to-trough value as a measure of spike-LFP synchronization, additional STWAs were generated from the same spike train after the spike train interspike intervals were shuffled. Each shuffled spike train was used to create another STWA. This process was repeated 20 times to obtain a set of 20 peak-to-trough amplitudes, which were averaged to provide a mean peak to trough amplitude and SD for the shuffled data.\nTo measure the extent of spike-LFP synchronization in a population of neurons, the ratio of the unshuffled spike train STWA peak-to-trough amplitude relative to the mean shuffled spike train STWA peak-to-trough amplitude was calculated. If there was no phase-locking in the unshuffled spike train, the ratio would be close to 1.\nAnother index of the extent of spike-LFP synchronization in a population of neurons calculated was the percentage of correlated neurons. This was obtained using only STWAs from spike trains sorted for single units. A spike train was considered to be significantly correlated with the LFP oscillation when the peak-to-trough amplitude of the unshuffled spike train STWA was greater than the mean \u00b1 3 SD of the 20 shuffled spike train peak-to-trough values.\nDominant multiunit spike-LFP entrainment frequency\nData from STWAs generated from multiunit spike trains was used to to estimate the frequency of the LFP oscillations to which the spike train was preferentially entrained. The STWA LFP oscillations triggered by the spikes from 4 multiunit trains per hemisphere over two 100 s epochs, or four 30 s epochs per behavioral state, were obtained. The dominant multiunit entrainment frequency was calculated as the reciprocal of the time between the successive peaks in the STWA closest to zero and averaged in order to identify the dominant entrainment frequency of LFP oscillatory activity in the 12\u201345 Hz frequency range for each rat and each behavioral state. For a subset of neurons, dominant spike-LFP entrainment frequencies were also obtained from STWA analysis of single unit data and from peak frequencies obtained from examination of the power spectra of the STWA waveforms (\nFries et al., 2001\n) to confirm accuracy of the multiunit approach.\nEffect of drug administration\nSTWAs were generated from 100 s single unit spike trains using LFPs filtered in the 25\u201340 Hz. Data were taken from epochs during treadmill walking before and following the administration of L-dopa and after consecutive administration of the 5HT-1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT and 5HT-1A receptor antagonist WAY-1000635 at day 21\u201323 post- lesion to obtain the percentage of SNpr neurons significantly phase-locked to the LFP activity and ratios of unshuffled to shuffled STWA peak-to-trough amplitudes. In addition, firing rates of the SNpr cells were determined to compare mean rate changes following L-dopa treatment and after administration of the 5HT1A receptor agonist and antagonist.\nMotor performance\nMotor activity was monitored online and videotaped for offline review. To quantify the motor performance of the intact and DA-depleted rats during epochs of walking in a circular treadmill, the number of steps made by each of the hindpaws, i.e. the paws toward the inside and the outside of the circular treadmill track, were counted during two 30 s epochs of walking in each direction. The count was taken at four treadmill rotation speeds ranging from 5 to 9 RPM. The ratio of steps made by the inside paw relative to steps made by the outside paw was calculated and averaged across the rotation speeds.\nStatistics\nData are reported as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Unless stated otherwise, statistical significance was evaluated with 1-way or 2-way repeated measures analysis of variance (RM ANOVA) with Student Newman-Keuls\npost hoc\ncomparison. If normality failed, Friedman RM ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s\npost hoc\ncomparison was used. Statistical analysis was performed using Sigma Plot software (SyStat Software, San Jose, CA). The criterion for significance was p<0.05.\n\nHistology and immunochemistry\nAfter recordings were completed, rats were initially lightly anesthetized with urethane (1.0 g/kg, i.p.) for recordings during sensory stimulation, and subsequently more deeply anesthetized (an additional 0.6 g/kg urethane, i.p.) and recording sites were marked by passing a positive current of 10 \u00b5A for 10 s via 2\u20133 microwires. Rats were perfused intracardially with 200 mL cold saline followed by 200 mL 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Brains were post-fixed in paraformaldehyde solution overnight and then immersed in 10% sucrose in phosphate buffered saline (0.1 M, pH 7.4). Coronal sections of 35 \u00b5m were collected in PBS. Sections for electrode placement verification were mounted on glass slides and stained with cresyl violet and 5% potassium ferricyanide/9% HCl to reveal the iron deposited at the electrode tips.\nTo assess the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc, a standard immunohistochemical protocol was used for staining tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in freely floating sections. Briefly, brain sections were washed 3 times in PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4) prior to incubation with rabbit polyclonal anti-TH antibody (1:200 dilution; Pel-Freez Biologicals, Rogers, AR) for 12\u201318 hr at room temperature, with moderate agitation. Sections were rinsed 3 times in PBS and incubated with secondary antibody biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1: 200 dilution; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After 1 h of incubation, sections were rinsed three times in PBS and incubated with avidin-biotin-perioxidase complex (ABC kit; Vector Laboratories) for 60 min, then rinsed in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and reacted with 0.05% 3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.01% H\n2\nO\n2\n(DAB kit, Vector Laboratories) for 2\u201310 min until intense staining emerged. Sections were washed in 50 mM Tris then mounted on slides, dehydrated, and prepared for light microscopy.\nThe extent of dopamine cell degeneration was assessed by examination and digitization of the image under the light microscope obtained with wide-field optics allowing simultaneous capture of both lesioned and non-lesioned hemispheres. The optical density values of TH fibers and neurons in the substantia nigra were measured (using ImageJ software, NIH) in anterior, middle, and posterior sections of the substantia nigra in the lesioned hemisphere and compared with density in homologous regions in the non-lesioned hemisphere. TH density in substantia nigra from the lesioned hemisphere was reduced by more than 88% (averaging 96.0\u00b11.5% reduction) relative to that in the non-lesioned hemisphere."

    "Methods": "EA2 knockin mice\nRecombineering methods and vectors from NCI-Frederick (\nhttp://ncifrederick.cancer.gov/research/brb/reagents/recombineeringReagent.aspx\n) were used to prepare the targeting construct. A C57BL/6 BAC clone was identified from the RPCI23 BAC library. RP23\u2013275N4, which encompassed exons 2\u201346 of mouse\nCacna1a\n, was confirmed by endonuclease restriction digest and diagnostic PCRs (not shown). The EA2-causing F1406C mutation was introduced into exon 26 by site-directed mutagenesis. The targeting vector also contained, a PGK-driven neomycin (neo\nr\n) cassette flanked by two loxP sites downstream of exon 26. C57BL/6-derived embryonic stem cells were electroporated with the targeting construct and clones were screened for homologous recombination by Southern blot. The presence of the c.4486T>G mutation was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of exon 26 with forward and reverse primers 5\u2019-GGAAACCAGAAGCTGAACCA-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-CCCTGAATTCCTCCATTTC-3\u2019, and endonuclease digestion of the PCR product with the enzyme\nBstAPI\n, or sequencing of the PCR product. Targeted ES cells were injected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. Mice with germline transmission were identified and long PCR from genomic DNA of F1 progeny was used as an additional screen to confirm homologous recombination of the targeting construct in the mice (\nFig. 1A\n). The 5\u2019 insertion site was verified by two reactions (P1-P2 and P1-P3) that used a common forward primer specific to the genomic DNA upstream of and outside of the 5\u2019 end of the construct, P1, 5\u2019-TCCTGCCCAGTACAGAGATTGA-3\u2019, and a reverse primer upstream of the neo\nr\n, P2, 5\u2019-GAATTCAAGCTTCACTGGGAGACTAG-3\u2019, and one specific to the neo\nr\n, P3, 5\u2019-AGGCCAGAGGCCACTTGTGTAG-3\u2019. The 3\u2019 insertion site was confirmed by two reactions (P4-P6 and P5-P6) that used a common reverse primer specific to the genomic DNA downstream and outside of the 3\u2019 end of the construct, P6, 5\u2019-CCCTAAACTTTTTCAGCCCAAAGG-3\u2019, and one forward primer specific to the neo\nr\n, P4, 5\u2019-GACGAGTTCTTCTGAGGGGATCAA-3\u2019, and one downstream of the neo\nr\n, P5, 5\u2019-GGAGGATCACCCTGAGTTTTGAGA-3\u2019. The PCR product of a short amplicon (325 bp) encompassing the c.4486T>G mutation was also sequenced, verifying that mice testing positive for the long PCR assay also carried the point mutation. Mice carrying the unresolved knockin allele were crossed with the Cre-deleter strain C57BL/6-Tg(Zp3-Cre)93Knw/J (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) to remove the neomycin cassette. Progeny carrying the resolved allele were crossed with C57BL/6J mice to segregate the Cre allele. These EA2 knockin mice, which were coisogenic with C57BL/6J, were bred and maintained on a C57BL/6J background. For subsequent genotyping of EA2 knockin mice, PCR amplicons were sequenced as above or quantitative PCR was used (not shown).\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nGeneration and molecular characterization of EA2 knockin mice. (A) The EA2 knockin construct contained a c.4486T>G substitution, coding a p.F1406C missense in exon 26 of\nCacna1a\nand a neomycin resistance cassette (neo\nr\n), flanked by two loxP sites, upstream of exon 27. The targeting construct was introduced into C57BL/6J\u2013derived ES cells via homologous recombination and cells carrying the construct were injected into blastocysts. (B) A series of PCRs from the DNA of F1 mice were used to verify correct homologous recombination. Reactions from primers P1 and P3 illustrate proper insertion of the 5\u2019 end of the construct and reactions from primers P4 and P6 verify 3\u2019 recombination. (C) DNA and mRNA sequences illustrate the presence of the c.4486T>G substitution in the PCR product of genomic DNA and RT-PCR product of brain mRNA from +/+ and EA2/EA2 mice. (D) Western blot shows the normal expression of Ca\nV\n2.1 in frontal cortex and cerebellum.\n\nOther mouse lines\nMice carrying a knockout\nCacna1a\nallele (+/\u2212) on a mixed C3H\u2013C57BL/6J background were kindly provided by Dr. David Yue (Johns Hopkins University). Mice carrying a floxed\nCacna1a\nallele (flox/+) on a C57BL/6J background were previously described (\nTodorov et al., 2006\n). Mice carrying the Tg(Pcp2-Cre)2Mpin/J (L7-Cre/-) transgene on a C57BL/6J background were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and were used to drive recombination specifically in PCs. Mice carrying the Math1-CreER\nT2\n(Math1-Cre/-) transgene on a C57BL/6J background were kindly provided by Dr. Rob Machold (New York University). The Math1-Cre transgene expresses Cre recombinase in GCs between embryonic day 13.5 and 16.5 upon activation with tamoxifen (\nMachold and Fishell, 2005\n). For experiments involving this transgene, dams carrying E16.5 pups were injected i.p. with 100 mg/kg tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), dissolved in corn oil. Because the tamoxifen injections interfered with parturition, pups were delivered by cesarean section at E19.5 and cross-fostered to CD-1 dams. All mice were bred at Emory University vivaria, housed on a 12 h light/dark cycle and had access to food and water\nad libitum\n. 2\u20133 week-old mice of both sexes were used for electrophysiological studies. 2\u20133 month-old mice of both sexes were used for behavioral and anatomical studies. Experiments were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as adopted by the United States National Institutes of Health and Emory University.\nPCR was used to genotype mice using the following forward and reverse primers. For the\nCacna1a\nknockout allele, 5\u2019-ATAATAAGTCACCTCTCGTTCTAAAG-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-CTGACTAGGGGAGGAGTAGAAG-3\u2019; for the flox allele, 5\u2019-ACCTACAGTCTGCCAGGAG-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-TGAAGCCCAGACATCCTTGG-3\u2019; for L7-Cre and Math1-Cre alleles, 5\u2019-GCGGTCTGGCAGTAAAAACTATC-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-TCTCTGACCAGAGTCATCCTTAGC-3\u2019.\n\nReverse transcriptase-PCR\nTotal RNA was isolated from brain using a PureLink RNA kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).\nCacna1a\ncDNA was synthesized using a Superscript III RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) with gene-specific primers (5\u2019-AAGTCTCTCCGAGTCCTCC-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-TCAGGAGCAGGGAGACAA-3\u2019). Reverse transcriptase-PCR products were sequenced as above to verify the presence of the c.4486T>G mutation.\n\nWestern blot\nBrain tissue was sonicated in RIPA buffer and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentration was adjusted and samples were incubated in Laemmli buffer and 4 mM urea at 37\u00b0C for 2 hrs. Proteins were separated on a 30% acrylamide gel containing 4M urea, transferred to a blot, and probed with antibodies to the Ca\nV\n2.1 \u03b1\n1\nprotein (1:200, rabbit polyclonal, Millipore, Billerica, MA) and \u03b2-tubulin (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) as a loading control. Blots were then incubated with secondary antibody (1:1000, \u03b1-rabbit IgG), developed with chemiluminescence, and imaged with a Fuji LAS-3000 digital imager (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).\n\nElectrophysiology\nMice were anesthetized with isoflurane, decapitated and the cerebella quickly removed. Sagittal cerebellar slices (400 \u00b5m) were cut on a vibratome and held in Tyrodes solution (in mM: 150 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 2 MgCl\n2\n, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH) at 34\u00b0C for 30 min before allowing them to cool to room temperature. Immediately prior to recording, slices were incubated for 10 min in papain (1 mg/mL, Worthington, Lakewood NJ), dissolved in dissociation solution (in mM: 82 Na\n2\nSO\n4\n, 30 K\n2\nSO\n4\n, 5 MgCl\n2\n,10 HEPES, 10 glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH). Slices were then washed in Tyrodes solution, placed in a fresh tube containing 1 mL Tyrodes solution, and dissociated by gentle trituration through a series of fire-polished pipettes. Supernatant containing dissociated cells was placed on poly-L-lysine coated cover slips for electrophysiological recording. Dissociated PCs were readily distinguished from surrounding cells by their large, pear-shaped soma and dendritic stump.\nBa\n2+\ncurrents were recorded in acutely dissociated PCs in whole-cell patch-clamp configuration at room temperature. For voltage-clamp, extracellular solutions were optimized for stable whole-cell recordings of Ca\nV\n2.1 currents and contained (in mM): 155 TEA-Cl, 10 HEPES, and 10 BaCl\n2\n, adjusted to pH 7.4 with TEA-OH. Prior to recording, TTX (1 \u00b5M) was added to the extracellular recording solution to block Na\n+\ncurrents. Intracellular solution contained (in mM): 140 Cs Methanesulfonate, 4 MgCl\n2\n, 0.5 EGTA, 9 HEPES, 14 creatine phosphate (Tris salt), 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Tris-GTP, adjusted to pH 7.4 with CsOH. Electrode resistances in the recording solutions were typically 4\u20136 M\u2126. Reagents used for electrophysiological recordings were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Currents were recorded with an Axon Multiclamp amplifier driven by pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). As soon as the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration was established, Ca\n2+\nchannel blockers were applied to the extracellular recording solution, which was switched via a Warner fast-exchange bath chamber, and recording protocols were initiated after a 5 min delay. In the case where the contributions of individual Ca\n2+\nchannel subtypes were measured, antagonists were added sequentially during recordings. Nimodipine (5 \u00b5M) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. \u03c9-Conotoxin-GVIA (1 \u00b5M) and MVIIC (3 \u00b5M) were obtained from Ascent Scientific (Princeton, NJ).\n\nHistology\nBrains were obtained after transcardial perfusion with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), post-fixed in 4% PFA and dehydrated and stored in 30% sucrose at 4\u00b0C. 30 \u00b5m coronal sections of the cerebellum were cut on a freezing microtome and stained with 0.1% Cresyl Violet. To visualize PCs, adjacent sections were reacted with an antibody to calbindin. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 10% H\n2\nO\n2\n, then blocked with 4% normal goat serum. Tissue was incubated for 48 hrs in primary antibody (1:1000 rabbit polyclonal, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), then for 4 hrs in secondary antibody (1:800 biotinylated \u03b1-rabbit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), avidin-biotin complex for 2 hrs (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), then reacted with 3,3-diaminobenzadine (Vector Labs) for 3\u20135 min. Sections were dehydrated through graded alcohols and xylenes, then mounted and coverslipped.\nTo assess Cre recombinase activity in L7-Cre and Math1-Cre lines, these lines were bred onto the Rosa26 reporter line, which is permissive for \u03b2-Galactosidase expression in the presence of Cre recombinase. Brains were flash-frozen and coronal cryosections were cut at 20 \u00b5m. Tissue was incubated in 0.02% Igepal (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide and 1 mg/ml 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal)(Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) in PBS overnight and counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red (Vector Labs).\n\nBehavioral analysis\nRotarod was used to test coordination. Mice were habituated for 30 seconds to a 4 cm diameter rod (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) rotating at 4 rpm. Rotation speed was increased from 4 to 40 rpm over a 6 min period. Mice that did not fall during the 6 min period were recorded as 6 min. Learning and performance of the task was assessed using the average of 4 consecutive trials over 4 consecutive days. Drug effects were assessed on 3 consecutive trials with mice previously trained on the rotarod. Mice were randomly assigned to drug or vehicle on two consecutive days.\nThe pole test was used as a second test of motor coordination. Mice were placed with their head oriented upwards on a 50 cm tall, 1 cm diameter vertical pole placed inside their home cage. The time for each mouse to descend and have all four limbs on the cage floor was recorded. Mice performed 5 trials of training each day for 2 days prior to testing. On the test day, mice performed 5 trials and the best time for each mouse was used for analysis.\nPhotocell activity chambers were used to measure spontaneous locomotor activity. Each mouse was placed in a separate chamber consisting of 20 \u00d7 40 cm plexiglass boxes with 4 infrared beams spanning the short axis and 8 infrared beams spanning the long axis (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA). Beam breaks were recorded automatically by a computer over a 26 hr time period.\nThe cling test was used to test strength and agility. Mice were habituated for 1 min on a horizontal 20 \u00d7 20 cm framed grid of wire mesh suspended above a padded surface. The frame was then rotated 90\u00b0 to vertical for 1 min, and then rotated another 90\u00b0 for 1 min so that the mice were inverted. The time to fall was recorded with a 180 sec cut-off. The average time to fall was determined from 3 trials for each mouse.\nDrug challenges were used to test for episodic motor abnormalities. Caffeine (Sigma-Aldrich) was delivered subcutaneously and EtOH was delivered i.p. Both drugs were dissolved in saline and delivered 20 min prior to behavioral testing as previously reported (\nFureman et al., 2002\n).\n\nData analysis\nAll data represent the mean \u00b1 SEM. For electrophysiological data statistical differences between groups were determined by one-way ANOVA.\nI\n-\nV\ncurves were fit with the function:\ng\n(\nV\n\u2013\nE\n)/(1 + exp[(\nV\n-\nV\n1/2\n)/\nk\n] +\nb\n) where\ng\nis the maximum conductance,\nV\nis the test potential,\nE\nis the apparent reversal potential,\nV\n1/2\nis the potential of half activation,\nk\nis the slope factor, and\nb\nis the baseline. Significant differences between\nI-V\ncurve values were determined with two-way repeated measure ANOVA. For locomotor activity and rotarod data statistical differences between groups were determined by two-way repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\ntest. For pole and cling test data statistical differences between groups were determined by oneway ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\ntest."

    "Methods": "Animals and Surgical Treatment\nSubjects were 67 male Wistar rats born to time-mated dams (Charles River Laboratories; Wilmington, MA) at Rhode Island College. Animals were housed using a 12-hour light/dark cycle with food and water available\nad libitum\n. On postnatal day one (P1), pups were culled into litters of eight males and two females to control for litter size and sex ratio. On P7, male subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Sham, hypoxia-ischemic vehicle treated and hypoxia-ischemic IAIP treated, hereafter designated as sham, HI+Vehicle and HI+IAIP, respectively. Male subjects were assessed, given prior evidence of behavioral deficits in male but not female rodents with neonatal brain injury (\nHill, et al., 2011\n,\nPeiffer, et al., 2004\n) \u2013 findings that parallel higher diagnostic rates of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., dyslexia, epilepsy, autism and intellectual disability) in human males as compared to females (\nLiederman, et al., 2005\n,\nRaz, et al., 1995\n,\nRutter, 2003\n).\nSubjects were weighed and anesthetized using 3% isoflurane and maintained with 1% during the surgical procedure. Methods for HI brain injury in neonatal rodents have been extensively described elsewhere (\nMcClure, et al., 2006\n,\nRice, et al., 1981\n). Briefly, following a 1 cm midline incision of the neck, the right common carotid artery (RCCA) was located and completely cauterized [see (\nMcClure, et al., 2006\n) for further details)]. The pups were sutured and labeled with paw ink injections for identification. Sham subjects underwent identical surgical procedures without cauterization of the RCCA. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C preoperatively, during surgery and during postoperative recovery. After surgery, the pups were returned to their dams and allowed to feed for 2\u20133 hours before exposure to hypoxia. All procedures were performed according to the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals and approved by the Rhode Island College Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nProduction and purification of IAIPs\nIAIPs were extracted from fresh frozen human plasma (Rhode Island Blood Center, RI). The purification process used a monolithic anion-exchange chromatographic method (CIMmultus, BIA Separation, Villach, Austria) that resulted in highly (>90%) pure biologically active IAIPs (US Patent #7,932,365, 2011) (\nLim, 2013\n,\nOpal, et al., 2011\n,\nSpasova, et al., 2014\n). Following binding, the column was washed sequentially with a buffer containing 200 mM NaCl and 200 mM acetate buffer, pH 3.0. IAIPs were eluted from the column using a buffer containing 750 mM NaCl. Eluted IAIPs were concentrated and buffer exchanged using a tangential flow filtration system (Labscale, Millipore). Purity analysis was performed by SDS-PAGE, Western immunoblot, competitive IAIP ELISA and standardized\nin-vitro\ntrypsin inhibition assay (\nLim, 2013\n,\nOpal, et al., 2011\n,\nSpasova, et al., 2014\n). The biological activity is based on the ability of IAIPs to inhibit the hydrolysis of the substrate N-Benzoyl-L-arginine)-\np\n-nitroaniline HCl (BAPNA, Sigma St. Louis, MO) by trypsin.\n\nExperiments\nThis study consists of two separate experiments as described below.\nExperiment 1: Short-term survival for cortical cell death and brain weight analyses\nAfter recovery from surgery, as described above (\nAnimals\n), subjects were removed from their home cage and received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of either 30 mg/kg of human IAIP (HI+IAIP, ProThera biologics, East Providence, RI) or placebo (0.9% NaCl vehicle; sham and HI). This dose of IAIP was selected based upon studies showing that the same dose of IAIP reduced the incidence of death from sepsis in neonatal and adult rats (\nOpal, et al., 2011\n,\nSingh, et al., 2010\n). After the IP injections, the HI groups were placed into an acrylic hypoxia chamber and exposed to humidified 8% O\n2\nand 92 % N\n2\nfor 90 minutes as shown in\nFig.1\n. Sham subjects received identical treatment but were maintained in a separate container exposed to room air for 90 minutes and received 0.9% NaCl vehicle injections. A second dose of treatment (IAIP) or vehicle was administered 24 hours after hypoxia. The total number of neonatal rats examined in experiment 1 was: Sham, n=10, HI+Vehicle, n=14, HI+IAIPs, n=9.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nStudy 1 timeline showing age of injury, treatment timing and age at sacrifice. Study 2 timeline showing age of injury, treatment timing and order of juvenile spatial (MWM) and non-spatial (NSWM) water maze testing and age at sacrifice.\nExperiment 2: Long-term survival/behavioral assessment and adult histopathology\nThe surgical procedures, doses, and timing of IAIP or vehicle administration were identical to those described above for experiment 1. However, subjects in experiment 2 were exposed to hypoxia for 120 minutes based upon our previous findings showing robust learning deficits after this duration of HI in neonatal rats (\nHill, et al., 2011\n,\nMcClure, et al., 2006\n). The total number of neonatal rats examined in experiment 2 was: Sham, n=12, HI+Vehicle, n=13, HI+IAIPs, n=9. The study timeline for experiment 2 is shown in\nFig. 1\n.\nExperiment 1: Histopathology on neonatal rats\nSeventy-two hours after the induction of HI at P7, subjects were weighed, deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital 100 mg/kg, perfused with 5 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 4\u00b0C, and fixed with 5 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were carefully extracted and weighed prior to paraffin embedding. Embedded brains were sectioned at 30 \u00b5m in the coronal plane and mounted on gelatin coated glass slides. One series of every 20\nth\nsection was stained with Fluro jade B (FJB). FJB is an anionic fluorescent stain used to identify degenerating neurons (\nRosen, et al., 2006\n,\nSchmued and Hopkins, 2000\n). Our protocol followed methods described by Rosen et al. (\nRosen, et al., 2006\n). Paraffin embedded samples were submerged in three-15 minute changes of xylene followed by a 5 minute bath of 100% ethanol. Samples were then moved to 1% sodium hydroxide/ethanol solution for 5 minutes, followed by 2 minutes in 70% ethanol. Samples were rinsed using deionized water (dH\n2\nO) for 2 minutes and then agitated on a shaker in 0.06% KMnO\n4\nfor 10 minutes. Sections were once again rinsed with dH\n2\nO before staining in FJB working solution (0.004%) for 20 minutes. Tissue was then rinsed three times for 2 minute each in dH\n2\nO, allowed to dry on a slide warmer, cleaned in xylene, mounted and cover slipped using DPX mounting media.\nThe number of FJB labeled profiles in the right cerebral cortices was assessed in a treatment blind manner using digital image analysis software (Fractionator probe, Stereo Investigator, Burlington, VT). Three serial sections of right cerebral cortex (ipsilateral to RCC ligation) from each subject, ~600\u00b5m apart, were traced under 10x magnification. An automated stage paired with Stereoinvestigator software was used to systematically step through adjacent counting frames (Fractionator probe) at 40x magnification. Every FJB labeled profile was marked within each counting frame with a circular digital counting tool set to a scaled 2 \u00b5m diameter. Profiles smaller than 2 \u00b5m in diameter were not included as they were considered cell fragments. FJB also stains vascular elements, which also were excluded from analysis.\nExperiment 2: Water escape, long-term spatial and non-spatial learning\nMethods used to assess spatial and non-spatial learning have been extensively reviewed elsewhere [for review see, (\nHyde, et al., 2002\n,\nThrelkeld, et al., 2012\n)]. All subjects were first tested on a water escape task as a motor, visual, and motivation control. The water escape task involved the use of a visible platform (20.3 cm diameter) placed at one end of a circular tub (122 cm) filled with water (20 cm) at room temperature, 22 \u00b0C. Subjects were released in the opposite end of the tub from the platform, and the latency to reach the platform was recorded. Behavioral testing began on P38, which is considered the juvenile period. Subjects received spatial testing first, for five days, followed by a two-day break and five days of non-spatial testing. Subjects were retested at P84+ in adulthood first on the spatial task and then on the non-spatial task in the following week to assess age related changes in learning performance in the presence of HI injury after having received IAIP or vehicle treatment as neonates on P7. Briefly, testing was conducted in a round 122 cm diameter tub filled with 22 \u00b0C water with a 20.3 cm diameter invisible submerged platform, consistently placed in the southeast (SE) quadrant, 2 cm below the water surface. Fixed, extra-maze cues were abundant (computer, sink, door, table), while precaution was taken to eliminate intra-maze cues. On each of five testing days, subjects underwent four trials, with each trial starting from a different randomly selected compass point (N, S, E, W). On day one, trial one, each subject was placed on the platform for 10 seconds, removed from the platform and then released from one of the starting locations. Each trial had a maximum duration of 45 seconds. Subjects unable to reach the platform within this time were guided to the target and remained there for 5 seconds. The latency to reach the platform for each trial was recorded.\nThe non-spatial Morris water maze (MWM) has been used to test non-spatial reference learning (\ne.g\n., the ability to consistently locate a hidden platform, using intra-maze visual cues that are independent of extra-maze space) (\nHyde, et al., 2002\n,\nMcClure, et al., 2006\n,\nStavnezer, et al., 2002\n,\nThrelkeld, et al., 2012\n). Testing took place in the same 122 cm diameter tub as the spatial MWM task, with the submerged 20.3 cm diameter platform located 2 cm below the water surface. However, the non-spatial maze included four vinyl inserts characterized by four black/white complex visual stimuli, which acted as intra-maze cues for each quadrant of the outer maze wall; See (\nThrelkeld, et al., 2012\n) for details). Further, the non-spatial maze was isolated from external cues using black curtains, which eliminated interference from familiar extra-maze spatial cues used for navigation in the MWM. The intra-maze patterns consisted of black/white vertical stripes; black/white horizontal stripes; white panel with 10 cm black dots and a black panel with 10cm white dots. The cues were secured to the inside wall of the maze [for more details, see (\nStavnezer, et al., 2002\n,\nThrelkeld, et al., 2012\n)]. The platform location was always paired with the vertical lines for each subject, such that learning required an association between the target intra-maze stimulus (i.e., vertical lines) and the platform, irrespective of extra-maze space. Therefore, on the four trials presented each day the platform and its associated cue (vertical stripes) were located in a new quadrant. Subjects were released from the same location on all trials, across five days of testing. Latency to reach the platform was recorded for each trial. All other testing parameters were similar to the spatial version of the MWM (number of trials, testing days, and length of time each subject was left on the platform).\nExperiment 2: Histopathology for adult rats\nOn P164, adult subjects, used for in behavioral testing, were weighed anesthetized with 100 mg/kg of pentobarbital, transcardially perfused with 200 ml of PBS at 4 \u00b0C, and 200 ml of 10% formalin. All brains were removed after sacrifice and submerged in 10% formalin until tissue sectioning. Brains were then embedded in 3% agarose gel using a standard agarose embedding protocol. Each brain was sectioned using a vibrating microtome (Leica Microsystems, Richmond, Illinois) at 70 \u00b5m in the coronal plane. Every fifth section was mounted on glass slides in preparation for staining and volume analysis. Sections were stained with 1% thionine following rehydration in a series of alcohol gradients using a standard thionine staining protocol. Samples were then cover-slipped using DPX mounting media in preparation for analysis.\nImages of each of the right hemispheres of the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, striatum, and corpus callosum were captured using a Q-imaging camera on an Olympus BX-53 bright-field microscope (Olympus Corporation, Central Valley, PA). Volumes of the hippocampus, striatum, cerebral cortex, and corpus callosum were measured with ImageJ using a grid overlay and point counting procedure (\nRosen and Harry, 1990\n,\nThrelkeld, et al., 2009\n). The boundaries of each structure were defined using a stereotaxic rat brain atlas (\nPaxinos, 2004\n). Cavalieri\u2019s estimator of volume equation was used to calculate volume estimates of each brain region. Cavaleiri\u2019s rule is widely recognized as an unbiased estimator of volume derived from serial section reconstruction (\nRosen and Harry, 1990\n).\n\nStatistical analysis\nExperiment 1: One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess group differences in brain weight. Repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) was used to compare FJB labeled profiles for three serial sections of cerebral cortex ipsilateral to ligation across treatment groups. In experiment 1, we used a one-tail test to evaluate changes in the FJB counts based upon the fact that HI injury has a unidirectional effect on brain injury consistent with our previous work (\nHill, et al., 2011\n).\nExperiment 2: Main effects were analyzed using repeated measures and oneway ANOVAs. Tukey\u2019s Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test was used to examine simple effects between treatment groups. Correlation analysis was also performed between composite performance on juvenile/adult learning measures and adult histological volume measures. All results were expressed as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). P<0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Animals and Pharmacological Interventions\nThis experiment was a controlled\nin vivo\nlaboratory study conducted in an animal research laboratory. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Loma Linda University in accordance with National Institute of Health guidelines. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan, IN) weighing 226\u2013338 g were housed with a 12/12 hour light/dark cycle in a temperature and humidity controlled environment.\nSAH rats received vehicle (0.2 ml of ethanol with 1.8 ml of 0.9% saline) or the selective CB2R agonist JWH133 (0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg, Tocris Bioscience, MN;\nKi\nvalue= 3.4 nM), which was dissolved in the vehicle, by intraperitoneal injection at 1 hour after SAH. The dose of JWH133 was selected based on previous publication (\nMurikinati et al., 2010\n). To ensure that the anti-apoptotic effects of CB2R activation was mediated by phosphorylation of CREB, we injected CREB small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) via intracerebroventricular route to deactivate CREB 24 hours before SAH-induction surgery. SAH rats were injected with control siRNA or CREB siRNA and were divided into cont-JWH and siRNA-JWH groups.\nWe used 123 animals in this study. The rats were randomly assigned to the following groups: SAH + vehicle in physiological parameter study (n=5), SAH + JWH133 (1.0) in physiological parameter study (n=5), sham-operated (sham group: n=15), SAH + vehicle (vehicle group: n=23), SAH + JWH133 (0.3) (low-JWH group: n=10), SAH + JWH133 (1.0) (JWH group: n=25), SAH + JWH133 (3.0) (high-JWH group: n=10), control siRNA with SAH + JWH133 (1.0) (cont-JWH group: n=7), and CREB siRNA with SAH + JWH133 (1.0) (siRNA-JWH group: n=7). Sixteen rats died within 1 hour after SAH during which time the rats had not received either the drug or vehicle yet.\n\nSAH Rat Model\nSAH was induced by the endovascular perforation method as previously described (\nBederson et al., 1995\n;\nSuzuki et al., 2010\n). Briefly, rats were anesthetized, intubated and kept on artificial ventilation during surgery with 3% isoflurane in 70%/30% medical-air/oxygen. Normothermia was maintained by a heating lamp. A sharpened 4-0 nylon suture was introduced into the left internal carotid artery until resistance was felt (approximately 18 mm from the common carotid bifurcation). The suture was advanced to perforate the bifurcation of the anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery until resistance was overcome after which the suture was immediately withdrawn. In sham-operated animals, the suture was inserted into the left internal carotid artery and then removed without perforating the artery. The skin incision was closed, and rats were individually housed in cages with temperature maintained at 98 degrees Fahrenheit by a heating pad until recovery. Buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously for post-operative analgesia.\n\nPhysiological Parameters\nThe right femoral artery was cannulated for continuous measurement of mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and for blood sampling as previously described (\nFujii et al., 2012\n). Arterial blood gases, pH and serum glucose was measured 15 minutes before, immediately after, and every 30 or 60 minutes after SAH. The monitoring was continued for 120 minutes after SAH induction.\n\nSAH Grade\nThe SAH severity was evaluated in a blinded manner as previously described (\nSugawara et al., 2008\n). Briefly, picture of the base of the brain was taken and divided into six segments. Each segment was sub-scored (0 to 3) depending on the amount of blood in the subarachnoid space and a total score was calculated as the sum of all sub-scores. The score ranged from 0 (no SAH) to 18 (severe SAH). Animals with SAH score of 7 or less were excluded from the study as previously described (\nSugawara et al., 2008\n).\n\nNeurological Score\nNeurological deficits were evaluated blindly using modified Garcia test (\nGarcia et al., 1995\n;\nSugawara et al., 2008\n). The test consisted of six parameters which included spontaneous activity; symmetry in the movement of all four limbs; forepaw outstretching; climbing; body proprioception; and response to vibrissae stimulation. The total score ranged from 2 to 18 (\nFujii et al., 2012\n). Neurological score was evaluated at 24 hours after sham or SAH-induction surgery. Additionally, neurological test was performed before the SAH-induction surgery and at 24 hours after the surgery in rats allocated to intracerebroventricular injection groups (cont-JWH and siRNA-JWH group).\n\nBrain Water Content Measurement\nBrain water content was measured 24 hours after SAH. Rats were sacrificed under lethal isoflurane anesthesia, and brains were quickly removed and then separated into left hemisphere, right hemisphere, cerebellum, and brain stem to measure brain edema as previously described (\nSuzuki et al., 2010\n). Each part was weighed immediately after removal (wet weight) and after drying at 100 \u00b0C for 72 hours (dry weight). The percentage of brain water content (BWC) was calculated as [(wet weight \u2212 dry weight)/wet weight] \u00d7100%.\n\nIntracerebroventricular Infusion\nUnder 3% isoflurane anesthesia, the needle of a 10-\u03bcL Hamilton syringe (Microliter No. 701; Hamilton Company, NV) was inserted through a burr hole on the skull into the left lateral ventricle according to the following coordinates relative to bregma: 1.5 mm posterior, 0.8 mm lateral, and 4.2 mm below the horizontal plane as previously described with modification (\nPeters et al., 2009\n;\nSuzuki et al., 2010\n). CREB-1 siRNA or an irrelevant control siRNA, 500 pmol each in 1\u03bcL siRNA dilution buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) was injected by a microinfusion pump (Harvard Apparatus, MA) at a rate 0.5 \u03bcL/min at 24 hours before SAH-induction. The needle was removed 20 minutes after the end of infusion, and the burr hole was plugged with bone wax. All the rats received JWH133 (1.0 mg/kg) intraperitoneally 1 hour after SAH.\nThree different CREB siRNA duplexes were pooled and the sequences were as follows:\n(a) sense, 5\u2032-CUGCAGACAUUAACCAUGA [dT][dT]-3\u2032 and\nantisense, 5\u2032-UCAUGGUUAAUGUCUGCAG [dT][dT]-3\u2032;\n(b) sense, 5\u2032-CAACCAAGUUGUUGUUCAA[dT][dT]-3\u2032 and\nantisense, 5\u2032-UUGAACAACAACUUGGUUG [dT][dT]-3\u2032;\n(c) sense, 5\u2032-GCAAGAGAAUGUCGUAGAA[dT][dT]-3\u2032 and\nantisense, 5\u2032-UUCUACGACAUUCUCUUGC [dT][dT]-3\u2032\nThe sequence of control siRNA used was as follows:\nsense, 5\u2032-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU[dT][dT]-3\u2032 and\nantisense, 5\u2032-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAA [dT][dT]-3\u2032\n\nWestern Blot Analysis\nAnimals were euthanized at 24 hours after surgery, and left hemisphere was processed as previously described (\nSuzuki et al., 2010\n). Equal amounts (40 \u03bcg) of protein were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the following primary antibodies: anti-phospho-CREB (Ser133) and anti-Bcl-2 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA), and anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:1000, Cell Signaling, MA). Appropriate secondary antibodies (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Immunoblots were then probed with an ECL Plus chemiluminescence reagent kit (Amersham Bioscience, IL) and bands were quantified by densitometry with Image J software (National Institutes of Health, MD). Alpha tubulin (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) was blotted on the same membrane as a loading control. Results are expressed as relative density to alpha tubulin and subsequently normalized to mean value of cont-JWH.\n\nTerminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-Mediated Uridine 5\u2032-Triphosphate-Biotin Nick End-Labeling (TUNEL) Staining\nAt 24 hours after sham or SAH-induction surgery, the rats were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline and 10% paraformaldehyde at the time of sacrifice. The brains were harvested and postfixed in 10% paraformaldehyde followed by 30% sucrose (weight/volume) for 3 days. Ten-micron-thick coronal sections were cut at the level of bregma-2 mm using a cryostat (LM3050S; Leica Microsystems) and mounted on poly-L-lysine-coated slides. Sections were stained with anti-neuronal nuclei antibody (1:100; Chemicon International, MA) and then subjected to terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining with an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Inc., Germany). TUNEL-positive neurons were evaluated in the left pyriform cortex.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nData for SAH grades and neurological scores were expressed as median and 25\nth\nto 75\nth\npercentiles and were analyzed by Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest or Kruskal-Wallis one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) on Ranks followed by Dunn\u2019s or Tukey post hoc analysis. Other values were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) and were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc analysis. T-test was used for statistical analysis in the intracerebroventricular siRNA injection groups. Mortality was analyzed by Fischer exact test. The data for physiological parameters were analyzed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA.\nP\n<0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale C57BL/6 mice (25-35 g body weight, 6-10 weeks old) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at LSU Health Sciences Center and are in compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. All efforts were made to minimize animal distress and the number of animals used.\n\nInduction of transient cerebral ischemia\nTransient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in anesthetized (150 mg/kg ketamine and 7.5 mg/kg xylazine) mice using the intraluminal filament method, as previously described (\nIshikawa et al 2005\n). The MCA was occluded for a period of 2.5 to 10 min, followed by a recovery (reperfusion) period of 1 - 28 days. Sham mice were subjected to the same procedure without arteriotomy and monofilament insertion.\n\nIntravital videomicroscopy\nFollowing 1 to 28 days of reperfusion, the mice were anesthetized and craniectomy (3 mm diameter; 1 mm posterior, 4 mm lateral from the bregma) was made and covered with a glass coverslip. The space between the glass and dura mater was filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (\nGavins et al 2007\n). The mouse was placed to the stage of an upright fluorescent microscope (BX51WI; Olympus, Japan) and allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes. Visualization of individual cerebral microvessels and the induction of thrombus formation were achieved using a 40\u00d7 water immersion objective lens (LUMPlan FI/IR 40\u00d7/0.80\u00d7; Olympus). The images were recorded on a DVD player (SR-MV50; JVC, Wayne, NJ). The diameters of the selected microvessels were measured using video analysis software (Image J software; NIH, US) on a personal computer (G4 Macintosh; Apple, CA).\n\nLight/dye induced thrombosis\nA 10 ml/kg body weight dose of 5% fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC; 150,000 molecular weight; Sigma-Aldrich, US) was injected into the femoral vein and allowed to circulate for 10 minutes. Photoactivation of FITC (excitation, 495 nm; emission, 519 nm) was initiated by exposing 100 \u03bcm vessel length to epi-illumination with a 175-W xenon lamp (Lamda LS, Sutter, US) coupled with a fluorescein filter cube (HQ-FITC; Chroma Technology, US). The excitation power density was calibrated daily and maintained within 1% of 0.17 W/cm\n2\n, as previously described (\nSenchenkova et al 2013\n). During continuous epi-illumination, thrombus formation was visualized and quantified in both venules and arterioles (diameters: 20\u201340\u03bcm) by determining the time of onset of platelet deposition/aggregation (visualized as the initial accumulation of 3+ platelets) on the vessel wall (onset time) and the time to complete blood flow cessation (cessation time). Onset time and cessation time were averaged from 2\u20134 induced thrombi in each vessel type (i.e., venules and arterioles) of the same mouse. The internal diameters of arterioles and venules were measured by offline analysis for the period immediately preceding the determination of onset time and just prior to complete flow cessation. In order to address whether the light/dye method elicited vasoconstriction, the diameters measured at the time of flow cessation was normalized (expressed as %) to the diameter determined prior to onset time.\n\nNeurological assessment\nThe functional consequences of the transient ischemic insult were evaluated in mice following 1-24 hrs of reperfusion using a 5-point scale neurological deficit score where: 0 = no deficit; 1 = failure to extend right paw; 2 = circling to the right; 3 = falling to the right; and 4 = unable to walk spontaneously, as previously described (\nIshikawa et al 2005\n).\n\nQuantification of infarction volume\nAfter 24 hr reperfusion, mice were euthanized, the brain immediately removed, and placed into 4\u00b0C PBS for 15 minutes. Coronal sections (2-mm) were stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0C and fixed by immersion in 10% formaldehyde (\nTerao et al 2008\n). The total areas of each brain section and the infarcted region were quantified using a computerized image analysis program (NIH Image Software).\n\nAnti-platelet therapy\nAspirin, clopidogrel and dipyridamole were obtained from Sigma Chemicals (St. Louis, MO) and atorvastatin from AK Scientific Inc (Union City, CA). In these mice, the brain was subjected to 5 min of transient focal cerebral ischemia followed by 1 day of reperfusion. The following treatment (prior to MCA occlusion) regimens were used: aspirin (50mg/kg/day, 5 days pretreatment plus one dose 2 hrs after ischemia, by gavage) (\nTailor et al 2007\n), dipyridamole (60mg/kg by gavage, 2 hrs after ischemia) (\nKim et al 2008\n) and atorvastatin (10mg/kg/day, 5 days pretreatment plus one dose immediately after ischemia) (\nChen et al 2005\n). Clopidogrel (3mg/kg by gavage)(\nBird et al 2012\n) was administered 2 hrs following release of the MCA occlusion. For the combination treatment experiments, the following schedule was used: 1) atorvastatin (14 day pretreatment plus one dose after ischemia), 5 day dipyridamole pretreatment plus one dose after ischemia), or 2) atorvastatin and dipyridamole (as described in #1) plus 5 day aspirin pretreatment and one dose 2 hrs after ischemia.\n\nTail bleeding time\nAnesthetized mice were placed on a warm pad and the tails were transected 5 mm from the tip with a razor blade and immediately immersed into a 15 ml falcon tube filled with 14 ml saline (37\u00b0C). The total time (including re-bleeding time) for cessation of bleeding was recorded, and after 10 minutes the bleeding was stopped by cauterization.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nSpontaneous thrombus development in cerebral microvessels was evaluated in mice subjected to either 5 min or 60 min of MCAo followed by 24 hrs of reperfusion. For these experiments, mice were transcardially perfused with 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 10% formalin. Brains were collected, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned into 5\u03bcm sections. The sections were deparaffinized followed by antigen retrieval using 1x antigen decloaker (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA). Sections were then stained for fibrinogen and glycoprotein 1 beta (GP1b). The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-mouse fibrinogen (1:500; GeneTex, Irvine, CA) and rat anti-mouse GP1b (1:100; emfret, Eibelstadt, Germany). Secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor\n\u00ae\n647 goat anti-rabbit (1:600; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and Alexa Fluor\n\u00ae\n488 goat anti-rat (1:500; Life Technologies). Images of the double stained tissue sections were captured on an Olympus BX51WI upright microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA) with a 20X (LUCPlanFLN) objective and equipped with a 3i LaserStack laser launch (3i; Denver, CO), Yokogawa CSU-X1-A1N-E spinning disk confocal unit (Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and electron multiplier CCD camera (C9100-13; Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ). 488-, and 640-nm laser excitation were used in rapid sequence and visualized with the appropriate filters (Semrock, Rochester, NY). Slidebook software (3i) was used to drive the confocal system and capture images for offline analysis. Merged images were used to determine areas of co-localization.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as means \u00b1 SEM unless otherwise indicated. One-way ANOVA was used with the Bonferroni post hoc test. Differences between two data sets were determined using the two-tailed unpaired t-test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals and treatment\nAnimal care and handling procedures followed Institutional (NKI IACUC)\nand National Institutes of Health guidelines. C57BL/6J mice were housed in\ngroups under standard laboratory conditions (12 hr light / 12 hr dark cycle)\nwith food and water available ad libitum. An ethanol treatment paradigm, which\nhas been previously shown to induce robust apoptotic neurodegeneration in P7\nmice (\nOlney, et al., 2002\n) and causes no\nlethality, was used in the current study. Litters of mice were culled to four to\nsix pups per litter, and on the day of treatment, half of the pups (male) in\neach litter were treated subcutaneously (s. c.) with saline and the other half\nwith ethanol at P7 (based on the day of birth) (2.5 g/kg s. c. at 0 h and again\nat 2 h) in their home cage with the dam as described previously by our\nlaboratory (\nSubbanna, et al., 2013a\n,\nSubbanna, et al., 2013b\n). For blood\nethanol levels (BEL), pups were euthanized by decapitation ; truncal blood was\ncollected at 3 and 9 hr following the first ethanol injection. The\nconcentrations of ethanol in pup serum were then determined using a standard\nalcohol dehydrogenase-based method (\nLundquist,\n1959\n). For the Bix experiments, Bix-01294 (2-(Hexahydro-4-methyl-1\nH\n-1,4-diazepin-1-yl)-6,7-dimethoxy-\nN\n-[1-(phenylmethyl)-4-piperidinyl]-4-quinazolinamine\ntrihydrochloride) (Cayman, Michigan, USA) was dissolved in 10\u00b5l of\nethanol followed by 2\u20133 drops of Tween 80 (10 \u00b5l) and then\nvolume was made up with sterile saline solution. The Bix solution was\nadministered by s. c. injection at a volume of 5 \u00b5l/g body weight 30 min\nbefore ethanol treatment. The Bix vehicle solution was injected as a control.\nBix treatment did not alter P7 ethanol induced intoxication (sleeping time) and\nBix alone treated P7 mice were similar like saline treated mice and did not\ncause any inflammation or bleeding in any of the organs (\nSubbanna, et al., 2014\n,\nSubbanna, et al., 2013b\n). Mice were kept with the dams until they\nwere weaned. Three months old mice derived from different litters after P7\ntreatment [saline + vehicle (S + V), ethanol + vehicle (E + V), saline + Bix (S\n+ Bix) and ethanol + Bix (E + Bix)] were used for several analyses, as described\nbelow. Five to 8 animals were used for each data point. In the current study,\nmale mice were used for behavioral analysis to avoid the hormonal fluctuation\nthat occurs during the estrous cycle; this could potentially affect animal\nbehavior, thus complicating the data interpretation . Separate sets of animals\nwere subjected to each behavioral study (n=8/group).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were anesthetized and perfused with a solution containing 4%\nparaformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in 0.05 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2), 8\nh after the first ethanol dose treatment . It has been shown that this time\npoint is optimal to induce maximum caspase-3 activation in one or more brain\nregions (\nIkonomidou, et al., 2000\n,\nSubbanna, et al., 2013b\n,\nWilson, et al., 2011\n). The brains were\nfurther processed according to our previously described protocols (\nSubbanna, et al., 2014\n,\nSubbanna, et al., 2013a\n,\nSubbanna, et al., 2013b\n). Free-floating\nsections were obtained from ethanol- and saline-exposed brains (8 h of exposure)\nand immunostained using an antibody against anti-rabbit cleaved caspase-3\n(Asp175) (CC3) (# 9661 , Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA)\nwith ABC reagents (Vectastain ABC Elite Kit, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA)\nand a peroxidase substrate (DAB) kit (Vector Labs) to label neurodegenerating\nneurons. The primary antibodies were omitted from the reactions as a control for\nsecondary antibody specificity. In addition, pre-incubation with blocking\npeptides for the anti-CC3 (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) completely blocked\nthe immunostaining of CC3 antibody. All photomicrographs were taken through a\n2.5X, or 40X objective with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 inverted microscope attached\nto a digital camera (DXM1200F, Morrell Instrument Company, Melville, NY,\nUSA).\n\nElectrophoresis and immunoblot\nFor Western blot analysis, homogenates from the hippocampus and cortex of\nthe pups were processed 4\u201324 h after saline or ethanol ( first ethanol\ndose ) injection as described previously (\nLubin\nand Sweatt, 2007\n,\nSubbanna, et al.,\n2013a\n,\nSubbanna, et al.,\n2013b\n). Cytosolic and nuclear fractions from tissue homogenates were\nprepared as described in our recent publications (\nBasavarajappa, et al., 2014\n,\nBasavarajappa and Subbanna, 2014\n). The samples were prepared in a\nsample buffer as previously described by our laboratory (\nBasavarajappa, et al., 2008\n). The blots were incubated with\nthe following primary antibodies: anti-rabbit-CC3 (Asp175) (polyclonal,\n#9661, 1:1000), anti-mouse-\u03b2-actin (monoclonal, #3700,\n1:1,000), anti-rabbit-H3K9me2 (monoclonal, # 4658, 1: 1000) and\nanti-rabbit-H3 (polyclonal, # 9715, 1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology,\nDanvers, MA, USA). The blots were incubated with the primary antibodies for 3 h\nat room temperature or overnight at 4 \u00b0C and processed as previously\ndescribed by our laboratory (\nBasavarajappa, et\nal., 2008\n). Incubation with a secondary antibody alone did not\nproduce any bands (data not shown).\n\nLTP\nThree-month-old male mice, treated at P7 with S + V, E + V, S + Bix, or E\n+ Bix (n=5/group), were sacrificed by cervical dislocation followed by\ndecapitation . Hippocampi were quickly removed. Transverse hippocampal slices\n(400 \u00b5m) were cut and recorded according to standard procedures (\nBasavarajappa and Subbanna, 2014\n,\nSadrian, et al., 2012\n,\nSubbanna, et al., 2013a\n,\nVitolo, et al., 2002\n). Following cutting,\nhippocampal slices were transferred to a recording chamber where they were\nmaintained at 29\u00b0 C and perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid\n(ACSF) continuously bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The ACSF\ncomposition in mM was: 124.0 NaCl, 4.4 KCl, 1.0 Na2HPO4, 25.0 NaHCO3, 2.0 CaCl2,\n2.0 MgSO4, 10.0 glucose, osmolarity 290\u2013300. CA1 fEPSPs were recorded by\nplacing both the stimulating and the recording electrodes in CA1\nstratum\nradiatum\n. Basal synaptic transmission (BST) was determined by\nplotting the fiber volley amplitude against slopes of\nfield-excitatory-post-synaptic potential (fEPSP). For LTP experiments, a 10 min\nbaseline was recorded every min at an intensity that evokes a response\n~35% of the maximum evoked response. LTP was induced using\ntheta-burst stimulation (4 pulses at 100 Hz, with the bursts repeated at 5 Hz,\nand each tetanus including 3\u00d7 10-burst trains separated by 15 seconds).\nResponses were recorded for 2 hrs after and measured as fEPSP slope expressed as\npercentage of baseline.\n\nObject recognition memory\nNovel object recognition memory was evaluated as described before (\nBasavarajappa and Subbanna, 2014\n,\nEnnaceur and Delacour, 1988\n,\nSubbanna, et al., 2013a\n), which is based on\nthe natural tendency of rodents to explore a novel object more than a familiar\none. In brief, three month-old male mice, treated at P7 with S + V, E + V, S +\nBix and E + Bix (n=8/group) were submitted individually to a habituation session\nwhere they were allowed to freely explore the open field for 3 min twice a day\nfor two days . No objects were placed in the box during the habituation trial.\nTwenty-four hours after habituation, training (T1) was conducted by placing\nindividual mice for 3 min in the open field, in which two identical objects\n(objects a1 and a2) were positioned in two adjacent corners at 10 cm distance\nfrom the walls. In a short-term recognition memory test given at 1 or 4 h\n(retention) after the training (T2), the mice explored the open field for 3 min\nin the presence of one familiar (a1) and one novel (b1, 1h; b2, 4h) object. In a\nlong-term recognition memory test given at 24h (retention) after training (T2),\nthe mice explored the open field for 5min in the presence of one familiar (a1)\nand one novel object (b3; different from b1 and b2). All objects had similar\ntextures and sizes but had distinctive shapes and colors. Between trials, the\nobjects were washed with 10% ethanol solution. Exploration was defined\nas directing the nose to the object at a distance of no more than 2 cm and/or\ntouching the object with the nose. Sitting on the object was not considered as\nexploratory behavior. e1 and e2 are measures of the total exploration time of\nboth objects during T1 and T2, respectively. d2 was considered as index measures\nof discrimination between the new and the familiar objects. d2 is a relative\nmeasure of discrimination which corrects the difference between exploring the\nold and the novel object for exploration activity (e2) and appears to be\nindependent of the total exploration times (\nSik,\net al., 2003\n).\n\nSpontaneous alternation Y maze task\nSpontaneous alternation was tested as described previously (\nBasavarajappa and Subbanna, 2014\n,\nHolcomb, et al., 1998\n) to assess spatial\nworking memory that is dependent upon the hippocampus. In brief, three month old\nmale mice, treated at P7 with S + V, E + V, S + Bix and E + Bix (n=8/group) were\nused in this test. Each mouse was placed in the center of the Y maze and was\nallowed to explore freely through the maze during an 8 min session. The sequence\nand total number of arms entered was recorded. Arm entry was considered to be\ncompleted when the hind paws of the mouse had been completely placed in the arm.\nPercentage alternation is the number of triads containing entries into all three\narms divided by the maximum possible alternations (the total number of arms\nentered minus 2) \u00d7 100.\n\nSpatial recognition memory using Y maze\nSpatial recognition memory using Y maze was tested as described\npreviously (\nBasavarajappa and Subbanna,\n2014\n,\nSarnyai, et al., 2000\n).\nBriefly, three-month-old male mice, treated at P7 with S + V, E + V, S + Bix and\nE + Bix (n=8/group) were used in this test. Briefly, each mouse was placed into\none of the arms of the Y maze (start arm) and allowed to explore the maze with\none of the arms closed for 10 min (training trial). After a 1h intertrial\ninterval, mice were returned to the Y maze by placing them in the start arm.\nThen, the mice were allowed to explore freely all three arms of the maze for 3\nmin (test trial). The number of entries into and the time spent in each arm, and\nthe first choice of entry were registered manually and from video recordings by\nan observer blind to the treatment or genotype of the mice.\n\nSocial recognition memory\nThe social recognition test was performed as previously described (\nKogan, et al., 2000\n,\nThor, et al., 1982\n). Three-month-old male mice were treated\non P7 with S + V, E + V, S + Bix and E + Bix (n=8/group). Each mouse was placed\nin an individual cage in an observation room with dim light immediately prior to\nthe experimental sessions. The mice were allowed to habituate to the new\nenvironment for 15 min. The experimental cages were identical to those in which\nthe animals were normally housed (plastic, 27 cm long \u00d7 16 cm wide\n\u00d7 12 cm high). A male, juvenile mouse (3\u20134 weeks old) was placed\ninto a cage with an adult for an initial interaction trial (2 min duration).\nFollowing the intertrial delay, the same juvenile mouse was placed back into the\nadult\u2019s cage for a 2-min test trial. The animals were returned to their\nhome cages during the interim between the initial and the test trials. A trained\nobserver continuously timed the duration of the social investigation (with a\nhand-held stopwatch). The scored social investigative behaviors have been\npreviously described and include the following: direct contact with the juvenile\nwhile inspecting any part of the body surface (including grooming, licking, and\npawing); sniffing of the mouth, ears, tail, ano-genital area; and close\nfollowing (within 1 cm) of the juvenile (\nKogan,\net al., 2000\n,\nThor, et al.,\n1982\n). If the adult mouse did not investigate the juvenile mouse for\na minimum of 24 s during the initial trial (i.e., 20% of trial time),\nthey were retested once with another juvenile. The trials with initial\ninvestigation times less than 24 s were excluded from the analysis. Any\naggressive encounter between animals was an immediate cause for termination of\nthe experiment, and these data were excluded from the analysis. The percentage\nof social investigation was calculated by dividing the investigation time during\nthe second exposure by the initial investigation time \u00d7 100.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll of the data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. A statistical\ncomparison of the data was performed by either a student\u2019s\nt\ntest or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or a two-way\nANOVA with Bonferroni\u2019s\npost hoc\ntest. In all of the\ncomparisons, p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical\nsignificance. The statistical analyses were performed using the Prism software\n(GraphPad, San Diego, CA)."

Control animals (n=19) additionally received daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections of thiamine hydrochloride (0.4 mg/kg). The remaining 37 animals received daily IP injections of pyrithiamine hydrobromide (0.5 mg/kg): pyrithiamine-treated (PT) rats were made thiamine-deficient until ataxia was observed, typically by day 12 of treatment. A glucose challenge was given to accelerate neurodegeneration (\nHarper, 1980\n;\nJordan et al., 1998\n;\nVictor et al., 1989\n;\nWallis et al., 1978\n;\nWatson et al., 1981\n). All 19 thiamine treated (i.e., control) animals were challenged with glucose (5g/kg) by intravenous (IV) administration in the caudal tail vein (i.e., control + glucose, CG), 10 pyrithiamine-treated animals received IV saline (i.e., pyrithiamine + saline, PS), and 27 pyrithiamine-treated animals were challenged with IV glucose (i.e., pyrithiamine + glucose, PG). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO.\n\nBehavioral Analysis\nNeurological examination (\nBecker, 2000\n;\nRoberts et al., 1996\n;\nYaksh et al., 1977\n) was performed daily on 19 CG and 37 PT animals beginning on day 8 and continuing daily until day 12 or 13 of thiamine deprivation. Rats were rated (0=absent, 1=present) for the presence of behavioral signs in the following categories: autonomic, sensory, arousal, posture, motor, central, and responses to stimulation.\n\nMeasurement of Thiamine and its Derivatives\nWhole blood (~1.5ml) was collected via retro-orbital bleed in EDTA tubes at baseline (11 CG, 23 PT) and after 12\u201313 days of thiamine deficiency (19 CG, 37 PT). Of 27 animals that received glucose challenge, 10 had blood collected after the challenge to determine if glucose challenge further affected levels of thiamine and its derivatives. AniLyitics Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD), measured thiamine and its phosphate derivatives (thiamine monophosphate (TMP) and thiamine diphosphate (TDP)) using recommended methods (\nMancinelli et al., 2003\n).\n\nMR Scanning Procedures and Data Analysis\nSchedule\nMRI and MRS were acquired on 24 animals (6 CG, 5 PS, 13 PG) at baseline (time 1), on days 12 or 13 of thiamine deprivation (time 2), and within 3h of saline or glucose challenge (time 3), administered immediately upon completion of the 2nd scan (\nFigure 1a\n). All 56 animals, whether they were MR scanned or not, were sacrificed within 6h of the challenge.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\na) Experimental schedule indicating the 3 scan time points. b) Pattern of weight loss in the 2 groups (CG=control (n=19); PT=pyrithiamine treated (n=37)) beginning on day 8 of treatment. * p\u2264.05.\nAnesthesia and Monitoring\nAnimals were held in an MR-invisible structure providing support for a radiofrequency (RF) coil and nose cone for delivery of isoflurane anesthesia (1.5\u20133%) and oxygen (1.5L/min) (\nAdalsteinsson et al., 2004\n). Blood oxygen saturation, pulse rate, rectal temperature, and respiration were monitored throughout the ~2h MR scan.\nMRI Acquisition\nImaging was conducted on a clinical 3T GE Signa MR scanner equipped with a high-strength insert gradient coil (peak strength=600 mT/m, peak slew rate=3200 T/m/s; (\nChronik et al., 2000a\n;\nChronik et al., 2000b\n) operated at 500mT/m and a slew rate of 1800mT/m/ms. A custom-made rat brain quadrature head coil (\u00d8=44mm) was used for both RF excitation and signal reception. A gradient-recalled echo localizer scan was used to position the animals in the scanner and for graphical prescription of the subsequent scans. High resolution, dual-echo, fast spin-echo (FSE) images were acquired in the rat axial plane, coronal to the magnet system bore (echo time (TE)1/TE2/repetition time (TR)=11.3/56.7/5000ms, field of view=64x48mm\n2\n, 256x192 matrix, echo train length=8, 50 slices, 0.3mm thick, 0mm separation, in-plane resolution=0.25x.25mm\n2\n, 4 separate acquisitions each with 2 NEX).\nImage Post-processing\nBriefly, post-processing of FSE images included motion correction, alignment of the image to a whole-head image of a template animal, and longitudinal alignment. Bilateral regions of interest (ROI) that were unaffected by treatment were used as bilateral reference regions (9.6mm\n3\n) for comparison of T2 values in bilateral samples of the thalamus (4.5 mm\n3\n), hippocampus (11.9mm\n3\n), frontal cortex (8.1mm\n3\n), non-brain control muscle (5.9mm\n3\n) and regions encompassing the inferior colliculi (11.9mm\n3\n).\nFor ventricular quantification, after rigid alignment to a laboratory standard template, bilateral 93.58mm\n3\nROIs were projected onto each animal\u2019s T2 image. An intensity histogram was created for the T2 values from the combined left and right ROIs, and a Gaussian plus quadratic function was modeled with a non-linear least-squares fit with 6 unknown parameters (\u201cIDL gauss fit\u201d function). All voxels 2.5 SD greater than the center of the Gaussian function were deemed ventricle CSF.\nMRS Acquisition\nFSE images were used to prescribe a single voxel (4x5x9mm) in the thalamus according to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (\nPaxinos and Watson, 2005\n). Spectroscopic data were acquired with constant time point-resolved spectroscopy (CT-PRESS) (\nDreher and Leibfritz, 1999\n;\nMayer and Spielman, 2005\n). The quality of the spectra allowed evaluation of signals of the major proton metabolites: N-acetyl aspartate (NAA, 2.01 ppm), total creatine (tCr, 3.03 ppm), choline-containing compounds, (Cho, 3.20 ppm), glutamate (Glu, 2.36ppm), and lactate (Lac, 1.31 ppm). We chose not to assess mI because of the variability inherent in its quantification (\nOkada et al., 2007\n).\n\nLiver Histology\nLeft lateral lobe liver specimens from all rats (19 CG, 10 PS, 27 PG) were fixed then routinely processed for light microscopic examination by a veterinary pathologist (RL) for hepatic pathology on a 0 to 5 scale: 0=absent, 1=minimal (<5% of tissue), 2=mild (5\u201320% of tissue), 3=moderate (20\u201350% of tissue), 4=severe (50\u201375% of tissue), and 5=massive (>75% of tissue) (\nZahr et al., 2009b\n).\n\nBrain Cytokines\nUnilateral brain regions (right) from 15 CG, 6 PS, and 17 PG animals were quickly dissected from the right hemisphere using a rat coronal (1mm) brain matrix on dry ice. Although 38 animals were dissected, brain regions were represented unequally due to loss of some regions during dissections. Brain regions collected included inferior colliculi (n=30), thalamus (n=38), hypothalamus (n=37), anterior vermis of the cerebellum (n=29), and hippocampus (n=38); these regions were chosen because of their presumed sensitivity to thiamine deficiency. The cytokine assay was carried out in duplicate according to the instructions provided with Mesoscale Singleplex Kits (Gaithersburg, MD) for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, MCP-1 (CCL2), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-10.\n\nBrain Histology\nLeft brain hemispheres from 5 CG and 5 PG animals were fixed and hemi-coronal sections (40\u03bcm) were collected on a Leica cryostat (Buffalo Grove, IL; 40). Sections from the inferior colliculus, thalamus, and hippocampus were used to evaluate microglial activation (immunopositive for Iba-1, enlarged cell bodies, retracted and thickened processes).\n\nStatistics\nFor variables collected prior to glucose challenge, statistics were conducted on 2 groups (i.e., CG and PT); for variables collected after glucose challenge, 3 group (CG, PS, PG) comparisons were conducted. Because of significant weight loss in PT animals, values for levels of thiamine and its phosophate derivatives were weight-corrected based on the weights of 19 CG animals on day 8 of treatment; MR variables of interest were weight-corrected based on weight on day 8 of treatment of the 6 CG animals that were scanned. Between-group and within-group differences were examined with repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVAs). Follow-up\nt-tests\nanalyzed between group differences; Wilcoxon signed rank test examined within group differences when relevant. Bivariate analyses, both parametric and nonparametric, tested relationships between variables in PT (i.e., PS+PG) rats only."

    "Methods": "All methods and data were reported with consideration of guidelines provided by Animals in Research: Reporting in Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) and Minimum Information About a Spinal Cord Injury Experiment (MIASCI)Kilkenny et al., 2010;Lemmon et al., 2014).\n\nAnimal group sizes, power calculations and group designations\nThe effort to replicate Hellal et al. was completed in two phases. Phase 1 targeted\nFigure 1\nfrom Hellal et al. in which Taxol was shown to reduce scarring in a rat hemisection lesion model (\nHellal et al., 2011\n). Phase 2 was designed to replicate Hellal's\nFig. 4E&F\n, where Taxol was shown to increase 5HT axon labeling below the site of injury and improve behavioral recovery after spinal contusion injury. As the goal was to examine the potential for translation, we were not charged to replicate data in\nFig. 4A-D\n, which show that Taxol improves axon growth following a peripheral conditioning lesion.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nCustom designed catheters for intrathecal delivery of cremaphor vehicle and/or Taxol. A rat intrathecal catheter (Alzet #0007740) was modified by inserting a segment of silastic tubing at the junction between the osmotic pump and the remaining segment of intrathecal catheter. (1) Briefly, intrathecal catheters, comprised of a thin Teflon-coated wire stylet (A), an external catheter segment (B), a connector segment (C) and the intrathecal segment (D) were cut to a length of ~50 mm. Three separate pieces of silastic tubing (Dow Corning; #508-004) also were prepared for each catheter; two cuffs (4mm and 2mm) and a single 20 mm segment (E, F, G). (2) The external segment of catheter is cut to a length of ~8mm (B) then is inserted along with the stylet (A) into one end of the 20 mm segment of silastic tubing (E) until it abuts the connector (C) just proximal to the distal catheter segment (D). (3) A 4 mm silastic cuff (F) was slipped over this junction (H) then the external catheter segment was connected to the metal hub of the osmotic pump. (4) The remaining 2 mm silastic cuff (G) was placed mid way over the distal 20 mm segment of silastic tubing where it serves as an anchor point for securing sutures on each side of the cuff. (5) Finally, a few drops of Histoacryl\u00ae (TissueSeal, LLC; #TS1050071FP; Ann Arbor, MI) was applied to all cuffs (F,G) and at the interface between the long segment of silastic tubing (E) and the pump connector. This seals all connections and prevents leakage.\nFigure 4.\nOpen in a new tab\nExpanded anatomical analysis of spinal cord hemisection lesion after 7-day infusion with vehicle or Taxol. (A) Lesion centers from two vehicle and two Taxol specimens stained with EC/CV. Note the extended cap of connective tissue (black arrows) that is continuous with the lesion matrix in tissues from vehicle treatment group. These are absent in specimens from the Taxol-treated group (scale = 500 \u03bcm). (B) Taxol has no effect on the dorsal-ventral (DV) lesion length or total volume as measured from EC/CV stained sections. (C) Taxol reduces deposition of laminin, collagen IV and fibronectin (scale = 400 \u03bcm) and alters CS56 expression within the lesion (scale = 200 \u03bcm). Note how the diffuse pattern of fibronectin labeling in vehicle treated (white arrow) contrasts with the dense fibrillar staining pattern in Taxol-treated specimens (double white arrows). (D) GFAP- immunoreactivity lines the lesion border in both vehicle and taxol treated specimens. (F) Immunofluorescence intensity was measured in a constant region of interest (0.04 mm\n2\nsample box) positioned at the rostral lesion border (scale = 200 \u03bcm). Both fibronectin and GFAP labeling were increased at this site after Taxol infusion. (F) Qualitative analyses reveal fewer neurofilament-positive axons and NG2+ profiles (asterisks) in Taxol-treated specimens (scale = 100 \u03bcm).\nPrior to starting phase 1, n=13 animals were used in pilot studies to establish consistent injury technique and catheter placement. No quantitative data were generated from these animals. For replication of\nFig. 1\n, animal group sizes were matched to those described in the original manuscript (n=14/grp). Before attempting to replicate\nFig. 4E&F\n, optimal group sizes were calculated via power analyses. Using raw data from\nFig. 4E\nonly (anatomical analysis of 5-HT+ fibers) it was determined that a 50% increase in the number of 5HT+ fibers would yield power of 0.8 with \u03b1=0.05 using n=7 rats/group. However, using raw data from\nFig. 4F\n(provided by the original authors), power calculations for a 2 way ANOVA indicated that hundreds of animals/group were necessary to sufficiently power a replication of the effects of Taxol on behavioral recovery. This was impractical under the auspices of the replication contract, so logistics (e.g., timing, expense) and past experience with this type of injury and behavioral analyses were used as criteria to determine group size. To minimize surgical, cohort, and dayto-day variations, all experiments were designed such that control and Taxol-treated animals could be prepared on the same day and surgeries for each phase were completed over a 2 day period.\nFor each phase of replication, GraphPad's\nQuickCalcs\nsoftware was used to randomly assign animals into one of two groups: (1) control/vehicle or (2) Taxol. In phase 1, a total of 28 animals received laminectomy or bilateral dorsal spinal hemisection injuries and 100% survived for the 7 day study period. For phase 2, 24 animals received a laminectomy or spinal contusion injury and 100% survived for the duration of the 8 week study period. A total of five animals were excluded from data analyses; one animal died before injury but was replaced and an additional four animals were excluded from phase 2 analysis based on post-mortem inspection of their intrathecal catheters. Specifically, catheters were found on top of the dura in two vehicle and one Taxol-treated contusion animal. Thus, we could not be certain that drug or vehicle was delivered consistently to the injury site throughout the duration of the study. In one other animal (vehicle group), the catheter tip had penetrated into and damaged the spinal cord.\n\nDrug preparation\nTaxol (Paclitaxel; cat #9600 LC Laboratories; Woburn, MA) was purchased just prior to the start of the first experiments and stored as a lyophilized powder at \u221220\u00b0C until use. Hellal et al. used 5 different lots of Taxol and confirmed efficacy of each lot by quantifying Taxol-induced changes in axon formation in embryonic neurons (personal communication). For replication, a single lot of Taxol (#ASM-114) was used. A stock solution of Taxol was prepared by adding 2.34 ml of DMSO (#D-2438 Sigma; St. Louis, MO) to 100 mg of Taxol. Stock vials (25\u03bcl aliquots, 42.7 mg/ml) were prepared and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Working solutions for use in osmotic pumps were diluted with a 1:1 mixture of Cremophor Oil (#C-5135 Sigma; St. Louis, MO) and absolute ethanol (EtOH; #E-7023 Sigma Aldrich). The Cremophor Oil/EtOH vehicle was prepared by combining 100 ml of Cremophor Oil with 100 ml of EtOH and mixing until a homogenous solution (no visible phases) was achieved.\nAlzet mini-osmotic pumps model #2004 (200 \u03bcl, 0.25 \u03bcl/hr; Durect Corp; Cupertino, CA) were used to infuse Taxol or vehicle (Cremaphor Oil/ETOH). To fill the pumps, the Taxol stock vial solution was diluted in the Cremophor Oil /EtOH mix (50 \u03bcM to achieve a rate of delivery of 256 ng Taxol/24 hrs). After mixing, the solution was allowed to settle to remove bubbles. To avoid interfering with the osmotic function of the pumps, care was taken to prevent Taxol or vehicle from contacting external surfaces of the pump during loading. If solution came into contact with the external pump surface, the pump was discarded. Pumps were primed before use in animals by submerging in sterile 0.9% saline in 50 ml cell culture tubes at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours.\n\nPreparing custom intrathecal catheters\nTo ensure consistent intrathecal infusion of Taxol or vehicle, catheters were prepared according detailed designs provided by Dr. Hellal who developed this design through an iterative process over several years. Through discussion with her, we learned that conventional intrathecal catheters did not provide optimal delivery of Taxol solution or EtOH/Cremophor vehicle. All preparation details and materials are described in the legend that accompanies\nFig. 1\n.\n\nSpinal cord injury modeling and intrathecal delivery of drug or vehicle\nTo minimize variability between groups and different experiments, a single individual performed all laminectomies and spinal cord injuries. Immediately post-injury a second laminectomy was performed at T\n12/13\nto allow insertion of the intrathecal catheter. Two expert surgeons performed catheter insertions and pump placements with equal distribution between surgeons and experimental groups. Surgeons were blinded to experimental groups. Female Sprague\u2013Dawley (SD) rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN), ~10 weeks old and ~215 g were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail (80/10 mg/kg, i.p.). Hellal et al. used Dormitor (medetomidine hydrochloride) instead of xylazine, but both drugs are alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (analgesics and muscle relaxants). The skin overlying the thoracic spinal cord was shaved then swabbed with a sequence of betadine scrub, 80% ethanol then betadine solution. Body temperature was maintained at ~37 \u00b0C using a homeothermic blanket (World Precision Instruments; Model ATC1000). After surgery (laminectomy with or without SCI) and catheter placement, the muscle was closed in layers then the skin incision was closed with wound clips. Animals recovered from surgery in cages maintained at 37\u00b0C and received daily injections of Gentocin (5 mg/kg; s.c.) and 2\u20135 ml 0.9% saline (s.c.) for 7 days. Bladders were expressed manually 2x/day until spontaneous voiding returned.\nDorsal spinal hemisection (DHx) injury\nTo create DHx lesions similar to those described in Hellal et al., iridectomy scissors (Fine Science Tools: cat# 15000-03; Foster City, CA) were modified based on instructions provided by the original authors. Scissor handles were bent so that the blades started in an open position with a gap of ~2.5-3 mm (\nFig. 2A\n). When placed over the exposed dorsal surface of the spinal cord, closing the scissor handles provided a smooth single action cut of defined depth and width in each animal. Thoracic vertebrae (T6\u2013T13) were exposed via incision and a laminectomy was performed at T9. In order to accommodate the modified iridectomy scissors, a slightly larger laminectomy site was created for DHx as compared to contusion injury (~3.5-4 mm vs 3 mm). The open scissor blades were carefully placed over the mid-line of the dorsal surface of the spinal cord between the intact dura and bone then were quickly closed and immediately released. A single closure of the scissors was used to completely transect the dorsal spinal cord to the depth of the central canal (\nFig. 2B\n).\nFigure 2.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Modified iridectomy scissors (see methods for details) used to create dorsal spinal hemisection (DHx) lesions. (B) Examples of two spinal cords that were \u201cquick-frozen\u201d then scanned to analyze depth and consistency of DHx.\nAfter injury, blunt dissection was used to create a subcutaneous pocket proximal to the base of the tail. Primed osmotic mini-pumps with catheter attached were placed into the pocket then, a second laminectomy was performed at vertebral level T\n12\n. The catheter was inserted into a hole made in the dura then was advanced rostrally until the tip could be seen centered on the dorsal surface of the spinal cord at T9. To secure the catheter tip and prevent rostro-caudal movement, the exposed portion of the catheter at T12 was sutured on both sides of the 2 and 4 mm cuffs (see\nFig. 1\n). Visible portions of the catheter were covered with surrounding fascia and muscle then the muscle overlying the T9 laminectomy site was sutured.\nSpinal contusion injury\nThoracic vertebrae (T\n6\n\u2013T\n10\n) were exposed via incision and a laminectomy was performed at T\n8\n. Injuries were performed using an Infinite Horizons impactor (Precision Systems, Kentucky, IL) equipped with a 2.5 mm tip. The target injury force was 150kDyn. Injury variability was again minimized by designating a single individual for performing all contusions and was monitored by recording the actual force and cord displacement at time of injury. Moving averages and standard deviations for these parameters were reviewed during the day of surgery to ensure that variations in primary trauma were equally distributed between the two experimental groups. After injury, the second laminectomy and pump placement and catheter insertion was the same as for the dorsal hemisection model except that the dura was not opened over the contusion site and the catheter tip was placed just caudal to the visible bruise.\nAfter 28 days the animals were anesthetized via brief (<20 min) inhalation of an isoflurane/O\n2\nmixture and a small incision was made to reveal the pump and its catheter connection. Care was taken to not disturb the catheter. To prevent leakage of CSF as pumps were removed, catheters were sealed by ligation with 4-0 suture before excising the pumps from the catheter. To confirm that excised pumps were functional, they were removed with some tubing attached then placed in 15ml tubes containing 0.9% saline. Any catheters that were found outside of the dura or sutures or that were disconnected from the pump were noted and were used as exclusion criteria (see above). Ligated catheters (no pump) remained in place for the duration of the study then were removed one day after all behavioral tasks were completed.\n\nBehavioral outcome measures\nA grid/ladder walking task was the sole behavioral assay used by Hellal et al. An identical assay was performed in this replication effort; however, this task was supplemented with periodic analysis of open-field locomotion using the Basso\u2013Beattie\u2013Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale (\nBasso et al., 1995\n). Two individuals, who were blind to group assignment, performed all behavioral analyses. BBB scoring was completed at 1, 3, 5 and 7dpi and then weekly thereafter for 8 weeks. Contusion injured rats also were evaluated on a ladder/grid walk task at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks post-injury. For the grid task, rats crossed a 1 m long horizontal runway with walls 10 cm high outfitted with rungs elevated approximately 15 cm from the ground. Rungs were placed at irregular intervals (1-4 cm spacing) to prevent habituation and were changed for every testing session. Rung distance interval was randomly determined for each time point using GraphPad's\nQuickCalcs\nsoftware. Each animal crossed the grid twice (2 trials). All trials were recorded using a Sony HDR-SR11 HD 1080 video camera. An individual rater, unaware of treatment or group designation, evaluated each hind limb for mistakes (combination of complete misses and/or slips from the rungs) from videos via slow motion playback. All analyses were performed over a defined sector (60 cm) containing a fixed number of rungs.\nAnimals also were evaluated for spontaneous activity for 15 different parameters, using an activity monitoring device (Opto-M3, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Animals were placed in activity boxes for 30\u2019. Data for each 30\u2019 period was divided into three 10\u2019 segments. Animals were tested pre-injury and then at 1, 3, 5 and 7 weeks post injury. If BBB testing occurred on a day when other behavioral testing was scheduled (activity box or ladder/grid) then a minimum of 2 hours elapsed before the second test. BBB open field scores were always evaluated first.\n\nHistological outcomes\nAt 7 (phase 1) or 56 (phase 2) days post-injury (dpi), rats were anesthetized with ketamine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine (15 mg/kg) then were euthanized via intracardiac perfusion with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. A 15 mm segment of spinal cord centered on the injury site was removed, post-fixed for 2h in 4% PFA, rinsed overnight in 0.2M PBS, equilibrated in 30% sucrose then embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) Tissue-Tek\u2122 media. Longitudinal sections of 25 \u03bcm thickness were cut in the sagittal plane and mounted on glass slides in adjacent series such that each specimen had 10 adjacent series of equally spaced sections ~250 \u03bcm apart. Slides with sections from all specimens were stained at the same time with the same solutions. An investigator with no knowledge of treatment group did all staining and quantification of histology. Spinal cords from rats that were excluded based on pump or catheter anomalies were not analyzed.\nTo identify matrix and cellular markers associated with scar formation, sections through the lesion site were stained with primary antibodies listed in\nTable 1\n. AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for detection. Replicating the approach used by Hellal et al., for quantitative analysis, wide-field fluorescent images containing the full lesion site were collected from three sections using a 2.5\u00d7 objective and Sony 970 CCD integrating camera. For each specimen, 3 images were measured including the center-most section (area of greatest damage) and sections 250 \u03bcm left and right of center. An MCID Elite 7.0 image analysis system (Imaging Research) was used to capture and analyze digital images.\nTable 1.\nPrimary antibodies and dilutions used for immunohistochemistry\nAntigen\nAntibody\nRecognizes\nSpecies and Isotype\nSource\nCat # Lot #\nDilution\nCollagen IV\nPurified polyclonal\nMouse tumor collagen IV\nRabbit polyclonal\nMillipore\nAB756P-NG1853860\n1:400\nLaminin\nAffinity purified polyclonal\nEHS mouse sarcoma\nRabbit polyclonal\nSigma-Aldrich\nL9393-041M4799\n1:400\nFibronectin\nAffinity purified polyclonal\nHuman fibonectin\nRabbit polyclonal\nSigma-Aldrich\nF3648-051M4777\n1:200\nCSPG-GAGs\nClone CS56 ascites\nChicken fibroblast CSPGs\nMouse IgM\nSigma-Aldrich\nC8035-071M4864\n1:200\nGFAP\nChicken purified polyclonal\nRecombinant GFAP\nChicken IgY\nAves Labs\nGFAP-NA\n1:200\nGFAP\nRabbit polyclonal\nCow spinal cord GFAP\nRabbit polyclonal\nDako\nZ0334-096\n1:2000\n5-HT\nGoat polyclonal\n5-HT coupled to BSA and PFA\nGoat IgG polyclonal\nImmunostar\n20079-947001\n1:2000\nNeurofilament\nChicken purified polyclonal\nBovine NF-200 kDa\nChicken IgY\nAves Labs\nNFH-HS0506\n1:200\nNG-2\nImmunopurified polyclonal\nRat NG2\nRabbit polyclonal\nMillipore\nAB5320-2000807\n1:200\nSecondary Antibodies\nAlexafluor goat anti-rabbit 488\n1:200; 1:400; 1:500; 1:1000\nAlexafluor goat anti-rabbit 546\n1:200\nAlexafluor goat anti-chicken 568\n1:400; 1:500\nAlexafluor goat anti-mouse IgM 488\n1:200\nAlexafluor donkey anti-goat 546\n1:200\nOpen in a new tab\nLesion size was determined from a series of equally spaced sections spanning the full length and width of the spinal cord and centered on the injury site. Sections were stained with modified Eriochrome Cyanine and Cresyl Violet (EC/CV). A digital image of each section was collected using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope and 10x objective equipped with Sony CCD970 camera. Lesion area and maximal dorso-ventral height of the hemisection lesions were measured on digital images of the center most section using MCID. Lesion volumes were then calculated using a modification of the Cavalieri principle, where Volume = sum of (lesion area (pixels converted to \u03bcm\n2\n) * slice thickness (distance between sections in \u03bcm)) for ~10 evenly spaced sections with a random start, and spanning the full left-right extent of the spinal cord. Collagen IV, fibronectin and laminin labeling was quantified within DHx lesions using methods as described by Hellal et al (\nHellal et al., 2011\n). A sample box of 3.2 mm\n2\nwas placed in the center of the injury on each image, and the proportional area of positive staining was determined for each section. Values for 3 sections per specimen (from the center of the lesion and 250 \u03bcm on either side of center) were averaged to obtain 1 value per animal. The treatment code was then broken and each value was expressed as a percentage of the mean value for the vehicle treatment group. For analysis of these features in a contusion lesion (not included in Hellal et al.), the approach was similar, but due to variations in the topography of the central necrotic region, the target stain area was measured using a 5\u00d7 objective and expressed as a proportion of the total area of the lesion bounded by reactive astrocytes.\nAntibodies specific for chondroitin sulfate (clone CS-56) were used to label chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), i.e., inhibitory molecules that increase at the lesion site following SCI. The area of CS-56-staining was measured within a sample box of 1.28 mm\n2\n(1.4 mm \u00d7 0.9 mm) that spanned the dorsal-ventral extent at the rostral and caudal borders of the contusion lesion site. Data are expressed as a proportional area, i.e., CS-56+ labeling/area of sample box.\nHellal et al also used an integer rating scale to score glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocyte reactivity in hemisection lesions (phase 1). Three sections per animal were viewed in a wide-field fluorescence microscope and each 200 \u03bcm distance from the lesion edge was qualitatively scored with a 0, 1, 2, or 3 where 0 = not different from na\u00efve GFAP staining; 1 = evidence of astrocyte morphological change or orientation; 2 = obvious hypertrophy and some overlap of thick GFAP+ processes; 3 = dense meshwork of GFAP+ processes and presence of a basal lamina (\nHellal et al., 2011\n;\nHsu et al., 2006\n). The average fluorescence intensity of GFAP+ staining adjacent to the lesion edge also was measured using MCID density analysis software. For this measure, a sample box of 0.04 mm\n2\nwas positioned directly over the rostral lesion border and the recorded intensity expressed in arbitrary units. Fluorescence intensity for fibronectin staining also was recorded. All intensity measures were performed during a single analysis session with identical light, filter, camera and software settings.\nAnti-5HT antibodies were used to label serotonergic fibers at 56 dpi in contusion lesion specimens. 5HT+ axons were quantified using the method of Hellal et al. A sample field including only the dorsal half of the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site was examined with a wide-field fluorescent microscope and 40\u00d7 objective. All 5-HT positive axon profiles within the sample region were tallied for each of 3 sections per specimen.\nFor illustrations, bright-field images were collected using the MCID analysis system and saved in .TIF format. Fluorescence images for illustrations were obtained by confocal microscopy using an Olympus FV1000 spectral scanning laser microscope with appropriate filters. For illustration of the large contusion lesion sections, multiple confocal images were collected using a 10\u00d7 air objective. Final images were assembled using Photoshop Photomerge\u00ae (Adobe, Inc.). In some cases, brightness and/or contrast settings were adjusted for illustrations only; when these were applied, identical settings were used for representative vehicle and Taxol specimen images.\n\nStatistical analysis\nInvestigators without knowledge of treatment acquired all data. After breaking the treatment code, placeholder group designations were assigned (X or Y) during data analysis. Data analyses were performed using Prism 5.0 (Graphpad Software, Inc.). All comparisons between treatment groups were made using Student's t-tests (two-sided). In some instances, the calculated group variances were heterogeneous, so Welch's correction was applied to the comparison test. For comparisons where multiple measures were made from the same specimen (e.g., CS-56 staining rostral and caudal to the lesion), 2-way ANOVA with repeated measures was used to determine main effects of site and treatment. Differences were considered significant when\np\nwas\n\u22640.05\n. To be consistent with data presentation in Hellal et al., all data are presented as mean values \u00b1 SEM."

    "Methods": "2.1 Animals\nMale weanling (postnatal day 21) Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis IN) were randomly divided into a control group fed an iron-sufficient diet (80 \u00b5g iron/g diet) and an ID group fed a low iron diet (4 \u00b5g iron/g diet). The 4 \u00b5g iron/g diet maintained for 5-6 weeks has been shown in prior studies to produce a decrease in VMB iron in Sprague-Dawley rats (\nBianco, et al., 2008\n;\nUnger, et al., 2008\n). Control and ID diets were prepared in our laboratory as described previously (\nReeves, et al., 1993\n). The ID diet contained all components of the control diet with the exception of ferric citrate. Rats consumed control or ID diets for 5 weeks, and were provided food and deionized distilled water\nad libitum\nthroughout the study. All rats were housed 2 per cage in a temperature (21 \u00b12\u00b0C) and humidity (40%) controlled room maintained on a 12:12 hr light/dark cycle (lights on at 0600) until surgeries were performed. Post-surgery, rats were housed 1 per cage and continued on a 12:12 hr light/dark cycle throughout the microdialysis experiments. Experimental protocols were in accordance with the NIH Animal Care guidelines and were approved by the Pennsylvania State Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n2.2 Surgery\nRats were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane, and the top of the head was shaved and sterilized with providone/iodine and 70% ethanol. After placement on a stereotaxic frame (Stoeltig, Wood Dale, Il), the skull was exposed and bregma identified. A hole was drilled through the skull, and a CMA 11 guide cannula was implanted into the striatum of all control and ID rats as previously described (\nBianco, et al., 2008\n). The coordinates used were: A \u22120.2 mm, L \u22122.8 mm, and V \u22125.3 mm. In a subset of rats from each diet group, a second guide cannula for iron infusions was implanted in the substantia nigra following the same protocol. The coordinates used for substantia nigra were: A 2.0 mm, L \u22126.5mm, V \u22125.7 mm. All rats received a sham surgery in the region of iron infusion in the contra-lateral side of the brain.\nAfter 3\u20135 day recovery time, rats were lightly anesthetized with 25.0/2.0/0.5 mg/kg ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine. A CMA 11 (2 mm) probe was then inserted into the guide cannula implanted in the striatum of all rats. In rats with a guide cannula implanted in substantia nigra, an infusion cannula (2 mm) was inserted into the guide cannula. The rats were allowed to recover overnight with a slow perfusion of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; 1.3 \u00b5L/min) into the microdialysis probe (\nBianco, et al., 2008\n).\n\n2.3 NNF/Quinpirole NNF\nThe No-Net-Flux (NNF) microdialysis technique provides quantitative real-time\nin vivo\ndetermination of extracellular neurotransmitter concentrations by utilizing the principle of diffusion, which takes into account both diffusion and catabolism (\nMefford, 1981\n;\nRefshauge, et al., 1974\n). In this study, two primary measures of extracellular DA are determined from NNF technique: extraction fraction and the extracellular DA concentration (\nBungay, et al., 2003\n;\nChefer, et al., 2006\n). The extraction fraction has been shown to reflect primarily DAT-dependent neurotransmitter uptake (\nSmith and Justice, 1994\n) and has been used as an estimate of DAT function (\nBianco, et al., 2008\n). For greater details of the NNF technique and its application, see our prior publication (\nBianco, et al., 2008\n) but in brief, artificial CSF samples containing 100, 50, 20, and 10 nM DA were infused into the brain via the microdialysis probe as described previously (\nBianco, et al., 2008\n;\nChefer, et al., 2006\n). Each concentration of DA was perfused for 75 min, with a random ordering for each rat. The perfusate was collected continuously into a loading loop on the HPLC and injected in 15 min intervals. After the last concentration of DA for NNF was perfused, a potent DA-2/3 receptor agonist, quinpirole (5 \u00b5M), was added to the perfusate. NNF was performed after equilibration (1.5 hr) using 100, 50, 20, and 10 nM DA + 5 \u00b5M quinpirole in artificial CSF. This equilibration time for quinpirole was chosen based on previous studies, which demonstrated that the maximal effect of quinpirole occurs 1-2 hr after perfusion is initiated (\nMao, et al., 1996\n;\nSee, et al., 1991\n). Quinpirole through its agonist effects on DA-2/3 receptors and subsequent feedback to pre-synaptic mechanism will decrease DA release and increase membrane-bound DAT and extraction of DA from the extracellular space (\nBolan, et al., 2007\n;\nCooper, et al., 2008\n;\nRobinson, 2002\n). Used within the context of the NNF techniques, it provides an assessment of the integrity of the feedback-loop mechanism that can modify pre-synaptic functions like DAT density and DA release.\n\n2.4 Iron Infusion\nFerrous sulfate (FeSO\n4\n, 1 \u00b5M) was infused as described previously at a rate used in previous studies (\nPrikhojan, et al., 2002\n;\nSantiago, et al., 2000\n) of 1.3 \u00b5L/min for 20 min resulting in the delivery of 26 picomole (pmol) of iron into the extracellular space. This concentration of extracellular iron is within the physiological range seen with the circadian peak-to-trough differences in extracellular VMB iron (\nUnger, et al., 2013\n). In a previous study, infusion of 10-100 \u00b5M FeCl\n3\ninto the striatum did not cause lipid peroxidation or affect neuronal health (\nSantiago, et al., 2000\n). The infusion of iron into the substantia nigra was started at 2400 hr and into the striatum at 0600 hr, with the NNF/Quinpirole NNF experiment being performed starting at 0600 hr. In the contra-lateral brain region, sterile saline was perfused under the same conditions. As has been previously described (\nBianco, et al., 2008\n;\nConnor, et al., 1992\n), verification of cannula placement and distance of iron diffusion was determined with cytology and iron histochemistry, respectively. The distance of iron diffusion was on average about 350 \u00b5m from the infusion site.\n\n2.5 High Performance Liquid Chromatography\nDialysate samples (10 \u00b5l) were injected every 15 min onto an ESA MD-150 narrow-bore HPLC column 150\u00d72 mm (ESA Inc., Chelmsford, MA) for separation followed by detection by an ESA 5014B microdialysis cell (+300 mV; ESA Coulochem III, ESA, Inc., Chelmsford, MA). A guard cell (ESA 5020) placed in line before the injection loop was set at a potential of +350 mV. The mobile phase consisted of 75 mM sodium phosphate monobasic (EMD Chemical, Gibbstown, NJ), 1.7 mM 1-octanesulfonic acid (EMD Chemical), 25 \u00b5M EDTA (Acros, Morris Plains, NJ), 10% acetonitrile (EMD), and 0.01% triethylamine (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in a volume of 1L (pH 3.0). The neurotransmitter and metabolite peak areas were integrated using EZ Chrom Elite software (Scientific Software Inc, Pleasanton, CA) and quantified against known standards of dopamine (DA) (ESA Inc., Chelmsford, MA), DA (ESA Inc.), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC; Sigma Aldrich), and homovanillic acid (HVA; Sigma Aldrich).\n\n2.6 Tissue collection and hematology\nBrains were removed from the skull and dissected for striatum and VMB on ice. Brain regions were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until prepared for iron or monoamine analysis. Blood was collected at sacrifice into heparinized microcapillary tubes and used for the determination of hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct). The Hgb was determined photometrically using cyanomethemoglobin standard solution as described by the manufacturer (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis MO) and the Hct was calculated after centrifugation of blood samples (9000\u00d7g, RT, 10 min).\n\n2.7 Tissue preparation\nThe striatum (caudate-putamen) and VMB were homogenized in cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 9.1 mmol/L Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 1.7 mmol/L NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 150 mmol/L NaCl, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors (Roche, Mannheim Germany). The resulting homogenates were aliquoted for iron analysis by atomic absorption spectroscopy and catecholamine analysis by HPLC (\nBianco, et al., 2008\n;\nUnger, et al., 2007\n).\n\n2.8 Lipid Peroxidation\nLipid peroxidation was determined in brain region homogenates by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay as described by (\nOhkawa, et al., 1979\n). TBARS levels in samples were measured at an absorbance of 532 nm and calculated using malondialdehyde standards.\n\n2.9 Statistical Analysis\nThe first hypothesis to be tested in this study was that ID-diet, which produces low VMB iron, will result in altered striatal dopaminergic dynamics. The dietary condition (normal vs iron-deficient) was the independent variable and primary dependent variables were the measures of striatal dopaminergic dynamics: extracellular DA, DA extraction from the extracellular space and the response of these two factors to quinpirole. Total striatal concentration of DA and its metabolites were used as a secondary measure of striatal dopaminergic dynamic. Our second hypothesis was that small but physiological increases in VMB extracellular iron can reverse the changes in striatal DAergic function seen with diet-induced, low brain iron. Infusion of iron into the striatum was exploratory. Data are presented as means \u00b1SEM. One-sided, t-test (Microsoft, Excel) was used to test the effect of ID diet on decreasing Hgb, Hct, VMB iron and striatal iron. ANOVA was used to test the effects of VMB iron infusion and diet condition. Diet effects were also tested by one-way ANOVA for iron treatment and brain region. A two-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test was used to analyze the microdialysis data (SYSTAT, Systat Software INC, Richmond CA)."

    "Methods": "General plan of experiments\nNew Zealand White pregnant rabbits (Myrtle's Rabbits, TN) were allowed to deliver in a nest box at term (31.5 days). Rabbit kits were fed by dam and allowed to grow till P18. Newborn rabbit kits are rather immature at birth in their sensory and motor development (\nHudson and Distel, 1986\n). Rabbit kits are born naked, with eyes not open, outer ears not developed, and poor motor coordination. By day 7 they are capable of limited oriental response to auditory stimuli and begin to open their eyes on day 9 or 10. Kits start to leave the nest when 13 to 18 days old, by which time they are able to maintain a stable body temperature and have much improved motor coordination. New Zealand rabbits sexually mature at 6 month. The study followed a longitudinal design, starting from postnatal age day 1 (P1), when kits exhibit poor motor abilities and myelination has not yet begun , through P11, when kits open eyes and show more motor abilities, to P18 when kits show adult-like motor abilities and myelination is at an advanced stage. Rabbit dams were processed to obtain adult data.\nAt P1, P11 and P18, the kits underwent serial\nin-vivo\nMRI examination. After each MRI session at P1, P11 and P18, brains from a subset of kits were extirpated for electrophysiological recordings, followed by electron microscopy. The methodology of the study was focused to reveal intricate connection between changes in microstructural organization of the maturing central WM and functional properties of the tracts. We put special emphasis to co-register structural and functional measurements, taking into account the different spatial scales of the techniques such as DTI, electron microscopy and localized CAP recording on brain slices. The order of studies and sampling procedures was arranged so that the measurement sites in WM were co-registered for MRI first, then electrophysiology and histological examinations were conducted using anatomical landmarks (\nFigure 1\n).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nPlacement of MRI and vibratome sections for co-registration of MRI, electrophysiological and histopathology sites. A. DTI slices (blue) were oriented orthogonal to frontal cortex pole \u2013pons plane (solid white line) on a sagittal MRI image. Sections for electrophysiological recordings (white) were orthogonal to the DTI slices. B,C. Placement of stimulating electrodes (bipolar wire) and recording (glass pipette) electrodes were recorded with the reference to AC tract and the brain midline landmarks. Corresponding sections are shown for AC and IC recordings (B) and CC recordings (C). D. WM ROIs of interest were delineated using a semiautomatic region-growing procedure with manual placement of seed points on corresponding coronal directional color coded FA maps at P18. Scale bar 1 mm. Insert represents color coding of the fiber orientation, i.e. red indicates left-right, green indicates superior-inferior and blue indicates rostro-caudal orientation. E. After electrophysiological recordings, IC was dissected out from the slice, and sectioned across the tract for further EM studies. Scale bar 2 \u03bcm.\n\nMRI methods\nRabbit kits were sedated with i.m. injection of a mixture of Ketamine (35 mg/kg), Xylazine (5 mg/kg), and Acepromazine (1.0 mg/kg). Animals were placed supine in a cradle heated with a water blanket at 35\u00b0 C and imaged in a 9.4 T Bruker Biospec system (Bruker, Billerica, MA). The receiver coil was a standard linear Bruker rat brain size coil allowing full brain coverage in P1-P18 rabbits. Number of kits was 11 for P1, 8 for P11, 8 for P18. Three rabbit dams were imaged in the same magnet using 50 mm transceiver surface coil. A modified futility design was used to calculate the number of animals in order to detect a difference of between P1 and P11 of a difference = S.D. with alpha=0.05 and power=0.85.\nDTI experiments consisted of 15 non-collinear directions diffusion weighted images with TR/TE/NEX 2500/26/4 matrix 128\u00d764, zero-padded to 128\u00d7128, \u03b4 = 5 ms, \u0394 = 15 ms, with b=0 and 0.8 ms/\u03bcm\n2\n. The brain was divided in to 12 oblique coronal brain slices, positioned on a sagittal localizer scan in a way that the fifth slice was on anterior commissure and the last slice was crossing anterior edge of superior colliculus. The number of slices was kept constant for all age groups to cover the same area of cerebrum. Slice thickness was therefore variable across individual and age groups and was about 1 mm for P1, P11, 1.2 mm for P18 kits, and 1.5 mm for adults. In-plane resolution after interpolation was 0.156 mm for P1 and 0.195 mm for P11 and P18 kits. To ensure reproducible pitch angle on oblique coronal imaging sections, slices were oriented orthogonal to frontal cortex pole \u2013pons plane as determined with the aid of multi-slice sagittal localizer scan (\nFigure 1\n). Diffusion tensor was calculated using multivariate linear fitting of signal attenuation from the acquired diffusion weighted images (\nBasser and Jones, 2002\n). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial (first eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor) and radial (average of the second and third eigenvalues) diffusivities (\nSong et al., 2002\n), and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were calculated (\nBasser et al., 1994\n) using in-house software written on Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA).\nT2 relaxation time measurement was performed using spin echo multi-echo sequence with TR of 4000 ms and 8 echo times varying from 20 to 160 ms with the same geometry parameters as in DTI experiment. T2 maps were obtained by fitting mono-exponential signal decay curve in the T2-weighted images with different echo times.\nHigh resolution sagittal T2-weighted images (RARE sequence, TR/TE/NEX 4000/90/6 matrix 256\u00d7128, zero-filled to 256\u00d7256, 1 mm slice thickness) were obtained to measure cross section areas of the commissural fiber tracts.\n\nRegion of interest analysis\nRegions of interest (ROIs) of internal capsule (IC), fimbria hippocampi (FH), anterior commissure (AC) and corpus callosum (CC) were outlined using semi-automated routine written in Matlab. Single seeding voxel was manually selected by clicking on a structure of interest on a directionally color encoded FA maps (\nPajevic and Pierpaoli, 1999\n), by an observer blinded to group assignment. ROIs were systematically placed on 5\nth\nslice for AC, 7\nth\nslice for FC, 8\nth\nslice for IC and CC in rostro-caudal direction (\nFig. 1D\n). The ROIs boundary were outlined by a region growing procedure on a single slice using FA and fiber orientation (\nSun et al., 2003\n). Empirically chosen cutoff values of 0.3 for FA and 0.94 for the inner product between primary eigenvectors for neighboring voxels allowed robust segmentation of CC, IC and FI of P1-P18 rabbit kits. ROIs were transferred to the maps of DTI and T2 derived metrics and average values were obtained for each tract, as well as the cross section areas of different tracts. For CC and AC, cross section measurements ROIs were manually outlined on T2-weighted sagittal images.\n\nElectrophysiology methods\nThe whole brain of control rabbits kits (7 for P1, 5 for P11, 8 for P18, and 3 adults) was quickly removed from the skull and placed into ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), oxygenated with 95% O\n2\n-5% CO\n2\n, and at pH = 7.4. ACSF consisted of, in mM : NaCl 124, KCl 3, CaCl\n2\n2.4, MgSO\n4\n1.3, NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n1.25, NaHCO\n3\n26, and glucose 10. Series of horizontal slices 400 \u03bcm thick were cut on a vibratome and contained, in order of slices superior to inferior, CC, FH, IC, and AC at the level of IC. Slices positions, recorded tracts locations and coordinate system for the further co-registration of the recorded sites with MRI data are presented on\nFigure 1A\n. The slices were allowed to recover in oxygenated ACSF at room temperature for 45-60 min before recording. The slices were transferred as needed to a recording chamber, perfused with oxygenated ACSF with 95% O\n2\n-5% CO\n2\n, at flow rate 1-2 mL/min and maintained at 21\u00b0C. Bipolar stimulating (constructed of twisted Teflon-coated platinum-iridium wire, diameter 0.025 mm) and recording (glass capillary extracellular microelectrode, 10 \u03bcm diameter, 1-2 M\u03a9, filled with 3M NaCl) electrodes were inserted in the middle portion of the CC or IC along fiber course. Recordings from IC and FH were done in the similar manner on the left and right hemispheres separately and averaged. Compound action potential in central white matter remains stable in an oxygenated perfused slice preparation for more than 10 hours, as has been shown ion adult mice at 33\u00b0C (\nTekkok and Goldberg, 2001\n). In our preliminary studies the magnitude and temporal characteristics of CAP were stable for at least 8 hours, while the actual recordings were done within 2-3 hours after 1 hour recovery period.\nCompound action potential (CAP) was evoked using current steps with duration of 50 \u03bcs and an amplitude 2 mA. Stimulation amplitude was selected to be slightly below the level required for a maximum response for all age groups, since the maximum response was often difficult to reach. Recorded CAPs were amplified 1000x, digitized at 8 kHz, band pass filtered (0.3 Hz-10 kHz) and acquired using pClamp 8.1 (Axon Instruments, CA) software.\nRecording was done at 4 fixed distances between electrodes, spaced between 360, 480, 600, and 720 \u03bcm for P1 and P11 kits, measured by a reticle placed in microscope eyepiece. To ensure that the responses belonged to the same fiber, recordings started from the farthest distance. Once a positive signal was obtained, subsequent recordings were obtained at progressively shorter inter-electrode distances on a straight line to the stimulating electrode. For P18 kits and adults rabbits, the inter-electrode distances were increased to 1080, 1200, 1320, and 1440 \u03bcm for better separation of waveforms appearing at these ages especially for double and triple peaks that appeared, which was elicited from faster myelinated fibers. Again, for each site the measurements started with the furthest inter-electrode distance. Once a signal was obtained and a recording obtained, three other recordings were performed at 3 intervals in a straight line from the furthest distance to the stimulating electrode. Recordings also had to satisfy the condition of shortened latency and increasing amplitude or height, thus ensuring that all four recording were obtained along the same fiber tract (\nFig. 2\n). If these conditions were not satisfied, we did not analyze these recordings because of uncertainty of the recordings being from a single tract. The measurements of CV were repeated at 3 separate sites for each fiber tract by moving stimulating and recording electrodes within 1-2 mm range from the previous successful recording. The data was then averaged for each tract. This way we ensured that we got an accurate representation of the population in a major tract. Linear regression analysis between inter-electrode distance and CAP arrival time, as determined by the peak latency of the negative component of CAP, was then performed. From the linear regression line, the inverse slope and intercept determined the CAP conduction velocity (CV) and CAP latency intercept respectively. The use of linear regression thus, minimizes the error from intra-animal variability.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nCAP recordings in internal capsule on perfused brain slices and determination of conduction velocity of myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. Shorter latency peak on responses with dual peak (A) was attributed to myelinated axons and longer latency peak \u2013to unmyelinated axons. CAPs from the same fibers were registered on four distances between recording and stimulating electrodes. Linear regression fit of the response latency vs. recording distance (B) yielded indices of conduction velocity and CAP response latency intercept.\nAt the end of electrophysiological measurements, digital photographs of the slices were taken and position of the electrodes were recorded in relation to the anatomical landmarks, such as hemisphere midline and IC (\nFigure. 1B,C\n) for co-registration with of electrophysiological data with MRI, electron microscopy and OL count. To mark left and right side a small nick was made at the slice corner. Slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours. WM tracts were then identified using characteristic striation under operation microscope, dissected out with a sharp blade and embedded in 2% agarose block in known orientation and then processed for EM.\n\nElectron microscopy\nFor each fiber tract, a 0.5-mm block was cut perpendicular to the fiber course, corresponding to the position between electrophysiological electrodes in IC and processed for electron microscopy. Samples were obtained from the left IC and the number of samples was 3 at P1, 3 at P11, 6 at P18 and 3 dams. All tissue processing for EM was done with tissue embedded in agarose to preserve cross-section fiber orientation (\nFigure 1E\n). Slices were additionally post fixed in mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde, osmicated, dehydrated and embedded in Spurr's resin between Aclar sheets (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA). Sections across the fibers, 0.7 nm thick, were cut on an ultramicrotome and imaged on JEOL 1230 Transmission Electron Microscope. At least ten fields of view at 20,000 magnification were taken in random locations across the fiber tract section. Number and cross section areas of myelinated and unmyelinated axons were quantified for each tract using StereoInvestigator (v. 8.26, MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT, USA) software and fractionator and Cavalieri stereological probes. The density of myelinated and unmyelinated axons, proportion of myelinated fibers and myelinated area were determined as outcome measures. The degenerating axon were distinguished by the inclusion of electron-dense bodies or multi-lamellar membranous structures with a circular or irregular contour (\nHsu et al., 2006\n).\nTotal axon count in internal capsule was estimated as a product of axonal density from EM and the tract cross section area on MRI.\nIn vivo\ntract area by MRI was used as a more reliable and technologically feasible measure rather than area on fixed slice by EM. This method may however slightly overestimate axonal density and absolute axonal number due to tissue shrinkage during processing for EM. The tissue shrinkage may be relatively larger in younger kits due to the larger proportion of extracellular space.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nValues are expressed as Mean \u00b1 SEM. Longitudinal data were analyzed with repeated measure ANOVA. Alpha error was =0.05. Statistical analysis was done using SigmaStat 3.5 and MATLAB statistical toolbox."

    "Methods": "Animals\nOne hundred and four adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (220\u2013250g) were assigned randomly into six groups: (1) sham control group (laminectomy only; n=13); (2) Tx-only group (T8 spinal cord transection only; n=49); (3) sham + control lentivirus (pGipz) group (laminectomy only with pGipz injection; n=9); (4) Tx + pGpiz group (T8 spinal cord transection with pGipz injection; n=12); (5) sham + lentivirus carrying shSOCS3 (shSOCS3) group (laminectomy only and shSOCS3 injection; n=9); (6) Tx + shSOCS3 group (T8 spinal cord transection and shSOCS3 injection; n=12). Rats were housed in standard laboratory cages with a 12:12 hour light/dark cycle with standard rodent chow and water available\nad libitum\n. The experiments were performed during the light cycle. All animal procedures were approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n\nSpinal cord surgery and delivery of shSOCS3 to the spinal cord\nAll surgical procedures were conducted under aseptic conditions. Before surgery, all animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane gas mixed with oxygen. Rats were maintained on a heating pad and rectal temperature was monitored and maintained within \u00b1 1.5\u00b0C of 36.5\u00b0C during surgery. Animals in the sham control group underwent a laminectomy only (T8 level). In the Tx-only group, a laminectomy was also performed, followed by complete transverse cuts of the spinal cord at the T8 level, resulting in a gap of ~2\u20133 mm. A surgical microscope was used to ensure the complete removal of neural tissue, including fiber bundles. Muscle and skin layers were closed with 2-0 sutures. The bladders of all spinal cord-transected rats were expressed manually twice per day throughout the experimental period.\nA lentiviral plasmid encoding shRNA specific for SOCS3 to knock down SOCS3 expression, shSOCS3/pGpiz, was obtained from Dr. Etty Benveniste (University of Alabama at Birmingham). Briefly, as previously described (\nPark et al., 2012\n), lentiviral particles were generated by calcium phosphate-mediated co-transfection of HEK-293T cells with empty pGipz or shSOCS3/pGpiz, psPAX2 (Packaging plasmid), and pMD2G (Envelope plasmid). Virus was collected after 72 h and titers up to 3\u20134\u00d710\n9\ninfectious units/ml were obtained.\nFor lentiviral injections into the spinal cord, a laminectomy was performed at T8, followed by insertion of a pored glass pipette attached to a microinjector into the gray matter of the spinal cord. The target areas for injection included four total sites at the following coordinates: two sites 2.5 mm rostral and two sites 2.5 mm caudal to the injury site; depth was 2 mm below the spinal cord at each site. Infusions were made at a rate of 133nl /min for pGipz or shSOCS3 containing lentivirus (2\u00d710\n7\ntotal infectious units in 4 \u00b5l). After injection, the glass pipette was left in place for an additional 2 min before being slowly retracted. In the sham + pGipz group, Tx + pGipz group, sham + shSOCS3 group, and Tx + shSOCS3 group, lentiviral delivery into the spinal cord was performed 2 weeks before the T8 spinal cord transection or sham procedure.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAnimals were anesthetized at the indicated time points (1, 2, 4, 7 or 14 days) after SCI and transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Spinal cord tissues were removed, post-fixed overnight at 4 \u00b0C in buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, and stored at 4 \u00b0C in 30% sucrose solution until sinking. The tissues were then transversely sectioned (30 \u00b5m) and collected using a cryostat. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (\nLee et al., 2013\n). Briefly, free-floating serial sections were rinsed three times for 10 min with PBS and blocked with PBS containing 3% normal horse serum and 0.25% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, the sections were incubated overnight with gentle agitation at room temperature with PBS containing 0.5% BSA in the following antibody combinations: the neuronal-specific nuclear protein NeuN (1:5000; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) for neurons with SOCS3 (1:1,000; abcam, Cambridge, MA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for astrocytes (1:4,000; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) with SOCS3, OX-42 (1:1,000; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL), which recognizes complement receptor 3, with SOCS3, NeuN with phosphorylated STAT3 Tyr 705 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), or NeuN with cleaved caspase-3 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology). Sections were then rinsed in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody conjugated by Alexa Flour 488 or 594 as appropriate (1:2,000; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Tissues were then washed and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratory, Burlingame, CA). Sections were examined and all images were taken using a fluorescent microscope (DM6000; Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL).\n\nTUNEL staining\nThe amount of apoptosis was determined by double-staining of TUNEL with NeuN, GFAP, or OX-42. TUNEL assays were performed using the Apoptag fluorescein\nin situ\ndetection kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) that detects the 3\u2032-OH region of cleaved DNA during apoptosis. Briefly, sections of spinal cord tissue were permeabilized with 3% normal horse serum with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The TUNEL reaction mixture was then added; tissue was incubated in a humidified chamber for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and washed with PBS. For double staining, sections were incubated with antibody against NeuN, GFAP, or OX-42 overnight at room temperature. The next day, sections were rinsed with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Flour 594-conjugated secondary antibody (Life Technologies). Tissues were then washed and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratory). Images were collected using a fluorescent microscope (DM6000; Leica Microsystems).\n\nWestern blotting\nSpinal cord tissues were obtained from areas 5 mm rostral and caudal to the epicenter and were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer containing the following (in mM): 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor I & II (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 15 min at 12,000 \u00d7 g and the supernatant was transferred into a new tube. Extracts were stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Equal amounts of protein (50 \u00b5g) were mixed with loading buffer (0.125 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% 2-ME, and 0.002% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (EMD Millipore) using an electrophoretic transfer system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Membranes were then washed with TBS and blocked for 1 h with TBS containing 5% skim milk. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with one of the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-SOCS3 (1:2,000; abcam), rabbit anti-phospho-STAT3 Tyr705 (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-Bax (1:1,000; Cell Signaling), or rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology). After washing, membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000; Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA) and washed again with TBS. Finally, immunoreactivity was developed using Pierce ECL\u00ae or SuperSignal\u00ae West Dura substrate (Thermo Scientific). Blots were then re-probed with antibody against \u03b2-actin (1:4,000; Cell Signaling Technology), STAT3 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), or caspase-3 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology). The densities of bands on immunoblots were measured using ImageJ software for further quantitative analyses.\n\nRNA isolation and quantitative real time-PCR\nSpinal cord tissues were obtained from areas 5 mm rostral and caudal to the epicenter at the indicated time points after injury and total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies). Purified RNA (500 ng) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using Multiscribe reverse transcriptase and random primers (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to determine levels of SOCS3 mRNA was performed as previously described (\nPark et al., 2012\n). Data were analyzed using the comparative cycle threshold method to obtain quantitative values.\n\nQuantitative analysis of spinal cord neurons\nThe number of neurons surrounding the injured spinal cord was assessed by examining sections obtained from areas 4 mm rostral and caudal to the injury site. One of every six serial sections (180 \u00b5m apart) was selected to avoid double cell counting and was immunostained with NeuN antibody to count NeuN-positive neurons (NeuN+ neurons) in the spinal cord. NeuN+ neurons of spinal cord were counted using a fluorescence microscope at a magnification of 200\u00d7 and expressed as the number of total spinal cord neurons in each section. Only neurons with normal visible nuclei stained by DAPI were counted.\n\nMeasurement of the size of NeuN + neurons\nAs described above, one of every six serial sections (180 \u00b5m apart) were selected, immunostained with NeuN antibody, and digital photomicrographs of NeuN+ neurons in the ventral horn area were then taken with a Leica microscope (DM6000). For measurement of neuronal size, pictures were analyzed by LAS AF software (Leica Microsystems) and the diameter of the individual NeuN+ neurons were measured (\nKishino et al., 1997\n). A total of ~200\u2013230 neurons (10\u201312 neurons in each section) in each area rostral and caudal to the injury site were measured and analyzed.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll values are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical significance (p<0.05 for all analyses) between groups was assessed by ANOVA using GraphPad Prism 5.01 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), followed by Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls analyses. All experimental procedures and data analyses were performed in a blinded fashion over the entire study."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale hemizygous SOD1 G93A transgenic rats [Tac:N:(SD)-TgN(SOD1G93A)L26H, obtained from the Emerging Models Program sponsored by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association, Taconic laboratories, Germantown, NY] were bred with wild-type females, and offspring genotyped by PCR analysis (\nHowland et al., 2002\n); wild-type siblings serve as controls for mutant animals. Animals are killed when they can no longer right themselves within 10 s of being pushed on their side. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nSurgical procedures\nIntrathecal infusion studies used rats at 80\u00b12 days of age (body weight 250g-380g). Anesthesia was induced using 5% isoflurane, and maintained at 2.5% at a flow rate of 1 l/min. Catheter and reservoir placement were carried out largely as previously described (\nYin et al., 2007\n). Briefly, an incision was made in the dorsal head and the atlanto-occipital membrane, through which a PE5 catheter was inserted into the subarachnoid space and advanced 7\u201310 cm to the lumbar enlargement. The catheter was connected to an Alzet mini-osmotic pump model 2004; 200 \u03bcl volume, 0.25 \u03bcl/h \u00d7 30 days) which was pre-filled with 5mM BMAA or saline. After surgery, animals were housed individually and body weight recorded daily. In addition, evidence of pain or infection and motor dysfunction were closely monitored. Animals were sacrificed if they appeared distressed or if after 5 days, motor function remained impaired or body weight had not recovered to pre-surgery levels.\n\nTissue preparation and staining\nThirty days after the start of intrathecal infusions, the animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, and perfused transcardially with saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min. The lumbar enlargements of spinal cords were dissected and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h and removed to 30% sucrose/PBS for another 2 days. Serial 20-\u03bcm frozen sections were cut from the middle of the lumbar enlargement for ~ 5 mm in the caudal direction.\nAfter every 10 sections, 3\u20135 serial sections were set aside for staining. Immunohistochemical stains were carried out on floating sections, blocked (10% HS, 1 h), and exposed to primary antibody in 10% HS, 0.3% Triton-X 100 (SMI-32, 1:8000 IP, Sternberger Monoclonals, Berkeley, CA; GLT-1, 1:1000 IF, Chemicon, Temecula, CA; 3-nitrotyrosine, 10 \u03bcg/ml IF, Upstate Biotechnology, Waltham, MA; TDP-43, 1:10,000 IP, Proteintech Group, Chicago, IL). Labeling was visualized either by routine ABC immunoperoxidase techniques or under fluorescence using secondary antibodies linked to fluorophores (Alexafluor 488, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).\n\nQuantification of histopathological changes\nSurviving MNs were counted in ventral horn of lumbar spinal slices from each condition. MNs displaying pyknotic nuclei, marked atrophy or swelling, or fragmentation of the proximal dendrites were not counted as alive (\nFig. 2\n).\nFigure 2. Morphological changes and quantification of lumbar ventral horn MN degeneration induced by the G93A SOD1 mutation and by 30 day BMAA infusions.\nOpen in a new tab\nG93A mutant SOD1 and sibling WT rats were subjected to 30 day intrathecal infusions with BMAA or saline as described, followed by perfusion, sectioning of the lumbar spinal cords and SMI-32 immunostaining for counts of surviving MNs. SMI-32 labeling provides excellent visualization of somatic and dendritic morphology and is thus useful for assessing structural damage.\nTOP\n:\nMorphological changes\n. For each treatment (as indicated), a low power image of a representative SMI-32 stained hemi-section of the lumbar spinal cord (40x) is shown, along with a high power (400x) view of the marked region of ventral horn. As in\nFigure 1\n, above, note the intact somatic and dendritic morphology in the control condition (WT+saline), and the mix of somatic changes with some MNs showing atrophy (thick arrows) and some showing swelling (thin arrows), as well as widespread fragmentation of dendritic processes in the other conditions. Scale bar = 500 \u03bcm (low power panels) or 50 \u03bcm (all other panels).\nBOTTOM:\nQuantification of MNs cell loss. Healthy appearing intact MNs were counted in SMI-32 immunostained slices from each condition. Values represent mean number of intact ventral horn MNs per section (comprising two ventral horns), as assessed by direct microscopic examination. Each data point reflects the mean value from 5-9 animals (WT+BMAA, 9; WT+saline, 6; Tg+saline, 5; Tg+BMAA, 5 animals); all ventral horn MNs were counted in each of 18-23 slices from each animal, with a total of 1700-3500 MNs counted in each condition. *indicates difference from WT animals by two tailed t-test (p<0.001).\nFor examination of 3-NT and GLT-1 labeling staining in the neuropil surrounding ventral horn MNs, care was taken to ensure that all slices from each experiment were labeled using identical simultaneous antibody exposures, and fluorescence photographs taken with identical camera settings so that labeling intensities could be compared. For quantification of GLT-1 labeling, photographs were imported into an image analysis package (Image J, public domain software from the NIH) as 8-bit gray scale images, and two regions were marked around each readily identifiable MN: one precisely outlining the circumference of the MN and another 10 um further out (with any other neurons or neuronal processes masked out). The space between these regions was defined as the\nsurround zone\n. After subtraction of background fluorescence, averaged intensity was calculated within each surround zone.\n\nChemicals and reagents\nBMAA was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Antibodies were from the following sources: SMI-32, Sternberger Monoclonals, Berkeley, CA; GLT-1, Chemicon, Temecula, CA; 3-nitrotyrosine, Upstate Biotechnology, Waltham, MA; TDP-43, Proteintech Group, Chicago, IL. For fluorescence labeling, we used secondary antibodies linked to Alexafluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). All other chemicals and reagents were obtained from common commercial sources."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAdult male\nTrkB\nF616A\nmice (n=49; 31.8 \u00b1 0.7 g) were bred and maintained in a colony at Mayo Clinic.\nTrkB\nF616A\nmice carry a phenylalanine-to-alanine mutation in the ATP binding domain of the TrkB receptor (\nChen, et al., 2005\n). All mice were genotyped by PCR analysis of DNA isolated from tail snips. The PCR amplification was conducted with the following primers (5\u2032-GGGCTTGAGAAGAGGGCAAAAGGGTTGCTCAG-3\u2032) and (5\u2032-GTTGGTCACCAGCAGAACACTCGACTCAC-3\u2032) obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville IA).\nTrkB\nF616A\nmice were used to selectively and rapidly inhibit TrkB kinase activity following 1NMPP1 treatment (\nChen, et al., 2005\n,\nMantilla and Ermilov, 2012\n). All study and animal care guidelines were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Mayo Clinic in accordance with National Institute of Health Guidelines. Mice were given free access to food and water, while maintained on a 12 hour light-dark schedule.\nFor the primary analyses, two groups of\nTrkB\nF616A\nmice underwent C2SH and were randomized 3 days afterwards to receive either 11 days of oral 1NMPP1 treatment (n=14; 25 \u03bcM in drinking water; Calbiochem #529581) or vehicle treatment (n=18; 0.3% DMSO in drinking water). Thus, mice in both groups were studied at 2 weeks following C2SH. In additional analyses,\nTrkB\nF616A\nmice underwent C2SH (n=10) and were studied 3 days following surgery in order to verify that C2SH completely inactivates the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm muscle. A group of uninjured\nTrkB\nF616A\nmice received 11 days of 1NMPP1 treatment (n=7) in order to verify persistent diaphragm activity. In vivo inhibition of TrkB kinase activity in\nTrkB\nF616A\nmice was verified in protein extracted from brain tissue following systemic treatment with 1NMPP1 or vehicle. TrkB protein was immunoprecipitated using anti-TrkB (Neuromics # GT15080).\nFollowing electrophoresis, protein was transferred to a PVDF membrane and probed using 1:500 phosphorylated TrkB (Cell Signaling #4621S) and 1:1000 TrkB (Neuromics #GT15080). Following 1NMPP1 treatment of\nTrkB\nF616A\nmice, there is a 13 fold reduction in the ratio of phosphorylated to total TrkB (P=0.04).\nAt the terminal experiment, mice were anesthetized with intramuscular ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and diaphragm muscle EMG recordings were collected. Following EMG recordings, mice were euthanized by exsanguination and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde solution in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, and the cervical spinal cord was removed and preserved for further analyses.\n\nSpinal cord hemisection (C2SH)\nThe surgical procedure for C2SH was based on previously published techniques in the rat (\nMantilla, et al., 2012\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2013\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2007\n,\nMiyata, et al., 1995\n,\nPrakash, et al., 1999\n). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with intramuscular ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). A bilateral dorsal laminectomy at C2 exposed the cervical spinal cord and a lateralized section of the right half of the spinal cord was performed at C2 anteriorly to the dorsal fissure (see\nFig. 1\n). This lateral hemisection resulted in functional loss of ipsilateral diaphragm muscle activity evident by a change in the movement of the chest wall and abdomen. All animals were observed closely following surgery and intramuscular buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) and acetaminophen in drinking water (2 mg/ml) were administered following surgery, and as needed thereafter. Overall, 42\nTrkB\nF616A\nmice underwent C2SH and were allocated to experimental treatment groups examined at 2 weeks following C2SH (n=32) and to a functional verification group examined at 3 days following C2SH (n=10) in order to ascertain the absence of ipsilateral diaphragm EMG activity at this time point. An additional 14 mice underwent C2SH but were not allocated to experimental groups due to death during surgery or prior to 3 days post-C2SH.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nHistological evidence of spinal cord trauma following cervical spinal hemisection at the C2 level (C2SH) in adult\nTrkB\nF616A\nmice. Serial, 50 \u03bcm transverse sections of the spinal cord from C1 \u2013 C4 were stained with cresyl violet in order to visualize spinal cord anatomy and identify the area of injury. A representative image is displayed in panel A. The maximal area of damage for each mouse was determined from all images exhibiting injury by rendering injury areas onto a spinal cord section outline. The extent of C2SH for each animal is represented as a different color in the composite image in panels B and C, for mice that did display recovery of ipsilateral rhythmic hemidiaphragm EMG activity (panel B) and those that did not (panel C). Scale bar, 250 \u03bcm.\n\nHistological assessment of spinal cord hemisection (C2SH)\nThe extent of C2SH was evaluated by histological examination of spinal cord sections from C1 \u2013 C4. Transverse sections (50 \u03bcm) were cut using a cryostat (Reichert-Jung 2800E) kept at -20 \u00b0C, mounted on Cell-Tak-coated slides (BD Biosciences #354241) and allowed to dry overnight. Sections were then placed in 1:1 alcohol:chloroform, 95% and 100% alcohol followed by distilled water for 5 minutes in each step. Sections were then stained with 0.1% cresyl violet in glacial acetic acid. After \u223c10 minutes, slides were rinsed in water and dehydrated through graded alcohol steps followed by xylene. Images were obtained on an upright Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope equipped with an 8-bit CCD camera. All images were saved using as 24-bit multi-TIFF RGB color files.\nIn order to visualize the extent of C2SH for an individual animal, every spinal cord image exhibiting any evidence of injury was identified and exported into Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose CA). The area of injury in each image was then rendered onto a standard spinal cord section outline. The extent of C2SH was determined by planimetry from the maximal area of injury encompassing all images from that animal (\nFig. 1\n).\n\nDiaphragm EMG recordings\nAs previously described (\nDow, et al., 2006\n,\nDow, et al., 2009\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2012\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2013\n,\nMantilla, et al., 2011\n,\nTrelease, et al., 1982\n), a pair of electrode wires (0.28 mm diameter - model AS631, Cooner Wire Inc., Chatsworth, CA) were stripped about 1 mm at the tip and implanted bilaterally into the midcostal diaphragm muscle regions. The uninsulated portion was embedded within the diaphragm muscle and EMG activity was recorded during spontaneous breathing in anesthetized mice.\nThe EMG signal from the diaphragm muscle was differentially amplified (2000x), bandpass filtered (20-1000 Hz), and analog-to-digital converted at 2 kHz using a LabView data acquisition board and software (National Instruments, Austin, TX). The diaphragm muscle EMG was used to determine evidence of functional recovery as well as parameters of respiratory function (i.e. inspiratory and expiratory durations, duty cycle, and respiratory frequency). The following criteria were used to establish evidence of recovery of ipsilateral hemidiaphragm EMG activity: 1) rhythmic (i.e., in phase with contralateral side), 2) periodic (i.e., occurring across >90% of eupneic bursts over at least 2 min period), and 3) signal comprising at least two motor units. In all cases parameters of respiratory function were determined from the side contralateral to C2SH injury, regardless of evidence of functional recovery. Diaphragm EMG recordings were not used for quantitative analyses of EMG amplitude since comparisons across animals or across sides are not meaningful given expected variability in electrode position, inter-electrode distance, and local fiber type composition. Indeed, chronic EMG recordings in the same animal are necessary for such quantitative analyses, and even then only when referenced to some maximal or near-maximal level of activation (c.f.,\nMantilla, et al., 2011\n). Chronic placement of EMG electrodes was attempted in the diaphragm muscle unsuccessfully (n=10; see Results).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll statistical evaluations were performed using JMP (version 9.0.1, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina). Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA comparing across groups for EMG analysis of recovery rate, time inspiratory, time expiratory, duty cycle, and respiratory frequency. Data are reported as mean \u00b1 SE, unless otherwise specified, significance was accepted at P<0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal procedures were performed in accordance with the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. BALB/cJ GABA\nB1\nR\n+/\u2212\nmice (\nSchuler et al. 2001\n) (gift from Bernhard Bettler, University of Basel) were mated with actin-GFP\n+\nmice to generate GABA\nB\n1R\n+/+\n:GFP and GABA\nB\n1R\n\u2212/\u2212\n:GFP, which we refer to as WT and GABA\nB1\nR KO, respectively. For all transplantations studies, GFP\n+\ncells were grafted into WT CD-1 mice (Charles River, Harlan). Cells were transplanted into CD-1 mice given that the anatomical and functional integration of grafted progenitor cells is well-established in CD-1 host mice (\nAlvarez-Dolado et al. 2006\n;\nBaraban et al. 2009\n;\nSebe et al. 2013\n).\n\nImmunohistochemistry and cell counts\nBrains of GABA\nB1\nR KO mice (GABAb\n1\nR\n\u2212/ \u2212\n:GFP) and WT (GABA\nB\n1R\n+/+\n:GFP) littermates were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde by perfusion and 50 \u03bcm coronal sections were cut by vibratome. Floated sections were labeled for parvalbumin (PV: Sigma P3088; 1:500), somatostatin (SOM: Santa Cruz 7819; 1:500), neuropeptide Y (NPY: ImmunoStar 22940; 1:500) or calretinin (CR: Millipore AB5054; 1:500). Following the application of one of these primary antibodies, diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma) staining was performed using the ABC elite kit (Vector Labs). Slices were mounted and dehydrated with a series of washes in ethanol and xylenes. Counts of interneuron subtypes were conducted by an investigator blind to genotype. To conduct cell counts, bright field images of slices containing somatosensory cortex were captured and images of slices were reconstructed in Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Systems Inc.). For each pair of WT and KO littermates, slices containing the same regions of somatosensory cortex were marked by rectangles of the same dimensions and area. DAB-positive cells contained in these rectangles were counted in each neocortical layer. For each mouse, at least two brain slices were used to conduct cell counts. Data are reported in two ways: (1) mean percent of an interneuron subtype in each neocortical layer relative to the total number of cells counted for each mouse (\nFigure 3e-h\n) and (2) density of an interneuron subtype within a given area of somatosensory cortex that spanned all neocortical layers (\nFigure 3i\n).\nFigure 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nLaminar position of interneuron subtypes in GABA\nB1\nR WT and KO mice. a-d.

Summary data showing that the majority of PV+ and SOM+ cells are localized in L5 and 6. In contrast, a larger percentage of NPY+ and CR+ cells are found in L1 and 2/3. In KO mice, the percent of total CR+ cells is lower in L1. i. Summary histogram shows the cell density of each interneuron subtype assessed within the somatosensory cortex of WT vs. KO mice. (Two way ANOVA, Tukey, p<0.05). PV, SOM and NPY: n=5 mice were analyzed for each genotype. CR: n=4 mice were analyzed for each genotype.\n\nElectrophysiology\nCoronal brain slices (300 \u03bcm) were prepared in a high sucrose solution, incubated (35&\u00b0C for 30 min) and perfused with 33-34\n\u00b0\nC ACSF containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 3KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO4-H\n2\nO, 2 MgSO\n4\n-7H\n2\nO, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 10 dextrose, and 2 CaCl\n2\n.. For all recordings of synaptic and tonic currents, patch electrodes (3 M\u03a9) were filled with (in mM): 140 CsCl, 1 MgCl\n2\n, 10 HEPES, 11 EGTA, 2 NaATP, and 0.5 Na\n2\nGTP. To record spontaneous excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic currents from GABA\nB1\nR WT or KO cells, slices were perfused with the GABA\nA\nR antagonist gabazine (100 \u03bcM) (Sigma) or glutamate receptor antagonists APV (25 \u03bcM) and DNQX (20 \u03bcM) (Sigma). TTX (1 \u03bcM, Alomone Labs) was also added to the bath perfusate to record miniature synaptic currents. To record tonic GABA currents, slices were treated with the APV (25 \u03bcM) and DNQX (20 \u03bcM) (Sigma). To block GABA uptake, slices were perfused with the GABA transporter 1 (GAT1) and GABA transporter 2/3 (GAT2/3 antagonists) NO-711 (20 \u03bcM, Sigma) and SNAP5114 (100 \u03bcM, Tocris). When the holding current stabilized (4-5 min), gabazine (100 \u03bcM) was applied to the bath. Tonic current was measured by finding the mean holding current of trace sections that were free of synaptic events before and after GABA\nA\nR blockade (\nSebe et al. 2010\n). The standard deviation of the holding current, which is equivalent to the RMS noise (square root of the variance), was used to measure current noise. Changes in current noise before and after GABA\nA\nR blockade is a way to assess changes in the activity of open GABA\nA\nRs (\nBright and Smart 2013\n). The percent change in the standard deviation (SD) of the holding current was calculated by measuring the standard deviation in a section free of synaptic activity before and after GABA\nA\nR blockade. To obtain the data in\nFigure 6\n, in which we recorded tonic current from slices that had received increasing doses of GFP+ grafted cells, we filled the recorded host pyramidal cell with Alexa Fluor 594. After each recording, the red fluorescing cell in the live slice was placed in the center of the 40x field of view (area of field of view = 0.23 mm\n2\n) and the number of GFP\n+\ncells in this field counted. To characterize firing patterns and record sEPSCs from grafted derived GFP\n+\ncells, patch electrodes were filled with (in mM): 140 KGluconate, 1 NaCl, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 2 Na-ATP and Alexa Fluor 594 to fill the recorded cell. Excitatory synaptic currents were recorded in the presence of gabazine. Series resistance was measured after each recording and data were discarded if the resistance changed by more that 20% or if the series resistance was > 20 M\u03a9. For all voltage-clamp recordings, data were acquired using Clampex software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at a gain of 5, sampling rate of 5 kHz and holding potential of -60 mV. For current-clamp recordings, data were acquired at a gain of 5 and a 10 kHz sampling rate. Current steps (1s) of varying amplitudes were injected into the cell to determine the threshold for firing and the cell's firing frequency. Firing frequency was defined as the firing frequency at double the current necessary to depolarize the cell to threshold. MiniAnalysis Software (Synaptosoft, Inc.) was used to measure the frequency, amplitude and decay of synaptic currents. Unpaired t-tests were used to compare the characteristics of synaptic and tonic currents between WT and KO cells. Two way ANOVAs (Tukey postdoc test) were used to compare the characteristics of tonic currents recorded from host cells in mice that had received media injection (control), WT grafted or KO grafted cells. Statistical significance for all tests was defined as a p < 0.05.\nFigure 6.\nOpen in a new tab\nTonic current increases with neighboring grafted cell number. a, a\u2019, b, and b\u2019 show representative tonic currents recorded from L2 host pyramidal cells in the presence of NO-711 and SNAP5114 (a and b) or in ACSF only (a\u2019 and b\u2019). Top traces (a and a\u2019) were recorded from cells with only 1 GFP+ cell in the same field of view. Bottom traces were recorded from cells with 15 and 14, respectively, GFP+ cells in the same field of view. c. Scatter plot of tonic current as a function of the number of grafted cells in the field of view. (\u2022) represent tonic current in the presence of NO-711 and SNAP5114. Spearman Rank correlation coefficient = 0.51, p = 0.002. (\u2207) represent tonic current in ACSF only (n.s.). d. Scatter plot of the % change in the standard deviation (SD) of the holding current following GABAAR blockade. In the presence of GABA uptake blockers, the change in SD increases with grafted cell number (Spearman Rank correlation coefficient = 0.46, p = 0.006). In both c and d, blue and red data points were obtained from traces show in a and b vs. a\u2019 and b\u2019, respectively.\n\nTransplantation\nFor transplantation studies, interneuron progenitors were isolated from a well-studied embryonic structure termed the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) (\nMarin and Rubenstein 2001\n;\nWichterle et al. 1999\n). The anterior portion of MGE was dissected from E12.5 GFP-expressing mouse embryos and placed in a mixture of L-15 media (UCSF Cell Culture Facility) and DNAse (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). In all studies, GFP\n+\nMGE cells were unilaterally injected into neocortices of postnatal day 3 (P3) WT CD-1 mice. A single \u201cMGE\u201d refers to MGE tissue obtained from one hemisphere of the embryonic brain and is thereby half of the total MGE cells in a donor embryo. For studies comparing host brain tonic current following the transplantation of WT vs. KO MGE cells, 2 MGEs were front-loaded into an injection needle containing media (outer diameter 70-80 \u03bcm) and injected 700\u03bcm deep into the somatosensory cortex to target Layer 6. Cells were injected into 2 different sites. For studies in which we examined tonic current following the transplantation of increasing numbers of MGE cells, we injected 1-4 MGEs in 3 different sites, again into Layer 6. In all studies, graft recipients were sacrificed 30-40 days after transplantation (DAT).\n\nAssessing MGE cell viability\nTo count the number of living and dead cells in a single dissected MGE, we used two methods. First, we counted the total number of dissected cells prior to loading cells into the injection needle. MGE were dissociated in media containing DNAse, combined with equal parts trypan blue, and loaded into a hemocytometer. Using this method, there were 180,000 to 200,000 cells in each MGE and 80-90% of these cells were alive i.e., trypan blue negative (144,000-180,000 cells). Second, we counted the number of cells after a single MGE had been loaded into the injection needle and all visible cells were ejected into a 100 \u03bcL drop of media. The total cell count and viability decreased after needle loading. After needle loading, we counted 138,000-142,000 cells in each MGE and 50-70% of these cells were alive. Therefore, for each MGE loaded into the needle, we estimate an injection of approximately 69,000-99,000 live cells."

    "Methods": "Animals and surgery\nAdult ICR mice were (male, 7\u20138 weeks) purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of Nantong University. CD1 mice (male, 4\u20136 weeks) were purchased from Charles River Laboratory for the electrophysiology study. The animals were maintained at room temperature of 22 \u00b1 1\u00b0C, humidity of 55 \u00b1 10%, and a 12:12 light\u2013dark cycle with free access to food and water. All animal procedures in this study were performed according to the guidelines of the International Association for the Study of Pain and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Nantong University or the Animal Care Committee of Duke University. Peripheral inflammation was induced by intraplantar injection of CFA (20 \u03bcl, Sigma, St Louis, MO) in the left hind paws under brief anesthesia with isofluorane. The sham-treated animals were injected same volume of normal saline.\n\nDrugs and administration\nSB225002, a potent and selective antagonist of CXCR2, was purchased from Tocris (Bristol, UK). MEK inhibitor PD98059 was purchased from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). The CXCL1 neutralizing antibody was purchased from Boster (Wuhan, China). For intrathecal injection, spinal cord puncture was made with a 30 G needle between the L5 and L6 level to deliver the reagents to the cerebral spinal fluid (\nHylden and Wilcox, 1980\n).\n\nReal-time PCR (RT-PCR)\nTotal RNA was extracted from L4-5 spinal cord with the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). One microgram of total RNA was converted into cDNA using PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara, Otsu, Shiga, Japan). The cDNA was amplified using the following primers: CXCL1 forward, 5'-GCT TGA AGG TGT TGC CCT CAG -3'; CXCL1 reverse, 5'-AGA AGC CAG CGT TCA CCA GAC-3'; CXCR2 forward, 5'-TCT GCT CAC AAA CAG CGT CGT A-3'; CXCR2 reverse, 5'-GAG TGG CAT GGG ACA GCA TC-3'; COX-2 forward, 5'-CTC CTG GAA CAT GGA CTC AC TCA-3'; COX-2 reverse, 5'-AGG CCT TTG CCA CTG CTT GTA-3'. GAPDH forward, 5'-AAA TGG TGA AGG TCG GTG TGA AC-3'; GAPDH reverse, 5'-CAA CAA TCT CCA CTT TGC CAC TG-3'. The SYBR Premix Ex Taq II kit (Takara) was used for all PCR reactions. The PCR reactions were run on a Rotor-Gene 3000 RT-PCR machine (Corbett Research, Mortlake, Australia). The PCR amplifications were performed at 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds, followed by 45 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 5 seconds, 56\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds. The melting curves were performed to validate the utility and specificity of each PCR product. The data were analyzed using Rotor-Gene 6000 series software, and evaluated using the Comparative CT Method (2\n\u2212\u0394\u0394CT\n).\n\nELISA\nMouse CXCL1 ELISA kit was purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). Animals were transcardially perfused with PBS at 6 h and 3 d after CFA or saline injection. The lumbar spinal cord segments were dissected. The tissues were homogenized in a lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA Protein Assay (Thermal Fisher, Rockford, IL). For each reaction in a 96-well plate, 100 \u03bcg of proteins were used, and ELISA was performed according to manufacturer's protocol. The standard curve was included in each experiment.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAfter appropriate survival times, animals were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused through the ascending aorta with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde with 1.5% picric acid in 0.16 M PB. After the perfusion, the L4-L5 spinal cord segments were removed and postfixed in the same fixative overnight. Spinal cord sections (30 \u03bcm, free-floating) were cut in a cryostat and processed for immunofluorescence as we described previously (\nGao et al., 2009\n). The sections were first blocked with 2% donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the following primary antibodies: CXCL1 antibody (rabbit, 1:100; Boster, Wuhan, China), CXCR2 antibody (rabbit, 1:100; Boster), GFAP antibody (mouse, 1:6000; Millipore, Billerica, MA), CD11b antibody (mouse, 1:200, AbD serotec, Raleigh, NC), neuronal-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) antibody (mouse, 1:800, Millipore), COX-2 (rabbit, 1:500, Boster, China). The sections were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Cy3- or FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Westgrove, PA). For double immunofluorescence, sections were incubated with a mixture of mouse and rabbit primary antibodies followed by a mixture of Cy3- and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. The stained sections were examined with a Leica fluorescence microscope, and images were captured with a Charge-coupled Device Spot camera.\n\nWestern blot\nProtein samples were prepared in the same way as for ELISA analysis, and 30 \u03bcg of proteins were loaded for each lane and separated on SDS-PAGE gel (10%). After the transfer, the blots were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with antibody against CXCR2 (1:100, rabbit, Boster), COX-2 (1:500, rabbit, Cell Signaling), pERK (1:1000, rabbit, Cell Signaling). For loading control, the blots were incubated with GAPDH antibody (1:20000, mouse, Sigma). These blots were further incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, developed in ECL solution (Thermo Scientific), and exposed onto film (Millipore) for 1\u20135 min. Specific bands were evaluated by apparent molecular size. The intensity of the selected bands was analyzed using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).\n\nSpinal slice preparation and patch-clamp recordings\nYoung mice (4\u20136 weeks old) were anesthetized with urethane (50 mg/kg, i.p.), and a portion of the lumbar spinal cord (L4 \u2013L5) was removed and kept in pre-oxygenated ice-cold Krebs' solution. Transverse spinal cord slices (350\u2013450 \u03bcm thick) were cut on a vibrating microslicer. The slices were stored in an incubation solution at room temperature (in mM: NaCl, 95; KCl, 1.8; KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.2; CaCl\n2\n, 0.5; MgSO\n4\n, 7; NaHCO\n3\n, 26; glucose, 15; sucrose, 50; oxygenated with 95% O\n2\n, 5% CO\n2\n; pH 7.4). A slice was then transferred into a recording chamber and perfused with oxygenated recording solution at 3 ml/min at room temperature. The recording solution (Mg\n2+\nfree) was identical to the incubation solution except for (in mM): NaCl 127, CaCl\n2\n2.4, MgSO\n4\n0 and sucrose 0.\nThe whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from lamina IIo neurons in voltage-clamp mode as we previously reported (\nPark et al., 2011\n). Under a dissecting microscope with transmitted illumination, the substantia gelatinosa (lamina II) is clearly visible as a relatively translucent band across the dorsal horn. Standard whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed with glass pipettes having a resistance of 5\u201310 M\u03a9 in lamina IIo of spinal dorsal horn. The pipette solution consisted of (in mM): K-gluconate, 135; KCl, 5; CaCl\n2\n, 0.5; MgCl\n2\n, 2; EGTA, 5; HEPES, 5 and Mg-ATP, 5, pH 7.4 with KOH, measured osmolarity 300 mOsm. To measure NMDA-induced currents, the membrane potential was held at \u221240 mV and NMDA (50 \u03bcM) was puffed into the solution. CXCL1 (100 ng/ml) and SB225002 (0.1 \u03bcM) were given in the same way. The electrophysiological properties of the recorded neurons were investigated in voltage-clamp modes using an Axon 700B amplifier and pClamp10.0 data acquisition software. Signals were low-pass filtered at 5 kHz, sampled at 10 kHz and analyzed offline (\nBaba et al., 2003\n;\nKawasaki et al., 2008\n).\n\nBehavioral analysis\nAnimals were habituated to the testing environment daily for at least two days before baseline testing. The room temperature and humidity remained stable for all experiments. For testing mechanical sensitivity, animals were put in boxes on an elevated metal mesh floor and allowed 30 min for habituation before examination. The plantar surface of each hindpaw was stimulated with a series of von Frey hairs with logarithmically incrementing stiffness (0.02\u20132.56 grams, Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL), presented perpendicular to the plantar surface (2\u20133 seconds for each hair, 3 min interval between the tests). The 50% paw withdrawal threshold was determined using Dixon's up-down method (\nChaplan et al., 1994\n). For testing heat sensitivity, animals were put in plastic boxes and allowed 30 min for habituation before examination. Heat sensitivity was tested by radiant heat using Hargreaves apparatus (IITC Life Science Inc., Woodland Hills, CA) and expressed as paw withdrawal latency (PWL). The test was repeated at least three times/animal allowing at least 5 min in between each test. The radiant heat intensity was adjusted so that basal PWL is between 10\u201314 seconds, with a cut-off of 18 seconds to prevent tissue damage.\n\nQuantification and statistics\nAll data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. The behavioral data was analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni test as the multiple comparison analysis. The qPCR and ELISA data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc test. For western blot, the density of specific bands was measured with Image J (NIH). COX-2 and pERK levels were normalized to loading control (GAPDH). Differences between two groups were compared using Student's t-test. The criterion for statistical significance was P < 0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nA total of 4 transgenic adult rats expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and 56 female Sprague Dawley (SD) adult rats (Harlan Co; Indianapolis, IN) weighting 200 to 220 g were used in this study. GFP transgenic adult rats (Rosa 26, SD strain, generous gift from George M. Smith, Temple University) were used for isolation and culture of SCs-GFP, whereas the remaining rats were used for SCI and transplantation studies. Among the 56 SD rats, 42 were assigned for assessing the survival, proliferation, migration, and myelination of grafted SCs-GFP, 12 were used for behavior tests, and 2 were used for long-term observation of grafted SCs-GFP. All animal care and surgical interventions were undertaken in strict accordance with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Research Council), and were approved by the Indiana University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Institutional Biosafety Committee.\n\nIsolation and Culture of SCs-GFP\nThe methods for SCs isolation, purification, and amplification were developed by Morrissey et al. (\nMorrissey et al., 1991\n) and described in our previous publications (\nDeng et al., 2011\n;\nHu et al., 2013\n;\nXu et al., 1995a\n;\nXu et al., 1995b\n). Briefly, sciatic nerves were obtained from GFP transgenic adult rats anaesthetized with ketamine (87.7 mg/kg; Ben Venue Labs, OH) and xylazine (12.3 mg/kg; Butler, OH) under aseptic conditions. After epineurium and connective tissue were removed, the nerves were cut into 1-mm-long explants. The explants were placed in 35-mm tissue culture dishes (Baxter, Stone Mountain, GA, USA) with low levels (0.8 mL) of Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). When the outgrowth of migratory cells (predominantly fibroblasts) reached a near-confluent monolayer around the explants (7 d), the explants were transferred to new culture dishes with fresh medium. After 5 to 6 such passages (5\u20136 wk), the cells that emerged from the explants were primarily SCs. The explants were then transferred to a 35-mm dish containing 1.25 U/mL dispase (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA), 0.05% collagenase (Worthington Biochemicals Corp., Freehold, NJ, USA) and 15% FBS in DMEM for incubation overnight at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO\n2\n. On the following day, the explants were dissociated and the cells were plated onto poly-L-lysine-coated 100-mm dishes in DMEM/10% FBS. Later, the cultures were re-fed with the same medium supplemented with 20 \u03bcg/mL pituitary extract (BTI, Stoughton, MA, USA) and 2 \u03bcM forskolin (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) for dividing. When the SCs reached confluence, they were rinsed in Ca\n2+\n- and Mg\n2+\n- free Hanks balanced salt solution (CMF-HBSS; Life Technologies, USA) and briefly treated with 0.05% trypsin (Life Technologies, USA) and 0.02% EDTA (Life Technologies, USA) in CMF-HBSS. Cells were washed twice in DMEM/10% FBS and passed into new dishes at a density of 2 \u00d7 10\n6\ncells/100 mm dish. The purity of the SCs (Percentage of P75\n+\nGFP\n+\ncells in all GFP\n+\ncells) was quantified according to the methods described previously (\nXu et al., 1995b\n). All SCs used in this study were passage (P) 2 cells with a purity of > 98%.\n\nModerate thoracic contusion injury\nModerate contusion injury was induced by a weight drop device developed at New York University called NYU impactor (\nGruner, 1992\n). A laminectomy was performed at the thoracic vertebrae 8 exposing the dorsal surface of the 9\nth\nthoracic spinal cord (T9) underneath without disrupting the dura mater. The exposed spinal cord was injured by dropping a 10.0-g rod from a height of 12.5 mm. The contusion impact height, compression, and velocity were monitored. After injury, a fine dura suture at the epicenter of the injury area was made with 10-0 nylon and the injury was covered with a sterile piece of parafilm (Pechiney Plastic Packaging, Chicago, IL) as landmarks for the secondary surgery and cell injection. The muscles were sutured in layers and the skin was closed with clips. The rats were allowed to recover in a warmed cage with water and food easily accessible. The analgesic buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.01 mg/kg, Reckitt and Colman, Hull, UK) was subcutaneously delivered post-surgery and daily for 2 d.\n\nSCs-GFP transplantation\nSC transplantation was performed at 1 wk after SCI. Four hours prior to implantation, fresh DMEM/10% FBS medium containing 20 \u03bcg/mL pituitary extract and 2 \u03bcM forskolin was added to the culture. SCs-GFP were harvested from culture via trypsinization, centrifuged, re-suspended, and counted (\nHill et al., 2007\n). After counting, SCs-GFP were re-suspended as aliquots in DMEM/10% FBS medium supplemented with 20 \u03bcg/mL pituitary extract and 2 \u03bcM forskolin and were kept on ice prior to grafting. Rats were re-anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine, as described above, and the injury site was re-exposed. A total of 1\u00d710\n6\nSCs-GFP, suspended in 5 \u03bcL of culture medium, were directly injected into the lesion cavity, identified by the 10-0 nylon suture on the dura surface. The injection was made using pulled glass capillaries attached to a pneumatic pump device at a speed of 0.1 \u03bcL/sec. The injection pipette was kept in place for an additional 3 min to minimize leakage upon withdrawal. After the injection, the muscle and the skin were closed in layers and animals received postoperative care according to our standard protocol (\nXu et al., 1997\n;\nXu et al., 1995a\n;\nXu et al., 1995b\n). Injury-only controls received 5 \u03bcL of culture medium injections. All animals received a daily subcutaneous injection of cyclosporine A (CsA, 10mg/kg; Sigma) starting 3 d prior to the transplantation which was continued until the end of the experiments. In 2 rats that survived for 52 wk (~1 yr) after SCs-GFP transplantation, the rats received CsA treatment for only the first 3 months.\n\nPulse-labeling of the proliferating SCs following transplantation\nTo assess the proliferation of grafted SCs, one day before the termination of animals at each time point (except for the group sacrificed at 5 min post-transplantation), animals received 4 intraperitoneal injections of 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma, St. Louis, MO; 100 mg/kg/injection) at every 6 h.\n\nHistology\nAt indicated time points post-transplantation (\nFig. 1\n), animals were deeply anesthetized with 60 mg/kg pentobarbital and perfused transcardially with 100 mL heparinized saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffer (PB; 0.01M, pH 7.4). The spinal cord segments containing the injury/transplant epicenter were removed, post-fixed in the same perfusion fixative for overnight at 4\u00b0C, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.01M, pH 7.4) for another 5\u20137 d. A 2-cm-long spinal cord segment centered at the injury/transplant epicenter was dissected out. The cord segments were embedded in Tissue-Tek and sectioned longitudinally or transversely (a subset) at 20 \u03bcm in 5 sets on a cryostat (Leica CM 1950). Sections were mounted onto gelatin-subbed slides and stored at \u221220\u00b0C for immunohistological analyses and quantification of grafted SCs-GFP.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nExperimental design and Schwann cells overexpressing green fluorescent protein (SCs-GFP) culture\nin vitro\n. A: Schwann cell isolated from the sciatic nerves of the adult transgenic rats strongly expressed GFP and expanded to form a confluence layer in culture. One week after spinal cord injury, these cells were transplanted into the epicenters of injured spinal cords and continued to observe the survival, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and myelination of SCs (Exp. 1), the long-term fate of SCs (Exp. 2) and behavioral changes over time (Exp. 3). Immunocytochemistry showed that over 98% of these SCs-GFP cells (B, green) express P75 neurotrophic factor receptor (P75NTR, C, red), a specific marker for Schwann cells (D). Scale bars = 20 \u03bcm.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nFor\nin vitro\nexperiments, cells in culture were fixed in 4% PFA for 20 min prior to blocking/permeabilization for immunocytochemistry with mouse anti-p75NTR antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) overnight followed by the rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Mouse IgG control sera were used at the same concentration as the corresponding primary antibodies to establish the specificity of staining.\nFor\nin vivo\nexperiments, every 5th sagittal section (100 \u03bcm apart) was immunochemically stained as previously described (\nLiu et al., 2008\n). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein to identify astrocytes (GFAP, 1:400; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), mouse anti-SMI-31 to recognize the phosphorylated neurofilament epitope of axons (1:200, Sigma), mouse anti-ED-1 to identify activated microglia/macrophages (1:400, Sigma), and mouse RECA-1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) to recognize blood vasculature. A mix of the monoclonal rabbit anti-Neurofilament 200 antibody (1:200, Sigma) and one of the following antibodies: goat anti myelin protein zero (P0, 1:400) and mouse anti-myelin basic protein (SMI-94, 1:1,000, Covance), were used to determine the type of myelination on axons within the graft region. After the primary antibodies, sections were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies including AMCA-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, or rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:200; all from Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab) alone or in combination according to the primary antibodies used. After staining, the slides were rinsed with PBS and mounted with Gel/Mount aqueous mounting media contained with Hoechst 33342, a fluorescent nuclear dye.\nFor BrdU staining, a commercially available in situ BrdU incorporation assay was used. Briefly, sections were treated with 1 N HCl for 40 min at 37\u00b0C to denature the DNA prior to the use of primary rabbit anti-BrdU antibody (1:100; Sigma) overnight at 4\u00b0C and then secondary antibody (rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG; 1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab) at room temperature for 2 h. The slides were rinsed with PBS and mounted with Gel/Mount aqueous mounting media containing Hoechst 33342.\nTo determine whether transplanted SCs underwent apoptosis, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed using an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche, Penzberg, Germany). In brief, after incubation in permeabilization solution containing 0.1% triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min, the slides were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 50 \u03bcL of TUNEL reaction solution for 1 h in a humidified chamber at 37 \u00b0C in the dark. The slides were rinsed with PBS and mounted with Gel/Mount aqueous mounting media containing Hoechst 33342.\n\nQuantification of SCs-GFP survival, proliferation and apoptosis\nComplete sets of every 5th section (20 \u03bcm thick, 100 \u03bcm apart) of the spinal cord segments containing grafted SCs-GFP were processed. Fluorescent images were acquired with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M fluorescent microscope in Z-stack mode and were deconvoluted with the Axiovision software package (Carl Zeiss) to obtain near-confocal quality optical sections. Merged images were post-processed using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) to quantify the total number of SCs-GFP per 20 \u03bcm-thick section. Only GFP\n+\nSCs that contained a clear nuclear dye Hoechst 33342 were recognized and counted. All BrdU\n+\nSCs-GFP, representing proliferating grafted SCs, were photographed and counted manually in each 20 \u03bcm-thick section. Likewise, all TUNEL\n+\nSCs-GFP, representing grafted SCs that underwent apoptosis, were counted manually in each 20 \u03bcm-thick section. The estimated total number of GFP\n+\nSCs was calculated as: (the number of GFP\n+\nSCs per section) x (the number of total sections per set) x (the number of sets). The estimated total number of BrdU\n+\nSCs-GFP and TUNEL\n+\nSCs-GFP was calculated in the same manner. The percentage of BrdU\n+\nor TUNEL\n+\nSCs-GFP in all grafted SCs-GFP at different time points was calculated by dividing the total number of BrdU\n+\nor TUNEL\n+\nSCs-GFP by the total number of SCs-GFP.\n\nAssessment of maximum distance of SC migration\nTo assess the migratory ability of transplanted SCs-GFP within the injured spinal cord, all longitudinal sections that contained transplanted SCs-GFP in one set of sections were examined under an Olympus BX60 microscope. We measured the longest distance (mm) that the grafted SCs-GFP migrated from the rostral or caudal lesion border demarcated by the GFAP-labeled astrocytes on the border.\n\nBehavioral testing\nRats for the behavioral assessments were randomly assigned to 2 groups: the control group received injections of culture medium alone and the transplantation group received injections of SCs-GFP. The Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) open-field locomotor rating scale was used to assess hindlimb locomotor recovery according to the previously published work (\nBasso et al., 1995\n). The tests were performed by two examiners who were blinded to the animals\u2019 treatments at 1 d pre-injury (baseline, BL), 2 d after injury, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 wk after injections of cells or medium. Animals with a minimum BBB score of 12 were further analyzed and included in the footprint and grid-walking analyses from the 3\nrd\nwk after cell transplantation.\nFootprint analysis was performed at different time points using a procedure described previously (\nHu et al., 2013\n). The hindlimbs of the rats were dipped in nontoxic blue dyes and the animals walked on a paper-covered narrow runway (100 cm long and 7 cm wide). To perform the measurements, the first and last 15 cm of the prints were excluded to avoid analyzing the beginning and end of the limb movements. The angle of rotation (AOR) was assessed by measuring the angle between two lines connecting the third toe and the stride line at the center of the paw pad. The base of support was determined by measuring the distance between the central pads on the hind paws (DBF). Stride length (SL) was determined by measuring the linear distance between corresponding successive points of contact of the same foot. Paw length (PL) was determined by measuring the longest paw print. Toe spread (TS) was determined by measuring the distance between first and fifth toes based on the largest value attained for each side. The trial was repeated 3 times and the results were averaged for each rat.\nGrid-walk analysis was performed to assess the deficits in descending motor functions (\nMetz et al., 2000\n) in a manner complementary to the footprint. The rats were allowed to traverse over a wire mesh grid (2.5 \u00d7 2.5 cm\n2\ngrid spaces). Animals were required to walk for at least 30 s on this device up to a 3-min test period during which the total number of hindlimb movements and the number of footfalls of the hindlimb were counted, respectively, by two examiners blind to the experiment. One footfall was defined when the hindlimb paw protruded entirely through the grid with all toes and heel extended below the wire surface. Data were expressed as the percentage of footfalls over the total number of hindlimb movement. For each session, the average number of paw falls of each rat was taken from 3 trials.\nThermal sensitivity was assessed by measuring latency to paw withdrawal from a noxious heat source, as described by Hargreaves et al (\nHargreaves et al., 1988\n). Rats were allowed to acclimate within acrylic glass enclosures on a clear glass plate maintained at 30\u00b0C. A radiant heat source was focused through the glass plate onto the plantar surface of the both hind paws. Withdrawal latency was measured using a motion detector that shut off the heat stimulus and a timer on withdrawal of the paw. A maximal cutoff of 20 s was used to prevent tissue damage. Thermal sensitivity was measured at baseline, 2 d after SCI, and weekly post-cell transplantation.\n\nStatistical analysis\nOne-way ANOVA followed by the Fisher\u2019s least significant difference (LSD) post hoc test was used to determine statistical differences of the average number of SCs-GFP\n+\nwithin the lesion site of a moderately contused spinal cord between animals sacrificed at different time points. However, in case of unequal variance (F test), a nonparametric analysis (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test followed by Mann\u2013Whitney test) was used. Pearson\u2019s Chi-square test was used to determine statistical differences of the percentage of BrdU\n+\n, or TUNEL\n+\nSCs-GFP between animals terminated at different time points. A mixed factorial (repeated measures) ANOVA followed by the Tukey-Kramer test was used for comparison of weekly functional recovery (BBB and footprint) after injury. Differences were accepted to be statistically significant at P < 0.05*, <0.01** and <0.001***. All errors are given as standard deviation of mean."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll procedures were performed according to the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were in compliance with approved IACUC protocols at Oregon Health & Science University. Subjects were three-month-old male and female C57BL/6J (wild-type) mice as well as proopiomelanocortin-enhanced green fluorescent protein (POMC-EGFP) transgenic mice, in which newborn neurons transiently express EGFP, maximal at approximately two weeks post-mitosis (\nOverstreet et al., 2004\n). In POMC-EGFP mice, the sham group included 5 males and 6 females; and the CHI group included 11 males and 13 females. In wild-type mice, the sham group included 6 males and 5 females; and the CHI group included 6 males and 7 females. Separate cohorts of wild-type mice were used to assess c-fos protein 3 hours after injury and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) or Fluoro-Jade C staining 1 week after injury, and included 18 sham and 22 CHI treated mice. A few mice died immediately (within minutes) after CHI, and were excluded from the study.\n\nClosed head injury\nWe used a closed head injury protocol (\nFlierl et al., 2009\n) to induce CHI. Mice were anesthetized using spontaneously inhaled isoflurane (2%) and mounted on a stereotaxic apparatus. A scalp incision was made along the midline, and the target area (1 mm left of the midline; 2 mm posterior to bregma) was marked. The head was then immobilized on a metal platform and a guided free-falling metal rod (310 g, 3 mm diameter silicone tip) was dropped on the target region from a height of 2.0 cm (all female mice) or 2.4 cm (all male mice). These sex-based drop heights were established in pilot studies to induce a transient neurologic impairment after injury with minimal mortality. Mice were weighed prior to sham or CHI treatment and there was no difference between groups (in grams, males: sham = 26.9 \u00b1 0.8, CHI = 26.3 \u00b1 0.6; females: sham = 20.5 \u00b1 0.8, CHI = 21.3 \u00b1 0.5). Following injury, the scalp was sutured and mice recovered in a warm padded chamber. Sham mice received the same treatment (anesthetic, scalp incision/closure, marking, head immobilization on platform), with the exception of the weight drop. One hour after injury, mice were assessed for gross sensorimotor and locomotor deficits using an abbreviated 8-point neurologic severity score (NSS) (identical to the published scale (\nFlierl et al., 2009\n) but omitting the 2 and 3 cm beam walk). The NSS assessed exploratory behavior, gait, motor coordination and startle response. Each mouse was individually coded and the experimenters were blinded for subsequent analyses. Mice were sacrificed two weeks after sham or CHI treatment to determine potential differences in hippocampal neurogenesis and glial activation, 3 hours after CHI to assess c-fos gene activation early after injury, or 1 week after injury to detect cell death with the neurodegeneration marker Fluoro-Jade C or macroscopic tissue damage using the vital dye TTC.\n\nBrdU injections\nBromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was used to examine the effect of CHI on neurogenesis in wild-type mice. BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in warm sterile saline (10 mg/ml) and injected at 300 mg/kg i.p. twice a day (4 hour interval between doses) for 7 days starting 24 hours after injury. This dose of BrdU was chosen to saturate mitotic cell labeling as determined previously (\nCameron and McKay, 2001\n). These mice were sacrificed 2-weeks after injury, such that BrdU-labeled cells sampled the same population of newborn neurons as those labeled in POMC-EGFP mice (\nOverstreet-Wadiche et al., 2006\n).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were terminally anesthetized according to IACUC-approved protocols, transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS), and post-fixed overnight. Coronal sections (150 mm thick) through the hippocampus were prepared from each mouse and permeabilized in 0.4% Triton in PBS (PBST) for 45 min. Sections were then blocked for 30 min with 10% horse serum in PBST and incubated overnight (4\u00b0C) with primary antibody in 1.5% horse serum/PBST. The primary antibodies were as follows: anti-GFP (Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated; 1:400, Invitrogen); anti-BrdU (1:500, Abcam); anti-doublecortin (1:400, Millipore); anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:20,000, Dako); anti-Mac-2 (1:400, Cedarlane Labs); and anti-c-fos (1:300, Santa Cruz). Sections incubated with anti-BrdU were first incubated in 2N hydrochloric acid in potassium PBST for 30 min (37\u00b0C), washed twice and blocked with horse serum as described above. The samples that required secondary antibodies were washed in PBST (2 \u00d7 10 min) the following day and incubated with either goat anti-rabbit (1:400, Alexa Fluor 568, Invitrogen); goat anti-rat (1:400, Rhodamine Red, Jackson Labs); or goat anti-guinea pig (1:400, Alexa Fluor 488, Invitrogen) for 2-hours at room temperature. The sections were then washed in PBST (2 \u00d7 10 min) and mounted with Dapi Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech).\nSlides were coded, and three alternate 150 \u03bcm thick coronal slices were taken from each animal, starting 300 \u03bcm from the anterior tip of the dorsal hippocampus of each mouse. This region was chosen as it was directly below the impact site and easily located between animals. Slices were imaged with a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope using a 10\u00d7 0.45NA or 20\u00d7 0.8NA lens and subsequently quantified using ImageJ software by an investigator blinded to experimental condition. For POMC-EGFP animals, all GFP positive cells in a 10 \u03bcm Z-stack through a 100 \u03bcm segment from the middle of the ipsilateral and contralateral suprapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus granule cell layer (GCL), including the subgranular zone (SGZ), were counted in three separate slices for each animal. These same slices were subsequently blindly re-imaged at lower power (10\u00d7) using single confocal sections in order to assess neurogenesis across the entire span of both blades (supra and infrapyramidal) and the crest of the dorsal dentate gyrus as well as the dentate gyrus of the ventral (temporal) hippocampus, and normalized to GCL cross-sectional area. In wild-type mice, BrdU positive cells were quantified in a similar fashion, although using a 20 \u03bcm thick Z-stack through the entire dentate SGZ and GCL and normalized to GCL volume.\nTo assess cell migration, the distance from the center of each cell body to the SGZ/hilar border was measured in the middle section of the suprapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus. Some injured animals had more cells, and thus more observations per animal. Thus, to give each animal equal weight in a distribution of the granule cell migration distances, the migration distance of 40 randomly chosen cells (randomized using Microsoft Excel) was chosen per animal for each condition, resulting in 200-280 cells for each experimental group/sex/laterality to represent the migration distribution for that particular condition.\nSubsets of CHI and sham mice were randomly chosen pre-hoc to undergo staining for additional markers, in order to provide adequate samples for each assay given the limited amount of tissue available from each mouse and to allow for littermate controls. All samples selected for an assay were included in the analysis without exception, and all tissue was stained side-by-side and imaged/analyzed by an experimenter blind to experimental condition, using the same acquisition settings. For quantification of c-fos and GFAP immunoreactivity, the mean intensity of all pixels in a 5\u03bcm Z-stack of the dentate gyrus GCL was obtained using ImageJ. For quantification of Mac-2 positive cells, the number of Mac-2 positive cells in a 10\u03bcm Z-stack of the dentate GCL was blindly counted, and normalized to GCL area in samples from wild-type mice. Cortical thickness and hippocampal volumes were quantified using low power images in which each structure was traced in 3 contiguous slices immediately below the CHI impact site using ImageJ. POMC-GFP mice were used for the GFAP staining and anatomical measurements, and wild-type mice were used for Mac-2 and cFos analyses. TTC staining was performed on acutely prepared live brain slices (\nSchnell et al., 2012\n) from wild-type animals 1 week after CHI or sham, and subsequently incubated in 2% TTC in PBS at 37C for 20 minutes, fixed in PBS + 4%PFA, and imaged in accordance with established protocols (\nGlover et al., 2012\n). Fluoro-Jade C staining was performed as previously described on wild-type mice (\nSchmued et al., 2005\n) with minor modifications. Three contiguous perfusion-fixed slices taken from directly below the site of injury were dried, ethanol rehydrated, exposed to 0.06% potassium permanganate for 15 min and incubated in 0.001% Fluoro-Jade C (Histo-Chem Inc.) for 30 minutes. Slices were cleared in xylene and mounted with DPX.\n\nStatistics\nFor all statistical analyses, data were first assessed for normality and homogeneity of variance to determine use of parametric or non-parametric tests as indicated in the Results section. Data are expressed as means \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics (IBM, Armonk, NY) and group comparisons were considered significant at p < 0.05. All figures were generated using Prism Software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla CA)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nA total of 36 Balb/C male mice (P60) were used. Mice were assembled into two groups: sham-operated (control) and 60-d hydrocephalus groups. All animals were housed under standard biotery conditions in standard rearing cages (28 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 15 cm). The relative humidity in the mouse facility was between 40% and 60%. Temperature was maintained in an air-conditioned room at 22 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C (the extreme room temperature was in a rage of \u00b12 \u00b0C). This housing condition is within the norm dictated by international regulatory agencies. Nonetheless, it should be noted that a recent report suggests that this temperature range produces mild stress, which may be important when cancer or metabolic disorders are modeled in mice (\nKokolus et al., 2013\n). Water and food were delivered\nad libitum\n. All experimental procedures described herein were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Colima.\n\nSurgical procedure in rodents\nObstructive hydrocephalus was induced by placing a piece of cellulose acetate film into the atrium of the aqueduct of Sylvius. Mice were intraperitoneally anesthetized with 2 % Avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol plus 2-methyl-2-butanol) pre-warmed to 37 \u00b0C. Then, animals were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (RWD life Science Co., Ltd Model 68003) with a heater pad to keep the animal\u2019s body temperature at 37 \u00b0C. The mouse\u2019s head was shaved and cleaned with 0.1% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, followed by 70% ethanol and 0.1% chlorhexidine gluconate. The skin was incised in the midline with a sterile surgical blade N 15 from just anterior to Bregma to just posterior to Lambda. The pericranium was removed with a cotton swab. The coordinates used to access the atrium of the aqueduct were \u22122.6 mm (anterior-posterior) and 0 mm (medial-lateral) coordinates relative to Bregma. At that set point, a hole was drilled with pre-sterilized microdrills and fine forceps. In all cases, the deepest layer of bone was carefully removed with forceps to expose the dura mater. Before introducing the occlusive film, the dura mater was opened with fine forceps. A piece of cellulose acetate film (3 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 0.1 mm; length, width and thickness, respectively) was then implanted into the ventricular system (\nFigure 1A\n). To reduce bleeding during this process, absorbable gelatin sponges (Surgifoam, Ethicon\n\u2122\n) were gently placed on the interhemispheric vein before introducing the cellulose acetate lamina. After introducing this film, one-minute compression was immediately applied to the blood vessel. The surgical wound was glued with tissue adhesive agent (3M\n\u2122\nVetbond\n\u2122\n1469SB). The sham procedure consisted of drilling a hole in the skull (2.6 mm and 0 mm (coordinates relative to Bregma) and removing bone fragments without opening the dura matter. For anesthesia recovery, animals were placed in a pre-warmed cage containing a clean bed. Analgesia was provided with subcutaneous injections of ketorolac (Dolo-Vet\n\u2122\n) (5 mg/kg) every 12 hours for 1 day following surgery.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nHydrocephalus model in the adult mice (\nA\n). On the top, schemes of axial, coronal and sagittal sections of the mouse brain are shown. Hydrocephalus was induced by placing a cellulose acetate film (3.0 mm length, 0.5 mm width and 0.1 mm thick) into the atrium of the aqueduct (\u22122.6 mm, 0 mm; anterior-posterior and lateral coordinates from Bregma, respectively) in mice. Phase-contrast imaging of the lateral ventricles of control (\nB\n) and hydrocephalus animals (\nC\n). Significant ventricular enlargement is observed 60 days after surgery (\nD\n). The average area of the ventricles was measured in >10 coronal sections taken every 200 \u03bcm (n = 5 animals per group). The graph indicates that the hydrocephalic group showed statistically significant differences when compared to controls. * P < 0.05; Mann-Whitney \u201cU\u201d test. Bar = 200 \u03bcm.\n\nMorris Water Maze (MWM) task\nMWM is a widely used device to evaluate the presence of cognitive impairments. This experimental apparatus consisted of a circular water tank (120 cm wide and 40 cm high) surrounded by extra-maze cues. An escape platform (10 cm wide and 30 cm high) was placed in the water. To assess for gross physical, sensory, motor, or motivational impairments, we used the visible-platform version of the MWM (\nGulinello et al., 2009\n;\nVorhees and Williams, 2006\n). 53 days after surgery, 8 mice in the hydrocephalic group and 6 mice in the control group were used. The water temperature was 27 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C that is sufficient to motivate the animals to escape, but insufficient to inhibit learning (\nMorris, 1984\n). All animals were tested in the morning between 9:00 and 11:00. Every day, all mice were randomly released into the water from one of the four quadrants. The location of the platform changed and mice were allowed to swim for 60 s to find the platform. After the animal found the platform, it was allowed to remain there for 60 s and was then moved to a pre-warmed cage. The time and distance needed to find the hidden platform were collected and analyzed. Data collection was automated by a video image motion analyzer (Ethovision, Noldus Information Technology, USA).\n\nTissue processing\nMice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight) before being sacrificed. Transcardial perfusion was done with 0.9% NaCl solution at 37 \u00b0C followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB). The brains were post-fixed overnight at 4 \u00b0C in the same fixative. To analyze the complete organization of SVZ cells and the cytoplasmic transformation of astrocytes, 40-\u03bcm thick coronal sections were cut with a vibratome from 1.18 mm to \u22123.40 mm in the anterior to posterior direction relative to Bregma (\nPaxinos and Franklin, 2001\n). Fluorescent immunostainings were performed as described below.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nSamples were rinsed (10 min \u00d7 3) in 0.1 M buffer phosphate buffer saline (PBS) to rehydrate the tissue. The sections were then blocked in 0.1 M PBS + 0.1% Triton + 10% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature in agitation, and the samples were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C in blocking solution + 0.1% Triton-X. To label proliferating cells, a polyclonal rabbit IgG anti-Ki67 (1:500; Novocastra code:NCL-Ki67p) was used. To label neuroblasts, a polyclonal guinea pig anti-doublecortin (DCX) IgG (1:1000; Millipore, Cat. No. AB2253) was used. The following day, the tissue was left for 15 min at room temperature. The tissue sections were then rinsed three times with 0.1 M PBS, and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies [AlexaFluor\n\u00ae\n488 goat anti-rabbit lgG (1:1000; Invitrogen, Cat. No. A11008) and AlexaFluor\n\u00ae\n594 goat anti-guinea pig lgG (1:1000; Invitrogen, Cat. No. A11076)] dissolved in blocking solution for 60 min at room temperature in darkness. After washing three times in 0.1 M PBS, tissues were mounted and covered with fluoroshield mounting medium (Abcam; Cat. No.\nAb104139\n) with diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; ab104139).\nFor immunohistochemistry, the tissue sections were immersed in 3% hydrogen peroxide (H\n2\nO\n2\n) dissolved in distilled water for 20 min and then washed three times with 0.1 M PBS. The sections were blocked in 0.1 PBS + 0.1% Triton + 10% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were then incubated either with rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein IgG (GFAP) (1:500 dilution, Dako Cytomation Cat. Z0334) or rabbit anti Iba-1 IgG, dilution (1:150 dilution, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Cat. 019-19741). All primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C in blocking solution + 0.1% Triton-X. The following day, the tissue sections were rinsed 3 times with 0.1 M PBS, incubated with the biotinylated secondary antibody (1: 400 dilution, goat anti-rabbit lgG+lgM Biotin, AbD Serotec Cat. 401008) and dissolved in blocking solution for 60 min at room temperature in darkness. The sections were then rinsed three times in 0.1 M PBS and incubated in darkness with avidin biotin complex (Vectastain ABC Kit, Elite Cat. No. PK-6100 Standard) for 45 minutes at room temperature. After three rinses in 0.1 M PBS, the sections were revealed for 5 minutes at room temperature using 0.03% 3,3\u2032diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride dihydrate (DAB, Aldrich, No. 261890). The sections were then washed three times in 0.1 M PBS, mounted and dehydrated using a series of ethanol solutions at crescent concentrations (70, 80, 90 and 95%). The slides were immediately sealed with 1\u20132 drops of resin (Entellan; Merck, Cat. No. 1079600500) and then air-dried before observation.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nTo further demonstrate the cellular composition of the SVZ, we did semi-thin and ultra-thin sections. For electron microscopy studies, two mice per group were perfused with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde (EMS, Hatfield, PA) dissolved in 0.1M PB. Brains were then dissected and post-fixed in the same fixative solution. Coronal 200-\u03bcm sections were cut using a Leica VT-1000 vibratome (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). Sections were post-fixed with 2% osmium for 2 h, rinsed, dehydrated and embedded in Durcupan resin (Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). Semithin sections (1.5 \u03bcm) were cut with an UC-6 Ultracut (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) and stained lightly with 1% toluidine blue. Finally, ultra-thin sections (60\u201380 nm) were cut with a diamond knife, stained with lead citrate (Reynolds solution), and examined under a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit transmission electron microscope (FEI Europe, Eindhoven, Netherlands) by using a digital camera (Morada, Olympus Soft Image Solutions GmbH, M\u00fcnster, Germany).\n\nQuantification\nTo quantify the number of Ki67- or DCX-expressing cells, ten 40-\u03bcm consecutive and randomly selected sections at 200-\u03bcm intervals (n = 5 animals per group) were analyzed from 1.2 mm to \u22121.7 mm (anterior-posterior coordinates from Bregma). Under the 40X objective (field area = 0.64 mm\n2\n), the total number of labeled cells found between the ependyma and the brain parenchyma (250-\u03bcm from the ependymal surface) was quantified along the entire length of the lateral ventricle with the help of the X-Y positioning function of the computerized microscope. The double-labeling was quantified for those cells that clearly show discernible DAPI+ nuclei and that visibly match with cellular morphologies. Only the cells found in the same focal plane were quantified. The focal plane was set at the middle of the sections by checking the computerized Z-position of the microscope. This process was analyzed by overlapping pictures taken with a Zeiss Axio-Observer D1 microscope (G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) and Axio-Vision 4.8.1 acquisition Software (G\u00f6ttingen, Germany).\nThe cytoplasmic transformation of astrocytes was evaluated with a stereological grid, which provides an suitable estimation of reactive gliosis (\nGonzalez-Perez et al., 2001\n). Briefly, the test grid consisted of 10 concentric circles with a separation between them of 10 \u03bcm. At least 120 astrocyte somas per group were then placed in the central circle and the number of points at which cytoplasmic processes crossed the test grid lines was recorded under 400X magnification. All GFAP+ processes seen in the same plane of focus were considered for quantification. For imaging, a Zeiss Axio-Cam MRc5 (G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) was used and serial sections were made along the ventricles. Data were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error. Furthermore, in order to obtain a visual representation and the exact distribution of data, the cell quantifications were plotted using box-and-whisker graphs. The Mann\u2013Whitney \u201c\nU\n\u201d test was used to determine differences between groups. In all cases, the P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Nonparametric statistical analysis was chosen based on a kurtosis measure, which showed data distribution deviated from normality.\n\nHumans\nThe human portion of this study was approved by the institutional review board prior to the start of this study. In order to compare the size of the SVZ, corpus callosum, and internal capsule in humans with and without aqueductal stenosis (\nAS\n), T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (\nMRI\n) were obtained and reviewed from patients with and without AS. The MRI were obtained from the last 25 adult patients (age > 18 years) who were operated on for AS (\nSupplemental Video\n) and compared to 25 adult patients who underwent MRI for other reasons excluding intracranial mass and/or vascular pathology (arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm, cavernoma, stroke, etc.) at a single tertiary care institution. The groups were matched by age (\u00b1 1 year) and gender. The size of the SVZ, corpus callosum, and internal capsule were measured by a clinician blinded to patient diagnoses using cropped images of the SVZ, corpus callosum, and internal capsule to facilitate blinding. All measurements were taken at the level of the foramen of Monro. The size of the SVZ was calculated by averaging the distance from the lateral ventricle to the midpoint of the caudate head on both the left and right sides. The size of the corpus callosum was measured in the midline at the genu of the corpus callosum. The size of the internal capsule was calculated by averaging the width of the genu of the internal capsule on both the left and right sides. The differences in the sizes of the SVZ, corpus callosum, and internal capsule between patients with and without AS were assessed using Mann-Whitney \u201cU\u201d test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant."
