    "Methods": "2.1. Intrahippocampal kainic acid injection and electrode implantation\nStereotaxic surgery with IHKA injection and implantation of local field potential (LFP) electrodes was performed as previously described (\nZangrandi et al., 2016\n). Briefly, a bolus of 50 nl 20 mM kainic acid solution (Ocean Produce International, prepared in purified water) was injected into the CA1 area of the left hippocampus (AP -1.8 mm, ML +1.2 mm, DV -1.8 mm in reference to bregma) via a 30 G cannula attached to a 0.5 \u03bcl Hamilton syringe. After 10 min waiting time, the cannula was gradually withdrawn to minimize backflow along the injection path.\nFollowing KA injection, 2 depth electrodes consisting of a tungsten wire coated with epoxylite (diameter uncoated = 250 \u03bcm, FHC Inc., USA) soldered to a Teflon\u00ae-PFA-coated stainless steel wire (diameter uncoated = 203 \u03bcm, Science Products GmbH, Germany) ending with a gilded brass pin (Harwin, UK) were implanted bilaterally into CA1 (AP -1.8, ML \u00b11.3, DV -1.8) (\nFig. 1 B\n). Screw electrodes were secured above the motor cortex to record surface LFPs and over the cerebellum as grounding and reference. All electrodes were stabilized to the skull surface with Paladur\u00ae dental cement (Kulzer GmbH).\nFig. 1. Experimental timeline, schematic of the electrode implantation sites and representative LFP traces.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Experimental timeline for monitoring the development of epileptiform activity following IHKA in female mice. Females with established chronic epilepsy (>50 s/h ipsilateral HPDs) were subsequently tested with DZP (2.5 mg/kg), LTG (10 and 30 mg/kg), OXC (10 and 30 mg/kg) and LEV (100 and 300 mg/kg) compared to vehicle (10% DMSO and 90% saline with 3% Tween 80) i.p. in a volume of 10 \u03bcl/g. Treatment schedules were designed according to a Latin square crossover design with 72 h minimum resting period between injections. Afterwards, Nissl-stained brain sections were analyzed for morphological alterations. IHKA, intrahippocampal kainic acid; veh, vehicle; DZP, diazepam; LTG, lamotrigine; OXC, oxcarbazepine; LEV, levetiracetam; i.p., intraperitoneal; BW, body weight.\n(B) Schematic figure showing the electrode implantation sites. The black dots symbolize the 2 depth electrodes targeting the ipsilateral and the contralateral hippocampus (AP -1.8, ML \u00b11.3, DV -1.8). The black cross represents the single surface electrode implanted above the motor cortex, the grey cross the triple electrode for grounding and references positioned above the cerebellum.\n(C) Representative LFP trace of the ipsilateral hippocampus showing single spikes, spike trains and HPDs. Epileptiform spikes are characterized by an amplitude 2\u00d7 mode (green dots represent single spikes). Spike trains (marked with orange dots) are series of at least 3 epileptiform spikes lasting 1\u201310 s with \u22651.33 Hz. Trains of epileptiform spikes \u226510 s are counted as HPDs (red dots). In this exemplary trace the spike polarity is negative, a minority of animals, however, present with positive spikes. Red line = baseline for spike threshold detection set to amplitude minimum of 2\u00d7 mode.\n(D) LFP traces of a typical generalized seizure with approximately 30 s of high-amplitude, high-frequency discharges simultaneously both in the ipsi- and contralateral hippocampus as well as in the cortical electrode followed by a pronounced post-ictal depression of LFP activity.\n\n2.2. Animals\nAll experimental procedures involving animals were designed in compliance with the principles outlined in the ARRIVE guidelines and the Basel declaration including the 3R (replacement, reduction, refinement) concept. All animal experiments were approved by the Austrian Animal Testing Commission (Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research) in accordance with the EU Directive 2010/63/EU.\nFemale adult C57BL/6N mice (8\u201310 weeks at time of surgery) were used, either bred in-house or purchased from Charles River Germany. For breeding and maintenance, mice were group-housed (max. 5 mice in type II-L individually ventilated cages) under standard laboratory conditions with 12 h light-dark cycle (lights on 7 am - 7 pm) and freely accessible food and water. Post-surgery mice were single-caged.\n\n2.3. LFP recordings and analyses and experimental treatments\nTo monitor the development of epileptiform activity, 18 female mice were recorded once per week for 24 h for the first 5 weeks and at 2 months after IHKA injection. Mice with established chronic epilepsy (meeting the inclusion criterium of >50 s/h HPDs at the ipsilateral recording electrode at 2 months, termed high-HPDs group,\nn\n= 7) were subjected to subsequent experimental treatments. 10 and 30 mg/kg LTG, 10 and 30 mg/kg OXC, 100 and 300 mg/kg LEV (all from BioTechne), 2.5 mg/kg DZP (Takeda Austria GmbH) and vehicle (10% DMSO and 90% saline with 3% Tween 80) were administered i.p. in a volume of 10 \u03bcl/g body weight according to a Latin square crossover design. The minimum resting period between injections was 72 h.\nFor LFP acquisition in freely moving animals, wireless devices (Neurologger from either TSE systems or Evolocus) simultaneously recording 4 channels (sampling rate 512 Hz or 500 Hz depending on manufacturer) were used. All recordings were performed in the home cages placed within a recording chamber covered by a mesh of conductive wire to block electromagnetic fields.\nLFP traces were filtered between 0.5 and 70 Hz using a second-order Butterworth bandpass filter. Subsequently, the data were divided into 1 s long intervals of which the minimum or maximum (depending on epileptic spike polarity) was determined and the mode calculated. The baseline for spike threshold detection was set to an amplitude minimum or maximum of twice the mode calculated above. Spike trains were defined as series of at least 3 epileptiform spikes (amplitude 2\u00d7 mode, minimum distance between spikes 70 ms) lasting 1\u201310 s with a minimum of 1.33 Hz. Trains of epileptiform spikes with a duration \u226510 s were counted as HPDs (\nFig. 1 B\n). In addition, the LFP signals were visually scanned for generalized seizures (\nFig. 1 C\n) using LabChart Reader version 8.1.14 (ADInstruments). Generalized seizures were defined as high-amplitude, high-frequency discharges simultaneously present in all channels followed by a clear post-ictal depression of LFP signals.\nTo evaluate the effect of treatments on epileptiform activity, the number and cumulative duration of spike trains and HPDs in the ipsilateral hippocampus were assessed between 35 and 94 min after treatment. This analysis period was determined in accordance with previously reported times of peak effect in rodents after i.p. administration (\nBarton et al., 2001\n;\nKlitgaard et al., 1998\n;\nLuszczki et al., 2003\n) and to exclude a potential anti-seizure effect of the solvent DMSO observed for 30 min after injection in experiments by our lab (\nWidmann et al., 2023\n). Post-treatment data were compared to a baseline period of 1 h before the treatment, excluding 5 min immediately before and after the injection to minimize the confounding influence of handling stress. Recordings with a generalized seizure during the post-treatment period were excluded from this analysis.\nUsing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm with a 10 s sliding Hanning window the ipsilateral hippocampal LFP signal power was calculated, and divided into the following frequency bands which are typical for preclinical rodent studies (\nKadam et al., 2017\n): 1\u20134 Hz (delta), 4\u20138 Hz (theta), 8\u201313 Hz (alpha), 13\u201330 Hz (beta) and 30\u201380 Hz (gamma). In addition, the coastline, an aggregate of frequency and amplitude was computed (\nLieb et al., 2018\n).\n\n2.4. Nissl staining of frozen brain sections\nAfter sacrificing mice by cervical dislocation, the brains were extracted and immediately snap-frozen in - 70 \u00b0C 2-methylbutane. 20 \u03bcm coronal sections were cut on a cryotome (Microm Cryo-Star HM 560, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and mounted onto poly-L-lysine coated glass slides (Menzel GmbH & Co KG). Nissl staining was performed based on the protocol of Paxinos et al. (\nPaxinos and Watson, 1986\n). After 10 min fixation in 4% PFA in 1\u00d7 PBS the sections were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series (70%, 95%, 100%, 100%) and transferred to butyl acetate. Rehydration in a reverse ethanol series was followed by incubation in 0.5% cresyl violet solution for 20 min. Subsequently, the sections were again dehydrated in an increasing ethanol series and cleared in butyl acetate. Finally, the sections were embedded with Eukitt\u00ae mounting medium (ORSAtec GmbH) and glass coverslips. Images were taken with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with a 2.5\u00d7/0.075 Plan-Neofluar objective connected to a AxioCam MRc5 camera (Carl Zeiss AG).\n2 animals from the low-HPDs group (<50 s/h HPDs at 2 months), which were reinjected with KA after completion of the 2 months recordings of the development analysis, are neither included in any further LFP analysis nor in the morphological evaluation.\n\n2.5. Data and statistical analysis\nFor statistical analysis GraphPad Prism version 9.5.1 for macOS was used. The development of epileptiform activity in female mice was analyzed with a 1-way mixed-effects model for repeated measures (recording time point as independent factor). The subgroup analysis was performed by fitting a 2-way mixed-effects model for repeated measures (high/low-HPDs group and recording time point as independent factors) and Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test. For analyzing the effect of ASMs on epileptiform activity, a 2-way mixed-effects model for repeated measures (pre\u2013/post-treatment period and ASMs as independent factors) followed by \u0160\u00edd\u00e1k\u2019s multiple comparisons test was applied. The occurrence of generalized seizures after ASMs treatments was analyzed with Chi-square test. Given the log-normal distribution of the power bands data, a log-transformation was performed prior to a 2-way repeated measures ANOVA (pre\u2013/post-treatment period and ASMs as independent factors) followed by \u0160\u00edd\u00e0k\u2019s multiple comparisons test.\nP\n-values smaller than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), with data for individual animals also shown."

    "Methods": "2.1. Transient ischemia induction in laboratory animals\nA total of 84 Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes, aged 2\u20133 months, obtained from Envigo Laboratories, were randomly allocated to experimental groups: the sham group and the ischemia group. The ischemia group consisted of three subgroups: untreated, control shRNA-treated and tPA shRNA-treated. Rats were subjected to transient (1.5 hours or 2 hours) right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion as described recently by our group (\nChalla et al., 2022b\n). The modified neurological severity score (mNSS) assessment was performed on rats in the ischemia group at 2\u20134 hours and day 1 post-ischemia (\nNalamolu, Challa et al., 2021\n,\nNalamolu, Chelluboina et al., 2021\n). Rats that did not exhibit a mNSS between 8 and 12 at 2\u20134 hours or on day 1 after ischemia were excluded from the study. In addition, animals that died during the study period and animals with postmortem evidence of hemorrhage around the right MCA were excluded from the study. Furthermore, animals euthanized during the study due to excessive loss of body weight and inability to access food and water were excluded. All animal care, procedures, and the conducted experiments were in compliance with the scientific, humane, and ethical principles stated in the\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n(Publication no. 86\u201323 revised, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), in a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Illinois College of Medicine Peoria (UICOMP), and consistent with the guidelines stated in the \u201cIschemia Models: Procedural Refinements of In Vivo Experiments\u201d, and the \u201cARRIVE guidelines 2.0: Updated guidelines for reporting animal research\u201d (\nPercie du Sert, Nathalie et al., 2017\n,\nPercie du Sert, N. et al., 2020\n).\n\n2.2. ShRNA plasmids preparation and treatment\nThe tPA shRNA or scrambled sequence shRNA (control shRNA) plasmids were designed, constructed, and synthesized using pSilencer\n\u2122\n4.1-CMV neo vector (Ambion, Austin, TX) as described earlier (\nChalla et al., 2022b\n).The inverted repeat tPA shRNA sequences are shown in\ntable 1\n. This study utilized one of the positive clones validated through gene sequencing analysis at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The shRNA plasmids synthesized from overnight bacterial cultures using QIAGEN plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen, USA) were formulated as nanoparticles using the\nin vivo\n-jetPEI reagent (Polyplus transfection, Illkirch, France) and injected intravenously via tail vein at a dose of 1 mg/kg to ischemia-induced rats promptly (within 30 min) following reperfusion (\nFig. 1\n).\nFigure 1\nalso depicts the mechanism of action of tPA shRNA. The UICOMP\u2019s Institutional Biosafety Committee approved the synthesis and use of tPA and control shRNA plasmids.\nTable 1:\nPrimers used for the construction of tPA shRNA and real time PCR analysis.\nGene\nPrimer Sequence\nForward (5\u2019 - 3\u2019)\nReverse (5\u2019 - 3\u2019)\nPrimers for the construction of tPA shRNA\ntPA shRNA\ngatccgtacatagtccataaggaattcaaga\ngattccttatggactatgtactta\nagcttaagtacatagtccataaggaatctcttga\nattccttatggactatgtacg\nPrimers for real time PCR analysis\nMMP-1\ncagcagttatttgggctgaaag\ntttggtccaacgaggattgt\nMMP-3\nggaccagggattaatggagatg\nagcattggctgagtgaaaga\nMMP-9\ncactgtaactgggggcaact\ncacttcttgtcagcgtcgaa\n18S\nrRNA\nacgtctgccctatcaactttc\nttggatgtggtagccgtttc\nOpen in a new tab\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nSchematic representation of the tPA shRNA plasmid nanoparticle formulation administration to stroke-induced rats and the mechanism of tPA shRNA-mediated knockdown of tPA. Following the entry of plasmids into the nucleus of a cell, the CMV promoter and Drosha drive the formation of tPA pre-shRNA. Dicer processes tPA pre-shRNA, and the resulting tPA siRNA forms a complex with Ago and RISC. Ago, RISC, and tPA siRNA complex binds and destroys tPA mRNA and thereby prevents tPA protein translation. This figure was created with\nbiorender.com\nunder a paid subscription.\n\n2.3. TTC staining\nOn post-ischemic day 1, male and female rats from the experimental groups allocated for infarct volume assessment were euthanized. Brains were collected, placed in an adult rat brain matrix (Kent Scientific Corporation, USA), chilled in a freezer at \u221280 \u00b0C until hardened (~10 min), and then cut into 2-mm thick coronal sections. The brain sections were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a freshly prepared 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution (2% in 1xPBS) for 30\u201345 min. The non-ischemic (stained red) and total ipsilateral and contralateral areas of each coronal brain sections were traced and measured using the ImageJ analysis software (NIH). The percent infarct volume was calculated using the formula: Infarct volume (%) = [(volume of total contralateral hemisphere \u2013 volume of total non-ischemic ipsilateral hemisphere) / volume of total contralateral hemisphere] \u00d7 100. This formula takes into account the effect of volume changes in the hemisphere impacted by ischemia and reperfusion.\n\n2.4. Real-time PCR analysis\nRats from appropriate cohorts allocated for real time PCR analysis were euthanized on post-ischemic day 1 and total RNA was extracted from ischemic brain tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). Total RNA (1 \u03bcg) from each sample was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the\niScript cDNA Synthesis Kit\n(Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). The real time PCR reaction setup for each cDNA sample was assembled using the iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). The forward and reverse primers of target genes are listed in\ntable 1\n.\n18S\nrRNA served as the internal standard. Samples were subjected to the following PCR cycle: [95 \u00b0C for 5 min, (95 \u00b0C for 30 sec, 60 \u00b0C for 30 sec, 72 \u00b0C for 30 sec) \u00d7 40 cycles, and 72 \u00b0C for 5 min] in an iCycler IQ (Multi-Color Real-Time PCR Detection System; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California, USA). Data was collected and recorded using the iCycler IQ software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) and expressed as a function of the threshold cycle (Ct). The fold change in target gene expression in the test sample relative to the control sample was calculated using the formula 2^(\u0394Ct of control)/2^(\u0394Ct of test).\n\n2.5. Somatosensory and motor function evaluations\nIschemia-induced rats treated with either control shRNA or tPA shRNA were subjected to sticky tape (adhesive tape removal) and rotarod tests as described recently by our group (\nNalamolu, Challa et al., 2021\n,\nNalamolu, Chelluboina et al., 2021\n). Rats were trained to walk on a rotating rotarod for two or three days before ischemia induction. Trained rats that met the set standard (rotarod latency \u2265 60 sec) were included in the rotarod test. The tests were administered prior to ischemia (baseline) and at regular intervals (days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14) post-ischemia. Trained researchers blinded to treatments conducted the tests and collected the data.\n\n2.6. Animal perfusion, brain collection, and tissue sectioning\nFollowing the final assessment of sensorimotor function on post-ischemic day 14, rats were administered an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (~300 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused transcardially with ice-cold 1xPBS, followed by 10% buffered formalin solution. Following removal, the brains were postfixed in formalin and then cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in 1xPBS. The brains were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until sectioned on a cryostat (Leica CM1950). Frozen coronal sections (40-\u03bcm thick) were cut along the rostral-caudal axis of the forebrain (bregma: 2.70 mm to \u22125.8 mm). The sections extended from the frontoparietal cortex (at the level of the forceps minor corpus callosum) to the ventral hippocampus. Separate series of tissue (1 in 15 sections) were collected in 24-well polystyrene plates containing 1xPBS and 0.02% sodium azide. The tissue samples were stored at 4 \u00b0C in a refrigerator.\n\n2.7. Cresyl violet staining\nOne set of tissue (every 15th section, 14 in total) was mounted on glass slides coated with gelatin and chromium alum for each brain. The sections were dried overnight in a 37 \u00b0C oven before staining with cresyl violet acetate (0.1% w/v; Electron Microscopy Sciences). Sections were sequentially defatted in xylene, rehydrated in water with graded ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%, and 50%), stained with cresyl violet dye, rinsed in water and 50% ethanol, differentiated in 70% ethanol and 0.1% glacial acetic acid, dehydrated in ethanol (95%, 100%), and lastly cleared in xylene. The slides were then coverslipped with DPX mounting medium and left to dry in a fume hood undisturbed.\n\n2.8. Brain atrophy and infarct volume\nPrior to and following cresyl violet staining, each tissue section was scanned at a resolution \u22657500 dpi using a PrimeHisto XE slide scanner (Carolina Biological Supply, USA). In each section, the contralateral brain hemisphere, and the whole brain (contralateral + ipsilateral hemispheres) were manually traced and measured using the ImageJ analysis software (NIH) to obtain an area measurement (mm\n2\n). The cross-sectional areas were multiplied by the section thickness (0.04 mm) and the inverse of the section sampling fraction (15) to obtain the volume measurements (mm\n3\n). The percentage of atrophy in the lesioned hemisphere was calculated as follows: Percent atrophy = [(volume of the contralateral hemisphere - volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere) / volume of the contralateral hemisphere] \u00d7 100. The infarct volume was calculated using the method described by McBride et al (\nMcBride et al., 2015\n). The ratio of the infarcted area to the entire ipsilateral hemisphere was initially calculated. The fractional amount of infarcted tissue per section was multiplied by the area of the contralateral hemisphere of the brain corresponding to the same section. The sum of the corrected infarct areas across all sections was then multiplied by the distance between sections, as detailed above. Hence, this formula takes into account the effect of volume changes in the hemisphere impacted by ischemia in determining the volume of the infarct.\n\n2.9. Lateral Ventricular Enlargement\nA volumetric analysis was conducted on the lateral ventricles of the brain to determine the extent of ventricular enlargement after ischemic stroke. Eight serial sections (Sections 3\u201310) from each brain were examined, extending from the anterior striatum to the dorsal hippocampus (bregma: 1.5 mm to \u22122.7 mm, with sections 0.6 mm apart). The contralateral and ipsilateral ventricles in each section were outlined and the corresponding areas were determined to the nearest 0.01 \u03bcm\n2\n. The overall volume of each ventricle was calculated by multiplying the sum of the ventricle areas across all sections by the section thickness (0.04 mm) and the inverse of the section sampling fraction (15). In addition, the total volume of both lateral ventricles was calculated for each brain.\n\n2.10. White Matter Damage\nThe thickness of the corpus callosum, a structure composed of heavily myelinated nerve fibers connecting the cerebral hemispheres, was measured in unstained tissue sections to determine the extent of white matter damage in the brain after ischemic stroke. In each brain, three serial sections (Sections 5\u20137) of the corpus callosum were studied at the caudate putamen (0.6 mm apart; approximate bregma 0.3 mm to \u22120.9 mm). A vertical line was drawn from the dorsal to the ventral margins of the corpus callosum at the midline of each section. The distance of the line superimposed on the corpus callosum was measured to the nearest 0.1 \u03bcm using ImageJ. An average of six to ten measurements per section was used for data analysis.\n\n2.11. Statistical analysis\nStatistical analysis of the data was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.4.3 for Windows. The data identified as outliers by the Grubbs test were removed from the analysis. The quantitative data from each experiment was tested for normality and equality of variances. Based on the number of groups present in each experiment and the outcome of the normality and variance tests, appropriate statistical tests (Two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test, unpaired\nt\ntest with or without Welch\u2019s correction, and Pearson\nr\ntest) were performed to analyze the data. Differences between groups were considered significant at\np\n< 0.05. All data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nAnimal studies were performed in accordance with the guidelines established by the NIH and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of California, Irvine. All animal experiments were approved by IACUC (AUP 22\u2013097). All the data were generated using Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories). Rats were group housed (4 rats per cage) or housed in pairs, kept on a standard light-dark cycle (12 h each) at 23 \u00b0C \u00b1 1 \u00b0C room temperature and 45% \u00b1 10% humidity, and given a standard rodent chow diet (Envigo Teklad 2920\u00d7) by the University Laboratory Animal Resources (ULAR).\nA pilot study was first conducted in twelve 9-month-old female Sprague Dawley rats to determine the maximum tolerated CDDP regimen in this model. We had previously published that chronic CDDP (5 mg/kg/weekly, i.p.) for four consecutive weeks resulted in cognitive impairments in young adult male Sprague Dawley rats (\nLomeli et al., 2017\n) and therefore administered a starting dose of 5 mg/kg, i.p. This dose resulted in a 14.3% decline in baseline weight, therefore we dose-reduced to 3.5 mg/kg, i.p. which was associated with adverse toxicities (20% weight loss). Rats whose weight dropped by 20% were humanely euthanized. We dose-delayed to allow body weights to stabilize, and determined that 2.5 mg/kg, i.p. every other week (cumulative dose = 17.5 mg/kg) was well tolerated (weight loss < 20%) and proceeded to use this regimen for this study (\nSuppl. Fig. S1\n).\nIn this study, 28 nine-month-old female retired breeder Sprague Dawley rats weighing 409 \u00b1 45 g at the start of the study served as subjects. Rats were randomized into three groups: Control (CON,\nn\n= 8), Saline (SAL,\nn\n= 8), and Cisplatin (CDDP,\nn\n= 12). Rats were injected intraperitoneally with 2.5 mg/kg CDDP (Fresenius Kabi, USA, LLC.) dissolved in 0.9% NaCl every two weeks for a total of 7 cycles and a cumulative dose of 17.5 mg/kg CDDP. The SAL group received 0.9% NaCl, i.p., of equal volume. Mannitol (APP Pharmaceuticals, 250 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to all SAL and CDDP animals one hour before CDDP administration to minimize renal toxicity and increase diuresis. Control (CON) rats received no injections and were not subject to the medical stress protocol.\n\n2.2. Medical stress protocol\nCancer incidence increases with age, and stress related to cancer diagnosis and treatment is common and negatively impacts the mental health and quality of life of patients (\nMartins-Klein et al., 2021\n). To examine the effects of cisplatin chemotherapy and iatrogenic stress on serum BDNF levels, anxiety, and cognitive function in 9-month-old Sprague Dawley retired breeders, we developed a medical stress protocol to model the effects of environmental stress associated with cancer care. Rats were randomized into three groups, healthy controls (CON), saline (SAL), and cisplatin (CDDP). The rats were acclimated to the vivarium for two weeks. CDDP and SAL rats received 5\u201310 mL of 0.9% saline, s.q., five times a week during each CDDP cycle to reduce dehydration associated with CDDP. Three days post-CDDP administration, blood sampling from the lateral tail vein were used to assess serum BDNF levels in the CDDP and SAL rats. The rats were restrained using a Tailveiner\n\u00ae\nrestrainer (Braintree Scientific). A maximum of two blood draws were attempted per rat per timepoint. Subjects were weighed three times a week during the study. CON rats served as healthy age-matched controls and were not exposed to the medical stress protocol.\n\n2.3. BDNF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\n2.3.1. Serum BDNF measurements\nTo assess the effect of cisplatin on peripheral BDNF levels, blood was collected from the lateral tail vein of SAL and CDDP rats 72 h after each CDDP cycle. Approximately 50\u2013150 \u03bcL blood was collected per rat. In the CDDP and SAL groups, blood collection was attempted twice per rat per timepoint. Serum BDNF quantification in\nFig. 1\nH-L represents time points in which at least three serum samples were successfully collected and measured per group. SAL and CDDP serum BDNF levels were compared to the serum BDNF levels of age-matched controls (CON) collected at the terminal time point. Blood was clotted for 30 min at room temperature (25 \u00b0C) in 0.6 mL tubes, then centrifuged at 2000g for 15 min at room temperature. Serum (approximately 20\u201360 \u03bcl) was collected and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for further analysis. Serum concentrations of BDNF were measured using the Human/rat BDNF ELISA kit (Proteintech, KE00096) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions at a 1:10 dilution. All samples from each subject were assayed simultaneously on the same plate in triplicate to minimize run-to-run variability.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nChronic CDDP exposure and medical stress affect cognitive function and serum BDNF levels in a female middle-aged rat model. (A) Schematic representation of the experimental design. 9-month-old female retired-breeder Sprague Dawley rats were injected with vehicle (SAL, saline,\nn\n= 8) or cisplatin (CDDP, 2.5 mg/kg, i. p.,\nn\n= 12) once every two weeks for 13 weeks. CDDP and SAL rats were subjected to the medical stress protocol, which included hydration therapy (5\u201310 mL 0.9% saline/day, s.q.) for five consecutive days during CDDP treatment and lateral tail vein blood collections 72 h after each CDDP dose. Cage mates that did not receive CDDP/SAL injections nor blood collections served as healthy age-matched controls (CON,\nn\n= 8) for this study. Fourteen weeks after the start of CDDP treatment, all rats were assessed for anxiogenic behavior using the open field recognition test (OFT) and cognitive function using the novel object recognition task (NOR). Rats were euthanized ten weeks following the completion of CDDP, and serum was collected for BDNF analyses. (B) Effect of CDDP regimen on body weight (grams) over time.

(F) Medical stress and CDDP treatment impaired cognitive function as SAL and CDDP rats had a reduced preference for the novel object compared to the familiar object during NOR. (G) CDDP-exposed rats had a significantly lower discrimination ratio [(novel object exploration (sec))/(total object exploration (sec))] compared to healthy age-matched controls (CON). Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM; each point represents one rat (C-G). Not significant = ns, *\nP\n< 0.05, **\nP\n< 0.01, ***\nP\n< 0.001, ****\nP\n< 0.0001, as determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\nanalysis for multiple comparisons test. Figure prepared with BioRender.\n2.3.2. Hippocampal tissue BDNF measurements\nRats were deeply anesthetized with Euthasol\n\u00ae\n. After confirming sedation, the rats were perfused with ice-cold 0.9% saline\nvia\ntranscardiac perfusion. The brains were removed, and the hippocampi were snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until sample preparation. Hippocampi tissue was lysed using ice-cold Pierce RIPA Buffer (Thermo Scientific, 89900) containing 2\u00d7 Phosphatase Arrest (Gbiosciences, 786\u2013450) and Protease Inhibitor (Sigma, P3840) at a weight/volume ratio of 10:1. Samples were passed through a fine gauge needle to break up the tissue, and were incubated on ice for 30 min. Sample extracts were centrifuged at 10,000g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C, and the pellet was discarded. Protein concentration in the tissue lysates was quantified using a DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, 5000111). Lysates were aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further steps. We used the Human/rat BDNF ELISA kit (Proteintech, KE00096). An initial pilot study was performed with serial dilution of tissue lysates to determine the optimal lysate concentration. Once determined, all samples were tested at a 1:100 dilution and run in triplicate on the sample plate. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The BDNF concentration in each sample was normalized to total protein concentration to give the BDNF concentration per milligram of total soluble protein [pg/mg].\n\n2.4. Cognitive testing\n2.4.1. Open field test\nOpen field testing was conducted in CON, SAL, and CDDP rats, 14 weeks after the initiation of cisplatin chemotherapy (two weeks after cisplatin completion). To determine the effect of cisplatin on anxiogenic behavior after chronic chemotherapy, rats were placed in an open opaque square Plexiglas box arena (60 cm \u00d7 60 cm) with 60 cm high walls at the center of the arena and allowed to freely explore for a 10 min session. Rats were removed from the arena at the end of the session, and the arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol and dried before the subsequent session. Each session was recorded by an overhead video camera (Swann Security System) and analyzed manually by a blinded scorer. The arena was divided into a 30 cm \u00d7 30 cm center zone and a peripheral zone. The frequency of entrances and time spent in the center zone were quantified, with less time spent in the center zone considered anxiogenic behavior.\n2.4.2. Novel object recognition\nTo determine the effect of cisplatin on cognitive function after chronic chemotherapy, all rats were examined on the novel object recognition (NOR) task 14 weeks after the initiation of cisplatin chemotherapy. We conducted NOR testing as previously described (\nLomeli et al., 2017\n). Rats were placed in an open opaque Plexiglas box arena (60 cm \u00d7 60 cm) with 60 cm high walls containing two identical objects. Each rat explored the arena for 5 min per day for two consecutive days. The 5-min test trial was given 24 h later, during which the rat was presented with one of the familiar objects from the training phase paired with a new object. Total exploration time, time spent exploring each object (seconds), and the discrimination ratio (time spent exploring the novel object/total exploration time) were quantified.\n\n2.5. Primary rat hippocampal neuron cultures\nAs previously described, hippocampal neuron cultures are prepared from postnatal day 0 (P0) Sprague Dawley pups (\nLomeli et al., 2017\n;\nAndres et al., 2014\n;\nLomeli et al., 2020\n). Cells were plated at a 7.5 \u00d7 10\n3\ncells/coverslip density on 12 mm coverslips (Chemglass Life Sciences) pre-coated with 0.2 mg/mL poly-\nd\n-lysine (Sigma Aldrich). Cells were maintained in Neurobasal Plus Medium (NBM+) with B-27 Plus (Gibco) at 37 \u00b0 C and 5% CO\n2\n. On day\nin vitro\n3 (DIV3), cultures were treated with 5 \u03bcM arabinoside-cytosine (Sigma, C1768) to inhibit glial proliferation and refreshed twice a week with conditioned medium. Mature neurons were used for experiments on 17\u201321 days\nin vitro\n(17\u201321 DIV).\n\n2.6. Ovarian cancer cell lines\nThe established OVCAR8 and SKOV3.ip1 cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 300 mg/L\nl\n-Glutamine (Corning 10\u2013040-CV) containing 10% FBS (Omega Scientific, Inc) and 1\u00d7 penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). These cell lines were kindly gifted by Dr. Olga Razorenova.\n\n2.7. XTT assay\nThe cells were seeded at approximately 10 \u00d7 10\n3\ncells/well in a final volume of 200 \u03bcl in clear 96-well plates. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C at 5% CO2 for 72 h at the specified final concentrations of BDNF/riluzole/CX546/CX1739 \u00b1 Cisplatin. Cell viability was determined using the Biotium XTT Cell Viability Kit (Biotium 30007).\n\n2.8. Drug application in vitro\nIn vitro\n, recombinant human/murine/rat BDNF (Peprotech, 450\u201302) was reconstituted in 0.1% BSA in diH\n2\nO to make 100 \u03bcg/mL BDNF stocks and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. BDNF was diluted to a final concentration as specified in the respective cell culture medium. Riluzole (Sigma, R116-25MG) was dissolved in DMSO to make a 10 mM working solution. Riluzole was freshly prepared immediately before each\nin vitro\nexperiment to minimize loss of efficacy after freeze-thawing. Ampakine CX546 (Tocris, 2980/10) was made into a 100 mM stock by dissolving in DMSO and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. Ampakine CX1739 was obtained from Cortex Pharmaceuticals. CX1739 was made into 25 mM stocks in 33% (2-HydroxypiOpyl)-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HPCD) (made 1:1 in 0.9% NaCl and distilled H\n2\nO) (Sigma, 332607). All treatment groups were exposed to an equal volume of the respective vehicle for all experiments.\n\n2.9. Immunocytochemistry (ICC)\nNeurons were fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Thermo Scientific AC41678\u201300) in PBS pH 7.4 for 12 min. To evaluate dendritic branching, neurons were immunostained with an antibody against postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95). The cells were incubated with mouse anti-PSD-95 1:4000 (Thermo Fisher, MA1\u2013046) in 200 \u03bcl per well in blocking buffer (0.3% FBS, 0.1% Triton-X in PBS, pH 7.4) at 4 \u00b0C. The following day, coverslips were washed with PBS and incubated in goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 nm 1:500 (Jackson Immuno Research, NC0540445) at room temperature for 1.5 h. Coverslips were mounted on slides using DAPI Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech) mounting medium.\n\n2.10. PSD-95 puncta quantification\nDendritic spine density was quantified as the number of PSD-95 positive puncta on dendritic branches. Images were generated by confocal microscopy, Olympus FV3000. 3 \u03bcm z-series (0.5 \u03bcm steps) images were captured from dendrites that were clearly distinct from dendrites of other neurons and dendritic crossings at 60 \u00d7 1.5 zoom (NA 1.42) using an oil-immersion objective. Each experiment included 3 coverslips per treatment group, with 4 dendrites from 2 separate neurons analyzed per coverslip, for a total of 6 neurons, 12 dendrites per treatment group. Spine density was expressed as the number of PSD-95 puncta per 20 \u03bcm of dendritic length, extending to 100 \u03bcm from the soma. Images were processed for analyses by conversion into 8-bit black and white TIFF files, then scaled for distance per pixel length using Fiji. The distance from the soma was then measured and divided into 20 \u03bcm segments. Each individual puncta were considered a separate spine, and the number of PSD-95 puncta localized in clusters was adjusted based on the cluster size.\n\n2.11. Sholl analysis\nDendritic branching was evaluated using Sholl analysis. The total dendritic length was measured, and the number of intersections between branches and concentric circles at increasing 20 \u03bcm segments from the soma was quantified. Images were generated by confocal microscopy, Olympus FV3000. 8 \u03bcm z-series (1 \u03bcm steps) images were captured at 20\u00d7 (NA 0.75), spanning entire neurons. Each experiment included 3 coverslips per treatment group, with 3 neurons imaged per coverslip, for a total of 9 neurons per treatment group. Images were processed for analyses by conversion into 8-bit black and white TIFF files, and concentric circles were overlayed on the images using the Concentric Circles plug-in in Fiji.\n\n2.12. BDNF qPCR assay\nTotal RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), and cDNA was generated using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) as previously described (\nAndres et al., 2014\n). Quantitative PCR reactions (iQTM SYBR Green Supermix, Bio-Rad) were done using a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-time System.\nBDNF\ngene expression levels were normalized to\nGPADH\nexpression levels. The sequences for rat BDNF and GAPDH primer sets were:\nBDNFCDS\nforward 5\u2032-AAACGTCCACGGACAAGGCA-3\u2032, reverse 5\u2032-TTCTGGTCCTCATCCAGCAGC-3\u2032;\nGAPDH\nforward 5\u2032-CCTTCATTGACCTCAACTACAT-3\u2032, reverse 5\u2032-CCAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3\u2032. The primers were ordered from IDT, Integrated Device Technology, Inc., Coralville, Iowa, USA.\n\n2.13. Systematic analysis and statistical considerations\nEach experiment included three replicates per treatment group and was repeated twice. All imaging and analysis of PSD-95 and dendritic branching and behavioral testing were performed by two researchers blinded to the experimental conditions. All biochemical, behavioral, and imaging experiments were analyzed using one-way ANOVA or two-way repeated measures (RM)-ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\nmultiple comparisons test. All data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM, and significance levels were set at 0.05. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 Software."

    "Methods": "2.1. Mice\nAll animal experiments, procedures, and handling were performed according to protocols approved by the Georgetown University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, following all ethical standards and guidelines for animal welfare, including the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\nIn order to measure the induction of the\nCdkn2a\n(p16) promoter in vivo, we used B6J.Cg-\nCdkn2atm4Nesh\n/Mmnc mice (NIH Mutant Mouse Resource & Research Center). The transgene uses the endogenous\nCdkn2a\npromoter to drive expression of a tdTomato construct (\nLiu et al., 2019\n). These mice are heterozygous for the p16-tdTomato allele, expressing red fluorescence when the promoter is activated. We used six-month old mice (both male and female,\nn\n= 3\u20134 mice per treatment group) to reflect effects of our chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin, on any cancer where the drug is used.\nFor experiments on the effect of\nAPOE\ngenotype on the response of mice to chemotherapy, we used six-month old female\nAPOE\ntargeted-replacement mice on a C57BL/6 J background (\nAPOE\n-TR (\nSullivan et al., 1997\n)). These mice express\nAPOE3\nor\nAPOE4\nunder the endogenous mouse\nApoe\npromoter (rather than the mouse\nApoe\n) (\nSullivan et al., 1997\n). They allow exploration of the effects of the\nAPOE4\nallele risk on normal brain function or in the presence of various stressors compared to the most common\nAPOE3\nallele (\nLewandowski et al., 2020\n). Female\nAPOE3\n(\nn\n= 36) and\nAPOE4\n(\nn\n= 32) mice were used for these experiments because previous clinical (\nMandelblatt et al., 2018\n) and preclinical (\nDemby et al., 2020\n;\nSpeidell et al., 2019\n) work related to\nAPOE\nfocused on treatment of breast cancer, which is observed primarily in women.\n\n2.2. Chemotherapeutic drug exposure\nDoxorubicin hydrochloride was prepared as a 10 mM solution in ultrapure DMSO and kept at 4 \u00b0C for a maximum of one month before use. Doxorubicin was diluted in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and administered via intraperitoneal injection. For p16-tdTomato experiments, mice were injected with doxorubicin at 5 mg/kg or PBS vehicle control for three consecutive days. Two weeks after the final treatment, mice were euthanized by isoflurane and cardiac perfused with 15 ml ice cold PBS (\nFig. 1\n). Brains were extracted and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 6 h followed by sucrose gradient and embedding in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nDoxorubicin treatment paradigms for the two mouse models. 1. Mice with a tdTomato construct driven by the endogenous p16 (\nCdkn2a\n) promoter (\nn\n= 3\u20134) were injected at six-months of age with saline or doxorubicin, at 5 mg/kg daily over three days (small red arrows). Mice were euthanized 14 days later, and brain tissue was collected for immunofluorescence. 2.\nAPOE\ntargeted replacement (\nAPOE TR\n) mice at 6.5 to 7.5 months of age (n = 6\u20138 per group) were injected once with saline or doxorubicin, at 10 mg/kg (large red arrow). Mice were euthanized from 1 to 21 days later and brain tissue collected for RNA isolation and analysis.\nFor\nAPOE\n-TR mouse experiments, mice were injected once with vehicle control or 10 mg/kg doxorubicin; a single treatment was chosen to allow a simple determination of changes to gene expression from the time of exposure. Mice exposed to doxorubicin were euthanized one, three, seven, or 21 days following the injection by CO\n2\ninhalation; control mice exposed to PBS were euthanized three days following injection (\nn\n= 6\u20138 mice per treatment condition,\nAPOE\ngenotype and time point) (\nFig. 1\n). The mice were perfused with 5\u201310 ml of ice-cold PBS, and perfused brains were hemisected, with one hemisphere dissected into cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus, and snap-frozen.\n\n2.3. Immunohistochemistry\nFixed, OCT-embedded brains were sectioned coronally at 12um on a cryostat and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Slides were dried for 1 h followed by antigen retrieval according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Vector Laboratories). Sections were washed and permeabilized before being blocked with 5% donkey serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.4% Triton-X in Tris-buffered saline. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and applied overnight, followed by fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies and DAPI (the primary and secondary antibodies used are shown in\nTable 1\n). The tdTomato protein was visualized using an anti-RFP antibody raised in rabbit, and cell-type specific proteins were visualized with antibodies raised in other species. Slides were then mounted with fluoromount and coverslips, and allowed to dry. Images were collected on a Zeiss LSM 800 complete system confocal imager. Regions analyzed were the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (dentate gyrus and hilus), as well as the hypothalamus and choroid plexus. Two sections per region per brain were imaged. Confocal files were analyzed in ImageJ, where background was subtracted from individual channel tiffs. For each channel, tiffs were thresholded to a predetermined value and the percentage of the area field of view was measured. For co-localization, thresholded tiffs were processed through image calculator \u201cAND\u201d function before the percent area was measured.\nTable 1.\nPrimary antibodies.\nTarget\nSpecies\nDilution\nInformation\nSecondary antibody\nGFAP\nMouse\n1:500\nSigma G3893\nDonkey anti-Mouse, Alexa Fluor\n\u2122\n488\nIba1\nGoat\n1:300\nAbcam ab5076\nDonkey anti-Goat, Alexa Fluor\n\u2122\n488\nNeuN\nMouse\n1:200\nMillipore MAB377\nDonkey anti-Mouse, Alexa Fluor\n\u2122\n488\nNkx2.2\nMouse\n1:100\nDSHB 74.5A5-c\nDonkey anti-Mouse, Alexa Fluor\n\u2122\n488\nCd31/pecam1\nMouse\n1:200\nInvitrogen 14\u20130311-81\nDonkey anti-Mouse, Alexa Fluor\n\u2122\n488\nRFP (tdTomato)\nRabbit\n1:1000\nRockland 600\u2013401-379\nCy\n\u2122\n3 AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Rabbit\nOpen in a new tab\n\n2.4. RNA analyses\nFrozen samples of cerebral cortex (30\u201360 mg by weight) were used for RNA isolation using the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Kit according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Zymo Research). RNA quantity and quality were confirmed using Nanodrop spectroscopy. The nCounter\n\u00ae\nMouse Neuroinflammation Panel was used to quantify the absolute number of transcripts for 770 neuroinflammation-related genes (\nSupplemental data\n); it was performed at the Genomics & Epigenomics Shared Resource at Georgetown University. RNA was pooled from four brains for each of eight groups:\nAPOE3\ncontrol, and 3-, 7-, and 21-days post-doxorubicin exposure; and\nAPOE4\ncontrol, and 3-, 7-, and 21-days postdoxorubicin exposure. Data normalization for absolute transcript counts was based on housekeeping genes included in the panel. Genes of interest were identified based on fold-change differences of \u22651.5 between control and one or more doxorubicin-exposed time points in either or both\nAPOE3\nand\nAPOE4\ngenotypes.\nFor cDNA preparation from isolated RNA samples, the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) was used with 600\u20131000 ng total RNA; cDNA synthesis was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For quantitative analysis of transcripts, RT-qPCR was performed using cDNA samples diluted either 1:25 or 1:30 and normalized to GAPDH for each plate run.

    "Methods": "All experiments were performed in accordance with IACUC protocols approved by the University of California, Riverside, CA in keeping with the ARRIVE guidelines.\n\nFluid Percussion Injury:\nRandomly selected 8 to 10-week-old littermate male and female C57BL6/J mice were subjected to lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI) or sham injury. Briefly, mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame under isoflurane anesthesia and administered the local anesthetic 0.25% bupivacaine (subcutaneous). A 2.7 mm hole was trephined on the left side of the skull 2 mm caudal to bregma and 1 mm lateral from the sagittal suture. A Luer-Lok syringe hub with a 3 mm inner diameter was placed over the exposed dura and bonded to the skull with cyanoacrylate adhesive. The animals were returned to their home cage following recovery. One day later, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and attached to a fluid percussion injury device (Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, Model 01-B) directly at the metal nozzle. A pendulum was dropped to deliver a brief (20 ms) 1.5\u20131.7 atm impact on the intact dura. For sham injury, the animals underwent surgical implantation of the hub and were anesthetized and attached to the FPI device, but the pendulum was not dropped (\nSmith et al., 2012\n;\nGupta et al., 2022\n).\n\nSlice Preparation:\nNaive C57BL6/J mice and mice one week after FPI or sham injury were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated for slice preparation using established protocols (\nKorgaonkar et al., 2020b\n;\nAfrasiabi et al., 2021\n). Horizontal brain slices (300 \u03bcm) were prepared in ice-cold sucrose artificial CSF (sucrose-aCSF) containing the following (in mM): 85 NaCl, 75 sucrose, 24 NaHCO\n3\n, 25 glucose, 4 MgCl\n2\n, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, and 0.5 CaCl\n2\nusing a Leica VT1200S Vibratome (Wetzlar, Germany). Slices were incubated at 34\u00b0C for 30 min in an interface holding chamber containing an equal volume of sucrose-aCSF and recording aCSF, and subsequently were held at room temperature. The recording aCSF contained the following (in mM): 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 2 MgCl\n2\n, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, and 10 D-glucose. All solutions were saturated with 95% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\nand maintained at a pH of 7.4 for 1\u2013 6 h. Only sections on the side of injury were used in experiments.\nPhysiological Recordings\nVoltage clamp recordings of perforant path evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) were obtained from dentate GCs using recording electrodes (3 \u2013 6 M\u2126) containing a Cs-Methanesulfonate Internal (in mM): 140 Cs-Methane sulfonate, 5 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.2 Na-GTP, 5 Qx-314 with 0.2% biocytin. GCs were held at \u221270 mV, close to reversal potential for GABA, to isolate EPSCs (\nAndreasen and Hablitz, 1994\n). Evoked EPSCs were recorded in response to 0.1 to 2.0 mA stimuli, applied in 100 pA steps, through a concentric stimulus electrode positioned at the perforant path on the other side of the fissure from the dentate molecular layer. Peak amplitude of eEPSC was measured from the average of 3 to 5 responses at each step using ClampFit 10. A subset of recordings were obtained in a saturating concentration of gabazine (10 \u03bcM) to block both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA\nA\nreceptors.\nCurrent clamp recordings to assess GC pattern separation were obtained using filamented borosilicate glass electrodes (3 \u2013 6 M\u2126) containing (in mM): 126 K-gluconate, 4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 10 PO-creatinine with 0.2% biocytin. To assess cell health, GCs were held at \u221270 mV and responses to 1500 ms current steps from \u2212200 pA to threshold positive current injection in 40 pA steps were recorded. Cells with resting membrane potential positive to \u221255 mV were excluded from analysis.\nPattern Separation Paradigm and Analysis\nTo assess GC pattern separation, input trains of varying correlations were adopted from\nMadar et al. (2019a)\n. Each input correlation set included 5 temporally distinct trains at 10 Hz with an overall mean Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (R\nin\n) of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, or 0.95, designated henceforth as R25, R50, R75 and R95. The individual input trains (#1-#5) within an input correlation set were each 2 seconds long and were delivered at 2 second intervals. The 5 distinct input trains were delivered in sequence and the set was repeated 10 times for a total of 50 recorded trains (\nMadar et al., 2019a\n;\nMadar et al., 2021\n). Note that the average frequency of each input train was maintained at 10 Hz while in each set of 5 trains the timing of stimuli was varied to generate trains with different correlations.\nGCs were held at \u221270 mV in whole cell configuration and stimuli were delivered through a concentric stimulating electrode (10 \u03bcm tip diameter) placed in the outer molecular layer to activate perforant path fibers. Stimulus trains were delivered with intensity ranging from 0.1\u20132 mA at 0.5 Hz so as to elicit action potentials in response to approximately 50% of stimuli. Once stimulus intensity was set, it was maintained constant for all input sets recorded. Cell resting membrane potential and access resistance were assessed between input sets and recordings were terminated if access resistance increased over 20% or membrane depolarized beyond \u221255 mV. To assess the role of inhibition in temporal pattern separation, GCs were recorded and stimulated with input correlations of R75 in aCSF and then perfused with a sub-saturating concentration of gabazine (SR95531, 100nM), a GABA\nA\nreceptor antagonist as described in earlier studies (\nMadar et al., 2019b\n), and to avoid burst firing (not shown) that occurred in pilot studies using saturating gabazine (10 \u03bcM).\nFor quantification of GC pattern separation function, Pearson\u2019s R correlation was calculated on output spike train rasters as previously defined in\nMadar et al. (2019a)\nusing custom MATLAB code modified from:\nhttps://github.com/antoinemadar/PatSepSpikeTrains\n. Unless indicated otherwise, data were binned at 10 ms. For validation of pattern separation paradigm in na\u00efve mice, pairwise correlation of each GC spike output train (R\nout\n) was plotted against the predetermined correlation in the corresponding pairwise input spike trains. The five distinct input spike trains and their corresponding output spike trains are compared in a pairwise manner to assess correlation. Thus, the five input patterns yield 10 distinct R\nin\nvalues centered around the target R\nin\nand correspondingly, 10 R\nout\nvalues. These R\nin\n-R\nout\nsets were used to compare data between GCs from sham and FPI mice.\nTo assess the reliability of GC input-output coupling between experimental groups, we evaluated spike train reliability (R\nw\n) as a measure of the cell\u2019s ability to faithfully respond to multiple presentations of the same input train (effectively R\nin\n=1). R\nw\nwas calculated as the average correlation of output of a given GC in response to 10 presentations of the same input pattern in the R95 input set and then averaged across the 5 patterns.\nNovel Object Location Task and Analysis\nTo assess behavioral pattern separation, we implemented a novel object location task to test spatial discrimination (\nBekinschtein et al., 2013\n;\nMorales et al., 2021\n) in mice one week post FPI or sham injury. The task consisted of a circular arena 50 cm in diameter and 47 cm high with laboratory tape in varying patterns in four distinct locations on the white opaque arena walls serving as spatial visual cues. The experimenter room was separated from the testing room with the test arena by a closed door. The testing room was dimly lit with overhead lights using dimmer switch on lowest setting. Mice underwent four days of habituation for 10 minutes each followed by a sample and choice phase on day five. The testing arena and objects were cleaned with 70% ethanol in between each animal throughout the entire experiment. During habituation, mice were brought to the testing room from the vivarium, handled by the experimenter, and exposed to the testing arena for 10 min each day where they were allowed to explore freely. On test day, mice were first exposed to a sample phase for 10 min, with three identical objects placed 120 degrees and approximately 16 cm apart and allowed to freely explore the objects. Mice were then returned to their home cage for 30 min before the choice phase. During the choice phase, one object was placed in its original (familiar) location, one object was removed, and the last object was shifted by 60\u00b0 to a novel (unfamiliar) location. The mice were placed into the arena and allowed to explore the objects for five minutes. Videos were manually coded and analyzed by an experimenter blinded to animal injury status. Object exploration was counted as the number of times the animal\u2019s nose was within 0.5 cm of the object, with each continuous second counted as an additional exploration. Discrimination ratio was calculated as [Exploration of Object in Unfamiliar Location \u2013 Exploration of Object in Familiar Location] / [Total Exploration]. Total exploration was also compared between groups.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nImmunohistochemistry for \u0394FosB, somatostatin (SST), and parvalbumin (PV) was used to evaluate persistent neuronal activity (\nYou et al., 2017\n) and interneuron loss. Immediately following the novel object location task, mice were perfused transcardially with ice cold PBS followed by 4% PFA. Brains were excised and incubated in 4% PFA overnight and transferred to 30% sucrose for 2\u20133 days or until tissue sank. Brains were then flash frozen in OCT using liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C prior to cryosectioning. 20 \u03bcm serial sections were collected and mounted on SuperFrost slides and stored at \u221280\u00b0C prior to staining. Slides were stained for \u0394FosB, SST, or PV following standard procedures (\nNeuberger et al., 2017a\n;\nKorgaonkar et al., 2020b\n). Briefly, slides were allowed to thaw to room temperature (RT) for 10 min, washed with 1xPBS 3\u00d75min to wash off residual OCT. Slides were blocked in 10% normal goat serum in PBS + 0.3% Triton-X for one hour at RT, then incubated in anti- \u0394FosB, SST, or PV antibody (1:500, Cell Signaling D3S8R; SST: 1:100, Millipore MA5\u201316987; PV: 1:1000, Swant GP72) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Slides were then washed 3\u00d710 min with PBS and then incubated in goat anti-rabbit AF594 secondary antibody (1:1000, Invitrogen A11012) for \u0394FosB, goat anti-rat AF647 antibody (1:1000, Invitrogen A-21247) for SST goat anti-guinea pig AF647 antibody (1:1000, Invitrogen, A-21450) for PV for 1.5 hours at RT, washed 3\u00d710 min with PBS, and coverslipped using VectaShield with DAPI mounting media. Slides were imaged using Zeiss Axioscope Epifluorescence Microscope as single optical sections at 10x and 20x for analysis. Blinded analysis was performed using Cell Detection settings in QuPath 0.4.2 (\nhttps://qupath.github.io\n) with files coded without injury status. Briefly, for \u0394FosB and SST analysis, a ROI was drawn to outline the granule cell layer (GCL) using DAPI labeling to detect \u0394FosB positive cells and in the hilus to detect SST neurons. Detection parameters were kept consistent between sections, and 3 to 6 level matched sections were averaged in each mouse for analysis, depending on slice and image quality. Robust and sparse PV immunolabeled neuronal somata were counted manually on QuPath for full dentate region to include both hilar, GCL, and molecular layer PV interneurons. SST cell counts were normalized to total hilar area (in mm\n2\n). The hilar area averaged across sections was not different between sections from sham and FPI mice (area in mm\n2\n, sham: 1.11\u00b10.06 in 8 mice, FPI: 1.20\u00b10.09 in 6 mice, p=0.38 by Student\u2019s t-test).\n\nStatistical Analysis:\nStatistical analyses were conducted in GraphPad Prism 9. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normality, and appropriate parametric or non-parametric statistical analyses were conducted. F-test to compare variances was used to assess whether both sample groups undergoing statistical comparisons have equal standard deviations. All statistical comparisons were conducted at an alpha level of \u03b1 = 0.05. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA (TW-RM ANOVA), paired and unpaired Student\u2019s or Welch\u2019s t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test were used where appropriate."

C57BL/6J mice with loxp sites flanking the catalytic domain of PTEN (B6.129S4-PTEN\ntm1hwu\n/j; strain #006440; The Jackson Laboratory) were obtained and bred as homozygous breading pairs. Male mice were used for acute behavioral studies while female mice were used for chronic behavioral studies. Tract tracing experiments for the acute-treatment time point utilized a mix of male and female mice.

Overview of methods, experimental timelines, experimental groups, outcomes, and sample sizes.\nOpen in a new tab\nThree separate tracing procedures were performed throughout our experiments. First, AAVrg injections into the spinal cord retrogradely transport from the injection site into neurons throughout the brain. RFP reporter proteins are then anterogradely transported to fill axons above the lesion. Next, in a subset of mice, the corticospinal tract (CST) was traced by injecting biotinylated dextran amines (BDA; 10,000 kD) into the motor cortex to anterogradely label axons within the spinal cord. Finally, in another subset of mice, Fluorogold was injected into the spinal cord as a retrograde dye to detect surviving neurons throughout the brain, enabling visualization of neurons that lost RFP labeling. We utilized three major experiments to assess the efficacy of AAVrg\u2019s to knockout PTEN as a treatment for SCI. First, male mice were treated at the time of SCI and were evaluated bi-weekly for behavioral analyses for up to 9-weeks post-injury. Next, both male and female mice were treated at the time of injury and were labeled with either BDA or Fluorogold at 7-weeks post-injury. Finally, female mice were treated with AAVrg\u2019s at 12-weeks post-SCI, monitored for locomotor improvements bi-weekly, and either received BDA or Fluorogold labeling 9-months post-SCI. This image was created with\nBioRender.com\n.\nMice were injured between 11\u201313 weeks of age through a complete spinal crush injury at the T9 vertebral spinal level. Following dissection of the skin and musculature above the T9 vertebral process, a T9 laminectomy was performed and then crush injuries were performed using fine-tipped forceps as described in prior literature (\nDu et al., 2015\n;\nLiu et al., 2010\n). Forceps were closed on the spinal cord using care to ensure the tips were scraping the ventral aspect of the vertebral column to minimize the risk of sparing axons at the lesion. Significant force was applied to the forceps and the forceps were held closed for 8-seconds. For acute experiments, mice were suspended by vertebral clips immediately after crush SCI and 2-\u03bcL of AAVrg was injected at 2-mm rostral to the lesion, centered on midline of the spinal cord, and approximately 0.7-mm below the dura surface. Injections were performed on a stereotactic device using a Hamilton syringe containing a leur lock tip for interchangeable tips (80001; Hamilton Company, Reeno, NV). Fine glass-pulled pipette tips were purchased at a calibrated 10.0 \u03bcm diameter (TIP10TW1-L; World Precision Instruments, Sarasto, FL). The entire Hamilton syringe with fitted pipette tip was filled with mineral oil to create a hydraulic continuity between the plunger and aspirated virus. Virus was injected at a rate of 0.3 \u03bcL/minute and the needle was left in place for 3 minutes after finishing the injection. For chronic experiments, the spinal cord was re-exposed at 12 weeks post-SCI and 2 \u03bcL of AAVrg was injected as just described.\nFor all surgical procedures, mice were anesthetized using intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (100.0 mg/kg) and xylazine (10.0 mg/kg). Incisions of mice were sutured using absorbable sutures and the skin was closed using non-absorbable sutures. Mice were given antibiotic (enrofloxacin; 5.0 mg/kg), and saline (1.0-mL/day) support for 5 consecutive days after SCI. Analgesic support was provided using a 1x delivery of buprenorphine slow-release formulation (Buprenex SR, 1.0 mg/kg). Bladders of mice were expressed 2x/day for the duration of the study consisting of 9 weeks for acute experiments and 9 months for chronic experiments. AAVrg\u2019s were purchased from Addgene and included either AAVrg-hSyn-Cre-p2A-dTomato (1.5\u00d710\n13\nvg/mL; 107738-AAVrg; Addgene, Watertown, MA), which was used to knockout PTEN, or AAVrg-hSyn-mCherry (2.0\u00d710\n13\nvg/mL; 114472-AAVrg; Addgene, Watertown, MA) as a vector control. For our initial co-labeling experiments to identify the distribution of transfected neurons throughout the brain, we used AAVrg-hSyn-eGFP (1.7\u00d710\n13\nvg/mL; 50465-AAVrg; Addgene, Watertown, MA). AAV\u2019s were used undiluted after 2 freeze-thaw cycles, one to aliquot and the other prior to injections, as recommended by the manufacturer. pAAV-hSyn-Cre-P2A-dTomato was a gift from Rylan Larsen (Addgene viral prep # 107738-AAVrg;\nhttp://n2t.net/addgene:107738\n; RRID:Addgene_107738). pAAV-hSyn-mCherry was a gift from Karl Deisseroth (Addgene viral prep # 114472-AAVrg;\nhttp://n2t.net/addgene:114472\n; RRID:Addgene_114472). pAAV-hSyn-eGFP was a gift from Bryan Roth (Addgene viral prep # 50465-AAVrg;\nhttp://n2t.net/addgene:50465\n; RRID:Addgene_50465).\nMice in acute experiments were allowed to survive for up to 9 weeks post-SCI. The 9-week time-point was chosen due to prior work demonstrating a need to prolong experiments at least 9 weeks in order to detect regeneration of the corticospinal tract (CST) in mice receiving PTEN-KO delivered to the sensory-motor cortex (\nLiu et al., 2010\n). For chronic experiments, mice were allowed to survive for 9 months. The 9-month time-point was similarly chosen due to the singular report of PTEN-KO performed in chronic SCI that identified limited axon regeneration of the corticospinal tract at 4 months post-knockout with better regenerative effects detected at 7 months (\nDu et al., 2015\n). For chronic experiments, mice survived for a total of 3 months before treatment, and 6 months post-treatment, with the 6-month post-treatment time point being determined by the emergence of severe autophagia in several mice, unrelated to group assignment, causing early termination of the study.\n\nTract Tracing Procedures\nExperiments using tract tracing procedures utilized either Fluorogold (1.0% w/v; Fluorochrome; Denver, CO) injections into the spinal cord rostral to the lesion as a retrograde tracer or injections of biotinylated dextran amines (BDA, D1956; 10,000 kD, 10.0% w/v, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) into the motor cortex as an anterograde tracer to visualize the CST. Tracer injections were performed two weeks prior to euthanasia. Mice were anesthetized again with ketamine (100.0 mg/kg) and xylazine (10.0 mg/kg) and either had their lesion sites re-exposed or received craniotomies to expose the motor cortex of mice. Craniotomies were performed by gentle grinding of the skull using a rotary tool, and removal of the bone over the injection coordinates at \u22120.3, \u22120.8, \u22121.3 mm caudal to bregma at all 1.5, 1.0, \u22121.0, and \u22121.5 mm lateral to bregma. BDA injections (0.4 \u03bcL/injection) were made into all 12 locations at a rate of 0.3 \u03bcL/min using pre-pulled glass pipettes as described above, at a depth of approximately 0.6 mm below the dura surface. The needle was left in place for at least 1 minute after each injection. For Fluorogold injections, the spinal cord was revealed after removal of developed scar tissue over the dura and a pulled glass pipette, prepared as described above, was lowered approximately 0.7 mm below the dura surface. 1.0-\u03bcL of Fluorogold was injected into the spinal cord at least 2.0 mm rostral to the lesion to ensure effective labeling of axons that have died back away from the site of injury. The needle was left in place for at least 3-minutes after injection. Skin lesions over the skull were closed using reflex clips, while lesions over the spine were closed using non-absorbable sutures. All mice were treated with Buprenorphine-SR for analgesic support. For tract-tracing of the acute experiments only 1 mouse in the control group survived until scheduled euthanasia while 4 mice in the PTEN-KO survived. While not ideal, the main question under investigation was about the survival of neurons in the PTEN-KO group and viability of neurons labeled with the AAVrg was apparent in control-treated mice. In the chronic experiment, 3 control mice and 3 PTEN-KO mice survived.\n\nBehavioral Monitoring\nDue to the severe nature of complete crush SCI models, we did not predict any mouse to recover enough function to perform weight-supported stepping. Instead, if improvements were to be made, we estimated kinematic improvements would be detectable through increased range of motion of the legs. We chose to utilize the Basso Beattie and Bresnahan scale of locomotor improvements (\nBasso et al., 1995\n) (BBB), which was developed for rats with contusive SCI, rather than the Basso Mouse Scale (\nBasso et al., 2006\n) (BMS) that is developed for mice with contusive SCI, due to more resolution within the BBB at lower ranges of function. Unfortunately, there are no other standardized and objective measures within the SCI field to evaluate hind limb kinematic improvements prior to weight-supported abilities, which underlies the strength of using the BBB scale to assess this range on the continuum of recovery.\nAs described by\nBasso and colleagues (2006)\n, detection of range of motion of all joints in mice is challenging which is the rationale for only assessing ankle movement on the BMS as opposed to assessing the ankle, knee, and hip in the BBB. However, we chose to accept this limitation and move forward with utilizing the BBB rating scale. To acquire open field scores, mice were placed in an unfilled children\u2019s pool and allowed to explore for 4-minutes. Raters who were blinded to experimental groups assessed the hind-limb functions of mice using the 21-point BBB scale. Early stages of the BBB scale assess the range of motion of each of the 3 joints of the hind limbs indicated as either no movement, slight movement, or extensive movement, and include observations to characterize sweeping behaviors, all of which emerge before plantar placement of the paws. Evaluating the range of motion of all joints, characterizing sweeping behaviors, and separating pre- (BBB scores of 8 and below) vs post-weight supporting abilities (BBB scores above an 8) marks an increase in resolution on the BBB scale relative to the BMS scale for severe conditions of SCI. The BMS scale only evaluates the ankle joint, doesn\u2019t characterize sweeping behaviors, and combines pre-weight supported plantar placement, weight supported stance, and up to consistent weight-supported dorsal stepping as a single score (score of 3 on the BMS). The clustering of kinematic behaviors that transition from pre- to post-weight supporting abilities in the BMS scale provides significantly less resolution for discriminating differences occurring in severe, near-complete SCI. Mice were assessed at 1-week post-SCI and bi-weekly thereafter until euthanasia.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nTissue Prep\nAt 8-weeks post-SCI mice were again anesthetized using an overdose of ketamine (~200.0 mg/kg) and xylazine (~20.0 mg/kg) and perfused using 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by perfusion with 4.0% formaldehyde prepared from prilled paraformaldehyde (441244; Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. The brains and spinal cords of mice were isolated and post-fixed at room temperature in 4.0% formaldehyde for 2 hours. After post-fixation, cords were transferred and acclimated to 30.0% sucrose over the next week. The spinal cords and brains were frozen in Shandon M1 Embedding Matrix (FIS1310; ThermoFisher Scientific) and cut sagittal on a cryostat at \u221215.0 \u00b0C at 20.0 \u03bcm thickness. Cords were blocked together with at least two mice per group embedded in each block. For each immunohistochemistry stain, one section every 140.0 \u03bcm of tissue thickness was assessed. Brains were blocked together with one mouse per group embedded in each block. The brains were cut between the caudal end of the cerebellum and the rostral aspect of the motor cortex. Brains were cut at 20\u201330 \u03bcm and captured as serial sections on slides.\nImmunohistochemistry Sample Processing\nBefore performing immunohistochemistry (IHC), sections were dehydrated by immersion in graded ethanol baths containing 70-, 95-, and 100% ethanol and cleared of lipids by immersion in xylene for 5-minutes. We have found that clearing sections using organic solvents can often improve antibody penetration and labeling quality of thicker sections, particularly in the white matter, when IHC labeling is performed on slides. After rehydration of sections, when performing chromogen labeling, slides were treated with quenching buffer consisting of 60/40% PBS/methanol and 0.3% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 30-minues then washed in PBS. When performing fluorescence labeling, or after quenching during chromogen labeling, unspecific labeling was blocked using 60-minute incubations in 5.0% normal goat serum solution made in PBS and 0.1% Triton-X 100. All primary antibody labeling was performed at room temperature overnight. Secondary antibodies include Alexafluor-conjugated Goat anti-IgG/IgY (1:500; A11008, A21449; ThermoFisher Scientific.), peroxidase-conjugated Goat anti-IgG (1:250; PI-1000, Vector Laboratories), or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-IgG/IgY (1:1000; A16057; ThermoFisher Scientific) and were incubated for 1-hour in PBS and 0.1% Triton-X 100 at room temperature. Spinal cord sections labeled for fluorescence IHC were treated with True Black (0.5x; 23007; Biotium) after antibody labeling to reduce auto-fluorescence caused by lipofuscin accumulation in macrophages. All sections quantified together were stained at the same time.\nSpinal Cord Labeling\nSections were labeled to visualize the astrocyte scar using antibodies that target glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:3,000; Aves Labs) and co-labeled with \u03b2-tubulin III (\u03b23-Tub; 1:2,000, 5568S; Cell Signaling Technologies) to visualize axons within the lesion. The red fluorescence from both mCherry and dTomato, when present (see\ndiscussion\nbelow), was bright enough to not require immunohistochemical labeling. Serotonin (5-HT) positive axons were identified using chromogen labeling against 5-HT (1:4,000; 20080; ImmunoStar) and were either not co-labeled in the first acute experiment, or were co-labeled with GFAP (1:5,000) using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondaries to visualize the astroglia borders. The CST was labeled using the Avidin Biotin Complex method (ABC) to detect the BDA by incubating in ABC (5 \u03bcL/mL A and B; PK-6100; Vector Laboratories) overnight at room temperature and co-labeled against GFAP (1:5,000) to visualize astroglia borders. To validate the molecular efficiency of our viral vector approach to knockout PTEN, sections were labeled against PTEN (PTEN; 1:1,000; 9188T; Cell Signaling Technologies), and the expression at the lesion site was evaluated for an absence of labeling relative to controls.\n\nBrain Labeling\nBrain sections were examined to identify populations of neurons affected by the AAVrg approach. Anatomical identification of the motor cortex, red nucleus, caudal Raphe nucleus, and Locus Coeruleus was made either through landmark identification, morphology, or histological verification. The Locus Coeruleus was identified using histological identification of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH; 1:2,000; 22806; ImmunoStar) positive neuron clusters at the trunk of the cerebellar peduncle shaped as a half-moon. Serotonergic neurons within the caudal Raphe nucleus were histologically identified by labeling against 5-HT (1:4,000) and detected in the ventral-medial aspect of the brainstem. The red nucleus is easily identifiable by a bi-lateral circular cluster of neurons within the mid-brain that label vividly using AAVrg approaches, while neurons of the motor cortex are identifiable as the only neurons labeled within layer 5 of the cortex. In animals labeled with Fluorogold, similar brain regions were assessed for the expression of Fluorogold, NeuN as a pan-neuronal marker (NeuN; 1:2,000; NBP1\u201377686; Novus Biologicals), and the RFP expressed by the viral genome to determine differences in viability of infected neurons between groups.\n\nImaging and Quantification\nFluorescently labeled spinal cord sections were imaged using confocal microscopy to obtain the necessary pixel resolution and signal-to-noise ratio required for evaluating fine axon fibers within the lesion. Brain sections were imaged using conventional epifluorescence. Z-stack images were obtained and compressed into a single maximal intensity image projection file for analysis. GFAP lesion borders were identified on spinal cord sections and traced using Halo software (Indica Labs, Albuquerque, NM). The percentage and intensity of the lesion filled with axonal labeling were obtained after setting threshold parameters to identify positively labeled pixels. Next, the proportional area of \u03b2-tubulin III, RFP, and GFAP labeling above the lesion was quantified to evaluate neuron viability, reporter gene expression, as well as reactive astrogliosis. Finally, the extent of spared tissue at the lesion site was quantified in each section, with spared tissue defined as the region of continuous GFAP immunoreactivity (as validated previously)(\nKopper et al., 2019\n) spanning the lesion. A ruler tool on the Halo software was used to measure the thickness of continuous GFAP labeling at the thinnest point spanning the lesion in each section. The spared tissue length was averaged across all analyzed sections for each mouse and compared among groups to validate lesion completeness.\nTo quantify 5-HT labeling, first, sections were evaluated for evidence of axon growth across the lesion. The caudal lesion boundary of sections with evidence of 5-HT labeling was traced and an outward duplication of the trace performed to make new boundaries every 25- or 50-\u03bcm from the lesion border for the acute and chronic experiments respectively. Every location where a 5-HT axon crossed a trace was identified and counted. Due to the often beaded and non-continuous appearance of 5-HT labeling, axons with a visible trajectory crossing or approximating a boundary were also counted to ensure an accurate representation of axon growth. The frequency of axon-trace interactions was quantified and compared across groups. The average amount of axons crossing at each assessed distance per section was used for analysis.\nFor BDA labeling of the CST there were no BDA labeled axons caudal to the lesion in any animal, therefore quantification of regenerated CST was not performed. Instead, due to an unexpected but apparent loss of CST labeling in chronically treated PTEN-KO mice, the quality of CST labeling was categorically coded as either completely filled, moderately filled, sparse labeling, or no labeling. A reviewer who was blinded to group conditions analyzed all labeled sections for the visibility of CST labeling. Completely filled CST labeling was apparent through a dense central CST bundle usually apparent in multiple midline sections. Moderately filled CST labeling was considered when a singular CST bundle could be identified but had less density or appeared on fewer sections compared to completely filled examples. Sparse labeling was considered when axon collaterals could be detected in the grey matter, but no sections contained a singular or identifiable CST bundle. No labeling was considered when no axon collaterals were observed. Due to the technical complexity of BDA cortical injections, any animal with surgical notes questioning labeling quality were excluded from the assessment. Mice with evidence of complete or moderately labeled CST bundles were analyzed in one group, and mice with sparse or no labeling were delegated into a second group. The frequency of complete/moderately labeled vs sparse/no labeling was assessed using Chi-Squared.\nBrain sections were labeled using the same immunohistochemical strategy as for spinal cord sections. Neuronal populations of interest were identified to assess the distribution of affected brain regions at 2-weeks, 9-weeks, or 9-months post-SCI. Prior work by Blackmore and colleagues (2018) had identified minimal co-labeling within the Raphe nucleus and almost no labeling within the Locus Coeruleus at 2-weeks post-treatment (\nWang et al., 2018\n). Our study evaluated neurons at much longer time points post-treatment which gives significantly more time to either stop expressing, or start expressing, in ways undescribed from prior literature. To quantify total neuron density as well as RFP\n+\nand Fluorogold\n+\nneurons within the defined brain regions, we identified and traced between 2- and 7-sections encompassing the brain regions of interest in mice receiving Fluorogold at 6-months post-treatment. An automated algorithm in the Halo software was applied to determine neuron density as well as the percentage of neurons co-labeled with Fluorogold and/or RFP. Total neuron density per mm\n2\nwas determined by quantifying NeuN counts, as well as the relative proportion of neurons co-labeling with Fluorogold or RFP. Cell densities and the proportion of labeled neurons in each brain region were assessed, averaged between each analyzed section, and compared between groups.\n\nStatistics\nRepeated-measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to assess BBB scores as well as 5-HT axon regeneration beyond the lesion. Post-hoc comparisons were performed using Fisher\u2019s least significant differences when evaluating between-group effects on the repeated measures model, and Dunnett\u2019s pairwise comparisons when comparing within group effects on repeated measures designs. T-tests were used to compare axon labeling within the lesions, neuron densities in the brain, Fluorogold and RFP co-labeling, as well as \u03b23-Tub, RFP, and GFAP labeling area above the lesion. Chi-Squared was used to evaluate the frequency of occurrences when data was categorical. Probability values obtained at p < 0.05 were considered significant."

All 17 animals were assessed pre-injury and then randomly divided into two groups that received either hemisection injuries (nine rats) or contusion injuries (eight rats). Three animals with hemisection injuries were removed from the study due to autophagia of toes on their hind paw, leaving a final group size of six. One animal with a contusion injury was removed because the contusion was not delivered appropriately, and it was walking immediately upon recovering from the anesthesia leaving a final group size of seven. For each animal and injury condition, 5\u201315 locomotor bouts, with 9.1\u00b11.92 full step-cycles each, were analyzed.\nFor contusion and hemisection injuries animals were anesthetized (ketamine:xylazine, 80 mg/kg:4 mg/kg; Henry Schein Animal Health; Akorn Animal Health), the lower thoracic spinal column was surgically exposed using a dorsal approach and a T9 laminectomy was performed. The spine was immobilized at the T8 and T10 levels using custom-built stabilizers and the injuries were delivered as previously described for a mild-moderate (12.5 g-cm) mid-line contusion injury at T10 using an NYU Impactor device (\nMagnuson et al., 2009\n) or for a lateral hemisection using micro-scissors (\nBeaumont et al., 2006\n). Post-injury care included antibiotics, analgesics, daily manual bladder expression and supplemental fluids as previously described (\nMagnuson et al., 2009\n).\nThe lateral hemisection used results in complete loss of ascending and descending axons, including the dorsal column and corticospinal tract, on one side of the spinal cord. In contrast, the mild-moderate contusive injury results in essentially complete loss of the dorsal columns and corticospinal tract bilaterally and approximate 50% loss of dorsolateral, lateral, and ventrolateral white matter bilaterally. In most animals, the ventral columns were slightly more damaged than the lateral columns. Images/imaging of spinal cords from animals with similar injuries can be found in numerous publications (\nKim et al., 2012\n;\nBeaumont et al., 2006\n;\nBasso et al., 1995\n).\nLocomotion was assessed in a 3-m long Plexiglas tank where the walking surface was coated with sylgard to provide good grip. The rats were trained, two or three at a time, using food treats, to traverse the length of the tank, and this training strategy resulted in all animals utilizing left\u2013right synchronization of the hindlimbs on at least some of the recorded passes. Recordings were made using four high-speed (200 Hz) video cameras placed to capture the ventral view of the animal (\nFigure 1A\n). Custom software was used to stitch the videos together. Foot placement timing was recorded and analyzed as described below. Following multiple baseline assessments animals were divided into two groups, as described above, and given either lateral hemisection or midline contusion injuries. They were allowed to recover for at least 4 weeks at which time their locomotor function reached a plateau based on the standard BBB Open Field Locomotor Scale with mean scores of 15.7\u00b11.9 (contused) and 18.3\u00b10.8 (hemisected) on the scale out of 0\u201321 at day 42 post-injury (\nBasso et al., 1995\n). The animals were then re-introduced to the long-tank set-up and trained again (at least 2 at a time) to traverse the tank for a food treat. Multiple complete passes were then recorded for each animal. We did not assess, train, or otherwise manipulate the animals at early post-injury time points, beyond normal post-operative care, to avoid any potential functional impact.\n\nData analysis\nThe locomotor period or step-cycle duration was defined as the duration between the midstance time (halfway point between onset and offset of stance) of two consecutive steps of the reference limb (left hindlimb, if not noted otherwise); the frequency was defined as the reciprocal of the period. For each limb, stance and swing durations were calculated as the duration between onset and offset of stance and swing, respectively; the duty factors were calculated as the stance duration divided by the period; the stride lengths were calculated as the Euclidean distance between two consecutive ground contact points; and the instantaneous speeds were calculated as the average of the stride lengths of each limb divided by the period. Duty factors, stride lengths, and phase durations are reported as per-cycle averages across all limbs (if not otherwise noted), across forelimbs or hindlimbs only, or for individual limbs. Maximal speed was operationally defined as the 95\nth\npercentile of the instantaneous speeds. Limb-specific parameters were then averaged for all four limbs or for the forelimbs and hindlimbs separately. Normalized phase differences for each pair of limbs were calculated as the delay between the midstance times divided by the period. Phase differences (in radians) were calculated by multiplying the normalized phase differences by\n2\n\u03c0\n. Normalized phase differences are denoted by a bar over the variable.\nGait classification\nFor each step cycle, the gait was determined based on phase differences and the duty cycle. The trailing limb of a pair was defined as the limb that strikes the ground first; the one that strikes second was defined as the lead limb. First, each step was compared to all idealized one, two, three, and four beat gaits with equal phase-shifts between the beats (\nTable 1\n). A step was assigned to belong to the gait whose idealized representation was closest in phase-space. Then, pairs of gaits that only differ based on their lead limb were grouped together and walking and running gaits were separated based on whether the duty factor was larger (walking gaits) or smaller than 0.5 (running gaits).\nTable 1\nshows the normalized phase differences of all idealized gaits and the subsequent classification based on duty factor. Note that an additional two-beat gait with homolateral and diagonal normalized phase differences of 2/3 was introduced to better account for the fore\u2013hind asymmetry common in bound (\nBellardita and Kiehn, 2015\n;\nHildebrand, 1977\n).\nTo calculate the distance between each step and the idealized gaits, both steps and gaits were represented as points (\n\u03a6\nand\n\u03a8\n) in the three-dimensional space consisting of hind left\u2013right, homolateral, and diagonal phase differences (the trivial phase difference between the left hind limb and itself was omitted), and the distance was calculated as:\nd\n\u03a6\n,\n\u03a8\n=\n\u2211\nj\n=\nLR,HL,DIAG\narg\ne\ni\n\u22c5\n\u03d5\nj\n\u2212\n\u03c8\nj\n2\n.\nGait transitions\nA gait transition was defined as a step of one gait being followed by a step of another gait. Occurrences for each ordered pair of two gaits were calculated and assembled into a matrix\nA\n, where\na\ni\n,\nj\nis the number of steps of gait\ni\nthat were followed by gait\nj\n. Conditional probabilities of gait transitions were obtained by normalizing each element by the sum of elements in that row (shown in\nFigure 2H\n) and frequencies of gait transitions were obtained by normalizing each element of A by the total number of gait transitions (shown in\nFigure 2I\n).\nVariability of phase differences\nThe variability of the phase differences was quantified by calculating the deviation of the circular exponential moving average. The moving average of the phase differences reflects a weighted average of the most recent steps rather than of all steps and was iteratively calculated by\nS\n0\n=\n\u03d5\n0\n,\nand\nS\nn\n=\nS\nn\n\u2212\n1\n+\n\u03b1\n\u22c5\narg\ne\ni\n\u03d5\nn\n\u2212\nS\nn\n\u2212\n1\n,\nwhere\nn\nis the index for the step cycle within a given bout,\n\u03d5\nis the sequence of phase difference in radians, and\n\u03b1\nis the smoothing factor.\n\u03b1\nand the cutoff frequency\nf\nc\nare related as\n\u03b1\n=\nf\nc\n\u22c5\n2\n\u03c0\n/\nf\nc\n\u22c5\n2\n\u03c0\n+\n1\n.\nFor each bout, the mean deviation of a phase difference from its moving average was calculated as:\nmadev\n=\n1\n\u03c0\n\u2211\nn\n=\n0\nN\n\u2212\n1\narg\ne\ni\n\u03d5\nn\n\u2212\nS\nn\n/\nN\n.\nNote the normalization factor\n\u03c0\n. The cutoff frequency\nf\nc\nwas set to 0.125 step cycles.\nStatistics\nStatistical analysis was performed using lme4 1.1.31 (\nBates et al., 2015\n) and glmmTMB 1.1.5 (\nBrooks et al., 2017\n;\nKristensen et al., 2016\n) for R 4.2.2 (\nR Core Team, 2020\n) and using SciPy 1.9.1 (\nVirtanen et al., 2020\n), lmfit 1.0.3 (\ngithub.com/lmfit/lmfit-py\n), and NumPy 1.23.2 (\nHarris et al., 2020\n) for Python 3.10 (Python Software Foundation, Wilmington, Delaware, USA). The specific statistical models and methods used are listed in the following. For linear and generalized-linear mixed effect models, model assumptions were confirmed both by visually inspecting the quantile-quantile plots and histograms, and by performing distribution, dispersion, outlier, and quantile deviation tests using the DHARMa R package (\nHartig, 2022\n). If model assumptions were not met, link functions and error distributions that conform with the assumptions were selected. Linear mixed models were fit using lemr of the lme4 R package; generalized linear mixed models, or linear mixed models that require a dispersion model, were fit using glmmTMB. Mixed-model designs were chosen to adequately account for repeated measures and within as well as between animal variances. Marginal means were estimated using emmeans and reported as mean \u00b1 standard error. To account for multiple comparisons, Tukey\u2019s method was applied to all post-hoc tests.\nFor the comparison of locomotor speed, step frequency, stride length, and duty factor between the different gaits of intact rats (\nFigure 1C\n\u2013\nF\n) as well as of hemisected (\nFigure 5B\n\u2013\nE\n) and contused rats (\nFigure 7B\n\u2013\nE\n), separate linear mixed models with gait as a fixed effect and a by-subject random intercept were calculated. Degrees of freedom were adjusted using the Kenward-Roger method to account for violations of sphericity.\nFor the comparison of locomotor speed, step frequency, stride length, duty factor, and maximal speed (\nFigure 2B\n\u2013\nF\n) between pre-injury (intact) rats and rats following either hemisection or contusion (injury type), separate mixed models with injury type as the fixed effect, a per-rat random intercept and a random slope of injury type, as well as a full-factorial dispersion model were calculated using glmmTMB. For speed, frequency, and maximal speed, linear mixed models were calculated; for stride length, a log link was used; for duty factor, a Gamma error distribution and a logit link function was used.\nTo assess differences of left\u2013right forelimb and hindlimb phase differences during trot between intact and hemisected animals (\nFigure 6\n), separate linear mixed models with injury type as the fixed effect, a per-rat random intercept and slope of injury type, as well as a full-factorial dispersion model were calculated using glmmTMB.\nFor comparison of the mean deviations of phase differences from their moving average between injury type and limb pairs (\nFigure 10\n), a generalized linear mixed model with injury type (intact, hemisection, contusion) and phase difference (left\u2013right hindlimb, left\u2013right forelimb, homolateral and diagonal on each side) as well as their interaction effect as fixed effects, a per-animal random offset, and a full factorial dispersion model was calculated. A logit link function and beta distribution were used to account for the non-normality of the residuals.\nTo assess speed-dependent modulation of gait characteristic of intact and injured rats (\nFigure 3\n), linear and non-linear regressions were performed on a per-animal and injury type basis using lmfit. Group averages were calculated using the average of the individual regression results and the confidence interval\nCI\nwas calculated using the delta method:\nCI\n=\n1.96\n\u22c5\n\u2207\nf\n\u03bc\n\u03b2\n,\nv\nT\n\u22c5\nC\no\nv\n\u03b2\n\u22c5\n\u2207\nf\n\u03bc\n\u03b2\n,\nv\n,\nwhere\nf\nis the regression function and\n\u2207\nf\nit\u2019s gradient,\n\u03bc\n\u03b2\nthe average parameter estimates,\nv\nthe instantaneous locomotor speed, and\nC\no\nv\n\u03b2\nthe average variance-covariance matrix of the individual parameter estimates. Linear regressions\nf\n\u03b2\n,\nv\n=\n\u03b2\n0\n+\n\u03b2\n1\n\u2217\nv\nwere calculated for the stride length, forelimb and hindlimb duty factor and forelimb and hindlimb swing duration; non-linear regressions with an inverse function\nf\n\u03b2\n,\nv\n=\n\u03b2\n0\n+\n\u03b2\n1\n\u2217\nv\n\u2212\n1\nwere calculated for the step cycle duration and forelimb and hindlimb stance duration.\nTo quantify the distribution of individual steps on a continuum in phase-space (\nFigure 9\n), we calculated the projection\n\u03bb\ni\nof the\ni\n-th step\n\u03a6\ni\nfrom a vector defined by two average or idealized gaits (\n\u03a8\nA\nand\n\u03a8\nB\n):\n\u03bb\ni\n,\n0\n=\n\u03a6\ni\n\u2212\n\u03a8\nA\n\u22c5\nu\n^\n,\nwhere\nu\n^\n=\n\u03a8\nB\n\u2212\n\u03a8\nA\n/\n\u03a8\nB\n\u2212\n\u03a8\nA\n,\n\u03a6\ni\n,\n\u03a8\nA\n, and\n\u03a8\nB\nare points in the three-dimensional space of left\u2013right hindlimb, homolateral, and diagonal phase-differences. To account for the circular nature of phase differences, the projections were recalculated by shifting the reference position by\n\u00b1\n2\n\u03c0\nu\n^\n:\n\u03bb\ni\n,\n1\n=\n\u03a6\ni\n\u2212\n\u03a8\nA\n+\n2\n\u03c0\n\u22c5\nu\n^\n\u22c5\nu\n^\n+\n2\n\u03c0\n,\n\u03bb\ni\n,\n\u2212\n1\n=\n\u03a6\ni\n\u2212\n\u03a8\nA\n\u2212\n2\n\u03c0\n\u22c5\nu\n^\n\u22c5\nu\n^\n\u2212\n2\n\u03c0\n,\nand selecting the projection (\n\u03bb\ni\n,0\n,\n\u03bb\ni\n,1\n,\n\u03bb\ni\n,\n\u2212\n1\n) for which the distance to the line is minimal\n\u03bb\ni\n=\nmin\nj\n=\n0\n,\n1\n,\n\u2212\n1\nd\n\u03a6\ni\n,\u03a8\nA\n+\n\u03bb\ni\n,\nj\n\u22c5\nu\n^\n.\nFurthermore, values of\n\u03bb\ni\nwere restricted to\n\u03bb\ni\n\u2264\n2\n\u03c0\n:\n\u03bb\ni\n=\n\u03bb\ni\nif\n\u03bb\ni\n\u2264\n2\n\u03c0\n2\n\u03c0\n\u22c5\nsgn\n\u03bb\ni\nelse\n.\nTo assess the model fit, the coefficient of determination was calculated per animal and across animals:\nR\n2\n=\n1\n\u2212\n\u2211\ni\nd\n\u03a6\ni\n,\n\u03a8\nA\n+\n\u03bb\ni\n\u22c5\nu\n^\n2\n\u2211\ni\nd\n\u03a6\ni\n,\n\u03bc\n\u03a6\n2\n,\nwhere\n\u03bc\n\u03a6\nis the grand circular mean of\n\u03a6\n.

Rats were given at least one week to acclimate to the facility prior to study. All rats were given food and water\nad-libitum\nthroughout the duration of the study and maintained of a 14:10 hour dark:light cycle. At the time of surgery and randomization rats were on average at 3.3\u00b10.3 months of age and 362\u00b125g of weight (\nTable 1\n). All rats underwent unilateral VML injury to the left tibialis anterior (TA) muscle, and were randomized to terminal groups of 3, 7, 14, 21, or 48 days. At the terminal time point all rats were euthanized while under isoflurane anesthesia by pentobarbital injection (>100mg/kg). TA muscles were harvested from injured (left) and contralateral (right) hindlimbs at the given terminal timepoints for histological and biochemical analysis. As previously conducted\n1\n, muscles from the contralateral limbs were used as controls for all outcome measures; the term \u201ccontrol\u201d herein will refer to a group of contralateral muscles combined from all timepoints.\nTable 1.\nWhole body and skeletal muscle characteristics\nDays post-VML\nContralateral control (n=40)\n3 (n=8)\n7 (n=8)\n14 (n=8)\n21 (n=8)\n48 (n=8)\nOne-way ANOVA p- value\nSurgical body weight (g)\n- -\n366.1 \u00b1 31.2\n365.9 \u00b1 25.8\n353.6 \u00b1 26.9\n359.8 \u00b1 15.1\n365.3 \u00b1 26.6\n0.836\nTerminal body weight (g)\n- -\n357.0 \u00b1 23.4\n356.6 \u00b1 22.6\n363.8 \u00b1 21.7\n376.3 \u00b1 11.1\n441.8 \u00b1 25.4\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n<0.001\nInjured TA weight (mg)\n- -\n642.8 \u00b1 71.9\n\u2021\n533.8 \u00b1 60.5\n488.5 \u00b1 83.4\n513.8 \u00b1 90.0\n587.9 \u00b1 134.8\n0.014\nControl TA weight (mg)\n- -\n610.4 \u00b1 15.2\n578.4 \u00b1 49.9\n629.8 \u00b1 42.4\n655.3 \u00b1 27.7\n691.1 \u00b1 36.9\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n<0.001\nVML Injured TA/body weight\n1.68 \u00b1 0.11\n1.80 \u00b1 0.17\n1.50 \u00b1 0.14\n1.34 \u00b1 0.22\n\u00a5\n*\n1.36 \u00b1 0.23\n\u00a5\n*\n1.33 \u00b1 0.28\n\u00a5\n*\n<0.001\n(mg/g)\nOpen in a new tab\nSignificantly different than\n\u00a5\nControl\n*\n3\n\u2020\n7\n\u2021\n14; or\n\u00a7\n21 days post-VML\n\nSurgical creation of volumetric muscle loss injury\nAll rats underwent surgery to create a full thickness VML injury to the left TA muscle, as previously described\n34\n. Rats received subcutaneous analgesic injection (SR buprenorphine, 1.2mg/kg) roughly 2 hours prior to surgery. Rats were then anesthetized using isoflurane (1.5\u20133.0%) throughout the duration of the surgery. An anterior incision was made through the skin, and the fascia was cut to expose the TA muscle. A metal plate was inserted behind the TA, and a 6mm punch biopsy was taken to remove ~20% (86.1\u00b112.6mg) of the TA muscle. Following VML injury, the fascia and skin were closed in layers. Rats were monitored twice daily for three days post-surgery, and once a week thereafter for signs of pain and complications per IACUC guidelines. All rats recovered promptly after surgery and surgical incisions healed promptly after surgery. There were no adverse events in the study.\n\nHistological and image analyses\nFor each terminal timepoint, 3\u201348 days post-VML, the medial superior quadrant of both right and left TA muscles was harvested and mounted longitudinally for histological and immunofluorescence evaluation. This portion of muscle was chosen based on the abundance of NMJs identified by motor end plate mapping and previous experience\n35\n,\n1\n. Muscle tissues were mounted on cork squares using tragacanth gum. The tissue was placed in 2-methylbutane cooled by liquid nitrogen to freeze, and subsequently stored in a \u221280\u00b0C freezer until further analysis. For tSC cell staining, muscles were sectioned at 100\u03bcm and pinned into a Sylgard\n\u00ae\ncoated dish. Sections were then placed in the following sequence of solutions: 4% paraformaldehyde for ~45 minutes; washed with PBS; \u03b1-Bungarotoxin, Alexa Fluor 555 conjugate (Invitrogen,\nB35451\n, 1.33\u03bcg/ml in PBS) for ~45 minutes; washed with PBS; 4% Triton X-100-PBS for ~90 minutes; 10% goat serum in 2% Triton X-100-PBS for 30 minutes. The sections were then placed in the following primary antibody solution overnight at room temperature: ready-to-use rabbit anti-S100 (Agilent Dako Omnis, GA50461\u20132), mouse anti-neurofilament (DSHB, 2H3, 1.2\u03bcg/ml) and mouse anti-synaptic vesicles (DSHB, SV2, 0.05\u03bcg/ml), in 5% goat serum. Sections were washed in PBS 6\u00d710 minutes before being placed in the following secondary antibody solution (all in PBS) for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C: Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG1 (6.67\u03bcg/ml), Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rabbit IgG (6.67\u03bcg/ml), and DAPI (1\u03bcg/ml). Before imaging, sections were unpinned from the dish and transferred to a microscope slide (Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus, 12-550-15). A drop of mounting media (Invitrogen ProLong Diamond Antifade,\nP36970\n) was placed onto each section and a #1.5H coverslip (Thorlabs, CG15KH) was pressed and held firmly over the sections with weights for ~15\u201330 minutes. Slides were kept at room temperature and protected from light for 2\u20133 days before imaging to achieve optimal refractive index.\nImages were taken using a Nikon C2 upright confocal microscope equipped with a Plan Apo 20X objective (0.75 NA, DIC N2) and dual GaSP detectors (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY). A 512\u00d7512 scan area was used for each image with 5x zoom (0.25\u03bcm pixel size). Laser intensity and gain settings were established during the initial imaging session and kept within a limited range throughout the study to maintain imaging consistency. The following settings were used for each laser within a range of \u00b15, in order to ensure the full dynamic range of signal was being captured: DAPI (Intensity: 8, Gain: 10); FITC (Intensity: 10, Gain: 14); TRITC (Intensity: 38, Gain: 43); Cy5 (Intensity: 10, Gain: 14). In total, 32\u00b14\nen face\nNMJs per TA muscle were identified and imaged (255\u00b17 per timepoint). Selected NMJs were no more than 50\u03bcm deep to minimize possible effects of antibody penetration or optical distortion. In all cases, the expected staining patterns in normal skeletal muscle were observed and the specificity of anti-labeling was confirmed by the absence of staining outside expected neural structures, consistent with manufacturer\u2019s technical information, and previous experience. Observations while imaging indicated a spatial gradient of diffuse and unorganized AchR staining near the site of injury that becomes more organized into discrete NMJs further from the site of injury (\nFig. S1\n&\nS2\n). All selected NMJs were\nen face\nand visibly a single synapse with identifiable boundaries. For the purpose of publication only, images were produced in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA) by down-converting multi-TIFF files to 8-bit single-channel images without introducing any changes in brightness or contrast.\nEach image was coded and the 2D maximal intensity projection was qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by a blinded observer. The number of tSCs per NMJ was quantified by counting cell bodies identified by both positive S100 and DAPI staining over the NMJ. The frequency of tSC sprouting was quantified as a binary \u2018yes/no\u2019 per NMJ at the discretion of the blinded observer, identified as S100 positive protrusions of any length. Innervation of each NMJ was qualitatively assessed by comparing the overlap area of pre-synapse (2H3/SV2) to the area of post-synapse (\u03b1-BTX) staining. Classification of denervation of an individual NMJ was determined if a partial or complete lack of co-localization was observed between the pre- and post-synaptic terminals. The number of discrete post-synaptic fragments was hand-counted by the blinded observer.\nFor tSC morphology data, images from both control and 48 days post-injury were cropped as close to the NMJ as possible, to minimize the amount of non-synaptic staining in frame. Areas identified as tSC positive but extending outside of the post-synapse were also included. Images were then quantitatively analyzed by a blinded observer using a custom script in Nikon Elements General Analysis 3 (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY). Briefly, image slices were converted into maximum intensity projections and pixel threshold values for tSC and post-synaptic channels were manually set based on observer visibility, due to pixel intensity differences caused by differing depths of each NMJ. Once the threshold values were set, 2D areas for each channel, including their co-localization (area positive for both tSC and post-synaptic staining), were calculated. Percent tSC coverage was then quantified by dividing the co-localization area by the total post-synaptic area. Percent tSC extension was quantified by first subtracting the co-localization area from the total tSC area to get the area of tSC extension (or area not overlapped with the post-synapse). This area was then divided by the total tSC area to get percent extension.\n\nBiochemical analyses\nFollowing harvest, the lateral superior quadrant of both right and left TA muscles was snap frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. Tissues were homogenized at a 1:5 dilution (mg/\u03bcl) in cell lysis buffer (Bio-Rad, 171304011) using a Next Advance Bullet Blender with stainless steel beads. A single 3.2 mm bead (Next Advance, SSB32) and one scoop 0.9\u20132.0 mm beads (Next Advance, SSB14B) were added to 1.5ml safe-lock tubes (Eppendorf, 022363212) over ice, along with the tissue and buffer. Samples were run for 5 minutes at the highest speed, placed on a nutating mixer for 30 minutes, and then run twice more for 2 minutes, or until fully homogenized. The resulting homogenate went through one freeze-thaw cycle before centrifuging at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes at 10,500\ng\n. The supernatant was then aliquoted for storage at \u221280\u00b0C. Quantification of BDNF content was conducted by ELISA (R&D Systems, DBNT00), per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\nProtein was separated (~50\u03bcg) by 4\u201320% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a PVDF membrane, and immunoblotted. Anti-NRG1 (Invitrogen, MA5\u201312896, 0.4\u03bcg/ml) primary antibody was detected using a corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling #7076, 1:1000). Immunoblots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk, and primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 5% nonfat milk, followed by incubation in Clarity Max ECL Western Blotting Substrate for protein detection (Bio-Rad). Immunoblots were visualized with stain-free and chemiluminescent imaging on a ChemiDoc System (Bio-Rad) for total lane protein and band intensity quantification, respectively. Neuregulin-1 was detected at 50 and 26 kDa, corresponding with molecular weights noted by others\n36\n,\n37\n.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAnalysis was performed with GraphPad Prism (version 9.2.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). During all evaluations the research team was blinded to the experimental groups. For individual NMJ analyses, all NMJs in a given timepoint were treated as separate samples. Dependent variables for controls, day 3, 7, 14, 21, and 48 were analyzed by one-way or two-way ANOVA across time points where appropriate. When significance was found, Tukey\u2019s HSD post-hoc analysis was used to ascertain specific time point significance. A mixed-effects model with \u0160id\u00e1k\u2019s correction for multiple comparisons was used for the same data stratified by innervation. When appropriate, Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient and simple linear regression was used to assess relationships between two variables. For comparisons of control and day 48 alone, an unpaired student\u2019s t-test was performed. Statistical significance level was set at p\u22640.05. Data are presented as mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD)."

    "Methods": "2.1. Quantifying the Proximity to a Telomere\nTo quantitively determine the approximate proximities to a telomere in million bases (Mb), we obtained human, mouse, and rat genomic information using the NCBI Genome Data Viewer (\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/gdv/\n). In each sample obtained, we observed the following: coordinates (or locus) of each gene and its telomere, which chromosome number the genetic locus was found, the distance between each gene and its telomere, and the corresponding GenBank accession number that begins with \u201cNM_ _ _ _ _\u201d in a separate spreadsheet as an electronic file. This allowed us to view the full exon sequences of the chosen gene at the open nucleotide database (\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/\n).\n\n2.2. Calculating A+T content\nAfter obtaining the complete sequences from the nucleotide database, we used two independent GC content calculators as mutually complementary backup tools when one server is down. These are available online at\nhttps://www.sciencebuddies/org\nand\nhttps://www.biologicscorp.com/tools/GCContent/#.XvctCi-z2uV\nto derive the A+T content percentage of the nucleotides in each desired gene. From this data, the appropriate structures of adenine (A) and thymine (T) were determined along with the complete base-pair sizes of the nucleotide (\nLucas et al., 2021\n;\nMcKnight et al., 2021\n;\nRaines et al., 2022\n).\n\n2.3. Theoretical Basis of Approximating the Proximity to a Telomere\nThe suggestions by Nusbaum and colleagues (\nNusbaum et al., 2006\n) were used where high mutation rates were displayed in human chromosomes. In the study presented, the previous method was employed as the proximity to a telomere in a gene data was collected (\nLucas et al., 2021\n;\nMcKnight et al., 2021\n;\nRaines et al., 2022\n). The A+T content of all genes listed was also calculated (\nMcKnight et al., 2021\n) by comparing each species\u2019 (mouse, rat, and human) chromosome. The location of the gene and the locus of its telomere per each species was described by using the following conditions:\nIf the recombination frequency is less than or equal to 50 centimorgan (cM), then the genes are linked.\nIf the recombination frequency is greater than 50 cM, then the genes are not linked.\nFor the data stated above, 1 cM is equal to 1 Mb (\nHastbacka et al., 1992\n).\n\n2.4. Statistical analysis\nStatistical methods and plots applicable from Prism (version 9.3.0, GraphPad Software Inc.) were used, which enabled us to organize heatmap plots and bar graphs of the quantitative data obtained with the genome data viewer and GC content calculator. The non-parametric test was applied with the understanding that this approach allowed a more conservative conclusion than the parametric tests in which random assignment of treatments to samples and Gaussian distribution were expected. As a result, a Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis test were adopted for two group and three group comparisons, respectively. The difference between the data sets was considered significant at P<0.05; P values are noted in the figures and legends as *P<0.05, **P<0.01, and ***P<0.005."

    "Methods": "2.1. Experimental Design\nThis study included two dystonia mouse models. In both models,\nDyt1\n\u0394GAG knock-in was driven by a promoter specific to the cell type that was targeted. In model 1, we targeted neurons of the basal ganglia using the dopamine-2 (\nD2\n) receptor gene as a promoter (\nYokoi et al., 2020\n) \u2013 hereafter referred to as D2-KI. Although D2 receptors exist in other brain regions, in mice the DRD2 BA-Cre mediated recombination is highest in the striatum and low in other brain regions (\nGong et al., 2007\n). In model 2, we targeted cerebellar Purkinje cells using the Purkinje cell protein-2 (\nPcp2\n) gene as a promoter (\nLyu et al., 2020\n) \u2013 hereafter referred to as Pcp2-KI. Mice from both D2-KI and Pcp2-KI cohorts were generated on the C57BL/6 background strain. We used litter-mate control groups specific to each model to minimize the effects of background strain and cage-to-cage variability on comparisons of mutant versus control animals. The same animals went through each stage of the experiment. First, motor behavior assessments were performed on all animals and included accelerated rotarod and beam-walking tests. Mice were rested for one week in between these behavioral tests and for one week before neuroimaging. Next, four types of MRI scans were acquired for every animal: an anatomical scan, sensory-evoked fMRI, resting-state fMRI, and diffusion MRI. Experimenters performing behavioral testing and MRI acquisition were blind to which animals belonged to the experimental or control groups for each model. After all testing and data pre-processing were complete, genotyping was performed, and experimenters were unblinded to enable group-wise comparisons. Methods for each aspect of this study are described in detail in the following sections.\n\n2.2. Animals\nAll experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of Laboratory animals (NIH Publications No. 8023, revised 1978). The D2-KI cohort included 29 (19 male, 10 female) mice with heterozygous\nDyt1\n\u0394GAG conditional knock-in to neurons expressing the dopamine-2 receptor (D2Cre+/\u2212 Swap+/\u2212) with mean age 304 \u00b1 34 days, and 30 (20 male, 10 female) control mice (D2Cre+/\u2212) with mean age 294 \u00b1 36 days. The Pcp2-KI cohort included 37 (20 male, 17 female) mice with heterozygous\nDyt1\n\u0394GAG conditional knock-in to cerebellar Purkinje cells (Pcp2Cre+/\u2212 Swap+/\u2212) with mean age 203 \u00b1 12 d, and 31 (18 male, 13 female) control mice (Pcp2Cre+/\u2212) with mean age 200 \u00b1 11 d. Four Pcp2-KI mutant (Pcp2Cre+/\u2212 Swap+/\u2212) male mice were only included in motor behavior analysis: one was due to respiratory failure during neuroimaging, and three were due to data file corruption. All mice were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with food and water\nad libitum\n. All experiments were approved and monitored by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Florida and were conducted in ethical compliance with the USPHS Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\n2.3. Motor Behavior Tests and Analysis\nLocomotor function was evaluated for both the D2-KI cohort (n=59, 30 control mice, 29 D2-KI mutant) and the Pcp2-KI cohort (n=68, 31 control mice, 37 Pcp2-KI mutant) using the elevated beam-walking and accelerated rotarod (Ugo Basile) assessments, previously described by in\nWilkes et al. (2021)\nand\nYokoi et al. (2020)\n. The beam-walking test assesses the coordination and balance of mice as they traverse beams of decreasing width and differing shapes. Mice were trained to traverse a medium square beam (14 mm width) across 3 trials each day for 2 consecutive days (6 total training trials). On day 3, mice performed one trial traversing a medium square (14 mm width) and one trial traversing a medium round beam (17 mm diameter). Day 4 included one testing trial traversing a small square (7 mm width) and one trial traversing a small round beam (10 mm diameter). All beams were 100 cm in length and total beam slips were recorded for the middle 80 cm section. The number of hind paw slips on each side was counted by investigators blind to the genotypes.\nThe accelerated rotarod test assesses the ability of mice to maintain balance and coordination on an accelerating rotating rod. The apparatus started at an initial speed of 4 rpm, and then one mouse was put on a slot before the rod speed was gradually accelerated at a rate of 0.2 rpm/s. The latency to fall was measured with a cutoff time of 3 min at a final rate of 40 rpm. Each mouse was placed in the same slot on the apparatus to minimize variation. Mice were tested on 2 days, with 3 trials per day. Between trials on the same day, mice were given a 1-hour rest interval. Rotarod and beam-walking testing occurred within 15\u201330 days prior to imaging for all animals.\nData were then tested for normality using the SAS 9.4 statistical package. Both beam-walking and rotarod data were not normally distributed, and thus were analyzed using the non-parametric GENMOD procedure in SAS with a negative binomial distribution (\nDang et al., 2005\n;\nWilkes et al., 2021\n). Two-way interactions between genotype and age, weight, beam, side, trial, and sex were explored first, and if found to be significant, included in the final \u201creduced\u201d model. Although clinically DYT1 dystonia has no sex predominance (\nMeoni et al., 2020\n), the basal ganglia and cerebellum have sexual dimorphism (\nRaz et al., 2001\n;\nRijpkema et al., 2012\n). Because our models targeted these brain regions, we checked for any existing sex predominance by performing additional behavioral analysis separately for each sex in beam-walking and rotarod tasks. For beam-walking, our analysis only focused on aggregate performance on the small and medium beams on days 3 and 4 of testing, in order to account for learning effects that may have occurred during training on days 1 and 2. For rotarod analysis, mice remaining on the beam at 180 seconds were censored for survival analysis to determine a marginal hazard ratio. Effects were considered significant at\np\n< 0.05.\n\n2.4. MRI Preparation and Scan Parameters\nAnimal preparation for MRI was performed as previously described in (\nWilkes et al., 2021\n). Briefly, before scanning mice were induced under general anesthesia via isoflurane delivered through a Surgivet vaporizer (Dublin, OH) and then maintained at 1\u20131.5% isoflurane for the duration of imaging. Research suggests that sensory neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord that respond to noxious stimuli have relatively spared firing rates under isoflurane anesthesia (\nKim et al., 2007\n). The experimental setup for mouse imaging is depicted in\nFig. 1\n. Respiration was monitored using a respiration pad (SA Instruments, Stony Brook, NY) placed beneath the abdomen. Core body temperature was maintained using an in-house recirculating waterbed heating system and monitored via a thermal rectal probe (SA Instruments, Stony Brook, NY). A 256 mm\n2\nMR compatible advanced thermal stimulator (ATS) thermode (PATHWAY System, Medoc Advanced Medical Systems, Ramat Yishay, Israel) was affixed to the right plantar hind paw, which delivered heat stimulation during imaging.\nFigure 1. Imaging setup.\nOpen in a new tab\nImaging was performed on an 11.1 Tesla MRI scanner with a Magnex Scientific 40 cm horizontal magnet (Bruker BioSpin, Billerica, MA). For imaging, animals were placed on a custom-designed mouse platform, which included anesthesia provided through a head stabilizer with a surface transmit/receive radiofrequency head coil. Core body temperature was maintained during imaging with a heated waterbed tube placed underneath the animal. A Medoc PATHWAY heating thermode was placed on the right hindlimb of the animal and controlled by an associated computer setup.\nMRI data were acquired on an 11.1 Tesla Magnex Scientific 40 cm horizontal magnet (Agilent, Inc. Palo Alto, CA, USA) with RRI BFG-240/120-S6: bore size 120mm, Gmax = 1000 mT/m @325A with 200 \u03bcs rise time. B\n1\nexcitation and signal detection were achieved using an in-house 2.5 \u00d7 3.5 cm quadrature surface transmit/receive mouse head coil tuned to 470.7 MHz (\n1\nH resonance) (AMRIS, University of Florida). Scan sequences were prepared and controlled using ParaVision, Version 6.0.1 (Bruker BioSpin, Billerica, MA). Four types of MRI scans were acquired for every animal: an anatomical scan, sensory-evoked fMRI, resting-state fMRI, and diffusion MRI.\nAnatomical T2-weighted images were acquired for spatial normalization using a turbo RARE sequence with the following parameters: TR = 5500 ms; TE = 30 ms; excitation angle = 90\u00b0; refocusing angle = 180\u00b0; dummy scans = 1; averages = 7; slices = 13; orientation = coronal; thickness = 0.9 mm; gap = 0 mm; FOV = 15 \u00d7 15 mm; data matrix = 256 \u00d7 256 in-plane.\nSensory-evoked and resting state fMRI scans were acquired using a 2-shot EPI sequence with the following parameters: TR = 2000 ms; TE = 15 ms; repetitions = 360 (sensory-evoked fMRI) or 180 (resting state fMRI); flip angle = 90\u00b0; dummy scans = 2; slices = 13; coronal orientation; thickness = 0.9 mm; gap = 0 mm; FOV = 15 \u00d7 15 mm; data acquisition matrix = 64 \u00d7 64 in-plane.\nDiffusion MRI scans were acquired using an EPI sequence with the following parameters: TR = 4000 ms; TE = 19 ms; averages = 4; flip angle = 90\u00b0; slices = 17; orientation = coronal; thickness = 0.7 mm; gap = 0 mm; FOV = 15 \u00d7 11 mm; data matrix = 128 \u00d7 96 in-plane. The following diffusion parameters were used: one non-diffusion weighted b0 images; b-value = 2000 s/mm\n2\n; directions = 46.\n\n2.5. Sensory-evoked fMRI Thermal Stimulation\nAcquisition of sensory-evoked fMRI involved heat-induced stimulation of the right plantar hind paw. The PATHWAY System was calibrated such that thermal stimulation was applied in a block paradigm alternating between 60 s at the stimulation temperature (42 \u00b0C) and 60 s at the baseline temperature (30 \u00b0C), beginning and ending with a 30 s baseline block. The change in temperature between blocks was achieved within 300 ms via a cooling rate of 40 \u00b0C/s and a heating rate of 70 \u00b0C/s.\n\n2.6. fMRI Preprocessing\nData processing for sensory-evoked and resting-state fMRI scans were performed similar to\nChu et al. (2020)\n, using custom-designed UNIX shell scripts with commands from Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI;\nCox, 1996\n) and Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs;\nAvants et al., 2010\n). The functional MRI processing pipeline was automated and could, therefore, be applied equally and without bias to all scans. We acquired 2 duplicate scans from each type of fMRI paradigm (sensory-evoked and resting state). For sensory-evoked fMRI, the 2 duplicate scans were processed identically and used as a repeated measure within subjects. For resting-state fMRI, we concatenated the data from the 2 duplicate scans, such that resting-state data were analyzed as a single time-series. Data were only excluded from sensory-evoked and resting-state fMRI analysis due to excessive motion that prevented deconvolution of the hemodynamic response function.\nThe first 5 TRs were removed from each fMRI scan to account for signal equilibration. Outliers within each voxel\u2019s time series were identified using 3dToutcount in AFNI, and volumes with more than 5% of the total voxels determined to be outliers were flagged for exclusion during regression. Scan data were then de-spiked, slice-time corrected, corrected for motion and distortion via alignment to the first volume (\n3dvolreg,\nAFNI), spatially smoothed with a 0.3mm full width half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel, and scaled to have a range of (0,200) and mean of 100. For resting-state fMRI data, we also applied bandpass filtering of the time series between 0.01 to 0.1 Hz. The matrix derived from motion-correction was used to compute a demeaned and derivatives of motion parameters for use as regressors. Volumes in which the Euclidian Norm of the derivative values exceeded 0.5 were flagged for exclusion during regression. Brain masks were created on high-resolution anatomical scans and then registered to the fMRI scan from the same animal in order to remove signal from voxels outside the brain. In order to spatially normalize data, fMRI images from each mouse were registered to the T2-weighted anatomical scan from the same animal, and then to a high-resolution T2-weighted mouse template brain, generated from anatomical scans of 160 mice (\nChu et al., 2020\n). We evaluated 12 regions of interest (ROIs) from key areas of the sensorimotor network, which were selected\na priori\nbased on their relevance to the pathophysiology of dystonia (\nDeSimone et al., 2016\n,\n2017\n;\nMacIver et al., 2022\n;\nWilkes et al., 2021\n). Some regions that are pertinent to dystonia were not included for ROI analysis, due to their small size and lack of nearby landmarks for reliable segmentation (\ne.g.\n, pedunculopontine nucleus). These ROIs are depicted on the mouse anatomical template brain in\nFig 2B\n.\nFigure 2. Regions of Interest.\nOpen in a new tab\nThe top panel (A) shows diffusion MRI regions of interest overlaid on top of the fractional anisotropy template image: cerebellum (CER; orange), vermis (VER; yellow), posterior medulla (pMED; light green), anterior medulla (aMED; dark green), pons (PON; pink), midbrain (MID; turquoise), substantia nigra (SN; magenta), thalamus (THA; dark blue), globus pallidus (GP; orange), somatosensory cortex (SS; purple), primary motor cortex (M1; light blue), and striatum (STR; red).\n\n2.7. Sensory-evoked fMRI Analysis\nWe determined the sensory-evoked hemodynamic response time series using a response function convolved with 20 \u201ctent\u201d or piecewise linear B-spline basis functions which capture the percent signal change for BOLD across time (\nSaad et al., 2006\n), spanning 80 s from the onset of each stimulation block. Preprocessed data were regressed to these simulated tent response functions, with six motion parameters calculated during motion correction also accounted for by including them as regressors of no interest. Volumes flagged with excessive motion by 3dToutcount were censored in this step and excluded from the regression analysis. The \u03b2-coefficients of the regressed time series (one for each tent) and the corresponding t-statistics, were the dependent variables at this level of analysis. At this stage of the analysis, 2 control mice from the D2-KI cohort (1 male and 1 female) were excluded due to excessive motion that prevented deconvolution of the hemodynamic response function.\nThe sensory-evoked fMRI data were then transformed to the mouse T2 template (as described in\nsection 2.6\n). We extracted values of the 20 \u03b2-coefficients representing the hemodynamic response time series from 0\u201380 seconds after hind paw thermal stimulation, from each of the 12 ROIs. Although hind paw stimulation was performed unilaterally, we evaluated the brain\u2019s response to the stimulus bilaterally because unilateral heat stimulation has been shown to result in bilateral blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response in mice (\nBosshard et al., 2015\n;\nChu et al., 2020\n).\nFor statistical analysis of sensory-evoked fMRI data, we performed repeated measures analysis of covariance for each ROI using SPSS Statistics 27 (IBM; Armonk, New York). Between-subjects factors were genotype and sex, duplicate scans (scan 1 and 2) and the sensory-evoked BOLD time-series were considered as within-subjects factors, and age as a covariate. Our primary interest was the sustained portion of the sensory-evoked signal (20\u201360s after stimulus onset), and thus the BOLD time-series included for statistical analysis were the corresponding 10 tent functions reflecting the signal change in the time period 20\u201360s after stimulus onset.\n\n2.8. Resting-state fMRI Analysis\nConcatenated and preprocessed resting-state fMRI data were subjected to general linear regression. As with sensory-evoked fMRI scans, volumes flagged with excessive motion by 3dToutcount were censored and excluded from the regression analysis. At this stage of the resting-state fMRI analysis, 1 female control mouse from the D2-KI cohort was excluded due to excessive motion. We then applied additional regressors for the mean signal from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the first-order derivatives of the motion parameters calculated during motion correction as this has been suggested to improve resting-state functional connectivity analysis (\nSatterthwaite et al., 2013\n). We then performed seed-to-voxel resting-state functional connectivity analysis. We extracted the mean signal of all voxels within a particular ROI for each time point in the concatenated time-series, which was then correlated with the time-series of each voxel throughout the brain in order to generate a whole brain map of functional connectivity. This was done for each of the 12 ROIs.\nFor resting-state fMRI data, we analyzed functional connectivity using seed-to-voxel approach. We did not observe significant effects of sex on resting-state functional connectivity and thus applied t-tests at each voxel to identify between-group effects for each cohort. For each of the 12 ROIs, between-group statistics (mutant vs. control) were performed at every voxel in the brain using AFNI. In order to control for false-positives across voxels, a one-sample t-test was performed using AFNI\u2019s\nClustsim\nbootstrapping option to advise the cluster-extent threshold.\nClustsim\nadvises a minimum number of significant (uncorrected) voxels for a cluster to be considered significant while controlling for false-positives at our desired alpha of 0.05 (\nCox et al., 2017\n) and is functionally similar to other approaches for controlling for multiple comparisons.\nClustsim\ncalculations were performed separately for the D2-KI and Pcp2-KI cohorts using the voxel-level threshold of\np\n< 0.01 and nearest neighbor (nn3) clusterization. In accordance with the advised cluster threshold, between-group effects were considered significant (p\ncorrected\n< 0.05 ) at a minimum cluster size of 12 voxels (0.59 mm\n3\n) for the D2-KI cohort, and also coincidentally a minimum cluster size of 12 voxels (0.59 mm\n3\n) in the Pcp2-KI cohort.\n\n2.9. Diffusion MRI Processing and Analysis\nData processing for diffusion MRI was performed similar to\nChu et al. (2020)\n, using custom-designed UNIX shell scripts with commands from AFNI (\nCox, 1996\n), FMRIB Software Library (FSL;\nJenkinson et al., 2012\n) and ANTs (\nAvants et al., 2010\n). The diffusion MRI processing pipeline was automated and could, therefore, be applied equally and without bias to all scans. Data were corrected for motion and eddy currents using affine transform with FSL\u2019s eddy correct function. Diffusion MRI data for three control mice from the D2-KI cohort and two mutant mice from the Pcp2-KI cohort were discarded due to high motion-related distortions. The resultant transformation matrix was used to rotate diffusion-weighted directions (\ni.e\n., b-vectors) accordingly, in order to properly estimate the diffusion tensor and diffusion parameters after eddy correction. Estimation of diffusion parameters was calculated using a two-compartment model to account for partial volume effects of extracellular free-water. We utilized publicly available workflow for single shell free water elimination and estimation of diffusion parameters (\nhttps://github.com/sameerd/DiffusionTensorImaging\n), implemented through MATLAB and the DIPY imaging library in Python 3.6 (\nGaryfallidis et al., 2014\n). The resultant maps of free-water (FW) and free-water corrected FA (FA\nT\n) were variables of interest for this analysis.\nIn order to spatially normalize data, FA\nT\nimages from each mouse were nonlinearly registered to a FA\nT\nmouse template brain, generated from FA\nT\nmaps of 160 mice (\nChu et al., 2020\n). Because diffusion scans had a high in-plane resolution (117 \u00d7 115 \u03bcm) with a relatively large slice thickness (700 \u03bcm), we performed nonlinear registration to the template in a slice-by-slice fashion in order to prevent possible warping between slices. The transformation matrices derived from registration of the FA\nT\nscans to the template were then applied to the FW image from the same animal.\nFor statistical analysis of diffusion MRI data, we performed multivariate analyses of covariance using SPSS Statistics 27 (IBM; Armonk, New York). Between-subjects factors were genotype and sex, with age as a covariate. We analyzed between group differences in FW and FA\nT\nfor the same 12 ROIs that were utilized in fMRI analyses, transformed into diffusion MRI space (\nFig 2A\n). Group effects were considered significant at\np\n< 0.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animal preparation\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport. C57BL/6J male mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory at 7 weeks old. Male mice ages 8\u201312 weeks, weighing approximately 20\u201332 g. Mice were held in standard LSU health veterinary conditions with a controlled climate and a 12-h light to dark cycle. Upon completion of rmTBI experimentation, mice were placed into an induction chamber at (5% isoflurane and 900 cc of O\n2\n) for sacrifice. Mice were randomly placed into the following experimental groups: SHAM, SHAM + PRMT7-AAV, 3 days post-rmTBI, 3 days post-rmTBI + PRMT7-AAV, 7 days post-rmTBI, and 7 days post-rmTBI + PRMT7-AAV to assess molecular changes\nin vivo\n.\n\n2.2. Experimental paradigm\nThe CHIMERA was utilized for the experimental model of rmTBI. Age-matched male mice (8\u201312 weeks) were anesthetized using 5% isoflurane and 900 cc of O\n2\nfor 2 min followed by placement onto the CHIMERA apparatus. Mice were maintained using a nose cone and a heat lamp was placed over each mouse to prevent hypothermia-induced neuroprotection (\nBusto et al., 1989\n;\nDietrich and Bramlett, 2010\n). After equal duration of anesthesia (~ 4\u20135 min), the mice were either removed immediately (SHAM) or subjected to a TBI hit (0.7 J). SHAM mice were exposed to anesthesia and O\n2\nonly (no hit) or rmTBI, once daily for 3 days. Overexpression of PRMT7-AAV in C57BL/6J mice was achieved via injection of AAV/PHP.eB-hSYN1-GFP.mPRMT7-WPRE 3\u20134 weeks prior to rmTBI to enable maximum overexpression prior to rmTBI. PRMT7-AAV overexpressed mice were then exposed to anesthesia (SHAM) or rmTBI once daily for 3 days.\n\n2.3. In vivo overexpression of neuronal PRMT7 via adeno-associated virus\nThe viral vector AAV/PHP.eB-hSYN1-GFP.mPRMT7-WPRE was purchased from Vector BioLabs (lot number: 220207#39; serotype AAV/PHP.eB) and diluted in Lactated Ringer\u2019s solution upon injection. Overexpression virus was injected intravenously at 1 \u00d7 10\n11\nvectors/genome into each mouse (\nCouto et al., 2021\n). Four weeks later, overexpression of PRMT7-AAV was validated via qRT-PCR and ProteinSimple\n\u00ae\nanalyses in mouse hippocampus and cortex tissue samples. In addition, overexpression was validated via histological sections visualized by confocal microcopy of GFP-tagged PRMT7-AAV in mouse brain sections.\n\n2.4. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)\nRNA was extracted using the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit (Cat. No. 74104, QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). RNA samples were assessed using the NanoDrop (Model: NanoDrop One; serial number: AZY1706087; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng of extracted mRNA with SuperScript\n\u2122\nIII Reverse Transcriptase (Cat. No. 18080051, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). qPCR was performed in a CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System using iQ\n\u2122\nSYBR\n\u00ae\nGreen Supermix (Cat. No. 1708886, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The PCR reaction was as follows: 0.4 \u03bcl of cDNA, 10 \u03bcl of iQ\n\u2122\nSYBR\n\u00ae\nGreen Supermix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 200 nM of each primer, and nuclease free water. The cycling conditions for the qPCR amplification were as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 3 mins, 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s, for 40 cycles. Target genes were normalized with the house-keeping gene GAPDH (forward 5\u2019-CATCACTGCCACCCAGAAGACTG-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2019-ATGCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAG-3\u2032) (\nNarayan and Kumar, 2012\n). The mouse primer sequence for PRMT7 gene was obtained from Primer Bank (ID 21703807c1) database and synthesized by MilliporeSigma (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA) (forward 5\u2019-TTGCCAGGTCATCCTATGCC-\u2019 and reverse 5\u2019-GCCAATGTCAAGAACCAAGGC \u22123\u2032).\n\n2.5. Capillary-based immunoassay via ProteinSimple\n\u00ae\nCapillary electrophoresis immunoassay (Simple Western analyses) was performed using the Wes/Jess\n\u2122\n, according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (ProteinSimple\n\u00ae\n, Bio-techne, Minneapolis, MN). Proteins were extracted from tissue lysates using T-PER\n\u00ae\nTissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Cat. No. 78510, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Halt\n\u2122\nProtease Inhibitor Cocktail (Cat. No. 87785, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Tissue lysates were diluted in sample buffer (Protein Simple\n\u00ae\n) (1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl) and added to a fluorescent marker with dithiothreitol. Samples were denatured at 95 \u00b0C for 5 mins. Capillary cartridges with a target protein size of 12\u2013230 kDa were used for analysis. Antibodies were diluted in the manufacturer provided antibody diluent (Protein Simple, Bio-techne, Minneapolis, MN) as follows: PRMT7 (1:100; D1K6R, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), MMA (1:50; 8015S, Cell Signaling), DRP1 (1:10,000; NB110\u201355288, Novus Biologics), OPA1 (1:5000; NBP1\u201371656 (1E8\u20131D9) Novus Biologicals), ZO-1 (1:100; ab96587, Abcam), Occludin (1:100; 13409\u20131-AP, ProteinTech), GFAP (1:500; 3670S, Cell Signaling Technology), iba1 (1:50; 43733, Genetex). Antibody targets were detected with an HRP-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse. Protein levels were evaluated by the area under the curve obtained via the Compass for SW software (version 4.0.0, Protein Simple\n\u00ae\n, Bio-techne, Minneapolis, MN). Relative protein expression was calculated by protein peak intensity (area under the curve) divided by the Total Protein loaded as per the manufacturer. Representative computer-generated pseudo-blots are presented throughout the figures where applicable (Protein Simple\n\u00ae\n, Bio-techne, Minneapolis, MN).\n\n2.6. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy\nC57BL/6J mice from both injured (rmTBI) and uninjured cohorts (SHAM) were assessed using two-photon laser scanning microscopy. SHAM and rmTBI mice were anesthetized at 3% isoflurane and maintained at 1% for image acquisition. A thin longitudinal incision was made across the scalp in the midline stretching from the neck to the front of the head. A thin-skull preparation was done to ensure clear evaluation of the cortical vessels during image acquisition. The thin-skull procedure produced a circular cranial window ~2 mm from the bregma and 2 mm from the centerline of the skull. The surgically prepared mice were then visualized via the Zeiss LSM 510 multi-photon microscope. Mice were monitored via rectal probe and maintained at 37 \u00b0C via heating pad. Mice were injected with the following dyes via tail vein injection: fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC) (0.2 mg/kg Cat. no. FD2000S, MilliporeSigma) to visualize red blood cells and micro-vessels and acridine orange (7 mg/kg Cat. no. 318337, MilliporeSigma) to visualize leukocytes (\nCahoon et al., 2014\n), (\nByvaltsev et al., 2019\n), (\nLin et al., 2010\n), (\nR. H. Lee et al., 2017\n). For BBB leakage studies, 40 kDa FITC-dextran (\nNyul-Toth et al., 2021\n) was injected into the tail vein to measure fluorescent intensity in the cerebral vessel and the neighboring perivascular space.\nOnly cortical blood vessels with a diameter of ~10\u201320 \u03bcm were analyzed with a 20 X objective. A total of ~3\u20134 linescans were acquired for each mouse. The slope was calculated for each linescan using ImageJ software and the average red blood cell velocity (labelled with FITC, a surrogate measurement for CBF) (\nLin et al., 2010\n) or leukocyte (labelled with acridine orange) speed was measured (\nLagrange et al., 2018\n). Whisker-barrel stimulation was produced by a motorized rotating device with a \u201cflag-like\u201d shape attached to the motor that was placed perpendicular to the mouse vibrissae rotating at 4 Hz for 30 s (\nRodgers et al., 2006\n). Whisker-barrel stimulation was implemented on SHAM, SHAM + PRMT7-AAV, 3 days after rmTBI, and 3 days after rmTBI + PRMT7-AAV, while implementing two-photon microscopy imaging of cortical microvessels in real-time.\n\n2.7. Seahorse XFe24 analyzer (mitochondrial bioenergetics)\nMitochondrial bioenergetics (oxygen consumption rate, OCR) of CA1 hippocampal tissue slices were analyzed via Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). SHAM and rmTBI mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane to enable removal of the brain tissue (cortex and hippocampus) at the end-point (3 days post-rmTBI). Murine brains were then placed into artificial cerebral spinal fluid buffer (aCSF). aCSF mixture consisted of the following: [120 mM NaCl (Cat. No. S7653), 3.5 mM KCl (Cat. No. P9333), 1.3 mM CaCl\n2\n(Cat. No. C1016), 1 mM MgCl\n2\nhexahydrate (Cat. No. M9272), 0.4 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n(Cat. No. P5655), 5 mM HEPES (Cat. No. H7006), 10 mM glucose (Cat. No. G7528), and 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, at a 7.4 pH at 4 \u00b0C (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA)]. Mouse brains were sliced into 200 \u03bcm corona sections with Leica VT1000E vibratome while submerged in aCSF at 4 \u00b0C, transferred to aCSF at 20 \u00b0C. A 1-mm biopsy punch (Sklar Instruments; 96\u20130912) of the CA1 region of the hippocampus was placed independently into the wells of the Seahorse XFe24 Islet Capture Microplate (Cat. No. 103518\u2013100; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) containing 700 \u03bcl of aCSF. Once plated into wells, tissue slices were incubated in a step-wise method within the first 30 min to reach room temperature followed by 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, as suggested by the standard Agilent Technologies protocol. OCR measurements are made temporally at both basal levels and following each drug administration. OCR measurements were performed at the following time-points: basal conditions with aCSF media (to maintain tissue viability), 20 \u03bcg/ml oligomycin (ATP-synthase inhibitor, Cat. No. O4876), 10 \u03bcM carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP, a mitochondrial uncoupler, Cat. No. C2920), and 20 \u03bcM antimycin A (a complex III inhibitor, Cat No. A8674 MilliporeSigma (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA). Upon completion, the following OCR measurements are generated: ATP production, ATP-linked respiration, maximal respiration, and reserve capacity. Mitochondrial reserve capacity was calculated by the average of tissue sections that displayed an OCR of 40\u2013210 pmol/min (\nCouto et al., 2021\n).\n\n2.8. Statistical analyses\nA\np\nvalue of \u2264 0.05 level of probability was considered significant. Results were expressed as means \u00b1 S.E.M. Statistical analysis were evaluated by Student\u2019s\nt\n-test, two-way or one-way ANOVA (Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test) as appropriate with Graph-pad Prism v.8.0.2 (San Diego, CA)."

    "Methods": "Three-dimensional BMPSs have been developed through different protocols. Most protocols start with iPSCs or ESC that are cultured in suspension into embryonic bodies (small spherical cell aggregates that mimic features of the developing embryo) which are later induced with specific neural induction media (usually containing factors that inhibit BMP/TGF-beta signaling pathways) to form neural stem cells that can later generate glial and neuronal populations. In addition, modulation of Wnt or Shh pathways may help embryonic bodies to be modeled into distinct cortical subregions with neural stem cells showing specific regional identities like dorsal or ventral telencephalic identities (Fan et al., 2022,Hopkins, Traverse and Barr., 2021).\n\nThe type of cells used for the generation of BMPS and their quality are important factors when performing neurological infection studies. iPSCs can be derived from adult tissues such as skin fibroblasts or epithelial cells or from blood monocytes which can be from healthy donors or patients with specific conditions of interest. ESC are derived from the inner cell mass of early preimplantation embryonic tissue, neural progenitor cells can be obtained from cerebral fetal tissue (Dos Reis et al., 2020). Quality control approaches need to be implemented to confirm stem cell pluripotency, genetics, and a normal karyotype (Pamies, D. et al., 2022). Particular attention should be paid to the vectors used in line generation to avoid the use of integrating vectors that can alter the host genome.\n\nBeyond the analysis of specific neurotropism, BMPS with diverse glial populations allow the study of glial-neuronal interactions during CNS infection. Astrocytes play key roles in the metabolic support of neurons, synaptic and neurotransmitter homeostasis as well as interactions with other glial cells such as oligodendrocytes and limiting the spread of neurotropic pathogens, functions that can be disrupted in infections like HIV and Toxoplasma gondii infection(Drogemuller et al., 2008,Pandey and Seth., 2019). Astroglia and microglia mediate inflammatory responses to infection with direct consequences for neurons. For example, microglia serve as a reservoir for CNS infection as seen in HIV and activated microglia contribute to loss of inhibitory synapses in Toxoplasma gondii infection(Carrillo et al., 2020). Similarly, astrocyte dysfunction can lead to altered glutamate metabolism and neuronal disturbances contributing to HIV neuropathogenesis (dos Reis, Sant and Ayyavoo., 2022,Pandey and Seth., 2019). In Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) infection, microglia was found to be the source of neurotoxic mediators that contributed to neuronal death(Chen et al., 2010). A similar observation had been found in West Nile Virus (WNV) infection(Van Marle et al., 2007). Some of these glial-neuronal interactions have been studied for specific infections in BMPS such as in flavivirus infection models (Abreu et al., 2018,Dos Reis et al., 2020). Oligodendrocytes contribute to myelination and axonal protection which is relevant in some infections such as JCV which was studied in a brain spheroid model (Barreras et al., 2022).\n\nMost BMPS protocols are comprised of the same basic steps: Induction, differentiation, and maturation. In induction, embryonic bodies are produced from the original cell line, cultured in suspension, and directed towards a neuroectoderm lineage to be cultured in a differentiation medium to generate neuronal and glial populations which are cultured until reaching the desired mature phenotypes. Most of these protocols use a scaffold or basement membrane such as Matrigel to support morphogenesis and nutrient absorption during differentiation. Matrigel can enhance the formation of neural rosettes within the 3D structure (Fan et al., 2022,Lancaster et al., 2013,Tanaka et al., 2020). The production and in-vitro development periods of various protocols vary in length from 4 weeks to 2 months, although most organoids can be cultured beyond that period. The longer the development time the closer the phenotype is to the mature CNS environment, although problems of increasing size and nutrient depletion in the center of the organoids may deteriorate the quality of the system (Gordon et al., 2021,Lancaster et al., 2013). Depending on the protocol used to achieve maturation, the final BMPS can be considered spheroids, unguided, or guided/region-specific organoids (Figure 1)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. GnRH-Cre females and males (Jackson Labs #021207) on the C57BL/6J background were housed in a 14:10 h light:dark cycle (lights off at 1900 h) with food and water available\nad libitum\n. The animals used in this study were progeny not used in breeding pairs for ongoing projects that require Cre expression in GnRH neurons (\nIngram et al., 2022\n;\nLi et al., 2018\n;\nLi and Christian-Hinman, 2022\n). After weaning, all animals were group-housed with two to five mice per cage. Estrous cycle monitoring was performed from 0900 to 1100h as previously described starting at postnatal day (P) 42 (\nPantier et al., 2019\n). Daily cycle stage monitoring was done for at least 2 weeks prior to intrahippocampal injection to ensure that all animals entered in the study had normal estrous cycles. From 14-17 days prior to initial tail blood sampling, the cycle stages in each mouse were monitored again to determine if post-injection estrous cycle disruption had occurred. The cycle length was calculated as the time it took on average to progress from one day of estrus through each stage to the next day of estrus (\nLi et al., 2018\n,\n2017\n). IHKA mice that had cycle lengths of seven days or more were categorized as \u201cIHKA-long\u201d, while those that maintained a normal cycle length (4-6 days) were categorized \u201cIHKA-regular\u201d (\nLi et al., 2018\n,\n2017\n). All control animals maintained regular estrous cycle lengths following intrahippocampal saline injection.\n\nIntrahippocampal kainic acid injection and EEG electrode implantation\nAll surgical procedures were conducted under isoflurane inhalation anesthesia. At P56 and older, mice underwent unilateral injection of kainic acid (Tocris Bioscience; 50 nl, 20 mM prepared in 0.9% sterile saline) into the right dorsal hippocampal region to elicit chronic recurrent seizure development (from Bregma: 2.0 mm posterior, 1.5 mm lateral, 1.4 mm ventral to the cortical surface). All injections in females were performed on diestrus. Each mouse was randomly assigned to IHKA or saline injection. Injections were performed by lab personnel not involved in the data collection or analysis process. Controls were injected with the same volume of saline at the same location. To record the incidence of seizures, 14 days after injection the mice were implanted with twisted bipolar EEG electrodes (P1 Technologies) into the ipsilateral hippocampus (\nArmstrong et al., 2013\n;\nCutia et al., 2022\n;\nLi et al., 2020\n;\nLi and Christian-Hinman, 2022\n). Implantation was slightly dorsal and lateral to the injection location (from Bregma: 1.75 mm lateral, 1.25 mm ventral). Five anchor micro-screws (J.I. Morris Co.) were then inserted into and distributed across the frontal, parietal, and occipital skull plates. The electrode and screws were stabilized to the skull surface with dental cement (Teets \u201cCold Cure\u201d Dental Cement). Each mouse was a single experimental unit and was singly housed after EEG instrumentation to avoid damage to the implant.\n\nEEG recording and analysis\n7 days after EEG electrode implantation, the mice were singly housed and tethered to an electrical commutator (P1 Technologies). The mice were habituated to tethering for five weeks prior to experimentation to avoid tethering-induced disruption to the estrous cycle (\nLi et al., 2020\n). 24 hours prior to initial tail blood sampling, the commutator was connected to a Brownlee 440 amplifier (NeuroPhase) with the gain set at 1K to collect EEG signals recorded as the local field potential differential between the two electrodes (\nArmstrong et al., 2013\n). These signals were sampled at 2 kHz and digitized to a computer with recorder software written in MATLAB (\nArmstrong et al., 2013\n). At 2 months post-injection, the mice were recorded for 9-24 hours prior to tail blood sampling (\nLi and Christian-Hinman, 2022\n) and through the 3-hour sampling period. Recordings were analyzed with an automated electrographic seizure analyzer (\nZeidler et al., 2018\n), with the minimal seizure duration set at five seconds and interictal interval set at six seconds. Experimenters were blinded to the injection group of the animal during analysis.\n\nTail blood sampling and trunk blood collection\nBeginning 14 days prior to initial tail blood sampling, mice underwent daily tail touch habituation in which the tail was stroked six times every five minutes for 15 minutes (\nMcCosh et al., 2018\n). This habituation is necessary to reduce stress, which can affect LH release (\nYang et al., 2018\n). Mice were sampled twice at approximately 2 months after intrahippocampal injection: once on a day in diestrus and once on a day in estrus. The sampling order of mice on diestrus or estrus was counterbalanced to ensure equal numbers of animals underwent first sampling at each cycle stage. On the day of sampling, <1 mm of the tail tip was clipped off and 6 \u03bcl of blood was pipetted off the tail using pipette tips prewashed in EDTA (\nSteyn et al., 2013\n). Blood samples were collected every five minutes for three hours, with every other sample collected (i.e., samples collected every 10 minutes) subjected to final LH assays. Samples were collected with minimal restraint of the mouse between 0800 h and 1200 h. The blood samples were diluted in 54 \u03bcl of buffer (prepared as 0.5 g BSA and 125 \u03bcl Tween 20 in 250 mL of 1X PBS) and stored on ice. Mice were returned to their home cage between sample collections. At the end of the 3-hour period of LH sampling, a 150 ng/kg bolus intraperitoneal (IP) injection of GnRH (Bachem 4033013; LHRH acetate salt prepared in 0.9% sterile saline) was administered (\u201cGnRH challenge\u201d) (\nCzieselsky et al., 2016\n;\nHan et al., 2015\n;\nSilveira et al., 2017\n). 15 minutes after this injection, a final tail blood collection was made. Once all samples for a given session were collected, mice were allowed to recover for at least 7 days before further sampling or experimentation. Blood samples were stored at \u221220\u00b0C before being assayed. Experimenters were blinded to the injection group of each animal during sampling.\nTrunk blood, collected at the time of euthanasia via decapitation at least one week after the last blood sampling period, was stored at 4\u00b0C overnight, and following centrifugation serum was collected for FSH assays. Sample collection from females was conducted on a day of estrus or diestrus, assigned randomly to each mouse.\n\nMeasurement of blood LH and FSH levels\nLH and FSH concentrations were measured by the University of Virginia Ligand Assay and Analysis Core using ultrasensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for mouse LH in whole blood (\nSteyn et al., 2013\n) and for mouse FSH in serum (\nOngaro et al., 2021\n). The reportable range for the LH assays was 0.16 - 40.0 ng/ml. All % CV values for LH assays were < 10. The reportable range for the FSH assay was 0.16 - 80.0 ng/ml. The % CV value for the FSH assay was 3.4.\n\nPituitary qPCR\nPituitaries were removed at the time of euthanasia and stored in RNAlater (Invitrogen) at \u221220\u00b0C. RNAqueous-Micro kits (Invitrogen) were used to isolate pituitary RNA. The ProtoScript First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (New England Biolabs) was then used to reverse transcribe the total RNA (\nCutia et al., 2022\n;\nNantie et al., 2014\n). Oligonucleotide primers for the GnRH receptor (\nGnrhr\n) (Life Technologies) gene were used to amplify gene-specific transcripts by quantitative PCR (qPCR). mRNA expression levels of Peptidylprolyl isomerase A (\nPpia\n), a common reference gene used as an internal control, were used to normalize the expression levels of the gene of interest. The data were analyzed using the standard comparative cycle threshold value method (2\n\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct\n).\n\nEvaluation of LH pulse parameters\nLH peaks and pulse dynamics were quantified in a blinded manner. LH concentration values that showed at least a 20% increase from prior points and were followed by an immediate decrease of at least 10% were characterized as pulse peaks as previously described (\nEsparza et al., 2020\n;\nYang et al., 2018\n). All other parameters (amplitude, basal levels, and mean release) were calculated for each mouse using established standards (\nEsparza et al., 2020\n;\nYang et al., 2018\n). Specifically, LH pulse amplitude was calculated as the difference between the concentration of an LH peak and the trough (lowest value) immediately preceding the peak. Basal LH was defined as the average of all LH samples not identified as peak points of release, and mean LH was defined as the average LH concentration across all samples. Interpulse interval was defined as the time between two successive peaks.\n\nStatistics\nBasal, mean, and pulse amplitude measures of LH, post-GnRH challenge differences, and FSH levels were compared between IHKA-long, IHKA-regular, and saline-injected control mice on both diestrus and estrus using one-way ANOVAs. Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\ntests were used for further pairwise comparisons. Interpulse interval values were compared between saline/IHKA females on diestrus and estrus using Kruskal-Wallis tests. All comparisons of LH pulse parameters, post-GnRH challenge differences, and FSH levels in males were conducted using two-sample t-tests. Comparisons of percent change between diestrus and estrus for LH pulse parameters and post-GnRH challenge differences were conducted using Kruskal-Wallis tests. Diestrus-to-estrus repeated measures comparisons of LH parameters and post-GnRH challenge differences within each group of females were made using paired t-tests. Comparisons between saline/IHKA males and diestrous females for LH pulse parameters, post-GnRH challenge differences, and FSH levels were made using two-way ANOVAs and Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\ntests. Comparison of\nGnrhr\nmRNA expression between saline and IHKA females was made using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Normality was evaluated with Shapiro-Wilks tests and homogeneity of variance was assessed with Levene\u2019s tests. Pearson\u2019s correlations were used to compare percent time spent in seizures and LH pulse parameters. All statistical analyses were conducted using R in RStudio. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05."

On differentiation day \u223c0, hiPSCs were cultured with mitomycin-C-treated SNL murine fibroblast feeder cells on 0.1% gelatin-coated culture dishes. hiPSCs were cultured using human ES medium, which contained KnockOut\u2122 serum replacement (final 20%, KSR, Gibco, Japan), 200\u00a0mM\nl\n-glutamine (final 1%, Gibco), nonessential amino acids (final 0.8%, NEAA, Nacalai, Japan), 2-mercaptoethanol (final 0.1\u00a0mM, Sigma, USA), fibroblast growth factor 2 (final 4\u00a0ng/mL, FGF2, PeproTech, Japan), and penicillin\u2013streptomycin at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 3% CO\n2\n. On day 0 of astrocyte differentiation, iPSCs were removed from feeder cells with a dissociation solution (0.25% trypsin, 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL collagenase IV (Invitrogen, USA), 1\u00a0mM CaCl\n2\n, and 20% KSR) and cultured in FGF2-free human ES medium with 10\u00a0\u03bcM Y-27632 (Nacalai, Japan) to form embryoid bodies (EBs) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 3% CO\n2\n. On days 1\u20133 of differentiation, to enhance the differentiation to the neural lineage, the medium was changed to EB medium (DMEM/F12 containing 5% KSR, 1%\nl\n-glutamine, 0.8% NEAA, 0.1\u00a0mM 2-mercaptoethanol and penicillin\u2013streptomycin) with 3\u00a0\u03bcM dorsomorphin (Sigma), 3\u00a0\u03bcM SB431542 (Sigma), and 3\u00a0\u03bcM CHIR99021 (Focus Biomolecules, USA). On day 4 of differentiation, the medium was changed to EB medium with only 1\u00a0\u03bcM retinoic acid (Sigma). On days 7, 10, and 13 of differentiation, the medium was changed to EB medium with 1\u00a0\u03bcM retinoic acid and 1\u00a0\u03bcM purmorphamine (Cayman, Japan), and the culture was maintained until day 16. On day 16 of differentiation, the EBs were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE Select (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), and the dissociated cells were cultured as a cell suspension with 1\u20134\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n5\ncells/mL cell density in neurosphere medium, which contained media hormone mix (MHM) supplemented with B-27 (final 2%, Nacalai), NEAA (final 0.8%), purmorphamine (final 1\u00a0\u03bcM), FGF2 (final 20\u00a0ng/mL), and epidermal growth factor (final 10\u00a0ng/mL, EGF, PeproTech, USA) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO\n2\n. On days 17\u201331 of differentiation, the supplemented neurosphere medium was changed every 4\u20136\u00a0days to form spheres until day 32. On differentiation day 32, the primary neurospheres were dissociated as described above and cultured with the same cell density in supplemented neurosphere medium without purmorphamine. On days 33\u201347 of differentiation, the culture was maintained until day 48. On day 48 of differentiation, the secondary neurospheres were dissociated in the same way as on days 16 and 32 and plated at a density of 4\u201310\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n5\ncells/well in 6-well plates coated with 0.5% growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (Corning, USA) with iPSC-derived astrocyte differentiation medium, which consisted of MHM medium containing B-27 (final 2%, Nacalai), NEAA (final 0.8%), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (final 10\u00a0ng/mL, BDNF, R&D, USA), and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (final 10\u00a0ng/mL, GDNF, Alamone, Israel) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO\n2\n. On days 49\u201376 of differentiation, the medium was changed to fresh medium every 4\u20137\u00a0days until day 77. On differentiation day 77, the iPSC-derived astrocytes were dissociated using Accutase (Nacalai), and the dissociated cells were plated at a density of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n6\ncells/dish in 100-mm dishes coated with 0.05% Matrigel in iPSC-derived astrocyte differentiation medium. On days 78\u201397 of differentiation, the plated cells were dissociated and cultured as described above once a week (at least twice during days 78\u201397). On differentiation day 98, iPSC-derived astrocytes were dissociated, used for experiments and stored in serum-free CellBanker2 (Zenoaq, Japan) at \u2212180\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n4.4. Formation of microglia\nDetails of microglial differentiation from hiPSCs are summarized in\nSonn et al., 2022\n. Briefly, GeneJuice (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, 70,967) and Opti-MEM medium (Gibco\u2122, 31,985,070) were used to establish a doxycycline-inducible PU.1-overexpression clone of hiPSCs. Then, the generation of microglial cells from iPSCs was divided into two stages. First, hematopoietic progenitor cells were generated from hiPSCs (hiHPCs; \u223cday 18) in modified StemPro\u2122-34 SFM (1\u00d7) (Gibco\u2122, 10,639,011) medium supplied with multiple cytokines and chemicals (BMP4 (PEPROTECH), CHIR99021 (Focus Biomolecules), VEGF (Thermo Fisher Scientific), FGF2 (PEPROTECH), SCF (PEPROTECH), IL-3 (PEPROTECH), IL-6 (PEPROTECH), and IWR-1e (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Doxycycline (1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) was added to the medium during days 6\u00a0\u223c\u00a018.\nSecond, microglia-like cells were differentiated from hiHPCs (day 19\u223c) in modified DMEM/F12 (1:1, Gibco\u2122) supplied with a cocktail of five cytokines (100\u00a0ng/mL IL-34, 50\u00a0ng/mL TGF\u03b21, 25\u00a0ng/mL\u00a0M-CSF, 100\u00a0ng/mL CD200, and 100\u00a0ng/mL CX3CL1, all from PEPROTECH). Induced microglia were used for analysis on day 21.\n\n4.5. Formation of cerebral organoids\nCerebral organoids were generated based on the protocol of the STEMdiff Cerebral Organoid Kit (STEMCELL Technologies, ST-08570). On day 0, hiPSCs (414C2) were suspended at a density of 9.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n4\n/mL in EB Formation Medium (with Y27632 (Nacalai Tesque, 08945\u201371)). A total of 100\u00a0\u03bcL of cell suspension was seeded in a 96-well ultralow-attachment plate (9000 cells/well) and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. On days 2 and 4, 100\u00a0\u03bcL of EB Formation Medium (without Y27632) was added. On day 5, the solution was replaced with induction medium, and organoids were cultured for 48\u00a0h. From day 7, organoids were embedded in Matrigel Matrix (Cornig, 356,230). On day 7, the solution was replaced with Expansion Medium, and the organoids were incubated for 72\u00a0h. From day 10, plates were shaken on an orbital shaker at 70\u00a0rpm, and organoids were cultured in maturation medium. The medium was changed every 4\u00a0days until day 30.\n\n4.6. Pseudotyped lentivirus production\nSARS-CoV-2_S pseudotyped lentivirus, SARS-CoV-2_S (B.1.617.2 var./Delta) pseudotyped lentivirus, and SARS-CoV-2_S (B.1.1.529, Omicron) pseudotyped lentivirus were synthesized by VectorBuilder. EGFP was inserted under the EF1a promoter as a fluorescent reporter (pLV-EF1a-EGFP). Instead of the VSV-G envelope, the S protein of the coronavirus is expressed, a virus that can mimic the manner in which SARS-Co-2 infects cells. It does not transduce the S-protein coding gene into the host cells. See\nSupplementary Fig. 2\nfor the vector map.\nSupplementary Fig. 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nVector map of pseudotyped lentivirus.\n\n4.7. Immunostaining\nFor immunocytochemistry, samples were plated onto poly-L-ornithine/fibronectin-coated chamber slide glasses or 12-well plates and fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 30\u00a0min at room temperature. The samples were rinsed with PBS three times and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS for 5\u00a0min at room temperature. After blocking with Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque, 03953\u201395) for 15\u00a0min at room temperature, the slides were incubated at 4\u00a0\u00b0C overnight with the following antibodies: mouse anti-\u03b2-III tubulin (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, T8660-2ML; 1:500), mouse anti-nestin (Merck Millipore, MAB5326; 1:500), anti-GFAP, and rabbit anti-Iba1 (FUJIFILM, 019\u201319,741; 1:500). After washing three times with PBS, the samples were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-11034), Alexa 555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21424; 1:500), Alexa 555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21434; 1:500) or Alexa 555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21428; 1:500) for 60\u00a0min at room temperature and then subjected to nuclear counterstaining with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, B2883; 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). The samples were analyzed with a FLUOVIEW FV3000 (OLYMPUS) and LSM700 (Carl Zeiss).\nAt least 100 cells were observed, and this was done for\nn\n=\u00a03. All microglia were infected with pseudotyped lentivirus, but no other neurons, astrocytes, or NS/PCs were infected at all, so no quantitative graphs were made.\n\n4.8. Bulk mRNA-seq analysis\nFor mRNA-seq analysis (in\nFig. 5\n,\nFig. 6\n), we included data from previous studies deposited in the GEO (\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\n) and DDBJ (\nhttps://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/\n) databases as follows: neurons and NS/PCs in\nGSE196144\n, astrocytes in\nGSE161024\n, and microglia in\nGSE178284\n. mRNA-seq (FASTQ file format) data were quality checked, and low-quality reads (score\u00a0<\u00a030), adapter sequences, and overrepresented sequences such as those with a poly-A chain were trimmed using Trim Galore! (ver.0.4.0). The remaining reads were mapped to the\nHomo sapiens\n(hg19) genome using HISAT2 (ver. 2.2.2.0) (\nKim et al., 2019\n), and the output file (BAM file format) was summarized using StringTie (ver. 2.1.5).\n\n4.9. Statistical analysis\nFor each statistical analysis, three or four independent experiments were carried out. Statistical significance was determined with one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey\u2013Kramer test. Throughout the study,\np\nvalues <0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. The following significance thresholds were used throughout the study: **\np\n<\u00a00.01 and ***\np\n<\u00a00.001. The values in the bar and line graphs represent the means \u00b1 SDs in\nFig. 5\n,\nFig. 6\n, and ns means not significant. GraphPad Prism Version 9.4.1 (MDF) was used for the analysis.\nThe following are the supplementary data related to this article."

    "Methods": "Animals and housing:\nAll housing, surgery, and postoperative care were approved by The University of Texas at Austin Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol AUP-2021\u201300171). All animals were fed standard chow and filtered tap water\nad libitum\nand maintained on a 12:12 light/dark cycle. Adult (8\u201312 weeks old) male and female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson stock 000664) were tested during the light cycle. Mice were housed in pairs. Mice in all treatment groups were numbered randomly to ensure researchers were blind to group. At the experimental endpoint, mice were injected with an overdose of Pentobarbital (200\u2013270 mg/kg, MWI Animal Health 011355) and tissue was collected for potential later analyses.\n\nBehavioral tests for anxiety-like behavior:\nThermal Increments Dark-Light (TIDAL) Conflict Test:\nThe TIDAL conflict apparatus is a modified thermal place preference (TPP) apparatus (Ugo Basile, Cat. No. 35250), which consists of two cylinders (20 cm diameter x 25 cm high) connected by a narrow center walkway (\nFig. 1\n). For TIDAL testing, one cylinder (the \u201clight chamber\u201d) is kept in constant light and at a temperature of 31\u00b0C, which is an isothermic temperature for mice; in contrast, the other cylinder (\u201cdark chamber\u201d) is covered with a fitted opaque lid and a flexible opaque outside cover to maintain darkness inside the cylinder and the temperature is manipulated from 31 to 44\u00b0C (\nFig. 1A\n,\nC\n). The base of the light chamber, dark chamber, and center walkway of the TIDAL apparatus are made of metal. Light cylinder illumination levels were 550 lux, and dark cylinder illumination levels were 8 lux. In addition, the center walkway was covered with a clear plastic film \u201croof\u201d to limit mouse interest in escaping through the open space. The center walkway temperature is not directly controlled, but is increased above room temperature by the increased temperatures of the neighboring chambers; center walkway temperature was measured at approximately 31\u00b0C (\u00b11\u00b0C) throughout the test. Mice are not acclimated to the apparatus prior to testing. To optimally detect the salience of anxiety vs. thermal avoidance we defined the following parameters: Mice are initially allowed to explore the apparatus for 5 minutes with both plates at 31\u00b0C (exploratory phase; initial light-dark test); next, an additional five minutes is spent with both plates at 31\u00b0C; then, the temperature on the dark plate is raised to 39\u00b0C and increased by 1\u00b0C every five minutes to a maximum temperature of 44\u00b0C (with the light plate maintained at an isothermic 31\u00b0C) (\nFig. 1A\n\u2013\nD\n). TIDAL parameters were optimized in our previous work (Lee et al., 2022), where we revealed that incrementally increasing the dark plate temperature between 39\u201344\u00b0C revealed a slow, predictable decline in dark-heated plate preference and exposed sex differences in anxiety-like behavior. At temperatures higher than 44\u00b0C, dark-heated plate preference declined sharply: na\u00efve mice of both sexes had dark plate preferences of <8% at 49\u00b0C and <3% at 52\u00b0C (\nLee et al., 2023a\n). Thus, these high temperatures are robustly aversive to mice of both sexes, and are therefore not as useful for discerning differences in anxiety- or pain-like behavior.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nThe TIDAL conflict test is a new assay for exploring the relative salience of anxiety vs. heat sensitivity.\nA.\nThe TIDAL conflict test apparatus consists of two temperature-controlled plates linked by a center walkway. The mouse can freely move between an illuminated plate, which remains at an isothermic 31\u00b0C, and a dark plate, which starts at 31\u00b0C but incrementally increases to aversive temperatures.\nB.\nThe thermal place preference (TPP) test is a control condition for the TIDAL test. Both chambers in TPP are illuminated; one plate increases in temperature, while the other plate remains at an isothermic 31\u00b0C.\nC.\nTimeline of an TIDAL/TPP test, which takes ~40 min per mouse. The first 5 min with both plates at 31\u00b0C is an acclimation period and is a control dark-light test. The TIDAL/TPP test begins with a second 31\u00b0C session, then the heated plate increases in temperature incrementally, 1\u00b0C every 5 min, from 39 to 44\u00b0C. The isothermic plate remains at 31\u00b0C throughout the test.\nD.\nInterpretation of potential TIDAL outcomes after SCI. At baseline (e.g., uninjured), mice are expected to decrease dark plate preference as its temperature increases. If SCI increases salience of heat (relative to dark-light), mice will leave the dark plate earlier \u2013 i.e., shifting the curve to the left. If SCI increases salience of anxiety (relative to heat), mice will prefer the dark plate to higher temperatures - i.e., shifting the curve to the right.\nThermal Place Preference (TPP) Assay:\nThe TPP assay is used as a control to isolate thermal sensitivity from the anxiety-like portion of the TIDAL conflict assay. The TPP setup is the same as the TIDAL setup (two cylinders connected by a center walkway), except that both the heated side and the side maintained at 31\u00b0C are exposed to room lighting (\nFig. 1B\n) \u2013 i.e., the heated side is illuminated, not dark as in the TIDAL conflict assay. Next, the same incremental temperature increases are initiated.\nTIDAL and TPP \u2013 testing, automated video recording, and analysis:\nMice tested on TPP and TIDAL assays were interspersed throughout the day (i.e., during the light phase \u2013 Zeitgeber time 1\u201311). Unless otherwise noted, distinct mice were used for these tests to avoid effects of learning observed in repeated testing. The percent time spent in the dark cylinder (percent dark cylinder time = (dark cylinder time x 100)/(dark cylinder + illuminated cylinder time)), distance traveled, and dark crossings were automatically recorded and scored using an overhead video camera and EthoVision software. Time in the center walkway was excluded from analyses in the main manuscript for two reasons: (1) the surroundings in the center zone differed from the test chambers; and (2) analyzing behavior in the identically-shaped illuminated chamber vs. dark-heating chamber enabled a two-chamber preference comparison with equal preference clearly defined at 50% time in each chamber. Data including the center zone is presented in the corresponding\nSupplementary figures\n, and show that including the center zone in analysis has little effect on the percent dark plate preference differences between groups. The arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials.\n\nSurgery and locomotor testing\nSurgeries \u2013 laminectomy and spinal cord injury:\nFor all experiments, mouse surgeries were interspersed throughout the day (during the light cycle). Male and female mice were anesthetized with isoflurane inhalation anesthesia (1.5%; MWI Animal Health 502017) and treated with prophylactic buprenorphine (0.075 mg/kg; MWI Animal Health 060969) immediately prior to surgery. A dorsal T9 laminectomy was performed. The periosteum, but not the dura, was removed for all surgeries (this is the end of the surgery for sham mice). SCI mice were then subjected to a moderate contusion SCI (65 kDyn, 0 s dwell) at thoracic level 9 (T9) using the Infinite Horizon impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation) (\nGaudet et al., 2021\n;\nGaudet et al., 2016\n;\nLee et al., 2023b\n). SCI mice from TPP and TIDAL groups had similar injury force and displacement, respectively: female-TPP: 67.3 \u00b1 0.9 kDyn, 524 \u00b1 17 \u03bcm; female-TIDAL: 68 \u00b1 2 kDyn, 524 \u00b1 13 \u03bcm; male-TPP: 68 \u00b1 1 kDyn, 521 \u00b1 30 \u03bcm; male-TIDAL: 68 \u00b1 1 kDyn, 516 \u00b1 36 \u03bcm. Mice were monitored daily for infection or signs of abnormal recovery. To limit confounding effects on sensitivity-related behaviors, post-surgery analgesics were withheld. Post-operative mouse care included manual voiding of bladders twice daily, and hydration support via daily subcutaneous injection of Ringer\u2019s solution (2, 2, 1, 1, 1 mL on the first 5 days post-operative (dpo), respectively).\nLocomotor testing (Basso Mouse Scale):\nMouse locomotion was assessed before surgery and at 1, 4, 7, 10, and 14 dpo using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) (\nBasso et al., 2006\n). Movement of mouse hindlimbs and walking were assessed for four minutes in an open field by two condition-blind observers. Scores on the scale range from 9 (healthy mouse with coordinated, parallel steps and trunk stability) to 0 (no movement of ankle joints).\n\nExperiments and mouse numbers\nMice were 6\u20138 weeks old at time of testing. Groups of mice included female-uninjured-TPP (n=13), female-uninjured-TIDAL (n=17), female-SCI-TPP (n=9), female-SCI-TIDAL (n=17), male-uninjured-TPP (n=7), male-uninjured-TIDAL (n=24), male-SCI-TPP (n=9), and male-SCI-TIDAL (n=19). Several mice died after surgery and prior to TPP/TIDAL testing, including 5 that died during or immediately after surgery; 5 that were euthanized due to poor recovery after surgery; and 2 that were found dead in their cage. No differences were observed between na\u00efve and sham mice, so these groups were combined as \u201cuninjured\u201d (6 na\u00efve females and 6 na\u00efve females in the TIDAL groups; all the rest received sham surgery). A subset of 7 dpo TIDAL mice were re-tested on TIDAL at 21 dpo (TIDAL only; no TPP mice were also tested at 21 dpo): female-uninjured (n=12), female-SCI (n=8), male-uninjured (n=12), and male-SCI (n=9).\n\nStatistics\nMouse TIDAL behavior (dark plate preference, distance traveled) was analyzed using one-, two-, or three-way ANOVA (repeated measures, when appropriate), followed by Bonferroni\npost-hoc\ntests. In experiments with two groups, a Student\u2019s\nt-\ntest (or nonparametric Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest) was performed. Prism 9 (GraphPad) was used for visualizing data and SigmaPlot 14 (SPSS) was used for statistical analyses."

Animal handling and experimental use followed NIH guidelines and protocols approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Western University of Health Sciences. In all experiments male WT and AS mice aged between 2\u20134 months were used. Control mice were age-matched, male, WT littermates. Multiple liters were used for all experiments. Mice, housed in groups of two to three per cage, were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum.\n\nCell culture and transfection\nCOS-1 cell lines were obtained from ATCC, and grown in DMEM (Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO\n2\naccording to published protocols (\nSun, Liu et al. 2018\n). To knockdown UBE3A, cells were incubated with 20 nM SMARTpool ON-TARGETplus Human UBE3A siRNA (UBE3A siRNA, GE Dharmacon, L-005137-00-0010) or ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting Control Pool (control siRNA, GE Dharmacon, D-001810-10-20) for 72 h before being used for immunofluorescence or Western blot analysis.\n\nImmunofluorescence\nFor immunofluorescence with brain tissue sections, mice were sacrificed under deep anesthesia using pentobarbital administered intraperitoneally (IP) and were perfused through the left cardiac ventricle with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Whole brains were removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by sequential immersion in 15% and 30% sucrose for cryoprotection. The cerebellum was then dissected and 25 \u03bcm sagittal sections were prepared with a cryomicrotome (CM 1950, LEICA). Free-floating sections were processed for immunohistochemical staining as previously described (\nQin, Baudry et al. 2009\n,\nSun, Liu et al. 2015\n). In brief, tissue sections were blocked for 1 h at room temperature (RT) in 5% goat serum (GS) with 0.3% Triton-X100 in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (0.3% PBST). After blocking, free-floating tissue sections were incubated in primary antibody diluted in a solution of 1% bovine serum albumin (1%BSA) with 0.3% PBST overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The following day, sections were briefly washed 3 times for 5 min each at RT in PBS followed by incubation with secondary antibodies diluted in a solution of 1% BSA with 0.3% PBST for 2 h at RT. Sections were then briefly washed 4 times for 5 min each at RT in PBS and mounted using Vectashield mounting media with DAPI (H-1200, Vector Laboratories) to stain cell nuclei. Brain sections were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal laser-scanning microscope.\nFor immunofluorescence with COS-1 cells, cultured cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C followed by 0.25% TritonX-100 in PBS for 10 min at RT. Cells were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h at RT. After blocking, cells were incubated with primary antibody in 3% BSA/PBS overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The following day, coverslips were then washed with PBS 3 times for 5 min each at RT and then incubated with secondary antibody in 3% BSA/PBS for 2 h at RT. After washing 4 times for 5 min each with PBS, cells were mounted on glass slides using Vectashield mounting media with DAPI followed by obtaining on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal laser-scanning microscope.\n\nTissue collection, P1/S1 fractionation, and Western blot analysis\nMice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and then decapitated. The whole brain was removed, and various brain regions (cerebellum and hippocampus) were dissected. Brain tissues were immediately used or frozen on dry ice and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further processes.\nP1/S1 fractionation was prepared using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents Kit (Cat# 78835, Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. For whole homogenates, cerebellum tissue was homogenized in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS and a protease inhibitor cocktail). Cultured COS-1 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (Tris-HCl 25 mM pH 7.4, NaCl 150 mM, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5% CHAPS and a protease inhibitor cocktail). The total protein concentration of the resultant samples was measured with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Prod# 23225, Thermo fisher Scientific).\nWestern blot were performed using previously published protocols (\nSun, Zhu et al. 2015\n). In brief, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membranes (Cat# IPFL00010, Millipore). After incubation with 3% BSA/TBS (Tris-buffered saline) at RT for 1 h, membranes were incubated with specific primary antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Following incubation in primary antibodies, membranes were washed with TBST (Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20) three times; 5 min each wash, at RT, and then incubated with secondary antibodies (IRDye secondary antibodies) for 2 h at RT with gentle shaking. The specific protein bands were analyzed with the Odyssey imaging system and LI-COR Image Studio Software.\n\nAntibodies\nThe following antibodies were used: LC3-B-N-Terminus (1:200, catalog\n#\n0231\u2013100/LC3\u20135F10, Nanotools); LC3-B-N-Terminus (1:500, catalog\n#\nAP1802a, Abgent); Anti-LC3 mAb (1:50, catalog\n#\nM152\u20133, MBL); LAMP2 (1:200; catalog\n#\nab13524; Abcam); UBE3A (1:1000, catalog\n#\nA300\u2013351A, Bethyl); GAPDH (1:1000, catalog\n#\nMAB374, EMD Millipore); LaminB1 (1:1000, catalog\n#\nab16048, Abcam); p62/SQSTM1 (1:1000, catalog\n#\n16-RB62, American Research Products); AMPK (1:1000, catalog\n#\n2532S, Cell Signaling Technology); AMPK-Thr172 (1:1000, catalog\n#\n2535S, Cell Signaling Technology); ULK1-Ser757 (1:1000, catalog\n#\n6888, Cell Signaling Technology); ULK1 (1:500, catalog\n#\nab65056, Abcam); ULK1-Ser777 (1:1000, catalog\n#\nABC213, Sigma); ULK1-Ser317 (1:1000, catalog\n#\n37762S, Cell Signaling Technology); 4EBP1-Ser65 (1:1000, catalog\n#\n9451, Cell Signaling Technology); 4EBP1 (1:1000, catalog\n#\n9644S, Cell Signaling Technology); Cathepsin B (1:500, catalog\n#\nAF965, R&D System); p53 (1:200, catalog\n#\nAHO0112, Invitrogen); p53-Ser15 (1:1000, catalog\n#\n9286L, Cell Signaling Technology); p53-Ser15 (1:1000, catalog\n#\n9284L, Cell Signaling Technology); Calbindin (1:500, catalog\n#\n300, Swant); TFEB (1:1000, catalog\n#\nA303\u2013673A, Bethyl); Goat anti-rabbit IgG IRDye\n\u00ae\n680RD (1:10000, catalog\n#\n926\u201368071, LI-COR Biosciences); Goat anti-mouse IgG IRDye\n\u00ae\n800CW (1:10000, catalog\n#\n926\u201332210, LI-COR Biosciences); Donkey anti-goat IgG IRDye\n\u00ae\n800CW (1:10000, catalog\n#\n926\u201332214, LI-COR Biosciences); Goat anti-rabbit IgG AlexaFluor 594 (1:200, catalog\n#\nA-11037, Invitrogen); Goat anti-mouse IgG AlexaFluor 594 (1:200, catalog\n#\nA-11005, Invitrogen); Goat anti-rat IgG AlexaFluor 488 (1:400, catalog\n#\nA-11006, Invitrogen); Goat anti-rabbit IgG AlexaFluor 488 (1:400, catalog\n#\nA-11008, Invitrogen); Goat anti-mouse IgG AlexaFluor 488 (1:400, catalog\n#\nA-11029, Invitrogen).\n\nImage analysis, quantification, and statistical analysis\nSlides were imaged by using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope and pictures were analyzed with the particle analysis macro of NIH ImageJ. After splitting channels, images from different experimental groups were first thresholded at the same level, individual cells were then outlined, and 20\u201330 cells per brain were analyzed. The colocalization coefficient was analyzed using Zeiss ZEN Microscopy Software. Results are presented as means \u00b1 SEM.

    "Methods": "Isolation of Mitochondria from Mouse Brain Tissue\nAll of the studies performed were approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee (IACUC #2021-3849). Additionally, the Division of Laboratory Animal Resources at the University of Kentucky is accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation for Laboratory Animal Care, International (AAALAC, International) and all experiments were performed with its guidelines. All experiments were conducted using 22 total 8-10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME; RRID: IMSR_JAX:000664). No sample calculation was performed prior to these exploratory studies, though group numbers for these experiments were based on historical data which have employed n=4-6 mice per group with \u22653 technical replicates for\nex vivo\nanalysis of mitochondrial bioenergetics[\n19\n]. Mice were housed 5 per cage in a 14-hour/10-hour light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. All experiments began in the morning (~9:00am) with mouse euthanasia and were completed by mid-afternoon (~3:00pm). Mice were rendered unconscious by carbon dioxide and immediately decapitated. Brains were removed, whole cortices were dissected, and homogenized in a Teflon-glass dounce homogenizer in 4mL isolation buffer (215mM mannitol, 75mM sucrose, 0.1% BSA, 20mM HEPES, 1mM EGTA, adjusted pH 7.2 with KOH) per cortical hemisphere (8ml total). Homogenate was transferred to a 2mL microcentrifuge tube and spun at 1,300xg for 3 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was then transferred to a fresh 2mL tube and spun at 13,000xg for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Supernatant was discarded and the crude mitochondrial pellet was triturated in 400\u03bcL of isolation buffer to attain a final volume of 500\u03bcL. To obtain\ntotal mitochondria\n, the samples were placed into a nitrogen cell disruption chamber at 1,200 psi N\n2\nfor 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C to burst the synaptoneurosomes and release the synaptic mitochondria followed by loading it over the double layer of Ficoll gradient (10% bottom and 7.5% top)[\n20\n]. Ultracentrifugation steps were followed as described previously[\n19\n,\n21\n]. After ultracentrifugation, the Ficoll solution and debris were carefully pipetted out to avoid contaminating the pelleted mitochondria. The mitochondrial pellets were triturated in 500\u03bcL isolation buffer, transferred to a clean 1.5mL Eppendorf tube, and then brought to 1.5mL in isolation buffer. The samples were spun at 13,000xg for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C to obtain the final mitochondrial pellet. Alternatively,\nsynaptic and non-synaptic mitochondria\nwere obtained by loading 500\u03bcL of the crude mitochondrial pellet to the Ficoll density gradient prior to nitrogen cell disruption, as previously described[\n19\n,\n21\n]. Synaptoneurosomes containing synaptic mitochondria were collected from the interface of the two Ficoll layers and placed into 2mL tubes, while non-synaptic mitochondria were pelleted at the bottom. Non-synaptic mitochondria were processed the same way as total mitochondria stated above. Synaptoneurosomes were diluted 4X with isolation buffer, thoroughly triturated, and then spun at 13,000xg for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The synaptoneurosomes were placed into the nitrogen cell disruptor at 1,200 psi for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C to release the synaptic mitochondria. Ultracentrifugation and further processing were performed as stated above. Protein concentrations of each mitochondrial fraction were determined with BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, #23227, 2021) by measuring absorbance at 560nm on the Biotek Synergy HTX multi-mode plate reader (Agilent; RRID: SCR_019749) and mitochondria were maintained at concentrations of \u2265 10mg/ml. Aliquots of cortical mitochondria from each mouse were arbitrarily selected to receive each MAOI or vehicle treatment. These exploratory experiments were not set up for blinding procedures and there were no pre-determined exclusion criteria.\n\nMAOI Formulation\nMitochondrial assays were performed in the presence of inhibitors of MAO-A (clorgyline; Cayman Chemical #15925, 2021), MAO-B (rasagiline #SML0124, 2021 and deprenyl #M003,2021; Sigma-Aldrich), or combination MAO-A and MAO-B (pargyline; Sigma-Aldrich #P8013, 2021). The 15.5mM stock compounds were prepared in 100% DMSO and diluted in respiration buffer (215mM mannitol, 75mM sucrose, 0.1% BSA, 20mM HEPES, 2mM MgCl\n2\n, and 2.5mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, pH 7.2) so that the concentration of each compound was 10\u03bcM after the first port addition (total volume 175\u03bcL). For additional bioenergetic assessment of clorgyline, a 20mM stock was made in 100% DMSO and diluted to 10mM in respiration buffer. Serial dilutions were prepared in respiration buffer so that the final concentrations were 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80\u03bcM after the first port addition (total volume 175\u03bcL). For ROS assessment of clorgyline, 4mM clorgyline stock was prepared in 100% DMSO and diluted in DMSO to 2mM, 1mM, 0.5mM, and 0.25mM to achieve concentrations of 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80\u03bcM of clorgyline, respectively, after loading 2\u03bcL/dose/well in 100\u03bcL total reaction volume. After isolation, mitochondria were in the presence of each treatment for the duration of the following experimental procedures.\n\nMitochondrial Bioenergetic Measurements\nFollowing isolation, mitochondrial bioenergetic studies were carried out using the Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer (Agilent Technologies; RRID: SCR_019545) as described previously[\n22\n]. 1.25\u03bcg mitochondria were loaded into the Seahorse plate wells and treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO in respiration buffer), 10\u03bcM clorgyline, 10\u03bcM rasagiline, 10\u03bcM pargyline, or 10\u03bcM deprenyl (n = 4/group) immediately prior to bioenergetic measurements. Follow up dose dependent bioenergetic assessment was performed in the presence of 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80\u03bcM of clorgyline (n= 3/group with 3-4 technical replicates per sample). Oxygen Consumption Rates (OCR) were measured in the presence of different substrates, inhibitors, and uncouplers of the mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain (ETC) as described previously[\n23\n]. State III respiration (respiration coupled to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis) is measured after the addition of pyruvate and malate (PM; 5mM pyruvate and 2.5mM malate) which are tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle substrates that feed electrons through Complex I, and adenosine diphosphate (ADP; 1mM), a necessary substrate to allow the flow of protons through ATP synthase. State IV respiration (proton leak or respiration without ATP synthesis) is measured after the addition of oligomycin (2.5\u03bcM), an inhibitor of ATP synthase. State V(CI) respiration (Complex I-driven maximum respiration) is measured after the addition of (FCCP; 4\u03bcM), a mitochondrial uncoupler that carries protons back into the matrix, which lowers \u0394\u03a8\nm\n, and causes the ETC to uncouple from ATP production. Finally, State V(CII) respiration (Complex II-driven maximum respiration) is measured after the addition of rotenone(0.8\u03bcM), a Complex I inhibitor, and succinate (10mM), a TCA cycle substrate that can feed directly into Complex II of the ETC.\n\nROS Measurements\nROS production was measured in 5\u03bcg of freshly isolated mitochondria as described previously[\n24\n,\n25\n]. Each mitochondrial sample was loaded onto a black 96 well plate in quadruplicate so that measurements of oligomycin and FCCP were obtained in duplicate for each concentration of clorgyline (i.e. 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80\u03bcM; n = 5/group with 2 technical replicates per biological sample). The FCCP protocol was formulated in respiration buffer to obtain the final concentrations of the following reagents: 2\u03bcM FCCP, 5mM pyruvate, 2.5mM malate, 10\u03bcM 2\u2019,7\u2019-dichlorodihydroflurorescein diacetate (DCF-DA; Molecular Probes #D-399, 2021), and 30\u03bcL of 20mg/mL horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Sigma P-6782, 2021, 250 units/mg solid) per 6mL solution. Oligomycin protocol was prepared in the same manner to achieve a final concentration of 2.5\u03bcM oligomycin, excluding FCCP. Fluorescence was read immediately at 485 ex. / 528 em. nm at 1-minute intervals for 20 minutes in the Synergy HTX microplate reader (BioTek) at 37\u00b0C. The relative ROS production at 12 minutes, the time at which the slope of the line of fluorescent readings across time was linear for all samples, was selected for analysis. Mitochondria were then stored at \u221220\u00b0C for future assessment of ETC complex activities.\n\nFunctional Assessment of Mitochondrial ETC Complexes\nFrozen, reserved mitochondria were utilized for the assessment of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes in the Seahorse XFe96 Flux Analyzer, modified from Jaber et al.[\n26\n]. Mitochondria were thawed on ice prior to dilution in Mir05 buffer (0.5mM EGTA, 3mM MgCl\n2\n, 60mM lactobionic acid, 20mM taurine, 10mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 20mM HEPES, 110mM sucrose). 0.5\u03bcg of mitochondria were resuspended in Mir05 buffer. The OCR measurements were carried out using Seahorse after adding alamethicin (35\u03bcg/mL), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH; 3.5mM), cytochrome c (17.52\u03bcM), and either 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80\u03bcM clorgyline (n = 5 / group with 3 technical replicates per biological sample). Remaining substrates and inhibitors of the ETC were prepared in respiration buffer without BSA and loaded into the injection ports as followed: (A) rotenone (0.8\u03bcM) and succinate (10mM), (B) antimycin A (1\u03bcM), (C) ascorbate (20mM) and\nN\n,\nN\n,\nN\n\u2019,\nN\n\u2019-tetramethyl-\np\n-phenylenediamine (TMPD; 5mM), (D) sodium azide (549.3mM). 2-3 OCR readings were taken after each port addition to ensure the full activity was measured. To obtain Complex I activity, the antimycin A reading was subtracted from the baseline reading. To obtain Complex II activity, the antimycin A reading was subtracted from the rotenone/succinate reading. To obtain Complex IV activity, the sodium azide reading was subtracted from the ascorbate/TMPD reading.\n\nWestern Blotting of MAO Isoforms\nTotal, synaptic, and non-synaptic mitochondria (n = 5 biological replicates/group) were isolated in isolation buffer containing cOmplete\n\u2122\nprotease inhibitor (Roche #11697498001, 2006) and PhosSTOP\n\u2122\nphosphatase inhibitor (Roche #04906837001, 2022). Mitochondria samples were prepared in 2X Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad #161-0737, 2022) and heated to 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes. 30\u03bcg of each sample were subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% tris-glycine/SDS PAGE gel (Bio-Rad #5671044, 2022) run at 150V for 1 hour and 20 minutes in tris-glycine/SDS running buffer (25mM tris base, 190mM glycine, 01% SDS; pH adjusted to 8.3). Separated proteins were then transferred onto a PVDF membrane in tris/glycine transfer buffer (25mM tris base, 190mM glycine, 20% methanol; pH adjusted to 8.3) at 90V for 1 hour on ice. Membranes were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature (~25\u00b0C) in 5% dry milk in TBST wash buffer (1X Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween\n\u00ae\n20). Membranes were incubated with either 1:5,000 MAO-A (Abcam, #ab126751, RRID: AB_11129867), 1:100 MAO-B (Santa Cruz Biologicals; sc-515354, RRID: AB_2819030), or 1:1,000 Tom20 (Cell Signaling, #42406, RRID: AB_2687663) primary antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. Membranes were washed 3x5 minutes with TBST before incubation with fluorescent secondary antibody (LI-COR, 1:15,000 goat anti-mouse #926-68070, RRID: AB_10956588 or 1:20,000 anti-rabbit #926-32211, RRID: AB_621843) Membranes were then washed 3x5 minutes with TBST before fluorescent imaging on the Odyssey CLx imager (LI-COR; RRID:SCR_014579). The mean gray value of each band was calculated using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) to determine the relative amount of each MAO isoform in each mitochondrial fraction. ImageJ defines mean gray value as the sum of the gray values of all of the pixels in the section divided by the number of pixels.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, CA; version 9.0.2 (161)). For all analyses, the significance value was set to p<0.05 to detect differences between groups. The Brown-Forsythe and Bartlett\u2019s tests were performed to assess homogeneity of variance. The Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to ensure normality. Parametric statistics were employed for all analyses, with the exception of State IV respiration in the first set of experiments (see\nFigure 1\n), data which did not pass the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality. The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was employed to assess only this dataset. For assessment of mitochondrial bioenergetics, ROS production, and ETC complex function, data sets were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and when appropriate, post-hoc analysis using Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test. Mean gray volume of MAO-A and MAO-B from each mitochondrial fraction by Western blot were evaluated using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc analysis by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test. One outlier was identified after data was plotted using Grubbs test and excluded from the total mitochondria data set for Western blot analysis.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nMitochondrial respiration in the presence of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). No significant changes in oxygen consumption rates (OCR) were observed in State III, State IV, or State V(CII) mitochondrial respiration in the presence of any MAOI compared to vehicle. 10\u03bcM clorgyline significantly increased State V(CI) mitochondrial respiration compared to vehicle. Data represented as mean \u00b1 SD, n (number of mice) = 4/group. One-way ANOVA for State III, IV, and V(CII) respiration with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons where applicable. State IV respiration did not pass the normality assumption, so the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was employed. **p = 0.0098."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals and Treatment Protocols\nTwo-month-old CF1 male mice (n=84) were obtained from Centro de\nReprodu\u00e7\u00e3o e Experimenta\u00e7\u00e3o de Animais de\nLaborat\u00f3rio (CREAL, UFRGS, Porto Alegre, Brazil). Mice were housed in\nlarge plexiglass cages (38 cm \u00d7 32 cm \u00d7 16 cm) in which a\ntransparent acrylic running wheel (16 cm diameter, 8 cm wide) was attached to\nthe stainless-steel coverage. To avoid detrimental changes associated with\nsocial isolation, we maintained n=4 mice/per cage (\nMuller et al., 2011\n). The housing temperature was\nkept at 22 \u00b0C under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (lights on at 7 a.m.)\nwith water and food provided\nad libitum\n. The daily and total\ndistance running was measured through an automatic counter system, that measures\neach complete revolution of the running wheel using a sensor and calculates the\ndistance using MS excel\n\u00ae\n. The information was stored in an\ninternal micro SD card and then extracted in a computer for quantitative\nanalysis. The running wheel and electronic system were developed by our\nlaboratory and described elsewhere (\nde Carvalho\net al., 2017\n;\nDietrich et al.,\n2005\n;\nMuller et al., 2011\n;\nPortela et al., 2017\n).\nOur study design comprised two settings of experiments; the first one\nwas carried out with healthy mice exposed or not to the voluntary running wheel.\nThe second was performed with healthy mice exposed or not to the voluntary\nrunning wheel, and subsequently submitted to TBI. To submit mice to different\nvolumes of exercise, the rotation of the voluntary running wheel was controlled\nusing metal clamps, that locked the wheel in position. It should be reinforced\nthat for the same type of exercise stimulus daily workout presents comparatively\nhigher volume than alternate days workout (\nWeineck, 2019\n). Hence, mice were randomly assigned to the following\ngroups: sedentary (SED; running wheel constantly locked); lower-volume exercise\n(LV; alternating 48 h with the voluntary running wheel locked and 48 h with free\naccess to the running wheel); and higher-volume exercise (HV, free running wheel\naccess daily).\nIn the first experimental setting, we sought for specific signatures in\nlocomotor activity, neurotrophic signaling, and mitochondrial neuroenergetic\ninduced by preconditioning with different volumes of physical exercise (LV and\nHV). The protocol consisted of 15 days of free access to the exercise running\nwheel (habituation) followed by intermittent (48 h locked/unlocked cycle) or\nfree unrestricted voluntary access to the running wheel for 15 additional days\n(manipulation of physical exercise volume; LV, and HV, respectively). This\nexercise regimen was adopted according to reports by Berchtold et al. which\nindicate that BDNF protein levels increase progressively with increasing days of\nrunning; however daily exercised mice reached difference from sedentary on day\n14\nth\nmeanwhile alternating days exercised mice reach difference\nfrom sedentary on day 21\nst\n(\nBerchtold\net al., 2005\n). Given this, the fifteen-day habituation phase serves\nas an adaptation to a novel environment and provides similar baseline\nhippocampal BDNF levels before starting the protocol of LV and HV exercise\nmanipulation. After thirty days, the running wheels of LV and HV exercise groups\nwere locked, and mice spent the next thirty days without physical exercise. The\nsum of distance in meters (habituation plus training) ran by mice was the\nreference parameter to confirm LV and HV exercise. Within this time frame, mice\nwere challenged in the open field arena and Morris water maze task and then were\neuthanized. The brain was dissected for analysis of neurotrophic and\nmitochondrial bioenergetic endpoints in the hippocampus. See experimental\ntimeline Figure 1A.\nIn the second experimental setting, we interrogated whether behavioral\n(locomotor activity and spatial memory) and neurochemical signatures\n(bioenergetic and neurotrophic) associated with TBI are modulated by LV and HV\nexercise and if these modulations differ according to exercise volume.\nInitially, mice were submitted to LV, or HV exercise preconditioning protocols\nas above mentioned (habituation plus training). Sedentary mice have the running\nwheel locked during the entire protocol. After thirty days of exercise,\nsedentary and exercised mice were submitted to TBI, as follows: SEDTBI, LVTBI,\nand HVTBI (all groups submitted to craniotomy and TBI) followed by thirty-days\ndetraining. See the experimental timeline in Figure 4A.\nThirty-days detraining period was an exploratory approach to sought for\nsustained BDNF increments beyond the already reported after 15 days of exercise\n(\nFiorin et al., 2016\n). Also, within\nthirty days after TBI, rodents, and patients already present detectable\nneurological deficits. Hence, interactions between early neurobiochemical\nadaptations and long-term neurofunctional abnormalities are, in our experience,\nmore predictable within thirty days post-TBI.\nAll experiments were conducted according to the NIH Guide for Care and\nUse of Laboratory Animals, the National Research Council\u2019s Guide for the\nCare and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Brazilian Society for Neuroscience and\nBehavior (SBNeC), and the official governmental guidelines in compliance with\nthe Federation of Brazilian Societies for Experimental Biology. The experiments\nwere approved by the Ethical Committee of the Federal University of Rio Grande\ndo Sul, Brazil (#22436).\n\n2.2. Controlled Cortical Impact Protocol (CCI)\nA severe TBI was performed by placing mice in a heated stereotaxic bed\n(Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA) (37 \u00b1 1\u00b0C). Inhalation\nanesthesia was provided (2.5% isoflurane) in a mixture of N\n2\nand\nO\n2\n(2:1). The anesthesia maintenance during surgical procedure\nwas confirmed through testing withdrawal reflex of feet. An eye lubricant was\napplied to protect corneal membranes during the surgical procedure. Initially, a\n4-mm diameter craniotomy was performed in the central part of the left parietal\nbone, without damaging the\ndura matter\n. Mice were subsequently\nsubmitted to a controlled cortical impact (CCI injury) induced by the Benchmark\nstereotaxic impactor (myNeuroLab\n\u00ae\n, Leica, St. Louis, MO, USA).\nThe head injury was performed with a 3.0-mm diameter piston adjusted to an\nimpact velocity of 5.7 m/s; impact duration was 100 ms and 2 mm of depth\npenetration on the exposed surface of the\ndura mater\n(\nSmith et al., 1995\n). After the injury, the\ncraniotomy area was isolated using a concave lamella bonded with dental cement\nand the scalp was sutured (\nSmith et al.,\n1995\n). Lidocaine was applied locally to alleviate pain and\ndiscomfort. All surgeries were performed by the same model expert with a\nduration ranging from 4\u20137 min to avoid experimental variation, in a\nrandom order of control and treated animals.\nAfter being removed from the stereotaxic frame, mice were left to\nrecover from surgery in a heated chamber to maintain a body core temperature of\n37\u00b0C, and were monitored up to 4 h post-injury, in which they usually\nrecover spontaneous locomotion. Mice were then returned to the home cage and\ninspections were performed daily by the researches and animal care staff to\ncheck for signals of distress, discomfort and pain including bleeding and\ninflammation at the surgical site, piloerection, lack of spontaneous activity,\nchanges in body temperature, decreased drinking water or food pellet\nconsumption, and hunched position. Mice were removed from the study and humanely\neuthanized if they presented at least one of these phenotypes (\nAndersen et al., 2016\n;\nNational Research Council, 2008\n).\nImportantly, our early experience indicates that these CCI parameters\ntranslate some of the brain tissue alterations and neurological impairment found\nin severe TBI patients (\nCarteri et al.,\n2019\n;\nSmith et al., 1995\n).\nParticularly, severe TBI affects many young individuals worldwide, and in the\nregion of this study there is a high incidence in young adult males relative to\nfemales (3:1). Furthermore, mortality rates are high, and secondary sequelae are\nvery frequent in this specific population of TBI patients (\nB\u00f6hmer et al., 2011\n;\nde Almeida et al., 2016\n;\nStefani et al., 2017\n;\nStrogulski et al., 2022\n), reinforcing the requirement of modeling\nsevere TBI outcomes to address unsolved pertinent clinical questions.\n\n2.3. Open Field Test\nOpen field (OF) was used to access spontaneous locomotion and\nexploratory activity 72 h after exercise as well as exercise + CCI protocols\n(see Figure 1A and Figure 4A, respectively). The experiments were\nconducted in a sound-attenuated room under low-intensity light (12 lx) using a\nhomemade apparatus that consisted of a black-painted box measuring 50 cm\n\u00d7 50 cm surrounded by 50 cm-high walls. The mouse was placed in the right\ncorner of the arena, and locomotor activity was recorded with a video camera for\n10 min (\nRodolphi et al., 2021\n). The\nanalysis was performed using a computer-operated tracking system (Any-maze,\nStoelting, Woods Dale, IL). The apparatus was cleaned with 70% alcohol between\neach test. The total distance traveled, distance traveled per minute, maximum\nspeed, mean speed, total mobile time, total immobile time, and time spent in\nperipheral and central zones were recorded and used as indicators of locomotor\nactivity and exploratory behavior.\n\n2.4. Preparation of Ipsilateral Hippocampal Homogenates\nWhole ipsilateral hippocampal tissue was collected thirty days after the\nsedentary, exercise, and exercise + CCI protocols. The hippocampus was\nhomogenized in a buffer (320 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) using a pre-cooled\nglass potter with 10 to 15 strokes (\nGnaiger,\n2014\n). After centrifugation (1350\nx\ng for 3 min at 4\n\u00b0C), we obtained mitochondria-enriched homogenates that were aliquoted\nfor high-resolution respirometry linked to complexes, membrane potential, and\nhydrogen peroxide analysis. These analyses were performed simultaneously by\nblinded researchers within 10 min of euthanasia to the start of the analysis.\nAliquots were also used for protein quantification (Pierce\n\u2122\nBCA Protein Assay Kit Catalog number: 23225) and immunoblotting.\n\n2.5. Western Blotting\nThe ipsilateral hippocampi samples (20 \u03bcg of protein) were used\nto perform electrophoresis using polyacrylamide gel and PVDF membranes\n(Amersham, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) (\nMuller et al., 2011\n). The following primary antibodies were used\nagainst CREB (Cell Signaling, USA ref. 9104; 1:1000),\npCREB\nSer133\n(Cell Signaling, USA, ref. 9191; 1:1000), pro-BDNF\n(Millipore, USA, ref. ab5613; 1:1000), and BDNF (Millipore, USA, ref ab1513;\n1:1000). Antibodies were incubated overnight followed by 2 h incubation with\nhorseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:5000) (GE,\nLittle Chalfont, UK) secondary antibodies. Membranes were incubated with\nAmersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences,\nLittle Chalfont, UK) for 5 min, and immunodetection used chemiluminescence via\nImage Quant LAS 4000 (GE, Little Chalfont, UK). The protein expression was\nquantified using Image J\n\u00ae\nsoftware (Rockville, USA). The\nvalues for the optical density were expressed as a percentage of the control\n(\nRodolphi et al., 2021\n).\n\n2.6. Mitochondrial Respiratory Protocol\nOxygen consumption rates (OCR) were obtained at 37\u00b0C using a\nhigh-resolution 17Oxygraphy-2k system and recorded in real-time using DatLab\nsoftware (Oroboros, Innsbruck, Austria) in respiration buffer (100 mM KCI, 75 mM\nmannitol, 25 mM sucrose, 5 mM phosphate, 0.05 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tris-HC1, pH\n7.4). After five minutes to establish routine OCR, a multi-substrate titration\nprotocol was initiated with pyruvate, malate, glutamate, and succinate (PMGS;\n10, 10, 20, and 10 mM, respectively) to obtain a functional system that\nstimulated the formation of an electrochemical gradient. Adenosine diphosphate\n(ADP, 2.5 mM) was then titrated to obtain maximal OxPHOS capacity (P). The\noligomycin was then titrated to obtain L\nomy\nOCR, and the maximal\nelectron transport capacity (ETS) was obtained following titration of the proton\nionophore carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone (FCCP 1\n\u03bcM). Non-mitochondrial respiration (ROX) was calculated after the\ninhibition of complex I, III, and IV with rotenone, antimycin-A, and cyanide\n(ROT, AA and KCN, 2, 2.5 and 5 mM, respectively) (\nGnaiger, 2014\n). The following parameters were\ncalculated based on the OCR: biochemical coupling efficiency\n((P-L\nomy\n)/P), OxPHOS phosphorylation capacity ((E-P)/E), ETS (E-ROX),\nand leak control ratio (L\nomy\n/E) (\nCarteri et al., 2019\n;\nGnaiger,\n2014\n).\n\n2.7. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (\u0394\u0470\nm\n)\nThe \u0394\u0470m was obtained via the fluorescence signal\n(excitation wavelength of 495 nm and emission wavelength of 586 nm) of the\nipsilateral hippocampal homogenates incubated in respiration buffer supplemented\nwith 10 \u03bcM safranin-\nO\n(Spectra Max M5, Molecular\nDevices). The increased fluorescence units mirror the decreased\n\u0394\u0470\nm\nwhereas decreased\nfluorescence units indicate increased\n\u0394\u0470\nm\n.\nIncubation without substrates represents the baseline\n\u0394\n\u0470\nm\n. Substrates\nfor complex I, II (PMGS), and V (ADP) as well as uncoupling with FCCP (1\n\u03bcM) was used to modulate the \u0394\u0470m dynamic responses.\nMoreover, the fluorescence units of each coupling state were used to calculate\nthe relative percentage of change in\n\u0394\n\u0470\nm\n. Data are\nexpressed as arbitrary fluorescence units (AFUs) and were normalized to protein\ncontent (\nPortela et al., 2017\n).\n\n2.8. Mitochondrial H\n2\nO\n2\nProduction\nMitochondrial hydrogen peroxide (H\n2\nO\n2\n) production\nin the ipsilateral hippocampi was assessed in different mitochondrial coupling\nstates, using samples incubated in the respiration buffer supplemented with 10\n\u03bcM Amplex Red and 2 units/mL horseradish peroxidase. Baseline state\nH\n2\nO\n2\nlevels were measured without the presence of\nexogenous substrates in the incubation medium. The L (PMGS) P, and\nL\nomy\ncoupling states were induced to assess\nH\n2\nO\n2\nproduction using the same substrates and\ninhibitors indicated in respirometry. Fluorescence was monitored at excitation\n(563 nm) and emission (587 nm) wavelengths with a Spectra Max M5 microplate\nreader (Molecular Devices, USA) (\nMuller et al.,\n2013\n;\nPortela et al.,\n2017\n).\n\n2.9. Morris Water Maze Task\nThe spatial learning and memory after CCI were assessed by the Morris\nWater Maze adapted from\nSmith et. Al.,\n1995\n, (see experimental timeline Figure\n4A). The animals (n = 10 per group) were submitted to a flag test\n(experimental day 54), and 24 h after they were trained daily in a four-trial\nMWM to find a hidden platform (experimental days 55 to 58). This was followed by\na one-day probe test on day 59 without the platform (Figure 4A). The time spent in the target quadrant was\nmeasured as an indicator of memory retention. The analysis was performed using\nAny-maze software (Stoelting, Woods Dale, IL) (\nMuller et al., 2011\n).\n\n2.10. Variable Interaction Mapping\nWe performed pairwise Pearson correlations for each continuous variable\nstudied for each experimental group. We then estimated the association between\npaired variables using the Pearson\u2019s product moment correlation\ncoefficient (\nrho\n) testing a null hypothesis of\nrho\nbeing zero. The test statistics follow a t distribution\nand confidence intervals are given based on Fisher\u2019s Z transform. These\nanalyses and associated visualizations were obtained using the\ncorrplot\n(version 0.9) and the\nstats\n(version 4.1.2) packages in R statistical environment by applying the\ncor\nand\ncor.mtest\nfunctions.\n\n2.11. Statistical Analysis\nTo calculate survival proportions, we used the product limit\n(Kaplan-Meier) method (\nMachin et al.,\n2006\n). The results were calculated and expressed as the mean \u00b1\nS.E.M. To analyze the differences between groups, we used a two-way analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) followed by a post-hoc Tukey test. Further, a two-way repeated\nmeasures ANOVA was used to assess statistical significance relative to\nminute-to-minute differences in distance travelled during the open field test.\nAll procedures were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software. The differences\nwere considered statistically significant at p < 0.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Maintenance of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)\nHuman embryonic stem cells (hESCs, W09 cell line) were purchased from WiCell Research Institute Inc (Madison, WI, USA). hESCs were maintained in mTeSR\n\u2122\n1 medium (85850, STEMCELL Technologies, MA, USA) using Matrigel-coated six-well plates (\nBD354277\n, Corning, NY, USA). The colonies were fed daily with fresh mTeSR\n\u2122\n1 medium and maintained at 37\u00b0C in humidified air with 5% CO\n2\n. hESCs were passaged every five to six days and split at the ratio of 1:3 to 1:5 for subculture. For the subculture of hESCs, cells were incubated with a gentle cell dissociation reagent (07174, STEMCELL Technologies, MA, USA) for 5 min and manually scraped using a 5 ml pipette to generate cell aggregates. The aggregates were collected and centrifuged. After removing the supernatant, cells were resuspended in fresh mTeSR\n\u2122\n1 medium and replated onto Matrigel\n\u2212\ncoated six-well plates.\n\n2.2. Generation of forebrain organoids from hESCs\nThe generation of forebrain organoids was performed as described by Qian et al. (\nQian et al. 2018\n;\nQian et al. 2016\n) with modifications. On day 0, hESCs were dissociated with a gentle cell dissociation reagent (07174, STEMCELL Technologies, MA, USA) to generate single cells. The cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5 min. and then resuspended in fresh embryoid bodies (EBs) formation medium [DMEM/F12, 20% KnockOut Serum Replacement (10828028, KOSR, Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA), 1\u00d7 GlutaMAX (35050061, Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA), 1\u00d7MEM-NEAA (MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids Solution, 11140050, Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA), 1\u00d72-Mercaptoethanol (\u03b2-ME, O3446I Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), 1\u00d7Penicillin/Streptomycin (15140122, Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA) plus 2 \u03bcM Dorsomorphin (P5499, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) and 2 \u03bcM A 83\u201301 (2939, Tocris Bioscience, MN, USA) and 10 \u03bcM Y-27632 (72234, STEMCELL Technologies, MA, USA)]. 9,000 cells were plated into each well of Ultra-low attachment 96 well microplate (89089\u2013826, VWR, GA, USA) in 100 \u03bcl EBs formation medium. After 48 hrs, half of the medium from each well was replaced with fresh EBs formation medium without Y-27632. On day 5 \u2013 6, half of the medium was replaced with a freshly prepared neural induction medium consisting of DMEM: F12, 1\u00d7 N2 Supplement (17502048, Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA), 10 \u03bcg/ml Heparin (375095, Sigma, CA, USA), 1\u00d7 Penicillin/Streptomycin (15140122, Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA), 1\u00d7 Non-essential Amino Acids (11140\u2013050, Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA), 1\u00d7 Glutamax (10565\u2013042, Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA), 4 ng/ml WNT-3A (5036-WN-010, R&D Systems, MN, USA), 1 \u03bcM CHIR99021 (72054, STEMCELL Technologies, MA, USA), and 1 \u03bcM SB-431542 (1614, Tocris Bioscience, MN, USA). On day 7, organoids were embedded in Matrigel (354234, Corning\n\u2122\n, NY, USA) and cultured for additional 6 days. On day 14, 10 \u2013 20 matrigel embedded organoids were transferred to each well of a 12-well spinning bioreactor (Spin\u03a9) containing the differentiation medium consisting of DMEM: F12, 1\u00d7 N2 and B27 supplements plus vitamin A (17504044, Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA), 1\u00d7 Penicillin/Streptomycin, 1\u00d7 2-Mercaptoenthanol, 1\u00d7 Non-essential Amino Acids, 2.5 \u03bcg/ml Insulin (I0516, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA).

Some organoids were cultured in the maturation medium until day 84. All media were changed every other day.\n\n2.3. Ethanol treatment\nFor ethanol treatment, forebrain organoids on day14 were exposed to 50 mM ethanol for 24 hrs. For the assessment of the short-term effects of ethanol, the organoids were collected immediately following the ethanol exposure, washed three times with 1\u00d7 cold Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), and fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1\u00d7 DPBS buffer for further analysis. For the assessment of the long-term effects of ethanol, the forebrain organoids from the same ethanol-exposed batch were washed three times with a freshly prepared organoid differentiation medium and then transferred into Spin\u03a9 bioreactors for cultures in the organoid differentiation medium or maturation medium. Samples were collected at indicated time points for analysis.\n\n2.4. Tissue preparation and immunostaining\nForebrain organoids collected at indicated time points were washed three times with 1\u00d7 cold Dulbecco\u2019s DPBS, then fixed in 4% PFA in DBPS overnight at 4\u00b0C. Then organoids were washed with 1\u00d7 DPBS three times and incubated overnight in a 30% sucrose-DPBS solution. After sedimentation, organoids were embedded in Tissue-Tek\n\u00ae\nOCT Compound (27050, Ted Pella, Inc.CA, U.S.A.), frozen at \u221220\u00b0C, sectioned at 20 \u03bcm with a cryostat (Leica CM3050S, Leica Microsystems Inc, IL, USA), and collected onto Superfrost Plus slides (22\u2013037-246, Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). For immunohistochemistry, sections were blocked and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 and 10% donkey and goat serum in 1\u00d7 DPBS. Sections were then incubated with the following primary antibodies, respectively, in 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% donkey and goat serum: rabbit anti-SOX2 (1:200, 23064, Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA), mouse anti-TUJ1 (1:200, MMS-435P, Covance, NJ, USA), mouse anti-PAX6 (1:200, MA1\u2013109, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), mouse anti-Nestin (1:200, MA1\u2013110, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), rabbit anti-Nestin (1:200, ab92391, Abcam, MA, USA), rabbit anti-TBR2 (1:200, AB9618, Abcam, MA, USA), rat anti-CTIP2 (1:100, ab18465, Abcam, MA, USA), rabbit anti-\u03b2-Catenin (1:200, 9562, Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA), mouse anti-PKC\u03bb (1:200, 610207, BD Biosciences, CA, USA), rabbit anti-Hopx (1:200, 230544, Abcam, MA, USA), mouse anti-Hop (E-1) (HOPX, 1:200, sc-398703, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), mouse anti-S100\u03b2 (1:200, S2532, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA), mouse anti-Ki-67 (1:200, MAB4190, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA), rabbit anti-cleaved Caspase-3 (1:200, 9661, Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA), mouse anti-GFAP (1:200, G3893, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA). The sections were then incubated with the following secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488, 594, or 647 -conjugated donkey anti-goat, -rabbit, -rat, or -mouse IgG (all used at 1:200 dilution, Invitrogen, CA, USA), respectively. Nuclei were stained by incubating the sections with 4\u2019,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, 1:2000, CAS28718\u201390-3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) in 1\u00d7 DPBS for 10 min. After three washes with 1\u00d7 DPBS, sections were mounted in anti-fade fluorescence mounting medium (ab104135, Abcam, MA, USA) and sealed by coverGrip\n\u2122\ncoverslip sealant (Biotium, 23005). Images were captured by a Nikon A1R laser scanning confocal microscope (NY, USA) and analyzed by ImageJ 1.6.0 (NIH, USA).\n\n2.5. BrdU pulse-chase labeling analysis\nFor BrdU (5-bromo-2\u2019-deoxyuridine) pulse-chase labeling analysis, forebrain organoids from control and ethanol-treated groups were incubated with 10 \u03bcM BrdU (ab142567, Abcam, CA, USA) diluted with the forebrain organoid induction medium for 2 h. The organoid differentiation medium containing BrdU was removed, and forebrain organoids were washed three times with a fresh differentiation medium and then cultured in a fresh differentiation medium. The forebrain organoids were collected on days 2 or 7, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected by 30% sucrose-PBS solution overnight, and embedded in OCT Compound (Sakura Finetek, CA, USA). Frozen sections were cut into 15 \u03bcm, and BrdU labeling was detected by double immunostaining using the mouse anti-BrdU antibody (ab8152, Abcam, CA, USA) and rabbit anti-Nestin antibody (1:200, ab92391, Abcam, CA, USA) or rabbit anti-HOPX antibody (PA5\u201372855, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA USA) as described above.\n\n2.6. EdU cell proliferation assay\nForebrain organoids were cultured in the differentiation medium containing 10 \u03bcM 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (EdU) with or without 50 mM ethanol for 24 hrs. After the forebrain organoids were washed with the fresh differentiation medium, forebrain organoids were cultured in the fresh differentiation medium until day 56 for analysis of the birth dating of outer radial glial cells. EdU was detected by using Click-iT\n\u2122\nPlus EdU Alexa Fluor\n\u2122\nImaging Kit (\nC10339\n, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For the analysis of birthdated HOPX\n+\nouter radial glial cells from EdU\n+\nradial glial cells, the immunostaining of HOPX was performed using mouse anti-Hop (E-1) antibody (HOPX, 1:200, sc-398703, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA). DAPI (1:2000, CAS28718\u201390-3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) was used to stain nuclei to determine the total cells.\n\n2.7. Statistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed by using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). At least five forebrain organoids were included in each group. All experiments were replicated 3\u2013 5 times. All data were expressed as means \u00b1 SEM of at least three separate experiments. Student\u2019s t-test was used to compare the difference between groups. Differences between groups were considered significant at\np\n< 0.05,\np\n< 0.01 or\np\n< 0.001."

    "Methods": "2.1. Patient CSF, dura and blood Collection\nCSF was obtained from 8 consecutive adult TBI patients on 2\u20133 days of hospital admission and 6 normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) patients requiring CSF diversion in the Department of Neurosurgery at the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University. NPH patients served as an ideal control population for CSF as these patients exhibit significant edema without a traumatic event. Blood from 7 TBI patients and 9 healthy individuals (Control) served for plasma endocannabinoid analysis. In addition, discarded dura were collected from hemicraniectomy procedure from seven TBI patients. Patient specimens were collected from adults (age 17\u201383) without regard for age, race, gender, or socioeconomic status. All studies were approved by The Institutional Review Board at Augusta University (Formerly Georgia Regents University) [No. 1361000\u20131; 933254\u20138; 1344380\u20133]. All samples were de-identified and coded by the attending physician prior to transport to the laboratory.\n\n2.2. Animals\nThis study was conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication No. 85\u201323) and was approved by the Committee on Animal Use for Research and Education at Augusta University [No. 2021\u20131046 and 2017\u20130838]. Mixed sex CD1 or C57Bl/6J mice (5\u20136 months old) were housed under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle at 23 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. Food and water were provided\nad libitum\n.\n\n2.3. Controlled cortical impact (CCI)\nMice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2%) and subjected to a sham injury or CCI as detailed previously by our laboratory\n1\n,\n40\n\u2013\n42\n. Mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame and a 3.5-mm craniotomy was made in the right parietal bone midway between the lambda and the bregma with the medial edge 1-mm lateral from the midline, leaving the dura intact. Mice were impacted at 3 m/s with a 85 ms dwell time and 3 mm depression using a 3 mm diameter convex tip (PinPoint PCI3000 Precision Cortical Impactor, Hatteras Instruments, Cary, NC), mimicking a moderate to severe TBI. Craniotomy was sealed with bone wax, skin incision was surgically sutured, and mice were returned into a clean warm cage until recovered. Sham-operated mice received similar procedures but no impact. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C using a small animal temperature controller throughout all procedures (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA). Moderate to severe TBI had a mortality rate of about 15%. Any TBI mouse that died before the terminal end-point in the study was removed from the longitudinal analysis.\n\n2.4. Behavioral tests\n2.4.1. Habituation\nFor behavioral tasks, mice were habituated for thirty minutes in the room and training/testing were done under identical lighting conditions at the same time each day. All behavioral chambers were cleaned with 70% ethanol cleaning solution before and after use.\n2.4.2. Assessment of motor coordination by Rota-rod and narrow beam walk\nMotor coordination was assessed using a rotarod (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). Mice were trained to run on rotarod prior to injury, which started moving at a speed of 4 rpm and accelerated to 30 rpm in 4 min. On test day, mice were tested on the rotarod for the length of time each animal maintained balance while walking on top of the drum. Trials were ended when the animal either fell off the rod or clung to the rod as it made one complete rotation.\n43\nMotor coordination also was evaluated on stationary narrow beam (6 mm wide and 1 m long) over 3 consecutive days: 2 days of training prior to injury and 1 day of testing. The time required to traverse the beam was quantified in addition to the number of foot faults.\n44\nEach mouse was tested three-times and the average was recorded. All behavioral analyses were done blindly with regard to injury/sham control.\n2.4.3. Open field and Novel object recognition test\nMice were tested in a square box (40 cm \u00d7 40 cmx 40 cm) for 10 min and activities were recorded by camera. The activities (time spent in center zone and latency to first entry to center zone) were recorded and analyzed with the software \u201cEthovision XT\u201d (Noldus Information Technology, Asheville, NC, USA)\n45\n. The results were presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. The time point studies for open field and Novel object recognition tests followed by MRI were performed by Anymaze (Stoelting Co.) and were analyzed by Anymaze video tracking software as described by Lu et al.\n46\n\n2.5. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)\nPerimed LSCI was used to image cerebral perfusion and record CBF at days 1, 3 and 21 post-TBI/sham surgery. LSCI is a fast, calibrated and reliable technique that others and we have been using to determine blood flow in the brain and other organs.\n35\n,\n47\n\u2013\n50\nThe brain illuminated with laser light, backscatters light as an interference pattern of bright and dark areas (called as speckle pattern). This pattern depends on blood cells movement, and the level of change in this pattern because of blood flow/blood cells motion is quantified as the local speckle contrast by the LSCI.\nTo calculate CBF, mouse was anesthetized, and a midline incision was made to expose the skull. The skull then was cleaned with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and non-toxic silicone oil was applied to improve imaging quality. Body temperature was maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C. Cerebral perfusion was calculated in regions of interest (ROIs) located between bregma and lambda in each hemisphere using a Perimed PSI system with a 70 mW built-in laser diode for illumination and 1388 \u00d7 1038 pixels CCD camera installed 10 cm above the skull (speed 19 Hz, and exposure time 6 ms). Acquired high-resolution images were analyzed for changes in CBF (cerebral perfusion) using vendor supplied PIMSoft software and presented as mean perfusion values.\n51\n\n2.6. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition and image processing\nNa\u00efve mice underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination at baseline to make sure there is no underlying pathology. Same mice were reimaged again at 3 days and 24 days post-TBI. Each mouse was anesthetized with isoflurane inhalation (induction 3%; maintenance 1.5\u20132.0%) in 100% O2 gas and secured within a stereotaxic frame within the dedicated animal holder. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C by warm water circulated in a heating cradle and respiration monitored during the procedure using a physiological monitoring system (SAI, New Jersey, USA). Imaging was done on a 7T/20 small-bore animal scanner (Bruker Biospec, Ettlingen, Germany) at the Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia. Two actively decoupled radio frequency (RF) coils were used: a volume coil of 8.4 cm diameter used as the transmitter and a four-channel mouse phase array surface coil as the receiver.\nData Acquisition and analysis:\nThe full MRI battery scan time was approximately 1-hour and included weighted, scalar images and data for quantitative mapping as listed below. Given the importance of timing between TBI and MRI measurements made at day 3, the scan order within the battery was identical across all animals and time points. Two-dimensional multi-slice T2-weighted RARE images were collected with TE = 35 ms and TR = 5000 ms for visualization of T2-weighted contrast. For T2-mapping, a two-dimensional multi-slice multi-echo images were collected with TE = 10/20/30/\u2026\u2026\u2026..150 ms and TR = 3600ms. For T2 mapping, in house Matlab code were used to read in the multi-echo data and to perform fitting of the Carr-Purcell Meibloom Gill (CPMG) equation to determine T2 values at each voxel within the brain volume. Three-dimensional T1-weighted MDEFT (T1W-MDEFT) MRI scans were acquired with TE/TR = 3.5/3000 ms and IR = 1100 ms. T2 -weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) was collected using a 2D RARE pulse sequence with TE = 22 ms, TR = 10 s, and IR = 2500 ms. Three-dimensional T2* weighted MRI scans were collected using a multi-gradient echo pulse sequence with TE = 3.5/7.5/10.5/14 ms and TR = 600 ms were collected and the maps averaged across all echoes and visualized to determine the presence and conspicuity of blood products in the parenchyma expected to result from micro hemorrhages. The resultant files were analyzed for edema and ventricular volume with the help of NIH ImageJ software.\n\n2.7. Tissue collection\nAt terminal time points, mice were deeply anesthetizing with isoflurane (5%). Deeply anesthetized mice were perfused with 30 mL of ice-cold phosphate buffered saline, and brains were carefully removed. A 3-mm coronal brain section centered on the contusion was prepared using an acrylic brain matrix, and cerebral cortices were collected for analysis, as detailed below. For histological and immunohistochemical analysis, brains were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde.\n\n2.8. Immunostaining and Quantification\nCoronal sections (5 \u03bcm thick) of mouse brains were obtained from the paraffin embedded tissue blocks, deparaffinized with xylene and alcohol gradients and stained with standardized procedure for immunostaining as reported previously\n52\n. Deparaffinized sections after standard preparatory procedures and antigen retrieval were incubated with anti-CB2-AF488 (1:100; Bioss); anti-CB1-AF594(1:100; Bioss Inc.); anti-TRPV1-AF647 (1:100; Novus Biologicals); anti-Iba1 (1: 500; Abcam); anti-MAGL(1:100; Bioss Inc.); anti-FAAH (1:100; Bioss Inc.); anti-Aqp4 (1:100; Santacruz Biotech) and anti-GFAP (1:500; Thermo Fisher) overnight at 4 \u00b0 C followed by incubation with an appropriate fluorescent secondary antibody (1:500; Jackson Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 hour. The sections were mounted with Vectamount permanent mounting media (Vector Laboratories, CA). Dura was embedded in OCT and sectioned at 20 um thickness. Dura sections were stained for Iba1, Aqp4, FAAH, Cox-2 and MAGL. Images were captured by Thermo Fisher EVOS M7000 inverted microscope and analyzed by NIH ImageJ software. The expressing cells were quantified for mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) at five discrete areas of ipsilateral cortex or CP in each group with the help of the imageJ software and repeated five times to quantify the expression of proteins (magnification \u00d7 200). Briefly, the images were converted into 16 bit images and threshold were set between 41 and 162 for all dura images. For mice brain images, threshold was set between 39\u2013196 (Iba1/Aqp4/GFAP), 31\u2013196 (CB1/CB2/TRPV1) and 44\u2013190 (Cox-2/FAAH/MAGL). As a result stained area show as white (255 value), while background becomes black (0 value).\n\n2.9. Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay\nEndocannabinoids (2-AG and AEA) levels in CSF or plasma were determined by competitive inhibition enzyme immunoassay kits (Cat# CEO443Ge and CEO440Ge respectively; Cloud-Clone Corp, Katy, Tx) as described by manufacturer. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) content in CSF/plasma was determined by commercial competitive inhibition enzyme immunoassay kit (cat#KGE004B; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).\n\n2.10. Preparative and analytical flow cytometry\nFreshly collected dura tissue was sieved through a cell strainer, followed by centrifugation (1,500 rpm, 5 min) to prepare single-cell suspensions. Cells were incubated with antibodies against cannabinoid markers CB1, CB2 (Bioss Inc.), and TRPV1 (Novus Biologicals Ltd.). Following a PBS wash, cells were fixed and permeabilized using a Fixation/Permeabilization Concentrate (Biolegend, CA, USA), and then incubated with antibodies for intracellular labeling of MAGL, FAAH (Purchased from Bioss Inc.), and Cox-2 (Abcam). After a final wash, cells were analyzed using a 4-color flow cytometer (Acea 4-laser NovoCyte Quanteon, Agilent technologies lnc., USA), and analyzed using FCSexpress\n\u2122\nsoftware (De novo software, CA, USA), as described previously (Baban et al., 2005; Baban et al., 2013). Isotype-matched controls were analyzed to set the appropriate gates for each sample. For each marker, samples were analyzed in duplicate. To minimize false-positive events, the number of double-positive events detected with the isotype controls was subtracted from the number of double-positive cells stained with corresponding antibodies (not isotype control), respectively. Cells expressing a specific marker were reported as a percentage of the number of gated events.\n\n2.11. Statistical Analysis\nTwo group comparisons were made using a two-tailed t-test followed by Mann-Whitney U computation. Multi-group comparisons were made using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. Results were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. A p \u2264 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant."

    "Methods": "All materials were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) unless stated otherwise.\n\nAnimal care and use\nCommercially-available male and female BALB/cJ mice (JAX #:000651; referred to hereafter as wild-type (WT) were purchased for experiments, while C.129S1(B6)-\nGata1\ntm6Sho\n/J (JAX #:005653 on the BALB/cJ background; referred to hereafter as Gata1 KO (\nYu et al., 2002\n)) were bred and used at 8 to 12 weeks old (20-25g, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). All animals were housed in a central animal care facility and provided with free access to food (PicoLab rodent diet 20, Purina Mills Nutrition International, St. Louis, MO) and water. Surgical procedures and peri-operative care measures were conducted in compliance with the AAALAC accredited Washington University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the National Institutes of Health guidelines.\n\nExperimental Design\nThe studies were carried out in independent sets of mice with multiple endpoints. WT and Gata1 KO mice were randomized to experimental endpoints, where all mice received a unilateral sciatic nerve injury and repair with a 6 mm nerve conduit (to generate a 3 mm gap). Mice were distributed to endpoints for: immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of the nerve gap region 3 weeks after repair (n=8/group/endpoint), gene analysis of the nerve gap region 3 and 4 weeks after repair (n=5/group/endpoint), retrograde tracing of neurons regenerating axons across the nerve gap at 4 weeks after repair (n=10/group), and serial bi-monthly functional assessment (behavior) followed by retrograde tracing of neurons regenerating axons across the nerve gap at 16 weeks after repair (n=10/group). For the nerve gap repair, medical grade silicone tubing (VWR, Hudson, MA) (0.032\u201d inside diameter x 0.009\u201d wall thickness) was cut into 6 mm segments to serve as nerve conduits and autoclaved. At the time of implant, the tubes were rinsed with sterile saline solution.\n\nSurgical procedures\nFor surgical procedures, mice were anesthetized using a cocktail of ketamine (100 mg/kg; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) and dexmedetomidine (0.5 mg/kg; Pfizer Animal Health, Exton, PA). Surgical procedures were performed using aseptic conditions with the aid of an operating microscope (JEDMED/KAPS, St. Louis, MO). The right hindquarter was shaved and prepped using betadine and ethanol, and then the skin chemically dilapidated. Under 10-25x magnification using sterilized micro-instruments, the right sciatic nerve was exposed and transected proximal to the trifurcation of the sciatic nerve. A 6 mm conduit was sutured to the transected proximal and distal stumps, incorporating 1.5 mm of nerve on either end (resulting in a 3 mm gap). Two 9-0 nylon mattress microepineurial sutures were used to secure the conduit at each end. Then, a two-layered closure of muscle and skin was performed using 6-0 vicryl for muscle and surgical staples for skin. Atipamezole solution (0.1mg/kg; Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ) was administered for anesthesia reversal. The animals were recovered on a warming pad and monitored for postoperative complications before returning them to a central animal care facility. Postoperative pain was managed using Buprenorphine SR\n\u2122\n(0.05 mg/kg; ZooPharm, Windsor, CO). Animals were monitored daily post-operatively for signs of infection and/or distress. At endpoints, animals were euthanized via intraperitoneal administered pentobarbital (150 mg/kg), and tissues collected for respective studies.\n\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) of nerve tissues\nTo assess cell populations within DRG or peripheral nerves, the tissue were explanted at described endpoints post-injury and immediately placed in 4% PFA for 6 hours followed by immersion in 30% sucrose in PBS solution for 48 hours. Samples were then frozen in OCT Compound (VWR, Radnor, PA) and sectioned at 15 \u03bcm onto pretreated charged glass slides. All nerve samples were sectioned longitudinally. Sections were rehydrated with PBS and blocked using 5% BSA diluted with 0.1% triton in PBS for 1 hour before primary antibody staining. Primary antibodies (\nSupplemental Table 1\n) in 5% BSA buffer was applied and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were then washed in PBS and stained for the appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (\nSupplemental Table 1\n) for 1 h at room temperature. All sections were mounted with Fluoroshield mounting medium with DAPI (Abcam, Boston, MA) and then imaged using the Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope and acquisition system (Olympus, Waltham, MA) at overall 200x (20x water immersion objective) or 600x (60x oil immersion objective). At least three images per section were imaged for analysis. For eosinophils (Siglec F), T cells (CD3), macrophage (CD68) and M2 macrophage (CD206 & CD68), cells were counted and reflected of total cells (DAPI). For cell counts, field size was kept standard at a 60x objective (600x magnification overall), and co-localization of the primary marker(s) with DAPI was considered a positive cell. Data reported for cell counts was reflected as % cells, where cells co-localized with the marker(s) of interest was expressed as proportion of all DAPI+ cells or macrophage (CD68) in the standardized field.\n\nGene analysis (qRT-PCR) of regenerated nerve gap\nTo quantify gene expression from the regenerated nerve gap, total RNA was prepared from tissue harvested from the nerve gap explant. RNA was extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies), chloroform and a RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cDNA was generated with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Real-time PCR was performed using a Step One Plus thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using Taqman Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) reagents with specific oligonucleotide primer pairs (\nSupplemental Table 2\n). The expression levels of genes were normalized to\nActb\n. Data were analyzed using Step One Software v2.2.2 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).\n\nRetrograde labeling of motor and sensory neurons\nTo assess motor and sensory axon regeneration across the nerve gap, mice underwent retrograde labeling. Briefly, the nerve ~2 mm distal to the repair site was transected to expose the axoplasm and placed in a silicone gel (Tyco, Mansfield, MA) well to isolate it. The well was filled with 4% Fluoro-Gold in 0.9% saline to immerse the nerve and allow for tracer uptake for 60 mins. The dye was then removed, wound irrigated with saline, and the incision closed in 2 layers as before. After 7 days, the animals were euthanized, and the lumbar region of the spinal cord, and L4 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) was removed and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After 24 hours, tissues were then placed in 30% sucrose until frozen in OCT Compound (VWR) and cut into 15 \u03bcm (DRG) or 30 \u03bcm (Spinal cord) thick longitudinal sections on a cryostat (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL). DRG was then additionally stained for NeuN and NF200 using immunohistochemistry methods as just described. Images were captured using an Olympus IX81 microscope with CCD camera and appropriate fluorescent filters. For spinal cord motoneuron counts, the entire spinal cord was sectioned and quantified to obtain the total number of motoneurons per animal and reported. For DRG, counting all sensory neurons was not possible.\nTherefore, the proportion of neurons traced was quantified. At least 5 sections per DRG were imaged and sensory neurons (NeuN) were counted. Using NeuN, co-localization with NF200 was used to indicate myelinated sensory neurons, as previously performed (\nZhou et al., 2021\n), while co-localization with Fluorogold indicated a\nretrograde-traced\nsensory neuron. Data reported for cell counts were reflected as the proportion of Fluorogold labeled NeuN (neuron), where cells co-localized with the marker(s) of interest were expressed as proportion of those cell populations and averaged across sections for a given animal.\n\nGrid walk assessment\nPrior to surgery and measured every 2 weeks after injury and repair until the 16-week endpoint, mice underwent a grid walk assessment for functional recovery. Mice were placed on an elevated mesh or grid with a grid size measuring 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm. After mice acclimated to the grid for at least 5 mins, they were recorded with a video camera for at least 5 minutes moving upon the grid. From the video considering the injured limb, the total number of steps with that foot and steps that resulted in a foot placement missing the mesh and going through the grid (slipped steps) was measured. Foot fault was calculated as the proportion of slipped steps to total steps. Baseline foot fault is nearly no foot faults, while an increase in foot faults indicates inferior function.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism V8. Each animal was considered an \u2018n\u2019 value. All data were compiled as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Data were tested for normality using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Student\u2019s t test was performed for analysis between 2 groups. Data for grid-walk assessment were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple-comparisons test for post-hoc analysis between time points (repeated measures) within each group. Parametric tests were used for all statistical analysis. A significance level of p<0.05 was used in all statistical tests performed."

    "Methods": "Mice\nAll animal procedures were performed in accordance with the policies of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Wright State University and were conducted in accordance with the United States Public Health Service\u2019s Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The genetic mouse model of myotonia congenita used was\nClcn1\nadr-mto\n/J (ClC\nadr\n) mice, which have a homozygous null mutation in the\nClcn1\ngene (Jackson Labs cat #000939) and were used to model Becker\u2019s disease. In the pharmacologic model, muscle was treated with 100 \u03bcM 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid (9-AC) ex vivo, which causes a greater than 90% reduction in Cl\n\u2212\nconductance (\nPalade and Barchi, 1977\n).\nMice expressing GCAMP6f (\nChen, et al., 2013\n) in skeletal muscle were generated by crossing floxed GCAMP6f mice (Jackson Labs, B6J.Cg-\nGt(ROSA)26Sortm95.1(CAG-GCaMP6f)Hze\n/MwarJ, cat #028865) with mice expressing parvalbumin promoter driven Cre (Jackson Labs, B6.129P2-Pvalbtm1(cre)Arbr/J, cat# 030218). These mice were either treated with 9AC or crossed with ClC\nadr\nmice for two generations to obtain mice expressing GCAMP6f, which were also homozygous for knockout of ClC-1 chloride channels.\nGenotyping of ClC\nadr\nmice was performed as previously described to select heterozygous mice for breeding (\nDupont, et al., 2019\n). Otherwise, homozygous myotonic mice were identified by appearance and behavior as previously described (\nNovak, et al., 2015\n). Both male and female mice were used from 2 months to 6 months of age. As mice with myotonia have difficulty climbing to reach food, symptomatic mice were supplied with moistened chow paste (Irradiated Rodent Diet; Harlan Teklad 2918) on the floor of the cage.\nMice were sacrificed using CO\n2\ninhalation followed by cervical dislocation.\n\nForce recording\nAll experiments were performed on EDL muscles at 21\u201323\u00b0C within 4 hours of sacrifice. The\nextensor digitorum longus\n(EDL) muscle was dissected, placed in a custom recording chamber and perfused with Ringer solution containing (in mM): 118 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 1.5 CaCl\n2\n, 0.7 MgSO\n4\n, 26.2 NaHCO\n3\n, 1.7 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, with 5.5 glucose and maintained at pH 7.3\u20137.4 by aeration with 95% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\n. The proximal tendon was tied with a 6\u20130 caliber silk suture to a bar and the distal tendon was tied to a hook and attached to a force transducer (Aurora Scientific). The EDL was stimulated with two platinum electrodes placed parallel to the muscle in the bath. Optimal length was determined by adjusting the tension of the muscle until maximal twitch force was achieved. To induce myotonia, the EDL was stimulated with 40 pulses of 1 ms duration delivered at 100 Hz. Force was recorded using a CED 1401 A to D board using Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design Limited). No filtering was applied to the signal.\n\nIntracellular recording\nThe same solution used for force recording was perfused into the bath. For experiments in which Ca\n2+\nimaging and intracellular recording were performed, contraction was prevented by loading muscles with 50\u03bcM BTS (N-benzyl-p-toluenesulfonamide, Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan, catalogue #B3082) dissolved in DMSO for 45 minutes prior to recording. Muscle fibers were impaled with 2 sharp microelectrodes filled with 3 M KCl solution containing 1 mM sulforhodamine 101 (Sigma-Aldrich, Catalogue #S7635) to allow for visualization. Electrode resistances were between 10 and 30 M\u2126, and capacitance compensation was optimized prior to recording. Action potentials were evoked by a 0.2 ms injection of current ranging from 100 to 1000 nA. Fibers with resting potentials more depolarized than \u221274 mV were discarded. Sampling frequency was 50 kHz with a 5 kHz low pass filter.\n\nImaging of \u0394F/F\nMuscle expressing GCAMP6f was imaged with a 40x objective without staining (Leica I3 cube, band pass 450\u2013490, long pass 515) as previously described (\nWang, et al., 2022\n). Imaging was synchronized with triggering of action potentials using a Master-8 pulse generator (A.M.P.I., Jerusalem). Frames were acquired at 30 frames per second with a sCMOS camera (CS2100M-USB) using ThorCam software (Thorlab Inc. NJ). Images were analyzed using Image J (NIH) using the average of several regions of interest along the length of the stimulated fiber. Background was subtracted using the average of several regions of interest on a neighboring fiber, which was not stimulated.\nTo confirm that the sampling rate of 30 Hz was not missing an early peak in Ca\n2+\nsignal, we imaged a subset of fibers using a photomultiplier tube (Thorlab Inc. NJ) with a sampling rate of 5 kHz. The fluorescence signal 33 ms after triggering the AP averaged 96.2 \u00b1 0.8% of the peak signal, measured using the photomultiplier tube (which occurred at 44.3 \u00b1 3.2 ms (n = 9 muscles)). These data suggest the sampling frequency of 30 Hz introduced a slight underestimation of the peak \u0394F/F.\nTo compare \u0394F/F between fibers, the signal for each fiber was normalized to the peak signal in that fiber. The peak signal usually occurred during a myotonic discharge, but could also occur during the early phase of a plateau potential. To determine the \u0394F/F sufficient to trigger contraction, the peak \u0394F/F following a single action potential was normalized to the maximal signal during a myotonic discharge/plateau potential for that fiber. Only fibers with Ca\n2+\nsignal measurement following both a single action potential and a myotonic discharge/plateau potential were analyzed.\n\nStatistics\nFor comparisons of whole muscle force or Ca\n2+\n, a student\u2019s t-test was performed. For comparisons of data collected from individual fibers, nested analysis of variance was performed with n as the number of muscles studied. All data is presented as mean \u00b1 SD.\np\n< 0.05 was considered to be significant."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nAdult male and female C57BL/6 mice (25 to 35g) were used in this study. Mice were group housed, with a maximum of 5 mice per cage, with access to food and water ad libitum. The mice were housed in an environmentally controlled animal facility with a 12-hr light/dark cycle. Animals were cared for in strict compliance with the guidelines outlined in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All animal procedures were performed in a protocol approved by the university\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Sex differences have been noted both within epilepsy disorders and the efficacy of pharmacological agents for protection against spontaneous recurrent seizures (\nReddy, 2014b\n;\nReddy, 2017a\n). To investigate the therapeutic potential of cannabidiol in psychomotor seizures, we used both male and female mice in the 6-Hz model of focal epilepsy.\n\n2.2. 6-Hz Seizure Model\nThe 6-Hz mouse model of focal onset seizures was used as previously described (\nBarton et al., 2001\n;\nReddy et al., 2015\n). Mice were electrically stimulated via cornea for 0.2-millisecond-duration monopolar low-frequency rectangular pulses at 6-Hz for 3 seconds (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Although the 6-Hz model of focal onset seizures is a well-established design, there is some inconsistency between laboratories in the current intensity needed to consistently elicit seizures, likely due to differences in equipment, environment, technique, or strain of mice (\nChuang and Reddy, 2020\n;\nBarton et al., 2001\n;\nKlein et al., 2017\n). Therefore, we conducted a stimulation-response study to determine the current value for our isobolographic experiments (see\nTable 1\n). The current value which causes seizures in 50% of animals was determined by administering increasing current intensities in the range of 10 \u2013 45 mA to a group of control mice. The current intensity of 38 mA was determined to elicit seizures in 100% of the male and female mice population and therefore was delivered as the standardized intensity for the in vivo 6 Hz studies. The ocular anesthetic tetracaine (0.5%) drops were applied to each eye 10 min before stimulation, and the corneal electrodes were wetted with 0.9% sterile saline solution immediately prior to stimulation. Animals were manually restrained for stimulation and immediately released into a chamber (28 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 15 cm) for behavioral observation. The duration of seizure activity ranged from 5 to 60 seconds in vehicle-treated mice. Seizures were scored immediately by direct observation by an investigator according to the Racine Scale. Signs of seizures include stunned posture and eye blinking, head nodding, Straub tail, and repetitive rhythmic movements (stereotypies) such as chewing, forelimb and/or hindlimb clonus, rearing, falling, running, and jumping. Cannabidiol was administered 1 hr before stimulation unless otherwise noted. Test drugs such as ganaxolone (GX) or midazolam (MDZ) were administered 15 minutes before stimulation. Animals were considered protected if they failed to display any signs of seizures and resumed their normal exploratory behavior within 10s of the start of stimulation. Ten to thirteen animals were used for each dose of treatment. Each mouse was allowed at least one whole week between tests to \u201cwash out\u201d any investigational compound after drug testing.\nTable 1:\n6-Hz Current intensity stimulation-response in mice.\nCurrent Intensity (mA)\nResponding Mice (\nn\n)\n% Responding\n10\n0/16\n0\n15\n0/16\n0\n20\n1/16\n6.25\n25\n3/16\n18.75\n30\n9/16\n56.25\n32.5\n11/16\n68.75\n35\n15/16\n93.75\n37.5\n16/16\n100\n40\n16/16\n100\n42.5\n16/16\n100\n45\n16/16\n100\nOpen in a new tab\n\n2.3. Recording and analysis 6-Hz-induced EEG seizure activity\nIn addition to scoring behavioral seizures, EEG (Electroencephalography) signals were also recorded to visualize electrographic activity and power spectral density. Electrodes were implanted in a subset of each cohort (\nn\n=6) using a previously described protocol, modified for this study (\nGolub and Reddy, 2022\n; Reddy and\nGolub et al., 2022a\n). The animals were uninjured, implanted with hippocampal depth and cortical electrodes, and corneal stimulated. Mice were placed in cages without cover to allow cable connection between headset and preamplifiers. The electrographic activity was recorded from the hippocampus and cortical electrode for 3 minutes with a Grass CP511 preamplifier (Astro-Med, West Warwick, RI), digitized and stored using Axoscope 8.1 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Synchronous EEG patterns with at least a 200 % increase in amplitude over baseline were characterized as epileptiform activity (\nGolub and Reddy, 2022\n). Power spectral density (PSD) analysis was performed employing the \u201cpspectrum\u201d function (\nWelch, 1967\n) from the Signal processing toolbox for MATLAB (version 7.10; MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA), with 1-Hz frequency resolution and computed on 10-s epochs for delta (1\u20134 Hz), theta (5\u20137 Hz), alpha (8\u201311 Hz), sigma (12\u201315 Hz), beta (16\u201320 Hz), and lower gamma (24\u201360) bands.\n\n2.4. Motor toxicity test\nCBD was evaluated for motor toxicity using a modified version of the horizontal screen test (\nReddy and Jian, 2010\n). A screen test is a measure of motor functions and coordination. Mice were placed on a horizontally oriented grid consisting of parallel 1.5-mm-diameter rods situated 1 cm apart, and the grid was inverted. Mice failing to remain on the screen for 60 seconds were considered failures due to excessive sedation or motor ataxia. Additionally, the rotarod test was also used to assess toxicity in mice. Mice were placed on the rotarod apparatus (IITC Life Science Instrument) for 60 seconds at a fixed speed of 4 rpm. The latency to fall from the rotating rod was recorded. Calculations were based on an average of 3 tests per animal per dose. Na\u00efve mice are typically able to complete the rotarod assessment for the full 60 seconds without falling; therefore, falling from the rotating rod before 60 seconds was interpreted as motor coordination or balance impairment toxicity.\n\n2.5. Isobolographic analysis of pharmacodynamic interactions with ASMs\nThe interactions between the clinical CBD product (Epidiolex), and GX or MDZ against 6-Hz-induced seizures were investigated using the established methodology as described previously (\n\u0141uszczki., 2008a\n,\nb\n;\nChuang and Reddy, 2020\n). In brief, the ED\n50\nof each drug administered alone in the 6-Hz seizure model was first determined by using log-probit linear regression analysis (\nLitchfield and Wilcoxon, 1949\n). Next, we calculated the theoretical ED\n50 add\nvalues \u00b1 SEM for the tested drugs at three commonly used drug-dose ratios (1:1, 1:3, and 3:1), as previously described (\n\u0141uszczki, 2003a\n;\nMadsen, 2011\n). A fixed-ratio combination of 1:3 means that the drug mixture (CBD+GX or CBD+MDZ) is composed of a ratio between one-fourth of the ED\n50\nvalue CBD and three-fourths of the ED\n50\nvalue of GX or MDZ, thereby resulting in a combined theoretical ED\n50\ndose. The ED\n50 add\nvalue is defined as the total additive dose of the two drugs in the mixture, which theoretically exert 50% protection against 6-Hz-induced seizures, whereas the ED\n50 mix\nvalue is defined as the experimentally derived total doses of two mixed and tested drugs administered at a fixed-ratio combination, sufficient to provide 50% protection against 6-Hz seizure. The ED\n50 mix\nvalues were calculated for each fixed drug combination (CBD+GX and CBD+MDZ) ratios using equations described previously (\n\u0141uszczki, 2003a\n;\nMadsen et al, 2011\n).\nThis isobologram method allows for the stratification of tested drug combinations into synergistic (supra-additive), additive, or antagonistic (subadditive) interactions. Additionally, using this methodology, it is accepted that half the ED\n50\ndose of a first drug plus half of the ED\n50\ndose of a second drug should be as therapeutically effective as a full dose of either drug administered alone. This concept of additive ED\n50\ndose fractions is a fundamental rule underlying isobolographic analysis (\nLoewe, 1953\n;\nTallarida, 2000\n). The produced effect of two combined drug interactions is described by the interaction index I (\nBerenbaum, 1977\n):\nI\n=\nD\n1\n/\nM\n1\n+\nD\n2\n/\nM\n2\n(1)\nD1 and D2 represent concentrations of drugs 1 and 2 that produce a specific effect when applied together; M1 and M2 are the median concentrations of those drugs that will produce the same effect when given alone. Therefore, for deriving the 50% seizure protection values, the above equation can be understood as follows:\nI\n=\nD\n1\n/\nED\n50\n,\n1\n+\nD\n2\n/\nED\n50\n,\n2\n(2)\nIn this second equation, ED\n50,1\nand ED\n50,2\nare the ED\n50\nvalues of drugs 1 and 2 alone. As with the first equation, D1 and D2 are the doses of drugs 1 and 2, which produce 50% protection when administered together.\nFor drugs showing an interaction, these equations have been adapted and advanced to define the combination index, which quantifies the extent and type of such an interaction between two coadministered drugs (\nChou and Talalay, 1983\n):\nC\no\nm\nb\ni\nn\na\nt\ni\no\nn\nI\nn\nd\ne\nx\n=\nD\n1\n/\nM\n1\n+\nD\n2\n/\nM\n2\n(3)\nFor combination index values >1, the drug interaction is considered antagonistic, whereas values between 0\u20131 are considered synergistic. A combination index value of exactly, or approximately, 1 is considered an additive interaction. These calculations are represented in the main text and have been calculated according to previous studies (\nChou and Talalay, 1983\n;\nChuang and Reddy, 2020\n).\nIn these isobologram studies, the percent protection of mice against 6-Hz-induced seizures and, subsequently, dose-response relationship lines were fitted using nonlinear logistic fitting. The ED\n50\nvalues with their 95% confidence limits (CL) were calculated by computer-assisted log-probit analysis according to the Litchfield and Wilcoxon procedure. The dose-response relationships of the drug of interest for target outcomes were subjected to the test for parallelism, an essential criterion for characterizing ASM interactions with isobologram. If the 95% CL is not symmetric around the ED50 on the log scale, antagonistic or synergistic interactions are calculated using S.E.M. (logED\n50add\n). Because the dose-response relationship for CBD, GX, and MDZ was parallel in this study, we employ type I isobolographic analysis for parallel dose-response relationships. Student\u2019s t-test was used to quantify the differences between the experimentally derived (ED\n50\nmix) and theoretical additive (ED\n50\nadd) values (\nTallarida, 2000\n;\n\u0141uszczki, 2008a\n,\nb\n;\nMadsen et al, 2011\n).\n\n2.6. Drugs and reagents\nCBD (Epidiolex, 100 mg/ml) solution in sesame oil was acquired from GW Pharmaceuticals. Epidiolex was further diluted to 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg doses with sesame oil obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (category #S3547). Midazolam (Akorn, Inc. Lake Forest, IL) was diluted in sterile saline. Ganaxolone was acquired from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada) and prepared in a 20% \u03b2-cyclodextrin in saline. Drug solutions were administered subcutaneously or intraperitoneally in a volume equaling 1% of the animal\u2019s body weight. The drugs were administered at two different time points to examine the ability of CBD and MDZ or GX to suppress seizure activity. CBD was administered i.p. at 1-hr pre-stimulation, whereas MDZ or GX was administered subcutaneously 15 minutes prior to the 6-Hz challenge.\n\n2.7. Statistical analysis\nGroup data are expressed as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. In pharmacological studies, the percent protection of mice against 6-Hz-induced seizures and, subsequently, dose-response relationship lines were fitted using nonlinear logistic fitting. The ED\n50\nvalues with their 95% confidence limits (CL) were calculated by computer-assisted log-probit analysis according to the Litchfield and Wilcoxon procedure. The dose-response relationships of the drug of interest for target outcomes were subjected to the test for parallelism, an essential criterion for characterizing ASM interactions with isobologram. Because the dose-response relationship for CBD, GX, and MDZ was parallel in this study, we employ type I isobolographic analysis for parallel dose-response relationships. Student\u2019s t-test was used to quantify the differences between the experimentally derived (ED\n50\nmix) and theoretical additive (ED\n50\nadd) values for each fixed dose-ratio combination (\nTallarida, 2000\n;\n\u0141uszczki, 2008a\n,\nb\n;\nMadsen et al, 2011\n). Differences in nonparametric data, such as seizure stage, were compared with the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by the Mann-Whitney U Test. In all statistical tests, the criterion for statistical significance was p<0.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nC57BL/6 mice and cell type-specific mgll knockout (KO) mice, including total mgll KO (tKO), neuronal mgll KO (nKO), and astrocytic mgll KO (aKO) mice, as well as mgll\nflox/flox\nwithout cre as wild type (WT) mice were used in the present study, as described previously (\nHu et al., 2022\n). CB1R KO mice and their WT littermates were also used in the present study. As demonstrated previously (\nViader et al., 2015\n;\nViader et al., 2016\n), MAGL in microglia does not play a significant role in degrading 2-AG. Thus, no microglial mgll KO (mKO) mice were used in the present study. Both male and female mice at two to three months of ages were used in the present study and the animals were randomly assigned to groups. All animal studies were performed in compliance with the US Department of Health and Human Services Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the care and use of the animals reported in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Texas Health San Antonio.\n\n2.2. Cell culture\nMixed neurons and astroglial cells (astroglial cells~5%) and HEK 293/293T cells were cultured as described previously (\nChen et al., 2013\n;\nChen et al., 2011\n;\nDu et al., 2011\n;\nSang et al., 2005\n;\nZhang and Chen, 2008\n;\nZhang et al., 2014\n). The extent of neurons and astroglial cells in culture were estimated by using immunostaining with NeuN, a neuronal marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocytic marker, and OX-42, a microglial marker, in conjunction with DAPI staining as we described before (\nChen et al., 2013\n;\nSang et al., 2005\n;\nZhang and Chen, 2008\n).\n\n2.3. Generation of lentivirus expressing miR-30b\nThe FUGW lentiviral (LV) vector was used to insert a miR-30b short hairpin RNA driven by a U6 promoter and the GFP reporter gene driven by an ubiquitin promoter, as described previously (\nSong et al., 2019\n). The primers for cloning miR-30b in LV vector are as followings: forward: 5\u2019GACGTTCGAATCTAGAGATCCGACGCCGCCATC3\u2019, and reverse: 5\u2019GACGTTAATTAAAAAAAAATGTAAACATCCTACACTCAGCTTCTCTTGAAAGCTGAGTGTAGGATGTTTACAAAACAAGGCTTTTCTCCAAGGGA3\u2019. PCR product was then digested and ligated into the BstB1-Pac1 sites in a modified FUGW2.1 construct with U6 promoter. pCMV\u03948.9 and VSVg vectors were used for viral envelope and production in 293T cells and titered by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis using a flow cytometry as described previously (\nChen et al., 2013\n;\nZhang et al., 2014\n). The titer of the LV at least 1.0x10\n10\nwas used for\nin vivo\ninjections.\nThe FUGW LV was also used for generation of LV expressing NF-\u03baB p65 shRNA as described previously (\nGao et al., 2022\n;\nSong et al., 2019\n;\nZhang et al., 2014\n). The oligos for the NF-\u03baBp65 shRNA construct (5\u2019AGGACCTATGAGACCTTCAAG3\u2019) and scramble: (5\u2019GAATCATTACGCGAGACTGCA3\u2019) were used for the construct to silence NF-\u03baB p65.\n\n2.4. Stereotaxic injection\nAnimals at 2 months of age were anesthetized with ketamine/Xylazine (200/10 mg/kg). LV-controls or LV-miR-30b (2 \u03bcl at 0.2 \u03bcl/min/each side) was stereotaxically injected into the hippocampus at the coordinate: AP, \u22122, ML, \u00b11.8, and DV, \u22122, with a 5 \u03bcl of Hamilton microsyringe, as described previously (\nSong et al., 2019\n;\nZhang et al., 2014\n). All the assays were carried out 30 days after injection of LV.\n\n2.5. Reverse transcription and real-time PCR\nTotal RNA was extracted from hippocampal tissues or cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit and treated with RNase-free DNase as described previously (\nGao et al., 2022\n;\nSong et al., 2019\n;\nZhang et al., 2014\n). 1 \u03bcg of total RNA was used with 4 \u03bcl 5\u00d7 iscript reaction mix and 1 \u03bcl iscript reverse transcriptase. Samples (20 \u03bcl) were incubated for 5 min at 25 \u00b0C, and then were then heated to 42 \u00b0C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by heating to 85 \u00b0C for 5 min. The primers for miR-30b and U5/U6 were obtained from QIAGEN (Valencia, CA). The primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were selected using Beacon Designer Software (BioRad) and synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA): forward primer, reverse primer (amplicon size), genebank number: 5\u2019-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3\u2019, 5\u2019-ACCTTGCCCACAGCCTTG-3\u2019 (134 bp),\nM32599\n. All the PCR products were verified by sequencing. We used the relative CT method to calculate RNAs as the fold increase or decrease, which was determined relative to the control after normalizing to a housekeeping gene using 2\n\u2212\u0394\u0394\nCT\n, where \u0394CT is (gene of interest CT) - (GAPDH CT), and \u0394\u0394CT is (\u0394CT treated) - (\u0394CT control), as described previously (\nSang et al., 2005\n;\nZhang and Chen, 2008\n;\nZhang et al., 2014\n;\nZhang et al., 2015a\n).\n\n2.6. Immunoblot\nThe immunoblot assay was used to determine expression of ephB2, sirt1, and GluA2 in hippocampal tissues from animals that received LV-miR-30b. Hippocampal tissue was extracted and immediately homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer and protease inhibitors, and incubated on ice for 30 min, then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were fractionated on 4-15% SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). A special 16.5% Criterion\n\u2122\nTris-Tricine Gelforgel (Bio-Rad) was used for detecting A\u03b242 immunoreactivity. The antibodies used to detect the expression of following proteins: Anti-ephB2 (1:200, Abcam, Cat# AB5418), anti-sirt1 (1:1000, EMD Millipore, Cat# 09-844), anti-GluA2 (1:1,000, EMD Millipore, Cat# MAB397). We incubated the membrane with specific antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight, washed and incubated the blot with a secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit 1:2,000, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) at room temperature for 1 hr. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, UK). The densities of specific bands were quantified by densitometry using FUJIFILM Multi Gauge software (version 3.0). Signal intensities were normalized to mouse anti \u03b2-actin (1:4000, Sigma), as described previously (\nChen et al., 2013\n;\nChen et al., 2012\n;\nGao et al., 2022\n;\nHu et al., 2022\n;\nSong et al., 2019\n;\nZhang and Chen, 2008\n;\nZhang et al., 2014\n;\nZhang et al., 2015a\n).\n\n2.7. Immunofluorescence\nImmunohistochemical analysis was performed to detect GFP in coronal brain sections as described previously (\nGao et al., 2022\n;\nHe et al., 2012\n;\nHu et al., 2022\n;\nSong et al., 2019\n;\nZhang et al., 2014\n). Animals that received LV-control or miR-30b were anesthetized with ketamine/Xylazine (200/10 mg/kg) and subsequently transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer. Cryostat sectioning was made on a Leica freezing Vibratome at 30 \u03bcm and series sections (10 to 12 slices) were collected in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. 4\u2019-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to detect cell nuclei in the sections. The fluorescent signals were detected using a Zeiss deconvolution microscope with SlideBook 6.0 software.\n\n2.8. Hippocampal slice preparation\nHippocampal slices were prepared as described previously (\nChen et al., 2002\n;\nChen et al., 2013\n;\nChen et al., 2012\n;\nHu et al., 2022\n). Briefly, after decapitation, brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice cold oxygenated (95% O\n2\n, 5% CO\n2\n) low-Ca\n2+\n/high-Mg\n2+\nslicing solution composed of (in mM): 2.5 KCl, 7.0 MgCl\n2\n, 28.0 NaHCO\n3\n, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 CaCl\n2\n, 7.0 glucose, 3.0 pyruvic acid, 1.0 ascorbic acid, and 234 sucrose. Slices were cut at a thickness of 350 \u03bcm and transferred to a holding chamber in an incubator containing oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) composed of (in mM): 125.0 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.0 MgCl\n2\n, 25.0 NaHCO\n3\n, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.0 CaCl\n2\n, 25.0 glucose, 3 pyruvic acid, and 1 ascorbic acid at 36 \u00b0C for 0.5 to 1 hr, and then maintained in an incubator containing oxygenated ACSF at room temperature (~22-24 \u00b0C) for >1.5 hr before recordings. Slices were then transferred to a recording chamber continuously perfused with 95% O\n2\n, 5% CO\n2\n-saturated ACSF at ~32-34 \u00b0C.\n\n2.9. Electrophysiological recordings\nExtracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in response to stimuli at medial perforant path (MPP) synapses in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus at a frequency of 0.05 Hz using an Axoclamp 900A amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced by a high-frequency stimulation (HFS) consisting of two trains of 100 Hz stimulation (1 sec duration and a 20 sec inter-train interval). The baseline stimulation strength was set to provide fEPSP with an amplitude of ~30% from the sub-threshold maximum, as described previously (\nChen et al., 2013\n;\nGao et al., 2022\n;\nSong et al., 2019\n;\nZhang et al., 2014\n;\nZhang et al., 2015a\n). SR95531 (gabazine, 2 \u03bcM) was included in the external solution during recordings.\nWhole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made using an Axopatch-200B patch-clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) under voltage clamp as described previously (\nChen, 2004\n;\nChen et al., 2012\n). Pipettes (2-4 M\u03a9) were pulled from borosilicate glass with a micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). The internal pipette solution contained (in mM): 90.0 CsCH\n3\nSO\n3\n, 40.0 CsCl, 10.0 HEPES, 5.0 CaCl\n2\n, 4.0 Mg\n2\nATP, 0.3 Na\n2\nGTP, and 5.0 QX-314, or 130 KCH\n3\nSO\n4\n, 10 KCl, 4 NaCl 10 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA, 4 Mg\n2\nATP, 0.3 Na\n2\nGTP, and 5 QX-314. The membrane potential was held at \u221270 mV. Spontaneous EPSCs and input-output responses were recorded at perforant path synapses in hippocampal slices from cell type-specific mgll KO mice that were treated with LV-miR-30b or LV-control. The amplitude, frequency, and kinetics of sEPSCs were analyzed using the MiniAnalysis program. SR95531 (2 \u03bcM) was used to block GABAergic synaptic transmission during recordings.\n\n2.10. Statistics\nAll values are expressed as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. Student\u2019s t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc tests were used for statistical comparison when appropriate. Differences were considered significant when P< 0.05.\n\n2.11. Data Availability\nData supporting the findings of this manuscript are available from the corresponding authors upon request."

    "Methods": "2.1. Ethical approval and animal welfare\nExperiments were approved by the King's College London Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board and were conducted in accordance with UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA) under Home Office Project Licence number P53631BC2. During all experiments, data processing, and analysis the investigators were blind to the treatment group of each animal. An independent third party coded and randomly assigned animals to treatment groups in an alternating pattern prior to injury without knowledge of baseline behavioural assessments and electrophysiological recordings.\nAnimals were housed in groups of four or five, exposed to a normal 12-h dark-light cycle at 21\u00a0\u00b0C with environmental enrichment and access to food and water ad libitum. The health and welfare of all animals was monitored daily by veterinary staff and the study investigators at King's College London and was in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act 2006. 28 female Wistar rats (256\u00a0g\u00a0\u00b1\u00a029\u00a0g; Envigo; RccHan:WIST) were used in this study. Of the 28 animals, one died three days after contusion injury, with all other animals making uneventful recoveries. One animal was excluded from the study due to regaining near perfect locomotion in open field (BBB score of 20) within three weeks of injury. Animals were divided into three groups: 1) contusion + NT3 (NT3,\nn\n=\u00a011); 2) contusion + PBS (PBS,\nn\n=\u00a012); and 3) uninjured + no treatment (sham,\nn\n=\u00a04). PBS was used as a control group as it was the vehicle used for treatment application (\nTang et al., 2020\n;\nJohnston et al., 2021\n;\nRghei et al., 2021\n;\nAguil\u00e0 et al., 2020\n;\nSahenk et al., 2014\n). Our previous work, and that of others, has shown that intramuscular injection of AAV1-CMV-GFP into rodents causes no detectable alterations in effects on the inflammatory response, neuroinflammation, or behaviour after neurological trauma, including SCI (\nPetrosyan et al., 2014\n;\nDuricki et al., 2016b\n;\nKathe et al., 2016\n). In adherence to the NC3Rs and ARRIVE guidelines, this additional negative control group has not been repeated in this study. Following injury, animals were housed in mixed cages comprising injured animals of both NT3 and PBS treated animals for the duration of the study. Sham animals were housed together in a separate cage.\n\n2.2. Injury and treatment application\n2.2.1. Thoracic contusion injury\nRats were induced with Isoflurane (5%; Zoetis, UK Ltd) at 1\u00a0l.min\n\u22121\nO\n2\nflow and maintained with 2.5% isoflurane throughout surgery. Preoperatively 5\u00a0mg/kg Enrofloxacin (Baytril) and 5\u00a0mg/kg carprofen (Carprieve) were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) and a homeothermic heat pad (Harvard Apparatus) maintained body temperature at 37\u00b11\u030aC. Upon reaching a surgical plane of anaesthesia, eye ointment (Viscotears) was applied and the region around the lower thoracic vertebrae was shaved and the skin sterilised.\nA 2\u00a0cm dorsal midline incision from T8-T11 vertebrae was performed and the spinotrapezius muscles retracted to expose the vertebral column. A complete laminectomy of the T8 vertebra was performed and the vertebral column stabilised in the Infinite Horizon contusion impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation). Animals received a single bilateral contusion, of 250 kDyn force with 0\u00a0s dwell time using a 2.5\u00a0mm diameter impact tip (Precision Systems Instrumentation), at the T9 spinal segment. Muscle layers and the skin were sutured in two layers (4\u20130 Vicryl; Ethicon) and animals given saline (5\u00a0ml; s.c.). Sham animals received a full T8 laminectomy, without clamping in the Infinite Horizons impactor, and all pre-and post-operative drugs.\nFor five days after injury animals continued to receive; warm saline (s.c.), 5\u00a0mg/kg Baytril, and 5\u00a0mg/kg Carprieve. Animals were unable to void their bladders naturally for the first week after injury, necessitating manual bladder emptying three times per day. Once spontaneous voiding was recovered, bladder volume and voiding was monitored daily to ensure no infections occurred.\n2.2.2. Adeno-associated virus encoding neurotrophin-3\nAn AAV transfer plasmid, AAVspNT3, was cloned to contain the full length human prepro-neurotrophin-3 under a CMV promoter. The neurotrophin-3 coding DNA sequence (\nNM_002527.4\n), corresponding to isoform 2 precursor protein including the secretory signal, was flanked by splice donor/splice acceptor sites and terminated in a beta globin poly(A) sequence (gifted by Prof. Fred Gage, Salk Institute). This was packaged into an AAV serotype 1 (University of Pennsylvania Viral Vector Core facility; custom batch CS1232). This vector (referred to as AAV-NT3) was titered using digital droplet PCR (6.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n13\ngenomic copies (gc)/ml; Viral Vector Core) and in our lab via qPCR (1.22\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n13\ngc/ml), the latter value being used for dilution calculations. Primers for the qPCR were: Forward 5\u2019-AATTACCAGAGCACCCTGCC and Reverse 5\u2019-TTTTGATCTCCCCCAGCACC.\n2.2.3. Intramuscular injections\nForty-eight hours after contusion, the\ntibialis anterior\nand\ngastrocnemius\nmuscles of both hindlimbs as well as\nrectus abdominus\nwere injected with AAV-NT3 or PBS (\nFig. 1\nA). Animals were prepared similarly to above with both hindlimbs and the abdomen shaved. Injections were made using a 26G non-coring beveled needle attached to a Hamilton syringe. A total of 2.57\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n12\ngc of AAV-NT3 diluted in 220\u00a0\u03bcl of PBS (or equivalent amount of PBS vehicle) was injected into each animal. Targeting motor endplates was achieved by deep injections positioned in a circumferential arc across the\ntibialis anterior\nand\ngastrocnemius\nmuscles (\nYin et al., 2019\n) (\nFig. 1\nB). For the\nrectus abdominus\nall injections were superficial, with care taken not to penetrate through the muscle into the peritoneal cavity.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nExperimental overview.\nA) Timeline indicating the timepoints of each behavioural and electrophysiological assay.

B) Top panel: cross section through a muscle indicating approximate location of needle insertion (X) and injection site and depth (O). Hindlimb muscles were injected dorsoproximally as shown. Bottom panel: circumferential arc around the muscle belly (blue), with points of needle insertion shown, designed to target the entirety of the muscle belly. C) Schematic of the rat in a supine position showing the injected muscles. Left: lateral hindlimb showing the\ntibialis anterior\nand\ngastrocnemius\n. Right:\nrectus abdominus\n, showing the tendinous insertions (pale pink), xyphoid process and the pubic symphysis (long solid black lines), and approximate positions of the injections (O and black dashed line). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\nTibialis Anterior:\nInjections were made across the proximal aspect of the muscle, approximately two thirds the distance from the ankle to the knee. A total of 6x5\u03bcl of AAV-NT3 (3.50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n11\ngc) or PBS was delivered per muscle (\nFig. 1\nC).\nGastrocnemius:\nA total of 6x5\u03bcl of AAV-NT3 (3.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n11\ngc) or PBS were injected into both the medial and lateral heads, totalling 7.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n11\ngc in each\ngastrocnemius\n.\nRectus Abdominus: Rectus Abdominus\nwas exposed from the xiphoid process down to the pubic symphysis. Two 5\u00a0\u03bcl injections of AAV-NT3 (4.67\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n11\ngc) or PBS were made between the 4th\u20135th and 5th\u20136th tendinous insertions, to target the region innervated at or below the level of thoracic contusion (\nHijikata et al., 1992\n) (\nFig. 1\nC). In total, 20\u00a0\u03bcl was delivered to each side.\n\n2.3. Behavioural functional assessment\n2.3.1. Open field locomotor assessments\nLocomotor functional recovery was monitored using the 0\u201321 point Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan scale (BBB) (\nBasso et al., 1995\n). One week prior to injury, animals were habituated to a circular Perspex open field assessment area (100\u00a0cm diameter, 20\u00a0cm high) for ten minutes each day. Testing was done in the afternoon at day \u22121, and then weekly following injury during a five-minute period by two assessors.\nAnalysis:\nThe BBB score for each hindlimb were averaged between the two assessors and the BBB sub-scores similarly calculated (\nPopovich et al., 2012\n).\n2.3.2. Horizontal ladder\nAccuracy of stepping was assessed through the animals' ability to cross a 1\u00a0m horizontal ladder with rungs spaced randomly 1-3\u00a0cm apart. Prior to injury, animals were trained to cross the ladder for 15\u00a0min periods each day and baseline values obtained within 5\u00a0days prior to injury. Testing comprised video recording three complete runs weekly following injury.\nAnalysis:\nFootage was slowed 5\u00d7 original speed in VLC media player (VideoLan) and steps by both hindlimbs was assessed using the horizontal ladder scoring system (\nMetz and Whishaw, 2002\n). This scale assessed the accuracy of foot placement on ladder rungs categorized as fall, slip (deep or slight), corrective step (replacement, correction, imperfect partial placement), and hit (perfect placement) with each type of positioning demonstrating an ability to perform independent skilled functions. Briefly; a \u2018miss\u2019 occurs when the hindlimb fails to connect with a rung, and a \u2018slip\u2019 when the limb bears weight but slips off the rung with or without interruption to gait cycle. A \u201ccorrective step\u201d is defined as when the hindpaw contacts the rung but is then repositioned. Finally, a \u2018hit\u2019 is a placement which results in a successful step.\n2.3.3. Swimming\nTo assess non-weight bearing locomotor function, animals swam in a rectangular glass chamber (120\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a012\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050\u00a0cm) filled with 25\u00a0cm water at 20\u201323\u00a0\u00b0C (\nRyu et al., 2017\n;\nGonzenbach et al., 2010\n). A Perspex mirror was placed at a 45\u00b0 angle on the base, allowing recording of ventral and lateral views of the animal (60 frame per second at 1920\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01080 pixels, HERO7 Black, GoPro). Following a two-week habituation period, baseline recordings were collected within 5\u00a0days prior to injury. Rats placed at one end of the chamber would swim 80\u00a0cm, equalling one run, to an accessible platform (\nFig. 3\nA) at the other end. Animals were assessed weekly from three weeks following injury with five complete runs, recorded during the same time of day.\nFig. 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nNT3 treatment reverses deficits in hindlimb coordination during swimming\n. A) Swimming tank schematic. A 45\u00b0 mirror provided simultaneous lateral and ventral views. Water temperature\u00a0=\u00a020\u201323\u00a0\u00b0C.

Dotted red line i-ii) shows the closure of the angle made between the dorsal surface of the hindpaw and the shin. Adduction of the hip joint was also present, shown by iv) the inward rotation of the right hindlimb. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\nAnalysis:\nHind-limb swim strokes from all runs were analysed in slow motion using VLC media player (5\u00d7 original speed, VideoLan). The percentage of left-right alternating and total number of strokes was calculated for each limb. Hindlimb strokes were excluded if they: occurred outside the 80\u00a0cm assessment area; were associated with a change in direction; or were the initial stroke following an interruption to swimming. The number of coordinated hind limb strokes over all the runs performed by each animal was displayed as a proportion of total number of hindlimb strokes performed.\n2.3.4. H reflex recordings\nAnimals were anaesthetised with ketamine and medetomidine (30\u00a0mg/kg and 0.10\u00a0mg/kg i.p respectively) and treated with atropine sulphate (0.1\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0s.c) and carprofen s.c (Carprieve 5\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0s.c.). Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b11\u030aC using a homeothermic heat pad (Harvard Apparatus) and the ankle and hindpaw cleaned with 4% chlorhexidine. Recordings were taken from the left hindlimb at final timepoint, or from the limb with the higher BBB subscore (\nn\n=\u00a04). Two 26-gauge needles were positioned, subcutaneously in parallel and approximately 2\u00a0mm apart, over the medial malleolus of the ankle to stimulate the medial plantar nerve. To record compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) from the intrinsic hindpaw muscles innervated by the medial plantar nerve, two non-insulated needle recording electrodes were positioned at the base of first digit between the two prominent paw pads and placed superficially, 1\u00a0mm apart and 2\u00a0mm deep (\nFig. 4\nB).\nFig. 4.\nOpen in a new tab\n250kdyn thoracic contusion did not generate hyperreflexia.\nA) Stimulation protocol. B) Position of the recording and stimulation electrodes; note that recording and stimulation electrodes were placed in the same limb; two images show the same limb from different angles. C&D) Representative traces from and contused animals highlighting the M and H wave (yellow) associated with the test stimulus at either 5000\u00a0ms or 100\u00a0ms ISI. E) Rate dependent depression was the same regardless of animal group. F) Motor thresholds were similar between groups (red symbols denote excluded animals). G) The Hmax:Mmax ratio was comparable between groups. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\nA monophasic 100\u00a0\u03bcs square wave stimulus was applied using an isolated constant current pulse stimulator (DS3, Digitimer) and the CMAP signal (amplified 2000\u00d7, band-pass filtered between 300\u00a0Hz \u2013 6\u00a0kHz) digitized via a Power1401-3A unit (Cambridge Electrical Design Ltd., CED) and visualised in Signal software (v5, CED), recording in 5000\u00a0ms sweeps. Motor threshold was defined as the stimulus at which the M wave was elicited in three out of four stimuli. A recruitment curve was generated by recording 15 stimuli at 0.2\u00a0Hz, starting at 1\u00d7 motor threshold (MT) to a maximum of 2\u00d7 MT in 10% increments up to 1.5xMT and finally at 2xMT. Subsequent rate dependent depression (RDD) was assessed with a paired stimulation protocol (4) at 1.3xMT stimulus intensity. Fifteen paired pulses were delivered 300\u00a0ms into the sweep at various interstimulus intervals (ISI.\nFig. 4\nA) Once recordings were finished, 2\u00a0mg/kg (i.p.) atipamezole hydrochloride and 5\u00a0ml saline (s.c.) was injected.\nAnalysis:\nAmplitude of the M and H waves was calculated in Signal software (v5, CED). The recruitment curve yielded the maximum H wave amplitude (Hmax) and maximum M wave amplitude (Mmax). For each ISI, the 15\u00d7 M wave and H wave amplitudes corresponding to the conditional stimulus and the 15 for the test stimulus were pooled and averaged. These averages were then normalised to the Mmax for that testing session. Finally, RDD was calculated by representing the normalised H wave of the test stimulus as a percentage of the H wave of the conditioning stimulus.\n2.3.5. Retrograde tracing\nCholera Toxin Subunit B (CTb, #103, List Biologicals) was used to retrogradely trace motor neurons innervating the lateral head of the\ngastrocnemius\nin the left hindlimb. Animals were prepared and the\ngastrocnemius visualised\nas per the previous muscle injections. A total of 5x1\u03bcl of 0.5% Cholera Toxin B (diluted in ddH\n2\n0) was injected into the lateral muscle head, following a similar trajectory to treatment injections, using a 26G needle on a Hamilton syringe. Following surgery, animals were given 5\u00a0ml of saline and the following day a single dose of Carprieve.\n2.3.6. Tissue collection\nAnimals were deeply anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (Euthatal, 80\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0i.p.). 1.5\u00a0ml of blood was taken through cardiac puncture of the left ventricle and stored overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C before processing. Animals were transcardially perfused with PBS. The left\ngastrocnemius\n, including both the medial and lateral heads, was removed, snap frozen, and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C. Animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\u00a0M phosphate buffer. The spinal cord from C3 to the cauda equina was removed and post fixed in fresh 4% PFA in PBS for 24\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\n2.3.7. ELISA & BCA quantification\nLevels of NT3 protein in the serum were assessed using a Human Neurotrophin-3 ELISA Kit (#ab100615 Abcam), which can detect vector-derived and endogenous NT3. Whole blood was centrifuged (7200\ng\n, 25\u030aC), the serum removed and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0\nC. ELISA\nwas performed as per the manufacturer's instructions and the plate read immediately at 450\u00a0nm using a BMG LabTech FLUOStar (Omega). NT3 levels were normalised to the total amount of protein extracted from each sample determined by a Bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) assay (#71285\u20133, Novagen, Millipore). Serum samples were diluted 1:150 in PBS, and a four-parameter standard curve was generated (above\nr\n>\u00a00.99).\n2.3.8. Ex vivo\nMRI\nFor lesion quantification the epicentre of the lesion was imaged using a 9.4\u00a0T MRI scanner (Brucker Biospec). T2 weighted (T2W) images were acquired using a fast spin-echo sequence: echo train length\u00a0=\u00a04, effective TE\u00a0=\u00a038\u00a0ms, TR\u00a0=\u00a03000\u00a0ms, FOV\u00a0=\u00a040\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0mm, acquisition matrix\u00a0=\u00a0400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0200, acquisition time\u00a0=\u00a09\u00a0h 20\u00a0m. A custom-made device enabled simultaneous scanning of the T6-L1 regions of 14 spinal cords. Tissue was fully submerged in Fomblin (Solvay) and all air bubbles removed prior to scanning. The spinal cords were prepared for scanning as described previously (\nSydney-Smith et al., 2021a\n) with additional care taken due to the reduced stability of the spinal cord around the epicentre.\nAnalysis:\nConvert3D (ITK-SNAP) was used to alter the voxel dimensions to isotropic voxel size of 50\u00a0\u03bcm. The composite image was separated into individual spinal cords to final voxel dimensions of 30x100x30\u03bcm in the\nX\nx\nY\nx\nZ\naxis respectively. Within ITK-SNAP, the contrast was increased (minimum adjustment:0.03, maximum adjustment:0.82, levels:0.41, window:0.82) and automatic segmentation performed for: presumptive spared white matter (lower limit\u00a0=\u00a00.18, upper limit\u00a0=\u00a00.28) and total spinal cord (lower limit\u00a0=\u00a00.00, upper limit\u00a0=\u00a00.29). The segmentation parameters were: radius 2.5, competition force =1.000, smoothing force\u00a0=\u00a00.2, \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a01.000, \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.100, speed\u00a0=\u00a01.00. All parameters were identical for each spinal cord. A screenshot series of the transverse views of the mask and images every 100\u00a0\u03bcm were quantified in FIJI 9 (U.S. National Institutes of Health). Volume for each parameter was calculated as the thickness of the voxel multiplied by the cross-sectional area. The cross-sectional area of the tissue was measured in a region 4.1\u00a0mm in length and encompassing the epicentre.\n2.3.9. Immunohistochemistry for VGlut1\nFollowing ex vivo MRI, spinal cords were washed in PBS, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, frozen in OCT compound and cut in transverse 15\u00a0\u03bcm sections. Sections were immunostained using; rabbit anti-vGlut1 antibody (1:1000, #135302, Synaptic Systems), Goat-anti-CTB (1:2000, #703, List Biolgicals), Mouse-anti-NeuN (1:500, #MAB377, Millipore). Sections were counterstained with Alexa 546 and Alexa 488 (1:1000, #A10040 and #A10036, Thermofisher) and Dylight 650 (1:500, #ab96938, Abcam). Five sections throughout the L4-L6 segments were selected and traced \u03b1-motor neurons (Ctb+/ NeuN+) in the ventral horns were imaged at 400\u00d7 magnification (LSM 710, Zeiss). Animals with fewer than five traced motor neurons were excluded from analysis.\nAnalysis:\nAnalysis was performed in FIJI (NIH) by measuring raw integrated density within a 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm band surrounding the soma, and manually counting distinct vGlut1+ puncta abutting the motor neuron.\n\n2.4. Statistical analysis\nPrior to all experiments, power analysis (G*Power (version 3.1), type 1 error threshold (\u03b1)\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05 and power (1-\u03b2)\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.90) was conducted to ensure reliable data based on previous experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using either Prism (version 9, GraphPad) or SPSS (version 25, IBM). Locomotion behavioural assessments were analysed using a linear model with a suitable covariance structure as described previously (\nDuricki et al., 2016c\n). For analysis of the horizontal ladder, for each dependent variable (e.g., Slips, Hits or Miss) in turn, we specified a linear mixed model in which we included limb (Left or Right) as a factor. Because these analyses often revealed a difference between limbs (Supplementary Table 1), we also analysed each limb separately and report these values in the Results section.\nAll data sets were found to be normally distributed by viewing frequency histograms and/or satisfying Kolmogorov Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests. Error bars in graphs are mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Standard error of mean. Divergences were considered significant if\nP\n<\u00a00.05.

If no post-hoc result is shown, comparison was not significant."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nAnimal usage, methods, and experimental design were approved by the Loma Linda University Institute Animal Care and Use Committee and in compliance with the ARRIVE Guidelines for the use of animals in research. 258 p7 Sprague-Dawley Neonatal pups (weight 9\u201315 g, Harlan, Livermore, CA) were used for this study.\n\n2.2. Germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH) model\nGerminal Matrix Hemorrhage (GMH) was induced by stereo-guided injection of sterile bacterial collagenase as described in (\nLekic et al., 2012\n). Neonatal rat pups were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane via isoflurane gas mixer, which were then adhered onto a stereotactic frame with a neonatal adaptor. An incision was made in the midline exposing the bregma, and a burr hole was made on the right side of the skill at coordinates of 1.6 mm (right-lateral), and 1.5 mm (rostral) from bregma. A 10 uL syringe with 0.3 units of collagenase V-II (VII-S, Sigma; 0.3U in 0.5\u03bcL of PBS) was guided through the burr hole at a depth of 2.7 mm, where the infusion of the collagenase occurred by a microinfusion pump ((Harvard Apparatus, Hollison, MA). To minimize the backflow of the collagenase, the syringe was kept in place for 5 min after the completion of infusion and was withdrawn at a rate of 0.5 mm/min. Pups were observed for changes in skin colour, temperature, respiratory rhythm and frequency, and heart rates. Once the needle was removed bone wax was used to seal the burrhole, followed by the suturing of the incision line. Pups were then placed in a 37 \u00b0C heated blanket for recovery and then placed back with the dam. The sham group was only subjected to needle insertion without collagenase infusion.\n\n2.3. CRISPR Intracerebroventricular injections\nFPR2 CRISPR knockout (San Cruz Biotech, USA) plasmid or CRISPR control (Santa Cruz Biotech, USA) were given at a dose of 3 \u03bcg/pup. Animals were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and a scalp incision was made on the skull surface where the bregma was exposed. A selected group of rats were given different reagents according to the project design and were injected with a 10-ul syringe (Hamilton, Nevada, USA) at the location of 1.3 mm posterior and 1.3 mm lateral to the bregma, and 1.7 mm deep to the skull surface at the contralateral hemisphere 48 h before GMH (2ul/rat pup). The control rat pup was injected with a CRISPR dilutant (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX). The injection was completed in 5 min, and the needle was maintained in the injection position for an additional 2 min. The needle was removed slowly out of the brain, and the incision line was sutured. After recovery from anesthesia, the rat pups were placed back into their respective cages. Control CRISPR plasmid (Santa Cruz Biotech, Dallas, Tx) and FPR2 CRISPR were used. Sham animals received CRISPR Dilutant. The FPR2 CRISPR RNA sequence can be found in the\nsupplemental material\n.\n\n2.4. Drug administration, experimental design, and animal groups\nFPR2 inhibitor N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Leu-Phe-Leu-Phe (Boc-2) (MP Biomedical, Irvine, CA) was intranasally administered 1-h after surgery or give for either 3 or 7 consecutive days depending on the time-point.\nBoth male and female P7 rat pups were randomly divided into the following groups: Sham-operated, GMH + Vehicle, GMH + AnxA1, GMH + AnxA1 + Boc-2, GMH + FPR2 CRISPR, GMH + FPR2 CRISPR, GMH + CRISPR Plasmid Control, GMH + CLOD, GMH + AnxA1 +CLOD.\nFig. 1\nshows each animal group and experimental design.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nExperimental Design and Animal Groups. (GMH: Germinal Matrix Hemorrhage, WB: Western Blot, Hb Assay: Hemoglobin Assay, AnxA1: Annexin A1, IHC: Immunohistochemistry).\nExperiment 1: Detecting the endogenous expression levels of FPR2 and DUSP1.\nWestern Blot (WB) was used to evaluate the expression of these proteins in whole-brain lysate at 12 h, 24 h, 72 h, 5d, and 7d after GMH. Additionally, to confirm if FPR2 and DUSP1 proteins were found on microglia cells, the colocalization of FPR2 or DUSP1 on microglia cells was done through immunohistochemistry. Nissl staining was also conducted at 72 h to indicate the structural location of IHC images.\nExperiment 2: Evaluating the best dosing regimen and rout of administration of AnxA1.\nAnimals were divided randomly into two groups, which either received intraperitoneal or intranasal administration of Human recombinant Annexin A1 (AnxA1, R&D Systems) at a low and high concentration at 1 h after GMH induction and given for three consecutive days. Dosage concentrations for annexin A1 were modifed from the following study (\nDing et al., 2020\n). The following groups were randomly assigned: Sham, GMH + Vehicle, GMH + AnxA1 (I\u22c5P, 0.5 \u03bcg/rat pup), GMH + AnxA1 (I\u00b7P 1.5 \u03bcg/rat pup), GMH + AnxA1(in 0.05 \u03bcg/ rat pup), and GMH + AnxA1 (0.0150 \u03bcg/rat pup). Hemoglobin assay and short-term neurobehavior were used to evaluate the best dosing regimen at 72 h post-ictus.\nExperiment 3: Evaluating the effects of FPR2 agonism via AnxA1 on short- and long-term after GMH.\nFPR2 inhibitor Boc-2 (MP Biomedical, Irvine, CA) was given in combination with AnxA1 at 1 h post-ictus. Hemoglobin assay and short-term neurobehavior were conducted to evaluate the hematoma content and neurobehavioral deficits, respectively at 24 h, 72 h, and 72 h. Long-term behavior was conducted to assess long-term neurobehavioral deficits. Long-term animals were assessed for CSF pressure and Nissl staining was used to assess morphological changes (ventricular volume).\nExperiment 4: Evaluating FPR2\u2019s role in microglia cells and its ability to polarize M1 microglia to M2 phenotype.\nImmunohistochemistry was conducted at 72 h after GMH, where M1 marker (TNF-\u03b1) or M2 marker (Mannose Receptor) was colocalized with activated microglia (CD11b). Additionally, to determine the role of FPR2 in microglia induced hematoma resolution, Clophosome-A clodronate liposomes (FormuMax, Sunnyvale, CA) was used to decrease microglia cells populations in the CNS and given 48 h prior to GMH induction. Clophosome-A clodronate liposomes has been previously shown to selectively eliminate microglia (\nKumamaru et al., 2012\n). To determine if the microglia cell population was successfully reduced, western blots and IHC were performed to measure the expression of Iba1 (microglia marker) in the CNS. At 72 h, hemoglobin assay was performed to determine if the hindrance of microglia cells would ameliorate FPR2 mediated hematoma removal.\nExperiment 5: Investigating the mechanism of the proposed FPR2 signaling pathway.\nExpression Levels of FPR2, p-ERK (1/2), DUSP1, and CD36 were detected by WB. At 72 h, hemoglobin assay was performed to determine if FPR2 CRISPR ameliorated the effects of AnxA1.\nThese methods are consistent with the recommendations of the Panel on Euthanasia of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) and have been approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Loma Linda University.\n\n2.5. Western blot\nBrain hemispheres were perfused with PBS, collected and snap frozen with liquid nitrogen and storage will occur at 80\u00b0 Celsius. Cytosolic and nuclear fractionation extract were obtained from brain samples as described in (\nLekic et al., 2012\n). Denatured protein extract (50 \u03bcg) was electrophoresed and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with antibodies. The following proteins were detected by the primary antibodies for detecting Annexin A1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), FPR2 (1:1000, Santa Cruz), DUSP1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), Mannose Receptor (1:1000, Life Sciences), CD36 (1:1000, Santa Cruz), Iba-1 (1:1000, Abcam), and p-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) respectively as described in previous study (\nMa et al., 2011\n). The optical densities of the bands were visualized using ECL Plus or Li-Cor fluorescence technology and analyzed with Image J Software (NIH).\n\n2.6. Immunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemistry was executed as previously described in (\nFlores et al., 2016\n). Pups were perfused under deep anesthesia with PBS followed by 4% formaldehyde. The brains were removed for post-fxation in formalin and dehydrated with 30% sucrose solution. Paraffn-embedded brains were then sectioned into 10-\u03bcm-thick slices via cryostat. Slices were stained with the following primary antibodies; FPR2 (1:1000, Santa Cruz), DUSP1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), Mannose Receptor (1:1000, Life Sciences), CD36 (1:1000, Santa Cruz), Iba-1 (1:1000, Abcam), CD11b (1:1000, Abcam), TNF-\u03b1 (1:2000, Abcam) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Samples were then incubated with their respective fluorescence-conjugated secondary anti-bodies (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) for 2 h at room temperature, which were then dried and stained with Hardset mounting solution with Dapi (Fischer Scientific). The perihemorrhagic area was imaged using a DMi8 fluorescent microscope (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) under a 200c Fold feld. To detect the proportion of Mannose Receptor and TNF-\u03b1 positive activated microglia/macrophage cells, 4 felds surrounding the perihematomal region were used to count.\n\n2.7. Neurobehavior examination\nShort-term Neurobehavior: For up to 7 consecutive days after GMH both the righting reflex test and negative geotaxis were conducted to evaluate locomotor deficits. Long-term behavioral analysis: Long-term neurological outcomes were assessed with water maze, foot-fault and Rota rod tests at 4 weeks post GMH. The Rotarod assesses motor impairment, foot fault test assesses motor and proprioception function, and the Morris water maze test assesses learning, memory, and visual functions. All tests were conducted in a blinded manner.\nNegative Geotaxis: Rat pups were oriented at a 45\u00b0 downward angle, where the amount of time it takes the pup to recognize that it is on an incline and correct its positioning by making a 180-degree turn facing the top of the incline is recorded in 60-s durations. This exam was repeated three times for three consecutive days post-ictus. The Average of each day was taken for statistical analysis.\nMorris Water Maze: Morris Water Maze was conducted at 4 weeks as described in (\nLekic et al., 2012\n). In short, rats were released into a circular pool (110 diameters) filled with water. Spatial cues were placed on the pool walls where animals were then trained to find a submerged platform (11 cm diameter). Each animal went through 10 trials per day, where the time and distance it took the animals to find the platform was recorded. On the last day, Probe trial was conducted where the platform was removed, and the time spent in each quadrant was measured. An overhead camera in conjunction with Noldus Ethosvision (Noldus Ethovision; Noldus, Tacoma, WA tracking system) recorded the swim path and measured the swim distance, swim speeds, and time spent in probe quadrant.\nRotarod and Foot Fault: Rotarod and foot fault were conducted as described in (\nFlores et al., 2016\n). Rats were placed into the beams in the rotarod (7 cm diameter) and tested at starting speeds of 5 RPM or 10 RPM with acceleration at 2 RPM per 5 s. Falling latency was recorded with the use of the Rotarod integrated photobeam (SD Instruments, San Diego, CA).\n\n2.8. Hemoglobin assay\nSpectrophotometric measurements were used to assess hemorrhagic volume as previously described in (\nFlores et al., 2016\n). Preserved forebrains were placed into individual glass tube where 3 mL of PBS is inserted. The forebrains were then homogenized for 60 s each (Tissue Misder Homogenizer; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and processed through ultrasonication for 1 min to lyse erythrocyte membranes. The supernatant was then mixed with Drabkin\u2019s reagent (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, Mn) and were left to react for 15 min. Absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer (540 nm; Genesis 10uv; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and hemorrhagic volume (\u03bcL) was calculated based on a standard curve as routinely performed as described by (\nLekic et al., 2012\n).\n\n2.9. Intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements\nAt 4 weeks post-GMH, animals were anesthetized and mounted onto an adult stereotaxic frame. A midline incision was made to expose the atlanto-occipital membrane and the cisterna magna was punctured with a 26G Hamilton needle attached to a low-pressure transducer (Digi-Med LPA 400-low pressure Analyzer, Med-Louisville, Kentucky, USA) as described in (\nLackner et al., 2013\n).\n\n2.10. Ventricular volume\n4-weeks after GMH, animals were anesthetized and euthanized, where the whole brains were extracted and prepared for histology similar to those prepared for IHC. Brains were embedded with optimal cutting temperature solution (OCT, Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and sectioned into 24 \u03bcm thick slices. Samples were then stained with Cresyl violet solution (Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA), where then optical dissector principles were used to delineate the cerebral structure borders as previously described in (\nLekic et al., 2012\n). Morphometric analysis of samples involved hand delineation of the ventricular system which include the Lateral, third, cerebral aqueduct, and fourth ventricle. Ventricular volume was analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH). Volumes were calculated using the following equation: [(Average [(Area of coronal section) \u00d7 Interval \u00d7 Number of sections)] (\nMacLellan et al., 2008\n).\n\n2.11. Rigor and statistical analysis\nAll animals used in this study were randomly numbered and sorted into each of the indicated animal groups using Excel. The following system was used to randomly assort the animals: 1) pups are sequenced vertically in Excel; 2) \u201cRAND\u201d function was used to generate a random number to each pup; 3) reranked the random numbers in an ascending or descending order; 4) lastly designate a certain number of pups into each animal group indicated in the experimental design. The assigned animal groups were unknown to researchers conducting the indicated methodology.\nThe number of animals needed per groups was determined using type 1 error at a rate of 0.05 and a power of 0.8 on a 2-sided test by power analysis. Data was represented as mean \u00b1 SD. After normality is confirmed, parametric data will be analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test.\nP\nvalues <0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Graphpad Prism 7 was used for graphing and analyzing all data."

    "Methods": "2.1. Experimental subjects - the impact acceleration TBI model\nFor the study we used 10 to 14 week-old male C57BL/6 J wild-type mice and transgenic\nSarm1\nKO mice (\nSzretter et al., 2009\n) backcrossed to C57BL/6 J for at least 10 generations (gift from Dr. A. Hoke, Johns Hopkins University).\nSarm1\nKO mice were generated by homozygous breeding and genotyping was confirmed for each mouse by PCR. Mice were subjected to IA-TBI or sham injury (\nTable 1\n) as described with slight modifications (\nZiogas and Koliatsos, 2018\n;\nWelsbie et al., 2019\n;\nAlexandris et al., 2022b\n). Briefly, mice were anaesthetized with a mixture of isoflurane, oxygen and nitrous oxide, the cranium was exposed, and a 5mm-thick stainless-steel disc was glued onto the skull midway between bregma and lambda sutures. Then, a 50 g weight was dropped from 85 cm on the metal disk, while the mouse was placed on a foam mattress (4\u20130 spring constant foam, Foam to Size Inc., Ashland, VA), with the body immobilized with tape. The mouse was positioned with the forelimbs on the elevated platform of the foam pad. Immediately after injury the disc was removed and the skull was inspected for skull fractures. The rare animals with fractures (<2%) were excluded.The scalp incision was closed with surgical staples. Sham animals underwent the same procedure omitting the weight drop step. Neurological recovery was assessed by the presence and duration of apnea or irregular breathing (present in 46% of mice, median duration 53 s with IQR 74.5 s) and the revival of the righting reflex (median 210 s with IQR of 210 s). Subjects with apnea/irregular breathing >150 s and time to righting reflex >550 s were excluded (< 5%). With the current lesion settings and based on blood-brain barrier labeling with EZ-Link\n\u2122\nSulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin, the biomechanical disruption in the CNS associated with impact acceleration appeared to have extended beyond the brainstem to involve the upper cervical cord. While mice with this severity of injury do not typically have overt motor or other behavioral deficits following recovery, they do display substantial deficits in a pellet-reaching task (40\u201350% reduction in successful attempts; Koliatsos et al., unpublished observations). After recovery, animals were returned to their vivarium with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and ad libitum access to food and water. Surgical procedures and injuries were performed under aseptic conditions and all animal handling and postoperative procedures were carried according to protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (Protocol Number: MO19M458).\nTable 1.\nExperimental groups and histological procedures.\nExperimental Groups\nInjury and Survival\nHistological procedures\n1.

Silver staining\nMice in experimental group 1 were transcardially perfused with freshly depolymerized and filtered paraformaldehyde in PBS (4% in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4). Spinal cords were dissected and postfixed overnight in the same fixative. Tissues were embedded in gelatin, sectioned at the coronal and transverse planes (30 \u03bcm) and processed for de Olmos modified amino-cupric silver for degenerating axons (\nde Olmos et al., 1994\n) by Neuroscience Associates (Knoxville, TN). Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1) immunohistochemistry for microglia was performed on adjacent sections.\n\n2.3. Electron microscopy\nMice in experimental groups 2 and 3 were transcardially perfused with 2% paraformaldehyde/2% glutaraldehyde in 50 mM sodium cacodylate, 50 mM phosphate and 3 mM magnesium chloride buffer (pH = 7.4) for 30 min. Tissues were left in situ at room temperature for two hours before dissection of spinal cord in 1 mm blocks at C6 and post- fixation overnight at 4 \u00b0C in the same fixative. On a rotator, tissues were washed in 75 mM sodium cacodylate, 75 mM phosphate, 3 mM magnesium chloride (pH =7.4), for 15 min 5 times. To adjust osmolarity, the first two rinsing steps included 2:1 and 1:1 mixture of fixative solution and buffer at 4 \u00b0C, respectively. Tissues were then incubated in freshly prepared 2% osmium tetroxide with 1.6% potassium ferrocyanide in wash buffer for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. Tissues were rinsed in 100 mM maleate, 3.5% sucrose buffer (pH = 6.2) for 10 min 3 times. They were then incubated with 2% uranyl acetate in maleate-sucrose buffer for 1 h (dark) followed by step-wise washing steps in maleate buffer, 1:1 maleate buffer with distilled water and finally distilled water for 5 min each. Tissue blocks were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, embedded in EMbed 812 resin (\nEMS14120\n, Electron Microscope Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Semithin (1 \u03bcm) and thin (60 nm) sections were sectioned in a Leica UC7 ultramicrotome. Semithin sections were stained with 1% toluidine blue. Thin sections were mounted in square mess copper grids (EMS300-Cu, Electron Microscope Sciences, Hatfield, PA) and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed with a Hitachi H7600 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi High- Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).\n\n2.4. Stereological quantitation of axons and their pathology\nMice in group 3 were perfused and tissues were processed as for group 1. Semithin sections (1 \u03bcm) were prepared and stained with toluidine blue. Pathological axonal and myelin profiles (primarily axons with condensed or hydropic axoplasm, collapsed myelin sheaths, excess myelin figures, gross discontinuities in myelin sheath, tomacula and myelin bodies) were counted separately in the ventral, lateral, and dorsal columns on coronal semithin sections through segments C6-C7. The ventral column was defined as the region between the midline and the ventral root axons of the deltoid group of motor neurons; the lateral column was defined as the region between the lateral border of ventral column and the lateral edge of dorsal root entry zone; the dorsal column was defined as the region between the medial edge of dorsal root entry zone and the midline. Only one side of each section was used for counts, with random selection of laterality. For the quantitative assessment of the dorsal corticospinal tract (CST), an index pathway that is well delineated in the dorsal column, the latter was further subdivided into gracilis (Gr) and cuneatus (Cu) fasciculi and the CST based on the characteristic axon calibers of the corresponding axons.\nStereological analysis by an investigator blinded to experimental history was performed using the optical fractionator probe and systematic random sampling, with the aid of a motorized stage Axioplan microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.) and Stereo Investigator\n\u00ae\nsoftware (Microbrightfield Inc., Williston, VT). Regions of interest were defined at 10\u00d7 or 20\u00d7 objective. For the ventral (VC) and lateral columns (LC), myelin profiles were counted with a 40\u00d7 objective with a 11.50 \u00d7 11.50 \u03bcm counting frame, 51.43 \u00d7 51.43 \u03bcm grid, and sampling fraction of 5%. For the dorsal columns (including the CST), stereological analysis was performed at 100\u00d7 with a counting frame size of 4 \u00d7 4 \u03bcm, grid size of 17.89 \u00d7 17.89 \u03bcm and sampling fraction of 5%.\nTo quantitate intact corticospinal axons, stereological analysis by an investigator blinded to experimental history was performed at 100\u00d7. Axons were counted as apparently intact if they had normal appearance and did not meet any of the criteria for pathological profiles (as above) or display any other alterations, such as thinning or thickening of the myelin, metachromatic staining of the cytoplasm. Axon profiles with these latter milder alterations are reported as \u201cequivocal\u201d profiles.\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, Ca, USA; RRID:SCR_002798). Normality of the data was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test and statistical significance for differences between genotypes and effect of time was assessed with a two-way ANOVA test (\nF\ndf,df\n). Post-hoc multiple comparisons (\nt\ndf\n) were adjusted by the Holm-\u0160\u00edd\u00e1k\u015b method (adjusted\np\n-values are reported unless stated otherwise). Data are presented as means \u00b1 standard error of mean. Statistical significance was set at\np\n< 0.05.\n\n2.5. Quantitation and analysis of electron microscopy profiles\nFor quantitative analysis of particular axonal/myelin profiles (excess myelin figures, inner tongue evaginations), the CST was chosen as an index white matter tract, as it can be easily delineated anatomically at low magnification and has a more uniform distribution of axon calibers. In each EM grid, the random superposition of the sample on the copper grid lines, allows for an unbiased sampling of the CST region. Areas of interest were identified at low magnification (4000\u00d7) at the corners and center of each hole (90 \u00d7 90 \u03bcm) in the copper grid array; and then micrographs were captured at 20,000\u00d7(6\u20138 per case). To avoid bias due to different axon sizes, a stereological counting frame of 6.3 \u00d7 6.5 \u03bcm was fitted in Fiji (RRID:SCR_002285) and profiles were counted blind to group assignment using the cell counter plugin. For each case (\nn\n= 3\u20134 per group), about 250 axons were assessed. For the estimation of axonal morphometric parameters we used the MyelTracer software by Kaiser et al. (\nKaiser et al., 2021\n). Due to the lognormal distribution of morphological parameters, summary statistics for each case were calculated based on geometric means (\nAlexandris et al., 2022b\n).\n\n2.6. Assesment of neuroinflammation\nMice in group 4 were perfused with 4% PFA in PBS. Spinal cord segments corresponding to C6\u20137 were cryoprotected and sectioned at 50-\u03bcm thick sections with a freezing microtome. Immunohistochemistry was performed after blocking in 5% normal goat serum, 0.3% Triton X, in PBS with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against IBA1 (1:200, BIOCARE MEDICAL, # CP 290 A, RRID: AB_10578940) for two days at 4 \u00b0C, and a polyclonal goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor\n\u2122\nPlus 594 (1:300, Thermo Fisher Scientific, # A48284, RRID:AB_2896348) overnight at 4 \u00b0C.\nZ\n-stack images through the CST were captured at 20\u00d7 with a Zeiss LSM 880 (two sections per case) and analyzed with Fiji (RRID: SCR_002285). Maximum projections of the IBA1 channel were converted to binary maps by adaptive thresholding after background subtraction and Gaussian blurring, and the % area coverage were estimated for the CST."

    "Methods": "Animals:\nThe use of animals in these experiments was in accordance with the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health and the IACUC committee at the Ohio State University. Mice were kept on a cycle of 12 hours light, 12 hours dark (lights on at 8:00 AM). Experiments were performed using NFkB-eGFP reporter, which mice have eGFP-expression driven by a chimeric promoter containing three HIV-NFkB cis elements (\nMagness et al., 2004\n).\n\nOral administration of PLX5622:\nMice were fed chow formulated with PLX5622 (1200 ppm; Plexxikon; D11100404i)\nad libitum\nfor a minimum of two weeks before experiments, and this diet was continued through the duration of each experiment.\n\nInjections:\nMice were anesthetized via inhalation of 2.5% isoflurane in oxygen and intraocular injections performed as described previously (\nTodd and Fischer, 2015\n). For all experiments, the vitreous chamber of right eyes of mice were injected with the experimental compound and the contralateral left eyes were injected with a control vehicle. Compounds used in these studies are as follows: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; 1.5ul of 100mM in PBS; Sigma; M3262), recombinant mouse IL1\u03b2 (200 ng/dose; R&D systems; 401-ML) recombinant mouse TNF (250 ng/dose; BioLegend; 575204), recombinant mouse Osteopontin (OPN; 200ng/dose; BioLegend; 763604), CNTF (300ng/dose; R&D systems; 557-NT), FGF2 (250 ng/dose; R&D systems; 233-FB), Dexamethasone (Dex; 250ng/dose; MP Biomedicals; 194561), WNT4 (1ug/dose; Abcam; ab236179); CU-T12\u20139 (TLR1/2 agonist; 2.5ug/dose; Tocris; 5414), CU-CPT22 (TLR antagonist; 2.5ug/dose; Tocris; 4884), and a cocktail of three different GSK3\u03b2 inhibitors (referred to as ABC) which included 1-Azakenpaullone (1-AP; 500 ng/dose; Selleck Chemicals; S7193), BIO (500 ng/dose; R&D Systems; 3194), CHIR 99021 (500 ng/dose; R&D Systems; 4423).\n\nOptic Nerve Crush:\nOptic nerve crush (ONC) was performed as previously described (\nTempleton and Geisert, 2012\n). Dumont #N7 cross-action forceps were used to retro-orbitally compress the optic nerve for 10 seconds. Optic nerves were harvested 8 days post-ONC, fixed for 30 minutes in 4% PFA, processed for immunohistochemistry as described below, and whole-mounted optic nerves were examined using confocal microscopy.\n\nFixation, sectioning, and immunocytochemistry\nRetinas were fixed, sectioned, and immunolabeled as described previously (\nFischer et al., 2008\n;\nFischer et al., 2014a\n;\nGallina et al., 2015\n). To identify MG and astrocytes we labeled sections for Sox2, Sox9 or S100\u03b2. Antibodies to Sox2 and Sox9 are known to label the nuclei or MG in the INL and the nuclei of astrocytes at the vitread surface of the retina, whereas antibodies to S100 labels the cytoplasm of astrocytes (\nFischer et al., 2010\n). None of the observed labeling was due to non-specific labeling of secondary antibodies or auto-fluorescence because sections labeled with secondary antibodies alone were devoid of fluorescence. Primary antibodies used in this study are described in\nTable 1\n. Secondary antibodies included donkey-anti-goat-Alexa488/568 (Life Technologies A3214; A3214), goat-anti-rabbit-Alexa488/568 (Life Technologies A32731; A-11036); and goat-anti-mouse-Alexa488/568/647 (Life Technologies A32723; A-11004; A32728) diluted to 1:1000 in PBS plus 0.2% Triton X-100.\nTable 1:\nAntibody table\nAntibody\nDilution\nHost\nClone/Catalog number\nSource\nSox2\n1:1000\nGoat\nKOY0418121\nR&D Systems\nSox9\n1:2000\nRabbit\nAB5535\nMillipore\nIba1\n1:300\nRabbit\n019\u201319741\nWako Industries\nGlutamine synthetase\n1:1000\nMouse\n610517\nBD Biosciences\npERK1/2\n1:800\nRabbit\n137F5\nCell Signaling\npS6\n1:750\nRabbit\n2215\nCell Signaling\npSTAT3\n1:100\nRabbit\n9131\nCell Signaling\nS100-beta\n1:500\nRabbit\n37A\nSwant Immunochemicals\nGFP\n1:1000\nChicken\nAb13970\nAbcam\nOpen in a new tab\n\nPhotography, immunofluorescence measurements, and statistics:\nWide field photomicroscopy was performed using a Leica DM5000B microscope equipped with epifluorescence and Leica DC500 digital camera or Zeiss AxioImager M2 equipped with epifluorescence and Zeiss AxioCam MRc. Confocal images were obtained using a Leica SP8 imaging system at the Department of Neuroscience Imaging Facility at the Ohio State University. Images were optimized for color, brightness and contrast, multiple channels over laid and figures constructed using Adobe Photoshop. Cell counts were performed on representative images. To avoid the possibility of region-specific differences within the retina, cell counts were consistently made from the same region of retina for each data set.\nWhere significance of difference was determined between two treatment groups accounting for inter-individual variability (means of treated-control values) we performed a two-tailed, paired t-test. Where significance of difference was determined between two treatment groups, we performed a two-tailed, unpaired t-test. Significance of difference between multiple groups was determined using ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s test. GraphPad Prism 6 was used for statistical analyses and generation of histograms and bar graphs.\n\nscRNA-seq:\nscRNA-seq libraries from\nHoang et al. 2020\nwere analyzed. In short, retinas were acutely dissociated via papain digestion (Worthington Biochemicals). Dissociated cells were loaded onto the 10X Chromium Cell Controller with Chromium 3\u2019 V2 reagents. Sequencing and library preparation was performed as previously described (\nHoang et al., 2020\n). Gene-Cell matrices for scRNA-seq data for libraries from saline and NMDA-treated retinas are available through GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/jiewwwang/Singlecell-retinal-regeneration\nUsing Seurat toolkits (\nPowers and Satija, 2015\n;\nSatija et al., 2015\n), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensional reduction plots were generated from 9 separate cDNA libraries, including 2 replicates of control undamaged retinas, and retinas at different times after NMDA-treatment. Seurat was used to construct gene lists for differentially expressed genes (DEGs), violin/scatter plots, and dot plots. Significance of difference in violin/scatter plots was determined using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test with Bonferroni correction. Genes that were used to identify different types of retinal cells included the following: (1) M\u00fcller glia:\nGlul, Nes, Vim, Scl1a3, Rlbp1\n, (2) microglia:\nC1qa, C1qb, Csf1r, Apoe\n,\nAif1\n(3) ganglion cells:\nThy1, Pou4f2, Rbpms2, Nefl, Nefm\n, (4) amacrine cells:\nGad67, Calb2, Tfap2a\n, (5) horizontal cells:\nProx1, Calb2,\n(6) bipolar cells:\nVsx1, Otx2, Grik1, Gabra1\n, and (7) cone photoreceptors:\nGnat2, Opn1lw\n, and (8) rod photoreceptors:\nRho, Nr2e3, Arr1\n. Activated and +activated MG were identified based on elevated expression levels of\nNes, Vim, Il6, Egr1, Atf3,\nand\nTgfb2\nas described previously (\nCampbell et al., 2021\n). The \u201c+activated MG\u201d cluster is primarily comprised of MG from retinas 3hr after NMDA-treatment, the \u201cactivated MG\u201d cluster is comprised of MG from 6hr after NMDA-treatment, and the \u201creturn to resting MG\u201d cluster is comprised of MG primarily from 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72hr after NMDA-treatment (see\nFig. 1a\n\u2013\nc\n).\nFigure 1: Exogenous cytokines stimulate NFkB-signaling in MG independent of microglia.\nOpen in a new tab\nAggregated scRNA-seq libraries were prepared from WT control retinas and retinas 3h, 6h,12h, 24h, 36h, 48h, and 72h after NMDA damage\n(a)\n.

    "Methods": "All experiments were pre-approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Virginia Commonwealth University and followed the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and followed the ARRIVE guidelines.\n\nAnimals\nAdult male and female (10 weeks old at the beginning of experiments, 25-30 g) transgenic mice that conditionally expressed (or did not express) HIV-1 Tat\n1-86\nwere used. The Tat\n1\u201386\ntransgenic mouse model was developed on a C3H \u00d7 C57BL/6J hybrid background, as previously described (\nBruce-Keller et al., 2008\n). Tat expression was under the control of a tetracycline responsive (Tet-On) rtTA, GFAP-selective promoter, that was induced by exposure to chow containing 6 g/kg doxycycline (DOX; Envigo-Teklad diets, Madison, WI, USA). Tat(+) and Tat(\u2212) (controls) mice are derived from the same litter. Both Tat(+) and Tat(\u2212) mice express the rtTA element; however, Tat(\u2212) mice lack the\ntat\ntransgene. The rationale for expressing Tat under the control of a GFAP promoter was to examine the role of Tat\nper se\nin mediating sensory neuropathy (in the absence of the other HIV proteins) in which Tat expression was largely restricted to the nervous system. Despite the well-documented challenges to quantifying Tat protein, its presence in the brain of Tat(+) mice has been confirmed (\nFitting et al., 2010\n). Expression of\ntat\nmRNA is also detected in the brain (\nFitting et al., 2012\n;\nSalahuddin et al., 2021\n), spinal cord (\nFitting et al., 2012\n;\nWodarski et al., 2018\n), and in the peripheral nervous system in the dorsal root ganglion and skin (\nWodarski et al., 2018\n). All mice, including controls, had\nad libitum\naccess to DOX chow for the duration of each experiment. Water was available\nad libitum\n. Mice were housed in an AAALAC-accredited facility in groups of four. All behavioral assays were conducted by an experimenter blinded to the treatment groups. Experiments were performed during the light phase of a 12:12 h light/dark cycle (lights off at 7:00 pm). The sample size for the different experiments were determined based on our previous studies using Tat-transgenic mice to assess neuropathy (\nWodarski et al., 2018\n;\nBagdas et al., 2020\n).\n\nDrugs\nMorphine sulfate pentahydrate (Product #M8777) and gabapentin (Product #G154) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Both morphine and gabapentin were dissolved in sterile physiological saline (0.9% sodium chloride) and administered at a total volume of 10 ml/kg body weight.\n\nMechanical sensitivity (von Frey) Test\nMechanical sensitivity was assessed in a cohort of male and female Tat(\u2212) and Tat(+) mice\nprior\nto the induction of\ntat\nvia DOX diet and once weekly for 23 weeks\nafter tat\ninduction (weeks 0-23 post-DOX diet) [For Tat(\u2212) male mice n=11 per group and Tat(+), n=8 per group; For Tat(\u2212) female mice n=11 per group and Tat(+), n=10 per group]. Mechanical sensitivity thresholds were determined using von Frey filaments as previously described (\nChaplan et al., 1994\n;\nBagdas et al., 2015\n). In brief, the mechanical threshold is expressed as the grams of force required that are required to elicit hind paw withdrawal in 50% of animals.\n\nHeat Sensitivity (Hargreaves) Test\nThermal sensitivity to heat was assessed in the same cohort of mice that underwent testing for mechanical allodynia. However, thermal sensitivity was only tested once every two weeks (weeks 0-22 post-DOX diet) [For Tat(\u2212) male mice n=11 per group and Tat(+), n=8 per group; For Tat(\u2212) female mice n=11 per group and Tat(+), n=10 per group]. Thermal heat sensitivity was determined using Hargreaves\u2019 test as previously described (\nBagdas et al., 2015\n). Briefly, mice were placed in translucent plastic chambers (73 \u00d7 93 \u00d7 10 cm) on an elevated surface and allowed to acclimatize for 60 min to their environment before testing. The radiant heat source was aimed at the plantar surface of each hind paw. Paw withdrawal latency (PWL) was defined as the time from the onset of radiant heat until a withdrawal of the hindpaw occurred (20-second cutoff time). The mean of three measures was used. Thermal heat sensitivity was also expressed as the area under the curve for each group. The mechanical and thermal sensitivity studies were performed on the same cohort (cohort #1) of mice.\n\nCold Sensitivity Test\nSensitivity to cold was assessed in a second cohort of mice (10 weeks on DOX) via an acetone test as previously described (\nToma et al., 2017\n) [For Tat(\u2212) male mice n=5 per group and Tat(+), n=5 per group; For Tat(\u2212) female mice n=8 per group and Tat(+), n=8 per group].. Briefly, mice were individually caged on mesh metal flooring (Bioseb-PVF, Bioseb, Chaville, France) for 30 minutes prior to testing. 20 \u03bcL of acetone (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) was applied onto the plantar surface of each hind paw via pipette. The time spent licking, slapping, flinching, or shaking the hind paw was recorded for 60 seconds. The cold sensitivity studies were performed on a second, independent cohort of mice than in the mechanical and thermal sensitivity studies.\n\nEthological Battery\nAn ethological behavioral battery was assessed in a third separate cohort of mice (8 weeks on DOX) as a proxy to detect spontaneous pain-related behaviors. Mice were assessed for nest building, rearing, burrowing, cage-hanging, and voluntary wheel running (testing order from least to most noxious) (n = 10/sex/genotype).\nNesting.\nThe nesting procedure was adapted from prior methods (Oliver et al., 2018). All the animals were single housed two days prior to testing. At the time of testing, all previous nesting material was removed from the home cage and four half-pieces of cotton squares were placed into each corner of the cage. Nesting was scored based as such: 1=no nestlet pieces grouped; 2=nestlet pieces grouped in one or two pair; 3= three nestlet pieces grouped; 4=all nestlet pieces grouped; 5=all nestlet pieces grouped and completely shredded.\nRearing.\nRearing is a spontaneous behavior, reflecting the search phase of exploration. Animals were taken from their home cage and placed into clear cages (same dimension as the home cage but lacking bedding). Animals were allowed to acclimate for 5-min after which time, the frequency of rearing was recorded for a 30-min duration. Rearing was defined as raising both forelimbs off the ground and touching to the sides of the testing cage with hindlimbs preforming plantar flexion.\nBurrowing.\nThe burrowing assay was conducted as previously described (Deaclon et al., 2006). Empty gray tubes (20 cm long x 7 cm in diameter with ~10-degree upwards tilt) were placed in 300 mm x 234 mm x 412 mm cages (Allentown NexGen Rat 900). Cages were filled with up to 175-180 grams of fresh corncob bedding (Teklad 7097 \u00bc\u201d corncob bedding; ENVIGO). After an unrecorded training session, mice were allowed to freely explore the tube and cage for a 60-min habituation. After habituation, tubes were filled with bedding material and mice were allowed to freely explore for 30 min. The grams of bedding that were removed from the pipe were calculated.\nSpontaneous Cage-hanging.\nSpontaneous cage-hanging was adapted from a previously-described method (\nZhang et al., 2021\n). Mice were single-housed in individual cages (Allentown Micro-Vent cage) with no bedding or nesting material in front of a mirror. Cages were covered with a stainless-steel lid. Mice were video recorded for 30 min. The frequency and duration (s) of cage-hanging bouts was recorded whenever mice had at least one paw gripping the cage with no paws touching the floor. Data were expressed as % time spent hanging.\nWheel Running.\nVoluntary wheel running was assessed in polycarbonate activity wheels (21.6 cm diameter, 6 cm wide, with a steel rod axle; Lafayette Instrument, Lafayette, IN). Mice were placed by the experimenter in the wheel; mice did not have free access to it. The wheel could only be turned in a single direction. The number of rotations completed was measured over 2 h. Data are expressed as the number of full rotations completed.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and Quantification of Intraepidermal Nerve Fibers\nImmunohistochemistry was performed on a fourth separate cohort of male and female mice (8 weeks on DOX) as previously described (\nToma et al., 2017\n) (n = 8/sex/genotype). Briefly, mice were overdosed with vaporized isoflurane and then perfused transcardially with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The glabrous skin of the hind paw was excised, placed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4), and stored overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The samples were embedded in paraffin, 25-\u03bcm-thick sections cut, deparaffinized, and incubated with a UCHL1/PGP9.5 polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, Cat. # 14730-1-AP; Rosemont, IL, USA) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (heavy and light chains) secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (A11037; Life Technologies, Eugene, OR, USA). Sections were examined using a Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 equipped with a motorized XY stage, microcator and MicroBrightfield Neurolucida and Stereo Investigator image analysis software (MBF Bioscience, VT, USA). Sections were examined in a blinded fashion under 63\u00d7 magnification. Main fibers were counted in real time by dynamically focusing and following nerve fibers once they crossed the junction of the basement membrane. Density of fibers is expressed as fibers/mm.\n\nNerve Conduction Analyses\nA fifth separate cohort of male and female mice were assessed for nerve conduction (8 weeks on DOX) (n = 6/sex/genotype). As previously reported (\nMarmiroli et al., 2017\n), nerve conduction velocity and the mean amplitude of the sensory nerve action potentials of the caudal nerve were recorded using a PowerLab 4/35 electromyography system (ADInstruments, Inc, CO, USA). Anesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane in oxygen followed by 2.5% isoflurane in oxygen to maintain anesthesia (KentScientific, VetFlo\n\u2122\nanesthesia machine, CT, USA). Recording electrodes were inserted 5 mm distal from the base of the tail, and the stimulating electrodes 5.0 cm apart from the recording points. The ground electrode was placed between the two at 2.5 cm. Single square-wave pulses of 0.1 ms duration at 7 mA, and a repeat rate of 1 Hz, were used to stimulate the nerve. Nerve conduction velocity was measured in m/s and the mean amplitude of sensory nerve action potentials was measured in \u03bcV.\n\nMorphine and Gabapentin Reversal of Mechanical Hypersensitivity\nCohort #1 of male and female Tat(\u2212) and Tat(+) mice were additionally assessed for their response to morphine and gabapentin during the 23-week DOX induction [For Tat(\u2212) male mice n=11 per group and Tat(+), n=8 per group; For Tat(\u2212) female mice n=11 per group and Tat(+), n=10 per group]. Morphine and gabapentin were chosen given that they represent two different classes of well-established therapeutics that are used clinically for the treatment of breakthrough pain or neuropathy, respectively. To assess the potential for reversal of mechanical allodynia, mice were administered saline or an acute dose of morphine (6.4 mg/kg, s.c.;\nBagdas et al., 2018\n) at week 17-post DOX induction. Mechanical hypersensitivity was previously observe to be intractable to a lower morphine dose in female Tat(+) mice (3.2 mg/kg, s.c.;\nBagdas et al., 2020\n), as such a greater dose was used in the present investigation. 30 min following morphine injection, mice were assessed in the von Frey test. Cohort #1 mice were later assessed for the reversal of mechanical hypersensitivity with an acute administration of saline or gabapentin (100 mg/kg, i.p.;\nDonvito et al., 2016\n) at week 23-post DOX induction. 120 min following gabapentin injection, mice were assessed in the von Frey test.\n\nGene Expression of Cytokines and a Cytokine Mediator\nA sixth separate cohort of mice (8 weeks on DOX) (n=12/group) was assessed for mRNA expression of cytokine products and mediators in lumbar spinal cord and L4-L6 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) tissue. Tissues were collected and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. RNA isolation was performed using an Invitrogen\n\u2122\nPureLink\n\u2122\nRNA Mini Kit Ambion (ThermoFisher scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). RNA concentrations were measured using a QuBit 3.0 fluorimeter (ThermoFisher scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). cDNA was obtained via reverse transcription via an iScript\n\u2122\ncDNA Synthesis Kit (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) using 20 ng/\u03bcL RNA. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify PPAR-\u03b1 (Mm00440939_m1 ppara, ThermoFisher scientific), TNF-\u03b1 (Mm00443258_m1 Tnf), IL-1\u03b2 (Mm00434228_m1 Il1b) and IL-6 (Mm00446190_m1 Il6) mRNA expression. Expression of PPAR-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 mRNA was normalized using reference gene: GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase; Mm99999915_g1 Gapdh, ThermoFisher scientific). qRT-PCR was performed using a QuantStudio\n\u2122\n3 Real-Time PCR System (ThermoFisher scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and qRT-PCR kit TaqMan\n\u2122\nGene Expression Master Mix (ThermoFisher scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cycle threshold (Ct) value for each vial was determined using a threshold of 10-1 as predetermined by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, \u201cQuantStudio5 System\u201d- Waltham, MA). This value was chosen as it was clearly above the background fluorescence level. A melting curve analysis was performed which showed single product specific melting temperatures. No primer-dimers were generated during the 40 RT-PCR amplification cycles employed. All samples were quantified in triplicate for analyses Using the 2\n\u2212\u0394\u0394CT\nmethod (\nLivak and Schmittgen, 2001\n). All values were standardized according to the reference genes.\n\nStatistical Analyses\nData were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software version 8.0.2 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA) and are expressed as the mean \u00b1 S.E.M. Repeated experimental designs (i.e., mechanical and thermal paw withdrawal assays) were assessed via repeated measures ANOVA with \u2018sex\u2019 and \u2018genotype\u2019 as between-subjects factors and \u2018time in weeks\u2019 as the within-subjects factor. Additional, area under the curve (AUC) analyses were performed for assessment of mechanical and thermal paw withdrawal thresholds. Two-way ANOVAs (sex x genotype) were used to assess AUC, nerve fiber density, morphine or gabapentin reversal, and ethological battery behaviors. Holm-\u0160\u00edd\u00e1k\npost hoc\ntests were used to delineate main effects. Main effect contrasts were used to delineate interactions. Student\u2019s\nt\n-tests were used to assess differences between two groups on measures of nerve conduction velocity, sensory nerve action potential, and cytokine expression. Differences were considered significant when\np\n< 0.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Cell culture\nHuman EPCs (Celprogen, Torrance, CA) and human neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY5Y, ATCC, MD, USA) cell lines were used. EPCs were cultured in EPC complete growth medium with serum and antibiotics in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C as previously published (\nMa et al., 2018\n;\nWang et al., 2020b\n). The SH-SY5Y neuronal cell lines were grown under standard culture conditions in a culture media with Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium and F-12 K Nutrient Mixture (1:1), fetal bovine serum (10%), and 5% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) solution (\nLi et al., 2020\n).\n\n2.2. Generation of miR-210 overexpressing EPC-EXs\nThe miR-210 mimic was used to generate miR-210 overexpressing EPC-EXs (miR210-EPC-EXs) per our previous publications (\nMa et al., 2018\n;\nLiu et al., 2017\n). Briefly, the EPCs were transfected with miR-210-5p mimics or scramble control (Scr) (1 nmol/L, Qiagen) using Dharmafect 1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon) for 48 h in EPC complete growth medium. The complete medium was replaced with a serum-free medium for 48 h to promote the release of EXs. The culture medium was then collected for EXs isolation. EPCs cultured in serum-free medium served as control.\n\n2.3. EPC-EX isolation\nEPCs were subjected to serum starvation for 48 h to stimulate the release of exosomes from EPCs. Then, the media was collected and centrifuged at 300 xg for 6 min to remove the cell debris and the supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 xg for 70 min, to pellet microvesicles. Meanwhile, the supernatant from the previous step was collected and centrifuged at 170,000 xg for 90 min to pellet the exosomes per our previous publications (\nWang et al., 2020b\n;\nWang et al., 2016\n). The exosome pellet was suspended with 100 \u03bcL sterile-filtered phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for Nanotracking Analysis (NTA) or with the culture media for co-culture functional studies.\n\n2.4. Measurement of EX concentration by NTA\nThe concentration of EXs under different conditions was measured by NS300 instrument (Nanosight, Amesbury, UK) utilizing the light scattering and Brownian motion properties (\nWang et al., 2020b\n;\nWang et al., 2016\n). It can detect the particles of diameter from 10 nm-2 \u03bcm and concentration in the range 10\n7\n\u201310\n9\nparticles/mL. The Isolated exosomes are diluted at a concentration of 10\n7\n\u201310\n9\nparticles/mL using filtered PBS and then the sample (700 \u03bcL) was loaded into the instrument carefully without creating any air bubbles in the frame. Three videos of particle movements are recorded for each sample at a rate of 30 frames/s and at three different locations. These samples are analyzed using NTA software (version 2.5, Nanosight). The concentration of particles was calculated by considering their dilution factor.\n\n2.5. EPC-EX labeling for tracking\nTo label the EPC-EXs, PKH26, lipophilic-membrane dyes exhibiting red or green fluorescence were used per previous publications (\nMa et al., 2018\n;\nWang et al., 2020b\n). The isolated EXs were incubated with 2 \u03bcL of PKH26 (2 \u00d7 10\n\u22126\nM, Sigma-Aldrich) in 1 mL PBS for 5 min. To stop the reaction, 1 mL 1% BSA was added and incubated for one minute. The suspension was then ultracentrifuged at 170,000 x g for 90 min to obtain the fluorescent-labeled EXs. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in a cell culture medium for further coincubation experiments.\n\n2.6. Hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R) injury model for neurons\nUnder\nin-vitro\nconditions, ischemic stroke in neurons was induced by exposing the neurons to hypoxia conditions and followed by reoxygenation. Until 80\u201385% confluency the neurons are grown in a complete SH-SY5Y medium, then they were kept in a hypoxia chamber, with 1% 02, 5% CO2, and 94% N2, for 6 h. After this, the neurons were reoxygenated (37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2-standard incubator conditions) for 24 h. During the reoxygenation phase, EPC-EXs was added to neurons for co-culture (\nMa et al., 2018\n;\nWang et al., 2020b\n).\n\n2.7. Co-incubation of EPC-EXs with neurons\nDuring the phase of reoxygenation, EPC-EXs or miR210-EPC-EXs (3 \u00d7 10\n9\nEX particles/mL) were added for co-incubation. The EPC-EXs or miR210-EPC-EXs were resuspended in a complete neuron culture medium and then co-incubated with the neurons for 24 h. Following this, the incorporation rate was measured by analyzing the fluorescent intensity of EPC-EXs (labeled with PKH26) within the cells. After 24 h co-culture, the neurons were collected for various assays to determine the function of EPC-EXs.\n\n2.8. PCR analysis of the miR-210 level\nThe levels of miR-210 in the EPCs, EPC-EXs and neurons after co-incubation were determined by Real-time PCR as we previously published (\nMa et al., 2018\n;\nLiu et al., 2017\n). Briefly, the miRNA was extracted from the EPCs, EPC-EXs and neurons by using the TRIzol reagent and the RNA concentration was measured using NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA was synthesized using PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara Bio Inc.) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. qRT-PCR was carried out using miR-210 specific primers and SYBR Premix Ex Taq kit (Takara Bio Inc.) on a real-time PCR instrument (Bio-Rad). RNA U6 was used as an internal control. The RT primer: 5\u2032- GTC GTA TCC AGT GCA GGG TCC GAG GTA TTC GCA CTG GATACG AC GAC TGT \u22123\u2032. The primers of miR-210: 5\u2032- CAC GCA GTC GTA TCC AGT GCA GG \u22123\u2032 (forward); 5\u2032- CCA GTG CAG GGT CCG AGG TA \u22123\u2032 (reverse). The expression of U6 was used as an endogenous control for each sample. The primers of U6: 5\u2019-CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA-3\u2032 (forward); 5\u2019-AACGCTTCACGAATTTGCGT-3\u2032 (reverse). The expression of miR-210 was normalized to U6 and calculated using 2 \u2013 \u0394\u0394CT method.\n\n2.9. Cell apoptosis assay\nThe cellular apoptotic rate of neurons was determined by using Annexin V/PI apoptosis kit (BD Biosciences). In brief, the cells were resuspended in 100 L of Annexin V binding buffer and labeled with 10 \u03bcL of PI and 5 \u03bcL of FITC-Annexin V in the dark for 15 min at room temperature. The apoptotic cell was determined as Annexin +/PI \u2013 cells and the apoptotic percentage was analyzed using a flow cytometer (Accuri C6).\n\n2.10. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation assay\nIntracellular ROS generation, an effective method for determining oxidative stress in the cells was determined using dihydroethidium (DHE, Sigma-Aldrich) staining per our previous publications (\nMa et al., 2018\n;\nLiu et al., 2017\n). DHE is a superoxide indicator that when oxidized primarily by superoxide results in 2-hydroxyethidium. The neurons were cultured in a 6-well plate and incubated with 10 \u03bcM DHE solution (in dark) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. The cells were then observed under a fluorescence microscope and the percentage of DHE-positive cells was analyzed using the flow cytometer (Accuri C6).\n\n2.11. Cell viability measurement\nSH-SY5Y neuronal cell viability was measured using MTT-(3- [4, 5-dimethylthiazyol-2yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 5 mg/mL, Sigma) assay. To determine the cell viability of the neurons, SH-SY5Y cell lines were cultured in 96-well plates at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 10\n3\ncells/ well and injured by subjecting them to hypoxic conditions for 6 h; the cells were then re-oxygenated for 24 h, during the reoxygenation phase the neurons are co-cultured with different EPC-EXs. After co-culturing the cells with exosomes, MTT solution (20 \u03bcL) was added and incubated for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C. later DMSO (150 \u03bcL) was added and incubated for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C. On a microplate reader (BioTek, USA) optical density was read at 490 nm. The percent cell viability was calculated by comparing the relative absorbance of treated cells\nversus\nuntreated cells.\n\n2.12. Western blot analysis\nThe proteins of neurons in different co-incubation groups were extracted with cell lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The protein lysates (20 \u03bcg) were electrophoresed, transferred onto PVDF membranes and incubated with primary antibody against brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, 1:500; Abcam), Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB, 1:1000; Abcam), p-TrkB (1:1000; Abcam), NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox-2, 1:1000; Abcam), Nox-4 (1:1000; Abeam), \u03b2-actin (1:4000; Sigma) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Then all membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:40000; Jackson Immuno Research Lab) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence developing solutions and images were quantified under ImageJ software.\n\n2.13. Statistical analysis\nAll data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Two group comparison was analyzed by student t-test. Multiple comparisons were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (SPSS version 16.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA and GraphPad Prism version 9.3.0) followed by the Tukey test. For the data with non normality distribution, the non-parametric test (Kruskal-Wallis followed with with paired Mann-Whitney\nU\ntests) was used. For all tests, a\nP\n-value <0.05 was considered significant. All the data generated from the experiments were used for the statistical analysis. There are no exclusions."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nAdult Female Fischer 344 rats (2\u20133 months old, weighing 150\u2013200 g, Charles River) were used. Their inbred phenotype is an advantage for cell transplantation studies (\nLu et al., 2012\n). The rats were housed in micro-isolator cages and maintained in a light and temperature-controlled room. All animal procedures were performed according to the Drexel University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Society for Neuroscience guidelines.\n\n2.2. SCI surgery and Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) testing\nRats were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane before initiating surgery and later reduced to 2% during surgery. Since sympathetic innervation of the heart ranges from thoracic level T1 to T4, we initially attempted to completely crush the C8/T1 spinal segment to eliminate the entire supraspinal regulation of sympathetic innervation to the heart. However, rats receiving this injury could not survive long in practice, and often developed severe respiratory symptoms and forelimb paralysis most likely due to impaired control of intercostal muscles and the brachial plexus. In contrast, rats receiving a complete crush SCI at the T2/3 level, which partially interrupted the descending regulation of the heart, survived long after injury. Accordingly, a crush injury at the level of T2/3 spinal cord was selected for the experimental groups. Rats receiving T9 injury that sustains intact cardio-autonomic control and na\u00efve animals served as controls. A skin incision was made on the back, and the connective muscles were separated until the T2 spinal process was exposed. A T2 laminectomy was performed, and the T2/3 spinal segment was exposed. Subsequently, the spinal cord was crushed using fine forceps. The forceps were positioned around the spinal cord while touching the ventral vertebrae and the forceps were pressed tightly for 10 s (\nHou et al., 2018\n). For the injury control, the laminectomy was performed on the dorsal part of T8 vertebra and then the T9 spinal segment was crushed. The injury site was visually confirmed. Following the injury, the muscle layer was sutured closed, and the skin was stapled. Post-operative care was performed by administering subcutaneous injections of buprenex (0.035 mg/kg) and cefazolin (10 mg/kg). Bladder care was performed 3\u20134 times daily until sacrifice. The Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scoring was used to evaluate hindlimb locomotor function to verify the completeness of the injury in an open field prior to radio-transmitter implantation. Each rat was observed for 4 min by two trained experimenters to assess hindlimb locomotor function. Animals with a BBB score <3 were included for transmitter implantation as a low BBB score suggests no extensive tissue sparing (\nBasso et al., 1995\n). The final number of 37 rats was used: T2/3 injury,\nn\n= 12; T9 injury, n = 12; na\u00efve,\nn\n= 13. Among them, those used for heart rate variability and arrhythmia tests included: T2/3 injury,\nn\n= 7; T9 injury,\nn\n= 6; na\u00efve, n = 7, while another cohort of rats were used for pharmacological interventions of autonomic tone: T2/3 injury,\nn\n= 5; T9 injury, n = 6; Na\u00efve,\nn\n= 6.\n\n2.3. Transmitter implantation\nThree weeks post-SCI, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane, as described above. A ventral midline skin incision was made to access the abdominal cavity. The organs were pushed aside, and the abdominal aorta was exposed and separated from the vena cava. Next, a radio-transmitter (HD-S11, Data Sciences International) was placed in the abdominal cavity with the tip of its sensory catheter being inserted into the aorta. The insertion site was sealed with tissue glue. The organs were moved to their original position. The transmitter body was sutured to the abdominal wall, followed by suturing of the skin. With the help of the electrode guide, the electrode leads were subcutaneously placed with the positive lead on the lower chest and the negative lead on the upper chest respectively. The biopotential electrode leads senses the voltage changes of the heart. The catheter and electrodes record the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and electrocardiogram (ECG), respectively. Post-operative care was performed by administering subcutaneous injections of buprenex and cefazolin.\n\n2.4. ECG and blood pressure recordings and analysis\nAt least 4 days to one week after telemeter implantation surgery, ECG and MAP were recorded using the Ponemah software (V6.3, Data Sciences International). Prior to the recordings, each individual receiver was frequency-matched to a single radio-transmitter. Animals with specific radio-transmitters were placed on their individual receivers. The transmitters were switched on using a magnet. For the resting state, the pressure limit was set at a high of 200 mmHg and the ECG voltage at 2 mV. The logging (sampling) rate was set to 1 h for 24-h parameter recordings. The data from the receivers were transmitted using the radiofrequencies and further analyzed using Ponemah variability plugin and Data Insights software (DSI). It was previous reported that resting hemodynamics has diurnal rhythms in SCI rats (\nWest et al., 2015\n), the parameters recorded were thus separated to day and night for analyses, in which the data were consistently extracted as a 3-h period at a certain time, 3:00\u20136:00 pm for day and 11:00 pm-2:00 am for night.\n2.4.1. 24-h ECG recordings for heart rate variability\nECG recordings were performed for 24 h at rest. Acquired data was subjected for automated heart rate variability (HRV) analysis in time and frequency domains. The time domain exhibits information regarding the amount of variability, whereas the frequency domain subcategorizes the R-R interval into different frequencies. HRV parameters in the time domain included the standard deviation of R-R interval (SDNN), the root mean square of the R-R interval (RMSDD), the number of R-R intervals (NNx), and the proportion of R-R intervals lower than the highest R-R interval (pNNx). The time domain was interpolated by applying the default software values. For instance, the reporting period was set to 5 min, the pNNx was set to 9 ms and the maximum standard deviation for outlier removal was set to 3. The derived time domain parameters such as the SDNN and RMSSD correspond to the amount of variability in heart rate. Low SDNN and RMSDD values typically suggest low variability (\nShaffer and Ginsberg, 2017\n). The frequency domain parameters included low frequency (lf), high frequency (hf) and low-to-high frequency (lf/hf) ratio. The lf spans 0.25 to 1 Hz, while the hf ranges from 1.00 to 3.00 Hz (\nRubini et al., 1993\n). The frequency domain was calculated using the default parameters of the variability plugin of the Ponemah software, wherein the segment duration was set to 30 s and the frequency axis range was set from 0 to 5 Hz. Moreover, the normalized (n) lf or hf was calculated as \u201cnlf or nhf = lf or hf / (Total Power - vlf)\u201d to remove very low frequency (vlf) component. The lf corresponds to sympathetic activity, while the hf represents parasympathetic activity. Hence, the ratio of lf/hf provides a non-invasive method to gauge the autonomic state of an animal. If the lf/hf ratio is <1, it suggests lower sympathetic activity and therefore autonomic imbalance (\nMalik and Camm, 1990\n;\nSassi et al., 2015\n;\nLi et al., 2019\n). The calculation of HRV parameters kept consistent for all experimental groups.\n2.4.2. Pharmacological tests for cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic tone\nTo validate the data collected from HRV analysis, pharmacological interventions of the heart rate (HR) were employed to determine cardiac autonomic tone (\nLujan et al., 2018\n). Each individual rat was housed in a small cage and placed on the telemetric receiver. Basal hemodynamics was recorded for 30 min after at least 1-h equilibration. Two drugs were then sequentially administered intraperitoneally (\ni.p.\n). The recording was stopped when rats were kept in the cage for injections. The muscarinic-cholinergic receptor blockade, atropine (3 mg/kg, MCE) was delivered to block parasympathetic activity and the HR was recorded for 15 min. Because the HR response to the drug reached the peak in 10\u201315 min, only data collected within last 5 min were used for calculation (\nLujan et al., 2018\n). Subsequently, \u03b2\n1\n-adrenergic receptor antagonist metoprolol (10 mg/kg, APEX) was administered\ni.p.\nto block sympathetic tone and HR was recorded for 20 min. Likewise, only data collected within last 5 min were averaged for calculation. During this short period, animals were usually in the steady-state hemodynamics without obvious body movement. All doses of drugs were calculated relative to the body weight. Sympathetic tone was calculated as HR\nm\n\u2013 HR\ni\n, where HR\nm\nis the HR after muscarinic-cholinergic receptor blockade and HR\ni\nis the intrinsic HR after complete autonomic blockade. On the following day, animals were placed on the receiver for hemodynamic recordings again but the order of the two blockers was reversed for calculation of the parasympathetic tone, which was extrapolated as HR\n\u03b2\n\u2013 HR\ni\n, where HR\n\u03b2\nis HR after blocking \u03b2\n1\n-adrenergic receptor with metoprolol.\n2.4.3. Colorectal distention (CRD) induced autonomic dysreflexia\nAutonomic dysreflexia is accompanied by concurrently high sympathetic and parasympathetic activity after high-level SCI (\nCollins et al., 2006\n). To induce autonomic dysreflexia, a balloon-tipped catheter coated with lubricant was inserted into the rectum of each rat. The catheter, which was attached to a syringe, was secured to the tail with a tape. The rats were allowed to rest for at least 15 min while ECG and blood pressure recordings were continuously acquired. To initiate CRD, a volume of 1.4 ml of air was injected to inflate the rectal catheter within 10 s and held in for 1 min. ECG and blood pressure were recorded 1 min before, during and after CRD, respectively. The procedure was performed twice per rat. After the recording, the catheter was removed from the rectum and the rats were injected with buprenex, as previously described (\nHou et al., 2013\n;\nTrueblood et al., 2019\n). The data acquired were analyzed to obtain changes in HR and MAP. ECG recordings were examined for arrhythmias. The number of arrhythmias during CRD was counted both manually and automatically using Data Insights.\n2.4.4. Dobutamine test\nA butterfly needle connected to a catheter was inserted into the tail vein, under isoflurane anesthesia, and anchored on the tail for intravenous (\ni.v.\n) drug delivery. The rats were removed from the anesthesia and then placed into a plastic restraint tube. Subsequently, the animals were kept on their respective receivers for ECG and blood pressure recordings 1 h post-anesthesia. To mimic exercise-induced cardiac sympathetic activity, the \u03b2\n1\n-adrenergic receptor agonist, dobutamine, was administered by continuous-infusion with a syringe pump. Dobutamine was delivered in three different doses: 20, 50, and 100 \u03bcg/kg. For each dose, 100 \u03bcl of drug solution was administered continuously for 4 min during ECG and blood pressure recordings (\nDeVeau et al., 2018\n). Arrhythmias were detected using Data Insights, and the number of arrhythmias was counted during drug administration.\n\n2.5. Histology\nAnimals were anesthetized with an\ni.p.\ninjection of overdosed Euthasol and perfused transcardially with 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The spinal cord was dissected, post-fixed overnight and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Spinal cord segment was trimmed to 1 cm containing the injury site in the center and was embedded in M1 matrix (Epredia)for cryosectioning. The spinal cord was serially sectioned in a longitudinal, horizontal plane at 35 \u03bcm in three series of sections mounted on the slides. For immunohistochemistry, sections were blocked in TBS with 0.25% Triton X and 5% donkey serum for 1 h, followed by incubation with primary antibodies for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:1000, abcam) to label astrocytes, serotonin (5-HT, 1:1000, Immunostar) to label serotonergic axons, and collagen III (Col-III, 1:1000, abcam) to label collagen scars. Spinal cord sections were incubated with primary antibody overnight in 4 \u00b0C followed by incubation with AlexaFluor-488-, 594-, or 647-conjugated donkey secondary antibodies (1:500, Invitrogen). After thorough washing, the sections were coverslipped with mounting media. The slides were imaged using the fluorescent microscope (DM5500B, Leica Microsystems), connected to a digital camera (\nC11440\n, Hamamatsu), and installed with a Slidebook 6 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations).\n\n2.6. Statistical analysis\nBaseline 24 h recordings for systolic, diastolic, MAP and HR were analyzed using mixed-effect model of the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Tukey's post hoc test. CRD-induced autonomic dysreflexia was analyzed using an unpaired\nt\n-test. MAP and HR data as well as total arrythmias during dobutamine stress test were assessed using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test, whereas HRV and pharmacological data of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc\ntest\n. The number of arrhythmias during autonomic dysreflexia was analyzed and compared between groups using a non-parametric measure of Mann Whitney\nU\ntest due to non-normal data distribution. For all statistical assessment,\np\n< 0.05 was marked as significant. All data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals and chemicals\nAll experimental procedures were performed according to the principles of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Association for Biomedical Research) and approved by The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Cleveland Clinic. Experimental procedures were performed and reported in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments). All chemicals used for electrophysiology experiments were purchased from Millipore-Sigma (St. Louis, MO). C57BL/6 J adult male mice (2\u20133 months old, \u201cyoung\u201d; and 12 months old, \u201caging\u201d) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (USA) and housed in the Cleveland Clinic animal facility under a 12 h-light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum.\n\n2.2. Electrophysiology and glucose deprivation\nElectrophysiology experiments in mouse optic nerves (MON) (\nBaltan, 2014\n;\nBaltan et al., 2018\n;\nBaltan et al., 2008\n;\nBaltan et al., 2013\n;\nBaltan et al., 2011b\n;\nBastian et al., 2018a\n;\nBastian et al., 2018b\n;\nBastian et al., 2018c\n;\nStahon et al., 2016\n) and corpus callosum slices (\nBaltan, 2006\n;\nTekkok and Goldberg, 2001\n;\nTekkok and Ransom, 2004\n) were performed as previously described (\nTekkok and Goldberg, 2001\n). Briefly, animals were randomly picked and MONs were obtained from adult male C57BL/6 J mice at 2\u20133 months or 12 months of age. Following CO\n2\nasphyxiation of mice, MONs were freed from their dural sheaths, placed in a Haas top perfusion chamber (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), and superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) with the following composition (in mM): 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 2 MgCl\n2\n, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 23 NaHCO\n3\n, and 10 D-glucose, at 37 \u00b0C. MONs were allowed to equilibrate for at least 15 min in the recording chamber in normal ACSF before further experimentation, all performed at 37 \u00b0C. Glass suction electrodes filled with ACSF were used for stimulating (Isostim520; WPI, Sarasota, FL) and for recording compound action potentials (CAPs). The recording electrode was connected to an Axoclamp 900A amplifier (Molecular Devices, LLC, Sunnyvale, CA) and signals were amplified 20 or 50 times, filtered at 3 kHz, and acquired at 20\u201330 kHz (SR560, Stanford Research Systems, Sunnyvale, CA). Stimulus pulse strength (30 \u03bcs duration) was adjusted to evoke the maximum CAP possible and then increased another 25% for supra-maximal stimulation. During experiments, the supramaximal CAP was elicited every 30s.\nFor corpus callosum (CC) slice electrophysiology experiments, male C57BL/6 J mice at 2\u20133 months (young) or 12 month of age (aging), were decapitated following deep CO\n2\nanesthesia, following which the brains were dissected out immediately into ice-cold ACSF oxygenated with a mixture of 95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n. The whole brain was placed on the platform of the vibratome (Leica VT1000S, Buffalo Grove, IL) and 400-\u03bcm-thick coronal slices were cut. Only the slices (8\u201310/brain) in which the anatomical structure of the corpus callosum was visualized clearly were included in the experiments. Slices were allowed to stabilize for at least 2 h at room temperature (22\u201323 \u00b0C) before they were transferred to a Haas-type slice chamber (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) kept at 33\u201334 \u00b0C. CAPs across the corpus callosum were evoked by using a bipolar tungsten stimulation electrode (Microprobes, Gaithersburg, MD) and were recorded by an extracellular electrode filled with 2 M NaCl (\nBaltan, 2006\n;\nTekkok and Goldberg, 2001\n;\nTekkok and Ransom, 2004\n).\nAglycemia was induced by switching to a glucose-free ACSF (replaced with equimolar sucrose to maintain osmolarity). Following 60 min of aglycemia, ACSF was restored and CAPs were recorded for up to 5 h. Clampfit version 10.2 (Molecular Devices, LLC, Sunnyvale, CA) was used to measure the area under the CAP, which best represents the measure of the number of active axons (\nBaltan, 2014\n;\nBaltan et al., 2018\n;\nBaltan et al., 2008\n;\nBaltan et al., 2013\n;\nBaltan et al., 2011b\n;\nBastian et al., 2018a\n;\nBastian et al., 2018b\n;\nBastian et al., 2018c\n;\nStahon et al., 2016\n). Investigators were blinded to the groups. For comparing the CAP area between control and experimental groups, an average of 10 CAPs at baseline was measured. CAP areas from each experiment were normalized to baseline control levels for studying recovery after aglycemia. Experiments in the same group were pooled together, and the percentage of recovery was calculated in the normalized group\u2019s time course. The recovery was monitored throughout and the recovery time point at the end of experiments was used for comparison between groups.\n\n2.3. Immunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) experiments were conducted by standard methods used routinely in our laboratory (\nBaltan, 2012\n;\nBaltan et al., 2011a\n;\nBaltan et al., 2011b\n;\nBastian et al., 2018b\n;\nBastian et al., 2018c\n;\nMurphy et al., 2014\n) with MONs collected after 5 h following aglycemia. Briefly, MONs were perfusion-fixed (4% paraformaldehyde and 0.025% glutaraldehyde) and cryosectioned. Sections of 16 \u03bcm thickness were blocked in 5% normal goat/donkey (50% by volume) serum (Millipore Sigma, St-Louis, MO) and 0.3% Triton X-100 (Millipore Sigma, St-Louis, MO) for 60 min at room temperature. Sections were then incubated in primary antibody against the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) overnight at 4 \u00b0C (rabbit, Immunostat Cat No. 22522; 1:15 dilution). Secondary antibodies used were donkey anti-rabbit Cy5 and anti-rabbit Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) prepared in 2% normal goat serum for 2 h. Nuclei of these permeabilized cells were counterstained using Sytox Green Stain (EMD Millipore, Cat. No. 57020; 1:25000 dilution).\n\n2.4. Imaging and analysis\nA Leica DMI6000 inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope (Buffalo Grove, IL) was used for digital image acquisition. Argon and He\u2013Ne lasers were used to excite Sytox Green (488 nm line), Cy3 (543 nm line), and Cy5 (647 nm line). Two to three adjacent sections from each MON were imaged for a total of five areas of interest (AOI). A total of 10\u201316 optical sections, each of 1 \u03bcm thickness at 1024 pixel by 1024 pixel size, were collected in the z-axis using a 40\u00d7 (HCX APO, water immersion; numerical aperture, 0.80; Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL) objective lens under set gain, laser power, pinhole, and photomultiplier tube (PMT) settings for all groups.\n\n2.5. Lactate concentration detection\nLactate-Glo\n\u2122\nAssay (Promega #J5021 Madison, WI) was used to detect lactate concentration according to the manufacture protocols. At the end of electrophysiology experiments, MONs were flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until the day of experiment. A pair of MONs were homogenized (749540\u20130000 Pellet pestle motor, DWK Life Sciences, Millville, NJ) on ice in 75 \u03bcl of homogenization buffer (Promega #J5021 Madison, WI). A small aliquot was then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was estimated using Qubit Protein Assays (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). Homogenized samples were diluted to approximately 25 \u03bcg protein in 50 \u03bcL of dilution buffer (Promega #J5021 Madison, WI). Samples were incubated with 50 \u03bcL of Lactate Detection Reagents for 60 min at room temperature protected from light. The lactate concentration was detected using luminescence reader (Spectramax iD3, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). All samples are done in triplicate.\n\n2.6. Statistical analysis\nAll summarized data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Graphpad Prism version 5.0f (Graphpad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA) was used for statistical analysis. The number of MONs or CC slices (n numbers) required for the study was estimated using power analysis (set at 80% and \u03b1 = 0.05). Data conform to normality as per the two-tailed Student\u2019s\nt\n-tests (\nFigs. 2D\n,\n3B\n,\nD\n,\n4B\n,\nC\n,\nE\n,\nF\n,\n5B\n,\nD\n,\n6E\n,\nG\n,\nH\n,\n7E\n,\nH\n,\nG\nand\n8B\n) or one-way ANOVAs with a Newman-Keuls\npost-hoc\ntest (\nFig. 4G\nand\n5E\n) as appropriate.

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nOpn4\nCreERT2/+\nmice were a gift from Dr. Samer Hattar (NIMH) (\nChen et al., 2011\n).\nC57Bl/6J\n(stock number 000664) and Cre reporter\nRosa-CAG-LSL-tdTomato\n(\nAi14\n+/\u2212\n) (stock number 007914) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory.\nSema6A\nCreERT2/+\nmice were generated by introducing into the genome an insert containing a RAKR furin cleavage site followed by a 2xV5 tag, a P2A linker, and the CreERT2 coding sequence into the\nSema6A\nlocus just downstream of exon 19 using homologous recombination embryonic stem cell technology. The targeting construct was designed by Dr. Rebecca James in the Kolodkin laboratory, and the mouse line was generated by the Janelia Gene Targeting and Transgenic Facility.\nThe day of birth was designated as P0. Equal numbers of mice of both sexes were used in all experiments and they were housed under a 12:12 light-dark (LD) cycle. This research was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the NIH. The animal protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\n2.2. Immunohistochemistry\nMice were transcardially perfused with 1X PBS followed by 4% PFA in 1X PBS. All enucleated eyes were fixed in 4% PFA for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. Dissected brains were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C. All fixed tissue was washed several times with 1X PBS. Brains were then embedded in 3% (w/v) agarose and a vibratome was used to collect coronal sections at a thickness of 100 \u03bcm.\nFor whole mount retina and brain section staining, dissected retinas or brain sections were blocked for one hour at room temperature in 1X PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10% goat (or donkey) serum. Tissue was then incubated in primary antibody diluted in 1X PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10% goat (or donkey) serum for three days at 4\u00b0C and washed the next day for several hours with 1X PBS, 0.5% TritonX-100 at room temperature. Tissue was incubated in secondary antibody diluted in 1X PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10% goat (or donkey) serum overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed for several hours the next day with 1X PBS, 0.5% TritonX-100 at room temperature. Retinas or brain sections were then mounted and imaged using a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope.\nFor retina cross-section staining, a hole was made in the cornea of fixed eyes prior to cryopreserving overnight at 4\u00b0C in 1X PBS containing 30% sucrose (w/v). Cryopreserved eyes were embedded in Neg-50 frozen section medium (Richard-Allan Scientific, 6502) and sectioned using a cryostat at a thickness of 20 \u03bcm. Sections were washed three times with 1X PBS, 0.5% TritonX-100 before blocking for one hour at room temperature with 1X PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10% goat serum. Retina sections were then incubated in primary antibody diluted in 1X PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10% goat serum overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed the next day several times with 1X PBS, 0.5% TritonX-100 at room temperature. Sections were incubated in secondary antibody diluted in 1X PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10% goat serum overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed several times the next day with 1X PBS, 0.5% TritonX-100 at room temperature. Retina sections were then mounted and imaged with a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope.\nPrimary antibodies used in this study include: chicken anti-GFP (Aves, GFP-1020, 1:1000), rabbit anti-melanopsin (ATS, AB-N39, 1:1000), guinea pig anti-RBPMS (PhosphoSolutions, 1832-RBPMS, 1:100), rabbit anti-dsRed (Takara, 632496, 1:1000), chicken Y-RAN RFP ((\nYamagata and Sanes, 2018\n), 1:500, produced in Kolodkin laboratory by Dr. Randal Hand), rabbit anti-FLAG (Cell Signaling, 14793, 1:500), and guinea pig anti-vesicular acetylcholine transporter (Synaptic Systems, 139 105, 1:500).\n\n2.3. Intravitreal injections\nAnimals were anesthetized using isoflurane (2.5% in oxygen). A hole was made at the limbus with a 30 Gauge needle and AAV or 1 mg/ml CT\u03b2-647 (Invitrogen,\nC34778\n) was slowly injected using a syringe (Hamilton, 7634\u201301). For AAV injections, 1 \u03bcl of virus was injected for all experiments except where viruses were co-injected, in which case equal volumes of virus were mixed together and 2 \u03bcl was injected. For CT\u03b2 injections, 2 \u03bcl was injected and animals were sacrificed the following day.\nThe following viruses were used in this study: AAV2-CAG-FLEX-tdTomato (4.8 \u00d7 10\n12\nGC/ml; UNC Vector Core), AAV2-CMV-LacZ (7.0 \u00d7 10\n12\nGC/ml; UNC Vector Core), AAV2-EF1\u03b1-Lin28a-FLAG (3.81 \u00d7 10\n12\nGC/ml; Janelia Viral Tools Facility), AAV2-hSyn-FLEX-tdTomato-T2A-Syanptophysin-eGFP (2.23 \u00d7 10\n11\nGC/ml; Salk Viral Vector Core), AAV2-CAG-FLAG-Sema6A (2.41 \u00d7 10\n12\nGC/ml; Janelia Viral Tools Facility).\n\n2.4. AAV Production\nTo generate a plasmid for AAV2-CAG-FLAG-Sema6A production, a Sema3A signal sequence (SS)-FLAG-Sema6A coding sequence was amplified from pCAGGS-Sema3A SS-FLAG-Sema6A (Martin Riccomagno, Kolodkin laboratory) and inserted into pAAV-CAG-GFP (Addgene 37825) using BamH1/NotI sites. The resulting construct does not contain a Woodchuck Hepatitis Virus Posttranscriptional Regulatory Element sequence, however we found this is not required for FLAG-Sema6A expression\nin vivo\n. AAV2-CAG-FLAG-Sema6A virions were produced and titered by the Janelia Viral Tools Facility.\nThe pAAV-EF1\u03b1-Lin28a-FLAG plasmid was a gift from Xue-Wei Wang (\nWang et al., 2018\n) and was used to produce AAV2-EF1\u03b1-Lin28a-FLAG virions at the Janelia Viral Tools Facility.\n\n2.5. Tamoxifen injections\nTamoxifen solution was prepared by dissolving tamoxifen powder (Sigma-Aldrich, T5648) in 100% ethanol to a concentration of 80 mg/ml. Corn oil (MP Biomedicals, 901414) was added to make a working concentration of 4 mg/ml. For five consecutive days, this solution was administered via intraperitoneal injection into \u2265 P42 mice at 50 mg tamoxifen/kg body weight. The mass of each animal was determined on the first day of injections and was used to calculate the volume of tamoxifen solution that was delivered over the course of the five-day treatment. Sufficient volumes of working solutions for each cohort of animals were prepared on the first day of injections and stored in the dark at 4\u00b0C for the duration of the experiment. The same paradigm was followed for both genetic and viral labeling experiments.\n\n2.6. Optic nerve crush\nAnimals were anesthetized using isoflurane (2.5% in oxygen). The left optic nerve was exposed intraorbitally and crushed with jeweler\u2019s forceps (Fine Science Tools, 11251\u201320, Dumont #5) for ten seconds approximately 1 mm behind the optic disc. Animals receiving sham surgery were administered the same treatment, except the optic nerve was not crushed once it was visible.\n\n2.7. Optic nerve immunostaining\nThe iDISCO protocol (\nRenier et al., 2014\n) was used for staining and clearing, with slight modifications for optic nerves as described previously (\nBray et al., 2017\n). Dissected optic nerves were dehydrated with a methanol/ddH\n2\nO series (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%, 100%), each for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were then chilled on ice, bleached overnight with 5% H\n2\nO\n2\nin 100% methanol at 4\u00b0C, and rehydrated the next day with a methanol/ddH\n2\nO series (80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, 1X PBS), each for 30 minutes at room temperature. Nerves were incubated in 1X PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 two times for one hour at room temperature before incubating in 1X PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, 20% DMSO, and 0.3 M glycine for two days at 37\u00b0C. Nerves were blocked in 1X PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10% DMSO, 6% goat serum for two days at 37\u00b0C and then washed two times for one hour at room temperature with 1X PBS, 0.2% Tween 20, and 10 \u03bcg/ml heparin (PTwH). Samples were then incubated with a rabbit anti-RFP antibody (Rockland, 600\u2013401-379, 1:1000) in PTwH, 5% DMSO, and 3% goat serum for two days at 37\u00b0C. Nerves were washed in PTwH for 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and overnight at room temperature before incubating with a goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 antibody (Invitrogen, A21429, 1:1000) in PTwH and 3% goat serum for two days at 37\u00b0C. The solution containing secondary antibody was syringe-filtered at 0.2 \u03bcm (Corning, 431229) prior to use. Nerves were then washed in PTwH for 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and overnight at room temperature before clearing.\n\n2.8. Optic nerve clearing\nThe entire clearing procedure was performed at room temperature. Stained optic nerves were dehydrated with a methanol/ddH\n2\nO series (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%, 100%), each for 30 minutes. Samples were then incubated overnight in 100% methanol before washing the next day in 66% dichloromethane and 33% methanol for three hours. Nerves were washed twice for twenty minutes in 100% dichloromethane before clearing in a 2.0 ml Eppendorf tube completely filled with 100% dibenzylether (no shaking). Cleared optic nerves were mounted onto a cover glass with dibenzylether and imaged using a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope with a 20x objective (N.A. = 0.8). An optical zoom of 1.0x was used and each optical section was 1 \u03bcm. Raw images were stitched together using ZEN software (Zeiss).\n\n2.9. RGC axon regeneration analysis\nQuantification of RGC axon regeneration in the optic nerve was performed as described previously (\nPark et al., 2008\n;\nWang et al., 2018\n). Specifically, a maximum intensity projection of every ten consecutive 1 \u03bcm thick optical slices was made to generate a series of 10 \u03bcm thick optical sections. The number of tdTomato-positive axons was counted every 250 \u03bcm past the crush site, and the nerve diameter was measured in each optical section. The number of regenerating axons per \u03bcm of nerve width was calculated and averaged over all optical sections. \u03a3ad, the total number of axons extending distance \u2018d\u2019 in a nerve with radius \u2018r\u2019, was estimated by summing over all optical sections with thickness \u2018t\u2019 (10 \u03bcm): \u03a3ad = \u03c0r\n2\n\u00d7 (average axons/\u03bcm)/t. Only those optic nerves for which the accompanying retinas showed evidence of widespread infectivity throughout all quadrants of the retina were included in our analyses.\n\n2.10. Intraretinal axon orientation analysis\nEach quadrant of AAV-injected\nOpn4\nCreERT2/+\n,\nSema6A\nCreERT2/+\n, and\nOpn4\nCreERT2/CreERT2\nretinas with robust tdTomato labeling was imaged near the optic disc. A single optical section containing labeled axons was cropped to a size of 124 \u00d7 124 \u03bcm. The cropped region was chosen to avoid RGC cell bodies or tears in the retina.\nAll images were first processed using the smooth function in ImageJ (NIH). The dominant direction of structures, i.e. tdTomato\n+\nRGC axons, within each image was calculated using the ImageJ plug-in OrientationJ (\nRezakhaniha et al., 2012\n), as described previously (\nRosso et al., 2017\n). The resulting orientation coherency value is a way to characterize intraretinal axon remodeling following injury ranging from zero (no preferential orientation of tdTomato\n+\naxons) to one (perfectly oriented tdTomato\n+\naxons).\n\n2.11. Statistical analysis\nAll graphs were generated using Prism version 9 (GraphPad). Student\u2019s t-tests and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were performed in Prism. The threshold for statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals and Drug Treatments\nAnimal use was approved by the University of Arizona Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC; Protocol #11-252) and experiments were designed in accordance with the Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g; 3-months-old; Envigo, Denver, CO) were used in all experiments that comprised this study. We exclusively used male rats to reduce variability of our results due to sex as a biological variable. All animals were housed under standard 12 h light/12 h dark conditions and received food and water\nad libitum\n. Animals were randomly assigned into treatment groups and subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), or Sham surgery as described below. For memantine treatment experiments, animals were injected intravenously (i.v.) with either memantine (5 mg/kg; 100 \u03bcl injection volume) in 65% ethanol/35% saline; Millipore-Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or vehicle (65% ethanol/35% saline; 100 \u03bcl injection volume) via the tail vein. The dose of memantine chosen for our studies is clinically relevant and based on CNS effects observed in previous\nin vivo\nstudies in rats (\n30\n,\n31\n) The vehicle dose of ethanol selected for our experiments has been demonstrated to not induce clinical impairment via reduced motor activity or to affect respiratory drive\nin vivo\n(\nhttps://echa.europa.eu/registration-dossier/-/registered-dossier/16105/7/3/1\n). Additionally, we did not observe any overt injection site injury in any of the experimental animals included in our study. The selection of i.v. dosing for our experiments is based on the pharmacokinetic principal that therapeutically effective plasma concentrations can be rapidly achieved via i.v. dosing, which will allow administration of memantine at early time points following onset of reperfusion. This is a critical translational consideration because it is well documented that many stroke patients suffer from dysphagia and are unable to swallow in the hours immediately following onset of stroke symptoms (\n32\n\u2013\n35\n). Therefore, both memantine and vehicle were administered to experimental animals at 2 h following onset of reperfusion. Specificity of Oct-mediated transport was determined using cimetidine (15 mg/kg; 100 \u03bcl injection volume, i.v.; Millipore-Sigma), a compound that is well-known to block Oct1/Oct2-mediated transport of drugs (\n36\n\u2013\n38\n). For these experiments, cimetidine was administered to experimental animals at the same time as memantine (i.e., 2 h following initiation of reperfusion). The concentration of cimetidine was selected to be sufficiently greater than published K\ni\nvalues for OCT transporter inhibition (\n39\n), thereby enabling maximal blockade of Oct-mediated memantine uptake at the BBB.\n\nTransient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) Model\nMCAO surgery was performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats according to a previously published method (\n40\n,\n41\n) with a few modifications. Surgeries were conducted using a Leica M80 surgical microscope (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Rats were induced to a surgical plane of anesthesia using 4% isoflurane and maintained at 2.5-3% isoflurane anesthesia in O\n2\nusing a VetFlo\n\u2122\nvaporizer (Kent Scientific Corporation, Torrington, CT). Continuous blood flow was measured using a laser-doppler probe (Moor Instruments, Wilmington, DE). The probe was placed on the skull directly above the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) region (MCA: 2 mm posterior, 6 mm lateral to Bregma). Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C using a thermoregulated surgical pad (Scintica Instrumentation, London, ON, Canada) and continuously monitored using a rectal probe thermometer. Temperature maintenance is a critical consideration in MCAO studies as reduced body temperature can confound experimental results obtained from this model (\n42\n). After shaving and aseptic preparation of the surgical site with betadine and 70% ethanol, bupivacaine (0.5% (w/v), 200 \u03bcl injection volume, s.c.; Millipore-Sigma) was administered for pain management. At this time, a ventral midline incision was made on the midline over the trachea. Careful blunt and sharp dissection was performed to expose the left common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid artery (ICA) from the surrounding superficial fascia, digastric, sternohyoid, and sternomastoid muscles. After permanent ligation of the distal ECA and temporary ligation of the CCA, a small incision is made in the ECA and a silicone-coated intraluminal monofilament (0.33 mm tip diameter; Cat #503323PK10; Doccol Corporation, Sharon, MA) was inserted and advanced approximately 2 cm into the ICA to occlude blood flow to the middle cerebral artery (MCA). A decrease in blood flow of at least 75% from baseline was considered a successful occlusion via the laser-doppler probe.\nAfter 90 min of occlusion, the intraluminal filament was carefully removed to allow for restoration of blood flow (i.e., reperfusion). This MCAO time point was selected to enable generation of a severe and reproducible ischemic injury in rat brain. A successful reperfusion was characterized by an increase of 70% or more of occluded blood flow. If this benchmark was not achieved, animals were excluded from further analysis. Sham control animals underwent the same surgical procedure as MCAO animals except for insertion of the intraluminal filament. Upon removal of the intraluminal filament, the incision site was closed with absorbable sutures and all animals received local injection of bupivacaine (0.5% (w/v), 200 \u03bcl injection volume, s.c.) for post-operative pain management. All animals were placed in a socially housed recovery cage (\u2264 4 animals per cage) with clean bedding, medicated wet food (Nutra-Gel Diet\n\u2122\n(F5769-KIT); formulated with 2.15 mg carprofen; Bio-serv, Flemington, NJ) available\nad libitum\n, and thermal support via a heating pad.\n\nIn situ brain perfusion\nIn situ brain perfusion was performed as described previously by our laboratory (\n10\n,\n11\n). Following 90min MCAO/2 h reperfusion or time-matched Sham surgery, animals were anesthetized and heparinized (10,000 U/kg i.p.). The common carotid arteries were visualized using a Leica A60 microscope and cannulated with silicone tubing connected to a perfusion circuit. Since the in situ perfusion approach was performed on animals previously subjected to transient MCAO, both cannulas were inserted into the artery approximately 1.5 cm below the carotid bifurcation. This strategy ensured that the tip of the cannula would not contact the cauterized ECA stump resulting from the MCAO surgery. Visual inspection of the ECA stump ensured that no leak of perfusion buffer was present during the entire perfusion experiment. Perfusion pressure and flow rate were maintained at 95 to 105 mmHg and 3.1 ml/min, respectively. Both jugular veins were severed to allow for perfusate drainage. The perfusate was an erythrocyte-free modified mammalian Ringer\u2019s solution consisting of 117 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgSO\n4\n, 1.2 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.5 mM CaCl\n2\n, 10 mM d-glucose, 3.9% (w/v) dextran (molecular weight 60,000), and 1.0 g/liter bovine serum albumin (type IV), pH 7.4, warmed to 37\u00b0C and continuously oxygenated with 95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n. Evan\u2019s blue dye (55 mg/liter) was added to the perfusate to serve as a visual marker of BBB integrity. Using a slow-drive syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus Inc., Holliston, MA), [\n3\nH]memantine (0.5 \u03bcCi/ml; Moravek Biochemicals Inc, Brea, Ca) was added to the inflowing perfusion solution at a rate of 0.5 ml/min per cerebral hemisphere, which resulted in a total flow rate of 3.6 ml/min. For inhibition studies, animals were perfused with Ringer\u2019s solution containing transport inhibitor (i.e., 25 \u03bcM cimetidine) for 10 min prior to perfusion with [\n3\nH]memantine. We have previously confirmed the stability of transport substrates and sucrose in both perfusion medium and in jugular vein venous outflow and have shown that they remain intact in our\nin situ\nperfusion experiments (\n9\n,\n43\n,\n44\n). Since the BBB is known to be compromised in the setting of experimental stroke, all perfusions conducted in tMCAO or Sham-operated animals involved co-perfusion with [\n14\nC]sucrose (0.5 \u03bcCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Sucrose is a small molecular weight vascular marker that does not cross the intact BBB (\n45\n). Therefore, this approach enables us to account for changes in paracellular \u201cleak\u201d, which can affect drug uptake into the brain in the tMCAO model.\nImmediately following perfusion for the desired time (i.e., 10 min), rats were decapitated, and brains were removed. The meninges and choroid plexus were excised, and cerebral hemispheres were sectioned and labeled as ipsilateral or contralateral. TS2 tissue solubilizer (1.0 ml; Research Products International, Mt. Prospect, IL) was added to the tissue samples, which were allowed to solubilize for 2 days at room temperature. To eliminate chemiluminescence, 100 \u03bcl of 30% glacial acetic acid was added, along with 2.0 ml of Optiphase SuperMix liquid scintillation cocktail (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Boston, MA). Radioactivity was measured using a model 1450 Liquid Scintillation and Luminescence Counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). Results were reported as picomoles of radiolabeled transport substrate (i.e., memantine or sucrose) per milligram of brain tissue (RBr; pmol/mg brain tissue), which is equal to the total amount of radioisotope in the brain [R\nBrain\n; dpm/mg tissue] divided by the amount of radioisotope in the perfusate [R\nPerfusate\n; dpm/pmol]:\nRBr\n=\nR\nBrain\n/\nR\nPerfusate\n(Equation 1)\nThe brain vascular volume in rats has been previously shown to range between 6 and 9 \u03bcl/g brain tissue in perfusion studies utilizing a saline-based bicarbonate buffer (\n46\n). Since brain tissue was processed immediately after perfusion with radiolabeled substrate, all uptake values require correction for brain vascular volume (i.e., 8.0 \u03bcl/g brain tissue as calculated from data reported by Takasato and colleagues) from whole-brain uptake data obtained using radiolabeled memantine or sucrose.\n\nBrain Microvessel Isolation\nMicrovessels were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rat brain tissue using a protocol developed in our laboratory (\n47\n). All steps were performed on ice at 4\u00b0C to minimize degradation of proteins during tissue processing. Following euthanasia by decapitation, brains were isolated from the skull and meninges and choroid plexus were removed. Cerebral hemispheres were separated into ipsilateral and contralateral cortices and then homogenized at 3,700 x\ng\nin 5 ml brain microvessel buffer (300 mM mannitol, 5 mM EGTA, 12 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). At this time, 8 ml 26% (w/v) dextran (MW 75,000; Spectrum Chemical Manufacturing Corporation, Gardena, CA) solution was added to each homogenate sample. Samples were then thoroughly vortexed and centrifuged at 5,000 x\ng\nfor 15 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was then aspirated, and capillary pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of brain microvessel buffer. Dextran homogenization and centrifugation steps were repeated an additional three times to ensure appropriate quality of microvessels. Following completion of dextran homogenization and centrifugation, the supernatant was aspirated and the microvessel pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of brain microvessel buffer. At this time, samples consisting of enriched whole microvessels were subjected to total membrane isolation. For total membrane isolation, samples were homogenized at 3,700 x\ng\n, placed into ultracentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 150,000 x\ng\nfor 60 min at 4\u00b0C. Pellets containing total cellular membranes were resuspended in 500 \u03bcl of storage buffer (50% brain microvessel isolation buffer; 50% diH\n2\nO, v/v) containing 0.1% protease inhibitor cocktail. Samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further use. We have previously confirmed purity of our microvessel preparations by demonstrating enrichment in platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1; also known as CD31) as compared to expression of astrocyte marker proteins (i.e., glial fibrillary acidic protein) or neuronal marker proteins (i.e., synaptophysin) (\n11\n,\n47\n,\n48\n).\n\nWestern Blotting\nWestern blotting was performed as previously described(\n10\n) with a few modifications. Total cellular membrane samples from isolated microvessels were quantified for total protein using Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and heated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min under reducing conditions (i.e., 2.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) in 1X Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Following SDS-PAGE and transfer, PVDF membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies against Oct1 (anti-Oct1; 0.27 mg/ml at 1:750 dilution; Cat #24617-1-AP; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), or Oct2 (anti-Oct2; 4.0 mg/ml at 1:1000 dilution; Cat #PA5-112715; ThermoFisher Scientific). For western blot experiments on microvessel samples from control (i.e., untreated) rats, Oct1 and Oct2 bands were normalized to \u03b1-tubulin, which was detected using a primary antibody previously validated in our laboratory (anti-\u03b1 tubulin; 1 mg/mL at 1:20,000 dilution; Cat #ab7291; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Since ischemic conditions can cause fluctuations in loading control proteins commonly used for brain microvascular samples (\n49\n), all western blot data derived from microvessel samples from Sham and tMCAO animals were normalized to total protein using Ponceau S staining as recommended by Fosang and Colbran (\n50\n). Membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:40,000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) or anti-mouse IgG (1:50,000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 60 min at room temperature. Control western blot experiments to confirm antibody specificity were performed in the presence of secondary antibody only (i.e., absence of primary antibody). Protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal West Pico, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Bands were quantitated using ImageJ software (Wayne Rasband, Research Services Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD), normalized to tubulin or total protein, and reported as relative values.\n\nTTC staining\nTo identify viable and nonviable brain tissue, TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride) staining was used in accordance with a previously published method (\n41\n,\n51\n). TTC staining provides a reliable colorimetric redox indicator of healthy versus damaged (infarct core and penumbra) brain tissue that results from an ischemic insult. Specifically, tissue containing viable mitochondria is stained dark red while infarcted brain tissue remains unstained (i.e., white).\nAfter 90 min MCAO followed by 70.5 h reperfusion, animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (K: 50 mg/kg; X: 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and decapitated using a guillotine. The brain was quickly harvested and sectioned using an ice-cold (4\u00b0C) brain matrix that enables preparation of 1 mm brain slices in the rostral-to-caudal direction. The slices were then incubated in TTC (2% (w/v) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37\u00b0C) for approximately 5 minutes. Slices were then removed from TTC stain, rinsed with PBS (pH 7.4), and imaged. Brain slice images were analyzed for infarction volume and cerebral edema using Image J software. As previously described(\n41\n), we measured three areas of each brain slice: infarct area (X) (mm\n2\n), area of the infarcted cerebral (i.e., ipsilateral) hemisphere (Y) (mm\n2\n), and the area of the non-infarcted (i.e., contralateral) hemisphere (Z) (mm\n2\n). Brain infarction areas were corrected for brain edema and percent (%) brain edema was calculated using:\n[\n(\nY\n\u2212\nZ\n)\n/\nZ\n]\n\u00d7\n100\n%\n(Equation 2)\n\nNeurological Deficit Scoring\nStroke severity was assessed after 90 min MCAO/22.5 h reperfusion (24 h total time point) and 90 min MCAO/70.5 h reperfusion (72 h total time point) using neurological deficit scores (i.e., functional neuroscore analysis) modeled upon the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). This four-point scale awarded a single point for each one of three identifiable motor impairments: i) unilateral circling; ii) retraction of the right front paw; and iii) resistance to horizontal push on the laboratory bench. An animal with a score of \u201c0\u201d was deemed to be not impaired while an animal with a score of \u201c3\u201d was reported as severely impaired.\n\nRotarod Motor Performance Test\nFunctional motor performance was assessed using the Rotarod motor performance instrument (760772 Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Rats were placed on a constantly rotating drums at a speed of 8 rpm. Animals were trained on the Rotarod instrument at least 24 h prior to MCAO or Sham surgery. The time each rat maintains balance on the rod was recorded and defined as a \u201clatency to fall (LTF)\u201d score. An experimental cut off at 180 s was used for all rotarod experiments.\n\nRandomization, Blinding, and Statistical Analysis\nA pre-determined randomization schedule was generated based on treatment groups and the randomization schedule was followed with an intent to treat. Animals that did not complete the protocol because of mortality, early euthanasia, or technical problems were replaced before continuing the randomization sequence. The individual performing the experimental protocol was blinded to drug treatment and to treatment with vehicle. All data are reported as mean \u00b1 SD of six individual animals per treatment group (n = 6). Statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Dunnett\u2019s Multiple Comparison test. A value of\np\n< 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Experimental Design\nA schematic of the experimental design, including experimental controls, assessments of goal-directed behaviors and synaptic dysfunction, is presented in\nFigure 1A\n.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\n(\nA\n) Experimental Design Schematic (\nB\n) Illustration of the definitions (i.e., number of running bouts, running bout length) utilized for the bout microstructural analysis. Each box represents a one-min bin of activity (i.e., running bout) or disengagement. A running bout was defined as the performance of at least one wheel revolution during consecutive one-min bins. Running bout length was the number of consecutive one-min bins during which an animal was active.\n\nAnimals\nGoal-directed behaviors, indexed using voluntary wheel running, were evaluated in ovariectomized (OVX) female Fischer (F344/N; Harlan Laboratories Inc., Indianapolis, IN) HIV-1 Tg (\nn\n=21) and control (\nn\n=26) animals. Prior to arrival at the animal facility, animals were OVX at Harlan Laboratories. Given that estrous cycle profoundly impacts voluntary wheel running behavior (e.g.,\nWang, 1923\n;\nSteiner et al., 1981\n;\nBasso & Morrell, 2017\n), female animals were OVX and fed a minimal phytoestrogen diet (\u226420 ppm; Teklad 2020X Global Extruded Rodent Diet (Soy Protein-Free)). HIV-1 Tg and control animals were delivered to the animal vivarium between postnatal day (PD) 45 and PD 60 and pair- or group-housed throughout the duration of the experiment. Rodent food and water were available\nad libitum.\nAnimals were maintained in AAALAC-accredited facilities using the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Conditions of the animal colony were targeted at 21\u00b0 \u00b1 2\u00b0 C, 50% \u00b1 10% relative humidity and had a 12-h light: 12-h dark cycle with lights on at 0700 h (EST). The project protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of South Carolina (Federal Assurance: #D16-00028).\n\nExperimental Controls\nSomatic Growth: Body Weight\nBody weight, an index of somatic growth, was measured five days per week for the duration of the study.\nIntegrity of Gross Motoric System Function: Locomotor Activity\nApparatus.\nPerspex inserts were utilized to convert square (40 \u00d7 40 cm) activity monitors (Hamilton Kinder, San Diego, CA) into round (~40 cm diameter) compartments. Free motor movement was detected using infrared photocells (32 emitter/detector pairs) which were spaced approximately 2.5 cm apart. The manufacturer tuned the infrared photocells to maintain their sensitivity with the additional perspex insert.\nProcedure.\nPrior to beginning assessments of goal-directed behaviors, locomotor activity, an index of gross motoric system function, was evaluated weekly for seven consecutive weeks. Assessments were conducted using a 60-min test session from 1200 h to 1600 h in an isolated room. Dim light conditions (<10 lx) and background white noise (70 dB(A)) were present throughout the duration of testing. Gross motoric system function was evaluated using the total number of photocell interruptions within the 60-min test session.\n\nGoal-Directed Behaviors: Voluntary Wheel Running\nApparatus\nA 34 cm diameter running wheel was attached to the lid of a polypropylene rectangular chamber (45.5cm long, 24cm wide, and 20.5cm deep). Wheel revolutions were recorded by Vital View 4.0 (Mini Mitter Inc., Bend, OR) magnetic sensors, which were integral to the lid and wheel. The number of wheel revolutions during each minute of testing was collected for analysis.\nProcedure\nDiurnal Voluntary Wheel Running.\nVoluntary wheel running in HIV-1 Tg and control animals was evaluated during the diurnal phase (i.e., 1200 h to 1700 h) of their light-dark cycle. Animals had daily access to the running wheel apparatus, which was located in an isolated room with low-light conditions (<10 lx), for approximately 66-min. Diurnal running was continued until the overall genotype mean for the total number of meters run was stabilized for three consecutive weeks. In total, the diurnal voluntary wheel running phase was 35 days (5 weeks).\nNocturnal Voluntary Wheel Running.\nAfter reaching stability during the diurnal phase of their light-dark cycle, HIV-1 Tg and control animals were assessed during the nocturnal phase (i.e., 19:00 h to 2400 h) using the procedures and criteria described above. The nocturnal voluntary wheel running phase was 56 days (8 weeks).\nDeprivation/Reinstatement.\nFollowing three weeks of stabilized nocturnal voluntary wheel running behavior, running wheels were locked to prevent rotation in a dose-response manner (i.e., 1, 2, or 3 days). During nocturnal deprivation, HIV-1 Tg and control animals were placed in the apparatus with a locked running wheel for approximately 66-min. Reinstatement responses were recorded by providing access to the running wheel for one day after each wheel-locking dose. The number of days the wheels were locked was presented in an ascending manner.\nNocturnal Voluntary Wheel Running.\nAfter the final reinstatement response recording, nocturnal voluntary wheel running assessments were conducted for an additional five days.\nDiurnal Return.\nThe overarching goal of the diurnal return was to determine whether differences in the average number of meters run per day during the diurnal and nocturnal phases were due to learning or entrainment to the circadian cycle. HIV-1 Tg and control animals were returned to a diurnal voluntary wheel running schedule for 1 week (7 days).\nBout Microstructural Analysis\nA bout microstructural analysis was conducted by parceling running behavior into 1-min blocks of activity (i.e., running bout) or disengagement using methodology similar to previous reports (\nEikelboom & Mills, 1988\n;\nFigure 1B\n). A running bout was defined as the performance of at least one wheel revolution during consecutive one-min bins. Two key components of running bouts were extrapolated, including the total number of running bouts in a session and the average running bout length, to evaluate motivational and gross-motoric system alterations, respectively (for review, Shull et al., 2011).\n\nSynaptic Dysfunction: Medium Spiny Neurons of the Nucleus Accumbens Core\nTissue Preparation\nAfter the completion of their final voluntary wheel running assessment, HIV-1 Tg and control animals were deeply anesthetized with sevoflurane (Abbot Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) and transcardially perfused using the methodology reported by\nRoscoe et al. (2014)\nwith two minor modifications. Specifically, post-fixation occurred in 4% chilled paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes and 1000 \u03bcm thick coronal sections were cut using the rat brain matrix (ASI Instruments, Warren, MI).\nPreparation of Tefzel Tubing and DiI Cartridges\nA polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) solution was prepared by dissolving 100 mg of PVP in ddH\n2\nO. The PVP solution was drawn into Tefzel tubing (70 cm; IDEZ Health Sciences, Oak Harbor, WA), allowed to coat for at least 10 minutes, and was removed.\nDiOlisitic cartridges were prepared by separately dissolving 175 mg of tungsten beads (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and 7 mg crystallized DiI in 99.5% methylene chloride. After applying the tungsten bead solution to a glass slide, the DiI solution was titrated on top; the two solutions were mixed slowly and allowed to completely dry. The dye/bead mixture was scraped into two 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes with 1.5 mL ddH\n2\nO and sonicated until homogenous. The homogenized mixture from the two 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes was combined in a 15 mL conical tube and sonicated further before being drawn into the PVP coated Tefzel tubing. Once filled with the homogenized tungsten beads-DiI solution, the Tefzel tubing was loaded into the tubing prep station (Bio-Rad, Hercules CA) and rotated for 5 minutes. The remaining water was slowly drawn from the tubing. Nitrogen gas was turned on at a flow rate of 0.4 L/min and the tubing was rotated for an additional 30 minutes. Tubing was cut into 13 mm lengths and stored in the dark.\nDiOlistic Labeling and Confocal Imaging\nBrain tissue, located approximately 3.24 mm to 0.48 mm anterior to Bregma (\nPaxinos & Watson, 2014\n), was ballistically labeled and mounted using the procedures reported by\nRoscoe et al. (2014)\n. For each animal, multiple (i.e., 3\u20135) Z-stack images of the DiOlistically labeled MSNs were taken using a Nikon TE-2000E and Nikon\u2019s EZ-C1 computing software (v. 3.81b). Sholl analysis, dendritic branching complexity, and dendritic spine morphology analyses were conducted on one neuron from each animal; neurons were blinded to tissue genotype to prevent experimenter bias. Neurons included in the analysis were selected based on established selection criteria (\nLi et al., 2020\n), yielding Control,\nn\n=19 and HIV-1 Tg,\nn\n=12. Selected neurons were analyzed using the AutoNeuron and AutoSpine extension modules within Neurolucida360 (MicroBrightfield, Williston, VT).\nNeuronal and Dendritic Spine Analyses\nMorphological parameters of MSNs in the NAcc were examined using two complementary measures, namely Sholl analysis (\nSholl, 1953\n) and dendritic branch ordering. For the Sholl analysis, concentric circles were placed at 10 \u03bcm radius intervals and the number of intersections at each successive radii were measured. For dendritic branch ordering, the number of segments at branch orders 1 through 10 were evaluated; branch orders were assigned using a centrifugal branch ordering method.\nDendritic spine morphology was evaluated using continuous measurements of three parameters, including backbone length (\u03bcm), head diameter (\u03bcm) and neck diameter (\u03bcm). Dendritic spines were included in the analysis based on previously reported results (i.e., backbone length, 0.2 to 4.0 \u03bcm (\nFern\u00e1ndez-Cabrera et al., 2018\n); head diameter, 0.0 to 1.2 \u03bcm (\nShen et al., 2008\n); volume, 0.05 to 0.85 \u03bcm\n3\n(for review,\nHarris & Kater, 1994\n).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression techniques were utilized for the statistical analysis of all data (SAS/STAT Software 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC; SPSS Statistics 27, IBM Corp., Somer, NY; GraphPad Prism 5 Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Potential violations of sphericity were precluded by the use of either orthogonal decompositions or the conservative Greenhouse-Geisser\ndf\ncorrection factor (\np\nGG\n;\nGreenhouse & Geisser, 1959\n). Sample sizes were selected to maximize the likelihood of detecting genotypic alterations in voluntary wheel running and neuroanatomical measures with statistical power of 0.80 at\np\n\u22640.05. Statistical significance was evaluated at a\np\nvalue of 0.05.\nFor ANOVA analyses, genotype (HIV-1 Tg vs. control) served as the between-subjects factor, while time (e.g., age, weeks, day), radius, branch order, or bin served as the within-subjects factor, as appropriate. For the deprivation/reinstatement phase, the dependent variable of interest after either one, two, or three days of wheel locking were compared to the average total number of meters run during week 13 (i.e., the final week of nocturnal voluntary wheel running cooresponding to Day 91). Figures for the microstructural analysis during deprivation/reinstatement phase illustrate the reinstatement response collapsed after one, two, or three days of wheel locking.\nExperimental controls, including both body weight and locomotor activity, were analyzed using a mixed-model ANOVA (SPSS Statistics 27) and regression techniques (GraphPad Prism 5 Software, Inc.).\nAt the macrostructural level, the dependent variable of interest was the total number of meters run. The total number of meters run during an individual daily session were averaged across seven days for the statistical analysis. A mixed-model ANOVA (SPSS Statistics 27) and complementary regression techniques (GraphPad Prism 5 Software, Inc.) were conducted to analyze voluntary wheel running behavior at the macrostructural level.\nAt the microstructural level, two dependent variables, including running bout number and running bout length, were investigated to evaluate motivational and gross-motoric alterations, respectively. The number of running bouts and running bout length during an individual daily session were averaged across seven sessions for the statistical analysis. Running bout number during the diurnal, nocturnal, and deprivation/reinstatement phases were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed effects model with a Poisson distribution and unstructured covariance structure (PROC GLIMMIX; SAS/STAT Software 9.4). For the diurnal voluntary wheel running phase, the number of running bouts were squared to transform the data. Running bout lengths were analyzed using a mixed-model ANOVA (SPSS Statistics 27). Additionally, complementary regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the functional form of the cumulative frequency of running bout number and running bout length.\nGenotypic alterations in neuronal and dendritic spine morphology were examined to evaluate synaptic dysfunction. The number of intersections at successive radii, a dependent variable derived from the Sholl analysis, was analyzed using a mixed-design ANOVA with a variance components covariance structure, a random intercept, and a random slope (i.e., Radius;\nWilson et al., 2017\n; PROC MIXED; SAS/STAT Software 9.4). The number of dendritic branches at each successive branch order, the number of dendritic spines between radii, and morphological characteristics of dendritic spines (i.e., Backbone Length, Head Diameter, Neck Diameter) were examined using a generalized linear mixed effects model with a Poisson distribution and unstructured covariance structure (PROC GLIMMIX; SAS/STAT Software 9.4). Notably, only dendritic spines with a head diameter greater than 0.01 \u03bcm were included in the figure and analysis of dendritic spine head diameter.\nMultiple linear regression analyses (SPSS Statistics 27, IBM Corp., Somer, NY; GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA) were conducted to evaluate the association between synaptic dysfunction and the self-initiation of spontaneous behaviors (Control,\nn\n=19; HIV-1 Tg,\nn\n=12). The three dependent variables of interest were the average number of running bouts, an index of the self-initiation of spontaneous behaviors, during the diurnal, nocturnal, and deprivation/reinstatement phases. Independent variables included measures of synaptic dysfunction that exhibited a statistically significant genotype effect (i.e., Number of Dendritic Spines Between Radii, Relative Frequency of Dendritic Branches at Each Branch Order, Number of Dendritic Spines Within Each Bin for Backbone Length, Head Diameter, and Neck Diameter).\n\nData Availability Statement\nAll relevant data are within the paper."

    "Methods": "2.1. Overview of experimental design\nWe used an established focal ischemic stroke mouse model which targets the right sensorimotor cortex to study the effects of CS-A encapsulation of NPCs for the treatment of stroke (\nWei et al., 1995\n). CS-A hydrogels were synthesized to match brain tissue mechanical properties as previously described, and mouse-induced pluripotent stem cells underwent the 4\u2212/4+ retinoic acid differentiation protocol which produces neuronal lineage committed NPCs (\nKarumbaiah et al., 2015\n;\nBain et al., 1996\n). Intracranial transplantations (2 \u03bcL, 100 k cells/ \u03bcL) were performed into the ischemic core and peri-infarct regions 7d after stroke, and animals were sacrificed 7d or 14d after transplantime pointsese timepoints were selected to avoid the initial early wave of inflammation thought to result in blood-brain-barrier disruption, edema, neuronal death, and hemorrhagic transformation, and to instead encourage regenerative processes of neurovascular recovery which peaks over the course of 1\u20133 weeks (\nJin et al., 2010\n;\nKriz, 2006\n;\nJin et al., 2013\n;\nPerera et al., 2006\n;\nNakase et al., 2008\n). Adult male mice (C57BL/6 J) were treated with sham transplantations (stroke control), NPCs, CS-A gel loaded with NPC media, or the combined CS-A encapsulated NPCs (CS-A + NPCs).\n\n2.2. Neural progenitor cell culture\nMouse-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (iPSC-NPCs) were differentiated from iPSCs originally generated from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Stemgent Inc., Cambridge, MA) as previously described (\nChau et al., 2014\n). This line of iPSC-NPCs expresses GFP to permit tracking following transplantation. iPSCs were cultured in the N2/B27 supplemented serum-free medium at 20% O2, 5% CO2, at 37 \u00b0C. The medium was prepared with 45% Dulbecco\u2019s modified eagle medium: nutrient mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12; Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO), 45% Neurobasal (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.5% N2 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% B27 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% GlutaMAX, 1% nonessential amino acids (Sigma Aldrich), 0.1 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (\u03b2-ME; Sigma Aldrich), 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma Aldrich), 5% knockout serum replacement (KSR; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The small molecules were recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; 10 ng/mL; Millipore, Billerica, MA), CHIR 99021 (3 \u03bcM; Tocris), (\nS\n)-(+)-Dimethindene maleate (2 \u03bcM; Tocris) and minocycline hydrochloride (2 \u03bcM; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Before differentiation, the iPSCs were cultured in DMEM (Sigma Aldrich), 10% ES-FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), GlutaMAX, nonessential amino acids, nucleoside mix, LIF, \u03b2-ME (Sigma Aldrich), LIF, b-ME, and penicillin/streptomycin. All cells used in this study were harvested and ready for transplantation after an established \u20184\u2212/4+\u2019 retinoic acid (RA, 1 \u03bcM; Sigma Aldrich) neural differentiation protocol.\n\n2.3. Mouse focal ischemic stroke model\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Emory University and are in accordance with the NIH and Animal Research: Reporting of\nIn Vivo\nExperiments (ARRIVE) guidelines. Before and after surgery, the animals were housed at 4\u20135 animals per cage, with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. The mouse focal ischemic stroke model was performed as previously described using C57BL/6 J mice (8\u201312 weeks) from Jackson Laboratories (\nWei et al., 2017\n;\nWei et al., 1995\n). Cortical ischemia was achieved by permanent occlusion of the distal branches of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) supplying the sensorimotor cortex. The MCA occlusion was paired with 7-min ligation of both common carotid arteries (CCAs) to cause sufficient reduction of local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) in the sensorimotor region and followed by partial reperfusion. This creates a focal area of ischemic in the right sensorimotor cortex which has been employed successfully in our other stroke studies (\nMcCrary et al., 2020\n;\nJiang et al., 2017\n;\nLee et al., 2016\n;\nChoi et al., 2012\n). Body temperature was monitored during surgery and recovery period using a rectal probe. The temperature was maintained at 37 \u00b0C on a homoeothermic blanket for 1 h after emergence from anesthesia. In this stroke model, necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy occur at various timepoints up to a week after infarction (\nJiang et al., 2017\n). At 7 days after stroke, there is an increase in microglia/macrophages in the ischemic core region. Additionally, at this same time point, released factors such as BDNF and VEGF could be detected in the stroke core region.\n\n2.4. Intracerebral transplantations\nSeven days after stroke surgery, mice skulls were thinned over the visible region of the stroke core, and 200,000 cells suspended in 2 \u03bcL medium or 200,000 cells loaded into 2 \u03bcL CS-A hydrogel, or 2 \u03bcL CS-A hydrogel with medium only were loaded into a Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) and injected at a depth of 1 mm from the skull. As previously described in other works, lyophilized 5% (\nw\n/\nv\n) CS-A hydrogels that were synthesized by 2-hydroxy-4\u2032-(2- hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone (Irgacure-2959, Sigma-Aldrich) initiated photo-crosslinking of methacrylate chondroitin sulfate (mCS), were rehydrated in either media or cell suspension prior to intracerebral injections. SAX-HPLC analysis of CS used in these studies was previously determined to consist primarily of CS-A (86%), with minor traces of other sulfated CS-GAG species (\nMcCrary et al., 2020\n;\nKarumbaiah et al., 2015\n). The number and volume of cells injected was shown to be safe and effective in our published studies (\nMcCrary et al., 2020\n;\nChau et al., 2014\n).\n\n2.5. Immunohistochemistry and image analysis\nAnimals were sacrificed by decapitation and brains were immediately removed and immersion fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 72 h, dehydrated in 30% sucrose, and sliced into 10 \u03bcm thick coronal sections using a cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Cell counting followed the stereology principle to avoid repeated cell counts. For systematic random sampling in design-based stereological counting, every 10th (90 \u03bcm apart) brain section across the entire region of interest was counted. For multi-stage random sampling, six fields per brain section were randomly chosen under 10, 20, or 40\u00d7 magnification of an epifluorescence microscope or in confocal images. The sections were air dried and fixed with 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Brain sections were then submerged in an ethanol/acetic acid solution (2:1) for 10 min, washed 3 times with 1\u00d7 PBS solution, and incubated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 45 min. Slides were then blocked with 1% fish gelatin (diluted in PBS; MilliporeSigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were incubated with, IBA-1 (1:400, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), and PPAR-gamma (1:400, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) primary antibodies diluted in PBS at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Primary antibodies were washed with PBS and replaced with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor488 goat anti-mouse (1:300; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rat (1:300; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature before rinsing with PBS. After a final PBS wash, slides were mounted with Vectashield fluorescent mounting medium (Vector Laboratory, Burlingame, CA), and cover-slipped for microscopy and image analysis. Blinded stereological counting was performed on 6 randomly chosen microscope images of the stroke core region per section, and 6\u20138 sections were analyzed per animal. The number of PPAR-gamma and IBA-1 co-labeled cells were counted.\n\n2.6. Sholl analysis of microglia/macrophages\nStereologically matched images of coronal brain sections stained with IBA1 were used to compare microglia morphology using Sholl analysis\nvia\nthe Image J plugin (Image J, NIH). Briefly, concentric circles were manually drawn around the center of the soma using the concentric circles plugin (Image J, NIH). Cell soma area was measured and recorded (Image J Analysis, NIH).\n\n2.7. Western blot analysis\nThe stroke region was homogenized using Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (M-PER) Lysis buffer with phosphatase and proteinase inhibitors (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Tissue samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was isolated. Protein concentration was determined using the Bicinchoninic Acid Assay (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Protein samples were loaded into 12% polyacrylamide gels and separated\nvia\nsodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in a Hoefer Mini-Gel system (Amersham Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ). Protein was then transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Membranes were blocked using 5% BSA diluted with TBS and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature for 1 h, then incubated overnight with primary antibodies for bFGF (1:500, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), IBA-1 (1:400, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), VEGFR2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), TIE-2 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) Cylin D1, (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), Cyclin E1, (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), and the loading control Tubulin (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After washing with TBST, membranes were incubated with AP-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) for 1 h, then washed with TBST, and exposed to bromochloroidolylphosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium. Signal intensity was quantified using ImageJ (NIH) and normalized to tubulin intensity.\n\n2.8. U-PLEX (protein multiplex)\nU-PLEX is a protein multiplex assay which utilizes biotinylated antibodies coupled with proprietary linkers with electrochemiluminescent labels. This allows for detection and quantification of proteins. The U-PLEX Assay platform was purchased from Meso Scale Diagnostics (MSD, Rockville, MD, USA) and used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Sample preparations and measurements were performed by the Emory Multiplexed Immunoassay Core (EMIC). After 1 h of incubation at room temperature with 5% MesoScale Discovery Blocker A (R93AA-1) and 3 washes with 150 \u03bcL PBS/0.05% Tween, 25 \u03bcL of brain homogenate or standard were added, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, 500 rpm. After 3 PBS Tween washes, 25 \u03bcL of secondary antibody was added to each well and the plate was incubated 1 h at room temperature. Finally, 25 \u03bcL of streptavidin Sulfo-TAG/well was added after 3 PBS Tween washes, and the plate was incubated 1 h at room temperature. A MesoScale Quickplex Plate Scanner was used for protein quantification. The analytes tested included the following proteins from both the ischemic core and the peri-infarct regions: MCP-1, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, TNF, IL-4, IL-6.\n\n2.9. Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA)\nHuman iPSC derived neural stem cells (hNSCs) were seeded at a density of 100 \u00d7 10\n3\ncells /cm\n2\nin triplicate in two 6-well plates coated with Geltrex and grown in neurobasal media supplemented with 2% B-27 and FGF2 (20 ng/ml). Geltrex coated wells containing media only were used as controls. Media from hNSC and control wells was collected at Days 3 and 7 and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until required for ELISAs. A human IL-10 ELISA assay (Quantikine, R&D Systems\n\u2122\nD1000B) was performed after Day 7 media collection. Human recombinant IL-10 standard and media from hNSC and control treatments were run in duplicates. Samples were diluted at 1:10 as per vendor recommendation. The ELISA plate was read on a microplate reader at 450 nm, while wavelength correction was performed at 540 nm. Optical density (O\u22c5D.) values for each treatment were plotted as an average obtained from total number of wells per sample. The detection limit (indicated by a blue dotted line in\nSupplemental Fig. 2B\n.) indicates the O.D value obtained for the lowest recombinant human IL-10 standard concentration tested.\n\n2.10. Primary stroke core macrophage/microglia collection and cell culture\nMice were subjected to stroke surgeries as discussed above. 3 days after stroke, the visible infarct core regions from the mice were carefully dissected, pooled, and then dissociated in trypsin + EDTA. The pooled tissue suspension was centrifuged, washed with PBS, and resuspended with DMEM + 10% FBS, and plated on polystyrene tissue culture plates or into CS-A hydrogel. Following culture overnight, non-adherent cells and stroke core debris were removed, and the media was replaced. For the IL-10 neutralization experiments, 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcL anti-IL-10 antibody (R&D Systems, MAB417) was added to the cell culture media.\n\n2.11. Post-stroke neuropsychiatric behavioral testing\nThe tail suspension test was used to test depression-like behavior. All experimental mice were habituated in the waiting room for at least 30 min before testing. In the test, mice were suspended by their tails with adhesive tape in a position about 1 cm away from the tail tips. The tests were video recorded for 6 min and the last 5 min were analyzed. Immobility was considered only if the mice completely stopped any initiated movements (\nMisrani et al., 2019\n). The open field test was performed to evaluate anxiety. In the tests, each animal was introduced in the center of an open arena sized 50 cm \u00d7 50 cm \u00d7 50 cm (L \u00d7 W \u00d7 T) and allowed to move freely for 10 min. Behaviors, such as travel distances and locations, were recorded using TopScan Clever Sys (Clever Sys, Inc.) and the videos were analyzed by the TopScan Realtime Option Version 3.0 (Clever Sys Inc.). The arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol after each test.\n\n2.12. Statistics, randomization, and blinding\nData were expressed as the means +/\u2212 SEM. GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used for statistical analysis and graphic presentation. Microsoft Excel with the Analyse-It add-in was used for principal component analysis (PCA) and linear regression analysis. Briefly, PCA was used to develop composite variables consisting of the U-PLEX data, PPAR\u03b3 + macrophages counting, and IL-10 levels from Western blotting. Similarly, biochemical and immunohistochemical data were used to construct a statistical model to test the relationship between these data and behavioral outcomes. Statistical tests with corrections for multiple comparisons are presented with each figure. All animals were assigned a number and box label and randomly assigned to treatment groups evenly. All researchers performing stroke surgeries, injections, microscopy, histological analysis, and data analysis were blinded to the treatment groups until collection and analyses were completed."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nAll animal experimental procedures were performed in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Miami. Animals used were C57BL/6 J (The Jackson Laboratory, 000664), NG2creER\n\u2122\n(\nZhu et al., 2011\n)(The Jackson Laboratory, stock 008538), GFAPcreER\nT2\n(\nCasper et al., 2007\n)(a gift from Dr. Ken McCarthy, University of North Carolina), R26 loxP-STOP-loxP-tdTomato (\nArenkiel et al., 2011\n)(a gift from Dr. Fan Wang, Massachusetts Institute of Technology), GLT1-eGFP (\nRegan et al., 2007\n)(a gift from Dr. Jeffrey Rothstein, Johns Hopkins University). All animals were housed in a viral antigen free facility and kept under standard 12-h light-dark conditions. For all surgical procedures, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. For analgesia, buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) was administered post-operatively. Animals of both sexes were used.\n\n2.2. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs)\nAnimals received AAV serotype 2, expressing a secretable form of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). AAV-CNTF was produced as described previously (\nYungher et al., 2015\n). Briefly, an AAV-compatible SIBR vector was created by PCR-amplifying the knockdown cassette of a SIBR vector. This cassette was inserted into a Stratagene AAV plasmid, replacing the CMV promoter and B-globin intron. The resulting AAV-SIBR plasmid with a ubiquitin promoter, was then modified via bridge PCR to create\nKpn\nI and\nBgl\nII sites to flank the EGFP open reading frame. Plasmid DNA encoding human CNTF was purchased from Open-Biosystems (Accession:\nBC068030\n), and the open reading frame was amplified using a forward primer that incorporated both a 5\u2032 Kpn1 restriction site and the NGF signal peptide sequence and a reverse primer that incorporated 3\u2032 BglII site. PCR-amplified CNTF was then used to replace the EGFP ORF in the AAV-SIBR vector via standard restriction digest and ligation. All enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Plasmids were then used to produce adeno-associated virus serotype-2 (AAV2) (1\u20139 \u00d7 10\n13\nparticles/ml). For making AAV2-Null, we used empty pAAV.CMV\u00b7C-HA as described in a previous publication (\nBray et al., 2019\n). To incorporate the HA-tag at C-terminus of CNTF, the original cDNA sequence was PCR amplified using the following synthetic oligonucleotides: 5\u2019-CCAAGGTACCATGTCCATGTTGTTCTACAC-3\u2032 (CNTF-\nAcc\n65I) and 5\u2019-CCGTAGATCTAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTACATTTTCTTGTTGTTAGCAATAT-3\u2032 (CNTF-BglII). The pAAV-CNTF plasmid described above was digested with Acc65I and BglII restriction enzymes. The resulting 666 bp DNA fragment was replaced with the new PCR fragment yielding pAAV-hCNTF-hemagglutinin (HA) construct that was sequenced to verify its integrity. The activity of HA-tagged hCNTF was assessed by its ability to activate the STAT3 signaling pathway in HEK293 cells and compared to untagged hCNTF using Western blotting with Rabbit anti-phospho-STAT3(Tyr705) antibody (Cell Signaling; 9145S).\n\n2.3. Optic nerve crush (ONC)\nFor the ONC procedure, the left optic nerve was exposed intraorbitally by blunt dissection. The optic nerve was crushed with forceps (#5 Dumont, Fine Science Tools) for 10 s ~ 1 mm distal to the emergence from the globe (\nLuo et al., 2016\n;\nPark et al., 2008\n). Animals received optic nerve crush 3 to 14 days after AAV injection as indicated for each experiment. Sham surgery involved exposure of the optic nerve without nerve crush.\n\n2.4. Tamoxifen injection\nInjections were started at about postnatal day 35 (experiments involving GFAPcreER and NG2creER\n\u2122\nmice). Procedure time-lines are outlined in the text and figure legends. The exact number of animals used for each group is indicated in the main text and figure legends. Mice received intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen (0.124 mg/g body weight) for 5 consecutive days as previously described (\nHackett et al., 2018\n). The mice were given a washout period of 11 days prior to receiving AAV injection.\n\n2.5. Estimation of Cre induction efficiency in the NG2creER\n\u2122\n; Rosa26-tdTomato mice\nNG2creER\n\u2122\n; Rosa26-tdTomato mice (6 weeks old) received intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen (0.124 mg/g body weight) for 5 consecutive days. Cre induction efficiency was obtained 14 days after the last tamoxifen injection by dividing the number of tdTomato+ NG2+ cells by the total number of NG2+ cells (\nn\n= 3 mice).\n\n2.6. Intravitreal injection\nFemale and male mice 5 to 7 weeks old underwent unilateral AAV injection. A fine glass micropipette was inserted into the posterior chamber, taking care to avoid damaging the lens. Using a Hamilton syringe (Hamilton 80,900) 2 \u03bcl of virus was slowly injected. Anterograde labeling of regenerating axons was performed by injecting 2 \u03bcl of 2 \u03bcg/\u03bcl Alexa 488 or Alexa-555 conjugated cholera toxin \u03b2 subunit (CTB) (ThermoFisher,\nC22841\nand\nC22843\n) 2\u20133 days before euthanasia.\n\n2.7. Histology\nMice were anesthetized and then transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Optic nerves were dissected and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2 h, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight. About 8 mm segments of the optic nerve centered at the injury site were embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek) and longitudinal sections (10 \u03bcm) were cut using a cryostat. Sections were immunostained by incubating in primary antibodies in 5% Normal Goat Serum in PBS with 0.3% Triton-X overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Primary antibodies used were: RFP (Rockland 600\u2013401-379S, 1:1000), GFAP (Invitrogen 130,300, 1:1000 or Dako Z033429, 1:500), APC/CC1 (Millipore OP80 Ab-7, 1:500), NG2 (Millipore AB5320, 1:200), GFP (Abcam ab13970, 1:2000) and Iba1 (Wako 019\u201319,741, 1:500). Following primary antibody incubation, sections were washed and incubated in species-appropriate Alexa Fluor IgG (H + L) secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, 1:500) at room temperature for 1 h. For CC1, goat-anti-mouse IgG\u03b32b secondary antibody was used (Invitrogen A-21141, 1:500). Slides were mounted using Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories H-1200). Images were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse Ti fluorescent microscope or an Olympus FluoView 1000 confocal microscope.\n\n2.8. Quantification of lesion areas in the optic nerve\nThe area size of the optic nerve lesion from different animals was determined by manually drawing a contour around the relevant area approximately 1 mm away from the eye, using ImageJ software. They were presented as \u201cYFP negative area\u201d, \u201carea occupied by YFP negative and GFAP positive cells\u201d, \u201cGFAP negative area\u201d and \u201cIBA+ lesion core area\u201d. The size of the relevant lesion area was presented as \u03bcm\n2\nor as an arbitrary unit (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n). At least three or four sections were analyzed for each animal.\n\n2.9. Optic nerve RNA-sequencing and data analyses\nTotal RNA from mouse optic nerve was extracted using RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen #740040) and treated with DNAse I to remove genomic DNA contamination according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Total RNA-seq (ribo-depleted) libraries were produced using Truseq Stranded Total RNA library prep kit (Illumina, #20020596) with 500 ng of DNase-treated Input RNA.\nThe RNA-seq processing was done as described previously (\nDasilva et al., 2021\n). Briefly, raw fastq files were trimmed with Trimmomatic v0.32 (\nBolger et al., 2014\n) and aligned to mouse genome (mm10 version) using STAR aligner v2.5.3a (\nDobin et al., 2013\n) with default parameters and RSEM v1.2.31 (\nLi and Dewey, 2011\n) to obtain expected gene counts against the mouse Ensembl (version 96). The differential expression analysis was determined between ONC + AAV-CNTF vs. ONC + AAV-Null animals, ONC + AAV-Null vs. sham injury + AAV-Null animals, and ONC + AAV-CNTF vs. sham injury + AAV-Null animals using DESeq2 (\nLove et al., 2014\n) and R v3.2.3. A gene was considered detected if the FPKM was >1 in three replicates of at least one sample and significantly changed if the q-value <0.05 and a fold change >1.5. Heatmap was generated using Python script. Volcano plots were generated using VolcaNoseR (\nGoedhart and Luijsterburg, 2020\n). Venn Diagram was generated using InteractiVenn. Raw RNAseq data of optic nerves were deposited to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO:\nGSE196824\n).\n\n2.10. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)\nGene expression fold changes obtained from our RNA-seq data (injured relative to sham samples) were calculated with DESeq2 as described above, and the entire list of expressed genes was pre-ranked and imported into the GSEA program (\nSubramanian et al., 2005\n).\n\n2.11. Fluorescent in situ hybridization\nRNAscope fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed in 10 \u03bcm thickness optic nerve sections using the RNAscoper\n\u00ae\nMultiplex Fluorescent v2 Assay (ACD Biotechne, Catalog No. 323100) according to the manufacture\u2019s protocol. Target probes used are as follows: RNAscope\n\u00ae\nProbe - Mm-H19-O1 (Cat No. 501671), RNAscope\n\u00ae\nProbe- Mm-Gfap-C3 - Cat No. 313211-C3), and RNAscope\n\u00ae\nProbe - Mm-CXCL9 - Cat No. 489341). TSA-based fluorophores were from Perkin Elmer (TSA Plus Fluorescein, PN NEL741001KT; TSA Plus Cyanine 3, PN NEL744001KT; TSA Plus Cyanine 5, NEL745001KT). Images were acquired using an Olympus Confocal FV1000 microscope or an Andor Dragonfly confocal microscope.\n\n2.12. Optic nerve Western blots for CNTF-HA\nEach optic nerve was homogenized by sonication in 50 ul of 1\u00d7 RIPA-SDS sample buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche; PhosSTOP; cOmplete Mini). Tissue lysates were separated on 4\u201312% gradient polyacrylamide gel (GenScript) and transferred to nirocellulose membrane, then blocked in 5% BSA-TBST for 1 h, and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with rabbit-anti-HA-tag antibody (Cell Signaling; #3724; 1:1000) and mouse anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma; A2228; 1:6000). Secondary antibodies were AzureSpectra goat-anti-mouse IR700 (1:5000) and goat-anti-rabbit IR800 (1:5000). The signal was detected using Azure C600 Gel imaging system.\n\n2.13. EdU proliferation assay\nMice were given intraperitoneal injection of EdU (50 mg/kg; Invitrogen A10044) in 2% DMSO in PBS at 3, 5, and 7 days after ONC and sacrificed at 21 days after crush. Tissues were prepared for histology, and EdU was detected by using Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Imaging Kit (Invitrogen\nC10337\n) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Sections were subsequently immunostained as described above. All sections were counterstained with DAPI, and only EdU\n+\ncells that were also DAPI\n+\nwere included in the quantification.\n\n2.14. Statistics\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software. Data were analyzed using Student\u2019s\nt\n-test, one-way ANOVA, or two-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s or Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc test as indicated in the figure legends. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Number of animals used for each animal group is indicated in the figure legends. All error bars represent SEM."

    "Methods": "Mice.\nPD is more common in males than in females and at the time these studies were initiated, most evidence supported that early cognitive decline in idiopathic PD may be worse in males than in females (\nElbaz et al., 2016\n;\nReekes et al., 2020\n). Accordingly, the present study used male\nLrrk2\nG2019S\nknockin mice (RRID:MGI:6273311) that were congenic on a C57Bl/6NTac background. Over the course of all experiments, mice were aged 2\u20136 postnatal months. Age- and strain-matched wildtype (\nLrrk2\nWT\n) mice served as controls. All mice were bred and raised under identical conditions in the vivarium. The\nLrrk2\nG2019S\nmice were generated by Eli Lily and characterized previously (\nGuevara et al., 2020\n;\nMatikainen-Ankney et al., 2018\n,\n2016\n). They exhibit normal life spans and body weights, express normal levels of tyrosine hydroxylase in the striatum, and express normal physiological levels of Lrrk2\nG2019S\nprotein in brain.\nLrrk2\nG2019S\nmice were backcrossed to commercial WT C57Bl/6NTac mice every fourth generation to prevent genetic drift. Genotypes were confirmed by PCR and sequencing. In humans, the G2019S mutation is autosomal dominant, producing similar disease onset and progression in heterozygous and homozygous mutation carriers (\nPais\u00e1n-Ruiz et al., 2013\n;\nZimprich et al., 2004\n). As predicted from this, previous studies showed similar behavioral and electrophysiological outcomes in heterozygous and homozygous\nLrrk2\nG2019S\nmice (\nGuevara et al., 2020\n;\nMatikainen-Ankney et al., 2018\n,\n2016\n). We thus used heterozygous\nLrrk2\nG2019S\nmutants for these experiments. All procedures were approved by Mount Sinai\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nBehavioral tasks.\nMice were 2- to 3-months old when behavioral experiments began. They were housed in groups of 3\u20134 in a temperature-controlled room with a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 am). Behavioral testing was conducted once a day for 5\u20136 days a week during the light phase of the cycle. Mice were food restricted to 85% of their free-feeding weight. Water was available ad libitum, and food rations, adjusted based on body weight, were given at the end of each day.\n\nApparatus.\nAll behavioral tasks were carried out using four automated Bussey-Saksida style touchscreen-based operant chambers (Lafayette Instruments, Lafayette, IL) consisting of four modular testing chambers housed individually within a sound- and light-attenuating cubicle equipped with an overhead camera to monitor task-related locomotion. Inside each chamber, a reward collection magazine connected to a liquid dispenser pump was situated opposite a touch-sensitive monitor. Depending on the task, the touchscreen monitor was divided into one, two or five response windows by interchanging different black Perspex masks. Each response window was 4.0 \u00d7 4.0 cm regardless of how many response windows each mask contained. The collection magazine contained an LED illuminated coincident with delivery of a liquid reward (Nesquik\u00ae strawberry-flavored milk) and a tone. Infrared beam arrays distributed in front of the touchscreen, reward collection port and across the intervening floor, were used to monitor locomotor activity. Different training schedules, depending on the task, were designed and data were analyzed using ABET II Touch software (Lafayette Instruments), while inputs and outputs from all four chambers were controlled by WhiskerServer software (Lafayette Instruments).\n\n5-CSRT task.\nThis task was conducted on 18\nLrrk2\nG2019S\nmice and 19\nLrrk2\nWT\nmice and followed established procedures (\nBari et al., 2008\n;\nMar et al., 2013\n). The following performance metrics were collected (and defined as): % correct responses (number of correct responses/(total number of correct plus incorrect responses) x 100); % omissions (number of omissions/(total number of correct, incorrect and omitted responses) x 100); number of trials (number of correct plus incorrect trials); correct response latency (the elapsed time between stimulus offset following a correct touch and head entry into the reward magazine signaled by a back IR beam break); premature responses (nose pokes during the 5 s intertrial interval (ITI)).\n\nPre-training.\nMice progressed through 5 pretraining stages (habituation, initial touch, must touch, must initiate and punish incorrect) before advancing to training. In stage 1, they were acclimated to the chambers for a 40 min session with the tray-light turned on, and the tray was primed with strawberry milk. In stages 2 and 3, a mask with five response windows was placed over the touchscreen, and mice learned to nose poke the stimulus (white square) displayed randomly in one of the five response windows to elicit strawberry milk delivery. In stage 4, mice learned to initiate each trial via head entry into the magazine tray; withdrawal from the magazine elicited the next stimulus presentation. Mice were required to complete 30 trials in 60 min across two consecutive days to meet completion criteria for stages 2\u20134. In stage 5, mice were discouraged from nose-poking blank locations on the screen by imposing a 5 s timeout period signaled by illumination of the house light. Mice were rewarded with 7 \u03bcl of strawberry milk at all stages. To progress to task training, mice were required to complete 24 out of 30 trials in 60 min (80% accuracy) across two out of three consecutive days (\nMar et al., 2013\n).\n\nTraining.\nDaily training sessions lasted 60 min. At the beginning of each session, the magazine light was illuminated and a free strawberry milk reward was dispensed. A nose poke entry into the reward port extinguished the magazine light, and upon exiting initiated a 5 s ITI. Following the ITI, a visual stimulus (white square) was randomly displayed in 1 of 5 locations on the screen. A nose poke response made in the corresponding location either during the stimulus presentation or the following 5 s limited hold period (stimulus offset) was deemed correct and resulted in strawberry milk delivery. The stimulus duration was initially set at 32 s and gradually reduced to 16, 8, 4, and 2 s to establish baseline performance at 2 s stimulus duration. The performance criteria for advancing to the next shorter stimulus duration were completion of \u226550 out of 60 trials within 60 min, response accuracy \u226580%, and trial omissions \u226420%, across three of four consecutive days (\nMar et al., 2013\n).\n\nProbe trial.\nOnce mice were performing at baseline (2 s stimulus duration), they were subjected to a probe trial in which attentional demand was increased by shortening stimulus durations (n = 19\nLrrk2\nWT\nmice, 17\nLrrk2\nG2019S\nmice). Stimulus durations were (in seconds): 1.5, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, and 0.4, where mice were tested at a single stimulus duration for two consecutive days (within session). The order of stimulus durations presented to each mouse was randomized in a Latin square design to prevent order effects. In between each of the shortened stimulus durations, mice were tested at the baseline 2 s stimulus duration until performance criteria were reattained (completion of 50 out of 60 trials, \u226580% accuracy and \u2264 20% omissions in 60 min).\n\nVisual Perception test.\nWe tested visual perceptual abilities of mice at the shortest stimulus duration used in the probe trial (0.4 s) in a subset of mice completing the 5-CSRT task (n = 13\nLrrk2\nWT\nmice; 9\nLrrk2\nG2019S\nmice), under conditions where attentional demand was lowered by presenting the stimulus in one response window, thereby eliminating the need for mice to divide their attention across 5 response windows. In this 1-choice version of the task, the stimulus (white square) was only presented in the middle window of the five-response window mask. Other task parameters and the primary response rules remained the same. Once mice reattained the baseline performance at 2 s, they were tested on the 0.4 s stimulus duration (50 out of 60 trials within 60 min) for two consecutive days.\n\nAdministration of donepezil.\nThese experiments were conducted on a subset of\nLrrk2\nWT\n(n = 13) and\nLrrk2\nG2019S\n(n = 9) mice after completing the probe trial. Mice received either donepezil or vehicle (normal saline) using a within-subject design where, for each mouse, the order of treatment with vehicle or donepezil was counterbalanced across animals of each group. Donepezil hydrochloride (0.3 mg/kg; Bio-Techne Corp, Minneapolis, MN) was dissolved in 0.9% saline and was made fresh each day. The donepezil dose used was based on prior studies (\nBartko et al., 2011\n;\nRomberg et al., 2011\n;\nYuede et al., 2007\n). Mice were injected intraperitoneally one hour before behavioral testing on each day of a two-day testing sequence in the 5-CSRT task. Testing consisted of 50 trials for 2 consecutive days at a stimulus duration of 0.4 s. In between dosing/testing sequences, mice received three drug-free days over which they were tested using a baseline 2 s stimulus duration; animals were required to reinstate baseline performance (\u226580% accuracy, \u226420% omissions).\n\nInstrumental conditioning and outcome devaluation.\nAction-outcome learning was assessed in a second, separate cohort of mice (n = 7\nLrrk2\nWT\nand 6\nLrrk2\nG2019S\nmice) by adapting for touchscreens a previously described 4-day lever-pressing paradigm of instrumental conditioning followed by subsequent tests of reward devaluation to discriminate goal-directed and habitual responding (\nShan et al., 2014\n). In this task, a one response-window mask was used. Training consisted of two 60-min sessions of habituation in the chamber as described above, followed by a 2 h session using a continuous reinforcement (CRF) schedule, where each nose poke to the stimulus window elicited a reward. Following training, mice progressed to a 4-day testing protocol, where each session was limited to 60 min. On day 1, mice were tested on a CRF schedule. On days 2\u20134, mice were subjected to a random interval (RI) session of 15, 30, and 30 s. On days 5 and 6, outcome devaluation tests were conducted. On day 5, half of the mice were given 1 h free access to strawberry milk reward (devalued condition), while the other half got 1 h free access to home-cage chow (non-devalued condition), followed immediately by a 5 min extinction test. No reward was elicited in this extinction test. On day 6, a second extinction test was performed in the same manner as the first except that the satiety conditions were reversed.\n\nPairwise visual discrimination and reversal learning.\nCognitive flexibility was tested in a third, separate cohort (n = 5\nLrrk2\nWT\nand 7\nLrrk2\nG2019S\nmice) using pairwise visual discrimination and reversal learning. Before testing, mice underwent touchscreen training as described above, but using a mask containing two response windows. In the initial discrimination phase, mice were presented simultaneously with two distinct visual stimuli (plane vs. spider) and taught to associate one stimulus (e.g. plane) with strawberry milk delivery and the other (e. g. spider) with a 5 s timeout period signaled by illumination of the house light (\nBartko et al., 2011\n). The rewarded stimulus was pseudo-randomly displayed in one of the two response windows and was counterbalanced within mice. An incorrect choice resulted in a correction trial in which the stimulus display was repeated in the same window until the mouse made a correct response. However, correction trials were not included in the total tally of correct trials. Upon completing 24 out of 30 trials (80% accuracy) within 60 mins in two consecutive days, mice advanced to the subsequent reversal phase in which reward contingencies were switched. As with the discrimination phase, an incorrect choice resulted in a correction trial in which the stimulus display was repeated in the same window until the mouse made a correct response. Measurements included the rate at which mice acquired the new stimulus-reward associations as well as the number of correction responses in each phase (\nBussey et al., 1997\n).\n\nProgressive ratio task.\nMotivation for the reward was evaluated by a progressive ratio test of subsets of mice following completion of the 5-CSRT task (n = 13\nLrrk2\nWT\nand 11\nLrrk2\nG2019S\nmice) or instrumental conditioning/outcome devaluation (n = 4\nLrrk2\nWT\nand 4\nLrrk2\nG2019S\nmice). Mice were subjected to fixed ratio (FR) schedules in which nose-poking the illuminated center response window for a fixed number of times (FR 1, 2, 3, or 5) was required to elicit a strawberry milk reward. Criterion to advance was completion of 30 trials within 60 min for two consecutive days. Following completion of FR5, mice advanced to a progressive ratio (PR) 4 testing schedule, where reward response requirement incremented on a linear +4 basis (i.e., 1, 5, 9, 13, etc.) in each subsequent trial. Sessions were run for 60 min and were terminated when a mouse ceased responding for 5 min (the breakpoint).\n\nStatistical analysis of behavioral data.\nStatistical analyses were performed in R version 4.1.2 (R Core Team, 2021). Statistical tests for each dataset are specified within each figure legend. For most analyses we used a linear mixed models regression framework with genotype and behavioral variables (e.g. stimulus duration) or treatment levels (donepezil/saline) as fixed effects and mouse as a random effect, using R packages lme4 (\nBates et al., 2015\n) and lmerTest (\nKuznetsova et al., 2017\n) and the mean score in each session as the unit of analysis. These models were evaluated with F-tests on type III sums of squares on fixed effects and their interactions. Where significant effects were indicated, these were decomposed through comparisons of estimated marginal means using the emmeans package (Lenth, 2022). Data are reported as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) and all significant comparisons are displayed by asterisks in the figures.\n\nImmunolabeling.\nBehaviorally na\u00efve male mice (n = 3\u20135\nLrrk2\nWT\nn = 3\u20135\nLrrk2\nG2019S\nmice, aged 2\u20133 months) were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg, IP) and transcardially perfused first with cold 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.3) for 30\u201345 s followed by cold 4% PFA for 10 min. Brains were dissected, post-fixed for 6\u20138 h in 4% PFA, then soaked in 7% sucrose in PBS for 24 h. Serial coronal tissue sections through cortical areas PL/IL, dorsomedial striatum (DMS) or the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) were cut on a vibratome at a setting of 50 \u03bcm. Tissue sections were then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, washed thoroughly in PBS, and incubated in a PBS solution containing 10% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) for 1.5 h at room temperature (RT). Sections were then incubated for 72 h at 4 \u00b0C in primary rabbit anti-vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) antisera (Synaptic Systems; 1:500, RRID_AB887864) containing 2% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Sections were washed thoroughly in PBS, followed by RT incubation for 1 h with secondary donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:500, RRID_AB2313584). After washing, sections were mounted using VectaShield antifade mounting media and counterstained with DAPI. Coverslip edges were sealed with nail polish and dried overnight in the dark.\n\nImage analysis.\nFor each region analyzed, three immunolabeled sections per mouse were used. No attempt was made to analyze PL and IL separately. A series of contiguous single optical plane images through areas PL/IL or DMS was acquired with a 40\u00d7 objective on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope and stitched together using Zeiss Zen SP1 (black) software (v.8.1.11.484) to create a single tiled image per section through areas PL/IL or DMS (tiled image dimensions in areas PL/IL: 1020 \u03bcm \u00d7 1226 \u03bcm, spanning layers 1\u20136; tiled image dimension in DMS: 820 \u03bcm \u00d7 820 \u03bcm). Single image dimensions for dLGN were 212.5 \u03bcm \u00d7 212.5 \u03bcm. Image acquisition parameters were kept identical for all sections from mice of each genotype. A sampling frame (207.5 \u03bcm\n2\n) was used to define a region of interest (ROI) and overlayed onto the raw tiled images of areas PL/IL (6 ROIs per section, sampling superficial-to-deep cortical layers) or DMS (3 ROIs per section) or the raw single images of dLGN (2 ROIs per section). VAChT fiber density, average size of immunolabeled puncta and immunofluorescent intensity were determined using ImageJ by applying a thresholding function to each ROI to create a binarized mask of the immunofluorescent signal. The mask was then applied to the original image to capture and quantify density, area and intensity of suprathreshold immunofluorescent pixels. The density of VAChT immunolabeled fibers was expressed as the percent of R0I area occupied by suprathreshold pixels (\nDougherty et al., 2020\n). Statistical comparisons between groups for areas PL/IL and DMS were made using a linear mixed model on each measure, with region and genotype as fixed effects and mouse as a random effect;\nt\n-tests were used to compare between groups for dLGN measures. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Baylor College of Medicine. Parvalbumin-Cre (PV-Cre)/Ai9 mice (crossing PV-Cre mice with Ai9 stop-floxed mice, Jackson Laboratory Stock #008069 and #007909, respectively), a line shown to have recombination in >90% of cells expressing parvalbumin (\nHippenmeyer et al., 2005\n), were crossed with\nKcnq2\n-floxed mice (\nKcnq2\nfl/fl\n) (\nSoh et al., 2014\n) to generate conditional knockout (cKO, PV-\nKcnq2\nfl/fl\n) mice with PV-INs labeled with the red fluorescent protein tdTomato on a C57BL6/J background. Mice were group-housed in cages with a natural light-dark cycle and access to a standard pellet diet and water ad libitum. All mice were between postnatal day (P) 30\u201345 at the time of experiments. Genotype was blinded to investigators prior to analysis. For all experiments, both male and female mice were used, with no significant differences found between groups; therefore, data was pooled together. If necessary, mice were euthanized by CO\n2\ninhalation (SmartBox, Euthanex, Palmer, PA).\n\nIn vivo EEG monitoring\nMice were treated with meloxicam (5 mg/kg, Henry Schein Veterinary) and local injection of 50 \u03bcL of 2% lidocaine (Henry Schein Veterinary) before being anesthetized with isoflurane (2\u20134% in O\n2\n; Henry Schein Veterinary). Mice were surgically implanted with bilateral epidural silver wire electrodes over the somatosensory cortex (1 mm posterior and 3 mm lateral to bregma) and frontal cortex (1 mm anterior and 1 mm lateral to bregma) (\nMaheshwari et al., 2013\n). Reference and ground electrodes were placed over the left and right cerebellum, respectively. Implanted mice received daily meloxicam (5 mg/kg) injections for 3 days following surgery. Mice were allowed to recover for at least 2 days prior to recording (\nSoh et al., 2018\n). Freely moving mice were video-EEG monitored (AD Instruments), and power was analyzed and compared between groups as previously described, with left and right frontal electrodes re-referenced to left and right parietal electrodes, respectively (\nMaheshwari et al., 2017\n). The EEG power spectra were estimated using the spectral analysis function (spectropo()) in EEGLab (\nDelorme and Makeig, 2004\n). Absolute power (AP) was output between 2 and 200 Hz with a window size of 8 s and a window overlap of 6 s. Relative power (RP) was calculated by dividing the absolute power values for each frequency by the total power (TP; 2\u2013200 Hz), and then normalized with a log transformation before comparison between mice (RP = AP/TP) as previously described (\nMaheshwari et al., 2017\n). Power between hemispheres was then averaged before comparing between WT and cKO mice.\n\nDrugs\nKainic Acid (KA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Gibco, Life Technologies), and retigabine (RTG; Alomone Labs, Inc) and picrotoxin (PTX; Tocris) were first dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) prior to being diluted to 1% volume/weight in PBS.\n\nSeizure Monitoring\nMice were treated with RTG 15 minutes prior to PTX or KA injection (RTG and PTX at 10 mg/kg; KA at 30mg/kg, i.p.), starting between 9:00\u201311:30 am to prevent confounding diurnal variation, similar to how retigabine was administered to prevent seizures in its original preclinical efficacy studies (\nRostock et al., 1996\n). Seizures were defined based on the Racine scale with the following stages: 0 - no abnormality; 1 - mouth and facial movements; 2 - head nodding; 3 - forelimb clonus; 4 - rearing; 5 - rearing and falling (\nMakinson et al., 2014\n;\nRacine, 1972\n;\nSoh et al., 2014\n). For the PTX experiments, control mice either received no injection or received the vehicle injection (DMSO in PBS) prior to PTX administration. There was no significant difference in induced seizure latency between two cohorts of mice (vehicle injection (n=21) vs no injection (n=38)), so these mice were grouped together as \u2018control\u2019 mice. For the KA experiments, control mice received the injection of PBS alone.\n\nBehavioral Testing\nThree behavioral tests were performed over a 3-day period. Mice were randomized to perform either the Tail Suspension Test or the Heat Sensitivity Test on Day 1, followed by the alternate test on Day 2. Mice underwent training for the Balance Beam Assay on both Day 1 and Day 2 prior to final testing on Day 3 as detailed below. The Tail Suspension Test was utilized to quantify depressive behaviors as previously described (\nCan et al., 2012\n). Briefly, the tail was attached to a suspension bar at a height of 50 cm for six minutes. The total time spent mobile or exhibiting escape behaviors was recorded. The Heat Sensitivity Test was utilized to assess response to painful stimuli (\nDeuis et al., 2017\n;\nMoqrich et al., 2005\n). Unrestrained mice were placed on a heating pad at 55\u00b0C and the time until the onset of nocifensive behaviors was recorded. Finally, the Balance Beam Assay was utilized to evaluate motor balance and coordination (\nLuong et al., 2011\n). A flat, plexiglass beam (12.7 mm x 6.35 mm x 90 cm) was placed at 50 cm elevation with an aversive light stimulus placed atop the beginning end of the beam. During the first two days of training, each mouse crossed both the 12.7 mm width beam and 6.35 mm width beam three times. On the third day, the time taken to cross the center 75 cm of the beam during the two continuous crossings was determined and averaged (\nLuong et al., 2011\n). Comparison between groups for behavioral tests was performed with the Mann-Whitney U-test.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nFor KCNQ2 detection in fluorescent-positive PV-INs (expressing tdTomato), we followed a modified fluorescence immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocol (\nBattefeld et al., 2014\n). Of note, 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) was empirically found to be optimal in preserving both tdTomato and Kcnq2 immunostaining signals; higher concentrations of PFA limited the detection of KCNQ2 staining (\nPan et al., 2006\n), while lower concentrations limited the detection of tdTomato staining. Mice were perfused transcardially with 20 mL PBS followed by 20 mL of 2% PFA. The brain was then removed, post-fixed in 2% PFA for 30 minutes, and then suspended in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight. 20 \u03bcm sagittal sections were then cut on a cryotome, incubated first overnight with mouse anti-ankyrin-G (AnkG) (\nRasband et al., 1999\n) (Sigma, #S8809) and rabbit anti-KCNQ2 (\nCooper et al., 2001\n) as primary antibodies, followed by Alexa-Fluor goat anti-mouse 647 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa-Fluor 594 (Life Technologies) as secondary antibodies for one hour. Slices were then incubated in Prolong Gold Antifade with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) prior to imaging with either wide-field or confocal microscopy. Co-localization between KCNQ2 and AnkG signals was quantified by identifying AIS segments with AnkG expression for at least 20 \u03bcm (\nH\u00f6fflin et al., 2017\n) with either the presence or absence of coexpression with KCNQ2.\nTo detect KCNQ3 in PV-INs, a different IHC protocol was used given poor visualization of KCNQ3 with its antibody on 2% PFA-fixed tissue, as previously described (\nBattefeld et al., 2014\n;\nPan et al., 2006\n). Briefly, PV-INs were filled with Alexa-Fluor 488 during whole-cell recording. After the recording, the brain slices were immediately fixed with methanol at \u221220 \u00b0C for 20 minutes. Slices were then washed with PBS, blocked with non-fat milk, and incubated overnight with mouse anti-AnkG (Sigma, #S8809) and guinea pig anti-KCNQ3 (\nDevaux et al., 2004\n) as primary antibodies, followed by Alexa-Fluor goat anti-mouse 647 and goat anti-guinea pig Alexa-Fluor 594 (Life Technologies) as secondary antibodies for one hour. Slices were then incubated in DAPI prior to imaging with either wide-field or confocal microscopy. For all IHC studies, at least 4 mice from each genotype were used.\n\nSlice Preparation and Electrophysiology\nSlice preparation from the mouse hippocampus followed an N-Methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) slicing protocol (\nJiang et al., 2015\n;\nTing et al., 2014\n). Briefly, mice between P30\u201333 were deeply anesthetized using 3% isoflurane and immediately decapitated. The brain was then immediately removed from the skull and placed into a cold (0\u22124 \u00b0C) oxygenated NMDG solution. Parasagittal slices (300 \u03bcm) were cut with a vibratome (VT1200, Leica). The slices were incubated at 34.0\u00b10.5 \u00b0C in oxygenated NMDG solution for 10\u201315 minutes before being transferred to an artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution (ACSF) containing: 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 25 mM NaHCO\n3\n, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 25 mM glucose and 2 mM CaCl\n2\n(pH 7.4) for about 1 h. The slices were then incubated at room temperature for ~0.5\u22121 h before recording.\nWhole-cell recordings were performed as described previously (\nGreene et al., 2017\n;\nJiang et al., 2015\n,\n2013\n;\nRobbins et al., 2013\n;\nVarghese et al., 2021\n). Briefly, patch pipettes (5\u22127 M\u2126) were filled with an internal solution containing 120 mM potassium gluconate, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM KCl, 3 mM EGTA, 4 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM Na\n3\nGTP, 10 mM sodium phosphocreatine and 0.5% biocytin (pH 7.25). Whole-cell recordings of CA1 neurons were performed using Quadro EPC 10 amplifiers (HEKA). In many cases, multiple cells were recorded simultaneously (multi-patch recording) in the same slice to improve efficiency in data collection (\nJiang et al., 2015\n,\n2013\n). The spiking activity of each neuron in response to increasing current steps or ramp current injections (120 pA/s) was recorded with or without bath application of RTG (10 \u03bcM). Recorded neurons were filled with biocytin and then fixed for post hoc morphological recovery to further confirm cell identity (\nJiang et al., 2015\n).\nWe followed a standard protocol to isolate M-currents (\nI\nM\n) from hippocampal neurons (\nLawrence et al., 2006\n;\nShah et al., 2002\n;\nSoh et al., 2014\n). Briefly, cells were first clamped at \u221220 mV, and then a 1 s long, \u221230 mV step was introduced every 15 s (\nFig. 5\n). The\nI\nM\namplitude was measured from the deactivation relaxation at \u221250 mV (\nFig. 5\n) (\nSoh et al., 2014\n). After obtaining a 5 min baseline, the Kv7 channels agonist retigabine (RTG) (10 \u03bcM) was added to the bath and the changes in\nI\nM\nand the holding current (\nI\nhold\n) were recorded.\nFigure 5. Effects of retigabine (RTG) on M-currents of hippocampal PV-INs.\nOpen in a new tab\n(\nA\n) Representative traces of M-currents (\nI\nM\n) in PV-INs from WT (left) and from cKO (right) before (black) and after (red) 10 \u03bcM RTG application. (\nB\n) RTG significantly increased the holding currents (\nI\nhold\n) at \u221220 mV in PV-INs from WT (left, n = 12, \u0394: 99.8 pA, **\np\n< 0.01) and cKO mice (right, n = 12, \u0394: 42.4 pA, *\np\n< 0.05), but RTG had less effects on\nI\nhold\nfrom cKO mice (interaction: F(1,1) = 6.9,\np\n< 0.05 with two-way ANOVA). (\nC\n) RTG significantly increased the\nI\nM\namplitude in PV-INs from WT mice, but not in PV-INs from cKO mice (WT, n=12, \u0394: 18.7 pA, t=8.3, **\np\n< 0.01; cKO, n=12; \u0394: 3.14 pA,\np\n> 0.05; interaction: F (1,1) = 24.1,\np\n< 0.01 with two-way ANOVA).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll statistical analyses for\nin vivo\nstudies, immunohistochemical analysis, and\nin vitro\nstudies comparing WT to cKO mice were performed in GraphPad Prism, v9.3.1 (California, United States). Comparisons for developmental weight, relative power,\nin vitro\nmeasurements (including M-current, action potentials, resting membrane potential, and rheobase) were performed with a repeated measures 2-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post-hoc tests. Comparisons for behavioral testing were performed with Mann-Whitney U-tests. To evaluate the relative survival of mice and the latency to Stage 5 seizures, the Gehan-Breslow test was performed. Comparisons between the distributions of latency to onset of seizure stages for the subsets of mice that reached each stage were performed with Kruskal-Wallis tests with Dunn\u2019s post-hoc tests. Proportions of mice that survived after exposure to either PTX or KA, with or without retigabine pre-treatment, were compared with Chi-square tests."

    "Methods": "2.1. Mice\nMale and female\nThy1\n-TNXXL mice aged 6\u201312 weeks were used for calcium imaging experiments (\nWilliams et al., 2014\n). These mice are on a C57 Bl/6 background and express the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based calcium indicator, TNXXL in their neurons (\nMank et al., 2008\n). TNXXL is a modified protein based on chicken skeletal muscle Troponin C, with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and citrine cp174 fused on either end of the protein. Upon binding of calcium, this genetically encoded sensor changes conformation allowing for ratiometric measurement of calcium changes in the axons of these mice. For immunofluorescent staining, C57 Bl/6 mice were used. Studies were carried out in accordance with the U.K. Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986.\n\n2.2. Study design and statistics\nSample size was estimated using an a priori power analysis from initial studies with G*Power software (v 3.1.9.2), using an effect size of 2.01, an alpha error probability of 0.05 and a power of 0.9. Immuno-fluorescent images were analysed blinded. All data are displayed as mean \u00b1 SEM and relevant statistical tests and mouse numbers used for each analysis are described in the figure legends. Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 6.07).\n\n2.3. Anti-ganglioside antibodies and normal human serum\nMonoclonal anti-GD1b ganglioside antibody MOG1 (subclass IgG3) was previously generated by immunisation of GD3s\n-/-\nganglioside knock out mice with GD1b-KLH liposomes. The properties of this antibody and its binding pattern to GD1b ganglioside have been described previously (\nGreenshields et al., 2009\n). Antibodies against GD1b are classically associated with sensory forms of GBS. However, antibodies against GD1b have also been demonstrated to bind strongly in mouse motor nerves (\nGong et al., 2002\n). We have shown that this antibody binds primarily to, and fixes complement on, neuronal membranes in mouse motor nerves without binding or injuring glial membranes (\nCunningham et al., 2020\n). We therefore found this to be an ideal antibody for directing injury to the motor axonal membrane in this model of axonal GBS injury, even though this may not directly correspond with human AMAN serology. Normal human serum as a source of complement was taken from a single donor and frozen in aliquots at -80 \u00b0C.\n\n2.4. Ex vivo injury model\nTriangularis sterni (TS) nerve-muscle explants were used to visualise the motor nerve axons. This muscle is ideal for visualising distal motor nerves; it is a thin, flat muscle, densely innervated with branches of the intercostal nerves with many of its NMJs lying parallel to the muscle layers (\nMcArdle et al., 1981\n). The explants can be kept alive for many hours in physiological solution, allowing for live imaging (\nKerschensteiner et al., 2008\n).\nThy1\n-TNXXL TS explants were dissected (\nKerschensteiner et al., 2008\n) and mounted in oxygenated Ringer\u2019s solution (116 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 23 mM NaHCO\n3\n, 1 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 11 mM glucose, 1 mM MgCl\n2\nand 2 mM CaCl\n2\n). Explants were incubated with monoclonal anti-GD1b antibody (Ab) (100 \u03bcg/ml) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C, a previously established protocol for effective binding of this Ab at the motor nerve terminal (\nCunningham et al., 2016\n). Following the initial incubation with Ab, tissue was washed 3\u00d7 with room temperature Ringer\u2019s solution and then moved to the microscope for baseline imaging. Once a baseline image was established, Ringer\u2019s solution was replaced with 40% NHS in Ringer\u2019s solution for 10 min to initiate the complement-mediated injury. After 10 min, tissue was washed 3\u00d7 in fresh Ringer\u2019s and images were taken immediately and every 10 min for 1 h. For control tissue, the NHS step was omitted. The 10-min incubation time with NHS was analysed in pilot experiments to confirm this time was sufficient to cause terminal complement pore deposition at the motor nerve terminal. A priori, exclusion criteria for Ab+NHS preparations were set. Those preparations which did not show rises in calcium were to be tested for successful MAC deposition and excluded if negative. No preparations needed to be excluded in this manner.\nIn calpain inhibition studies, the model was performed as above with either 100 \u03bcM of the calpain inhibitor AK295 (\nMcGonigal et al., 2010\n) or an equivalent volume of DMSO vehicle control added for 10 min along with 40% NHS.\n\n2.5. Live imaging\nZ\n-stacks of explant regions with high numbers of MNTs were acquired using a Zeiss LSM7 MP system, using a 20\u00d7/1.0NA water-immersion objective lens and a tuneable titanium/sapphire solid-state 2-photon excitation source (Chameleon Ultra II; Coherent Laser Group), tuned to 840 nm. Light was first filtered through a 685-nm LP dichroic. For FRET imaging, an LSM binary GaAsP photodetector module was used with CFP/YFP filterset cube (BP 455\u2013500/BP 525\u2013570) with an LP510 dichroic mirror.\nAfter NHS incubation, tissue was rapidly rinsed 3\u00d7with Ringer\u2019s and images were taken between 11 and 12 min after NHS was initially added. To minimise imaging time and prevent photodamage to the tissue, images were taken with 1.2\u20131.3 \u03bcm z-slice and pixel size of 754 nm with 2\u00d7 line averaging.\n\n2.6. Image analysis and quantification\nRatios of citrine/CFP were calculated using the Fiji distribution of ImageJ software (version 1.52b) (\nSchindelin et al., 2012\n). Areas of interest were drawn overlying either a MNT, single axon (innervating an already measured MNT), or axons constituting a small bundle (< 15 \u03bcm), medium bundle (15\u201335 \u03bcm) or large bundle (>35 \u03bcm) as defined by (\nMcGonigal et al., 2010\n)(\nFig. 1B\n). For each of these areas, intensity measurements were taken of axonal citrine and CFP at each timepoint. Background measurements for each channel were also taken and subtracted from each measurement before calculating the ratio of citrine/CFP for each individual axon at each timepoint.\nFig. 1. Axonal calcium influx after complement-mediated injury appears to occur as a retrograde wave starting at the MNT.\nOpen in a new tab\nA: Ratiometric calcium images from maximum intensity projections showing axonal calcium at different timepoints. Colour key demonstrates relative calcium levels, with \u201chotter\u201d colours indicating higher calcium and brightness indicating fluorescent intensity. Insets show changes at individual MNTs. B: Image showing examples of axon categories: MNT, single axon, small (<15 \u03bcm), medium (15\u201335 \u03bcm) and large (>35 \u03bcm) bundles. C: Changes in calcium (\u0394 Citrine/CFP) over time (two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test, * =\np\n< 0.05, ** =\np\n< 0.01, *** =\np\n< 0.001, **** =\np\n< 0.0001 vs Ab only). D: Graph combining \u0394 Citrine/CFP for axons of different types within Ab+NHS treated explants (two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison\u2019s test, * = vs MNT (\np\n< 0.05), ** = vs MNT (\np\n< 0.01), *** = vs MNT (\np\n< 0.001), **** = vs MNT (\np\n< 0.0001), ## = vs single axon (\np\n< 0.01), #### = vs single axon (\np\n< 0.0001), \u00a4 = vs small bundle (\np\n< 0.05), \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 = vs small bundle (\np\n< 0.001) \u2020 = vs medium bundle (\np\n< 0.05). E: Peak calcium levels of measured axons at different sites. For Ab only vs Ab+NHS, data were compared by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Sidak\u2019s multiple comparison\u2019s test). Within Ab+NHS treated explants; data were compared by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison\u2019s test). # = vs Ab only (\np\n< 0.05), ## = vs Ab only (\np\n< 0.01), ### = vs Ab only (\np\n< 0.001), ** =\np\n< 0.01, *** =\np\n< 0.001.\nn\n= 3 Ab only,\nn\n= 4 Ab + NHS.\nThe morphology of axons was classed as either \u201cunaffected\u201d, \u201cswollen\u201d or \u201cfragmented\u201d. These measurements were only taken when the axon could be identified throughout the course of the experiment (some were not identifiable at some timepoints due to preparation drift, photobleaching or high background). Fragmented axons were those displaying separation between segments of the axon when the image stack was contrast adjusted.\nAxons were classed as having \u201celevated\u201d calcium if the change in citrine/CFP ratio exceeded 0.5 meaning a 50% rise in original axon calcium ratio as defined by (\nWilliams et al., 2014\n). \u201cUnchanged\u201d axons remained below this threshold and axons scored as \u201creturned\u201d were previously above threshold before returning to below threshold values.\nCalcium FRET images are displayed as ratiometric images. To create these, in the FIJI distribution of Image J, a maximum intensity projection (MIP) of\nZ\n-stack images was created, the CFP and citrine channels were split and a binary mask from one of these channels was created (whichever had the highest signal/noise ratio). Background was subtracted in each of the original channel MIPs before using the image calculator to multiply both the CFP and citrine MIPs by the binary mask. The ratiometric image was generated by dividing the resulting citrine x binary image by the CFP x binary image. Display was scaled to 8 bit (min set to 0 and max to 2) then a LUT (mpl-plasma) was applied to the resulting image. This image was then copied to Adobe photoshop (version CS5.1) along with the MIP of the single channel originally used as the binary mask. The ratiometric image was pasted as an overlay layer above the single channel image and despeckle filter was applied (\nWitte et al., 2019\n).\n\n2.7. Immunofluorescence staining\nTo quantify presence of anti-GD1b antibody, complement and axonal proteins, immunofluorescence staining was performed. Explants from C57 Bl/6 mice were halved at the ribcage to allow 2 TS muscles from each animal, one to be used as Ab only control and one to be Ab+NHS treated. Injury was otherwise carried out as above (section: Ex vivo injury model). After treatment, explants were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in PBS, 0.1 M glycine and PBS again for 5 min each. Tissue was then incubated in freezing ethanol (100%) for 10 min at -20 \u00b0C. Primary antibodies were added overnight in PBS with 3% (v/v) normal goat serum (NGS) and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Antibodies used were rat anti-MBP (Bio-Rad Cat# MCA409S, RRID:AB_325004; 1/500), mouse anti-phosphorylated neurofilament-H antibody SMI-31 (BioLegend Cat# 801602, RRID:AB_2715851; 1/1500), mouse anti-non-phosphorylated neurofilament-H antibody SMI-32 (BioLegend Cat# 801701, RRID:AB_ 2564642; 1/1500), mouse anti-MAC (Agilent Cat# M0777, RRID:AB_2067162; 1/50) and mouse anti-Ankyrin G (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# 33-8800, RRID:AB_2533145; 1/100).\nSecondary antibodies were prepared at a 1/500 dilution in PBS with 3% NGS: Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated anti-rat IgG (T Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A-21434, RRID:AB_2535855), Alexa Fluor 646 conjugated anti-mouse IgG1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A-21240, RRID: AB_2535809), Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti-mouse IgG2a (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A-21131, RRID:AB_2535771) and Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated IgG3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A-21151, RRID: AB_2535784). Quantitative images were taken on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope and representative images were taken on a Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope with ApoTome attachment.\n\n2.8. FM-143 uptake\nEx vivo injury was performed as above (section: Ex vivo injury model), with the addition of Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated \u03b1-bungarotoxin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#\nB35450\n; 1/500) alongside MOG1 antibody incubation. Instead of fixation, explants were loaded with FM 1\u201343 dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#\nT35356\n) at a final concentration of 2 \u03bcM in a high [K]\n+\nRinger\u2019s solution (KCl concentration was increased to 56 mM and NaCl was reduced to 65 mM). Dye was loaded for 5 min at room temperature then explants were washed for 3 \u00d7 10 min in Ringer\u2019s solution with no Ca\n2+\n, to reduce membrane activity and therefore destaining of FM 1\u201343. Explants were then viewed live on a Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThirty-three male Long Evans rats (3\u20134 month-old and 200\u2013224g at study onset; Envigo, IN) were used in this study. Animals were individually housed in a plexiglass cage and maintained on a 12:12 light/dark cycle. Food and water were provided\nad libitum\n, with the exception of two days of restricted food access prior to baited Y-maze (BYM) testing as described below. All experiments were conducted under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Cleveland Clinic (protocol number: 2019\u20132133).\n\nExperimental design\nThe experimental design is provided in\nFig 1A\n. Baseline performance on BYM and novel object recognition (NOR) task was recorded the week prior to mPFC-CCI induction (week 0). Five animals received no surgery and assigned into Na\u00efve group (n = 5). All remaining 28 animals underwent mPFC-CCI and were allowed to recover spontaneously for a period of six weeks (Weeks 1 to 6). At the start of week 7, all 27 surviving animals underwent DBS macroelectrode implantation in the left cerebellar LCN of all animals. We chose to implant the electrode unilaterally to allow for side-to-side comparisons with an internal control for better characterization of treatment effects. After electrode implantation the animals were then allowed to recover for one week post-surgery (Week 7). During week 8, the BYM and NOR tests were repeated to establish pre-treatment, baseline performance levels. Performance on the BYM was used to pseudo-randomize (severity matching) the 26 animals that survived mPFC CCI across two experimental groups: STIM (CCI with stimulation; n = 13); Ctrl (CCI without stimulation; n = 13). At the start of week 9, LCN DBS was activated for animals in the STIM group and continued for a total of four weeks (Week 9\u201312). Four days after the onset of the stimulation protocol, all experimental animals underwent Barnes maze testing for 10 consecutive days (Weeks 9 and 10; the first and second weeks of stimulation phase [SP] labeled as SP1 and SP2 respectively). The Barnes maze probe test was subsequently performed at the end of Weeks 11 and 12 (SP3 and SP4, respectively). Finally, during week 12 (SP4), the BYM and NOR tests were repeated. Animals were euthanized after Week 12 (SP4) and post-mortem tissue was collected for further analysis.\n\nInduction of mPFC-CCI\nThe TBI lesion was induced by applying a CCI across the mPFC using coordinates previously described (\nCope et al., 2012\n;\nVonder Haar et al., 2014\n). Briefly, animals were anesthetized with ketamine (50mg/kg, i.p.) and dexmedetomidine (0.2mg/kg, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic frame. Following a midline incision, a 6.0 mm circular craniotomy centered over the mPFC (anterioposterial, AP: +3.00mm, ML: 0.0mm; relative to bregma) was created. The impactor (5.0 mm in diameter) of the CCI system (Impact One, Leica, IL) was placed on the surface of the mPFC without depressing brain tissue. The parameters for impact were pre-set as: impact speed: 2.25m/s, depth advanced 2.5mm and dwell time 0.5 sec. Afterward, the craniotomy was sealed with sterile cellulose paper fixed with VetBond followed by approximation and suturing the scalp wound margins. Anesthesia was reversed using atipemezole (1mg/kg, i.p.). Post-operative care included analgesia (buprenorphine: 0.05 mg/kg, s.c.; 2 days post-surgery) and antibiotic administration (15mg/kg cephazolin, s.c.) as well as regular monitoring for changes in weight or signs of pain and distress.\n\nElectrode implantation\nSix weeks after CCI induction, animals in the Ctrl and STIM groups underwent a second surgical procedure for placement of the LCN DBS macroelectrode (MS306, Plastics One, Inc., VA, USA). Briefly, animals were anesthetized as described for CCI induction and secured in the stereotaxic frame. Following a midline incision, a bur hole was created and the macroelectrode was inserted into the left LCN (AP: \u22122.00 mm; ML: +3.6 mm; and DV: +3.7 mm; relative to the interaural point). The interaural system was used as reference as bregma was typically damaged during the CCI craniotomy (\nDe Vloo and Nuttin, 2019\n;\nPaxinos et al., 1985\n). Four screws were placed across the exposed calvaria to serve as anchors and dental acrylic was applied to secure the electrode. Anesthesia was reversed using atipemezole (1mg/kg, i.p.). Post-operative care included prophylactic analgesia (buprenorphine: 0.05 mg/kg, s.c.; 2 days post-surgery) and antibiotic administration (15mg/kg cephazolin, s.c.) as well as regular monitoring for changes in weight or signs of pain and distress.\n\nElectrical stimulation in the LCN\nAt the end of Week 8 and immediately prior to the start of LCN DBS, the impedance of the implanted electrode was evaluated to ensure implant integrity. Animals with impedance values greater than 50k\u03a9 were removed from the study. Impedance value across the two implanted experimental cohorts ranged from 16 to 42k\u03a9. Thereafter, the stimulation-induced side-effect threshold was established through visual observation by an experienced investigator as described previously (\nChan et al., 2018b\n;\nCooperrider et al., 2014\n). Briefly, 30Hz stimulation was delivered in the form of charge-balanced, square wave pulses (pulse width: 400 \u03bcsec) using a constant-current stimulus isolation unit (SIU; Model SIU-102, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) controlled by a stimulator (Grass S88, West Warwick, RI). Pulse amplitude was individually-set for each animal at 80% of the value that elicited a reproducible contralateral or axial motor response (threshold range: 72\u2013144 \u03bcA). During the stimulation phase (weeks 9\u201312 [SP1\u2013SP4]) animals in the STIM group received DBS for 12 h daily during the active phase of the dark/light cycle. Ctrl animals were similarly tethered to the commutator but no stimulation was delivered. The integrity of the electrodes and cables was confirmed regularly through periodic impedance checks. Animals in the na\u00efve group were housed in identical cages, but not tethered.\n\nCognitive function assessments\nThe Barnes maze is used to assess long-term spatial memory (\nMaegele et al., 2015\n;\nMcAteer et al., 2016\n), with subsequent probe tests administered to evaluate retention. The task involved 10 days of serial training/assessment followed by two additional probe tests administered one (PT1) and two (PT2) weeks after the end of training. Briefly, the animal was placed on a circular platform (1.2 meter in diameter) with 20 holes (10 cm in diameter) evenly-spaced around the perimeter, one of which passed through to an escape box secured underneath the platform. During an initial training session, the animal was placed on the platform and guided to the escape box where, upon entry, it was allowed to habituate for a period of two minutes. Thereafter, the test was repeated such that the animal was allowed up to five minutes to locate and enter the escape box independently. If it failed to do so by the end of five minutes, the operator guided the animal into it. The latency for successfully box entry is recorded. To evaluate memory retention, additional probe tests were performed seven (PT1: the end of SP3) and 14 (PT2: the end of SP4) days after the last day of the 10-day testing period. All testing was performed in a dedicated room under white ambient lighting. All sessions were video-recorded. The navigation pattern of each animals in each session was scored as \u201crandom\u201d (defined as crossing the maze center area three times or more while checking different holes without a discernible pattern), \u201cSerial\u201d (defined as navigating along the maze perimeter in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction until the escape box is located) andefined as locating and entering the escape box after checking three or fewer non-target holes) by an operator blinded to experimental cohort (\nRosenfeld and Ferguson, 2014\n).\nBYM is used to assess the long-term spatial memory and was performed over a period of two days using the modifications described by Yang (\nYang et al., 2014\n). As shown in\nFigure 1A\n, it was repeated three times across the experimental timeline: Pre-CCI, post-CCI (pre-treatment) and during week four of stimulation (SP4). Briefly, the animal is food restricted (11.5\u201312.5g rat diet per day was provided) for two days prior to testing. Thereafter, on day 1 of testing, it is placed in one of the three arms of the Y-maze (Start arm; dimension of all three arms: Length: 50cm; Width: 11cm; Height: 30cm) and allowed to freely navigate the Start arm (height from floor: 70cm). After 20 seconds, a door at the end of the Start arm is opened by the experimenter, allowing the animal free access to either of the two remaining arms. Once the animal enters another arm, the door for that arm is closed. This process is repeated a total of ten times per animal in order to establish a preferred arm choice for each. Thereafter, a sugar pellet reward (45mg) is placed in the arm opposite to the preferred arm. This design is intended to minimize the possibility of the animal entering the rewarded arm as a result of natural preference. During actual testing, upon entering one of the two arms, the door was closed by experimenter and the animal allowed to explore for the reward for 30 seconds. Afterward, the animal was guided back to the Start arm and stationed there for 20 seconds while both arms are cleaned with 10% ethanol. Tests were repeated in the same manner until the animal achieved an index success rate marked by five consecutive entries into the rewarded arm. On average, animals required approximately 30 trials to establish success. On day two, each animal was re-tested, with the pattern of arm entry recorded across 20 consecutive trial administrations. The successful entry rate was defined as:\n[\nR\ne\nw\na\nr\nd\ne\nd\na\nr\nm\ne\nn\nt\nr\ny\n]\n20\n*\n100\n%\nThe NOR task is a metric of recognition memory (\nThanapreedawat et al., 2013\n) that was applied at the same intervals as described for the BYM (\nFigure 1A\n). It consists of two different sessions: habituation and testing, which are administered with a 30 min interval (\nDong et al., 2018\n;\nPezze et al., 2015\n). During the habituation session, animals are placed in a chamber (dimension: Length: 55cm; Width: 40cm; Height: 27cm) with two identical objects and allowed to explore the objects for four minutes. During the testing session, animals are placed in the same chamber with one of the familiar objects still present but the other replaced with a novel object. The animal is again allowed four minutes to explore the environment. Exploration is video-recorded and the time spent exploring each object is quantified off-line by an operator blind to experimental cohort. The discrimination index, indicating the preference to the novel object, is defined as:\nT\ni\nm\ne\nf\no\nr\nn\no\nv\ne\nl\no\nb\nj\ne\nc\nt\nT\ni\nm\ne\nf\no\nr\nn\no\nv\ne\nl\no\nb\nj\ne\nc\nt\n+\nT\ni\nm\ne\nf\no\nr\no\nl\nd\no\nb\nj\ne\nc\nt\n*\n100\n%\n.\n\nElimination of experimental animals and grouping\nThe study started with 33 animals, four of which were withdrawn over the course of the study (\nFig 1B\n). Two animals died prior to randomization, with one lost during CCI induction and the other during LCN electrode implantation. As a result, thirty-one animals were randomized across three different experimental groups: Na\u00efve (n=5), Ctrl (n=13) and STIM (n=13). Two additional animals were withdrawn post-randomization from the STIM group due to poor electrode placement, defined as the tip of electrode track located outside (>50\u03bcm) of the LCN, as determined through post-mortem examination of the histological samples (\nFig. 1C\n). The final N for the STIM cohort was eleven. One animal from the Ctrl group did not experience a post-CCI deficit in NOR performance (less than 5% decrease relative to the pre-CCI baseline performance) and was removed from that analysis only. Sample size was determined based on pilot data from the Novel Object Recognition task, wherein it was determined that ten animals per group (STIM and Ctrl) were required to detect a post-stimulation group difference of at least 15 percentage points with 80% power.\n\nEuthanasia and tissue processing\nUpon reaching the experimental endpoint, animals were randomly assigned to two different protocols of perfusion for different post-mortem analyses, namely immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot. All animals were first administered an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p.), with those assigned to IHC (13 animals: 7 Ctrl and 6 STIM) undergoing transcardial perfusion using cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% PFA (EMS, PA) and those assigned to Western blot (16 animals: 5 Na\u00efve, 6 Ctrl and 5 STIM) perfused with only PBS. After harvesting the tissue sample for Western blot, the brain blocks of all animals with PBS-only perfusion, including the Na\u00efve animals, were further fixed with 4% PFA. Tissue from all Na\u00efve animals was analyzed in both IHC and Western blot.\nFor Western Blot, tissue samples from contra- and ipsilateral (relative to the implanted LCN electrode) perilesional frontal cortex were harvested, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in \u221280\u00b0C freezer.\nPFA-perfused brain blocks were preserved in 4% PFA for an extra 24 hours followed by cryoprotection in 30% sucrose solution/PBS. 30\u03bcm free-floating sections (a postmortem cut was created at the left ventral part of the brain blocks to indicate the hemisphere ipsilateral to the implanted LCN electrode) in the region of the perilesional prefrontal cortex were collected and stored in PBS with sodium azide until the histological analyses were performed. Cerebellar sections (30\u03bcm) were cryostated and collected onto gelatin-coated slides for further histological and IHC analyses.\n\nNissl\u2019s staining\nElectrode placement in the cerebellar sections and lesion in the cortical sections were visualized using Nissl-stained sections. Briefly, sections were incubated in 0.4% cresyl violet (CX2065\u20131, EMD Chemicals, NJ) in 0.4M acetate buffer for 20 min followed by serial dehydration with ascending concentration of ethanol. Each section was then mounted with DPX (06522, Sigma, MO) and cover-slipped.\n\nIHC\nIn order to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanism of the LCN DBS-mediated cognitive recovery, IHC was performed to identify those cells expressing CaMKII\u03b1, BDNF and p75\nNTR\n, which are with important role in the cognitive-associated synaptogenesis (\nGonzalez et al., 2019\n;\nLi et al., 2013\n;\nSonoyama et al., 2020\n). Briefly, to ensure antigens were not hindered due to over-fixation, antigens were retrieved by treating free-floating sections with hot (90\u2013100 \u00b0C) citrate buffer (10mM sodium citrate and 0.1% Tween-20, pH 6.0) for 10 min. Afterward, endogenous peroxidase activities were quenched by treatment of 1% H\n2\nO\n2\n/PBS for 10 min. Following blockage of the non-specific binding sites by 5% normal goat serum (Millipore, CA, USA) in 0.1% Triton X-100 containing PBS (PBST), sections were incubated with rabbit anti-BDNF (1:250; Cat #: ab108319, Abcam, CA; RRID: AB_10862052), p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75\nNTR\n, 1:500; Cat #: 07\u2013476, Millipore, MA; RRID: AB_310649) and mouse anti-CaMKII\u03b1 (1:500; Cat #: 05\u2013532, Millipore, MA; RRID: AB_309787) for 48 hours. Afterward, sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit (1:500; Cat #: BA-1000, Vector laboratories, CA; RRID: AB_2313606) or mouse IgG (1:500; Cat #: BP-9200, Vector laboratories, CA; RRID: AB_2827937) for two hours at room temperature. Immunosignal was then magnified by treatment of Avidin-biotin complex (ABC, 1:200; Vector Laboratories, CA) for two hours at room temperature. IHC signal was visualized by using DAB kit (Cat #: SK-4100, Vector Laboratories, CA). Stained sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides followed by dehydration and cover-slipped for further image analysis. Images were captured under 10X and 20X magnifications for quantification and illustration, respectively.\n\nImmunofluorescence\nTo determine the presence and location of molecular changes consistent with the cognitive improvement we observed, we performed immunofluorescent staining to visualize the co-localization of pre-synaptic (synapsin I) and post-synaptic (PSD-95) markers at the perilesional cortex (\nBrito et al., 2014\n) with an emphasis on the side contralateral to the LCN DBS electrode. For this double immunofluorescent staining, free-floating cortical sections were incubated in a mixture of mouse anti-PSD-95 (1:250, Cat #: ab2723, Abcam, CA; RRID: AB_303248) and rabbit anti-synapsin I (1:500, Cat #: AB1543, Abcam, CA; RRID: AB_90757) antibodies for 48 hours. Thereafter, Alexa FluorTM 488-conjugated anti-mouse (1:500, Cat #: A28175, Thermofisher, MA; RRID: AB_2536161) and biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, Cat #: BA-1000, Vector laboratories, CA; RRID: AB_2313606) were incubated for 2 hours, followed by 2-hour incubation of 1:500 Dylight\n\u00ae\n633-conjugated streptavidin (21844, ThermoFisher, MA). Fluorescent stained sections were mounted with anti-fading agents (H-10000, Vector Laboratories, CA, USA) for confocal microscopic analysis (Leica SP5, IL, USA).\n\nWestern Blot\nWestern Blot was used to evaluate the effect of LCN DBS on the expression of certain proteins, namely BDNF, p75\nNTR\n, CaMKII\u03b1, PSD-95 and synapsin I in an effort to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) of LCN DBS-mediated neuroplasticity along the CTC pathway. Briefly, protein was extracted using RIPA lysis buffer (Cat #: 89900, Thermofisher, MA) with protease inhibitors (Cat #: A32955, Thermoscientifics, IL) and the concentration of total protein was measured using BCA assay (Cat #: 23227, Thermoscientifics, IL). 40\u03bcg of protein from each sample was separated in an SDS-protein acrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electro-transference onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking the non-specific binding sites using 5% non-fat milk in TBST (Cat #: sc-24953, Santa Cruz, CS), rabbit anti-BDNF (1:2000, Cat #: ab108319, Abcam, CA; RRID: AB_10862052), p75\nNTR\n, (1:1000, Cat #: 07\u2013476, Millipore, MA; RRID: AB_310649), synapsin I (1:500, Cat #: AB1543, Millipore, MA; RRID: AB_90757) and GAPDH (1:2000, Cat #: ab9485, Abcam, CA; RRID: AB_307275), and mouse anti-CaMKII\u03b1 (1:100, Cat #: 05\u2013532, Millipore, MA; RRID: AB_309787) and PSD-95 (1:500, Cat #: ab2723, Abcam, CA; RRID: AB_303248) antibodies were applied and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The next day, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit (for BDNF, p75\nNTR\n, synapsin I and GAPDH; 1:2000, Cat #: sc-2357, Santa Cruz Biotech, CA; RRID: AB_628497) and anti-mouse (for CaMKII\u03b1 and PSD-95; 1:2000, sc-516102, Santa Cruz Biotech, CA; RRID: AB_2687626) IgGs, were applied and incubated for two hours. The immunosignal was then developed by reacting with ECL (1705061, Bio-Rad, CA) and visualized with a GelDoc machine. Analyses were performed by comparing the intensity ratio of each marker relative to the GAPDH signal.\n\nImage Analysis\nTo avoid quantifying any nonspecifically-stained content inside the CCI core, we visually defined the perilesional area as that between the border of lesion core and 0.05mm from the border. Quantification was performed over a fixed square (0.09\u00d70.09mm\n2\n) in this defined perilesional area. The quantification of CaMKII\u03b1, BDNF and p75\nNTR\npositive cells in ipsilateral and contralateral perilesional area were sampled every ten coronal sections (~300\u03bcm) from cerebral cortical tissue between +5.64 and \u22120.72 mm anterior/posterior relative to bregma. This yielded an average of twenty sections for each animal. Cell counts were converted into density according to the area analyzed.\nThe double fluorescent IHC of contralateral perilesional cortex was examined using confocal microscopy and analyzed with a modified method previously reported (\nBrito et al., 2014\n;\nCastej\u00f3n et al., 2004\n). In order to confirm the co-localization of PSD-95 and synapsin I, images at high magnification (63x) were utilized. The focal plane for all magnifications was approximately 0.2\u03bcm in order to reduce confounds from adjacent cells. Quantification in the contralateral perilesional cortex was performed on every tenth section (~300\u03bcm), yielding an average of twenty sections for each animal. The area of signal in different channels, namely green for PSD-95, red for synapsin I and yellow for the overlay of both channels, was measured using Image J. Experimenters were blinded to sample group assignment in order to prevent bias in the quantifying process.\n\nData analyses and statistics\nCognitive analyses:\nIndependent samples t-tests were used to confirm that the two CCI groups did not differ significantly on cognitive tasks prior to treatment onset. Note that some figures include Na\u00efve group performance as a reference point, however statistical analyses were applied only on data from the two CCI groups.\nBox and whisker plots stratified by group and time point were created to visualize performance on the BYM and NOR task. BYM and NOR task performance was evaluated using a random intercepts mixed effects model for each. A mixed effects model is a flexible extension of linear regression, which allows for repeated measurements from the same animal and does not require equality of variances between groups. Multivariate normality for each outcome was confirmed visually using Chi-squared quantile by squared Mahalanobis Distance plots. Each mixed effects model evaluates change in performance on the respective cognitive task from post-CCI to SP4 of stimulation using an interaction term between stimulation group and time. A significant result for the coefficient of the interaction indicates that the two treatment groups differed in the degree of performance change over the course of treatment. Each model assumed an unstructured covariance matrix and included a clustering term to account for the two cohorts of animals.\nTo visualize Barnes Maze performance over time, data were stratified by group and time point and box and whisker plots were created. Barnes Maze results were evaluated multi-dimensionally. First, simple change in latency from Post-CCI to treatment end was compared between CCI groups using a mixed-effects model as described for BYM and NOR tasks, with time treated as categorical. Next, because the human post-TBI cognitive profile often presents as inconsistent performance, rather than simply poor performance (\nAdams et al., 1985\n;\nHetherington et al., 1996\n), week-to-week variability within and between groups was explored descriptively with reference to the Na\u00efve group\u2019s performance using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. All behavioral analyses were two-sided and carried out using SAS Studio v 3.7 with alpha set to 0.05.\nPearsons\u2019s correlation analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the cellular markers changes and the Barnes maze performance as in changes in the latency, while Spearman\u2019s correlation analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the confocal signal of synapse formation and the Barnes maze performance.\n\nOther statistical analyses:\nFor Western Blot, the signal of each band was normalized according to the loading control, presented as relative intensity (%) \u00b1S.E.M.. For IHC, the data were expressed as the cell density in the analyzed area (/\u03bcm\n2\n)\u00b1S.E.M. For dual channel immunofluorescence, the data were expressed as percentage of area covered by either channel. The statistical comparison was performed in each of the two areas (contralateral and ipsilateral). The Western Blot, IHC and dual channel immunofluorescence data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test was performed to examine differences between the contralateral and ipsilateral sites within the STIM group. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Bartlett\u2019s test were used to verify normality and homoscedasticity, respectively. Tests were two-sided with significance thresholds at p<0.05, p<0.01 or p<0.0001 as indicated in each figure. All cellular and molecular analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad, CA, RRID: SCR_002798)."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals and estrous cycle monitoring\nAll animal procedures complied with the ARRIVE guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Female C57BL/6J mice (#000664, Jackson Laboratories) were purchased for delivery at 6 weeks of age and housed in a 14:10 h light:dark cycle with food and water available\nad libitum\n. Starting 5 days after arrival, daily estrous cycle monitoring was performed between 0900 to 1100 h (relative to 1900 h lights off time) using a vaginal cytology protocol described previously (\nPantier et al., 2019\n). Mice were assessed for a minimum of 14 days to verify regular cycling prior to saline/KA injection as described below. As outlined in\nFigure 1\n, the mice followed a timeline of estrous cycle monitoring that resumed beginning 3 weeks after injection for a minimum of 14 days, after which a subset of mice were euthanized by decapitation for tissue collection (1-month groups). At 7 weeks post-injection, the remaining mice resumed estrous cycle monitoring for a minimum of 14 days, and a second subset was collected (2-months groups). At 15 weeks post-injection, the remaining mice resumed cycle monitoring again, and samples were collected for the 4-months groups. Cycle length (period) was calculated as the number of days required to progress from one day of estrus through each stage to the next day of estrus.\nFigure 1. Experimental timeline.\nOpen in a new tab\nSchematic of procedures and timepoints for each component. Note that each timepoint has 4 groups: IHKA-L, IHKA-R, Con-L, and Con-R. At the time of euthanasia, trunk blood, pituitary, brain, and ovaries were collected from each animal. wpi = weeks post-injection.\n\n2.2. Intracranial surgeries and post-operative acute seizure video monitoring\nMice aged postnatal day 60 and older underwent stereotaxic unilateral injection of KA (Tocris Bioscience; 50 nL of 20 mM prepared in 0.9% sterile saline) into the left or right dorsal hippocampal region (from Bregma: 2.0 mm posterior, 1.5 mm lateral, 1.4 mm ventral to the cortical surface) as previously described (\nLi et al., 2017\n). All injections were performed on diestrus. Age-matched controls were injected with the same volume of saline at the same location. All surgeries were performed under isoflurane anesthesia (2\u20133%, vaporized in 100% oxygen). During recovery immediately after injection, IHKA mice were video recorded (iSpyConnect) following injection via webcam (Logitech C930e). Videos were scored using the Racine scale (\nRacine, 1972\n), and the time and stage of the first behavioral seizure at or above stage 3 were recorded. Following injection, animals were housed in groups of 2\u20135 per cage according to injection type (IHKA or saline). Animals of all injection types were housed adjacent to each other on the same rack in the same room.\nTo demonstrate the efficacy of chronic spontaneous seizure development in IHKA mice, 42 animals underwent a second surgery for electroencephalography (EEG) electrode implantation 14 days after IHKA injection. Two twisted bipolar electrodes (P1 Technologies) were implanted into the ipsilateral hippocampus slightly dorsal and lateral to the injection location (from Bregma: 1.25 mm ventral, 1.75 mm lateral). Anchor micro-screws (J.I. Morris Co.) were then inserted into the skull and stabilized with dental cement (Teets \u201cCold Cure\u201d Dental Cement). Mice were singly housed from the time of electrode implantation onwards. One week after implantation the mice were connected through an electrical commutator (P1 Technologies) to a Brownlee 440 amplifier (NeuroPhase) with the gain set at 1K. EEG signals were recorded as the local field potential differential between the two electrodes (\nArmstrong et al., 2013\n), sampled at 2 kHz, and digitized (National Instruments) to a computer with recorder software written in MATLAB (\nArmstrong et al., 2013\n;\nLi et al., 2020\n).\n\n2.3. Tissue collection\nAll tissue collections were performed on diestrus between 1200 and 1600 h. Prior to decapitation, mice were individually placed in separate cages. If multiple mice underwent decapitation on the same day, mice awaiting collection were kept separate from the collection area to limit artificial stress-induced elevations in corticosterone (\nvan Campen et al., 2018\n). Mouse weights were recorded prior to euthanasia. The trunk blood, brain, pituitary gland, and ovaries were collected. Trunk blood was stored at 4\u00b0C for 24 h, then spun in a centrifuge for 10\u201315 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Serum was then isolated and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Brains were bulk-fixed at 4\u00b0C in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich 158127) for 24 h, then switched to 30% sucrose with 5% sodium azide (ACROS Organics 19038\u20131000) and stored at 4\u00b0C. Pituitaries were stored in RNAlater Stabilization Solution (Invitrogen, AM7020) at \u221220\u00b0C. Ovaries were stored in 10% formalin at 4\u00b0C overnight, then switched to 100% ethanol and stored at 4\u00b0C.\n\n2.4. Hippocampal granule cell dispersion quantification\n40-\u03bcm coronal hippocampal sections were collected using a freezing microtome (SM 2010R, Leica Biosystems). Every third section, amounting to four to six sections per mouse, from the dorsal hippocampal region were used for evaluation of hippocampal granule cell dispersion by cresyl violet (Nissl) staining and/or gliosis by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining. For cresyl violet staining, sections were mounted on charged glass slides, stained with cresyl violet (Sigma-Aldrich C5042) for 12 minutes at room temperature (~22\u00b0C), dehydrated with graded ethanol solutions (70\u2013100%), cleaned in xylene, and coverslipped with Permount. For GFAP immunofluorescence, sections were incubated with an anti-GFAP mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich G3893) for 48 h at 4\u00b0C on a shaker, followed by incubation with DyLight 594 horse anti-mouse secondary (1:1000, Vector DI-2594) for 2 h at room temperature on a shaker. Sections were then mounted on charged glass slides and coverslipped using Vectashield Hardset Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories H-1500). Image acquisition was performed using an Olympus BX43 brightfield and fluorescence microscope equipped with an Infinity 3\u20136UR Teledyne Lumenera Camera and Infinity Capture software (Lumenera). The degree of hippocampal damage produced after IHKA injection was quantified by measuring the surface area of the dentate gyrus granule cell layer and hilar regions in ImageJ (\nLisgaras & Scharfman, 2022\n). The surface area of the ipsilateral dentate gyrus and hilar regions was then compared to the contralateral regions in the same mouse. To account for normal variations in granule cell layer area in different regions of the hippocampus, the relative distance from Bregma was attained by comparisons to a mouse brain atlas (\nPaxinos & Franklin, 2019\n) for each hippocampal section. Only ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampal regions with the same relative distance from Bregma were compared to determine the ipsilateral:contralateral ratio. The integrated density of GFAP was analyzed in ImageJ and normalized to the overall size of each ipsilateral hippocampal region, as contralateral hippocampal regions did not exhibit significant amounts of GFAP expression.\n\n2.5. Hormone assays\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for progesterone, estradiol, testosterone, and corticosterone were performed on trunk blood serum samples according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions (progesterone: IBL America (IB79183); estradiol: Calbiotech (ES180S-100); testosterone: IBL America (IB79174); corticosterone: Arbor Assays (K014-H1)) and evaluated using a Bio-Tek 800TS Microplate Absorbance Reader. As needed, samples were diluted to match the volume required for the testing. Samples were run in duplicate where appropriate and the average of the duplicate was used as the final hormone concentration value for each mouse. Intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) values were calculated from the standard deviations within plates. Samples with CV values higher than 10 were excluded from the dataset, and plate variation was controlled for as a factor in statistical analyses.\n\n2.6. Ovary histology and follicle counts\nBoth left and right ovaries were paraffin-embedded, and six consecutive sections of 5-\u00b5m thickness were collected from each ovary and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. An investigator blinded to treatment group screened the sections to quantify the number of primary, secondary, and antral follicles, and corpora lutea according to characteristic morphology (\nMyers et al., 2004\n). The numbers of each type of ovarian follicle and corpora lutea were counted from both the left and right ovaries of each mouse and averaged to generate the final value for each mouse used in statistical analyses.\n\n2.7. Pituitary qPCR\nRNA was isolated from pituitaries using RNAqueous-Micro kits (Invitrogen). Total RNA was reverse-transcribed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions using the ProtoScript Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (New England Biolabs) as previously described (\nNantie et al., 2014\n). Oligonucleotide primers for LH beta (\nLhb\n), FSH beta (\nFshb\n), and GnRH receptor (\nGnrhr\n) (Life Technologies,\nTable 1\n) genes were used to amplify gene-specific transcripts by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The expression levels of genes of interest were normalized to peptidylprolyl isomerase A (\nPpia)\nmRNA levels;\nPpia\nis a common reference gene used as an internal control. The data were analyzed using the standard comparative cycle threshold value method (2\n\u2013\u2206\u2206Ct\n).\nTable 1.

EEG analysis\nEEG recordings were analyzed using an automated electrographic seizure analyzer based in MATLAB (\nZeidler et al., 2018\n) with minimum seizure duration set at five seconds and minimum interictal interval at six seconds. Thresholds for detection were selected for each mouse based on automated recommendations within the program. If the recording displayed too much noise to obtain an accurate threshold from the automated program, the data were manually reviewed for seizure activity. Seizure burden parameters were calculated from continuous 24-hour recordings from seven consecutive days collected 1 month after injection.\n\n2.9. Statistics\nStatistical analyses were conducted in R (R Core Team, 2021). Comparisons between IHKA-L and IHKA-R groups for seizure parameters were conducted using Student\u2019s t-tests. Comparisons between control and IHKA treatment groups and left- vs. right-sided injection groups for hippocampal granule cell dispersion, pituitary mRNA expression levels, and ovary follicle numbers were made using two-way ANOVAs followed by Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\ntests. The data for hippocampal granule cell dispersion and pituitary mRNA expression were log-transformed to achieve normality. Comparisons between injection side treatment groups and groups with and without dispersion for GFAP intensity were made using two-way ANOVAs. Comparisons for estrous cycle length were made using two-way ANOVAs (side of injection and saline/KA as factors) and Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\ntests for each time point. Comparisons between treatment group, left or right injection group, and time after injection (1, 2, or 4 months) for weight gain were made using three-way ANOVAs and Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\ntests. As informed by Box-Cox normality plots, cycle length data were transformed with a negative exponent, and weight data were log-transformed to achieve normality. Comparisons between treatment group, left or right injection group, and ELISA plate group for hormone analyses were made using three-way ANOVAs. Hormone data were log-transformed to achieve normality, which was evaluated with Shapiro-Wilks tests. Correlations between degree of granule cell dispersion and cycle length were made using Pearson\u2019s correlations, and comparisons of proportions of animals exhibiting granule cell dispersion were made with chi-square tests. The criterion for statistical significance was p \u2264 0.05. Results are reported as means \u00b1 SEM."

Mice and experimental groups\nAll surgical and postoperative care procedures were performed in accordance with The Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. In GR\nf/f\nmice (B6.129S6-Nr3c1tm2.1Ljm/J, JAX stock #012914, RRID:IMSR_JAX:012914), exon 2 of\nNr3c1\nis flanked by\nlox P\nsites in order to attain targeted deletion of GR (\nNr3c1\n) (\nBrewer et al., 2003\n). Cx\n3\ncr1-Cre mice (STOCK Tg(Cx\n3\ncr1-cre)MW126Gsat/Mmucd, RRID:MMRRC_036395-UCD) were obtained from the Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center (MMRRC) at University of California at Davis, an NIH-funded strain repository, and was donated to the MMRRC by Nathaniel Heintz, Ph.D., The Rockefeller University, GEN-SAT and Charles Gerfen, Ph.D., National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Mental Health (\nGong et al., 2007\n,\n2003\n). Cx\n3\ncr1-Cre;GR\nf/f\nmice were created by crossing Cx\n3\ncr1\nCre/+\nmice to GR\nf/f\nmice, yielding offspring with a conditional deletion of GR in microglia and peripheral blood monocytes (\nJung et al., 2000\n).\nReporter mice were generated by crossing Cx\n3\ncr1-Cre mice to TdTomato (TdT) mice, (B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato) Hze/J, JAX Stock #007909, RRID:IMSR_JAX:007909) (\nMadisen et al., 2010\n). Specificity of Cre-mediated recombination in myeloid cells was confirmed by immunostaining organs and tissue obtained from na\u00efve Cx\n3\ncr1-Cre;TdT reporter mice with myeloid cell markers (\nSup. Fig. 1A\n-\nE\n). Cx\n3\ncr1-Cre;TdT reporter expression is red and myeloid cell markers are (pseudocolored) in cyan (\nSup. Fig. 1A\n-\nE\n). The markers used (Iba1, P2RY12, F4/80, CLEC4F, see\nTable 1\nKey Resources Table) were chosen for their specificity to myeloid cells in target tissues. In spinal cord, Iba1 is a pan-macrophage marker and P2RY12 is specific to microglia (\nButovsky et al., 2014\n). In the spleen, F4/80 labels red pulp macrophages (\nKohyama et al., 2009\n). Monocyte-derived and tissue-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) in the liver are identified by F4/80, and liver Kupffer cells are specifically labeled by CLEC4F (\nOuyang et al., 2020\n).\nTable 1.\nKey Resources Table: Immunostaining reagents.\nAntigen\nHost, dilution\nRRID\nVendor, catalog number\nPrimary antibodies\nCD31\nRat 1:200\nAB_394816\nBD Biosciences, 533370\nCD68\nRat, 1:500\nAB_322219\nBio-Rad/AbD Serotec, MCA1957\nCLEC4F\nGoat, 1:500\nAB_2608299\nThermo Fisher Scientific, PA5\u201347396\nF4/80\nRat, 1:250\nAB_872005\nBio-Rad/AbD Serotec, MCA497G\nGFAP\nChicken, 1:1000\nAB_2313547\nAves Labs, GFAP\nIba-1\nRabbit, 1:500\nAB_839504\nWako, 019\u201319741\nMBP\nChicken, 1:500\nAB_2313550\nAves Labs, MBP\nNFH\nChicken, 1:500\nAB_2313552\nAves Labs, NFH\nP2RY12\nRabbit, 1:400\nAB_2669027\nSigma-Aldrich, HPA014518\nSecondary amplification\nBiotin-chicken IgY\n(anti-ck-NFH)\nGoat, 1:1000\nAB_2313506\nAves Labs, B-1005\nChicken IgY-488\n(anti-ck-MBP)\nGoat, 1:500\nAB_2534096\nThermo Fisher Scientific, A-11039\nChicken IgY-633\n(anti-ck-GFAP)\nGoat, 1:500\nAB_2535756\nThermo Fisher Scientific, A21103\nGoat IgG-488\n(anti-gt-CLEC4F)\nDonkey, 1:500\nAB_2534102\nThermo Fisher Scientific, A-11055\nRabbit IgG-488\n(anti-rb-P2RY12)\nGoat, 1:500\nAB_2576217\nThermo Fisher Scientific, A-11034\nRabbit IgG-546\n(anti-rb-Iba1)\nGoat, 1:500\nAB_2534093\nThermo Fisher Scientific, A-11035\nRat IgG-488\n(anti-rat-CD31)\nGoat, 1:500\nAB_2534074\nThermo Fisher Scientific, A-11006\nRat IgG-546\n(anti-rat-CD68)\nGoat, 1:500\nAB_2534125\nThermo Fisher Scientific, A-11081\nOther dyes\nEriochrome cyanine\n10 g/L in H\n2\nO\nn/a\nMillipore Sigma 1.03164\nOil Red O\n1% in 70% EtoH\nn/a\nSigma-Aldrich, O0625\nOpen in a new tab\nGenetic deletion of GR was confirmed using PCR (\nSup.

The 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder (1Kb+) was used to measure DNA weight on the gel (Thermo Fisher, catalog #10787018). For band visualization, grayscale images were inverted and the brightness/contrast intensity was set to reveal the full tonal range of visible pixels in the grayscale histogram. All mice used for behavior and anatomical analyses (\nFigs. 1\n,\nSup. Figs. 2\n-\n3\n) were homozygous floxed, containing two copies of the GR flox allele (\nSup. Fig. 1F\n). Mice in the \u201cM\u00d8 GR intact\u201d group contained no Cx\n3\ncr1-Cre and mice in the \u201cM\u00d8 GR deleted\u201d group contained one copy of Cx\n3\ncr1-Cre (\nSup. Fig. 1G\n). The genotype for the M\u00d8 GR intact group is GR\nf/f\nand for M\u00d8 GR deleted it is Cx\n3\ncr1-Cre;GR\nf/f\n.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nDeleting M\u00d8 GR reduces the accumulation of activated myeloid cells throughout the rostro-caudal axis of the injured spinal cord.

Adult female M\u00d8 GR intact mice were 15.5 \u00b1 8.9.29 weeks old and M\u00d8 GR deleted mice were 14.538 \u00b1 6.553 weeks old at the time of baseline behavioral testing (no significant difference in age,\np\n= 0.6932) (\nFig. 2A\n). Animals were housed under conventional conditions on a 12-h light-dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Mice were randomized into groups using GraphPad QuickCalcs Random Numbers and age and weight matched within the study. All data collection and analyses were done with experimenter blinding. To achieve this, animals within each group were randomly assigned ID marks on their tail using permanent marker and a key, specifying the group designation for each tail ID, was maintained by an individual not involved in data collection or analysis.\nFig. 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nConditional deletion of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in M\u00d8s improves hindlimb motor recovery after SCI.

SCI and post-operative care\nMice were anesthetized using a mixture of ketamine (80 mg/kg; intraperitoneal) and xylazine (10 mg/kg; intraperitoneal). The ninth thoracic vertebra (T9) was identified based on anatomical landmarks and the lamina removed to expose the dorsal surface of the spinal cord. The exposed spinal cord received a moderate (75 kdyne) contusion SCI using the Infinite Horizons impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC.) (\nScheff et al., 2003\n). After injury, muscle was closed with 5.0 polyglactin dissolvable sutures, and the skin was closed with three wound clips. Animals were injected with saline (2 mL, s.q.) then placed into warmed cages (35 \u00b0C) overnight for recovery. To prevent dehydration and infection, mice were supplemented with daily saline (2 mL for two days, 1 mL for three days subcutaneously) and Gentomicin (0.1 mL s.q.) for the first 5 days post-injury (dpi). Bladders were expressed twice daily for the duration of the study and urinary pH was monitored weekly. Sham-operated animals received a laminectomy only and were monitored daily for overall health. Body weight was monitored weekly for all animals.\n\n2.3. Open field locomotor testing\nTwo raters, blind to genotype, assessed mouse hindlimb function in an open field for 4 min. Using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) for locomotion (\nBasso et al., 2006\n), raters evaluated ankle movement, weight support, stepping, coordination, paw position, and trunk and tail position. Scores range from no hindlimb movement (0) to normal locomotor function (9) (\nFig. 2B\n). Fine aspects of locomotion were assessed using the BMS subscore. The subscore quantifies improvements in stepping frequency, coordination, paw position, trunk stability, and tail position and is rated between 0 and 11 (\nFig. 2C\n-\nF\n). In this study, BMS scores were evaluated at \u22127 (baseline), 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 dpi.\n\n2.4. Tissue processing\nTissues for all SCI experiments were collected at 35 dpi. Mice were anesthetized with a lethal mixture of ketamine/xylazine (1.5 x surgical dose) then transcardially perfused with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Spinal cords were removed, post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight and then rinsed in 0.1 M PBS before being cryoprotected for 48 h in 30% sucrose at 4 \u00b0C. Spinal cords were blocked into 10 mm segments centered on the lesion site, then were embedded in Tissue-Tek optimal cutting temperature medium and rapidly frozen on dry ice. Tissue sections were cut in series (12 \u03bcm thick, 10 slides per series) using a Microm cryostat (HM 505 E) and collected on SuperFrost Plus slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Thoracic spinal cord sections were cut in the coronal plane throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the lesion. Slides were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until immunostaining. The same perfusion and tissue processing was performed for spinal cords taken from sham-operated animals (at 14 days post-surgery) and spinal cords, livers, and spleens taken from na\u00efve Cx\n3\ncr1-Cre;TdT reporter mice.\n\n2.5. Immunostaining\n2.5.1. Eriochrome cyanine/neurofilament heavy (EC/NF)\nSlides were dried at room temperature (RT) for 2 h, then rinsed in 0.1 M PBS. Slides were incubated at RT in methanol containing 6% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 20 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. After washing in 0.1 M PBS (3 \u00d7 4 mins), slides were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS (BP\n3+\n) for 40 min at RT. Sections were incubated overnight with neurofilament heavy (NFH) primary antibody (\nTable 1\nKey Resources Table) at RT in humidified chambers. The next day, sections were washed in 0.1 M PBS (4 \u00d7 4 mins) and then incubated with biotinylated anti-chicken secondary antibody (\nTable 1\nKey Resources Table) for 1 h at RT. Bound antibody was visualized using Elite-ABC reagent (Vector laboratories) with ImmPACT diaminobenzidine as a substrate (Vector Laboratories Cat #SK-4105). To visualize myelin, following immunoperoxidase development of NFH, slides were rinsed in dH\n2\nO and immersed in acetone for 8 mins. Samples were then rinsed in dH\n2\nO before incubation in EC solution for 30 min at RT. Slides were washed in dH\n2\nO and differentiated in 5% iron alum and borax ferricyanide for 5\u201310 min, then dehydration via sequential 2 min incubations in 70%, 70%, 90%, and 100% ethanol solutions, followed by 4 \u00d7 3 min incubations in Histoclear. Slides were coverslipped with Permount (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The injury epicenter was defined visually as the section with the smallest visible rim of spared deep blue myelin (\nFig. 3\n).\nFig. 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nDeleting M\u00d8 GR preserves axons and myelin in the injured spinal cord. A-H: Representative low-magnification (A, E) and high magnification (B-D, F-H) images of spinal cord cross sections at the lesion epicenter from each group stained for myelin (eriochrome cyanine; EC) and axons (neurofilament heavy; NFH).

Oil Red O\nOil Red O staining was used to measure phagocytosed lipid debris (\nFig. 5\n). Slides were dried at room temperature (RT) for 2 h and then rinsed in dH\n2\nO and 70% ethanol for 2 min each. Slides were then placed in a saturated solution of Oil Red O (#O0625; Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 70% ethanol at RT for 30 min. The tissue was differentiated in ethanol, washed in distilled water, and then coverslipped with Immumount (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nFig. 5.\nOpen in a new tab\nDeleting M\u00d8 GR reduces intraspinal lipid phagocytosis throughout the lesion.

Immunofluorescence\nSlides were dried at RT for 2 h, rinsed in 0.1 M PBS (3 \u00d7 5 min) then blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.3% Triton X-100 (BP\n3+\n) in PBS for 1 h at RT. Sections were incubated overnight at RT in humidified chambers with primary antibodies using combinations of MBP/CD68 or GFAP/Iba1/CD31. Reporter mouse tissues were costained with either Iba1, P2RY12, F4/80, or CLEC4F (\nTable 1\nKey Resources Table). After washing in 0.1 M PBS (3 \u00d7 5 mins), sections were incubated with secondary antibodies (\nTable 1\nKey Resources Table) diluted in 4% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 (BP\n+\n) in PBS for 1 h at RT. Sections were washed again in PBS (3 \u00d7 5 min), then coverslipped with Immumount (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\n2.6. Imaging and image analysis\n2.6.1. Bright field samples\nBrightfield images of EC/neurofilament (\nFig. 3\n) and Oil Red O (\nFig. 5\n) stained sections were collected using a Zeiss Axiocam digital camera fit to a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging microscope. Sections were imaged using a 5 X objective for quantification. Images of the epicenter and 8 sections spaced 0.12 mm apart up to 0.96 mm rostral and 0.96 mm caudal were taken for Oil Red O. For EC/NF, images were taken at the lesion epicenter and at \u22120.48 mm rostral and +0.48 mm caudal to the epicenter. Representative high-resolution images of the entire section to better view the anatomy were taken at 20 X then stitched together using the Photomerge tool on Photoshop 2020.\nFor EC/neurofilament quantification, the blue EC and brown neurofilament channels were split using the Colour Deconvolution 2 plugin for ImageJ (\nLandini et al., 2021\n). The whole section was outlined and thresholded on the EC\n+\nor Neurofilament\n+\narea to determine staining percentage in the entire section (\nFig. 3I\n,\nJ\n). To measure EC\n+\narea within white matter regions of interest (ROI), 0.2 mm \u00d7 0.2 mm boxes were overlaid onto the left and right ventral and lateral white matter. The percent area of EC\n+\nstaining in each ROI was determined using the threshold tool in ImageJ and averaged between left and right for ventral and lateral white matter. The same approach was used to measure the Oil Red O percent area in whole sections and specifically within the ventral white matter and in the center of the frank lesion.\n2.6.2. Fluorescent samples\nFluorescent sections of GFAP/CD31/Iba1 and (\nFig. 1\n,\nFig. 4\n), CD68/MBP (\nFig. 6\n) were imaged using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope. Using EC/neurofilament data maps and MBP staining as a guide to identify the lesion epicenter, the lesion epicenter and sections 0.48 mm rostral and 0.48 mm caudal to the lesion epicenter were identified and imaged. Z stacks of 2 \u03bcm increments spanning the entire section depth were acquired with 20 X magnification. High-resolution images of the entire cross-section were created using automated tiling and stitching. The total area of fluorescent staining per section was calculated in ImageJ by converting each channel to 8-bit format, outlining the section, and thresholding the positive staining area (\nFig. 1E\n,\nF\n,\nFig. 4E\n,\nFig. 6I\n). The same methods were used for imaging and quantification of Iba1, P2RY12, GFAP, and MBP in intact spinal cord (\nSup. Fig. 2\n). Fluorescent sections from Cx\n3\ncr1-Cre;TdT reporter mice labeled with Iba1, P2RY12, F4/80, or CLEC4F (\nSup. Fig. 1A\n-\nE\n) were also imaged using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope and Z stacks of 1 \u03bcm increments spanning the entire section depth were acquired with 40 X magnification.\nFig. 4.\nOpen in a new tab\nDeleting M\u00d8 GR increases CD31\n+\nprofile sparing/regeneration.

K, L: Student's two-sided\nt\n-tests, n = 7\u20138 mice/group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, mean \u00b1 SEM.\nFor calculating CD68\n+\narea in the ventral white matter (\nFig. 6J\n), 0.2 mm \u00d7 0.2 mm regions of interest boxes were overlaid onto the left and right ventral white matter. The percent area of CD68\n+\nstaining in each ROI was determined using the threshold tool in ImageJ and averaged between left and right. Because CD68 is expressed both intracellularly and at the cell surface (\nKurushima et al., 2000\n;\nRamprasad et al., 1996\n), we estimated macrophage cell size using CD68 labeling. For calculating the average CD68\n+\ncell area (\nFig. 6K\n), three-dimensional profiles of all CD68\n+\ncells in the ventral white matter at the lesion epicenter were rendered using Imaris v9.1 (Bitplane) cell contour tools. Area data for each cell were exported to Microsoft Excel and averaged to yield the average CD68\n+\ncell area per animal epicenter.

    "Methods": "2.1. Viral particles\nAAV8-UBC-TdTomato were generated at the Viral Vector Core of the University of Miami.\n\n2.2. Cell culture\nPrimary rodent neurons were prepared and cultured as previously described for rat hippocampal neurons (Al-Ali et al., 2013), rat cortical neurons (Al-Ali et al., 2013), and mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (\nLerch et al., 2017\n). For neuron-glia cocultures, hippocampal neurons were purified as before (Al-Ali et al., 2013) and seeded into plates containing astrocyte monolayer cultures, which were prepared as previously described (\nBeckerman et al., 2015\n). iPSC-derived glutamatergic neurons (ioGlutamatergic neurons, Bit.Bio)(Cambridge, U.K. Cat# E001) were prepared following the manufacturer's recommendations and plated in complete glutamatergic neuron medium: Neurobasal medium (Thermofisher (TF) 21103049), Glutamax (TF 35050061), 2-Mercaptoethanol (TF 31350010), B27 (TF 17504044), NT3 10 ng/ml (R&D 267-N3-025), BDNF 5 ng/ml (R&D 248-BDB-005), doxycycline (Sigma D9891)). To avoid edge well effects, all cells were cultured in the inner 60 wells of 96-well plates, and edge wells were filled with PBS.\n\n2.3. Neurite outgrowth assay\nNeurons were seeded into PDL-coated 96-well plates (or those containing astrocyte monolayers), allowed to adhere for 24 h (human iPSC-derived glutamatergic neurons, 4000 cells/well) or 2 h (all other neurons), treated with compounds, then incubated for either 48 h (rat hippocampal neurons, rat cortical neurons), 16 h (DRG neurons), or 24 h (human iPSC-derived glutamatergic neurons). Plates were fixed, immunostained for \u03b2-III tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich T2200; 1:2000) and Hoechst 33342 10 mg/ml(ThermoFisher Scientific H3570; 1:1000), then imaged in a Cellomics ArrayScan VTI high content analysis system as previously described (Al-Ali et al., 2013). Images were automatically traced using the Neuronal Profiling Bioapplication (Version 3.5). Raw data were managed by the Cellomics Store, which consists of an SQL database and a network-attached fileserver (HP). Data for all traced cells and the values for all the catalogued attributes (total neurite length, cell body shape, cell body size, nuclear intensity, etc) were exported from the SQL server in spreadsheet format. Subsequent data processing was automated in MATLAB. Several filters were applied to eliminate artifacts from entries using empirically determined cutoffs. For example, a minimum total neurite length of 10 \u03bcm was set for detected cells, to avoid inclusion of dead cells and debris when calculating total average neurite length. Additional filters include attributes for cell body size, number of neurite branches, and maximum neurite length without branches. After all filters were applied, the remaining objects constituted valid neurons. Processed data from valid neurons were finally analyzed to detect effects on neurite outgrowth, which was computed as neurite total length percentage of vehicle control (%NTL).\n\n2.4. Animal experiments\nAll experimental procedures including surgical interventions, behavior and electrophysiological assessments, and postoperative animal care were performed in accordance with the \u201cGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\u201d (National Research Council), and were approved by the appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (University of Miami or Indiana University School of Medicine). Animals were randomized in blocks and all animal experiments and analysis was conducted by individuals blinded to treatment conditions. Group sizes were determined by power analysis based on results from initial studies.\n\n2.5. Unilateral pyramidotomy\nAdult C57BL/6 J mice (8\u201310 weeks old) were anesthetized (100 mg/ kg Ketamine, 10 mg/kg Xylazine IP). The head and ventral surface of the neck were shaved and wiped down with Nolvasan disinfectant solution. An incision was made 5 mm lateral to the midline, underlying muscles were bluntly dissected to expose the surface of the ventrocaudal portion of the occipital bone. The caudal portion of the occipital bone was removed using laminectomy forceps to expose the right medullary pyramid. A feather microscalpel (15\u00b0, Electron Microscopy Sciences 72,045-15) was used to puncture the dura and lesion the right pyramidal tract (sham animals did not receive the lesion). Muscle was repositioned following the lesion and skin was closed using 4-0 Vicryl Sutures (Patterson Veterinary, 07891-0083).\n\n2.6. Cortical microinjection\nThe head of the animal was placed on a stereotaxic frame. A midline incision was made to expose the skull and a craniotomy was performed over the left sensorimotor cortex. The compound and AAV8-UBC-TdTomato mixture (each 500 nl injection contained 1.25 \u00d7 10\n10\nGC in PBS with 20% DMSO) was injected into five sites: \u22121.0 mm anterioposterior (AP) and +1.0 mm lateral, \u22120.25 mm AP and +1.0 mm lateral, +0.5 mm AP and +1.5 mm lateral, +1.25 mm AP and +1.5 mm lateral, +2.0 mm AP and +1.5 mm lateral (all coordinates in reference to bregma), at a depth of 0.5 mm below the surface of the brain, using a pulled glass pipet connected to a nanoliter injector (WPI, Nanoliter 2010 with Micro 4 controller). After injection, the pipet was left in place for 1 min before being withdrawn. The skin over the skull was pulled back and closed using 4-0 Vicryl Sutures.\n\n2.7. Tissue processing and histology\nSeven weeks after surgery, animals were anesthesized with an overdose of Ketamine/Xylazine and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissues were left to fix overnight at 4 \u00b0C in 4% paraformaldehyde before transferring to PBS the next day. The brainstem and cervical spinal cord were isolated and embedded in 2% agarose dissolved in PBS. 100 \u03bcm sections were cut on a vibratome and mounted in Vectashield (with DAPI) (Vector Laboratories, H-1200-10), which were then imaged on an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. Completion of lesion to the pyramids were assessed by immunostaining spinal cord sections for PKC-gamma; sections were placed in blocking solution (2.5% BSA, 0.01% Triton-X100 in PBS) for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C in blocking solution containing PKC-gamma antibody (Abcam ab71558; diluted at 1:1000). The following day, sections were washed 3\u00d7 in PBS and incubated in PBS containing secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488) for 2 h at room temperature with shaking. Tissue sections were then washed 5\u00d7 in PBS and mounted in Vectashield (with DAPI) for imaging. To quantify the total number of labeled CST axons, axons were counted using the \u201cAnalyze Particle\u201d plugin of FIJI (\nSchindelin et al., 2012\n). Axons were counted in five standard rectangular areas quasi-randomly placed in the pyramidal tract, and the calculated axon density was multiplied by the total area of the tract to obtain the total number of labeled axons. To count sprouted axons, three vertical dorso-ventral lines were drawn: adjacent, 400 \u03bcm, and 800 \u03bcm lateral to the central canal. The fibers crossing each line were counted by analyzing the peaks of the plot profile at the individual lines. The results were normalized to the number of labeled CST fibers: axon sprouting index is represented as the ratio of the total number of axons that cross the three lines described over the total number of labeled axons at the medulla. Five sections from C3\u2013C5 were counted for each animal and averaged together. Experimenters were blinded to the treatment groups at all steps.\n\n2.8. Dorsal hemisection and funiculotomy\nFemale C57BL/6 mice (7 weeks, Charles River, Wilmington, MA), were housed in groups under a constant 12 h dark/light cycle with food and water supplied. We chose female over male mice because the urinary bladder voiding in female mice can be better managed, and no sex difference was found in functional and histological outcomes after a contusive SCI in age-matched rodents in our recent study (\nWalker et al., 2019\n).\n2.8.1. Surgical procedures\nAfter 3 weeks behavioral training and baseline assessments, mice were anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine/xylazine (120 mg/kg; 3.3 mg/kg). Following a cervical midline skin incision, transverse processes of C5/6 vertebra were stabilized (\nZhang et al., 2013\n). A durotomy at the interlaminar space between C5 and C6 was performed using a 30G needle followed by a pair of microscissors. The dorsal hemisection was created by using a VibraKnife attached to the Louisville Injury System Apparatus (LISA, Louisville Impactor System, Louisville, KY) (\nAl-Ali et al., 2017\n), which can produce the cutting accuracy at 0.01 mm (\nZhang et al., 2013\n). The blade was advanced 1.2 mm (dorsal hemisection) or 0.9 mm (funiculotomy) ventrally from the dorsal surface of the spinal cord, extending beyond the central canal to make sure that the dorsal and lateral corticospinal tracts were completely transected. This is critical for assessing forelimb dexterous and general locomotor function. After the injury, the mouse head was fixed firmly onto a head holder (SG-4N, NARISHIGE, Amityville, NY). A craniotomy was performed followed by stereotaxic injections of treatment compounds into the sensorimotor cortex on each side (coordination: anteroposterior/mediolateral to the bregma 2 mm/1.5 mm, 1.25 mm/1.5 mm, 0.5 mm/1.5 mm, \u22120.25 mm/1 mm, and \u22121 mm/1 mm; depth: 0.5 mm) with 1 \u03bcl/injection. Animals were assigned into four groups (blindly labeled with A, B, C, D) that received cortical injections of compound or vehicle solution. After surgery, animals were returned to their home cages and received appropriate post-surgery care.\n2.8.2. Forelimb behavioral tests\nBehavior experiments were conducted in a randomized and blinded fashion. Animals were randomized into groups and treated with letter-coded reagents. Experimenters were blinded to the identity of treatments during the behavioral tests. Upon completion of the experiments, mouse groups were analyzed and then decoded. The grid walking test was employed to assess the sensorimotor coordination and precise stepping control of forelimbs. The test was performed according to a previously established protocol (\nAl-Ali et al., 2017\n;\nWu et al., 2017\n). Briefly, animals were placed on a wire grid (10 \u00d7 10 mm\n2\n) for walking training for 3 days before experiments. The percentage of forepaw drops below the grid plane during a 3 min observation period was calculated at 3 d before injury (as a baseline) and at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after the C5 dorsal hemisection (C5-DH). Single-pellet retrieval test is a standard assessment for forelimb dexterous function. This test was performed and modified according to our previously published work (\nAl-Ali et al., 2017\n). Briefly, mice were pretrained to use their forelimb to grasp and retrieve food for 2 weeks till the success rate reached around 50%. During this period, a preferred forelimb was decided for each animal. Because all animals were provided with limited amount of food (10%\u201320% of body weight) 2 days before tests and fasting for 12 h before conducting the pellet-retrieval assessment, any mouse whose weight dropped more than 10% of the baseline bodyweight was excluded from the study. The test was conducted in a separate quiet room to minimize the environmental perturbation that might lead to distraction and inadequate food-retrieving movement. Four parameters, including fail to touch, touch, fail to retrieve, and retrieve, were used to assess dexterous forelimb function after SCI. Percentage of each parameter was calculated by dividing the number of the attempts of a particular parameter by the sum of all attempts. Statistical analysis was done using two-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test. The Rotarod test was used to assess motor coordination in rodent, in accordance with previously described methods (\nLiu et al., 2013\n). Briefly, mice were placed on a rotating rod (diameter 30 mm) on a Rotarod device (IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA) that accelerated from 0 to 30 rpm within a 90-s period. The total testing duration was 120 s per animal, and the time when each mouse fell from the rotating bar was recorded. The rotarod test was performed at the predetermined experimental timepoints.\n2.8.3. Anterograde tracing and immunofluorescent staining\nBiotinylated-dextran amine (BDA, 10,000 MW, 10% in saline, Invitrogen) anterograde tracing was performed at 8 weeks after the dorsal hemisection. Mice received bilateral injections of BDA into the sensorimotor cortex to trace the CST axons anterogradely. Five stereotaxic injections of BDA (0.5 \u03bcl/each site) on each side were made using the same coordinates as the RO48 injections described above. The injection speed was 0.1 \u03bcl/min using the Stoelting motorized integrated stereotaxic injector system (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). CST axons were visualized by immunofluorescent labeling of BDA in the spinal cord according to our previously published protocol (\nWang et al., 2014\n). Mice were sacrificed by giving a lethal dose of anesthesia and perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Spinal cords were harvested and dehydrated via increasing concentrations of sucrose (up to 30%). The spinal cords were sectioned sagittally at 25 \u03bcm (dorsal hemisection) or 30 \u03bcm (funiculotomy) thickness. The lesion was defined by immunofluorescent labeling of glia fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:1000, AB5804, Chemicon, Temecular, CA). BDA-labeled CST axons were stained using avidin-biotin peroxidase incubation, followed by standard amplification with tyramide (SAT7000, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Three sagittal sections of each spinal cord spaced 300 \u03bcm apart were chosen for analysis. The middle section was defined as the one that cut through the central canal, and the other two are 150 \u03bcm lateral to the midline section to either the right or the left side. The number of BDA-labeled CST axon fragments was counted at defined zones spaced 0.2 mm apart (dorsal hemisection) or 0.1 mm apart (funiculotomy). The axon number was standardized into CST Axon Index defined as ratio of the BDA-labeled axon number at a given zone over the total number of axons in the descending CST on a cross section of the C1 spinal cord. The lesion epicenter on the sagittal section is defined as \u201c0\u201d and all other zones are defined as their distance from the lesion epicenter."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nFour adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (150-350 g) were used for each of the\nin vivo\nacute experiments in the study. The animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Case Western Reserve University. The animals were anesthetized using 1\u20133% isoflurane for the entire duration of the experiment with vitals being monitored. A stereotactic apparatus was used to secure the head of the animal for the surgery (Kopf Instruments). The skull of the animal was exposed after a small incision rostrocaudally, followed by hydrogen peroxide and electrocautery before drilling five burr holes for electrode insertion in the hippocampus. A rat brain atlas was used to determine the appropriate coordinates for insertion along the longitudinal axis (\nHerman and Watson, 1987\n), two electrodes in the Temporal side, Temporal electrode (T), Electrode 1 (Elec 1) (bregma \u22124.6 mm, lateral 5.1 mm, depth 7.0 mm), Medial Temporal (MT) electrode Elec 2 (bregma \u22125.3 mm, lateral 5.4 mm, depth 4.6 mm), and two in the septal side, Medial Septal (MS) electrode, Elec 3 (bregma \u22122.5 mm, lateral 2.0 mm, depth 3.0 mm), and Septal electrode (S), Elec 4 (bregma \u22122.0 mm, lateral 2.0 mm, depth 3.4 mm). The reference electrode was a stainless-steel electrode inserted near the posterior bone sutures on the skull. A dental cement (TEETS Denture Material; Co-Oral-Ite Dental Manufacturing Company) was used to secure the electrodes in place after insertion. The site of injection for the epileptogenic agent was bregma \u22124.1 mm, lateral 4.6 mm, depth 8.0 mm, a 5-\u03bcL micro syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV) was also attached to the stereotactic apparatus. Finally, the coordinates for the transection/cut made with the help of a stereotactic knife (M120 Retractable Wire Knife, Kopf Instruments) was bregma \u22124 mm, lateral \u22122.5 mm, depth \u2212 2-4.5 mm, between the Elec 2 and Elec 3, the temporal and septal side (\nFig. 1.B\n). For the electric field blocking experiments, only the Elec 1 and Elec 4 were used; a glass slide was cut to obtain the glass piece required of dimensions 150 \u03bcm in width and 5 mm in breadth (\nFig. 5.A\n).\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nInduced interictal spikes propagate across a transection in the hippocampus.

Data acquisition\nThe neural signals were continuously recorded from the electrodes inserted and sampled at 20 kHz (Power Lab DAQ; AD Instruments) amplified by a gain of 100 and band pass filtered at 0.1 Hz \u2013 5 kHz (Model 1700, A-M systems). The neural activity from the hippocampus was analyzed using MATLAB (Mathworks) to extract the interictal spikes, seizure events, and theta waves. The seizure events were continuous spikes with frequency content more than 5 Hz for a duration of >5 s (\nCouturier and Durand, 2018\n;\nNissinen et al., 2000\n). The amplitude and duration of these seizure events were measured using the Root Mean Square (RMS) value with the help of an envelope method. The interictal spikes were paroxysmal events induced before and after the seizure events and were present constantly during the entire course of the experiment. The amplitude and duration of the spikes were calculated using the peak-to-peak value and full width at half height respectively. The theta periods were observed occasionally between these events; a band pass filter at 4\u201312 Hz was used to extract these theta waves. Cross-correlation and Phase Difference were used to calculate the speed of propagation of the acquired activity.\n\n2.3. Experimental protocol\nThe epileptogenic agent 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) of concentration of 30 mmol\u00b7L\u20131 was administered in increments of 0.5 \u03bcL every 20 min until seizure events were triggered to establish a baseline activity of continuous seizure events for 30 min. The knife was used to make the transection/cut between the Medial Temporal, Elec 2, and Medial Septal, Elec 3 electrodes. The transection/cut was made at an angle of about 45 degrees to the sagittal plane cutting the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus in the transverse direction. Following the cut, the seizure events recurred entirely within 30 min and did not require any more injections of 4-AP. The entire experiment was about two hours of continuous recording of neuronal activity. For the electric field blocking experiment, only two changes were made, only the Temporal electrode, Elec 1, and the Septal electrode, Elec 4 were used, and the glass piece was also attached to the stereotactic apparatus to be inserted in the same coordinates as the transection/cut was made.\n\n2.4. Statistical analysis\nAll the statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20. The data had a non-normal distribution, and thus non-parametric tests were performed to determine statistically significant differences between the propagating and non-propagating activity. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were employed to test for significance between any two groups, significance level set at 0.05. A z-score analysis of the speed of propagation values was used to differentiate propagating and non-propagating theta waves. All results are represented as their mean values \u00b1 the standard deviation values.\n\n2.5. Signal processing\nEach neural activity category was analyzed separately using MATLAB to study their other characteristics. The interictal spikes were extracted from the entire recording, each individual spike was categorized based on being observed in all four electrodes, as propagating spikes and as non-propagating spikes otherwise, observed only in Temporal and Medial Temporal Electrodes, Elec 1 and 2. Further, the propagating spikes had a constant delay as they traveled between electrodes, obtained using cross-correlation of the spikes (\nZhang et al., 2014\n) and was processed in MATLAB. The distance between the electrodes was calculated using the coordinates used at the time of insertion during the surgery, Elec 1\u20132 as 2.5 mm, Elec 2\u20133 as 4.6 mm, and Elec 3\u20134 as 0.64 mm. Thus, the speed of propagation is calculated by dividing the distance with the delay values. For amplitude, the peak-to-peak value is used, and full width at half height for the duration of the spikes. The seizure events were analyzed by first taking the RMS values, (\nSingh and Pachori, 2017\n) The envelope was computed using the Root Mean Square (RMS) of the magnitude of voltage signals. The upper envelope was calculated using MATLAB with 0.5 s window length. There is a consistent incline and drop of the envelope indicating the begging of the end of the seizure event as the frequency content becomes less than 5 Hz. Cross-correlation analysis was used to determine the delay at each of the four electrodes and therefore the speed. The seizure wavefront events were clearly distinguishable from the baseline and hence onset and offset were based on the frequency of the ictal spikes. The interictal spikes were classified in two categories: \u201cpropagating\u201d and \u201cnon-propagating\u201d based on the following criterion: spikes with a similar delay (constant speed) observed at all four electrodes were classified as \u201cpropagating\u201d. All other spikes were classified as \u201cnon-propagating\u201d. In addition to cross-correlation analysis, for theta waves, a phase difference method was also used to determine the speed of propagation. The time delay (\n\u0394\nt\n) between two theta waves was calculated using the equation,\n\u0394\nt\n=\n\u0394\n\u03c6\n\u2215\n2\n\u03c0\nf\n(1)\ndividing the phase difference (\n\u0394\n\u03c6\n) determined from the vector dot product (\nCappaert et al., 2009\n) by the fundamental frequency (f) observed. The distance between the electrodes was used to calculate the speed of propagation. Cross-correlation was also used to compare the seizure events before and after the dielectric layer was inserted to block the propagation of the activity."

Regenerating axons in the scrape zone were\nvisualized using an antibody against \u03b2III tubulin (1:2000, mouse\nmonoclonal; catalog #G712A; Promega). Growth cones were visualized by staining\nfor F-actin using rhodamine conjugated phalloidin (1:2000, catalog #R415, Life\nTechnologies). Cell density was visualized using nuclear marker DAPI (0.1\n\u03bcg/ml, catalog #4083, Cell Signaling Technology). Images were taken on a\n10\u00d7 objective in an automated high-throughput imager (ImageXpress Micro\nXLS, Molecular Devices) under identical conditions. Regeneration zone\nidentification, image thresholding and quantitation were performed blind to\nconditions in Image J for general regeneration assay or using an automated\nMATLAB script for screening. While the plates were coated with\npoly-\nd\n-lysine only, the high-density cultures containing neurons and\nother cell types produce matrix components over the culture period.\nSpecifically, laminin was detected immunohistochemically on the surface of\nculture dishes (Kannan and Strittmatter, unpublished observations).\n\n2.3. Transfection\nCortical neurons were transfected using Amaxa mouse neuron nucleofector\nkit according to the manufacture\u2019s protocol. Before to plate, the\ndissected 4 \u00d7 10\n6\ncortical neurons were resuspended in 100\n\u03bcl of nucleofector solution and mixed with 5 \u03bcg of plasmids. Then\nneurons were nuculeofected using the program O-005 and plated on PDL-coated 96\nwell plate for regeneration assay, 6 well plate for immunoprecipitation, 24 well\nplate for western blot or 8 well glass chamber slide for confocal imaging.\n\n2.4. Time-lapse imaging of regenerating axons\nFor imaging studies, six million cortical neurons were transfected with\n2 \u03bcg of cytosolic FAK biosensor for FRET imaging and LifeAct-mScarlet for\nimaging actin dynamics. The neurons were seeded in cover-glass bottom m-dish 35\nmm Ibidi culture dishes with Neurobasal medium and supplements at 37 \u00b0C +\n5% CO\n2\nmaintained imaging chamber in Zeiss LSM 880, Airyscan module\nfor all time-lapse experiments. Axotomy was performed mechanically as for the\n96-well plate experiments above. The coverslips were precoated sequentially with\npoly-\nl\n-lysine (Invitrogen; P5899 at 50 \u03bcg/ml) and Laminin\n(Gibco; 23,017\u2013015 at 50 \u03bcg/ml). Fresh media was added before each\nimaging session.\nZ\n-stacks were acquired every 2 min for total\n24\u201330 min total. Morphometric analysis of filopodia performed using\nFiloQuant software (\nJacquemet et al.,\n2019\n) with\nz\n-MIP across time scale by a researcher\nunaware of the experimental group.\n\n2.5. Cytosolic FAK biosensor imaging\nRatiometric FRET imaging was performed as described previously (\nKannan et al., 2017\n). Argon 405 nm laser\nline in Zeiss LSM 880 system was used to excite eCFP (433 nm) and collect\nemission at 527 nm (FRET) and 476 nm (ECPF alone), respectively.\n~12\u201315\nz\n-stacks with 1024 \u00d7 1024 frame\nsize were acquired using 63 \u00d7 1.42 NA objective lens at 2 \u00d7 zoom.\nAll measurements were analyzed from\nz\n-projection image. Region\nof interest (ROIs) were manually drawn in MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) and\nrespective average intensity values in ECFP (I\ncfp\n) and FRET\n(I\nfret\n) were used for further analysis. For background\nsubtraction (I\nbg\n), average intensity values for both CFP and FRET\nchannel were measured for each image. FRET ratio (R\nf\n) was calculated\nusing this formulae R\nf\n=\n(I\ncfp\n-I\nbg\n-\ncfp\n)/(I\nfret\n)-I\nbg\n-\nfret\n)\nPixel-by-pixel ratio images of ECFP/YPet were generated based on the background\ndeducted fluorescence intensity images of ECFP and YPet in MetaMorph software.\nThe ratio images are displayed in the intensity modified display mode, where the\ncolour and brightness of each pixel is determined by ECFP/YPet ratio images.\n\n2.6. Integrin function blocking assay in cortical neurons\nTo block endogenous \u00df1-integrin signaling in cultured neurons,\n2.5 \u03bcg/ml of anti-\u00df1-integrin antibody (BD Biosciences; Cat No:\n555003, Clone Ha2/5) was added immediately after scrape injury, similar to its\nuse in previous outgrowth assays (\nHu and\nStrittmatter, 2008\n). These cultures were compared with those treated\nin parallel with IgM \u03bb1 isotype control antibody (BD Biosciences; Cat No:\n553958, Clone G235\u20131).\n\n2.7. Immunoprecipitation, silver staining and mass spectrometry\nDIV 10 neurons were lysed with a RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150\nmM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 1% Triton X-100) and\ncentrifuged at 20,000 x\ng\nfor 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. The\nsupernatants were added with the antibody and protein G-sepharose mixture and\nincubated for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C with gentle rotation. The beads were washed\nthree times and the immune complexes were then resolved by SDS-PAGE. For mass\nspectrometry, the gel was stained by Silver Stain MS kit (Wako,\n#299\u201358,901) according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction, and the\nbands were excised and subjected to analysis by mass spectrometry (the MS and\nProteomics Resource of the WM Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory\nat Yale University).\n\n2.8. Immunoblotting\nCell lysate or immunoprecipitated samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and\ntransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Then, they were incubated in blocking\nbuffer (Blocking Buffer for Fluorescent Western Blotting, Rockland MB-070-010)\nfor 1 h at RT and immunoblotted with the appropriate primary antibodies.\nFollowing primary antibody incubation, secondary antibodies (Odyssey IRDye 680\nor 800) were applied for 1 h at RT. Membranes were then washed and visualized\nusing a Licor Odyssey Infrared imaging system.\n\n2.9. Expression plasmids\nFLAG-tagged Rab27b WT, T23N and Q87L mutants have been previously\ndescribed (\nSekine et al., 2018\n).\nWild-type mouse-Rph3a-DYK (#OMu14590D) purchased from GenScript was subcloned\ninto pAAVCAG-GFP vector using BamHI/\nEco\nRI digestion and used\nfor generating mutant constructs by PCR-methods using KOD Hot start DNA\npolymerase (TOYOBO, Japan) and sequenced. pAAV-U6-GFP Expression Vector\n(#VPK-413, Cell Biolabs) was used for making shRNA constructs. Targeting shRNA\nsequences are shNC:TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT, shRph3a#1:CATTGGCAAGTCTAATGATTA,\nshRph3a#2:GACATTGGCAAGTCTAATGAT, shMADD#1: CCACAAGTACAAGACGCCAAT, shMADD#2:\nGCCCATCCATTATCGAGTCTA, and shRab3c#1: CGATTCCTTTACATCTGCATT. The FRET biosensor\nfor FAK has been described(\nCai et al.,\n2008\n). The LifeAct-mScarlet plasmid was obtained from Addgene\n(#85056).\n\n2.10. Immunological reagents\nThe following antibodies were used: Mouse monoclonal\nanti-\u03b2III-Tubulin antibody, Promega, #G7121; Rabbit polyclonal\nanti-Rab27b antibody, Immuno-Biological Laboratories, #18973; Rabbit polyclonal\nanti-FLAG antibody, Sigma-Aldrich, #F7425; Mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b2-Actin\nantibody, Sigma-Aldrich, #A1978; Mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody,\nSigma-Aldrich, #G3893 Goat polyclonal anti-Rph3a antibody, Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology, #sc-14,678; Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody, Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology, #sc-9996; Rabbit monoclonal anti-MADD[EPR4919] antibody, abcam,\n#ab134117; Rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab3c antibody, abcam, #ab3336; Rabbit\npolyclonal anti-5HT antibody, Immunostar, #20080; Donkey anti-mouse IgG Alexa\nFluor 488, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A21202; Donkey anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor\n647, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A31571; Donkey anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488,\nThermo Fisher Scientific, #A21206;IRDye 680 Donkey anti-Mouse IgG (H + L),\nLi-Cor, #926\u201368,072; IRDye 680 Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L), Li-Cor,\n#926\u201368,073; IRDye 800 Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L), Li-Cor,\n#926\u201332,213; IRDye 800 Donkey anti-Goat IgG (H + L), Li-Cor,\n#926\u201332,214; Streptavidin Alexa Fluor 568, Thermo Fisher Scientific,\n#\nS11226\n; Rhodamine Phalloidin, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #R415; Alexa fluor 488\nPhalloidin, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A12379; Anti-FAK Millipore 05\u2013537,\nClone 4.47; anti-phospho-Tyr397-FAK, Sigma, ABT135; ant\u03b21-integrin BD\nBiosciences, 555,003, Clone Ha2/5; IgM \u03bb1 isotype control antibody, BD\nBiosciences, 553,958, Clone G235\u20131.\n\n2.11. Coimmunoprecipitation\nTissue was collected from 7d post-axotomy\nin vitro\ncortical neurons, optic nerve, and thoracic region of spinal cord. Samples were\nbriefly sonicated in RIPA buffer and centrifugation at 14,000\nx\ng\nfor 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. Immunoprecipitation was\nperformed by mixing 40 \u03bcg of supernatant protein with 2\u20133\n\u03bcg of control IgG or anti-Rph3a overnight at 4 \u00b0C with constant\nrotation. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with protein G-conjugated agarose\nbeads by constant rotation for 3 h at 4 \u00b0C. Immunocomplexes with the\nbeads were washed thrice in 1% NP-40 buffer containing phosphatase and protease\ninhibitors. Precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblot using\nanti-\u00df1-Integrin and \u00df-actin with appropriate internal\ncontrols.\n\n2.12. Immunocytochemistry\nAt DIV 8 neurons were scraped with pipet tip and allowed for 2 days to\nregenerate. Then, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and then\npermeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Regenerating axons in\nthe scrape zone were visualized using an antibody against \u03b2III tubulin\n(1:2000, mouse monoclonal; catalog #G712A; Promega). FLAG-Rph3a was stained with\nanti-FLAG (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich, #F7425) antibody. Then, either Alexa-488 or\nAlexa-568 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa-647 conjugated donkey\nanti-mouse IgG (1:2000, all from Invitrogen) were used to detect primary\nantibodies. Growth cones were visualized by staining for F-actin using\nAlexa-488- or rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (1:2000, catalog #A12379 or #R415,\nLife Technologies). Samples were mounted with mounting solution (Vector\nLaboratories) and observed using a LSM710 confocal microscope with 63\u00d7\nobjection lens.\n\n2.13. Mice and surgery\nAll surgery, animal handling, behavioral measures and tissue collection\nwas completed by personnel unaware of genotype. All procedures and postoperative\ncare were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional\nAnimal Use and Care Committee at Yale University.\nOptic nerve crush experiments utilized 12-week-old littermate-matched WT\nor\nRph3a\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice F1 offspring from\nRph3a\n+/\u2212\ncrosses with equal numbers of\nmale and female in each group. The animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal\ninjection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Topical 2% lidocaine\nanesthetic was applied to the eyeball. The optic nerve was exposed\nintraorbitally with care taken to avoid damage to the ophthalmic artery. The\nnerve was injured by crushing with a jeweler\u2019s forceps (Dumont 5; Fine\nScience Tools) for 5 s at a location 1 mm posterior to the eyeball (Wang et al.,\n2015). Alexa-555-Cholera toxin beta (CTB) was injected intravitreally to trace\nretinal ganglion cell axons 14 days after injury. Three days after the tracing,\nanimals were sacrificed and dissected the optic nerves.\nAge- and littermate-matched 6-week-old female\nRph3a\n+/\u2212\nor\nRph3a\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice were subjected to\nspinal cord complete crush injury as described previously (\nZhang et al., 1996\n;\nZukor et al., 2013\n) with modifications. At the time of the\nexperiment, the strain had been backcrossed to the C57BL/6 WT 6 times (F6). All\nanimals received subcutaneous injection of buprenex (0.01 mg/kg) 30 min before\nsurgery and were deeply anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (15\nmg/kg). To expose the spinal cord from side-to-side at T7 levels, laminectomy\nwas performed keeping the dura intact. The spinal cord was then completely\ncrushed for 3 s with Dumont #5 forceps that had been filed to 0.2 mm width.\nMuscle and skin overlying the lesion were sutured. All animals received\nsubcutaneous injection of 100 mg/kg ampicillin and 0.1 mg/kg buprenex twice a\nday for the first two days after surgery, and additional injections later as\nnecessary.\nFor mouse spinal contusion injury, age-matched 6-week-old female\nRph3a\n\u2212/\u2212\n,\nRph3a\n+/\u2212\nor WT C57BL/6 mice were\nsubjected to spinal cord contusion injury by utilizing Infinite Horizon impactor\n(IH-0400 impactor, Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, VA, USA). At the\ntime of the experiment, the mice had been backcrossed to the C57BL/6 WT greater\nthan 9 times (F9) and were not littermate-matched. Mice were anesthetized with\nintraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine as described in the mice\nspinal crush injury. A dorsal midline incision was made over the thoracic spinal\ncord. A complete laminectomy was made at T9 vertebral level with the dura\nintact. The mice were stabilized with forceps positioned along the lateral\nprocesses of T8 and dorsal process of T10. The contusion injury was induced by\napplying a force of 70 kdyn through the impactor to the exposed spinal cord.\nOverlying muscle layers and skin were sutured. Post-operative care was similar\nto the mice received spinal cord crush injury.\n\n2.14. Behavioral tests\nBehavioral tests were performed unaware of the genotype of the mice. For\nmouse behavioral observation, the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) was used as a measure\nof open-field locomotion (\nBasso et al.,\n2006\n), which has a quantitative scale from 0 to 9. Animals were\ntested 3 d before injury for baseline function and 3, 7, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 84 d\npost lesion (dpl).\n\n2.15. Histology and immunohistochemistry\nAll tissue collection, staining and axon measurement was completed by\npersonnel unaware of genotype.\nMice were euthanized and transcardially perfused with cold PBS followed\nby 4% paraformaldehyde. Spinal cords were dissected, postfixed in 4%\nparaformaldehyde at 4 \u00b0C, and subsequently embedded in 10% gelatin.\nSerial sections (40 \u03bcm) were collected on a vibratome (VT1000S, Leica).\nTransverse sections were collected at cervical enlargements and lumbar\nenlargements. Thoracic lesion site (from \u22125 mm rostral to +5 mm caudal)\nwas excised from each animal and sectioned sagittally, collecting every single\nsection. Sections of spinal cord were blocked and permeabilized with 10% normal\ndonkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h. Then, sections were incubated\nwith 5-HT (1:1000) or anti-GFAP (1:1000) antibody and visualized with Alexa-488\nconjugated secondary antibody (1:1000). The images were taken by the Zeiss\nLSM710 confocal microscope and analyzed by using National Institutes of Health\n(NIH) ImageJ 1.49v, as described previously (\nWang et al., 2014\n). For analysis of serotonin innervation,\nimmunoreactive serotonin fibers in the ventral horn of transverse sections were\nselected by thresholding, and then the intensity of serotonin fiber per area was\nmeasured after using the \u201cskeletonize\u201d function.\nFor optic nerve (ON) crush experiments, the ON was dissected from the\neyeball and postfixed in the 4% PFA solution. After clearing the whole nerve\n(\nErturk et al., 2011\n), the sample was\nmounted on a glass side with a coverslip for imaging. For ON axon\nquantification, the ON was imaged by using the Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope\nwith 20\u00d7 objective lens. Axons labeled with CTB (Cholera Toxin Subunit B\nAlexa Fluor 555 Conjugate, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #\nC34776\n) were counted from\nthe different distances to the crush lesion. Total number of regenerating axons\nwas counted from each image in 30\u201340 section\nZ\n-stacks.\nTo trace the CST after spinal cord complete crush, biotin dextran amine\n(BDA, Dextran Biotin 10,000 MW Lysine Fixable (BDA-10,000, Thermo Fisher\nScientific, # D1956) was injected bilaterally into the sensorimotor cortex. In\neach animal, 150 nl of 10% solution of BDA was injected at each of the six sites\n(coordinates from bregma in mediolateral/anterior\u2013posterior format in mm:\n1.0/0.0, 1.5/0.5, 1.5/0.5, 1.5/1.0, 1.0/\u22121.5, 1.5/\u22120.5) for a\ntotal of 900 nl volume per hemisphere. Two weeks after the tracing, animals were\nkilled by transcardial perfusion with PBS followed by 4% PFA. To trace the CST\nafter spinal contusion, AAV-RFP tracer virus was injected bilaterally into the\nsensorimotor cortex. (pENN.AAV.hSyn.TurboRFP.WPRE.RBG, Addgene\n#105552-AAV1).\nCST axons were counted in sagittal sections of the thoracic spinal cord\nspanning the lesion as the number of fibers crossing a dorsal-ventral lines at\ndefined distances rostral and caudal to the injury center and all sections\nspanning the spinal cord. CST axons were also counted in transverse sections of\nthe spinal cord at C1 level to capture the total number of labeled fibers.\nThe values collected from sections spanning the lesion site were\nconverted to a CST Fiber Index as a ratio to the total number of labeled fibers\ncounted rostrally, such that 1.0 would equal a count identical to the rostral\ncount for that mouse. For the crush injury of Fig.\n8, the CST axon count at 500 \u03bcm was taken as 100%, while in\nthe contusion experiment of Fig. 10, the\nCST axon count in transverse C1 sections was taken as 100%.\n\n2.16. Statistical analysis\nOne-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey pairwise comparisons, Repeated\nMeasures ANOVA, Fisher\u2019s Exact test, and Student\nt\n-test\nas specified in the Figure legends were performed using GraphPad Prism (version\n5.0d) or SPSS Statistics (v26). Means \u00b1 sem and specific n values are\nreported in each Figure legend. Data are considered statistically significant if\np \u2264 0.05. All tests were two-sided. The assumption of Gaussian\ndistribution was checked using D\u2019Agostino-Pearson omnibus test."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nEqual numbers of 8 to 10-week-old male and female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Mice were group-housed by sex in The Ohio State University\u2019s Wiseman Hall vivarium and maintained at 22\u00b0C under a 12h:12h light/dark cycle (lights on 7AM-7 PM) with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. Each cohort received either sham surgery or lateral FPI and were then left undisturbed (control; CON) or received SF resulting in four experimental groups: Sham CON, TBI CON, Sham SF, TBI SF. This study consisted of 2 time points during which animals were either left undisturbed or received SF daily for 7 or 30 DPI. In immunohistochemistry, RNA expression, and intrahippocampal injection experiments, mice were euthanized by CO\n2\nasphyxiation. The flow rates and environment of sacrifice were constant across experimental groups and controlled to minimize animal distress. In electrophysiological experiments, mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and rapidly decapitated. All conditions were in accordance with the principles set forth by the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The Ohio State University.\n\nExperimental Study Design\nThe primary objective of this study was to characterize the inflammatory and stress response to SF following TBI at 7 and 30 DPI. This resulted in a 2 (sham, TBI) \u00d7 2 (control; CON, SF) factorial design. Replicate numbers were determined with error and effect sizes of using \u03b1 = 0.05 and \u03b2 = 0.10 using previous power analyses (\nFenn et al., 2015\n,\n2014a\n;\nMuccigrosso et al., 2016\n). To determine the sub-acute effect of post-injury SF, four cohorts with equal numbers of adult male and female mice received SF or remained undisturbed until sacrifice at 7 DPI at 11 AM immediately after SF concluded. Inflammatory and stress responses were characterized by two cohorts of immunohistochemistry (n = 7/group Sham CON, Sham SF, and TBI CON; n = 8/group TBI SF) and two cohorts of NanoString nCounter analysis (n = 6/group Sham CON, TBI CON, TBI SF; n = 5 Sham SF). To determine the chronic effect of post-injury SF, 10 cohorts with equal numbers of male and female mice received SF or remained undisturbed until 30 DPI. Behavioral responses were characterized in four cohorts by open field (7 DPI), Y-maze (25 DPI), and trace fear conditioning (26\u201328 DPI) behavioral paradigms (n = 12/group Sham CON; n = 11/group Sham SF, TBI CON; n = 10/group TBI SF). Inflammatory and stress responses were also characterized by two cohorts for immunohistochemistry (n = 6/group Sham CON, Sham SF; n = 7 TBI CON, TBI SF), two cohorts for NanoString nCounter analysis (n = 5/group Sham CON; n = 6/group Sham SF, TBI SF; n = 7/group TBI CON), and two cohorts for electrophysiological assessment (n = 5/group Sham CON, TBI SF; n = 6 Sham SF, TBI CON). Hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor activity was characterized following behavioral analysis by intrahippocampal injection of GR-agonist, dexamethasone (DEX). This resulted in a 2 (sham, TBI) \u00d7 2 (CON, SF) \u00d7 2 (vehicle, DEX) factorial design (n = 5\u20136/group). A blinded investigator completed all subsequent data analysis.\n\nSurgical Preparation and Lateral FPI\nSham surgery and lateral FPI were performed as previously described (\nKokiko-Cochran et al., 2016\n,\n2018\n). Briefly, a 3.0-mm craniectomy was trephined midway between bregma and lambda on the right parietal bone, leaving the intact dura mater exposed. A modified portion of a Leur-Loc syringe (3.0-mm inside diameter) was then secured over the craniectomy site. After 24 hours, mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane for 4 minutes and connected to the FPI device (Custom Design & Fabrication, Richmond, VA) using the modified Leur-Loc syringe. For mice receiving a TBI, a pendulum delivered a fluid pulse onto the exposed dura mater. This induces a moderate TBI with both focal and diffuse injury characteristics. Sham mice were attached to the FPI device, but the pendulum was not released. The modified Leur-Loc was then removed following sham or TBI and the incision was stapled closed. All animals were placed on a heating pad and injury severity was assessed via the self-righting reflex after which they were returned to their cage.\n\nSleep Fragmentation (SF)\nSF was performed using Sleep Fragmentation Chambers (Lafeyette Instruments Inc) as the home cage to disrupt normal sleep/wake transitions (\nYonglin et al., 2017\n). SF occurred through mechanical disruption by a sweeper bar that moved across the bottom of the cage at every 2 minutes. Mouse sleep is polyphasic, resulting in multiple bouts of sleep lasting 2\u20134 minutes throughout their sleep cycle (\nToth and Bhargava, 2013\n). Therefore, the bar sweep every 2 minutes creates an opportunity for mice to obtain some sleep and resulted in a mild, transient sleep disruption. SF occurred daily from 7 AM-11 AM. This period was chosen to approximate the onset of the sleep cycle when sleep need is high and mirrors the same sleep disruption period established in previous work (\nTapp et al., 2020\n). Mice had\nad libitum\naccess to food and water throughout the SF procedures.\n\nBehavioral Assessment\nA separate cohort of male and female 8 to 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice were given either sham or TBI as previously described. Half of each group was then left undisturbed, and the other half was exposed to of transient, daily SF as previously described (n = 12/group Sham CON; n = 11/group Sham SF, TBI CON; n = 10/group TBI SF). Multiple behavioral assessments were performed throughout SF exposure (\nFig. 8A\n). All behavioral assessments began one hour after dark cycle began (7 PM).\nFigure 8. Post-TBI SF causes trace fear condition acquisition deficits consistent with compromised dorsal hippocampus function.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A)\nA separate cohort of 8\u201310-week-old male and female C57BL/6 mice received sham or TBI injury and assigned to remain undisturbed or receive 4h SF for 30 days. Behavioral testing was conducted throughout the 30 days of SF: open field 7 DPI, Y-maze 25 DPI, and trace fear conditioning 26\u201328 DPI.\n(B)\nTBI nor SF influence time spent in center of open field,\n(C)\nbut animals exposed to SF regardless of injury had decreased rearing episodes (Main effect SF,\np\n< 0.05). TBI and SF did not influence number of arm entries in Y-maze spatial learning task (D) not percent of spontaneous alternations (E). Trace fear conditioning determine dorsal hippocampus-dependent learning and memory behavior. (F) Trace fear conditioning protocol consisted of a two-minute habituation, 20s tone, 18s delay followed by 2s shock (termed trace phase), and two minutes inter-trial interval (ITI).\n(G)\nPost-TBI SF caused unique deficits in trace fear conditioning acquisition (TBI by SF by phase,\np\n< 0.01) with significantly less freezing behavior compared to both Sham SF (*) and TBI CON (#) during tone3 and trace3 phases (Bonferroni pairwise comparisons,\np\n< 0.05). The TBI SF group also had less freezing than Sham SF in ITI2, ITI3, and tone4 phases of acquisition and less freezing than TBI CON during the trace5 phase (Bonferroni pairwise comparisons,\np\n< 0.05).\n(H)\nFreezing behavior specifically during the tone phase is an indicator of short-term fear memory. TBI SF specifically decreased freezing behavior compared to both Sham SF and TBI CON groups during tone 3 and the Sham SF group (TBI by SF by phase,\np\n< 0.05; Bonferroni pairwise comparisons\np\n< 0.05). This deficit was unique to learning in acquisition phase as no significant deficits occurred in context-dependent\n(I)\nand cued-dependent\n(J)\nfreezing behavior. n = 10\u201312/group; error bars indicate SEM; * =\np\n< 0.05, ** =\np\n< 0.01.\nOpen field test determined anxiety-like and motor behavior. 7 DPI animals were placed in a plexiglass chamber and allowed to freely explore for 10 minutes. The chamber was cleaned with 70% ethanol between animals. Total distance travelled, time in center, and rearing episodes were all measured with (San Diego Instruments). Y-maze behavioral task determined hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory. At 25 DPI, animals were placed in a three-armed Y-maze and allowed to freely explore for 5 minutes. Y-maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between animals. A blinded investigator determined total arm entries and spontaneous alternations. Spontaneous alternation was considered three sequential arm entries into discrete arms 1\u20133. Data is presented as the percent spontaneous alternations of (total arm entries \u2013 2). Investigators were blinded for manually scoring arm entries.\nTrace fear conditioning determined hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. This assessment occurred 26\u201328 DPI over three days: acquisition, context-dependent freezing, and cued freezing (\nFig. 8F\n). This trace fear conditioning paradigm was adapted from a previously described protocol(\nWilmot et al., 2019\n). For acquisition, at 26 DPI animals were habituated to the fear conditioning chamber in context A for 2 minutes. Context A consisted of light gray walls and almond scent. Animals were then presented with a 2 kHz tone for 20s followed by a 18s trace period and a 2s 0.6mA shock. This tone, trace, and shock trial was given 5 times with a 2-minute inter-trial interval (ITI) (\nFig. 8F\n). For context-dependent freezing, at 27 DPI animals were again placed in the chamber with Context A. Freezing was measured over 15 minutes after which animals were returned to their home cage. For cue-dependent freezing, at 28 DPI animals were placed in the chamber with Context B. Context B consisted of striped white and black walls, light gray floor covering shock grate, and banana scent. Animals were habituated to the chamber with Context B for 2 minutes. After this, animals were presented with the same 2 kHz tone for 20s as before. This tone was presented 5 times with a 140s ITI. Time freezing was determined by ANY-maze tracking system with a 2 second threshold for freezing episodes.\n\nNanoString nCounter Tissue Processing and Analysis\nNanoString nCounter analysis was performed as previously described (\nWitcher et al., 2018\n). Briefly, after euthanasia at 7 or 30 DPI, micro-dissected ipsilateral cortex was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen (\u2212 196\u2009\u00b0C). Cortical RNA was isolated using Tri-Reagent protocol (Sigma-Aldrich). RNA quality and integrity were determined using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation assay (Agilent Technologies). nCounter analysis (NanoString Technologies) was performed by OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC) Genomics Shared Resource facility (OSU) using Mouse Inflammation v2 Panel with 248 inflammation-related mouse genes and 6 internal reference controls. Copy numbers were normalized using DESeq2 Bioconductor package in R. Gene expression analysis was characterized using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Qiagen Inc.) (\nKr\u00e4 Mer et al., 2014\n). Significantly altered genes (\np\n< 0.05 DESeq2 group wise comparisons) fold change between groups were used to determine activated and inhibited upstream regulators.\n\nIntrahippocampal Injection of Dexamethasone (DEX)\nFollowing behavioral assessment, at 30 DPI animals received intrahippocampal injection of either vehicle (Veh) or DEX to determine if post-injury SF alters glucocorticoid receptor activity in the ipsilateral dorsal hippocampus. This resulted in the vehicle group having n = 6/group Sham CON; n = 5/group Sham SF, TBI CON, TBI SF. The DEX group had n = 6/group Sham CON, Sham SF, TBI CON, and n = 5/group TBI SF. Intrahippocampal injections were performed as previously described(\nLiu et al., 2019\n). Briefly, 30 DPI beginning at 8 AM animals were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and affixed to a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments) and maintained in anesthesia with 2% isoflurane. Following three-step iodine sterilization and a midline incision, a microinjection system (Picospritzer II, Parker Hannifin Company) was calibrated using 4 points on the intact skull surface. Once calibrated, the injector was slowly lowered (0.5 mm/min) through the craniectomy into the ipsilateral dorsal CA1 hippocampus (ML: \u22121.25, AP: \u22121.75, DV: 1.25). The device then injected 0.5 \u03bcL of Veh (0.9% saline/1% ethanol) or DEX (50 ng in 0.9% saline/1% ethanol). Dosage of DEX was based on previous studies(\nSurget et al., 2011\n). The midline incision was closed with two 5 mm wound clips and the animal recovered on a heating pad.\nExactly 30 minutes after animals recovered on a heating pad, animals were asphyxiated with CO\n2\n. This time point was chosen based on previous studies of hippocampal response to DEX being maximal in the CA1 at 30 minutes post-administration(\n\u00c1brah\u00e1m et al., 1996\n). Animals were then trans-cardially perfused with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) to prepare the brain for immunohistochemistry analysis.\n\nSchaffer Collateral LTP Electrophysiological Assessment\nA separate cohort of male and female 8 to 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice were given either sham or TBI as previously described. Half of each group was then left undisturbed, and the other half was exposed to 30 days of transient, daily SF as previously described (n = 5/group Sham CON, TBI SF; n = 6/group Sham SF, TBI CON). Animals were sacrificed the morning of 31 DPI to allow for the full 30 days of SF exposure. Animals were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and rapidly decapitated. Brains were carefully dissected into ice-cold sucrose cutting solution and processed for electrophysiological assessment as previously described (\nZhao et al., 2019\n). Briefly, the ipsilateral hemisphere was cut by vibratome in ice-cold cutting solution to 400 \u03bcm coronal sections. Brain slices containing a full Schaffer collateral were identified with a dissection microscope and incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) at 35\u00b0 C for 20 min and transferred to room temperature to recover at least 1 hour before recording. For recording extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP), a custom-made twisted nichrome stimulation electrode was placed at the ipsilateral Schaffer collaterals close to CA2 area. The recording electrode was pulled from borosilicate glass filled with aCSF (resistance 1.5\u20135 M\u2126) and placed in the stratum radiatum of the CA1. The distance between stimulation and recording electrodes was approximately 300 \u03bcm. For each slice, input-output (I/O) curves were generated with varying intensity from 0.0\u20130.5 mA (100 \u03bcS duration) in 0.05 mA increments. The stimulation intensity that evoked 40\u201350% of the maximum response without emergence of population spikes was chosen to conduct LTP assessment. Paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was determined through measuring two peak values of evoked fEPSPs with varying intervals at 30, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mS and the ratio was calculated as pulse 2/pulse 1. After 20 minutes of baseline measurement (each pulse per 30 s), two high frequency stimulation (100 Hz) separated by 30 s were delivered to induce LTP. All recordings were conducted with Clampex 10.6. Slope of the rising phase of fEPSP was measured off-line with Clampfit 10.6 (Molecular Devices) and normalized to averaged baseline recording. Responses from 2\u20135 coronal sections were averaged for each animal. Investigators were blinded during assessment and quantification.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nFollowing euthanasia at 7 or 30 DPI, mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Perfused brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24 hours and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 72 hours at 4\u00b0C. Brains were sectioned at 30 \u03bcm using a LeicaCM1800 cryostat (Leica Biosystems) and stored in cryoprotectant at \u221220\u00b0C until labeling. Sections were rinsed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) and blocked with 5% normal donkey serum at room temperature, then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in primary antibody with constant rotation. The following primary antibodies and dilutions were used: rabbit anti-mouse Iba-1 (1:500, Wako, catalog 019\u201319741), rabbit anti-mouse \u0394FosB (1:1000, Abcam, catalog ab184938), rabbit anti-mouse Ser211-phosphorylated glucocorticoid receptor (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog 4161). Iba-1 labels microglia and can be used as an indicator of microglial reactivity by increased percent area of positive labelling. \u0394FosB is an isoform of FosB (\nPerrotti et al., 2004\n) that is an immediate early gene (IEG) with a longer half-life than other IEGs, such as c-Fos (\nMcClung et al., 2004\n), and serves as a marker of cumulative neuronal activation (\nMcKim et al., 2018\n) over the course of SF experience. Phosphorylated glucocorticoid receptor (pGR) labels GR with phosphorylated sites at Serine 211, which is similarly responsive to CORT and DEX(\nChen et al., 2008\n), indicating GR conformational change and nuclear translocation(\nGalliher-Beckley and Cidlowski, 2009\n) in response to receptor agonism and is an indicator of GR activity(\nBlind and Garabedian, 2008\n). Tissue was rinsed in PBST and incubated in fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature with rotation. The following secondary antibodies and dilutions were used: donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor\u00ae 647 (1:500, Abcam, catalog ab150075) and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor\u00ae 594 (1:500, Abcam, catalog ab150076). Sections were then mounted and cover-slipped using Fluoromount-G (Invitrogen).\nFor Iba-1, slides were imaged using an EVOS FL Auto2 Imaging System (ThermoFisher) at 20X magnification. For each animal, 2\u20133 images per area of interest were taken and percent-area was quantified using NIH ImageJ software. \u0394FosB and pGR labelled sections were imaged on SP8 Leica upright confocal microscope in optical section Z-stacks of 8\u201310 images at 20X (hippocampus, BNST) or 12\u201314 images at 10X (PVN) were captured using Leica Application Suite X imaging software. \u0394FosB\n+\ncell number was determined using ImageJ pipeline. Briefly, maximum intensity Z-projections were analyzed for particles greater than 20 \u03bcm\n2\nor 10 \u03bcm\n2\nfor 20X and 10X, respectively. Number of particles were quantified as cell number and 2 images per area of interest per animal were taken and averaged for that animal. pGR mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) was determined in ImageJ as previously described(\u201c\nDetermining Fluorescence Intensity and Signal \u2013 Keith R. Porter Imaging Facility - UMBC,\u201d n.d.\n). Briefly, maximum intensity Z-projections were analyzed by outlining the CA1 region and measuring integrated density. Background fluorescence was defined as the average mean gray value of three samples of none CA1 tissue. The background fluorescence was multiplied by the area of the outlined CA1 region and subtracted from the CA1 integrated density to determine relative mean fluorescent intensity specifically of the CA1. Resulting MFI was then normalized to the Sham CON Veh group. Investigators were blinded during imaging and quantification.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis for righting times, weight change, immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology, open-field, and y-maze was completed with Prism 9.0.0 (GraphPad). For righting time, immunohistochemistry, open field, and y-maze two-way ANOVA was performed with injury (sham, TBI) and condition (CON, SF) as independent variables. Main effects of injury and condition as well as interaction effects were considered. Interaction effects were followed with Tukey correction for multiple comparisons. For pGR immunohistochemistry, three-way ANOVA was performed with injury (sham, TBI), condition (CON, SF), and treatment (Veh, DEX) as independent variables. Main effects of injury, condition, and treatment as well as interaction effects were considered. Interaction effects were followed with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. For weight change, three-way ANOVA with repeated measure was performed with injury (sham, TBI) and condition (CON, SF) as independent variables and DPI as a repeated measure. Main effects of injury, condition, and DPI as well as interaction effects were considered. For trace fear conditioning analysis, three-way ANOVA with repeated measure was performed in SPSS (IBM Statistics) with injury (sham, TBI) and condition (CON, SF) as independent variables and phase of trial as a repeated measure. Main effects of injury, condition, and phase as well as interaction effects were considered. Significant interaction effects were followed by pairwise comparison with Bonferroni correction. For electrophysiological assessment of PPR, I/O, and LTP, three-way ANOVA with repeated measure was performed with injury (sham, TBI) and condition (CON, SF) as independent variables and interval, stimulation, and time as repeated measures, respectively. For NanoString analysis, two-way ANOVA was performed on normalized gene expression copy numbers from DESeq2 Bioconductor package in R using SPSS with injury (sham, TBI) and condition (CON, SF) as independent variables. Main effect of injury or condition as well as interaction effects were considered. Genes with significant main or interaction effects were followed by group wise comparisons using DESeq2. Though these studies are not powered to specifically detect sex differences, we performed three-way ANOVA when possible to address sex-dependent effects with righting time, immunohistochemistry, and NanoString analysis to determine significant (\np\n< 0.05) sex effects in any analyses. Analyses with no significant sex effects had data from male and female mice pooled within each experimental group for analysis. There were only five analyses in which significant sex effects were identified. Statistical significance in these analyses was determined using three-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons if an interaction effect was identified. In these analyses, male and female subjects are identified with different shapes and color. Statistical significance was determined as\np\n< 0.05 for all data. All data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM)."

Excision Axotomy Model\nArmadillo experiments were conducted in accordance with procedures approved by the National Hansen\u2019s Disease programme (NHDP) Animal Care and Use Committee, USA (Assurance No. D16\u201300019 [A3032\u201301]).\nTo induce experimental\nM. leprae\ninfection, the animals were intravenously injected with 1\u00d710\n9\nviable\nM. leprae\nderived from passage in nude mice, and followed for 15 months post-I. Seventeen na\u00efve (uninfected) adult armadillos served as controls, and underwent three 3mm circular skin punches (Acuderm, Ft Lauderdale, FL) on the abdomen. The 3mm column of tissue was removed at each biopsy site creating an intracutaneous excision axotomy (\nEbenezer et al., 2009a\n;\nEbenezer et al., 2011\n) (\nFig. 1\n). The biopsy site was allowed to heal and a 4mm concentric overlapping biopsy was obtained after 30, 60 and 90 days (\nFig. 1\n,\n2B\n). Another group of 17 (n=17) armadillos were infected with a suspension of 1\u00d710\n9\nviable\nM. leprae\n, and the animals had a similar series of axotomies 3 months (early) post-I (n=6) and 12 months (late) post-I (n=17) in order to assess the effect of infection duration on axonal regeneration and Schwann cell proliferation (\nFig. 1\n,\n2A\n). Among the armadillos used in this study, three quadruplicate sets of genetically identical siblings were na\u00efve and three sets were infected.\nFig. 2.

Immunoassay\nBriefly, Nunc Maxi sorp flat bottom plates (Thermofisher, USA) were coated with 400ng of the antigen, NTO-BSA (BEI Resources, USA), in 0.1 M bicarbonate buffer, and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) \u2013 phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The plate was incubated for 1 hour in a 37\u00b0C water bath, and then washed 3 times with washing buffer (PBS-0.05% Tween 20). Next, 50 \u03bcl of armadillo sera (diluted 1/200 in PBS) was added to the plate, and incubated for 45 minutes in a 37\u00b0C water bath. After 3 washes, Peroxidase-conjugated Goat IgG Fraction of Human anti-IgM (MP Biomedicals, USA) was added to the plate, and incubated for 45 minutes in a 37\u00b0C water bath. After 3 washes, the substrate (Sigma Fast, Sigma USA) was added, incubated for 20 minutes, and stopped with 3.6 N H\n2\nSO\n4\n. The absorbance was read with an iMark Microplate Absorbance Reader (Biorad, USA) using a 490nm filter. Samples with \u2265 0.700 OD (490 nm) are considered positive for PGL-1 antibodies.\n\n2.3. Peripheral nerves: Light and Electron microscopy techniques\nThe nerves were sectioned and few sections were processed for paraffin embedding and 5 \u03bcm thick nerve sections were stained with a modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain for\nM. leprae\n.\nThe remaining nerves were fixed for 48 h in 4% paraformaldehyde \u22123% glutaraldehyde and then transferred to 0.1 M Sorensen\u2019s phosphate buffer. Sections were post-fixed with osmium and embedded in plastic and one-micron thick sections were sectioned and stained with 1% toluidine blue. Thin 60\u201370nm sections were mounted on Formvar-coated (Sigma-Aldrich) 50 mesh grids and stained with uranyl acetate (2.5% in 50% ethanol) and lead citrate (3%). We examined the nerve sections with a digital Zeiss Libra 120 electron microscope for\nM. leprae\ninfiltration within axons and Schwann cells.\n\n2.4. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence of skin sections\nSkin samples were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/lysine/periodate for 24 hours. The biopsies were sectioned with a sliding microtome into 50-\u03bcm thick, frozen, vertical, free-floating sections, which were placed in 96-well tissue culture plates for immunostaining. Primary antibodies (diluted in blocking buffer) rabbit anti-PGP 9.5 as a pan axonal marker (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, dilution 1:10000), mouse anti-PGP 9.5 (BioRad, MCA4750GA, 1:4000) for sequential immunofluorescence staining, rabbit anti-GAP 43 (Millipore, ab5220, 1: 2000) to identify regenerating fibers, mouse anti-p75 nerve growth factor receptor (Millipore, MAB 5264,1:8000) and anti-S100 (abcam, ab227914,1:1000) as a phenotypic marker for Schwann cells, rabbit anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, Abcam, ab18197, 1:1000), mouse anti-CD31 (abcam, ab9498,1:1000) and mouse anti-CD 68 marker for macrophages (abcam, ab201340, 1:1000) were used to stain the skin sections.\nNonspecific binding of secondary antibodies was blocked with 4% normal goat serum [NGS, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.5% nonfat powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4)]. Sections were rinsed in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and transferred to secondary antibodies. Secondary antibodies (diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer) included goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10000, Vector Laboratories Burlingame, CA). The sections were incubated with Avidin-Biotin Complex solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and color was developed with chromogens. PGP 9.5 and CD68 stained sections were developed with blue/gray (Vector SG substrate) chromophore, and p75 stained sections with diaminobenzidine. Nuclear fast red and Mayer\u2019s haematoxylin were used as counterstains (\nMangus et al., 2020\n).\nTo confirm axonal and Schwann cell co-expression at the axotomy sites, and to identify the infiltration of macrophages in\nM. leprae\ninfected skin, immunofluorescence studies were done. The secondary antibodies Cy3 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Cy3 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:150, Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc), Alexa-Fluor goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa-Fluor goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa-Fluor goat anti-mouse IgG (1: 500, Life technologies) were used. The fluorescence-labelled sections were mounted in Mowiol 4\u201388 (Calbiochem) to prevent fluorescent quenching. DRAQ5 (Biostaus Ltd) was used for nuclear staining. Fluorescent samples were viewed and scanned using a Zeiss ZEN confocal imaging system.\nFluorescent samples were viewed and scanned using a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) LSM 800 confocal imaging system. The images taken at 1 \u03bcm optical Z-series sections were reconstructed into a single image, and the photomicrographs were adjusted with Adobe Photoshop CC 2019 Software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) only for contrast and brightness levels for optimal quality and positioned into the montages.\n\n2.5. Morphometric studies for cutaneous nerve fiber regeneration\nMeasurement of epidermal axonal regeneration\nThe epidermis was marked from stratum corneum to the basement membrane, the region of interest (ROI), and the length of epidermal nerves growing into the 4mm excision site were measured using a design-based, unbiased stereology method. The ROI was marked with x2.5/0.075 Plan-Neofluor objective of a Zeiss light microscope. The mean epidermal thickness of a mounted skin section of armadillos was 32 \u03bcm. Under x63/1.40 oil Plan-Neofluor objective, a hemisphere probe with a radius of 30 \u03bcm and guard zones of 1 \u03bcm of the Stereo Investigator space ball probe (MBF Bioscience) (\nMouton et al., 2002\n) was produced. Thus, the number of sampling sites to be measured within the ROI was determined. Then at each sampling site a 3D virtual hemisphere of constant volume was focused through the Z-axis of tissue sections. The stage was moved through the tissue in the Z-axis and at each focal plane, concentric circles of progressively increasing and decreasing diameters were superimposed and the item counted as a \u201cprofile,\u201d was the point where the nerve fiber transected the hemisphere boundary. The programme generates the volume based on the number of sites, volume of the hemisphere and the section thickness and the length of nerves /per volume of the tissue is calculated. All measurements were obtained using \u2018.DAT\u2019 files of stereo investigator (\nEbenezer et al., 2011\n). A systematic uniform random sampling ( SURS) on serial skin sections on the ROI and coefficient of error (CE) that evaluates the variance due to the sampling scheme was estimated. The Gundersen CE for the parameters described was 0.10 for epidermal axons.\nThe rate of change at each time point was assessed by dividing the epidermal nerve length by the number of days post-axotomy (mm/day).\nAt the distal leg, single nerve fiber entering the epidermis was counted and intra epidermal nerve fiber densities (IENFD) were determined using established counting rules (\nEbenezer et al., 2007a\n;\nMangus et al., 2019\n). IENFD was expressed as fibers/mm.\n\n2.6. Histomorphometry of Schwann cells\nAt the 3mm excision site, the scar with collagen plug is easily identified histologically by the homogenous densely stained collagen in the dermis, and the corresponding thinned overlying epidermis. Schwann cell bands within the dermis were detected in the skin sections by the presence of blue-grey colored cytoplasmic staining by p75, with oval-elongated red nuclei. The Schwann cell nuclei were quantified using a design-based stereology method. The ROI was defined as the dermal region extending from the epidermal/dermal junction to a dermal depth of 200 \u03bcm, the papillary dermis. A contour was made at that area under an x2.5/0.075 Plan-Neofluor objective of a Zeiss light microscope, and the cells were counted using x63/1.40, oil Plan-Neofluor objective. A sampling grid 250 \u03bcm \u00d7 100 \u03bcm, with a dissector height of 20 \u03bcm and guard zones of 2 \u03bcm was used. The absolute number of Schwann cells was obtained using the \u2018.DAT\u2019 files of the optical fractionator probe of Stereo Investigator (MBF Bioscience) (\nEbenezer et al., 2009a\n;\nWest et al., 1991\n). The rate of change at each time point was assessed by dividing the density of Schwann cells (total number of cells/mm\n3\n) by the number of days post-axotomy (proliferation rate/day).\nAt the distal leg, similar parameters were applied to quantify Schwann cells (total number of cells/mm\n3\n) at the papillary dermis. The sampling design achieved a Gundersen CE of 0.1. All morphometric measurements were masked from all identifying animal data throughout the study.\n\n2.7. Statistics\nAll data is expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD. Analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism software (La Jolla, CA). Comparisons between groups were made using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Association was assessed with Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis. Statistical significance was considered achieved when the value of p was < 0.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Ethics statement\nAll animal studies were performed in stringent compliance with\nNIH Guidelines for Animal Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n. All experiments utilizing animals were approved by the Texas A&M University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All efforts were made to minimize pain and distress.\n\n2.2. Animals\nThirty female C57BL/6 mice (6 weeks, approximately 20 g; The Jackson Laboratory) were housed 5 per cage, in a 12-h (6:00 AM-6:00 PM) light cycle, with food and water accessible at all times. Mice were randomized to receive SCI (\nN\n= 20) or laminectomy only (\nN\n= 10). During the study, 2 animals in the SCI group died immediately after contusion and 1 laminectomy animal died 2 weeks post-surgery. One subject from the SCI group was excluded from the post-hoc analysis, because it exhibited paw withdrawal thresholds more than 4 standard deviations above its normal range of the ipsilateral forepaw. This produced final group sizes of\nN\n= 17 for SCI, and\nN\n= 9 for laminectomy.\n\n2.3. Surgery\nSpinal cord hemicontusion at spinal cord cervical level 5 (C5) was performed as previously described (\nBrown et al., 2021\n;\nWatson et al., 2014\n). Animals were anesthetized with anesthetic cocktail consisting of ketamine (25 mg/kg), xylazine (5.8 mg/kg) and acepromazine (0.25 mg/kg). Anesthesia was maintained with 1.0\u20131.5% inhaled isoflurane for the duration of the surgery, and heating pads were used to maintain body temperature. Animals were shaved from the base of the skull to approximately halfway down their backs, and betadine solution was used to clean the skin before incision. A bead sterilizer was used to sterilize surgical instruments; surgical consumables were autoclaved. A small incision was made in the skin overlying approximately cervical level 2 (C2) to thoracic vertebral level 2 (T2). After exposure of the spinal column, C2 was used as a landmark to identify the C5 vertebral segment. A partial laminectomy was performed to expose the spinal cord at the C5 level on the right side of the spinal column. For animals in the SCI group, the spinal column was stabilized using micro Adson forceps attached to the surgical platform at the process of T2. An Infinite Horizon Impactor device (IH-0400, Precision Systems and Instrumentation; Lexington, KY) was used to administer a force-defined contusion. Force of 40 kilodynes, a 2 s dwell time, and an impactor tip of 0.7 mm diameter were used. Stabilizing forceps were removed immediately after contusion, and 4\u20130 prolene sutures were used to close muscle incisions, followed by wound clip closure of the skin. Antibiotic powder (Neo-Predef, Zoetis Inc., Kalamazoo, MI) was applied to the sutured muscles prior to skin closure. Post-operative care consisted of subcutaneous injection of banamine (0.05 mg/kg) and ampicillin (0.05 mg/kg) in lactated Ringer\u2019s (0.5 mL) once daily for 3 days, and animal cages remained half on / half off heating pads for 72 h post-surgery. Daily health checks were performed for the duration of the study in addition to monitoring animal grooming behaviors and weight.\n\n2.4. Assessment of mechanical allodynia\nTo assess mechanical allodynia, we used the von Frey assay (\nDetloff et al., 2010\n;\nFouad et al., 2020\n). Behavior testing was conducted in a blinded fashion once weekly beginning 2 weeks prior to injury (baseline) and continuing through 28 days post-surgery. Mice were habituated to the testing environment and testing chambers 1 h daily for 5 days prior to baseline testing. Behavior testing was performed in a dedicated quiet behavioral suite at the same time every day during the animals\u2019 light cycle. Before each testing session, animals were acclimated to the testing room conditions for 30 min and were then acclimated in the testing chambers for an additional 45 min. Mice were unrestrained in custom-built clear acrylic testing chambers (11 cm \u00d7 8 cm \u00d7 5 cm) placed on a metal mesh platform. Compared to larger testing chambers, the small area and low ceiling reduced the frequency of exploratory and rearing behaviors, thus encouraging full contact and plantar placement of each paw on the platform (unpublished observations). The Electronic von Frey (EVF) and accompanying BIO-CIS Software were used to monitor mechanical allodynia (BIO-CIS; Pinellas Park, USA). To obtain a paw withdrawal, the spring-tip filament was continuously applied to the plantar surface of the animal\u2019s paw to obtain a continuous reading of force (grams) to the point where the animal rapidly withdrew its paw. Paw withdrawal was defined as a fast movement of the paw away from the stimulus (\nLindsey et al., 2000\n). Spontaneous movements were not considered withdrawal, nor were instances when the animal was exhibiting aggressive or avoidant behavior toward the stimulus (such as grabbing the spring tip sensor or attempting to bite the sensor). Each mouse was repeatedly tested for a total of five trials on each paw. The highest and lowest values were removed, and the middle 3 values were averaged. A minimum of 120 s interval time between trials of the same paw was used to reduce avoidant behavior and sensitization of the paw. Fruit loop cereal pieces were administered as treats between testing periods (\nDetloff et al., 2010\n). A total of 5 baseline scores were obtained for each paw of each individual animal, to generate a \u2018normal range\u2019 equaling the mean paw withdrawal threshold \u00b12 standard deviations. Mice were determined post hoc to exhibit allodynia if they scored below their normal range for at least three out of the four post-surgical time points assessed (\nFig. S1\n). Mice were excluded from the study if they scored more than 2 standard deviations above their normal range for at least three out of the four post-surgical time points, demonstrating loss of sensory function. No animals in this study ever failed to withdraw any paw from the von Frey stimulus.\n\n2.5. Forelimb grooming score\nMonitoring of animal grooming behavior has previously been established as an assay for determining the range of motion of mouse forelimbs, an index of forelimb motor function (\nGensel et al., 2006\n). To assess grooming behavior, animals were placed in a clear bin with a smooth bottom and observed for a 5-min period. To encourage grooming behavior, a small water dropper was used to place a drop of water on the top of the animal\u2019s head. A score of 0\u20135 was assigned depending on the ability of the animal\u2019s forepaw to reach different regions of its face during grooming behavior, as previously described (\nGensel et al., 2006\n). A score of 0 indicates that the forepaw did not make contact with the animal\u2019s head at all, a 1 indicates that the forepaw came into contact with the bottom jaw, a 2 indicates touch of the top of snout, a 3 indicates contact with area below the eyes, a 4 indicates above eyes and front of ears and a 5 indicates full range of motion all the way to the back of ears. The highest score achieved during the 5-min period was recorded for each animal. All animals in this study exhibited a score of 5 prior to surgery. Grooming scores were assessed daily for 14 days post-surgery.\n\n2.6. Tissue collection\nMice were deeply anesthetized after behavioral testing at 28 days post-surgery using an overdose (three times the normal anesthetic dose) of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine cocktail injected intraperitoneally. Once deeply anesthetized, animals were then perfused transcardially with approximately 50 mL each of chilled 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline followed by chilled 4% paraformaldehyde. Spinal columns were removed and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 \u00b0C overnight, and then moved to 30% sucrose for cryoprotection and storage at 4 \u00b0C. Approximately 7 mm of cervical spinal cord spanning from spinal segments C2-C7 was collected, using dorsal root ganglia as landmarks.\n\n2.7. Sectioning and selection of representative C4, C5 and C6 spinal segments\nSerial transverse spinal cord cryosections (20 \u03bcm section thickness collected in a series of 12 slides) were used for immunostaining. The tissue was embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature medium and frozen on dry ice. Cryosections were directly mounted onto gelatin coated slides and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. By sectioning the same anatomical regions of tissue from each subject and directly mounting tissue sections to slides, tissue sections could be accurately mapped to specific spinal segments. This method allowed us to select equivalent tissue sections from each animal, taken rostral to the injury at C4, at the lesion epicenter at C5, and caudal to the injury at C6. We verified accuracy of this method using a mouse spinal cord atlas to visually inspect and verify each tissue section during analysis (\nSengul et al., 2013\n).\n\n2.8. Histology\nAll tissue sections were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C and thawed at room temperature before staining. Tissue was first washed 3 times for 10 min each with tris-buffered saline (TBS) in coplin jars to remove residual tissue embedding medium. Slides were incubated in 5% donkey serum in TBS + 0.1% Triton-X-100 (TBS-T), and then incubated with primary antibodies in 5% donkey serum in TBS-T for 24 h in a humidifying chamber at 4 \u00b0C. Tissue sections were stained with the following primary antibodies: neuronal marker NeuN (1:800, Millipore, ABN90), astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:1000, Millipore, AB5541), and nociceptive fiber marker calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP, 1:1000, Abcam, ab36001). Tissue was then washed in TBS before incubation with AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) in 5% donkey serum in TBS-T for 2 h in the humidifying chamber at room temperature. Slides were rinsed in TBS containing the nuclear label DAPI (5 \u03bcg/mL, Sigma Aldrich, D9542), rinsed in deionized water, allowed to dry, and coverslipped with Mowiol mounting medium.\n\n2.9. Fluorescence microscopy and image analysis\nImage acquisition: A Nikon Eclipse fully motorized upright fluorescent microscope equipped with monochrome camera and Nikon NIS-Elements software was used for image acquisition. Slides stained with fluorescent dyes were stored protected from light and imaged in a dark room. Images were acquired using the same acquisition settings across all samples for each immunohistochemical label. Images were exported as TIFF files for analysis. All image analysis was performed in a blinded fashion using ImageJ software. Sample sizes: Any tissue section showing poor immunolabeling or poor tissue quality were excluded from image analysis. This led to the exclusion of tissue from 1 SCI-S animal (poor tissue quality affected all immunolabeling), 5 SCI-NS animals (affected CGRP labeling), and 4 laminectomy animals (affected CGRP labeling). 1 laminectomy animal also exhibited poor NeuN labeling.\n2.9.1. Neuronal quantification\nImages of NeuN immunoreactivity were saved as TIFF files and imported into ImageJ software. The gray matter of the spinal cord was divided into 4 quadrants using the line tool in ImageJ: left dorsal (LD), right dorsal (RD), left ventral (RV) and left ventral (LV) (\nFig. 3\n). A vertical line was drawn through the dorsal median sulcus, central canal and ventral median fissure landmarks to divide the ipsilateral and contralateral halves. A horizontal line was drawn through the lateral column and central canal to create dorsal and ventral sides. To count individual cells, the counter tool was used to keep track of the cell count and total neuron counts were saved as a mask. Neuronal cells were identified by positive staining of NeuN co-localized to DAPI. Total cell counts within each quadrant were averaged across 7 total tissue sections for each individual animal (two sections at C4, three at C5, and two at C6).\nFig. 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nQuantification of neuronal density in dorsal and ventral spinal cord gray matter.\n(A) Quantification of neuronal density in the left dorsal horn (LD), right dorsal horn (RD), left ventral horn (LV) and right ventral horn (RV).

N = 5 SCI sensitive, N = 11 SCI not sensitive,\nN\n= 8 laminectomy. Scale bars = 250 \u03bcm.\n2.9.2. Lesion volume quantification\nLesion volume was quantified using two independent methods, 1) volume bounded by GFAP immunoreactivity and 2) volume of spared gray matter. Images of GFAP immunoreactivity were saved as TIFF files and imported into ImageJ software. For each image that contained an obvious GFAP\n+\nastroglial border, ROIs were drawn along the GFAP\n+\nborder to obtain the lesion area bounded by GFAP. Total lesion volume was calculated with the following equation:\nTotal\u00a0lesion\u00a0volume\n=\n[\naverage\u00a0area\u00a0of\u00a0lesion\n]\n\u00d7\n[\nsection\u00a0thickness\n]\n\u00d7\n[\nnumber\u00a0of\u00a0sections\u00a0containing\u00a0lesion\n]\n\u00d7\n12\nTo express lesion volume as a percentage of spared gray matter, images of NeuN immunoreactivity were saved as TIFF files and imported into ImageJ software. ROIs were drawn around the boundaries of the gray matter where surviving neurons were visible. The contralateral (left) side of the tissue always appeared fully intact, exhibiting normal NeuN immunoreactivity; therefore, it served as an internal control for each sample. The ipsilateral (right) side of the tissue was outlined in the same fashion, and percent neuronal sparing was calculated using the following equation:\nPercent\u00a0gray\u00a0matter\u00a0sparing\n=\n100\n\u2212\n100\n\u00d7\n[\n(\nleft\u00a0area\n\u2212\nright\u00a0area\n)\n/\nleft\u00a0area\n]\n2.9.3. Quantification of CGRP\n+\naxon density\nImages of CGRP immunoreactivity were saved as TIFF files and imported into ImageJ software. ROIs were drawn around left and right dorsal horns (laminae I-IV). Images were thresholded using the auto local threshold function with the Phansalkar method (\nPhansalkar et al., 2011\n). The total number of above-threshold pixels was calculated for each ROI. For quantification of CGRP\n+\nfiber density in the deep dorsal horn, the width of the PKC\u03b3-immunoreactive band in the dorsal horn was first measured. Then, a rectangular ROI in the deep dorsal horn was drawn with side lengths 2\u00d7 and 4\u00d7 the length of the PKC\u03b3 width, according to previous approaches (\nNees et al., 2016\n). Note that CGRP immunolabeling did not work well in a subset of animals due to poor tissue quality, so these samples were excluded from analysis.\n\n2.10. Statistical analysis\nGraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc.; La Jolla, CA) was used to perform statistical analysis. All data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical significance was defined as\np\n< 0.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Surgical procedures and locomotor function assessment\nAll animals were housed and maintained in accordance with NIH guidelines. Animal use was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Miami. LysM-Cre mice (The Jackson Laboratory; 004781) were bred to Rosa26-tdTomato reporter mice (Arenkiel et al., 2011) to generate LysM-tdTom mice in which LysM-Cre is hemizygous and tdTomato is homozygous (LysM-tdTom\nfl/fl\n). Macrophage-specific\nBrd4\nKO animals, LysM-tdTom\nfl/fl\n-\nBrd4\nfl/fl\n, were then generated to be hemizygous for LysM-Cre and homozygous for\nBrd4\nfl/fl\n, as described elsewhere (\nAhsan et al., 2002\n). Control animals were animals carrying a wild-type\nBrd4\nallele (\nBrd4\n+/+\n). The wild-type and targeted alleles were identified by PCR-based genotyping. All mice were in the C57BL/6 genetic background.\nFemale mice (8\u201310 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (15 mg/kg) until completely anesthetized. A midthoracic laminectomy was performed, the spinal column was stabilized using spinal clamps and positioned on an Infinite Horizon Impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation) (\nScheff et al., 2003\n). The mice were subjected to a moderate contusion (65 kdyne) and the muscles were then sutured back into place and the skin closed with surgical clips. All mice received fluid supplements (lactated Ringer\u2019s solution, 1 mL), antibiotics (gentamycin, 5 mg/kg), and analgesics (buprenorphine, 0.05 mg/kg) subcutaneously following surgery. Twice daily bladder expressions continued for the duration of the studies.\nFemale Fischer rats (160\u2013180 g, Envigo) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg). The back of the animal was shaved and aseptically prepared with chlorhexidine solution (Nolvasan) before surgery. A dorsal laminectomy was performed at thoracic vertebra T8, exposing the surface of the spinal cord. After clamping the spinal column, a moderate contusion injury was generated using the Infinite Horizon Impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation) set at a force of 200 kdyne. Average force and displacement values for each mouse and rat study are listed in\nSupplemental Table 1\n. The muscles and skin were sutured and closed with clips, respectively. Post-operative treatment during the first week included subcutaneous administration of: 5 mL of lactated Ringer\u2019s twice daily, gentamicin (5 mg/kg) once daily, buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) twice daily for 3 days. Bladders were emptied manually twice a day until bladder function returned.\nExperimenters were blinded to the treatment and animals were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control groups. Vehicle and IBET solutions were prepared fresh and administered intraperitoneally 3 h and 18 h post-injury and once daily for 3 days (unless otherwise noted). Vehicle solution was 5% DMSO, 5% Tween-80, in sterile saline. PBS-liposomes, DiI-liposomes and IBET-liposomes were administered at 50 mg/kg (Encapsula Nanosciences) at 1, 3, 6, 11 and 18 days after SCI (\nZhu et al., 2015\n).\nLocomotor recovery was assessed by two examiners using the Basso Mouse Scale open field test for mice (\nBasso et al., 2006\n), or the Basso, Beattie and Breshnahan (BBB) scale for rats (\nBasso et al., 1995\n). Animals were scored at day 1 post-SCI and weekly thereafter. Scores for left and right hindlimbs were averaged for each animal at each time point. Experimenters remained blinded to the genotype or the treatment group throughout the experiment.\n\n2.2. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)\nBone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) or the SCI sites were collected and then RNA was isolated using TRIzol-chloroform extraction, precipitated with ethanol, and purified with the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). RNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop 1000 (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) and converted to cDNA using the iScript\n\u2122\ncDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad, USA). Transcript levels were assessed by RT-qPCR using SYBR Green Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) in a QuantStudio 5 PCR System machine (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). Primers were designed to span introns and generated using the Primer-BLAST online tool (\nTable 1\n). Cycle threshold (CT) values for each gene were normalized to that of\nGapdh\nand converted to \u0394\u0394CT using the following equation: \u0394\u0394CT = log\n2\n(\u2212(CTGene \u2212 CTGapdh)).\nTable 1.\nPrimers used for quantitative RT-PCR.\nPrimers used in qRT-PCR\nSpecies: Mouse\nIl1\u03b2\nF:\nCTTCAAATCTCACAGCAGCAGCACATC\nR:\nCCACGGGAAAGACACAGGTAG\nGapdh\nF:\nTGGCCTTCCGTGTTCCTAC\nR:\nGAGTTGCTGTTGAAGTCG\nSpecies: Rat\nTnf\nF:\nACTGAACTTCGGGGTGATCG\nR:\nTGGTGGTTTGCTACGACGTG\nIl1\u03b2\nF:\nCAGCTTTCGACAGTGAGGAGA\nR:\nTTGTCGAGATGCTGCTGTGA\nIl6\nF:\nTTTCTCTCCGCAAGAGACTTCC\nR:\nTGTGGGTGGTATCCTCTGTGA\nCcl2\nF:\nGTCTCAGCCAGATGCAGTTAAT\nR:\nTCCAGCCGACTCATTGGGAT\nCcl5\nF:\nCTTTGCCTACCTCTCCCTCG\nR:\nTCCTTCGAGTGACAAAGACGA\nCxcl10\nF:\nCGCATGTTGAGATCATTGCCAC\nR:\nTCTTTGGCTCACCGCTTTCA\nGapdh\nF:\nTATCGGACGCCTGGTTAC\nR:\nCTGTGCCGTTGAACTTGC\nOpen in a new tab\n(F = forward primer, R = reverse primer).

Immunohistochemistry and histological analysis\nAt the end of the experiments, rats were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (12 mg/kg), and mice with avertin solution (250 mg/kg). Animals were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution in PBS and spinal cords were removed, post-fixed for 2 h and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. T7\u2013T9 spinal cord segments centered at the injury site were embedded in OCT compound (ThermoFisher Scientific) and serial sagittal sections cut on a cryostat (16 \u03bcm, mouse tissue; 20 \u03bcm, rat tissue). Sections were blocked in 5% normal donkey serum in PBS-0.3% TritonX-100 for an hour, and then immunostained for CD11b (Invitrogen, 14\u20130112\u201382, 1:200; or BD Biosciences, #550299, 1:100), GFAP (Dako, Z0334, 1:1000; or Abcam, ab4674, 1:500), PDGFR\u03b2 (Abcam, ab32570, 1:200), RFP (Rockland, RL600\u2013401\u2013379, 1:500). After primary antibody incubation overnight at 4\u00b0 C, sections were incubated in Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, 1:500) and then in DAPI solution. Sections were washed, coverslipped using mounting media, and imaged under an Olympus VS120 Virtual Slide Microscope.\n\n2.4. Bone marrow derived macrophage cultures\nMice were anesthetized with avertin solution (250\u2013300 mg/kg) and euthanized by cervical dislocation. We used both male and female animals in cell culture experiments. Femur and tibia were collected from both hindlimbs of donor mice and bone marrow was flushed out with sterile RPMI medium (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). Red blood cells were lysed with ACK lysis buffer chloride (155 mM NH\n4\nCl, 10 mM KHCO\n3\n, 10 mM Na\n2\n-EDTA in water, sterile-filtered) for 3 min at room temperature. Bone marrow cells were then passed through a 70 \u03bcm cell strainer and plated at 1\u20131.2 10\n6\ncells per cm\n2\n. Cultures were maintained in RPMI media, supplemented with 20% L929 conditioned media, 10% FBS, 1% antibiotic/antimicotic and 0.1% 50 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Media was changed every other day, and cells were trypsinized and re-plated in 24-well culture plates (Greiner Bio One, USA) at day 5 for experimentation.\nBrd4\nKO or WT cells were fixed and immunostained for BRD4 (Bethyl, A301\u2013985A100, 1:1000), or stimulated with 10 ng/mL TNF (Sigma, T7539) and 10 ng/mL IL-1\u03b2 (Sigma, I5271) or vehicle control for qPCR analysis (as described above).\n\n2.5. Western blot analysis\nBMDM cells from\nBrd4\nWT or KO mice were homogenized, and extracts prepared using lysis buffer (PhosphoSolutions, USA), and protease inhibitor cocktail (Cell Signaling, USA). Samples were sonicated and the soluble fraction was recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 \u00d7\ng\nfor 10min at 4 \u00b0C. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce\n\u2122\nBCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) and 15\u03bcg of protein from each sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The bands were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, washed and blocked in 5% BSA in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-BRD4 (1:1000, A301\u2013985A50, Bethyl Laboratories Inc.), and rabbit anti-\u03b2-tubulin (1:5000, T2200, Sigma). The next day, membranes were washed and incubated in anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked (1:10,000, 7074, Cell Signaling) secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, membranes were incubated in Supersignal West Pico (Thermo Scientific, USA) chemiluminescence solution for 5 min and then imaged in a chemiluminescent imaging system (Azure 300, Azure Biosystems, USA).\n\n2.6. Statistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Version 7.04 and in all analyses\np\n< 0.05 was used. In\nFigs. 1\n, and\n3C\none-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison testing was used to determine the significance of differences between treatment doses (\nFig. 1\n) or genetic\nBrd4\ndeletion (\nFig. 3C\n) in gene expression levels. A Student\u2019s\nt\n-test was used to compare the significance of differences between vehicle and IBET-treated groups (\nFig. 2C\n-\nE\n,\n4C\n), or genetic\nBrd4\ndeletion (\nFig. 3A\n,\nE\n) in histological outcome measures. The significance of differences in longitudinal behavior studies (\nFigs. 2B\n,\n3F\n, and\n4F\n) was assessed using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni\u2019s post-test. Animals were randomly placed into experimental groups, and investigators were blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nPharmacological BET inhibition reduces proinflammatory cytokines after rat contusive SCI.

    "Methods": "Experimental animals\nA total of 27 adult (12 weeks) male Sprague-Dawley rats (280\u2013300g) obtained from Envigo (Hsd:Sprague Dawley\u00ae SD, Indianapolis, IN) were randomly assigned to a control, uninjured group or to C2SH surgery and followed for 3 or 21 days afterwards (3DSH and 21DSH, respectively). All procedures were conducted in accordance with the American Physiological Society\u2019s Animal Care Guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Mayo Clinic. Animals were housed individually in cages under a 12-h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection for all experimental procedures.\n\nPhrenic motor neuron labeling\nLabelling of the PhMN pool was achieved by injecting two 10 \u00b5l injections of 0.2% Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B solution (CTB-488) (\nC22841\n, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) bilaterally into the intrapleural space as previously described (\nMantilla et al., 2013a\n;\nMantilla et al., 2009\n;\nRana et al., 2019\n;\nRana et al., 2017\n). Briefly, the awake animal was lightly restrained and a 20-gauge Hamilton syringe (7731\u201310, Hamilton Company, Reno, NV) was used to inject CTB-488 between the 7th and 8th ribs. CTB-488 was delivered 5 days prior to the terminal time experiment to allow ample time for labelling of the PhMN pool.\n\nAssessment of diaphragm muscle activity\nChronic diaphragm muscle EMG activity was assessed in C2SH animals using a pair of electrodes that were threaded into the mid-costal region of the diaphragm bilaterally, as previously described (\nGransee et al., 2013\n;\nMantilla et al., 2013a\n;\nMantilla et al., 2011\n;\nRana et al., 2017\n). Briefly, a midline laparotomy was performed to expose the inferior surface of the diaphragm and a pair of electrodes made from insulated stainless steel fine wire (AS631, Cooner Wire Inc., Chatsworth, CA) with a ~3 mm exposed region was placed into each hemi-diaphragm muscle with an inter-electrode distance of ~3 mm. The electrode pair was secured in place using a surgical knot at the muscle surface, looped intra-abdominally, tunneled sub-cutaneously, externalized and secured in the dorsum of the animal. Animals were allowed to recover prior to C2SH surgery for at least 3 days in order to avoid possible laparotomy-induced inhibition of neural activity of the diaphragm, which peaks \u223c6\u20138 h after laparotomy and returns to baseline by ~48 h (\nDureuil et al., 1986\n;\nFord et al., 1983\n).\nBaseline diaphragm EMG activity was recorded at 1 day prior to injury to evaluate technical success in EMG placement, and at 3 days postoperatively to confirm absence of EMG after C2SH. For every session, the EMG signal for each pair of diaphragm muscle electrodes was differentially amplified (gain: 2000x) and band-pass filtered (20\u20131000Hz) using an analog amplifier (Model 2124, DATA Inc.). The signal was digitized using a data acquisition board (National Instruments, Austin, TX) with sampling frequency of 2000 Hz and recorded using a custom-made program (LabView 8.2, National Instrument). The root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the EMG signal was calculated over a 50-ms window. Peak RMS (RMS\npeak\n) was determined from the EMG signal.\nDiaphragm EMG activity was recorded during eupneic breathing (~2 min). RMS\npeak\nEMG amplitude was averaged during the entire 120 s exposure for eupnea. Spontaneous sighs were identified during the eupneic recording period with their characteristic dual-phasic burst, large amplitude and post-sigh apneic period.\n\nSpinal Hemisection\nDetails of the C2SH surgical procedure have been previously published (\nGransee et al., 2015\n;\nMantilla et al., 2007\n;\nMantilla et al., 2018\n;\nMiyata et al., 1995\n;\nPrakash et al., 1999\n). Under sterile conditions, a bilateral dorsal C2 laminectomy was performed, and the right half of the spinal cord was sectioned lateral to the dorsal fissure, thus transecting only the ventral and lateral funiculi, while preserving the dorsal funiculus on the side of C2SH. In order to verify completeness of C2SH, absence of ipsilateral diaphragm EMG activity was confirmed under anesthesia at the time of surgery and 3 days post-C2SH (3DSH). Previous studies by our group have evaluated the extent of histological damage following unilateral C2SH (\nMantilla et al., 2014a\n;\nMiyata et al., 1995\n;\nSieck and Mantilla, 2009\n). The C2SH injury consistently results in damage to the ventral and lateral columns at C2 resulting in absence of ipsilateral diaphragm EMG activity at C2SH 3D during eupneic breathing. Thus, a functional outcome was used to verify completeness of C2SH in the present study.\n\nRNAscope in situ Hybridization\nAt the terminal experiment, animals were anesthetized and euthanized by exsanguination. The cervical spinal cord was promptly excised and placed in freezing isopentane and stored at \u221280\u00baC until sectioning. Subsequently, coronal (10 \u00b5m thick) sections were placed on slides (SuperFrost) and stored at \u221280\u00baC until further processing. The phrenic motor pool is usually found in ~20 of these coronal sections and 3\u20134 sections were stereologically selected (~100 \u00b5m apart) to sample ~50 PhMN containing the midnuclear portion of the motor neuron soma, per animal on each side. Additional sections were sampled as needed to achieve the desired number of PhMNs.\nIn situ\ndetection of AMPA and NMDA mRNA targets was performed using RNAscope\u00ae assay as previously described (\nRana et al., 2019\n). Briefly, probe-Rn-Gria2-O2 (Cat# 508371, Accession No:\nAF164344.1\nAdvanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA, USA) was used to label Gria2 mRNA encoding the GluR2 subunit of AMPA receptors. Probe-Rn-Grin1-C3 (Cat# 317021-C3, Accession No:\nNM_001270602\nAdvanced Cell Diagnostics) was used to label Grin1 mRNA encoding the obligatory NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors. The Gria2 and Grin1 subunits have previously been verified as being highly expressed in rat PhMNs (\nMantilla et al., 2012\n;\nRana et al., 2019\n,\nGransee, 2017\n#14986). The manual multiplex fluorescent assay was performed using the Fluorescent Multiplex Reagent Kit (Cat# 320850, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) and manufacturer recommended protocol for fresh frozen samples, with some modifications as previously described (\nRana et al., 2019\n). Importantly, probe conjugation with fluorescent targets was performed using the Amp-4 AltB combination, thus labeling Gria2 and Grin1 with Atto 550 and Atto647, respectively. Tissue was counterstained with DAPI and cover-slipped with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Cat#\nP36934\n, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Slides were stored at 4\u00baC till imaged. Imaging was conducted within one week of hybridization to avoid degradation of fluorescent signal.\n\nConfocal Imaging and Analysis\nSpinal cord sections were imaged using a confocal microscope (Nikon Eclipse A1R, Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY) equipped with A1 detection filters 450/50, 535/50,600/50 + 685/70 and interlock with four diode lasers (405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 640 nm). A 40x Plan Fluor objective (NA 1.30) was used to obtain all images (12-bit, 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel array) with a 0.5 \u03bcm step size. Imaging parameters were selected by setting background as less than 10% of the dynamic range and preventing saturation of mRNA transcripts.\nRetrogradely-labelled PhMNs with a distinct mid nuclear section with a visible nucleolus were selected for analyses of mRNA transcript. Quantitative analysis of mRNA transcripts in individually identified PhMN cell bodies was performed on the FIJI platform (ver. 2.0.0, RRID:SCR_002285, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD) using previously described method (\nRana et al., 2020a\n). Briefly, maximum intensity projection images were obtained from the confocal z-stack. Integrated intensities and area of 20 discrete individual mRNA transcripts were measured, along with average background intensity per pixel. These values were used to obtain total number of transcripts in the region of interest as outlined by CTB labelled PhMN soma and superimposed on channels containing AMPA and NMDA mRNA transcript signal.\nAdditional morphometric analyses were performed for each PhMN, as previously described (\nFogarty et al., 2018\n;\nIssa et al., 2010\n;\nMantilla et al., 2018\n;\nPrakash et al., 2000\n;\nPrakash et al., 1993\n,\n1994\n;\nRana et al., 2019\n). Somal surface areas and volume of motor neuron somata were estimated for a prolate spheroid by measuring the major and minor axes in the midnuclear section. Estimated mRNA transcripts density was obtained by normalizing total number of mRNA transcripts per probe to normalized to optical slice volume for the mid-nuclear motor neuron section. This assumes a comparable density of mRNA across the motor neuron. Experimenter was blinded to experimental group for all analyses. Images were converted to 8-bit in NIS Elements for presentation only. No thresholding or post-imaging processing was applied for any images used in analysis.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll statistical evaluations were performed using JMP statistical software (version 14.0, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The study statistical design was powered to consider the across subject and within subject variance in order to detect a 15% difference at p<0.05. Accordingly, we included 6 animals per experimental group and sampled ~50 PhMNs per animal per side using a stereological approach. For measurements repeated for the same animal (e.g., mRNA transcript density and total number of mRNA transcripts per PhMN), PhMN somal surface area, experimental group and side were included as model variables. An additional model was generated after grouping PhMNs into tertiles according size for each animal. PhMN size generally reflects motor unit type and thus would be recruited differentially to accomplish the various motor behaviors by the diaphragm muscle (\nFournier and Sieck, 1988\n;\nMantilla et al., 2010\n;\nMantilla and Sieck, 2011\n;\nSeven et al., 2014\n;\nSieck, 1988\n;\nSieck, 1994\n;\nSieck et al., 2013\n;\nSieck and Fournier, 1989\n). Accordingly, PhMNs in the lower tertile would be recruited first to accomplish lower force ventilatory behaviors, followed by PhMNs in the middle tertile to accomplish higher force ventilatory behaviors such as sighing or breathing against an occluded airway. Finally, PhMNs in the upper tertile would be recruited last to accomplish higher force non-ventilatory behaviors such as sneezing or other expulsive behaviors. Normality of the distribution was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test within each animal. Outliers were identified for each animal using an outlier box plot. No data was excluded from the analysis.\nUsing the mixed linear model, statistical significance was established at the 0.05 level and adjusted for any violation of the assumption of sphericity in repeated measures using the Greenhouse-Geisser correction. When appropriate,\npost hoc\nanalyses were conducted using Tukey-Kramer honestly significant difference (HSD)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThe generation and genotyping of mice lacking full-length Bai1 were previously described (\nZhu et al., 2015\n). These mice were engineered with a deletion of exon 2 (where the ATG start codon is located) and fail to express full length Bai1. Heterozygous mutants (\nAdgrb1\n+/\u2212\n) on a C57BL/6J (000664, Jackson laboratory) background were bred to generate wildtype (WT), heterozygous (\nAdgrb1\n+/\u2212\n), and homozygous (\nAdgrb1\n\u2212/\u2212\n) offspring. Mice were housed in groups of 3\u20135 on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with standard laboratory rodent chow (5001, Lab Diet) and water available\nad libitum\n. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines.\n\nSurvival and body growth curve analysis\nMale and female\nAdgrb1\n\u2212/\u2212\n,\nAdgrb1\n+/\u2212\nand WT littermates were weighed once every two days from postnatal day 7 to 24 (P7 \u2013 P24) and then once a week until P65 (n=9\u201315/group).\n\nBrain weight assessment\nMale and female mice of all genotypes at three different ages (P1, 3 week, 2\u20133 month) were weighed and anesthetized with isoflurane. Brains were harvested and immediately weighed (n=8\u201318/group).\n\nImmunofluorescence staining and imaging\nBrains were postfixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C and then transferred to 30% sucrose solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Coronal sections (40 \u03bcm) were stained using with antibodies against GFAP (1:400, 13\u20130300, Thermo Fischer Scientific), IBA1 (1:400,\nAb178846\n, Abcam), NeuN (1:1000, MAB377, Millipore), and cleaved-caspase-3 (CC3) (1:200, 9664, Cell signaling Technology). Goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, ab150114, Abcam) and goat anti-Rat IgG (1:500, A-21434, Thermo Fischer) were used as the secondary antibodies for NeuN and GFAP, respectively. Goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, ab150077, Abcam) was used as the secondary antibody for IBA1 and CC3. Slides were washed multiple times with PBS and incubated with appropriate fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. For NeuN, GFAP, and IBA1 staining, confocal images were acquired on an Olympus FV1000 inverted microscope using the Olympus Fluoview v4.2 software. For CC3 staining, an upright microscope (DM6000B Leica) was used. Three sections per mouse containing the hippocampus and primary somatosensory cortex (bregma\u22121.96 mm) were used for immunofluorescence staining. NeuN positive cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 were counted per mm\n2\n. CC3 positive (CC3+) cells were counted in the DG, CA1, and primary somatosensory cortex. GFAP and IBA1 immunoreactivity (IR) was calculated as the percentage area of the total region of interest (ROI) of the DG and CA1 using ImageJ. A threshold for IR was determined across all antibody images as previously described (\nChalermpalanupap et al., 2018\n). The IR area within the ROI and the total area of the ROI were calculated using the \u201cMeasure\u201d feature of ImageJ, and the percentage area of IR was determined (area of IR within ROI divided by the total area of ROI and multiplied by 100). Two sections per mouse containing the rostral hippocampus were used for P1 mice. Similarly, CC3+ cells were counted in the DG, CA1, and primary somatosensory cortex. The experimenter was blinded to genotype during quantification.\n\nWestern Blot\nWhole brain was dissected from 5 month old WT,\nAdgrb1\n+/\u2212\n, and, Adgrb\n1\n\u2212/\u2212\nlittermates, and the left hemisphere was used for western blot. Tissue extracts were prepared in RIPA buffer (89901, Thermo) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor mix (1861280, Thermo), and total protein was quantified using the BCA protein assay. Laemmli sample buffer (1610747, BIORAD) was added after the BCA protein assay. Protein samples (75 \u03bcg) were loaded without boiling on a 10 % SDS-PAGE gel, resolved at 100 V/cm for 2.5 hours, and transferred to a PVDF membrane (1620177, BIORAD). Membranes were blocked with 5 % milk and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with an anti C-terminal BAI1 antibody (1:1000, AP8170a, Abcepta; epitope: amino acids 1537\u20131567), followed by an anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000; 31460, Thermo Fischer). The intensity of the Bai1 band was quantified using ImageJ (NIH) as previously described (\nZhu et al., 2018\n) (n=3/genotype).\n\nBehavioral analysis\nBehavioral analysis was performed on 3\u20135 month old male\nAdgrb1\n\u2212/\u2212\n,\nAdgrb1\n+/\u2212\n, and WT littermates. All behavioral assessments were videotaped and scored using the ANY-Maze Video Tracking System (Stoelting Co.) by an experimenter blinded to genotype. Behavioral analyses were conducted one week apart in the following order: open field, novel object recognition, novel cage, and three-chamber social interaction.\n\nOpen field and novel object recognition\nNovel object recognition was performed over 4 days as previously described (\nDutton et al., 2017\n;\nSawyer et al., 2016\n;\nWong et al., 2021a\n;\nWong et al., 2018\n). The apparatus consisted of an arena with opaque Plexiglas walls (60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm). The center zone was a 30 cm x 30 cm area in the center of the chamber. On day 1, each mouse was placed in the empty arena and allowed to explore for 10 min. Locomotor activity, total distance traveled, average speed, and time spent in the center zone were scored. On days 2 and 3, two identical objects (cube or sphere) were placed in the center of the arena, and each mouse explored the arena for 10 min (n=13/genotype). On day 4, one of the objects was replaced with a novel object (cube was replaced with the sphere or vice versa). The objects and the location of the novel versus familiar object were counterbalanced. The time spent exploring each object was used to calculate a discrimination ratio (time exploring the novel object/ (time exploring the novel object + time exploring the familiar object) (n=7\u20138/genotype).\n\nThree-chamber social interaction\nSociability and social discrimination were examined using the three-chamber social interaction paradigm (\nDutton et al., 2017\n;\nSawyer et al., 2016\n;\nWong et al., 2021b\n). A partition separated each chamber (20 cm x 40 cm x 20 cm) with an opening to allow the mouse to move freely between them. The experiment consisted of three 10-minute sessions. The test mouse was first placed in the center chamber, with an empty cylindrical wire cage in the left and right chambers, and the mouse was allowed to freely explore for 10 minutes. In the second 10-minute session, an age- and sex-matched C57BL/6J mouse (stranger) was placed under one of the wire cages while the wire cage on the opposite side remained empty (object). The test mouse was again placed in the center chamber and allowed to explore freely. Time interacting with the \u2018stranger\u2019 mouse vs. the empty cage was calculated as a measure of \u2018sociability\u2019. For the third 10-minute session, a second age- and sex-matched C57BL/6J mouse (novel mouse) was placed under the previously empty wire cage. The test mouse was again placed in the center chamber and allowed to explore freely. Time interacting with either the first (now \u2018familiar\u2019) mouse from the second session or the novel mouse introduced in the third session was calculated as a measure of \u2018social discrimination\u2019 (n=7\u20138/genotype).\n\nNovel cage\nEach mouse was placed into a novel standard mouse cage (33 cm \u00d7 18 cm\u00d7 15 cm) and observed for stereotyped behaviors for 10 minutes. The time spent grooming, digging, rearing, and circling was recorded (n=13/genotype).\n\nNestlet shredding\nNesting behavior was performed as previously described (\nLustberg et al., 2020\n). Each mouse was placed into a novel standard mouse cage with a cotton nestlet square (5 cm \u00d7 5 cm, approximately 3 g). Nestlets were weighted before the experiment to calculate the percent shredded at the end of the task. Mice were left undisturbed between 1 pm and 3 pm, after which they were returned to their home cages. The weight of the remaining non-shredded nestlet material was recorded (n=13/genotype).\n\nBuried food Test\nOlfactory function was examined using the buried food test as previously described (\nYang and Crawley, 2009\n). Two days prior to assessment of olfactory function, chocolate-flavored pellets (\nF05472\n\u20131, Bio-Serv) were introduced into the home cage to habituate animals to the novel but highly palatable stimulus. Twenty-four hours prior to behavioral testing, all standard mouse chow and chocolate pellets were removed from the home cage. Mice were tested in the same room in which they were housed. On test day, chocolate pellets were placed in a randomly-selected corner of a clean mouse cage and buried under 3 cm of standard bedding. The latency for the mouse to find and eat (grasp and bite) the chocolate pellets was recorded. Mice that did not feed within 15 min were assigned a maximum feeding latency score of 900 s (n=13/genotype).\n\nSeizure induction\nSusceptibility to induced seizures was tested in 3\u20135monthold male and female\nAdgrb1\n\u2212/\u2212\n,\nAdgrb1\n+/\u2212\n, and WT littermates.\n\n6 Hz induced seizures\n6 Hz psychomotor seizures were induced as previously described (\nGiddens et al., 2017\n;\nShapiro et al., 2021\n;\nWong et al., 2016\n;\nWong et al., 2021b\n). Mice were given a topical analgesic to the cornea (0.5% tetracaine hydrochloride) before stimulation. Corneal electrical stimulation (6 Hz, 3 sec, 17 mA for male and 13 mA for female) was applied through a constant current device (ECT Unit 57800; Ugo Basile), and the mouse was moved immediately into a clean cage for behavioral seizure observation. Resulting seizures were scored on a modified Racine scale: RS0 = no abnormal behavior; RS1 = immobile \u2265 3 sec, RS2 = forelimb clonus, paw waving, RS3 = rearing and falling (n=9\u201311/group).\n\nFlurothyl induced seizures\nSeizure induction using flurothyl was performed as previously described (\nMartin et al., 2007\n;\nShapiro et al., 2021\n;\nShapiro et al., 2019\n;\nWong et al., 2021a\n). Each mouse was placed in a plexiglass chamber (34 cm x 20 cm x 15 cm and exposed to flurothyl (bis[2,2,2-trifluoroethyl] ether, 287571\u20135G, Sigma-Aldrich) at a rate of 20 \u03bcL/min. Latencies to the first myoclonic jerk (MJ) and generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) were recorded (n=8\u201311/group).\n\nStatistical analysis\nPrism v8.1.2 software (GraphPad) was used for statistical analyses. A 2-way ANOVA followed by Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test was used to compare the bodyweight of each genotype at the different time points of the growth curve, the time spent interacting with the stranger mouse and novel mouse, total entries into each side chamber during the three-chamber social interaction task, and brain/body weight measurements. For novel object recognition, a one-sample parametric t-test was used to compare the time spent with the novel object against 50% chance. A 1-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test was used to analyze the total distance traveled, speed, total time spent in the center of the open field, the latency to the MJ and GTCS during flurothyl seizure induction, the amount of nestlet shredded, the latency to grasp and bite the chocolate pellets in the buried food test, latencies to the first interactions in the three-chamber social interaction task, and immunofluorescence data. For the 6 Hz seizure induction paradigm, an unpaired nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare Racine scores between each genotype. Male and female mice were analyzed separately unless stated. All results are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and a p-value <0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "2.1. Experimental animals\n2.1.1. Animal use and care\nAll procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and use Committee (IACUC) of the University of California Irvine in compliance with the National Institute of Health guidelines. All animals were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle at 25 \u00b0C. All procedures were done during the light portion of the cycle.\n2.1.2. Mice\nOur initial studies using rAAV-retro were done using two lines of transgenic mice that we developed in our lab (\nGallent and Steward, 2018\n). One line was created by crossing Rosa26\ntdTomato\nmice obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (JAX: 007905) with PTEN\nf/f\nmice from our breeding colony to create a new transgenic strain that was homozygous at both loci (Rosa\ntdTomato\n/PTEN\nf/f)\n). Rosa\ntdTomato\n/PTEN\nf/f\nmice have a lox-P flanked STOP cassette in the ROSA locus and lox-P flanked exon 5 of PTEN so AAV-mediated expression of Cre recombinase deletes PTEN and induces robust expression of tdTomato (tdT) in the same neurons. In creating this new transgenic strain, we also selected for mice that were homozygous at the tdT locus as controls. Because the resulting Rosa\ntdTomato\nmice were derived from the crossing, they have a different genetic background from the original, Rosa\ntdTomato\nmice obtained from JAX Labs (genetic background B6;129S6). After achieving homozygosity, the two lines were propagated in our breeding colony. Details on animal use (genotypes, ages at the time of injection, injection location, survival time, and whether mice were used in previous published studies) are in\nTable 1\n.

Retrograde transduction of cortical motoneurons with retro-AAVs\nTo label cortical motoneurons in a way that allows visualization of dendritic arbors and produce labeling that is optimal for light sheet microscopy, we used rAAV2-retro/Cre (Addgene viral prep #24593-AAVrg) in transgenic Rosa\ntdTomato\nand PTEN\nloxP/loxP\n/Rosa\ntdTomato\nmice [as in (\nSteward et al., 2021b\n)].\nProcedures involving mice rAAV-retro injections at cervical level 5 (C5) and lumbar spinal level 2 (L2), have been previously described (\nSteward et al., 2021b\n). Injections at thoracic level 9 (T9) followed the same procedures. Briefly, animals were anesthetized with Isoflurane (2\u20133%), their eyes were swabbed with Vaseline, and the skin at the incision site was shaved and cleaned with Betadine. A laminectomy was performed at the appropriate vertebral level to expose the underlying spinal cord. Bilateral rAAV-retro injections (3E9 genome copies in 0.3 \u03bcl per side) were made using a Hamilton microsyringe fitted with a pulled glass micropipette at 0.5 mm lateral to the midline and 0.5 mm deep.\nFor studies in rats, we re-engineered the rAAV2-retro by packaging the same shRNA PTEN sequence used in our previous study (\nLewandowski and Steward, 2014\n) driven by the human U6 promoter and GFP driven by a CMV promoter. The vector (rAAV-retro-shPTEN/GFP) was prepared as a custom AAV design by the University of Pennsylvania Vector Core. Injections were at cervical level 5 (C5), rats were anesthetized with Isoflurane (2\u20133%), their eyes were swabbed with Vaseline, and the skin at the incision site was shaved and cleaned with Betadine. A laminectomy was performed at the appropriate vertebral level to expose the underlying spinal cord. Bilateral rAAV-retro injections (3E9 genome copies in 0.3 \u03bcl per side) were made using a Hamilton microsyringe fitted with a pulled glass micropipette at 0.5 mm lateral to the midline and 0.5 mm deep.\n\n2.3. DRG processing and imaging\nTo assess retrograde labeling of DRG neurons, we used a Keyence microscope to obtain low magnification views of intact spinal cords with attached DRGs from PTEN\nf/f\n;Rosa\ntdTomato\nmice that received rAAV-retro injections at C5. Stacks of images of intact spinal cords and dorsal root ganglia were collected, collapsed into a projection, and then subjected to the \u201chaze reduction\u201d function in Keyence software. In these processed images, cell bodies of tdT-positive neurons were readily visible. Then, these spinal cords with attached ganglia were sectioned and prepared for immunostaining.\n\n2.4. Intersectional genetic approach to selectively express DREADD in cortical motoneurons\nRosa\ntdTomato\nmice, which express tdTomato upon Cre expression, received intra-spinal injections of rAAV-retro/Cre at cervical level 5 as above and unilateral intra-cortical injections of AAV carrying Cre-dependent hM3Dq (AAV8-hSyn-DIO-HA-hM3D(Gq)-IRES-mCitrine, Addgene Cat. No. 50454). With this approach, hM3DGq is expressed only by the layer V cortical motoneurons in the area of the intra-cortical injection that are transduced with rAAV-retro/Cre. As a test of concept, we determined whether delivery of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) would lead to activation of immediate early gene (IEG) expression in cortical motoneurons. Three weeks after intra-cortical AAV8- hM3Dq injections, mice received clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) (5 mg/kg) and were perfused 1 h later. Brains were prepared for IHC for HA to reveal neurons expressing hM3Dq and for c-fos as a representative IEG.\n\n2.5. Post-operative care\nFollowing the surgeries, animals were immediately placed on water-circulating jacketed heating pads at 37 \u00b0C. After recovering from the anesthetic, animals were housed 2\u20134 per cage on Alpha-Dri bedding. For 3\u20135 days post-injury, mice and rats received Lactated ringers solution (1ml/20g) with enrofloxacin (2.5 mg/kg) sub-cutaneously for prophylactic treatment against urinary tract infections. Animals were monitored twice daily for general health, coat quality (indicative of normal grooming activity) and mobility within the cage.\n\n2.6. Tissue preparation\nAnimals were transcardially perfused at different time-points post-injection (see\nTable 1\n) with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (4% PFA). Brains and spinal cords were dissected, post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight, then immersed in 27% sucrose for cryoprotection overnight, frozen in TissueTek OCT (VWR International) and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until they were sectioned with a cryostat.\n\n2.7. Immunostaining to assess AAV transduction\nAAV transduction was assessed by the expression of tdTomato (mice) and GFP (rats). Successful expression of the cargo was determined by assessing PTEN deletion in the motor cortex by immunostaining. Methods for mice were previously described (\nSteward et al., 2021b\n). Briefly, brain blocks were sectioned by cryostat and free-floating sections were collected. One set of the sections was mounted in serial order for visualization of native tdT fluorescence and other sections were immunostained for tdT (rabbit anti-red fluorescent protein, Rockland Immunochemicals Inc., #600\u2013401\u2013379, RRID:AB_2209751) or PTEN (rabbit anti-PTEN Cell Signaling Technology #9188 L, RRID: AB_2253290). For rats, immunostaining was done on free-floating sections at selected intervals. Sections were mounted in serial order and immunostained for GFP (1:1000 dilution, rabbit anti-GFP, Thermo-Fisher Invitrogen #A-11122, RRID:AB_221569) or for PTEN (1:250 dilution, rabbit anti-PTEN, Cell Signaling Technology #9188 L, RRID: AB_2253290). Biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:250 dilution and stained with tyramide-FITC (for GFP) or tyramide-Cy3 (for PTEN).\nFor intersectional genetics, successful expression of AAV-hM3Dq was determined by HA citrine immunostaining [1:1000 dilution, rabbit anti-HA, Cell Signaling #3724, RRID:AB_1549585; secondary antibody: Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen #A32790, RRID_2762833)] and colocalization with native tdT-positive neurons in the same section. Activation of hM3Dq via CNO administration was determined by immunostaining for c-fos (1:1000 dilution, anti-rabbit anti c-fos, Millipore, #ABE457, RRID:AB_2631318; biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:250 dilution and stained with tyramide-FITC) and colocalization with native tdT-positive neurons in the same section.\n\n2.8. Tissue clearing and light sheet fluorescence microscopy\nBrains were immunostained and made optically transparent using a modified iDISCO + whole mount staining protocol as previously described (\nSteward et al., 2021b\n). In brief, brains were incubated in 6-ml 1:600 (10 ul) Rabbit anti-RFP (Rockland #600\u2013401\u2013379, RRID: AB_2209751) for 6 days. Secondary antibody amplification was done in 6-ml 1:600 (10 ul) for 6 days with Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen #A10042, RRID:AB_2534017) for C5 and L2 injections, or Alexa Fluor 595 for T9 injections (Invitrogen #A21207, RRID:AB_141637). Cleared brains were imaged on a Z.1 LSFM (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) modified for large, cleared samples in high refractive index solutions (Mesoscale Imaging System; Translucence Biosystems). To construct a rendering of the whole sample, multiple x-y-z-stack scans were stitched together with 20% overlap in Vision4D (Arivis AG) and the completed z-stack of stitched tiles was rendered in Imaris 9.5 (Oxford Instruments) for analysis."

    "Methods": "Machine learning algorithms can \u201clearn\u201d the relationship between data and the target outcome, without having to rely on direct human instructions (Bishop, 2006). For doing so, a model is constructed based upon input data. In the case of what is called supervised learning, the algorithm\u2019s goal is to learn a mapping between the input data and the target variables. To accomplish this task, representative data of the problem at hand is provided to the algorithm. Such data, which is calledtraining data, comprises input\u2013output pairs. The inputs are generally multi-dimensional vectors that representfeaturesof the data, i.e., relevant information characterizing and describing certain brain states or behaviors that are to be decoded. Most commonly, features are first constructed from raw data and sometimes manually optimized throughfeature engineering,before the features deemed most promising or appropriate are selected. The mapping that links features to desired outputs is learned duringtraining. The response variable, also known as the dependent variable, is the output of interest that is associated with these features, i.e. the brain state or behavior itself. The response variable can either be discrete (e.g. absence or presence of symptoms or movement) or continuous (e.g. severity of a symptom or degree of grip force), representing either a classification or a regression problem, respectively (Mitchell et al., 2013). As a first step, an ML model needs to betrained. This is typically done by providing the model atraining setof inputfeaturesand corresponding knowntargetvariables. In the training process the model learns to map inputfeaturesto target variables by optimizing model parameters, typically by minimizing acost function. The cost function estimates thelossorerroras an indicator of modelperformance, e.g. the difference between model output and target variable. Various optimization algorithms can minimize the cost function, but the most prominent isgradient descent, which enables a model to learn thegradient or directionmodel parameters should take to improve modelperformance. Depending on the model complexity, it is susceptible tooverfitting, which describes the attribution of target irrelevantnoisein the training data to model parameters, leading to highperformancein thetrainingdataset but lowgeneralizationfor new or left out data. The risk foroverfittingincreases with higher modelcomplexity, i.e.the bigger the number of model parameters, the higher the risk for the model to assignunrelated or noisy input to these parameters. Therefore, the modelperformancesmust be objectivelyvalidatedon a set of unseen data, called atest set. Such data should never be examined by the algorithm during training and should be as representative of the real setting as possible.\n\nAn objectively good ML modelgeneralizeswell to unseen data (not part of thetraining set), when itsperformancefor left out or newtest setsis as good as for thetraining set. A model is described asoverfittedwhen it performs well on thetraining setbut poorly on new, unseentest sets. To avoid overfitting, several strategies can be adopted, such asfeature selection,data augmentationandregularizationtechniques. To avoid an overestimation of the performance metrics, cautious(cross-) validationroutines must be cleared of anycircularity, which can arise when the same model learns from shuffled consecutive samples that are correlated, e.g., by autocorrelation of the signals, see for example (Lemm et al., 2011). In the following sections, detailed insight into these topics within the framework of invasive brain signal decoding will be provided. Representativetest setsare required to estimate and quantify thegeneralizationcapability, which is evaluated byperformance metricsfor bothclassificationandregressionproblems.\n\nFinally, many models require tweaking thehyperparameters, which are defined as parameters that are not optimized through model training, but can either be set manually, or can be subjected to a so-called hyperparameter grid search (a systematic run through a set of predefined grid of values) or random search (run through a set of randomly defined values). Optimalhyperparametersare often unknown, which makes manual optimization inefficient.Gridandrandom hyperparametersearches, however, are uninformed by past evaluations, meaning that the entiretrainingprocess is repeated for the entire predefined grid, regardless of theperformance metrics. More recently,Bayesian hyperparameter optimizationroutines have evolved, which form a probabilistic model for identifying optimalhyperparametersby learning from previous performance metrics.\n\nIn summary, atraining setcomprisinginput features (e.g.oscillatory gamma band activity)and correspondingtarget variables (e.g.hand grip-force)is used totraina machine learning model, byoptimizingmodelparameters(e.g. linear model coefficients) to minimize the loss or difference of model output (predicted grip-force) andtargetvariable (observed true grip-force). Once the decoding model is built, yielding a pre-defined \u201csatisfactory\u201d prediction performance metric, the learned parameters and model functions can be directly applied to unseen testing data. This training-testing procedure is represented inFig. 2, where raw data is transformed into features, features are selected, and the prediction model is adjusted. The model then is applied to testing data, to make novel predictions or to evaluate performance metrics. In the particular case of deep learning, features will be constructed during model training. In this review, we explore how these specific ML definitions become relevant in the case of real-time decoding for intelligent adaptive DBS based on invasive electrophysiological neural population activity."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nA total of 292 male C57BL/6 J mice (4\u20135 weeks) from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, U.S.A.) were used in these studies. All mice were group housed in a light- and temperature-controlled (12h on/12h off) environment and permitted access to food and water ad libitum before use. After surgery and for the remainder of the experiments, mice were single housed. All efforts were made to minimize the number and suffering of animals used. All experiments were performed in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of Utah\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Principles outlined in the ARRIVE guidelines have been considered when planning experiments.\n\n2.2. IAK mouse model of SE-induced epilepsy\nTypically, 60 mice were surgically prepared per cohort. Buprenorphine was administered at 0.01\u20130.02 mg/kg, s.c., for the treatment of pain 1 h before surgery. All surgical procedures were performed under general gas anesthesia (2\u20135% isoflurane in O2) and stereotaxic guidance. A Dremel drill was used to create three shallow screw holes where stainless steel anchor screws were affixed above the ipsilateral and contralateral frontal cortex and the contralateral somatosensory cortex. An additional hole was drilled over the right hemisphere, and a 22-gauge guide cannula was positioned on top of the dura mater (\nFig. 1A\n: from bregma: AP = \u20121.2 mm; ML = +3.3 mm). For the EEG depth electrode, holes were drilled over the right hemisphere dorsal hippocampus (\nFig. 1A\n: from Bregma: AP = \u20122.3 mm; ML = 2.5 mm) and cerebellum; a Teflon insulated platinum iridium depth electrode (MS333/6-B/SPC, Plastics One Inc. Roanoke, VA, U.S.A.) was then implanted into area CA1 (DV = \u20121.8 mm) and reference electrode over the cerebellum. Guide cannula, EEG electrodes, and a multipin socket were glued in place and a headcap was created with dental acrylic cement. Antibiotic ointment was applied around the incision site, a single dose of penicillin (60,000 units s.c.) was administered, and mice were allowed to recover in their individual home cages for \u22653 days.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nMicroinjection of kainic acid (KA) into the mouse amygdala induces status epilepticus (SE) and the subsequent development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). A) Schematic showing coordinates for injection cannula and CA1 electrode implantation sites. Anatomic reference images courtesy of the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (\nLein et al., 2007\n). B) Gamma-band power resulting from microinjection of KA for mice given midazolam (\nN\n= 9, Blue) or saline (N = 9, Red) 40 min after detection of their first seizure. All mice EEG recordings were aligned to time = 0 when their first seizures were detected and time = 40 min when either 8 mg/kg midazolam or saline was administered. Data are represented by the mean (solid lines) and SEM (shaded area) for the Log10 of gamma frequency power (db). One-minute-long representative EEG traces for a saline-treated (left) and midazolam-treated (right) IAK mouse are shown below. Relative to time zero, traces were captured at 30 min (before saline or midazolam treatment), 2 h (approximate time of largest midazolam effect), and 4 h (after recovery from midazolam). Note the attenuation (at 2 h) and recovery (at 4 h) of large amplitude EEG spikes in the midazolam group. Scale bar represents 2 mV and 10 s. C) Representative EEG seizure recorded from an IAK mouse with an ipsilateral CA1 hippocampal depth electrode during a Racine stage 4\u20135 behavioral seizure. Scale bar represents 2 mV and 10 s. Time points (seconds) above the trace correspond to the expanded traces below (total duration = 2 s; bottom scale bar represents 2 mV and 0.5 s). Similar to EEG waveforms documented in other seizure models (e.g. see (\nWilliams et al., 2009\n)), seizure initiation begins with a large EEG spike (4 s), followed by progressive high amplitude high frequency EEG spikes (12, 20, and 30 s), large amplitude waves containing multiple EEG spikes (40 s), and finally post-ictal depression (50 s).\nWhile the majority of published experiments using variants of this model report injecting 0.3 \u03bcg of KA in a volume of 0.2 \u03bcL directly into the basolateral amygdala (BLA), some experimentation with alternate KA doses has been noted (\nWelzel et al., 2020\n). Also, KA storage conditions and lot-to-lot differences were considered for their contributions to inter-experiment variability. Accordingly, our early pilot experiments assessed the impact of varying doses of Kainic Acid Monohydrate (KA, 0222, Tocris, Minneapolis, MN) on outcomes. These pilot studies were conducted after combining several lots of KA, creating a single stock solution (1.5 mg/mL in 0.9% saline), and freezing aliquots at \u201220 \u2103. Dose was adjusted by increasing or decreasing the volume of the stock solution injected (0.2\u20130.3 \u03bcL). For this particular stock solution of KA, these pilot experiments (data not shown) demonstrated that favorable outcomes (low mortality and high percentages of mice developing SRSs) were achieved after injection of 0.39 \u03bcg in 0.26 \u03bcL saline. Therefore, this dose was chosen for all of the experiments described.\nOn the day of KA injection, a single 1.5 mg/mL KA aliquot was thawed and placed in a glass syringe pump (Pump 11 Elite, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, U.S.A.). In conscious mice under mild restraint, the attached injection cannula (c313I/SPC, Plastics One Inc. Roanoke, VA, U.S.A.) was inserted into the guide cannula and slowly lowered into the BLA at a depth of 3.7 mm below the dura (\nFig. 1A\n). KA (0.39 \u03bcg in 0.26 \u03bcL) was then injected at a rate of 50 nL/s. The injection cannula was left in place for an additional 2 min after KA microinjection to allow diffusion into the brain tissue and minimize movement of KA up the cannula track. Status Epilepticus (SE), as defined by continuous EEG spikes >1 Hz and concomitant stage 3\u20135 seizures, typically began approximately 30 min after KA microinjection (\nFig. 1B\n). In experiments where SE was interrupted with a benzodiazepine, midazolam (8 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 40 min after initiation of SE (\nFig. 1B\n). For the 18 mice used to study SE (\nFig. 1B\n), continuous EEG recordings were made for an additional 12 h. For all other experiments, mice were detached from their tethered EEG cables 40 min after confirmation of SE, given lactated ringers (0.25 mL, i.p.), and allowed to recover for 3 days in their individual home cages where behavioral health (e.g., regular eating, drinking, and grooming) were monitored. This approach was adopted because, in pilot experiments, it was noted that recovery from SE was improved when mice were allowed to freely move about their cages and care for themselves without the hindrances caused by an EEG tether.\n\n2.3. Tissue processing, FluoroJade-B staining, and imaging\nWhole brains were removed and allowed to post-fix in 4% PFA overnight at 4 \u2103 before being rinsed with PBS and transferred to a 30% sucrose solution for overnight cryoprotection. Thirty micrometer thick coronal sections were sliced on a freezing stage microtome and stored at 4 \u2103 in PBS for staining. FluoroJade-B (FJB) staining was performed using 3 hippocampal slices per animal and batch processed. Briefly, sections were mounted on glass slides, dried, and immersed in a descending ethanol series (100% for 3 min, and 90%, 70%, and dIH\n2\nO for 1 min each). Slices were blocked in 0.06% KMnO4 for 30 min, followed by a 2 min rinse in dIH\n2\nO, and then incubated in 0.001% FJB solution for 15 min. Slides were rinsed 5 times with dIH\n2\nO for 1 min each, dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series (70%, 90%, and 100% for 3 min each), and coverslipped with DPX mounting media. Digital images were obtained with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with an AxioCam digital camera system and AxioVision 3.0 software (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Three hippocampal subregions (CA1, CA3, and Hilus, both ipsilateral and contralateral to the KA injection) were scored for positive or negative FJB staining by two independent reviewers who were blinded to treatment group.\n\n2.4. Video-EEG monitoring and assessment of SRSs\nThree days after KA microinjection induced SE, IAK mice were connected to their EEG electrode assembly via a tether to a rotating commutator (8BSL3CX, Plastics One, Inc., Roanoke,VA, U.S.A.), which in-turn was connected to an EEG100C amplifier and digitized by an MP160 Recording system (BioPac Systems Inc., Goleta, CA, U.S.A.). Simultaneously, video was captured by a DVP 7020BE Capture card (Advantech, Milpitas, CA, U.S.A.). Video and EEG data were synchronized and written to disk using our custom software (\nThomson and White, 2014\n). EEG and video data were continuously recorded from mice in this fashion, 24 h per day and 7 days per week, for up to 90 days. EEG and video data were manually analyzed in a blinded and randomized fashion on a daily basis. Seizures were defined as high frequency (>5 Hz) and high amplitude (>2\u00d7 baseline) poly-spike discharges lasting on average 39\u201356 s (\nFig. 4G\n), and seizure termination was defined as a return of amplitude and frequency to baseline values with or without postictal depression (\nMouri et al., 2008\n;\nPitk\u00e4nen et al., 2005\n;\nSapia et al., 2021\n). Behavioral seizures accompanied EEG-identified seizures 99% of the time (\nFig. 4F\n). Behavioral seizures were scored as non-convulsive, focal Racine stage 1\u20133 (facial automatisms or unilateral forelimb clonus) or secondarily generalized Racine stage 4\u20135 (bilateral forelimb clonus, rearing, and/or falling).\nFig. 4.\nOpen in a new tab\nNatural history and characterization of SRSs in this IAK microinjection model of MTLE. A) Percentages of SRS, no SRS, and death for a cohort of 101 IAK mice. B) Survival curve for the 36 mice that died at varying times over the course of the 90-day observation period. Dashed lines highlight 80% survival at 21 days and 65% survival at 90 days. C) Heatmaps depicting the daily number of SRSs experience by each mouse over the 90-day video-EEG observation period. From top to bottom, mice were rank ordered by the total number of SRSs experienced over 90 days from lowest to highest respectively. Note: video EEG was not recorded for the first 3 days after SE. D) Relative frequency distribution of latent periods for all mice in this study. Median latent period was 11 days (Mean latent period was 20 \u00b1 2 days). E) Weekly averages for SRS daily frequencies over the 90-day natural history observation period. Solid bars represent 30 mice whose latent period was < 14 days, and gray bars represent 25 mice whose latent periods were > 14 days. F) Percentages of SRSs that were accompanied by Racine score 4\u20135 behavioral seizures (93%), score 1\u20133 behavioral seizures (6%), or without obvious behaviors (1%). G) Weekly averages for SRS durations over the 90-day observation period. Solid bars represent seizure durations for score 4\u20135 behavioral seizures, and gray bars represent seizure durations for score 1\u20133 behavioral seizures. For panels F and G, a subset of 1484 SRSs were analyzed from a total of 28 mice.\n\n2.5. Treatment with ASDs\nThe five ASDs examined in these experiments were phenytoin (5,5-Diphenylhydantoin sodium salt, Sigma D4505, PHT, 20 mg/kg b.i.d.), carbamazepine (Sigma C8981, CBZ, 30 mg/kg t.i.d.), valproic acid (Valproic acid sodium salt, Sigma P4543, VPA, 240 mg/kg t.i.d.), diazepam (Sigma D0899, DZP, 4 mg/kg b.i.d.), and phenobarbital (Sigma P1636, PB, 25 and 50 mg/kg b.i.d.). All ASDs were administered via intraperitoneal (IP) injection. PHT, VPA, and PB were dissolved in saline (0.9% NaCl). DZP was first dissolved in DMSO and then diluted 1:100 in saline (0.9% NaCl) to make a fine suspension. CBZ was dissolved in 0.5% methylcellulose (Sigma) and formed a fine suspension. Doses were chosen based on efficacy and toxicity results in pilot studies or from previously reported data in rats from established models including the LTG-kindled rat (LTG-R) model and the i.p. KA spontaneously seizing rat model of TLE (\nMetcalf et al., 2019\n;\nThomson et al., 2020\n). In all six experiments, separate cohorts of IAK mice were generated as described. After 3\u20134 weeks, only mice that had experienced at least one SRS were enrolled in these studies. A sub-chronic dosing \u201ccross-over\u201d experimental design was chosen for these experiments (\nThomson et al., 2020\n). Briefly, after a 7-day baseline observation period, half of the mice received ASD and the other half received vehicle for 5 days. Following a 2-day washout period where no drug or vehicle was administered, each group was administered the opposite treatment for an additional 5 days. Finally, all mice were observed for SRSs without treatment for an additional 7 days in order to monitor any reversal of ASD-induced effects.\n\n2.6. Data analysis and statistics\nPost-KA injection SE was analyzed by first applying a 60 Hz notch filter and then quantifying gamma frequency (20\u201370 Hz) power of the EEG recording as previously described (\nLehmkuhle et al., 2009\n). This filtering approach was used to reduce motion artifact and other sources of noise in the electrophysiological recording. For all other experiments, the total number of SRSs were quantified per IAK mouse and subsequently averaged for all mice in each study on a daily or weekly basis. A representative SRS EEG recording can be seen in\nFig. 1C\n, and an additional SRS with an associated video recording of the mouse behavioral seizure can be seen in\nVideo 1\n. Seizure freedom was defined as zero seizures occurring between the first and last dose of drug. SRSs clusters were defined, according to Lim et al., as the occurrence of one or more seizures per day for at least three consecutive days and at least five seizures within the cluster period (\nLim et al., 2018\n). All numerical values were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM, and all error bars on graphs represent SEM. Statistical differences between categorical data (general outcomes, FJB + and \u2013, and seizure freedom percentages) were compared using a Fisher\u2019s Exact Test. Differences in latent periods between Midazolam and No Midazolam groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney Test. Differences in average weekly SRS frequencies over 90 days between Midazolam and No Midazolam groups were compared with a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. Differences in average weekly SRS frequencies between ASD and vehicle groups were compared with the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed Rank Test. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism V8.4.3 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA); *, **, ***, or **** indicate a\np\n-value of <0.05, <0.01, <0.001, and < 0.0001, respectively."

    "Methods": "Animals\u2013\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. A total of 84 male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) age eight weeks were housed four per cage and maintained in a humidity-controlled room with food and water\nad libitum\n, on a 12 h light dark cycle (lights on at 06:00). Detailed methods are provided in the\nsupplementary materials\n.\n\nExperimental Design \u2013\nCages were randomly assigned to the four experimental groups using an online random number generator; (\nhttps://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1/\n. Group 1 \u2013 sham saline, group 2 \u2013 sham ketamine, group 3 \u2013 mbTBI saline and group 4 \u2013 mbTBI ketamine with n=12 per group. On each behavioral test day, mice were treated in accordance with their group assignment. Ketamine\u2019s initially impairing activity was screened in the context of TBI using three behavioral endpoints; gait, prepulse inhibition and step-down inhibitory avoidance. These behavioral endpoints were evaluated 15 minutes following ketamine administration on day 7, day 14 and day 15 post injury respectively. The doses of ketamine used in these assays were the threshold dose that induced impairment in healthy uninjured animals, i.e., gait 10 mg/kg, prepulse inhibition 20 mg/kg, and step down avoidance 30 mg/kg administered i.p. The human dose equivalent is approximately 0.6, 1.6 and 2.4 mg/kg. Subjects receiving ketamine for the indication of major depressive disorder are typically administered 0.5 \u2013 1 mg/kg intravenously over a 40 minute period (\nFava et al., 2020\n;\nIqbal and Mathew, 2020\n). It was hypothesized that injury animals would exhibit a more pronounced effect of the drug relative to their healthy sham controls at these threshold doses. To determine whether the longevity of increased sensitivity to the impairing effects of ketamine was retained in animals, mice were again administered ketamine on day 35 and day 42 at the doses outlined above and screened on gait and prepulse inhibition respectively. Mice were also screened on day 43 for behavioral performance in the step down inhibitory avoidance but were not treated with ketamine on that day. Screening the beneficial behavioral effects of ketamine 10 mg/kg occurred at one month post injury using the forced swim test and 3 months post injury with the sucrose preference test. This dose is known to reverse the behavioral effects of stress in mice (\nAutry et al., 2011\n;\nZanos et al., 2018\n). These assays were screened only once. Experimenters were blinded to both injury and treatment groups. All animals survived for the duration of the experimental period. A schematic of the behavioral testing procedure conducted post ABS or Sham exposure is provided in\nFigure 1a\n.\nFigure 1 \u2013 ABS induced alterations in righting reflex and body weight gain.\nOpen in a new tab\nThe schematic in\na\noutlines the study design, indicating the day post ABS or Sham exposure at which the behavioral assays were conducted. All mice were anesthetized prior to the placement in the ABS apparatus. Confirmation of the mbTBI phenotype was indicated by an increased righting reflex latency (s) in\nb.\nMice exposed to the ABS condition designated mbTBI exhibited increased righting reflex latencies relative to Sham animals (*** denotes a p < 0.001). Weekly % weight gain throughout the experimental period is represented in\nc\n. ABS \u2013 advanced blast simulator, PPI \u2013 prepulse inhibition, FST \u2013 forced swim test, SPT \u2013 sucrose preference test, mbTBI \u2013 mild traumatic brain injury.\n\nMild blast traumatic brain Injury (mbTBI) \u2013\nMice given a single exposure to the Advanced Blast Stimulator (ABS; ORA Inc., Fredericksburg, VA) were first anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane and then received a short duration shock wave (<10 msec, mean peak pressure 19.9 psi), as previously described (\nJaiswal et al., 2019\n;\nRussell et al., 2018\n). Sham animals that were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane, placed in the ABS test chamber, and were not exposed to the shock wave served as contemporary controls for TBI. All mice were immediately returned to their home cage, placed upon a warmer (38\u00b0C), and monitored until they regained consciousness. The duration of righting reflex suppression was evaluated during this time (\nHamm, 2001\n;\nRussell et al., 2018\n;\nTucker et al., 2016\n) as the time it took for animals to return to an upright position (forepaws touching the ground) and recorded as the time to right. This parameter was used as a correlate of duration of unconsciousness due to the anesthetic and blast exposure. Behavioral testing was initiated one week after the blast exposure.\n\nDrugs \u2013\nR, S-ketamine hydrochloride (Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Henry Schein, NY, USA) was dissolved in sterile 0.9% saline (Quality Biological, MD, USA). Doses were derived from pilot data (not published) on assays that determined the appropriate impairing (measured within 15 min of injection), or beneficial effect (assayed 24 h post administration) at the lowest dose possible. Mice were administered either ketamine or saline via intraperitoneal injection at an injection volume of 10 ml/kg.\n\nGait analysis \u2013\nMotor function and coordination following Sham or mbTBI exposure was evaluated on day 7 and day 35 using the DigiGait system (Mouse Specifics Inc.), following the previously published method (\nKwok et al., 2020\n). Ventral Plane Imaging Technology generated digital paw prints and dynamic gait signals. Following a 5 min training session, mice were administered ketamine (10 mg/kg) or saline and retested within 10 min of treatment at a treadmill speed of 9 cm/s. An average of 12 \u00b1 4 steps were recorded for each mouse. Post drug test scores were used for all groups. Alterations in dynamic stability were evaluated across several parameters.\n\nPrepulse Inhibition (PPI) \u2013\nThe acoustic startle reflex was evaluated in three sound-attenuated chambers (SR-LAB-Startle Response System, San Diego instruments, San Diego, CA). Testing was performed on day 14 and day 42 post ABS or Sham exposure immediately following ketamine (20 mg/kg) or saline treatment. Each startle session consisted of a 10-min acclimation period in the chamber, during which a 65 dB background noise was presented. A two block PPI test session evaluated the ability of 20-ms white noise bursts at 69, 73, 77, 81, and 85 dB to attenuate the startle response to a 40 ms 115 dB white noise pulse 100 ms after the prepulse. PPI was determined using the standard metric for analysis\nPPI\nratio\n=\ns\nb\n\u2212\ns\np\ns\nb\n=\n1\n\u2212\n(\ns\np\ns\nb\n)\n, where sb is the animals baseline startle response to the acoustic stimulus alone and sp is startle when preceded by a prepulse.\n\nPassive Avoidance \u2013\nThe step-down inhibitory avoidance task was based on a previous publication (\nSakaguchi et al., 2006\n) with modifications and conducted on day 15 and 16 following exposure to the ABS or Sham conditions. The apparatus consisted of a transparent Plexiglas chamber plastic platform (mouse hut platform, Bio-Serv, Flemington, NJ) located on an electrified grid floor (Bio-Signal Group, Brooklyn, NY). During training, an electric shock (0.5 mA) was delivered for 2 s approximately 10 s following \u201cstep down\u201d. Mice were then injected with ketamine (30 mg/kg) or saline. Retention tests were performed 1 h, 24 h and 43 days after treatment, during which the latency to \u201cstep down\u201d onto the grid floor was measured. An upper cut-off time of 180 s was set for the trial.\n\nForced Swim Test (FST) \u2013\nAntidepressant compounds reliably decrease immobility scores of mice (\nLucki et al., 2001\n) and ketamine has been shown to reduced immobility up to 24 h after administration (\nBrowne et al., 2018\n). Individual mice were gently placed in a cylinder (22 cm diameter) of water (25\u00b0C \u00b1 1\u00b0C) for a period of 6 min. Immobility was defined as the absence of movement, except those required to maintain the mouse\u2019s head above water. Mice were tested 24 h following the last of three saline or ketamine (10 mg/kg) injections, spaced every 48 h, on day 28 post ABS. This injection regimen is more clinically relevant.\n\nSucrose Preference Test (SPT) \u2013\nAdapted from a previously published protocol, (\nJacobson et al., 2020\n) mice were given two overnight adaptation sessions to a two-bottle choice paradigm. One bottle contained a 1% sucrose solution (dissolved in water; Catalog # S5\u2013500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MD, USA), and the other was filled with water. Mice were administered ketamine (10 mg/kg) and tested for sucrose preference overnight on day 74 following ABS exposure.\n\nStatistical analysis \u2013\nGraph Pad Prism 9 for Windows (Graph Pad Prism, La Jolla, CA) was used for all analyses. Righting reflex was evaluated with a Mann Whitney test for non-parametric data. Weight gain was analyzed with a repeated measures ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons to compare the effects of ABS and treatment over time. For all other variables two-way ANOVA for ABS x treatment interactions were conducted, with Bonferroni multiple comparisons used where appropriate. Based on power calculations, the inclusion of 12 mice per group was required to achieve statistical significance with a power of 0.8, with alpha set at 0.05 to detect type I errors. Data points were excluded from analysis if greater than two standard deviations from the mean. Two outliers were excluded from the FST analysis, one in the sham saline and one in the sham mbTBI group. Three outliers were excluded from the SPT analysis."

    "Methods": "2.1. Mouse retinal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury and optic nerve crush (ONC) models:\nAll experiments were performed in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (Animal Welfare Assurance no. D16\u201300197). Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice (10\u201312 weeks old) were anesthetized using ketamine/xylazine mixture then subjected to retinal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury or optic nerve crush (ONC) to model traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) as previously described.\n5\n,\n10\nMice were sacrificed at 24 hours or 7 days after by deep anesthesia followed by trans-cardial perfusion with PBS or thoracotomy. Eyeballs were then collected and fixed in 4% PFA for immunolabeling or retinas were extracted without fixation and homogenized in Radioimmunoprecipitation Assay (RIPA) lysis buffer for Western blotting.\n2.1.1. IR-injury model:\nFor induction of retinal IR-injury, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine mixture and a needle connected to an elevated saline reservoir was inserted into the anterior chamber the right eye to raise the intraocular pressure to 110\u2009mmHg for 1 hour. The left eye served as sham control.\n2.1.2. ONC model:\nFor induction of ONC, mice were anesthetized under isoflurane inhalation and one drop of topical anesthesia (0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride) was applied to the eyeball. The conjunctiva on the left eye was incised on the temporal side, and the orbital muscles were gently deflected while clamping (crushing) the optic nerve 1\u20132 mm from the eyeball using a self-closing N7 forceps (Fine Science Tools, CA). The right eye was used as sham control.\n\n2.2. MCAO model:\nC57BL/6J mice (12\u201316 week-old male, 25\u201330 g) were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using the intraluminal filament technique (Docol 602145) for 60-minutes followed by reperfusion as previously described.\n11\nA heating pad was used to maintain body temperature at 37\u00b0C. Animals showed 12 to 14% weight loss at 24 hours, which was not different between the groups. Testing was performed 1 hour after reperfusion and animals that did not show a motor deficit after cerebral ischemia were excluded from the study. A total of nine animals out of 26 animals (34.6%) were excluded from study. Four animals were excluded immediately after reperfusion due to lack of deficit, and five animals were excluded at sacrifice due to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Sham surgery involved all the regular surgery steps except the filament insertion. Mice were deeply anesthetized at 24 hours and sacrificed by trans-cardial perfusion with PBS. Then brains were collected and sectioned for triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining or homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer for western blotting.\n2.2.1. Sensorimotor assessment:\nBederson score was conducted as described previously.\n12\nBriefly, Mice were scored based on the following five parameters: 0) no observable deficit; 1) forelimb flexion; 2) forelimb flexion and decreased resistance to lateral push; 3) circling; 4) circling and spinning around the cranial-caudal axis; and 5) no spontaneous movement.\n2.2.2. Infarct size analysis:\nBrain infarct size was determined based on TTC staining of brain sections as previously described.\n11\nEach mouse brain was cut into four 2-mm-thick coronal sections using a brain matrix after excluding the olfactory bulb, and the cerebellum, then stained with TTC. Images of TTC-stained sections were analyzed in a blinded fashion using ImageJ software [National Institutes of Health (NIH)], and the infarct size was calculated with edema correction using the following formula: 100 \u00d7 [nonstroked \u2212 (stroked \u2212 infarct)]/nonstroked.\n\n2.3. PEGylated arginase 1 (PEG-A1) treatment:\nA pharmaceutical grade of PEG-A1 was provided as a kind gift from Bio-Cancer Treatment International Limited (BCT, Hong Kong). PEG-A1 is a recombinant human arginase (rhArg) covalently attached to methoxy polyethylene glycol (mPEG-SPA; MW 5,000) via succinamide propionic acid (SPA) linker to increase its stability and half-life in vivo (half-life = 3 days vs a few minutes for the native enzyme).\n13\nMethoxy polyethylene glycol propionic acid (MW 5,000 \u2013 Sigma, Catalog number 88908\u20131G-F) was used as vehicle control. Animals were injected intraperitoneally with a dose of 25 mg/kg of PEG-A1 or PEG without arginase (vehicle control) at 3 hours after brain or retina injury and at day 4 for mice sacrificed at day 7. The dose was selected based on the published literature and preliminary dose response studies, and dosing interval was based on the PEG-A1\nin vivo\nhalf-life of 3 days.\n13\n,\n14\nThe cerebral ischemia experiment involved behavioral scoring and manual quantification of the infarct size, and was conducted in a blinded fashion. The surgeon performing the surgery, behavioral analysis and infarct size analysis was provided with drug treatment (PEG-A1) and control vehicle (PEG) that are masked and coded. Mice were randomly assigned to the coded treatments and unmasking was performed after completion of experiment and analysis. Another cohort of mice was subjected to MCAO without treatment to compare its outcomes to the treatment groups.\n\n2.4.\nEx vivo\nexplants:\nRetinal explants were prepared according to published protocols with modifications.\n15\n,\n16\nMice were deeply anesthetized by ketamine/xylazine mixture and then killed by cervical dislocation. Retinal eyecups were gently dissected and immersed in ice-cold HBSS containing penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL). Under a dissecting microscope, the retinas were gently removed and cut radially into four separate equal-sized petals. The retina petals were placed in cell culture inserts (12 mm diameter, 0.4 \u03bcm pore, Millipore) with the inner retina facing up. The inserts were placed in 24-well plate in Neurobasal A medium supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen), 1% N2 (Invitrogen), 2 mM GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL). Plates were placed in a humidified 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO\n2\n. For OGD/R experiments, explants were placed in DMEM no glucose medium in a hypoxia chamber (ProOx 110, Biospherix, <1% O\n2\n, 94% N\n2\n, and 5% CO\n2\nat 37 \u00b0C) for the desired duration (1, 3, or 5 hours) then switched back to Neurobasal A growth medium and reoxygenated in a regular incubator (95% air, 5% CO\n2\nat 37 \u00b0C) for the reminder of a total 24-hour experiment (23, 21, or 19 hours respectively) to model the ischemia-reperfusion injury. At the end of the experiment, explants were fixed in 4% PFA and processed for flat-mount staining.\n\n2.5. Myeloid A1 KO mice:\nOne experiment was conducted on explants isolated from myeloid A1 knock out (M-A1 KO) mice and floxed (A1\nf/f\n) controls (both on C57BL/6J background). To generate the M-A1 KO mice, we crossed mice expressing Cre under control of the myeloid lineage-specific promoter of the lysozyme 2 gene (Lyz2) (LysMcre, Jackson Labs stock No. 004781) with A1\nf/f\nmice (Jackson Labs stock No. 008817). Genotype was determined by PCR using tail genomic DNA. The breeding, characterization, and confirmation of A1 deletion in these mice were described previously.\n4\n\n2.6. Western blotting:\nWestern blotting on retina or brain was conducted as previously described.\n4\nMembranes were probed with anti-PEG (RevMAb Biosciences, Cat # 31\u20131008-00, 1:1000) and anti-albumin (Bethyl Laboratories, 1:5000). Uncropped blots are included in\nsupplementary fig. 1\n.\n\n2.7. Fluorescent immunolabeling:\nRetinal flat-mounts were permeabilized and immunolabeled with anti-PEG antibody (RevMAb Biosciences, 1:400) and co-stained with Alex594-labeled Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4 (1:200; Invitrogen) as previously described.\n5\n\n2.8. Evaluation of retinal neurodegeneration and microglia/macrophage count:\n2.8.1. Retinal neurodegeneration:\nRetina flat-mounts and explants were immunolabeled for the neuronal marker, NeuN (Millipore), as previously described.\n5\nZ-stack images were collected from the ganglion cell layer (GCL) to examine the surviving ganglion cells, which are mostly affected in the ischemic and traumatic injury models employed in this study. Four images per retina flat-mount were taken in the mid-periphery of each retina petal using an inverted confocal microscope (LSM 780; Carl Zeiss). Three images were taken per explant. Images were analyzed in a blinded fashion using a semi-automated method; NeuN-positive cells were quantified using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). \u2018Batch processing\u2019 function was employed. A prerecorded ImageJ macrocode (\nSupplementary fig./file 2\n) was used for batch processing to create a Z-project for each stack of images using maximum intensity projection. The macro then creates an automatic thresholding followed by \u2018Analyze particles\u2019 function with size exclusion below 25 \u03bcm\n2\nto exclude non-specific speckles. The macro was validated every time it was used to make sure it is compatible with the set of images being analyzed. Results from four images per retina (three for explants) were averaged to represent neuron density for each retina. Results are presented as % surviving NeuN-positive cells in the GCL after injury as compared to sham retina or control explant under normoxia conditions.\n2.8.2. Retinal microglia/macrophage count:\nRetina flat-mounts were immunolabeled for the microglia/macrophage marker, Iba-1 (Wako). Z-stack images were taken and the number of Iba-1 positive cells was quantified using the \u2018Analyze particles\u2019 function as described earlier.\n\n2.9. Quantitative Real Time-PCR:\nRNA from the retina (n=5/group) was isolated using RNAqueous-4PCR Total RNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, US) as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 250 ng RNA was used to prepare cDNA using a high-capacity M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed on cDNA (diluted 1 in 10 with nuclease-free water), using gene-specific primes on an ABI StepOne Plus Thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, US). The primers used in this study were either obtained from TaqMan gene expression assay (Applied Biosystems) or Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA, US). The details are provided in the\nTable\nbelow. The relative gene expression is calculated based on the comparative threshold cycle (\u0394\u0394Ct) method. Expression levels for all genes were normalized to the mean value of internal control, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), and reported as fold change to untreated controls.\nTable.\nof Primers used in the study:\nGene ID\nSequence / Reference ID\nProbes\nSource\nMCP-1\nForward: GGCTCAGCCAGATGCAGTTAA\nReverse: CCTACTCATTGGGATCATCTTGCT\nSYBR Green\nIDT\niNOS\nForward: GGCAGCCTGTGAGACCTTTG Reverse: TGCATTGGMGTGAAGCGTTT\nSYBR Green\nIDT\nIL-10\nForward: GCTCTTACTGACTGGCATGAG Reverse: CGCAGCTCTAGGAGCATGTG\nSYBR Green\nIDT\nIL-1\u03b2\nForward: TGCCACCTTTTGACAGTGATG Reverse: ATGTGCTGCTGCGAGATTTG\nSYBR Green\nIDT\nF4/80\nForward: ATAGCTTCCGAGAGTGTTGTGGCA Reverse: TGTCTGACAATTGGGATCTGCCCT\nSYBR Green\nIDT\nHPRT\nForward: GAAAGACTTGCTCGAGATGTCATG Reverse: CACACAGAGGGCCACAATGT\nSYBR Green\nIDT\nTNF-\u03b1\nMm 00443258-m1\nFAM\nTaqMan Assay\nBDNF\nMm 04230607-s1\nFAM\nTaqMan Assay\nIL-6\nMm 00446190-m1\nFAM\nTaqMan Assay\nA1\nMm00475988-m1\nFAM\nTaqMan Assay\nHPRT\nMm00446968-m1\nFAM\nTaqMan Assay\nOpen in a new tab\n\n2.10. Retinal neurons culture:\n2.10.1. Primary retinal neurons:\nPrimary retinal mixed neurons were isolated from newborn Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat pups at postnatal day (P) 1\u20132 as described previously with modifications.\n17\n,\n18\nRetinas from ten pups were collected and washed twice with ice-cold 1 \u00d7 PBS. They were digested with 0.5% trypsin for 3\u20134 min at 37 \u00b0C, followed by trypsin inactivation with the culture medium, DMEM/F12 (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) plus 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (P/S) solution (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). The retina tissue was mechanically dissociated by pipetting several times until cells were dispersed. Cells were then filtered through a 40 \u03bcm nylon-mesh filter, collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min, re-suspended in culture medium, and plated in 6 or 12 well-cell culture plates (Corning, Corning, NY) coated with Poly-D-lysine hydrobromide (PDL, Sigma) at a density of 0.5 \u00d7 106 cells / mL. The plates were maintained in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. At days 1, 2, and 3 in vitro (DIV), half of the medium was aspirated and replaced with Neurobasal A medium containing 1X B-27 (GIBCO), 1X glutaMAX (GIBCO) and 1% P/S. Experiments were conducted at DIV 6. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed the high purity of cultured neurons using the neuron marker; Neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (TuJ1), and glia marker; Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (\nsupplementary fig. 3\n).\n2.10.2. R28 retinal neuronal-like cells:\nCells were purchased from Kerafast, Inc. Boston, MA 02210. Cells were cultured and differentiated as described previously.\n19\n\u2013\n21\nCell passages 67 to 70 were used for experiments. R28 cells were cultured in DMEM with low glucose (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin-streptomycin, 1% Amphotericin B. For differentiation, cells were passaged into Laminin-coated plates and supplemented with 250 \u03bcM pCPT-cAMP for overnight incubation.\n2.10.3. Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) protocol:\nOxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in vitro was used to mimic\nin vivo\nischemia/reperfusion injury. To achieve OGD, neuron culture was incubated in a hypoxia chamber (ProOx 110, Biospherix, <1% O\n2\n, 94% N\n2\n, and 5% CO\n2\nat 37 \u00b0C) and glucose free DMEM medium and in some experiments this was followed by \u201creoxygenation\u201d in complete medium under normoxic conditions (95% air, 5% CO\n2\nat 37 \u00b0C). Specific durations of OGD or OGD/R were as follows: Differentiated R28 cells were subjected to OGD for 3 or 24 hours and treated with PEG-A1 (1 \u03bcg/ml) for the duration of experiment then LDH release assay (Roche) was conducted on the supernatant following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Another passage of R28 cells were exposed to 3 hours of OGD followed by 3 hours of reoxygenation and treated with PEG-A1 (0. 1 and 1 \u03bcg/ml) at reoxygenation followed by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay as previously described.\n22\nPrimary retinal neurons were subjected to OGD for 6 hours followed by reoxygenation for 18 hours and treated with PEG-A1 (1 \u03bcg/ml) or the arginase inhibitor ABH (2(S)-amino-6-boronohexanoic acid, 100 \u03bcM) at reoxygenation followed by LDH release assay.\n\n2.11. BMDMs:\nBone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were freshly isolated from WT mice femurs and tibias and differentiated in culture using differentiation medium (DMEM high glucose containing 20% FBS, 20% L929 cells conditioned media, and 1% P/S) for 7 days as previously described.\n4\nTo determine PEG-A1 intracellular uptake by macrophages, BMDMs were treated overnight with PEG-A1 or vehicle in normal growth media (DMEM high glucose containing 20% FBS, and 1% P/S), and then washed several times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) before collection in RIPA buffer for Western blotting.\n\n2.12. Statistical Analysis:\nStatistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism 9 software. Differences between two groups were determined by student\u2019s t-test. Comparisons between multiple groups (retina explants and neuron culture experiments) were analyzed by ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. P values < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Graphs were prepared using GraphPad Prism 9 software and data were presented as mean \u00b1 standard error (SE)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll studies followed National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. Male Wistar rats \u22658 weeks, initially weighing 175\u2013200g (Hsd: WI, Envigo, Indianapolis, IN) were used in this study. Animals were initially double housed until post-surgery, where they were singly housed in a temperature-controlled room (21-24\u00b0C), maintained on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle with food and water\nad libitum\n.\n\nSCI, Post-Operative Care, and Retrograde NG DiI Labeling\nThe animals (n = 32) randomly received either T3-SCI or sham control (laminectomy-only) surgery 3-days or 3-weeks prior to experimentation to reflect acute and chronic time points following injury, respectively, as previously described (\nTong et al., 2011\n;\nBesecker et al., 2018\n;\nBesecker et al., 2020\n). Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (3\u20135%, 1 l/min O\n2\n) to achieve areflexia and administered a prophylactic antibiotic (Enroflox, 10 mg/ml, Bayer, Shawnee Mission, KS) subcutaneously to reduce post-surgical infection. For post-operative pain relief, the animals received a sustained release of buprenorphine (1 mg/kg, Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc., Richmond, VA). During anesthesia, the surgical site overlying the upper thoracic vertebrae was shaved and cleaned following standard veterinary recommendations. A 3- to 5-cm midline incision was made in the skin overlying the T1\u2013T3 vertebrae and the musculature was detached from T1\u2013T3 vertebrae by blunt dissection. Following exposure of the T2 vertebrae, fine-tipped rongeurs were used to remove the spinous process and the laminae to expose the T3 spinal segment. T3-SCI assigned rats were placed in the Infinite Horizons spinal contusion injury device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Lexington, KY). A 300-kdyne impact (15-s dwell time) was given to the T3 spinal segment. Following injury, all surgical incisions were closed in reverse with absorbable suture (Vicryl 4\u20130) and wound clips. Sham surgical controls underwent all procedures except the contusion injury.\nThe gastric projecting vagal afferent neurons were labeled by injecting 3% 1,1\u2019-dioctadecyl 3,3,3\u2019,3\u2019-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) solution immediately below the serosa of the dorsal and ventral corpus of the stomach (~10 \u03bcl/site). The animals were initially anesthetized (as above) under isoflurane anesthesia and an aseptic laparotomy was performed to expose the stomach. Following the DiI injections, the midline incision was closed with absorbable suture (Vicryl 4\u20130) and wound clips.\nPostoperatively, rats were administered a subcutaneous (SC) injection of 5 ml warmed lactated Ringer\u2019s solution. The animals were allowed to stabilize in an incubator (37\u00b0C) until fully recovered from anesthesia. T3-SCI cages were placed on warming pads (41.7\u00b0C) to help maintain body temperature (37\u00b0C). Food and body weight were monitored daily to calculate mean energy intake (MEI;\nPrimeaux et al., 2007\n). Rats received antibiotics (Enrofloxacin, 10 mg/kg) for 5 days post-surgery. T3-SCI rats were administered an SC injection of 5 ml warmed lactated Ringer\u2019s solution and received bladder expression twice daily until recovery of spontaneous voiding.\n\nSpinal Injury Severity Assessment\nThe extent of the spinal cord lesion centers was assessed postmortem. Spinal cords were harvested after euthanasia and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Thereafter, the tissues were cryosectioned into 40 \u03bcm sections, mounted on gelatin-coated slides, dried, and stained with Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) to identify the myelinated fibers. The lesion centers were imaged using a Zeiss Axioskop Microscope and Axiocam CCD camera and analyzed with Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Inc., McLean, VA). The cross-sectional area for the images was measured by outlining the boundaries of the tissue slices. Using a standardized color and brightness value range for LFB, the pixels corresponding to LFB staining above background were selected. These pixels were quantified and expressed per unit cross-sectional area as previously described (\nNoble & Wrathall, 1985\n) The proximity of the T3 lesion center to the cervical enlargement precluded the commonly utilized determination of spinal cord cross-sectional area in undamaged tissue rostral to the injury (\nScheff et al., 2003\n). Therefore, it was necessary that the cross-sectional area of the intact spinal cords at T3 of comparably sized animals be determined for normalization purposes. LFB-stained myelin in injured tissue was expressed as a percent of the total spinal cord cross-sectional area as would be predicted by the intact tissue as previously described (\nBesecker et al., 2017\n;\nBesecker et al., 2020\n;\nScheff et al., 2003\n;\nTotoiu, 2005\n;\nTong, 2011\n). It should be noted that a criterion was employed whereby tissues with \u2265 25% LFB staining were excluded in the analysis. However, in all tissues measured, no T3-SCI rat met this criterion.\n\nNG Neuron Isolation\nThe rats were initially anesthetized with CO\n2\nand then quickly decapitated with a laboratory guillotine. The NG tissue was blunt dissected from the carotid arteries and surrounding tissue in ice-cold Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution. Thereafter, the NG tissue was enzymatically dissociated as described previously (\nBlanke et al., 2019\n). Briefly, the NG tissue was incubated in Earle\u2019s balanced salt solution containing 0.6 mg/ml collagenase (Roche Diagnostics Corp. Indianapolis, IN), 0.4 mg/ml trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corp. Lakewood, NJ), 0.1 mg/ml DNAase Type I (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA) in a shaking water bath at 35\u00b0C for 60 min. Afterward, the neurons were centrifuged twice and the dispersed neurons were resuspended in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (VWR International, Radnor, PA), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY). Following dissociation, NG neurons were plated onto poly-L-lysine coated dishes and incubated overnight in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO\n2\n/95% air at 37\u00b0C. For all electrophysiological recordings, a minimum of 3 animals for each group and 6 preparations per animal were performed.\n\nElectrophysiology and Data Analysis\nWhole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed on acutely dissociated DiI-labeled NG neurons. Electrophysiological recordings were acquired with the Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), analog filtered at a frequency of 2kHz (\u22123dB, four-pole low-pass Bessel filter) and digitized at 10 kHz with an A/D converter board (ITC-18, HEKA Instruments Inc., Bellmore, NY) employing custom-designed software (F6; Dr. Stephen R. Ikeda, NIH/NIAAA) on a Mac Mini (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA). All experiments were conducted at room temperature. Recording pipette electrodes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries (8250; King Precision Glass, Claremont, CA) pulled with a micropipette puller (P-97, Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA), coated with Sylgard (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) and then fire polished with a microforge (Narishige). Cell membrane capacitance and series resistance were compensated (80-85%) and lag was set to 7 \u03bcs. DiI-labeled neurons were identified with an inverted microscope (Nikon TE 2000) equipped with a G-2E/C filter cube containing an excitation filter at 540\u00b112 nm, a dichroic beam splitter of 565 nm (long pass) and an emission filter at 620\u00b130 nm.\nCurrent-Clamp Recordings.\nAction potential recordings of DiI-labeled neurons were obtained in the current-clamp mode. Resting membrane potential was measured at a holding current of 0 pA. The threshold current was determined by applying depolarizing current steps, 0\u201310 pA in 1 pA steps for 80 ms until an action potential was elicited. Thereafter, a single suprathreshold depolarizing current was applied to induce one action potential. The overshoot potential, duration time at 0 mV, and hyperpolarization potential was measured. Additionally, 1-, 2- and 3-times threshold currents were applied to the neurons to record the number of evoked action potentials. The internal solution used for these studies consisted of (in mM): KCl 140, CaCl\n2\n0.4, MgCl\n2\n1, HEPES 10, EGTA, 1, Mg-ATP 5, Na\n2\nGTP 0.3, Tris-CrPO\n4\n14. The internal solution was adjusted to a pH of 7.2 with KOH. The osmolality of the internal solution was 312 mOsm/kg. The external solution used for these studies consisted of (in mM): NaCl 140, KCl 5.4, CaCl\n2\n2, MgCl\n2\n0.8, HEPES 10, glucose 15, and sucrose 15. The external solution was adjusted to a pH of 7.4 with NaOH. The osmolality ranged from 321-324 mOsm/kg.\nCurrent-Voltage (I\u2013V) Relationships.\nThe averaged I\u2013V relationships were generated with the voltage protocol shown in\nFigure 11\n. The peak Na\n+\ncurrent was measured at each test potential ranging from \u221280 mV to +60 mV from a holding potential of \u221280 mV. The current density was calculated from the peak Na\n+\ncurrent amplitude and normalized to cell capacitance. Cell membrane capacitance was determined by eliciting a 5 ms step pulse from \u221280 to \u221270 mV prior to compensating for the cell membrane capacitance and series resistance. All traces were corrected for leak current.\nFigure 11.

Currents were evoked with 25 msec depolarizing pulses to various step potentials from a holding potential of \u221280 mV. TTX (0.3 \u03bcM) was present in the external solution to suppress TTX-sensitive Na\nV\nchannels. (C) I-V relationships for sham (black) and SCI (red). The mean (\u00b1 SE) peak current amplitudes were plotted versus the step potential. The number of tested cells for 3-day sham and SCI were (5-40) and (6-37), respectively; while those for 3-week sham and SCI were (18-29) and (27-34), respectively.\nActivation and Inactivation Curves.\nIn this set of experiments, Na\nV\n1.8 activation curves were determined by employing the chord conductance equation: G\nNa\n+\n= I\nNa\n+\n/(E\nM\n\u2212\nE\nNa\n+\n), where G\nNa\n+\nis the peak membrane conductance at potential E\nM\nand E\nNa\n+\nis the Na\n+\nreversal potential. The reversal potential was estimated by interpolation of a linear portion of the I\u2013V curve. We then obtained a least squares fit to a modified Boltzmann function employing nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 9.1 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA): G\nNa\n/G\nmax\n= 1/(1+exp[(V\nH\n\u2212V\nM\n)/k], where G\nNa\n/G\nmax\nis the fractional peak membrane conductance, V\nH\nis the half activation potential, V\nM\nis the membrane potential and k is a slope factor.\nFigure 12\nshows the voltage protocol employed to obtain Na\nV\n1.8 inactivation curves. A 0.5 sec conditioning pre-pulse over the potential range (\u221280 mV to +10 mV) followed by a test pulse to the peak test potential. A modified Boltzmann equation employing nonlinear regression analysis was used to obtain the curve fits.\nFigure 12. Na\nV\n1.8 activation and inactivation curves.\nOpen in a new tab\nActivation curves for Na\nV\n1.8 channels in sham (black) or SCI (red) NG neurons 3-days (A) and 3-weeks (B) post-SCI. Activation curves were obtained by plotting the chord conductance versus the step potential. The number of neurons tested for 3-day sham and SCI was 5-35 (sham), 6-36 (SCI), while 3-weeks it was 18-29 for sham and 27-34 for SCI. Steady-state inactivation curves were obtained by plotting the peak step current amplitude versus the conditioning prepulse voltage (protocol illustrated in the middle of C and D). The data were then fit to a Boltzmann equation. The number of tested cells for 3-day sham (black) and SCI (red) were (19-24) and (10-11), respectively; while those for 3-week sham (black) and SCI (red) were (26) and (33), respectively.\nThe internal recording solution used for these studies consisted of (in mM): N-methyl-D-glucamine 80, TEA-OH 20, EGTA 11, CaCl\n2\n1, CsCl 20, Cs-OH 40, MgATP 40, Tris-creatine phosphate 14, and Na\n2\nGTP 0.3. The internal solution was adjusted to a pH of 7.2 with CH\n3\nSO\n3\n. The osmolality of the internal solution ranged from 304\u2013306mOsm/kg. The external recording solution consisted of (mM): Na-gluconate 80, TEA-Cl 50, HEPES 10, glucose 15, sucrose 30, MnCl\n2\n5 and TTX 0.0003. The external solution was adjusted to a pH of 7.4 with TEA-OH. The osmolality ranged from 320\u2013326 mOsm/kg.\n\nSingle Cell qRT-PCR\nFollowing NG dissociation, 1-2 DiI positive cells were collected in individual PCR tubes containing Dulbecco\u2019s Phosphate Buffered Saline with Ca\n2+\nand Mg\n2+\n(Corning, Mediatech, Manassas, VA), lysed with 10X lysis buffer containing RNase inhibitor (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) and the RNA was isolated and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further analysis. Samples were later reverse transcribed to cDNA and analyzed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system. For qRT-PCR, Taqman Gene Expression Master Mix (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) and specific primers for GAPDH, Na\nV\n1.7, Na\nV\n1.8 and Na\nV\n1.9 (all from Thermo-Fisher Scientific) were used. All samples were run in triplicate employing the LifeTech QuantStudio 12K Flex and QuantStudio 3D digital PCR systems (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). Both Sham and SCI groups were compared using the Ct method, also known as the \u0394\u0394Ct method, and normalized to GAPDH mRNA control in order to calculate the relative fold gene expression of the samples. The percent change from Sham control was then plotted.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nThe electrophysiological recordings were analyzed with Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), and statistical analysis was performed with Prism 9.1. Unpaired\nt\n-tests were used to assess the statistical significance between T3-SCI and sham control groups. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze comparisons between time points and surgical groups. The Tukey post-hoc test was used for the white matter analysis. All data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error (SE) with statistically significant differences defined as p<0.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Experimental Design\n2.1.1. Experiment One: Acute Study\nTo assess the effects of minocycline on acute pathology, rats (n = 23) received bilateral frontal controlled cortical impact injuries or sham injuries. Starting at 1 h post-injury, rats were given either minocycline (45 mg/kg) or saline every 12 h for 5 days. Rats were transcardially perfused with cold saline, brains taken and cut sagittally on the midline with one-half processed for ELISA and the other half post-fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for four days for immunohistochemistry.\n2.1.2. Experiment Two: Chronic Behavioral Study\nTo determine whether minocycline treatment improved impulsivity and attention when administered acutely versus chronically, rats (n = 53) were trained on the 5CSRT. Rats received bilateral frontal controlled cortical impact injuries or sham injuries then were administered minocycline (45 mg/kg) or saline starting at 1 h post-injury or 9 weeks post-injury (\nFig 1B\n). Fecal samples were collected at the conclusion of treatment at the acute point to confirm the antibacterial effects of minocycline. Testing on the 5CSRT continued for 13 weeks after injury, then rats were transcardially perfused with cold saline, then 3.7% formaldehyde, and tissue was taken for histology.\nFig 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nA) Diagram of the five-choice serial reaction time task (Adapted with permission from\nVonder Haar et al., 2016\n; Copyright American Chemical Society). B) Timeline of study.\n\n2.2. Subjects\nSubjects were male Long-Evans rats (Charles River, Wilmington, MA). At the time of injury, rats were approximately 4 months (experiment 1) or 6 months old (experiment 2). Rats in experiment 1 were double-house in standard Allentown cages (Allentown, NJ) and single-housed after injury. Rats in experiment 2 were triple-housed in Optirat cages (Animal Care Systems, Centennial, CO) prior to injury, then moved to pair-housing, separated by a divider, after surgery. Environmental conditions were controlled, and rats were kept in an AAALAC accredited vivarium on a 12 h light/dark reverse cycle. Rats in experiment 1 were fed and watered\nad libitum\n, and rats in experiment 2 had free access to water and were maintained at 85 % of their free-feeding weight using standard chow (14 g/day). All work was approved by the West Virginia University and Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Rats were tested in three cohorts. One cohort was delayed in surgical date by approximately two months due to a lab closure during the Spring of 2020. To account for this effect, the cohort was added as a covariate into the analyses (see below), but ultimately had no effect on outcomes.\n\n2.3. The Five-choice serial reaction time task\n2.3.1. Apparatus\nTesting took place in 16 standard five-hole operant chambers (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT). The chambers were in sound-attenuating boxes, and white noise machines were used to ensure background noise was minimized. The chambers had a stainless-steel grid floor and contained two extendable levers and a food hopper with light on one side, and five nose-poke holes with lights in each hole on the opposite side of the chamber. The chambers were also equipped with a tone generator; only the five nose-poke holes with stimulus lights and food hopper were used in this study. Sucrose pellets (45 mg, BioServ, Fleming, NJ) were used as reinforcers. Custom software written in Med-PC IV controlled the chambers.\n2.3.2. The task\nThe 5CSRT measures impulsivity and attention (\nCarli et al., 1983\n). Trials were initiated with a nose poke into the food hopper which started a 5-s intertrial interval (ITI). If rats responded during the ITI, the behavior was punished with a 5-s timeout (premature response). After the ITI, a stimulus light in one of five of the holes illuminated for 0.5 s and correct responses (nose poke to illuminated hole) within the 5-s limited hold was reinforced. Failure to respond within the limited hold (omitted response) or incorrect responses (i.e., nose poke to wrong hole) were punished with a 5-s timeout. Each session lasted for 30 minutes and had a maximum of 100 trials (see\nFig 1A\n). The main variables of interest included percent premature responses (impulsivity), accuracy (attention; [correct] / [correct + incorrect responses] *100), percent omissions, and the task efficacy index ([correct] / [incorrect + premature + omissions]). Secondary measures collected included trials, collection latency, and response latency.\n2.3.3. Training\nBehavioral training was adapted from prior publications (\nCarli et al., 1983\n;\nVonder Haar et al., 2016\n). First, rats were habituated to the operant chambers by placing 5 sucrose pellets into each of the five nose poke holes and 10 pellets into the food hopper. After consuming all the sucrose pellets within 30 min, rats moved on to the 5-choice training sessions. The 5-choice training included 12 stages that had varying inter-trial intervals, stimulus durations, and limited holds (LH). Stage 1 started with a 2 s ITI and 30 s stimulus duration and 30 s LH. As the stages progressed, the ITI, stimulus durations, and LH gradually got closer to the full task of (5 s ITI, 0.5 s stimulus duration, and 5 s LH). Each training session lasted for 30 min and rats moved on to the next stage after criteria for their current stage was met. We assessed behavioral stability through visual examination of correct, incorrect, premature, and omission data for five days, which took approximately 65 sessions.\n2.3.4. Testing\nRats had 7 days of post-surgery recovery before they resumed testing on the 5CSRT. Rats were tested for 13 weeks after injury, that is, 4 weeks after the late round of minocycline treatment concluded.\n\n2.4. TBI Surgery\nRats in experiment 1 were randomly assigned to receive a TBI (n = 12) or sham injury (n = 11). Rats in experiment 2 were pair-matched based on premature and attention baseline data on the 5CSRT, then randomly assigned to receive a TBI (n = 36) or sham injury (n = 17). Rats received a severe bilateral frontal controlled cortical impact TBI (\nHoffman et al., 1994\n). First, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 2\u20134% maintenance) in 0.5 L/min oxygen. Rats were placed on a stereotaxic frame, local analgesic (bupivacaine, 0.1 mL of 0.25% solution) was administered at the incision site, and general analgesic given subcutaneously (ketoprofen, 5 mg/kg). Next, the incision site was sterilized, a midline incision performed, and retractors were placed. A 6 mm diameter circular craniotomy was completed at 3 mm anterior to bregma, centered on the midline. A Leica Impact One device (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) was used to induce a bilateral TBI with a consistent depth (\u22122.5 mm), velocity (3 m/s), and dwell (500 ms). Sterile gauze was used to stop bleeding after the impact, and then the incision site was sutured. Triple antibiotic ointment was put on the incision site to prevent infection. Sham surgeries were identical to TBI but excluded the impact.\n\n2.5. Minocycline Treatment/Treatment Groups\nMinocycline hydrochloride (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) was dissolved in a 12 mg/ml warmed saline solution and then given at 45 mg/kg (i.p.). Vehicle rats received matched saline volume based on body weight. In experiment 1, minocycline treatment or saline started at 1 h post-injury and was administered every 12 h for 5 days. Groups in experiment 1 included Sham-VEH (n = 6), Sham-MINO (n = 5), TBI-VEH (n = 6), and TBI-MINO (n = 6). For experiment 2, one group started treatment 1 h post-injury (MINO-Early) and the other received drug after post-injury behavioral stabilized, which was at 9 weeks post-injury (MINO-Late). Minocycline or vehicle was administered twice daily every 12 h for 5 days. Thus, there were 5 groups in experiment 2: Sham-VEH (n = 9), Sham-MINO (n = 8), TBI-VEH (n = 12), TBI-MINO-Early (n = 12), TBI-MINO-Late (n = 12). A t-test was performed on the first cohort of Sham-MINO animals, and since no behavioral effects were detected, they received minocycline doses at both early and late time points.\n\n2.6. Lesion Analysis\nUpon completion of behavioral testing (13 weeks after injury), rats were transcardially perfused with 0.9% phosphate buffered saline, followed by 3.7% phosphate buffered formaldehyde. Brains were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 24 h then placed in 30% sucrose. Brains were sliced using a sliding microtome or cryostat. Those sliced with the sliding microtome were embedded into 15% gelatin with 4 or 3 brains per matrix and then frozen and sliced into 30 \u03bcm coronal sections (\nShaver et al., 2019\n). Brains sliced with the cryostat were not embedded in gel and were sliced at \u221220 \u00b0C at 30 \u03bcm (\nVonder Haar et al., 2017\n). Brain slices were mounted on charged slides then stained with a thionin solution: slides were rehydrated with decrementing ethanol solutions, briefly submerged in thionin solution (10\u201320 s), and dehydrated in incrementing ethanol solutions. Immediately after the dehydration, slides were cover slipped. Images of the slides were captured at 600 DPI and then brain volume was measured using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Brain volume was calculated by averaging the area of five regions (+4.5, +3.5, +2.5, +1.5, +0.5 from bregma) then multiplying by thickness (30 \u03bcm) (\nShaver et al., 2019\n). Lesion volume was estimated by outlining the size of the lesion with ImageJ and adding the size of the ventricles for total lesion size.\n\n2.7. ELISA\nRats in experiment 1, were transcardially perfused with cold 0.9% phosphate buffered saline 6 days after injury. Brain punches from the perilesion area, orbitofrontal cortex, and hippocampus were extracted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Samples were homogenized and protein concentrations measured using the 260/280 nm absorbance ratio. Sandwich ELISA kits for TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (DY501\u201305, DY510\u201305, R&D Systems) were completed with minor modifications to manufacturer instructions. Samples (diluted 1:10 in perilesion, orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus; 1:5 in frontal cortex for TNF-\u03b1; approximately 1.5 mg/ml protein) were incubated at 4\u00b0 C overnight on capture antibody, but all other steps were kept the same. Protein concentrations were calculated using a 4-parameter logistic standard curve and normalized to the total protein content. For the TNF-\u03b1 ELISA, the perilesion and orbitofrontal were combined, and one frontal measure was analyzed.\n\n2.8. Immunohistochemistry\nMicroglia were assessed using a chromogenic IBA-1 stain (\nIto et al., 1998\n). Slices were incubated in 2% normal goat serum for 4\u201324 h at 4\u00b0C then left in the IBA-1 primary antibody (1:2000; WAKO 019\u201319741) for 48 h at 4\u00b0C. The secondary antibody was goat anti-Rabbit IgG (1:2000; vector BA-100) and was incubated for 90 min at room temperature. A Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) was used following the secondary. Last, for visualization, 3\u20133\u2019-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Vector Laboratories) peroxide solution was used (0.05% DAB & 0.015% H\n2\nO\n2\nin PBS). Stains were mounted on slides, dehydrated, then cover slipped. Images of the brains were taken at 40x magnification using an Olympus BX43 microscope with DP-80 13.5-megapixel camera in CellSens software or a Micromaster microscope with a SwiftCam 16MP Digital Camera. ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) was used to analyze microglia count in three regions of interest: prelimbic cortex (PL), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and hippocampus (HPC). Microglia were evaluated using ImageJ\u2019s automated count function and circularity index (0 = no circularity, 1 = perfectly round). To evaluate potential phenotypic shifts, counts were recorded at four different indices of circularity (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3). The automated counts were validated via hand counting by a person blinded to the conditions.\n\n2.9. Sequencing of Fecal Microbiome\nFecal samples were collected at the conclusion of minocycline treatment for the acute time point of experiment 2 to confirm activity of minocycline. Samples were frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C until processing. DNA was extracted using a PureLink DNA purification kit (\nA29790\n, ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer instructions. DNA was then sequenced at the Ohio State Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center by amplifying the V3-V4 region of the bacterial genome and sequencing the resulting product using 300-BP paired-end reads. This resulted in an average of 69,223 reads per sample. Data was processed using\ndada2\nin R: sequences were truncated for quality, then filtered and forward and reverse reads merged. Sequences were then mapped onto known taxonomies (Silva Project) and the resulting ASV table analyzed (\nphyloseq\npackage) for the Shannon diversity index (alpha diversity), weighted Unifrac distance (beta diversity), and relative abundance of any phyla representing greater than 5% of total reads.\n\n2.10. Data analysis\nFor all data analyses in experiment 2, the MINO-Early and MINO-Late groups were analyzed separately. Repeated measures data were analyzed with linear mixed effects regression (LMER), using individual subject and testing cohort intercepts as random effects. For the MINO-Early group, a LMER with baseline as a covariate was conducted to determine the effects of treatment and injury on the 5CSRT variables (\nVariable\n~ Injury*Drug*Week + Pre-Injury Baseline). Rats in the MINO-Late group were included as part of the TBI-Veh group in this analysis up until they received their dose. For the MINO-Late group analysis, a LMER with pre-drug baseline (i.e., performance in Week 8) was conducted to maximize the ability to detect potential therapeutic effects (\nVariable\n~ Injury*Drug*Week + Pre-Drug Baseline). Log transformations were performed on premature responses, omissions, and the task efficacy index and an arcsine square root transformation was performed on accuracy to normalize data. IBA-1\n+\ncells were analyzed via two-way mixed-effects ANOVA (Count ~ Injury*Drug) with subject as the random effect. A two-way ANOVA (Lesion ~ Injury*Drug) was used for the lesion analysis. For ELISA and alpha diversity data, a two-way ANOVA (Concentration ~ Injury * Drug) was performed. For non-parametric beta diversity data, PERMANOVA was used (999 permutations) with the Mann-Whitney posthoc. All data analysis was completed using R statistical software (version 4.0.2) and libraries\nlme4, lmerTest,\nand\nvegan\n."

    "Methods": "All materials were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) unless stated otherwise.\n\nAnimal care and use\nCommercially-available male C57BL/6J mice (WT) were purchased for experiments, while homozygous IL-4/GFP-enhanced transcript (IL-4-GFP) mice (JAX #004190), IL-4 KO mice (JAX #002253; on the C57BL6J background), and Thy1-GFP mice (JAX # 007788; on the C57BL6J background) were bred and used at 7 to 10 weeks old (20\u201325g, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). Sprague-Dawley male rats (226\u2013250g, Charles River Laboratories; Wilmington, MA) were also purchased and used in cell culture experiments. All animals were housed in a central animal care facility and provided with free access to food (PicoLab rodent diet 20, Purina Mills Nutrition International, St. Louis, MO) and water. Surgical procedures and peri-operative care measures were conducted in compliance with the AAALAC accredited Washington University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the National Institutes of Health guidelines.\n\nCell culture and immunocytochemistry\nDorsal root ganglia (DRG) cells, containing a mixture of neurons and glia, were isolated from DRG of Sprague-Dawley rats using standard protocols (\nSleigh, Weir, & Schiavo, 2016\n). Rats were used because Schwann cells from mice have limited capacity for myelination in vitro using standard protocols (\nP\u00e4iv\u00e4l\u00e4inen et al., 2008\n). Rats were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg, Vortech Pharmaceutical Ltd; Dearborn, MI). Isolated DRG were digested with 0.1% collagenase D, followed by trituration to obtain DRG neurons. Dissociated DRGs were cultured on PLL-laminin coated tissue culture plates in RPMI media with 2X B-27 supplement, 50 nM ascorbic acid, and 0.1% BSA at density of 1500 neurons per 1 cm\n2\n. Exogenous IL-4 (Peprotech, Cranbury, NJ) was added at 50 ng/mL and media changed daily. All cultures were maintained at 37\u00b0C in water jacketed incubators at 5% CO\n2\n.\nFor quantification of axonal extension, cells were fixed 36 hrs following culture, during which minimal glial proliferation is seen. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PFA) and then stained with primary antibodies to \u03b2III-tubulin, followed by secondary antibody with Alexa-555 conjugation. Stained cells were imaged using an Olympus IX81 microscope (Olympus) using a cooled, charged-coupled device (CCD) camera with MetaMorph Premier version 7.6.5.0 (Molecular Devices). Four random fields were sampled at 20x magnification. Images were quantified using ImageJ (NIH). For axonal length, the longest axon from each neuron is measured. For percent neuron with axonal extension, the number of DAPI+, \u03b2III tubulin neurons, and neurons with axons that extended at least 10 \u03bcm were counted, and expressed as the ratio of latter over former. For quantification of myelination, cells were fixed 2 weeks following culture with 2% PFA and stained for \u03b2III tubulin and myelin basic protein (MBP). The length of \u03b2III tubulin+, MBP+ axons were measured.\n\nSurgical procedures\nFor surgical procedures, mice were anesthetized using a cocktail of ketamine (100 mg/kg; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) and dexmedetomidine (0.5 mg/kg; Pfizer Animal Health, Exton, PA). Surgical procedures were performed using aseptic conditions with the aid of an operating microscope (JEDMED/KAPS, St. Louis, MO). The right hindquarter was shaved and prepped using betadine and ethanol, and then the skin chemically dilapidated. Under 10\u201325x magnification using sterilized micro-instruments, the right sciatic nerve was exposed and crushed using needle driver with tip width of 6mm (FST, Foster City, CA) 5 mm proximal to the distal trifurcation for 30 s. Then, a two-layered closure of muscle and skin was performed using 6\u20130 vicryl and skin closed using surgical staples, respectively. Atipamezole solution (0.1mg/kg; Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ) was administered for anesthesia reversal. The animals were recovered on a warming pad and monitored for postoperative complications before returning them to a central animal care facility. Postoperative pain was managed using Buprenorphine SR\u2122 (0.05 mg/kg; ZooPharm, Windsor, CO). Animals were monitored daily post-operatively for signs of infection and/or distress. At endpoints, animals were euthanized via cervical dislocation under anesthesia, and tissues collected for respective studies (see below).\n\nExogenous IL-4 delivery\nIn select mice as indicated in the results, exogenous IL-4 was delivered using a method previously validated (\nGoh et al., 2013\n). Briefly, 1 \u03bcg of IL-4 (Peprotech, Rockhill, NJ) was mixed with 20 \u03bcg of IL-4 antibody (Bioxcell, Lebanon, NH) for a final volume of 50 \u03bcL, and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes, and were then injected into mice intraperitoneally. Previous studies demonstrated a significantly improved half-life and bioactivity for IL-4 mixed with IL-4 antibody, as it yielded an affinity-based delivery system that preserved IL-4 activity\nin vivo\n(\nGoh et al., 2013\n). Control mice received PBS at similar volume. Mice selected to receive exogenous IL-4 or PBS received daily injections until the stated endpoint for tissue harvest.\n\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC)\nTo assess cell populations within DRG or peripheral nerves, the tissue were explanted at described endpoints post-injury and immediately placed in 4% PFA for 6 hrs followed by immersion in 30% sucrose in PBS solution for 48 hours. Muscle samples were immersed for 24 hrs in 4% PFA followed by 30% sucrose in PBS solution for 48 hrs. Samples were then frozen in OCT Compound (VWR, Radnor, PA) and sectioned at 15 \u03bcm onto pretreated charged glass slides. All nerve samples were sectioned longitudinally, and all muscle samples were sectioned in transverse. Sections were rehydrated with PBS and blocked using 5% BSA diluted with 0.1% triton in PBS for 1 hr before primary antibody staining. Primary antibodies (\nSupplemental Table 1\n) in 5% BSA buffer was applied and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were then washed in PBS and stained for the appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (\nSupplemental Table 1\n) for 1 h at room temperature. All sections were mounted with Fluoroshield mounting medium with DAPI (Abcam, Boston, MA) and then imaged using the Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope and acquisition system (Olympus, Waltham, MA) at overall 200x (20x water immersion objective) or 600x (60x oil immersion objective). For cell quantification of IL-4-GFP cells, the number of GFP+ cells per 600x image were counted. Three images per section were counted. For regenerating axon length (SCG10), proximal site of injury was identified by higher SCG10 stain intensity, and wavy pattern of axons. Straight lines were drawn away from the site of injury until labeling SCG10 positive axon tips and the average length of 3 longest axon reported. Two sections per nerve were measured and averaged for a single animal (n=1). For macrophage (CD68), myelin (MBP), and axonal (\u03b2III-tubulin) quantification, percent area was quantified from 3 images per nerve section, where an ImageJ macro was used to quantify the percentage of the area in a standardized field that was positive for the marker measured. For muscle fiber area (laminin), area of individual muscle fibers were measured in imageJ. A minimum of 50 muscle fibers were measured.\n\nFlow cytometry\nTo identify and quantify select cell populations, mice post-injury were euthanized and then nerves, DRG, and tibialis anterior muscle were collected. DRG, muscle, and nerve tissues were digested using a cocktail of 1 mL digestion buffer (0.1% collagenase, 0.05% DNase in 2% FBS/ Dulbecc\u00f2s Modified Eagle Media (DMEM)). Samples were incubated with digestion buffer for 20 minutes (30 minutes for muscle) at 37\u00b0C with constant agitation, and following digestion, the samples were re-suspended in FACS buffer (2% FBS, 0.1% sodium azide in phosphate buffered saline). After filtering through 75 \u03bcm membrane, the cells were incubated with rat anti mouse Fc block (BD) for 10 minutes followed by an antibody cocktail specific to the cells of interest (\nSupplemental Table 2\n) for 2 hours on ice, protected from light followed by fixation with eBioscience Intracellular Fixation & Permeabilization Buffer and analysis with flow cytometry using BD Fortessa at the Washington University Flow Cytometry and Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting Core. At least 300,000 events were acquired for flow cytometry. Data was analyzed using FlowJo (BD). Macrophages were gated by CD45+, CD11b+, CD64+, F4/80+. Neutrophils were gated by CD45+, CD11b+, CD64-, F4/80-, Ly6G+. Eosinophils were gated by CD45+, CD11b+, SiglecF+, CD64-, Ly6G- (\nSupplemental Figure 1\n). Schwann cells were gated by CD45-, Thy1-, O4+. Single color stained compensation beads were used as control.\n\nGene analysis (qRT-PCR) of macrophages isolated from crushed nerve\nIn a subset of WT mice fourteen days following nerve crush, macrophages were isolated using fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS), where sorting was based on the previously described flow cytometry and gating methodology specific to macrophages. After sorting, RNA was extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies), chloroform and a RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cDNA was generated with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Real-time PCR was performed using a Step One Plus thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using Taqman Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) reagents with specific oligonucleotide primer pairs (\nSupplemental Table 3\n). The expression levels of genes were normalized to\nActb\n. Data were analyzed using Step One Software v2.2.2 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).\n\nWhole mount analysis of Neuromuscular Junction innervation\nTo further quantify the extent of nerve regeneration, innervation of NMJs within the affected extensor digitorum longus (EDL) was analyzed. Seven days or fourteen days following nerve crush, the EDL muscle was removed and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes. Following washing in PBS, the muscle was permeabilized overnight at 4\u00b0C in 2% triton, 5% BSA in PBS. The next day, the muscle was stained with \u03b2III-tubulin antibody (1:200, in 0.5% triton, 5% BSA in PBS) for 48 hrs. After washing in PBS, the muscle was stained with secondary antibody (AlexaFluor conjugated 555) overnight, followed by staining with \u03b1-bungarotoxin-AlexaFluor 488 (Sigma). Muscles were imaged using a Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope at overall 200x magnification. The number of NMJs and NMJs with axon reinnervation were counted. NMJs were considered reinnervated based on colocalization of \u03b2III-tubulin and \u03b1-bungarotoxin staining, and the percentage of NMJs that were innervated or fully innervated (> 75% colocalization of \u03b1-bungarotoxin and \u03b2III-tubulin) was reported. Two images were taken per muscle belly, and all 4 muscle bellies were imaged. Images from all 4 muscle bellies were then analyzed and averaged to obtain a value for each single animal (n=1). For NMJ innervation, the proportion of \u03b1-bungarotoxin+ and \u03b2III-tubulin+ endplates among all \u03b1-bungarotoxin+ NMJ were calculated. For fully innervated NMJs, the portion of NMJs that were >75% overlapped with \u03b2III-tubulin+ among all NMJs were calculated.\n\nGrid walk assessment\nPrior to surgery and measured on days 3, 7, 14, and 21 post-nerve crush, mice underwent a grid walk assessment for functional recovery. Mice were placed on an elevated mesh or grid with a grid size measuring 2.5cm by 2.5cm. After mice have acclimated to the grid for at least 5 mins, they were recorded with a video camera for at least 4 minutes moving upon the grid. From the video considering the injured limb, the total number of steps with that foot and steps that resulted in a foot placement missing the mesh and going through the grid (slipped steps) was measured. Foot fault was calculated as the proportion of slipped steps to total steps.\n\nMuscle weight\nRelative gastrocnemius muscle mass was measured as an indication of reinnervation of denervated muscles and recovery from muscle atrophy. After nerve harvest at 2 weeks, muscles were harvested and weighed from experimental and contralateral sides. The ratio of the muscle mass from each side was calculated.\n\nRetrograde labeling of motor and sensory motors\nWT mice underwent retrograde labeling as detailed previously. Briefly, the proximal nerve was transected to expose the axoplasm and placed in a silicone gel (Tyco, Mansfield, MA) well to isolate it. The well was filled with 4% Fluoro-Gold in 0.9% saline to immerse the nerve and label it for 60 mins. The dye was then removed, wound irrigated with saline, and the incision closed in 2 layers as before. After 7 days, the animals were euthanized, and the lumbar region of the spinal cord, and L4 DRG was removed and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After 24 hours, tissues were then placed in 30% sucrose until frozen in OCT Compound (VWR) and cut into 30 \u03bcm thick longitudinal sections on a cryostat (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL). Tissue was then additionally stained for IL-4R using immunohistochemistry methods as detailed previously. Images were captured using an Olympus IX81 microscope with CCD camera and appropriate fluorescent filters.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism V8. Each culture well was treated as an \u2018n\u2019. Each animal was considered an \u2018n\u2019 value. All data were compiled as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Data were tested for normality using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Student\u2019s t test was performed for analysis between 2 groups, while ANOVA with multiple comparison was performed for analysis of 3 or more groups using Sidak correction. Parametric test was used for all statistical analysis. A significance level of p < 0.05 was used in all statistical tests performed."

    "Methods": "Animals\nExperiments were conducted on 79 adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats (11-12 weeks of age, initial body weight ~350 g, Colony 217, ENVIGO) housed in a temperature and light-controlled environment (12-hour light/dark cycles) with food and water\nad libitum\n. All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Florida. Eight weeks after C2 hemisection surgery (C2Hx), rats were randomly assigned to groups and exposed to 28 consecutive days of: 1) normoxia (Nx28); 2) daily AIH (dAIH28), 3) mild CIH (IH28-5/5); and 3) moderate CIH (IH28-2/2). Experimental groups were: 1) intact+Nx28 (n=8); 2) intact+dAIH28 (n=10); 3 intact+IH28-5/5 (n=10); 4) intact+IH28-2/2 (n=10); 5) C2Hx+Nx28 (n=9); 6) C2Hx+dAIH28 (n=8); 7) C2Hx+IH28-5/5 (n=12); and 8) C2Hx+IH28-2/2 (n=12). Procedures used here were the same as described earlier (\nCiesla et al., 2021\n), with the exceptions of the specific tissues studied and details of the analytical procedures.\n\nCervical hemisection (C2Hx)\nAnesthesia, C2Hx and follow-up animal care were performed as previously described (\nFuller et al., 2008\n;\nGonzalez-Rothi et al., 2015\n). Briefly, anesthesia was induced with 3.5% isoflurane (in 100% O2) and maintained at 2-2.5% isoflurane (in 100% O2) via a nose cone throughout surgery; anesthetic depth was verified by the absence of toe pinch and palpebral responses. Body temperature was maintained at 36.5\u201337.5\u00b0C with a water heating pad. Artificial tears (Rugby, NDC 0536-1086-91) were applied. Nails were clipped from forelimbs and hind limbs to minimize scratching injuries. The surgical site was shaved and cleaned (chlorhexidine scrub, 58829-140-01, First Priority, Inc., Elgin, IL), and the C2 cervical spinal laminae exposed by making a dorsal incision on the neck and dissecting the muscles. Following C2 laminectomy and durotomy, the left C2 spinal cord was hemisected caudal to the C2 dorsal roots with a micro-knife . A gap (~1 mm) at the hemisection site was created by aspiration. At this time, C2Hx visualization showed anatomically complete lesions (absent white and gray matter from the left lateral edge to the spinal midline). The dura was closed (9-0 ethilon nylon suture), the overlaying muscles were sutured with 3-0 Polysorb absorbable suture, and skin was closed with 9mm stainless steel wound clips. Each rat received post-operative care including pain management (buprenorphine, 0.03 mg/kg, s.c., Hospira, IL; and meloxicam, 2 mg/kg, s.q. Portland, ME) given at 12 hour intervals for 2 days post-surgery. Rats received lactated Ringer\u2019s solution (5 ml 2x/day, s.q.) and were fed manually with a nutritional supplement (Diet Gel Boost; Clear H\n2\nO; Westbrook, ME) until volitional drinking and eating was once again adequate.\n\nIntermittent Hypoxia Protocols\nIntermittent hypoxia protocols used in this study were described previously (\nCiesla et al., 2021\n;\nGonzalez-Rothi et al., 2021\n). Each gas mixture was delivered by to the rat\u2019s home cage via programmable mass flow controllers; the mass flow controller system mixed gases as needed to achieve the desired oxygen concentrations at a constant flow (Therapeutiq, Kansas City, MO; cage volume = 4.5 L; total gas flow rate = 16 L/min per cage). Rats were housed in their cages during the course of exposures (28 days) with free access to food and water, starting 8 weeks post-C2Hx. Intermittent hypoxia protocols were administered during the light (rest) phase. Gases were filtered for microparticles and bacteria using high purity compressed air-filters (Parker-Hannifin, Cleveland, OH) and humidified to ~30-50% relative humidity with Nafion Fuel Cell Humidifiers (PermaPure, Lakewood, NJ) connected to a circulating water bath. The normoxia group received continuous gas flow of 21% O2 for 8-hrs per day. Rats assigned to the daily AIH (dAIH28) groups received 10, 5-min episodes of 10.5% O2, alternating with 5-min normoxic intervals, for a total of 1.5-hrs/day between 8 and 10 am. Rats assigned to IH28-5/5 groups received 5-min episodes of 10.5% O2 with 5-min normoxic intervals for a total of 8-hrs/day (6 hypoxic episodes per hour for 8-hrs, 48 episodes per day) between 8 am and 4 pm each day. The 5-min hypoxia/normoxia protocols results in 6 hypoxic episodes per hour, approximating clinical criteria for mild sleep apnea (\nAmerican Academy of Sleep Medicine, 1999\n;\nYoung et al., 2008\n). Rats assigned to IH28-2/2 groups received 2-min episodes of 10.5% O2 with 2-min normoxic intervals for a total duration of 8-hrs/day (8-hrs; 120 episodes per day), between 8 am and 4 pm. This protocol results in 15 hypoxic episodes per hour, equivalent to clinical diagnostic criteria for moderate sleep apnea (\nAmerican Academy of Sleep Medicine, 1999\n;\nYoung et al., 2008\n).\n\nTissue Histology and Analysis\nThe day after the final intermittent hypoxia or sham normoxia exposure, rats were perfused intracardially during the light phase with cold 0.1M phosphate buffer saline (PBS), followed by paraformaldehyde (4% paraformaldehyde w/v in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.4). Brainstems and spinal cords were harvested, post-fixed overnight in paraformaldehyde (4% paraformaldehyde w/v in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.4) and cryoprotected at 4\u00b0C in 20% sucrose solution in 0.1M PBS for 3 days, followed by 30% sucrose solution in 0.1M PBS for 3 days.\nIn addition to visual confirmation of the completeness of C2Hx at the time of injury, we further verified C2Hx completeness via histochemistry on fixed tissues. Paraffin-embedded cervical spinal segments (C1-C3) were cut in 7 \u03bcm transverse sections, mounted on positively-charged slides (Fisherbrand, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), and dried overnight. Sections were stained with Luxol Fast Blue and cresyl violet. Sections were deparaffinized by heating at 60\u00b0C for 20-min and then submerged 3x in xylene (5-min each time). Sections were rehydrated by graded alcohol (100%-70%) for 2-min each and stained overnight using Luxol Fast Blue (0.1 g Luxol Fast Blue in 100 mL of 95% ethanol and 0.5 mL 10% acetic acid). The following day, tissue sections were rinsed with 95% ethanol for 2-min, and then distilled water for 5-min. Differentiation was achieved by dipping the tissue in 0.5% lithium carbonate and 70% ethanol, then rehydrated with distilled water for 5-min. Tissues were placed in 0.1% cresyl violet for 15-min and rinsed by dipping tissue into distilled water twice. Tissue was dehydrated through graded alcohol (70\u2013100%) for 1-min, cleared in Histoclear twice for 2-min (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) and cover-slipped (Eukitt, Electron Microscope Science, PA). Injury sites were imaged using bright field at 10x zoom (BZ-\u00d7710, Keyence Co., Osaka, Japan). Completeness of C2Hx was verified in all sections by absence of tissue from midline to the lateral border (data not shown).\nBrainstems were sectioned in transverse plane (40 \u03bcm thickness) using a freezing microtome (Leica SM 200R, Buffalo Grove, IL). Sectioned tissues were stored in antifreeze solution at \u221220\u00b0C until processed (30% glycerol, 30% ethylene glycol, 40% 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4). A total of 6 medulla sections were sampled, 6 sections apart (240 \u03bcm between consecutive samples), and stained for serotonin (5-HT) and neurons (NeuN). Free-floating sections were washed with 0.1M PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated in heat induced epitope retrieval (TissuePro, cat#: HIER01-32R) for 30-min at 85\u00b0C. Tissues were washed with 0.1M PBS-Triton (0.1%, pH 7.4) and incubated in a blocking solution (5% normal donkey serum, NDS, GeneTex) in 0.1M PBS-Triton (0.1%, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 60-min. Primary antibody staining was performed by incubating tissue sections in 5% NDS in 0.1M PBS-Triton (0.1%, pH 7.4) with anti-5-HT (1/2000, rabbit serum, Immunostar #20080) and anti-NeuN (1/500, mouse serum, Millipore MAB377) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Tissues without primary antibody were also incubated overnight as controls. Tissue sections were washed with 0.1M PBS-Triton (0.1%, pH 7.4) the next day. Secondary antibody staining was performed by incubating sections in 5% NDS in 0.1M PBS-Triton (0.1%, pH 7.4) with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor\u00ae 594 (donkey anti-rabbit 594; 1:500, Invitrogen, Ref#A11055) and Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 (donkey anti-mouse 488; 1/500, Invitrogen, Ref#A21202) in a dark box at room temperature for 2-hrs. Tissues without secondary antibody were also incubated as controls. We identified antibody binding in the caudal raphe nuclei as a positive control to verify antibody specificity. Sections were washed with 0.1M PBS-Triton (0.1%, pH 7.4), mounted on positively charged slides (Fisherbrand, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and allowed to dry overnight. Slides were cover-slipped with VectaShield Antifade Hard Set Mounting Medium (Cat#:H-1400). Since immunohistochemical identification of serotonin can be affected by tissue fixation (\nClements and Beitz, 1985\n), and the 5HT antibody used in this study detects antigen 5HT conjugated with paraformaldehyde, all rats were perfused under comparable conditions (4% paraformaldehyde in 1x PBS solution).\n\nImage Acquisition\nAll immunofluorescently labeled tissue sections (transverse, 40 \u03bcm thickness) were imaged using an epifluorescent microscope with 20x magnification using the sectioning module with a 2D pinhole setting of 6, resulting in clear, high-resolution \u201cconfocal-like\u201d images. (Keyence BZ-X700, Keyence Corporation of America, Itasca, IL). No black balance or binning was performed. We optimized our acquisition parameters such that the background intensities are ~5% of the dynamic range with minimal (<0.1%) saturation for the positively labeled areas. A Texas Red filter was used for 5-HT (OP-87765) and a GFP filter was used for NeuN (OP-87763). Exposure times of 1/60 seconds for 5-HT and 1/2.3 seconds for NeuN were used for imaging serotonin immunofluorescence around hypoglossal neurons. One image was taken on the left side (ipsilateral) and one on the right side (contralateral) resulting in two images per tissue section and ~12 total images per animal (~6 left, ~6 right). Medullas were marked prior to tissue sectioning to ensure accurate side determination during imaging and analyses.\n\nSerotonin Immunofluorescence Analysis\nSerotonin immunofluorescence was quantified in each image using a custom MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) code as described previously (\nCiesla et al., 2021\n). Local background intensities within each image were calculated using a running-window median filter and were subtracted from the raw pixel intensities to obtain the background-subtracted intensities. We performed our analyses on the background-subtracted intensities. Images were binarized using a custom adaptive threshold algorithm in MATLAB as previously described (\nAllen et al., 2019\n;\nCiesla et al., 2021\n;\nSeven et al., 2018\n). An adaptive threshold was calculated by constructing a pixel intensity histogram from the image. Pixel intensity above a fixed percentile across all groups was selected as the threshold to account for animal-to-animal and image-to-image differences in signal and background intensities. The images were binarized using the automated algorithm to identify the serotonin-positive areas. Two investigators compared the identified serotonin structures with the original image to ensure the accuracy of identification. Automatically identified structures significantly matched investigator-based analysis. Investigators remained blinded to injury status and intermittent hypoxia exposure protocol throughout analyses.\nRegions containing NeuN labeled XII motor neurons were selected for analysis based on their size and well-known anatomical location (\nKrammer et al., 1979\n;\nPaxinos and Watson, 1998\n). The MATLAB code first displayed green to identify motor neurons. A region of interest was selected, outlining the hypoglossal motor pool based on medulla level in reference to the obex, central canal and 4\nth\nventricle, creating a polygon shape that encompassed all observed NeuN positive hypoglossal neurons >19 \u03bcm in diameter (\nMcClung and Goldberg, 1999\n;\nRukhadze et al., 2010\n). MATLAB code was then used to identify serotonin immunopositive pixels within this region of interest. In this report, we define the caudal XII nucleus as the region containing XII motor neurons from obex to 1.6 mm rostral to obex. The hypoglossal column is defined by all hypoglossal neurons, including pre-hypoglossal neurons, from obex to 3.5 mm rostral to obex. We report serotonergic innervation of both regions but emphasize the caudal hypoglossal nuclei in this paper since this region contains the motor neurons most involved in maintaining upper airway patency (e.g. genioglossus;\nCori et al., 2018\n;\nKrammer et al., 1979\n).\nWe observed serotonin-immunopositive boutons (i.e. varicosities) and fibers. Since this analysis cannot differentiate between serotonin boutons\nversus\nfibers, we identified \u201cserotonin structures,\u201d defined as independent serotonin positive regions larger than 4 contiguous pixels; each structure was separated by at least 1 pixel. Using these definitions, we quantified: 1) structure number, 2) area per structure, 3) total immunopositive area, and 4) staining intensity per structure (based on fluorescence intensity).\nThe number of structures was determined by counting the number of immuno-positive serotonin structures per tissue section and averaging the number of immunolabeled structures per rat. The area per structure was determined by the number of contiguous pixels defining each structure. Pixel numbers were multiplied by the aspect ratio of pixel per micron (pixel dimensions: 0.377 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.377 \u03bcm) to determine the area per structure using a representative image from each tissue section, and then averaged to obtain the average area of each immunolabeled structure per rat. The total area of serotonin-positive immunolabeling was calculated by multiplying the structure number by area per structure in a representative image from each tissue section, and then averaged to obtain total serotonin immunolabeling area within the XII motor nucleus per rat. Although we do report staining intensity per structure, we acknowledge limitations in making inferences about serotonin concentration based on these measurements (\nFritschy, 2008\n;\nMatos et al., 2010\n). The fluorescence intensity of each immunolabeled structure was determined within a representative image from each tissue section and averaged per rat. All intensity measurements were normalized to the maximum possible intensity (i.e. 65536).\n\nStatistics\nStatistical inferences were made using JMP 11.0 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All computed values were first averaged within the image to obtain a value for the image. Then, image values were averaged for each animal, which was used for statistical calculations. Serotonin immunofluorescence was analyzed using a mixed model with a repeated measures design. Independent variables were intermittent hypoxia protocol (Nx28, dAIH28, IH28-5/5, IH28-2/2), injury (intact vs. C2Hx), and side relative to injury (ipsilateral vs. contralateral as a repeated measure). Due to the large number of comparisons within the mixed model, we were concerned that significance would be hidden within intact and C2Hx groups. To avoid type 2 statistical errors, the intact and C2Hx groups were analyzed separately. In uninjured rats, we averaged left and right sides and ran a one-way ANOVA with intermittent hypoxia protocol as the independent variable. In C2Hx groups, we ran a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with the independent variables being intermittent hypoxia protocol (Nx28, dAIH28, IH28-5/5, and IH28-2/2) and side (ipsilateral vs. contralateral as a repeated measure).\nIn the results, we report significant interactions for each for each outcome measure for serotonin immunofluorescence at the XII motor nucleus. A significance level of 0.05 was set for all statistical comparisons. p-values, F ration, and degrees of freedom (DF) are reported for Mixed Models. When significant differences were observed, individual comparisons were made with Fisher Least Significance Difference (LSD)\npost hoc\ntests. All data are displayed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean."

    "Methods": "Animals and Treatments\nAll animals were performed in accordance with Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8\nth\nedition). The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Michigan approved the use of animals. Mice were fed a standard diet of 5L0D LabDiet chow and received water ad libitum. All mice were generated on C57BL/6N background, including global and cell specific knockouts. All Acod1 global and cell specific knockout mice were acquired from the lab of Dr. Michael Diamond located at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.\n18\nGlobal Acod1 knockout and flox Acod1 mice were generated as described previously.\n18\nMyeloid specific Acod1 knockout (MyAcod1KO: Acod1\nfl/fl\n-LysMCre), microglia specific Acod1 knockout (MicAcod1KO: Acod1\nfl/fl\n- CX3CR1Cre-ERT2), endothelial specific Acod1 knockout (ECAcod1KO: Acod1\nfl/fl\n- Cdh5(PAC)Cre-ERT2) were generated by crossing floxed Acod1 mice with the indicated Cre lines. Littermate floxed control mice were used as controls in all experiments. For CX3CR1Cre-ERT2 experiments, mice were weighed and received two administrations of 300mg/kg tamoxifen via I.P. with one day separating injections. Experiments were then performed on tamoxifen treated CX3CR1Cre-ERT2 mice six weeks following end of tamoxifen treatment. Cdh5(PAC)Cre-ERT2 mice received 40mg/kg tamoxifen via I.P. for three consecutive days.\n19\nExperiments were then performed on tamoxifen treated mice four weeks following end of tamoxifen treatment.\n\nMiddle cerebral artery occlusion\nTransient, 90-min MCAo was performed as described previously.\n10\n,\n20\nAnesthesia was induced in mice with isoflurane (5% induction, 1.5% maintenance). Core body temperature was measured via rectal probe and maintained at 37\u00b0C with a temperature-controlled heating pad. Following anesthesia, a 8mm midline incision was made along the neck to expose the right carotid artery. Ligation of the external carotid artery was performed and a 10mm long 6\u20130 silicon rubber coated nylon monofilament (#602156, Doccol Corp., CA) was placed into the external carotid stump. The filament was then advanced into the internal carotid artery. Blood flow was measured via laser Doppler flowmetry (Transonic BLF22) before and during filament insertion. Occlusion was defined as a reduction in cerebral tissue perfusion at a level <20% compared to original baseline. The filament remained in the internal carotid for 90 minutes of ischemia and removed, mice were then allowed to recover and reperfusion to occur.\n\nInfarct volume measurement\nFollowing 24 hours of reperfusion (post-filament removal), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure infarct size following MCA occlusion. Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and laid prone throughout MRI examination. A 7.0T Varian Unity Inova MR scanner (183-mm horizontal bore; Varin, Palo Alto, CA) was used for MRI analysis and mice were maintained at 37\u00b0C via forced heated air. A double tuned volume radiofrequency coil was used to scan the head region of the mice. A fast spin echo sequence was used to acquire T2 weighted images set to the flowing parameters: repetition time/effective echo time- 4000/60 ms; echo spacing- 15 ms; number of echoes- 8; field of view- 20\u00d720 mm; matrix- 256\u00d7128; slice thickness- 0.5mm; number of slices- 25; and number of scans- 1 (total scan time of 2.5 minutes). ImageJ software provided by NIH was used to analyze and measure infarcts by a blinded observer. Infarct volumes were corrected to account to brain swelling.\nTo measure T2 lesion volume, the following equation was used to correct for edema: TV-((CV+(IV-LV)x((TV/2)/CV)).\n21\nWhere TV is total combined volume in both brain hemispheres, CV is contralateral volume, IV is ipsilateral volume, and LV is total measured lesion volume.\n\nGeneration and treatment of BMDMs\nMice were euthanized via CO\n2\nchamber and death was verified with cervical dislocation. Femur and tibia were removed from mice to flush bone marrow cells with 5ml RPMI 1640 media (Gibco) through a 27g needle and strained using a 100\u03bcm filter. Cell suspension was then centrifuged at 1250 RPM for 10 minutes to pellet cells. Supernatant was decanted and replaced with fresh BMDM differentiation media (RPMI 1640 + 30% L929 supernatant + 10% FBS + glutamax (Gibco) + penicillin streptomycin). BMDMs were allowed to differentiate for a total of 6 days with media replacement at day 4. Differentiated macrophage cells were plated at 5\u00d710\n5\ncells in 24-well plates. In all experiments differentiated BMDMs were treated with 100 ng/ml LPS for the designated amount of time prior to collection for analysis.\n\nBV-2 culture\nBV-2 cell cultures were grown and maintained on RPMI supplemented with 5% FBS. Cells were maintained in 75cm\n2\nflask and passaged every 2\u20133 days once 90% confluency was reached. Cells were plated at 1 \u00d7 10\n6\ncells/well in 24 well plates. BV-2 cells were pretreated with 2mM itaconate for 14 hours followed with 100 ng/ml LPS for 3 hours.\n\nFlow Cytometry\nValidation of CX3CR1 was performed using 8-week-old male tdtomato flox mice expressing CX3CR1-CRE. Mice received two administrations of 300mg/kg tamoxifen via I.P. with one day separating injections. Six weeks following tamoxifen treatment mice were euthanized, brains were removed and homogenized. Total cell suspension was incubated in Fc Block for 10 minutes. Cells were then stained on ice for 1 hour with the following antibodies: PE anti-mouse CD45 (BioLegend, cat # 103106), and CX3CR1 (BioLegend, cat # 149021). Once staining was completed cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 0.1% paraformaldehyde. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACSCanto II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with three lasers (405-nm violet laser, 488-nm blue laser, and 640-nm red laser) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Treestar). Unstained andisotype controls were used for flow analysis.\n\nmRNA gene expression analysis\nRelative mRNA expression was measured using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent. For in vitro experiments, media was removed from plates and TRIzol was immediately added. For in vivo experiments, brain tissue samples were homogenized in TRIzol. RNA was purified in RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) with an on column DNase digestion. 1ug of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA with an Applied Biosystems kit and qPCR was performed using a 7900HT fast real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The ribosomal housekeeping gene L32 was used to normalize all data and quantify relative RNA expression.\n\nImmunoblot analysis\nCultured bone marrow macrophages were treated with 100ng/ml LPS for 6 hours to allow for sufficient increases in Acod1 mRNA levels, and subsequent Acod1 protein accumulation. Cultured cell protein was isolated by direct lysis using RIPA buffer (Sigma). Protein was quantified using Peirce BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Ref 23227) and appropriate volume of protein sample was added to produce 40ug in 5x laemmli buffer with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were ran through SDS-page gels (Biorad, #3450027) for 50 minutes at 150V and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using wet transfer. Transferred membranes were then blocked in 5% dried milk in TBS-Tween for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. Primary antibody was then added at 1:1000 (Anti-IRG1, Abcam ab222411) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Secondary antibody was added for 90 minutes at room temperature. Visualization of bands was performed using chemiluminescent substrate (ThermoFisher scientific, Ref 34577) and imaged on Biorad systems.\n\nStatistical analysis\nA Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to determine if data were normally distributed. For normally distributed data with equal variance, statistical comparison of mean values between groups was performed with the Student t test or by a two-way ANOVA with a \u0160\u00edd\u00e1k correction for multiple comparisons, and values are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. All statistical analysis of data was performed in GraphPad Prism (version 6; GraphPad Software, Inc). P < 0.05 was considered significant."
