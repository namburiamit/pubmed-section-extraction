    "Methods": "2.1. Subjects\nSprague Dawley rats (Charles River, UK) were housed under standard conditions on a 14\u00a0h:10\u00a0h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. All experiments were conducted under UK Home Office personal and project licences in accordance with the requirements of the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and with the approval of the local Cardiff University Ethics Review Committee. Every effort was made to minimise the number of animals used and their suffering.\n\n2.2. Experimental design\nTo test our hypothesis, female rats were unilaterally lesioned with the selective catecholamine neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the nigrostriatal pathway and the lesions confirmed with amphetamine-induced rotations at 4\u00a0weeks post-lesion. Prior to transplantation, rats were separated into 8 balanced groups based on rotation performance [see\nTable 1\n; Group, F\n(7,28)\n=\u00a00.03, n.s.]. All transplants were made on the dopamine-depleted side of the brain. To reduce the number of animals used in the experiment each animal received 2 grafts implanted into widely separated sites in the denervated hemisphere, with the first transplant into either dSTR or N.Acc and the second transplant into either prefrontal cortex (PFC) or hippocampus (HPC). Efficacy of the grafts was confirmed with amphetamine-induced rotation tests at 4 and 6\u00a0weeks post-graft. Following the final rotation test animals were perfused and brain tissue taken for histological analysis.\nTable 1.\nGroup allocation for transplantation.\nAnimals were distributed in 8 balanced groups based on the number of amphetamine-induced net ipsilateral rotations following 6-OHDA lesion.

Medial forebrain bundle lesions\nAll surgeries were performed in a Kopf stereotaxic frame where anaesthesia was maintained at 2\u20133% Isoflurane (AbbVie Ltd., Maidenhead, UK) in a 2:1 mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide. For the unilateral nigrostriatal lesion, rats received an intra-cerebral injection of 6-OHDA neurotoxin into the right medial forebrain bundle following a recently refined protocol (\nTorres et al., 2011\n). Each animal was injected with 12\u00a0\u03bcg (free-base) of 6-OHDA hydrobromide (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) in 3\u00a0\u03bcl of 0.025% ascorbate saline at the following stereotaxic coordinates: \u2212\u00a04.0\u00a0mm caudal from bregma (AP); \u2212\u00a01.3\u00a0mm lateral from the midline (ML); \u2212\u00a07.0\u00a0mm deep from dura (DV).\n\n2.4. Procurement of embryonic ventral mesencephalic cells\nPregnant dams were bred in-house following a previously established protocol (\nWeyrauch et al., 2009\n). Briefly, females in oestrus were established by the vaginal lavage method on the morning of breeding day. Eligible females were paired with a male at 1:1 ratio in the male's home cage for a maximum of 3\u00a0h, typically between 10:30\u00a0a.m. and 1:30\u00a0p.m. Females then returned to their home cages and the day of mating was recorded as E0. At 10\u00a0a.m. on the morning of E12, rats were lightly anaesthetised in an induction chamber with 2\u20133% Isoflurane in oxygen and the pregnancy was confirmed if palpation of the abdomen revealed several swellings in the uterine horns. Embryos were harvested straight away if the desired embryonic age was E12, alternatively pregnant dams returned to their home cages until E14. The short mating-period protocol used here produced embryos with a crown-rump length (CRL) of 6.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0mm at E12 and 11.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0mm at E14 (CRL reported as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation).\nThe VM tissue was harvested from three E12 and two E14 litters and dissected from each embryo according to a standard protocol (\nDunnett and Bj\u00f6rklund, 1992\n). VMs from all donors in the same litter were pooled together and quasi-singe cell suspensions were prepared as previously described (\nTorres et al., 2007\n). The viability for each sample was determined to be >\u00a095% using Trypan Blue exclusion criteria. For transplantation, the VM cells were re-suspended in a sufficient volume of Dulbecco's minimum Eagle Medium F-12 (Gibco, Paisley, UK) containing 0.05% DNAse (deoxyribonuclease I from bovine pancreas, Sigma-Aldrich) to obtain the required concentration of 1/2 VM per 2\u00a0\u03bcl and stored on ice during surgery.\n\n2.5. Transplantation\nSix weeks post-lesion, each animal was transplanted with the number of cells equivalent to 1/2 VM, rather than with a fixed number of cells, to allow a comparison to be made between grafts of similar potential at the different donor ages. Thus, each rat received grafts into 2 designated sites, each graft containing approximately 55,000 cells in E12 group or 250,000 cells in E14 group. Overall, a total of 9 animals received grafts of each donor age transplanted into each cerebral target. Stereotaxic co-ordinates were as follows:\ndSTR\nAP: +\u00a00.6\u00a0mm, ML: \u2212\u00a03.0\u00a0mm, DV: \u2212\u00a05.0 & \u2212\u00a04.5\u00a0mm;\nN.Acc\nAP: +\u00a01.6\u00a0mm, ML: \u2212\u00a01.5\u00a0mm, DV: \u2212\u00a07.5 & \u2212\u00a07\u00a0mm;\nPFC\nAP: +\u00a04.7\u00a0mm, ML: \u2212\u00a02.0\u00a0mm, DV: \u2212\u00a01.9 & \u2212\u00a01.4\u00a0mm;\nHPC\nAP: \u2212\u00a05.2\u00a0mm, ML: \u2212\u00a05.2\u00a0mm, DV: \u2212\u00a05.4 & \u2212\u00a04.9\u00a0mm (\nPaxinos and Watson, 2003\n). Cells were transplanted in a single track at 2 depths 0.5\u00a0mm apart. The cell suspension was injected into the brain at a rate of 1\u00a0\u03bcl/min over 2\u00a0min using the same set up as for the 6-OHDA lesion surgery. After the first minute, the cannula was raised 0.5\u00a0mm and the second half of cells was injected at the new depth. The cannula was left in place for 3\u00a0min after the injection before being withdrawn to prevent drawback of the cells up the needle track.\n\n2.6. Behavioural testing\nThe extent of dopamine depletion in the striatum was evaluated 4\u00a0weeks post-lesion based on the drug-induced rotational behaviour. Amphetamine (Methamphetamine hydrochloride, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in sterile saline at 2.5\u00a0mg/ml and administered via i.p. injection at a dose of 1\u00a0ml/kg, immediately prior to testing. The animals were placed in 30\u00a0cm diameter round bottomed bowls housed in 50\u00a0cm high perspex cylinders and harnessed to an automated rotometer system (Rotomax System, AccuScan Instruments Inc., Columbus, USA) following a previously established protocol (\nUngerstedt and Arbuthnott, 1970\n). Grafted rats were tested 4 and 6\u00a0weeks post-transplantation using the same method. Drug-induced rotation tests were performed blind to the treatment of the animals. The collected data are reported as the net number of rotations (ipsilateral minus contralateral) over the full 90\u00a0min session.\n\n2.7. Perfusion\nSix weeks post-graft, rats were terminally anaesthetised with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (Euthatal, Merial, UK) and transcardially perfused with 0.1\u00a0M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 1.5% w/v paraformaldehyde (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) in 0.1\u00a0M PBS. The brains were post-fixed in the same fixative solution overnight before being transferred into a solution of 25% sucrose in PBS. After equilibration in the sucrose solution, 40\u00a0\u03bcm thick coronal sections through the brain were cut on a Leica freezing stage sledge microtome and collected in 1:6 series.\n\n2.8. Immunohistochemistry\nAll bright-field and fluorescent immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on free floating sections on an automated shaker. The tissue was first incubated for 1\u00a0h in a blocking solution of 3% normal horse serum (NHS, Gibco) before being bathed in primary antibody with 1% NHS overnight at room temperature. The next day, the sections were incubated in secondary antibody (1:200) solution with 1% NHS for 3\u00a0h, washed, and then immersed in Vectastain Elite ABC (Vector Laboratories Ltd., Peterborough, UK) solution for 2\u00a0h prior to being stained with DAB (diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride hydrate, Sigma-Aldrich). The primary antibodies and dilution factors used in either bright-field or fluorescent IHC were as follows: mouse anti-NeuN (1:1000; Millipore, Feltham, UK), rabbit anti-TH (1:2000; Millipore), mouse anti-TH (1:1000; Millipore), rabbit anti-Girk2 (1:250; Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel), and mouse anti-Calbindin (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich). All Alexa fluorescent secondary antibodies were used at 1:200 dilution.\n\n2.9. Quantification and microscopy\nAll quantifications of cell populations in the grafts were performed blind to the experimental condition. Neuron quantification in the grafts from NeuN stained sections was carried out on an automated stereology microscope (Olympus BX50) at \u00d7\u00a0100 magnification using image analysis C.A.S.T. \u2013 grid software version 1.6 (Olympus, Ballerup, Denmark). The area of the graft was outlined by the user and the software set up randomised statistical sampling within the defined area so that at 150\u2013200 cells per animal were counted from at least 200 sampling fields. Sampling parameters, i.e. area of the sampling frame (285\u00a0\u03bcm\n2\n) and step size between the samples, were held constant for all animals in each experiment. Total cell counts in the grafts for each staining were estimated using the Abercrombie correction formula (\nAbercrombie, 1946\n). To assess the extent of 6-OHDA lesions, numbers of TH-ir cells were counted at \u00d7\u00a010 magnification on the side ipsilateral and contralateral to the lesion in one midbrain section at the level of the medial terminal nucleus of the accessory nucleus of the optic tract as an anatomical landmark to distinguish cells in the VTA and SNpc (\nDowd and Dunnett, 2004\n).\nTo quantify cells labelled with fluorochromes, pictures of all sections containing the graft were taken on a Zeiss Image Z2 microscope equipped with the imaging system ApoTome (Oberkochen, Germany) to generate deblurred optical sections of fluorescence samples at \u00d7\u00a010 magnification and single- and double-labelled cells were counted in Adobe Photoshop CS5 software (Adobe Systems Inc., California, USA). Using a grid generated in Photoshop as a reference, constant-size sampling field was selected from the widest area of the graft and the distribution of Girk2-ir/TH-ir and Calbindin-ir/TH-ir neurons within the graft was analysed by counting cells in the fields sampled from either the periphery (25% width of the graft from each side) or the centre (50%) of the graft and grouping them accordingly for statistical analysis.\n\n2.10. Statistical analysis\nAll data are expressed as group mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analyses were performed in SPSS Statistics 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, USA). A general linear model (GLM) univariate function was used to perform two- and higher factor analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to analyse data from IHC staining. A four-way ANOVA with repeated measures was used to analyse behavioural data from drug-induced rotation tests. This analysis was performed orthogonally, treating grafts in the dSTR or N.Acc as the primary graft and grafts in the PFC or HPC as the secondary graft, to investigate whether PFC or HPC subgroups differed in either dSTR or N.Acc groups. Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used to reveal significant differences between individual groups and results were considered to be significant if p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 (*), with higher levels of significance (**p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, ***p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) also indicated where appropriate.\nOne grafted rat was transferred from E14 N.Acc group to E14 dSTR group for all analyses after examination of TH-stained brain sections revealed that the first graft was positioned in the dSTR instead of N.Acc. Furthermore, 3 of 18 animals in the PFC and 1 of 18 in the HPC groups were missing grafts. This was most likely because cells were injected into either a subdural or a sub-ventricular space as no trace of cells was found in the target or adjacent brain regions. The resulting numbers of grafts in each group used in further analyses were as follows: dSTR \u2013 9 E12 and 10 E14 grafts, N.Acc \u2013 9 E12 and 8 E14 grafts, PFC \u2013 8 E12 and 7 E14 grafts, HPC \u2013 9 E12 and 8 E14 grafts."

    "Methods": "Animal Care and Anesthesia\nAll procedures and protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. All animal care complied with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (U.S. National Research Council, 1996) and followed the ARRIVE Guidelines. Female Yorkshire swine (n=19) with an average weight of 22.5 kg were utilized in this study. No special diets were provided as the animals were housed indoors with feed and water,\nad libitum\n. The housing facility was accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Prior to the injury procedure, animals were fasted for 18\u201320 hours with water remaining\nad libitum\n. After induction with a cocktail of ketamine (20\u201330mg/kg; Hospira, 0409-2051-05) and midazolam (0.4\u20130.6mg/kg; Hospira, 0409-2596-05), anesthesia was provided with 5% isoflurane (Piramal, 66794-013-25) via a snout mask and glycopyrrolate was given (0.01 mg/kg; West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp., 0143-9682-25) subcutaneously. The animal was then intubated, and isoflurane was connected at maintenance levels (1.5\u20132.0%). Eye lubricant was used to minimize drying. Physiological monitoring allowed titration of anesthesia so that SpO2, heart rate, and respirations were within acceptable ranges (97\u2013100% SpO2, HR between 110\u2013130, and respirations between 9\u201312 breaths per minute, respectively).\n\nDelivery of Lucifer Yellow via Intracerebroventicular Injections\nLY (Invitrogen, L453, Carlsbad, CA) was delivered into the lateral ventricles of all animals before the rotational/sham injury to demarcate cells permeabilized during the rotational injury. This aldehyde-fixable, normally cell-impermeable dye was delivered via a Hamilton syringe (Reno, NV). Animals were placed in a stereotactic head frame. The scalp was shaved and swabbed with betadine before a 4 cm incision was made. The scalp was reflected from the skull in order to visualize Bregma. Two 5 mm craniectomies were made at the following stereotactic co-ordinates: 1.0 mm posterior to Bregma, \u00b1 6.0 mm lateral. A small incision in the dura was made with a 19-gauge needle. For each site in serial fashion, a sterile Hamilton syringe was lowered 18.0 mm from the surface of the dura mater to access the ventricles. Tissue was left to stabilize for 2 minutes before delivering 500 \u03bcL of LY (0.4mg/kg in sterile saline) over a period of 10 minutes on each side using an UltraMicroPump III (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The needle was slowly withdrawn at a rate of 2 mm/minute, and the burr holes were sealed with bone wax. The incision site was sutured with 0-0 sutures, and the area was swabbed with betadine. A surgical plane of anesthesia was maintained through the injury/sham procedure and sacrifice. The injury occurred 2 hours after the start of the first injection, which was optimized to allow even LY distribution throughout the interstitial tissue.\n\nPorcine Closed-Head Rotational/Inertial TBI\nClosed-head rotational TBI was induced under anesthesia using the HYGE pneumatic actuator, a device capable of producing pure impulsive non-impact head rotation with a controlled relationship between maximum rotational acceleration and injury severity, as previously described (\nBrowne et al., 2011\n;\nCullen et al., 2016\n;\nSmith et al., 2000\n,\n1997\n). The well-characterized model rapidly accelerates the head and induces inertial forces representative of human TBI from falls, collisions, or blunt impacts. Angular velocity was recorded using a magneto-hydrodynamic sensor (Applied Technology Associates, Albuquerque, NM) connected to a National Instruments DAQ, controlled by LabVIEW. Briefly, the animal was randomly assigned to an injury group and the animal\u2019s head was secured to a padded bite plate under anesthesia, and mounted to the HYGE device. In the miniature pigs, sagittal plane head accelerations (transverse to the brainstem) cause an enhancement of strain in the brainstem region compared to coronal plane accelerations (circumferential to the brainstem), therefore reduced levels of angular velocity/acceleration are required to elicit loss of consciousness and coma (\nBrowne et al., 2011\n;\nCullen et al., 2016\n;\nMeaney et al., 1995\n;\nSmith et al., 2000\n,\n1997\n). Therefore, to induce a \u201cmild\u201d injury phenotype, single rapid head rotation was performed in the coronal plane (peak angular velocities of 193\u2013299 radians/second; n=7), whereas to induce a moderate-to-severe injury phenotype rotation occurred in the sagittal plane (peak angular velocities: 80\u2013139 rad/s; n=5). In prior studies, it was empirically determined that head rotation at these levels of angular velocity/acceleration in the coronal plane did not induce measurable loss of consciousness or hematoma. However, head rotation at these levels of angular velocity/acceleration in the sagittal plane induced prolonged loss of consciousness and often significant hematoma (\nCullen et al., 2016\n). In addition to the single injuries, we performed repetitive injuries on a small cohort of animals in both the sagittal and coronal planes. Repetitive head rotation was either performed on the same day (separated by 15 minutes) or separated by 7 days; these animals only received LY intracerebroventicular injection on the day of their second injury (n=4 total). Sham animals received all other procedures absent head rotation (n=3).\n\nBrain Tissue Acquisition and Processing\nAll animals were sacrificed within 15 minutes of head rotational injury (15 minutes following the second injury for the animals subjected to repeated head rotation). Animals were transcardially perfused using heparinized saline (4\u00b0C, 4 liters) followed by chilled, 4% paraformaldehyde (4\u00b0C, 8\u201310 liters; Sigma, P6148). Brains were blocked in the coronal plane at 5 mm intervals, then cleared in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) and transferred to 30% sucrose until they sunk in the solution. The blocks were placed in OCT, flash frozen, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Twenty-micron thick sections were cut coronally on a cryostat (Leica CM1860).\n\nImmunohistochemistry and Imaging\nFlorescent immunohistochemistry was performed with antibodies against ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1; rabbit IgG 1:300; Wako, 019-19741) or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; rabbit IgG 1:500; Millipore AB5804). Mounted sections were washed in PBS, and blocked in 4% non-specific goat serum with 0.3% Triton-X for 1 hour at room temperature. Slices were incubated with primary antibody in blocking solution overnight at 4\u00b0C. Anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen,\nA31573\n) was applied at a 1:1000 concentration for 2 hours at room temperature in blocking solution. Sections were counterstained with Hoechst (Hoechst 33342, Life Technologies, H3570) or Fluo-Nissl (\nN21479\n, Life Technologies). Sections were preserved with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech) and coverslipped. Immunohistochemical images were acquired with a confocal microscope (Nikon A1RSI Laser Scanning Confocal or Zeiss LSM 710) on the 10\u00d7 or 20\u00d7 objectives.\n\nQuantification of Iba1 Microglia Morphology and Distribution\nWhile all animals in this study were qualitatively evaluated for changes in microglial reactivity, a subset of animals were subjected to in-depth single-cell analyses involving detailed quantitative scoring of microglial distribution and morphology in relation to permeabilized neurons (8,495 total microglia scored across nine animals). An average of 1,000 Iba1-labeled microglia were analyzed within each animal (1,177.5 \u00b1 90.3 cells for injured animals and 476.7 \u00b1 44.9 cells for sham animals) to investigate morphological and density differences in sham (n=3), mild (coronal plane rotation at 207\u2013220 rad/sec; n=3), and severe (sagittal plane rotation at 114\u2013139 rad/sec; n=3) injury animals. Note that the quantitative analyses were performed on animals that experienced a lower rotational velocity/acceleration within the coronal plane (approximating loading levels found to induce concussion in humans based on biomechanical scaling) to generate mild-TBI whereas quantitative analyses were performed on animals that experienced a higher kinematic loading (thus more severe trauma) within the sagittal plane. Images of microglia localized with LY\n+\nneurons and internal control images of microglia not localized with LY\n+\nneurons were generated for quantification. All Iba1\n+\n/Hoechst\n+\nmicroglia were morphologically scored in ImageJ using a straight-line tool to measure the total cell diameter at the widest points and the soma diameter at the widest points. Thereafter, the cell\u2019s total diameter was divided by the soma diameter to generate a ratio where higher ratios represent a ramified, scanning morphology (\nFig. 1A\n) and lower ratios represent a reactive, amoeboid morphology (\nFig. 1B\n). This morphological scoring methodology was inspired by Hovens\net al\n. (2015), which similarly utilized a cell body to cell soma ratio, but for a population of microglia; we adapted this approach to allow single cell analysis. This scoring procedure was subsequently validated against the Hovens\net al\n. morphology scoring method using a linear regression (\nHovens et al., 2014\n) (\nFig. 1D\n) executed in Prism Version 6 for Mac OS X.\nFigure 1. Method associated with microglial (Iba1\n+\n, white) morphology and distribution quantification.\nOpen in a new tab\nCell diameter (orange line) and the soma diameter (green line) were measured with a straight-line tool to generate a morphology score with higher values representing a more ramified morphology and values closer to one representing a more reactive morphology (A\u2013B). To quantify morphology as a function of distance from permeabilized neurons, concentric circles were generated around LY neurons, creating proximal (less than 60\u03bcm), medial (between 60 and 105\u03bcm), and distal (greater than 105\u03bcm) zones of microglia (C). This nascent single cell morphology characterization methodology was compared to an established microglia morphology metric (\nHovens et al., 2014\n) with a linear regression and 95% confidence interval bands in order to validate this new methodology (D; using 11 images each containing 10\u201323 microglia). The linear regression had an R-squared value of 0.7674.\nIn order to determine microglia\u2019s morphology as a function of distance from the nearest LY\n+\nneuron, images of microglia localized with LY\n+\nneurons were binned into three regions: a proximal region, where distance (d) from a permeabilized neuron was less than or equal to 60 \u03bcm; a medial region where 60 < d \u2264 105 \u03bcm; and a distal region where d > 105 \u03bcm from LY\n+\nneurons (\nFig. 1C\n). Bin sizes were chosen so that proximal and medial regions would be approximately four times the width of a microglia soma. Microglia measurements from each region were pooled to determine how distance from the nearest LY\n+\nneuron affected microglia morphology. If microglia were on the boundary of two regions they were grouped in the more proximal zone. Microglia morphology data from\nFigure 5\nis broken down to illustrate individual animal trends in\nSupplementary Figure 2\n. Microglia density as a function of distances was calculated by counting the number of microglia morphology tracings in each region before normalizing to the total area of each respective region. In order to examine the changing trend of microglia density across different regions, relative frequency graphs were smoothed utilizing a second-order smoothing function considering four neighboring points (Prism Version 6;\nFig. 4G\u2013H\n). Subsequent, non-smoothed relative frequency graphs of microglia morphology scores were plotted by region and injury for trend comparisons within each animal (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n). All data is presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean, where mean is calculated based on the number of animals and standard error of the mean was calculated as the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of animals.\nFigure 5. Microglia have more reactive morphologies only in regions localized with LY\n+\nneurons post-TBI.\nOpen in a new tab\nMicrographs of Hoechst\n+\n(blue) and microglia (Iba1\n+\n, white) morphology around LY\n+\nneurons (green; A\u2013H) with enlarged call-out boxes (c\u2013h). Images are taken from sham (A, D), mild (B, E\u2013F), or severe (C, G\u2013H) animals in regions localized with LY\n+\nneurons (B\u2013C, E, G) or regions absent LY\n+\nneurons (F, H). Scale bars = 100\u03bcm (A\u2013H) or scale bars = 25\u03bcm (c\u2013h).

Column graph depicts mean \u00b1 SEM and * denotes p<0.05; ** denotes p<0.01, *** denotes p<0.001, and # is significance relative to the injury-matched non-damaged group (black bars).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nTo achieve approximate normality, the microglia morphology scores and density data were log-transformed.\nA priori\n, it was of interest to determine (1) whether mean microglial morphology or density differed by injury level and (2) whether, for each injury level, mean microglial morphology or density differed between regions. Because there were insufficient animals to formally test for an interaction between injury and regions, we considered these hypotheses separately. For the morphology scores, we fit a linear mixed effects model that included animal as a random effect nested within injury; for the cell density data, which had a more skewed distribution, we used a generalized estimating equation with a Poisson link, and adjusted for the size of the area examined. This modeling/testing procedure is similar to ANOVA but allows repeated measurements on the individual animals (\nFitzmaurice et al., 2004\n). If the density or morphology test on the effect of region or injury achieved significance, we carried out a Bonferroni-Holm post-hoc test to adjust for multiple comparisons and maintain a family-wise error rate of 0.05. We note that analyses of the injury effect contrasted different animals, while analyses of the region effect were based on within-animal contrasts. The within-animal contrast eliminates between-animal variability. Thus smaller mean differences are detectable for the analysis of differences between region, a within-animal contrast, than between injury levels, a between-animal contrast. The type I error rate was set to 0.05 and all hypothesis tests are two-sided. All analyses were carried out in R Studio Version 0.99.896 using R and the\nnlme\n,\ngeepack\n,\ngtools\n, and\ngmodels\npackages (\nThe R Development Core Team, 2016\n)."

    "Methods": "4.1. Animals\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 22), weighing 300\u2013325 g (Harlan), and adult male Vgat-ires-cre and wildtype control (n = 14) mice (\nVong et al., 2011\n), weighing 24\u201328 g were used in this study. Rats and mice were individually housed, with ad libitum access to food and water. All animal care was in accordance with National Institutes of Health standards, and all procedures used were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n4.2. Animal surgery and EEG/EMG implantation\nAnimal surgeries and injections were performed as described previously (\nAnaclet et al., 2012\n). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) (Med-Vet) and placed into a stereotaxic frame. After exposing the cranium for measurement of coordinates relative to bregma, a burr hole was made for injection. Injections were made as previously described (\nFuller et al., 2011\n). Briefly, all injections were used using a fine glass pipette and compressed air system that slowly delivers injections using small air puffs over 5 min. After the injection, the pipette was left in place for 5 min, then retracted. For lesions in rats, we injected 120 nL of a 1:1 admixture of an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector expressing Cre-recombinase under the cytomegalovirus promoter (Cre-AAV, serotype 10) and an AAV expressing the cytotoxic Subunit A of Diptheria Toxin (DTA) in a cre-dependent configuration (lox-DsRED-lox-DTA-AAV, serotype 10; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, USA). To achieve neuronal excitation in rats, we injected 120 nL of an AAV cocktail containing AAV-Cre and modified muscarinic G protein\u2013coupled receptor (hM3Dq) in a cre-dependent configuration (DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry, serotype 10) (\nAlexander et al., 2009\n;\nAnaclet et al., 2014\n). Control rats were injected with saline in the pSOM. We targeted these injections to the following coordinates: rat RVM [AP = \u221210.3 mm, ML = 0 mm, DV = \u22128.6 mm, 120 nL], rat pSOM [AP = \u221211.5 mm, ML = 0 mm, DV = \u22128.4 mm, 120 nL], mouse pSOM [AP = \u22126.5 mm, ML = 0 mm, DV = \u22124.8 mm].\nFor selective deletions of Vgat + GABAergic neurons in the pSOM, Vgat-IRES-Cre mice (n = 5) were injected with Cre dependent AAV-DTA (described above) into the pSOM (AP = \u22126.5 mm, ML = 0 mm, DV = \u22124.8 mm; 100 nL). Wildtype littermates receiving similar injections served as controls. For selective activation of Vgat + GABAergic neurons in the pSOM, Vgat-IRES-Cre mice (n = 5) were injected with AAV-DIO-hM3Dq-mcherry (AAV-hM3Dq; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, USA; 75 nL) into the pSOM. For recording sleep-wake, four EEG screw electrodes (Plastics One, USA) were implanted into the skull, bilaterally in the frontal and parietal plates. Two flexible EMG electrodes were implanted into the dorsal neck muscles and the free ends of EMG and EEG electrodes were secured into a socket and attached to the skull with cyanoacrylate glue and dental cement.\n4.2.1. EEG/EMG recordings\n4 weeks after postoperative recovery, rats were placed into an isolated recording chamber, connected with a recording cable to a commutator, and allowed to habituate for 24 h. For lesions, continuous EEG/EMG and time-locked video was recorded for 24 h beginning at lights off (1900). For activation and vehicle experiments, i.p. injections of clozapine-n-oxide (CNO, 0.2 mg/kg in rats, 0.3 mg/kg in mice Sigma) or 0.9% saline were made at 1600, 3 h before lights off, with continuous EEG/EMG and time-locked video recorded for 24 h. This injection time was chosen because of the high concentration of REM sleep during this time and to include times of both normally occurring sleep and wakefulness during the typical window of CNO action. The injection order was the same in all animals (saline, CNO). For mice, recordings were begun after 24 h habituation. To focus on REM sleep within the window of CNO action (\nAlexander et al., 2009\n), injections were made at 10 AM and recordings were analyzed for 10 h after injection, all during the light period.\nTo analyze the behavior during REM sleep, video recordings obtained at 30 frames per second were extracted into individual frames using ffmpeg. Subsequently, using a custom script running imagemagick, individual frames were desaturated and compared to subsequent frames to generate a difference frame, with the intensity of each pixel reflecting the change between frames. These difference frames were thresholded to eliminate false-positive difference pixels from video noise. The difference frames were color-coded, made partially transparent, and montaged into a single image to show movement.\nThe EEG/EMG data from each rat or mouse was digitized at 256 hz and imported into SleepSign (KisseiComtec) and divided into 10 s epochs for rats and 12 s for mice. A bandpass filter was applied to the EEG (0.5\u201360 hz) and a highpass filter was applied to the EMG (10 hz). EEG/EMG epochs were automatically scored as wake, NREM sleep, or REM sleep using previously defined criteria (\nAnaclet et al., 2012\n). Briefly, we first applied automatic scoring in SleepSign that identifies wake, NREM sleep, or REM sleep epochs using parameters derived from the EEG and EMG. specifically, wake epochs are identified based on high-EMG signal, low-amplitude EEG, and lack of delta power. NREM sleep is identified based on low-EMG signal and high-amplitude EEG with abundant delta power (0.5\u20134.5 hz). REM sleep is identified based on very low-EMG signal, low-amplitude EEG with a high theta (5\u201310 hz) to delta ratio. The transition from NREM to REM sleep often contains high-theta, high-amplitude EEG with a decline in the integral of the EMG signal; we scored these epochs as NREM sleep based on the amplitude of the EEG. After automatic scoring, all epochs were visually inspected for accuracy. Group differences in total sleep state amounts were tested using the Student\u2019s\nt\n-test, or, in the case of the excitation/inhibition experiments, paired-sample\nt\n-test comparing the post-CNO recording with the post-saline recording in the same animal.\nParameters from the scored epochs of sleep were used for analysis of EEG and EMG changes. Specifically, for detecting EMG spikes, we calculated the integral of the absolute value of the EMG, as well as the maximum amplitude of the EMG within a given epoch. To determine a baseline EMG, we took the mode of the absolute value maximum amplitude during REM sleep. We then automatically scored the number of times that the absolute EMG signal crosses a threshold of twice this value. To assess EEG changes, we derived the power of the EEG in delta (0.5\u20134.5 hz), theta (5\u201310 hz), alpha (10.5\u201320 hz), and beta/gamma (20\u201350 hz) frequency bands using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). We calculated the FFT every hour and either averaged over 24 h (lesion experiments) or split data into the 6 h after CNO, the 18 h after the CNO window, and the 24 h total.\n\n4.3. Immunohistochemistry\nAnimals were perfused within 2 weeks of recording with 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh PA) and brains were transferred to a solution of 20% sucrose and PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide overnight, then sliced into four series of 40 \u03bcm sections using a freezing microtome. For characterizing lesions, sections were stained with 0.1% Thionin (Sigma, St Louis MO). We stained for YFP or mCherry by incubating tissue in primary polyclonal anti-GFP 1:20,000 (Invitrogen) or rabbit anti-mCherry (1:10,000; Clontech) for 24 h, followed by 1 h incubation in biotinylated secondary antiserum in PBST (Vector Laboratories). We stained for c-Fos by incubating tissue in primary cFos (1:20,000 Ab-5, PC38, rabbit polyclonal, Calbiochem, Billerica, MA) for 48 h, followed by 1 h incubation in biotinylated secondary antiserum in PBST (Vector Laboratories).\nAfter washing with PBS, tissue was incubated with an avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Vector laboratories) and stained brown (YFP) with 0.05% 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma, St. Louis MO) and 0.02% H2O2, or black (c-Fos) with the addition of 0.05% cobalt chloride and 0.01% nickel ammonium sulfate for double-stained sections showing the presence of both YFP and c-Fos.\nSections were then mounted onto slides, dehydrated, and coverslipped."

    "Methods": "Isolation of NSCs\nAllogeneic Luc\n+\n-NSCs were isolated from the brain of a homozygous firefly luciferase transgenic mouse (FVB background, Jackson Laboratories, stock # 008450) at the E13.5 stage (\nFerrari et al., 2010\n). Briefly, cells were maintained in serum-free DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml) and basic fibroblast growth factor (10 ng/ml). After seven days of culture, cells had grown to free-floating neurospheres. For passaging, spheres were dissociated using 1 ml Accutase (Life Technologies) for 10 min. Single cells were resuspended in the same medium.\n\nBLI of Luc\n+\n-NSCs\nin vitro\nLuc\n+\n-NSCs were plated into poly L-lysine/laminin-coated 96-well plates at 10,000, 1,000, and 100 cells per well. For bioluminescence measurements, the medium was removed and 30 mg/ml D-luciferin in 10 mM phosphate buffered saline, pH=7.4 (PBS) was added. The luminescence signal was measured using an IVIS SpectrumCT (Perkin Elmer). Images were acquired at one-minute intervals for 10 minutes until peak signal was observed. BLI was quantified by the creation of regions of interest (ROIs) over the wells, and the data were expressed as photon flux (p/sec).\n\nCell preparation for transplantation\nOn the day of transplantation, neurospheres were collected, washed with PBS, and then treated with 1 ml Accutase (Life Technologies) for 10 min at room temperature to make a single cell suspension. The cells were then centrifuged at 200 g for five minutes and the supernatant was removed. The cell pellet was resuspended in PBS and the cell number was determined using an automated cell counter (Cellometer Auto 2000, Nexcelom Bioscience).\n\nImmunosuppression\nMice were immunosuppressed by intraperitoneal (i.p.) daily administration of a cocktail of tacrolimus (FK-506) + sirolimus (Rapamycin) (1 mg/kg each; LC Laboratories; Woburn, MA), beginning five days before cell transplantation, and then, continuously until sacrifice.\n\nCell transplantation\nTwenty male SOD1\nG93A\ntransgenic ALS mice (B6SJL-Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J: Stock # 002726) (Jacksons Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) and 14 male wild-type littermates were used in this study. The animals were divided into three groups: (i) SOD1\nG93A\ntransgenic ALS mice (n=14) transplanted with Luc\n+\n-NSCs; (ii) wild-type littermates (n=14) transplanted with Luc\n+\n-NSCs; and (iii) control SOD1\nG93A\ntransgenic ALS mice (n=6) injected with PBS.\nCells were transplanted in the cervical spinal cord region of 63-day old mice as previously described (\nLepore et al., 2011\n). In brief, animals were anesthetized with 350 mg/kg chloral hydrate i.p. (Sigma). Each mouse received two grafts (bilaterally at the C5 cervical spinal cord region) of 100,000 NSCs/site (in 2 \u03bcL saline) into the ventral horn. Control ALS mice were injected with only 2 \u03bcL saline/site into the ventral horn. Cells were delivered using a 10 \u03bcL Hamilton Gastight syringe with an attached 30-gauge 45\u00b0 beveled needle (Hamilton; Reno, NV). The injection pipette was secured to a manual micromanipulator (World Precision Instruments; Sarasota, FL) attached to an 80\u00b0 tilting base. The tip was lowered to a depth of 0.75 mm below the surface of the cord and was held in place for two minutes before and after cell injection to minimize backflow. Cells were delivered under the control of a micro-syringe pump controller (World Precision Instruments) at a rate of 0.5 \u03bcl/minute.\nAnimals were maintained in a normal day-night cycle (12/12) with free access to food and water. All animal procedures were approved and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of our Institute.\n\nComputed tomography\nCT images were acquired using an IVIS SpectrumCT (Perkin Elmer) using 50 kVp x-rays at 1mA of current, 50 ms exposure time, and with an aluminum filter. A total of 720 projections, spaced 0.5\u00b0 apart, were acquired and the CT volume was reconstructed using Living Image 4.3 software (Perkin Elmer Inc.), which provided a field of view (FOV) of 12.0 \u00d7 12.0 \u00d7 3.0 cm and an isotropic resolution of 0.15 mm.\n\nBLI of intraspinally engrafted Luc\n+\n-NSCs\nBioluminescent images of the animals were acquired using the cooled CCD camera of the same IVIS SpectrumCT instrument. For each animal, anesthesia was induced using 2% isoflurane gas in oxygen, and 150 mg/kg body weight of D-luciferin was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.). Images were acquired 10 min after injection to maximize the bioluminescence signal. To generate 2D bioluminescent images, no emission filter was used during imaging. Images were quantified by drawing ROIs over the spinal cord region and the data were expressed as photon flux (p/sec). To generate 3D bioluminescent images, four spectrally resolved images were acquired using emission filters at 600, 620, 640, and 660 nm, with a bandwidth of 20 nm each. Imaging parameters were an exposure time of 180 s, an aperture of f/1, a FOV = 13 cm, and 2048 \u00d7 2048 pixels resolution. Pixel binning was set to an 8\u00d78 bin width for an effective image resolution of 256 \u00d7 256 pixels. Imaging parameters were identical for both 2D and 3D imaging.\n\nThree-dimensional micro-CT/BLI reconstruction\nThree-dimensional reconstruction of the bioluminescent source and superposition over the CT images was achieved with the diffuse light imaging tomographic (DLIT) algorithm using Living Image 4.3 software. The software predefined the bioluminescent source and tissue absorption spectra for the luciferase reporter and the mouse tissue. The source distribution was visualized in Living Image using a voxel size of 0.31 mm without smoothing.\n\nDisease onset and end-stage assessment\nMice were observed for weight loss and visible signs of weakness in splaying the hind limb to determine disease onset. To determine disease end-stage in a humane manner, the end stage was defined as the inability of mice to right themselves within 30 seconds when placed on their sides.\n\nRotarod test\nFor behavioral analysis, the motor performance of animals was evaluated using a Rotarod apparatus (7650 accelerating model, Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy). Mice were placed on the accelerating rod at a starting speed of 4 rpm, reaching a final speed of 40 rpm in three minutes. All mice underwent three trials. The mice were allowed to stay on the rod for a maximum of 120 seconds and the time of their hold on the rod was scored.\n\nTissue preparation and immunohistochemistry\nAnimals were anesthetized and perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Spinal cords were extracted, post-fixed in the same solution overnight at 4\u00b0C, and cryopreserved in 30% sucrose. Frozen transverse sections, 30 \u03bcm thick, were cut using a Thermo Scientific HM 550 cryostat. For immunohistochemical analysis, non-specific binding was blocked by incubating with a solution consisting of 10% donkey serum and 0.1% Triton X-100-PBS for two hours at room temperature. Sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the appropriate dilution of primary antibody in blocking solution. The corresponding secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor-488; Alexa Fluro-546 secondary fluorescent antibodies, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were added at a ratio of 1:200 in blocking solution for two hours at room temperature. Sections were then rinsed with 0.1 M PBS and placed on coverslips with aqueous non-fluorescent mounting medium (Immu-mount, Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Images were obtained with a Zeiss AX10 fluorescence microscope. Primary antibodies used were: anti-firefly luciferase (1:3000 dilution. GeneTex); anti-GFAP (1:1000 dilution, Santa Cruz, USA); anti-Iba1 (1:1000 dilution, Wako); anti-Olig2 (1:250 dilution, Santa Cruz); anti-NeuN (1:500 dilution, Milipore); and anti-F4/80 (1:250 dilution, Abcam). All images were obtained using the same exposure time.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software (version 6.0f). Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the correlation between two variables. Student\u2019s t-test was used with a significance level set at p<0.05."

    "Methods": "Experimental Design\nAdult male C57BL/6J mice (9\u201312 weeks) were sourced directly from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) or bred and maintained in house. Animals obtained directly were kept in house for 48 hours to habituate to our vivarium prior to experiments. Animals were then subjected to mild central fluid percussion injury (1.40 ATM \u00b1 0.05), as previously described (\nGreer et al., 2013\n;\nH\u00e5nell et al., 2015\n; et al., 2013;\nWang et al., 2011\n). In brief, the fluid pressure pulse in this model results in a brief deformation of the brain through an intact dura and induces diffuse traumatic axonal injury in the optic nerve approximately 1mm proximal to the chiasm as well as other neocortical and subcortical sites not addressed in the current study.\nAs employed, the model involved the induction of general anesthesia in adult male mice with inhaled isoflurane (<5%) before placing their head in a stereotactic frame. Toe pinch reflexes were monitored during surgery and isoflurane concentration adjusted to maintain depth of anesthesia. The skin was opened over the skull and retracted to allow for a 3mm wide craniotomy midway between lambdoid and bregma cranial sutures. Care was taken to keep the underlying dura intact and a dissecting microscope was used to ensure dural integrity as well as prevention of injury to the large sagittal vascular structures. A luer hub was fixed in place over the craniotomy with dental cement and the animal was allowed to recovery from anesthesia for approximately 1 hour. The animal was then anesthetized (4% isoflurane) again prior to mounting to the fluid percussion device and the impulse delivered to the intact dura of the mouse brain. Sham-injured animals received the same surgeries including, craniotomy, the mounting of the luer hub and attaching the animal to the fluid percussion device, with the absence of the injury that results from release of the pendulum. During surgery to perform craniotomy and implant the luer hub, each mouse was monitored using a pulse oximeter sensor to collect blood oxygen saturation, heart rate, and respiratory rate. Post-injury or sham procedure, return of toe pinch reflex as well as righting reflex were recorded.\nThe animals were prepared for histologic analysis at 4, 10, and 20 days after injury. The early time point of 4 days was selected to allow axonal disconnection to reach its apogee prior to evaluation of deafferentation based on our previous report (\nWang et al., 2011\n) . We previously examined mTBI retinas for RGC death induced by DAI and demonstrated that the injured/axotomized RGCs continue to survive up to 28 days after injury (\nWang et al., 2013\n) . The time points of 10 and 20 days were chosen based on mouse studies evaluating deafferentation and recovery in the visual axis (\nBenowitz and Yin, 2008\n;\nLima et al., 2012\n) . For the histological analyses, the animals were prepared in three difference fashions for either immunohistochemistry, CTB, or routine histopathology. Animals prepared for CTB fluorophore visualization or VGLUT2 immunohistochemistry were sacrificed via intraperitoneal overdose of sodium pentobarbital. Those prepared for CTB visualization were transcardially perfused with 25mL of heparinized 0.9% saline (1u/mL) followed by 200mL of 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved and filtered into Millonig\u2019s buffer (pH 7.4). Animals undergoing VGLUT2 immunohistochemistry or standard histologic preparation in plastic sections were perfused in a similar fashion with the addition of 0.2% glutaraldehyde to the fixative perfusion solution. The brain, optic nerves, and eyes of each animal were post-fixed in their respective fixative for 24 hours and stored at 4 degrees Celsius in Millonig\u2019s buffer until sectioning. All protocols used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nExamination of mTBI induced retinogeniculate axon terminal loss via VGLUT2 immunohistochemistry\nFor analysis of VGLUT2 immunoreactive axon terminal loss and recovery, animals were prepared as described above for mTBI (1.4 -+0.05 ATM) or sham injury. Sham animals were prepared from littermates of mTBI animals and were sacrificed at similar time points following surgery. Our inclusion criteria were the absence of dural injury during surgical procedures, adequate wound healing following injury or sham-injury, normal feeding and drinking, and normal grooming in days following surgery. All animals prepared for VGLUT2 immunohistochemistry met inclusion criteria and therefore none were excluded from analysis. A total of 6 sham animals together with 4\u20135 mTBI animals for each post-injury time point were used to generate sections for analysis (Sham N = 6, 4 day mTBI N = 4, 10 day mTBI N = 5, 20 day mTBI N = 5). Free floating coronal sections (40\u00b5m) were obtained using a vibrating blade microtome (Leica VT1000 S). We determined a randomized start point and collected alternating sections through the entire left and right dLGN for each animal. Immunohistochemistry was performed on all collected sections by a blinded investigator. Sections were serial washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) before incubating for 1 hour at room temperature in blocking solution containing; 0.3M glycine (Sigma-Aldrich), 2.5% bovine serum albumin (Electron Microscopy Sciences), 2.5% normal goat serum (S1000, Vector Labs), in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.2). Sections were then incubated overnight at room temperature on oscillating stage with 1:2000 dilution of affinity purified rabbit anti-VGLUT2 polyclonal IgG antibody (Synaptic Systems, Cat. No. 135 303) diluted into solution containing; 2.5% BSA, 2.5% NGS, 0.5% triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), in PBS (pH 7.2). Following serial washes in antibody free blocking solution, sections were incubated in poly-clonal goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to Alexa 568 (Life Technologies, Cat. No. A-11036) at 1:500 dilution in above blocking solution for 2 hours. Sections were serial washed in PBS, then phosphate buffer, followed by mounting with anti-fade mountant (Life Technologies, Cat. No. P-36931) and cover slipped. Slides were allowed to cure protected from light overnight and edges sealed with nail varnish prior to imaging.\nConfocal microscopy was performed for qualitative examination of VGLUT2 positive axon terminals using a Zeiss LSM 700 scanning laser microscope with a Nikon Plan-Apochromat 63\u00d7/1.57 objective. The derived Z-stack images were obtained with consideration of Nyquist sampling and saved in CZI format for later examination. Images were processed using Zen Black (Carl Zeiss) to produce maximum intensity projections from Z-stacks.\nQuantitative assessment of images obtained from immunohistochemistry for VGLUT2 was performed on sections through dLGN that receive projections from both eyes due to report of potential for reorganization between ipsilateral and contralateral projections following monocular sensory deprivation in adult mice (\nColeman et al., 2009\n;\nFeldman, 2003\n). This region is well described as the anterior-posterior (AP) midline of dLGN and can be identified through anatomic landmarks of its borders (\nGodement et al., 1980\n). Sections with anatomic or processing artifacts such as large perforating vessels or bubbles in the mountant which could bias analysis were excluded by a blinded investigator. Sections identified in a blinded fashion as containing the anterior-posterior midline of dLGN were imaged using monochromatic mode on a digital camera (Olympus DP 71) mounted to an epifluorescent upright microscope (Nikon E800) and illuminated using LED light source passed through a dichroic filter for 568nm and magnified with a 10\u00d7 primary objective (Nikon Plan Fluor 10\u00d7/0.30). Background fluorescence was removed using background subtraction tool in ImageJ (NIH) with rolling ball radius set to 100. The area surrounding dLGN was cropped out using the polygonal lasso tool in Photoshop CS6 (Adobe) by a blinded investigator and images were converted from greyscale using the threshold function set to 20% such that in the final image, the area around dLGN was white, the area of dLGN was black, and the signal from the immunofluorescent marker was red. Using a custom software module, the number of red pixels were compared to the number of red or black pixels to derive a percent value for the area of each section through dLGN with VGLUT2 immunoreactivity. Sham animals sacrificed and perfused at different time points following surgery were pooled for analysis. Statistical comparisons between sham and each of the three time points following mTBI were performed as described below in image analysis and statistical methods sections.\n\nExamination of retinogeniculate axon terminal loss following mTBI through anterograde tract tracing\nIn a separate experiment, mice subject to sham or mTBI were subjected to intravitreal injection of recombinant cholera toxin subunit \u03b2 (CTB) conjugated to Alexa 488 or Alexa 594 fluorescent dye (Thermofisher Scientific, Cat. No. C34775 and C34777). This tracer allows visualization of axonal projections and axon terminals without reliance on immunohistochemistry and also allows separation of projections from either eye based on the Alexa dye conjugated to the CTB molecule (\nDemas et al., 2006\n;\nFort and Jouvet, 1990\n).\nMice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of Ketamine (10mg/mL) and Xylazine (0.5mg/ml) solution diluted in sterile phosphate buffered saline with delivered volume based on weight of animal (0.01mL/g). A puncture 1mm behind the limbus at the superior temporal aspect of the eye was made using a 30 gauge sterile needle and approximately 3 \u00b5l of vitreous fluid aspirated using a pulled borosilicate glass pipet. Using a separate clean pulled glass pipet, 3 \u00b5l of 1% CTB reconstituted in sterile phosphate buffered saline was injected using a picospritzer into each eye with CTB conjugated to Alexa 488 injected into the right eye and CTB conjugated to Alexa 594 injected into the left eye for each animal. The pipet was left in place for approximately 30 seconds prior to removal. Body temperature was maintained with a heating pad (Harvard Homeothermic Blanket) during eye injection as well as recovery period before being returned to the vivarium. Animals were sacrificed and perfused with heparinized saline and 4% paraformaldehyde fixative 72 hours following eye injection and post-fixed for 24 hours in 4% paraformaldehyde.\nThe retinas of all animals were dissected from the remainder of the orbit and flat mounted to glass slides with 0.15 mm thick cover slips superglued in place to either side of the retina before being mounted with Prolong Gold (Life Technologies, Cat. No. P-36931). A larger coverslip was laid to rest on the smaller cover slips to cover the flattened retina and the edges sealed with clear nail varnish prior to imaging on Nikon E800 epifluorescent microscope. A total of 4 animals per mTBI time point or sham cohort were selected for eye injections and projection analysis however animals were rejected and replaced if examination of the retinas post-fixation revealed dural injury, retinal injury, or non-uniform RGC labeling. One animal in the 4 day TBI group was rejected after image acquisition due to high background fluorescence which when subtracted, would also obscure the fluorescent signal such that the result severely under-represented signal from CTB labeled axon terminals. The final number of animals used in analysis is as follows; sham N = 4, 4 day post-mTBI N = 3, 10 day post-mTBI N = 4, 20 day post-mTBI N = 4.\nThe brains were blocked and free floating coronal sections were obtained at 70\u00b5m through the entire length of dLGN on a vibratome and serial mounted to glass slides with Prolong Gold containing DAPI. Slides were allowed to cure protected from light overnight and edges sealed with nail varnish prior to storage at \u221220 degrees Celsius until imaging. We noted differences in signal to background fluorescence for each of the two fluorophores used as well as between different batches of fluorophores obtained from Thermofisher scientific. This potential confound was obviated by processing sham and mTBI groups simultaneously and also accounted for by sampling both sides of each brain equally.\nFor imaging of sections from CTB injected animals, adjustment to exposure time made during imaging due to animal to animal variability in background fluorescence and Alexa signal intensity were kept constant between sections from the same animal. The exposure settings were recorded for each animal and comparable between sham and injury groups. Each fluorophore was imaged using monochromatic mode on the Olympus DP 71 camera attached to a Nikon E800 epifluorescent microscope. Illumination was performed using UV LED light source passed through dichroic filters for Alexa 488 or Alexa 594 depending on the fluorescent channel being captured. Images of all sections through dLGN were examined and all sections through the AP midline for each dLGN were identified by recognition of ipsilateral and contralateral projections by a blinded investigator. Samples were excluded, however, if they contained large anatomic or processing artifacts that obscure the region of interest.\nOn images of dLGN containing both CTB conjugated Alexa dyes, corresponding to the AP midline of dLGN, the area representing dLGN was cropped out from the surrounding structures using the polygonal lasso tool in Photoshop CS6 (Adobe) by a blinded investigator. The same investigator removed background fluorescence by adjusting the level function in Photoshop for each fluorophore until the fluorescent signal in the adjacent thalamus was no longer present in each sample. Threshold percentage used for conversion of signal images to binary images were also determined by the blinded investigator who used the threshold percent value that best represented the observed signal from the fluorophores (\nMuir-Robinson et al., 2002\n;\nTorborg and Feller, 2004\n). Threshold percentage ranged from 16% to 63% for both red and green channels with a mean threshold of 30% (+- 7.8% std dev) for the green channel and a mean threshold of 38% (+- 10.0% std dev) for the red channel. The resulting image labeled ipsilateral or contralateral axon terminal projections red or green, the overlap between the two projections as yellow, and the remaining area of dLGN as black. Using again the custom software module, a percentage value was derived for percent of dLGN section area covered by ipsilateral or contralateral projections as well as overlap between ipsilateral and contralateral projections. Statistical comparisons were performed using parametric or non-parametric comparisons between data from sham animals and animals from each time point following mTBI.\n\nExamination of CTB fluorescent signal within contralateral zone of dLGN\nWithin the contralateral region of dLGN, which only receives input from the contralateral eye, there are anatomical subgroups of axon terminals that segregate between projecting to the dorsal shell of dLGN and projecting to the inner core (\nHuberman et al., 2009\n;\nHuberman and Feller, 2008\n;\nRivlin-Etzion et al., 2011\n;\nSanes and Masland, 2015\n). To identify changes within the shell and core, we compared Alexa dye fluorescent signal in images of CTB injected mice after background fluorescence has been removed using the level adjustment tool in Photoshop. Animals prepared for CTB analysis above were re-analyzed through the grey scale images of only contralateral projections in dLGN (Sham N = 4, 4 day mTBI N = 3, 10 day mTBI N = 4, 20 day mTBI N = 4). Using all the sections we collected through the CTB labeled dLGN, a blinded investigator selected, using ImageJ (NIH), a vertical plot profile through the patch of contralateral projections for each section of dLGN. The optic tract where it enters dLGN was used as the top border while the bottom border was defined by the beginning of the thalamocortical tract in each section (\nFigure 5A\n). Sections with anatomic artifact that may bias results were excluded by the investigator. The plot profile values were then normalized to the selected region by subtracting the minimum value from each raw value and dividing the result by the difference between the minimum and maximum fluorescence. The results were then binned at 5% intervals of the depth from surface of the optic tract to derive a final percentage of average fluorescent intensity for each bin (\nHuberman et al., 2009\n). Values for each binned width were compared between the three time points and sham animals as seen in\nFigure 5B\n.\nF\nvalue = (\nF\nraw \u2013\nF\nmin) / (\nF\nmax \u2013\nF\nmin)\nFigure 5.\nOpen in a new tab\nIn panel A, a section of dLGN from a sham mouse injected with CTB is shown. The shell is marked with asterisks. Using a rectangular window, we measured the plot profile of Alexa dye pixel intensity along the depth of the dLGN within the region receiving only contralateral inputs using methods described by Huberman et al. We normalized the values at each position along the depth using the formula above, where Fmin is the minimum fluorescence value, Fmax is the maximum fluorescence value, and Fraw is the signal intensity along each pixel width of the box for each given section. Normalized fluorescence values were binned at 5% intervals of the depth and averaged across all sections from all animals in each experimental group. Panel B demonstrates the change in fraction of max fluorescence as one moves from the dorsolateral edge to the ventromedial edge of dLGN for each group. Scale bar = 20um. Bars represent SEM. N = 3 to 4 animals per group with 3 to 4 samples per dLGN per animal.\n\nRoutine histologic screening to assess the presence of DAI in the optic nerve\nThe eyes and optic nerves of a sham-injured mouse and a 4 day post-mTBI mouse used for immunohistochemistry were dissected free from surrounding structures up to the level of the optic chiasm and removed from the surrounding brain by transection of the optic tract. The orbits of the eyes as well as the associated musculature were removed with sharp dissection from the optic nerves. The remaining optic nerve, chiasm, and beginning optic tract were placed en bloc in 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 90 minutes. After serial rinses in 0.1 M Millonig\u2019s buffer (pH 7.4), the tissue was then dehydrated with 15 minute incubations in a gradient of cold EtOH dilutions ranging from 30% to 95% in 10% increments. Dilutions stronger than 50% contained 1% uranyl acetate. Finally tissue is dehydrated with 100% EtOH through 3 incubations before incubating with propylene oxide. Tissue is then incubated with propylene oxide and EM resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) overnight. Next day, tissue is changed into new EM resin for embedding and placed in oven at 55\u00b0 C. Resin molds containing both the right and left optic nerves were sectioned longitudinally on an ultramicrotome (Carl Zeiss) to produce sections with 1 \u00b5m thickness. Sections were then counterstained with toluidine blue before cover slipping with Permount mounting media (Fisher Scientific). Qualitative analysis of optic nerve sections was performed through multiple longitudinal sections to identify DAI pathology as well as intact axons. Images were taken using routine light microscopy with a DP71 digital camera attached to Nikon E800 and 100\u00d7 oil immersion objective (NA 0.72).\n\nImage Analysis and Statistical Methods\nAs reported previously, our injury model induces diffuse axonal injury symmetrically throughout the brain and optic nerves (\nGreer et al., 2013\n;\nWang et al., 2011\n). The dLGN on both sides of each animal were treated as internal replicates. Brain sections representing the entire rostrocaudal length of dLGN were identified and all sections through the AP midline of each dLGN were pulled for analysis unless specifically stated otherwise. All sections through the dLGN were treated as independent observations for each group analyzed. Images were analyzed by a blinded investigator to remove background fluorescent signal and/or convert 8-bit images to binary thresholded images. Percentage of dLGN covered by CTB signal or VGLUT2 signal was determined using a custom software module courtesy of lab of Dr. William Guido. The software used the binary threshold images to compare the number of pixels coinciding with either CTB fluorophores or VGLUT2 fluorescent signal with the number of pixels coinciding with area of dLGN to derive a value for the percentage of dLGN covered by each CTB fluorophore or VGLUT2 fluorescent signal.\nStatistical analysis was performed using JMP Pro 11 (SAS Institute Inc.). Determination of whether to use parametric or non-parametric inferential statistics was assessed using Levene\u2019s test to compare variance of groups in each dataset. For datasets with equal variance between groups, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, followed by pair-wise comparison utilizing Tukey-Kramer HSD to account for multiple comparisons. For datasets where Levene\u2019s test demonstrated unequal distribution of variance, variance was analyzed utilizing the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test, followed by Steel-Dwass post-hoc analysis to account for multiple pair-wise comparisons. Statistical significance was set at a p < 0.05 for all datasets and all comparisons."

    "Methods": "Brain Injury\nAll surgical and behavioral procedures were done in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Drexel University College of Medicine and were in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Animals. Animals were placed on a heating pad set to 37\u00b0C to maintain body temperature throughout all procedures and recovery. Brain injuries were induced in isoflurane-anesthetized 11-day-old male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) using the electronically driven controlled cortical impact (eCCI) device (Custom Design International, Richmond, VA), as previously described (\nRaghupathi and Huh, 2007\n); the convex indenter (5mm diameter) was driven 3mm from the point of contact with the skull with a velocity of 5m/s and a dwell time of 100ms. Animals were injured at 45 seconds following the removal of anesthesia, and the total time from anesthesia to impact was 5 min; sham-injured animals were exposed to anesthesia for 4 min during surgical preparation and the zeroing of the impactor tip to the skull (which was not fired). On the day of injury, animals were randomly assigned to injury and treatment conditions. Animals had similar weights on the day of injury irrespective of sex and injury/treatment status (F\n2,129\n=0.76, p=0.38;\nTable 1\n). Apnea latency times were recorded for brain-injured animals from the time of impact to when they took their first breath. The loss of a righting reflex was measured by the length of time taken by the animal to return onto all four limbs after being placed on their side immediately following injury. Once the animal regained normal breathing, the skull was evaluated for the presence of fracture and herniation (if brain tissue was extruding via the fracture) and hematoma which was defined as mild (if the area of the hematoma was qualitatively smaller than the diameter of the impactor), moderate (if the area was as large as the diameter of the impactor or severe (if the area was larger than the diameter of the impactor) (\nRaghupathi and Huh, 2007\n). Pups were weaned from the dam on postnatal day 21.\nTable 1.\nAcute neurologic status of groups used in studies 1 and 2.\nGroup\nN\nSex\nBody weight\nat injury\n(g)\nApnea\n(s)\nLatency to\nRighting Reflex\n(s)\nHematoma\nHerniation\nMild (N)\nModerate (N)\n(N)\nSham-injured\n19\nMale\n23 \u00b1 1\nn/a\n137 \u00b1 21\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nSham-injured\n19\nFemale\n22 \u00b1 0\nn/a\n119 \u00b1 14\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nBrain-injured + vehicle\n21\nMale\n23 \u00b1 1\n13 \u00b1 2\n168 \u00b1 23\n11\n8\n2\nBrain-injured + vehicle\n20\nFemale\n22 \u00b1 0\n13 \u00b1 2\n183 \u00b1 18\n9\n7\n4\nBrain-injured +\nminocycline\n29\nMale\n23 \u00b1 1\n14 \u00b1 2\n185 \u00b1 17\n11\n16\n2\nBrain-injured +\nminocycline\n25\nFemale\n22 \u00b1 1\n15 \u00b1 2\n187 \u00b1 22\n9\n13\n3\nOpen in a new tab\nFor purposes of comparison, animals used in study 1 and 2 were combined. Apnea times and latency to regain righting reflex were calculated as described in the Methods. Values represent group Means and standard errors of the Mean.\n\nTreatment paradigms\nStudy 1\nImmediately following the injury, animals were randomly assigned to receive a 45mg/Kg dose of minocycline hydrochloride (Sigma, St. Louis MO) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), or vehicle (PBS, 0.2mL/Kg) via an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Sham-injured animals were also randomly assigned to receive either vehicle or minocycline. Minocycline or vehicle was injected every 12 hours for 3 days for a total of 6 injections (45 mg/Kg/injection or 0.2 mL/Kg/injection). This dose and dosing paradigm was successful in reducing acute microglial activation in neonate repetitive TBI (\nHanlon et al., 2016\n) and other models of neonate HI (\nBuller et al., 2009\n). Details of animal numbers as a function of outcome measure and time point are presented in\nTable 2\n.\nTable 2.\nAnimal numbers used in studies 1 and 2 as a function of outcome measure and survival time point(s).\nStudy\nOutcome\nTime point (N)\nExcluded Animals\n1\nHistology\n3d (4S, 7 IV, 9 IM)\n--------\n7d (3S, 4 IV, 5 IM)\n--------\nSpatial\nLearning\n10\u201314d (11S, 12 IV,\n14 IM)\n1 IM died at 3d post-injury\n1 IM and 1 SM displayed thigmotactic behavior\nand were excluded\n2\nHistology\n10d (5S, 5 IV, 6 IM)\n---------\n15d (7S, 6 IV, 6 IM)\n---------\nSpatial\nLearning\n10\u201314d (14S, 14 IV,\n20 IM)\n1 IV and 6 IM displayed thigmotactic behavior\nand were excluded\nOpen in a new tab\nSham- and brain-injured animals were randomly assigned to receive either vehicle or minocycline as described in the Methods. Included are the animals that were excluded from the study due to either mortality or behavioral abnormality. S, sham; IV, injured + vehicle; IM, injured + minocycline.\nStudy 2\nImmediately after injury, animals were randomly assigned to receive intraperitoneal injections of either minocycline (45mg/Kg) or PBS vehicle (0.2mL/Kg); following a second injection of minocycline or vehicle 12 hours later, animals received once daily intraperitoneal injections of minocycline or vehicle (45mg/Kg/injection or 0.2mL/Kg/injection) for 9 days for a total of 11 injections. Sham-injured animals were also randomly assigned to receive either vehicle or minocycline. Similar extended dosing paradigms have been successful in reducing microglial activation in the chronic post-injury period following HI in neonate rats (\nCarty et al., 2008\n;\nWixey et al., 2011\n), diffuse TBI in the adult mouse (\nNg et al., 2012\n) and contusive TBI in the adult rat (\nLam et al., 2013\n). Details of animal numbers as a function of outcome measure and time point are presented in\nTable 2\n.\n\nHistologic and immunohistochemical staining and quantification\nAnimals were transcardially perfused with 10% formalin (Thermofisher), and brains were processed for histology and immunohistochemistry as previously described (\nHanlon et al., 2016\n;\nHuh et al., 2007\n). Adjacent sets of sections (500\u00b5m apart), representing the rostral-caudal extent of the injury from Bregma to 5.6mm posterior to bregma, were mounted on gelatin-coated slides and stained for Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) (\nHuh et al., 2008\n) and Nissl-myelin (2% Cresyl violet and 0.2% Cyanine R) respectively. The areas of the cortex (from midline to rhinal fissure) of the injured hemisphere and white matter (corpus callosum, cingulum and lateral aspects up to the rhinal fissure) were measured in Nissl-myelin-labeled sections via manual tracing using Image J software (NIH) (\nHanlon et al., 2016\n). Additional sets of sections were evaluated for microglia/macrophages using anti-ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1, Wako, Richmond, VA, 1:20,000) and traumatic axonal injury (TAI) using a polyclonal antibody to the C-terminal end of amyloid precursor protein (APP, Zymed, San Francisco, CA, 1:2,000) as previously described (\nHanlon et al., 2016\n). Quantification in the cortex (layers 2 through 5 of the retrosplenial, motor and somatosensory cortices), hippocampus (dorsal subiculum) and thalamus (dorsolateral and lateral geniculate nuclei) was conducted by counting labeled profiles (Iba1, FJB, APP) in 3\u20135 high power field (HPF) images (20x magnification) per section across 5 non-adjacent sections. Counts of Iba1(+) profiles were based on the presence of a discernable cell body with elongated processes (resting) or an amoeboid appearance (activated); Iba1(+) profiles that exhibited an activated morphology were counted and presented as a percent of total Iba1(+) profiles in that region. Fluoro-Jade B(+) and APP(+) profiles (regardless of size) were counted in 3 HPF images (20x magnification) per section that covered the area between the corpus callosum, cingulum and the lateral aspects of the white matter up to the rhinal fissure across 5 sections. The high density of Iba1 immunoreactive profiles in these white matter tracts required quantification using a thresholding-based area analysis as previously described (\nHanlon et al., 2016\n;\nNg et al., 2012\n). Quantification was performed by co-authors (LAH, JWH) blinded to both injury and treatment status.\n\nSpatial Learning and Memory Assessment\nSpatial learning was assessed on days 10\u201313 after sham- or brain injury using the Morris water maze as previously described (\nHanlon et al., 2016\n;\nHuh et al., 2008\n). On day 14 post-injury, animals underwent probe trials (retention) and a visible platform trial (vision deficit testing) as previously described (\nHanlon et al., 2016\n). Animals that had problems completing the learning trials were excluded from the study and are identified in\nTable 2\n.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll statistics were performed using Statistica 7 (StatSoft, Tulsa OK). All data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean. As previously observed (\nHanlon et al., 2016\n), sham-injured animals that received vehicle injections were not statistically different from those that were treated with minocycline in any of the various histologic and behavioral outcome measures and were therefore combined for statistical purposes. Outcome measures were compared across groups (sham, injured + vehicle, injured + minocycline) as a function of time (when applicable) and sex using appropriate analyses of variance (ANOVA). When necessary, post-hoc analyses were performed using the Newman-Keuls test and a value of p\u22640.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "2.1. Experimental subjects\nThe experiments were performed in male Wistar rats (Charles River, Wilmington, MA), fifty days old at the beginning of the study, in accordance with the policies of the National Institutes of Health and of the UCLA Office of Protection of Research Subjects.\n\n2.2. Experiment design\nThe study consisted of the following steps (\nFig. 1\n). Induction of SE, followed 4 weeks later by animal selection and category assignments based on the spontaneous seizure frequency and the animals\u2019 performance in the forced swimming test (FST). Within each category, the subjects were then randomized for treatments. In the main experiments (solid lines, gray box), GalR blockers were administered over 3 days into either RN or LC, followed by FST and fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) of 5-HT and NE in the ascending pathways, at the time of drug infusions. In an additional experiment (dashed lines, outside the gray box), FST was repeated two weeks later (i.e. after the one-week washout), and was followed by FSCV.\nFig. 1. Study design.\nOpen in a new tab\nExperiment design\nExplanations in Methods.\n\n2.3. Epilepsy model\nSE was induced by LiCl (128 mg/kg, i.p., Sigma, St. Louis, MO) followed 24 hours later by pilocarpine (40 mg/kg, s.c., Sigma). In order to alleviate the severity of SE and to decrease the frequency of subsequent spontaneous seizures, rats received i.p. injections of diazepam (10 mg/kg) and phenytoin (50 mg/kg) one and four hours after the SE onset (\nKumar et al., 2016\n;\nMazarati et al., 2008\n;\nPineda et al., 2014\n;\nPineda et al., 2012\n). In control animals, saline was injected instead of pilocarpine. Starting from four weeks after SE and until the end of the study, the animals were continuously video-monitored for documenting spontaneous seizures (\nFig. 1\n).\n\n2.4. Forced swimming test (FST)\nFST was used to examine depressive- and impulsive-like behaviors as described by our group (\nKumar et al., 2016\n;\nMazarati et al., 2008\n;\nPineda et al., 2014\n). The first FST (FST\n1\n) was performed 4 weeks after SE; the second (FST\n2\n) was conducted during the administration of GalR ligands; some animals underwent the third test (FST\n3\n) after the drug washout (\nFig. 1\n). Time between the tests was at least 2 weeks, so as to avoid any previous forced swimming experience to affect an animal\u2019s performance (\nDe Pablo et al., 1989\n;\nMezadri et al., 2011\n). The test consisted of a single 5-minute-long session in a tank filled with water at 22\u00b0-25\u00b0C. Behavior was video-recorded and analyzed off-line in a blinded fashion. Cumulative durations of three distinct behaviors were calculated: active adaptive behavior (i.e. swimming along the walls, climbing, diving); immobility (i.e. movements were limited to maintaining the head above the surface with no escape attempts); and non-adaptive struggle (i.e. treading water away from the walls with no attempts to escape) (\nMazarati et al., 2008\n;\nPineda et al., 2014\n). The first two behaviors are typical for both normal animals and those with depressive-like impairments. In validated models of depression, the immobility time is increased, and this increment is regarded as both an indicator, and a measure of the inability to cope with the stress (\nCryan et al., 2005\n). Non-adaptive struggle is negligible in normal rats, but occurs in 25-50% of animals with epilepsy (\nKumar et al., 2016\n;\nPineda et al., 2014\n). We established that only those animals which displayed the non-adaptive struggle during FST, presented with impulsivity in an ADHD-specific Lateralized Reaction Time Task (LRTT) (\nPineda et al., 2014\n). The downside of LRTT and similar tasks (such as 5-choice serial reaction time task, 5-CSRT) is that they take weeks to complete (\nFaure et al., 2014\n;\nJentsch, 2005\n;\nJentsch et al., 2009\n) and are thus associated with substantial challenges when used in chronic epilepsy (\nFaure et al., 2014\n;\nPineda et al., 2014\n). Based on the congruency between ADHD-specific behavior during LRTT and non-adaptive struggle during FST, we proposed that the latter could be used as a simple surrogate marker of impulsivity (\nPineda et al., 2014\n). Such a suggestion was further confirmed by an observation that both impulsivity in LRTT and non-adaptive struggle in the FST bore a specific neurochemical signature in a form of the suppressed noradrenergic tone in the LC-PFC pathway (\nKumar et al., 2016\n;\nPineda et al., 2014\n).\n\n2.5. Subject selection and categorization\nIn order to standardize experimental conditions, the animals were advanced to, or excluded from further studies and/or data analysis based on the following criteria:\n(1) Spontaneous seizures. Only those animals which presented with spontaneous recurrent secondary generalized complex partial seizures (stage 4-5 using the Racine scale) during the first four weeks of the observation were used. Of these animals, rats were excluded at any time during the study, if they presented with more than 5 seizures per week, as such high seizure frequency renders them unamenable to behavioral testing (\nMazarati et al., 2010\n;\nPineda et al., 2014\n).\n(2) Behavior. Based on the behavior in the first FST, animals with epilepsy were assigned to one of four categories (\nKumar et al., 2016\n;\nPineda et al., 2014\n). The assignments were based on behavioral patterns consistently observed in na\u00efve (i.e. non-epileptic) animals. (i) In not impaired animals, cumulative immobility time was < 100 s, and struggling behavior- < 10 s. (ii) In \u201cdepressed\u201d rats, cumulative immobility time was \u2265100, and struggling behavior- < 10 s. (iii) In \u201cimpulsive\u201d animals, cumulative immobility time was < 100 s and struggling behavior- \u2265 10 s. (iv) In \u201cdepressed/impulsive\u201d rats, cumulative immobility time was \u2265100 s and struggle- \u226510 s.\nFor our studies, we chose only those animals which were either not impaired, or displayed only one behavioral deficit (i.e. either depressive- or impulsive-like behavior). Furthermore, control subjects which had been identified as outliers during FST\n1\n., were removed from further experiments (see 2.9, Data analysis).\n\n2.6. GalR blockers\nPharmacological tools for studying GalR subtypes are limited. Subtype-specific ligands do notexist (in that all available ligands show some degree of cross-affinity among receptor subtypes). Based on commercial availability, we used two peptide blockers of galanin receptors: M40 (Galanin [1-13]-Pro-Pro-[Ala-Leu-]2Ala amide), a non-selective GalR1/GalR2 antagonist (Ki for GalR1 1.82 nM, and for GalR2-5.1 nM), and M871 (Galanin-[2-13]-Glu-His-[Pro]3-[Ala-Leu]2-Ala-amide), a preferential GalR2 antagonist (Ki for GalR1 420 nM, for GalR2-13.1 nM; both compounds from Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) (\nMitsukawa et al., 2010\n;\nWebling et al., 2012\n). Therefore, the involvement of GalR1 and GalR2 in regulating behavior and monoamine release was deduced from comparing the effects of the two agents.\n\n2.7. Preparation of drug infusion system, surgery and drug delivery\nALZET osmotic mini-pumps (Cupertino, CA) model 1007D (reservoir volume 100 \u03bcl, nominal release rate 0.5 \u03bcl/hour) were filled with 10 nM solution of M40, 30 nM solution of M871, or saline. The pumps were connected to the infusion cannula (PlasticsOne, Roanoke, VA; 28 GA; length 6.5 mm for RN, 8.0 mm for LC) via a polypropylene catheter placed in sterile saline and primed at 37\u00baC for 24 hours prior to the implantation.\nFor drug delivery, animals within each category (i.e. na\u00efve, epileptic not-impaired, epileptic \u201cdepressed\u201d and epileptic \u201cimpulsive\u201d) were randomized and the implantation of the pumps was performed in a \u201cblinded\u201d fashion. Surgery was performed under isoflurane anesthesia upon placing the animals in the stereotaxic apparatus. A subcutaneous pocket was prepared in the back. For the intra-RN infusion, a single ALZET pump was placed in the pocket and the catheter was guided under the skin to the exposed skull. The cannula was implanted into RN (AP= \u22127.8; midline; V= 6.0) (\nPaxions and Watson, 1986\n). For the intra-LC infusion, two pumps were placed inside the pocket, and guide cannulas were implanted bilaterally into LC (AP= \u22129.8; L=1.2, V=7.5) (\nPaxions and Watson, 1986\n). Cannulas were fixed to the skull using dental cement and the animal was released into the home cage.\nThree days after surgery (i.e. after the start of the drug delivery), the animals underwent FST\n2\n, which was followed by FSCV in most them. Separate group of rats underwent FST\n3\ntwo weeks after FST\n2\n, (i.e. after 10 days of washout), followed by FSCV (\nFig. 1\n).\n\n2.8. Fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV)\nFSCV affords real time measurement of the strength of a monoamine transmission in neuroanatomical pathways of interest. The technique relies on a non-enzymatic oxidation of monoamines to quinones upon passing specific ramp currents through the carbon fiber electrode (CFE) placed in a monoamine-containing milieu, such as brain tissue or a solution. By measuring the oxidation rate, the amount of monoamine released is inferred (\nDankoski et al., 2016\n;\nDankoski and Wightman, 2013\n;\nHerr et al., 2012\n;\nPark et al., 2009\n;\nPark et al., 2011\n;\nWood and Hashemi, 2013\n). The procedure was performed as previously described by our group (\nKumar et al., 2016\n;\nMazarati et al., 2008\n;\nPineda et al., 2014\n;\nPineda et al., 2011\n) with further optimization for directly calculating the amount of the released transmitter.\nIn Vivo\nVoltammetry System (Invilog, Kuopio, Finland) include a Potentiostat/Electrical stimulator unit, connected to the two-electrode headstage on the input terminal and to the digital acquisition board on the output terminal. The digital acquisition board was connected to a Windows 10 personal computer equipped with the FSCV analysis software. A CFE (32 \u03bcM, sensitivity >20 nA/\u03bcM, Nafion-coated) and a dry reference Ag/AgCl electrode (2.5 mm diameter) were connected to the headstage.\nPrior to the procedure, CFE was calibrated in incremental concentrations of standards (5-HT and NE, both from Sigma, St. Louis, MO). For 5-HT, the ramp current applied to the CFE consisted of a resting potential 0 V scanned to 1.2 V, then to \u22120.6 V and then back to 0 V at 300 V/s. For NE, the ramp current consisted of a resting potential \u22120.4 V, scanned to 1.15 V and back to \u2212400 V at 300 V/s. Ramp currents were applied every 100 ms over 1 s, and average currents for each monoamine concentration were used to generate standard curves. (\nKumar et al., 2016\n;\nPineda et al., 2014\n)\nOne day after FST\n2\n(or FST\n3\nwhere applicable), the animal was anesthetized with Urethane (1.5 g/kg s.c.) and placed in the stereotaxic frame. The cannula and the dental cement cap were removed. CFE was lowered into the infralimbic region of PFC (AP=+2.7, L= 0.5, V=5.0 mm) (\nPaxions and Watson, 1986\n). The reference electrode was placed on the nasal bone. The concentric stimulating electrode (26 GA) was connected to the stimulator output of the potentiostat/stimulating unit and was placed in RN. For measuring 5-HT release from PFC in response to the RN stimulation, RN was stimulated simultaneously with 5-HT-specific scanning from PFC. The parameters of stimulation were 400 \u03bcA 1 ms bipolar square wave pulses, inter-pulse interval 10 ms, number of pulses 100. Stimulation was repeated 5 times at 5 min interval and averages were used for the analysis. Upon completing the acquisition of 5-HT responses, the stimulating electrode was moved to LC and the procedure was repeated, now with applying NE-specific ramp current. Concentrations of 5-HT and NE released from PFC in response to RN and LC stimulations were calculated based on standard curves using interpolating function of Prism 6 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).\nUpon completing FSCV, the animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde; coronal sections of PFC, RN and LC were stained with cresyl violet in order to verify proper placements of the electrodes and the cannulas.\n\n2.9. Data analysis\nOut of a population of approximately 450 chronic epileptic rats, 131 were selected for the study, based on the parameters described in the Methods section (other animals were used for unrelated projects). The study was completed and the results were analyzed in 97 animals with epilepsy. Thirty four animals were excluded at different time points because they presented with more than 5 spontaneous seizures per week. In addition, 41 na\u00efve animals were enrolled as experimental controls. Out of those, 2 rats were removed after FST\n1\nas outliers using Robust regression and outlier removal function of Prism 6 software with the coefficient 5% (i.e. moderately aggressive). Sample sizes are shown in\nTable 1\n.\nTable 1.\nSample sizes for the experiments.\nInjection\nsite\nAgent\nAnimal category\nNaive\nEpilepsy-not\nimpaired\nEpilepsy \u2013\n\u201cdepressed\u201d\nEpilepsy-\n\u201cimpulsive\u201d\nRN\nSaline\n7\n4\n6\n4\nM40\n7\n4\n6\n4\nM871\n7\n4\n6\n4\nM40-\nwashout\n-\n5\n5\n-\nLC\nSaline\n6\n5\n4\n6\nM40\n6\n5\n4\n6\nM871\n6\n5\n4\n6\nTotal\n39\n32\n35\n30\nOpen in a new tab\nData were analyzed using Prism 6 software. P<0.05 was accepted for statistical significance. When determining sample size, we adhered to the 3Rs reduction principle. First, sample sizes sufficient for yielding statistical significance were estimated prospectively using StatMate 2.0 software (GraphPad). The estimates were based on the historical highest standard deviation for immobility (30 s, being the highest among all outcome measures) and its rounded average value (80 s for na\u00efve and 140 s for \u201cdepressed\u201d rats) (\nKumar et al., 2016\n;\nMazarati et al., 2008\n;\nPineda et al., 2014\n) with the goal of achieving a power of 80%. This process yielded 5 animals per group. During the experiment proper, if a sample size reached 4, data were analyzed in order to determine whether further increase of the number of animals to 5-6 would yield statistical differences. If no such prospect was evident, no further studies with the respective treatment were performed."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Animals were housed up to 2 rats per cage in the University of Pittsburgh vivarium with a 12:12 light/dark photoperiod (light on at 7:00 am) and provided food and water\nad libitum\n. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) aged 10\u201314 weeks weighing 275\u2013375 g were utilized in this study.\n\n2.2. Controlled cortical impact\nRats were anesthetized using 4% isoflurane with a 2:1 N\n2\nO/O\n2\nmixture in a ventilated anesthesia chamber. Following endotracheal intubation, the rats were mechanically ventilated with a 2% isoflurane mixture. Animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame in the supine position and body temperature was monitored by rectal thermistor probe and maintained at 37 \u00b0C with a heating pad. Following a midline incision, the soft tissues were reflected. A 7 mm craniotomy was completed between bregma and lambda and centered 5 mm lateral of the sagittal suture to expose the dura mater over the right parietal cortex. Animals were randomly assigned to receive either sham or controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. Sham animals were subjected to all surgical procedures except the induction of the CCI injury. The CCI injury was completed using a small bore (1.975 cm) double-acting stroked-constrained pneumatic cylinder with a 5.0 cm stroke. A beveled impactor tip (6 mm in diameter) was set to produce a tissue deformation of 2.7 mm at a velocity of 4 m/s with a dwell time of 150 msec. Following sham or CCI injury, the scalp was sutured, anesthesia stopped, and the righting time of each animal was monitored and recorded. Once ambulatory, the animals were returned to their home cage.\n\n2.3. Administration of Lithium\nA dose of 1 mmol/ml/kg lithium chloride was selected based upon published reports (\nDash et al., 2011\n;\nYu et al., 2012\n;\nZhu et al., 2010\n). Treatment with lithium chloride (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or vehicle (U.S.P. saline) was initiated at 5 min post-injury by intraperitoneal injection, and continued daily until time of euthanasia at 1, 3, 7, or 14 days post-injury. For assessment of neurobehavioral function only, a dose of 1.5 mmol/ml/kg was evaluated in sham animals to ensure that a higher concentration of lithium was not toxic or impair neurobehavioral performance.\n\n2.4. Vestibular motor function\nA total of 66 rats (\nn\n= 16\u201317 per group) were used to evaluate vestibulomotor function. Beam balance and beam walking assessments were completed on days 1\u20135 post-injury with training completed on day 0 prior to injury. Gross vestibulomotor function was evaluated using a beam balance task in which the animal was placed on a suspended, narrow wooden beam (1.5 cm width) 30 in. above a padded surface. The latency on the beam, up to 60 s, was measured. Three trials per day per animal were performed with a 30 s rest period between trials. The modified beam walking task evaluated finer components of vestibulomotor function and coordination. On the training day, prior to injury, the animal was trained to escape a loud white noise and bright light by traversing the narrow wooden beam (2.5 cm \u00d7 100 cm) to enter a darkened goal box at the opposite end. Four pegs (4 cm high and 3 mm diameter) were equally spaced along the center of the beam to increase task difficulty. If the rats fell off the beam or did not cross in the allotted 60 s, the noise and light were stopped and the rat was placed in the goal box. Average latency to traverse the beam for three trials per day was measured.\n\n2.5. Spatial learning\nThe rats subjected to vestibulomotor testing were also evaluated for spatial learning and retention of spatial memory. Spatial learning was evaluated using the Morris water maze task using a video-tracking system (AnyMaze, Stoelting, Inc. Wood Dale, IL) as previously described (\nDixon et al., 2016\n). A circular tank (180 cm diameter and 45 cm high) was filled with 26 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C water to a height of 30 cm to conceal a transparent circular platform (10 cm diameter and 29 cm high) located in a fixed position in the tank at a distance of 45 cm from the wall. Visual cues outside of the maze aided the rat in locating the escape platform. Animals underwent testing beginning on day 10 post-injury, without previous training or exposure to the MWM. Testing continued for 4 consecutive days (10\u201313 days post-injury) with each animal completing 4 trials per day. Rats were randomly placed in the water against the tank wall, and released to freely swim in the tank to find the hidden platform, for a maximum of 120 s. If the animal was unable to locate the platform within the designated time, it was manually directed to the platform. The animal remained on the platform for 30 s and then was placed into an incubator between trials. Following a 4 min intertrial interval, the animal was returned to the maze for the next trial. On day 14 post-injury, the animal was tested using a probe trial paradigm in which the hidden platform was removed. The location of the hidden platform was designated as the target quadrant. The number of entries, latency to first entry, and distance to first entry in the target quadrant were assessed.\n\n2.6. Assessment of cortical contusion volume\nA total of 24 randomly selected rats (\nn\n= 6 per group) received an overdose of Fatalplus (intraperitoneally, 100 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital) at 14 days post-injury following assessment of spatial memory. Animals were transcardially perfused with saline, followed by a mixture of 10% neutral-buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The brains were processed, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 \u03bcm thick coronal sections at every 1 mm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Brain hemispheric tissue loss was calculated by measuring ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheric areas of each slice, then multiplying the slice areas by the slice interval thickness and summing all slices, as previously described (\nDixon et al., 2016\n). Ipsilateral tissue loss is expressed as percent contralateral and calculated as follows: (contralateral-ipsilateral)/contralateral \u00d7 100.\n\n2.7. Tissue preparation for Western blot analysis\nA total of 96 rats (\nn\n= 6 per group at each time point) received an overdose of Fatal-plus (100 mg/kg sodium pentoparbital) and the brains dissected at 1, 3, 7, or 14 days post-injury. In the current study, we expanded upon previous findings (\nCarlson et al., 2016\n) to include a 3 day time point to gain a better understanding of potential acute changes after CCI. Animals subjected to behavioral testing were not utilized for immunoblotting in order to eliminate possible confounds of behavioral testing on protein abundance. After removal of the brain, the ipsilateral hippocampus was rapidly dissected on a chilled ice plate, immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Hippocampal samples were homogenized in lysis buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 0.01 M Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 0.001 M EDTA) with protease inhibitor cocktail kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The homogenized whole cell samples were centrifuged at 12,000 \u00d7\ng\nat 4 \u00b0C for 10 min and the supernatants collected. The protein concentration was determined by a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) using a 96-well microplate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT).\n\n2.8. Immunoblotting\nTo assess the abundance of monomeric SNARE proteins in the hippocampus, whole cell lysates were boiled for 10 min prior to SDS-PAGE. SNARE complex abundance was assessed in unboiled protein samples to retain high molecular weight complexes and were defined as SNAP-25 immunoreactive material >50 kDa that was absent from boiled samples as previously described (\nCarlson et al., 2016\n;\nChandra et al., 2005\n). Protein samples (20 \u03bcg) and molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) were separated using SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The blots were incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk in tris-buffered saline (blocking solution) for 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The primary antibodies utilized were: rabbit anti-CSP\u03b1 (Thermo-Fisher, Rockford, IL), mouse anti-SNAP-25 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA), mouse anti-syntaxin-1 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), rabbit anti-VAMP2 (Millipore, Temecula, CA), mouse anti-\u03b1-synuclein (BD Transduction, San Jose, CA), rabbit anti-synaptophysin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and mouse anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). The following day, the membranes were washed with 1\u00d7 TBS buffer, incubated in blocking solution containing directly conjugated horse radish peroxidase secondary antibodies for 1 h. Proteins were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection system (Supersignal, Pierce). To normalize for protein content, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with mouse anti-\u03b2 actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Sham and CCI-injured samples for both treatment groups were loaded in the same gel for comparison. Blots were imaged with the Chemidoc Imager (BioRad). Optical density of each protein of interest was measured using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). The optical density of \u03b2-actin was measured for each lane and used for normalization for each sample. Values are presented as the ratio of optical densities of samples as a percentage of sham-injured vehicle-treatment for each time point. Data are expressed as the group means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM).\n\n2.9. Statistical analyses\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical comparisons of beam balance latency and beam walking latency were completed using a repeated measures one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests, when appropriate. Statistical comparison of spatial learning was completed using a two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests, when appropriate. Probe trial metrics were compared using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests, when appropriate. Immunoblot data were compared at each time point using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test, when appropriate. The\np\nvalues reported in the text are the results of the post-hoc analyses, unless stated. Statistical tests were completed using Graphpad (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA). A\np\nvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests."

    "Methods": "Neuron culture\nDorsal root ganglia (DRG) from 8\u201310 week old male C57Bl/6J mice (Jackson labs) were dissected into cold HBSS (Life Technologies) containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies) and dissociated in 1 mg/mL Collagenase A + 2.4 U/mL dispase II (Roche) for 70 min at 37\u00b0C, followed by 5 min in 0.25% trypsin (Life Technologies) at 37\u00b0C. After addition of trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) and washes, DRG were triturated using glass pasteur pipettes of decreasing size in the presence of 125U DNAse I (Sigma) and centrifuged through 10% BSA (Sigma). The cell pellet was washed and then resuspended in Neurobasal A (Life Technologies) with 2% B27 (Life Technologies), 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin, 1 mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies), 100 ng/\u03bcl NGF (Life Technologies), and 2 ng/\u03bcl GDNF (Sigma). 12\u201318 \u00d7 10\n3\nneurons/well were plated on acid washed glass coverslips (Bellco Glass) in a 24-well plate that had been coated overnight with 100 \u03bcg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma) at room temperature and 10 \u03bcg/ml laminin (Life Technologies) for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C. Beginning on DIV 1, 10 \u03bcM AraC (Sigma) was added to media.\nHippocampal neurons were isolated from embryonic day 18 rats (Charles River) as previously described (\n61\n), and plated at 8 \u00d7 10\n4\n/well in a 24-well plate on acid washed coverslips that had been coated overnight at room temperature with 20 \u03bcg/ml poly-L-ornithine (Sigma) and 3.5 \u03bcg/ml laminin. Cells were cultured in Neurobasal with 2% B27, supplemented with L-glutamine and penicillin-streptomycin.\n\nSpot-Groove Culture\nTo grow straight axons for live imaging of distal axon endings, an optical-quality 24-well plate (Ibidi) was coated with poly-d-lysine and laminin as described above for DRG neuron culture. After coating, grooves were etched into each well using a pin rake (Tyler Research). DRG from 8\u201310 week old male mice were dissected and dissociated as described above and spotted in the center of the grooves at 15 \u00d7 10\n3\ncells/well in 7 \u03bcl of media. After allowing cells to attach for 1 hr in the incubator, media (Neurobasal A, 2% B27, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin, 1 mM L-glutamine, 100 ng/\u03bcl NGF, 2 ng/\u03bcl GDNF) was slowly added. Beginning on DIV 1, 10 \u03bcM AraC was added to media. For live imaging of distal axons, cultures were infected with GFP-ires-GFP lentivirus at DIV 0, and cultures were grown for 6 DIV before treatment with paclitaxel.\n\nMicrofluidic devices\nAcid washed coverslips (Warner Instruments 24\u00d750 mm) were coated with 100 \u03bcg/ml poly-d-lysine overnight at room temperature. After washes with ddH\n2\nO, TCND500 microfluidic devices (Xona Microfluidics) were attached to coverslips, and laminin was added to the channels at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml for 3 hr at 37\u00b0C. DRG from 8\u201310 week old male mice were dissected and dissociated as described above and plated at 8 \u00d7 10\n4\ncells/microfluidic device in 5 \u03bcl of media. After allowing cells to attach for 55 min in the incubator, media (Neurobasal A, 2% B27, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin, 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 ng/\u03bcl NGF, 1 ng/\u03bcl GDNF) was added slowly to the cell body wells. A portion of the cells in each device washed away when media was added. Media with 100 ng/\u03bcl NGF and 2 ng/\u03bcl GDNF was added to the axonal wells. Starting on DIV 1, 10 \u03bcM AraC was added to media. Media was changed every 2 days until DIV 6, when axons were treated with paclitaxel. Paclitaxel-containing media was replenished after 1 day.\n\nConstructs and Compounds\nThe following lentiviral constructs were used in this study: EB3-GFP (\n62\n), and TTLL1-specific shRNA and control vector (Rogowski et al., 2010). TTL-ires-GFP, which was generated by cloning the coding sequence of human TTL from cDNA (GenBank\nBC036819\n) into pHAGE-CMV-ires-GFP (\n63\n). GFP-ires-GFP was used as a control plasmid. Mito-dsRed-ires-GFP, which was generated by cloning Mito-dsRed (Clontech) into pHAGE-CMV-ires-GFP. LAMP1-RFP-2A-GFP, which was generated by cloning LAMP1-RFP (Addgene #1817) into pLenti-CMV-2A-GFP (gift from C. Woolf).\nPaclitaxel (Sigma), (\u2212)-Epothilone B (Sigma) and Tubacin (Enzo Life Sciences) were kept as stocks in DMSO and were diluted in culture medium immediately prior to addition to cells. Control cultures always received an equivalent amount of DMSO.\n\nLentivirus preparation\nLentiviral particles were produced by cotransfection of lentiviral expression vectors with packaging helper plasmids into HEK293T cells plated in 15 cm\n2\ndishes. Media containing viral particles was collected 48 and 72 hr after transfection. After filtration through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter, lentiviral particles were concentrated by spinning at 25,900 RPM at 4\u00b0C for 90 min (SW 32 Ti rotor, Beckman Coulter). The resulting viral pellet was resuspended in PBS/0.001% Pluronic F68 (Sigma), concentrating 800-fold from the packaging cell media, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Lentivirus was added to 250 \u03bcL culture media 3\u20134 hr after plating, and media was changed 16\u201318 hr later. Expression of fluorescent protein in the neuron cell body was used to monitor lentivirus expression.\n\nImmunoflourescence\nDRG neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% triton-X in PBS for 10 min, and blocked in 15% goat serum/1% BSA/0.1% triton-X in PBS. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in block and incubated for 1 hr each at room temperature. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-\u03b2III tubulin (1:800, Sigma), rabbit anti-TUJ1 (1:1000; Covance), chicken anti-GFP (1:500; Aves Labs), mouse anti-glutamylated tubulin GT335 (1:3000; AdipoGen), mouse anti-acetylated tubulin 6-11B-1 (1:1000; Sigma), rat anti-tyrosinated tubulin YL1/2 (1:1000; Abcam), rabbit-anti Tom20 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The following secondary antibodies were used at 1:500: AlexaFluor-488 anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-chicken, AlexaFluor-568 anti-rabbit, AlexaFluor-647 anti-mouse (Invitrogen), Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse, Cy5-conjugated anti-rat (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Images of fixed cells were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse E800, or when fluorescence was to be quantified, a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope.\n\nSoluble tubulin and actin extraction assay\nDissociated DRG were cultured directly on poly-d-lysine and laminin coated 24-well plates. After a wash with warm PBS, soluble protein was extracted by adding 100 \u03bcl microtubule stabilizing buffer (80 mM PIPES pH 6.8, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM EGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5% triton-X) containing 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem) at 1:500 for 2 min at 37\u00b0C. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000\ng\nfor 10 min at 4\u00b0C, the supernatants were collected and Laemmli buffer was added to 1x. An equal volume of each sample was run for Western blot analysis.\n\nWestern blotting\nProtein lysates were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and blotted with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-TUJ1 (1:2500; Covance), mouse anti-\u03b2-actin AC-74 (1:5000; Sigma), mouse anti-glutamylated tubulin GT335 (1:2000; AdipoGen). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and SuperSignal West Dura (Thermo Scientific) were used for chemiluminescent detection.\nFor assessing levels of glutamylated tubulin in DRG cultures, cells grown directly on poly-d-lysine and laminin coated 24-well plates were lysed in 1X Laemmli sample buffer and an equal volume of each sample was loaded onto the SDS-PAGE gel.\n\nLive cell time lapse imaging acquisition and quantification\nFor live cell imaging of transport of mitochondria or late endosomes/lysosomes in DRG neurons, coverslips were transferred to petri dishes containing Hibernate A (BrainBits), with 2% B27 and 2 mM Glutamax (Life Technologies). DMSO or paclitaxel was added to the imaging media at the same concentration as was present in the growth media. Time lapse movies were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope using a 63\u00d7/N.A.0.90 water IR-Achroplan objective. Cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C on a temperature-controlled stage (PeCon, GmbH). For imaging of mitochondria and late endosomes/lysosomes, portions of axon 100 \u03bcm long were selected and traced at least 500 \u03bcm away from the cell body using the GFP signal. Mitochondria were imaged at 1 frame/1.58 sec for 5 min, and late endosomes/lysosomes for 3 min. EB3-GFP was imaged at 1 frame/3.9 sec for 3 min. Live imaging of mitochondria and late endosomes/lysosomes was performed on DIV 4 and 6, and imaging of EB3-GFP was performed on DIV 4.\nThe mitochondrial movement parameters \u201cpercent time in motion per axon\u201d and \u201caverage speed per mitochondrion\u201d were quantified in ImageJ. Kymographs were generated from time lapse movies after running the Image Stabilizer plugin when necessary and mitochondria tracks were analyzed by manual tracing using a custom macro, Kymolyzer, as previously described (\n64\n). The percentage of time mitochondria were in anterograde or retrograde motion per axon was calculated by averaging the percent of frames in a trace for which each mitochondrion moved (ranging from 0\u2013100%) in a kymograph. An average speed for each mitochondrion was calculated as the average of all instantaneous speeds in a trace that were not zero. The overall average was then calculated using the data from each mitochondrion. Movement slower than 0.05\u03bcm/sec was considered zero.\nTo determine lysosome flux, a vertical line was drawn near the center of the generated kymograph, and the number of tracks crossing the line in the anterograde and retrograde direction were counted.\nFor live imaging of axon growth in spot-groove cultures, DIV 6 DRG neurons were treated with paclitaxel or DMSO vehicle in phenol red-free complete growth media. Images of axon endings expressing GFP were acquired using the 40\u00d7 objective on a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope with an environmental chamber. Axon fields for imaging were selected prior to paclitaxel treatment, and the same axon fields were imaged 2.5, 14 and 38 hr after paclitaxel treatment for 100\u2013120 min, with an image captured every 20 min. Axon tips analyzed for growth were selected prior to visualizing the movies, and a line was drawn using ImageJ at the point reached by the axon tip at t=0 for each imaging session. The distance of the axon tip from this line was measured at each 20 min interval of the 100\u2013120 min imaging period.\nFor live imaging of axon growth in microfluidic chambers, DIC images of axons in the distal channel were acquired using a 40\u00d7 objective on a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope with an environmental chamber. Multiple fields containing axonal endings were imaged repeatedly every 20 min for 120 min. Distal axon growth was analyzed as described above for spot-groove cultures.\n\nImage analysis\nTo quantify changes in levels of modified tubulin by immunofluorescence, maximum intensity projections were created of images taken with a 63\u00d7 objective using identical imaging settings. To limit quantification of fluorescence to neuronal cells and to remove background, using ImageJ, the Huang threshold was applied to the \u03b2III tubulin staining, and the mean intensity of acetylated, glutamylated, tyrosinated, or \u03b2III tubulin within the thresholded \u03b2III tubulin outline was calculated. The intensity from modified tubulin was divided by the \u03b2III tubulin intensity for each condition. The average value from 3\u20134 imaging fields for each condition from each experiment was used for statistical analysis.\nThe number of retraction bulb-like swellings and the number of cell bodies per field was counted manually from images taken with a 10\u00d7 or 20\u00d7 objective using the Cell Counter plugin in ImageJ.\nNeurite area per field was quantified with ImageJ from images taken with a 20\u00d7 objective using a macro based on Pani et al. (\n65\n) for assessing neurite area in dense cultures with both dim and bright neurites. In summary, after background subtraction, contrast enhancement, and application of a Gaussian blur filter, cell bodies were deleted manually from the image. Next, edges were enhanced using the FeatureJ Laplacian plugin. After contrast enhancement and application of the Moments threshold, a mask was created, and the analyze particles function (size: 50-infinity) was used to determine the area of the axon. For axon area and retraction bulb quantification, 4\u20136 imaging fields per coverslip and 2 coverslips from each condition were quantified per experiment, and the average value from each experiment was used for statistical analysis.\n\nStatistics\nData are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6. The unpaired Student\u2019s\nt\ntest or the Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest was used assess the statistical significance of differences between conditions. For multiple comparisons, data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction or Dunnett\u2019s post test. p<0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nThe University of Texas at Dallas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all procedures. Female Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River), weighing 310 \u00b1 11g, were used in all experiments. Rats were housed in a 12:12 hr reversed light cycle environment with ad libitum access to food and water.\n\nSurgical Procedures\nRats were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (80 mg/kg, i.p.) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Supplemental doses were administered as needed to maintain anesthesia throughout surgical procedures and data collection. Carprofen (5mg/kg, s.c.) was administered to reduce inflammation. Body temperature was maintained throughout surgery and neural recording using a feedback-controlled electric warming pad (FHC, Bowdoin, ME). Subjects were implanted with a custom made platinum-iridium bipolar stimulating cuff electrode on the left cervical vagus nerve, as previously described (\nEngineer et al., 2011\n,\nKhodaparast et al., 2013\n,\nKhodaparast et al., 2014\n,\nHays et al., 2014\n,\nPruitt et al., 2016\n,\nKhodaparast et al., 2016\n,\nHays et al., 2016\n,\nHulsey et al., 2016\n). A transient drop in blood oxygen saturation in response to a short (~3 sec) VNS train was used to confirm that the cuff electrode was functional. Immediately after cuff implantation, subjects were positioned in a stereotaxic frame with bregma and lambda level. After exposing the surface of the skull, a hole was drilled centered at 1.1mm lateral and 3.6mm caudal to lambda and the underlying dura was carefully removed (\nGeorge et al., 2013\n).\n\nElectrophysiological Recordings in LC and Me5\nExtracellular recording was performed with parylene coated tungsten microelectrodes (2\u20134 M\u03a9, FHC). Two electrodes (250 \u03bcm spacing) were lowered approximately 5.5\u20136.5 mm ventral from the dural surface at a 15 degree angle from the vertical axis until neural activity with appropriate response characteristics (described below) was observed. Neural signals were differentially amplified using an RA16PA preamplifier (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL) from a common reference and ground attached to the skin around the skull. Signals were digitized at 24.414 ks/s with 16-bit resolution using an RZ5 BioAmp processor (Tucker-Davis Technologies) and monitored online with Brainware. LC units were identified by a characteristic response to a hindpaw pinch of a phasic burst of spikes followed by inhibition, long duration positive-negative waveforms with a notch on the ascending phase, and spontaneous firing rate (\nMartins and Froemke., 2015\n) (\nFig. 1\n). The Me5 nucleus is located lateral to the LC and was identified by high frequency firing, accompanied by burst firing upon manipulation of the jaw (\nLinden., 1978\n) (\nFig. 6A\n). Multi-unit recordings were made at sites identified as LC or Me5. Electrophysiological recording sweeps were 4.5 s in duration, and were initiated every 8 s (except as noted). One second of spontaneous activity was recorded prior to VNS presentation. A subset of recording sites contained readily identifiable single units. After complete stimulus set presentation at a site, the electrodes were advanced at least 100 \u03bcm and a new recording site was identified. In a subset of animals, electrolytic lesions were made at the final recording location to confirm electrode position (\nFig 1D\n).\nFig. 1. Identification of neurons in locus coeruleus.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Recording sites in the LC were characterized by a brief increase in firing rate followed by a suppression in response to a hindpaw pinch (denoted by line below panel).

Bold black line represents group average across sites. Thin gray lines represent data from individual sites. *** p < 0.001; all statistical comparisons versus 0 mA (spontaneous rate).\n\nVagus Nerve Stimulation\nVNS was delivered through a constant current stimulus isolation unit (Model 2200, A-M Systems). The vagus nerve was stimulated at standard parameters of sixteen 0.8 mA 100 \u03bcs biphasic pulses at 30 Hz (\nEngineer et al., 2011\n,\nPorter et al., 2011\n,\nBorland et al., 2016\n,\nHulsey et al., 2016\n). In addition, a broad stimulus set was delivered with varying pulse number per train (0 \u2013 64 pulses), stimulation current intensity (0 \u2013 2.5 mA), pulse frequency (0 \u2013 120 Hz), and pulse width (0 \u2013 500 \u03bcs) totaling 23 distinct stimulation parameters (\nTables 1\n\u2013\n3\n). Every VNS parameter was presented 20 times in a pseudorandom, interleaved order at each recording site. The main recording protocol lasted approximately 40 minutes at each site. At a subset of sites, standard parameter stimulation was delivered with 5 and 30 second inter-train intervals. Cuff voltage was monitored throughout data collection procedures.\nTable 1.\nRange of Pulse Numbers Tested\nIntensity (mA)\nPulse Width (\u03bcs)\nNumber of pulses\nFrequency (Hz)\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.8\n100\n4\n30\n0.8\n100\n16\n30\n0.8\n100\n64\n30\nOpen in a new tab\nStandard parameters are represented in bold text\nTable 3.\nRange of Frequencies Tested\nIntensity (mA)\nPulse Width (\u03bcs)\nNumber of pulses\nFrequency (Hz)\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.8\n100\n16\n7.5\n0.8\n100\n16\n15\n0.8\n100\n16\n30\n0.8\n100\n16\n60\n0.8\n100\n16\n120\nOpen in a new tab\nStandard parameters are represented in bold text\n\nData Analysis and Statistical Methods\nData was processed using custom MATLAB software (MathWorks). Electrical stimulation artifact was removed from data by linearly interpolating between data points 0.2 ms before and 3 ms after each pulse in a VNS train. The neural signal was bi-directionally band pass filtered between 300\u20133000Hz. Spike activity for multiunit responses were automatically detected by positive crossings of a threshold initially set at 2.58 times greater than the standard deviation (99 percent confidence interval) of the signal for the entire stimulus set and adjusted as necessary to distinguish spiking activity. Spike data was sorted by VNS parameter and a mean peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) was generated with 50 ms bins. Firing rate in Hz was calculated by summing all spikes per 50 ms bin and dividing by bin time in seconds. Phasic excitatory responses were calculated as driven spikes (sum of spikes at a given parameter \u2013 sum spontaneous spikes) from 1\u2013750 ms after stimulation onset for all 500 ms VNS trains. An offset response was calculated from 751\u20131500ms as percent change from the spontaneous rate. For experiments evaluating the effects of varying VNS frequency, driven spikes were calculated based on positive response periods for each stimulus. Spike data during stimulation artifact cutout was interpolated to normalize cutout duration across frequencies. A cycle histogram of spiking activity after each pulse was created and vector strength calculations were used to quantify the degree of synchronization between VNS pulse timing and neural spiking activity (\nShetake et al., 2011\n). For vector strength analysis, a value of 1 indicates perfect synchronization and 0 indicates no synchronization to VNS pulses. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by paired t-tests (Bonferroni corrected to an alpha of 0.007) were used where appropriate to determine significant differences.\n\nHistology\nUpon completion of daily recording, an electrolytic lesion was made by delivering current through one of the electrodes at the final recording site (1 mA current, 30 s). Immediately after electrolytic lesion, animals were transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Brains were post-fixed for at least 24 hours and transferred to 20% sucrose solution for cryoprotection. The extent of the LC was sectioned with 40 \u03bcm sections. Sections were stained for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to identify the LC. In brief, sections were incubated in a permeabilization buffer of 0.3% triton in PBS, followed by a quenching solution of 0.3% H\n2\nO\n2\nin methanol. After washing in PBS, sections were incubated in a blocking solution of 5% normal horse serum at room temperature for 1 hour. Tissue was then transferred to primary TH antibody (Cat # AB152, EMD Millipore) at a 1:1000 dilution and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The following day, sections were processed with horseradish peroxidase substrate (Vectastain ABC Elite, Vectorlabs) and stained with diaminobenzidine (ImmPACT DAB, Vectorlabs). Sections were then mounted on microscope slides dried, and cover slipped using DPX mounting medium (Cat #13512, EMS). TH staining and lesions were visualized using an Olympus BX51 microscope and imaged at 4x magnification using an Olympus DP71 acquisition system."

    "Methods": "2.1 Animals\nThe\nScn8a\nN1768D/+\nknock-in mouse was previously generated by TALEN targeting (\nJones and Meisler, 2014\n). The initial characterization was carried out on the congenic line B6.\nScn8a\nN1768D\n(\nWagnon et al., 2015\n). To improve litter size and reproductive performance, we also backcrossed the N1768D mutation to strain C3HeB/FeJ to generate a second congenic line, C3H.\nScn8a\nN1768D\n. All samples for this study were from the second congenic line, C3H.\nScn8a\nN1768D\n. The samples for RNA-seq and qRT-PCR included pre-seizure D/+ mice (mean age=6 weeks, n=3) and +/+ littermate controls (n=3), post-seizure D/+ (14 weeks, n=6) and +/+ littermate controls (n=3), and non-seizure D/+(35 weeks, n=2) and +/+ littermate controls (n=2) . As described previously, seizures in these mice have duration of 0.5 to 3 min with onset between 2 and 4 months of age, and occur in 50% of the heterozygous D/+ mice (\nWagnon et al, 2015\n). Death typically occurs within 1 to 3 days after onset. The first seizure is immediately followed by 4 sequelae: tremor, hunched posture, nonresponsiveness to stimuli, and periods of immobility lasting for more than 30 minutes. For this study, D/+ mice were examined every day beginning at 6 weeks of age. For inclusion in the post-seizure group, we required that the mice exhibit none of the four indicators of seizures on the previous day and exhibit seizures as well as all four indicators of seizure activity on the day of sample collection. The samples were thus processed within 24 hours of the first seizure.\n\n2.2 RNA preparation\nTotal RNA was isolated from dissected forebrain (cerebral cortex plus hippocampus), cerebellum, and brainstem from D/+ mice and +/+ littermate controls using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies). RNA samples were assessed for quality with the High Sensitivity RNA Analysis Kit (Advanced Analytics Fragment Analyzer). RNA concentration was determined using the Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA Assay Kit (Molecular Probes).\n\n2.3 RNA-Seq\nLibraries were constructed using a stranded mRNA-Seq Kit (KapaBiosystems TDS KR0960 \u2013 v3.15). Average fragment size was assessed with the Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytics). Concentration was determined with the Illumina Universal Adaptor-specific qPCR kit (Kapa Biosystems). Equimolar samples were pooled and clustered for sequencing on the HiSeq2500(Illumina). Sequencing was performed using Rapid-Run SBS 2\u00d7100bp chemistry (Illumina).\n\n2.4 Sequence analysis\nSample data was demultiplexed, trimmed and quality filtered using Trimmomatic (USADelLab). Fastq files were splice aligned against the NCBIM37 reference genome using Tophat version 2.0.13 running atop Bowtie version 2.2.4. Gene expression counts were obtained using htseq-count version 0.6.1. Both splice alignment and counting were performed with Ensembl Annotation of the NCBIM37 reference genome and raw counts analyzed with DESeq2 version 1.10.1. Results generated by DESeq2 comparing postseizure samples with the age-matched +/+ littermate controls identified 65 transcripts with logarithm of odds (LOD) absolute value of expression change \u2265 3.0, among which 50 were up-regulated and 15 were down-regulated.\n\n2.5 Principal component and heat map analysis\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was performed with the plotPCA function using expression counts previously transformed to the log2 scale with the rlogTransformation for the 469 genes with \u22652-fold differential expression between post-seizure D/+ mice (n-4) and wildtype controls (n=3). This plot was also used to check for batch effects and to create a count matrix within DESeq2 producing a PCA plot of the first two principal components. To add information about other non-seizure mice, we projected the coordinates for each individual onto the first two principal components based on variation in expression at the same 469 loci.\nValues of the same logarithm transformed expression counts for the 65 genes with\n\u22653-fold\nchange in transcript abundance were used to generate heatmap plots using the heatmap.2 function from the gplots R package.\n\n2.6 Differential expression analysis\nDifferential expression was analyzed in DESeq2, version 1.10.1, in R using the workflow described in sections 1.2 and 1.3 of the DESeq2 manual (DESeq2 reference manual:\nhttp://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.13/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.pdf\n)\n\n2.7 Pathway analysis\nThe output of DESeq2 was inputted into QIAGEN\u2019s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software, version 01-01 (IPA\u00ae, QIAGEN Redwood City,\nwww.qiagen.com/ingenuity\n). The 65 genes with \u22653-fold change in transcript abundance were submitted for IPA\u2019s Core Analysis functionality and a regulator network was generated using IPA's Regulator Effects algorithm.\n\n2.8 Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)\ncDNA was generated from the forebrain RNA samples with the SuperScript III kit (Life Technologies). Taqman probes were obtained from Life Technologies for the genes\nPtx3, Gal , Npw, Cdkn1a, Gldn, Serpina3n, Drd4, Mt2, Vim, Gfap,\nand\nHif3a\n. Probe set IDs are provided in\nTable S1\n. Taqman reactions were performed in 15 uL reaction volumes using the Taqman Fast Advance Master Mix. All reactions were run in triplicate on an ABI 7900HT using the SDS 2.4 software (Life Technologies) with ABI384 well Optical PCR plates and AB-1170 Optical PCR film (Fisher Scientific). All samples were run with the endogenous control GAPDH probe set (Life Technologies #Mm99999915_g1). Differential expression analysis was performed using the standard delta-delta CT method (\nLivak and Schmittgen, 2001\n). Transcript expression levels were normalized to the average expression of the transcript in wildtype littermate control mice.\n\n2.9 Immunostaining\nBrains were fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (8 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 1.5 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 137 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl pH 7.3), rinsed in PBS and stored at 4\u00b0C in 40% sucrose (w/v) in PBS. Frozen sagittal sections (20 \u00b5m) were rinsed in Tris buffered saline (TBS) (25 mM Tris, 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl pH 7.5) followed by blocking and permeablization for one hour in 10% normal goat serum in TBS with 0.2% Triton X-100. Sections were immunostained at 4\u00b0C overnight with mouse anti-GFAP Cy3-conjugated antibody (Sigma-Aldrich. Clone G A 5) diluted 1:400 in TBS containing 5% normal goat serum and 0.05% Triton X-100. Sections were rinsed with TBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and incubated for 30 min in 1:500 DAPI in TBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100. This protocol resulted in very low background staining. Stained sections were imaged with the 10x objective on a Nikon A1R confocal microscope. Tiled images were combined in Adobe Illustrator."

GCGR antagonist des-His1-[Glu9]-Glucagon (1-29) amide was purchased from Tocris (Minneapolis, MN). The kinase inhibitors, H89, LY294002 and U0126 were purchased from Calbiochem (Gibbstown, NJ). All other reagents were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), unless otherwise stated.\n\nCell culture\nSH-SY5Y cells, obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassa, VA), and SH-hGLP-1R#9 cells, a human GLP-1R over-expressing cell line derived from SH-SY5Y cells were maintained as described previously (\nLi et al., 2010b\n). Primary cultures of cortical neurons (PCN) were prepared from embryonic day 15 Sprague-Dawley rats in accordance with approved procedures by the Animal Care and Usage Committee of the National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan, and were cultured as previously described (\nHoward et al., 2008\n;\nYu et al., 2016\n). They were maintained and evaluated from 10 day in vitro (DIV) onward. Briefly, brain cortices from E15 embryos were pooled and digested for 20 min in 0.05% trypsin-ETDA (0.2% (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 37\u00b0C, 1 ml/embryo). Cortices were triturated and then diluted into plating media (Neurobasal media (Invitrogen) containing 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 0.5 mM l-glutamate with and without antioxidants (AO) supplement (on DIV 3 and 5 (with AO) and DIV 7 and 10 (without AO)) at 2 ml/embryo. Following evaluation of viability, cells were then plated at 5\u00d710\n4\nviable cells/well in 0.2 ml plating media into 96 well plates pre-coated with 0.15-0.2% polyethyleneimine in 150mM sodium borate, pH 8.5 (Sigma-Aldrich). Plated cells were maintained in a 37\u00b0C humidified incubator with 5.5% CO\n2\n, and fed by 50% media exchange on DIV3, 5, 7 and 10 with feed media.\n\nCell viability assays\nCell viability was assessed via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay performed in 96-well plates. Cells were serum-starved (with 0.5% of serum) overnight before pretreatment with various concentrations of OXM for 1 h. Cells were then exposed to different concentrations of glutamate or H\n2\nO\n2\nfor either 24 h or 48 h, time points selected from prior studies. Glutamate concentrations were selected from concentration-dependent pilot studies focused to provide a statistically significant but submaximal loss of viability. A CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) was utilized to measure a formazan product, which is directly proportional to the cell viability.\n\ncAMP assay\nCells grown in 24-well plates were first serum-starved overnight and then treated with various concentrations of OXM (10\n-9\n, 10\n-8\n, 10\n-7\nM) in serum-free media for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then lysed with 0.1 M HCl containing 0.5% Triton x-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Cell lysates were collected and centrifuged at 600g at room temperature to remove cell debris. Supernatants were directly used for cAMP measurement. Intracellular cAMP content was determined using the Direct cAMP ELISA kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Inc., Farmingdale, NY), as per the manufacturer's protocol for the acetylated version.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nAt 48 h after drug treatment, PCN cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 h at room temperature. After removing the 4% PFA solution, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the fixed cells were treated with blocking solution (2 % BSA, 0.1 % Triton X-100, and 5 % goat serum in PBS) for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against MAP2 (1:500; Millipore, Billerica, MA) for 1 day at 4 \u00b0C. The cells were next rinsed three times in PBS and treated with a secondary antibody (AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-mouse Ab, 1:500, Invitrogen, Carslbad, CA). Images were acquired using a monochrome camera Qil-mc (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI) attached to a NIKON TE2000 inverted microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY). Data were analyzed using NIS Elements AR 3.2 Software (Nikon).\n\nWestern Blotting\nCells grown in 100 mm-plates at a density of approximately 5 \u00d7 10\n6\ncells were used to extract total protein. Standard Western Blotting procedure was used with approximately 50 \u03bcg of protein extracts for all samples. cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) and phospo-CREB (pCREB) antibodies from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA) were used at a dilution of 1:1000. Glucagon receptor antibody from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO) was used at a dilution of 1:500. \u03b1-tubulin antibody from Sigma was used at a dilution of 1:5000. Densitometric quantification of the protein bands was performed using a PC version of NIH IMAGE (ImageJ software).\n\nAnimals and drug administration\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used and treated in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996) on protocols approved by the Animal Care and Usage Committee of the National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan. Briefly, animals were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (0.4 g/kg, i.p.). As a proof of concept, following randomization of animals into groups, either OXM (20 \u03bcg in 20 \u03bcl sterile physiological saline per rat) or vehicle (20 \u03bcl sterile physiological saline per rat) was given intracerebroventricularly through a 25 \u03bcl Hamilton syringe 15 min before a 60 min MCAo. The coordinates for intracerebroventricular injections were: 0.8 mm posterior to the bregma; 1.5 mm lateral to the midline; 3.5 mm below the dura surface. The speed of injection was controlled by a syringe pump at a rate of 2.5 \u03bcl per min. The needle was retained in place for 5 min after injection. After injection, a piece of bone wax (W810, Ethicon) was applied to the skull defect to prevent leakage of the solution.\n\nMCA ligation\nThe right middle cerebral artery (MCA) was transiently occluded as previously described (\nLuo et al., 2009\n). In brief, the bilateral common carotids (CCAs) were ligated with nontraumatic arterial clips. A craniotomy of about 2 \u00d7 2 mm\n2\nwas made in the right squamosal bone. The right MCA was ligated with a 10-O suture, as previously described (\nLuo et al., 2009\n), to generate focal infarction in the cerebral cortex. The ligature and clips were removed after 60 min ischemia to generate reperfusional injury. Core body temperature was monitored with a thermistor probe and maintained at 37 \u00b0C with a heating pad during anesthesia. After recovery from anesthesia, body temperature was maintained at 37 \u00b0C using a temperature-controlled incubator. Immediately after recovery from anesthesia, an elevated body swing test was used to evaluate the success of MCAo surgery, and animals were randomized between treatment vs. vehicle groups.\n\nBehavioral assay\nAnimals were placed in an Accuscan activity monitor (Columbus, OH) for 24 h at 2 days after MCAo for behavioral recording, as previously described (\nShen and Wang, 2010\n). The monitor contains 16 horizontal infrared sensors spaced 2.5 cm apart. Each animal was placed in a 42 \u00d7 42 \u00d7 31 cm plexiglass open box. Food and water were provided. Motor activity was calculated using the number of beams broken by the animals.\n\nTriphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining\nThree days after MCAo, animals were culled by decapitation. The brains were removed, immersed in cold saline for 5 minutes, and sliced into 2.0 mm thick sections. The brain slices were incubated in 2% TTC (Sigma), dissolved in normal saline for 10 minutes at room temperature, and then transferred into a 5% formaldehyde solution for fixation. The area of infarction on each brain slice was measured double blind using a digital scanner and the Image Tools program (University of Texas Health Sciences Center, San Antonio, TX).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error mean (SEM) and were analyzed by Prism software. One-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests are used for comparison of multiple samples, followed by post hoc tests (Newman-Keuls test and Dunnetts test). *P <0.05, **P <0.01, ***P <0.001."

The culture plating medium comprised of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium/F12, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1 mM\nl\n-glutamine and 2% B27 (Invitrogen). Cultures were then maintained at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air, and were fed by exchanging 50% of media with feed media (Neurobasal medium, Invitrogen) with 0.5 mM\nl\n-glutamate and 2% B27 with antioxidants supplement on DIV (days in vitro) 3 and 5.\n\n2.3. cAMP Assays\nAll cAMP assays were performed using 24-well plates containing 500 \u00b5L of cells in normal medium at a concentration of 280 \u00d7 10\n4\ncells/mL, as determined by hemocytometer cell count. Cells were treated with 500 \u00b5L of the appropriate peptide solutions for 0, 5, 10, 15, 30 or 60 min and then lysed using a solution of 0.5 M HCl with 0.5% Triton X-100. After allowing the cells to lyse for 20 min, the lysates were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were extracted and frozen in a \u221218 \u00b0C freezer. The frozen supernatants were subsequently thawed and assessed using the Enzo Direct cAMP ELISA kit and protocol.\nThe results of the cAMP assays were normalized to the total protein content in each sample via Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. Two 10 \u00b5L samples were taken from each frozen lysate supernatant used for the cAMP assay, dispensed on 96-well plates and then assessed using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit and protocol (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).\n\n2.4. Western blotting\nSH-SY5Y cells were removed from 100 mm petri dishes with cell lifters and Dubelco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). After light centrifugation, the DPBS supernatant was removed, and the cells were lysed with a 100:1 M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) mixture. After being lysed for 10 min, the samples were centrifuged at high speeds, and the protein-containing supernatants were removed and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.\nThe total protein content in each sample was determined via BCA assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). 60 \u00b5g of each sample were resolved on a NuPage Novex 4\u201312% Bis-Tris protein gel (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and then transferred to a Novex PVDF membrane with 0.2 \u00b5m pores (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The membrane was then blocked with a 5% milk solution in tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h prior to overnight incubation with primary antibody in 5% milk solution in a cold room. The three primary antibodies used in this study were Phospho-CREB (Ser133) (87G3) Rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), CREB (48H2) Rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and \u03b1-tubulin Mouse mAb (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). These three antibodies were diluted in 5% milk solution at 1:1000, 1:1000 and 1:5000 ratios, respectively. After several TBST washes, these membranes were exposed to solutions of secondary antibodies in 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature. For the membranes stained for pCREB and CREB, 1:5000 dilutions of HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (sc-2030, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) were used. For the membranes stained for \u03b1 -tubulin, 1:50,000 dilutions of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (sc-2031, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) were used. After another round of washing with TBST, these membranes were exposed to SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 10 min and then developed using HyBlot ES Autoradiography film (Denville Scientific Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) and an AFP Mini-Medical 90 Film Processor (AFP Imaging Corporation, Mt. Kisco, NY). If the proteins were not detected using the Pico Substrate, SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was employed to detect the proteins. The developed films were scanned, and the protein bands were densitometrically quantified using ImageJ software.\n\n2.5. Cell viability assays\nCell viability was assessed via the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays.\nAll MTS assays were performed using 96-well plates containing 200 \u00b5L of cells in normal medium at a concentration of 100 \u00d7 10\n4\ncells/mL, as determined by hemocytometer cell count. For the neurotrophic MTS assays, cells were treated with 200 \u00b5L of either twincretin, Ex-4 or GIP dissolved in a low-serum medium formulation (49.25% EMEM, 49.25% F12 K, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum by volume) and were incubated overnight. The cells were subsequently assessed using the CellTiter 96 AQ\nueous\nOne Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit and protocol.\nFor the neuroprotective MTS assays, cells were treated with 150 \u00b5L of twincretin (1 to 1000 nM) in low-serum medium for 1 h before the addition of toxic solutions of either glutamate (100 mM) or H\n2\nO\n2\n(200 to 600 \u00b5M), also dissolved in low-serum medium. The cells were incubated overnight and subsequently assessed using the CellTiter 96 AQ\nueous\nOne Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit and protocol.\nAll LDH assays, for both the neurotrophic and neuroprotective experiments, were performed in 96-well plates using 100 \u00b5L samples from the solutions used for the overnight incubations in the MTS assays. These samples were assessed using the Sigma-Aldrich In Vitro Toxicology Assay kit, Lactic Dehydrogenase based.\nFor the cell viability assays in primary cultures, cells were first fed with media containing B27 supplement without antioxidants (Invitrogen) on DIV7. Freshly made 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA, 100 \u00b5M) (in 20 \u00b5M ascorbic acid saline solution) or saline (with 20 \u00b5M ascorbic acid) was added to the wells on DIV 10. After incubation for 2 h, cultures were washed with (\u2212) AO B27 3 times. Thereafter, either twincretin or vehicle was added to the well following the last wash. Cells were maintained at 37 \u00b0C incubator for 22 h, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and probed for tyrosine hydoxylase (TH) immunoreactivity. Specifically, cells were incubated in a primary antibody solution of mouse monoclonal anti-TH diluted in 4% BSA and 0.3% Triton x-100 in 0.1 M PB, concentration 1:100 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 17\u201319 h at 4 \u00b0C. They were then rinsed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer and incubated with a secondary antibody for 1 h, followed by incubation for 1 h with avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex. TH immunoreactivity was then examined under fluorescent microscope. For background control studies, cells were incubated without primary antibody.\n\n2.6. Mice\nMale ICR mice, 6\u20138 weeks old, weighing 30\u201340 g, were housed 5-per-cage under a 12-hour light/dark cycle with food (Purina Rodent Chow) and water ad libitum. The mice were exposed to a constant temperature of 22 \u00b1 10 \u00b0C. All experimental manipulations were conducted during the light phase of the cycle. Each mouse was used in a single experiment and for one time point only. The Ethics Committee of the Sackler Faculty of Medicine approved the experimental protocol (M-15-011) in compliance with the guidelines for animal experimentation of the National Institutes of Health (\nDHEW Publication 85\u201323, Revised, 1995\n). A minimal number of mice were used, and all efforts were made to minimize potential suffering.\n\n2.7. Closed head mild traumatic brain injury\nmTBIs were induced using the previously described weight drop concussive head trauma device (\nZohar et al., 2003\n;\nTweedie et al., 2007\n;\nLi et al., 2015\n). The device consists of a metal tube with an inner diameter of 13 mm placed vertically over the head of the mouse. Mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and placed under the device. A 30 g metal weight was dropped from the top of the tube (80 cm high) in order to strike the skull at the temporal right side, between the corner of the eye and the ear. A sponge was positioned to support the head, which allowed anterior-posterior motion without any rotational head movement at the moment of impact. Immediately after injury, mice were placed in their cages for recovery.\n\n2.8. Drug administration\n50 \u00b5g/kg twincretin prepared in isotonic saline was administered to the animals once daily for 7 days by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection with the first injection administered 30 min after the injury. Mice were divided into 4 groups: a sham group (s.c. saline once daily \u00d7 7 days), a mTBI group (s.c. saline once daily \u00d7 7 days), a twincretin following sham procedure group, and a twincretin following mTBI group. The sham (saline) and sham (twincretin) groups were treated similarly to TBI challenged animals, but without being subjected to weight drop.\n\n2.9. Core temperature\nCore (rectal) body temperature was time-dependently measured with a pediatric digital thermometer in select animals prior to and post mTBI with and without twincretin administration to assess for any differences in animal core body temperature between sham and peptide treated animals. No difference was evident between these groups of mice.\n\n2.10. Behavioral tests\nBehavioral assessments were initiated 7 and 30 days after the animals received mTBIs in separate cohorts of mice. Mice cognition and emotional behavior were assessed using the novel object recognition, Y-maze and elevated plus maze paradigms. All equipment used for behavioral testing was cleaned with a 70% ethanol solution between testing sessions in order to minimize any olfactory-dependent cognitive influences on mouse behavior.\n\n2.11. Novel object recognition paradigm\nThe novel object recognition task was used to evaluate recognition memory, as previously described (\nEdut et al., 2011\n). This task is based on the innate tendency of rodents to explore unfamiliar objects within their environment. This task is used in order to make assessments as to whether a mouse is able to discriminate between a familiar and a novel object.\nMice were individually habituated to an open field Plexiglas box (59 \u00d7 59 \u00d7 20 cm) for 5 min, 48 h prior to the test. 24 h later, animals were allowed to explore a set of two identical objects for a 5 min period. These objects were suitably heavy and high to guarantee that mice could neither move nor climb over them. 24 h after this acquisition phase, the animals were presented with a similar set of objects in the same environment, where one object was novel to them; they were allowed to freely explore the objects again for a 5-min period. A discrimination preference index was calculated as follows: (time near novel object \u2212 time near familiar object) / (time near novel object + time near familiar object) (\nDix and Aggleton, 1999\n).\n\n2.12. Y-maze paradigm\nThe Y-maze task was chosen to evaluate spontaneous exploration, responsiveness to novel environments and spatial memory function. The apparatus used for the Y-maze study is made of black Plexiglas and consists of three arms separated by a 120\u00b0 angles (\nDellu et al., 1992\n). Each arm is identical (8 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 15 cm), however different spatial cues were placed in each arm (i.e. a triangle, a square, or a circle). The start arm for each experiment was chosen randomly; each mouse was placed into the Y-maze environment on two occasions separated by a 2-minute interval, during which the mouse was returned to its home cage. During the first 5-minute trial, one of the two arms was randomly blocked. During the second 2-minute trial, all arms were open for exploration; the total amount of time the mouse explored in each arm was measured. A discrimination preference index was calculated as follows: (time in new arm \u2212 time in familiar arm) / (time in new arm + time in familiar arm) (\nDix and Aggleton, 1999\n).\n\n2.13. Elevated plus maze paradigm\nThe elevated plus maze apparatus is used to assess the levels of fear or anxiety-like behavior in rodents (\nAlcalay et al., 2004\n). This assessment is based upon the natural tendency of rodents to fear exploration of open, illuminated and elevated environments, and prefer exploration of enclosed, darkened environments. The maze consists of four arms in a \u201cplus\u201d shape formation. Two of the arms have low walls (30 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 1 cm) and the other two arms have high walls (30 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 15 cm), both with open tops. Similar arms face one another. The maze is elevated 50 cm above floor level. On the test day each mouse was placed in the center of the elevated plus maze, facing one of the open arms. During the 5-minute observation period, the numbers of entries to the open and closed arms were quantified, and the time that each mouse spent on the open arm was measured. The longer the time that mice are willing to spend on the open arms has been associated with a lower anxiety-like behavior (\nBelzung and Griebel, 2001\n).\n\n2.14. Data analysis\nAll results are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and were analyzed by either Prism or SPSS V 20 software. One-way ANOVA tests were performed for comparisons between multiple data sets, followed by either Dunnett's or Bonferroni post hoc analysis.\nt\n-tests were also used for direct comparisons in some of the cell culture data. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001."

    "Methods": "2.1. Experimental design\nData were obtained from 8 (3 non-injured and 5 SCI) adult female Sprague Dawley rats (270\u2013300 g body weight). Pre- and post-surgical animal care procedures have been described in detail previously (\nRoy et al., 1992\n). The rats were housed individually with food and water provided ad libitum. All survival surgical procedures were conducted under aseptic conditions with the rats deeply anesthetized with isoflurane gas administered via facemask as needed. All procedures were in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Animal Research Committee at UCLA. SCI rats were allowed to recover for 7 days after which step training under the influence of spinal cord ES was initiated. Step training was performed 5 days/week for 20 min/day for 6 weeks. At 7 weeks post-injury, the rats were tested to step bipedally on a treadmill with ES (40 Hz) while the rat was supported by a body weight support (\nGad et al., 2013\n,\n2014\n;\nCourtine et al., 2009\n;\nLavrov et al., 2008a\n). Motor evoked potentials were generated by ES (1, 5, and 40 Hz) and recorded in selected hindlimb muscles and the EUS while the rat was suspended in a harness (\nGad et al., 2014\n;\nLavrov et al., 2008a\n). In terminal experiments electrophysiological responses in non-injured and SCI rats were recorded under anesthesia (1.2 mg/kg urethane administered s.c.) (\nChang and Havton, 2008a\n,\nb\n).\n\n2.2. Head connector and chronic intramuscular EMG electrode implantation\nA small incision was made at the midline of the skull. The muscles and fascia were retracted laterally, small grooves were made in the skull with a scalpel, and the skull was dried thoroughly. Two amphenol head connectors with Teflon-coated stainless steel wires (AS632, Cooner Wire, Chatsworth CA) were attached securely to the skull with screws and dental cement (\nCourtine et al., 2009\n;\nIchiyama et al., 2008a\n). The tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus muscles were implanted bilaterally with intramuscular EMG recording electrodes (\nCourtine et al., 2009\n;\nIchiyama et al., 2008a\n). Skin and fascial incisions were made to expose the belly of each muscle. Two wires extending from the skull-mounted connector were routed subcutaneously to each muscle. The wires were inserted into the muscle belly using a 23-gauge needle and a small notch (0.5\u20131.0 mm) was removed from the insulation of each wire to expose the conductor and form the electrodes. The wires were secured in the belly of the muscle via a suture on the wire at its entrance into and exit from the muscle belly. The proper placement of the electrodes was verified during the surgery by stimulating through the head connector and post-mortem via dissection (\nGad et al., 2013\n,\n2015a\n).\n\n2.3. Spinal cord transection, epidural electrode implantation, and post-surgical animal care procedures\nA partial laminectomy was performed at the T8\u2013T9 vertebral level to expose the spinal cord. A complete spinal cord transection to include the dura was performed at approximately the T8 spinal level using microscissors. Two surgeons verified the completeness of the transection by lifting the cut ends of the spinal cord and passing a glass probe through the lesion site. Gel foam was inserted into the gap created by the transection as a coagulant and to separate the cut ends of the spinal cord. For epidural electrode implantation, partial laminectomies were performed to expose the spinal cord at spinal levels L2 and S1. Two Teflon-coated stainless steel wires from the head connector were passed under the spinous processes and above the dura mater of the remaining vertebrae between the partial laminectomy sites. After removing a small portion (~1 mm notch) of the Teflon coating and exposing the conductor on the surface facing the spinal cord, the electrodes were sutured to the dura mater at the midline of the spinal cord above and below the electrode sites using 8.0 Ethilon suture (Ethicon, New Brunswick, NJ). Two common ground (indifferent EMG and stimulation grounds) wires (~1 cm of the Teflon removed distally) were inserted subcutaneously in the mid-back region. All wires (for both EMG and ES) were coiled in the back region to provide stress relief. All incision areas were irrigated liberally with warm, sterile saline. All surgical sites were closed in layers using 5.0 Vicryl (Ethicon, New Brunswick, NJ) for all muscle and connective tissue layers and for the skin incisions in the hindlimbs and 5.0 Ethilon for the back skin incision. All closed incision sites were cleansed thoroughly with saline solution.\nAnalgesia was provided by buprenex (0.5\u20131.0 mg/kg, s.c. 3 times/day). The analgesics were initiated before completion of the surgery and continued for a minimum of 2 days. The rats were allowed to fully recover from anesthesia in an incubator. The rats were housed individually in cages that had ample CareFresh bedding and the bladders of the spinal rats were expressed manually 3 times daily for the first 2 weeks after surgery and 2 times daily thereafter. The hindlimbs of the spinal rats were moved passively through a full range of motion once per day to maintain joint mobility. These procedures have been described in detail previously (\nCourtine et al., 2009\n;\nLavrov et al., 2008a\n,\nb\n,\n2006\n;\nGad et al., 2012\n).\n\n2.4. Step training\nFive SCI rats were step trained bipedally (\nIchiyama et al., 2008a\n;\nShah et al., 2012\n) on a specially designed motor-driven rodent treadmill using a body weight support system (\nde Leon et al., 2002a\n,\nb\n) under the influence of ES between L2 and S1 (40 Hz) and quipazine a 5-HT\n2\nagonist (\nGad et al., 2013\n,\n2015a\n;\nIchiyama et al., 2008b\n) (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) and strychnine a glycinergic antagonist (\nGad et al., 2013\n,\n2015a\n) (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) at a treadmill speed of 13.5 cm/s (\nCourtine et al., 2009\n) (pharmacological agents were administered 10 min prior to training). The rats were trained for a period of 6 weeks starting one week after the spinal cord transection surgery. Step training in spinal rats under the influence of pharmacological cocktails and/or spinal cord stimulation interventions are routine procedures with established protocols that have been performed in our laboratory for several years (\nGad et al., 2012\n,\n2014\n;\nShah et al., 2012\n,\n2013\n;\nIchiyama et al., 2008b\n;\nJohnson et al., 2011\n;\nGerasimenko et al., 2007\n).\n\n2.5. Testing procedures\nThe 5 SCI rats were stepped bipedally at a treadmill speed of 13.5 cm/s while in a body weight support system under the influence of ES (40 Hz bipolar stimulation between L2 and S1). With the animals suspended in the air (without paw contact), motor potentials were evoked via bipolar ES between L2 and S1 (1, 5, and 40 Hz) and recorded from the hindlimb muscles and EUS. An abdominal incision was made along the midline to expose the bladder and the pubic bone. The rostral portion of the pubic bone was partially removed using rongeurs to clearly expose the EUS muscle. Two fine stainless steel wires (Cooner wires AS 631-2) were inserted into the exposed portion of the EUS by passing them through a 30-gauge needle. Electrodes were formed by removing (notching) ~0.5\u20131.0 mm of Teflon coating, positioning the electrodes in the belly of the muscle, and securing the wires in the muscle with sutures at their entrance into and exit from the muscle. Stimulation was performed at a low intensity and low frequency to ensure local stimulation of the EUS muscle only. No experimental pharmacological agents (quipazine or strychnine) were administered during the testing procedures.\nThe 3 non-injured rats were anesthetized via urethane (1.2 mg/kg administered s.c.). The soleus and EUS were implanted acutely with Teflon coated stainless steel wires (Cooner wires AS 631-2) as described above. The tibial and pudendal nerves were isolated and placed on silver hook electrodes in a pool of mineral oil (\nTalmadge et al., 2002\n). The pudendal nerve was isolated caudal to the L6-S1 trunk, the remaining branch after the pelvic nerve leaves this trunk as described earlier (\nCruz et al., 2004\n). Evoked potentials were recorded from the EUS and soleus while the animals were lying on a heating pad on their belly during either tibial or pudendal nerve stimulation (0.5 Hz frequency, 0.05 ms pulse width, 1 to 10 V intensity). The bladder was not emptied prior to the experiment, however, no visible voiding was observed during the course of the experiment.\n\n2.6. Data analyses\nEMG recordings from the TA, soleus, and EUS were band-pass filtered (1 Hz to 5 KHz), amplified using an A-M Systems Model 1700 differential AC amplifier (A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA), and sampled at a frequency of 10 KHz using a custom data acquisition program written in the LabView development environment (National Instruments, Austin, TX) (\nGad et al., 2013\n,\n2015b\n;\nShah et al., 2012\n). Custom scripts written in Matlab were used to measure the evoked potentials from the hindlimb and EUS muscles (\nLavrov et al., 2008b\n,\n2006\n). Step cycle durations and EMG burst amplitudes and durations were determined using a custom program written in the LabView development environment (\nGad et al., 2015a\n). Integrated EMG (iEMG) values were calculated as EMG amplitude x duration. The evoked responses were divided into early (ER, latency 1\u20133 ms), middle (MR, latency 4\u20137 ms) and late responses (LR, latency 7\u201310 ms) based on latency post-stimulation. The characteristics of the ER are consistent with the direct activation of motor fibers or motoneurons. This response has a short latency (1\u2013 3 ms) and shows a maximum amplitude with supramaximal stimulation. Theoretically, the short latency of the ER includes only the neuromuscular synaptic delay and the conduction time of the stimulus to the muscle and involves no synaptic delay within the spinal cord. The MR reflects the inclusion of one or more synaptic delays. The MR has a latency of about 4\u20136 ms. The LR has the longest latency of the three responses (7\u201310 ms) and represents a polysynaptic event. The latency difference between the ER and LR was about 6 to 8 ms and this difference may correspond to as many as three synaptic delays. The latencies used were based on previously published data (\nLavrov et al., 2006\n;\nGerasimenko et al., 2006\n). The phase difference between the left and right hindlimbs was calculated based on the difference in the onset time of the TA between the limbs divided by the step cycle duration.\n\n2.7. Statistical analyses\nAll data are reported as mean \u00b1 SEM. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine overall differences and paired t-tests to determine individual differences. The criterion level for the determination of a statistical difference was set at\nP\n< 0.05 for all comparisons."

    "Methods": "2.1. Spinal cord transection\nAll protocols involving the use of animals in this study were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pittsburgh. The spinal cords of seven female cats (3.2\u20133.8 kg) were transected under isoflurane anesthesia using aseptic surgical techniques. After performing a dorsal laminectomy at T9\u2013T10 vertebral level, a local anesthetic (lidocaine 1%) was applied to the surface of the spinal cord and then injected into the cord through the dura. The dura and spinal cord were then cut completely (T9\u2013T10 spinal segment), and a piece of gel foam was placed between the cut ends (usually a separation of 2\u20133 mm). The muscle and skin were sutured and after full recovery from anesthesia, the animal was returned to its cage. Following spinal transection, the bladder was emptied by manual expression at least twice daily. If manual expression was not successful, a sterile catheter (3.5F) was inserted through the urethra to empty the bladder. Ketoprofen (2 mg/kg twice a day for 3 days) and an antibiotic (enrofloxacin, 2.5 mg/kg for 7 days) were administered following surgery. Beginning 4\u20135 weeks following spinal cord transection, animals were used for pharmacological experiments.\n\n2.2. Drugs\nStock solutions of oxotremorine-M (1 mM), nicotine bitartrate (10 mM), hexamethonium chloride (50 mM), atropine methyl nitrate (50 mM), and (\u00b1) 8-hydroxy-2-di-N-propylaminotetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) were prepared in distilled water and diluted in 0.9% sterile saline prior to administration. All drugs were obtained from Sigma\u2013Aldrich Co. The drugs were infused intravesically in concentrations that were determined in pilot experiments or were selected based on concentrations shown in previous studies in rats to be effective in altering reflex bladder activity (\nKullmann et al., 2008b\n;\nMasuda et al., 2006\n;\nMatsumoto et al., 2010\n,\n2012\n) or bladder afferent nerve activity (\nYu and de Groat, 2010\n;\nYu et al., 2016\n) after intravesical administration.\n\n2.3. Isovolumetric cystometrograms (CMGs) in conscious SCI cats\nA sterile 7 French double lumen balloon catheter (2 cm distance from the catheter tip to the balloon) was inserted through the urethra into the bladder of the chronic SCI cats without anesthesia. The balloon was distended in the bladder by 2 ml of air and then positioned at the bladder neck by gently withdrawing the catheter. The balloon prevented leakage of fluid from the bladder. One lumen of the catheter was connected to a pump to infuse the bladder with sterile saline at a rate of 2\u20134 ml/min and the other lumen was connected to a pressure transducer that was connected to a computerized data acquisition system running Windaq software (DATAQ Instruments Incorporated, Akron, OH, USA) to record changes in bladder pressure. The rate of filling was usually 2 ml/min but was increased in some experiments to 4 ml/min to reduce filling time if bladder capacity (BC) was very large. In a few experiments in which both filling rates were tested the rate of filling did not markedly affect BC. The catheterized animals rested comfortably in a padded small animal transport carrier during the experiment (usually 5\u20136 h), and the catheter was withdrawn at the end of the experiment. After each experiment, the cat was given 150 mg/ kg of ampicillin subcutaneously. The cats were used for multiple experiments at 1- to 4-week intervals.\nOXO-M, nicotine, hexamethonium, and AMN were administered by intravesical infusion. AMN and 8-OH-DPAT dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.9% sterile saline were administered by subcutaneous injection. Control saline CMGs were repeated at least 2\u20133 times to evaluate reproducibility before administering drugs. The bladder was emptied by aspiration before the beginning of each CMG. The infusion pump was usually stopped after the first micturition contraction occurred. A saline rinse (approximately 20 ml infused at 5 ml/min) and a slow-filling saline CMG were performed after each infusion of agonist (OXO-M or nicotine) to determine if the agonist effect could be reversed. Antagonists were administered alone either intravesically or subcutaneously to determine the effect of receptor blockade on reflex activity in untreated bladders or alone prior to infusion of an antagonist\u2013agonist combination in order to demonstrate blockade of agonist evoked responses. In some experiments (n = 5), OXO-M was administered intravesically before and after subcutaneous injection of 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 mg/kg), which was shown in previous experiments to increase BC in chronic SCI cats (\nGu et al., 2004\n;\nTai et al., 2006\n).\n\n2.4. Isovolumetric CMGs in anesthetized SCI cats\nTerminal experiments were conducted on three animals anesthetized with \u03b1-chloralose (60 mg/kg, i.v., supplemented as needed) following induction with isoflurane (2% in O\n2\n). Systemic blood pressure was monitored via a catheter placed in the right carotid artery. A tracheotomy was performed and a cannula was inserted to secure the airway. A catheter for i.v. infusion was introduced into the right cephalic vein. The ureters were cut and drained externally, and a catheter for drug infusion was inserted through the bladder dome and secured with a purse string suture. Drugs were administered intravenously or by intravesical infusion. Bladder activity was recorded with the same methods used in the conscious animals. The temperature of the animal was maintained between 35 and 37 \u00b0C using a heating pad. Data were recorded on a computer using the LabVIEW program (National Instruments Corporation, Austin, TX, USA).\n\n2.5. Data analysis\nTo evaluate the effect of drugs on reflex bladder activity, several parameters (\nFig. 1\n) were measured during CMGs including the bladder volume threshold for triggering a micturition reflex contraction (\u201ca,\u201d BC), maximal micturition pressure (\u201cb,\u201d MMP), and the frequency and area under the curve (cm H\n2\nO\u2022sec) of pre-micturition contractions (\u201cc,\u201d PMC-AUC). BC is defined as the bladder volume during a CMG at which the first micturition contraction occurred. The first micturition contraction is defined as a large amplitude (>25 cm H\n2\nO), long duration (>20 s) reflex bladder contraction that is accompanied by hind limb stepping movements. Previous studies (\nTai et al., 2006\n;\nThor et al., 1983\n) showed that hind limb movements are a useful surrogate marker for the occurrence of a micturition reflex when CMGs are conducted with a closed urethral outlet that prevents voiding. The rhythmic hind limb movements were also elicited by manual compression of the bladder when attempting to express urine during daily nursing care or during voiding induced by tactile stimulation of the perigenital region. However, the leg movements did not occur during the small amplitude, short duration contractions (i.e., the pre-micturition contractions, PMCs). Because the present experiments were performed with the urethral outlet closed which prevents elimination of the bladder contents, we used the simultaneous occurrence of a large amplitude bladder contraction and hind limb movements as an indicator of the first micturition reflex during the cystometrogram. This method of defining the volume threshold for micturition (i.e., BC) was especially useful in those experiments where pre-micturition contractions gradually increased in amplitude during the cystometrogram (\nFig. 1B\n) in contrast to experiments where the initiation of a micturition reflex was obvious due to an abrupt large increase in the amplitude of the bladder contractions (\nFig. 1A\n). In anesthetized animals, in which the bladder catheter was inserted through the bladder dome, the micturition reflex was indicated by release of fluid from the urethral orifice.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nA and B. Diagram showing parameters of bladder activity measured during cystometrograms in two conscious chronic spinal cord injured cats. a, Bladder capacity (BC), the volume infused intravesically to induce a micturition reflex contraction that was identified by coincident reflex contractions of the hind legs. b, Maximal micturition pressure (MMP). c, Pre-micturition contraction (PMC) frequency or area under curve (PMC-AUC) measured for a period of 200 s. prior to the micturition reflex contraction. Down arrow indicates start of intravesical infusion. Up arrow indicates end of intravesical infusion. * denotes the first micturition reflex contraction. A. Tracing shows a large difference between the amplitude of PMCs and the first micturition reflex contraction. A second micturition contraction occurred after the end of intravesical infusion. B. Tracing from another experiment shows that the largest amplitude PMCs can be similar in amplitude to that of the first micturition reflex contraction. Both tracings show PMCs gradually increase in amplitude during intravesical infusion.\nThe small amplitude (8\u201324 cm H\n2\nO) PMCs that occurred during bladder filling prior to the large amplitude micturition contraction were measured for 200 s prior to the micturition contraction. This length of time was chosen because it was the average period during which PMCs occurred under control conditions. Area under the curve for PMCs was chosen because it reflected both the increased amplitude and frequency of the contractions. Each measured parameter after drug administration was normalized to its control value before drug administration in each experimental trial. The normalized parameter was then expressed as a percentage change from control and was averaged across different experiments. Repeated-measures one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison test or paired or unpaired t-tests were used to determine statistically significant differences at p b 0.05. Data are reported as the mean \u00b1 SEM and were compiled and statistically analyzed using Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA)."

    "Methods": "Chemicals and animals\nAll chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.) unless otherwise noted. Male Sprague Dawley rats were used in this study (200 to 250g; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass.). Rats had free access to food and water and were housed on a 12h/12h light/dark cycle, with lights on from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. The animal care and use procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Yale University. All experiments were performed in accordance with current guidelines.\n\nIntrahippocampal infusion of MSO or PBS\nNineteen rats were anesthetized with 1% to 2% Isoflurane (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.) in O\n2\nand placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, Calif.). A 30-gauge stainless steel cannula attached to a plastic pedestal (Plastics One, Roanoke, Va.) was introduced through a burr hole in the skull and into the right hippocampus, using the following coordinates with bregma as the reference: AP= \u22125.6 mm, ML=5.3 mm, DV= \u22126.5 mm. The cannula was cemented to the skull using cyanoacrylate and connected via plastic tubing to a subcutaneously implanted Alzet osmotic pump (Model 2004, Durect Corp., Cupertino, Calif.). This pump holds a total volume of 200 \u03bcL and delivers a continuous flow of 0.25 \u03bcL/h for 28 days (as per manufacturer\u2019s specifications). One set of pumps was filled with MSO (2.5 mg/mL; dissolved in Dulbecco\u2019s Phosphate Buffered Saline, PBS) to achieve a delivery of 0.625 \u03bcg of MSO per h (n = 10). Another set of pumps was filled with PBS and implanted in control animals (n = 9). Rats were operated on sequentially in 10 pairs of 2, each pair consisting of an MSO injected rat and a matched PBS control such that treatment and timing of fixation in relation to surgery could be maximally approximated in the control.\nFour stainless steel epidural screw electrodes (Plastics One) were implanted to record cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) activity. Two electrodes (one in each hemisphere) were positioned in the epidural space overlying the parietal neocortex. A third electrode was positioned in the epidural space near lambda to serve as the reference. A fourth electrode was positioned over the occipital bone (not touching the dura) to serve as the ground. The female socket contacts on the end of each electrode were inserted into a plastic pedestal (Plastics One), and the entire implantation was secured by UV light cured acrylated urethane adhesive (Loctite 3106 Light Cure Adhesive, Henkel Corp., Rocky Hill, Conn.).\n\nVideo-intracranial EEG monitoring and seizure quantitation\nThe experimental setup for recording video-EEG was adapted from Bertram et al. (\nBertram, 2006\n). The rats were placed individually in custom-made Plexiglas cages. A spring-covered, 6-channel cable was connected to the electrode pedestal on one end and to a commutator (Plastics One) on the other. A second cable connected the commutator to the digital EEG recording unit (CEEGraph Vision LTM, Natus Bio-logic Systems Corp., Mundelein, Ill.). Digital cameras with infrared light detection capacity were used to record animal behavior (two cages per camera). The digital video signal was encoded and synchronized to the digital EEG signals. Seizures were identified by visual inspection of the EEG record. As detailed in (\nAvoli and Gloor, 1994\n) seizures were defined by EEG characteristics and not by the duration of the discharge. Specifically, seizures displayed distinct signal changes from background (interictal) activity. Such signal changes included sustained rhythmic or spiking EEG patters and a clear evolution of signal characteristics from onset to termination.\nAs timing of fixation following seizures was critical to the c-Fos staining method described below, the rats were followed in real time by a researcher blinded to their condition (MSO or PBS). Eight rats were monitored at a time, always consisting of 4 MSO rats paired with their matched PBS control. One set of MSO and PBS rats was monitored during the first five days of MSO infusion (early epileptogenesis group), and another set was monitored during days 15 to 43 after MSO infusion (late epileptogenesis group). When seizure activity was observed on the EEG and by monitoring rat behavior by the blinded researcher in real time, the time of the seizure was noted, and a second researcher immediately reviewed the video-EEG recordings to independently confirm the occurrence of, and stage of the seizure. The seizures were staged by behavioral analysis using a modification of Racine\u2019s criteria (\nRacine et al., 1973\n), as follows: stage I, immobilization, eye blinking, twitching of vibrissae and mouth movements; stage II, head nodding, often accompanied by facial clonus; stage III, forelimb clonus; stage IV, rearing; stage V, rearing, falling and generalized convulsions. The MSO seizure rat and its matched PBS control were transported together from the monitoring room to the main lab 45 minutes following the seizure for perfusion fixation, which occurred 1 h after the onset of the seizure.\n\nPilocarpine control\nIn order to confirm the efficacy of the c-Fos staining protocol, 1 rat was injected subcutaneously with 325 mg/kg pilocarpine dissolved in PBS. Within a few hours of injection several stage V seizures occurred. One hour after the onset of the first stage V seizure the rat was perfusion fixed and processed for c-Fos staining following the same protocol as for MSO/PBS infused rats.\n\nTissue preparation, immunohistochemistry and nomenclature\nAt 1 hour after the observed seizure, the MSO seizure rat and its matched PBS control were anesthetized with Isoflurane and perfused transcardially with saline followed by 4% formaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB; 0.1M, pH 7.4). The brains were removed and left in the same fixative overnight at 4\u00b0C and then transferred to 20% sucrose (dissolved in PB) the next day. After at least 24 hours in 20% sucrose, the brains were sectioned horizontally on a sliding microtome at 50-\u03bcm thickness. Every fifth section was mounted on gelatin-coated slides and stained with cresyl violet. The remaining four sets of sections were stored in FD Tissue Cryoprotection Solution (FD Neurotechnologies, Columbia, Md.) at \u221220 \u00b0C prior to staining. These sectioned brains were logged and randomly coded by one researcher in order to blind a second researcher to the condition of the rats. Blinding the primary researcher to both the condition (MSO, PBS, pilocarpine) and to the stage of seizure (stage 1 or stage 5) was critical due to the descriptive and subjective nature of the analysis.\nStaining with c-Fos was performed after completion of all seizure monitoring and brain sectioning on a total of 20 rats (10 MSO, 9 PBS, 1 pilocarpine). All of the following steps were performed at room temperature using a shaker on a low setting for continuous, but gentle mixing. Brain sections were removed from \u221220\u00b0C and washed in fresh PBS solution for 5 minutes, 3 times. Membranes were then permeabilized with a wash in 0.3% Triton-X-100 in 0.1 M PB for 30 minutes, followed by 3 washes in PBS of 5 minutes each. Brain sections were then transferred to 1 M ethanolamine in 0.1 M PB for 30 minutes to quench aldehydes, followed again by 3 washes in PBS of 5 minutes each. The sections were next transferred to 4% dry milk in PBS for blocking. After 1 hour in the dry milk, the primary antibody, rabbit anti-\nc-Fos\nIgG was added at a dilution of 1: 10,000, the dish was sealed with parafilm, and left overnight on the shaker. The following day, the sections were first washed in fresh PBS for 1 minute, followed by 3 consecutive 20 minute washes. Next, they were moved to secondary biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG antibody from a Vectastain Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.) diluted as instructed to 0.05% in PBS. The sections were then washed in fresh PBS for 1 minute, followed by 3 consecutive 15 minute washes. Next, the sections were transferred to the Vectastain A+B solution mixed at a ratio of 1 drop per 5 mL PBS, which was allowed to stand for at least 30 minutes prior to use. The sections were then washed again in fresh PBS for 1 minute followed by 3 consecutive 10 minute washes. Finally, the staining reaction was developed by transferring the sections to 0.05% DAB, 0.009% H\n2\nO\n2\nin PBS. Sections were initially monitored carefully for development, periodically checking the progress under the microscope. Ultimately it was decided that 15 minutes was the optimal time. After 15 minutes in this solution, the sections were washed in 0.1 M PB for 10 minutes, 3 consecutive times. Sections were then carefully mounted on gelatin-coated slides using 0.1 M PB and allowed to dry overnight before they were covered and logged for analysis under the microscope.\nThe slides were covered and examined under a light microscope. The subdivisions of the hippocampus are in accordance with the work of Lorente de N\u00f3 (\nLorente de N\u00f3, 1934\n) with the modifications suggested by Amaral and Insausti (\nAmaral and Insausti, 1990\n). In brief, the hippocampus is divided into (a) the subiculum, (b) the Ammon\u2019s horn (hippocampus proper), which comprises fields CA1-3, and (c) the dentate gyrus, which includes the molecular layer, granule cell layer, and polymorphic layer of the hilus.\n\nAnalysis and grading protocol\nFour treatment groups were analyzed (\nTable 1\n): MSO injection Racine stage 1 seizure/early epileptogenesis (n = 7), MSO injection Racine stage 5 seizure/late epileptogenesis (n = 3), PBS injection negative control (n = 9), and pilocarpine Racine stage 5 seizure positive staining control (n = 1). The researcher performing the analysis remained blinded to the condition of the rats. First the sections stained at 1:10,000 primary antibody dilutions were observed generally. Of the 20 rats under analysis, 11 were found to have grossly apparent staining of varying extent at 4x magnification, and 9 were found to have nearly absent staining at 4x magnification. These were then re-examined at 10x magnification and it was determined that these 9 rats had no staining of significance. It was also determined at this time that the staining of the 11 rats, while grossly apparent, was suboptimal in terms of intensity. It was decided to repeat the above staining procedure with two minor changes as described. This was done on the 11 rats with apparent staining and 1 selected rat of the 9 without apparent staining from the original protocol. The researcher performing the staining and analysis remained blinded to the condition of the selected rats.\nTable 1.\nLog of animals and observed seizures under study. MSO-infused rats and matched PBS-infused controls were perfusion fixed with paraformaldehyde about 1 h after the observed seizure. The brains were then serial sectioned into 5 sets of evenly spaced 50 \u03bcm sections. One set was stained with cresyl violet for anatomic reference. All brains were stained with c-Fos.\nAnimal\nTreatment\nInjection Site\nSeizure Stage\nPost-Op Day of seizure\nTime Seizure to Perfusion (h:min)\nEarly Epileptogenesis Rats (Days 1\u20135; Stage 1 Seizure) and Paired Controls\nA\nMSO\nAngular Bundle\n1\n1\n1:15\nB\nPBS\nAngular Bundle\nJ\nMSO\nDeep Entorhinal Cortex\n1\n4\n1:00\nI\nPBS\nDeep Entorhinal Cortex\nN\nMSO\nDeep Entorhinal Cortex\n1\n3\n1:20\nM\nPBS\nDeep Entorhinal Cortex\nD\nMSO\nDeep Entorhinal Cortex\n1\n1\n1:00\nC\nPBS\nAngular Bundle\nE\nMSO\nDeep Entorhinal Cortex\n1\n1\n1:00\nF\nPBS\nAngular Bundle\nK\nMSO\nDeep Entorhinal Cortex\n1\n3\n1:05\nL\nPBS\nSubiculum\nR\nMSO\nAngular Bundle\n1\n5\n1:00\nQ\nPBS\nAngular Bundle\nLate Epileptogenesis Rats (Days 16\u201343; Stage 5 Seizure) and Paired Controls\nO\nMSO\nSubiculum\n5\n16\n1:03\nP\nPBS\nSubiculum\nH\nMSO\nSubiculum\n5\n18\n1:00\nG\nPBS\nSubiculum\nS\nMSO\nSubiculum\n5\n43\n1:00\nT\nPilocarpine\nN/N(Subcutaneous)\n5\n-\n1:00\nOpen in a new tab\nThe 1:2,500 dilution c-Fos stained sections from the 12 rats were generally observed and a semi-quantitative grading scale was devised to summarize the findings. The sections were analyzed sequentially, using the Paxinos Rat Brain Atlas as a reference (\nPaxinos and Watson, 2006\n), first to identify the approximate dorso-ventral level of the horizontal section, then to grade nuclear c-Fos staining in the various regions/nuclei. One hundred and nine different regions/nuclei were considered independently, including 27 regions of the hippocampus and cortex, which were considered separately on the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres relative to the injection site. Fifty-five subcortical regions were considered bilaterally, but differences in staining of between ipsilateral and contralateral side were noted. It was attempted to consider as much detail as possible, but some nuclei had to be grouped (for example the subnuclei related to the stria terminalis) due to an inability to resolve any finer detail after considering all available anatomical clues to orientation.\nStaining in each region was graded in terms of both density (number of cells per unit area) and intensity (darkness of the coloring within each cell;\nFigure 1\n). Density was graded on a stepwise scale from 0.5 to 2.5, with 0.5 representing the highest density and 2.5 the highest density staining observed. Intensity was graded on a similar scale from 0.5 to 2.5, with 0.5 representing c-fos visible just above the background staining and 2.5 representing extremely intense staining. Finally, the scores for intensity and density were added to a single score, ranging from 1 (lowest density and intensity observed) to 5 (highest density and intensity observed). The scores are listed in\nTable 2\nand color coded according to their magnitude. It was recognized that this method of analysis is subjective and would likely not be perfectly replicable with a different researcher doing the analysis. The goal was not to rigorously quantitate the level of c-Fos staining, but rather to assess the relative activation of various areas of the brain during seizures, and how these networks of activation change and develop with development from stage 1 to stage 5 seizures. The combined density and intensity scores for the 7 early and 3 late stage animals were compared using a two-sided Mann-Whitney U test, separately for each of the areas studied. The areas which were significantly different (p <0.05) were reported. A correction for multiple comparisons was not performed for this exploratory data analysis.\nFigure 1. Grading and color coding.\nOpen in a new tab\nC-Fos staining was graded on two independent scales, 0.5 to 2.5 for the density (number of stained cells/unit area) and 0.5 to 2.5 for intensity (darkness of staining/cell) in all analyzed brain regions. Examples of density scoring are shown in red font and of intensity scoring in black font. The numbers for density and intensity were added to provide single scores, which were plotted in\nTable 2\n.\nTable 2.\nC-Fos staining in the hippocampal formation and cortical regions (Table 2A), and in subcortical regions and the brainstem (Table 2B). Seven rats from early epileptogenesis and three rats from late epileptogenesis are shown in columns A and B followed in column C by one representative PBS-treated negative control and one pilocarpine-treated positive control. Statistical comparisons between early epileptogenesis (A) and late epileptogenesis (B) are provided in the rightmost column. Only p-values <0.05, with their corresponding brain areas highlighted in gray, are shown. Each region was independently graded for staining density (number of stained cells per unit area, scored 0.5\u20132.5) and intensity (darkness of stain within each cell, scored 0.5\u20132.5), and the grades for density and intensity were added to a single numerical score and color coded according to its magnitude (see also\nFigure 1\n). For regions not explicitly shown bilaterally, differences in staining ipsilateral and contralateral to the injection are noted: * decreased staining contralateral vs. ipsilateral; ** staining only observed ipsilateral to injection.\nBrain Regions\n(A)\nMSO Early Epileptogenesis\n(B)\nMSO Late Epileptogenesis\n(C)\nControls\nStatistics\nEarly vs Late (P)\nRat A (m)\nRat D (m)\nRat E (m)\nRatJ (m)\nRat K (m)\nRat N (m)\nRat R (m)\nRat H (m)\nRat O (m)\nRat S (m)\nRat C (pbs)\nRatT (pilo)\nMolecular\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nIpsilateral Dentate\nGranular\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n4\n4.5\n3\n3.5\n4.5\n0\n3.5\nPolymorphic\n2.5\n2.5\n2.5\n3.5\n3\n3\n3\n2\n3.5\n2.5\n0\n0\nStratum Oriens\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nIpsilateral CA3\nPyramidal Cell\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n0\n3\nSR/SL\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1.5\nIpsilateral SLM\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\nStratum Oriens\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nIpsilateral CA2\nPyramidal Cell\n2\n2\n2.5\n2.5\n2\n2.5\n2.5\n3\n2.5\n2.5\n0\n3\nSR/SL\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1.5\nStratum Oriens\n1\n1\n1\n1.5\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1.5\n1\n0\n0\nIpsilateral CA1\nPyramidal Cell\n4\n4\n3.5\n3.5\n3\n3.5\n3.5\n3\n3.5\n3.5\n0\n3.5\nSR/SL\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1.5\nIpsilateral Subiculum\nSuperficial\n2.5\n3\n3\n3\n2.5\n3\n3\n2.5\n3.5\n3.5\n0\n2.5\nDeep\n3\n2.5\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3.5\n2\n0\n3\nIpsilateral Presubiculum\n3.5\n3.5\n0\n0\n0\n2\n0\n0\n5\n0\n0\n3\nIpsilateral Parasubiculum\n3.5\n3\n3\n3\n3.5\n3\n3.5\n3\n4.5\n0\n0\n3.5\nIpsilateral Entorhinal\nSuperficial\n3\n2.5\n2\n3\n2.5\n3\n3\n3\n4\n3.5\n0\n3\nCortex\nDeep\n3.5\n4\n2.5\n4.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n1\n3.5\n3\n1\n3\nPerirhinal\n3\n3\n3\n2.5\n2.5\n1.5\n1\n3\n3.5\n3.5\n1\n2.5\nEctorhinal\n3\n3\n3\n2.5\n2.5\n2.5\n1\n4.5\n4\n3.5\n1.5\n3\n0.017\nTemp Ass\n3\n3\n3\n2\n0\n2.5\n1\n4.5\n3.5\n3.5\n1.5\n3\n0.017\nIpsilateral Cortex\nAuditory\n2.5\n2.5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3.5\n3.5\n3.5\n1\n3\n0.017\nSensorimotor\n2\n2.5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\n3.5\n3.5\n0\n3\n0.017\nInsular\n2\n2.5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\n3.5\n3.5\n0\n3\n0.017\nPiriform\n3\n3\n0\n3\n3\n2\n2\n3\n3\n3\n2\n4.5\nLimbic\n2.5\n3\n0\n2\n1\n1\n2\n4.5\n4\n4.5\n0\n2.5\n0.017\nMolecular\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nContralateral Dentate\nGranular\n4\n3.5\n3\n3.5\n3\n4.5\n4.5\n3.5\n3.5\n4.5\n0\n3.5\nPolymorphic\n3.5\n2.5\n2.5\n2\n3\n2.5\n3\n2.5\n3.5\n2.5\n0\n0\nStratum Oriens\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\nContralateral CA3\nPyramidal Cell\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n0\n3\nSR/SL\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\nContralateral SLM\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nStratum Oriens\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nContralateral CA2\nPyramidal Cell\n2.5\n2.5\n3\n3\n2.5\n2.5\n2.5\n2.5\n3\n2.5\n0\n3\nSR/SL\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\nStratum Oriens\n2\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\nContralateral CA1\nPyramidal Cell\n4\n4\n3.5\n3.5\n3\n3.5\n3.5\n3.5\n3.5\n3.5\n0\n3.5\nSR/SL\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\n0.017\nContralateral\nSuperficial\n3\n2.5\n2.5\n2.5\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n2.5\n0\n3\nSubiculum\nDeep\n3\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n0\n3.5\nContralateral Presubiculum\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\nContralateral Parasubiculum\n3\n2.5\n3\n1.5\n1\n2\n2\n3.5\n3.5\n3\n0\n0\nContralateral\nSuperficial\n3.5\n2\n2\n0\n1\n1\n2\n3\n3\n2.5\n0\n3.5\nEntorhinal Cortex\nDeep\n1.5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1.5\n3\n2.5\n0\n3.5\n0.033\nPerirhinal\n1.5\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n3\n3.5\n2.5\n1\n2.5\n0.017\nEctorhinal\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n3.5\n3.5\n3.5\n1\n3\n0.017\nTemporal Assoc.\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n3.5\n3.5\n3.5\n1\n3\n0.017\nContralateral Cortex\nAuditory\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3.5\n3.5\n3.5\n0\n3\n0.017\nSensorimotor\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\n3.5\n3.5\n0\n3\n0.017\nInsular\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n4.5\n3.5\n3.5\n0\n3\n0.017\nPiriform\n2.5\n2\n0\n0\n0\n2.5\n2\n3\n3.5\n3.5\n1\n4.5\n0.017\nLimbic\n1\n1.5\n0\n0\n0\n1\n2\n2.5\n4\n3.5\n0\n2.5\n0.017\nBrain Regions\n(A)\nMSO Early Epileptogenesis\n(B)\nMSO Late Epileptogenesis\n(C)\nControls\nStatistics\nEarly vs Late (P)\nRat A(m)\nRat D (m)\nRat E (m)\nRatJ (m)\nRat K (m)\nRat N (m)\nRatR (m)\nRat H (m)\nRat O (m)\nRat S (m)\nRat C (pbs)\nRatT (pilo)\nClaustrum\n2*\n2.5**\n0\n0\n1\n1.5\n1.5\n3\n3\n3.5\n0\n3\n0.017\nEndopiriform\nDorsal\n1.5*\n2.5**\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n2.5\n3\n3\n0\n3\n0.033\nInter./Vent.\n1.5*\n2.5**\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\n0\n0\n0\n3\nAmygdalopiriform\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nAmygdalohippoc.\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nBasal\n0\n2**\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2.5*\n2.5*\n0\n2.5\nAmygdala\nLateral\n3.5**\n3.5**\n4**\n2.5**\n3**\n1.5**\n0\n3.5**\n3*\n3*\n1\n1.5\nIntercalated\n1**\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\nCentral\n2.5**\n3**\n0\n0\n0\n1.5\n0\n0\n1.5*\n2*\n0\n3\nMedial\n1**\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2.5*\n-\n0\n2.5\nAnt.

    "Methods": "Animals\nNGF-OE mice\nNGF-OE transgenic mice were generated at Roche Palo Alto (material transfer agreement with Roche Palo Alto and Dr. Debra Cockayne) in collaboration with Dr. Henry Sun at New York University Medical School as previously described (\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n) (\nGirard et al., 2011\n) (\nGirard et al., 2010\n). Animal genotype was confirmed by Southern and/or PCR analyses; all mice have the inbred genetic C57BL/6J background and were derived from F10 to F12 generations maintained through a hemizygous backcross strategy with C57BL/6J wildtype (WT) mice. Mice used in this study were bred locally at the University of Vermont College of Medicine. The litters were of normal size and weight and behaviors (feeding, drinking, activity patterns) appeared normal. Female and male mice of varying postnatal (P) age (P0-Adult (A)) from multiple dams were used to examine postnatal maturation of voiding reflexes. In these studies, P0 is defined as day of birth. As previously demonstrated (\nGirard et al., 2010\n;\n2011\n;\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n) and confirmed in this study, urinary bladder weight was significantly (p \u2264 0.01) increased in NGF-OE mice compared to littermate WT mice (\nTable 1\n). Wistar rats (Charles River Canada, St. Constant, Quebec) of both sexes and various postnatal ages (P0-A) were used to determine urination onset and to serve as a comparison for WT and NGF-OE mice. All experimental protocols involving animal use were approved by the University of Vermont Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC # 08-085). Animal care was under the supervision of the University of Vermont\u2019s Office of Animal Care Management in accordance with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) and National Institutes of Health guidelines. All efforts were made to minimize the potential for animal pain, stress or distress. Separate groups of littermate WT and NGF-OE mice were used in the following experiments.

Total RNA was extracted using the STAT-60 total RNA/mRNA isolation reagent (Tel-Test\u2018B\u2019, Friendswood, TX, USA) as previously described (\nGirard et al., 2010\n;\n2011\n;\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n). One \u03bcg of RNA per sample was used to synthesize complementary DNA using a mix of random hexamer and oligo dT primers with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega Corp.) in a 25-\u03bcl final reaction volume. The quantitative PCR standards for all transcripts were prepared with the amplified cDNA products ligated directly into pCR2.1 TOPO vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequences of the inserts were verified by automated fluorescent dideoxy dye terminator sequencing (Vermont Cancer Center DNA Analysis Facility). To estimate the relative expression of the receptor transcripts, 10-fold serial dilutions of stock plasmids were prepared as quantitative standards. The range of standard concentrations was determined empirically. Complementary DNA templates, diluted 10-fold to minimize the inhibitory effects of the reverse transcription reaction components, were assayed using HotStart-IT SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (USB, Cleveland, OH, USA) and 300 nM of each primer in a final 25 \u03bcl reaction volume.\nReal-time quantitative PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)(Girard et al., 2002) using the following standard conditions: (1) serial heating at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min and (2) amplification over 45 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u201364\u00b0C depending on primers set for 30 s. The amplified product from these amplification parameters was subjected to SYBR Green I melting analysis by ramping the temperature of the reaction samples from 60 to 95 \u00b0C. A single DNA melting profile was observed under these dissociation assay conditions demonstrating the amplification of a single unique product free of primer dimers or other anomalous products. Oligonucleotide primer sequences were: mouse NGF: forward primer (5\u2032-AGTGAGGTGCATAGCGTAAT-3\u2032); reverse primer (5\u2032-CACATTGGTGGGAACAAA-3\u2032); mouse CGRP: forward primer (5\u2032-ATCCTGCAACACTGCCA -3\u2032); reverse primer (5\u2032-CACATTGGTGGGAACAAA-3\u2032); Substance P (Sub P): forward primer (5\u2032-CGGTGCCAACGATGATCTAAA -3\u2032); reverse primer (5\u2032-ACGCCTTCTTTCGTACTTCTG -3\u2032). L32 primer sequences have been previously reported (\nKlinger et al., 2008\n).\nFor data analyses, a standard curve was constructed by amplification of serially diluted plasmids containing the target sequence. Data were analyzed at the termination of each assay using sequence detection software (Sequence Detection Software, version 1.3.1; Applied Biosystems, Norwalk, CT, USA). In standard assays, default baseline settings were selected. The increase in SYBR Green I fluorescence intensity (\u0394Rn) was plotted as a function of cycle number and the threshold cycle was determined by the software as the amplification cycle at which the \u0394Rn first intersects the established baseline. All data are expressed as the relative quantity of the gene of interest normalized to the relative quantity of the housekeeping gene L32.\n\nSplit bladder preparation and assessment of potential contamination of bladder layers\nThe urothelium + suburothelium was dissected from the detrusor smooth muscle using fine forceps under a dissecting microscope as previously described (\nCorrow et al., 2010\n;\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n). To confirm the specificity of our split bladder preparations, urothelium + suburothelium and detrusor samples were examined for the presence of \u03b1smooth muscle actin (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and uroplakin II (1:25; American Research Products, Belmont, MA) by western blotting or reverse transcription PCR (\nCorrow et al., 2010\n;\nGirard et al., 2011\n;\nGirard et al., 2013\n). In urothelium + suburothelium layers, only uroplakin II was present (data not shown). Conversely, in detrusor samples, only \u03b1-smooth muscle actin was present (data not shown). In these studies, the use of the term urothelium refers to the urothelium and suburothelial layers.\n\nMeasurement of urinary bladder NGF, Sub P and CGRP by ELISAs\nDetermination of NGF, Sub P, and CGRP protein content in the urinary bladder of NGF-OE transgenic mice and WT littermate controls was determined using enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs) as previously described (\nGonzalez et al., 2015\n;\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n;\nVizzard, 2000b\n). Individual mouse bladders were dissected, weighed, and placed in Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (1 g tissue/20 ml; Pierce Biotechnology, Woburn, MA) with Complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. On the day of assay, individual bladders were disrupted with a Polytron homogenizer until homogeneous and centrifuged (10,000 rpm for 10 min) (\nGonzalez et al., 2015\n;\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n;\nVizzard, 2000b\n), and the supernatant was used for total protein estimation and CGRP and Sub P quantification. Total protein was determined by the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce) (\nGonzalez et al., 2015\n), and NGF, CGRP and SP were quantified using standard 96-well ELISA plates (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (\nGonzalez et al., 2015\n). Microtiter plates (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were coated with an anti-rat NGF antibody, anti-rat CGRP or anti-rat Sub P antibody. Sample and standard solutions were run in duplicate. A horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin conjugate was used to detect the antibody complex. Tetramethyl benzidine was the substrate and the enzyme activity was measured by the change in optical density. The NGF standard provided with this protocol generated a linear standard curve from 15 to 1000 pg/ml (R\n2\n= 0.998, p \u2264 0.0001) for tissue samples. The CGRP standard provided with this protocol generated a linear standard curve from 0 to 100 ng/ml (\nR\n2\n= 0.996, p \u2264 0.0001) for bladder samples (\nGonzalez et al., 2015\n). The Sub P standard provided with this protocol generated a linear standard curve from 0 to 25 ng/ml (R\n2\n= 0.997, p \u2264 0.0001) for bladder samples (\nGonzalez et al., 2015\n). The absorbance values of standards and samples were corrected by subtraction of the background absorbance due to nonspecific binding. No samples fell below the minimum detection limits of the assay and no samples were diluted prior to use. Curve fitting of standards and evaluation of NGF, Sub P and CGRP content of samples was performed using a least squares fit as previously described (\nGonzalez et al., 2015\n;\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n;\nVizzard, 2000b\n).\n\nUrinary bladder preparation, immunohistochemistry and image analysis\nThe urinary bladder from littermate WT (n = 6\u20138) and NGF-OE mice at specified postnatal ages (P7-A) (n = 6\u20138 each) was dissected and placed in Krebs solution. The bladder was cut open along the midline and pinned to a Sylgard-coated dish. Notches were made on one side of the bladder neck for orientation purposes. The bladder was incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature in cold fixative (2% paraformaldehyde + 0.2% picric acid). Fine-tipped forceps and iris scissors were used to dissect the urothelium + suburothelium from the underlying detrusor smooth muscle with the aid of a dissecting microscope (\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n). The tissue was blocked with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 20% normal goat serum, 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature and the primary antibody was applied in PBS containing 4% normal goat serum, 0.2% Triton X-100 overnight at 4\u00b0 C (\nArms et al., 2013\n;\nArms et al., 2010\n;\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n). The following primary antibodies were used: a rabbit protein gene product (PGP) 9.5 antibody (1:6,000) (Ultraclone, UK), a rabbit calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antibody (1:500) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), a rabbit substance P (Sub P) antibody (1:500)(Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Burlingame, CA), a rabbit tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibody (1:300) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), and a rabbit neurofilament 200 (NF200) antibody (1:150) (Chemicon). The tissue was washed in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% BSA, 0.1% Triton-X-100, 4 X for 15 min each at room temperature. The secondary antibody used for all whole-mount staining was a Cyanine Cy3 conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:500) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the same solution as the primary antibody. The tissue was washed 3 X for 10 min each in PBS and mounted with mounting medium (Polysciences, Warrington, PA).\n\nAssessment of immunohistochemical staining in suburothelial nerve plexus\nImmunohistochemistry and subsequent semi-quantification of neurochemical-IR in whole-mount preparations were performed on littermate WT and NGF-OE tissues simultaneously to reduce the incidence of staining variation that can occur between tissues processed on different days. Staining in experimental tissue was compared with that in experiment-matched negative controls. Whole mount preparations exhibiting immunoreactivity that was greater than the background level in experiment-matched negative controls were considered positively stained.\n\nVisualization and semi-quantitative analyses of neurochemistry of suburothelial nerve plexus\nWhole mounts from littermate WT (n = 6\u20138) and NGF-OE of various selected postnatal ages (P7-A)(n = 6\u20138 each) groups were examined under an Olympus fluorescence photomicroscope as described above. Cy3 was visualized with a filter with an excitation range of 560\u2013596 nm and an emission range of 610\u2013655 nm. Semi-quantification of neurochemical expression in the suburothelial nerve plexus was performed as previously described (\nArms et al., 2013\n;\nArms et al., 2010\n). Grayscale images acquired in tiff format were imported into MetaMorph image analysis software (version 4.5r4; Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA) as previously described (\nCorrow et al., 2010\n;\nCorrow and Vizzard, 2007\n;\nGonzalez et al., 2013\n) and images were thresholded. Images were acquired from the neck region of WT and NGF-OE mice for suburothelial nerve plexus analyses. A rectangle of fixed dimension (500 \u00d7 500 pixels) was placed on the section according to a random selection of\nx\nand\ny\ncoordinates. This process was repeated seven times for each image of the suburothelial nerve plexus. The average optical density of neurochemical immunoreactivity in the suburothelial nerve plexus was then calculated. Immunoreactivity for all neurochemicals examined (PGP9.5, CGRP, Sub P, NF-200 and TH) in the suburothelial plexus was greatest in the bladder neck region. Semi-quantification of neurochemical immunoreactivity in the suburothelial plexus was determined in the bladder neck region for all WT and NGF-OE mice.\n\nFigure preparation\nDigital images were obtained using a charge-coupled device camera (MagnaFire SP, Optronics, Optical Analysis, Nashua, NH) and LG-3 frame grabber attached to an Olympus microscope (Optical Analysis). Exposure times were held constant when images were acquired from WT and NGF-OE mice processed and analyzed on the same day. Images were imported into Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA), where groups of images were assembled and labeled.\n\nConscious, open outlet, continuous fill cystometry\nRodents (mice and rats) were anesthetized with isoflurane (3\u20134%), a lower midline abdominal incision was made, and polyethylene tubing (PE-10, Clay Adams, Parsippany, New Jersey) was inserted into the bladder dome and secured with a nylon purse-string sutures (6-zero) (\nGonzalez et al., 2013\n;\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n). The end of the PE tubing was heat flared, but the catheter did not extend into the bladder body or neck and it was not associated with inflammation or altered cystometric function (\nGonzalez et al., 2013\n;\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n). The distal end of the tubing was sealed, tunneled subcutaneously and externalized at the back of the neck out of reach (\nGonzalez et al., 2013\n;\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n). Abdominal and neck incisions were closed with nylon sutures (6-zero). Rodents (>P21) that had been weaned received postoperative analgesics (buprenorphine, 0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) and were maintained for 72 h after survival surgery to ensure recovery. Rodents (<P21) that had not been weaned received a single preoperative dose of analgesic (buprenorphine, 0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) and were used in conscious cystometry studies on the same day after a 2 h recovery period. Attempts to return rodents (<P21) postoperatively to the home cage with the dam and litter were not successful in pilot studies. Some rodents (>P21) were also evaluated with conscious cystometry on the same day as bladder catheter implantation and no significant differences in the cystometric parameters measured (see below) were observed; data were pooled in analyses.\nFor cystometry in conscious rodents (mice and rats), an unrestrained animal was placed in a Plexiglas cage with a wire bottom. Before the start of the recording, the bladder was emptied and the catheter was connected via a T-tube to a pressure transducer (Grass Model PT300, West Warwick, RI) and microinjection pump (Harvard Apparatus 22, South Natick, MA). A Small Animal Cystometry Lab Station (MED Associates, St. Albans, VT) was used for urodynamic measurements (\nGonzalez et al., 2013\n;\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n). Saline solution was infused at room temperature into the bladder at a rate of 25 \u03bcl/min (mice) or 10 ml/hr (rats) to elicit repetitive bladder contractions. At least six reproducible micturition cycles were recorded after the initial stabilization period of 25\u201330 min (\nGonzalez et al., 2013\n;\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n). In rodents that did not exhibit a vesicovesical reflex, voiding was elicited by perigenital stimulation to elicit a somatovesical reflex. Manual bladder emptying was accomplished by rapidly stroking the perigenital area for 60 s with a cotton swab. The following cystometric parameters were recorded in each animal: baseline pressure (BP; pressure at the beginning of the bladder filling), threshold pressure (TP; bladder pressure immediately prior to micturition), peak micturition pressure (MP), intercontraction interval (ICI; time between micturition events), bladder capacity (BC), void volume (VV), presence and amplitude of non-voiding bladder contractions (NVCs) (\nGonzalez et al., 2013\n;\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n). NVCs were defined as rhythmic intravesical pressure increases 5 cm H\n2\n0 above baseline, during the filling phase, without the release of fluid from the urethra. The presence of NVCs was determined in a micturition cycle, which was defined as the duration of time that includes bladder filling, at a specified rate, resulting in a voiding reflex. Bladder capacity (BC) was measured as the volume of saline infused into the bladder at the time when micturition commenced (\nGonzalez et al., 2013\n;\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n). Mice and rats in these studies had residual volume of less than 5 \u03bcl; therefore, VV and BC were similar. At the conclusion of the experiment, the rodent was euthanized (5% isoflurane plus thoracotomy).\n\nConscious cystometry and effects of netupitant, a neurokinin (NK)-1 receptor antagonist\nThe effects of netupitant, a highly potent and selective neurokinin (NK)-1 receptor antagonist (\nGreenwood-Van Meerveld et al., 2014\n;\nHaab et al., 2014\n;\nZhang et al., 2012\n), on urinary bladder function in littermate WT and NGF-OE mice of specified postnatal ages (P7-A; n = 6\u20138) were assessed using conscious, open outlet, cystometry with continuous instillation of intravesical saline (\nGonzalez et al., 2013\n;\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n). For intravesical administration of netupitant, mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and netupitant (<1.0 ml) was injected through the bladder catheter; the animals were maintained under anesthesia to prevent expulsion of netupitant via a voiding reflex. In this procedure, netupitant remained in the bladder for 30 min at which time, the drug was drained, the bladder washed with saline and animals recovered from anesthesia for 20 min before experimentation. The effectiveness of intravesical netupitant (Med Chem Express (MCE), Monmouth Junction, NJ; 0.1 \u03bcg/ml) administration was evaluated in littermate WT and NGF-OE mice from various postnatal ages (P7-A). These experiments were performed in the same mice before and after treatment with netupitant. The concentration (0.1 \u03bcg/ml) of netupitant used in these studies was based upon previous studies (\nGreenwood-Van Meerveld et al., 2014\n) and pilot studies. WT and NGF-OE mice receiving intravesical administration of vehicle (0.9% saline) (n = 6\u20138) were also evaluated. To summarize, the experimental design involves administration of a one time, intravesical infusion of netupitant (0.1 \u03bcg/ml) with cystometric data collection occurring ~75 min after infusion. At the conclusion of the experiment, the animal was euthanized (4% isoflurane plus thoracotomy). Experiments were conducted at similar times of the day to avoid the possibility that circadian variations were responsible for changes in bladder capacity measurements. An individual blinded to genotype analyzed the cystometric data; groups were decoded after data analysis (\nGonzalez et al., 2013\n;\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n).\n\nExclusion Criteria\nMice were removed from the study when adverse events occurred that included a significant postoperative event, lethargy, pain, or distress not relieved by our IACUC-approved regimen of pre- and/or postoperative analgesics (\nGonzalez et al., 2013\n;\nSchnegelsberg et al., 2010\n). In the present study, no mice or rats were excluded from the study. In addition, behavioral movements such as grooming, standing, walking, and defecation rendered bladder pressure recordings during these events unusable.\n\nUrination Patterns\nAs previously described, the spinobulbospinal micturition reflex is triggered by mechanoreceptors in the bladder and begins to elicit voiding in the rat between P16\u2013P18 (\nCapek and Jelinek, 1956\n). To determine onset of the micturition reflex in NGF-OE mice and littermate WT mice, male and female mice of both genotypes and of varying postnatal ages (P3-A) were separated from the dam (if litters were pre-weaning) and placed individually in cages lined with Whatman Grade 3 filter paper for a period of 2 hours (h) under continuous monitoring (\nStudeny et al., 2008\n). Mice were habituated to cages for 1 h in the morning (9\u201311 am) on each of two consecutive days prior to data accumulation (\nStudeny et al., 2008\n). As an additional comparison, the onset of the micturition reflex in individual postnatal (P3-A) Wistar rats of both sexes was also determined in the same manner. After 2 h, mice (NGF-OE and WT) or rats were returned to the litter (if pre-weaning) and the filter paper was examined under UV light to determine presence and size of urine spots. Urine spots were photographed under UV light (\nStudeny et al., 2008\n), area (cm\n2\n) of spots determined with large (0.2 \u2013 10 cm\n2\n) (\nBirder et al., 2002\n) and small (< 0.2 cm\n2\n) (\nBirder et al., 2002\n) spots being counted. An individual blinded to genotype analyzed these data were analyzed; groups were decoded after data analysis.\n\nStatistical Analyses\nStatistical analyses did not demonstrate differences between male and female mice of either genotype. Thus, mouse data were pooled for statistical analyses of immunoassays, Q-PCR, immunohistochemical analyses and cystometry. All values are means \u00b1 S.E.M. Linear regression analyses were performed to determine the relationship between postnatal age and NGF, Sub P or CGRP mRNA or protein expression in urinary bladder. Comparisons among experimental groups were made using ANOVA. Percentage data from image analysis were arcsin transformed to meet the requirements of the statistical test. Animals, processed and analyzed on the same day, were tested as a block in the ANOVA. When\nF\nratios exceeded the critical value (p \u2264 0.05), the Newman-Keul\u2019s post hoc test was used to compare experimental means among groups."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats of the age 6\u20138 weeks consisting of wildtype (BDNF\n+/+\n: Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) and BDNF heterozygous knockout (BDNF\n+/\u2212\n: SAGE\n\u00ae\nLabs, Boyertown, PA) were treated with intracolonic instillation of 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) at a dose of 90 mg/kg (60 mg/mL solution in 50 % EtOH) or vehicles (50 % EtOH) as described previously by us (\nXia et al., 2011\n). All experimental protocols involving animal use were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nRetrograde labeling of bladder afferent neurons\nBladder afferent neurons were specifically labeled by conventional neuronal tracing dye Fast Blue (FB, 4 %, weight/volume; Polysciences, Inc. Warrington, PA) in live animals through surgery as described previously (\nQiao and Grider, 2007\n). Briefly, the rat urinary bladder was exposed with a lower abdominal incision under anesthesia (2.5 % isoflurane). FB was injected into 10 sites (4 \u03bcL per site) in the muscular wall of the bladder to label bladder afferent neurons in the DRG. Sterilized Hamilton syringe (10 \u03bcL size) was used for injection. To prevent leakage and labeling of adjacent tissues, a cotton swab was used, close to the injection site, to wipe off any excess dye that might leak during needle withdrawal after each injection. We also avoided to inject dyes into the lumen, major blood vessels, or overlying fascial layers. The incision was closed with 4\u20130 sutures. The surgeries were done 7 days prior to harvest of tissues. We also checked the leakage of the dyes by examining the bladder and surrounding tissues after euthanasia of the rats. No contamination was found.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAnimals used for immunohistochemistry were perfused intracardiacally with oxygenated Krebs buffer (pH 7.4) (95 % O2, 5 % CO2) followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde. DRG segments were identified and isolated for cryosectioning. The on-slide immunostaining technique was used. Briefly, DRG sections (20 \u03bcm thickness) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with blocking solution containing 3 % normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) in PBST (0.3 % Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4). Samples were then incubated in primary antibodies diluted in PBST containing 5 % normal donkey serum overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The primary antibodies used in this study were rabbit anti-phospho (p) -CREB (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), mouse anti-p-CREB (1:400, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), rabbit anti-PLC\u03b3 (1:1500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit anti-p-Akt (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), and rabbit anti-p-CaMKII (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). After rinse (3 \u00d7 10 min with 0.1 M PBS), tissues were incubated with fluorescence-conjugated species-specific secondary antibody (1:500, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 2 h at room temperature. Slides were coverslipped for analysis. The specificity of the antibodies was assessed by western blot shown in the present study. We chose every third section for one specific antibody to avoid double counting.\nDRG cells exhibiting visible nucleus were counted with a Zeiss fluorescent photomicroscope. 6 to 10 sections from each DRG were randomly chosen for analysis. We focused on L1 and S1 DRGs. The results were presented as number cells per mm\n2\narea, or percentage of bladder afferent neurons expressing immunoreactivity. For the former, the area of section containing cells (excluding the area containing fibers) was selected using free-line tools integrated with the AxioVision measurement software (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) and was measured as mm\n2\nfor normalization. For the latter, the number of positive stain of protein of interest was counted in FB-labeled bladder afferent neurons and was normalized against the number of FB cells.\n\nWestern Blot\nThe protein extracts from pooled L1\u2013L2 and L6\u2013S1 DRGs were subject to centrifugation at 20,200 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, and the supernatant was removed to a fresh tube. The protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Proteins were then separated on a 10 % SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5 % milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h and then incubated with a specific primary antibody followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. For internal loading control, the same membrane was stripped and re-probed with anti-\u03b2-actin antiserum or antibody to a non-phosphorylated form of the protein examined. The concentrations of antibodies used for p-CREB, CREB, p-Akt, Akt, PLC\u03b3 and p-CaMKII were 1:1000, and for \u03b2-actin was 1:3000 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Densitometric quantification of the immunoreactive bands was performed using the software FluorChem 8800 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA).\n\nDRG explant culture\nThe segment-matched DRG pairs were used for comparison. DRGs were freshly dissected out and acutely cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM). To study the effect of BDNF, one DRG explant was treated with BDNF (50 ng/mL) and the counterpart served as control. To study the effect of a specific inhibitor, one DRG was treated with BDNF plus inhibitor and the counterpart served as control by receiving treatment of BDNF plus vehicle.\n\nExamination of voiding behavior\nVoid stain on paper (VSOP) method (\nSugino et al., 2008\n) was used to assess bladder activity. This non-invasive procedure allowed characterizing spontaneous urination patterns without surgical manipulation. We have also used this method in our previous studies (\nXia et al., 2012\n;\nYu et al., 2012a\n). Briefly, each animal was placed in a meshed cage and comparison groups were examined simultaneously. Experiments were conducted in the morning. The urine was collected naturally onto an underneath filter paper placed 20 cm below the mesh cage that contained the tested animal. We used a cage with a dimension of 25\u00d715\u00d715 cm\n3\n(L\u00d7W\u00d7H). The number of urine drops from each animal in a 2-h window was counted. The diameters of the urine drops were measured at 4 directions (two cross-overs and two diagonal) and averaged for each drop.\n\nData analysis\nThe results from each study were presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Comparison between control and experimental groups was made by using Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric one-way ANOVA, or by student t-test. Differences between means at a level of p \u2264 0.05 were considered to be significant."

    "Methods": "Animals and Induction of Status Epilepticus\nAdult male Spargue Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories International, CA) between 60\u201390 days of age were provided with unrestricted access to food and water in temperature and humidity controlled housing with a 12 hour light- 12 hour dark cycle (lights on 7:00 AM). The rats were injected with 1mg/kg methyl-scopolamine (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) intraperitoneally (IP) to block peripheral cholinergic effects 30 minutes prior to pilocarpine-induced status epilpepticus (SE). 385mg/kg pilocarpine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., MO) was administrated IP to the SE rats, and control rats were given 1/10 th dose (38.5mg/kg) of pilocaprine. Rats were monitored for appearance of stage V Racine seizures and received 6mg/kg diazapam (Hospira Inc., IL) one hour after the induction of SE. The seizure group received an additional half dose (3 mg/kg) every two hours after the initial diazepam injection until all behavioral seizures resolved. The Stanford Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all the protocols used.\n\nTissue Collection and RNA Extraction\nBoth SE and control groups were sacrificed at 4, 12, and 48 h after the induction of SE. The animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, and the hippocampal tissue was dissected out, frozen on dry ice, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA extraction. For qRT-PCR and northern blots, total and small RNAs were extracted from the rat hippocampi using the mirVANA isolation kit according to the protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA). Total RNA was isolated from cell lines using Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) (48 h after transfection if transfected). RNA extraction of sucrose gradient fractions were carried out by phenol: chloroform: isoamylalcohol (Sigma-Aldrich, MO). The RNA concentration of extracted RNAs was measured and the A260/280 ratio was determined using Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific NanoDrop, DE). The extracted RNAs were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.\n\nQuantitative Real-time PCR\nTotal RNA and random hexamers were used for pri-miR-21,\nTGFBR2\nmRNA,\nNT-3\nmRNA; small RNA and specific stem loop primers were used for pre- and mature miR-21. All RNA concentrations were determined first, and reverse transcription was performed using TaqMan\u00ae Reverse Transcription Reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA). For pre-miR-21, small RNA and reverse transcription primers (designed by Thermo Fisher Scientific based on rat pre-miR-21 sequence) were incubated at a denaturing step (85\u00b0C for 5 min and 65\u00b0C for 5 min) before reverse transcription (25\u00b0C for 10 min, 48\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 5 min). Real-time PCR reactions were carried out in 96-well OptiAmp fast plates and the StepOnePlus\u2122 Real-Time PCR System (Stanford PAN Facility). The reaction mix in each well contained 10 ul of the TaqMan\u00ae Universal Master Mix II (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA), 1 ul of the FAM-MGB probe/primer mix (20x) for gene of interest (purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA; pri-miR-21: Rn03464993_pri; TGFBR2: Rn00579682_m1; NT-3: Rn00579280; pre-miR-21: CS51000; mature miR-21: 000397), 9 ul of cDNA/ddH2O. For pri-miR-21,\nTGFBR2\nmRNA,\nNT-3\nmRNA and mature miR-21, 25 ng cDNA/well was used; for pre-miR-2, 125 ng cDNA/well was used. PPIA/cyclophilin (Rn00690933) (\nKinjo et al., 2016\n;\nRisbud et al., 2011\n;\nRisbud and Porter, 2013\n) was used as housekeeping gene for pri-miR-21,\nTGFBR2\nmRNA,\nNT-3\nmRNA; 4.5S RNA(H) (001716) (\nRisbud et al., 2011\n;\nRisbud and Porter, 2013\n) was used as housekeeping gene for pre- and mature miR-21. The housekeeping genes did not vary across treatment groups for any of the time points. A relative standard curve was used to calculate the fold changes of pri-miR-21 in SE samples. Comparative C\nT\nMethod (\u0394\u0394Ct) was used to calculate the fold changes of other genes of interest. Each sample was run in triplicates.\n\nSmall RNA Northern Blots\nFor small RNA northern blots, 3 ug of MirVana extracted small RNA from hippocampal tissues or 10 ug of Trizol extracted RNA from cell culture was electrophoresed on 15% (w/v) acrylamide/7M urea gel and transferred onto a Genescreen Plus (Perkin Elmer, MA) membrane. Hybridization was done overnight in PerfectHyb Plus (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) buffer at 65\u00b0C using 32P labeled hsa-miR-21-5p probe (miRCURY LNA\u2122 Detection probe)(Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark) or at 35\u00b0C with U6 probe (IDT, CA) (\nLi et al., 2016\n;\nRoy-Chaudhuri et al., 2014\n).\n\nThermodynamic calculation\nMinimum free energy of binding of pre-miR-21 to the target 3\u2032UTRs (\nTGFBR\n2 and\nNT-3\n) and to the modified\nTGFBR\n2 3\u2032UTRs was calculated using RNAhybrid. Minimum free energy of folding of the pre-miR-21 and\nTGFBR2\n3\u2032UTR was calculated using Mfold.\n\nCell culture and Plasmid constructs\nHEK 293, U87, HeLa, and Neuro2A cell lines were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s media (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% L-Glutamine, 1% Non-essential amino acids and 1% Pen-strep (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA).\nFor cloning of the\nTGFBR2\nreporter construct, the 3\u2032UTR of\nTGFBR2\nwas PCR amplified (primers used: 5\u2032-TAGGCGATCGCTCGAGCTCTTCTGGGGCAGGCTG -3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCGCGTCGACACTAGTGCCAAACTGTGCTTGAGCAATC-3\u2032) from human genomic DNA and cloned downstream of the\nRenilla\nluciferase gene in XhoI and SpeI digested psiCHECK-2 vector (Promega, WI) using Infusion Cloning HD kit (Clontech, CA). Similarly, the\nNT-3\nreporter vector was constructed by PCR amplifying the 3\u2032UTR of human\nNTF3\nusing primers (5\u2032-TAGGCGATCGCTCGAGATTGGCATCTCTCCCCATAT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCGCGTCGACACT AGTACAACAGTCATGGCCTTG AC-3\u2032).\nSite-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, CA) was carried out on psiCheck-\nTGFBR2\nconstruct to first generate the TGFBR2-del reporter construct and then on psiCheck-\nTGFBR2\n-del construct to generate the TGFBR2-3p-scr reporter construct. Primers for\nTGFBR2\n-del construct Primers for the\nTGFBR2\n-del construct were 5\u2032-GCTGTGGGGATAAGCAGA AACAACATAGAGCATTCTATGCC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGCATAGAATGCTCTATGTTGTT TCTGCTTATCCCCACAGC-3\u2032. Primers for the\nTGFBR2\n-3p-scr construct were 5\u2032GCTGTGGGGATAAGCAGAAACAGATGGGAGTAGAGC GGGCACACATAGAGCATTCTATGCCTTTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CAAAGGCATAGAATGCTCTAT GTGTGCCCGCTCTACTCCCATCTGTTTCTGCTTATCCCCACAGC -3\u2032.\nTo generate the pSh-21 construct for robust expression of mature hsa-miR-21, sense oligonucleotides (5\u2032-GATCTCAACATCAGTCTGATAAGCTACTCCTGACCCAAGTAGCT TATCAGACTGATGTTGATTTTTGTAC-3\u2032) and antisense oligonucleotides (5\u2032AAAAATCAA CATCAGTCTGATAAGCTACTTGGGTCAGGAGTAGCTTATCAGACTGATGTTGA) were chemically synthesized (IDT, CA); both strands annealed and inserted between BglII and KpnI sites downstream of the U6 Pol III promoter. To generate the pCMV-21 construct overexpressing precursor and mature hsa-miR-21, a ~500 nt human genomic region harboring miR-21 locus was PCR amplified. Primers used were FW: 5\u2032-GACAAGCTTGCGGCCGCCCTTTAGGAGCATT ATGAGCAT-3\u2032 and RV: 5\u2032-ATCCTCTAG AGTCGACGAAGGTCAAGTAACAGTCATAC-3\u2032. The PCR amplicon was inserted into a digested CMV expression vector (Pol II promoter) using Infusion Cloning HD kit (Clontech, CA).\n\nReporter assays\nDual-luciferase assay (Promega, WI) was performed 24 hours after transfection according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol and detected by a Modulas Microplate Luminometer (Turner Biosystems, CA). For transfection in a 24-well plate, 125 ng of psiCHECK reporter plasmid was co-transfected with 125 ng of miR-21 overexpression plasmids (pSh-21 or pCMV-21) in HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA). Cell seeding was performed at a concentration of 5 \u00d7 10\n4\ncells for HEK 293 per well in a 24-well plate.\n\nRibosome profiles and Polysome Fractionation\nU-87 cells (~ 6 \u00d7 10\n7\n) grown in 15 cm dish for ~36 hours were treated with either cycloheximide (100 ug/ml) for 5 mins or puromycin (200 ug/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) for half hour before harvesting. Lysis was carried out in a buffer containing 150 mM KCl, 15 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 100 ug/ml cycloheximide, 1% Triton X-100 and 500 units/ml RNasin Plus (Promega, WI). Velocity sedimentation was carried out at 35,000 rpm for 2 hours 45 minutes in a 10\u201350% sucrose gradient. The absorbance profile was obtained at 254 nm by using a Foxy gradient fractionator (Brandel, MD).\n\nStatistics and Quantification\nStatistical analysis was performed using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-Test or one-way ANOVA with Kruskal-Wallis (Prism 6.0). A\np-\nvalue of 0.05 or lower was considered statistically significant. The qRT-PCR assays were performed in triplicate. The luciferase assays were done independently at least twice with each experiment done in 4 replicates to generate individual data points that were all used to calculate SEM. In northern blots, the pre-miR-21 and mature miR-21 levels were normalized to U6 using ImageJ software. In polysome profiling, the fractions were grouped into unbound (fractions 1\u20135), 80S (fraction 6) and polysome (fractions 7\u201314). Quantification of pre-miR-21 or mature miR-21 in each group was presented as percentage of the total signals of pre-miR-21 or mature miR-21 (sum of pre-miR-21 or mature miR-21 signals in all fractions after background subtraction from northern blots using Bio-Rad Quantify One \u00ae)."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nFor these experiments, we used 104 adult female (weigh 200\u2013250 g) and 3 postnatal day 10 (P10) Wistar rats, 4 adult female Sprague Dawley (SD, weigh 200\u2013250 g), and 4 adult female Fischer 344 rats (F344, weigh 150\u2013200 g). Wistar rats were employed for both histology and cystometry whereas SD and F344 rats were used for histological comparison. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and National Institutes of Health guidelines on animal care were strictly followed to minimize the number of animals used and any potential suffering.\n\n2.2. Spinal cord surgery\nTwo SCI animal models were used. Because TH\n+\nneurons were observed throughout the length of the spinal cord, we transected the spinal cord at the higher thoracic level (T4) to study injury-induced intraspinal plasticity, as a high level of injury affects a substantial amount of spinal cord tissue below the injury. To evaluate bladder function, however, we performed T10-transection to complete remove supraspinal control and partially remove some propriospinal projections onto spinal micturition neuronal circuits as descending propriospinal projections may affect bladder function following SCI. Animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane. A partial laminectomy was performed at T3 or T9 vertebra to expose the dorsal spinal cord. The spinal cord was completely transected at T4 (T4\u2013Tx; n = 18) or at T10 (T10\u2013Tx; n = 52) using a No.11 blade. Lesion completeness was verified visually at the time of surgery and histologically following perfusion. Overlying musculature and skin were then closed. Animals were administered Lactated Ringer\u2019s solution (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL), cefazolin (10 mg/kg), and buprenex (0.1 mg/kg; Reckitt Benckiser) post-operatively. Bladders were manually expressed at least twice daily until sacrifice.\n\n2.3. ELISA for DA\nDA expression in the rat lumbosacral spinal cord was examined with a DA ELISA kit (Eagle Biosciences, Nashua, NH). Na\u00efve or T10\u2013Tx rats 1, 3, or 6 weeks after injury (n = 3/group) were euthanized with an overdose of Euthasol and then transcardially perfused with 100 ml ice-cold 0.1 M PBS. The dorsal half of L6\u2013S3 spinal cord (~0.5 cm) was quickly dissected and frozen on dry ice. Samples were sonicated in lysate buffer (PBS with 0.25% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% BSA, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 \u03bcl/ml aprotinin) (\nTaylor et al., 2006\n). ELISA plates were incubated with the samples per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. DA levels between groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Fisher\u2019s PLSD\npost hoc\ntests (SPSS).\n\n2.4. Fluorogold injection\nTo retrogradely label sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs) in the intermediolateral cell column (IML) and parasympathetic pre-ganglionic neurons (PPNs) in the lower lumbosacral cord, na\u00efve rats (n = 6) received an intraperitoneal injection of Fluorogold (FG, 0.4 ml of 0.5% in distilled water; Fluorochrome, Denver, Colorado) (\nAkhavan et al., 2006\n). Animals were perfused 1 week later.\n\n2.5. Bladder cystometry\nWe performed cystometry to assess bladder function in rats with T10\u2013Tx (n = 30) 3 weeks after injury. Na\u00efve rats (n = 6) were used as controls. All rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and an incision was made in the lower abdomen to expose the urinary bladder. The apex of the bladder dome was punctured using an 18-gauge needle. One end of a catheter (PE-60; Clay Adams) was inserted into the bladder (\nYoshiyama et al., 1999\n;\nMitsui et al., 2005\n). The other end of the catheter was tunneled subcutaneously and out the back. The abdominal wall was then sutured closed. To intravenously deliver pharmacological agents, a separate cannula (PE-10) filled with heparinized saline (1000 U/ml) was implanted in the right femoral vein. The peripheral end was connected to a blunt, T-shaped 27-gauge needle.\nImmediately after removal of isoflurane, rats were lightly anesthetized with urethane (1.2 g/kg in na\u00efve rats and 0.8 g/kg in SCI rats,\ni.p\n.) (\nYoshiyama et al., 2013\n) and placed in a restraining cage (KN-326, Natsume). The bladder catheter was connected to a pressure transducer (Transbridge, WPI) and a microinjection pump (SP2001, WPI). Room-temperature saline was slowly infused into the bladder (0.1 ml/min). Though micturition cycles usually became stable and fairly regular after approximately 30 min of saline infusion, we waited for at least 1 h before starting the recording to allow for ample adaptation time. At least five continuous stable micturition cycles pre- and post-drug delivery were collected per rat. Experiments lasted no longer than 3 h. Urodynamic parameters including the voiding amplitudes of intravesical bladder pressure (VA), the intervals between two sequential voiding events (VI), and the voiding volumes (VV) were measured (\nFig. 1\n). To measure the VV, expelled urine in each voiding cycle was collected into a small plastic box during cystometry. In rats with SCI, the number of non-voiding contractions (NVC) per micturition episode was also calculated. NVC are defined as rhythmic intravesical pressure increases 5 mm Hg from baseline without a release of fluid from urethra (\nMitsui et al., 2005\n). In each rat, the parameter values in 5 voiding cycles were averaged to determine the mean value for statistical analysis. Animals were sacrificed at the end of this experiment.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nCartoon illustrating various urodynamic parameters measured during bladder cystometry. In both na\u00efve (\nA\n) and complete SCI (\nB\n) rats, the voiding amplitudes of intravesical pressure (VA) are always calculated from the peak of voiding onset to the baseline of bladder activity. The voiding intervals (VI) are defined as the time duration between two continuous voiding onsets. Compared to the voiding behavior in na\u00efve rats (\nA\n), spinal bladder reflex in SCI rats (\nB\n) displays greater amplitudes of voiding pressure and more variable voiding patterns, based on the extent of spontaneous bladder reflex recovery. Notably, non-voiding bladder contractions (#) often occur only in rats with SCI and not in na\u00efve rats.\n\n2.6. Pharmacological interventions of spinal DA receptors\nEquivalent volumes of 0.9% saline were delivered intravenously (\ni.v\n.)\nvia\nfemoral vein to obtain pre-treatment measurements. Afterwards, DA receptor agonists or antagonists (Tocris Cookson) were given\ni.v\n. (\nTable 1\n). The doses of the drugs used were chosen on the basis of previously published data (\nYoshimura et al., 1998\n;\nSeki et al., 2001\n;\nOgawa et al., 2006\n). All drugs were dissolved in 0.9% saline. Urodynamic data collection was performed within 30 min after drug delivery. The post-drug parameters for each rat, with the exception of NVC, were calculated as a percentage of individual baseline values. To compare normally distributed parameters following saline or single drug application, a paired Student\u2019s\nt\n-test was used, to compare the parameters between saline or application of multiple drug doses, a repeated measures one-way ANOVA followed by paired\nt\n-test was employed. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for nonparametric data.\nTable 1.\nDrugs and the effects on bladder non-voiding contractions (NVC) in SCI rats.\nDrugs\nTypes\n*\nDose (mg/kg)\nRats\nBladder NVC\nSaline\nDrugs\nFlupenthixol\nNon-selective DR antagonist\n1.2\n2.4\nN = 6\n2.3 \u00b1 0.6\n0.9 \u00b1 0.2\n*\n0.7 \u00b1 0.2\n**\nSKF 38393\nD\n1-\nlike receptor agonist\n3.0\nN = 4\n1.5 \u00b1 0.7\n1.9 \u00b1 0.7\nSCH 23390\nD\n1\n-like receptor antagonist\n3.0\nN = 6\n1.7 \u00b1 0.6\n1.5 \u00b1 0.7\nQuinpirole\nD\n2\n-like receptor agonist\n0.1\nN = 6\n2.4 \u00b1 0.6\n2.3 \u00b1 0.5\nRemoxipride\nD\n2\n-like receptor antagonist\n1.0\nN = 4\n2.6 \u00b1 0.7\n2.6 \u00b1 1.6\nOpen in a new tab\nDR, dopamine receptor.\n*\np\n= 0.09 compared to saline administration.\n**\np\n< 0.05 compared to saline administration.\n\n2.7. 6-OHDA injections into L6/S1 spinal cord\nTo determine the role of lumbosacral TH\n+\nneurons in the spinal bladder reflex, we depleted these cells by injecting the catecholaminergic neurotoxic agent 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) (\nWinkler et al., 1996\n;\nKondoh et al., 2005\n) into the L6/S1 spinal cord. Two weeks after T10\u2013Tx, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane, the L6/S1 spinal cord was exposed by laminectomy and 6 \u03bcl 0.2% 6-OHDA was slowly injected into the tissue using a glass micropipette connected to a Hamilton syringe (3 sites per side, 1.5 mm distance between adjacent injections in each side; coordination: 0.5 mm lateral from the midline, 0.5 and 1.0 mm depth, 0.5 \u03bcl per depth; n = 5). Some T10\u2013Tx rats (n = 5) were injected only with saline vehicle. Overlying musculature and skin was closed. One week later, the rats underwent bladder catheterization and cystometry assessments, as described above. Animals were then perfused.\n\n2.8. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) transsynaptic tracing\nNa\u00efve (n = 8) or T10\u2013Tx rats 3 weeks after injury (n = 8) were anesthetized. An abdominal incision was made to expose the urinary bladder. PRV-152 (Bartha strain, 10\n9\npfu/ml) encoding for green fluorescent protein (GFP) was slowly injected into the ventral bladder detrusor muscle with a Hamilton syringe (3 sites, 2 \u03bcl/site, for a total of 6 \u03bcl) (\nNadelhaft and Vera, 1995\n). Injection sites were immediately sealed with a small drop of tissue glue. The incision was closed with sutures. Animals were perfused 48 or 72 h later (n = 4 per group) for histological analysis.\n\n2.9. Histology\n2.9.1. Tissue processing\nNa\u00efve (n = 12 in adult and 3 in P10 Wistar, 4 in SD, 4 in F344) or SCI animals were overdosed with Euthasol and then perfused transcardially with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Spinal cords were dissected, divided into two 3 cm portions of caudal (T13\u2013S4) and rostral (T5\u2013T12) segments, post-fixed, and cryoprotected. Coronal (20 \u03bcm) or horizontal (35 \u03bcm) sections were obtained using a cryostat (\nCameron et al., 2006\n) and kept in order. To check for possible TH\n+\nefferents, the ventral efferent nerve roots at L1\u2013S3 levels from na\u00efve (n = 3) and T4-transected (n = 3) adult Wistar rats were dissected and cryosectioned longitudinally (10 \u03bcm). Brains of na\u00efve rats (n = 6) were cryosectioned sagittally at 35 \u03bcm.\n2.9.2. Immunohistochemistry\nSpinal cord coronal sections 200 \u03bcm apart or longitudinal sections 210 \u03bcm apart were used in each immunostaining (\nHou et al., 2013\n). Mounted spinal coronal sections or free-floating longitudinal tissue sections were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution (Tris-buffered saline, TBS, containing 5% goat serum and 0.5% triton X-100) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. We used primary antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, rabbit or mouse, 1:1000, Millipore), dopamine-\u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH, mouse, 1:1000, Millipore), dopamine decarboxylase (DDC or AADC, rabbit, 1:1000, Abcam), dopamine transporter (DAT, rabbit, 1:500, Synaptic Systems), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT, mouse, 1:200, Millipore), NeuN (mouse, 1:200, Chemicon), D\n1\n-like receptors (rabbit, 1:600, Abcam), D\n2\n-like receptors (rabbit, 1:200, Millipore), c-fos (mouse, 1:500, Abcam), GFP (mouse, 1:500, Millipore). Longitudinal sections of ventral nerve roots were incubated with antibodies against TH (rabbit, 1:1000) and Tuj1 (chicken, 1:1000, Aves). Following rinsing, sections were by incubated in Alexa 488 or 594-conjugated goat or donkey secondary antibodies (1:500, Invitrogen) for at least 3 h at room temperature. For immunostaining for TH (mouse), DDC, and DAT, antigen retrieval technique was applied. Sections were incubated with 10% Target Retrieval Solution (Dako) prior to performing standard immunohistochemical procedures, as described. Slides were coverslipped with mounting medium containing DAPI except those labeled with FG. Sections were imaged using a Leica DM5500B microscope and a Leica confocal (TCS SP2).\n2.9.3. Quantitative analysis\nQuantification was conducted by an observer blinded to group identity. All TH\n+\ncells in the medial gray matter including the lateral parasympathetic nuclei and lamina X around the central canal were counted at 200\u00d7 magnification in each section of one series of coronal lumbosacral cord sections. Only cells displaying typical neuronal morphology with cellular processes and a DAPI\n+\nnucleus were counted. TH\n+\ncells and TH\n+\n/DDC\n+\ncells in the lateral parasympathetic nuclei were counted in one series of longitudinal spinal cord sections. The percentage of TH\n+\n/DDC\n+\ncells to the total number of TH\n+\ncells per rat was calculated. In 6-OHDA or saline-injected spinal cords, TH\n+\nneurons were counted in 5 mm-long longitudinal sections containing L6/S1 level. To quantify PRV-152 infected TH\n+\nneurons, a series of coronal L6/S1 spinal cord sections were immunostained for TH and GFP. A total of GFP-labeled cells or GFP\n+\n/TH\n+\ncells were then counted in these sections. An unpaired Student\u2019s\nt\n-test was used to analyze these data.\n\n2.10. Statistics\nStatistical analyses were performed in IBM SPSS 22. Significance throughout all experiments was set at\np\n< 0.05. Data were represented as mean \u00b1 SEM."

    "Methods": "Sprague-Dawley rat litters (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were housed in accordance with guidelines from the National Institutes of Health. Hippocampal slice cultures were prepared from 12-day-old rats as previously described (Bendiske et al., 2002;Wisniewski et al., 2011). Slices were cut from pre-cooled hippocampi and briefly placed in ice-cold buffer containing 124 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 4 mM MgSO4, 1.25 mM KH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, 10 mMd-glucose, and 2 mM ascorbic acid. Groups of 8\u20139 slices were quickly distributed on the Biopore PTFE membrane of each Millicell-CM culture insert (Fisher Scientific; Pittsburgh, PA) which was in contact with culture medium containing 50% Basal Medium Eagle, 25% Earl's balanced salt solution, 25% regular horse serum, and the following concentrations of supplements: 136 mM glutamine, 40 mM glucose, 0.5 mM ascorbic acid, 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.3) 1 mg/l insulin, 5 units/ml of penicillin, and 5 mg/l streptomycin. Medium was changed every 2\u20133 days and the surface of the slices exposed to humidified air plus 5% CO2at 37 \u00b0C. The slices consistently display characteristics of the adult hippocampus by two weeks in culture, including the distinct change in glycosylation state of adhesion molecules (Bahr, 1995;Bahr et al., 1995a;Hoffman et al., 2001), and such synaptic maturation markers are routinely confirmed in each preparation of slice cultures.\n\nThe blast protocol was conducted at culture day 22\u201328, in which hippocampal slices in a 6-well plate were sealed within an air-tight containment filled with serum-free media (horse serum was replaced with HEPES-buffered saline). Next, the plate was clamped in a vertical position using a rig that was then secured within a 37 \u00b0C water tank, 18 cm from the front inner wall. The vertical position directs the military blast wave to the surface of the brain slices, thus minimizing lateral stress on adhesion between the tissue and culture insert membranes. Reproducible assemblies of RDX (1.7 g) were positioned to produce an explosive blast 15 cm outside the tank's 2-cm wall, creating a well-defined air shockwave that propagates into and through the volume of water to the culture plate (total standoff distance = 35 cm). The specific setup distances took into consideration 1) the small explosive charge size that was accessible for the study and its short duration, 2) the charge size and number of consecutive charges that could be detonated in the Aberdeen Proving Ground facility by Army Research Laboratory personnel, and 3) the desired pressure impact for tests on cellular/synaptic integrity while avoiding damage to the culture insert Biopore support membrane or the air-tight containment. Control slices in a similar 6-well plate received mock treatment of equal submerge time in the containment with serum-free media. The slice cultures (50\u201360 per condition) were exposed to 1\u20133 RDX blasts approximately 4 min apart, and then quickly returned to normal culture conditions. One to two days after the blast event(s), slices were gently harvested into groups of 7\u2013 9 each using ice-cold isosmotic buffer containing protease inhibitors, then homogenized in lysis buffer (Karanian et al., 2005). Some slice cultures were first infused with 100 \u03bcMN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) in serum-free media, and incubated for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C before being rapidly harvested in isosmotic buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors. For a positive control of excitotoxicity, other slices were 1) treated with 100 \u03bcM \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C, 2) given three media changes to washout the AMPA, 3) infused with CNQX and MK801 during the media changes in order to quench further glutamatergic activity, and 4) harvested 30\u2013 48 h later in ice-cold buffer containing protease inhibitors. A subset of slices were fixed and subjected to Fluoro-Jade B staining (Neuroscience Associates; Knoxville, Tennessee) or anti-synaptophysin immunocyto-chemistry. Images were acquired using a Nikon Ti-E microscope linked to the C2 confocal system and software, as well as with Zeiss 710 and Zeiss 780 confocal systems.\n\nProtein content of the slice samples was determined with a BSA standard, and equal protein aliquots were assessed by immunoblot for synaptic markers. Blots were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with anti-synaptophysin (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Indiana), anti-GluR1 (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts), anti-HDAC2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California), anti-pCofilin-s3 (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts), anti-active MAPK (pERK1/pERK2; Cell Signaling, Beverly, Massachusetts), and antibodies that selectively recognize calpain-mediated spectrin breakdown product (Bahr et al., 1995b). Anti-IgG-alkaline phosphatase and anti-IgG-horse radish per-oxidase conjugates were used for the secondary antibody step, and development of antigen staining used either the 5 bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium substrate system or a chemiluminescence protocol (GE Amersham Imager AI600RGB). Each immunoblot was also stained with anti-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to provide a protein load control. Stained antigens were analyzed to determine integrated optical density (IOD) with BIOQUANT software (R & M Biometrics, Nashville, Tennessee). Within blots, each IOD value was normalized to percent of mock treatment control samples, and the means \u00b1 SEM were compared using unpaired, two-tailed t-tests or ANOVA."

    "Methods": "Subjects and pre-surgical procedures\nSixty adult (3 months old) normal cycling female Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were used as this paradigm more closely mimics clinical TBI. Moreover, we have previously shown that estrous stage at the time of injury does not impact subsequent recovery (\nWagner et al., 2004\n;\nMonaco et al., 2013\n). Rats were paired housed in ventilated polycarbonate rat cages and maintained in a temperature (21 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) and light (on 0700-1900 h) controlled environment with food and water available\nad libitum\n. During the week of acclimatization the rats were pre-trained on the rotarod and beam-walk tasks (see\nFig. 1\nfor schematic of experimental paradigm) and then were randomly assigned to the following groups: TBI + STD; n=10, TBI + EE (continuous); n=10, TBI + EE (6 hours); n=10, TBI + EE (4 hours); n=10 and their respective Sham controls (n=20). All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh. Every attempt was made to limit the number of rats used and to minimize suffering.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nFlow chart of the experimental paradigm depicting pre-and-post injury manipulations. Note that the beam tests consisted of two separate evaluations (i.e., beam-balance and beam-walk). Also, the rotarod test was performed every other day during post-operative days 1-19. Lastly, the water maze paradigm consisted of hidden platform assessments that occurred on days 14-18, a single 30-sec probe trial that was conducted on post-operative day 19 prior to a single visible platform assessment. Rats were sacrificed at 3 weeks.\n\nSurgery\nA controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury was produced as previously described (\nKline at al., 2007\n,\n2010\n,\n2012\n;\nBondi et al., 2014a\n). Briefly, surgical anesthesia was induced and maintained with 4% and 2% concentrations of isoflurane, respectively, in 2:1 N\n2\nO:O\n2\n. After endotracheal intubation the rats (250-270 g) were secured in a stereotaxic frame and ventilated mechanically. Core temperature was maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C with a heating pad. Employing aseptic procedures a midline scalp incision was made, the skin and fascia were reflected to expose the skull, and a craniectomy (6-mm in diameter) was made in the right hemisphere with a hand held trephine. The bone flap was removed and the craniectomy was enlarged further to accommodate the impact tip (6 mm, flat), which was centered and lowered through the craniectomy until it touched the dura mater, then the rod was retracted and the impact tip was advanced 2.8 mm farther to produce a moderate-to-severe brain injury (2.8 mm tissue deformation at 4 m/sec). Anesthesia was discontinued immediately after the impact and the incision was promptly closed. Once sutured, the rats were extubated and assessed for acute neurological outcome. Sham rats underwent all surgical procedures, except the impact.\n\nAcute neurological evaluation\nHind limb reflexive ability was assessed immediately following the cessation of anesthesia by gently squeezing the rats\u2019 paw every 5 sec and recording the time to elicit a withdrawal response. Return of the righting reflex was determined by the time required to turn from the supine to prone position on three consecutive trials.\n\nHousing conditions: environmental manipulation\nAfter the effects of surgical anesthesia abated and the rats were able to ambulate spontaneously, they were returned to the colony where those designated for continuous enrichment were placed in specifically designed steel-wire cages (91\u00d776\u00d750 cm). The EE cages consisted of three levels with ladders to ambulate from one level to another and contained various toys (e.g., balls, blocks, and tubes), nesting materials (e.g., paper towels), and\nad libitum\nfood and water (\nKline et al., 2007\n;\nSozda et al., 2010\n;\nBondi et al., 2014b\n,\n2015\n). To maintain novelty, the objects were rearranged every day and changed each time the cage was cleaned, which was twice per week. Ten rats, including TBI and sham controls, were housed together to minimize variability between groups. Rats in the STD and abbreviated EE conditions were placed back into the standard ventilated polycarbonate rat cages (37\u00d725\u00d718 cm, 2 rats per cage) with only food and water. The abbreviated EE rats were removed from the STD cage and placed in the EE for their prescribed time of 4 hr or 6 hr every day and then transferred back to the STD cage until the next enrichment session.\n\nMotor performance: beam-balance and beam-walk\nMotor function was assessed using well-established beam-balance and beam-walk tasks (\nKline et al., 2010\n,\n2012\n;\nCheng 2008\n,\n2012\n,\n2016\n). Performance on the beam-balance is assessed by recording the time (maximum of 60 sec per trial) that the rats can maintain their balance on an elevated narrow wooden beam (90 cm above floor level, 1.5 cm wide, and 34 cm in length). The beam-walk task, modified from that originally devised by Feeney and colleagues (\nFeeney et al., 1982\n), and used extensively in our laboratory (\nYelleswarapu et al., 2012\n;\nCheng et al., 2008\n,\n2012\n,\n2016\n), consists of training/assessing rats using a negative-reinforcement paradigm to escape bright light and white noise by traversing an elevated narrow beam (90 cm above floor level, 2.5 cm wide, and 100 cm in length) and entering a darkened goal box at the opposite end. Performance on the beam-walk consists of recording time to traverse the beam as well as the distance traveled. The scoring criteria for distance traveled is based on a rating scale from 0 to 5, where 0 indicates an inability to ambulate beyond the start point, 1-4 corresponds to distal segments of 20, 40, 60, or 80 cm from the starting point, respectively, and 5 indicates traversal of the entire length of the beam (100 cm) and entrance into the goal box. Rats were trained prior to TBI or sham injury to perform the tasks without errors (i.e., maintain their balance for 60 sec and traverse the beam in under 5 sec). A baseline performance assessment was taken on the day of surgery. Performance was assessed on post-operative days 1-5 and consisted of three trials (60 sec allotted time per trial) per day on each task. The average daily scores for each subject were used in the statistical analyses.\n\nMotor performance: rotarod\nA well-established rotarod task was utilized to evaluate fine locomotor and balance function (\nHamm et al., 1994\n;\nHamm, 2001\n;\nMonaco et al., 2013\n). Briefly, training began three days prior to surgery and consisted of both fixed rate and accelerating protocols until the rats were proficient. On the day of surgery the rats received three trials according to the accelerating protocol (i.e., 15-80 rotations per minute [rpm] for a maximum of 90 sec) to establish baseline performance. The testing procedure consisted of three trials (inter-trial interval of 5 min) where duration (maximum 90 sec) and speed (15-80 rpm), before losing balance and falling off the accelerating rotating rod (or completing two full revolutions, whichever occurred first), were recorded. Assessments were conducted every other day beginning on post-operative days 1 and continuing until day 19. The average daily scores for each subject were used in the statistical analyses.\n\nCognitive performance: spatial learning\nSpatial learning was assessed using a well-established Morris water maze (MWM) task (\nMorris, 1984\n;\nKline et al., 2002a\n,\nb\n,\n2007\n,\n2010\n,\n2012\n;\nOlsen et al., 2012\n). The maze consisted of a plastic pool (180 cm diameter; 60 cm high) filled with tap water (26 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) to a depth of 28 cm and was positioned in a room with prominent extra-maze cues. The platform was a clear Plexiglas stand (10 cm diameter, 26 cm high) that was positioned 26 cm from the maze wall in the southwest quadrant and held constant for each rat. Acquisition of spatial learning began on post-operative day 14 and entailed providing a block of four daily trials for five consecutive days (14-18) to locate the escape platform when it was submerged 2 cm below the water surface. On day 19 the platform was raised 2 cm above the water surface as a control procedure to determine the contributions of non-spatial factors (e.g., sensory-motor function, motivation, and visual acuity) on cognitive performance. For each daily block of trials the rats were placed in the pool facing the wall at each of the four possible start locations (north, east, south, and west) in a quasi-randomized manner. Each trial lasted until the rat climbed onto the platform or until 120 sec had elapsed, whichever occurred first. The rats that failed to locate the escape platform within the allotted time were manually guided to it. All rats remained on the platform for 30 sec before being placed in a heated incubator between trials (4-min inter-trial interval). The times of the 4 daily trials for each rat were averaged and used in the statistical analyses.\n\nCognitive performance: memory retention\nOne day after the final acquisition training session (day 19), all rats were given a probe trial to measure retention. Briefly, the platform was removed from the pool and the rats were placed in the pool from the location point most distal to the quadrant where the platform was previously located (i.e., \u201ctarget quadrant\u201d) and allowed to freely explore the pool for 30 sec. The time spent searching in the target quadrant is recorded and used in the statistical analyses. The data were obtained using ANY-maze video tracking software.\n\nHistology: quantification of cortical lesion volume\nThree weeks after surgery the rats were anesthetized with Fatal-Plus\u00ae (0.3 mL, i.p.) and perfused transcardially with 200 mL 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) followed by 300 mL 4% paraformaldehyde. The heads were placed in the perfusate and one week later the brains were extracted, post-fixed further, dehydrated with alcohols, and embedded in paraffin. Coronal sections (7\u03bcm thick) were cut at 1-mm intervals through the lesion on a rotary microtome and mounted on Superfrost\n\u00ae\n/Plus glass microscope slides. After drying at room temperature, the sections were deparaffinized in xylenes, rehydrated, and stained with Cresyl violet. An observer blinded to experimental conditions analyzed cortical lesion volumes (mm\n3\n) by calculating the area of the lesion (mm\n2\n), which was done by outlining the inferred area of missing cortical tissue for each section (typically 5-7) taken at 1-mm intervals as previously reported (\nOlsen et al., 2012\n;\nMonaco et al., 2013\n,\n2014\n).\n\nStatistical analyses\nAll analyses were performed using Statview 5.0.1 software (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA) on data collected by blinded experimenters. The motor and cognitive analyses were conducted using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The acute neurological data (i.e., hind limb withdrawal reflex and righting reflex) as well as the data for the visible platform, probe trial, swim speed, and cortical lesion volume were analyzed using one-factor ANOVAs. When the overall ANOVA revealed significant effects, the Newman-Keuls post-hoc test was used to determine specific group differences. The results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (S.E.M.) and were considered significant when\np\n\u2264 0.05.\n\nResults\nThere were no exclusions and thus the statistical analyses were performed on the data from all 60 rats. No significant differences (\np\n\u2019s > 0.05) were observed in any behavioral measure between the sham controls regardless of housing condition so their data were pooled into one group designated as SHAM.\n\nAcute neurological function\nNo differences were observed among the TBI groups in hind limb withdrawal reflex after a brief paw pinch [left range = 154.4 \u00b1 2.9 sec to 177.7 \u00b1 5.6 sec,\np\n> 0.05; right range = 150.3 \u00b1 3.1 sec to 173.6 \u00b1 5.5 sec,\np\n> 0.05] or for righting reflex [range 290.4 \u00b1 11.2 sec to 333.9 \u00b1 17.8 sec,\np\n> 0.05] following the termination of anesthesia. The lack of significant differences with these acute neurological indices suggests that all groups experienced an equivalent level of injury and anesthesia.\n\nMotor function: beam-balance\nPrior to surgery, each rat was able to balance on the beam for the allotted 60 sec (\nFig. 2\n). After surgery, the repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant Group [F\n4,55\n= 16.411,\np\n< 0.0001] and Day [F\n5,275\n= 51.387,\np\n< 0.0001] differences, as well as a significant Group \u00d7 Day interaction [F\n20,275\n= 7.133,\np\n< 0.0001]. The post-hoc analysis revealed that the TBI + EE groups, regardless of duration (i.e., continuous, 6 hr, and 4 hr) performed significantly better than the TBI + STD group [\np\n< 0.05]. Moreover, the TBI + EE (continuous) and TB + EE (6 hr) performed better than the TBI + EE (4 hr) [\np\n< 0.05], but did not differ from one another [\np\n> 0.05]. Lastly, only the TBI + STD and TBI + EE (4 hr) groups were impaired relative to the SHAM controls [\np\n< 0.05].\nFig. 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nMean (\u00b1 S.E.M.) time (sec) balancing on an elevated narrow beam prior to, and after, TBI or sham injury.

After surgery, the statistical analysis revealed significant Group [F\n4,55\n= 48.453,\np\n< 0.0001] and Day [F\n5,275\n= 205.318,\np\n< 0.0001] differences, as well as a significant Group \u00d7 Day interaction [F\n20,275\n= 21.649,\np\n< 0.0001]. The post-hoc analysis revealed that the TBI + EE groups, regardless of duration of exposure (i.e., continuous, 6 hr, and 4 hr) performed significantly better than the TBI + STD group [\np\n< 0.05], with no differences among each other [\np\n> 0.05]. Additionally, all TBI groups, regardless of housing or duration of EE were impaired relative to the SHAM controls [\np\n< 0.05].\nFig. 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nMean (\u00b1 S.E.M.) time (sec) to traverse an elevated narrow beam after TBI or sham injury.

The post-hoc analysis revealed that all TBI + EE groups were able to maintain their balance on the rotarod longer despite accelerating speeds (i.e., increased rpms) vs. the TBI + STD group [\np\n< 0.05]. TBI + EE (continuous) was better than TBI + EE (4 hr) [\np\n< 0.05], but not TBI + EE (6 hr) [\np\n> 0.05].

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll procedures conformed to the guidelines mandated by the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the SRI Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nStudies with control mice\nFifty adult (18\u201320g) male C57 BL/6 mice (Charles River, Livermore, CA) were housed 3\u20134 per cage and quarantined for 2 d under a 12/12 hr light-dark cycle in a temperature and humidity-controlled room with free access to food and water. Several days later, all mice were acclimated to 2% saccharin in drinking water. They were then randomly assigned to saccharin with (n = 25) or without (n = 25) nicotine (free base; Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO), with saccharin used to mask the bitter taste of nicotine. Nicotine was started at 25 \u00b5g/ml and incrementally increased (50, 100, 200 \u00b5g/ml) over 10 d to a final concentration of 300 \u00b5g/ml, a dose that yields plasma cotinine levels of 200\u2013250 ng/ml (\nHuang et al., 2011\n;\nQuik et al., 2012\n). The mice were weighed once weekly, with no significant difference between nicotine and saccharin-treated groups.\nAfter 2 wk of saccharin/nicotine treatment, one set of mice was injected with vehicle or haloperidol (1 mg/kg intraperitoneally; Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO) twice daily (5 d per wk). Another set of mice was surgically implanted with blank pellets or pellets releasing 3 mg/kg/d haloperidol (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA) over 90 d, after which they were replaced if necessary. The pellets were inserted under isoflurane anesthesia into the subcutaneous space on the dorsal surface (\nCrowley et al., 2012\n). Mouse weights were similar between treatments.\nTo rate VCMs, each mouse was placed in a circular Plexiglas chamber devoid of bedding. For the injection group, mice were allowed to acclimate in the cylinder for 2 min, injected with haloperidol and immediately rated for the number of VCMs in a 5 min period by a blinded rater. VCMs consisted of subtle chewing movements, high frequency jaw/mouth tremors and purposeless mouth openings in the vertical plane with or without tongue protrusion (\nBlanchet et al., 2012\n;\nBordia et al., 2012\n;\nTurrone et al., 2002\n). For the pellet-treated group, mice were allowed to adapt to the cylinder for 2 min and rated. VCMs were assessed from the start of the study but only developed by 7 wk of haloperidol treatment, with the data provided for 7 wk and onwards.\n\nStudies with genetically modified mice\nHomozygous male ChAT-internal ribosome entry site-cre knockin mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (B6.129S6-Chat\ntm1(cre)Lowl\n). Heterozygous male Adora2a-Cre indirect pathway (striatopallidal, D2) specific BAC transgenic mice (KG139Gsat/Mmcd, B6.FVB(Cg) background) were obtained from MMRC and bred in-house.\nAfter acclimation, mice were bilaterally injected with cre-inducible recombinant AAV vector expressing ChR2 (AAV5.EF1a.DIO.hChR2(H134R)-eYFP.WPRE.hGH) or control vector (AAV5.EF1a.DIO.eYFP.WPRE.hGH) (\nFreeze et al., 2013\n;\nThrelfell et al., 2012\n). Virus (1 \u00b5l at 1\u20134 \u00d710\n12\nparticles/ml), obtained from the Vector Core, Univ Pennsylvania, was injected bilaterally into the striatum at: AP +0.8 mm, ML \u00b12.2 mm, DV \u22122.7 mm. Immediately after injection, the mice were implanted bilaterally with optical fibers (0.2 mm diameter) in the dorsolateral striatum (AP +0.8 mm, ML \u00b12.2 mm, DV \u22122.5 mm). Four wk after virus injection, the mice were implanted with pellets releasing haloperidol (3 mg/kg/d).\nEight wk after pellet implantation, the effect of optical illumination was determined, as described (\nBordia et al., 2016\n). ChR2 was activated using a 473 nm diode laser adjusted such that the power was 1 mW at each fiber tip. Light intensity at 0.2 mm from the tip was calculated to be 15.9 mW/mm\n2\n(corresponding to 73.2 mW/mm\n2\nat the fiber tip) (\nhttp://web.stanford.edu/group/dlab/cgi-bin/graph/chart.php\n). Optical stimulation consisted of a single pulse (2 ms to 1 s in duration) or of various burst paradigms, as described (\nCachope et al., 2012\n;\nFreeze et al., 2013\n;\nThrelfell et al., 2012\n), with a 0.5 s off stimulation period between pulses or bursts. Stimulation was for 5 min, during which time VCMs were scored. In some studies, the general nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine (1 mg/kg subcutaneously; Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO) was administered. For these experiments, each mouse was first rated without stimulation for 5 min. Mecamylamine was then injected and 30 min later the mouse was again optically stimulated and rated. The effect of mecamylamine was evaluated 30 min after injection consistent with previous work (\nBordia et al., 2010\n;\nBordia et al., 2016\n;\nDekundy et al., 2007\n).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were killed by cervical dislocation and immunohistochemistry done as described (\nBordia et al., 2016\n). The brains were quickly removed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2\u20133 day and cryopreserved in 10\u201330% sucrose for 3 days. They were sectioned (30 \u00b5m) using a cryostat (Leica). Every sixth section throughout the striatum (A1.4 to A-0.4) (total ~12 sections/mouse) was stained for ChAT, DARPP-32 or c-Fos. Free floating sections were rinsed, blocked and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with goat anti-ChAT (1:200 dilution; Millipore), rabbit anti-DARPP-32 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) or rabbit anti-c-Fos (1:600 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology). They were next incubated for 2 h at room temperature with secondary antibody (donkey anti-goat Alexa-568; dilution 1:200; Invitrogen: or goat anti-rabbit Alexa-555; dilution 1:500; Cell Signaling Technology). Sections were rinsed, mounted onto slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs), coverslipped and viewed under a Nikon fluorescence microscope (model Eclipse E400).\nTo view viral spread in striatal neurons, images were captured at 4\u00d7 magnification for e-YFP expression. For cell counting analysis, images from the dorsolateral striatum were taken at 40\u00d7 magnification. Expression of ChR2-eYFP in cholinergic interneurons was evaluated by counting all ChAT/e-YFP double positive cells. To delineate ChR2-eYFP expression in D2-MSNs, DARPP-32 and e-YFP double positive cells were obtained by merging individual signals using Adobe Photoshop software, as described (\nBordia et al., 2016\n). The proportion of ChR2-eYFP positive D2-MSNs was obtained by calculating the ratio of the number of double positive cells to the total number of DARPP-32 expressing cells in a blinded manner. c-Fos\n+\ncell counting was done at 10\u00d7 magnification, with cells designated c-Fos\n+\nwhen they exhibited a clear, intense round or oval red staining in the nucleus. Adobe Photoshop software merged images of cells expressing c-Fos/eYFP was counted manually by a blinded rater. Three striatal sections at A1.4 (range A1.5\u20131.3) mm, A0.8 (range A0.9\u20130.7) mm and A0.2 (range 0.3-0.1) mm from bregma were used for cell counting. The mean of 3 sections was averaged for each animal (n = 11=12) and considered an individual observation for statistical analyses. eYFP cell counts indicated that variability in striatal viral expression among mice averaged 24% for ChAT-Cre mice (n = 12) and 30% (n = 11) for D2-Cre mice.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical comparisons were performed with GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA) using t-tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni\npost hoc\ntest. A value of p \u2264 0.05 was considered significant. The values expressed are the mean \u00b1 SEM of the indicated number of mice."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Harlan (Houston, TX). Rats were 100\u2013120 days old and weighed 350\u2013400g at the time of surgery. Subjects were housed in pairs and maintained on a 12 hour light-dark cycle. Food and water were available\nad libitum\n. All experiments were carried out in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) standards for the care and use of laboratory animals (NIH publications No. 80-23) and were approved by the University Laboratory Animal Care Committee at Texas A&M University. Every effort was made to minimize suffering and limit the number of animals used.\n\nSurgery and intrathecal cannulization\nSubjects were anesthetized with isoflurane gas, induced at 5%, and maintained at 2\u20133%. Each subject\u2019s head was rendered immobile in a stereotaxic apparatus with a small (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2.5 cm) gauze pillow under the subject\u2019s chest to provide support for respiration. An anterior to posterior incision over the second thoracic vertebrae (T2) was made and the tissue just rostral to T2 was cleared using rongeurs until the cord was exposed and cauterized. A 25-cm polyethylene cannula (PE-10, VWR International, Bristol, CT, USA) for intrathecal (i.t.) drug administration was subsequently threaded 7.5 cm down the vertebral column, into the subarachnoid space between the dura and the white matter, and placed over the lumbar enlargement so that it laid on the dorsal surface of the spinal cord. After surgery, the wound was closed with Michel clips (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The subjects were then treated with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 0.9% saline solution (3 mL) to prevent dehydration. Following surgery, rats were placed in a temperature-controlled environment (25.5 \u00b0C) and monitored until awake. All rats were checked every six to eight hours during the 18\u201324 hr post-surgical period. During this time, hydration was maintained with supplemental injections of saline, and the rats\u2019 bladders and colons were expressed as necessary. All experimental treatments were initiated approximately 24 hrs after surgery.\n\nNoxious stimulation\nVariable intermittent leg shock was applied while spinalized rats were loosely restrained in Plexiglas tubes as previously described (\nCrown et al., 2002\n). Leg shock was delivered using a BRS/LVE (Laurel, MD) constant current (60 Hz, AC) shock generator (Model SG-903). Electrical stimulation was applied by attaching one lead from the shock generator to a 2.5 cm stainless steel pin that was inserted 0.4 cm into the tibialis anterior muscles. The other lead was inserted through the skin over the tibia, 1.5 cm from the tarsals. Rats treated with intermittent nociceptive stimulation received 900, 80-ms leg shocks on a variable time schedule with a mean inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 2 s (range 0.2 \u20133.8 s). Unshocked subjects were placed in the restraining tubes for an equal amount of time as the shocked subjects with the electrodes attached, but did not receive the electrical stimuli.\nNoxious stimulation was also induced using the irritant capsaicin. Three percent capsaicin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in 50 \u00b5L of vehicle [Tween 20 (7%) and saline (93%)] and was injected subcutaneously into the dorsal surface of the hindpaw while loosely restrained in Plexiglas tubes.\n\nDrug Administration\nBicuculline (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in 0.9% saline (0.3% in 1 \u00b5L). One hundred \u00b5g of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in 10 \u00b5L of 0.9% saline. Gabazine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in 10 \u00b5L saline. Muscimol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in 0.9% saline (0.1% in 1 \u00b5L). Twenty \u00b5g of DIOA (Santa-Cruz Biotech, Dallas, TX) was dissolved in 2 \u00b5L vehicle [DMSO (1%) and saline (99%)]. One mM of bumetanide (Santa-Cruz Biotech, Dallas, TX) was dissolved in 10 \u00b5L vehicle [Tween20 (2%) and saline (98%)]. All the drugs were administered i.t. and followed by a 20 \u00b5L saline (0.9%) flush that was slowly infused over a period of 2 min.\n\nMechanical testing\nMechanical reactivity was assessed using von Frey filaments (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) that were applied while rats were loosely restrained in Plexiglas tubes. Sensitivity was determined by stimulating the mid-plantar surface of each hindpaw by an ascending order until a flexion response is elicited. Stimuli were presented twice to each paw in an ABBA counterbalanced fashion (A = left, B = right), with testing on the same leg separated by a 2 min interval. Filament thickness/force is related to behavior using the transformation provided by the manufacturer: Intensity = log10 (10,000g). This transformation yields a scale that is approximately linear and amenable to parametric analyses. Data were converted to change from baseline scores for purposes of analysis. The experimenter performing the behavioral tests was unaware of the subject\u2019s treatment condition.\n\nRNA extraction and RT-PCR\nSubjects were deeply anesthetized with a lethal dosage of pentobarbital (50mg/kg) and 1 centimeter of spinal cord around the lumbar enlargement (L3-L5) was rapidly removed within 3 minute after confirmation of death. The spinal cord was further subdivided into dorsal and ventral portions and then processed for extracting both total RNA (RNeasy Mini Kit; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and protein (see below). Total RNA (100 ng) was converted into cDNA by TaqMan EZ RT-PCR Core reagents (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) and the mRNA levels of all targets were measured by TaqMan quantitative real-time (RT)-PCR using a StepOnePlus\u2122 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA.). The sequences of probes, forward and reverse primers for \u03b2-\nactin, c-fos\n, and\nc-jun\n, were obtained from Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA. The mRNA expression for each gene of interest was normalized to \u03b2-\nactin\nexpression, and is presented as a fold change increase or decrease in experimental groups relative to controls.\n\nProtein extraction and western blotting\nAfter RNA extraction, total protein was extracted from the organic layer, using the QIAzol\u2122 lysis reagent protocol (\nHummon et al., 2007\n) for isolation of genomic DNA and/or proteins from fatty tissue, as described in a previous report from our laboratory (\nGarraway et al., 2014\n; Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After determining the protein concentration by Bradford Assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA), protein samples were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer and were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C at known concentrations (usually 2\u20135\u00b5g/\u00b5l). Western blotting was used for the protein quantification of ERK1/2 and pERK1/2 (~ 42/44 kDa). Equal amounts (30\u00b5g) of total protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE with 12% Tris-HEPES precast gels (Pierce, Rockford, IL). After transferring onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by Bio-Rad Semi-dry transfer apparatus, the blots for ERK1/2 and other non-phosphorylated proteins (see below) were blocked for one hour in 5% blotting grade milk (BioRad, Hercules, CA) in Tris-Buffered Saline Tween-20 (TBST), while blots for pERK1/2 were blocked in 5% BSA in TBST. After blocking, the PVDF membranes were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C in one of the following primary antibodies generated in rabbit: ERK1/2 (1:2000; #06-182 - Millipore, Temecula, CA), pERK1/2 (1:500; #07-467 - Millipore, Temecula, CA). \u03b2- actin (1:2500; #Ab8227 - Abcam, Cambridge, MA) served as the control. All primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution. The following day, PVDF membranes were washed in TBST (3 \u00d7 5 min) at room temperature and incubated in HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:5,000; #31460 or 31430, respectively; Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 1 hour at room temperature. After another 3 \u00d7 5 min series of washes, the blots were incubated with ECL (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and were imaged with Fluorchem HD2 (ProteinSimple, Santa Clara, CA). The protein expression for each gene of interest was normalized to \u03b2-actin expression and presented as a fold change relative to the sham controls. Other targets of interest including KCC2, phospho-\nSer940\nKCC2, N-cadherin and NKCC1 were assessed in the same fashion.\n\nFractionation\nTo assess KCC2 (1:500; #07-432 - Millipore, Temecula, CA) and phospho-\nSer940\nKCC2 (1:1000; PhosphoSolutions, Aurora, CO, USA) expression, spinal cord specimens were homogenized with dounce homogenizer (Kontes), followed by 5 passes through a 22 gauge needle in ice-cold buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm Tris, 300 mm sucrose, and a complete mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Crude homogenates were centrifuged at 5000 RCF for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatant was further fractionated at 13,000 RCF for 30 min. After centrifugation, supernatant was collected as cytoplasmic fraction. A membrane rich fraction was then obtained by resuspending the pellet in PBS (50 \u00b5l) containing protease inhibitor. All samples were sonicated and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for later processing (Western blotting). N-cadherin (1:1000; Cell Signaling - Danvers, MA) was used to confirm plasma membrane enrichment. NKCC1 (1:500; #sc-21545 \u2013 Santa Cruz, CA) was also tested.\n\nStatistics\nAll data were analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) or an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Individual variability in mechanical reactivity was controlled for by: (1) Analyzing the test data using an ANCOVA, entering the baseline score as a covariate; and (2) Computing a change from baseline score and analyzing the data using ANOVA. Both sets of analyses yielded similar patterns of statistical significance. Differences between group means were assessed using Duncan\u2019s New Multiple Range\npost hoc\ntest as needed. In all cases, the criterion for statistical significance was p < 0.05."

Animals\nAll mice were housed in the Animal Resource Facilities at Creighton University School of Medicine in a temperature (25\u00b0C)- and humidity (50\u201360%)-controlled and pathogen-free environment. Mice were given food and water ad libitum and kept on a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Heterozygous Kcna1-null mice on a C3HeB/FeJ congenic background were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine) and bred to obtain Kv1.1 wild-type (WT) and Kv1.1 knockout (KO) littermates. Heterozygous Ppar\u03b32-null mice on a mixed 129sv-C57Bl/6 background were provided by Gema Medina-Gomez (Universidad Rey Carlos, Madrid, Spain) (\nMedina-Gomez et al., 2005\n,\n2007\n) and bred to obtain PPAR\u03b32WT, PPAR\u03b32Het and PPAR\u03b32KO littermates. Tail clips were taken at postnatal day (P)10\u2013P15 and sent to Transnetyx Inc. for genotyping (Cordova, TN, U.S.A.). Homozygous floxed Ppar\u03b3\nfl/fl\nand homozygous neuronal-specific synapsin I-Cre\n+\nPpar\u03b3\nfl/lf\nknockout (Ppar\u03b3\nfl/fl\n-NKO; Cre expression driven by synapsin I) mice were provided by J.M. Olefsky (University of California-San Diego) and M.W. Schwartz (University of Washington) and bred to provide control Ppar\u03b3\nfl/fl\nmice and Ppar\u03b3\nfl/fl\n-NKO mice (\nLu et al., 2011\n). All procedures involving animals were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines, the EU Directive 2010/63/EU and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Creighton University School of Medicine.\n\n2.2. Dietary and pharmacological treatments\nOn P21, mice were randomly weaned onto either a standard diet (SD) or a KD (6.3:1, fat to carbohydrates plus proteins; Bio-Serv F3666, Frenchtown, NJ, U.S.A.) for 10\u201314 days. For dietary experiments involving singly housed Kv1.1WT and Kv1.1KO mice, drinking water contained either 0.0323% DMSO vehicle or the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist GW9662 (2.68 mg/ml) to obtain an average dosage of 1.062\u00b10.038 mg/kg/day (n=18) (\nIwanami et al., 2010\n;\nMin et al., 2012\n). There was no difference in the average daily water consumption or resulting GW9662 dosage between experimental groups (\nFig. 1\n). For experiments involving pioglitazone, on P32\u201333 Kv1.1KO mice were intraperitoneal-injected with saline vehicle for two days, followed by five days of daily pioglitazone injections (10 mg/kg/day, i.p., at 9:00AM) (\nAbdallah, 2010\n).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\n(\na\n) Water consumption during dietary treatments and administration of either vehicle or the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist GW9662 in drinking water. (\nb\n) Calculated daily dosage of GW9662. Neither genotype nor treatment had a significant effect on water consumption (not shown) or resulting GW9662 dosage (n = 4\u20136 mice). Wild-type, WT; knockout, KO; ketogenic diet, KD; standard diet, SD.\n\n2.3. Blood \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate and glucose measurements\n\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate and glucose levels were measured every three days from blood samples collected from the tail vein of each mouse using a test strip system and reader (Precision Xtra Advance Diabetes Management System with Precision Xtra blood ketone test strips and blood glucose test strips; Abbott Diabetes Care Inc., Alameda, CA, U.S.A.).\n\n2.4. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) electrode implantation and seizure analysis\nOn ~P27, mice underwent surgical implantation of electrodes. Mice were maintained under isoflurane anesthesia and normothermic conditions. One ground (1.5mm anterior lamba, 1.5mm lateral) and two subdural (1mm posterior Bregma, 1.5mm bilateral) iEEG electrodes were implanted, secured and attached to a headmount. Following a 5\u20136 day recovery, seizures were monitored for forty-eight hours using a continuous infrared video surveillance system time-synced to an EEG recording system (Pinnacle Technology, Inc., Lawrence, KS, U.S.A) as we have described (\nRoundtree et al., 2016\n;\nSimeone et al., 2014a\n;\nFenoglio-Simeone et al., 2009a\n,\nb\n). EEG recordings were acquired with a 250 Hz sampling rate and band-pass filtered between 0.5 and 40 Hz. During seizure monitoring, mice were single-housed in hexagon cages. EEG recordings were imported into Spike2 v6\u20137 software (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, England. U.K.) for initial seizure identification using time-frequency analysis. Subsequently, EEG seizures were confirmed using Sirenia software (Pinnacle Technology, Inc.) that time-synced EEG and video recordings and behavioral manifestations were manually verified by 2 blinded investigators. Incidence and severity of each seizure was scored for the first 15 min of each hour during the time period of highest seizure occurrence for Kv1.1KO mice (00:00\u201308:00) (\nSimeone et al., 2014a\n;\nFenoglio-Simeone et al., 2009b\n). Seizure severity was scored using a modified Racine scale: 0-normal; 1-myoclonic jerk; 2-side-to-side head movement; 3-forelimb/hindlimb clonus, tail extension, a single rearing event; 4-continuous rearing and falling; 5-severe tonic-clonic seizures. To weigh the incidence and severity of seizures, seizure burden index (SBI) scores were calculated using the equation: SBI = [\u03a3(\u03c3\ni\n\u03b3\ni\n)]/\u03b5, where \u03c3 indicates the severity; i indicates each stage of seizure (1\u20135); \u03b3 is the frequency; and \u03b5 indicates the total number of epochs scored as we have described (\nSimeone et al., 2014a\n;\nRoundtree et al., 2016\n;\nSimeone et al., 2016\n).\n\n2.5. Immunofluorescent western blot\nPPAR\u03b3 is a type II nuclear receptor. As such, it is primarily located in the nucleus regardless of the presence or absence of ligand. Therefore, we determined relative PPAR\u03b3 protein levels in nuclear extracts. Nuclei were isolated from whole brain homogenate using a nuclear extraction kit according to manufacturer instructions (AY2002; Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A.). Nuclear extracts were mixed with Laemmli\u2019s loading buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, U.S.A.) containing beta-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO, U.S.A.), heated to 99\u00b0C and run through precast PAGE gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-FL PVDF membranes (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, U.S.A.), which were then blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer (OBB; Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, U.S.A.) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at a 1:1 ratio for one hour at room temperature (RT). Membranes were incubated with the following primaries overnight at 4\u00b0C: rabbit anti-PPAR\u03b3 (1:400, 07\u2013466, EMD Millipore, was used for\nFig. 3\nand\nFig. 6\n; 1:1000, ABN1445, EMD Millipore, was used for\nFig. 5\n; both antibodies recognize PPAR\u03b31 at 52 kDa and PPAR\u03b32 at 56 kDa) and mouse anti-\u03b2-actin (1:8,000; 926\u201342212, Li-Cor Biosciences). After PBS-T washes membranes were incubated in secondary antibodies for one hour at RT: goat anti-rabbit (1:5,000; 926\u201332221, Li-Cor Biosciences) and goat anti-mouse (1:20,000\u20131:40,000; 926\u201332210, Li-Cor Biosciences). Membranes were washed in PBS-T and rinsed in distilled water. Samples were run in duplicate on each gel. Densitometric analysis was conducted using images captured on an Odyssey FC (Licor, Lincoln, NE) and PPAR\u03b3 protein signal was normalized to within well \u03b2-actin values. Averages of the duplicates were determined and values normalized to the WT-SD values within each gel.\nFigure 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nKetogenic Diet (KD) treatment increases nuclear content of PPAR\u03b32 in brain tissue. Wild-type (WT) and Kv1.1KO mice were weaned onto both a standard diet (SD) or KD for 10-4 days and the drinking water contained either vehicle or the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist GW9662.

Mice (P35) were administered pioglitazone (PIO; 10 mg/kg/day, i.p., at 9:00AM) daily for six days.

Immunoflourescent histochemistry\nMice were quickly anesthetized with isoflurane, decapitated, brains were removed and frozen in methyl-butane on dry ice. Sections affixed to slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PB (pH 7.4), washed with 0.01 M PBS/0.3% Triton X-100, pH 7.4 (PBS-T) and blocked with 10% normal goat serum/PBS-T. Sections were incubated with rabbit anti-PPAR\u03b3 (1:400, 07\u2013466, EMD Millipore) overnight at room temperature followed by AF-594 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:600, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, U.S.A.) for 3 h at room temperature after which sections were immediately cover-slipped with mounting media containing DAPI.

    "Methods": "2.1. SH-SY5Y cell cultures\nThe human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y (ATCC, Manassas, VA) (Lai et al, 2006; (\nPark et al., 2012\n) was grown in DMEM/F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. For SH-SY5Y cell differentiation, cells were grown in fresh medium containing 10 \u03bcM all-trans retinoic acid for 5 days. Recombinant OSM (10 ng/ml; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN) was added to cells for the times indicated in the individual figure. Protein lysates were prepared and subjected to subcellular fractionation, followed by immunoblot analyses.\n\n2.2. SOCS3 overexpression or knockdown by Lentiviral vector production and infection\nTo overexpress SOCS3, the human SOCS3 open reading frame was cloned into the Lentiviral vector pLVX-IRES-ZsGreen (pLVX; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) to generate SOCS3/pLVX-IRES-ZsGreen (SOCS3/pLVX) (\nPark et al., 2012\n). To knock down SOCS3 expression, a Lentiviral plasmid pGipz, encoding shRNA specific for SOCS3 (shSOCS3/pGipz), was purchased from Open Biosystems (Lafayette, CO). Lentiviral particles were generated by calcium phosphate-mediated co-transfection of HEK-293T cells with pLVX, SOCS3/pLVX, pGipz, or shSOCS3/pGipz, together with psPAX2 (packaging plasmid) and pMD2G (envelope plasmid). Virus was collected after 72 h and titers up to 3\u20134\u00d710\n7\ninfectious units/ml were obtained (\nPark et al., 2014\n;\nPark et al., 2015\n). SH-SY5Y cells were infected with Lentivirus delivering pLVX, SOCS3/pLVX, pGipz, or shSOCS3/pGipz, sorted by FACS analysis using green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C (\nPark et al., 2012\n).\n\n2.3. Animals\nAdult female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (220\u2013250 g; Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI) were divided randomly into two groups: (1) sham control group (CON; laminectomy only; n = 12) or (2) T8 spinal cord transection (Tx) group (n = 18). Rats were housed in standard laboratory cages with a 12:12 hour light/dark cycle with standard rodent chow and water available\nad libitum\n. All experiments were performed during the light cycle. All animal procedures were approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n\n2.4. Spinal cord injury\nAll surgical procedures were conducted under aseptic conditions. Before surgery, all animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane gas mixed with oxygen. Rats were maintained on a heating pad and rectal temperature was monitored and maintained at 36.5\u00b11.5\u00b0C during surgery. Animals in the CON group underwent a laminectomy only (T8 level). In the Tx group, a laminectomy was followed by complete transverse cuts of the spinal cord at the T8 level, resulting in a gap of ~2\u20133 mm. A surgical microscope was used to ensure the complete removal of neural tissue, including fiber bundles. Muscle and skin layers were closed with 2\u20130 sutures. The bladders of all spinal cord-transected rats were expressed manually twice per day throughout the experimental period (\nPark et al., 2014\n;\nPark et al., 2015\n).\n\n2.5. Isolation of mitochondria and cytosol\nSubcellular fractionation of mitochondria and cytosol from cultured SH-SY5Y cells was accomplished using a mitochondrial isolation kit (Thermo scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Briefly, SH-SY5Y cells at the indicated time points after treatment were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested. The cultured cells were centrifuged and mitochondria were extracted from the cell suspensions. The resulting supernatants and pellets were designated as the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, respectively. Equal amounts of protein (30 \u03bcg) were mixed with loading buffer (0.125 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% mercaptoethanol, and 0.002% bromophenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE. For\nin vivo\nstudies, spinal cord tissues were harvested from regions 5 mm rostral or caudal to the epicenter at the indicated time points after complete SCI and then subjected to subcellular fractionation of mitochondria and cytosol according to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines.\n\n2.6. Immunoblotting\nCultures treated with OSM were lysed in buffer containing the following: 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n(pH 7.2), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, and protease inhibitor mixture. Forty \u03bcg of total cell lysate was separated by electrophoresis on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted with antibodies against P-STAT3 Tyr, P-STAT3 Ser, total STAT3, \u03b2-actin (Cell Signaling Technology; Beverly, MA), GAPDH, and ATP5A (Abcam; Cambridge, MA) (\nPark et al., 2014\n;\nPark et al., 2015\n;\nPark et al., 2012\n). Immunoreactivity was assessed using Pierce ECL\u00ae or SuperSignal\u00ae West Dura substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). For quantitative analyses, the densities of bands on immunoblots were measured with ImageJ software. For\nin vivo\nstudies, spinal cord tissues were obtained from areas 5 mm rostral or caudal to the injury at the designated time point after SCI. The tissues were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer and equal amounts of protein (40 \u03bcg) were separated by SDS-PAGE. The blots were then incubated with antibodies and developed as described previously (\nPark et al., 2014\n;\nPark et al., 2015\n).\n\n2.7. Immunostaining of spinal cord tissue\nAnimals were anesthetized at time points indicated for individual experiments after SCI or sham procedures and then transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Spinal cords were removed, post-fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C in 4% paraformaldehyde, and stored at 4\u00b0C in 30% sucrose solution until sinking. The spinal cord segments 5 mm rostral or caudal to the injured site were then transversely sectioned on a cryostat (30 \u03bcm) and collected for immunohistochemistry (\nPark et al., 2014\n;\nPark et al., 2015\n). Briefly, free-floating serial sections were washed three times for 10 min with PBS and blocked with PBS containing 3% normal horse serum and 0.25% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then incubated overnight with gentle agitation at room temperature with PBS containing 0.5% BSA in the following antibody combinations: (1) P-STAT3 Ser (1:1000) and neuronal-specific nuclear protein NeuN (1:5000; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) for neurons, (2) P-STAT3 Ser and ED1 (1:1000; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) for macrophages/microglia, and (3) P-STAT3 Ser and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for astrocytes (1:4000; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Sections were then washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a secondary antibody conjugated by Alexa Flour 488 or 594 as appropriate (1:2,000; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Tissues were then washed and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratory, Burlingame, CA). Sections were examined and all images were taken using a fluorescent microscope (DM6000; Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL).\n\n2.8. Statistical analysis\nAll experiments were performed utilizing three different passages of SH-SY5Y cells or tissues from individual animals, and repeated at least three times separately. All values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical significance (p<0.05 for all analyses) was assessed by ANOVAs using GraphPad Prism 5.01 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), followed by Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls analyses."

    "Methods": "Pioneers in systems neuroscience have made remarkable advancements towards understanding the functional role of brain regions in perception, cognition, and behavior. These advances were enabled by many neurotechnologies for recording electrical and chemical activity within the brain. In particular, since the pioneering work ofHubel and Wiesel (1962)in visual cortex, extracellular electrode recordings of individual neuron\u2019s spiking activity have enabled many seminal discoveries in domains such as the sensory and motor systems, decision-making, attention, object recognition, color processing, and many others. While single neural responses are informative, in the past decade a growing appreciation for the role of neuronal populations and of population dynamics has emerged. Studying neural populations generally necessitates the ability to record from many individual neurons simultaneously; consequently researchers have employed multiple electrodes and multi-electrode arrays to study the spiking activity of up to hundreds of individual neurons simultaneously. Using these recordings, the field has made considerable progress in relating multi-electrode spiking responses to behavior on a single trial basis. For example, in the primate motor system, a monkey\u2019s reach reaction time can be predicted from the population-level dynamical state prior to movement (Afshar et al. 2011). Similar advances combining optical imaging with dynamical analysis have been used to dissect single trial neural population activity during decision-related processing in the leech (Briggman, Abarbanel, and Kristan 2005;Briggman and Kristan Jr 2008) and to relate sequential activation of neurons in the parietal cortex in rodents to specific choices during navigation decision tasks (Harvey, Coen, and Tank 2012).\n\nThese studies help us to unravel how the dynamics of a population of neurons drives behaviors, but it remains very difficult to connect dynamical system models to circuit knowledge at a lower level of abstraction. We believe this difficulty fundamentally stems from the information about neural populations not captured by extracellular electrophysiology. State of the art electrode arrays used in primates sample neurons sparsely, recording one or several neurons from a local population of many thousands (Robinson 1968). The sampling is also biased towards highly active cells (Barth and Poulet 2012) and provide very little information about cell identity. While some studies have used spiking waveform shape to distinguish excitatory and inhibitory neurons (Barth\u00f3 et al. 2004;Kaufman et al. 2010;Kaufman, Churchland, and Shenoy 2013), it is difficult to validate the accuracy of this approach, and it is infeasible to resolve more finely the diverse excitatory and inhibitory neuron types present in cortex (Markram et al. 2004). While it is possible to record spiking activity across multiple cortical areas, it is not currently possible to dissect how axonal projections from one brain region shape the local dynamics in another by observing spiking activity alone. Consequently most efforts to understand circuit function can only regard the many anatomically-observed inputs as alatentunknown rather than a directly observable entity.\n\nCollectively, these limitations of electrophysiology have highlighted the need to study neural circuit function and structure with a more powerful and informative technologies for neural circuit interrogation. Technological innovation has risen to meet this need, making it now possible to optically record activity from fluorescently labeled neurons and neural projections. Genetically encoded calcium indicators (e.g., GCaMP6) allow calcium concentration (related to action potentials) from thousands to tens of thousands of individual neurons to all be optically imaged simultaneously (Ahrens et al. 2012 e.g.). When combined with optogenetics (Yizhar et al. 2011) and optical clearing techniques such as CLARITY (Chung et al. 2013), these optical tools can provide understanding bridging the gap between neural circuit structure and function.\n\nExtending imaging techniques to monkeys presents the possibility of fundamentally transforming our understanding of the primate brain. Imaging methods provide several key advantages over electrophysiology. First, imaging provides single-cell spatial resolution over a large field of view, which could significantly increase the total number of recorded neurons. It is likely that it will be possible to record from the majority of neurons located within the microscope\u2019s focal volume, currently hundreds or thousands of neurons simultaneously. Third, whereas electrophysiology is typically biased towards larger, highly active neurons, optical imaging may more faithfully record activity in more quiescent cells (Dombeck et al. 2007), which comprise the majority of cortical circuitry (Barth and Poulet 2012). Fourth, imaging could potentially identify and record from the same neurons across multiple days (Tian et al. 2009;Huber, Gutnisky, and Peron 2012), which is currently extremely difficult to certify, if even possible, using electrodes (Tolias et al. 2007). These advances in turn enable entire new classes of experiments to address previously unaddressable questions in the primate. Fifth, optical imaging allows recorded neurons to be fluorescently labeled in other color channels with markers to distinguish cell types or identify projection targets. As imaging preserves the spatial onfiguration of recorded cells, we anticipate that it will eventually be possible to identify single neurons in calcium imaging data and later to register these to fine-resolution neuron-scale 3D reconstructions built using CLARITY (Chung et al. 2013;Tomer et al. 2015;Lerner, Ye, and Deisseroth 2016). Finally, it should be possible to exploit cell-type specific, virally transduced labels to selectively excite or inhibit cells using optogenetic stimulation while simultaneously optically recording activity (Grosenick, Marshel, and Deisseroth 2015;Rickgauer, Deisseroth, and Tank 2014).\n\nApproaches integrating these tools have heretofore focused on simple organisms such as worms, flies, and rodents, which are all amenable to short development timescales and rapid iteration (Deisseroth and Schnitzer 2013;Peron, Chen, and Svoboda 2015). Despite the large array of tools and techniques available for rodents, there are two primary motivations we highlight here for applying optical tools using nonhuman primates (Anderson 2008). First, many neural circuits, including the motor system, are finely adapted to the specific requirements of each species. As such, it is unlikely that studying the motor system of simpler organisms like rodents will yield a mechanistic understanding of the principles underlying human motor control. Primates, however, are a close biomechanical analog of the human motor system. A monkey\u2019s motor cortex must perform very similar computations as a human\u2019s, and many aspects of anatomy and function are consequently well conserved. Second, primates exhibit a high degree of cognitive flexibility and are capable of learning a rich repertoire of sophisticated, precision behaviors. In the context of motor control, this enables us to map precisely the relationship between neural activity and precisely controlled movements. While it is possible to train rodents to reach and manipulate an object (e.g.Allred et al. 2008), it is likely that the relatively simpler rodent motor system would not support complex reaches (e.g. to multiple target locations, or avoiding obstacles in their path) or more dexterous manipulation tasks which require precise control of the digits.\n\nWe now enumerate a list of key opportunities opened to the field of primate neuroscience by adopting optical methods. We focus here on the domain of motor control with application to brain-machine interface design for the sake of concreteness, but we expect that imaging will present similar opportunities in other branches of systems and translational neuroscience."

    "Methods": "Animals\nData were collected from 2.5\u20133.5 month old male rats (n=50) from Harlan (colony 217; n=22; HSD) and Charles River (colony P09; n=28; CRSD) Sprague Dawley rat substrains. Animals were housed 2 per cage with 12 hr light/dark cycles and food and water ad libitum. All procedures and experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\nSurgical Procedures\nAll rats underwent similar anesthesia and surgical preparation as described by\nBaertsch and Baker-Herman (2013\n,\n2015)\n. Briefly, isoflurane anesthesia was induced in a closed container and then continued via a nose cone with 2.5\u20133.5% isoflurane (50% O\n2\n, N\n2\nbalance) flowing from a vaporizer. A custom heated surgery table was used to maintain body temperature near 37.0\u00b0C, which was measured via a rectal thermometer (physitemp, model 700 1H). The tail vein was catheterized for delivery of fluids (1\u20133 ml/hr; lactated Ringers solution, 0\u201320% sodium bicarbonate as necessary) to maintain blood pressure and pH throughout experimental protocols. A tracheostomy was performed to enable mechanical ventilation (Harvard Apparatus, Model 683; ~70 br/min, TV: 1 ml/100 g body weight; 50% O\n2\n, N\n2\nbalance). To prevent entrainment of respiratory neural activity with the ventilator, the vagus nerves were cut bilaterally at the cervical level. End-tidal CO\n2\n(ETCO\n2\n) was measured continuously from the expired line immediately adjacent to the bifurcation of the ventilator circuit as an index of arterial pCO\n2\nwith a flow-through capnograph (Capnogard, Respironics). Tracheal pressure was monitored and the fraction of inspired CO\n2\nwas adjusted to ensure that respiratory efforts were present throughout the surgery and to prevent unintended neural apnea. A catheter was placed in the femoral artery to monitor blood pressure and draw blood samples (~0.3 ml) for pH and blood-gas analysis (ABL800; Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). Rats were transferred to urethane anesthesia (1 ml/100 g of 0.175 g/ml urethane infused at 6 ml/hr\ni.v.\n) and isoflurane was gradually withdrawn. Pressor responses to toe-pinch and/or corneal reflex were tested to assess depth of anesthesia, and supplemental urethane was administered\ni.v.\nif a response was observed. The left phrenic nerve was isolated, cut distally, de-sheathed, submerged in mineral oil, and placed on bipolar silver electrodes for electrophysiological recording. Once respiratory neural output could be monitored to ensure continued respiratory effort, pancuronium bromide was infused (1 mg/kg,\ni.v.\n) to induce neuromuscular paralysis.\n\nExperimental Protocols\nHSD and CRSD rats underwent the same experimental protocols. Rats were slightly hyperventilated to enable rapid induction of a neural apnea without changing ventilator settings (see below), so a small amount of inspired CO\n2\nwas added to the inspired gas mixture to obtain an ETCO\n2\nof ~45 mmHg (\nBaertsch and Baker-Herman, 2015\n). 15\u201320 min of \u201cbaseline\u201d phrenic nerve burst amplitude and frequency was established at least one hour following transfer to urethane anesthesia to allow sufficient washout of isoflurane. An arterial blood sample was drawn to obtain baseline pCO\n2\n, pO\n2\n, and pH measurements (temperature corrected). Neural apnea was then induced in one of three different patterns: five brief intermittent neural apneas (~1.25 min each, separated by 5 min), a single brief massed neural apnea of an equal cumulative duration (~6.25 min), or a single prolonged neural apnea (30 min). To induce neural apnea, the fraction of CO\n2\nin the inspired gas mixture was reduced by clamping the CO\n2\nline upstream of the rotameter and ventilator. The ETCO\n2\nat the point where all rhythmic phrenic activity ceased was noted and designated as the apneic threshold (AT) for phrenic inspiratory activity. In rats receiving brief intermittent neural apnea, the flow of CO\n2\nwas then immediately restored by removing the clamp, and the ETCO\n2\nat which respiratory neural activity resumed was noted and designated as the recruitment threshold (RT) for phrenic inspiratory activity. In rats exposed to brief massed or prolonged neural apnea, neural apnea was induced as stated above; however, once apneic, the flow of CO\n2\nwas only moderately increased to maintain ETCO\n2\n~2 mmHg below the AT for the duration of the apnea. Since neural apneas were elicited by manipulating the fraction of inspired CO\n2\n, lung volume and breathing frequency remained consistent during experimental protocols. In all rats, PaO\n2\nwas maintained with the ventilator during neural apnea, and baseline ETCO\n2\nwas restored following the neural apnea. Arterial blood was drawn at 5, 15, 30, and 60 min time-points following neural apnea to confirm PaCO\n2\nwas maintained within 1.5 mmHg of baseline. At the end of each protocol another brief (~1.25 min) neural apnea was induced using the same method to identify any persistent effects of our treatments on the AT and RT.\n\nData Analysis\nETCO\n2\nwas digitized and analyzed using PowerLab (AD Instruments; Lab Chart 7.0 software). ETCO\n2\nvalues were obtained at the onset of each neural apnea and at resumption of respiratory neural activity, indicating the AT and RT, respectively. Because we have previously demonstrated that HSD and CRSD rat substrains have similar responses to both intermittent and brief massed neural apnea (\nBaertsch and Baker-Herman, 2013\n,\n2015\n), data from both substrains was pooled for these groups. When these substrains were analyzed independently, similar results following intermittent and brief massed neural apnea were obtained (data not shown). In rats exposed to brief intermittent neural apnea, changes in the AT and RT over the course of five consecutive neural apneas were calculated as an absolute change from the initial AT and RT. Progressive changes in the AT and RT during brief intermittent neural apnea were analyzed using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test (Prism 6, Graph Pad software). In all protocols, differences between the AT of the first neural apnea and the AT of the neural apnea at the end of each protocol (60 min post-neural apnea) were calculated using \u201cnormalized\u201d ETCO\n2\nmeasurements since direct measurements of PaCO\n2\n(not ETCO\n2\n) were used to maintain isocapnia during electrophysiological protocols. Therefore, to account for occasional small changes in ventilation/perfusion efficiency (resulting in changes in ETCO\n2\nrelative to PaCO\n2\n) that can occur over time in these in vivo preparations, the AT ETCO\n2\nvalues during the first apnea were subtracted from the ETCO\n2\nat baseline, and the AT values during the neural apnea 60 min post treatment were subtracted from the ETCO\n2\nimmediately prior to the 60 min blood sample. The resulting values were then compared to determine the change in the AT and RT (see\nFigure 3E\n). Statistical differences between treatment groups were determined using one-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test (Prism 6, Graph Pad software); data are shown as mean \u00b1 SE. To examine changes in phrenic amplitude, nerve burst activity was amplified (X10k), band-pass filtered (0.3\u201310 kHz; AM Systems), integrated (time constant 50 ms), and rectified. The resulting signal was digitized and peak nerve burst amplitude was analyzed in 60-breath bins taken at baseline and 60 min post-neural apnea using PowerLab (AD Instruments; Lab Chart 7.0 software). Changes in phrenic amplitude at 60 min were expressed as a percent change from baseline (% baseline). Linear regression analysis was used to compare changes in the RT and AT to the magnitude of iPMF expressed following neural apnea. A significance level of p<0.05 was used for all comparisons.\nFigure 3.\nOpen in a new tab\niPMF is associated with a persistent and proportional decrease in the apneic threshold.\nA\u2013D\n.

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nWe used a total of 50 Sprague-Dawley rats of either sex, aged from postnatal day zero (P0) through postnatal day four (P4). This neonatal period corresponds to a gestational age of 29\u201334 weeks in humans (\nBallanyi et al., 1999\n). The nicotine-exposed neonates were taken from 19 separate litters; the saline-exposed neonates from 15 different litters; and the unexposed from 3 litters. From each litter, 1\u20133 neonates were used. All neonates were born via spontaneous vaginal delivery from pregnant adult female rats purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Neonatal rat pups were housed together with their mothers and siblings until they were studied. Dams were housed in the Animal Care Facility at the University of Arizona under a 12: 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on 07:00 h) with water and food available\nad libitum\n, in a quiet room at 22\u00b0C and 20\u201330% relative humidity. All protocols were approved by the University of Arizona Institutional Care and Use Committee and conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines.\n\n2.2. Developmental nicotine exposure\nDNE was achieved by subcutaneous implantation of Alzet 1007D mini-osmotic pumps (Alzet Corp., CA, USA) into pregnant dams on gestational day 5 under aseptic conditions, as previously described (\nFregosi et al., 2004\n;\nHuang et al., 2004\n;\nLuo et al., 2007\n). The pumps allow for fluid infusion into subcutaneous space at a rate of 2.5 \u03bcL h\n\u22121\nfor 28 days. This infusion rate achieves mean nicotine bitartrate delivery of 6 mg kg\n\u22121\nday\n\u22121\nthroughout gestation. We previously showed that this regimen produces plasma levels of cotinine, a major metabolite of nicotine with a long half-life (20\u201324 h), ranging from 60\u201392 ng/mL (\nPowell et al., 2015\n). This is comparable to average cotinine levels (88 ng/mL) found in the umbilical cord blood of newborns whose mothers smoked on average 95 cigarettes/week (\nBerlin et al., 2010\n).\n\n2.3. Medullary slice preparation\nPups of either sex were removed from their home cages at random and weighed. Animals were anesthetized by hypothermia until unresponsive to a paw pinch, and decerebrated at the coronal suture. The vertebral column and ribcage were exposed, moved to a dissection dish filled with cold (4\u20138\u00b0C) oxygenated (95% O\n2\n-5% CO\n2\n) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), composed of (in mM): 120 NaCl, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 30 glucose, 1 MgSO\n4\n, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, and 1.2 CaCl\n2\nwith pH adjusted to 7.4 and osmolarity adjusted to 300\u2013325 mOsm. The spinal cord and brainstem were glued to an agar block with superglue, rostral surface up, for serial microsectioning in a vibratome (VT1000; Leica). Transverse medullary slices were taken in chilled oxygenated aCSF until the most rostral hypoglossal nerve (XIIn) rootlets were near the surface of the tissue. A single 700-\u03bcm slice was taken to capture the majority of hypoglossal motor nucleus and the preBotzinger complex, which can drive rhythmic respiration-related bursting in the medullary slice. The slice was then transferred to fresh aCSF that was continuously oxygenated with 95%O\n2\n-5%CO\n2\nand allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 1\u20132 hours before recording. Slices were then transferred to the recording chamber and perfused with oxygenated aCSF. To evoke rhythmic bursting of XIIMNs, the KCl of the perfusate was raised to 9 mM. We used rhythmic slices because we are interested in motoneurons that play a role in breathing. High potassium is commonly used to evoke rhythmic bursting in brainstem slices, though we realize that some motoneurons that were rhythmic in high potassium may have not been rhythmic when exposed to physiological levels of extracellular potassium, though the rhythmic slice does mimic conditions of high respiratory drive.\n\n2.4. Electrophysiology\nXIIMNs were visualized with an Olympus BX-50WI fixed-stage microscope (X40 water-immersion objective, 0.75 N.A.) with infrared and differential contrast optics and a video camera (C25400-07, Hamamatsu). XIIMNs were approached with a glass pipette (4\u20138 M\u03a9) pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass capillary tubes (OD: 1.5 mm, ID: 0.75 mm) and filled with intracellular solution which contained (in mM): 135 K-gluconate, 4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 5 ATP (Mg\n2+\nsalt), 0.375 GTP, and 12.5 phosphocreatine, with pH adjusted to 7.2 and osmolarity of 275\u2013300 mOsm. The electrophysiology equipment consisted of Digidata 1440 and Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices).\n\n2.5. Drugs\nMost drugs were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Tetrodotoxin was purchased from R&D (Minneapolis, MN, USA). The drugs were mixed on the day of the experiment in modified aCSF (9 mM KCl) with the following concentrations: tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 \u03bcM), \u03b1amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA, 2.5 \u03bcM), 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 20 \u03bcM), and L-glutamic acid monosodium salt hydrate (glutamate, 200 \u03bcM). The drug solutions were oxygenated and were delivered to the recording chamber at a rate of 1.5\u20132 ml/min, with the temperature controlled at 27\u00b0C (TC-324B temperature controller, Warner Instrument Corporation). A summary of drug concentrations and durations of application is provided in\nTable 1\n.\nTable 1.\nConcentration and duration of drug application used in the experiments outlined in\nFigure 2\n. All drugs were dissolved in oxygenated (95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n) aCSF (KCl 9mM), and were bath-applied at 27\u00b0C.\nDrug(s) Applied\nConcentration\nDuration (min)\nTTX\n1 \u03bcM\n2 min\nAMPA/TTX\n2.5 \u03bcM/1 \u03bcM\n5 min\nCNQX/AMPA/TTX\n20 \u03bcM/2.5 \u03bcM/1 \u03bcM\n5 min\nGlutamate/TTX\n200 \u03bcM/1 \u03bcM\n5 min\nCNQX/Glutamate/TTX\n20 \u03bcM/200 \u03bcM/1 \u03bcM\n5 min\nWash/TTX\n\u2212/1 \u03bcM\n5 min\nOpen in a new tab\n\n2.6. Protocols\nA total of 26 control and 24 DNE rhythmically active XIIMNs (1 cell from each animal) were studied under whole cell voltage-clamp (Vhold = \u221270 mV). The slow and fast components of the voltage transient were cancelled. The series resistance was compensated with the bandwidth set at 4 kHz and correction at 60%. A small voltage-step (from \u221270 to \u221275 mV) protocol was performed to calculate motoneuron input resistance. This was followed by 1-min recording in current-clamp mode (I hold = 0 pA, pipette offset adjusted) to check the stability of the cell and to measure the resting membrane potential. We then performed a square-pulse current-step protocol to determine the firing threshold. Current steps (800 msec duration) were initiated at 0 pA and ranged from \u2212200 pA to +350 pA in 50pA increments. Then, the cell was switched back to voltage clamp mode (Vhold = \u221270 mV), the rhythmic activity was recorded for 1 min, and TTX was bath applied for 2 min to establish a new, stable baseline. These studies were then followed by bath application of cocktails containing AMPA + TTX (N=13 control, 11 DNE) or glutamate + TTX (N=13 control, 13 DNE) for 5 min. This was followed by bath application of AMPA + TTX + CNQX, or glutamate + TTX + CNQX for 5 min, followed by a washout with TTX alone (\nFig. 2\n). Importantly, the addition of CNQX always abolished the inward current and mEPSCs, confirming that both were mediated byAMPA receptors. At the end of each experiment, the small voltage-step protocol (from \u221270 mV to \u221275 mV) was repeated to measure the input resistance and confirm that the gigaohm seal was intact.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Representative voltage-clamp (Vhold=\u221270mV) recording in a rhythmically active XIIMN demonstrating the timeline of pharmacological treatments. After documenting that the XIIMNs were bursting rhythmically, TTX was applied to block action potential-dependent synaptic transmission, followed by a cocktail of AMPA and TTX, which produced a large inward current. To antagonize the effects of AMPA, a cocktail containing CNQX, AMPA, and TTX was applied, followed by washout in TTX alone. (B) Same as in A, except AMPA was replaced with glutamate in this cell. All drugs were bath-applied. A zoomed-in view of spontaneous respiratory-related bursting is shown in A, while a close up view of mEPSCs recorded after TTX are shown in B. (C) Zoomed-in view of the mEPSCs recorded after TTX application. For concentrations and durations of drug applications, see\nTable 1\n.\n\n2.7. Data analysis and Statistics\nAnalysis of the voltage- and current-clamp data obtained in Clampex (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was performed in Clampfit (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and with custom scripts written in Spike2 (CED, Cambridge, UK). The analysis of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents was done using MiniAnalysis 6.0.7 (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA). The quantitative data were statistically analyzed using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA) and SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY). Unpaired t-tests were used to compare treatment groups for the following variables: input resistance, resting membrane potential, weight, age, holding current, the peak and total (area under the curve) inward current produced with drug application, and the time needed to reach 1/2-peak amplitude. We also measured the inward current produced at 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% of the total drug application time, and. analyzed these data with 2-way repeated measures ANOVA, with treatment (control, DNE) and the % drug application time the main factors.\nAverage mEPSC amplitude and frequency at baseline and during application of AMPA or glutamate were compared between the treatment groups using 2-way ANOVA. To examine changes in the entire population of mEPSCs under each condition (baseline, drug) and treatment (control, DNE), we constructed cumulative frequency distribution plots, and fit the data with a Gaussian distribution model using Prism software. We expressed the cumulative frequency as fractions ranging from 0\u20131, such that a value of 0.5 defines the midpoint of the normalized mEPSC amplitude or frequency distribution (see\nFig. 6\n). Statistical comparisons were made by comparing the means and standard deviations of the non-linear, Gaussian distributions. For all analyses, data were considered statistically significant if P \u2264 0.05. Data in all figures and tables are represented as Means \u00b1 SEM, unless stated otherwise.\nFigure 6.\nOpen in a new tab\nCumulative probability distribution of mEPSC amplitudes (top panel) and interevent intervals (bottom panel) recorded in the first minute of AMPA bath application in 11 control and 12 DNE cells. The probability distributions were constructed on the pooled data, using every mEPSC that was analyzed (control, 165 total mEPSCs; DNE, 150 total mEPSCs). As indicated in Results, CNQX resulted in the cessation of the mEPSCs confirming that they are glutamatergic. The amplitude distribution in cells from DNE animals was shifted to the right indicating an overall increase in the amplitude of mEPSCs, and this difference was statistically significant (P = 0.0004). The interevent interval distribution in cells from DNE animals was shifted slightly to the left, but the probability distributions from control and DNE cells were not significantly different."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThe studies described have been reviewed and approved by The Scripps Research Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. C57BL/6J mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the closed breeding colony of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI).\n\nChronic Mild Hypoxia Model\nC57BL/6J male mice, 8\u201310 weeks of age, were housed 4 to a cage, and placed into a hypoxic chamber (Biospherix, Redfield, NY) for periods up to 4 days maintained at 8% O\n2\n. Control mice were kept in the same room under similar conditions except that they were kept at ambient oxygen levels (normoxia) for the duration of the experiment. Every few days, the chamber was briefly opened for cage cleaning and food and water replacement as needed.\n\nProtein C reagents\nMouse recombinant activated protein C was produced and purified according to (\nFernandez et al., 2005\n). Rat monoclonal antibody against mouse APC (SPC-54) was purified and characterized according to (\nBurnier et al., 2013\n). For some control experiments, the anti-APC antibody was boiled for 10 min, centrifuged at 2,000 rpm and the supernatant collected was used for infusion.\n\nAdministration of anti-APC blocking antibody and recombinant APC\nTo investigate the impact of APC inhibition, 8\u201310 week old C57BL/6J male mice were anesthetized with inhalational 2% isoflurane in oxygen before receiving either a retro-orbital injection of 10 mg/kg of the function-blocking anti-APC rat monoclonal antibody SPC-54 (\nBurnier et al., 2013\n) (re-suspended in PBS pH 7.4 buffer, 100\u03bcL) or the same amount of heat-denatured antibody (as controls). 30 minutes following administration of the anti-APC antibody, mice were placed under hypoxic or normoxic conditions. To investigate the impact of exogenous APC, mice received intraperitoneal injections of either mouse recombinant APC (0.8 mg/kg re-suspended in PBS pH 7.4 buffer, 100\u03bcL) or PBS vehicle (controls) one hour before hypoxic exposure and continued every 12 hours for the duration of the experiment, up to a maximum of 4 days.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and antibodies\nImmunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (\nMilner and Campbell, 2002\n) on 10 \u03bcm frozen sections of cold phosphate buffer saline (PBS) perfused brains taken from mice subject to either normoxia (control) or hypoxic conditions. The following monoclonal antibodies were obtained from BD Pharmingen (La Jolla, CA): rat monoclonal antibodies reactive to: CD31 (clone MEC13.3) and the integrin subunit \u03b15 (clone 5H10-27 (MFR5)) and hamster antibody to the \u03b23 integrin subunit (clone 2C9.G2). Other antibodies used included: hamster anti-CD31 (clone 2H8, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and rabbit anti-Ki67 (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Secondary antibodies used included goat anti-rabbit Cy3 (Jackson Immunoresearch, Baltimore, PA) and anti-rat and anti-hamster Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).\n\nImage analysis\nImages were taken using a 20X objective on a Zeiss Imager M1.m microscope. All analysis was performed in the frontal lobe region of the brain. For each antigen, three images were taken per region at 10X or 20X magnification and the mean calculated for each subject over three different sections. All data analysis was performed using Perkin Elmer Volocity software (Waltham, MA). This includes quantification of total vessel (CD31-positive) area, numbers of CD31/Ki67 dual-positive cells, numbers of \u03b15 integrin and \u03b23 integrin-positive vessels and the size distribution of vessels. Each experiment was performed with 4\u20136 animals per condition, and the results expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical significance was assessed by using the Student\u2019s t test, in which p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Breeding\nTo minimize genetic variances, homozygous MMP-2 knockout (KO) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates were generated by breeding heterozygous males and females on a C57BL/6 background as previously described (\nItoh et al., 1997\n). The genotypes of animals were confirmed by PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers on genomic DNA (\nHsu et al., 2006\n).\n\nRandomization and Blinding\nCongenic littermates were genotyped after weaning and housed till adulthood (3 months of age).

All histological assessments were performed by an observer blinded to injury and genotype of these mice.\n\nAnimal Model\nAll procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, San Francisco. All surgeries were performed blinded to the genotype and randomized across genotypes and post-surgery survival time-points. Adult female WT and KO mice (n = 56) were anesthetized with 2.5% Avertin (0.02 ml/g body weight, intraperitoneally (i.p.), Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and maintained at 37\u00b0C throughout surgery and during recovery by use of a warming pad. A contusive injury was produced as described previously (\nHsu et al., 2006\n). Briefly, using aseptic techniques, the spinous process and the lamina of the 8\nth\nthoracic vertebra (T8) were removed and a circular region of the dura mater (~ 2.4 mm in diameter) was exposed. After stabilization of the vertebral column, a 3-g weight was dropped from a height of 5 cm onto the exposed dura mater. Following injury, the skin was closed with wound clips. Post-operative care included subcutaneous administration of trimethoprim/sulfonamide (Tribrissen), at 30mg/kg, twice a day for 10 days post-injury and manual expression of the bladder twice/day till the end of the study.\n\nSystemic BrdU Injections\nAnimals (n= 5/genotype/time point) were administered bromodeoxyuridine [(BrdU, Sigma, St. Louis) (100 mg/kg, i.p.)] 24 hours prior to euthanasia at 0, 3, 7, 14, or 21 days post-injury.\n\nHistological Analyses\nTissue Preparation\nMice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and the spinal cord was excised and post-fixed for 4 hours at 4\u00b0C, followed by incubation in 20% sucrose for 3-5 days at 4\u00b0C. A segment, 1.5 cm in length and centered over the site of injury, was cryoprotected in tissue embedding medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences, Durham, NC). Spinal cords were sectioned longitudinally at 30-\u03bcm thickness on a cryostat, then thaw mounted on Superfrost microscope slides (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\nImmunohistochemistry\nEvery fifth longitudinal section per animal was used for analysis. To minimize variability, replicates from injured animals and one uninjured animal were processed together. Sections were stained with Armenian Hamster anti-platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (CD31) Ab (Hamster anti mouse, Millipore, Bellerica, MA; 1:500), anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU Ab, polyclonal sheep, Abcam, Cambridge, MA; 1:1000), Rabbit anti-platelet derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFr\u03b2, Rabbit monoclonal anti human, Abcam; 1:100), and Rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, Rabbit polyclonal anti cow, Dako, Carpinteria, CA; 1:500). Secondary antibodies used were, Cy-3 conjugated Goat x Armenian Hamster IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA; 1:200), FITC conjugated Donkey x Sheep IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch; 1:500), Cy-3 conjugated Goat x Rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch; 1:200), AlexaFluor 488 conjugated Goat x Armenian Hamster IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch; 1:200), and Alexa Fluor-647 conjugated Donkey x Rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch; 1:200). Nuclei were visualized with DAPI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; at 300 nM concentration).\nImage Acquisition\nImages were captured at the epicenter, defined as the region of maximal damage. The epicenter was subdivided into 3 zones; a central \u201ccore\u201d composed primarily of macrophages, endothelial cells, and PDGFr\u03b2+ pericyte scarring (\nFigures 1\nand\n2\n), the surrounding glial scar (Zone 1) and the region immediately adjacent to the glial scar (Zone 2), that includes reactive astrocytes (\nFigure 1\n). An internal control consisted of two images, taken at approximately 8 mm rostral and caudal to the epicenter, where the spinal cord showed no overt damage.\nFigure 1. The epicenter of the contused spinal cord at 3 weeks post-injury is characterized by distinct regions, defined by glial and pericyte scarring.\nOpen in a new tab\nA\n, This montage illustrates the typical appearance of the core and Zones 1 and 2, demarcated by white lines. The core typically consists of scattered CD31+ vessels and PBGFr\u03b2+ pericytes, enclosed within a prominent pericyte scar. This pericyte scar is surrounded by Zone 1, consisting of dense GFAP+ glial scarring. Zone 2 represents the region immediately peripheral to the astrocyte scar and consists of both grey and white matter structures. Arrows indicate orientation of the cord as dorsal (d) and caudal (c).\nB\n, An internal control, located approximately 6700-8000 \u03bcm from core, represents baseline expression and distribution of blood vessels, pericytes, and astrocytes.\nC-E\n, Examples of Zones 1 and 2, noting distance from the core, with white lines delineating the boundary between Zone 1 and the core.\nGM: gray matter, WM: white matter\nFigure 2. The epicenter core of the contused spinal cord at 3 weeks post-injury is primarily comprised of macrophages and thick pericyte scarring.\nOpen in a new tab\nThis montage illustrates the core of the epicenter where there is a characteristic dense accumulation of F4/80+ macrophages (white arrows), CD31+ vascular structures and pronounced pericyte scarring (yellow arrows).\nAll measurements of vascularity as defined by vascular density, area, and number of endothelial cells, were restricted to the core (\nFigure 2\n). Three non-overlapping images per section for a total of 8 sections per animal were captured with a 20x objective using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) using the following lasers: 405 nm for DAPI/Hoechst (10%); 488 nm for FITC/Alexa 488 (Argon tube current ~5.5A 5%); 543 nm for CY3 (80%). The Z-stage interval was set at 2 \u03bcm intervals. For the uninjured spinal cord, the same numbers of images were captured per section from the same segmental level of the spinal cord. Images were acquired using identical exposures for all groups and imported into the MetaMorph\n\u00ae\nMicroscopy Automation and Image Analysis software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA).\nNon-overlapping images (635\u03bcm \u00d7 635\u03bcm) within Zones 1 and 2 (\nFigure 1\n) were captured with a Nikon C2 confocal microscope, equipped with 4 lasers (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY) for evaluation of pericyte investment of blood vessels and endothelial apoptosis. The Z-stage interval was set to a 1\u03bcm interval setting. The core was excluded from these analyses due to the dense expression PDGFr\u03b2+ pericytes that obscured profiles of vessels.\nQuantitative Analysis of Endothelial Cell Proliferation\nAll image analyses were performed blinded with respect to sample origin, and a total of 21 - 24 images per animal were evaluated. CD31, BrdU, and DAPI+ nuclei were identified using the Count Nuclei Module and the color combine function in MetaMorph\n\u00ae\nsoftware. Set threshold parameters were used to identify BrdU+ and DAPI+ nuclei in CD31+ endothelial cells. Minimum and maximum nuclei width was set up by identifying positive nuclei in 6-8 images/animal. These set values were then used for all image analyses to obtain segmented images that identified only BrdU and DAPI+ nuclei. These three images (segmented-BrdU, segmented-DAPI and unmodified-CD31) were then overlaid using the color combine function. The total number of CD31+ cells that co-localized with BrdU and DAPI+ nuclei were counted using Metamorph\n\u00ae\n\u2019s Count Nuclei Module. Proliferating endothelial cells are expressed as per \u03bcm\n2\nCD31+ vascular area. Vascularity measurements for total numbers of endothelial cells (CD31+ cells with DAPI+ nucleus) were also counted in these images using a similar method of analysis.\nQuantitative Analysis of Vascular Density\nIntensity measurements were performed using MetaMorph\n\u00ae\nsoftware. Vessel density, determined from CD31+ vessels, was based upon pixel intensity (\nBaluk et al., 2004\n) that was estimated using a set threshold (\nBenton et al., 2009\n;\nBenton et al., 2008\n;\nFassbender et al., 2011\n;\nLutton et al., 2012\n;\nMyers et al., 2011\n;\nMyers et al., 2012\n). Six to eight images per animal at 7 and 14 day time points (time points when we observed maximum CD31 staining) were used to set threshold parameters. Minimum pixel intensity was set such that most of the vessels were detected with minimum background detection while maximum pixel intensity was set to 255. An average of the minimum pixel intensity (determined to be 119 in this study) was then used as the minimum pixel intensity value for analyses of all images. Total intensity of each image was estimated by setting the minimum pixel intensity to 0 and maximum intensity to 255. Percentage vessel density was defined as (threshold pixel intensity/total pixel intensity)*100.\nQuantitative Analysis of Vascular Area\nVascular area was defined as CD31+ area (\nMahoney et al., 2009\n;\nMyers et al., 2012\n) and analyzed using the Angiogenesis Tube Formation application within MetaMorph\n\u00ae\n. Values for three parameters (minimum width, maximum width, and intensity above local background) were established for each time point after injury. The same settings were used for all images and data were expressed as the percentage (%) area covered by vessels [(Vascular area/total image area)*100].\nQuantitative Analysis of Pericyte Coverage\nPericyte coverage of vessels was analyzed at 14 and 21 days post-injury. Images from a Nikon C2 confocal microscope were imported into Metamorph\n\u00ae\nand analyzed using the Manually Count Objects Module, where total numbers of vessels with and without pericyte coverage were determined. Percentage of vessels with pericyte coverage was calculated and compared within each zone between WT and KO.\nGelatin Zymography\nSpinal cord lysates from 5mm segments, prepared from the epicenter (from sham and 21 days post-injury) were prepared as described previously (\nHsu et al., 2006\n) and subjected to gelatin zymography. Equal amounts of protein (30 \u03bcg) were loaded on a 10% zymogram gel. For\nin vitro\nassays, conditioned media from cultured RBCEC-4 cells or activated RBCEC-4 cells were collected and subjected to gelatin zymography. Culture supernatants were concentrated using a 50 K Microcon filter (Millipore, Bellerica, MA), and equal amounts of protein (5 \u03bcg) were loaded on a 10% zymogram gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was incubated with renaturing buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) at room temperature for 30 min to restore the gelatinolytic activity of the proteins, and then incubated with developing buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories) at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue and destained until clear bands became evident.\n\nIn Vitro Endothelial Cell Assays\nCell Lines and Culture Conditions\nRat brain capillary endothelial cells (RBCEC-4) (\nBlasig et al., 2001\n) were propagated in endothelial cell growth medium (Medium 131, Cascade Biologics, Portland, Oregon; 10% heat inactivated, fetal bovine serum, Hyclone, Logan, UT; 1X microvascular growth supplement (MVGS), Cascade Biologics; and 1X penicillin/streptomycin, UCSF Cell Culture Facility) on tissue culture dishes that were coated with 0.2 mg/ml of rat tail Collagen, Type I (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The MMP-2 specific inhibitor, cis-9-octadecenoyl-N-hydroxylamide (OA-Hy, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA; K\ni\n=1.7 \u03bcM) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and used at a final concentration of 25 \u03bcM. MMP-9 inhibitor I (Calbiochem, C\n50\n= 5 nM), MMP-1 (IC\n50\n= 1.05 \u03bcM) and MMP-13 (IC\n50\n= 113 nM), was dissolved in DMSO and used at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcM. DMSO served as the vehicle control. Endothelial cells were activated with 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and in some experiments (tube formation or proliferation) were exposed to purified recombinant human MMP-9 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at 10 pg/ml, 50 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml for 2h or 24h.\nBrdU Assay\nEndothelial cell proliferation was determined using a BrdU ELISA kit (Chemicon, Bellerica, MA) following a protocol recommended by the vendor. Cells were plated at the same conditions as described above in 96-well plates. MMP-9 was induced in cells by addition of 10 ng/ml TNF-\u03b1. Cultures were exposed to MMP-9 at 50 ng/ml in the absence of serum or growth factors, or MMP-2 or -9 specific inhibitors (25 \u03bcM OA-Hy or 1 \u03bcM MMP-9 inhibitor I in DMSO overnight). The following day BrdU was added and cells incubated at 37\u00b0C/5% CO\n2\novernight. Fixative/Denaturing Solution (Chemicon kit) was added to each well, followed by incubation with anti-BrdU antibody and Goat anti-Mouse IgG HRP Conjugate. The color was developed by addition of Substrate Solution and Stop Solution to each well. Absorbance was measured at dual wavelengths of 450-540 nm with a Thermomax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Each assay was repeated twice with 4 wells/condition and absorbance normalized to medium or medium plus TNF-\u03b1 / MMP-9.\nEndothelial Cell Migration Assay\nMigration was measured using Transwell culture chambers (polycarbonate filter with 8 \u03bcm pore size, 6.5 mm insert diameter (Costar, Corning, NY). Transwell chambers were coated with 0.2 mg/ml Collagen Type I and placed in a 24-well plate containing 600 \u03bcl of endothelial cell growth medium (Medium 131, Cascade Biologics, 10% heat inactivated, fetal bovine serum, Hyclone, 1X microvascular growth supplement (MVGS), Cascade Biologics; and 1X penicillin/streptomycin, UCSF Cell Culture Facility). 1\u00d710\n5\ncells resuspended in serum free medium, medium containing DMSO or medium containing OA-Hy were placed in the upper compartment of the chamber and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18-20 h to allow cell migration (3 Transwells per condition). F-10/alpha MEM medium without FBS was used as a negative control. Cells were fixed on the membrane with 4% PFA and stained with DAPI. All images were captured on a fluorescence microscope (Optiphot EF-D3; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a SPOT camera (SPOT\u2122 Imaging solutions, Sterling Heights, MI) using the same exposure setting. The number of endothelial cells on the lower surface of the filter was determined by counting five randomly selected fields per membrane (100x magnification) using MetaMorph\n\u00ae\n\u2019s Count Nuclei Module. Each experiment was performed three times using triplicate wells and migration was expressed as relative cells migrated as compared to medium alone.\nEndothelial Tube Formation Assay\nMatrigel tube formation assays were performed in 96-well plates, coated with 50 \u03bcl Matrigel/well (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA), and incubated at 37\u00b0C/5%CO\n2\nincubator for 1 hour. Cells were plated at a density of 1.5 \u00d7 10\n4\ncells per well in endothelial cell basal medium containing 0.1% BSA, in the presence and absence of OA-Hy (25 \u03bcM). Endothelial cells were activated with 10 ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 or incubated with MMP-9 at 10 pg/ml, 50 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml for 2h or 24h. MMP-9 inhibitor I (1 \u03bcM) was used with activated endothelial cells. Images were digitally captured on an inverted microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA) equipped with a SPOT camera (SPOT\u2122 Imaging solutions) and analyzed using Angiogenesis Tube Formation Module (MetaMorph\n\u00ae\n). Total tube length, number of segments and number of branch points were determined. Each assay was repeated two to three times with 4-5 wells/condition and values normalized to medium or medium plus TNF-\u03b1/ MMP-9.\n\nStatistical Analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (Version 6.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Unless otherwise stated, data showed a normal distribution based upon the Shapiro-Wilk test. All\nin viv\no quantifications were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and where appropriate Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test was used for within group and between group comparisons. For\nin vitro\nassays, 2 group comparisons were analyzed using unpaired two-tailed t-tests, whereas analyses of 3 or more groups were by one-way ANOVA and where appropriate, the Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. All data are represented as means + standard error of the mean with significance defined as p \u2264 0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animals were group housed with littermates (3-5 mice per cage) under controlled conditions of temperature and light (12 hour light/dark cycle). Food and water were provided\nad libitum\n. R6/2 mice (stock # 002810, carrying 160\u00b15 cag repeats) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred in the vivarium at the ONPRC. Wild-type males were mated with ovary transplanted wild-type females. Transgenic mice were genotyped using primers specific for the mutant human HTT transgene (forward primer 5\u2019 TCATCAGCTTTTCCAGGGTCGCCAT and reverse primer 5\u2019 CGCAGGCTAGGGCTGTCAATCATGCT), and age-matched wild-type littermates were used for the indicated experiments. A subset of mice from the colony that participated in the current studies were used to assess CAG repeat length (n=12), showing a mean length of 165 \u00b1 5 (SD) repeats (Laragen Sequencing and Genotyping, Los Angeles, CA). Body weights of all animals were recorded weekly. All experimental procedures were performed according to ONPRC and OHSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nAdrenalectomy Surgery\nMice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane. A 2cm \u00d7 2cm square was shaved on their lower dorsal surface and an incision was made in the skin at the animal's dorsal midline (this opening was used for the removal of both adrenal glands). Next, a small (3-5mm) incision in the muscular wall was made, directly above the kidney. Small tweezers were used to grasp and gently remove the adrenal gland. This procedure was repeated for the animal's contralateral side (bilateral adrenalectomy). The muscle incisions were closed using suture and the dorsal skin was closed with wound clips.\n\nCorticosterone Replacement\nCorticosterone replacement was provided in the animals\u2019 drinking water, which was available ad-libitum. Corticosterone (Sigma, cat. #27840) was dissolved in a small volume of ethanol (0.6%), and then added to dH\n2\n0. Since the aldosterone producing cells of the adrenal gland are lost to adrenalectomy, NaCl (0.9%) was also added to replace salt loss. Sucrose (2.0%) was also added to increase palatability of the solution. A dose of 10ug/ml corticosterone was used for the physiological/WT level replacement group and 60ug/ml of corticosterone was used for the high/HD level replacement group. Vehicle alone (2% sucrose, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.6% ethanol in dH\n2\n0) was given to the sham surgery animals. All treatments were balanced for sex and genotype, with 2 WT and 2 HD age-matched mice randomized and caged together from the colony, into each male and female cage. A total of 48 mice were used in this study, with n=16 (4 HD males, 4 HD females, 4 WT males, and 4 WT females) for each of the three treatments. The experimenter was blind to the three different experimental conditions and genotypes. Replacement solution intake (volume) was monitored daily for each cage, and averaged over the week (and mathematically adjusted for all 4 mice in a weekly intake/mouse/week score \u2013 this was further adjusted with the loss of mice due to early death).\n\nRestraint Stress\nMice were restrained for 30 minutes in modified 50mL conical tubes (\nBale\net al.\n, 2002\n). Several air-holes were drilled into the bottom of each tube, tubes were shortened to restrict forward and backward movement and were closed at the end. Tube lengths were 7.3cm (for mice \u226420g), 8.1cm (mice between 20g \u2013 25g), and 9.0cm (for mice >25g). Mice underwent restraint stress at 4, 7, and 10 weeks of age.\n\nBehavioral Measures \u2013 Open Field\nMice were placed singly in a dimly lit, automated infra-red activity arenas (40.64 x 40.64 cm) for 15 minutes (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT). Each open field arena was enclosed in a sound attenuating chamber. Mice were habituated to the room for 1 hour before testing, and all testing occurred in the afternoon between 4-6pm. Distance traveled during the 15 minute test period was measured. Mice were assayed in the open field at weeks 6, 8, and 10.\n\nBlood Collection and processing\nBlood was collected by saphenous venipuncture in the dose response and adrenalectomy studies. Mice were gently restrained, their left hind-limb extended and wiped with antibiotic ointment (to visualize the vein), the vein was punctured using a 30g needle, and whole blood was collected into heparinized collection tubes and processed for plasma. The tail clip method was utilized for serial blood measurements in the circadian corticosterone and stress-induced corticosterone studies. The tip of the tail was clipped (0.5mm), and approximately 20ul of whole blood was collected from the tip and collected into heparinized capillary tubes, and processed for plasma. The incision site was disrupted for subsequent sampling within the same week. Handling of mice during tail-clip method blood collection was minimized, and typically lasted approximately 30 seconds. All plasma was assayed for corticosterone by the ONPRC Endocrine Technology CORE using an in-house radio-immuno assay. For the circadian CORT experiment, blood was collected every 20 hours over 5 days for a total of 6 collections (6pm, 2pm, 10am, 6am, 2am, and 10pm). Blood was collected every 20 hours, versus every 4, to avoid artificially elevating plasma corticosterone levels due to frequent repeated handling stress. This procedure was repeated for each mouse included in the study, at each age (4, 7, and 10 weeks); thus, each mouse had a total of 18 blood collections. A total of 28 mice were used for the circadian CORT experiment, including 6 WT females, 5 WT males, 6 HD females, and 11 HD males. More HD than WT mice were included to account for possible premature deaths before the end of the experiment. For the stress induced CORT experiment, blood was collected every 30 minutes, starting immediately before the mice were placed into restrainer tubes. Blood was collected 5 times (0, 30, 60, 90, 120min) for each mouse at 3 ages (4, 7, and 10 weeks of age), which was carried out between 11am and 2pm. A total of 30 mice were used in this experiment, including 4 WT females, 8 WT males, 12 HD females, and 6 HD males. For both the circadian and the stress-induced CORT studies, the experimenter was blind to genotype at the time of blood collection and assay.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed by using JMP Version 11 (SAS Institute Inc.). A repeated measures mixed-model was used for all repeated measures (dependent variables: bodyweight, open field, circadian CORT, stress induced CORT; independent variables: genotype, sex, treatment, time-point and/or age). A proportional hazards model was used to analyze the survivorship data, which allows for post-hoc multiple pairwise comparisons between groups. A three-way ANOVA was used to assess the effects of genotype, sex, and treatment group on plasma CORT levels. Post-hoc contrasts were used to assess differences between WT and HD mice in the circadian corticosterone experiment at each possible age/time combination (i.e. HD vs WT mice at 10pm at 10 weeks of age), and alpha level was Bonferroni adjusted to 0.002 (.05/18 comparisons \u2013\np\n<.002 was considered statistically significant). For all other analyses, Tukey's post-hoc comparisons were performed when statistically significant fixed effects were detected (\np\n< 0.05 was considered statistically significant)."

    "Methods": "Design\nThis was a prospective analysis of the secondary study outcomes from a phase I/II clinical trial of diaphragmatic gene therapy in infantile-onset Pompe disease (NCT: 00976352, IND: BB14131). The Institutional Review Board at the University of Florida approved the study design and procedures. Subjects were enrolled during a Screening visit, and then a period of inspiratory muscle conditioning exercise was implemented as a pre-operative control. Baseline function was recorded the day prior to dosing. After dosing with rAAV1-CMV-GAA, exercise was continued post-operatively. We compared the pre-operative period of exercise, which lasted approximately 90 days, to post-dosing tests conducted every 90 days for one year. The study design and specifics of dosing were published previously (\nByrne et al., 2014\n).\n\nSubjects\nParticipants had a confirmed diagnosis of infantile Pompe disease by GAA assay blood test, fibroblast culture or mutational analysis and chronic respiratory insufficiency despite long-term use of ERT. Chronic respiratory insufficiency was defined as a requirement for one or more hours of MV assistance for a minimum of three months prior to enrollment. The first five subjects required 24-hour MV through an invasive airway. Then, when safety reports from the first five subjects were satisfactory (\nSmith et al., 2013\n), children with part-time and non-invasive MV interfaces were eligible to participate. Informed consent was obtained from the parents or guardians, and school-aged children provided their assent to participate.\nExclusionary characteristics included a body mass under 10 kg, history of low platelet count or elevated INR, abnormal chemistry profile (elevated transaminases, alkaline phosphatases, bilirubin, or gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase), acute requirement for intravenous antibiotic therapy or corticosteroids, and/or having gene transfer agents six months prior to the study. Participants received ERT infusions every 1-2 weeks for >1 year and remained on ERT throughout the study. Subjects who participated in other therapeutic studies were not eligible.\n\nInspiratory Muscle Conditioning Exercises\nUpon enrollment, participants were prescribed an inspiratory muscle conditioning exercise program, based upon MIP and their ability to breathe without support. Inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) exercises were three days per week and consisted of 3-4 sets of 6-10 inspiratory efforts, using a modified threshold-training device (Threshold PEP or Accu-PEEP). The inspiratory port of the training devices remained closed until subjects generated a minimum (threshold) inspiratory pressure. Training devices were connected either directly to the tracheostomy tube, or to a facemask sealed over the mouth and nose, for patients without an invasive MV interface. Subjects trained at the highest tolerated load, where they generated at least 50% of their unassisted tidal volume while maintaining SpO\n2\n>92%. Subjects with an MIP of <3cm H\n2\nO initially used no training device. In addition to IMST, short periods of breathing with reduced or no ventilator support (endurance exercises) were prescribed two days per week for children who used the ventilator full-time. Parents of the participants were instructed in the exercise prescription and provided with a training diary to monitor progress at home. Additionally, investigators communicated regularly with families to monitor compliance, answer questions, and progress training.\n\nGene Therapy\nStudy vector was a clinical-grade adeno-associated virus vector serotype 1, with a cytomegalovirus promoter and human GAA cDNA (rAAV1-CMV-GAA) manufactured at The Powell Gene Therapy Center's Human Applications Laboratory, University of Florida. For each subject, three injections of AAV1-CMV-GAA were administered by direct visualization of each hemi-diaphragm into anterior, medial, and posterior regions via video assisted thorascopic procedure. Subjects 1-3 received 1\u00d710\n12\nvg (low dose), while subjects 4-9 received 5\u00d710\n12\nvg (high dose) of vector. Subjects were discharged from the hospital within three days. Further details on vector production, dosing, and safety profile are available in a previous publication.(\nSmith et al., 2013\n)\n\nRespiratory Outcomes\nResting Breathing Pattern\nRespiratory variables (inspired tidal volume (V\nT\n), peak inspiratory flow (PIF), inspiratory pressure (P\nI\n), inspiratory time (T\nI\n), expiratory time (T\nE\n), and duty cycle (T\nI\n/T\nTOT\n)) were captured with a respiratory monitor (CO\n2\nSMO, Philips-Respironics, Murrysville, PA) and data acquisition software (Analysis Plus, Respironics Inc, Murrysville, PA). The breathing pattern was recorded for 5 minutes after the child became acclimated to the testing device, while distracted by a cartoon. Values obtained during the third minute were averaged and reported.\nMaximal Inspiratory Pressure\nStatic pressure generation of the inspiratory muscles was tested with maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) test. We used the one-way inspiratory occlusion method validated in pediatric ICU patients.(\nHarikumar et al., 2008\n) To summarize, the tracheostomy cuff was inflated for invasively ventilated subjects prior to the test. Then, subjects were removed briefly from the ventilator, and a pressure manometer and one-way valve were attached directly to the tracheostomy tube. For subjects who were not invasively ventilated, the manometer and one-way valve were connected to a mask that fully covered the nose and mouth. Exhalation was unrestricted, but the one-way valve blocked inspiration. The test lasted 15 seconds for subjects aged 3 years and under, and 20 seconds for subjects 4 years and older. The MIP test was repeated three times with at least two minutes of rest between repetitions, and the best effort was reported.\nLoad Compensation\nVolume, flow and timing compensatory responses to inspiratory loads were evaluated using Threshold training devices while subjects breathed spontaneously without MV support. Respiratory sensors (Capnostat Plus, Philips Respironics, Murrysville, PA) were attached to the training devices and then connected directly to either the tracheostomy tube or a tightly-fitting facemask. Higher tension on the IMST device required a greater pressure effort from subjects to open the valve and receive air. At each LC pressure load (0, 5, 10 cm H\n2\nO), subjects made 12-15 best-effort breaths, with visual feedback from a computer and strong encouragement from study staff. An estimated inspiratory workload was calculated for each LC breath (defined as the product of the inspiratory pressure * inspired volume), and the 6 breaths with the highest imposed workload were averaged for statistical analysis.\nDynamic MRI of diaphragmatic descent\nT2-weighted gradient echo sequences (true fast imaging with steady-state free precession, TRUFI) of the chest without contrast were obtained from a 1.5T MR scanner (Siemens Avanto). The following parameters were used: TR = 84 ms; TE = 1.04 ms; thickness = 8 mm. The field of view ranged from the mid-cervical to lower thoracic spinal levels and took approximately 30 minutes to acquire. An MR-safe ventilator (LTV 1150) was brought in for full-time MV users. Two twenty-second scans were acquired during the following conditions: free-breathing ventilation with usual MV settings (full-time MV subjects only), free-breathing without MV (full-time and partial/no MV subjects), and deep, fast breathing without MV (partial/no MV subjects). Localizer scans visualized the costal diaphragm at end exhalation. Scans were obtained in the right and left sagittal planes, at the dome of the costal diaphragm as visualized by the localizer. MRI was conducted on the day before dosing and on Day 180.\nTo exclude effects of the A-P position or cardiac interference on diaphragm motion, we compared diaphragm descent in the right sagittal plane, during the free-breathing condition without MV. Diaphragm descent was analyzed with open-source imaging software (OsiriX Lite, Pixmeo, Geneva, Switzerland). The distance was measured between a fixed position at the apex of the lung and the attachment of the dorsal diaphragm to the posterior chest wall. The descent of the diaphragm was defined as the difference between the distance at end-inhalation and the distance at end-exhalation. All breaths from the free-breathing acquisitions were used to obtain an average diaphragm descent. The inter-observer reliability of the diaphragm descent measurements was established between two independent observers blinded to the study design (n= 5 subjects, ICC =0.975, p<0.001). These observers remained blinded until the motion analysis was completed.\nDiaphragm EMG\nTwo years prior to enrollment in the gene therapy clinical trial, one subject (#8) received a diaphragm pacemaker and weaned from fulltime MV dependence to nighttime support. The subject was maintained chronically on diaphragm pacing 30-60 minutes per day for 3-5 days/week, and continued this regimen in lieu of IMST exercises. Additionally, the implanted pacing electrodes were connected to data acquisition equipment (Power Lab 16/30, AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, Colorado) to record diaphragm activity during spontaneous and loaded breaths as well as MIP. Diaphragm activity at baseline was compared to D180 post-dosing.\n\nData analysis\nFirst, the distribution of the data was tested. Subject descriptors were evaluated with either the independent t test (mean, SD) or Mann-Whitney U test (median, interquartile range). Relationships between demographics, MIP, and ILC responses were assessed with Pearson correlation. To evaluate the effects of baseline function and therapeutic interventions on LC responses, we used two-way repeated-measures ANOVA for MV support (full or partial dependence) and time (Screening/enrollment visit, Baseline at dosing, Day 90, 180, 365). Significant interactions were then subjected to Tukey's method of cell means contrasts. Row means were contrasted for significant main effects, using Tukey's corrections. All calculations were conducted using commercially available software (Prism v6, GraphPad, La Jolla, CA), and statistical significance was p<0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals treatment\nAll animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Cleveland Clinic. Six-week old C57/BL/6J male mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and used for all experiments. Upon arrival, mice were placed on standard chow for 10\u201314 days. To induce demyelination, mice were fed a diet containing 0.3% cuprizone (bis-cyclohexanone oxaldihydrazone, Sigma-Aldrich), thoroughly mixed into standard chow and custom-made into pellets by Harlan Teklad (Madison, WI), for 12 weeks\nad libitum\n. During this time, mice were also given daily intraperitoneal injection of rapamycin (10 mg/kg body weight), reconstituted fresh in vehicle solution (5% PEG-1000, 5% Tween-80 and 5% ethanol). Cuprizone chow was changed every two days and the weight of mice was monitored weekly. At the end of the 12-week demyelination, mice were either perfused to assess the extent of demyelination, or returned to normal chow minus rapamycin injections to allow for spontaneous remyelination for one to six weeks. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine followed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.08M phosphate buffer.\n\nTissue processing\nThe same brain was used to analyze remyelination in cortex, hippocampus and corpus callosum. To obtain corpus callosum tissues for analysis, the brain was placed into a custom-made brain mold containing mm-thick slicing slots for precision slicing. A 1 mm-thick coronal brain slice, located approximately at Bregma 0 to \u22121 mm, was immediately placed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% PFA for two additional days. Subsequently, this brain slice was cut in halve, and the corpus callosum near the midline (~5\u00d71\u00d71 mm) was processed and embedded for 1 \u03bcm-thick sections and 3D-EM analyses. Corpus callosum ultrastructure was similar to that obtained from animals perfused with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% PFA.\nFollowing extraction of the 1 mm-thick slice, the rest of the brain pieces (rostral and caudal) were returned to 4% paraformaldehyde fixative for two days and used for gray matter remyelination analysis. The caudal piece that contains hippocampus was mounted on a Leica freezing microtome and sliced at 30 \u03bcm thickness. Slices were collected and transferred to 24-well plates containing cryostorage solution (0.2M phosphate solution, pH 7.4; 1% polyvinylpyrolidone; 30% sucrose, 30% ethylene glycol), and examined under dissecting microscope to determine the approximate anteroposterior position. Two 30 \u03bcm-thick brain sections, located at approximately ~Bregma \u22121.0 to \u22121.5 mm, were selected for immunohistological staining and analysis for both hippocampus and cortex.\n\nImmunohistochemical staining for free floating slices\nThirty-micron thick brain slices were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), microwaved in 0.01M citric buffer (pH 6.0) for 2 minutes, rinsed in PBS and incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide and 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS for 30 minutes. Slices were blocked with 3% normal serum and incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4\u00b0C. Slices were then rinsed in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and stained by the avidin-biotin complex (ABC) procedure and diaminobenzedine as described previously (\nTrapp et al., 1997\n). After several washes, sections were mounted on glass slides and dried overnight at room temperature. Primary antibodies included: rat anti-proteolipid protein AA3 (1:5000) (\nYamamura et al., 1991\n) and mouse monoclonal Iba1 (1:500, Cleveland Clinic Hybridoma Core), CD44 (1:40, StemCell Technologies) and GFAP (1:5000, DAKO). Hyaluronan was localized with a biotinylated hyaluronan-binding protein (1:50, EMD Millipore).\n\nQuantification of PLP staining in hippocampus and cerebral cortex\nPLP-stained sections were scanned in a Mirax high resolution slide scanner equipped with a 20x objective (Zeiss). Each image tile was acquired from 5-focal levels that are 2 \u03bcm apart and projected into one final composite. Images were imported into NIH ImageJ software for analysis. For hippocampus, the ROI was determined by anatomical boundary, excluding borders that are not completely demyelinated following cup/rap treatment (\nFig. 1A\n). For cerebral cortex, the ROI was defined as the region containing piriform cortex lateral to the amygdalar capsule (\nFig. 1A\n). Once ROIs had been outlined, color images were converted into 8-bit grayscale images and thresholded based on intensity. The threshold masks and areas of ROIs were measured to calculate percentage area occupied by PLP staining. The thresholded mask was also pasted over the original image to confirm accuracy of thresholding. Two brain slices were used per mouse, and the results from the hippocampus or cortex were averaged.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nRapamycin increases cuprizone-induced demyelination.

(I\u2013K) Quantification of myelinated axons in corpus callosum, and PLP staining in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Mice were injected with Rap-only (CTL), fed 0.3% cuprizone only (Cup only) or cuprizone plus daily rapamycin injection (Cup/Rap) for 12 weeks. Error bar: standard deviation. Error bar: standard deviation. Scale: 5 \u03bcm (C\u2013E), 100 \u03bcm (F\u2013H).\n\nQuantification of myelinated axons in corpus callosum\nFor 1 \u03bcm-thick analysis of myelinated axons, the midline corpus callosum was processed through osmium tetroxide, dehydrated and embedded in epon resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and cut into 1 \u03bcm-thick serial sections. Approximately 50\u201370 sections were collected on 10\u201312 microscope slides. One from every four slides was stained with toluidine blue and examined under the microscope to determine the slide numbers that are ~0.6 mm lateral to the midline. Two new slides were then selected and stained with 4% paraphenylenediamine (PPD) (Sigma) to visualize myelinated axons. From each slide, two corpus callosum images were taken from the ROI, which had been validated in our proof-of-concept studies and is approximately ~350 \u03bcm rostral to the junction of corpus callosum and fornix (\nFig. 1A\n), using a 63x oil immersion objective (N.A. 1.4). A total of 4 images were obtained from each brain. Images were then imported into ImageJ software for counting. To facilitate counting, a grid of 300 \u03bcm\n2\nwas overlaid on top of the images and the number of myelinated axons in each image was counted manually. In the case where there were more than five hundred myelinated axons in one image, myelinated axons in 9 pre-determined boxes were counted and extrapolated for that image. Myelinated axon counts from four images per brain were averaged to obtain a final count for each brain. The counts represent the number of myelinated axons in a 180 \u03bcm unit length of longitudinal corpus callosum in the ROI.\n\n3D-EM morphometric analysis\nCorpus callosum tissue was stained with OsO\n4\n-ferricyanide, followed by thiocarbohydrazide, osmium tetroxide, aqueous uranyl acetate, and lead aspartate, dehydrated, and embedded in epon for 3D-EM imaging. Tissue blocks were imaged utilizing a Zeiss Sigma VP scanning electron microscope, fitted with a Gatan 3view2 in-chamber ultra-microtome and a low kV backscatter electron detector. Corpus callosum was imaged in coronal plane at a resolution of 7\u201310 nm/pixel and slice thicknesses of 60\u201390 nm at 2.25 kV. Images were imported into ImageJ software for three-dimensional reconstruction. For analysis of internodal length, approximately 15\u201350 axons, with diameter larger than 0.3 \u03bcm, were traced from each block. The distances from the end of the outermost paranodal loops were used to measure internodal length.\nFor electron microscopy analysis of axon numbers in tissues embedded for PPD staining, 1 \u03bcm-thick sections were mounted on coverslips and stained with TEM stains (saturated uranyl acetate in 60% methanol for 10 minutes at 60\u00b0C and then lead citrate for 10 minutes at room temperature). Sections were imaged using backscatter electron detector as above. Three fields of corpus callosum were selected at low magnification and then imaged at 8\u201310 nm/pixel, with beam energy of 2.2 kV which generates an image from ~25 nm-thick slice (interaction volume) beneath the section surface comparable to a thin TEM section. Both myelinated and unmyelinated axons were identified in ImageJ and only axons with diameter larger than 0.3 \u03bcm were counted.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSamples were analyzed blindly. Parametric or non-parametric statistics were used to assess significant differences. All data sets were first tested for normality using Kolmogorov-Smirnov or Shapiro-Wilk tests. For data with normal distribution, two-tailed Student\u2019s\nt-\ntest or one-way ANOVA was used, followed by post hoc testing using Holm-Sidak (or Tukey) method for pair-wise comparison as recommended by SigmaPlot/SigmaStat (SYSTAT, San Jose, CA) or open source software RKward (KDE.org). Data that did not pass normality test or equal variance test were analyzed using Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test/U statistics or Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on Ranks. Outliers were identified based on Chauvenet\u2019s criterion and excluded from the analysis. Data were presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or standard error of the mean (SEM) as indicated. Based upon power analyses, typically 8\u201315 mice were included in individual experiments."

    "Methods": "Recombinant tau proteins\nFull-length tau protein (hT40) corresponds to the longest isoform in the adult human brain, consisting of 441 amino acids and four microtubule-binding repeats. Pseudophosphorylation (i.e., switching serine to a glutamate) was used to mimic phosphorylation at position 422 in tau. Pseudophosphorylation is a routine approach to examine both single and multiple phosphorylation residues on the tau protein (\nGuillozet-Bongaarts et al., 2006\n;\nJeganathan et al., 2008\n;\nKanaan et al., 2012\n;\n2011\n;\nLaPointe et al., 2009a\n;\nMatsuo et al., 1994\n;\nNecula and Kuret, 2005\n). Pseudophosphorylated S422E tau was generated using mutagenesis of the hT40 construct per the manufacturer's instructions (QuikChange Lightning Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, Agilent Technologies, 210515). The forward primer used in this reaction was: CAGCATCGACATGGTAGAC\nGAG\nCCCCAGCTCGCCACGCTAG. pT7c plasmid DNAs containing either hT40 or S422E were amplified in XL10-Gold ultracompetent\nEscherichia coli\n, purified using the PureLink Quick Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Invitrogen, K2100), and verified by DNA sequencing. Proteins were expressed in T7 Express supercompetent\nEscherichia coli\n, and purified through C-terminal His-tag metal affinity chromatography (Talon resin, Clontech, 635502) followed by size exclusion chromatography using an S200 26/60 column (GE Healthcare, 17-1195-01) as previously described (\nCarmel et al., 1996\n;\nKimura et al., 1996\n;\nStoothoff and Johnson, 2005\n).\n\nIn vitro tau polymerization reaction\nTau polymerization was induced with arachidonic acid (ARA; Cayman Chemical, 90010) as previously described (\nGamblin et al., 2000\n;\nGuillozet-Bongaarts et al., 2006\n;\nKimura et al., 1996\n;\nLaPointe et al., 2009a\n;\nVana et al., 2011\n). Briefly, recombinant tau (2\u03bcM) was incubated in polymerization buffer (5mM dithiothreitol, 100mM NaCl, 0.1mM EDTA, 10mM HEPES, pH 7.6) with 75\u03bcM ARA (final concentration) at room temperature for 6 h. ARA was stored at \u221220\u00b0C, and working solutions were prepared in 100% ethanol immediately prior to use. Control (monomer) samples were prepared in polymerization buffer with ARA vehicle (i.e., 100% ethanol). A combination of right angle laser light scatter, thioflavin S (ThS), and transmission electron microscopy was used to validate tau aggregation.\n\nRight angle laser light scatter (LLS) assay\nTau polymerization was monitored in real-time by measuring the intensity of right angle light scatter (\ni\nS\n; (\nGamblin et al., 2000\n;\nGuillozet-Bongaarts et al., 2006\n)). A 475 nm laser (B&W Tek, Inc., BWI-475-20-E) was used to illuminate polymerization reactions. Images of scattered light were captured throughout the 6h polymerization reaction using a high sensitivity CMOS digital camera (Thor Labs, DCC1240M) and imaging software uc480 Viewer version 4.2. Images were collected using an exposure time of 175.15 ms, a frame rate of 4.01 fps, and a pixel clock of 11 MHz. Individual images were imported into Photoshop CS5 Version 12.1 (Adobe Systems, Inc.) where the marquee tool was used to select a region of interest (75 \u00d7 10 pixels) within the scattered light near the middle of the cuvette. The intensity of scattered light was obtained using the histogram feature. The background intensity was subtracted by measuring scattering in the cuvette prior to the addition of ARA (\nGamblin et al., 2000\n;\nVana et al., 2011\n). Each experiment was repeated five independent times, and background-corrected light scatter data were plotted as a function of time. The polymerization kinetics curve was best fit with the sigmoidal Gompertz equation (\nBussi\u00e8re et al., 1999\n;\nHasegawa et al., 1996\n;\nNecula and Kuret, 2004a\n;\nWinsor, 1932\n).\n\nThioflavin S\nA 0.0175% solution of ThS (Sigma, #T1892) was prepared on the day of each experiment and filtered using a 0.2\u03bcm syringe filter before use. To measure ThS fluorescence, 6 \u03bcL of 0.0175% ThS was added to 150 \u03bcL of 2\u03bcM aggregated tau (hT40 or S422E) in a black 96-well plate (Fisher Scientific, 06-443-2), such that the final concentration of ThS was 0.0007%. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 25\u00b0C in a GloMax Multi Detection System (Promega) with an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 510-570 nm. Each experiment was repeated three independent times. To compare measurements from independent experiments, background fluorescence was measured in wells containing tau (hT40 or S422E) + vehicle (ethanol), and subtracted from each respective treatment condition.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nAliquots of polymerized tau samples were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde, spotted onto 300 mesh Formvar carbon coated copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 215-412-8400), and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Grids were examined with a JEOL JEM-1400 Plus electron microscope at 80 kV and \u00d710,000 magnification. Images were captured with an AMT XR81 digital camera and AMT software version 602.6 (Advanced Microscopy Techniques). Tau samples were diluted to a final concentration of 1.6 \u03bcM to capture representative images of each polymerization reaction, or diluted to a final concentration of 0.2\u03bcM for quantitative TEM analysis. A higher dilution was used for the quantitative analysis to obtain samples with discrete, non-overlapping aggregates.\nImages were processed using Image J to measure total aggregate mass, individual aggregate area, aggregate number, and individual aggregate lengths (\nFig. S1\n). For the individual aggregate measures (i.e., number and length) objects were separated into three categories based on area; 1) oligomers were <1000nm\n2\n, 2) short filaments were 1000 \u2013 5000 nm\n2\n, or 3) long filaments were >5000 nm\n2\n. All images were captured at \u00d710,000 magnification with a standard beam intensity and gain for consistency across samples. A macro was used in Image J to measure total aggregate mass, individual aggregate area and aggregate number. The scale was set at 373.5 pixels equal to 400 nm. Images were smoothed twice to eliminate small variations in estimations of object area, and auto threshold was used to distinguish aggregates over background. Total mass of aggregated tau was determined by summating the area of individual aggregates (nm\n2\n) covering the field. Aggregate counts were performed for three populations of aggregates sorted by area: oligomers = < 1000 nm\n2\n, short filaments = 1000 \u2013 5000 nm\n2\n, long filaments = > 5000 nm\n2\n. Aggregate length was not an output of the Image J macro, thus these measurements were made manually in Image J by measuring the distance along the longest axis of individual oligomers (100 per sample), short filaments (average of 24 per sample) and long filaments (average of 50 per sample). Each experiment was repeated three independent times, and five fields from each sample were randomly captured during each experiment and used for analysis.\n\nSoluble tau extraction from fresh frozen human tissue\nSoluble tau was prepared from frontal cortex tissue of non-demented control (n=6; age: mean=83yrs, range=75-95 yrs; sex: 4 female, 2 male; Braak stage II-III) and AD cases (n=6; age: mean=84 yrs, range=69-93 yrs; sex: 0 female, 6 male; Braak stage VI) as described previously (\nDeters et al., 2009\n;\nGotz et al., 2001\n;\nGrueninger et al., 2010\n;\nKanaan et al., 2016\n). Briefly, tissue pieces from cortex (0.5-1 grams) were homogenized on ice in ten volumes (1g=10ml) of brain homogenization buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.4, 274mM NaCl, 5mM KCl, 1mM PMSF, and 10 \u03bcg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, bestatin, and aprotinin). The soluble tau fraction was collected in the supernatant following centrifugation at 27,000 \u00d7 g for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The samples were assayed for total protein concentration using the Lowry protein assay and stored at -80\u00b0C until used in sandwich ELISAs for analysis (see below).\n\nTau sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)\nA novel sandwich ELISA was developed to measure the relative levels of oligomer formation and PAD exposure in recombinant tau proteins and pS422-containing tau species in the frontal cortex from human brains samples. All steps were performed at room temperature. Washing was performed between each step using 200\u03bcL/well of ELISA wash buffer (100mM borate acid, 25mM sodium borate, 75mM NaCl, 0.25mM thimerosal, 0.4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20), and all other steps were performed using 50\u03bcL solution/well. For recombinant tau protein sandwich ELISAs, the following capture antibodies were used: Tau5, TNT1, or TOC1. Tau5 is a monoclonal mouse IgG1 raised against bovine tau, with a continuous epitope between amino acids 215-225. Tau5 is a pan-tau antibody that labels monomeric and aggregated tau equally well (\nCarmel et al., 1996\n;\nKanaan et al., 2011\n;\nLaPointe et al., 2009b\n;\nLoPresti et al., 1995\n;\nPorzig et al., 2007\n). TNT1 is a monoclonal mouse IgG1 directed against N-terminal amino acids 2-18 (AEPRQEFEVMEDHAGTY), the PAD (\nKanaan et al., 2012\n;\n2011\n). In native assays, reactivity of TNT1 is dependent upon conformational display of PAD, which is a disease-specific event (\nKanaan et al., 2012\n;\n2011\n). TOC1 is a monoclonal mouse IgM raised against tau dimers (\nBerger et al., 2007\n;\nKopeikina et al., 2011\n;\nMaeda et al., 2007\n;\nPatterson et al., 2011a\n;\nSahara et al., 2013\n). The TOC1 epitope (amino acids 209-224) is conformation dependent as it is revealed upon dimerization and oligomerization of tau (\nWard et al., 2013\n). High binding 96-well microplates (Fisher Scientific, 07-200-35) were coated with Tau5 (1\u03bcg/ml), TNT1 (2\u03bcg/ml) or TOC1 (2\u03bcg/ml) capture antibody diluted in borate saline (100mM borate acid, 25mM sodium borate, 75mM NaCl, 0.25mM thimerosal) for 60 min. Plates were washed twice with ELISA wash buffer, and then blocked for 60 min with ELISA wash containing 5% non-fat dry milk (blocking reagent). Each well was washed twice and then recombinant tau samples were added to each well for 90 min. Recombinant hT40 and S422E tau monomers or aggregates from the\nin vitro\npolymerization assays were diluted with polymerization buffer to a final concentration of 5nM (Tau5 and TNT1 assays) or 20nM (TOC1 assay). Titer assays were performed for each capture antibody sandwich ELISA to ensure recombinant tau protein concentrations produced signal within the linear range. Wells were rinsed 3 times with ELISA wash and then incubated for 90 min with the rabbit polyclonal pan-tau antibody R1 (\nBerry et al., 2004\n) diluted 1:20,000 in blocking reagent, as the detection antibody. Wells were washed 3 times, and then incubated for 60 min with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Vector Labs, PI-1000) diluted in blocking reagent. Wells were washed 3 times, and assays were developed using 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Sigma) for 15 min (Tau5, TNT1) or 30 min (TOC1). Development reactions were stopped with 3.5% sulfuric acid and absorbance was read at 450nm on a SpectraMax Plus 384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The amount of total tau applied in the assay was known and equivalent between groups since these are recombinant protein samples, but absorbance (A) is not a linear measure (i.e., A=Log\n10\n(1/transmittance) and not useful for comparing across samples (e.g. A=0.3 is 50% light absorbed, A=1 is 90% light absorbed and A=2 is 99% light absorbed). Thus, the absorbance data were converted to percent light absorbed (a linear scale) using the following equation %A=(1\u201310\n-\nx\n)*100, where\nx\nis absorbance. The percent light absorbed data were used for statistical comparisons across groups.\nA similar protocol was used to measure the levels of PAD exposure and tau oligomers in pS422-containing tau species in the soluble tau fractions of the frontal cortex from control and AD brains (\nKanaan et al., 2016\n). Tau species containing pS422 protein were captured by coating ELISA microplates for 60 min with rabbit anti-pS422 antibody (Abcam, ab79415, diluted to 2\u03bcg/ml in borate saline). Plates were rinsed twice, blocked for 60 min with blocking reagent, and rinsed twice before samples were added to the well for 90 min. Human brain extracts were diluted to a final total protein concentration of 0.4 \u03bcg/\u03bcL (i.e., 20 \u03bcg/well). The optimal protein amount for the soluble tau fraction was determined by titering to ensure the ELISAs were performed within the linear rage of reactivity. Wells were rinsed twice, and then incubated for 90 min with Tau5 (0.005\u03bcg/ml), TNT1 (0.01\u03bcg/ml) or TOC1 (1\u03bcg/ml) as the detection antibodies (diluted in blocking reagent). Wells were rinsed 3 times and incubated for 90 min with horse anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Vector Labs, PI-2000) or goat anti-mouse IgM-specific conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson, 115-035-020) diluted (0.2\u03bcg/ml) in blocking reagent. The wells were rinsed 3 times, signal was detected by developing TMB for 6 min (TOC1) or 30 min (Tau5 and TNT1), and then the reaction was stopped using 3.5% sulfuric acid. Tau standard ELISAs were performed with human sample sandwich ELISAs to estimate the amount of tau captured by anti-pS422 and detected with Tau 5, TNT1 or TOC1. For the tau standards, a serial dilution of recombinant full-length human tau protein ranging from 100-3.13 ng was bound to the ELISA plate for 60 min, blocked as above, and detected using either Tau5, TNT1 or TOC1 antibodies and HRP-secondary antibodies exactly as in the recombinant protein sandwich ELISAs above. Each standard was run in duplicate and developed simultaneously with the sandwich ELISAs to ensure accurate interpolation of unknown tau amounts. The standard curve data were log\n10\ntransformed and best fit to a sigmoidal curve (r\n2\n=0.99 for all three). This provided a standard curve of absorbance values that were derived from Tau5, TNT1 or TOC1 reactivity with known amounts of tau protein. The quantity of tau (ng) in each human sample was interpolated from the tau standard curves and then converted to a concentration of ng/\u03bcL by dividing the interpolated quantity by the volume of the sample used (i.e., 50\u03bcL). Finally, the data (i.e., concentrations of tau) were normalized to reduce skewness using logarithmic transformations and then used for statistical comparisons.\n\nImmunoblotting\nMonomeric and aggregated tau samples were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer (20mM Tris pH 6.8, 6% glycerol (v/v). 1.6% sodium dodecyl sulfate (v/v), 0.85% 2-mercaptoethanol (v/v), 0.002% bromophenol blue (v/v)), incubated at 90\u00b0C for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE using 4-20% Criterion TGX precast gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., 5671094) and transferred to 0.22 \u03bcm nitrocellulose membranes (Pall Corporation, 66485). Membranes were blocked with 2% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50mM Tris, 150mM NaCl, pH 7.4), and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in Tau13 antibody (1:50,000), a mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody against the N-terminus of tau (\nGarc\u00eda-Sierra et al., 2003\n). Membranes were rinsed four times in TBS + 0.1% Tween 20, and developed with the affinity-purified secondary antibody conjugated to IRDye 680RD goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (LiCor, 925-68070). Image acquisition and intensity measurements were performed using a LiCor Odyssey system.\n\nSquid axoplasm motility assay\nFAT was evaluated in freshly extruded squid axoplasm from giant squid axon (\nLoligo pealii\n; Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA) as previously described (\nBrady et al., 1993\n;\nMorfini et al., 2007\n;\nSong et al., 2016\n). Tau protein (monomer or aggregate) was diluted in X/2 buffer (175 mM potassium aspartate, 65 mM taurine, 35 mM betaine, 25 mM glycine, 10 mM HEPES, 6.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 5 mM EGTA, 1.5 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.5mM glucose, 10mM adenosine triphosphate, pH 7.2) and perfused into isolated axoplasm at a final concentration of 2 \u03bcM. The tau protein concentration of 2 \u03bcM was chosen specifically because it is within the physiological range of tau in the brain (\nAlonso et al., 1996\n;\nKing et al., 1999\n). Motility was analyzed using a Zeiss Axiomat microscope equipped with a 100\u00d7 (1.3 numerical aperture) objective and differential interference contrast optics. Images were obtained using a Hammamatsu C2400 CCD with an Argus 20 for image adjustment and the video was further processed using a Hamamatsu Photonics Microscopy C2117 video manipulator for generation of calibrated cursors and scale bars (\nSong et al., 2016\n). Anterograde and retrograde FAT were measured by matching calibrated cursor movements to the speed of vesicles moving in the axoplasm preparation. Vesicle motility was measured for 50 min after perfusion and data were plotted as a function of time. Full-length hT40 monomer was used as the control group since no changes are observed for this experimental group when compared to buffer control-perfused axoplasms (\nLaPointe et al., 2009b\n;\nMorfini et al., 2007\n). Two comparisons were made between groups: i) the average velocity of transport over the last 20 min of the assay was compared to measure the extent of inhibition across treatment groups, and ii) the rate of change in transport velocity over the entire 50 min assay was evaluated by comparing the slope of the linear regression curve fit for each group.\n\nTriple-Label Immunofluorescence (IF) for Confocal Microscopy\nTriple-label IF was used to characterize co-localization between tau phosphorylated at S422, PAD exposed tau and oligomeric tau. Tissue sections from age-matched, non-demented controls (n=6; age: mean=81 yrs, range=73-91 yrs; sex: 1 female, 5 males; Braak stage I-III) and severe AD cases (n=6; age: mean=83, range=60-92 yrs; sex: 4 female, 2 males; Braak stage V-VI) were processed for triple-label IF using the TNT1 (mouse IgG1), TOC1 (mouse IgM) and pS422 (rabbit) antibodies according to published methods (\nKanaan et al., 2016\n). The sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C in a primary antibody solution containing TNT1 (1:30,000), TOC1 (1:2,000) and pS422 (1:1,000) antibodies followed by incubation in a secondary antibody solution of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG1-specific (Invitrogen, A-21121), Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgM-specific (Invitrogen, A-21043), and Alexa Fluor 405 goat anti-rabbit specific (Invitrogen, A-31556) antibodies (all diluted 1:500) for 2 hours. Following the staining procedure, sections were mounted on microscope slides, autofluorescence was blocked using sudan black as described (\nKanaan et al., 2012\n;\n2011\n;\n2007\n), and coverslipped using hardset Vectashield mounting media. Control sections with one of the three primary antibodies omitted confirmed that each secondary label was specific to the appropriate primary antibody (i.e., no staining was observed with the fluorophore for the omitted antibody; data not shown). A Nikon A1+ laser scanning confocal microscope system equipped with solid-state lasers (488, 561, and 640) and Nikon Elements AR software were used to acquire image z-stacks (0.5\u03bcm step size), and the images (maximum intensity projections) were prepared for publication using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.\n\nStatistics\nAll experiments were repeated at least three times (see figure legends). All experiments were analyzed by Student's t-test or two-way analysis of variance as indicated in figure legends. When overall significance was achieved, the Holm-Sidak post-hoc test was used to make all possible comparisons. Data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. All tests were two-tailed, and significance was set at\np\n\u2264 0.05. GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for all statistical tests."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experiments were performed on male Sprague Dawley albino rats (280-350g; Harlan Labs, Frederick, MD). A total of 12 rats were used for these experiments; 2 rats failed to kindle and two rats were excluded due to misplaced virus (one in hippocampus, one in the reticular thalamus). The animals were housed in the Georgetown University Division of Comparative Medicine under environmentally controlled conditions (12 hr light/dark cycle, lights on between 6:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M.; ambient temperature 23\u00b0C \u00b1 1\u00b0C) with food (Lab Diet, #5001) and water provided\nab libitum\n. All experiments were performed during light phase of the cycle. Experimental procedures were performed in compliance with Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care standards and were approved by the Georgetown University Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nSurgery\nRats were anesthetized with 2.8 mg/kg, i.p., equithesin (a combination of sodium pentobarbital, chloral hydrate, ethanol, and magnesium sulfate) (Sigma, St Louis, MO) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf, Tujunga, CA). Rats were injected bilaterally with 1.5 uL of adenoassociated virus [rAAV8-hsyn-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry from the UNC Vector Core, Chapel Hill, NC, 7.4\u00d710\n12\ninfectious particles per ml]. Virus was delivered using a 30-gauge dental needle connected via tubing to a Hamilton syringe (Sigma Aldrich). Infusions were controlled by a syringe pump (New Era, Farmingdale, NY) set to deliver virus at a rate of 0.2 uL/min. Virus was injected into the midline thalamus [AP -2.3, ML \u00b10.5, DV -5.8 below dura, skull plane flat] (\nPaxinos and Watson, 2007\n). The injection needle was left in place for at least 5 minutes after the completion of infusion to allow for viral diffusion and avoid reflux up the needle track. A twisted pair of stainless steel electrodes (Plastics One) was then implanted into the basolateral amygdala [AP -0.2, ML +4.9, DV -8.0, incisor bar +5mm (\nPellegrino and Cushman, 1967\n)] and fixed to the skull with dental acrylic and stainless steel jeweler's screws. The efficacy of DREADD-mediating silencing of the mediodorsal thalamus has been previously demonstrated, both behaviorally and electrophysiologically (\nParnaudeau et al., 2015\n,\n2013\n), providing increased confidence in this approach.\n\nDrugs\nClozapine-N-Oxide (CNO) (RTI; NIMH Chemical Synthesis Program, Washington, DC) was dissolved at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL in 5% Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) in normal saline (Sigma-Aldrich). CNO was administered in the following doses: 1, 2.5, 5.0, and 10 mg/kg, i.p.. An equal (matched) volume of vehicle (saline with 5% DMSO) was given for each dose of CNO on a separate test day.\n\nAfterdischarge Threshold (ADT) Determination\nAfter one week of postoperative recovery to allow seizure threshold to normalize (\nForcelli et al., 2013\n), each animal's ADT was determined. ADT was defined as the minimum current intensity to evoke spiking that outlasted stimulation by 10 sec. Kindling stimulation was provided by a Grass Model S88 stimulator (Grass Technologies, Middleton, WI) connected to an A-M Systems constant current stimulus isolator (A-M Systems, Sequim, WA). The stimulation parameters were set to a 1 sec pulse train of 60 Hz monophasic square wave pulses with a 1.0 msec pulse width. ADT determination began with delivery of 10 uA current intensity, which was elevated every 1 min until afterdischarge threshold was determined. Electrographic responses were collected via a kindling preamplifier with a solid-state relay to switch between record and stimulate modes (Pinnacle Technologies, Lawrence, KS). Signals were amplified 500\u00d7 and then digitized at a 1KHz sampling rate (PowerLab, AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO). Data were bandpass filtered (0.1Hz to 30Hz) and stored for offline analysis using LabChart Pro software (AD Instruments).\n\nAmygdala Kindling\nEach animal was stimulated daily at the determined ADT until five, Racine Stage 5 seizures were observed. Seizures were scored as follows: Stage 1 = facial clonus, Stage 2 = head bobbing, Stage 3 = forelimb clonus, Stage 4 = forelimb clonus + rearing, Stage 5 = forelimb clonus, rearing + loss of balance (\nRacine, 1972\n). After animals were fully kindled (average of 19.4 simulations, ranging between 14-24 stimulations; 3 to 4.5 weeks after surgery), a post-kindling ADT was determined (as above) before dosing commenced. This post-surgical interval prior to testing is consistent with our prior experience using AAV-mediated expression under the hSyn promoter in rats (\nSoper et al., 2016\n). It is likewise consistent with prior studies using DREADDs for seizure control (\nK\u00e4tzel et al., 2014\n) in the neocortex and for the manipulation of the mediodorsal thalamus in behavioral studies (\nParnaudeau et al., 2015\n,\n2013\n).\nOnce animals are fully kindled, seizure responses are highly stable for months after the last stimulation (\nGoddard et al., 1969\n). In the present study, all animals displayed stable Stage 5 seizures across four separate vehicle-treated experimental sessions, which were interspersed between each drug-treated sessions.\n\nCNO testing\nDoses were administered in the following order: 5, 2.5, 1 and 10 mg/kg, which was held constant across animals. The order of testing was counterbalanced between vehicle and CNO first. A minimum of 24 h elapsed between tests. After CNO administration, rats were placed in an observation cage for 30 minutes and then stimulated at the post-kindling ADT; this interval between drug treatment and testing is consistent with that employed by K\u00e4tzel et al for seizure control in neocortex and Parnaudeau et al for cognitive testing after thalamic manipulations (\nK\u00e4tzel et al., 2014\n;\nParnaudeau et al., 2015\n,\n2013\n). Once tested at all doses, rats were given a fixed dose of 5.0 mg/kg and placed in an observation cage for 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 40 minutes before being stimulated, to determine a time course of drug action.\n\nControl animals\nTo control for non-specific effects of CNO, we prepared animals with a control (non-DREADD) vector, kindled them as above, and tested them with the highest dose of CNO (10 mg/kg) used in this study. The highest dose was selected as the most rigorous test of possible non-specific effects.\n\nAnalysis of electrographic seizure activity in amygdala\nEEGs were analyzed by two observers (EW and PAF), one of whom (PAF) was blinded to treatment. There was a high correlation between the two observers (R\n2\n=0.77). The data presented in the manuscript are the result of the observations of the blinded observer. Electrographic seizure duration was measured offline from the onset of stimulation to the end of regular spiking/return to baseline EEG rhythm. In addition, the presence or absence of the following electrographic features was recorded: fast ictal pattern, isolated spike-and-wave pattern, polyspike activity, and secondary afterdischarges.\n\nSpontaneous Alternation in the Y-Maze\nAs a measure of attentional/memory function, we assessed spontaneous alternation in the Y Maze. The Y maze consisted of a center hexagonal arena (Coulbourn Instruments, Whitehall, PA) with two arms of equal length (35 cm) and a shorter start arm (15 cm). During baseline [drug-free] testing, rats were placed in the start arm for 30 seconds. A guillotine door was then opened and the rat was allowed to enter into the center arena and the door was then closed. The animal was allowed to freely explore the Y-maze for 7 min while entries into the arms were recorded by an observer and/or by ANYmaze software (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). The following two days, animals were given either 5.0 mg/kg CNO or vehicle i.p. and placed in an observation cage for 25 minutes before being placed in start arm to begin the task. CNO and vehicle conditions were counterbalanced and testing was done post-kindling.\n\nHistology\nOnce testing was complete, rats were deeply anesthetized with equithesin and perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and cryoprotected in a 30% sucrose solution. Brains were sectioned (40 \u03bcm) on a Reichert 975C cryostat and stored in -20\u00b0C until histochemical processing. Injection sites and viral spread were verified by immunohistochemistry and/or by endogenous florescence of the mCherry reporter. Electrode placement was determined in the same thionin-counterstained sections.\nSlides were washed, quenched (10% hydrogen peroxide in methanol) and blocked (3% Normal Goat Serum, 2% Bovine serum albumin, 0.2% non-fat milk, 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate buffered saline). Slides were then incubated for up to 24 hours with primary antibody (1:2500, rabbit anti-dsRED, Clutch, Mountain View, CA) at 4\u00b0C and then incubated for 60 min with secondary antibody (1:500 biotinylated goat anti-rabbit, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at room temperature. Slides were washed and placed in dark with ABC reagents, prepared according to Vectastain protocol. 3,3\u2032-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was dissolved in tris buffered saline at a concentration of 0.25 mg/ml. Slides were placed in DAB for 5 min. 7.5 uL of 30% hydrogen peroxide was then added. Slides were removed from mix and washed after about 1.5 min. Slides were rehydrated, counterstained with thionin stain, dehydrated, and left in xylenes before being coverslipped with Cytoseal-60. For endogenous mCherry visualization, slides were washed 3 \u00d7 5 min in tris buffered saline followed by counterstaining with DAPI (200 ng/ml in tris buffered saline). Slides were coverslipped with FluoroGel and sealed with clear coat nail polish.\nThe region of thalamus labeled by mCherry immunohistochemistry was hand-drawn onto planes from the atlas of Paxinos and Watson and digitized using Adobe Photoshop CC 2015 to indicate minimum, maximum and average virus coverage across cases.\n\nStatistical and Data analysis\nData were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 6 (GraphPad Inc., La Jolla, CA). Seizure scores are non-parametric, and were thus analyzed using Freidman's test with Dunn's multiple comparison test. Seizure scores for time courses were analyzed using the Skillings-Mack test implementation in Stata SE with Bonferroni-Holm's corrected Wilcoxon tests used for post-hoc comparison. Because under baseline conditions, all animals displayed a maximum response, precluding an increase in seizure severity, a one-tailed directional hypothesis was used. Seizure duration was analyzed by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Holm-Sidak's multiple comparison test. Spontaneous alternation data were analyzed using a one-sample t-test against chance performance (0.5) and ANOVA to compare across groups. Inter-rater reliability for electrographic seizure duration was measured by linear correlation (Pearson's R). Proportion of traces showing specific electrographic patterns was analyzed using Chi-Squared test. P values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nPatient assessment and diagnostic classification\nPatients with neuropathies of different etiologies were recruited at the Department of Neurology, University of W\u00fcrzburg between 2014 and 2015, where they underwent diagnostic work-up, including sural nerve biopsy. The study was approved by the W\u00fcrzburg Medical Faculty Ethics Committee and written informed consent was obtained from every study participant before recruitment. The diagnosis of neuropathy was based on characteristic symptoms and signs in the neurological examination and typical findings in the electrophysiological assessment with standard nerve conduction studies in motor and sensory nerves of the upper and lower limbs (\nKimura, 2001\n). Motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and evoked compound muscle action potential of the median, tibial and peroneal nerves were measured orthodromically. Sensory conduction velocity and amplitude of the nerve action potential were measured antidromically in the median and sural nerves. Skin temperature in both upper and lower extremities was controlled (> 32\u00b0C) during the examinations. For differential diagnosis detailed laboratory studies included: glucose metabolism (HbA1c, oral glucose tolerance test), whole blood and differential cell counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, serum electrolytes, monoclonal immunoglobulins, vitamin levels (B6, B12), folic acid, renal and liver function tests, thyroid function tests, anti-nuclear antigen (ENA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA), rheumatoid factor, serology of borreliosis, immunofixation, and serum electrophoresis. In addition, all patients submitted to a diagnostic lumbar puncture, and cerebrospinal fluid was checked for pathological cell counts and protein levels. Diagnostic subgroups and definition of neuropathies are summarized in supplemental patient diagnostic criteria.\nAll patients were specifically asked for details regarding symptoms and signs that may have been associated with other sources of pain, any patient reporting other sources of pain or ongoing infection was excluded. Neuropathies were classified as painful if the patients reported pain with an intensity of 3 or more on a numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 to 10 (0 meaning \u201cno pain\u201d and 10 \u201cworst pain imaginable\u201d), as previously reported (\n\u00dc\u00e7eyler et al., 2015\n;\n\u00dc\u00e7eyler et al., 2007\n). The Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS) (\nVon Korff et al., 1992\n) for 4 week recall and the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) (\nBouhassira et al., 2004\n) for the last 24 h recall were also used to assess pain. The control group consisted of healthy and age-and sex-matched (to the neuropathy patients shown in\nFig. 1A\n) volunteers without infectious disease or pain at study inclusion.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nmiR-132-3p gene expression in patients with polyneuropathies. A) Bar graph indicates that miR-132-3p expression was higher in white blood cells of patients with polyneuropathy of different etiologies compared to controls (n=30/group). Data represents relative miR-132-3p expression normalized to controls. ***p < 0.001 B) Gene expression of miR-132-3p was also higher in patients with painful neuropathies (n=25) compared to patients with painless neuropathies (n=23;). C) Pain was associated with higher miR-132-3p expression in inflammatory and non-inflammatory neuropathies, when sub-grouped based on the diagnosis. Y-axis in panels B & C are in arbitrary units. Data are expressed as median values with upper and lower 25% percentiles indicated; Mann Whitney U-comparisons; ***p<0.001, *p<0.05.\nBlood withdrawal for miRNA expression analysis\nTo reduce circadian variations, venous blood was collected from 30/81 patients and 30 healthy controls between 8:00 and 9:00 AM. For quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR), 9 ml whole blood was withdrawn in EDTA-containing tubes and the total white blood cell fraction (WBC) isolated. Isolated WBCs were re-suspended in RNA-cell protective reagent (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing.\nSural nerve biopsy\nDiagnostic sural nerve biopsy was performed in 67/81 patients at the Department of Neurosurgery, University of W\u00fcrzburg (\nDyck et al., 2005\n). For miRNA expression analysis, approximately 4 mm of the biopsy specimen was separated and stored in RNA-later overnight at 4\u00b0C; on the following day RNA-later was removed and the specimen was frozen at \u221280\u00b0C.\nPCR amplification of miRNA\nPeripheral nerve specimens as the basis of major pathology were obtained from patients and rats. Isolation of miRNAs was performed on all samples (WBCs, nerve, DRGs and spinal cord) using the miRNEASY kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For the generation of miRNA-specific first strand cDNA, 5 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the Universal cDNA Synthesis kit II (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark) following manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. For each reaction, 4 \u03bcl of diluted (1:80) cDNA was PCR amplified applying the corresponding miRNA and reference primer sets, using the miCURY LNA\n\u2122\nUniversal microRNA PCR (Exiqon). The expression levels of miR-132-3p (5\u2032-3\u2032 UAACAGUCUACAGCCAUGGUCG, MIMAT0000426) and its splice variant miR-132-5p (5\u2032-3\u2032 ACCGUGGCUUUCGAUUGUUACU, MIMAT0004594) were normalized to the expression of endogenous 5s RNA (5s RNA,\nV00589\n). For individual target normalization, we tested different endogenous controls (U6, snord48, snord44, and 5sRNA) of which 5sRNA (housekeeping gene) was the most stable and thus, was used for both human and rat tissue. Each miRNA was amplified in triplicate and threshold cycle (Ct) values were obtained. Fold changes in miRNA expression among groups were calculated using interplate calibrators (a standard sample that was run on each PCR plate) by means of the delta-delta Ct method.\nmiRNA target validation\nWe set out to analyze the role of AMPA-receptor subunit GluA1, in an animal model of neuropathic pain. We performed a comprehensive target prediction analysis of miR-132-3p by employing four databases: TargetScan (\nFriedman et al., 2009\n), microRNA.org (\nBetel et al., 2008\n), miRTarBase (\nHsu et al., 2011\n), and DIANAmicroT (\nParaskevopoulou et al., 2013\n). GluA1 was identified as a potential downstream target by at least two of the four prediction algorithms. To further narrow down the numerous miRNA downstream candidates we performed an additional Blastn alignment search (\nAltschul et al., 1990\n) of GluA1 (\nNM_031608.1\n) to specifically check for putative binding sites of miR-132-3p in the GluA1 gene.\nAnimals\nAdult male Holtzman rats (250\u2013300 g, Harlan Industries, Indianapolis, USA) were used. Animals were fed\nad libitum\nand maintained in a controlled temperature and humidity environment, under a 12 h light/dark cycle. Animals recovered from shipping for a minimum of 2 days before entering the study; on the day of the experiment, animals were allowed to acclimate to the laboratory and test equipment for at least 1 h. All procedures were performed during the light cycle. Experiments were in compliance with the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, San Diego, approved all animal protocols.\nIntrathecal catheterization and spared nerve injury (SNI)\nNa\u00efve rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction-, 2.5% maintenance) in a 50% O\n2\n/room air mixture. Polyethylene (PE-5, 8.5 cm, Scientific Commodities Inc., AZ, USA) catheters were implanted intrathecally under aseptic conditions, as described elsewhere (\nMalkmus and Yaksh, 2004\n). The catheter tip ended over the L4 spinal segment. Immediately after implantation, SNI or a sham surgery was performed, according to the method of Decosterd and Woolf (\nDecosterd and Woolf, 2000\n). Briefly, skin on the lateral surface of the left thigh was incised and a blunt dissection made directly through the biceps femoris muscle, thereby exposing the sciatic nerve. Distal to the trifurcation of its branches, the common peroneal and the tibial nerves were tightly ligated, using 5.0 silk and a 2\u20134 mm piece of each distal nerve stump was removed; the sural nerve was untouched. Incisions were closed with muscle and skin sutures. In sham surgery, the sciatic nerve branches were exposed, but not otherwise harmed. All rats received subcutaneous lactated Ringer\u2019s solution (1 cc/50 g body weight, Baxter HealthCare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, USA) with carprofen (5 mg/kg, Rimadyl Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA) immediately post-surgery and were housed individually. Behavioral experiments were conducted 5\u201321 days after surgery. Rats that displayed behavioral or motor deficits or loss of cannula patency were excluded from the study (less than 1%).\nBehavioral paradigm and testing\nBehavioral testing was conducted between 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM by an experimenter blinded to treatment group. Mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds were determined prior to i.t. drug delivery (baseline, day 0) and at designated time points after unilateral SNI of the left hind limb (days 5, 10, 14, 18, 20). In one small subset of animals (3\u20134/group), days 11, 12, 13 and 21 were added.\nNociceptive threshold testing\nRats were placed on an elevated mesh floor in individual test chambers. Withdrawal thresholds to punctate mechanical stimuli were determined using calibrated von Frey filaments (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA) and the \u201cup-down\u201d method as described previously (\nChaplan et al., 1994\n). Latencies to thermal stimulation were determined using a modified Hargreaves system (UCSD University Anesthesia Research and Development Group, CA, USA) (\nDirig et al., 1997\n). After 45 min of adaptation on a glass plate, a radiant heat stimulus was delivered to each individual paw and withdrawal latency was recorded. Each hindpaw was tested 3 times and the average of all 6 tests was used as the animal mean. To prevent tissue damage by the heat, we used a stimulus cut-off time of 20 s.\nPlace escape avoidance paradigm (PEAP)\nTo test the aversive aspect of pain the place escape avoidance paradigm (PEAP) was employed (\nFuchs and McNabb, 2012\n). Rats were allowed unrestricted movement within a box (40.6 \u00d7 15.9 \u00d7 30.5 cm Plexiglas) one end of which was opaque black (sides and the top of the dark area) and the other end semi-translucent white (sides and top-light area). The animals were placed in the light area at the start of each test session. Mechanical stimulation with a suprathreshold von Frey monofilament (255 mN; 26 g) was applied at 15 s intervals to the sural nerve receptive field on the plantar paw. When the animal was on the dark side of the box, the left (i.e. injured) paw was stimulated and when the animal was in the light area, the right (i.e. uninjured) paw was stimulated. The location of the animal at the time of stimulus presentation was noted over the entire test period of 35 min. The percentage of stimuli applied to each foot was calculated and interpreted as time spent on each side of the test chamber.\nMiRNA inhibitor and mimetic\nA locked-nucleic acid (LNA) based\nin vivo\ninhibitor for miR-132-3p and a mismatch control (scrambled oligonucleotide, Scr) were purchased from Exiqon (Vedbaek, Denmark). Sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows: miR-132-3p (5\u2032-3\u2032 ATGGCTGTAGACTGTT) and Scr (5\u2032-3\u2032 ACGTCTATACGCCCA). A miRIDIAN microRNA mimetic for miR-132-3p (C-320363-03-0002) (Dharmacon, GE Healthcare Europe, Freiburg, Germany) was custom-modified with a 3\u2032-cholesterol conjugation on the passenger strand to facilitate its\nin vivo\nuptake. Both inhibitor and mimetics were synthesized from ribonucleotides and their functional efficacy was tested\nin vivo\n. Both oligonucleotides were purified via HPLC and the lyophilized powder was reconstituted in 1x PBS at pH 7.4 at concentrations of 1 mM and stored in aliquots at \u221220\u00b0C to avoid freeze-thaw cycles.\nThe inhibitor and mimetic were administered to awake rats via the i.t. catheters. Prior to injection, active or mismatch inhibitors were mixed with (1:5 w/v) i-Fect\n\u2122\nin vivo transfection reagent (Neuromics, Edina, USA) to final doses of 5, 2 and 1 \u03bcg in 10 \u03bcl. Bolus injections were performed every 24 h for 3 consecutive days starting on day 10 after SNI or sham surgery. The mimetic was mixed with i-Fect\n\u2122\n(1:5 w/v) to final doses of 8, 5, 3 and 1 \u03bcg and the injection sequence to na\u00efve animals followed the same pattern as that for the antagonist. Each drug was mixed with sterile saline at pH 7.4 to achieve the desired dilution. Each injection was followed by a 10 \u03bcl saline flush.\nImmunohistochemistry\nRats, that had been injected with mimetic or the Scr control, were deeply anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and perfused with room temperature saline, followed by cold (4 \u00b0C) 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The lumbar enlargement, and L4 and L5 DRGs were harvested and post-fixed for 4 h; tissue was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PBS. Fixed tissue was embedded in O.C.T. compound (Tissue-Tek, Torrance, CA, USA) and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. Transverse DRG and spinal cord sections (10 \u03bcm) were cut on a Leica CM 1800 cryostat. Spinal cord sections were mounted and labeled with goat anti-Iba1 (microglia, 1:750, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, astrocytes, 1:500; Millipore Temecula, CA, USA) and goat-anti MAC387 (MAC387, macrophages, 1:250, Thermo Fischer, Rockford, IL, USA), to check for signs of glial activation in the spinal cord dorsal horn and infiltration of peripheral macrophages at the injection site (catheter tip). The DRGs were stained with rabbit anti-activation transcription factor 3 (ATF3, 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Binding sites were visualized with species matched goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (both at 1:500, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Control sections had the primary antibody omitted. Images were acquired with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal system (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany); z-stacks were obtained and images processed with LAS AF software (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). All reported findings were observed in multiple sections in at least 3 animals per condition.\nWestern blot analysis for AMPA receptor subunits\nRats were deeply anesthetized and perfused with room temperature saline. Spinal cords were harvested and the dorsal half of the lumbar enlargement dissected. Tissue was immediately frozen in extraction lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 nM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 3% SDS). Protein concentrations were determined and Western blot analysis performed. Samples were loaded on a Nu-Page 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in MOPS running buffer and transferred onto a single nitrocellulose membrane. Antibodies against the pAKT (ser473, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) and GluA1- and GluA2- AMPA receptor subunits were from rabbit (1:1000, Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA). Beta-actin was used as a loading control (Sigma, St. Louis, USA). The membrane was stripped following each analysis. Immunoblots were scanned and a densitometric analysis performed using ImageJ software (U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).\nStatistical analysis\nGraph Pad Prism 4.0 (GPP 4.0, GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for statistical analyses and graphs. Data distribution was tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test and by visual inspection of data histograms. For non-normally distributed values of the human qRT-PCR results, data were expressed as medians and quartiles and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test Spearman\u2019s rho were used for analysis. Descriptive patient data were reported as median and range (minimum to maximum value). All other data were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc testing were used to assess statistical significance in behavioral experiments. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc testing was performed for rat qRT-PCR data, place-escape avoidance and the Hargreaves test. Student\u2019s t-tests were performed for reporter assays and Western-blot data. Statistical significance was accepted with p<0.05."

    "Methods": "We utilized the cre-loxP system to achieve late developmental stage and cell type-specific deletion of the shh receptor, smo, in DA neurons by crossing DATcre (dopamine transporter) mice with SmoloxP/loxPmice. We assessed for differences between knockout (ko) and wildtype (wt) mice using combined histochemistry, gene expression analysis, and behavioral evaluation. Number and size of DA neurons in ventral midbrain and the DA neural terminal density in striatum were measured using unbiased stereological quantification. The survival of DA neurons under neurotoxin challenge was examined in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) Parkinson's disease animal model and the more subtle function under challenge of the dopaminergic system was examined by methamphetamine single- and repeated challenge in wt and ko mice."

    "Methods": "Nomenclature and classifications\nIn this paper we investigate the transcriptional status of many of the genes involved in CMT and pain disorders. As such the focus is on the genes and their expression levels. More details on the clinical classification and the various symptoms resulting from their mutation can be found in several recent reviews (\nRossor et al., 2013\n) and in the OMIM database (\nhttp://omim.org/\n). For pain channelopathies, we include not only loss of function mutations leading to neuropathy, but gain of function leading to overactivation of primary sensory neurons leading to pain syndromes of varying severity (\nDrenth and Waxman, 2007\n;\nYang et al., 2004\n). In many cases, loss or overactivation of these ion channels is responsible for diminished or enhanced pain sensation (\nBoukalova et al., 2014\n;\nCox et al., 2006\n;\nDrenth and Waxman, 2007\n;\nHisama et al., 1993\n;\nLeipold et al., 2013\n;\nPark et al., 2007\n;\nYang et al., 2004\n).\n\nTissue preparation and RNA purification\nAll procedures were approved by the NIH Animal Care and Use Committee. Rats were housed in pairs and given access to food and water\nad libitum\n. To obtain DRG and sciatic nerve, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane, decapitated and dissected immediately. L4 and L5 DRGs were removed after laminectomy and sciatic nerves were dissected starting from just distal to the sciatic notch and extending to just above the sciatic trifurcation. Tissues were frozen immediately on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until processed. Human L3 DRGs (N=4) were purchased from Anabios (San Diego, CA). Samples were homogenized in 1 mL Qiazol reagent (Qiagen Inc, Valencia CA) using a Fastprep 24 homogenizer (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) and purified using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia CA) with added DNase digestion. RNA integrity was assessed after gel electrophoresis using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Samples with an RNA integrity number above 8.5 were sequenced, except for human DRG samples from Anabios, which were sequenced if they were above a RIN of 7.0.\n\nNext-gen sequencing and genomic mapping\nThe TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with Biomek liquid handling automation (Beckman Coulter, Pasadena, CA) was used to perform cDNA synthesis and adaptor ligation. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2500 instrument at 2\u00d7100 bp read length using v4 chemistry according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Default quality trimming was performed with removal of reads that fall below CASAVA\u2019s (Illumina) passing filter. Subsequently, reads were trimmed to 75bp and used to generate demultiplexed FASTQ files.\nReads were aligned to the genome using RNA-Seq Unified Mapper (RUM v 2.0.5) and the rn5 rat genome assembly (including the mitochondrial genome) or hg19 human genome assembly. Mapped reads were assembled using gene models from RefSeq and Ensembl. The transcript accounting for the most unique mapped reads was selected to represent gene expression, with preference given to RefSeq models for genes where both RefSeq and Ensembl models are established. Raw count and RPKM values were extracted from standard RUM output files as well as from previously published datasets (\nConsortium, 2013\n;\nGoswami et al., 2014a\n;\nGoswami et al., 2014b\n). Raw counts were used to calculate differential expression between rat DRG and sciatic nerve using a negative bionomial test within the bioinformatics tool DESeq from Bioconductor (\nAnders and Huber, 2010\n). A set of mostly muscle-specific transcripts was evident in a single sample of DRG (1 out of 8) and were excluded from further analyses (\nSupplementary Fig S1\n).\n\nDatabases\nFor identification of mutant genes underlying the pain channelopathies and CMT neuropathies we examined the literature as well as the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database maintained by the NCBI. Heatmap data was generated by extracting FPKM values from the Human Protein Atlas RNA-Seq repository (\nUhlen et al., 2015\n). Datasets generated by the research in the present paper have been made available through the SRA database under project number PRJNA313202. Mouse TRPV1 lineage and non-TRPV1 lineage datasets were previously published in (\nGoswami et al., 2014a\n) and can be accessed under project number PRJNA308243.\n\nPrediction of peptidyl alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) substrates from sciatic nerve enriched genes\nProtein products of genes presented in\nFigure 5\nwere analyzed for C-terminal Gly residues based on Uniprot amino acid sequences containing signal peptides, indicating their presence within the secretory pathway. This search included mature C-terminals if a processing step was reported in Uniprot. Gly residues revealed after removal of C-terminal basic residues were also considered. Additionally, ProP 1.0 was used to predict putative furin-like cleavages that were predicted to expose C- terminal Gly residues for processing by PAM.\nFigure 5. Most abundant transcripts greater than >3 fold differentially expressed in sciatic nerve relative to DRG.\nOpen in a new tab\nTranscriptomics data were filtered for genes >3 fold differentially expressed in sciatic relative to DRG, and ordered by RPKM value. Genes >10 fold differentially expressed are marked with an asterisk. Given that Schwann cells and nerve tracks are a subset of DRG, very few genes are more than 3 fold differentially expressed in sciatic, and generally have a high SEM (error bars). DRG n =8, sciatic n = 4.\n\nHistology and immunohistochemistry\nDRGs and peripheral nerve were dissected as above, fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 6\u03bcm. Sections of DRG were stained immunohistochemically for neurofilament light chain (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, 1:100) to demonstrate axons and neuronal perikarya and for myelin protein zero (Aves Labs Inc., Tigard, OR, 1:1000) to stain Schwann cells and the axonal myelin sheath. After washing with PBS, primary antisera were detected with biotinlylated species-specific secondary antibodies and the Vector Labs Elite ABC kit according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions; colored product was developed with diaminobenzidine. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.\n\nStaining for Adipocytes\nThe RNA-Seq data indicated the presence of fat specific genes (\nFabp4, Lep, Adipoq\n) in the peripheral nerve, although the transcript signals were variable, with variance correlating strongly with each particular animal (\nFig. 5\n) indicating that some dissected nerves had more adipose tissue than others. Additional analysis revealed a subset of genes whose variance correlated with animal sample number, most likely contributed by genes enriched in adipocytes adhering to the nerve. To examine adipose distribution, several rat sciatic nerves were dissected starting below the sciatic notch and extending to below the trifurcation, where there are additional fat pads. Nerve samples were fixed by immersion in 4 % paraformaldehyde and then either (a) embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 6 \u03bcm and stained using Masson\u2019s trichrome or (b) processed as a whole mount and stained with 0.5% oil Red O in polyethylene glycol. Oil red stained nerves were destained in sequential washes of 100%, then 85% polyethylene glycol in PBS. Photomicrographs were obtained with an Olympus BX60 microscope and DP- 80 digital camera. Whole mounted tissue samples were photographed with a Zeiss Stemi 2000-C and a Nikon D5100 SLR.\n\nHeatmap analysis of CMT genes and DRG/sciatic nerve enriched genes\nUsing data mined from the GTEx (\nConsortium, 2013\n) and Human Protein Atlas (\nUhlen et al., 2015\n) databases, in conjunction with the datasets presented in this manuscript, we performed a comprehensive tissue distribution analysis for CMT genes (\nFig 10\n). Tissue expression was calculated as a % of the highest RPKM/FPKM value in any tissue across all datasets for each gene, and colored according to value to create a heatmap (\nFig 10\n). Because of technical differences in sequencing, analysis and units, a demarcation is shown between the data from each of datasets and species. For each gene, division into subgroups was based on a two-pass approach. In the first filter, genes were selected for expression in CMT target tissue vs. all others by creating a filter requiring 90% of maximum expression in at least one CMT target tissue (first 6 columns,\nFig 10\n). The resulting two groups (Strongly enriched genes, and a second group) were each sorted by an enrichment score, calculated as the maximum value in any CMT target tissue divided by the average expression in non-CMT target tissues, multiplied by the max expression in a non-CMT target tissue. Genes which did not show at least 90% max expression in a CMT target tissue were further subdivided into genes with a pattern of enrichment in one or more tissues other than the DRG or sciatic, or those that are broadly expressed. All three groups are plotted on the heatmap, sorted by enrichment score calculated based on the average normalized value, and enrichment in any of the six target neuropathy tissues. To create a heatmap of highly enriched genes in DRG or sciatic nerve (\nFig 11\n), a similar approach was taken, plotting DRG and sciatic nerve from rat compared with the 32 tissues from the Human Protein Atlas. After normalization, genes were selected with less than 200% of the max expression in the DRG in all 32 tissues from the protein atlas dataset combined. For sciatic nerve, genes were selected with total gene expression in the 32 protein atlas tissues, totaling less than 400% of the max expression in sciatic nerve. Resulting gene lists were sorted by maximum RPKM/FPKM in any tissue examined, and the top 35 genes in each category are shown (\nFig 11\n). Complete lists are represented in\nSupplementary Figures 4 and 5\nfor DRG and sciatic nerve, respectively.\nFigure 10. Heatmap of CMT neuropathy and pain channelopathy gene expression levels across neural and non-neural tissues.\nOpen in a new tab\nCMT and neuropathy genes were normalized to a % of maximum expression and colored according to numeric value. Sorting of the matrix was performed by segregating values into several classes. Genes in the top group are most highly expressed in DRG, neurons, or nerve/Schwann cell-containing tissues (first six columns), while genes in the lower two groups have higher level of expression in at least one tissue. The remaining genes were divided into homogeneous (middle) or punctate (bottom) levels of expression. All three groups were sorted for enrichment in first six columns.\nFigure 11. Heatmap of DRG and sciatic nerve enriched genes.\nOpen in a new tab\nGenes strongly differential between DRG and sciatic were additionally probed for enrichment relative to 32 tissues present in the Human Protein Atlas. These genes were normalized to a % of maximum expression in any tissue and colored according to numeric value. Genes that are strongly enriched in DRG or sciatic relative to a broad complement of tissues are likely to be molecular signatures of this tissue. Genes are sorted by maximum expression (RPKM/FPKM) in any of the 34 tissues. Several CMT genes (NEFL, KIF5A in DRG and MPZ, PMP22 and PRX in sciatic) are among the most highly differential genes in DRG or sciatic. Both DRG and sciatic show enhanced similarity to the cerebral cortex, the only brain tissue presented in the Atlas data"

    "Methods": "2.1. Mice and induction of MOG-EAE\nAll experiments were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Care and Animal Use Committee at the University of California San Francisco. For these studies, we used 10-week old, C57BL/6 female mice. EAE was induced following the protocol supplied by Hooke Laboratory (Hooke Kit\u2122 MOG35-55/CFA Emulsion PTX; #EK-2110). Control females received the same dose of Pertussis toxin (PTX), Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) or a PTX/CFA combination, but no MOG pep-tide. The mice were weighed, examined and scored daily for disease. Neurological deficits were graded on a 5 point scale (0 = No clinical symptoms; 1.0 = Tail paralysis; 2.0 = Unsteady gait; 3.0 = Complete hindlimb paralysis; 4.0 = Complete hindlimb and partial forelimb paralysis; 5.0 = Moribund). At least 3 mice per group were killed at the following stages: 5, 7 and 9 days post-MOG injection (for pre-onset analyses), one day before onset (identified by loss of 1 g), at onset (score 0\u20131), during disease progression (score 2) and at peak EAE (score 4). Three control females were killed at 5 and 3 at 15 days after adjuvant/vehicle injection.\n\n2.2. Antibodies and immunohistochemistry\nAnimals were anesthetized with Avertin (250 mg/kg; 2, 2, 2-Tribromoethanol, Sigma) and then perfused transcardially with 10 ml phosphate buffer (PB: 0.1 M, pH 7.4) followed by 10 ml of 10% formalin (3.7% formaldehyde, Fisher Scientific) in PB at room temperature (RT). Tissues were dissected out and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose PB over-night at 4\u00b0C (with no post-fixation). Fourteen \u03bcm DRG/TG, 25 \u03bcm spinal cord and 35 \u03bcm brainstem cryostat sections were preincubated for 30 min at RT in PB saline (PBS-0.9%) containing 0.3% Triton X-100, 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 10% serum (Normal goat or normal horse) and then immunostained overnight at RT in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, 1% BSA, 1% serum and the primary antibodies. After 3 washes in PBS, sections were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies (Alexa 488- or 594-conjugated IgG; 1:1000, Invitrogen), washed in PBS, mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) and coverslipped. We used the following antibodies: rabbit anti-ATF3 (1:2000, Santa Cruz), rat anti-CD4 (1:1000, eBiosciences), mouse anti-NF200 (1:20,000; Sigma), guinea-pig anti-TRPV1 (1:7000, gift from D. Julius, UCSF), mouse anti-Oligo2 (1:500, Millipore), mouse anti-PO.7 (1:1000, gift from J. Chan, UCSF), rabbit anti-neuropeptide Y (1:2000, gift from J. Allen), goat anti-CSF1 (1:1000, R&D Systems), rabbit anti-serotonin (1:500, Protos Biotech Corp.) and mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (1:5000, RBI). Images were captured with a Zeiss LSM confocal microscope and ZEISS software (Zen Lite), then processed in ImageJ."

    "Methods": "Animals\nExperiments were conducted using adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA) and neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat pups carrying a germline enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) transgene (bred under University of Florida in house breeding protocols). This colony was obtained via material transfer permission from the colony creators at the University of Missouri on behalf of the University of Missouri-Columbia). All procedures were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nNPC harvest and expansion\nNPCs were derived from neonatal EGFP-expressing Sprague Dawley (SD-Tg(GFP)2BalRrrc) rats at postnatal day 4 as previously described (\nRoss\net al.,\n2012\n). Brains were removed after rapid decapitation, and tissue blocks containing the SVZ were dissected, incubated for 5 mins in trypsin (0.05%), dissociated into single-cell slurry, and plated overnight in growth medium. Growth media consisted of Rat Neurocult base media (Stemcell Technologies Inc., Canada) containing a rat proliferation supplement (Stemcell Technologies Inc., Canada), basic fibroblast growth factor [10ng/ml, bFGF], and epidermal growth factor [10ng/ml, EGF], To isolate neurosphere-forming cells, the non-adherent cell slurry was aspirated after 24h, pelleted by centrifugation, and incubated in trypsin for 2 min. Cells were gently triturated, washed, resuspended and then plated in non-adherent flasks at clonal density (10,000 cells/cm\n2\n) in growth medium. Cells were expanded in ultra-low attachment plates to promote floating sphere formation (Costar, #3471). The resultant neurospheres (NS) were passaged 2\u20133\u00d7 in the same growth medium. To prepare a cell suspension for delivery into the injured adult spinal cord, NS were mechanically dissociated into single cells during passage, and cell number and viability was assessed using trypan blue exclusion (\nRoss\net al.,\n2012\n). An aliquot of the cells prepared for transplant were plated on poly-L-ornithine-coated coverslips and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) and blocked for 1 hour at RT in PBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100 and 10% FBS. Primary antibody (rabbit anti-\u03b2-\u0399\u0399\u0399 tubulin 1:200; rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) 1:2000) was applied overnight at 4\u00b0C. Coverslips were washed 2 \u00d7 10 min in wash buffer (PBS, 0.01% Triton X-100) and incubated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit) for 3h at RT. Slips were washed 2 \u00d7 10 min in wash buffer, mounted on positively charged glass slides (Fisherbrand Superfrost/Plus, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) and cover-slipped in Vectashield containing DAPI counterstain (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence micrographs were obtained with a Leica DMLB epifluorescence microscope equipped with a color Spot cooled CCD digital camera.\n\nSCI and transplantation\nExperiments were performed in separate cohorts of experimental animals, separated by approximately 6 months. All rats underwent C2Hx surgery as described below. In the first cohort, N=8 rats had NPC transplant (body weight = 269 \u00b1 3g), N=4 rats had intraspinal delivery of the growth medium (/.e., sham transplant; body weight = 260 \u00b1 3g), and N=4 rats received C2Hx only (body weight = 260 \u00b1 7g). In the second cohort, there were N=7 NPC transplants (body weight =262 \u00b1 4g) and N=3 sham transplants (body weight = 261 \u00b1 4g). Qualitatively similar results were obtained in both cohorts of NPC transplants for all outcome variables, and the data were combined in the final presentation of the results. Similarly, no differences were detected in any of the neurophysiological or plethsymography measures (all P values > 0.15) between the groups receiving sham transplant (N=7) or C2Hx only (N=4). Therefore, these animals were combined into a single control group for statistical comparison of functional outcomes with rats receiving NPC transplants. The final cohort of rats (N=6, body weight =284 \u00b1 5g) received NPC transplantation and were used only for spinal immunohistochemistry experiments.\nPrior to SCI, rats were anesthetized with xylazine (10 mg/kg s.q.; Phoenix Pharmaceutical, Inc., St. Joseph, MO) and ketamine (120 mg/kg i.p.; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA). The C2Hx lesion was induced as previously described (\nDoperalski and Fuller, 2006\n;\nFuller\net al.,\n2008\n;\nLane\net al.,\n2008\n). Following surgery, an analgesic (buprenorphine, 0.03 mg/kg, s.q.) was given every 12 h for 2 days, and lactated ringers solution (12 ml/day, s.q.) was provided as needed for 2\u20134 days. Seven days after C2Hx surgery, rats were anesthetized again, and the dissociated NPC suspension was delivered intraspinally after surgically exposing the C2\u20133 spinal cord. A total volume of 5pl, containing approximately 500,000 live cells diluted in growth medium (described above), was injected using a 10pl Hamilton glass syringe and a 31 gauge needle. The tip of the needle was positioned in the ventromedial white matter, approximately 1mm caudal to the lesion site and 1.5mm from the dorsal surface of the spinal cord. Sham injections consisted of an equal volume of growth medium. All animals received daily injections of cyclosporine A immunosuppressant (10 mg/kg, s.q., Sandimmune; Novartis, East Hanover, NJ) starting two days before transplantation and continuing until the end of the experiment.\n\nRespiratory outcome measures\nVentilation was measured in unanesthetized, unrestrained rats using a whole-body plethysmography system (Buxco Inc., Wilmington, NC, USA) as previously described (\nFuller\net al.,\n2008\n). Baseline recordings lasted 1\u20131.5 h, and were made while the chamber was flushed with 21% 0\n2\n(balance N\n2\n). Rats were then exposed to two successive respiratory challenges separated by a 5-min normoxic recovery period. First, the chamber was flushed with 10% 0\n2\n(balance N\n2\n) for 5 min to provide an hypoxic respiratory stimulus. Second, the chamber was flushed with 7% C0\n2\n, 21% 0\n2\nmixture (balance N\n2\n) for an hypercapnic stimulus. Data which were derived from the plethysmograph airflow recordings included inspiratory frequency (breaths per minute), inspiratory tidal volume (mis per breath), inspiratory minute ventilation (mis per minute), peak inspiratory airflow rate (mls/sec), peak expiratory airflow rate (mls/sec), inspiratory duration (sec), and expiratory duration (sec). These data were averaged over a 10- min period of stable breathing during the final 30-min of the baseline recording, and over the final min of the hypoxic and hypercapnic challenges. Respiratory volume data were expressed in absolute units (/.e., mis), per 100g body mass, and also relative to the baseline value.\nPhrenic nerve recordings were conducted as previously described (\nSandhu\net al.,\n2010\n). Rats were initially anesthetized with isoflurane (5% in 100% 0\n2\n) and then continued to breath an isoflurane mixture via a nose cone (2\u20133% isoflurane in 50% 0\n2\n, balance N\n2\n) while the trachea was cannulated (PE-240 tubing). After mechanical ventilation was initiated, a catheter (PE-50) was placed in the femoral vein, and isoflurane was withdrawn gradually in parallel with i.v. urethane delivery (1.6 g/kg; 0.12 g/ml distilled water). A femoral arterial catheter (PE-50) was inserted to measure blood pressure (Statham P-10EZ pressure transducer, CP122 AC/DC strain gage amplifier, Grass Instruments, West Warwick, Rl, USA) and to enable withdrawal of blood samples (see protocol). Rats were bilaterally vagotomized to prevent phrenic-ventilator entrainment, and paralyzed with pancuronium bromide (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) to eliminate respiratory muscle contraction. An infusion of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution and sodium bicarbonate (3:1, 1.5ml/h) was maintained to promote acid-base balance (\nBaker-Herman\net al.,\n2009\n). Arterial partial pressures of 0\n2\n(Pa0\n2\n) and C0\n2\n(PaC0\n2\n) as well as pH were determined during baseline, hypoxia and post-hypoxia period from 0.2 ml arterial blood samples using an i-Stat analyzer (Heska, Fort Collins, CO, USA). The end-tidal C0\n2\npartial pressure (PET\nC\no2) was measured throughout the protocol using a rapidly responding mainstream C0\n2\nanalyzer positioned a few cms from the tracheostomy tube on the expired line of the ventilator circuit (Capnogard C02 monitor, Novametrix Medical Systems, Wallingford, CT, USA). Rectal temperature was maintained at 37\u00b11 \u00b0C using a rectal thermistor and heating pad (model TC- 1000, CWE Inc., Ardmore, PA, USA). Electrical activity of both phrenic nerves was recorded using silver wire electrodes, and the signal was amplified (1000\u00d7) and filtered (band pass of 300\u201310,000 Hz, notch filter set at 60 Hz) using a differential A/C amplifier (Model 1700, A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA, USA). The amplified signal was full-wave rectified and moving averaged (time constant 100 ms; model MA-1000; CWE Inc., Ardmore, PA, USA) to create an \u201cintegrated\u201d output (JPhr). Data were digitized using a CED Power 1401 data acquisition interface and recorded on a PC using Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, England).\nThe phrenic nerve recording protocols was as follows. First, the PET\nC\no2 value required for phrenic inspiratory bursting was determined as previously described (Sandhu\net ai,\n2010).\nPE\nT\nC\no2\nwas then monitored continuously, and maintained at 2 mmHg above the onset threshold value by changing the ventilator rate as needed. After a 10-min baseline period, an arterial blood sample was drawn. Rats were then exposed to a 5-min period of hypoxia (FI0\n2\n= 0.12\u2013 0.14), and a blood sample was obtained during the final minute to verify the arterial hypoxemia. After 10-min, rats were exposed to a 5-min bout of hypercapnia (PET\nC\no2 ~80 mmHg) achieved by raising the inspired C0\n2\nconcentration. Ten-min after the hypercapnic exposure, a final \u201cmaximal\u201d respiratory challenge was induced by ceasing the mechanical ventilation for a brief period (10\u201320 s). This procedure produces a maximum respiratory output in this preparation (\nGolder\net al.,\n2003\n). Analysis of phrenic neurograms was done using Spike 2 software. The integrated phrenic neurogram was used to calculate JPhr burst amplitude (mV) and frequency (bursts/min). Data were averaged over 1-min intervals during baseline immediately prior to the first respiratory challenge, and at the end of the hypoxic and hypercapnic exposures. During the final maximal chemoreceptor challenge, the peak 3 inspiratory bursts were averaged.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and Stereology\nThe presence of GFP-positive cells at or near the site of spinal cord injection was confirmed in all NPC transplant rats in which phrenic nerve recordings and plethysmography data were obtained\n(e.g.,\ncohorts 1 and 2). GFP-positive cells were identified using either native fluorescence or antibodies against GFP. The latter procedure was done in a subset of rats to enable quantitative stereology as described subsequently.\nAt the conclusion of neurophysiology data collection, an adequate plane of anesthesia was confirmed by absence of a heart rate or arterial blood pressure response to compressive toe pinch and rats were euthanized by systemic perfusion (via the aorta) with heparinized saline followed by paraformaldehyde (4% w/v in 0.1M PBS, pH=7.4). The animals in the third cohort were euthanized via a lethal dose of Beuthanasia (9:1, sodium pentobarbitone to phenytoin solution) and then systemically perfused with heparinized saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The cervical spinal cords were removed and stored in PBS for 24 hrs at 4\u00b0C. Tissues were then sectioned on a vibratome (40 pm thickness) and transferred in fresh PBS within a 96-well plate. For immunostaining, sections were blocked with 10% (v/v) normal goat serum in 0.1 M PBS for 60 min and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C.\nThe following primary antibodies were used: chicken anti-green fluorescent protein (anti- GFP, 1:1000; Aves Labs, OR) for transplanted NPCs, mouse anti-GFAP (1:100; Abeam, Cambridge, MA) for astrocytes and mouse anti-vimentin (1:500; EnCor Biotechnology, Gainesville, FL) for immature astrocytes, rabbit anti-\u03b2 tubulin III (1:500 to 1:1000; Abeam, Cambridge, MA) for immature neurons, as well as mouse anti-oligodendrocyte marker O4 (1:100 to 1:500; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), rabbit anti-CNPase (1:200 to 1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), mouse anti-MBP (1:1000; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) and mouse antioligodendrocyte marker O1 (1:500 to 1:1000; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for oligodendrocytes. For the secondary labeling, tissue was incubated with goat anti-chicken secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Flour 594 (1:500, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) for 2 hr. Tissue sections were washed three times with PBS, slide mounted and cover-slipped with mounting medium containing DAPI nuclear counterstain. Immunofluorescent images were taken using an Olympus 1X81-DSN spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu CCD digital camera. Image analysis was done using Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging innovations, CO) and post-analysis was done in Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, CA).\nFor brightfield microscopy, spinal cord sections were incubated overnight in chicken antigreen fluorescent protein (anti-GFP, 1:40,000; Aves Labs, OR). The following day, sections were incubated in goat anti-chicken DSB-X biotin secondary antibody (1: 200, Invitrogen, CA) for 2hr, followed by incubation in ABC reagent (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 2hr and then developed in freshly prepared diaminobenzidine peroxidase substrate solution to detect EGFP (conjugated with biotin, brown). Tissues were also counter-stained with cresyl violet for morphology and then examined with light microscopy. In a subset of animals (N=8), the number of DAB-positive transplanted cells in the cervical spinal cord was quantified with unbiased stereology using a Zeiss AxioImager A1 light microscope under a 10\u00d7 objective lens for tracing and a 40\u00d7 objective lens for counting and Microbrighfield StereoInvestigator software (\nBanuelos\net al.,\n2013\n). NPC yield was quantified by counting EGFP-positive nuclei in every 4\nth\nsection using the Optical Fractionator probe, and Serial Section Manager. Three separate regions were counted: the gray matter, the dorsal columns and the ventrolateral white matter. Cavalieri\u2019s Principle was applied to extrapolate the area and volume of the cell graft (\nGundersen\neta!.,\n1988\n).\n\nStatistical Analyses\nStatistical tests were done using SigmaPlot v.12 software. A two-way repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Student-Neuman-Keuls post hoc test was used to assess plethysmography data: factor 1 = time (4- or 8-wk), factor 2 = treatment group (transplant or control). The same statistical test was used to compare phrenic nerve activity between groups: factor 1 = treatment (NPC transplant or control), factor 2 = condition (baseline, hypoxia, hypercapnia or maximal challenge). If the data were not normally distributed, a log transformation procedure was done before proceeding with the ANOVA. Differences were considered statistically significant when the P value < 0.05. Microbrightfield Stereoinvestigator software was used to extrapolate graft volume from the cell counts derived from the stereology analyses. A one-way ANOVA with Student-Neuman-Keuls post hoc test was used to compare the number of transplanted cells in the gray matter, dorsal white matter and ventral white matter. All data are presented as the mean \u00b1 1 standard deviation."

    "Methods": "Experimental Animals\nAll procedures met national guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals, and all experimental protocols were approved by the VCU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Both rat and mouse subjects were utilized. Male Sprague Dawley rats (300-350 g; Harlan Laboratories) were housed in pairs under a temperature (22\u00b0C) and humidity controlled environment with food and water\nad libitum,\nand subjected to a 12 hour dark-light cycle. Rats (n=34) were used in electrophysiological experiments to determine the efficacy of CFZ to protect against axonal conduction deficits induced by midline fluid percussion injury (FPI). For\nin vitro\nexperiments to assay the effect of CFZ on glial inflammatory response, corpus callosa were harvested from litters of C57BL/6 mouse pups (P3-5), to generate mixed glial cultures of microglia and astrocytes. All\nin vitro\nexperiments were repeated in four separate cultures.\n\nFluid Percussion TBI Procedure, and CFZ administration\nThe model used for injury was the same as that described by Dixon et al. (1987). Briefly, all animals were surgically prepared under nose-cone isoflurane anesthesia (2% in carrier gas of 70% N\n2\nO, 30% O\n2\n). Rats were positioned in a stereotaxic frame, and a 4.8 mm skull craniotomy was prepared over the midline, centered between bregma and lambda. A modified Leur-Loc syringe hub (2.6 mm i.d.) was then positioned over the exposed dura and bonded in place with cyanoacrylate adhesive, and the entire complex was anchored by two steel screws and dental acrylic. The open hub was packed with Gelfoam prior to scalp suturing and Bacitracin applied. Once animals had recovered from anesthesia, they were returned to their home cages.\nTwenty-four hours following hub implantation, rats received fluid percussion injury or a sham injury. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% in carrier gas of 70% N\n2\nO and 30% O\n2\n), connected to a fluid percussion device through the exposed hub, and injured at 2.0 \u00b1 0.2 atmospheres. The injury device (Model 01-B, Custom Design and Fabrication, Inc., Richmond, VA) consisted of a 60 \u00d7 4.5 cm Plexiglas water-filled cylinder, fitted at one end with a piston mounted on O-rings, with the opposite end housing a pressure transducer. At the time of injury, the Leur-Loc fitting, filled with 0.9% saline, was attached to the transducer housing. The injury was produced by a metal pendulum that struck the piston, injecting a small volume of saline into the cranial cavity, briefly deforming the brain tissue (20 ms pulse duration). The resulting pressure pulse was recorded extracranially by the transducer and expressed in atmospheres of pressure. Injury magnitude was controlled by setting the height from which the pendulum was released. Following injury all animals were promptly ventilated with room air until spontaneous breathing resumed. The duration of suppression of the righting reflex was used as an index of traumatic unconsciousness. For control rats administered sham injuries, TBI procedures were as above except that the intracranial pressure pulse was not injected.\nAt 15 minutes following TBI, rats received an intraperitoneal bolus of 50 mg/kg CFZ (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) in vehicle (100% dimethyl sulfoxide), or vehicle alone, injected at a volume of 0.1 ml / 100 g body weight. The following experimental groups were used: TBI + vehicle (n=7); TBI + CFZ (n=9); Sham + vehicle (n=11); Sham + CFZ (n=7).\n\nElectrophysiological Recording Procedures\nFollowing the fluid percussion injury, rats were allowed to survive for 24 hours prior to electrophysiological recording. Each rat was decapitated under 4% isoflurane anesthesia, and the brain rapidly removed. Coronal slices of 450 \u03bcm thickness were cut in ice cold (4 to 6\u00b0C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) with a vibrating-knife microtome (model OTS-3000-03, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). All slices were saved which contained midline-crossing segments of the corpus callosum, including genu, callosal midbody, and splenium regions. Slices were then transferred to a holding chamber containing oxygenated ACSF at room temperature, and were allowed to equilibrate under these conditions for at least 1 h prior to recording. The ACSF contained (in mM): NaCl 124, KCl 5, NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n1.25, NaHCO\n3\n26, MgSO\n4\n1.3, CaCl\n2\n2, glucose 10; pH 7.4; saturated with a 95% O\n2\n/ 5% CO\n2\ngas mixture. For recording, a slice was transferred to a submersion-type chamber, and perfused at a rate of 1-2 ml / min., and recordings conducted with slices at room-temperature (22-23 degrees C), based on our previous finding that this temperature range was optimal for separate quantification of the myelinated and unmyelinated CAP components (\nReeves et al., 2005\n). A bipolar stimulating electrode (teflon-insulated tungsten; 0.3-0.4 mm intertip distance) was lowered into the corpus callosum, at approximately 0.5 mm lateral to midline, and a recording electrode (ACSF-filled glass micropipette; resistance 4 - 8 M\u03a9) was also placed in the corpus callosum of the contralateral hemisphere at a distance of approximately 1.0 mm from the stimulating electrode (\nFig. 1A\n). Fine adjustments were made in the depths of both stimulating and recording electrodes to optimize the signal amplitude. Evoked compound action potentials (CAPs) were amplified (bandpass = DC to 10 kHz), and digitized at 25 kHz for offline analysis.\nFigure 1. Electrode placement for CAP recording and waveform quantification.\nOpen in a new tab\nA.\nStimulating (Stim) and recording (Rec) electrodes were positioned to acquire CAPs evoked in midline-crossing corpus callosum axons.\nB.,C.\nRepresentative CAP waveform showing N1 component, generated primarily by myelinated axons, and slower N2 wave generated mainly by unmyelinated axons. CAP peak amplitudes were quantified as: N1 = (a+b)/2; N2 = (c+d)/2.\nThe callosal CAP has been extensively characterized as a biphasic waveform with an early component generated predominantly by relatively fast-conducting myelinated axons (N1), and a later-occurring component reflecting mainly slower unmyelinated axons (N2) (Preston et al., 1982; Swanson et al., 1998;\nAi et al., 2007\n;\nReeves et al., 2005\n,\n2007\n;\nCrawford et al., 2009\n;\nColley et al., 2010\n) [\nFig. 1B\n]. CAP amplitudes, for N1 and N2 waveforms, were calculated as shown in\nFig. 1C\n, by averaging the vertical distances of the negative peak to the preceding and following positivities [N1 = (a+b)/2; N2 = (c+d)/2]. Stimulation used for evoked CAPs was constant current stimulus-isolated square wave pulses, with stimulus intensity and frequency adjusted for specific recording protocols. For analyses of TBI-related changes in CAP amplitude, standardized input-output functions were generated, for each slice, by varying the intensity of stimulus pulses (200 \u03bcs duration, delivered at 0.1 Hz) in ten equal steps from approximately threshold level to an asymptotic maximum for the N1 CAP component. We previously demonstrated this method of current standardization results in conservative levels of stimulus currents, avoiding extensive stimulation at supramaximal levels for N1 fibers, and captures the linear portion of the N2 signal (\nReeves et al., 2005\n). In refractoriness testing, pairs of pulses were presented with interpulse interval increased, in 1.0 ms steps, from 4.0 ms to 15.0 ms, using the maximum current level established during input-output testing for that slice. In analyses of refractoriness, mean ratios of CAP2/CAP1 (obtained in paired stimulus presentations) were plotted as a function of interpulse interval, and fitted to Boltzmann sigmoid curves. Conduction velocity of callosal axons was measured by holding the stimulating electrode in a constant position, while systematically moving the recording pipette to acquire CAPs at inter-electrode distances between 0.75 mm and 3.0 mm, as determined using a motorized micromanipulator (model MPC-385-2, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). Conduction velocity was computed as the inverse of the slope in linear regressions relating response latency to inter-electrode distance (\nCrawford et al., 2009\n).\n\nImmunohistochemistry and Western blot of Corpus Callosum\nIn order to document cellular localization of callosal Kv1.3 and Kv1.2, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was first performed in a subset of TBI and Sham injured rats (n=3/group) surviving for 24h after injury. Animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, 30-40\u00b5m coronal brain sections cut by vibratome and tissues processed for IHC (Warren et al., 2012) using antibodies for Kv1.3 (\nAlomone, Neuromab; 1:50\n), Kv1.2 (\nAlomone\n; 1:150) IBA1 (\nWako, Abcam\n; 1:300, 1:400), and GFAP (\nDako; Encor Biotechnology; 1:20,000, 1:2,000\n). Images were collected on a Zeiss 700 confocal microscope for qualitative tissue localization of each protein. A second subset of rats was then subjected to TBI, Sham injury or TBI+CFZ treatment and at 24h after injury, animals were either decapitated under 4% isoflurane anesthesia and corpus callosum dissected for Western blot (WB; n=7/group) analysis of protein extracts (\nReeves et al., 2010\n), or perfused with aldehyde as described above to perform Kv1.3 IHC (n=3/group). For WB, tissue was homogenized in 1X RIPA Lysis Buffer (\nMillipore\n) containing Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (\nRoche\n), 0.1% SDS and 2mM EGTA. After centrifugation (14,000xg at 4\u00b0C) supernatants were collected, assayed for protein content and aliquots of 20\u00b5g separated on 4-12% SDS-PAGE prior to transfer to PVDF membranes (\nInvitrogen\n). Post blot membranes were subjected to immunobinding with either Kv1.3 or Kv1.2 antibodies (\nAlomone\n; 1:100, 1:150) or IL1-\u03b2 (\nR&D Systems\n;1:200) after published methods (\nReeves et al., 2010\n). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with Gene Snap (\nSyngene\n) instrumentation using ECL\nTM\nWestern Blotting Analysis System (\nAmersham\n), relative optical density (ROD) measured with Gene Tools programs and results reported as percent of untreated control values run on the same blot.\n\nCulture of Enriched Corpus Callosum Glia\nMixed primary glial cultures, enriched for callosal microglia and astrocytes, were generated from P3-5 C57BL/6 mouse pups and prepared for culture as previously described (\nMcCarthy and de Vellis, 1980\n;\nTrimmer et al., 1991\n;\nKozlova and Takenaga, 2005\n). Cells were plated in 25cm\n2\n(T25) flasks in a culture medium (CM) consisting of Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium, 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), pyruvate (1mM) and antimycotic-antibiotic (\nInvitrogen\n) at a density of 5 x10\n5\ncells. Cultures were replated (4-8 X 10\n5\ncells/T25 flask) and used for protein extraction and WB analysis when confluent (total days in vitro: 19-20). MatTek coverslip dishes (coated with polylysine) were seeded from the same cell suspension at subconfluent density for immunocytochemistry (ICC). At 14 DIV, a subset of dishes and confluent flasks were exposed to LPS (1ug/ml CM) in order to mimic postinjury inflammation (\nZhang and Gottschall, 1997\n;\nRosenberg, 2001\n;\nLiu et al., 2007\n). After 24h, LPS containing media was removed from dishes and flasks and replaced with fresh CM for a 1h wash out period. Following LPS wash out, CFZ (10\u00b5M in CM) was added to dishes and flasks for an additional 24h period according to published protocols (\nSteel et al., 1999\n;\nRen et al., 2008\n). In addition to LPS + CFZ, each study included dishes and flasks that were exposed to LPS (1ug/ml in CM) or CFZ (10\u00b5M in CM) or left untreated (CM alone) for 24h. At the end of treatment intervals, flasks were photographed with phase microscopy to document cell morphology, then media was removed, flasks rinsed with Dulbecco\u2019s PBS (\n+\nCa\n2+\n, Mg\n2+\n) and cells scraped free (in Dulbecco\u2019s PBS (\u2010Ca\n2+\n, Mg\n2+\n) for protein extraction. As for tissue extracts, protein aliquots were separated by 4-12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane (\nReeves et al., 2010\n;\nChan et al., 2014\n) prior to WB probe of IL1-\u03b2 (\nR&D Systems;\n1:200) expression. Immunopositive bands were also visualized with Gene Snap (\nSyngene\n), relative optical density (ROD) measured with Gene Tools and results reported as percent of untreated control values run on the same blot. Parallel MatTek dishes in each treatment group were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stored in PBS. The PBS was removed and replaced with Vectashield mounting media plus DAPI in order to collect confocal fluorescent images and assess the co-localization of signals from IL1-\u03b2 (\nR&D Systems\n; 1:100) or Kv1.3 (\nNeuromab\n; 1:50) in IBA1+ (\nWako, Abcam; 1:300, 1:400\n) microglia or GFAP+ (\nDako, Encor Biotechnology; 1:20,000, 1:2,000\n) astrocytes, stained as described for IHC. Images were collected using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. Experiments were repeated in four separate cultures.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor input-output and refractoriness testing, quantitative analyses were conducted on waveforms which were the average of four successive sweeps. In cases where more than one slice was used from a single rat, those multiple-slice data were averaged for that rat and used for the analysis. Two categories of inferential statistical tests were used to evaluate the effects of injury and CFZ on callosal CAPs. First, analyses conducted at single levels of stimulation were evaluated using ANOVA (SPSS v21) combined with Bonferroni posthoc tests, and where appropriate, effect size was estimated using the Cohen\u2019s D statistic. Secondly, the significance of shifts in curves, measured in input-output or refractory analyses, was evaluated with the Mann-Whitney U test. A nonparametric approach was selected in the latter case, because homogeneity of variance requirements were not met when ranges of stimulus intensities were applied. Statistical analysis of WB data was also performed using SPSS v21. Raw relative optical density measures were first tested for normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic) and homogeneity of variance. Appropriate data were then analyzed with ANOVA, and Dunnett post hoc tests. The significance level, \u03b1 = 0.05, was used for all inferential statistics, and averaged values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM."

    "Methods": "2.1. Blast exposure\nAll experiments were performed on adult male (12\u201316 weeks old) C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA). Animal care and use followed guidelines specified by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. A shock tube that provided controllable and reproducible input was used to simulate free-field blast events (\nAlphonse et al., 2014\n). Animals were first deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction for 2 min; 2% maintenance for 3 min) and then placed in a holder positioned 1 cm outside the exit end of the shock tube (\nFig. 1A\n). At this location the shock wave profile is not significantly different from that of the inside of the tube (\nPanzer et al., 2012\n), and there are minimal reflections of the shock wave into the tube, which results in a less complex loading profile across the surface of the head. A sorbothane-lined (Part 8514K51, McMaster-Carr, Princeton, NJ) aluminum casing protected the torso and extremities from the blast. Animals were oriented with their snouts facing the shock tube (\nFig. 1A\n). Two different kinematic conditions were generated: 1) constrained motion, wherein head motion was constrained with a thin metal rod encircling the snout and a cervical collar positioned between the occiput and shoulders, and 2) unconstrained motion, wherein the head was allowed to move freely during blast loading. Sham animals were similarly positioned with their heads either constrained or unconstrained corresponding to the kinematic condition of injury. After blast or sham exposure, righting time (the time taken by an animal placed supine to roll onto its stomach) was used to assess neurological impairment.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nConstraining the head significantly reduces the acceleration experienced by it upon impact. (A) Schematic of the shock tube configuration used to create the blast wave exposure. The animal was placed 1 cm outside the exit end of the shock tube in a protective body holder with its head either constrained or unconstrained. (B, C) Representative shockwaves for mild blast (215 kPa peak overpressure) and moderate blast (415 kPa peak overpressure) loading. (D, E) Constraining the head minimizes its displacement during both mild (D) and moderate (E) blast loading. (F) Displacement of the head when it is unconstrained (\nn\n= 13) during mild blast loading. Exposure to moderate blast loading in this kinematic condition was lethal. (G) The acceleration is significantly larger than when the head is unconstrained under the same loading condition (\np\n< 0.0001, Student's\nt\n-test). There was no significant difference in the accelerations produced by mild (\nn\n= 8) and moderate (\nn\n= 5) blast loading (\np\n= 0.97; Student's\nt\n-test).\n\n2.2. Impulse levels\nAnimals were exposed to one of two blast levels (\nFig. 1B, C\n) designed with past work as reference: 1) mild blast - peak incident overpressure of 215 \u00b1 13 kPa, duration of 0.65 \u00b1 0.04 ms, and an impulse of 46 \u00b1 5 kPa * ms, which is within the range of conditions causing cognitive impairment in rodents following blast exposure (\nKovacs et al., 2014\n), and 2) moderate blast - peak incident overpressure of 415 \u00b1 41 kPa, duration of 1.04 \u00b1 0.04 ms, and impulse of 148 \u00b1 12 kPa * ms, which is above the threshold for changes in BBB permeability\nin vitro\n(\nHue et al., 2013\n;\nHue et al., 2015\n) and LTP deficits in organotypic slice cultures (\nEffgen et al., 2014\n;\nVogel et al., 2015\n). This range of blast loading is comparable to exposure to a 105-mm artillery round at a standoff distance of 5\u201310 m. The effects of unconstrained motion were only examined at the lower exposure level, as the higher exposure resulted in significant mortality.\n\n2.3. Blast loading biomechanics\nPressure transducers with sufficient dynamic frequency response (Endevco, model 8530B-200, San Juan Capistrano, CA) were used to record the pressure at the shock tube exit. An additional pressure transducer was placed adjacent to the torso to measure the overpressures experienced by the torso. An inline filter conditioning box (Alligator Technologies, USBPGF-S1, Costa Mesa, CA) with a 20-kHz cutoff frequency linear phase filter was used to avoid aliasing of the signal prior to data acquisition. To estimate head accelerations resulting from blast loading, a high-speed video acquisition system (Phantom v4.2 camera, Vision Research, Wayne, NJ) was used to record head motion during blast exposure. The resultant head velocities and accelerations were calculated as previously described (\nGullotti et al., 2014\n).\n\n2.4. Behavior assessment\nBehavior was assessed over the first nine days following injury. Tests were ordered to minimize any intermixing effects among the different tests. A more complete description of these tests appears in a recent publication (\nPatel et al., 2014a\n). An automated software program was used to analyze performance (\nhttp://www.seas.upenn.edu/\u223cmolneuro/autotyping.html\n). Briefly, the tests performed and the parameters used to assess neurological changes are listed below.\n\n2.5. Elevated zero-maze\nThe time spent in the open and walled regions of an elevated zeromaze was used as a measure of anxiety-like behavior. These changes were measured one day after blast exposure.\n\n2.6. Rotarod performance\nA rotarod apparatus (model: ENV-577M, Med Associates Inc., Georgia, VT) that accelerated a rod linearly from 4 to 40 RPM over a five-minute session was used to assess motor coordination. The time lapsed until first fault (fault time) and the total time the animal remained on the rotating rod before falling (fall time) were recorded for each test. For animals that did not fault, fall time was used for fault. Three trials, separated by an hour each, were conducted on each of three consecutive days starting the day after blast exposure.\n\n2.7. Open field test\nAnimals were left undisturbed in a 30 cm \u00d7 40 cm open field arena and videotaped with a ceiling-mounted camera for 30 min. The time spent by each animal in the outer periphery, center region and four corner quadrants was determined over five-minute intervals for the entire time period. Ambulation data was further categorized into exploring, walking, or sitting behavior. Open field changes were measured three days after blast exposure.\n\n2.8. Spatial object recognition (SOR)\nMice were first acclimatized for ten minutes in an arena (30 cm \u00d7 40 cm) without objects and then in three ten-minute sessions to two distinct objects placed in the arena. Each session was separated by 1 h. Twenty-four hours later, one of the objects was displaced and mice were recorded for a fifth ten-minute session. The amounts of time the animal spent interacting with the objects and exploring the remainder of the field were quantified. The animal's preference for the displaced object over the non-displaced object in the fifth session was measured. The SOR paradigm was implemented on days 4 and 5 following blast exposure.\n\n2.9. Fear conditioning\nContextual fear conditioning was performed as described previously (\nPatel et al., 2014a\n). On the first day of the testing sequence, the animal was placed in a conditioning chamber (Coulbourn Instruments, Whitehall, PA) for 2 min and twenty-eight seconds before the onset of a foot shock (2-s, 1.5 mA). Contextual conditioning was assessed 24 h later by placing the animal back in the same chamber for 5 min. The animal's trajectory during this period was analyzed to identify periods of freezing behavior. The percent of time spent in a freezing posture was used as a measure of the conditioned fear response. The fear conditioning paradigm was implemented on days 8 and 9 following blast exposure.\n\n2.10. Acute hippocampal slice preparation and recording\nAnimals were decapitated under isoflurane anesthesia and their brains were quickly isolated into ice-cold, oxygenated (95% O\n2\n, 5% CO\n2\n) sucrose-based artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) consisting of (in mM) 202 sucrose, 3 KCl, 2.5 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 10 glucose, 1 MgCl\n2\nand 2 CaCl\n2\n. Coronal sections (350 \u03bcm thick) were cut using a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL), transferred to oxygenated ACSF (comprising, in mM, of 130 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 26 NaHCO\n3\n,10glucose, 1MgCl\n2\n, and 2 CaCl\n2\n),and maintained at 34\u201336 \u00b0C. Prior to recording, slices were transferred to room temperature (22\u201324 \u00b0C) in an interface chamber perfused with oxygenated ACSF (2\u20134 ml min\n\u22121\n).\nField potentials were recorded in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus (1.58\u20132.30 mm posterior to Bregma) from either hemisphere by an Axoclamp 900 A amplifier interfaced with pClamp 10 data acquisition software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The stimulating electrode (#CBDPG75, Frederick Haer Corporation, Bowdoin, ME) was placed in the stratum radiatum (SR) at the boundary between the CA1 and CA2 regions, approximately two thirds of the length of the SR from the cell body layer (stratum pyramidale; SP). The recording electrode was similarly placed in the SR in CA1 at approximately two thirds of the length of the SR from the SP and 700\u20131100 \u03bcm from the stimulating electrode (\nJohnson et al., 2014\n). For population spike responses, the recording electrode was placed adjacent to the stratum pyramidale and stratum oriens layers at a similar distance from the recording electrode. Both electrodes were gradually positioned at a depth at which the maximum amplitude of the measured parameter (slope of the linear portion of the response in SR and the amplitude of the population spike in SP) was obtained. Recording electrodes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (#1B150F-4, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) to have a tip resistance of 2\u20136 M\u03a9 and filled with ACSF. The electrical stimulus was 100 \u03bcs in duration, and was biphasic, with the negative phase appearing first. Recorded signals were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz.\nField potentials were recorded five days after treatment (shamor injury). Input-output (I/O) curves were first obtained for all slices for stimulus intensities in the range of 40\u2013400 \u03bcA. The stimuli were incremented by 40 \u03bcA, and were 8 s apart. The stimulation pattern was repeated three times and the slopes of the three repetitions were averaged. The stimulus intensity at which the half-maximum slope was obtained was used to examine release probability using paired-pulses. The pair of stimuli was delivered 25, 50, 75 and 100 milliseconds apart. For each inter-stimulus interval, the measured slopes in three trials (separated by 8 s) were averaged and the ratio of the second to the first slope was calculated.\nContribution of the NMDA receptors to the field potential was isolated through perfusion of 6 \u03bcM CNQX (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) in reduced magnesium ACSF (mACSF) comprising of (in mM): 130 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 10 glucose, 0.5 MgCl\n2\n, and 2 CaCl\n2.\nThe stimulus intensity for half-maximum slope was used to determine the baseline during drug perfusion. The stimulus was delivered every 30s until the decreasing slope stabilized at its final value (typically 20\u2013 30 min). Input-output (I/O) curves were determined as described above. Relative contribution of the inhibitory neurons to the field potential was tested in a different set of slices by measuring field I/O curves in the presence of bicuculline methiodide (BMI; 30 \u03bcM; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) added to ACSF.\n\n2.11. Histology and immunohistochemistry\nTen days following blast exposure, animals were anesthetized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with 20 ml of ice-cold PBS (1\u00d7;pH7.4) followed by 40 ml of freshly prepared ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were isolated, fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 \u00b0C and cryoprotected in 24% sucrose phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Perfused brains were then embedded in paraffin and cryosectioned into 20 \u03bcm sections. Sections were evenly distributed over five replicate series, with a spacing of 200 \u03bcm between sections within a series. Prior to staining, sections were successively rinsed with xylene (2 \u00d7 5 min); ethanol 100% (2 \u00d7 1 min), 95% (1 min), 80% (1 min) and 70% (1 min); and distilled water. For immunohistochemistry, sections were then immersed for 30 min in a mixture of methanol and hydrogen peroxide (5:1), washed for 10 min in running water and blocked for 5 min with 2% fetal bovine serum in 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 7.6). Sections were soaked in primary antibody overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-GFAP (1:20000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:1000; Wako, Richmond, VA). For Iba1 staining, antigen retrieval was performed prior to treatment with the methanol\u2013hydrogen-peroxide mixture by immersing the sections in 88% formic acid for 5 min and rinsing with distilled water for 5 min. The primary antibody was rinsed with 0.1 M Tris buffer and sections were soaked in the secondary antibody (affinity purified biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG, Vector Laboratories, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then rinsed (0.1 M Tris buffer), soaked in ABC solution (Vectastain kit, Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed (0.1 M Tris buffer), immersed in DAB (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 1.5\u20135 min, and cover slipped. For cresyl violet (FD Neurotechnologies, Inc., Columbia, MD) and hematoxylin and eosin staining, sections were soaked in cresyl violet solution (0.1% for 35 min) or Shandon Harris hematoxylin (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA; 5 min) subsequent to rinses with xylene and varying concentrations of ethanol, and rinsed with distilled water. Sections exposed to cresyl violet were then treated with a mixture (1000:1; for 30 s) of 95% ethanol and 0.1% glacial acetic acid, followed by 100% ethanol (for 1 min) and xylene (2 \u00d7 5 min), and cover slipped. Sections exposed to hematoxylin were treated with a mixture of hydrochloric acid (0.1%) and ethanol (50%) for 2 s, washed in running water for 15 min, treated with eosin for 45 s, rinsed successively with distilled water, 95% (1 min), 100% ethanol (1 min) and xylene (2 \u00d7 5 min), and cover slipped.\nSections from corresponding sham and injured animals were processed and imaged simultaneously. Low magnification images were acquired with a light microscope (Leica DM4000 B, Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) fitted with a camera (Leica DFC340FX) with a 5\u00d7 objective. Higher magnification images were acquired with a confocal scanning laser microscope (Leica TCS SP5, Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) with 40\u00d7 or 63\u00d7 objectives. Images from all the three groups, for any given staining, were acquired under identical acquisition parameters and settings. Intensity of immunohistochemical staining was quantified using ImageJ. Briefly, regions of interest were drawn around the brain structure or tissue of interest, and the area of staining was measured using the analyze particles function based on an intensity threshold. The image processing parameters were identical across all the groups.\n\n2.12. Statistical analysis\nStatistical differences in behavior and histological staining among the different experimental groups (sham, constrained motion (both levels), unconstrained motion) were assessed using one-way ANOVA or repeated measures (RM) ANOVA as appropriate. When significant, post-hoc comparisons were done with Tukey's test. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine normality and nonparametric versions of the tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U) were employed as needed. Comparison of the field electrophysiology data (I/O curves, population spike and paired pulse facilitation) between the two blast loading levels and sham was done using a generalized linear model wherein the variability between slices and animals in each group was accounted for in the analysis. For the pharmacology data, a paired\nt\n-test was used to determine the effect of the applied drug on a slice within a group. The effect of a drug on slices in two groups was compared using a Student's\nt\n-test and in three groups with one-way ANOVA. A\np\n-value less than or equal to 0.05 was considered significant. All values are reported as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. unless otherwise noted."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nRats were housed 2\u20134/cage in a temperature and humidity controlled vivarium with a 12-h light\u2013dark cycle and with food and water ad-libitum. Experiments were performed during day time (lights on for PPI and PDG-PET studies, and lights off for LI studies), according to the guidelines of the European Union Council Directive 2010/63/EU for care of laboratory animals and were approved by the local ethic committee (Senate of Berlin, Germany for PPI experiments, Animal Care and use Committee, Tel Aviv University, Israel for LI experiments and Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of Hospital Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Madrid, Spain for FDG-PET studies and the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health).\n\n2.2. Experimental design\nWistar rats (Harlan Laboratories, Germany, Israel and Spain) were mated and the first day after copulation was defined as day 1 of pregnancy. On gestation day 15, pregnant dams were given a single i.v. injection to the tail vein of either poly I:C (4 mg/kg; SIGMA, Germany) dissolved in saline, or saline alone under light isoflurane anesthesia (\nHadar et al., 2015\n). On post-natal day (PND) 21, pups were weaned and housed according to sex and litter. Experimental groups consisted of male offspring derived from multiple independent litters. Surgery was performed on adult offspring (PND > 90), bilateral electrodes were implanted into either the mPFC or the Nacc shell. Behavioral and imaging experiments commenced 1\u20132 weeks\npost-surgery\n. During the last 5 days of recovery, rats were handled for about 10 min daily. Handling comprised habituation to the investigator, the stimulation procedure, i.e. connection of the electrodes to the cable system, and if applicable, the testing chamber. DBS was conducted during PPI testing for 40 min, during pre-exposure and conditioning stages of the LI paradigm for 30 and 15 min and during FDG uptake periods for 45 min at 130 Hz, 150 \u03bcA and a pulse duration of 90 \u03bcsec (biphasic stimulation mode). These parameters were chosen as they were found to be the most effective in our previous experiments with this model (\nKlein et al., 2013\n). DBS was performed with an isolated stimulator (MultichannelSystems; Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA, USA) connected to the electrodes via an isolated cable system hanging from the ceiling of the behavioral apparatus and a swivel.\n\n2.3. Surgery\nSurgery was conducted under general anesthesia (PPI experiments: fentanyl (0.005 mg/kg i.m., Janssen-Cilag, Germany), midazolam (2 mg/kg i.m., Hameln, Germany), medetomidine dihydrochloride (0.135 mg/kg i.m., Elanci Animal Health, Germany), antagonized upon completion with naloxone (0.12 mg/kg i.m. Inresa Arzneimittel, Germany), flumazenil (0.2 mg/kg i.m, HEXAL Germany) and atipamezolhydrochlorid (0.75 mg/kg s.c. Elanco Animal Health, Germany); LI experiments: isoflurane (Nicholas Piramal, Northumberland, United Kingdom) followed by avertin (20 ml/kg i.p.); imaging: ketamine (100 mg/kg i.p., Pfizer, Ortak\u00f6y-Istanbul, Turkey) and xylazine 1 mg/kg i.p., Calier, Barcelona, Spain). Cathodes (monopolar platinum\u2013irridium electrodes with connector; Plastics One, Roanoke, USA) were bilaterally implanted into the mPFC (more specifically into the ventral prelimbic cortex; anteroposterior (AP) +3.5, mediolateral (ML) 0.6, dorsoventral (DV) -3.4) or the Nacc shell (AP +1.2, ML 1.5, DV-8.2), as previously described (\nKlein et al., 2013\n). Anodes were wrapped around anchor screws implanted in close proximity to the stimulating electrode. Electrode placement was confirmed in cresyl violet stained sections or imaging. For the former, rats were anaesthetized and transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). For the latter, computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained and co-registered to a reference MRI study (anatomical MRI template obtained from a non-operated animal). Only animals with correct electrode placement were included in the study (\nFig. 1a + b\n).\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nElectrode placements. (a) Schematic reconstruction of electrode placements in either the mPFC (left) or Nacc (right), histologically verified in rats undergoing PPI (grey circles) and LI (black circles: PE; white circles: NPE) circles) experiments. (b) Representative CT scan showing electrode positioned in either the mPFC (upper) or Nacc (bottom).\n\n2.4. Behavior\n2.4.1. Prepulse inhibition (PPI)\nPPI of the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) was measured in three sessions given 24 h apart. Session 1 (baseline 1) was conducted without stimulation. Session 2 was conducted while animals received either mPFC or Nacc-DBS. Session 3 (baseline 2) was carried out with no DBS applied to assess whether the observed effects in Session 2 were permanent or transient, i.e. effect not noticed 24 h after DBS. During test sessions, animals were placed in a wire mesh cage mounted on a transducer-platform. Loudspeakers on both sides of the cage were used for acoustic stimulation. Sessions began with a 5 min acclimatization phase, which was followed by the PPI test. During acclimatization, animals were exposed to background noise followed by 10 startle stimuli (20 ms each). The test session consisted of 7 different types of trials administered in a pseudorandom order: 1) pulse alone (100 dB sound pressure levels (SPL) white noise, 20 ms duration); 2) control (no stimulus); 3\u20134) prepulse alone (72 dB or 68 dB, pure tone, 10 Hz, 20 ms duration); 5\u20137) prepulse (72 dB, 68 dB, or 64 dB) followed by pulse (100 ms interstimulus interval). Animals received a total of 10 presentations of each type. Background noise intensity during the whole experiment was 60 dB SPL. PPI was calculated according to the formula 100\u2013100% \u00d7 (PPx/PA), in which PPx is the ASR of the 10 PPI trials for each individual prepulse intensity and PA is the mean ASR of the pulse alone trials. The average PPI response over the three pre-pulse intensities was analyzed (\nKlein et al., 2013\n;\nMattei et al., 2014\n).\n2.4.2. Latent inhibition (LI)\nLI was measured in a thirst-motivated conditioned emotional response (CER) procedure by comparing the suppression of drinking to a tone previously paired with a foot-shock in rats that received non-reinforced exposure to the tone before conditioning (pre-exposed, PE) and in rats for whom the tone was novel (non-pre-exposed, NPE). Each LI experiment included eight experimental groups in a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 design with main factors of pre-exposure (NPE, PE), maternal immune stimulation (poly I:C, saline) and treatment (DBS, sham). LI was measured in rodent test chambers with a retractable bottle (Campden Instruments). Rats were handled (5 days), water-deprived (23 h/day; five days) and trained to lick in the experimental chamber (5 days). Following training, surgery took place and ad libitum water was reinstated until the animals recovered from the procedure (1\u20132 weeks). Thereafter, water restriction was reinstated and rats were again re-trained to drink in the experimental chamber for 5 days. On the next 4 days, LI was conducted, consisting of the following stages given 24 h apart:\nPre-exposure\n: PE rats were placed in the chamber with the bottles removed and presented with 40 tones (10 s, 80 dB, 2.8 kHz) given 40 s apart. NPE animals were placed in the chamber but were not exposed to tones.\nConditioning\n: With the bottles removed, all rats were placed in the chamber and received 2 tone-shock (0.5 mA, 1 s duration) pairings given 5 min apart.\nLick retraining Test\n: Rats were placed in the chamber and allowed to drink from the bottle. Upon completing 75 licks, a tone was presented for 5 min. Time to complete licks 51\u201375 (before the tone) and licks 76\u2013100 (after the tone) was recorded. Time to complete licks 76\u2013100 was logarithmically transformed for parametric analysis of variance. Longer log times indicate a stronger drinking suppression. LI was defined as significantly shorter log times to complete licks 76\u2013100 of the PE compared with NPE rats. DBS was administered during pre-exposure and conditioning only. In the pre-exposure session, rats were continuously stimulated. In the conditioning session, stimulation was halted for the duration of each shock.\n2.4.3. Neuroimaging\nFor each rat, two PET scans were acquired 48 h apart. Animals were injected with the [\n18\nF]-FDG (~1 mCi) into the tail vein. 45 min later scans were obtained. DBS was conducted during the uptake period. For baseline measures, rats were attached to the stimulation system but received no current. Imaging was obtained under isoflurane anesthesia (3% induction and 1.5% maintenance in 100% O\n2\n) using a small-animal PET/CT scanner (ARGUS PET/CT, SEDECAL, Madrid). Images were reconstructed using a 2D OSEM (2D ordered subsets expectation maximization algorithm) with a voxel size of 0.3875 \u00d7 0.3875 \u00d7 0.7750 mm\n3\n. Energy window was 400\u2013700 keV and decay and dead time corrections were applied. CT scans were acquired with the following parameters: 320 mA, 45 KV, 360 projections, 8 shots, and 200 \u03bcm of resolution. Images were reconstructed using a Feldkamp algorithm (isotropic voxel size of 0.121 mm). In addition, an MRI study of a non-operated animal was acquired in a 7-Tesla Biospec 70/20 scanner (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) under sevoflurane anesthesia (4.5% for induction and 2.5% for maintenance in 100% O\n2\n). A T2-weighted spin echo sequence was acquired, with TE = 33 ms, TR = 3732 ms, and a slice thickness of 0.8 mm (34 slices). The matrix size was 256 \u00d7 256 and a FOV of 3.5 \u00d7 3.5 cm. This single-animal study was used as an anatomical template in order to display the results of the SPM study.\nPET data were analyzed as previously described (\nSoto-Montenegro et al., 2014\n). Briefly, CT studies were co-registered with a random reference CT scan using an automatic rigid registration method based on mutual information (\nPascau et al., 2009\n) and the spatial transformation obtained for each CT image was subsequently applied to the corresponding PET. The single MRI study was spatially co-registered to the reference CT scan. A brain mask was segmented on this MRI study and applied to all registered PET images to eliminate voxels outside the brain. The resulting images were smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian filter (2 mm FWHM) to minimize the effect of registration errors and ensure normality of data. Voxel values were normalized to the average brain intensity in order to obtain the regional characterization of metabolic changes circumventing overall differences in animal brain metabolism.\n\n2.5. Statistical analysis\nPPI data were analyzed using two way repeated measurements ANOVA with maternal immune stimulation (saline, poly I:C) and treatment (test session 1\u20133) as factors. LI data was analyzed with a three-way ANOVA (maternal immune stimulation \u00d7 DBS \u00d7 pre-exposure). Significant interactions were followed by least significant difference post hoc comparisons. PET data were analyzed using SPM12 (Statistical Parametric Mapping, version 6225, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuro-imaging, London, UK). Groups were compared using a multifactorial ANOVA with a significance threshold of p < 0.01 (corresponding to a T = 2.6), uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Factors of study were immune stimulation (saline, poly I:C) and treatment (sham, DBS). To reduce type I error, a 50-voxel clustering threshold (spatial-extent) was applied and no significant regions smaller than 50 connected activated voxels were accepted."

    "Methods": "A recurrent problem impairing the determination of myelin composition was the lack of a purification method until the 1970s. The earliest procedures were published in 1962 by Victor Whitaker in England and Eduardo de Robertis in Argentina, who isolated multiple brain membrane fractions including nerve endings and myelin with differential and density gradient centrifugation. William Norton (1929\u2013\u2020) at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, one of the most prominent myelin biochemists of the 20th century, improved these procedures by devising a sucrose gradient to specifically purify CNS myelin, which culminated in a landmark paper (Norton and Poduslo, 1973) effectively unlocking access to studying myelin chemistry. Norton went on to a seminal work that revealed myelin contains 70\u201385% lipid and 15\u201330% protein depending on the source; no lipid is exclusively found in myelin but enriched; large differences in lipid composition exist between CNS and PNS; and myelin is remarkably conserved for both proteins and lipids across vertebrates (review inNorton and Cammer, 1984). Considering we are still mapping the proteins of myelin, the ultimate frontier may be differences by localization -spine versus brain areas- and by oligodendrocyte subtype. Occasional investigations on myelin proteins (lipids are virtually ignored) have uncovered differences between small and large axon myelin, but the majority of studies focus on del R\u00edo-Hortega type II oligodendrocyte myelinating small and medium axons (Butt, 2013)."

    "Methods": "2.1. General animal care\nAnimal care and procedures were carried out at the University of Louisville, and were in accord with approved IACUC protocols. Sixty-six age-matched adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (180\u2013200 g; Taconic, Indianapolis, Indiana) were used for these studies [Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR): n = 20; immunohistochemistry: n = 26; electrophysiology: n = 12; behavior: n = 8]. For all surgeries, rats were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (i.p. injection; 80 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine) and body temperature was monitored and maintained at 36 \u00b0C throughout the surgeries which lasted 20\u201330 min. Puralube ointment (Dechra) was used to protect the rat\u2019s eyes during surgery. Following surgery, rats were given lactated ringer\u2019s solution (5 cm\n3\n, i.p.) to prevent dehydration, and gentamycin (Gentafuse; 0.1 cm\n3\n, i.m., every other day for 7 days) to prevent infection. Rats were monitored daily and housed individually throughout the experiment.\n\n2.2. Surgical procedures\nIncisions involved cutting the full thickness of both the hairy skin and the underlying attached cutaneous trunci muscle. Following incision, the skin was closed with Ethilon nylon suture (5-0, Ethicon), and coated with Bacitracin antibiotic ointment (Actavis) to prevent infection.\n2.2.1. Experimental incision\nThe experimental incision used to examine the molecular, histological and physiological changes in the DRG neurons, as well as behavioral changes in the CTMr, was made on the\nleft side\nof the rats. It was located 1 cm lateral to the vertebral column and extended parallel to the vertebral column for 3 cm (including approximately the T7\u201312 dermatomes). The location of the incision ensured that the dorsal cutaneous nerves were not damaged by the incision. See\nFig. 1\n.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nSchematic diagrams of skin incision as a model of tissue injury. Animal models used for histology/electrophysiology (A\u2013C) and qPCR/behavior (D) are shown. Sites of skin incision and DiI injection in relation to the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), cutaneous trunci muscle (CTM), and dorsal (DCn), lateral (LCn) and ventral (VCn) cutaneous nerves are indicated in D. In the histology/electrophysiology studies, an initial skin incision was made through the hairy skin (A) to allow DiI injections into the contralateral skin (B). Ten days later, the experimental incision was made immediately lateral to the site of DiI injection (C). For the qPCR/behavior studies (D), a single incision was made through the hairy skin.\n2.2.2. Tracer incision\nFor rats in which DRGs were to be examined histologically or electrophysiologically, an additional skin incision was made,\non the right side\n, seven days prior to the experimental skin incision to allow for tracer injection and transport. This skin incision to enable tracer injection was placed on the right side to prevent damage to the axons of interest on the left side. Following incision on the right side, the skin was reflected to expose the underside of the contralateral (left) skin. 0.5% DiI (1,1\u2032-dilinoleyl-3,3,3\u2032,3\u2032-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; 5 mg FastDiI dissolved in 1 ml methanol; Invitrogen) was injected into the subdermal layer using a Hamilton syringe. Ten injections of 1 \u03bcl each, were used to target the terminal field as described previously (\nJiang et al., 2006\n;\nRau et al., 2007\n). The Experimental Incision was approximately 5 mm distal\nto\n, and extended at least two dermatomes rostral and caudal\nfrom\nthe DiI injected region (see\nFig. 1\n). Preliminary studies indicated that this method maximized the percentage of DiI-labeled cells that were injured by incision, as indicated by ATF3/DiI co-localization.\n\n2.3. Behavioral analysis\nThe CTMr was used to assess pain-related behavioral changes after incision. Use of this reflex as a model system has been described in detail previously (\nPetruska et al., 2014\n). Prior to recording, animals were sedated with pentobarbital (35 mg/kg), to which the CTMr is highly resistant. A standardized matrix of dots (5 mm apart) was drawn on the back skin (\nFig. 2A\n). Calibrated Adson forceps were used to apply a standardized noxious mechanical stimulus to select points on the left side of the animal, adjacent to the incision site (or equivalent in non-incised animals). Adson forceps (dull tips) were used as opposed to #5 Dumont forceps (sharp tips). This prevented dual-activation of the CTMr which occurs with Dumont forceps \u2014 first by \u201cpin-prick\u201d stimulus when the sharp tips contact the skin, and second by the pinch. Use of the Adson forceps significantly reduced the variability in the reflex data. Video capture and semi-automated biokinematic processing of the reflex movement was acquired using MaxTRAQ software (Innovision Systems). Video motion data was compiled using a custom plug-in for Microsoft Excel.\nFig. 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nSkin incision induces long-term sensitization of a nociceptive reflex. Schematic shows key aspects of CTMr biokinematics (A). Mechanical pinch is applied to the skin (red square) adjacent to the incision site (red line). Movement of the dots is quantified rostral to the stimulus site (blue circles; focus of CTMr is 1 mm rostral to stimulus). Mean contraction distance (B), contraction rate (C), and post-stimulus relaxation time (D), are shown for the regions of interest (blue circles in A), in control and skin incised animals (n = 4 animals per group; 28 DPI). Error bars are SEM; significance determined by ANOVA. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\n2.4. Sample generation\nIt is important to note for the following sections that the thoracic DRG used to assess the effects of skin incision do not contain neurons innervating the underlying CTM. The sensory innervation of the thin CTM that is inserted along the back skin differs from the overlying skin \u2013 it arises from DRG in the brachial region (see\nPetruska et al., 2014\n).\nThe range of time points examined (4\u201328 days post-incision) encompasses both sub-acute time points in which inflammation-related mechanisms are known to be at play, and later times points when inflammation has typically resolved (\u2265 10\u201314 days). This range also encompasses the majority of the wound healing process. The skin is closed (surface wound contraction) to the point where sutures and/or staples can be removed by 7\u201310 days. Numerous prior studies using the same back skin-incision model indicate that the majority of injury conditions (e.g., hypoxia) and the microscale repair processes (e.g., vascular remodeling) are completed between 14 and 21 days after incision and closure (e.g.,\nLokmic et al., 2006\n;\nSoybir et al., 2012\n;\nGong et al., 2013\n;\nKang et al., 2013\n;\nFarahpour et al., 2015\n), though other aspects take longer. For example, the vascular volume density and vascular proliferation return to non-injured levels within 10\u201314 days after injury, although refined remodeling continues for up to 16 weeks (\nLokmic et al., 2006\n). By day 21 the stiffness of healed skin tissue recovers to 97% of its pre-wounded state and the tensile strength approaches 50% (\nChao et al., 2013\n).\n2.4.1. Tissue for RT-qPCR analysis\nRats received an experimental incision (n = 16) and tissue was collected 4, 7, 14 or 28 days post-incision (DPI: n = 4/time point). A control group of rats received no experimental incision (n = 4). For tissue collection, rats were euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital and transcardially exsanguinated with heparinized phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). This was followed by 33% vol/vol RNAlater (Qiagen) in heparinized PBS to help preserve the RNA. Three adjacent DRGs with projections to the incision site (typically T10\u2013T12; innervation of incision site confirmed by gross-anatomical dissection) were collected, pooled together, and placed in 100% RNAlater overnight at 4 \u00b0C and then stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until RNA isolation.\n2.4.2. Tissue for histological analysis\nA group of rats (n = 6) received a tracer incision and an injection of 0.5% DiI into the future site of the experimental incision. Seven days later, the time required for the injected tracer to be transported back to the cell-bodies in the DRG, half of the rats received the experimental incision (n = 3). The remaining rats (n = 3) served as no skin-incision controls. Seven days after the experimental incision, tissue was collected (see below). Tissue from this group of rats was used to examine the neurochemical response of DRG neurons innervating the site of injection/incision.\nA second group of rats received an experimental incision (without tracer injection) and tissue was collected 4, 7, 14 or 28 days post-incision (DPI: n = 4/time point). An additional cohort of rats in this group received no skin-incision (n = 4) and served as no skin-incision controls. Tissue from these rats was assessed using stereology.\nFor tissue collection for histology, rats were euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital and transcardially exsanguinated with heparinized PBS (pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. DRGs with anatomically-confirmed projections to the site of skin incision were collected, post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight and cryopreserved in 30% sucrose-PBS prior to embedding in OCT matrix.\n2.4.3. Tissue for electrophysiological studies\nRats (n = 12) received a tracer incision and injection of 0.5% DiI into the future site of the experimental incision. Seven days later, half of the rats received an experimental incision (n = 6). The remaining rats (n = 6) served as no experimental skin-incision controls. Twenty-eight days post skin incision, rats were terminally euthanized and exsanguinated as described above (without PFA). DRGs with anatomically-confirmed projections to the DiI-labeled zone were retrieved and processed for patch clamping and subsequent immunohistochemistry.\n\n2.5. RNA isolation\nTo isolate RNA from the DRGs, samples were placed on ice and 350 \u03bcl RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen) and 2-mercaptoethanol was added. Tissue was homogenized for 1 min using a motorized dual Teflon glass homogenizer (Kontes). RNA was extracted using the RNeasy plus micro kit (Qiagen) as per manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Genomic DNA was removed using the DNA eliminator affinity spin column and RNA was purified by affinity purification using RNA spin columns. Samples were eluted in 14 \u03bcl of nuclease free water. RNA integrity was assessed by UV spectrometry and the Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). RNA samples with 260 nm/280 nm ratios above 1.9 and 260 nm/230 nm ratios and RNA integrity numbers above 1.8 were used for RT-qPCR.\n\n2.6. RT-qPCR\nRT-qPCR was used to quantify the expression of genes within DRGs following skin incision. We examined ATF3, Growth Associated Protein-43 (GAP-43) and Neuropeptide Y (NPY) within the DRGs, which are all known to be upregulated after nerve injury, and are involved in neural plasticity (\nVan der Zee et al., 1989\n;\nTsujino et al., 2000\n;\nTsai et al., 2007\n). We previously reported an acute increase in ATF3 and GAP-43 in DRGs following skin incision (\nHill et al., 2010\n).\ncDNA was generated from the RNA samples using the Quantitect first strand synthesis kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For each PCR reaction, 5 ng of cDNA template was used. Samples were run in triplicate, and control reactions (without template) were included with every amplification run. SYBR green RT-qPCR was carried out using a Rotorgene real time PCR detection instrument (Corbett Research, now Qiagen, Inc.). Relative fold-changes of RNA were calculated by the \u0394\u0394CT method using GAPDH as the stable internal reference gene. Small differences in RT-qPCR reaction efficiency between primer sets were accounted for using the standard curve quantification methods. Primer details are shown in\nTable 1\n.\nTable 1.\nDetails of primers used for qPCR assays.\nGene\nAccession #\nForward primer (5\u2032\u20133\u2032)\nTm (\u00b0C)\nReverse primer (5\u2032\u20133\u2032)\nTm (\u00b0C)\nGAPDH\nNP_058704\nATGGCCTTCCGTGTTCCTAC\n65.00\nAGACAACCTGGTCCTCCTCAGTG\n61.90\nATF3\nNP_037044\nGAGATGTCAGTCACCAAGTC\n60.05\nTTCTTCAGCTCCTCGATCTG\n61.36\nGAP-43\nNP_058891\nCTAAACAAGCCGATGTGCC\n63.20\nTTCTTTACCCTCATCCTGTCG\n62.90\nNPY\nNP_036746\nCAGACAGAGATATGGCAAGAG\n59.98\nGAGAGCAAGTTTCATTTCCC\n59.12\nOpen in a new tab\n\n2.7. Cryosectioning\nDRGs were embedded in OCT compound and cryostat sectioned at 14 \u03bcm. For DiI-labeled DRG, serial sections were mounted across 6 slides. This yielded individual slides with sections sampling the DRG every 84 \u03bcm. For studies using non-DiI-traced DRGs, serial sections were mounted on 8 slides, such that there was at least 112 \u03bcm between each section on a given slide. The spacing between sections ensured that no single neuron could be counted more than once on any given slide.\n\n2.8. Histochemistry\nIn order to determine if skin incision induced an injury-like response in sensory neurons we assessed the expression of markers known to be affected by nerve-injury. ATF3, GAP-43 and NPY are upregulated after nerve injury. We also assessed the expression of two other markers in the DRG whose expression decreases in response to nerve injury \u2014calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CAMK4;\nJi et al., 1996\n) and isolectin B4 (IB4)-binding (\nBennett et al., 1998\n). Reagents used were: ATF3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, rabbit polyclonal, Catalog # SC-188), GAP-43 (EnCor Biotech. Inc., chicken polyclonal, Catalog # CPCA-GAP-43), NPY (Neuromics, Guinea pig polyclonal, Catalog # GP14017), CAMK4 (BD Biosciences, mouse monoclonal, Catalog # 610275), Neuronal Nuclei (NeuN; Millipore, mouse monoclonal, Catalog # MAB377), and IB4-binding (Invitrogen, lectin IB4-Alexa-488, Catalog #\nI21411\n). All primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 and the lectin at 1:100. Appropriate Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, Alexa-350 or Alexa-488) were used at 1:100 for ATF3, NPY, CAMK4, and NeuN staining. Biotin-conjugated goat-anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used for GAP-43 immunohistochemistry and visualized as described below.\nSections were blocked with 3.3% normal goat serum, 0.4% Triton-X 100, and PBS for 1 h to prevent non-specific binding. All wash steps following antibody application used this same blocking solution. Primary antibodies for ATF3 and one of the other protein markers were applied overnight, rinsed the next morning, and appropriate species-specific secondary antibodies were then applied for 3 h. Detection of GAP-43\u2019 involved additional amplifications steps, in which the secondary antibody step was followed by sequential applications of Avidin-Biotin Complex reagent (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Labs), biotinylated tyramide signal amplification reagent (Molecular Probes TSA-biotin, Invitrogen), and Dylight-488 conjugated to Steptavidin (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Controls included performing a dilution series of primary antibody, and omission of individual steps (i.e. primary antibody, secondary antibody, amplification). For some sections, Hoechst dye (1:1000) was applied after incubation of the secondary antibodies to visualize all nuclei. Immunoreactivity is defined as antigen-like.\n\n2.9. Microscopy and image analysis\nTwo different sets of DRG sections were used to make two separate assessments of the neurochemical response of sensory neurons to incision of the skin they innervated. One approach used stereological methods to quantify the number of ATF3-expressing neurons in the DRG. The other approach assessed the relative intensity of four different injury-related markers in retrogradely-traced neurons. Both methods also assessed the size distribution of the quantified neurons. All procedures were carried out by experimenters blinded to the treatment group.\n2.9.1. Stereological quantification of ATF3 expression\nTissue sections were examined on an inverted Zeiss 200 M microscope equipped with digital image acquisition and StereoInvestigator software (MicrobrightField, Inc., Williston, VT). StereoInvestigator was used to quantify the number of neurons expressing specific markers as previously described (\nHill et al., 2010\n), and also characterize the neurons according to size. For each DRG, every 4th tissue section was traced at 10\u00d7 magnification using DAPI visualization to define neurons and subsequently quantified at 63\u00d7.\n2.9.1.1. Number of ATF3\n+\nneurons\nSections were immunolabeled as described above to simultaneously visualize ATF3 and GAP-43 proteins. The number of ATF3\n+\n/GAP-43\n+\nand ATF3\n+\n/GAP-43\n\u2212\nneurons within the DRGs was quantified in tissue samples from skin-incision rats (4, 7, 14 and 28 days post-skin-incision) as well as non-skin-incision rats (n = 4/condition). The optical fractionator function was used to \u00f5determine the number of neurons that expressed ATF3 and classify them based on whether or not they also expressed GAP-43, a second marker of neuronal injury (counting frame = 100 \u03bcm \u00d7 100 \u03bcm; grid size = 200 \u03bcm \u00d7 200 \u03bcm).\n2.9.1.2. Somal size of ATF3\n+\nneurons\nThe volume of the ATF3\n+\nneurons (GAP-43\n+\nand GAP-43\n\u2212\n), initially identified with the optical fractionator function, were subsequently quantified using the nucleator function.\n2.9.2. Relative expression intensity of injury-related markers\nWe also determined the relative staining intensity of GAP-43, NPY, CAMK4 and IB4-binding for DiI-labeled neurons. Images were acquired using a Nikon TiE automated inverted microscope with a Digital Sight DS-Ri1 Digital Camera and Nikon Elements BR software and analyzed using methods similar to those previously described (\nBurgess et al., 2010\n). Four to 8 sections per animal were used for imaging. Individual cells to be quantified were identified and manually outlined. Cells were included if they had a visible nucleus (indicated by ATF3 and/or NeuN) and were DiI\n+\n. For DRG serving incised skin (Incision group), only neurons with both DiI and ATF3 were counted (n = 1590). For DRG serving non-incised skin (Control group), all DiI-labeled cells were counted (n = 2603 cells).\nBackground corrections were used to normalize staining intensities across slides and groups. First, background-subtraction was performed on a per-section basis. A region of each section (about the size of 3 neurons) with no staining was selected. This was usually in the ventral root, and manual comparisons were made to ensure this region had the lowest-intensity of the section. The mean intensity value of this \u201cbackground\u201d region was then calculated and this was subtracted from the raw intensity values of all neurons in that section.\nBecause the slide is the fundamental unit of histological processing, the range of background-corrected intensity values for each channel was normalized on a per-slide basis according to the equation:\nneuron\nmean\nintensity\n=\n[\n(\n\u201c\nRaw\ncellular-mean-intensity\n\u201d\n-\n\u201c\nminimum-intensity\n\u201d\n)\n\u2217\n(\n100\n/\n(\n\u201c\nmaximum-intensity\n\u201d\n-\n\u201c\nminimum-intensity\n\u201d\n)\n)\n]\nFor this, \u201cminimum-intensity\u201d is the mean somal intensity of the neuron with the weakest staining for GAP-43, NPY, CAMK4 or IB4-binding, and \u201cmaximum-intensity\u201d is the mean somal intensity of the neuron with the strongest staining for GAP-43, NPY, CAMK4 or IB4-binding. Thus, the raw mean-intensity value (the mean intensity of the entire somal area) for each neuron was converted to a percentage value, with the weakest-labeled-neuron defining 0%, and the strongest-labeled-neuron defining 100%. This normalizes any slide-to-slide variation inherent in the procedures. This approach of background-correction and normalization provides an indication of relative intensity without making any claims about the positivity/negativity of expression for any given neuron.\nThe size of each counted cell was calculated as the average between the minimum and maximum cell diameters. Based on the average diameter of the soma, DRG neurons were classified as either small (<30 \u03bcm), medium (30\u201345 \u03bcm) or large (>45 \u03bcm) for subsequent analysis.\n\n2.10. DRG dissociations for electrophysiology\nDRGs were isolated, dissociated and plated as previously described (\nPetruska et al., 2000\n,\n2002\n). DRGs were digested enzymatically with dispase (neutral protease, 5 mg/ml; Boehringer Mannheim) and collagenase (type 1, 2 mg/ml; Sigma) in Tyrode\u2019s solution for 90 min (35 \u00b0C). The DRGs were gently triturated every 30 min to dissociate the cells. Following enzymatic treatment and dissociation, cells were pelleted by centrifugation (800 rpm, 3 min), resuspended in fresh Tyrode\u2019s solution and plated onto poly-L-lysine (Sigma)-coated dishes. Prior to recording, dishes were kept in an aerated holding bath for at least 2 h. All recordings were made within 10 h of DRG retrieval from the animal, a time frame prior to translation of ATF3 (\nRau et al., 2014\n) \u2013 i.e., the ATF3 expression in dissociated/recorded neurons we described was due to the skin incision and not to the dissociation process.\n\n2.11. Electrophysiology\nWhole-cell patch recording was used to determine the electrophysiological properties of individually isolated DiI-labeled neurons (i.e., those that had projected to the site of the skin incision). In total 55 DRG neurons were assessed [skin-incision (incision group): n = 23; no-skin incision (control group): n = 32]. Electrophysiology was performed as previously described in detail (\nPetruska et al., 2000\n,\n2002\n). Recordings were performed with a Scientifica SliceScope Pro system. Electrodes were prepared (2\u20134 M\u03a9) from glass pipettes using a horizontal puller (Sutter model P1000). Electrophysiology solutions: Extracellular (Tyrode\u2019s) solution consisted of 140 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The recording electrodes were filled with 120 mM KCl, 5 mM Na\n2\n-ATP, 0.4 mM Na\n2\n-GTP, 5 mM EGTA, 2.25 mM CaCl\n2\n, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, and 20 mM HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH; osmolarity was ~315\u2013325 mOsm.\nDiI-labeled neurons were identified by briefly illuminating the dish using epifluorescence microscopy (total exposure of field <1 min). Once identified, whole cell recordings were made with an Axoclamp 2B (Molecular Devices). Stimuli were controlled and digital records captured with pClamp10 software and a Digidata 1440 (Molecular Devices). Series resistance (R\nS\n) was compensated 50\u201370%. Whole cell resistance (R\nM\n) and capacitance was assessed by pClamp software from voltage transients associated with small step commands (10 mV). All experiments were conducted at room temperature. Only cells having a resting membrane potential (RMP) of \u221240 to \u221270 mV were included in this study.\nAfter obtaining and stabilizing individual DRG neurons under whole cell patch clamp in voltage-clamp mode, cells were brought into current-clamp mode to assess changes in membrane potential. In order to assess cellular excitability we determined rheobase (the minimum current needed for action potential generation). In order to assess cellular responsiveness we determined action potential frequency (mean, maximum and instantaneous) in response to standardized depolarizing current steps. In order to determine if there were changes to the currents underlying action potentials, we measured certain parameters. Action potentials were evoked through a 1 ms, 2 nA current step. The average of ten action potentials was used to determine after-hyperpolarization duration of 80% recovery to baseline (\nDjouhri et al., 1998\n), and after-hyperpolarization amplitude (decrease in voltage from RMP to the lowest point of the after-hyperpolarization). After-hyperpolarization parameters can affect the firing frequency of the neuron. Action potential threshold and action potential duration at threshold (APDt) were determined at rheobase on top of 500-ms square pulses increased in 50-pA increments every 2 s (and further refined using 5-pA increments). Threshold was defined as the membrane potential at which the rate of voltage change exceeded 5 V/s, and was determined using the first derivative of the action potential waveform (\nDavidson et al., 2014\n). Action potential threshold dictates how easily the neurons can be induced to fire. APDt was measured as the time from the first upward deflection of the action potential waveform to its return to the threshold membrane potential. APDt can influence maximum firing frequency. Numbers of evoked action potentials and peak instantaneous frequency were determined using increasing voltage steps (1-second stimulus duration, 10-second interstimulus duration; stimuli were increased in 50-pA steps over 20 sweeps, resulting in evoked current recordings from 50 to 1000 pA). All measurements of electrophysiological recordings were performed using Clampfit analysis software.\nOnly one cell was recorded per dish. After recording was completed, the recorded cell was marked for later identification by physically marking the cell location on the underside of the plastic culture dish and capturing a digital image with a Scientifica monochrome camera using SCIght 2.0 image capture software. The bath solution was replaced with 4% PFA in PBS for 10 min and then repeatedly rinsed and replaced with a 100% PBS solution. Cells were stored at 4 \u00b0C until the immunolabeling procedures were performed. Immunocytochemistry procedures to examine ATF3 expression within individual DRG neurons in dishes following electrophysiological recordings were performed as described above for tissue sections. Recorded/immunolabeled cells were then located and characterized as described in the Microscopy and Image Analysis section above. Eighty-four percent of recorded neurons were subsequently recovered and analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The electrophysiological data for those neurons not recovered for immunohistochemistry are included in the \u201call\u201d group data listed in Fig. 6.\n\n2.12. Statistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using SigmaPlot/SigmaStat (Systat Software, San Jose, CA, USA). First-pass analysis to examine differences between the skin-incised and control groups for all assessments was done using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and was followed by pair-wise comparisons (Student-Newman-Keuls). ANOVA on ranks was used to compare distributions that failed normality testing (common for gene expression that is \u201coff-to-on\u201d as it is for ATF3 expression), and was followed either by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or Holm-Sidak method. For some comparisons, other methods were also used and are indicated in the text and/or figure legends.\nFor image analysis, some comparisons synthesized the data from individual neurons into a representative value for the animal. This value was then used as the single-animal-value for comparisons in which the degrees of freedom equaled the number of animals and the groups were compared (i.e., skin-incised vs. control). For other comparisons, such as the relative-intensity of the various markers in individual cells, the degrees of freedom equaled the number of cells. Where degrees of freedom equal number of cells, we have ensured (by ANOVA) that the number of cells/animal are statistically equivalent in terms of 1) the number of cells, and 2) their size/frequency distribution. This reduces the opportunity for data from any given animal to bias the overall data. For electrophysiological comparisons, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s post-hoc\nt\n-test was used to compare properties between the skin-incised and control groups as a whole, as well as to compare the groups using neuron populations broken up based on ATF3 expression (i.e., ATF3\n+\ncells in skin-incised group vs. control group and ATF3\n\u2212\ncells in skin-incised group vs. control group). Analysis of potential differences in electrophysiological properties between ATF3\n+\nand ATF3\n\u2212\nneurons was performed using the binomial proportion test (\nSiegel and Castellan, 1988\n). Differences were considered to be statistically significant if p < 0.05. Data is presented as mean \u00b1 standard error."

    "Methods": "Lentiviral vector construction and production\nThe wild-type Rheb (wtRheb) lentivirus vector was generated by PCR subcloning (the primers: 5\u2019-AGCTCTAGAGCCATGGAGCAGAAGCTGATC-\u20183;3\u2019-AGCACCGGATATCACATCACCGAGCACGA-\u20185) from pRK5-myc-wtRheb (kindly provided by Karyn Esser, University of Kentucky, Lexington, USA) into the XbaI/AgeI sites of pCSC-SP-PW vector. The constitutively active mutant RHEB (caRheb) was obtained from Zhigang He (Harvard University, Boston, USA). To generate the caRheb lentiviral vector, PCR amplified 3HA-caRheb (the primers: 5\u2019-CCAGCTCTAGAATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAG-\u20183; 3\u2019-AGCACCGGTATATCACATCACCGAGCACGA-\u20185) and the fragment was ligated to XbaI/AgeI sites of pCSC-SP-PW vector. The pCSC-SP-PW vector contains the cytomegalovirus promoter to drive the expression of either wtRheb or caRheb. The successful recombination of these two vectors were screened by restriction enzyme analyses and verified by DNA sequencing (GENEWIZ, South Plainfield, NJ).Viral stocks were generated by calcium-phosphate transfection of 293T cells with plasmid encoding either Rheb,NT3 or GFP, Mb1, Rev and VSV-G plasmid encoding envelope glycoprotein. The supernatants were collected 72 hours after transfection and concentrated by ultracentrifugation and the viral pellet was aliquoted and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C until further use. The titers of Rheb, NT3 and GFP lentivirus were measured by using Aalto p24 ELISA DIY Kit (Aalto, Ireland).\n\nAAV vector construction and production\nRecombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) carrying GFP or caRheb (kindly provided by Zhigang He, Harvard University, Boston, USA) was generated by helper virus-free system (\nAyuso et al., 2010\n). 293T cells were grown to 70\u201380% confluence at which point they were transfected with two packaging plasmids using PEI (Polyethylenimine, linear, MW-25k, Warrington, PA): one carrying the AAV rep, cap genes and another helper plasmid carrying the adenovirus helper functions. Three days after transfection, the cell lysates and the supernatant were harvested and 40% PEG 8000 was added to precipitate crude virus for 2 hours. Then the viruses were purified by double-centrifugation with cesium chloride (CsCl) and the isolated virus was dialyzed in 0.1M PBS/5% sorbital overnight (\nAyuso et al., 2010\n;\nLiu et al., 2014\n). The titers of AAV-GFP and Rheb used in this study were determined by infecting fibroblast cells. The use of fibroblast cells allows for AAV2 vector to induce rapid transgene expression. Serial dilutions of AAV2-GFP and Rheb vectors were added to a 24-well plate, which had been seeded with 0.5 \u00d7 10\n5\nfibroblast cells per well. After one day, fibroblasts cells expressing GFP or HA with staining were counted under the fluorescence microscope to determine the vector titer per ml and the genomic copy titer/mL (GC/mL). The viral titer of AAV2-GFP and AAV2-Rheb was found to be 1.6 \u00d7 10\n12\nand 1.2 \u00d7 10\n12\nGC/mL, respectively.\n\nAdult sensory neuron culture, transduction and immunocytochemistry\nAdult female Sprague Dawley rats (150\u2013200g, Harlan) were killed and DRGs were dissected. Following a 60 min digestion in 0.125% collagenase at 37\u00b0C, the DRGs were mechanically dissociated by trituration and centrifuged through a 12.5%/28% Percoll gradient. The dissociated neurons were resuspended in Neurobasal A medium with B27 supplement and plated on poly-d-lysine coated glass coverslip (0.1 mg/ml), (\nSmith et al., 2013\n). Six hours after plating, DRG cultures were infected with 1 \u00d7 10\n5\nunits of lentivirus per well in 12-well plate. For these studies, lentivirus was used because it induces rapid transgene expression and labels multiple DRG neuronal subpopulations (\nYu et al., 2011\n). For mTOR inhibition experiment, rapamycin (Rap, 50 nM) was added to the culture medium after one day in vitro. For immunocytochemistry, the neurons were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min after 72 h in culture and were blocked with 10% goat serum, 1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min and then were incubated with a chicken anti-Neurofilament-medium (NF-M) antibody (1: 1000, Neuromics, Edina, MN) and rabbit anti-phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein (1:100, Cell Signaling) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The samples were rinsed three times 15 minutes each, incubated with Texas red-anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and AMCA-anti-chicken IgG (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at room temperature for 90 min. The neurons were identified by NF-M labeling and the cells that were either GFP/NF-M positive or Myc or HA/NF-M positive were imaged using a Zeiss LSM5 microscope system. For quantification of neurite outgrowth, the length of the neurite for the first 150\u2013200 neurons encountered was determined using Image J analysis software.\n\nWestern blot\nThe same treatment was performed on 293T cells, U373 cells, DRG neurons or tissues harvested from E14 embryo, P1, P5, P18 and adult rats. The cells or tissue was lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100, 3% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, and 1mM EDTA containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitor. Equal quantities of total protein were loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia). After blocking in 5% milk for 1 hour at room temperature, the blots were incubated with anti-pS6 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), anti-\u03b2 actin (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GAPDH (1:1000, Cell Signaling), anti-Rheb (1:500, R&D systems), anti-HA (1:500, Roche) or anti-Myc (1: 200, DSHB) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The corresponding conjugated second antibodies donkey anti-rabbit IRDye-800CW and goat anti-mouse IRdye-680CW (1:20,000; Invitrogen) were added the next day and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Fluorescent blots were imaged on the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). For quantitation of bands, the blots were scanned on a two-channel infrared Odyssey scanner, the band intensities were quantified using the Odyssey software (LI-COR Biosciences) and normalized to GAPDH levels. Experiments were performed in three individual replicates.\n\nAnimals\nA total of sixty adult female Sprague Dawley rats (175\u2013200g) (Harlan) were used in this study. All surgical interventions and postoperative animal care were provided in accordance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals, and the guidelines for rodent survival surgery provided by the Animal Care and Use Committees of Temple University.\nCongenic Nogo/OMgp/MAG triple knockout mice were generated by breeding congenice lines of Nogo/OMgp double knockout mice obtained from Dr. Binhai Zheng (University of California at San Diego) and of MAG knockout mice obtained from Dr. Jae K. Lee (University of Miami). 2\u20133 months old, both sexes of Nogo\n\u2212/\u2212\n/OMgp\n\u2212/\u2212\n/MAG\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice and age-matched C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were used. Mice were genotyped at the time of weaning by tail clipping and PCR analysis using the primers in earlier study (\nLee et al., 2010\n).\n\nSurgical procedures\nThe rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (67mg/kg) and xylazine (6.7 mg/kg). A hemilaminectomy was performed under aseptic conditions at the T13-L2 vertebral segments and the dura was opened with fine scissors. Dorsal roots L3\u2013L6 were identified and exposed. With the use of #5 Dumont forceps, triple-crush lesions of 10 seconds were inflicted at two sites separated by 3mm along the right L4 and L5 afferents at 5\u20138 mm from dorsal root entry zone (DREZ). Dorsal roots L3 and L6 were tightly ligated at two regions, 1\u20132mm apart with 6.0 silk suture and then a complete cut was made through these roots to create a zone of denervation immediately rostral and caudal to L4/L5 (\nRomero et al., 2001\n;\nTang et al., 2004\n). All lesions were performed unilaterally. The spinal cord at T13-L1 was exposed to identify the right L4 and L5 DREZ. Eight injections of 0.3\u00b5l lentivirus spaced 0.5 mm apart rostro-caudally along the DREZ at L4\u2013L5 spinal segments (a total of minimum 1 \u00d7 10\n7\nviral particles), were delivered using a beveled glass micropipette pulled to a diameter of between 30 and 50 \u00b5m. Injections were made at a rate of 5 nl/sec using a nano-injector (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) at a precise depth of 0.7mm from the spinal cord dorsal surface using the coordinates on a M3301 fine micromanipulator (Narishige via World Precision Instruments). In order to label sensory axons with AAV-GFP and concurrent expression of Rheb, the AAV vectors were prepared by mixing either AAV2-Rheb with AAV2-GFP viruses at a 1:1 ratio. Two microliters of viral vector was injected into DRGs. DRG injections were performed using a nanoliter injection system (Nanoliter 2000, World Precision Instruments) mounted on a micromanipulator. Beveled tips with diameters of 20 to 40\u00b5m were used for this purpose. AAV vectors were injected at a rate of 0.10 \u00b5l /min using a Micro4 microsyringe pump controller (World Precision Instruments) and the pipette was left in place for 5 min before removal to allow viral fluid to distribute. Care was taken to avoid excess trauma to the DRG. Immediately following the injection, triple dorsal root crush 10 seconds each, repeated three times) was performed on left lumbar dorsal roots (\nLiu et al., 2014\n). The muscle was closed in layers and the skin was closed with staples. After surgery, the rats were placed on a temperature controlled heating pad to allow the animal to recover.\nThe survival surgery of mice was conducted as described before (\nDi Maio et al., 2011\n). Briefly, L3\u2013S1 spinal cord segments were exposed by hemilaminectomy. A small incision was made in the dura overlying the L5 dorsal root near the L4 DRG. A fine forceps (Dumont #5) was introduced subdurally, and the L4 and L5 dorsal root was crushed for 10 seconds. For lentivirus injections, a glass pipet filled with NT3-lentivirus and attached to a micromanipulator (Nano2000 microinjector, World Precision Instruments) was lowered to the L4 and L5 DREZ and inserted into the dorsal horn. A total of five injection sites spanning rostro-caudally along the L4/L5 DREZ were injected, and each site received 120 nl of lentivirus. Infusions were made at a rate of 100 nl/min. After injection, the glass pipette was left in place for an additional 3 minutes before being slowly retracted. A piece of thin synthetic matrix membrane (Biobrane, Bertek Pharmaceuticals) was tightly applied over the exposed spinal cord to minimize scar accumulation on the dura. The musculature and skin were closed with sterile 5-0 sutures and wound clips, respectively. After surgery, mice were given subcutaneous injections of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution to prevent dehydration, and kept on a heating pad until fully recovered from anesthesia. Buprenorphine was given as postoperative analgesia (0.05 mg/kg, subcutaneously every 12 hr for 2 days).\n\nCTB labeling and sciatic nerve injections\nTo identify regeneration of large caliber myelinated axons, a 2% solution of alexa fluor labeled (594) cholera toxin B (CTB) (Invitrogen) in PBS was injected into all animals 7\u201310 days prior to sacrifice. For these studies a small incision was made in the skin along the posterior thigh to expose the gluteus muscle. The muscle was separated to expose the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve was injected with 2 \u2013 3 ul of 2% cholera toxin B subunit using a Hamilton syringe with a 30 gauge needle.\n\nTissue processing and immunohistochemistry\nFour weeks after dorsal root crushes, animals were sacrificed by injection of Fatal-Plus (Dearborn, MI) and perfused transcardially with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4). For pS6 expression study of non-injured animals, DRGs were harvested from adult and postnatal 2 days Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan). The spinal cords with attached dorsal roots and DRGs were removed, post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C overnight and moved to 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PBS at 4\u00b0C for 2\u20133 days. Tissue blocks were embedded in M-1 Embedding Matrix (Kalamazoo, MI) and quick frozen on dry-ice. The spinal cords with attached DRGs were transversely sectioned at 16 \u00b5m using a cryostat and mounted directly on slides (Superfrost Plus; VWR International). For staining, the sections were permeabilized and non-specific antigenic sites blocked with 0.3% Triton X-100/10% normal goat serum in 0.1M PBS for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with rabbit anti-phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein (1:100, Cell Signaling), mouse anti- \u03b2III tubulin antibody (1:1000, Promega), mouse anti-Neurofilament-200 (NF-200) antibody (RT-97, 1:200, DSHB), mouse anti-Myc antibody (1: 200, DSHB), mouse anti-HA antibody (1:200, Roche), rabbit anti-laminin antibody (1: 100, Sigma) at 4\u00b0C overnight. In order to increase GFP signals, some sections were stained with a mouse-anti-GFP antibody (1:500, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). In most cases, the sections were viewed directly for GFP fluorescence. The samples were rinsed three times, incubated with Texas red-anti-rabbit, Texas red-anti-mouse, FITC-anti-rabbit IgG, FITC-antimouse IgG or AMCA-anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at room temperature for 90 min. After staining, sections were coverslip-mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, San Diego, CA) and photographed under a Nikon microscope. To examine axonal regeneration through the DREZ, we counted the number of GFP or CTB labeled axons crossing the DREZ.\n\nMicroscopy and image analysis\nImages from CTB labeled sections were acquired using confocal microscopy (Nikon C2). Z stacked images were acquired at 564 nm. Images were captured at both 10\u00d7 and 20\u00d7 magnifications to allow a clear representation of regenerating axons. To quantify the axon growth into the spinal cord, 5\u20136 sections within L4/L5 spinal cord were selected randomly from each animal. CTB axon occupying area was quantified as the total area occupied in the ipsilateral side using thresholded intensity measurements employing the image analysis software (NIS elements). Program computed the area measurements in \u00b5m\n2\n.\nFor quantitative analysis of axons crossing the DREZ in mouse, digital images were captured from three transverse sections taken randomly from L4 and L5 segment of each of three mice. A raw image was converted to a binary image using ImageJ with a threshold that appropriately separates GFP and background fluorescence. The CNS:PNS interface was defined by GFAP immunostaining and considered as the entry point of an axon that penetrated into the CNS. Lines were drawn at 100 \u00b5m and 200 \u00b5m beyond the entry point and the number of intersections of GFP-labeled axons was counted. The number of axons crossed the interface was normalized by the number of GFP-labeled axons in the PNS, counted at 100 \u00b5m before the interface in the peripheral root, which was then averaged by the number of evaluated sections and animals. This quantification resulted in the \u2018axon number index\u2019 to indicate the relative number and distance of axons that regenerated into the CNS in each group of mice. One-way ANOVA was used. Values of\np\n<0.05 were considered significant.\n\nBehavioral tests\nMechanical Hyperalgesia\nThe paw pressure test was used to measure mechanical hyperalgesia, as described by Randall and Selitto (\nRandall and Selitto, 1957\n). Briefly, animals were restrained in a mitt such that the hind paws could hang free. Each paw, in turn, was placed between the apparatus surface of an Ugo-Basil Analgesymeter and a plastic point. Increasing weight was applied to the point by means of an attached metal disc. Pressure to the paw was applied at thirty two grams per second. The end point was designated as vocalization or the pulling of the hindpaw from the apparatus, with a cutoff of 200 grams. Responses were recorded three times for both hindpaws.\n\nGridwalk test\nA custom made horizontal ladder with irregularly spaced rungs was used to test for proprioception. Animals were trained to walk on the horizontal ladder with no errors before they were subjected to any surgery. The percent efficiency in the right hindlimb was evaluated as a measure of proprioception. Before the surgery, the trained animals show 100% efficiency in right hind limb (no errors). Immediate post-crush evaluation showed a tremendous increase in foot faults or errors on the ipsilateral (right) side of lesion causing a drop in efficiency. Improvement in proprioception is expected to increase the efficiency in the right hindlimb."

    "Methods": "The \u201cphysiological\u201d neural mass model\nNeural mass models have been commonly used to study epileptic-like activity in EEG signals. We started from the model described in (\nHuneau et al., 2013\n;\nMolaee-Ardekani et al., 2010\n;\nWendling et al., 2012\n,\n2002\n) see (\nWendling et al., 2015\n) for recent review. In order to simulate epileptic signals generated in the cerebral cortex, we started from a physiologically plausible computational model at the level of neuronal assembly. For detailed description of the model, readers might refer to (\nMolaee-Ardekani et al., 2010\n).\nThe model is composed by the following sub-populations: (i) pyramidal cells (P), receiving excitatory feedback from other pyramidal cells and inhibitory feedback signals from (ii) soma- and proximal dendrite-targeting cells (I1: basket-like cells and chandelier-like cells mediating GABA\nA\n, fast currents), and (iii) dendrite-targeting cells (I2: neurogliaform-like cells mediating GABA\nA\n, slow currents) (see\nFig 1A\n). Unlike detailed network models, neural mass models do not explicitly represent individual cells and their architecture (i.e., dendrites, soma or axons) but are mainly based on synaptic connections of distinct populations of neurons. Somatic-targeting interneurons I1 refers to cells that generate PSP with a physiologically relevant time constant, similar to the IPSP produced by basket cells or chandelier cells (\nMolaee-Ardekani et al., 2010\n). Although macroscopic, this model relies on neurophysiological data and has two essential features. First, their parameters relate to excitatory and inhibitory processes taking place in the considered neuronal tissue. Second, the temporal dynamics of their output (analogous to a local field activity) can be directly compared to those reflected in real signals recorded with electrodes placed in the cerebral cortex. Indeed, it can be assumed that field potentials reflect overall dynamics arising from interconnected populations of principal neurons and interneurons.\nFig 1. Computational Neural mass model of epileptic activity.\nOpen in a new tab\n(\nA\n) Structure of the neuronal population model accounting for three sub-populations of neurons: (i) pyramidal cells (P), (ii) soma- and proximal-dendrite-targeting cells (type I1 mediating GABA\nA\n, fast currents), and (iii) dendrite-targeting cells (type I2 mediating GABA\nA\n, slow). Pyramidal cells receive excitatory input from other pyramidal cells (collateral excitation) or inhibitory input from interneurons. These latter cells receive excitatory input only from pyramidal cells. Besides synaptic transmission, interactions between neuronal subpopulations are also characterized in the model by connectivity constants (CPP, CPI\n1\n, CI\n1\nP, CI\n1\nI\n1\n, CPI\n2\n, CI\n2\nP) which account for the average number of active synaptic contacts or \u201cconnection strength\u201d between considered sub-populations. In addition, the nonspecific influence from neighboring or distant populations is represented by a Gaussian input noise\np(t)\ncorresponding to an excitatory input that globally describes the average density of afferent action potentials (Adapted from\nMolaee-Ardekani et al, 2010\n).\n(B)\nThe classical wave-to-pulse function was modified to account for the SCN1A mutation found in the Dravet syndrome. According to the neural mass modeling approach, the wave-to-pulse function relates the average pulse density of action potentials fired by the neurons\nS\nx\n(\n\u03d1\n) to the average postsynaptic potential\n\u03d1\n(in mV) and accounts for the saturation and threshold effects taking place at the soma. For a given sub-population X, it is modeled by a static nonlinear function of sigmoidal shape\nS\nx\n(\n\u03d1\n)\n=\nQ\nx\nmax\n/\n(\n1\n+\ne\nr\nx\n(\n\u03d1\nx\n-\n\u03d1\n)\n)\nwhere\nQ\nx\nmax\nis the maximum firing rate, r\nx\nis the steepness of the sigmoid and\n\u03d1\nx\nis the postsynaptic potential corresponding to a firing rate of\nQ\nx\nmax\n/\n2\n. In the proposed DS model (green line),\nQ\nx\nmax\nparameter for both inhibitory sub-populations (I1 and I2) was reduced by 40% as compared with the pyramidal cell sub-population (black solid line). This reduction accounts for a strong decrease of the maximal interneuronal firing rate found in DS.\n(\nC\n) Static depolarizing GABA. Left: In normal tissue, the high expression of chloride transporters in the GABAergic post-synaptic compartment, allows efficient extrusion of chloride outside the targeted neuron, responsible for hyperpolarized reversal potential (E\nCl\n=\u221280mV) of GABA\nA\nIPSP. Right: In epileptic tissue, the expression of chloride transporter at the membrane is decreased at least in some neurons, leading to a \u201cstatic\u201d more positive reversal potential (E\nCl\n=\u221260mV) of GABA\nA\nIPSP.\n(D)\nTime course of the average excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) in the DS model. Depolarizing GABA was implemented in the model as an excitatory signal obeying the kinetics of GABA\nA\n-mediated PSP (red line).These kinetics are defined by the time constant used the pulse-to-wave function (either excitatory or inhibitory) that determines both the rise time (t\nrise\n) and the decay time (t\ndecay\n) of the PSP. As t\nrise\nand t\ndecay\ndepend mainly on intrinsic ionotropic channel properties and as the direction of the current depends mainly on the reversal potential of chloride, we modified the direction of the depolarizing GABA\nA\nrelated PSP but not its kinetics.\n(\nE\n) Dynamic depolarizing GABA. Left: In the epileptic tissue a slightly decreased expression of the chloride transporter, could lead to normal IPSP (E\nCl\n=\u221280mV) when the interneuronal activity is low. Right: When interneurons fire with a high frequency rate, it leads to massive GABA release and chloride overload into the targeted cell, and progressively and dynamically shifts E\nCl\ntoward depolarized potential. Therefore if interneurons firing rate dramatically increases it induces a dynamic shift of GABA\nA\n-mediated post synaptic potentials from inhibitory to excitatory effect.\nAccording to the neural mass modeling approach, each subpopulation was characterized by two functions. First, the \u2018pulse-to-wave\u2019 function was a 2nd order linear transfer function\nh\n(\nt\n) =\nWwte\n\u2212\nwt\nthat transformed the average presynaptic pulse density of action potentials coming to the subpopulation of neurons into an average postsynaptic membrane potential which can be excitatory, slow inhibitory or fast inhibitory.\nAs depicted in\nFigure 1A\n, the model implements three types of \u2018pulse-to-wave\u2019 functions. The first one is AMPAergic and describes the synaptic transmission among pyramidal cells (P to P) as well as the excitatory input to both subpopulations of interneurons (P to I1 and P to I2). Its impulse response corresponds to an average EPSP and is given by the equation:\nh\nAMPA\n(\nt\n)\n=\nW\nAMPA\n\u03c4\nAMPA\nt\n.\ne\n-\nt\n/\n\u03c4\nAMPA\n.\n(eq. 1)\nThe second one is GABAergic and describes the inhibitory input (at the level of GABAa, slow receptors) from interneurons I2 to pyramidal cells (I2 to P) and to interneurons I1 (I2 to I1). Its impulse response is given by the equation:\nh\nGABAa\n,\ns\n(\nt\n)\n=\nW\nGABAa\n,\ns\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\ns\nt\ne\n-\nt\n/\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\ns\n.\n(eq. 2)\nFinally, the third one is also GABAergic and describes the inhibitory input (at the level of GABAa, fast receptors) from interneurons I1 to pyramidal cells (I1 to P) and among interneurons I1 (I1 to I1, mutual inhibition). In this case,\nh\nGABAa\n,\nf\n(\nt\n)\n=\nW\nGABAa\n,\nf\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\nf\nt\ne\n-\nt\n/\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\nf\n(eq. 3)\nIn the function\nh\n(\nt\n) =\nWwte\n\u2212\nwt\n,\nW\nand\nw\nrespectively determine the amplitude and time constant of the average receptor-mediated postsynaptic potentials. Depending on the type of the considered interacting sub-populations,\nW\n=\nW\nAMPA\n,\nW\n=\nW\nGABAa,s\nor\nW\n=\nW\nGABAa,f\nand\nw\n= 1/\n\u03c4\nAMPA\n,\nw\n= 1/\n\u03c4\nGABAa,s\nor\nw\n= 1/\n\u03c4\nGABAa,f\n.\nIt is worth noting that the time constant used in a given\nh\n(\nt\n) function determines both the rise time (t\nrise\n= 1/\nw\n) and the decay time (t\ndecay\n= 3.146/\nw\n) of the PSPs that are designated to match those of actual PSPs.\nSecond, the \u2018wave-to-pulse\u2019 function transforms the average postsynaptic membrane potential of a subpopulation of neurons into an average pulse density of action potentials fired by the neurons. For each given subpopulation X, the \u2018wave-to-pulse\u2019 function was modeled by a nonlinear function of sigmoid shape\nS\nx\n(\n\u03d1\n)\n=\nQ\nx\nmax\n/\n(\n1\n+\ne\nr\nx\n(\n\u03b8\nx\n-\n\u03d1\n)\n)\nwhich accounts for saturation and threshold effects taking place at the soma. Here,\nQ\nx\nmax\ndetermines the maximum firing rate of the neuronal population, \u03b8\nx\nthe PSP for which a 50% firing rate is achieved, and r\nx\nthe steepness of the sigmoidal transformation.\nIn order to derive the ordinary differential equations that govern the model, one must notice that each one of the 7 \u2018pulse-to-wave\u2019 functions (P to P, P to I1, P to I2, \u2026, I1 to I1) introduces a second order linear transfer function\nh\n(\nt\n) =\nWwte\n\u2212\nwt\nand a corresponding second order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\nz\n\u00a8\n(\nt\n)\n=\nWwx\n(\nt\n)\n-\n2\nw\nz\n.\n(\nt\n)\n-\nw\n2\nz\n(\nt\n)\n(eq. 4)\nwhere\nx\n(\nt\n) and\nz\n(\nt\n) are respectively the input (firing rate) and output signals (PSPs) of each linear transfer function\nh\n(\nt\n). From\nequations 1\nto\n4\n, the following set of differential equations was established:\n{\nz\n\u00a8\n0\n(\nt\n)\n=\nW\nAMPA\n\u03c4\nAMPA\nS\np\n(\n\u03d1\np\n(\nt\n)\n)\n-\n2\n\u03c4\nAMPA\nz\n.\n0\n(\nt\n)\n-\n1\n\u03c4\nAMPA\n2\nz\n0\n(\nP\nto\nP\n)\nz\n\u00a8\n1\n(\nt\n)\n=\nW\nAMPA\n\u03c4\nAMPA\nS\nI\n1\n(\n\u03d1\nP\n(\nt\n)\n)\n-\n2\n\u03c4\nAMPA\nz\n.\n1\n(\nt\n)\n-\n1\n\u03c4\nAMPA\n2\nz\n1\n(\nP\nto\nI\n1\n)\nz\n\u00a8\n2\n(\nt\n)\n=\nW\nGABAa\n,\nf\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\nf\nS\nI\n1\n(\n\u03d1\nI\n1\n(\nt\n)\n)\n-\n2\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\nf\nz\n.\n2\n(\nt\n)\n-\n1\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\nf\n2\nz\n2\n(\nI\n1\nto\nI\n1\n)\nz\n\u00a8\n3\n(\nt\n)\n=\nW\nGABAa\n,\nf\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\nf\nS\nP\n(\n\u03d1\nI\n1\n(\nt\n)\n)\n-\n2\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\nf\nz\n.\n3\n(\nt\n)\n-\n1\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\nf\n2\nz\n3\n(\nI\n1\nto\nP\n)\nz\n\u00a8\n4\n(\nt\n)\n=\nW\nAMPA\n\u03c4\nAMPA\nS\nI\n2\n(\n\u03d1\nP\n(\nt\n)\n)\n-\n2\n\u03c4\nAMPA\nz\n.\n1\n(\nt\n)\n-\n1\n\u03c4\nAMPA\n2\nz\n1\n(\nP\nto\nI\n2\n)\nz\n\u00a8\n5\n(\nt\n)\n=\nW\nGABAa\n,\ns\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\ns\nS\nP\n(\n\u03d1\nI\n2\n(\nt\n)\n)\n-\n2\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\ns\nz\n.\n5\n(\nt\n)\n-\n1\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\ns\n2\nz\n5\n(\nI\n2\nto\nP\n)\nz\n\u00a8\n6\n(\nt\n)\n=\nW\nGABAa\n,\ns\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\ns\nS\nI\n1\n(\n\u03d1\nI\n2\n(\nt\n)\n)\n-\n2\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\ns\nz\n.\n6\n(\nt\n)\n-\n1\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\ns\n2\nz\n6\n(\nI\n2\nto\nI\n1\n)\nwhere\nz\n(t) is the state vector of the system and where\n\u03d1\nx\nis the average membrane potential in each subpopulation X (P, I1 or I2), described as follows:\n\u03d1\nP\n(\nt\n)\n=\nC\nPP\nz\n0\n(\nt\n)\n-\nC\nI\n1\nP\n(\nz\n3\n(\nt\n)\n-\n\u03b1\nI\n1\nP\nS\nI\n1\nt\n-\n\ufe38\nGABAdepolarization\nI\n1\n-\n>\nP\n+\n\u03b2\nI\n1\nP\nS\nI\n1\nt\n-\n.\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\nf\n\ufe38\nShunting\ninhibition\n)\n-\nC\nI\n2\nP\n(\nz\n5\n(\nt\n)\n-\n\u03b1\nI\n2\nP\nS\nI\n2\nt\n-\n\ufe38\nGABAdepolarization\nI\n2\n-\n>\nP\n+\n+\n\u03b2\nI\n2\nP\nS\nI\n2\nt\n-\n.\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\ns\n\ufe38\nShunting\ninhibition\n)\n+\nq\n(\nt\n)\n+\np\n(\nt\n)\n,\n(eq. 5)\n\u03d1\nI\n1\n(\nt\n)\n=\nC\nPI\n1\nz\n1\n(\nt\n)\n-\nC\nI\n1\nI\n1\n(\nz\n2\n(\nt\n)\n-\n\u03b1\nI\n1\nI\n1\nS\nI\n1\nt\n-\n\ufe38\nGABAdepolarization\nI\n1\n-\n>\nI\n1\n+\n\u03b2\nI\n1\nI\n1\nS\nI\n1\nt\n-\n.\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\nf\n\ufe38\nShunting\ninhibition\n)\n-\nC\nI\n2\nI\n1\n(\nz\n6\n(\nt\n)\n-\n-\n\u03b1\nI\n2\nI\n1\nS\nI\n2\nt\n-\n\ufe38\nGABAdepolarization\nI\n2\n-\n>\nI\n1\n+\n+\n\u03b2\nI\n2\nI\n1\nS\nI\n2\nt\n-\n.\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n,\ns\n\ufe38\nShunting\ninhibition\n)\n+\nq\n(\nt\n)\n,\n\u03d1\nI\n2\n(\nt\n)\n=\nC\nPI\n2\nz\n4\n(\nt\n)\n+\nq\n(\nt\n)\n.\n(eq.6)\nParameters\nC\nXX\n\u2032\nare referred to as connectivity constants between subpopulation X and subpopulation X\u2032. Physiologically,\nC\nXX\n\u2032\nis interpreted as an average number of synaptic contacts. Formally, these parameters act as gains in the feedback loops interconnecting the three subpopulations.\nThe influence from neighboring or distant populations was modeled by an excitatory input\np\n(\nt\n) =\np\u0304\n+\nN\n(0,\n\u03c3\n) represented by a Gaussian noise. In addition, a very slow oscillation mimicking delta waves often encountered in DS was added to each subpopulation average membrane potential to increase the realism of simulated EEGs. This slow oscillation is given by\nq\n(\nt\n) =\nA\n.sin(2\n\u03c0ft\n), with\nA\n= 0.05 and\nf\n= 0.33 Hz.\nIn the above equations,\nS\nx\nt\n-\n=\nS\nx\n(\n\u03d1\nx\n(\nt\n-\n)\n)\ndenotes the average firing rate of subpopulation X at the previous integration step\nt\n\u2212\n. This average firing rate value is involved in the two mechanisms implemented in the model, namely the GABA depolarization and the shunting inhibition effects described below.\nThe simulated LFP is computed as the summation of PSPs (either excitatory or inhibitory) at the level of pyramidal cells. It is well admitted that these pyramidal cell PSPs is the main contribution to LFP (\nNiedermeyer and Lopes da Silva, 2005\n). According to the neural mass modeling approach, the influence from neighboring or more distant populations onto the considered population is modeled by an excitatory input, itself represented by a Gaussian noise of variance\n\u03c3\n2\n. Note that when the system operates on a fixed point and when\n\u03c3\nis low, the output of the firing rate function (sigmoid function S_X) appears as almost constant, as depicted in\nFig 2 B,C,D\n. Finally, model parameters are documented in\nTable 1\nalong with values used in the simulations reported in\nFigs 2\nto\n6\n.\nFig 2. Depolarizing GABA\nA\ngenerates spontaneous transitions from interictal to seizure-like activity.\nOpen in a new tab\nA: Simulated EEG activity during the progressive increase of the fraction of excitatory vs. inhibitory PSPs mediated at GABA\nA\nreceptors (depolarizing GABA effect).

Dynamic changes from background activity to seizure termination are observed as reflected by simulated signals sequentially exhibiting epileptic spikes, chirp-like fast onset (FO) activity and seizure-like activity.\n(\nB\n) Magnification of the fast onset activity simulated in\nFig 1A\n. Time-frequency analysis (spectrogram) of the signal shows that the fast onset activity starts around 100 Hz. Both the frequency and energy progressively decrease with time. These signal features are reminiscent of the chirp-like activity often encountered at the onset of seizures.\n(C) Average firing rate of neuronal sub-populations (Blue: pyramidal cells - P \u2013, Red: somatic-projecting interneurons - I1 \u2013 and Green: dendritic-projecting interneurons - I2 -) during the local field activity presented in A. An increase of the firing rate of P, I1 and I2 during interictal epileptic spikes and ictal-like activity is observed. In contrast, before and during seizure onset, the increase of the firing rate is limited to I1 and I2. The inset shows the high frequency of I1 subpopulation during the chirp-like activity at seizure onset. The thin gray line indicates the correspondence of the firing rate of the three subpopulations of neurons with the mean field activity depicted in\nFig 1A\n.\n(D) Simulated EEG activity, with the same parameters as in A, but left panel: without depolarizing GABA\nA\nfrom dendritic-projecting interneurons to pyramidal cells (I2\u2192P) middle panel: without depolarizing GABA\nA\nfrom somatic-projecting interneurons to themselves (I1\u2192I1), right panel: without depolarizing GABA\nA\nfrom somatic-projecting interneurons to pyramidal cells (I1\u2192P). Note that depolarizing GABA\nA\nfrom I1\u2192I1 and I1\u2192P are required to trigger seizure-like activity.\nTABLE 1.\nModel parameters.\nSignificance\nFig 2\nFig 2\nand\n6\nFig 3\nFig 3 B\nFig 3C\nFig 4 A\nFig 4 B\nFig 4 C\nFig 4 D\nFig 5\nFast onset activity\nSpont.transition from bckg to seizure like activity\nSeries of epileptic spikes\nInterictal spikes\nEvolution of spike shape\nSeizure-like activity\nSeizure-like activity\nSeizure-like activity\nSeizure-like activity\nEvolution of seizure patterns\nAverage synaptic contact x\n\u2192 x\nC\nPP\n80\n80\n110\n110\n110\n90\n50\n65\n110\n75\nC\nPI1\n20\n20\n40\n20\n40\n22\n400\n80\n40\n22\nC\nI1I1\n15\n15\n25\n15\n15\n20\n60\n70\n15\n21\nC\nI1P\n80\n80\n55\n80\n60\n118\n100\n50\n60\n118\nC\nPI2\n5\n5\n6\n5\n6\n10\n50\n15\n6\n10\nC\nI2P\n20\n20\n20\n20\n20\n16.5\n25\n20\n20\n16.5\nConstant or time-dependent parameter in GABA\n\u03b1\nI1P\n0.017\n0.017\n0.0015\n0.0005\n0.085\n0.14\n0.119\n0.019\n0.017\n0.17\n\u03b1\nI1I1\n0.007\n0.007\n0.0086\n0.067\n0.017\n0.13\n0.39\n0.075\n0.085\n0.118\nMean PSP amplitude\n(AMPA, GABA a, s GABA a,f)\nW\nAMPA\n;\nW\nGABAa,s\n;\nW\nGABAa,f\n5; 50; 20\nKinetic of PSP\n(AMPA, GABA a, s GABA a,f)\n1/\n\u03c4\nAMPA\n; 1/\n\u03c4\nGABAa,s\n; 1/\n\u03c4\nGABAa,f\n180; 33; 220\nWave to pulse function in subpopulation x.\n\u229d\nP\n;\nQ\nP\nmax\n; r\nP\n6; 8; 1.2\n\u229d\nI1\n;\nQ\nI\n1\nmax\n; r\nI1\n8; 4.8; 0.5\n\u229d\nI2\n;\nQ\nI\n2\nmax\n; r\nI2\n8; 4.4; 0.5\nOpen in a new tab\nFig 6. Simulated effect of Stiripentol and benzodiazepine on ictal-like activity.\nOpen in a new tab\n(\nA\n) Example of simulated course of seizure with background activity with interictal spikes at the beginning following by fast-onset activity, seizure and seizure termination. (\nB\n) Action of Stiripentol (STP) on the course of seizure (A) is presented. STP enhances the activity of the GABA\nA\nreceptors. Examination of mIPSCs (miniature GABA\nA\nreceptor\u2013mediated currents) kinetics indicated that STP also markedly increased the mIPSC decay-time constant [12]. Enhanced activity of the GABA\nA\nreceptors increased shunting effect. We represented shunting effect in the model by reducing the membrane potential with increasing of IPSPS decay-time constant. Prolonged IPSC decay time is concentration dependent. (\nC\n) Action of benzodiazepine (BZD), increasing the amplitude of IPSC, on the course of seizure (A) is presented. (\nD\n) Combined action of BZD and STP conducts to background activity.\n\nFrom physiological to pathological brain activity\nThe above described model incorporates some (patho)physiological mechanisms that are likely to play a key role in the generation of epileptic activity in the infantile onset epilepsy Dravet syndrome. These mechanisms are described hereafter.\nDepolarizing GABA\nGABA-elicited currents cause hyperpolarizing or depolarizing postsynaptic potentials depending on the GABA\nA\nreversal potential (E\nGABA\n). Hyperpolarizing GABA was previously considered in mean-field models (\nGoodfellow et al., 2011\n;\nWendling et al., 2002\n). Acute intracellular chloride [Cl\n\u2212\n]\ni\naccumulation results in a shift of the E\nGABA\nin the depolarizing direction toward resting membrane potential (V\nrest\n). As a consequence, E\nGABA\nmay rise above V\nrest\n, thus leading to GABAergic induced depolarizations (\nFigs. 1C and 1D\n).\nActivity-dependent [Cl\n\u2212\n]\nI\nchanges were studied in a computational model of hippocampal cells, but not in the context of epilepsy (\nJedlicka et al., 2011\n). The authors showed that in case of intense GABAergic background activity (during high frequency firing of interneurons), E\nGABA\nchanged in both somatic and dendritic compartments. Therefore, in our model, the depolarizing effect was implemented for both types of synapses (GABA\nA\n, slow and GABA\nA\n, fast).\nIn the neural mass model there is no access to individual cellular membrane potentials but to average membrane potentials of a subpopulation of neurons. Although direct account for E\nGABA\nis not straightforward in this modeling approach, average PSPs are explicitly represented at each subpopulation and can therefore be modified to account for excitatory GABAergic potentials, as illustrated in\nFigure 1D\n.\nFor depolarizing GABA:\n-\nC\nX\nX\n\u2032\n.\n(\n-\n\u03b1\nX\nX\n\u2032\n.\nS\nx\nt\n-\n)\n>\n0\n(\nas\n\u03b1\nX\nX\n\u2032\n>\n0\n)\n.\nFor hyperpolarizing GABA:\n-\nC\nX\nX\n\u2032\n.\nz\nk\n(\nt\n)\n<\n0\nwhere X\u2032 denote the target subpopulation of neurons receiving PSPs from the source subpopulation X and where Zk denote the PSP exchanged at the interface of subpopulations X and X\u2032. As this quantity is positive, an increase of the mean membrane potential is achieved (depolarizing effect) and weighted by the firing rate of subpopulation X.\nThis mathematical expression allows for the presence of excitatory GABAergic PSPs referred to as \u201cstatic\u201d GABAergic depolarization that is likely to occur in epileptic tissue when some chloride transporters are not sufficiently expressed in a subpopulation of neurons (\nHuberfeld et al., 2007\n;\nPalma et al., 2006\n). It is assumed that changes in E\nGABA\nare spatially non-uniform across the population. It is likely that within a subpopulation of pyramidal cells some neurons get hyperpolarized by GABA (expressing a large amount of chloride transporters) and some others get depolarized by GABA (expressing a few chloride transporters). For example, in human mTLE, GABA\nA\n-mediated IPSPs reversed at depolarizing potentials in 20% of pyramidal cells (\nHuberfeld et al., 2007\n).\nIn addition,\n\u03b1\nXX\n\u2032\ncan be made time-dependent to represent a \u201cdynamic\u201d GABA depolarization effect. This can be easily achieved by adding extra ODEs to the model in the form of\nd\n\u03b1\nX\nX\n\u2032\nd\nt\n=\nK\nwhere\nK\nis used to adjust the rate of change of\n\u03b1\nXX\n\u2032\nwith time (linear function). When\nK > 0,\nan amplification of the GABA\nA\ndepolarizing effect occurs in the model. Indeed, the increase of the mean membrane potential of subpopulation P leads to an increase of its firing rate and thus to an increase of the excitatory drive onto interneurons I1 and I2 and ultimately of their respective firing\nS\nI\n1\nt\n-\nand\nS\nI\n2\nt\n-\n(\nFig 1E\n).\nShunting inhibition\nThe other effect on the postsynaptic membrane mediated by GABAergic events is called \u2018shunting inhibition\u2019. That is a form of postsynaptic potential inhibition owing to an increase of the postsynaptic membrane conductance due to the sustained activation of GABA\nA\nreceptors and the opening of ion channels.\nThis shunting inhibitory effect always remains, independently of the effect of GABA (depol- or hyper-polarizing). The shunting inhibition cannot be directly coded in the mesoscopic model because the membrane resistance of the cells is not explicitly implemented. Therefore we mathematically represented this effect by modifying the membrane potential in pyramidal cells, fast and slow interneurons depending on the firing rate of interneurons and weighted by the IPSP time constant. As depicted in\nequations5\nand\n6\n, the mathematical expression for representing shunting inhibition was\n-\nC\nX\nX\n\u2032\n.\n\u03b2\nX\nX\n\u2032\n.\nS\nX\nt\n-\n.\n\u03c4\nGABAa\n. As this quantity is negative, an inhibitory effect is achieved in the model, and it increased when the firing rate of interneurons increases.\nSCN1A mutation\nWe adjusted variables to account for the mutation of the gene\nSCN1A\nencoding for the NaV1.1 \u03b1-1 subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) related to Dravet syndrome (\nClaes et al., 2001\n;\nEscayg et al., 2000\n;\nHarkin et al., 2007\n;\nScheffer and Berkovic, 1997\n). All patients selected for the present study were carrying a\nSCN1A\nmutation (see\nTable 2\n). Mutant\nSCN1A\n+/\u2212\nmouse models of DS robustly identified an alteration of the expression of VGSC specifically in GABAergic interneurons as a cause of selective loss of sodium current affecting their firing properties which results in epilepsy (\nYu et al., 2006\n). In order to mimic such an alteration we adapted the sigmoid functions describing the average firing rate as a function of the average PSP at the level of fast and slow interneurons in our macroscopic model (see\nFig 1B\n). The sigmoid functions of the firing rate of both perisomatic-I1 and dendritic-I2 projecting interneurons were intentionally modified compared to pyramidal cells (\nTable 1\n).\nTABLE 2.\nDemographic data of patients.\nPatient\nBA (pt 1)\nNP (pt 2)\nDD (pt 3)\nEM (pt 4)\nAge of onset\n4 m\n4.5 m\n7 m\n6 m\nAge\n9 y\n14 y\n3y 2m\n8 y\nFirst seizure\nType\nClonic unilat. sn\nGTC\nGTC\nClonic unilat. dx\nDuration\n30 min\n25 min\n20 min\n20 min\nFever association\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nVaccine association\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo\nInterictal EEG\nnl\nnl\nnl\nnl\nPMD\nnl\nnl\nnl\nnl\nAED (after 1\nst\nseizure)\nCBZ\nVPA\nVPA\nVPA\nOther reported seizures\u2019types\nMyoclonic attacks\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nMyoclonic status\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nGTCS\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nUnilateral motor\nYes\nYes\nNo\nYes\nAtypical absences\nYes\nNo\nNo\nYes\nPartial seizures\nNo\nYes\nNo\nYes\nTonic (age of onset-end)\n2 y 10 m - ?\nNo\ny (3\u20135y)\n4 y - ?\nFever sensitivity\n+++\n+++\n++\n++\nSeizure in cluster\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nTreatment (onset-end)\nVPA\n14 m - now\n5.5m -\n11m -\n6 m - now\nFB\n6 m \u2013 2 y 7 m\nNo\nNo\nYes\nCLB\n4 y - now\n5y -\n2.5y -\n1 y - now\nCLZ\n14 m \u2013 3 y\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNZP\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes\nSTP\n2 y 7 m \u2013 4 y 8 m\n7y -\n2.5y -\n1 y - now\nTPM\nNo\n12\u201313y\n7y -\n5 y \u2013 6 y\nETS\n2 y 10 m - 4 y 8 m\nNo\nNo\nNo\nCBZ\n5 m \u2013 6 m\nNo\nNo\nYes\nVGB\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nPHT\nNo\nNo\nNo\n? - 1 y 9 m\nLVC\nNo\n13y-\nNo\n? - 7 y\nLTG\nNo\n5\u20135.5y\nNo\nNo\nPRM\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes\nZNS\nNo\nNo\nNo\n7 y \u2013 7 y 9 m\nHydrocortisone\n4 y 8 m - ?\nNo\nNo\n5 y 8 m \u2013 6 y\nKetogenic diet\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes\nVagal stimulator\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nLanguage\nSimple S\nshort sentences\nisolated words\nNo\nPsychomoto\nr\ndelay\nModerate\nmoderate\nsevere\nModerate- Severe\nSCN1A\nmutations\nc.680 T>C\nC3880-1G>T intron 19\nC4582-1G>T\nIVS8+1C>T\nOpen in a new tab\n\nVirtual pharmacology\nWe studied the pharmacological impact on neuronal populations of two antiepileptic drugs (AED), stiripentol and clobazam, that we selected for their clinical relevance in Dravet syndrome (DS) and their known mechanism of action on GABA\nA\nreceptors. Enhanced activity of GABA\nA\nreceptors increases the shunting effect and may therefore inhibit seizures. Stiripentol is the only AED currently approved in DS, having proven to reduce seizure frequency significantly more than placebo, when associated to clobazam and valproate within two independent randomized controlled trials performed in children with DS (\nChiron et al., 2000\n;\nKassa\u00ef et al., 2008\n). Stiripentol directly acts on the GABA\nA\nreceptors by enhancing the opening duration of the chloride channel in a dose-dependent manner (\nQuilichini et al., 2006\n). In order to reproduce this effect, we prolonged IPSC decay time (t\ndecay\n) in the model by increasing the decay-time constant (1/\nb\n) and (1/\ng\n) of IPSPs to 125% for 30 \u03bcM, 200% for 100 \u03bcM and 235% for 300 \u03bcM of STP. By contrast benzodiazepines have a major effect on GABA\nA\nmediated IPSC amplitude (\nH\u00e1jos et al., 2000\n)\n.\nTo introduce benzodiazepine action in the model we increased parameter W\nGABA\n, representing the amplitude of IPSC (125% for 1 \u03bcM, 178% for 10 \u03bcM and 200% for 100 \u03bcM). The drug concentrations of stiripentol and benzodiazepine used in the model were selected based on their therapeutical relevance(\nQuilichini et al., 2006\n,\n2003\n).\n\nNeuronal activity and clinical data\nIn the present study we used scalp EEG signals recorded in patients with DS as a reflection of real neural activity to be compared with LFPs simulated by our computational model. We compared qualitatively the temporal dynamics of both simulated and real signals, i.e. the time constant and the shape of the interictal and ictal patterns. It is worth noting that the essential signal features being compared are related to the morphology and spectral content. In our case, the amplitude is meaningless since we didn\u2019t solve the forward EEG problem (i.e., from cortical sources to signals collected at scalp electrodes).\nDravet patients (n=4) were selected for the present study from the two reference centers for infantile onset epilepsy involved in the CRESIM project in France and Italy. Selection criteria were the following: over 2 years of age, complete clinical features of Dravet syndrome,\nSCN1A\nmutation, at least one digitalized prolonged video-EEG recording available, at least one convulsive seizure with (tonic-)clonic component recorded. Four patients were selected; individual data are shown in\nTable 2\n."

Time-mated dams of the Sprague-Dawley strain and adult females were purchased (Charles River, Germany) and kept under standard laboratory conditions.\n\n2.1. Induction of desensitisation\nTo ensure sufficient exposure to the cells during the critical period for desensitisation we injected all pups on post-natal day 2 and 4 i.p. with 1\u00a0\u03bcl of pre-differentiated hESCs. The cells were differentiated according to previously established protocols (\nKirkeby et al., 2012\n) and used for injections in a cell suspension of 100,000\u00a0cells/\u03bcl consisting of a mix of immature neural progenitors (day 16 of differentiation) and postmitotic neurons (day 35 of differentiation).\n\n2.2. Preparation of hESCs for desensitisation and transplantation\nAll human ESC lines H9 (WA09, WiCell) and RC17 (Roslin Cells, hPSCreg #RCe021-A) were differentiated towards neural progenitors as previously described (\nKirkeby et al., 2012\n). Human iN were derived via direct conversion of human fetal lung fibroblast as described previously (\nPfisterer et al., 2011\n). H9-Cre cells were generated by in vitro lentiviral transduction with a Synapsin-Cre construct. For intra-striatal transplantation, 300,000 (75,000\u00a0cells/\u03bcl) cells from day 16 of differentiation were grafted as previously described (\nKirkeby et al., 2012\n).\n\n2.3. Transplantation\nOnce adult (minimum 15\u00a0weeks), all animals received lesions to the ascending dopaminergic fibre bundle as described previously (\nTorres et al., 2011\n). 4\u20135\u00a0weeks after the lesion the rats were engrafted using differentiated H9 and RC17, Cre-recombinase expressing H9-hESCs, or human induced neurons (hiNs). The group sizes of the respective experiments were as follows: In experiment 1 we engrafted 16 rats with H9-hESC-derived cells (CsA, n\u00a0=\u00a07; Desensitised, n\u00a0=\u00a09) and 2 rats with iNs. In experiment 2 we engrafted 28 rats using H9-hESC-derived cells (rejection, n\u00a0=\u00a07; CsA, n\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0+\u00a03; Desensitised, n\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0+\u00a02) and 12 rats using RC17 hESC (n\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0+\u00a04). For the assessment of breaching the blood brain barrier we engrafted 4 rats using H9-hESC-derived cells and 6 rats using Cre-recombinase expressing H9-hESC-derived cells.\nAll grafts were placed into the right striatum at the following coordinates: AP: +\u00a01.2, ML: \u2212\u00a02.6, DV (from dura): \u2212\u00a04.5 and AP: +\u00a00.5, ML: \u2212\u00a03.0, DV: \u2212\u00a04.5, with the incisor bar set at \u2212\u00a02.4. All cell suspensions were done in one 2\u00a0\u03bcl deposit per injection tract. Cells were infused at a speed of 1\u00a0\u03bcl per minute with 3\u00a0min for diffusion after each placement (\nGrealish et al., 2015\n).\nNon-desensitised rats that were placed in the pharmacological immune-suppression group received daily i.p. injections of Cyclosporine (10\u00a0mg/kg) starting 1\u00a0day before transplantation.\n\n2.4. Immunohistochemistry\nAll rats were perfused using ice-cold 4% PFA, brains were placed in 25% sucrose and cut coronal in a 1:12 series at a thickness of 35\u00a0\u03bcm. Immunohistochemistry was performed as stated in (\nGrealish et al., 2015\n). Primary antibodies against hNCAM (Santa Cruz, AB106, monoclonal, mouse, 1:1000); Ox42(CD11b) (Serotec, MCA275G, monoclonal, mouse, 1:1000), GFAP (DAKO, Z0034, polyclonal, rabbit, 1:1000), CD4 (Abcam, AB33775, monoclonal, mouse, 1:1000), CD8 (Serotec, MCA48G, monoclonal, mouse 1:1000), Ox6 (Abcam, AB23990, monoclonal, mouse, 1:500), Ox18 (Abcam, AB33752, monoclonal, mouse, 1:500), HuNu (Chemicon, MAB1281/87, monoclonal, mouse, 1:500), GFP (Abcam, AB13970, polyclonal, chicken, 1:1000), Cre-recombinase (BioLegend, PRB-106P, polyclonal, rabbit, 1:1000) were used.\n\n2.5. Quantification of graft area and microglia response\nA series of coronal sections (35\u00a0\u03bcm; 1:12) was stained for hNCAM and photographed using a Leica DMI600B microscope. The area of the graft core was quantified using ImageJ software (Version 1.50d, National Institues of Health, USA). Data are presented as the sum of all graft areas corrected for series. To estimate the microglia response we took images of three coronal sections stained for Ox42 in which the transplant location was clearly visible from the animals of the CsA-immune-suppressed, the neonatal desensitised and the rejection group (weeks 2 and 6, n\u00a0=\u00a05). Optical staining intensity was measured using ImageJ software (V1.50d, National Institues of Health, USA) calibrated with an optical density table (NIH) and Rodbard function (\nHeuer et al., 2012\n). We present the O.D. values of the Ox42 staining by subtraction of the intact striatum from the engrafted striatum.\n\n2.6. Statistics\nAll data were analysed using the software package for the social science (SPSS) version 22.0 using a significance level of \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.05. Data were analysed using independent samples Student's\nt\n-test and one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni corrected \u03b1 for multiple comparisons, where appropriate."

Cognitive memory task\nFour nonhuman primates (NHP) were subjects (rhesus,\nMacaca mulatta\n) trained for at least 2 years to perform a well-established visuo-spatial delayed-match-to-sample (DMS) task (\nFig. 1A\n) for juice rewards (\nHampson et al., 2012a\n,\nb\n,\nc\n,\nd\n;\nHampson et al., 2010\n;\nHampson et al., 2004\n;\nHampson et al., 2013\n;\nOpris et al., 2012a\n,\nb\n;\nOpris et al., 2012a\n,\nb\n). All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Wake Forest University, in accordance with U.S. Department of Agriculture, International Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, and National Institutes of Health, guidelines. Animals were seated in a primate chair with a shelf-counter in front of them facing a large display screen during task performance. Right hand position on the counter top was tracked via a UV-fluorescent reflector affixed to wrist and illuminated with a 15 W UV lamp. Hand position and movement was detected by a small LCD camera positioned 30 cm above the hand, digitized using a Plexon Cineplex scanner connected to a behavioral control computer, and displayed as a bright yellow cursor on the projection screen. Trials were initiated by the animal placing the cursor inside either a yellow circle or red square (centrally-placed) that appeared randomly on the screen which constituted the \u2018Start Signal\u2019 (SS) for a given trial (\nFig. 1\n). Following trial initiation by response to the SS, a single image was presented randomly as the Sample feature of the trial, to any of seven positions on the screen, constituting the \u2018Sample Presentation\u2019 (SP) phase of the task. Completion of the Sample phase required placement of the cursor into the displayed clip-art image, and was designated the Sample Response (SR). The particular shape of the SS (square or circle) presented at trial onset, conveyed the response contingency with respect to the SP features (image type or screen position) when presented in the subsequent Match phase of the task with other distracter images following termination of the interposed variable (1\u201390 s) Delay interval. If the SS was: 1) a yellow circle this indicated an\nObject\ntype trial in which the SP clip-art image was to be responded to in the Match Phase irrespective of where on the screen it appeared in 7 other possible screen positions or, 2) a red square, indicating a\nSpatial\ntype trial in which the correct response in the Match phase was to touch the same spatial location on the screen in which the SP image appeared irrespective of a) the particular clip-art image that occupied that same location, or b) where else on the screen the original SP clip-art image appeared during the Match phase.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nIllustration of DMS behavioral task and localization of hippocampal recording electrodes.

Match response (MR) consisted of cursor movements onto same image (for Object trials, red arrow) or same position (for Spatial trials, blue arrow) as in the Sample Phase. (\nDeadwyler et al., 1996\n) Correct MRs were rewarded by delivery of a squirt of juice reward (Reinf.). Placement of the cursor onto a non-match (distracter) image (object trial) or onto a different screen location from the SR (spatial trial) caused the screen to go blank without reward delivery. Inter-trial interval: 10.0 s. B: Overall performance averages showing the interaction of interposed delays with number of images presented in Match Phase. High and Low Cognitive Load conditions indicated by dashed outlines. C: Differential mean per cent correct performance in object and spatial trials (blue and red arrows in A) as a function of the number of (distracter) images presented in the match phase of the task. *p < 0.01, **p < 0.001 Object vs. Spatial. D: Diagram of NHP brain in cross-section showing hippocampal tetrode tracks through temporal lobe and placement in the CA3 and CA1 cell layers.\nThe SR initiated the\nDelay\ninterval phase of the trial, in which the screen was blanked for 1\u201390 s, randomly determined on a trial-to-trial basis. The end of the Delay interval was signaled by the onset of the Match Phase (MP) of the task, consisting of the simultaneous display of 2\u20137 trial unique images, including the SP image, at separate randomly-selected, spatial locations on the screen. Placement of the cursor into one of the displayed images constituted the \u201cMatch Response\u201d (MR), the final trial event. As stated above, selection of the correct image in the MP was dictated by the SS trial type contingency for cursor placement in the MP into either: 1) the same SP\nimage\nno matter where located on the screen, on\nObject\ntrials, or 2), the same Sample phase SP\nscreen location\n(irrespective of image) on\nSpatial\ntrials (\nFig. 1A\n). Correct MRs produced immediate delivery of a juice reward directly to the mouth via a positioned tube. Incorrect cursor placement constituted a\nnonmatch-error\nresponse and caused the screen to blank without delivery of the juice reward. Trials during the session were separated by a minimum of 10 s. in which the SS was presented following termination of the Match phase of the prior trial. All clip-art images presented (sample and distracters) were unique for each trial in a daily session (100\u2013150 trials), and were selected randomly from an image reservoir (n = 5000) which could be updated every month (\nHampson et al., 2004\n). In the above described version of the DMS task NHPs were trained to overall performance levels of 70\u201375% correct on the least difficult trials, which produced performance accuracy that systematically decreased as delays and number of images increased.\n\n2.2. Surgery\nAnimals were surgically prepared with cylinders on the skull for daily attachment of microelectrodes and manipulators into the CA1 and CA3 regions of hippocampus (\nFig. 1B\n). During surgery animals were anesthetized with ketamine (10 mg/kg), then intubated and maintained with isoflurane (1\u20132% in oxygen 6 \u2113/min). Recording cylinders (Crist Instruments, Hagerstown, MD) were placed over 20 mm diameter craniotomies for electrode access (\nHampson et al., 2004\n) to stereotaxic coordinates of the Hippocampus (\nFig. 1\n) previously shown by PET imaging (\nPorrino et al., 2005\n) to become activated during task performance. Two titanium posts were secured to the skull for head restraint and recording cylinders were disinfected thrice weekly with Betadine during recovery and daily following task recording.\n\n2.3. Recording from hippocampus\nElectrophysiological procedures and analysis utilized the 64 channel MAP Spike Sorter by Plexon, Inc. (Dallas, TX). Customized tetrode arrays were manufactured specifically for recording spatially distinct locations in the CA3 and CA1 cell fields in primate hippocampus (\nHampson et al., 2004\n;\nSantos et al., 2012\n) such that multi-cell (n > 12) recordings could be obtained from each anatomically distinct location. The robust Schaefer collateral projections from CA3 to CA1 insured that locations recorded from in CA3 were likely connected synaptically to the locations recorded in CA1 in each Tetrode pair positioned in the same mediolateral plane or \u201cchip\u201d of hippocampus in two distinct anterior/posterior locations as shown in\nFigs. 1B\n&\n4\n.\nFig. 4.\nOpen in a new tab\nComparison of Sample and Match Phase peak firing for Correct and Error Object and Spatial trials.

Data analysis\nTask performance was determined for each animal (n = 4) as number of correct and incorrect responses within trial groups sorted according to duration of delay and number of images presented in the Match phase (\nFig. 1C, D, E\n). Number of trials were summed, and percentage of correct responses computed within sessions, with average performance computed across a minimum of three sessions (\nHampson et al., 2012a\n,\nb\n,\nc\n,\nd\n). Recordings of multiple neuron firings on individual trials during the Sample and Match phases of the DMS task were summed within 100 ms intervals, and averaged across trials within a session for display of mean firing rate via perievent histograms (PEHs) within both the Sample or Match task events (\nFigs. 2\n,\n3\n).\nFig. 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nEnsemble encoding of DMS task events. Heat maps depict trial-based firing of hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neural ensembles averaged across 100 DMS trials. Vertical axis depicts individual cells (n = 15), while horizontal axis depicts elapsed time during typical DMS trials. DMS Sample Presentation (SP), Sample Response (SR), Match Presentation (MP) and Match Response (MR) are depicted on the horizontal axis by +1 and \u22121 s brackets around each event and by vertical dashed lines. Trials were sorted according to Object vs. Spatial trials, and correct vs. error performance prior to averaging firing rate for each cell within the session. Mean firing rate is normalized to probability of firing across trials, at a temporal resolution of 100 ms, and represented by the color code scale at the bottom. Data shown is from a single subject/single ensemble recording session.\nFig. 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nHippocampal CA1 and CA3 neuron firing in the Sample and Match Phases of the DMS task. A. Trial-based histograms (TBHs) of average firing of all CA1 cells (n = 431) recorded during Sample Phase from all 4 NHPs performing the DMS task. Each trace represents one of the 4 conditions listed on the left for comparison of correct Object vs. Spatial trials. The three events in the Sample phase (Start = Strt, Sample Present = SP, Sample Response = SR) are listed on the x-axis and marked by vertical dotted lines on each TBH. B. TBHs for Match Phase recorded from the same CA1 neurons as in A. Note the sustained elevated mean firing rates from Match onset until reward delivery or trial termination. Match Presentation (MP) and Match Response (MR) are indicated on the x-axis and by vertical dashed lines. The brief firing peaks that occurred coincident with reinforcement (Reinf.) occurred after the MR primarily on Object trials. C. TBHs of average firing for all CA3 cells (n = 801) recorded during Sample Phase. D. Match Phase TBHs for same CA3 neurons graphs as in C. Note that CA3 and CA1 neurons exhibited similar responses to the DMS trial events indicated. Error bars indicated peak S.E.M. for each TBH.\nSignificant firing peaks were identified by an increase in firing rate (standard score: z = [peak \u2212 baseline]\u00f7standard deviation of baseline). Firing rates for simultaneously recorded CA1 and CA3 neurons were analyzed in 100ms bins over \u00b1 2.0 s relative to the time of initiation (0.0 s) of the Sample and Match phases of the task. \u201cPeak\u201d firing rates were computed as maximum firing rate (as a sliding 3-bin mean) \u00b1 0.5 s relative to each event, while \u201cBaseline\u201d firing rates were computed \u22122.0 to \u22121.0 s relative to the same event. Baseline firing ranged from 2.0\u20134.0 Hz depending on phase of task, with S.D.'s of 0.1\u20130.4 Hz; significant Peak firing was typically elevated by 1.0\u20132.0 Hz over baseline firing at the Sample and Match events. Standard scores were assessed for significance using the Z distribution such that z > 3.09 were considered significant increases over baseline (p < 0.001). Neurons were only included in the analysis if their firing rates increased significantly relative to pre-event (\u22122.0 to 0.0 s) baseline levels.\nThe correspondence of firing between cells in different layers was tested via comparison of trial-based histograms (TBHs) spanning more than one task event within a phase to construct templates related to how the hippocampus encoded trial specific information. Perievent histograms (PEHs) demarcated firing differences for individual events and provided the basis for nonlinear model analyses of firing during particular Sample and Match events within a given trial.\n\n2.5. MIMO model for extracting DMS task-related hippocampal neural activity\nPrior studies in rodents showed that a multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear dynamic model applied to spatiotemporal firing patterns of multiple recordings from rodent hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neurons was capable of extracting specific patterns related to successful performance of a nonmatch to sample memory task, which could then be administered to the same locations as patterns of electrical pulses to facilitate and recover performance (\nBerger et al., 2011\n;\nHampson et al., 2012a\n,\nb\n,\nc\n,\nd\n;\nHampson et al., 2012a\n,\nb\n,\nc\n,\nd\n;\nHampson et al., 2013\n). The same MIMO model was applied to hippocampal recordings in NHPs to assess the spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics underlying multi-neuron spike train transformations in order to predict CA1 output firing patterns from input patterns of CA3 neural activity, via underlying Shaffer collateral synaptic connectivity (\nDeguchi et al., 2011\n;\nKlausberger and Somogyi, 2008\n). The MIMO version of the model applied here was derived from the data recorded by the multiple tetrode ceramic electrode array (MEA) probes in NHPs performing the DMS task described in\nFig. 1\n(\nHampson et al., 2012a\n,\nb\n,\nc\n,\nd\n)."

Mice were hosted at the IGF or INRA animal facilities (institutional license approved by the French Ministry of\nAgriculture No. D34\u2013172-13 and B31\u2013555013). Mice were housed on a 12 h light-dark cycle with food and water\nad libitum\n. The animal experiment protocols were approved by the local ethical committee for animal testing\n(05185.01 and 00846.01). CAR\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice and wild type on a C57BL/6j genetic background (\nWei et al., 2000\n) were originally established and previously used by the authors of this manuscript\n(INRA, see (\nRoques et al., 2013\n)).

All data (means \u00b1 SEM) were analyzed using Student\u2019s t-test: *** P < 0.001.\n2.2.1. Spatial object recognition\nThe spatial object recognition test was performed as previously described (\nGangarossa\net al., 2014a\n,\n2014b\n). Briefly, mice were habituated to the experimental\narena for 10 min. The following day, mice were allowed to freely explore 2 different objects (A and B) located in the same\nsite of the arena. Object interaction was defined as approaching the object with the nose (1 cm). Following a retention\ninterval of 24 h, mice underwent a 5 min recall session when the arena contained one of the two objects displaced in the other\nsite (novel place). Following each session, the objects and the open field were cleaned with 70% ethanol. The experiments were\nvideotaped and the time spent exploring the objects was scored. The percentage of exploration time was calculated as %\nexploration = ((Time B) / (Time A + Time B)) \u2217 100.\n2.2.2. Rotarod test\nBalance and motor coordination as well as motor learning were assessed using an accelerating rotarod (Ugo Basile,\nComerio, Italy) as previously described (\nGangarossa et al., 2014a\n,\n2014b\n). Mice were placed on the rotating drum accelerating from 4 to 40 rpm over 5 min for 3 trials\na day and for 3 consecutive days. The trial interval was 45 min for all mice. Rotarod sessions were scored for latency to fall\nor ride around the rod.\n2.2.3. Spontaneous locomotor activity\nLocomotor activity was measured as previously described (\nGangarossa et al.,\n2014a\n,\n2014b\n). Horizontal and vertical activities were measured in a\ncircular corridor (Imetronic, Pessac, France). Counts for horizontal activity were incremented by consecutive interruption of\ntwo adjacent beams placed at a height of 1 cm per 90\u00b0 sector of the corridor (mice moving through one-quarter of the\ncircular corridor) and counts for vertical activity (rearing) as interruption of beams placed at a height of 7.5 cm along the\ncorridor (mice stretching upwards).\n2.2.4. Elevated-plus maze (EPM)\nThe elevated plus maze was elevated 1 m above the floor (black plastic with 2 open arms 5 cm width \u00d7 35 cm\nlength \u00d7 0.5 cm height; 2 closed arms 5 width \u00d7 35 cm length \u00d7 15 cm height). Mice were placed in the\ncenter of maze facing one of the open arms and were allowed to explore the maze for 10 min. Experiments were videotaped and\nscored for entries and time spent in the closed arms (4 paws within) or open arms (4 paws within).\n2.2.5. Open field\nSpontaneous exploratory behavior was monitored in an open field (white plastic arena with 35 cm width \u00d7 50 cm\nlength \u00d7 20 cm height) for 10 min. The center zone was defined as a virtual perimeter within 5 cm from the sides of the\narena. Experiments were videotaped and an observer scored the time spent in the center (4 paws inside the center zone) and the\nnumber of transitions in the center zone.\n\n2.3. Video-encephalography and signal analysis\n2.3.1. Baseline EEG and frequency analyses\nn = 4 CAR\n\u2212/\u2212\nC57/BL6j and n = 4 WT mice were implanted in the fronto-parietal cortex and were\nused to characterize baseline EEG activity. Each mouse was monitored using video-EEG for a total of 50 h (50% night and 50%\nday) over a period of 1 week. EEG signals were acquired at 200\u2013600 Hz \u2013 stored and analyzed using Neuroscore and\nMatLab. Ten minutes EEG samples were extracted from all recordings and: i) classi-fied as day or night; ii) separated by\nawake/exploratory vs sleep (Video); iii) video analysis ruled out motion artifacts associated with scratching, eating,\ndrinking or chewing. As a result we obtained the following number of EEG extracts: n = 39 WT awake/exploratory, n = 43 WT\nsleep, n = 34 CAR\n\u2212/\u2212\nawake/exploratory and n = 31 CAR\n\u2212/\u2212\nsleep. The latter\ncorresponded to the EEG time: 390 min WT awake/exploratory, 430 min WT sleep, 340 min CAR\n\u2212/\u2212\nawake/exploratory and 310 min CAR\n\u2212/\u2212\nsleep. All EEG samples were processed using Neuroscore\n(Periodogram Power Bands; epoch duration 10 s) to calculate the relative value (0\u2013100%) within each 0.5 Hz increments\n(0.5\u201330 Hz).\n2.3.2. Kainic acid injection\nA total of n = 16 CAR\n\u2212/\u2212\nC57/BL6j and n = 16 C57/BL6j WT mice were used for video-EEG or\nRacine behavioral monitoring of status epilepticus (SE) induced using i.p. kainic acid (KA, 25 mg/kg; stock solution 10 mg/ml\nKA in PBS, pH = 7). In particular, n = 7 CAR\n\u2212/\u2212\nC57/BL6j and n = 7 C57/BL6j WT mice were implanted\nwith fronto-parietal cortical electrodes and EEG recordings. Mice were monitored up to 24 h after KA. The following endpoints\nwere determined: i) number of mice developing SE; ii) time of SE onset; iii) time spent in generalized SE normalized by the\ntotal duration of each EEG recording (from KA injection to death or up to 5 h to follow SE onset and evolution). Briefly, mice\nwere anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, placed on a stereotaxic frame and the skull exposed. A preamplifier (2 differential\nchannels, Pinnacle Inc., USA) was connected to EEG leads. Mice were left unrestrained for one week.\n2.3.3. CINPA1 injections\nA cohort of male adult C57/BL6j WT mice (n = 3) was repetitively injected with CINPA1 (5605, Tocris Bioscience), a\nnovel and potent CAR antagonist exhibiting high selectivity for CAR over other xenobiotic NR1I (\nCherian et al., 2015a\n,\n2015b\n). CINPA1 has low molecular weight (395 Da) and\nit is lipophilic (LogP > 3), therefore penetrating cell membranes (\nCherian et al.,\n2015a\n,\n2015b\n). A dose response was performed (1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg)\nbased on available IC\n50\n(\nCherian et al., 2015a\n,\n2015b\n). Video-EEG was recorded for 24 h following each injection. Control group refers to video-EEG\n(12 to 24 h) recorded before CINPA1 injections in each animal. Video-EEG data were sorted and extracted as described above\n(see\nSupplemental Table 1\n). The following number of EEG extracts (5\nminutes each) were analyzed: n = 31 awake/exploration and n = 33 sleep (control); n = 52 awake/exploration and n = 87 sleep (1\nmg/kg CINPA1); n = 63 awake/exploration and n = 97 sleep (10 mg/kg CINPA1).\n\n2.4. Microvessel isolation, western blot and quantifications\n2.4.1. Capillary isolation\nWe performed 2 separate experiments (i and ii) pulling together the cortical and hippocampal preparations obtained\nfrom: i) n = 5 CAR\n\u2212/\u2212\nand n = 5 WT; ii) n = 6 CAR\n\u2212/\u2212\nand n = 6 WT mice (see\nFig. 4\n). The latter was implemented to obtain a sufficient protein yield, amenable\nfor subsequent western blot analysis. A detailed procedure is described in\nShawahna et al.\n(2011)\n. Briefly, white matter, meninges, midbrain, choroid plexus, and olfactory lobes were removed from the brains\nand the remaining tissue (hippocampi and cortices) homogenized. Tissue was kept in cold PBS (2.7 mM KCl, 1.5 mM\nKH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 136.9 mM NaCl, 8.1 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 1 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM\nMgCl\n2\n, 5 mM D-glucose, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate) throughout the isolation procedure. An aliquot of 30% Ficoll\nwas added to an equal volume of brain homogenate and capillaries were separated from the parenchyma by centrifuging at 5800g\nfor 20 min. Capillaries were isolated using selective filtrations (>20 \u03bcm and <100 \u03bcm).\nFig. 4.\nOpen in a new tab\nCerebrovascular morphology and tight junction expression in CAR\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice.

Inserts i) and ii) refer to two separate experiments where a\ntotal of n = 10 and n = 12 mice were used. N refers to the number of mice that were pulled together obtaining one corresponding WB\nband.\n2.4.2. Whole brain tissues\nBriefly, cortical, and hippocampal tissues were homogenized using a buffer containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate\n(SDS), protease inhibitor cocktail (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM\nNa\n3\nVO\n4\n, 40 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Samples where then\ncentrifuged (12,000 rpm for 10 min) and protein content quantified.\n2.4.3. Western blots\nSamples were separated by electrophoresis and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After 1 h of blocking\nin skimmed milk, the membranes were probed overnight at 4 \u00b0C with a mouse anti-Zona Occludens 1 (1:400; 339100,\nInvitrogen), mouse anti-Claudin 5 (1:800; 352500, Invitrogen) or mouse anti-Actin (1:10,000; ab6276, Abcam). Secondary goat\nanti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated (1:4000) antibody was used. Relative band densities were measured and\nnormalized using ImageJ. WB bands obtained using isolated microvessels (\nFig. 4D\n) are not\nquantified as they represent tissue mean signals of i) n = 5 and ii) n = 6 mice/group.\n\n2.5. Transparent SeeDB brain, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry\nTransparent brain preparation was performed on CAR\n\u2212/\u2212\nand WT mice following the procedures\ndescribed by\nKe et al. (2013)\n. Briefly, mice were perfused intracardially using a 25 mg/ml\nsolution of FITC-albumin (300 \u03bcl/mouse). The fronto-parietal cortices were isolated, treated using the SeeDB protocol\n(\nKe et al., 2013\n) and analyzed using 2-photon microscopy (see\nFig. 4A\nand\nSupplemental Movies 1\n\u2013\n2\n). Electron microscopy was performed at the Core Facility (University of\nMontpellier, France) from hippocampal and cortical blocks.\n2.5.1. Tight junctions\nA total of n = 6 WT and n = 6 CAR\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice were used specifically for this\nimmunohistochemistry. After perfusion with PBS mice brains were dissected and immerged in sucrose 30%. Brains were then snap\nfrozen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Slices (20 \u03bcm) were obtained using a cryostat. Slices were post-fixed\ndirectly on the slide using methanol/acetone (v/v 50/50) at \u221220 \u00b0C and immerged in the solution for 1 min.\nImmunohistochemistry was performed after PBS washes.

    "Methods": "In the present study, we combined recent published studies (Braga et al., 2006,Zoccal et al., 2008,Molkov et al., 2011,Moraes et al., 2012a,McBryde et al., 2013,Moraes et al., 2014) and new experimental data obtained in thein situarterially perfused preparation of decerebrate rats, as described in details below.\n\nExperimental data\nAnimals and ethical approval\nExperiments were performed on male Holtzman rats, weighing 70\u201390 g, obtained from the Animal Care Unit of the S\u00e3o Paulo State University, Araraquara, and kept at 22\u00b11 \u00b0C on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on 06:00 \u2013 lights off 18:00), with access to food and water\nad libitum\n. All experimental approaches followed the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH publication No. 85-23 revised 1996) and by the Brazilian National Council for Animal Experimentation Control (CONCEA), and was approved by the Local Ethical Committee in Animal Experimentation (protocol 18/2014).\nChronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH)\nThe rats were exposed to CIH as previously described (\nZoccal et al., 2008\n). Briefly, the animals were housed in collective cages (maximum of 5 animals per cage) and maintained inside chambers equipped with gas injectors as well as sensors of O\n2\n, CO\n2\n, humidity and temperature, at controlled conditions of temperature (22\u00b11\u00b0C) and humidity (55\u00b110%). The CIH protocol consisted of 5 minutes of normoxia (FiO\n2\nof 20.8%) followed by 4 minutes of pure N\n2\ninjection into the chamber in order to reduce the fraction of inspired O\n2\n(FiO\n2\n) to 6%, remaining at this level for 40 seconds. After this hypoxic period, pure O\n2\nwas injected to return the FiO\n2\nback to 20.8%. This 9-minute cycle was repeated 8 hours a day (from 9:30 am to 5:30 pm) for 10 days. During the remaining 16 hours, the animals were maintained at a FiO\n2\nof 20.8%. The injections of N\n2\nand O\n2\n(White Martins, S\u00e3o Carlos, Brazil) were regulated by a solenoid valve system whose opening-closing control was performed by a computerized system (Oxycycler, Biospherix, USA). In an identical chamber in the same room, the control group was exposed to a FiO\n2\nof 20.8% 24 hours a day for 10 days. The control rats were also exposed to a similar valve noise due to the frequent injection of O\n2\nto maintain the FiO\n2\nat 20.8%. In both CIH and control chambers, the gas injections were performed at the upper level of the chamber in order to avoid direct jets of gas impacting on the animals, which could cause stress.\nIn situ arterially perfused preparation of decerebrate rats\nArterially perfused preparations (\nPaton, 1996\n) of control and CIH rats were surgically prepared, as previously described (\nZoccal et al., 2008\n). The rats were deeply anesthetized with halothane (AstraZeneca, Cotia, SP, Brazil) until loss of paw withdrawal reflex, transected caudal to the diaphragm, submerged in a chilled Ringer solution (in mM: NaCl, 125; NaHCO\n3\n, 24; KCl, 3; CaCl\n2\n, 2.5; MgSO\n4\n, 1.25; KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.25; dextrose, 10) and decerebrated at the precollicular level. Lungs were removed. Preparations were then transferred to a recording chamber, the descending aorta was cannulated and perfused retrogradely with Ringer solution containing 1.25 % Polyethylene glycol (an oncotic agent, Sigma, St Louis, USA) and a neuromuscular blocker (vecuronium bromide, 3\u20134 \u00b5g.mL\n\u22121\n, Crist\u00e1lia Produtos Qu\u00edmicos Farmac\u00eauticos Ltda., S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil), using a roller pump (Watson-Marlow 502s, Falmouth, Cornwall, UK) via a double-lumen cannula. The perfusion pressure was maintained in the range of 50\u201370 mmHg by adjusting the flow rate to 21\u2013 25 ml.min\n\u22121\nand by adding vasopressin to the perfusate (0.6 \u2013 1.2 nM, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The perfusate was gassed continuously with 5% CO\n2\n-95% O\n2\n, warmed to 31\u201332\u00b0C and filtered using a nylon mesh (pore size: 25 \u00b5m, Millipore, Billirica, MA, USA). Sympathetic and respiratory nerves were isolated and their activity recorded simultaneously using bipolar glass suction electrodes held in micromanipulators (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). Left phrenic nerve (PN) discharges were recorded from its central end and its rhythmic ramping activity was used to monitor preparation viability. Left cervical vagus (cVN) and hypoglossal nerves (HN) as well as right thoracic/lumbar abdominal nerves (AbN; T13-L1) were isolated, cut distally and their central activity recorded. Thoracic sympathetic activity was recorded from the left sympathetic chain (tSN) at T8\u2013T12 level. All the signals were amplified, band-pass filtered (0.1\u20133 kHz; P511, Grass Technologies, Middleton, USA) and acquired in an A/D converter (CED micro 1401, Cambridge Electronic Design, CED, Cambridge, UK) to a computer using Spike 2 software (5 KHz, CED, Cambridge, UK). At the end of the experiments, the perfusion pump was turned off to determine the electrical noise (after the death of the preparations).\nAll analyses were carried out on rectified and integrated signals (time constant of 50 ms) and performed off-line using Spike 2 software (CED, Cambridge, UK) after noise subtraction. PN burst frequency was determined from the time interval between consecutive integrated phrenic peak bursts and expressed in bursts per minute (bpm). tSN activity was measured as the mean values (in \u00b5V) of integrated signals. The changes in the PN burst frequency and tSN in response to peripheral chemoreflex activation were expressed as percentage values in relation to basal values prior to the stimulus.\nPeripheral chemoreflex activation\nPeripheral chemoreceptors were stimulated in the\nin situ\npreparations by injections of potassium cyanide (KCN 0.05%, 50 \u00b5l) into the descending aorta via the perfusion cannula as previously described (\nCosta-Silva et al., 2010\n). The stimulation of the peripheral chemoreflex receptors by KCN produced consistent autonomic and respiratory responses, which present low variability within and among the experiments.\nStatistical analyses\nThe data were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of mean (SEM). Before analysis, data normal distribution was tested using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test. The sympathoexcitatory and tachypneic responses to peripheral chemoreceptor activation in control and CIH rats were compared using, unpaired Student\u2019s t-test or two-way ANOVA for repeated measurements followed by Newman-Keuls post-test, respectively. The analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism software (version 5, La Jolla, CA, USA) and differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.\n\nModeling and simulations\nThe model presented here is based on a previous model of central chemoreceptor sensitization from (\nMolkov et al., 2011\n,\nMolkov et al., 2014b\n), which in turn combined a model describing the origin of abdominal late-E activity (\nMolkov et al., 2010\n) and a model describing sympathy-respiratory coupling in the context of the baroreflex (\nBaekey et al., 2010\n). All of these models descend from the model described by\nRybak et al. (2007)\nand\nSmith et al. (2007)\n, which explains the change in respiratory patterns due to successive pontine and medullary transections performed in rats. Most neuronal populations were composed of single-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley style neuronal models. Each population contained 20 or 50 neurons. Neurons in postsynaptic populations each received input from every neuron in the presynaptic population or the appropriate drive element. The output of certain populations, including motoneurons, was obtained by integrating excitatory synaptic input. Heterogeneity of model parameters and initial conditions (such as membrane potential, calcium concentration, and gating variables) were set by random distributions. Parameters for synaptic weights including changes relative to\nMolkov et al. (2011)\ncan be found in\nTable 1\n.\nTable 1.\nWeights of synaptic connections in the network.\nTarget\nPopulation\nExcitatory Drive [weight of synaptic input] or\nPresynaptic Source Population [weight of synaptic\ninput from single neuron]\nIE(pons)\nRTN-late-E\n\u2020\nRTN-cpg\n\u2020\nRVLM\nramp-I (rVRG) [0.025]\n*\nDrive CO2 [1.08]\n#\nDrive CO2 [1.08]\n#\n, 2nd Chemo (NTS) [0.1]\n#\nCVLM [\u22120.0125]\n*\n, Drive (VLM) [0.3]\n*\n, IE (pons)\n[0.3]\n*\n, early-I (2) (rVRG) [\u22120.01], late-E (pFRG)\n[0.03], 2nd Chemo (NTS) [0.01]\n#\n, post-I (BotC) [\u2212\n0.01]\n*\n, post-I (cVRG) [0.15]\n#\naug-E (BotC)\nDrive (pons) [2.7], early-I (1) (pre-BotC) [\u22120.135],\npost-I (BotC) [\u22120.3]\nearly-I (1)\n(pre-BotC)\nDrive (pons) [1.1]\n*\n, RTN-cpg [1], aug-E (BotC) [\u2212\n0.265]\n*\n, 2nd Chemo (NTS) [0.05]\n#\n,post-I (BotC) [\u2212\n0.45], pre-I/I (pre-BotC) [0.1]\nearly-I (2)\n(rVRG)\nlate-E (pFRG)\nDrive (pons) [2.5], aug-E (BotC) [\u22120.25], late-E\n(pFRG)[0.1], post-I (BotC) [\u22120.5]\nRTN-late-E [0.18]\n#\n, RTN-cpg [0.12]\n#\n, early-I (1)\n(pre-BotC) [\u22120.0425]\n*\n, late-E (pFRG) [0.024]\n*\n, post-\nI (BotC) [\u22120.03]\n*\n, pre-I/I (pre-BotC) [0.015]\n#\n2nd Chemo\n(NTS)\n\u2020\nPeripheral Chemoreflex Stimulation [0.75\na\n/1.6\nb\n]\n#\npost-I (BotC)\nDrive (pons) [1.65]\n*\n, RTN-cpg [0.05]\n#\n, aug-E\n(BotC) [\u22120.01]\n*\n, early-I (1) (pre-BotC) [\u22120.025],\npost-I (cVRG)\n\u2020\naug-E (BotC) [\u22120.03]\n#\n, early-I (1) (pre-BotC) [\u2212\n0.05]\n#\n, 2nd Chemo [0.0375]\n#\npost-I (e)\n(BotC)\nDrive (pons) [1]\n*\n, aug-E (BotC) [\u22120.2]\n*\n, early-I (2)\n(rVRG) [\u22120.01]\n*\npre-I/I (pre-\nBotC)\nDrive (pons) [0.7]\n*\n, Drive (raphe) [0.3], RTN-cpg\n[0.11]\n*\n, aug-E (BotC) [\u22120.06], late-E (pFRG)\n[0.018]\n*\n, 2nd Chemo (NTS) [0.02]\n#\n, post-I (BotC)\n[0.16], pre-I/I (pre-BotC) [0.03]\nramp-I (rVRG)\nDrive (pons) [2], aug-E (BotC) [\u22120.1], early-I (2)\n(rVRG) [\u22120.3], post-I (BotC) [\u22122], pre-I/I (pre-BotC)\n[0.12]\nOpen in a new tab\n*\nweights that differ in value from (\nMolkov et al., 2011\n).\n#\nprojections that did not exist in (\nMolkov et al., 2011\n).\n\u2020\nnew populations that did not exist in (\nMolkov et al., 2011\n) or (\nMolkov et al., 2010\n).\na\nchemosensory drive for control simulations during peripheral chemoreflex.\nb\nchemosensory drive for CIH simulations during peripheral chemoreflex.\nSimulations were performed using the NSM simulation package version 3.0 developed at Drexel University by S.

    "Methods": "Animals\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (2\u20135 months old; colony 218A, Harlan; Indianapolis, IN) were studied. Rats were double-housed with food and water\nad libitum\n, a 12h light/dark cycle with controlled humidity and temperature. The University of Wisconsin Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal procedures/protocols.\n\nsiRNA and Cholera Toxin B fragment delivery\nsiRNAs were prepared per manufacturer instructions (Dharmacon Inc). Pools of four Accell-modified siRNA (21 base pairs) duplexes targeting different mRNA sequences were used; each duplex was either non-targeting (siNT) or targeting TrkB (siTrkB). siTrkB duplexes targeted the following sequences: GCUUAAAGUUUGUGGCUUA, CUAAUGGCCAAGAAUGAAU, GUAUCAGCUAUCAAACAAC, and GCACCAACCAUCACAUUUC. Accell-modified siRNAs were used because they preferentially transfect neurons (\nNakajima et al., 2012\n).\nEach pool was suspended in Dharmacon siRNA buffer at a concentration of 5\u03bcM, aliquotted and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Prior to intrapleural injections, 20\u03bcl of siRNA was added to 6\u03bcl of 5X siRNA buffer (Dharmacon), 3.2\u03bcl of Oligofectamine Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen), 0.8 \u03bcl of RNAase free H\n2\nO (final siRNA concentration of 3.33 \u03bcM) and mixed for 20 min prior to injection, thus enabling siRNAs to complex with the transfection reagent.\nCholera toxin B (CtB) fragment and siRNAs were injected intrapleurally similar to earlier reports to respectively back-label phrenic motor neurons (\nMantilla et al., 2009\n) and induce RNA interference (\nMantilla et al., 2013\n). Anesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane in 100% O\n2\n, and then maintained via nose cone (3.5% isoflurane, 100% O\n2\n). 12.5\u03bcl of CtB (2\u03bcg/\u03bcl in sterile H\n2\nO) was loaded into a 25\u03bcl Hamilton syringe attached to a 6mm sterile needle before bilateral injections (2\u00d712.5\u03bcL of 2\u03bcg/\u03bcL total) at the 5\nth\nintercostal space anterior axillary line 7 days prior to tissue harvest. Intrapleural siRNAs were delivered daily as 30\u03bcl injections bilaterally (2\u00d730\u03bcL of 5\u03bcM siRNA) from a 50\u03bcl Hamilton syringe 3, 2 and 1 day prior to tissue harvest or neurophysiology experiments (outlined in\nFigure 1A\n). This technique was adapted from previous reports using intrapleural siRNA injections to knockdown gene expression within phrenic motor neurons (\nMantilla et al., 2013\n;\nDevinney et al., 2015\n). After injections, isoflurane was discontinued and chest movements were monitored for signs of distress and/or pneumothorax (none observed). Rats were housed and monitored daily until used for neurophysiology or immunohistochemistry (IHC) experiments.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nIntrapleural siTrkB injections abolish pLTF.\nA)\nAfter siTrkB, siNT or vehicle injections (1), rats were given either Nx or AIH, and assessed for pLTF (2).\nB)\nIn compressed phrenic neurograms, rats given vehicle (top) or siNT (second trace) exhibit pLTF following AIH; in contrast, rats receiving siTrkB (third trace) did not express pLTF following AIH. Control trace of rats receiving intrapleural vehicle injections without AIH (bottom) also did not exhibit pLTF.\nC)\nAIH increases phrenic burst amplitude in control (\u25a0; n=11) and siNT rats (\u25cf; n=5), but not siTrkB rats (\u25cb; n=7), relative to Nx (\u25b2; n=9) controls 60-min post-AIH.\nD)\nAIH elicited small increases in frequency within vehicle (\u25a0) and siNT (\u25cf) rats (versus baseline), but not siTrkB rats (\u25cb). Mean values \u00b1 1S.E.M. * vs baseline (p < 0.001); # vs vehicle + Nx at same time point (p<0.02); \u2020 vs vehicle + AIH at same time (p<0.001).\n\nExperimental groups\nFour rat groups were studied for neurophysiology experiments: 1) siTrkB + AIH (n=7); 2) siNT + AIH (n=5); 3) vehicle +AIH (n=11); 4) vehicle + normoxia (Nx). Normoxia control groups experienced persistent ventilation with normoxia air (50% O\n2\n+ 2% CO\n2\n+ 48% N\n2\n). 3 separate rat groups were used for IHC analysis. The IHC groups received intrapleural CtB and siRNA injections (outlined above) but did not undergo the neurophysiology protocol (outlined below). The IHC groups were: 1) siTrkB (n=6); 2) siNT (n=6); 3) vehicle (n=6). 50 total rats were used in this study.\n\nNeurophysiology experiments\nAnesthetic induction (5% isoflurane in 100% O\n2\n) occurred in a closed chamber, followed by maintenance with a nose cone (3.5% isoflurane in 50% O\n2\n; 2% CO\n2\n; 48% N\n2\n). Rats were tracheotomized and pump ventilated for the duration of experiments (2.5 ml, Rodent Ventilator, model 683; Harvard Apparatus; South Natick, MA, USA). Rats were bilaterally vagotomized to eliminate lung stretch-receptor feedback and ventilator entrainment, and the right femoral artery was catheterized for measurement of arterial blood pressure and to allow for sampling of arterial blood for blood gas analysis. The left phrenic nerve was isolated via a dorsal approach, cut distally, de-sheathed, submerged in mineral oil and placed on bipolar silver wire electrodes. After nerve dissection rats were slowly converted to urethane anesthesia (1.8g/kg, i.v. tail vein). Supplemental urethane was provided if rats showed a positive toe pinch response (any purposeful movement or cardiorespiratory response to toe pinch). After ensuring adequate anesthesia, rats were paralyzed with pancuronium bromide (2.5mg/kg, i.v.). Body temperature (measured via rectal probe; Traceable\n\u2122\n, Fisher Scientific; Pittsburgh, PA, USA) was maintained within \u00b1 0.3\u00b0C of baseline (37.5\u00b0C) with a custom temperature-controlled surgical table. A flow-through capnograph with sufficient response time to measure end-tidal CO\n2\nin rats (Capnogard, Novametrix; Wallingford, CT; USA) was used to monitor CO\n2\n. A heparinized plastic capillary tube (Radiometer Medical Aps, Copenhagen, Denmark; 250\u00d7125\u03bcl cut in half) was used to monitor temperature corrected arterial blood gases (PaO\n2\nand PaCO\n2\n), pH and base excess (ABL 800Flex, Radiometer; Copenhagen, Denmark). Intravenous fluid infusions (1:1.7:5 by volume of NaHCO\n3\n/Lactated Ringer\u2019s/Hetastarch; 1.5\u20132.2ml/hr) were used to maintain blood pressure, acid/base and fluid balance.\nPhrenic nerve activity was amplified (x10,000: A-M Systems, Everett, WA), band-pass filtered (100Hz to 10kHz), full-wave rectified, processed as a continuous moving average (CWE 821 filter; Paynter, Ardmore, PA: time constant 50 ms) and analyzed using a WINDAQ data-acquisition system (DATAQ Instruments, Akron, OH). Peak integrated phrenic burst frequency and amplitude were analyzed in 60sec bins prior to blood samples. Data were included only if PaCO\n2\nwas maintained within \u00b1 1.5mmHg of baseline levels (set by recruitment threshold for each rat; see below), base excess was within \u00b1 3mEq/L of 0.0, and MAP decreased less than 30mmHg of baseline (approx. 120mmHg) values. Physiological variables are summarized within\nTable 1\n. There were no consistent differences between groups within a single time point, or within a single group at different time points. Nerve burst amplitude is expressed as a percent change from baseline; frequency is expressed as an absolute change from baseline (bpm).\nTable 1.

Baseline was then established by maintaining end-tidal PACO\n2\n1\u20132mmHg above the subsequent recruitment threshold \u2013 the PACO\n2\nat which phrenic inspiratory activity resumes following apnea (\nBach and Mitchell, 1996\n). Rats were exposed to normoxia gas levels to establish 20min of stable baseline nerve recordings. A blood sample was drawn to establish baseline blood gas values, and the rats were then exposed to either continuous normoxia or AIH (3, 5min episodes of 10% FIO\n2\n, 5min intervals). Subsequent arterial blood samples were taken at 15, 30 and 60min post-AIH. Electrophysiological data were analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA with repeated measures design and a Fisher LSD\npost-hoc\nanalysis (SigmaStat 2.03).\n\nImmunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence\nFollowing siRNA and CtB injections, 18 rats (n=6 per group; siTrkB, siNT, and vehicle) were euthanized and perfused transcardially with 1mL/g chilled 0.01M PBS followed by 1mL/g chilled 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at a pH of 7.4. The rats were shelf rats that did not receive any surgery related to neurophysiology experiments. The spinal cords were harvested and placed into 4% PFA for 8 hours at 4\u00b0C. The tissues were then transferred to 20% sucrose followed by 30% sucrose until sinking. 40\u03bcm transverse slices were cut using a microtome (SM2000R Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL) from C3\u2013C5 and placed into antifreeze solution (30% glycerol; 30% ethylene glycol; 40% 0.1M PBS). For each group, 8 slices from 6 rats (46 total slices per group) were selected for staining (slices were at least 200\u03bcm apart). Slices were washed with 0.05M tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton-X (TBS-Tx) and blocked with 1.0% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1hour. The tissues were stained with rabbit anti-TrkB (Santa Cruz Biotech) and goat anti-CtB (Millipore) at room temperature for 16hours. Using western blot and IHC, a previous study has confirmed the selectivity of the TrkB antibody (\nKrause et al. 2008\n). Slices were washed with TBS-Tx and subsequently stained with conjugated donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 595 (Invitrogen) and conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) for 2hours at room temperature. Tissue slices were washed a final time with TBS and mounted with coverslip and an anti-fade solution (Invitrogen). Slices were imaged on an epifluorescence confocal microscope at 20x using Nikon EZ-C1 software. The images were localized onto the phrenic nuclei cluster bilaterally via CtB identification and a reference control region (area immediately lateral to the central canal of C3\u2013C6) for each slice. Since TrkB is often concentrated in dendrites versus the cell soma (\nKovalchuk et al., 2002\n), and CtB retrograde tracer does not reach the peripheral dendrites, we quantified TrkB immunofluorescence (optical density) in a region of interest (diameter: 100 \u03bcm; area: 7.85 mm\n2\n; circumference: 314 \u03bcm) encompassing CtB labeled phrenic motor neurons at C3\u2013C5. The same dimensions were used for the medio-dorsal region of interest as well. While the total number of CtB labeled neurons was consistent among groups, CtB immunofluorescence within individual motor neurons decreased in rats treated with siRNA targeting TrkB mRNA, consistent with other studies showing that functional siRNAs can interrupt transport of retrograde tracers (\nMurashov et al., 2007\n). Thus, we did not attempt to normalize TrkB immunofluorescence to CtB staining, but relied on an \u201carea of interest\u201d measurement centered on CtB labeled cells, restricting analysis to the phrenic motor nucleus.\nTrkB quantification was done with NIH Image J Software. The siNT rat group was used as a reference (control); thus, changes in TrkB immunofluorescence in other groups were expressed relative to siNT rats. Staining was completed in 2 batches with equal representation of samples from each group in each batch (vehicle, siNT and siTrkB); changes in TrkB immunofluorescence were adjusted relative to the average optical density in siNT rats included in each batch. One way ANOVA was used, with a Fisher\u2019s LSD\npost hoc\ntest to compare individual groups."

    "Methods": "2.1. Developmental expression of Ciz1 transcripts\nExpression patterns of\nCiz1\ntranscripts in C57BL/6J mice were established with relative quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (QRT-PCR) using tissues from cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, ventral midbrain, striatum, thalamus, spinal cord, and liver. We examined 6 mice (3 male, 3 female) at each of 9 developmental time points (E15, P1, P7, P14, P21, P30, 2 mo, 6 mo, and 1 yr). TaqMan-based QRT-PCR was performed with Ambion's RETROscript\u00ae Reverse Transcription Kit and a LightCycler\u00ae 480 System (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Two primer pairs were designed to examine expression of both Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) isoforms (CCDS57166.1 [2376 nt] and CCDS15911.1 [2538 nt]), in aggregate, or the longer isoform (CCDS15911.1, 2538 nt), in isolation, with \u03b2-actin as the endogenous control (\nFig. 1A\n,\nSupplemental Table 1\n). As seen in\nFig. 1A\n, primers 31F and 31R should amplify all RefSeq and most predicted Ensembl isoforms. In contrast, only RefSeq isoform\nNM_028412.2\nand a subset of predicted Ensembl isoforms should be amplified with primers 18F and 18R. Data were normalized to E15 liver. Detailed methods are provided in previous work from our laboratory (\nXiao et al., 2012\n).\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Schematic representation of\nCiz1\nisoforms. Two distinct primer pairs were designed to examine expression of both CCDS isoforms, in aggregate, or the longer isoform (CCDS15911.1), in isolation, with \u03b2-actin as the endogenous control. Primers pairs: 31F/31R and 18F/18R. Relative to E15 liver, neural expression of\nCiz1\nisoforms amplified by primer pair 31F/31R (B) and primer pair 18F/18R (C) increase with increasing postnatal age. Among those neural structures subjected to analysis,\nCiz1\nexpression was highest in cerebellum.\n\n2.2. Generation of Ciz1\n\u2212/\u2212\ngene-trap mice\nAll mouse experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health's Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nCiz1\n+/\u2212\nmice were generated by the Texas A&M Institute for Genomic Medicine with the gene trapped clone IST13830B6 (\nCiz1\nGt(IST13830B6)Tigm\n) which has an insertion fragment localized to Intron 1 of\nCiz1\nisoform\nNM_028412.2\n. Upon establishment of germline transmission,\nCiz1\ngene-trap mice were bred to C57BL/6J mice for at least 6 generations. All experiments used\nCiz1\n+/+\nlittermates on the same genetic background. Three primers (\nSupplemental Table 1\n) were used for PCR-based genotyping of\nCiz1\nmutant mice with one primer located within the gene trap vector (V76F) and the two other primers located within Intron 1 of\nCiz1\nand flanking the gene trap insertion. The Mouse Direct PCR kit from Biotool (Houston, TX, USA) was used for genotyping with the following cycling conditions: 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, 35 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 30 s. The WT allele yields a 406 bp amplicon whereas the gene-trap allele generates a 292 bp amplicon.\n\n2.3. Hematology and serum chemistry\nRetro-orbital venous blood was acquired from WT and\nCiz1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice as a terminal procedure after pentobarbital overdose (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). Blood was collected into Becton Dickinson Microtainer\u2122 K\n2\nEDTA and clot activator tubes for hematological and serum chemistry studies, respectively. Complete blood counts with differentials and platelet counts were acquired with a VetScan HM5 Hematology System (Abaxsis, Union City, CA, USA). Serum chemistry studies were performed by IDEXX BioResearch (West Sacramento, CA, USA).\n\n2.4. Ciz1 expression in gene-trap mice\nRelative levels of mouse\nCiz1\nmRNA were determined in 6 brain regions (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, and midbrain), cervical spinal cord, and liver harvested from 3 male mice (3 mo) of each genotype (\nCiz1\n+/\u2212\n,\nCiz1\n\u2212/\u2212\n, and WT). TaqMan-based QRT-PCR was performed using two primer pairs and probes (\nSupplemental Table 1\n) with a LightCycler\u00ae 480 System (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Mouse \u03b2-actin and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) were used as endogenous controls.\n\n2.5. Qualitative Western blot analysis\nFor qualitative Western blots, whole brains from adult (3 mo) WT,\nCiz1\n+/\u2212\nand\nCiz1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice (\nn\n= 3 mice/genotype) were dissected to isolate the cerebellum and cerebral cortex. The tissues were lysed with ice-cold IP lysis buffer from Pierce\u2122 Classic Magnetic IP/Co-IP Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing Halt\u2122protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA) using a Teflon glass homogenizer. Lysed samples were microcentrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm and the supernatants were collected. Supernatants were pre-cleared with protein A/G magnetic beads for 3\u20134 h at 4 \u00b0C using a magnetic separation rack. Total protein (500 \u00b5g) was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with constant rocking using 4 \u00b5g of mouse anti-CIZ1 antibody (ab172442, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and pulled down the next morning with 25 \u00b5L of protein A/G magnetic beads for 4\u20136 h at 4 \u00b0C. Beads were washed 4 times in with ice-cold IP lysis buffer, and bound proteins eluted in 2\u00d7 SDS sample buffer. For Western blots, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (4\u201312% Bis-Tris gels) and transferred to PVDF membranes using a BioRad (Berkeley, CA, USA) wet transfer system. Subsequently, membranes were blocked for 2 h in 5% non-fat dry milk and incubated overnight with mouse anti-CIZ1 primary antibody (1:10,000; ab172442, Abcam) in phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20 (PBST) containing 5% non-fat dry milk. Membranes were washed three times with 1 \u00d7 PBST for 15 min and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h with constant rocking at room temperature. Signal was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, Pittsburgh, PA).\n\n2.6. Immunohistochemistry\nAdult (5 mo old)\nCiz1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice (\nn\n= 4) and WT littermates (\nn\n= 4) were overdosed with intraperitoneal pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) and perfused transcardially, first with ice cold saline and then 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4). Brains were removed and post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in 0.1M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The spleen and other organs (kidney, lung, liver, and colon) were blocked and embedded in paraffin. WT and\nCiz1\n\u2212/\u2212\nhindbrains were sectioned on a cryostat at 40 \u00b5m. The spleen was sectioned at 5 \u00b5m on a microtome. Paraffin sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, treated with an antigen unmasking solution (Citric Acid Based H-3300, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and rinsed with distilled water and PBS. Endogenous peroxidases were quenched with 1% H\n2\nO\n2\nin PBS and sections were rinsed with PBS followed by blocking with 2% non-fat dry milk and 0.3% Triton X-100. Sections were incubated with rabbit anti-CIZ1 antibody (1:500, A301-496A, Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA) overnight, rinsed and incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 4 h. After rinsing with PBS \u00d7 3, sections were developed using the Vectastain ABC Kit from Vector Laboratories and DAB (3.3\u2032-diaminobenzidine). Sections were mounted onto Superfrost\u2122 Plus glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and counter stained with cresyl violet to identify the anatomical locations of CIZ1-immunoreactivity (IR). Contiguous sections from the spleen were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.\n\n2.7. Behavioral assessments\nAdult (3 mo)\nCiz1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice (\nn\n= 15 male and 17 female) and gender-matched\nCiz1\n+/+\nlittermates (\nn\n= 16 male and 15 female) were subjected to a battery of motor and behavioral examinations including open-field activity, rotarod, vertical rope climbing, raised-beam task, grip strength, gait analysis (DigiGait\u2122), dominance tube, and cross-maze. Mice were examined weekly for evidence of dystonia or other involuntary movements during open-field activity and routine handling until 10 mo of age and then euthanized for whole-genome gene expression analyses. Righting reflex assays were performed prior to weaning in independent groups of\nCiz1\n+/+\n(\nn\n= 3 males and 2 females) and\nCiz1\n\u2212/\u2212\n(\nn\n= 3 males and 1 female) mice.\nOpen-field activity assay\nMice were placed in commercially-available activity monitors (MED Associates, Inc., Georgia, VT, USA) for 10-min sessions. The activity monitors measured 27 \u00d7 27 cm, with 16 infrared photocell beams equally spaced in the x and y axes of the horizontal plane, 1 cm from the floor of the chambers. An additional array of 16 photocells was situated 5 cm above the floor to track rearing. All tests were conducted in the dark. One hour prior to testing, cages were moved from the housing racks to a quiet anteroom adjacent to the testing room. Following this period of habituation, animals were removed from their home cage, immediately placed in the center of the open field and allowed to freely explore the apparatus for a test interval of 10 min. Animals were scored for a number of behaviors including total distance traveled (cm). The data recorded during testing was scored in post-session analyses using commercially-available software (Activity Monitor 5.1, Med Associates). The testing apparatus was cleaned with a 70% ethanol solution and allowed to air dry between mice. Mice were given 1 trial at the same time daily for 3 consecutive days. Median values of activity parameters were used for statistical comparisons.\nRotarod\nMice were acclimated to a Rotamex-5 rotarod (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA) rotating at 5 rpm for 5 min on the day prior to data acquisition. On the following day, mice were exposed to a 30 s acclimation period at 4 rpm followed by an acceleration of 4 rpm every 30 s to a target of 40 rpm at 5 min. Mice were given 3 trials at the same time each day for 5 consecutive days. Median values were used for statistical comparisons.\nVertical rope climb\nMice were acclimated to a vertical, 40-cm long, 10-mm thick nylon rope prior to testing. The bottom of the rope was suspended 15 cm above a padded base and the top entered into a darkened escape box. Three trials with a 5-min inter-trial interval were completed for each mouse. Median times were used for statistical analysis.\nRaised-beam task\nMice were acclimated to an 80-cm long, 20-mm wide beam elevated 50 cm above a padded base. A 60 W lamp at the start served as an aversive stimulus, whereas the opposite end of the beam entered a darkened escape box. Transversal time and number of slips were measured as mice traversed the beam. After initial testing with a 20-mm diameter square beam, mice were given follow-up tests using supplementary round (12-mm and 9-mm diameter) and square (12-mmand 9-mmdiameter) beams. All testing was performed in triplicate and median values were used for subsequent statistical analyses.\nGrip strength analysis\nTo measure grip strength, mice were held by the scruff of the neck with one hand and the base of the tail with the other hand. Mice were then free to grasp a metal grid attached to a force meter (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA) as they were moved along the axis of the grid. Maximal strength (g) with which mice pulled the grid was measured in triplicate trials with a minimal inter-trial interval of 5 min. Median values were used for subsequent statistical analyses.\nGait analysis\nThe DigiGait\u2122imaging system consists of a motorized treadmill with a digital camera positioned below a transparent belt (Mouse Specifics Inc., Boston, MA). For each mouse, the location and timing of each paw contact on the belt was automatically recorded at a belt speed of 20 cm/s for 5 s. A minimum of 800 video frames collected at 160 frames/s was digitized and gait parameters were calculated by the accompanying software (\nSupplemental Fig. 1\n). Three trials with 30 min inter-trial intervals were completed for each mouse. Median values were used for statistical analysis.\nRighting reflex\nMice (Postnatal Day 6 [P6] to P14) were placed in the supine position and then released. The time required for all four limbs to contact the tabletop is measured for three trials.\nCross-Maze analysis\nThe testing apparatus consisted of 4 radial arms, each 25 cm-long, and a camera along with ANY-maze software (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA). Mice were placed into the apparatus for 5 min and entries into each arm were recorded sequentially using an ABCD format with each letter representing an individual arm of the maze. Alternation was counted if mice went into radial arms sequentially (% alternations = 100 \u00d7 total alternations / [total entries \u2212 3]).\nDominance tube test\nThis test was used for identifying a general abnormality in social interaction through the measurement of aggression.\nCiz1\n+/+\nand\nCiz1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice were released into opposite ends of a dark, narrow tube (30-cm long).\nCiz1\n+/+\nand\nCiz1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice interacted in tube and the more dominant or aggressive mouse forced its opponent out of the tube. When one animal had all four paws out of the tube, it was declared the loser while the animal remaining inside the tube was the winner, ending the match. The number of wins was reported as a percentage of the total number of matches. The match was deemed a draw when both mice remained in the tube >120 s.\n\n2.8. Whole-genome gene expression analysis\nTotal RNA from mouse cerebellum was isolated from6 adult (10mo)\nCiz1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice (3 males and 3 females) and 6 age- and gender- matched\nCiz1\n+/+\ncontrols (Ambion\u2122 TRI Reagent\u00ae, ThermoFisher Scientific). This time point was chosen for analysis of gene expression given that the incidence of cervical dystonia in humans is highest in middle-aged adults (\nXiao et al., 2012\n,\nVemula et al., 2013\n). The quality of total RNA was assessed with a NanoDrop\u00ae ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies) and RNA integrity was verified with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kit. Whole-genome gene expression data were generated with the Affymetrix GeneChip\u00ae Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array (Santa Clara, CA, USA). This array was designed using data from RefSeq (release 51), Ensembl (release 65) and lncRNA db and provides comprehensive coverage of over 30,000 mRNA transcripts and 2000 lincRNA transcripts. The 2.0 ST Array was designed with a median of 22 25-mer probes per transcript. Each array includes background antigenomic probes, poly-A controls and hybridization controls. Target RNA was first reverse transcribed into cDNA, followed by in-vitro transcription to generate biotin-labelled cRNA for subsequent hybridization. Hybridized target cRNA were stained with streptavidin phycoerythrin and scanned using an Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner.\nData were processed using Affymetrix Expression Console software that incorporates the Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) normalization algorithm. Genes were annotated using Affymetrix MoGene 2.0 ST, V.1, release 35 annotation files from NetAffx\u2122 server of Affymetrix. The RMA-normalized .chp files were summarized further with GeneSpring GX\u00ae 13.1.1 (Agilent\u00ae Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Scatter plots were used to access the reproducibility of gene expression within genotypes (\nSupplemental Figs. 2 & 3\n). The\nt\n-test statistic was used in identifying significantly dysregulated genes (\np\n\u2264 0.05) betweenWT and\nCiz1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice. Differential gene expression was also analyzed using a False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrected\np\n\u2264 0.05 (\nBenjamini and Hochberg, 1995\n). A heat map created using unsupervised hierarchical clustering with average linkage and Euclidean distance (\nSupplemental Fig. 4\n) and a volcano plot (\nSupplemental Fig. 5\n) were used to visualize differential gene expression. Using WebGestalt (WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), we investigated the effects of differentially regulated genes on pathways (KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and molecular/cellular networks (\nZhang et al., 2005\n) using a stepwise collection of fold changes (1.10 [10%], 1.15 [15%], 1.20 [20%], and 1.25 [25%]). Data is provided for KEGG and IPA pathways enriched by genes with fold changes of 1.10 and 1.20, respectively.\nTo validate data obtained with the Affymetrix GeneChip\u00ae Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array, we selected 6 up-regulated and 6 down-regulated genes, moderately expressed in cerebellum, for QRT-PCR. Using Taqman probes, QRT-PCRwas performed on the Roche LightCycler\u00ae 480 system with primers designed on the Roche Universal ProbeLibrary Assay Design Center (\nhttps://lifescience.roche.com/shop/en/us/overviews/brand/universal-probe-library\n). A total of 16 cerebellar RNA samples from WT and\nCiz1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice (8 males and 8 females in each group, including the 6 samples used for whole-genome gene expression analysis) were employed for validation with \u03b2-actin as the endogenous control. Technical triplicates were performed for all samples and median values were utilized for statistical analysis.\n\n2.9. Statistics\nANOVA with post-hoc tests was used to determine the effects of genotype and gender on parametric behavioral measures. The Mann-Whitney test was used to determine the effects of genotype within gender for a non-parametric behavioral measure (slips on the raised beam task). Two-tailed\nt\n-tests were used to determine the effects of genotype on hematology and chemistry parameters. Fisher's exact test was used to determine the effects of genotype on the results of dominance tube testing. An alpha (\u03b1) of 0.05 was chosen for statistical significance."

    "Methods": "Mice\nAdult (8-12 weeks) wild-type C57BL/6 mice were used. All experimental procedures were complied with institutional and governmental guidelines for animal research and approved by the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.\n\nMonoclonal anti-glycan antibody\nTwo disease relevant anti-ganglioside monoclonal antibody (mAb), GD1a/GT1b-2b (a prototypic IgG2b mAb against GD1a/GT1b) and GT1b-2b (IgG2b mAb with specificity for GT1b), were used in this study. We have demonstrated that these mAbs inhibit axon regeneration, prevent target re-innervation and induce injury to intact nerve fibers in different animal models (\nHe\net al.\n, 2015\n;\nLehmann et al., 2007\n;\nZhang et al., 2011\n). The generation, specificity, and production, of these mAb were reported previously (\nLunn et al., 2000\n;\nSchnaar et al., 2002\n). The hollow fiber supernatant containing anti-ganglioside mAb was used in all animal studies. An irrelevant mouse isotype matched IgG-2b mAb (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was used as a negative control.\n\nPreparation of sIVIg and uIVIg\nSambucus Nigra Lectin (SNL) chromatography (Vector Laboratories) was performed on whole IVIg (Octagam, Octapharma) to prepare terminal sialic acid-enriched (sIVIg) and sialic acid-depleted (uIVIg) IVIg fractions, as described (\nKaneko\net al.\n, 2006\n). Briefly, IVIg (40mg) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) were loaded to a column of SNL resin (4ml), and incubated for 10-15 mins at room temperature. The column was then washed with TBS, and the un-bound IVIg fractions (uIVIg) were collected. The bound proteins (sIVIg; ~2-3mg) were eluted with 0.5 M lactose in TBS. The efficiency of this lectin affinity purification is in 5-8% range. Both uIVIg and sIVIg were dialyzed against 1X PBS prior to usage.\n\nSciatic nerve crush model\nA well-established nerve crush model was used to study the efficacy of different interventions. Nerve crush provides a convenient and well characterized system to study the regeneration of injured axons mimicking the regenerative response of degenerating axons in GBS, and it also allows us to study the factors affecting nerve repair. Briefly, the left sciatic nerve was crushed at middle thigh level on day 0, as described (\nLehmann\net al.\n, 2007\n). Single dose of individual anti-glycan mAb or sham mAb (0.5-1mg) was injected on day 3 via intra-peritoneal route (i.p.). Daily injection of whole IVIg (2g/kg per day; i.p.), sIVIg (0.2g/kg per day; i.p.), uIVIg (2g/kg per day i.p.,), IL-33 (500 ng per day; subcutaneously; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or vehicle control (subcutaneously) were given to animals 5 days/week for 2 weeks after the nerve crush. For IVIg dose-response study, 0-2g/kg/day of whole IVIg was administered i.p. for 5 days/week for 2 weeks. Behavioral testing and electrophysiology were performed on all animals. The experiments were terminated on day 17 after the crush. All animals were perfused, sciatic and tibial nerves were harvested.\n\nBehavioral assessment\nPinprick tests were used to evaluate sensory functional recovery. The tests were performed 1 day prior to the surgery and on indicated days post nerve crush, as described (\nZhang\net al.\n, 2014\n). Briefly, the needle was gently applied to the lateral part of the plantar surface of the hind paw, and the animal responses to the needle prick were recorded. The Pinprick testing was performed blindly at indicated time points.\n\nElectrophysiology\nThe motor function recovery after sciatic nerve crush was monitored by a sciatic nerve conduction test, which was performed on all animals, as described (\nLehmann\net al.\n, 2007\n). Briefly, mice were anesthetized and placed on the heating pad, and their body temperature was monitored and maintained at 35\u201337\u00b0C. On day 16 post sciatic nerve crush, compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude was recorded from the hind paw with needle electrodes inserted in the sole of the foot and sciatic and tibial nerves were stimulated proximally at the sciatic notch.\n\nMorphometry\nThe harvested sciatic and tibial nerves were post-fixed in a mixture of 3% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde. The fixed nerves were embedded in Epon, and stained with toluidine blue. All myelinated axons in a single whole transverse section of the nerve were counted by using a motorized stage and stereotactic imaging software (Axiovision; Zeiss, Thornwood, NY), as described (\nLehmann\net al.\n, 2007\n;\nZhang\net al.\n, 2014\n).\n\nQuantitative Real-time PCR for IL-33 expression\nMice were treated with whole IVIg (2g/kg), sIVIg (0.2g/kg), or uIVIg (2g/kg), to determine their effects on modulating IL-33 expression. In subsequent studies, IVIg dose responsiveness (0-2g/kg) on IL-33 expression was examined. Spleens were removed one hour after intravenous administration of whole IVIg, sIVIg or uIVIg for further analysis, as described (\nAnthony\net al.\n, 2011\n). Total RNA was extracted from splenocytes according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction (Invitrogen). cDNA was generated through reverse transcription from 0.2 \u03bcg of each RNA sample by using High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA master mix (Life Technologies). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed on ABI Step-One Plus (Applied Biosystems) using TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Life Technologies). 18s was used as normalization control. All PCR were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times.\n\nGanglioside ELISA\nGanglioside ELISA was used to determine the anti-ganglioside antibody level in animal serum before and after administration of exogenous anti-glycan mAbs with or without different types of IVIg (whole IVIg; sIVIg; uIVIg). Serum samples were collected from the tail vein of animals on days 0, 5, 10, 17 after IVIg administration, and ELISA was performed, as described (\nLunn\net al.\n, 2000\n).\n\nStatistics\nData are reported as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Differences between groups were examined by Student's t-test and two-way ANOVA with corrections for multiple comparisons, and\np\n< 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Mice\nExperiments were conducted in accordance with The Ohio State University Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee. A total of 85 mice were used in these studies. Adult (3-4 months of age) female C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and n=4 were excluded as described below. WT mice were partitioned into sister groups for ELISA, histology, measures of vascular permeability, or chimerization. The chimeric mice were engineered by adoptively transferring bone marrow from a C57BL/6-Tg(CAG-EGFP) donor (3-4 months of age, Jackson) into a busulfan-treated C57BL/6J recipient mice (1-2 months of age, Jackson). MMP-9 null (MMP9\nKO\n) female mice (B6.FVB(Cg)-Mmp9\ntm1Tvu\n/J) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. Mice were housed 3-5 per cage and provided food and water ad libitum.\n\nEngineering of GFP\n+\nBM-chimera\nRecipient BM C57BL/6 female mice (6-8 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally once daily for two consecutive days with busulfan in a 1:1 solution of DMSO and deionized H2O (30 mg/kg/100 \u03bcl). The selected dosage of busulfan results in partial BM ablation and limited morbidity (\nWohleb et al., 2013\n). Donor mice were euthanized with carbon dioxide and the femur was extracted. Donor BM-derived cells were isolated from the femur and passed through a 70 \u03bcm cell strainer. Total number of cells was determined with a BD Coulter Particle Count and Size Analyzer (Beckman Coulter). BM-derived cells (1 \u00d7 10\n6\n) were transferred to recipient mice by tail vein injection (100 \u03bcl) 48 h after the second dose of busulfan. Mice were left undisturbed for 4 weeks to allow engraftment. Engraftment was verified by determining the percentage of GFP+ cells in the BM and the blood. Mice that had <30% BM engraftment were excluded from the study (n=2).\n\nSpinal cord injury\nContusion of the spinal cord was perfomed as previously described (\nHansen et al., 2013\n). In brief, mice were anesthetized with a ketamine (138 mg/kg)-xylazine (20 mg/kg) cocktail and given prophylactic antibiotics (gentocin, 1mg/kg). Using aseptic techniques, removal of the spinous process and lamina of T9 exposed the dura. After stabilizing the vertebral column, the Infinite Horizon (IH) device delivered 75 kilodynes of force to induce a severe contusion injury. Biomechanics of the injury were screened on day 0, and outlier forces or displacements were excluded (n=2). Force and displacement trends were similar to those established by\nGhasemlou and colleagues (2005)\n(mean force: 78.66 \u00b1 0.57; mean displacement: 681.28 \u00b123.97). The incision was closed in layers and 2cc of sterile saline was given subcutaneously to prevent dehydration. Randomized group assignment occurred. During recovery, mice received antibiotics (1mg/kg gentocin, s.q.) and saline for 5 days and bladders were manually expressed twice per day (\nHoschouer et al., 2010\n).\n\nFlow cytometry on blood\nBlood was collected from the heart at perfusion (na\u00efve, 1, 7 dpi; n=16) and red blood cells were lysed. Blood leukocytes were washed and the Fc receptors were blocked with anti-CD16/CD32 antibody (eBioscience). Cells were incubated with the appropriate antibodies (CD11b, GR-1; eBioscience), and Ly6C (BD Biosciences) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Cells were washed and re-suspended in FACS buffer for analysis. Non-specific binding was assessed by using isotype-matched antibodies. Antigen expression was determined using a Becton-Dickinson FACSCaliber four-color cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star) and gating for each antibody was determined based on isotype stained controls.\n\nPurification of CD11b\n+\ncells from spinal cord\nEnriched CD11b\n+\ncells were isolated from the spinal cord (Na\u00efve, 1dpi; n=7) as previously described (\nDonnelly et al., 2011\n). In brief, the spinal cord was removed and the cervical, epicenter, and lumbar regions were dissected. Each segment was homogenized using a potter homogenizer and centrifuged to collect a cell pellet. Cells were then suspended in a discontinuous Percoll density gradient (70%/35%/0%) and centrifuged. Microglia and BM-derived CD11b\n+\ncells were collected at the 70%/35% Percoll interphase.\n\nFlow cytometry on spinal cord tissue\nPercoll enriched CD11b\n+\ncells were incubated with an Fc receptors block (anti-CD16/CD32) antibody followed with rat anti-mouse CD45-PerCP-Cy5.5 and CD11b-APC antibodies (eBioscience, CA). Expression of these surface receptors was determined using a Becton-Dickinson FACSCaliber four color Cytometer (BD, NJ). Microglia and BM- derived macrophages were identified by CD11b\n+\n/CD45\nlo\nand CD11b\n+\n/CD45\nhigh\nexpression, respectively (\nWohleb et al., 2011\n). Flow data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, CA).\n\nProtein isolation and quantification for ELISA\nSpinal cord segments were isolated from the lumbar enlargement (Na\u00efve, 1, 2, 3, 7 dpi; n=17) of na\u00efve and SCI mice. ELISA was run in replicate groups alongside na\u00efve controls (n=3-5/SCI groups, n=2-3 naives for each replicate group). Mice were perfused with sterile saline, and spinal cords were quickly dissected, snap frozen, and stored at -80\u00b0C. Segments from L4-5 were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer (Pierce) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, protein concentrations were determined by a BSA protein assay. Quantification of proteins was determined using a custom SearchLight Multiplex ELISA Array and performed by Aushon Biosystems (Billerica, MA, USA). Custom arrays were spotted with capture antibodies specific to Intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), Monocyte chemoattractant protein (CCL2), and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (CXCL12). The bound proteins were then detected with a biotinylated detection antibody, followed by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and visualized with SuperSignal ELISA Femto Chemiluminescent substrate. The luminescent signal produced from the HRP-catalyzed oxidation of the substrate was measured using the SearchLight Imaging System (Pierce) and protein concentrations extrapolated from a standard curve using ArrayVision (Pierce). All protein levels were analyzed relative to uninjured WT controls and are expressed throughout as percent na\u00efve.\n\nAssessment of vascular permeability\nTo measure vascular permeability, mice (n=25) were intraperitoneally injected with a 2% solution of evans blue dye (EBD) dissolved in normal saline (\nManaenko et al., 2011\n). The injectate circulated for 30 minutes before perfusion and fixation. After flushing with 100ml cold saline, mice were perfused with 100ml of 4% PFA. Tissue was collected and protected from light. To localize EBD fluorescence, we did not generate tissue homogenates. Instead, we compared proportional area of fluorescence after confocal imaging. Upon sectioning (20\u03bcm), albumin-bound evans blue leakage was detected using confocal microscopy (Olympus FluoView FV1000 at 633nm wavelength). From confocal images, we used digital image analysis of EBD fluorescence on representative sections from L1-L2, L3-L4, and L5-6. Thresholds for positive staining were performed by a blinded investigator, and images were then processed using densitometric scanning of threshold targets using ImageJ software. Proportional area is reported as the average percent area in positive threshold for all images. Comparisons were made from averages of the entire lumbar cord.\n\nHistology\nThe WT (n=17), GFP+ Chimera WT (n=16), EBD (n=25), and MMP9\nKO\n(n=6) mice were transcardially perfused with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.2) at naive (n=3-4/group), 24 h post SCI (n=3-4/group), and 7 dpi (n=3-4/group) timepoints. Spinal cord segments from the cervical cord, T9 lesion site and from spinal levels L1-L6 were post-fixed for 1h in 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed overnight in 0.2M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4) then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose before being embedded in M-1 Embedding Matrix (Thermoscientific) and frozen on dry ice (\nHansen et al., 2013\n;\nMa et al., 2001\n;\nMa et al., 2004\n). Cervical, epicenter and lumbar blocks were sectioned in their entirety at 20 \u03bcm on a Microm HM505E cryostat and collected in series of equally spaced sections.\nFluorescent immunohistochemistry was performed to identify microglia/macrophages and visualize vascular proteins in transverse spinal cord sections of lumbar segments. To examine microglia/macrophages, a 1:200 dilution was used for rabbit anti Iba-1 (Wako, 019-19741). The antibody was prepared in blocking solution containing 1% BSA, 0.1% FG, 3% NGS, 0.2% Tx-100 or 1% BSA, 0.1% FG, 10% NDS, 0.2% Tx-100 in PBS. Incubation of the primary antibody occurred overnight at 4\u00b0C. Two secondaries were used to visualize Iba-1 labeling: a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody at a 1:400 dilution (AlexaFluor 488; Molecular Probes, A21103) and a donkey anti-rabbit secondary at a 1:200 dilution (AlexaFluor 550; Abcam, ab96892). To identify vascular anatomy, we used a 1:500 dilution for a rat anti-mouse monoclonal antibody to Ly6C for 48 h at 4\u00b0C (ER-MP20; Abcam, ab15627). The antibody was prepared in blocking solution containing 1% BSA, 2% NGS in PBS. A goat anti-rat secondary antibody was used to visualize Ly6C antibody at a 1:500 dilution, incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C (A594; Abcam, ab6565). To identify ICAM-1 labeling, we used a 1:250 dilution of goat anti ICAM-1 (R&D Systems, AF796) with overnight incubation 4\u00b0C. The antibody was prepared in a blocking solution containing 1% BSA in PBS. A donkey anti-goat secondary (AlexaFluor 550; Abcam, ab150129) was used to visualize the ICAM-1 antibody at a 1:250 dilution, incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. To identify BM- derived cells in non-chimeric mice, we used a 1:500 concentration of rat anti-mouse CD45 antibody (Abcam, ab25603) diluted in a 1% BSA in PBS blocking solution. The primary antibody incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. We then used a 1:1000 dilution of donkey anti-rat secondary (AlexaFlour488; Abcam, ab150153) to visualize the CD45 antibody. To identify GAD67 labeling, we used a 1:200 dilution of mouse anti GAD67 (Millipore, MAB5406) in 3% Triton-X and 10% NGS overnight at 4\u00b0C. A goat anti-mouse secondary (AlexaFlour 594; Life Technologies, a11005) at 1:100 was used to visualize GAD67. For all staining, control sections were processed by eliminating the primary antibody and replacing with blocking solution to ensure positive labeling.\n\nImage Quantification\nSections were imaged using a Zeiss 510 Laser Confocal Microscope (The Ohio State University Confocal Microscopy Imaging Facility). Predefined anatomical maps were used to delineate dorsal (laminae 1, 2, 3, 4), intermediate (laminae 5, 6, 7), and ventral (laminae 8, 9) gray matter. Quantifications of GFP+ Iba-1+ co-labeling and cell morphology were performed in the same spinal cord sections by two raters blinded to group assignment. The blinded counts were averaged for comparison and had interrater r\n2\nvalues greater than 0.93. To quantify GAD67 labeling, digital image analysis of staining was performed on lumbar sections (\nDonnelly and Popovich, 2008\n). Thresholds for positive staining were determined by a blinded investigator then processed by densitometric scanning of threshold targets using ImageJ software. Proportional area is reported as the average percent area in the positive threshold for all pictures. To quantify infiltrating immune cells in non-chimeric mice, the number of CD45 positive cells were counted live by a single blinded rater using a Nikon Eclipse fluorescence microscope. All gray matter CD45\n+\ncells were quantified from four tissue sections per animal (n=5 to 7 per group).\n\nStatistics\nAll data was analyzed using ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc testing or a t-test when appropriate. Means and standard error of the mean (SEM) are reported throughout. Protein levels are displayed as percent of na\u00efve. Significance was set at\np\n<0.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nHdh\nQ111/+\nknock-in mice (Jax\u00ae, Bar Harbour, Maine, U.S.A.) were bred inhouse on a C57BL/6J background. 21 Hdh\nQ111/+\nanimals (11 female, 10 male) and 22 wild type animals (13 female, 9 male) were used. Animals were genotyped by Laragen Inc. (Culver City, California, USA), Hdh\nQ111/+\nanimals contained an average CAG repeat length of 141 (range 134\u2013149 repeats). Animals were split into three groups, containing both wildtype and Hdh\nQ111/+\nmice (\nTable 1\n), and kept in a temperature controlled environment (21\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C) on a 12:12\u00a0hour light/dark cycle (lights on 06.00\u201318.00). Animals had ad-libitum access to food, although a water restriction regime was imposed during behavioural testing. Experiments were conducted in accordance with the 2013 European Union Directive 2010/63/EU.\nTable 1.\nExperimental design of animal testing groups.\n*An Hdh\nQ111/+\nanimal in testing group 3 became ill at approximately 8\u00a0months of age and was therefore culled reducing the number of Hdh\nQ111/+\nanimals in the testing group to 7.

Operant apparatus\nOperant testing was conducted in 16 9-hole operant boxes, controlled by a BehaviourNet Controller BNC MkII operating system (Campden Instruments, Loughborough, UK). Each operant box (\nFig. 1\nA) was housed within a sound attenuating chamber, the rear wall was curved and contained a horizontal array of nine holes (11\u00a0mm diameter, placed 2\u00a0mm apart and 15\u00a0mm above floor level). Each hole contained a photocell infrared beam at the front to detect nose pokes. At the rear, a light emitting device (LED) provided the target visual stimulus. Only 5 of the 9 holes (termed A, B, C, D and E) were used in testing; black plastic film covers were inserted over unused holes. A peristaltic pump delivered strawberry milk (Yazoo\u00ae, Campina Ltd, Horsham, UK) to a magazine at the front of the box. Reward delivery was signalled by an LED above the magazine. Nose pokes into the magazine were detected via an infrared beam.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nA. Picture of the mouse operant boxes used in behavioural testing. B. Schematic representation of the operant box apparatus, the back response wall contained 9 stimulus lights, 5 of which were used in operant testing. Holes 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 contained stimulus lights and photocell detectors to detect nose pokes via breaking of an infrared beam, these correspond to holes A, B, C, D and E. Holes 2, 4, 6 and 8 were covered with well blanks. Each nose poke contained a stimulus light and an infrared beam to detect nose poke responses.\n\n2.3. Water restriction regime\nOne week prior to operant training all animals were gradually water restricted, to a final restriction of 3\u00a0h of access to water per day, and introduced to Yazoo\u00a9 strawberry milk reward, in their home cages. Animals received cognitive training 5\u00a0days per week and received daily access to water 4\u00a0h after operant training was completed. Ad-libitum access to water was given at weekends.\n\n2.4. Experimental design\nAll operant training commenced at 4\u00a0months of age (\nTable 1\n). The first testing group (Group 1) received 15\u00a0days of nose poke training, followed by 20\u00a0days of training in the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT). The second group (Group 2) received a comparable total number of days (35\u00a0days) of nose poke training; however, for the final 20\u00a0days an extended nose poke training regime was used, as detailed below. The third testing group (Group 3) were controls and received no exposure to, or training in, the operant boxes; however they were handled and water restricted in the same way as the other testing groups.\n\n2.5. Nose poke training\nAt 4\u00a0months of age, the animals in Groups 1 and 2 (\nTable 1\n) received 15\u00a0days of nose poke training. Training in responding into the magazine began with the delivery of 150\u00a0\u03bcl of strawberry milk into the magazine and illumination of the magazine light, after successful reward retrieval the magazine light was extinguished. The process was repeated for the 20\u00a0minute session time. Mice were then taught to poke on a simple fixed-ratio (FR1) schedule of reinforcement. The central hole in the array was illuminated and mice were required to respond to the stimulus by nose poking. A response to stimulus triggered the light to extinguish and the simultaneous illumination of the magazine light and delivery of 5\u00a0\u03bcl strawberry milkshake reward. The next trial was initiated with the illumination of the central light.\n\n2.6. 5 5-CSRTT operant training\nAfter 15\u00a0days of nose poke training, Group 1 mice (see Section\n2.5\nand\nTable 1\n) were trained on the 5-CSRTT. Animals were trained to respond to a randomly-presented stimulus light, in order to receive a reward. After a correct response, the light was extinguished, 5\u00a0\u03bcl of milkshake reward was delivered, and the magazine light illuminated. Upon withdrawal from the magazine, the magazine light was extinguished and the next trial initiated. If a response was not executed within the stimulus length time, or the subsequent 10\u00a0s after the presentation of the stimulus (termed a \u2018limited hold\u2019), the light was extinguished and a \u2018time-out\u2019 period of 10\u00a0s was initiated by illumination of the house light. The process was repeated for the 30\u00a0minute session time. For the first 10\u00a0days, a 10\u00a0s stimulus was presented. A 2\u00a0s stimulus was used for the next 5\u00a0days and a 0.5\u00a0s stimulus was used for the final 5\u00a0days of testing.\n\n2.7. Extended nose poke operant training\nIn addition to nose poke training, the animals in testing Group 2 received 20\u00a0days of extended nose poke training. The operant programme randomly selected a light stimulus which the animal was required to poke into, to obtain reward, for the duration of the 30\u00a0minute training session. The location of the response hole differed on subsequent days of training.\n\n2.8. Operant testing\nOperant testing was conducted in all groups at 12\u00a0months of age. All animals were gradually water restricted one week prior to operant testing and introduced to strawberry milkshake within their home cages. All animals were placed on the nose poke training programme, as described in\nSection 2.5\n. After the completion of training, animals were tested on the 5-CSRTT.\n\n2.9. Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry of free floating sections\nAnimals were culled via cervical dislocation, the brain was post fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24\u00a0h and transferred into 25% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline solution. Brains were frozen on a sledge-microtome (Leitz, Wetzlar), cut into 40\u00a0\u03bcm coronal sections, and collected in 12 parallel series. For immunohistochemistry, 1:12 series of sections were quenched for 5\u00a0min using 10% H\n2\nO\n2\n(VWR, West Sussex, UK) and methanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK). Sections were blocked in 3% serum in Triton-X and Tris-buffered saline (TxTBS) for 1\u00a0h and incubated in a solution of TxTBS, 1% serum and primary antibodies raised against either DARPP-32 (AB_2314285, Cornell University, 1:30,000 (\nOuimet et al., 1984\n), S830 (a gift from Gillian Bates King's College London, 1:25,000 (\nSathasivam et al., 2001\n) or Neu-N (Millipore (MAB 377), 1:2000 (\nMullen et al., 1992\n). Incubation in biotinylated-secondary antibody (1:200) was conducted for 2\u00a0h, then sections were incubated using an ABC kit (Vector Laboratories Ltd, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire) for 2\u00a0h.\nProteins were visualised using 3\u20133\u2032-diaminobenzadine (DAB), before mounting on to double-subbed 1% gelatinised slides (Thermo Scientific, Menzel Gl\u00e4ser). After dehydration and delipidisation in 100% xylene, slides were coverslipped using DPX mountant (Thermo Scientific, Raymond Lamb, Leicestershire, UK).\nFor cresyl violet staining a 1:12 series of sections were mounted onto slides and allowed to air dry before incubation for 5\u00a0min in: 70% IMS, 95% IMS, 100% IMS, 50/50 chloroform alcohol, 95% IMS, 70% IMS, distilled water, cresyl violet solution and distilled water. Sections were dehydrated in 70% and 95% IMS, then destained by agitation in acid alcohol solution and coverslipped using DPX mountant.\n\n2.10. Stereological analysis\nStereological quantification was conducted using Visiopharm Integrator System (VIS, version 4.4.6.9) software on an Olympus Canada Inc. Q-Imaging Microscope. For each slide, striatal sections were outlined under an \u00d7\u00a01.25 objective lens. Defined striatal areas were then sampled in a systematically automated fashion and cells were counted using oil under the \u00d7\u00a0100 objective lens. The counting frame size used was 285\u00a0\u03bcm\n2\n. An Abercrombie correction factor was then applied to the total number of cells counted.\n\n2.11. Statistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed in IBM SPSS Statistic 20 software for windows. Repeated measures ANOVA tests, including the measures Group, Genotype, Stimulus duration and Hole, followed by simple effects analysis were conducted. This enabled both the overall effects of cognitive training and the effects of cognitive training on specific genotypes to be established. For histological analyses, univariate ANOVA tests followed by simple effects analysis were performed. Where significance was found\npost-hoc\ntests with Bonferroni corrections were applied to identify the locus of effects and their interaction(s). The significance level used throughout was \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.05."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nAll experiments were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the University of California, Riverside Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Animals were housed under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle with food and water provided\nad libitum\n. 7 to 8-week-old CD1 male mice from Charles River were used for these experiments.\n\n2.2. Surgery\nWe used intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) injections to induce epileptogenesis (\nArabadzisz et al., 2005\n;\nBouilleret et al., 1999\n;\nRiban et al., 2002\n). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a mixture of 80 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine and mounted in a stereotaxic frame. An incision was made to expose the skull and bregma was located. Using stereotaxic coordinates of the hippocampus (\nPaxinos and Franklin, 2001\n), a 0.6 mm burr hole was made 1.8 mm posterior and 1.6 mm lateral from bregma with a high-speed drill (Drummond Scientific). Mice were injected with either 74 nL of a 20 mM solution of kainic acid or an equal volume of 0.9% saline over a period of 4 min using a microinjector (Nanoject, Drummond Scientific) into the right dorsal hippocampus (dorsoventral coordinate 1.9 mm).\n\n2.3. Kainic acid status epilepticus\nAfter kainic acid injections, all mice experienced status epilepticus (SE), defined by Racine scale stage 3\u20135 seizures (\nRacine, 1972\n) continuously for a period of 3 or more hours. In preliminary studies, we verified the presence of epileptiform activity in 100% of animals after IHKA injections by video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring (\nLee et al., 2012b\n) (\nSupplemental Fig. S1\nin the online version at\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.expneurol.2016.05.003\n.). Within 30 min of IHKA injections, mice experienced SE for several hours, which spontaneously subsided. In this model, mice exhibit spontaneous recurrent seizures in both hippocampi (\nSupplemental Fig. S1\nin the online version at\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.expneurol.2016.05.003\n.). Previous studies in the IHKA model (\nArabadzisz et al., 2005\n;\nBouilleret et al., 1999\n;\nRiban et al., 2002\n) demonstrated that the model reproduced morphological characteristics of mesial temporal sclerosis, including neuronal loss, gliosis, mossy fiber sprouting, and dentate granule cell dispersion. We have previously confirmed the pattern of neuronal loss in CA1 and progressive dentate granule cell dispersion as well as performed chronic video-EEG recording in this model (\nLee et al., 2012b\n) (\nSupplemental Fig. S1\nin the online version at\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.expneurol.2016.05.003\n.).\nFor the current studies, we wished to avoid electrode damage to the brain and therefore proceeded without the use of EEG implantation. Instead, we monitored animals for behavioral seizures. All animals experienced continuous (3 or more hours) Racine stage 3\u20135 seizures (\nRacine, 1972\n), characterized by forelimb and hindlimb clonus, rearing, and falling. Animals that died due to SE were excluded from the study. Otherwise, at each time point\nn\n= 5 animals were euthanized with fatal plus (Western Medical Supply), perfused, and processed for each experiment, unless otherwise specified.\n\n2.4. Immunohistochemistry\nMice were perfused transcardially with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4. Brains were quickly removed and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 \u00b0C followed by two days of cryoprotection in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C. Brains were then cut into 50 \u03bcm coronal sections using a cryostat (Leica CM 1950, Leica Microsytems, Bannockburn, IL) and stored in PBS at 4 \u00b0C. All slices were processed simultaneously. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating slices in 3% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by a 1 h blocking step with 5% normal goat serum in 0.1 M PBS. Slices were then incubated with primary antibody to GLT1 (1:3000, AbCam AB41621) and GFAP (1:200, Millipore MAB360) in 0.3% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After washing slices with PBS, sections were incubated with species-specific secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 or 594 and a tyramide signaling amplification (TSA) kit (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) for visualization. Slices were mounted in Vectorshield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and 10\u00d7 images were taken using a fluorescence microscope (Leica DFC345 FX). Confocal 40\u00d7 images were taken on the Leica SP5 inverted microscope.\nQuantification was performed using the Leica Application Suite (LAS) X Lite software. Fluorescent images of the hippocampus were captured at 10\u00d7 magnification under identical settings. A box delineating the region of interest (ROI) was drawn on the DAPI channel either around all layers of the hippocampus or at the center of each layer of the hippocampus: stratum (S.) oriens, S. pyramidale, S. radiatum, S. lacunosum moleculare (SLM), molecular layer, granule cell layer (GCL), and hilus (\nSupplemental Fig. S2B\nin the online version at\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.expneurol.2016.05.003\n.). In the CA3 region of the hippocampus, ROIs around the S. lucidum, S. pyramidale, and S. oriens were drawn (\nSupplemental Fig. S2B\nin the online version at\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.expneurol.2016.05.003\n.). The mean pixel (gray) value within each ROI was obtained for analysis. For each time point, 4 slices from each animal (\nn\n= 5) were used.\n\n2.5. Western blot analysis\nDorsal hippocampus was microdissected from the mouse brain at 1, 4, 7, and 30 days post intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) or saline injection (\nn\n= 7 for 7 days post SE;\nn\n= 5 for saline control and all other time points). Harvested tissue was homogenized using the Bullet Blender bead homogenizer (Next Advance) in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5 sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5) containing complete protease inhibitors (Roche). Protein concentrations were assayed and protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE, 10% polyacrylamide, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were then probed for either AQP4 (1:1000, Millipore ABN411) or GLT1 (1:5000 of a C-terminal polyclonal antibody (\nRothstein et al., 1994\n)) and \u03b2-actin (1:10,000, Sigma A1978) as an internal control. Whole hippocampal tissue was microdissected, processed, and probed for GFAP (1:5000, Millipore AB5804), AQP4 (1:1000, Millipore ABN411), or GLT1 (1:10,000, AbCam AB41621; also confirmed with 1:5000 of the C-terminal polyclonal antibody (\nRothstein et al., 1994\n)) while again using \u03b2-actin (1:10,000, Sigma A1978) as an internal control. Bands were visualized and quantified using the Li-COR Odyssey Fc Western Imaging System and protein levels of AQP4, GLT1 and GFAP were normalized to internal \u03b2-actin levels. The upper (tetrameric) band for AQP4 is shown, was determined to be specific (\nSupplemental Fig. S3\nin the online version at\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.expneurol.2016.05.003\n.), and therefore was used for quantification. For GLT1, both the lower and upper bands are shown but only quantification of the lower band was included for simplicity. Similar results, however, were observed when quantifying the upper band.\n\n2.6. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis\nWhole or dorsal hippocampus was microdissected from the mouse brain at 1, 4, 7, and 30 days post intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) or saline injection. Harvested tissue was homogenized using the Bullet Blender bead homogenizer (Next Advance). RNA was isolated using the Direct-Zol RNA mini prep kit (Zymo Research) and quantified using a nanodrop (Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 2000c Spectrophotometer). Both cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR were performed using the Bioline SensiFAST SYBR NO-ROX Kit and the CFX-96 detection system (Bio-Rad). Primers for AQP4, GLT1, GFAP and 18s RNA (\nTable 1\n) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. The reaction conditions were as follows: 1 cycle for 10 min at 45 \u00b0C, 1 cycle for 2 min at 95 \u00b0C, 40 cycles for 5 s at 95 \u00b0C, and 1 cycle for 20 s at 60 \u00b0C. Results were quantified using the differential CT method representing the fold change in target gene expression. Both a no template control (NTC) and a no reverse transcriptase (NRT) control were included in each assay to detect any contamination or non-specific replication.\nTable 1.\nPrimers used for RT-PCR experiments.

    "Methods": "Ethical Approval\nAll procedures involving rats were approved by the Wright State IACUC committee and followed the NIH guide for care and use of laboratory animals.\n\nInduction of sepsis\nWe used the cecal ligation and puncture procedure to induce sepsis in rats, which we used previously (\nNardelli, et al., 2013\n,\nNovak, et al., 2009\n). Briefly, rats were anesthetized for survival surgery with inhaled isoflurane (1-3 % mixed in 100% O\n2\n) and the anterior abdomen was shaved, cleaned and incised. The cecum was ligated half way between its tip and the ileum, and punctured with an 18 gauge needle. For continuous relief of pain an Alzet 2 mL osmotic pump (Durect, Cupertino CA) that delivered 30 ug/kg/hr of oxymorphine was inserted into the abdomen prior to closing the incision. At the end of surgery rats were given a single dose of buprenorphine (.12 mg/kg) subcutaneously for pain relief until the oxymorphine took effect. All rats were given 5 mls of subcutaneous 0.9% sodium chloride 24 hours after surgery. If rats appeared lethargic on postoperative days 2, 3 and 4, they were given daily additional injections of 5 mls of saline. If rats were so lethargic that they had little response to handling they were also given 10 mg/kg subcutaneous Baytril every 12 hours until they began to improve behaviorally (usually by 24 hours).\n\nTerminal recordings\nRats were anesthetized in terminal experiments by inhalation of isoflurane (1.2-1.5% mixed in 100% O\n2\n) and fixed in a rigid recording frame. In all experiments, the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle in the left hindlimb was partially dissected from surrounding tissue and attached through its cut tendon of insertion to a transducer for measuring force in isometric contractions (Aurora Scientific Inc, 205B-LR, Spike2 Cambridge Electronic Design (CED)). Fine-wire electrodes were inserted into the belly of the MG muscle for recording EMG. With all muscle nerves crushed except the MG nerve, the tibial nerve was placed on a bipolar silver wire stimulating electrode. In experiments in which intracellular recording and stimulation of motor neurons was performed, dorsal laminectomy of L3-L6 was also performed.\nPeripheral motor function: The efficacy of peripheral motor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and extrafusal muscle fibers in supporting muscle force generation was examined by direct electrical stimulation of the MG nerve or muscle. The MG muscle was fixed at optimal length for maximal isometric twitch force evoked by brief current pulses (0.04 ms) delivered to the tibial nerve. Whole-muscle isometric force was evoked by nerve stimulation to determine the force-frequency relation. Whole muscle force was also studied in response to electrical stimulation applied directly to the muscle through silver ball electrodes.\nCentral excitability of motor neurons: Defects in central excitability were tested by examining the action potentials fired by alpha motor neurons in response to suprathreshold current injected intracellularly through a micropipette (2 M K-acetate, 5-10 M\u03a9). In a subset of experiments, motor unit force was recorded simultaneously with recording of intracellular action potentials.\n\nStatistical Analysis of Data\nThe effect of sepsis in rats was identified by statistical comparison of treated vs. control groups. Data sampled from rats in each group was pooled and tested for group differences using nested ANOVA, which identified the effect of sepsis as well as its dependence on individual rats. For analysis of standard deviation of firing rate, a repeated measure ANOVA was used to compare data from motor neurons from septic rats to controls at each level of current injection."

    "Methods": "2.1. Regulated procedures\nAll animal experiments were performed in full compliance with local ethical guidelines and approved animal care according to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and its subsequent amendments. Human fetal tissue was collected in accordance with the Polkinghorne and Department of Health guidelines and with full ethical committee approval as part of the\nSouth Wales Initiative for Transplantation\n(SWIFT) program (\nKelly et al., 2011\n).\n\n2.2. Collection of mouse WGE\nMouse WGE was dissected from CD1 pregnant mice (through in-house breeding). Mated females were checked daily for a vaginal plug. The day of plug discovery was recorded as embryonic day (E)0. Embryonic rodent tissue was dissected according to\nDunnett et al. (1992)\n. For microarray and qPCR analysis, tissue was collected at E12, E14 and E16. WGE tissue was dissected and embryos from each litter were pooled with 3\u00a0litters of each gestational age collected. The accuracy of dissection was demonstrated by comparing the expression of Gsx2 (predominantly striatal marker) and Pax6 (predominantly cortical mantle marker) in the presumed WGE and adjacent cortical tissues, and demonstrated successful identification of WGE (unpublished data). For neural transplantation of wild type mouse allografts, CD1 embryos were taken at E14, dissected WGEs were pooled and aliquots of cells were transplanted as below.\nFor collection of mouse FoxP1 knock-out WGE, time mates were set up between two FoxP1 heterozygote knock-out (FoxP1\n+/\u2212\n) mice (\nWang et al., 2004\n) maintained on a C57BL/6 background. Embryos were taken at E14, and individual WGE were dissected and collected separately from each embryo. WGE from each embryo were processed individually and a sample of tail was retained for genotyping.\n\n2.3. Collection of human fetal CNS tissue\nHuman fetal tissue ranging in age from 8 to 12\u00a0weeks post conception (which corresponds to crown rump length of 22\u201354\u00a0mm) was collected according to\nKelly et al. (2011)\n. Striatal primordia were dissected in 0.9% saline solution with addition of 0.6% glucose (Hospital pharmacy), transferred to Hibernate E (Invitrogen) for overnight storage at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and processed the following day.\n\n2.4. Gene array process and analysis\nRNA extraction was undertaken using TRIzol and RNeasy mini columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nIn vitro\ntranscription of each RNA sample to antisense biotinylated RNA was carried out using the BioArray HighYield RNA Transcript Labelling Kit (Enzo Life Science). Labelled cRNA (15\u00a0\u03bcg) was hybridised to the Mouse430A Affymetrix GeneChip Array for 16\u00a0h at 45\u00a0\u00b0C, GeneChips were washed in an Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 400 and scanned with an Agilent GeneArray Scanner. The data were analysed in the R/Bioconductor environment. Quality control analysis was performed on the arrays (using the \u201cSimpleaffy\u201d package (\nhttp://bioinformatics.picr.man.ac.uk/simpleaffy/\n)). The array data were normalized using both the MAS5 and RMA algorithms. For each list, ANOVA tests were performed. The Tukey-Kramer\npost-hoc\ntest was used to determine any significantly differentially expressed genes at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. The lists of significantly differentially expressed genes were then analysed for specific patterns of gene enrichment using the GSA package (\nhttp://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/GSA/\n), using gene ontology (GO) probeset annotations that were obtained from the molecular signatures database (\nhttp://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp\n). All microarray raw data can be found online at GEO (\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=ovepqugwtlmftuj&acc=GSE55497\n) (\nGSE55497\n).\n\n2.5. Quantitative RT PCR (qPCR)\ncDNAs were generated from the same RNA samples used above using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and qPCR was performed using SYBR green (Finnzymes) and an Opticon Monitor 2 system. qPCR conditions were 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, followed by 41\u00a0cycles of 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 30s and 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s. Each qPCR was performed in triplicate, and relative quantification against Gapdh was determined according to the \u0394\u0394C(t) method (\nLivak and Schmittgen, 2001\n). For analysis of data, the software Opticon Monitor 3 was used (Biorad) and statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 16.0. Primer sequences were as follows: mouse FoxP1 CAGCCACCCTCTCTATGGAC and AGCGCATGCTCACTGTTG; and human FoxP1 GCAGTTACAGCAGCAGCACCTCC and CAGCCTGGCCACTTGCATACACC.\n\n2.6.\nIn situ\nhybridisation (ISH)\nFrozen heads of CD1 mice (E12, E14, E16, postnatal day (P)0, P7 and adult) or human fetal brains (8\u201312\u00a0weeks post conception, crown rump length range 22\u201354\u00a0mm) were sectioned at 30\u00a0\u03bcm using a cryostat, mounted onto Superfrost charged slides and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer. Sections were treated and hybridised overnight with DIG-labelled riboprobes at 58\u00a0\u00b0C. Following overnight hybridisation, the slides were washed then blocked for 1\u00a0h. After blocking, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (1:1500; Roche Applied Sciences) was applied for 1\u00a0h followed by washing and then developing with NBT/BCIP (Roche) in alkaline phosphatase buffer. All slides were visualised using Wild Heerbrugg Makroskop M420 microscope and MagnaFire 2.1C software.\nRiboprobes for FoxP1 were generated from cDNA sequences of extracted RNA (forward mouse primer: ATGCTGGAAAACAGCCGAAA, reverse mouse primer: GTGCTCCTCGTGGGACAAG; and forward human primer: GCAGTTACAGCAGCAGCACCTCC, reverse human primer: CAGCCTGGCCACTTGCATACACC), which were inserted into the cloning vector pCRIItopo (Invitrogen). The site of insertion is flanked by RNA polymerase initiation sites; SP6 and T7 thus allowing for sense and antisense strands to be synthesised. All probes were labelled with DIG (Roche). No staining was seen in any of the sections exposed to the sense probe.\n\n2.7.\nIn vitro\ndifferentiation\nFor mouse tissue, dissected WGE pieces (from E14 embryos) were transferred to 0.1% trypsin (Worthington, New Jersey, USA) and 0.5% DNAse (Sigma, Dorset, UK) in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) for 20\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Trypsin inhibitor 0.01% (Sigma) and DNAse 0.05% were added and the tissue was incubated for a further 5\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Tissue was then washed in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen), centrifuged at 1000\u00a0rpm for 3\u00a0min and the remaining pellet was resuspended in 200\u00a0\u03bcL DMEM/F-12 and triturated 10\u201315 times with a 200\u00a0\u03bcL Gilson pipette to generate a single-cell suspension. Cells were counted using a haemocytometer and trypan blue (Sigma) exclusion was used to assess cell viability.\nFor human tissue, dissected striatal pieces were incubated in equal volumes of TrypLE express (Invitrogen) and Benzonase (1:10,000) (Merck, UK) for 20\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Tissue was then washed in saline-glucose solution, centrifuged at 1000\u00a0rpm for 3\u00a0min and the remaining pellet was resuspended in 200\u00a0\u03bcL DMEM/F-12 and triturated 10\u201315 times with a 200\u00a0\u03bcL Gilson pipette to generate a single-cell suspension. Cells were counted and viability assessed (as above).\nFor\nin vitro\ndifferentiation of both mouse and human cells, dissociated cells were plated onto 13\u00a0mm glass coverslips coated with poly-\nl\n-lysine at a density of 50,000 cells per well in a 30\u00a0\u03bcL drop of differentiation medium (DMEM/F-12, 1% PS, 2% B-27 (Invitrogen) plus 1% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen)) and were allowed to adhere for 2\u20133\u00a0h before the wells were flooded with a further 500\u00a0\u03bcL differentiation medium. Cultures were maintained at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in humidified 5% CO\n2\nand 95% atmospheric air, and differentiation medium was replaced with fresh medium every 2\u20133\u00a0days. Cultures were allowed to differentiate for 7 or 14\u00a0days. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20\u00a0min.\n\n2.8. Immunohistochemical analysis of\nin vitro\ndifferentiated cells\nFluorescent immunocytochemistry followed standard protocols with primary antibodies for rabbit anti-FoxP1 (1:500; Abcam), mouse anti-FoxP1 (JC12) (1:500; Abcam), mouse anti-\u03b2-III-tubulin (1:1000; Sigma), mouse anti-Map2ab (1:500; Sigma), mouse anti-DARPP-32 (1:20,000; a gift from Prof H. Hemmings), mouse anti-GFAP (1:500; Abcam), rabbit anti-GAD65/67 (1:2000; Millipore), rabbit anti-met-enkephalin (1:15,000; Millipore), rat anti-CTIP2 (1:500, Abcam) and rat anti-BrdU (1:200, Oxford Bio). For double labelling, the two primary antibodies that had been raised in different species were added at the same time. Appropriate fluorescent-labelled secondary antibodies (Life technologies) were applied, followed by the nuclear stain Hoechst. Fluorescent staining was visualised using a Leica DRMBE microscope at 560\u00a0nm (red), 494\u00a0nm (green) and 346\u00a0nm (blue). Cell counts were undertaken at 40\u00a0\u00d7 magnification using a counting grid. For unbiased sampling, 5 fields were chosen at random from which to take counts. Pseudocolour fluorescent images were obtained using Openlab 2.1 image analysis software and colour images were processed using Adobe Photoshop.\n\n2.9. Immunohistochemical analysis of whole brain sections\nSections were processed for immunohistochemistry using the free-floating, biotin-streptavidin-horseradish peroxidise method with primary antibodies for anti-FoxP1 (as above), mouse anti-DARPP-32 (as above except at 1:10,000), mouse anti-NeuN (1:4000; Chemicon), mouse anti-parvalbumin (1:4000; Sigma), mouse anti-Nkx2.1 (TTF1; 1:500; DAKO) and rat anti-CTIP2 (as above). Stained sections were visualised using a Leica DRMBE microscope and images were obtained using Openlab 2.1 image analysis software. Anatomical areas were identified using the Interactive Atlas Viewer of the Allen Brain Atlas Website: 2015 Allen Institute for Brain Science. Allen Mouse Brain Atlas [Internet]. Available from:\nhttp://mouse.brain-map.org\nand Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas [Internet]. Available from:\nhttp://developingmouse.brain-map.org\n.\n\n2.10. Quinolinic acid striatal lesions and neural transplantation\nQuinolinic acid is a relatively selective MSN toxin, sparing most of the interneuron populations (\nSchwarcz and Kohler, 1983\n,\nSchwarcz et al., 1983\n,\nBeal et al., 1986\n). Animals (CD1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats) received unilateral injection of 45\u00a0nmol quinolinic acid into the right striatum, and transplantation was carried out at 10\u201314\u00a0days post-quinolinic acid lesion as per\nKelly et al. (2007)\n. For mouse E14 WGE transplants into the host adult mouse lesioned striatum, 250,000 cells were resuspended in 2\u00a0\u03bcL and stereotactically injected over 2\u00a0min. For human WGE transplants into the host adult rat lesioned striatum, 500,000 cells were resuspended in 2\u00a0\u03bcL and stereotactically injected over 2\u00a0min.\nAnimals were housed in a natural light-dark cycle with access to food and water\nad libitum\n. All surgery was performed under isofluorane anaesthesia and post-surgery animals were recovered in a warmed recovery chamber and received analgesia by Metacam (Boehringer Ingelheim). All animals were perfused transcardially and fixed using 1.5% paraformaldehyde solution before the brains were removed, post-fixed overnight and transferred to 25% sucrose for cryoprotection. Brains were sectioned at 40\u00a0\u03bcm on a freezing-stage microtome and sections were stored for subsequent histological analysis.\n\n2.11. Statistics\nAll data were analysed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey-Wallis\npost-hoc\ntest and Student's\nt\n-test with significance set at 0.05."

    "Methods": "Adult (7\u20138 weeks) male Sprague Dawley rats ((Harlan) SD; n = 39) were used in this study. All rats were housed in the Biomedical Research Center, allowed access to low salt chow (Dyets 0.4% NaCl) and water ad libitum, and maintained on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle. All experimental protocols were approved by the Medical College of Wisconsin Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee prior to commencing the study.\n\n2.1. Experimental design\nAll rats were chronically instrumented with indwelling femoral artery and vein catheters as previously described (\nMouradian et al., 2012\n). Three or more days later, ventilation was measured and arterial blood was sampled while breathing room air (RA; F\nI\nO\n2\n= 0.21, bal. N\n2\n) for 20 min or hypoxic gas (F\nI\nO\n2\n= 0.12, bal. N\n2\n) in a 10 L flow-through, whole body plethysmograph. Arterial blood was sampled (0.4 mL) during the last 3 min of RA or hypoxia. In additional studies, ventilatory responses to venous injections of NaCN (3 mg mL\n\u22121\n) or saline (0.9% NaCl) were also measured in RA as previously described (\nMouradian et al., 2012\n). Rats then underwent sham or CBD surgery and breathing studies were repeated at regular intervals thereafter (1\u20132, 4\u20135, 9\u201310, and 14\u201315 days post-surgery). Hypoxic and NaCN ventilatory responses and corresponding blood gases were measured pre- and 1 or 2 days post-surgery. RA ventilation and blood gases were measured at each of the indicated intervals. A total of four groups of rats were used. The first group of rats was denervated and euthanized 1\u20132 days post-CBD (\u201cCBD Acute\u201d) and a second group of rats was denervated and euthanized 14\u201315 days post-CBD (\u201cCBD Chronic\u201d). Each denervation group had a corresponding time control, sham-denervated group of rats (\u201cSham Acute\u201d and \u201cSham Chronic\u201d). This study design permitted subsequent gene and biological function comparisons associated with peak hypoventilation (CBD Acute vs Sham Acute), the recovery process (CBD Acute vs CBD Chronic), and significant recovery of ventilation (CBD Chronic vs Sham Chronic) while controlling for time and surgery (Sham Acute vs Sham Chronic;\nFig. 1\n).\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nStudy design showing the four raphe transcriptome comparisons employed to identify gene expression changes and biological functions associated with peak hypoventilation (#1, Acute CBD vs Sham Acute), the recovery process (#2, CBD Acute vs CBD Chronic), and significant recovery of ventilation (#3, CBD Chronic vs Sham Chronic) while controlling for time and surgery (#4, Sham Acute vs Sham Chronic).\n\n2.2. Surgical protocols\nAll catheterization, sham, and CBD surgeries were carried out using aseptic technique as previously described (\nMouradian et al., 2012\n). Rats received intraoperative injections of Carprofen (Rimadyl; 5 mg kg\n\u22121\ni.p.) for analgesia and enrofloxacin (Baytril; 1 mg (100 g)\n\u22121\n) to prevent infection. Additional Carprofen was given BID for 48 h, and Baytril (1 mg/100 mL) supplied in the drinking water continuously after surgery.\n\n2.3. Tissue collection and mRNA sequencing\nUpon completion of physiological protocols, the rats were deeply anesthetized (20% isoflurane in propylene glycol) and upon respiratory arrest the brain extracted, embedded with embedding media and flash frozen and stored (\u221280 \u00b0C) until being placed into a chilled stainless steel matrix for ~1 mm serial sectioning (\nPuissant et al., 2015\n). Frozen tissue punches (~0.85 mm in diameter) were collected from the ventral midline from 2 serial sections beginning with the one containing Obex as previously described (\nPuissant et al., 2015\n), and stored in Eppendorf tubes (\u221280 \u00b0C) until RNA extraction.\nTotal RNA was extracted using standard Trizol-chloroform procedures, and was qualified and quantified (Pico or Nano Assay, Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer). 32 of 36 samples had an RNA integrity number (RIN) of 7.5 or greater indicative of high integrity/quality of RNA. 4 samples had RIN values between 6 and 7.3. Total RNA samples were processed and made into cDNA libraries per manufacturer instruction (Illumina) for mRNA sequencing (HiSeq 2000) as described previously. Sequence data were aligned to the rat reference genome for identification and quantification of transcripts, and differential expression determined using an in-house pipeline described previously (\nPuissant et al., 2015\n;\nLiu et al., 2014\n).\n\n2.4. Statistical analyses\nStatistical significance of differential expression of transcripts was first set to a q value of 0.05 (a 0.05 q value represents a\nP\nvalue normalized for multiple comparisons and indicates a 5% false discovery rate), and later relaxed to a q value of 0.10 (equates to an un-normalized\nP\nvalue of 0.001) to provide more insight into represented biological functions of differentially expressed genes. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used for its \u201ccore analysis\u201d and \u201ccore comparison analysis\u201d bioinformatics tools to gain insight into the biological functions represented by the differentially expressed genes (based on a q value of 0.10) and then to identify which biological functions were more or less represented during each phase after CBD (peak hypoventilation, recovering, recovered, over time). Core analyses yielded lists of biological functions predicted to be activated or de-activated based on a predicted activation Z-score (calculated based on number and direction of expression of genes known or associated with each function).\nTwo way repeated measure ANOVAs using GraphPad Prism v6.05 were used to assess statistical significance (\nP\n< 0.05) of resting blood gases and ventilatory measurements between pre- and post-surgery across all 4 groups of rats. Average values and SEM are expressed when applicable."

    "Methods": "From over 2,500 citations identified from an initial PubMed search performed in October of 2015 using the search terms \u201cspinal cord injury and transplantation\u201d in conjunction with \u201cSchwann cells\u201d, \u201cstem cells\u201d, or \u201cmyelinating cells\u201d, we further narrowed relevant studies by eliminating those studies that utilized human cells or grafted rodent cells into non-contusion/compression injuries. Those studies that met thisinitialinclusion criteria were formatted intoTable 1(for CNS-derived cells) orTable 3(for Schwann cells) describing the experiment\u2019s injury model, cell type(s) transplanted, additional genetic or pharmacological manipulation, reported behavior, myelin sparing, and additional reported tissue sparing. To obtain a non-biased set of publications to analyze for their potential support of translational application, we restricted our analysis to those that: 1) claimed functional recovery, and 2) were properly controlled. Thelattercriteria required that a cellular graft control was included in the analysis, as non-neural tissue grafts can enhance host reparative responses (Toft et al., 2013). Culture medium was not allowed as an acceptable control. Those studies that passed those two criteria were then statistically evaluated for appropriate power and proper use of statistical analyses (Burke et al., 2013). Briefly, a study was determined to contain inadequate or inappropriate data analysis when a high number (> 25%) of Student\u2019s t-tests were applied without correction, resulting in a high probability of Type I errors occurring (i.e., falsely rejecting the Null hypothesis and stating a significant effect). Taking into account each study\u2019s experimental design and the specific outcome measures upon which conclusions were based, sample sizes of 4 or less in the experimental group were considered as likely too low to illustrate sufficient power to confidently replicate the results, although it should be emphasized that given the modest behavioral effects observed, even this sample size criteria is generous. This last group of manuscripts was then evaluated for evidence of increased exogenous or endogenous/spared white matter myelin.\n\nTable 1.\nAll Studies Using CNS-Derived Myelinating Cells That Met

    "Methods": "Animals\nThe APP/TTA mice were previously described (\nJankowsky et al., 2005\n). Bigenic mice of both sexes were used for analysis. Single transgenic CaMKII\u03b1-TTA (TTA) and non-transgenic (NTG) littermates were used as controls. All experiments were performed in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. A minimum of 3 animals per genotype was used at each time point.\n\nImmunostaining\nMice were killed by isoflurane overdose followed by cervical dislocation. Upon decapitation, brains were quickly removed and fixed in ice cold 4% PFA (pH 7.2, 1hr) followed by 30% sucrose (0.1M phosphate buffer (PB)) immersion for 2 days. Fixed brains were then frozen in OCT medium and sectioned into 35\u03bcm thick coronal sections. Sections were then stored in antifreeze buffer (glycerol, ethylene glycol, 0.1M PB) until used for immunostaining. For immunostaining, sections were washed in 0.1M PB and blocked in 0.1M PB with 0.3% Triton X-100 detergent and 5% goat serum. Sections were incubated in primary antibodies overnight. The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti- \u03b2IV spectrin (\nYang et al., 2004\n), mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN (Millipore), mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP (neuromab, clone N206A/8), and rabbit polyclonal anti-Iba1 (Abcam). Primary antibodies were then labeled using AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). To detect nuclei, sections were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate (Invitrogen). Amyloid plaques were detected by counterstaining with thioflavin-S (Sigma) or by amyloid plaque autofluorescence. Sections were visualized with a Zeiss Imager.Z1 fluorescent microscope with an Apotome attachment.\n\nImage analysis\n40x z-stacks were captured in the superficial layer of the cortex (approximately layers 2-4) in three regions of the mouse cortex: M1, S1, or V1. Images were captured using structured illumination (Zeiss). In AD brains, three concentric circles (regions of interest, ROI) of 50, 100, and 150 \u03bcm diameter were placed over individual plaques of equivalent dimensions (\nFigs. 1D and E\n). AIS number and length, and the number of nuclei or microglia were counted within each annulus and within the inner circle. Similar measurements were made in corresponding regions of cortex from TTA and NTG mice. All measurements were performed using ImageJ (NIH). AIS were defined as \u03b2IV spectrin-labeled segments greater than 10 \u03bcm in length. For all quantifications we imaged 3 plaques (or equivalent control regions) per mouse, with 3 mice of each genotype at each age; we pooled data from the three regions of the cortex. If an AIS crossed two ROIs it was included in the outermost ROI. Measurements were compared in Prism using two-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni multiple comparisons post test."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nExperiments began with 3\u20134 months old, male Sprague-Dawley rats (310\u2013400 g, colony 211, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN). Rats were individually housed in a controlled environment (12-h light/dark cycle). The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Wisconsin approved all procedures.\n\n2.2. Experimental preparation\n2.2.1. Surgical preparation\nTelemetry implantation and C2 cervical hemisection were performed under sterile conditions as described previously (\nNavarrete-Opazo et al., 2014\n,\n2015\n). Rats were pre-medicated with subcutaneous buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg), carprofen (Rimadyl, 5 mg/kg) and enrofloxacin (Baytril, 4 mg/kg); additional injections were made every 12 h for 2 days post-surgery to minimize post-operative pain and infection. Body temperature was maintained between 36.5 and 37.5 \u00b0C. After tracheal intubation, rats were artificially ventilated (Rodent Ventilator, model 683; Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA) with 1.5\u20132.5% isoflurane in 100% O\n2\n. Effective anesthesia was judged by abolition of pedal withdrawal and corneal blink reflexes. Oxygen saturation during surgery was monitored via pulse oximetry (Nonin Medical Inc. Plymouth, MN).\n2.2.2. Telemetry transmitter implantation\nA sterilized telemeter (model 4ET-S1/2; Data Sciences International [DSI], St. Paul, MN) was inserted into the peritoneal cavity. Briefly, both hemi-diaphragms were exposed via midline incision. Electrode leads were implanted into the right and left T\n2\nEIC muscles ~1.0 cm from the sternum. Diaphragm and T\n2\nEIC leads were implanted using a 23- G syringe needle guide and tissue adhesive (Vetbond 1469SB; 3M Animal care product, St. Paul, MN).\n2.2.3. Cervical C2 hemisection\nOne week post-telemetry implantation, C2 hemisections (C2HS) were performed as described previously (\nDougherty et al., 2012b\n;\nFuller et al., 2009\n;\nVinit et al., 2009\n). The C2 spinal cord was exposed via dorsal laminectomy, and the duramater cut to enable left C2HS via microscalpel and aspiration. Sham rats underwent cervical laminectomy without spinal injury.\n2.2.4. Whole-body plethysmography\nUnanesthetized rats were placed individually in a 4 L whole body plethysmograph (4 L/min flow; model 600-1211-001; DSI, St. Paul, MN) positioned on a telemetry receiver to enable simultaneous EMG recordings. Tidal volume (V\nT\n) and respiratory frequency were analyzed in 1 min bins during baseline, normoxia (20 min) and maximum chemoreceptor stimulation (MCS: 10.5% O\n2\nand 7% CO\n2\n, 20 min). Intraperitoneal temperature was monitored with the telemetry system and used to calculate V\nT\nand compensate for changes in body temperature that may introduce calibration errors when ventilation is measured via whole body plethysmography (\nStephenson and Gucciardi, 2002\n).\n2.2.5. EMG telemetry\nDaily AIH exposures occurred in Plexiglas chambers positioned on telemetry receivers (model RPC-2; DSI, St. Paul, MN). Signals from the implanted telemeter were detected by the receivers and sent to a data exchange matrix (model ACQ-7700; DSI, St Paul, MN). Four EMG channels, body temperature and locomotor activity were monitored during the protocol (PONEMAH Physiology Platform; DSI, St. Paul, MN). EMG signals were sampled at 1200 Hz, and analyzed with Neuroscore software (DSI, St. Paul, MN).\n2.2.6. Drug preparation\nKW-6002 (Istradefylline, Sigma-Aldrich) is a selective A\n2A\nreceptor antagonist with a Ki of 29.6 nM in rats. It\u2019s half-life of 110 min and 97% CNS bioavailability after intraperitoneal injections (\nYang et al., 2007\n) make it suitable for use in prolonged in vivo experiments. KW6002 was dissolved in DMSO at 9.3 mg/mL, sonicated and stored at 4 \u00b0C in a dark vial.\n2.2.7. Experimental design\nFive days post-telemeter implantation, simultaneous plethysmography and EMG recordings were made during normoxia and MCS to establish pre-treatment values. One day post-injury, the same protocols were repeated. Twenty-seven rats were randomly allocated into five groups: 1) daily AIH (dAIH) + KW6002 (n = 8); 2) dAIH + vehicle (n = 8); 3) daily Nx (dNx) + KW6002 (n = 4); 4) dNx + vehicle (n = 4); and 5) recording controls (n = 3). Group 1 rats received intra-peritoneal KW6002 injections (0.5 mg/kg) immediately before AIH on 7 consecutive days (i.e. dAIH) beginning 8 weeks post-C2HS (i.e. weeks 8\u20139 post-C2HS), and then before thrice-weekly AIH until 16 weeks post-C2HS. Group 2 received daily AIH, but with vehicle injections (DMSO). Group 3 and 4 rats (drug time controls) were exposed to normoxia only (room air), with A\n2A\nantagonist or vehicle injections as appropriate. Recording controls (laminectomy only) received normoxia only, without intraperitoneal injections (see\nFig. 1\nfor experimental design).\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nTimeline describing the study design from day 1 (1d) until 16 weeks post-spinal cord injury (wps). C2HS: cervical hemisection in second segment (C2), dAIH/Nx: daily acute intermittent hypoxia or normoxia for seven days depending on groups (see methods). R3 refers to three times per week presentations of acute intermittent hypoxia or normoxia from week 9\u201316 post-injury. M1\u2013M8 refers to weekly measurements including simultaneous plethysmography and electromyography of bilateral diaphragm and second external intercostal muscles.\n2.2.8. Acute intermittent hypoxia\nNormoxic (21% O\n2\n) and hypoxia (10.5% O\n2\n) were established in custom-made, cylindrical Plexiglas chambers (12 in. long, 4 in. inner diameter; 1 rat per chamber; rats rested on flat flooring) by mixing O\n2\nand N\n2\nwith a custom-made, computer-controlled mass-flow controller system. Within the chambers, CO\n2\nand O\n2\nlevels were continuously monitored (VacuMed Inc, Ventura, CA). Gas flowed through the chambers at 4 L/min, keeping chamber CO\n2\nconcentration below 0.2%. At 9:00 a.m., rats received intraperitoneal KW6002 or vehicle injections, followed by AIH (10, 5-min hypoxic episodes, 10.5% O\n2\n; 5-min 21% O\n2\n). Chamber temperature was kept between 22.5 and 24.5 \u00b0C.\n2.2.9. Maximum chemoreceptor stimulation\nHypoxic (10.5% O\n2\n) and hypercapnic conditions (7% CO\n2\n) were established in plethysmography chambers by mixing O\n2\n, N\n2\nand CO\n2\nvia a custom-made, computer-controlled mass flow controller system. After 30 min, baseline measurements were made breathing air (20 min) followed by MCS (20 min). We previously demonstrated that combined hypoxia and hypercapnia elicits a greater breathing response (tidal volume, frequency and diaphragm amplitude) versus continuous hypoxia (\nNavarrete-Opazo and Mitchell, 2014\n).\n2.2.10. Tissue processing\nTo verify the extent of C2HS, rats were deeply anesthetized, their spinal cords removed and immersion fixed in paraformaldehyde (4%, overnight at 4 \u00b0C). Spinal tissues were cryoprotected with sucrose (20\u201330%), frozen in isopentane (\u221245 \u00b0C) and then stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Longitudinal spinal sections (C1 to C6, 30 \u03bcm thick) were stained with cresyl violet and examined histologically with light microscopy to reconstruct the injury (\nVinit et al., 2006\n) as described by Paxinos and Watson (\nPaxinos and Watson, 1998\n). NIH ImageJ software (National Institute of Health;\nhttp://rsb.info.nih.gov/jj\n) was used to measure hemisection area.\n\n2.3. Data analyses\nEMG signals were analyzed with Neuroscore software. Each signal was filtered (100\u2013624 Hz), rectified, integrated (100 msec) and averaged (bilateral diaphragm/T2 EIC). Values during active locomotor and grooming activity were excluded from analysis. Inspiratory EMG burst amplitude from each muscle was normalized as a percent change from its own pre-injury values.\nAll variables were compared within and among groups for time (baseline and MCS) and treatment via two-way, repeated measures ANOVA with Fisher\u2019s LSD\npost hoc\ntests (Sigma-Stat version 2.03, Systat Software Inc, San Jose, CA, USA). Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. Values are expressed as means \u00b1 1 SEM."

The animals were housed, cared for, and maintained in a United\nStates Department of Agriculture (USDA) approved and inspected facility. All\nbehavioral and surgical protocols were approved by the University of South\nDakota (USD) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and conducted\nin accordance with USDA, National Institutes of Health, and Society for\nNeuroscience guidelines for the ethical treatment of experimental animals. Prior\nto beginning the study, each monkey was evaluated by a primate veterinarian and\njudged to be healthy and free of any neurological deficit. Proximal and distal\nmovements and range of motion at the joints in both upper extremities of all\nanimals were normal with the exception of SDM55. In this case the\ninterphalangeal joints of digit 3 were permanently extended. However, this\nanimal was able to perform precision opposition with digits 1 and 2 to\nsuccessfully acquire the food rewards in the motor tests.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nLine drawings of the lateral surface of the cerebral cortex illustrating the\nlocation of the lesion site (blackened area) in the 7 frontal motor lesion cases\nreported in this study.

Both devices were attached\nto the monkey\u2019s cage and controlled, without restraint, which hand the\nmonkey used to perform the tests (\nFig. 5\n).\nEach hand was tested both pre- and post-lesion. The monkeys were allowed to move\nfreely about the cage between trials in both tests and palatable food targets\nwere used to minimize training effects. Using the mDB device we assessed\nduration and accuracy of targeted reaching, manipulation duration as well as the\nnumber of times the digit lost contact with the target (a small food pellet\ninside wells of varying diameter). Using the mMAP device we measured forces\napplied during grasp and manipulation of a carrot chip (or, in one monkey, a\ntype of cereal due to its preference for the cereal over a carrot chip) from a\nflat surface or over straight and curved rods.\nFigure 5.\nOpen in a new tab\nMotor testing Apparati: drawing of the modified movement assessment panel (mMAP)\nfrom an angled frontal/side view (A); picture of the mMAP showing the monkey\nreaching for the carrot chip on the curved rod (B); drawing of the modified\ndexterity board (mDB) from a front view (C); and picture of the mDB showing a\nmonkey reaching to grasp the food pellet. The curved lines in A, C show the path\nof the hand to the target. Note that the devices allow independent testing of\neach hand by blocking exit from the cage to the testing apparatus from one side.\nWith the mMAP device we measure applied 3D forces and duration of manipulation\nand use these to compute a performance score (higher performance scores for\ntrials with lower applied forces and shorter duration). With the mDB device we\nmeasure duration and accuracy of reaching (distance of index tip to target) as\nwell as duration of manipulation of the food pellet target\n\nVideo and Force Data Acquisition\nmMAP Task\nForces applied during manipulation of the carrot chip in the mMAP\ntask (\nFig 5A, B\n) were recorded at 200\nsamples/s using Datapac 2k2 (Run Technologies). Movements of the hand during\nthe mMAP task were recorded using a single digital video camera (Sony, model\nDCR-DVD301) placed directly in front of the cage. These recordings were used\nfor qualitative ratings of the movement strategy and to assess\nsuccess/failure of the animal on each trial.\nmDB Task\nQuantitative video recordings of hand movements during the mDB task\n(\nFig. 5C, D\n) were used to assess\nspatial and temporal variables (e.g., accuracy and duration of the initial\nreach, grip aperture at touchdown of the hand, etc.) as described previously\n(\nDarling et al., 2009\n). These\nrecordings used four digital video cameras interfaced with the SIMI Motion\ndata acquisition package (SIMI Reality Motion Systems, Unterschleissheim,\nGermany). Video data collection began when the portal door was opened to\nallow the monkey to reach toward the food pellet and continued until the\npellet was retrieved into the cage, the pellet was knocked off of the\nplatform, or a 60 s time limit had expired. Video collection was manually\ntriggered and single trial video clips of each trial were manually created\nand verified. Details of the video collection protocol, data acquisition,\nand data analysis of the mDB task are provided in our previous work (\nPizzimenti, et. al, 2007\n).\n\nBehavioral Procedures\nDetails of the behavioral protocols used in the current investigation\nhave been described previously. Before the motor testing sessions, monkeys were\nfood restricted for 18\u201324 hours (\nDarling\net al., 2009\n). To determine which hemisphere would receive the\nlesion, hand preference was assessed. This was accomplished using a standard\ndexterity board (sDB) device that allowed the monkey to choose which hand to use\non 150 trials over 3 days. The number of initial reaches and subsequent reaches\nwith each hand on each trial was assessed from video recordings of the two\nsessions and used to compute an index of hand preference as described previously\n(\nNudo et al., 1992\n) (\nTable 1\n). Training on the mMAP and mDB devices began\nafter hand preference was determined. This was followed by a series of\npre-lesion full testing sessions until stable performance was achieved for the\nmDB (5 trials on each of 5 wells, totaling 25 trials with each hand) and for the\nmMAP (5 trials for each test level (flat surface, straight rod, curved rod),\ntotaling 15 trials with each hand). Post-lesion testing was performed weekly for\n8 weeks, then every other week for 3\u201312 months (\nTable 1\n). During the first few post-lesion tests,\nthe more impaired hand was tested first on the flat surface task (easiest task)\nto ensure high motivation. Once the monkey began successfully retrieving the\ncarrot chips, the more impaired hand was tested first on the curved rod task to\nensure high motivation on this difficult task.\n\nSurgical Procedure\nThe frontal surgical lesions included the arm area of primary motor\ncortex (M1) and the adjacent arm area of the lateral premotor cortex (LPMC) (F2\nlesion \u2013 7 cases). The frontoparietal surgical lesions included the same\nparts of M1 and LMPC plus the arm area of primary somatosensory motor cortex\n(S1) and adjacent part of area PE (F2P2 lesion \u2013 6 cases). All lesions\nwere placed in the hemisphere contralateral to the preferred limb using surgical\nprocedures approved by the University of South Dakota (USD) Institutional Animal\nCare and Use Committee (IACUC). Preoperatively, each monkey was injected with\neither glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg/kg IM) or atropine sulfate (0.05mg/kg),\nimmobilized with ketamine hydrochloride (10mg/kg), intubated then placed on a\nmechanical respirator where it was deeply anesthetized with isoflurane\ninhalation (1.2\u20131.5%) and a surgical grade air/oxygen mixture.\nThe monkey was placed into a head holding device and administered mannitol\n(1.5\u20132g/kg) intravenously to reduce brain volume and tissue\naccessibility during surgery and reduce risk of brain swelling and cortical\ninjury during craniotomy. Using aseptic sterile surgical technique, a skin\nincision was made over the lateral frontoparietal region and an elliptical\nsection of bone was removed using sharped-tip bone cutters and periosteal\nelevators then placed in chilled sterile physiological saline solution for the\nduration of the surgery. A \u2013U-shaped incision was made in the dura over\nthe lateral convexity of the cerebral hemisphere and reflected, thus exposing\nthe cortical surface. The animal was then transferred to intravenous ketamine\nanesthetic sedation for electrophysiological mapping of M1 and LPMC or of M1,\nLPMC and S1. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) was used to localize the arm\nareas of M1 and LPMC, as previously described (\nMorecraft et al., 2015\n,\n2016\n;\nMorecraft et al., 2013\n), and S1,\nwhich can also elicit upper limb motion in primates with surface stimulation\n(\nWoolsey et al, 1958\n) and ICMS\n(Burnish et al., 2008, Widener and Cheney, 1997). To accomplish this, a tungsten\nelectrode (impedance 0.5\u20131.5 M\u03a9) was inserted 200 \u03bcm\nbelow the pial surface then advanced at 500 \u03bcm intervals. Movements were\nevoked using a train duration of 50 ms and pulse duration of 0.2 ms delivered at\n330 Hz. Current intensity ranged between 0.1 and 90 \u03bcA. Threshold\ncurrents were determined and the evoked movements were recorded when agreed upon\nby two observers. After defining the location and borders of the forelimb\nrepresentations and non-excitable cortex (i.e., the rostral part of frontal area\n6DR and parietal area PE), the animal was returned to isoflurane anesthesia.\nSurface vessels supplying the targeted lesion areas were ligated using\nelectrocauterization, which was followed approximately 5\u201310 minutes\nlater by subpial aspiration to extract the affected gray matter and assure a\nthorough lesion (\nMcNeal et al., 2010\n;\nMorecraft et al., 2015\n). The\naspirated area was covered for approximately 15\u201320 minutes with saline\nsoaked cottonoid padding to control bleeding and promote injury homeostasis. The\ncottonoid padding was carefully removed and the dura was sutured closed. The\nretracted bone was then replaced and anchored with 3-0 suture passed through\nopposing burr holes made in the bone graft and intact cranium. Finally, the\nepicranial aponeurosis and temporalis muscle were reattached and the skin closed\nusing standard neurosurgical techniques. Each animal was monitored\npost-surgically throughout the survival period. Buprenorphine\n(0.01\u20130.5mg/kg) was administered immediately after surgery for\n48\u201372 hours. Twenty four hours prior to the surgery, and for at least 9\ndays post-surgery, each animal was administered an antibiotic (bicillin\n\u2013LA, 60\u2013100 units/kg every 3 days; or amoxicillin, 11mg/kg\ndaily; or baytril, 5mg/kg daily which was discontinued due to interference with\ndextran tract tracer transport in 4 animal experiments). In all cases, a second\nsurgery (also approved by the USD IACUC) was performed 33\u201334 days prior\nto sacrifice when neural tract tracers were injected into cortical areas of\ninterest for post-mortem study of the reorganized neural connections that occur\nfollowing brain injury.\n\nHistological Procedures\nFollowing the predetermined survival period, each monkey was deeply\nanesthetized with an overdose of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg or more) and perfused\ntranscardially with 0.9% saline. This was immediately followed by 2\nliters of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB) at pH 7.4,\nthen one liter each of 10% and 30% sucrose in 0.1M PB at pH 7.4\nfor cryoprotection. The brain was removed, blocked into cortical, brainstem and\nspinal cord regions, placed in 30% sucrose in 0.1M PB, and refrigerated\nfor 2 to 5 days at 4\u00b0 C. Post-mortem digital electronic images of the\ncentral nervous system were taken for data reconstruction. The cortical tissue\nwas frozen sectioned in the coronal plane on a sliding microtome (American\nOptical 860, Buffalo, NY, USA) at a thickness of 50 \u03bcm in cycles of 10,\nforming 10 complete series of evenly spaced tissue sections respectively. SDM56\nwas cut at a thickness of 60 \u03bcm in cycles of 10. One series of tissue\nsections was processed for Nissl substance using our previously described\nhistochemical methods (\nMorecraft et al.,\n2004\n;\nMorecraft et al., 1992\n;\nMorecraft et al., 2012\n) and used for\nthe lesion volume analysis in the present report. Additional series of tissue\nsections were used for immunohistochemical visualization of neural tract tracers\nfor neuroanatomical tract tracing studies (\nMcNeal et al., 2010\n;\nMorecraft et\nal., 2015\n,\n2016\n).\n\nEstimation of Lesion Volume\nThe methods for estimating gray and white matter lesion volume were\ndescribed previously (\nDarling et al.,\n2009\n;\nMcNeal et al., 2010\n).\nBriefly, Nissl stained tissue sections at 500 (or 600 in case SDM56) \u03bcm\nintervals through the lesion site were examined for tissue damage. Effects of\natrophic distortions on lesion volume (\nDenny-Brown et al., 1975\n;\nMarshall\net al., 2000\n) were minimized by superimposing an outline of the\nlesion site onto the undamaged hemisphere to calculate the total gray matter and\ntotal white lesion volume as described previously (\nDarling et al., 2009\n). We also estimated percentage\nof the upper limb areas of M1 rostral (M1r), M1 caudal (M1c), S1 rostral (S1r)\nand S1 caudal (S1c) damaged by the lesion for three reasons: (1) to normalize\nlesion volume to upper limb map volume in each animal; (2) corticospinal\nprojection neurons in M1c (which line the anterior bank of the central sulcus)\nmay be particularly important in control of hand movements due to presence of\nmonosynaptic connections with lamina IX motoneurons (\nLemon, 2008\n;\nLemon\nand Griffiths, 2005\n;\nRathelot and\nStrick, 2006\n;\n2009\n) and; (3)\nthe importance of short somatosensory affiliated projections from S1r neurons to\nM1c neurons for fine motor control (\nKaneko et\nal., 1994a\n,\nb\n). Thus, larger\npercentage lesion volumes of M1c and S1r may be particularly important in\ncreating long-term deficits in hand motor function. Percentage of total gray\nmatter of these areas that was damaged was computed from gray matter lesion\nvolume within the defined area and total volume of the area defined using ICMS\n(\nTable 1\n). In most cases, near\ncomplete removal of the hand/arm region of M1r and S1c on the lateral aspect of\nthe cortex was accomplished, but variable amounts of M1c and S1r deep within the\ncentral sulcus were removed (\nTable\n1\n).\n\nData Analysis\nWe quantified pre- and post-lesion performance of the contralesional\nhand on the mDB and mMAP tasks using performance scores (see\nSupplementary Methods\n) derived from\nmeasures such as reach duration and accuracy (reach performance \u2013 mDB),\nmanipulation duration and number of grasp attempts (manipulation performance\n\u2013 mDB) and manipulation duration and total absolute impulse during\nmanipulation (manipulation performance \u2013 mMAP) as described previously\n(\nDarling et al., 2006\n;\nDarling et al., 2009\n;\nPizzimenti et al., 2007\n). We also recorded the first\nattempt, first success and consistent success (all 5 trials at a single level of\ndifficulty) on the mDB (any well, best well, 2\nnd\nwell) and mMAP (flat\nsurface, straight rod, curved rod) to assess rate of recovery (\nTable 2\n). Skill was quantified as the mean\nperformance score divided by standard deviation of performance score on the best\nwell and a 2\nnd\nwell of the mDB (with pre-lesion performance scores\nabout 50% of those on the best well) and on the curved rod task of the\nmMAP over the last 5 complete testing sessions before the lesion (pre-lesion\nskill) and the best 5 consecutive testing sessions after the lesion (post-lesion\nskill). Recovery of skill was measured as the ratio of the post-lesion to\npre-lesion skill. We also quantified post-lesion decrement in performance as the\nratio of the mean performance score over the first 4 post-lesion tests (over 4\nweeks) to the last 5 pre-lesion tests.\nTable 2.\nPost-lesion duration of impairment in the modified dexterity board and modified\nmovement assessment panel tasks\nPost-lesion week of:\nCase\n1\nst\nattempt\n1\nst\nsuccess\nconsistent success\na\nmDB\nmMAP\nmDB\nmMAP\nmDB\nmMAP\nAW\nb\nBW\nc\nW2\nd\nflat\nstr\ne\ncrvd\nAW\nBW\nW2\nflat\nstr\ncrvd\nAW\nBW\nW2\nflat\nstr\ncrvd\nSDM45\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nSDM48\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n2\n3\n2\n3\n5\n6\n2\n3\n4\nSDM55\n1\n1\n2\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n4\n4\n3\n4\n4\n1\n4\n5\nSDM64\n4\n4\n4\n2\n3\n4\n4\n4\n4\n2\n5\n7\n5\n6\n5\n3\n7\n8\nSDM70\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n4\n1\n3\n2\nSDM74\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nSDM80\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nSDM71\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n1\n2\n3\n3\n3\n5\n2\n3\n4\nSDM76\n1\n2\n2\n4\n4\n3\n2\n2\n2\n4\n4\n4\n2\n2\n5\nNA\ng\nNA\n4\nSDM81\n1\n1\n2\n3\n1\n1\n2\n2\n4\n3\n3\n3\n6\n28\n*\n6\n3\n3\n3\nSDM83\n1\n3\n3\n2\n1\n2\n3\n3\n7\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\nNA\n2\n2\n2\nSDM87\n3\n3\n4\n1\n2\n5\n3\n3\n4\n2\n5\n6\n4\n4\n6\n5\n7\n6\nSDM91\n4\n6\nNA\n5\n1\n4\n5\n6\nNA\n5\nNA\nNA\n7\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nOpen in a new tab\nAbbreviations:\na\nConsistent Success - successful acquisition on all 5 trials for a mDB well or\nmMAP task;\nb\nAW \u2013 any well of mDB;\nc\nBW \u2013 mDB best well (with highest pre-lesion skill);\nd\nW2 \u2013 smaller well of mDB with lower pre-lesion skill than best\nwell;\ne\nstr \u2013 straight rod task of mMAP;\nf\ncrvd \u2013 curved rod task of mMAP;\ng\nNA \u2013 not applicable (i.e., no post-lesion attempts or successful\nacquisitions or consistent successful acquisitions).\n*\nSDM81 often dropped the food pellet in the best well (E) task during the\npost-lesion phase, presumably due to lack of an adequate grasp. Note that\nwell E is only a small dimple to hold the food pellet, thus the sides of the\nwell cannot be used to assist with grasping the food pellet.\nRegression Analyses\nThe overall goal of these analyses was to determine whether lesions\nto specific brain sensorimotor areas predicted lesion effects on initial\nperformance deficits in the 1\nst\npost-lesion month and on\nlong-term recovery of skill better than a simple model of total gray and\nwhite matter lesion volumes. Thus, we used forward stepwise multiple linear\nregression with dependent variables relevant to deficits and recovery of\nfine motor function with the following sets of independent (predictor)\nvariables: (1) total gray and total white matter lesion volumes (TGMLV,\nTWMLV); (2) frontal gray white matter lesion volumes (FGMLV, FWMLV) and\nparietal gray and white matter lesion volumes (PGMLV, PWMLV); and (3)\npercent of M1c hand/arm area lesion volume (M1cLV%), LPMC lesion\nvolume (LPMCLV), percent of S1r lesion volume (S1rLV%) and area PE\nlesion volume (PELV). Since collinearity of predictor variables may\ninfluence regression coefficients for these variables we computed the\nvariance inflation factors (VIFs) and tolerances (Ts) for the predictor\nvariables for each regression analysis and report these in Tables 4, 5 and 6. The purpose of\nthe latter analysis was to examine whether lesion induced initial deficits\nand recovery could be primarily attributed to damage to the peri-Rolandic\nareas M1c and S1r and the higher order premotor area (LPMC) and sensory\nassociation area (PE) or more generally to total gray matter lesion volume\nor to frontal and parietal gray matter lesion volume. Variables were added\nto the multiple regression equation only if they increased the coefficient\nof determination by at least 0.05 (i.e., percentage of explained variance\nincreased by 5%). We compared coefficients of determination to\nidentify appropriate models for prediction of post-lesion deficits in motor\nperformance and recovery of fine motor skill.\nWe did not include additional predictor variables of percentage\nlesion volumes of M1r and S1c despite their potential importance in recovery\nof hand function because almost 100% of M1r was damaged/removed in\nall monkeys and 100% of S1c was removed in monkeys with\nfrontoparietal lesions (\nTable 1\n). We\nalso did not include damage to LMPC in these regression analyses because we\nestimated that nearly 100% of the arm area of LPMC, as determined by\nintracortical microstimulation, was resected in all cases. We completed a\nlarge number of regression analyses performed on possibly correlated\nvariables (e.g., r = 0.76, p = 0.003 for correlation of\ntotal white and gray matter lesion volumes). However, because this is an\nexploratory study in a relatively small number of subjects to assess how\nlesion volumes affect initial deficits after the lesion and recovery of hand\nmotor performance, we report uncorrected p-values and variables that\ncontributed significantly to prediction of dependent variables."

    "Methods": "Animals\nExperiments were performed using adult male and female Sprague Dawley rats (150\u2013200 grams; Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN), housed two to three per cage under a 12-hour dark-light cycle. Ovariectomies were performed by the supplier during which rats were administered 41.7 mg ketamine (i.m.), 8.3 mg/kg xylazine (i.m.) and 3.0 mg/kg ketoprofen (s.q.). Wound clips used to close the surgical incisions were removed 10 days post-surgery, as recommended by the supplier. Male rats were housed for at least one week, while OVX rats were housed for at least two weeks, before beginning experiments. Food and water were available\nad libitum\n. All experiments were performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines for investigation of experimental pain in conscious animals and the guidelines of the Indiana University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (\nZimmermann, 1983\n).\n\nChemicals\nLetrozole and exemestane were obtained from United States Pharmacopeia (Rockville, MD). F-12 and DMEM/F-12 media, as well as heat-inactivated horse serum, glutamine, normocin, and penicillin-streptomycin were obtained from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). Papain was obtained from Worthington (Lakewood, NJ). The rabbit anti-rat CGRP antiserum was a gift from Dr. Michael Iadorola (NIH) and its selectivity has been previously characterized (\nVasko et al., 1994\n). All other chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO).\n\nDrug administration\nIn behavioral experiments, on the day of drug injection, letrozole and exemestane powders were dissolved in a 2.5 to 30 percent solution of hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP\u03b2CD) in sterile normal saline. AIs were administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections (1 to 30 mg/kg) using a 26G needle. In all experiments, animals in both experimental and control groups received equal amounts of HP\u03b2CD in equal injection volumes (5 mL/kg; approximately 1 mL). ATP was prepared in ice-cold sterile phosphate buffered saline (0.01M, pH 7.4) (PBS) and kept on ice until injection. Prior to injection, ATP and PBS vehicle solutions were drawn into a syringe and warmed to room temperature. Injections in the paw were administered intradermally in the mid-plantar footpad using a 31G needle (50 \u00b5L injection volume).\n\nBehavioral testing\nExperiments were performed between 7 AM and 3 PM during the animals\u2019 light cycle. After a minimum of one week in the animal care facility, animals were acclimated to the testing environment on multiple days for one week preceding any behavioral measurement or drug administration. Prior to each measurement session, animals were acclimated in the testing apparatus for approximately 30 minutes or until grooming or exploratory behavioral ceased. In all experiments, the observer was blinded to treatment and data analysis was completed at the conclusion of the experiment. In animals receiving chronic drug treatment, behavioral measures were assessed prior to the next daily drug administration.\nFor repeated measures experiments evaluating sensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimuli, baseline responses were obtained by exposing animals to stimuli two to three times on separate days prior to drug administration. The measurement immediately prior to the first drug injection, however, was used as the baseline response. In order to minimize the potential confounding effect of baseline response on drug-induced changes in these longitudinal experiments, both male and OVX rats were rank ordered with respect to baseline mechanical sensitivity, outliers (paw withdrawal threshold greater than 15 or less than 4 grams) were excluded, and the remaining animals were randomized into treatment groups. Approximately 15% of animals evaluated at baseline were excluded from further testing.\nThe von Frey filament test was used to ascertain mechanical sensitivity. Rats were placed in an elevated cage with a wire mesh bottom that allowed for stimulation of hind paws. Paw withdrawal response to mechanical stimulation was evaluated with calibrated Semmes and Weinstein monofilaments, using a modification of the \u201cup-down method\u201d (0.4 \u2013 26 grams, the lower and upper limit of the test; Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) (\nChaplan et al., 1994\n). Filaments were applied to the mid-plantar surface of each hind paw, with trials starting with the four gram filament. A trial consisted of three applications of a filament for approximately five seconds, with at least five seconds separating successive stimulation. A positive response was defined as an abrupt paw withdrawal when the stimulus was applied, or paw withdrawal immediately upon removal of the filament. The paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) in grams was the stimulus/filament evoking a paw withdrawal response in at least two of the three stimulations. PWT was measured for both hind paws and averaged to generate final withdrawal threshold at the specified time point.\nThe Hargreaves test was used to assess thermal sensitivity. Rats were placed in a ventilated acrylic cage atop a flat glass surface. Paw withdrawal latency (PWL) to noxious radiant heat was assessed using an infra-red (IR) heat source (Ugo Basile, Italy) applied to the mid-plantar surface of each hind paw (\nHargreaves et al., 1988\n). Upon initiating the thermal stimulus, an electronic timer was activated. A paw withdrawal (flinching or lifting the paw) was detected by a photocell, which switched off the IR source and timer, yielding the PWL. The heat source intensity was chosen to yield baseline paw withdrawal latencies of 10 seconds in the rats. A cutoff of 30 seconds was used to avoid tissue damage to the paw. At least 30 seconds separated successive trials in the same animal. PWL from each hind paw was measured three times and all six measurements were averaged to generate the final latency in seconds at the specified time point.\nNociceptive behavior in response to ATP was made by observing unrestrained animals on a glass surface covered by an inverted and ventilated four liter plastic beaker. Mirrors were positioned below and behind the beaker for behavioral assessment, regardless of animal orientation. Once acclimated to the testing environment, animals were removed, lightly restrained, and administered an intradermal injection in the left hind paw. Animals were immediately returned to the testing apparatus and behavior was observed. As a measure of spontaneous nocifensive behavior, flinching or shaking of the injected paw or hindquarters was recorded (\nMcGaraughty et al., 2003\n;\nWheeler-Aceto and Cowan, 1991\n). Each observed behavior was recorded as one flinch and behavioral responses were tallied in one minute intervals for 10 minutes following the injection.\n\nIsolation and cell culture of adult rat sensory neurons\nCultures of sensory neurons for electrophysiological studies were prepared using a protocol developed by Lindsay (\nLindsay, 1988\n) and subsequently modified by Chi and Nicol (\nChi and Nicol, 2007\n). Briefly, rats were sacrificed in a CO\n2\nchamber and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were dissected into an ice cold solution of Puck\u2019s saline solution composed of (in mM): 171 NaCl, 6.7 KCl, 1.6 NaHPO\n4\n, 0.46 KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, and 6.1 D-glucose, pH 7.4. DRGs were serially digested in F-12 medium containing 10 U/mL of papain (10 min at 37\u00b0C in 3% CO\n2\n) and 1 mg/mL collagenase IA / 2.5 mg/mL dispase (50 min at 37\u00b0C in 3% CO\n2\n). Following centrifugation (1000\ng\nfor 1 min) and resuspension in F-12 medium (supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 \u00b5g/mL normocin, 50 units/mL penicillin, 50 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin, 50 \u00b5M 5-fluoro-2\u2019-deoxyuridine (FDU), and 150 \u00b5M uridine), the ganglia were mechanically dissociated into a single cell suspension using a fire-polished glass pipette. Cells were plated at an approximate density of 7,500 cells per well of a 48-well plate containing plastic coverslips pre-coated with 0.1 mg/mL of poly-D-lysine and 10 \u00b5g/mL of laminin. Cells were maintained in culture at 37\u00b0C and 3% CO\n2\nfor 2 to 6 hours before initiating patch clamp electrophysiology recordings.\n\nElectrophysiological recording\nCurrent clamp recording were performed using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique at room temperature (~23\u00b0C) (\nHamill et al., 1981\n;\nZhang et al., 2012\n). Briefly, plastic coverslips containing the sensory neurons were placed inside an open diamond bath chamber (Model RC-25, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA) containing a solution of normal Ringers composed of (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 1 MgCl\n2\n, 10 HEPES and 10 glucose (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Glass capillary tubes were used to pull recording pipettes with a Warner Instruments pipette puller (Model G85165T-4). The pipette resistance measured 2\u20135 M\u03a9 when filled with an intracellular solution composed of the following (in mM): 140 KCl, 5 MgCl\n2\n, 4 ATP disodium salt, 0.3 GTP monosodium salt, 2.5 CaCl\n2\n, 5 EGTA (free Ca\n2+\nconcentration calculated at ~100 nM), and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3 with KOH). The final sodium concentration in the pipette solution was 8.3 mM. After achieving the whole-cell configuration, recordings were acquired with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Traces from current clamp experiments were filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 2 kHz. The data were acquired and analyzed using either pCLAMP 8.0 or pCLAMP 10.0.\nUpon establishing the whole-cell configuration in either small-diameter (20 \u00b5m) or medium-diameter (35 \u00b5m) sensory neurons, the cells were held at their resting membrane potentials, which ranged between \u221245 and \u221265 mV. Immediately thereafter, the cells were injected with a 500 picoampere (pA) ramp of depolarizing current over 1000 ms and the resulting action potentials (APs) were recorded. The same ramp of current was used in all cells independent of drug treatment to assess alterations in excitability caused by AI exposure. The AP traces were used to calculate all parameters of sensory neuronal excitability except for the rheobase and input resistance, which were determined by injecting a series of 200 millisecond (ms) current steps of variable incremental amplitudes until the firing of a single AP was observed. At the conclusion of each recording session, 300 nM of capsaicin was superfused into the recording chamber and AP firing measured to ascertain whether the neurons were capsaicin-sensitive\n\nRelease of calcitonin gene-related peptide from spinal cord tissue\nSpinal cord slices were prepared as previously described (\nChen et al., 1996\n). After rats were sacrificed using CO\n2\nasphyxiation and decapitation, a 1 cm segment of the lumbar enlargement was dissected, chopped transversely and parasagitally into 0.3 \u00d7 0.3 mm sections, and placed into an individual cylindrical perfusion chamber. Slices were perfused at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 200 \u00b5M ascorbic acid, 100 \u00b5M Phe-Ala, 20 \u00b5M bacitracin, and 10 \u00b5M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), aerated with 95% O\n2\n\u2013 5% CO\n2\n, and maintained at 37\u00b0C. After perfusing slices for 20 minutes to equilibrate the tissue, perfusate was collected in 3 minute intervals throughout the experiment (1.5 ml/fraction) using an automatic fraction collector. Baseline release was established by perfusing tissue with HEPES for 18 minutes (6 fractions), with the last 3 fractions used to determine basal or resting release. Subsequently, potassium-stimulated release was determined by perfusing tissue for an additional 9 minutes (3 fractions) with HEPES buffer containing 30 mM KCl (substituted for equimolar NaCl). Lastly, slices were perfused with HEPES buffer for 21 minutes (7 fractions) to re-establish basal release. Following tissue perfusion, spinal cord tissue was collected and homogenized in 2 ml of 0.1 N HCl. Homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The supernatants were serially diluted with HEPES buffer and assayed for immunoreactive CGRP (iCGRP) along with perfusate fractions by radioimmunoassay as previously described (\nChen et al., 1996\n). The total iCGRP content in each tissue slice was calculated as content measured in all perfusate fractions plus tissue homogenate.\n\nStatistical analysis\nUnless otherwise specified, data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (S.E.M.) and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Effects of letrozole on PWT and PWL were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures (two-way RM-ANOVA), followed by post hoc two-sample t-tests. One-way RM-ANOVA was used to evaluate whether PWT and PWL changed over time during behavioral testing. Because PWT was measured using logarithmic intervals in pressure exerted by sequential filaments, log\n10\n-transformed thresholds were used for data analysis. To compare treatment effects on PWT and PWL between studies, we normalized baseline responses by calculating percent change from baseline for each rat. In experiments evaluating overt nociceptive behavior, numbers of flinches observed in one-minute intervals were compared between treatment groups using the Mann-Whitney U test. Cumulative ATP-induced nociceptive behavior is reported as median (25\nth\npercentile, 75\nth\npercentile) and was compared between treatment groups using the Mann-Whitney U test. Boxplots depict overt nociceptive behavior as five-number summaries with horizontal lines representing (from top to bottom): 75\nth\npercentile + (1.5 \u00d7 interquartile range) (upper whisker), 75\nth\npercentile, median, 25\nth\npercentile, 25\nth\npercentile - (1.5 \u00d7 interquartile range) (lower whisker).\nIn order to determine the various parameters of excitability, the voltage was differentiated with respect to time (dV/dt) and the average of the voltage differential was calculated across the first 100 ms of the ramp stimulus in order to yield a baseline dV/dt. The firing threshold (FT) was the voltage at which the first AP was fired. This was taken as the point at which the dV/dt exceeded the baseline by greater than twenty-fold. The latency to fire was the time point in the ramp stimulus at which the FT was achieved. In order to determine input resistance, a negative current step of 200 ms duration was injected into the cell. The resulting peak potential achieved was subtracted from the resting membrane potential and the difference was divided by the value of the current step in order to yield the final input resistance value. Statistical significance was determined by comparing groups to their respective vehicle controls using two-sample t-tests.\nPeptide release from spinal cord tissue is expressed as the amount released per minute in each fraction, divided by the total iCGRP content for that spinal cord sample (percent of total content per minute). Treatment effects were evaluated by comparing peptide release during the three basal fractions to peptide release during the three stimulated fractions. The difference between iCGRP released during exposure to high potassium (stimulated) and iCGRP released during drug or vehicle exposure prior to high potassium stimulation (basal) is termed evoked release. Treatment effects on iCGRP content and release were evaluated using two-sample t-tests."

All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol #12-09006) and conducted in accordance with the guidelines prepared by the Committee on Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Institute of Laboratory Animals Resources, National Research Council. All animal studies complied with the ARRIVE guidelines. All efforts were made to minimize suffering. Mice were euthanized through an overdose of isoflurane.\n\nTMEV infection\nC57BL/6J mice were anesthetized with isoflurane by inhalation and infected intracerebrally (i.c.) with 3 \u00d7 10\n5\nplaque-forming units (pfu) of the Daniels (DA) strain of TMEV at a final volume of 20 \u03bcl per mouse. The site of injection was in the postparietal cortex of the right cerebral hemisphere to a depth of 2 mm [posterior (caudal) and medial of the right eye at approximately bregma \u22122 mm and interaural +8 mm] (\nKirkman et al, 2010\n). The needle had a William\u2019s collar to limit penetration of the tip to 2 mm. The DA strain of TMEV was propagated as previously described (\nTsunoda et al, 1997\n).\n\nDrug treatment\nTMEV-infected mice were treated, via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, with MK 801 (1 mg/kg twice daily, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), GYKI-52466 (10 mg/kg twice daily, Sigma) (\nNargi-Aizenman et al, 2004\n) or NBQX (approximately 22.5 mg/kg twice daily, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) (\nDocagne et al, 2007\n), all in a 25 \u03bcl volume, starting on day 2.5 p.i. and stopping on day 10.5 p.i. These doses are tolerated and considered sufficient to block ionotropic glutamate receptor transmission in an efficient and specific manner. Control infected mice were i.p. injected with 25 \u03bcl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\nSeizure scoring\nC57BL/6J mice infected with DA were weighed and monitored daily for seizures through day 21 p.i. The monitoring of seizure activity was performed as previously described (\nLibbey et al, 2011a\n). Briefly, mice were observed for 2 hours each day immediately following the first injection of antagonist of the day. However, if a mouse experienced a new seizure (i.e. the mouse had not previously been observed having a seizure) immediately following the second injection of antagonist of the day, then the seizure was scored and recorded. Mice were scored for 1 seizure per mouse per day. Seizure activity was graded using the Racine scale: stage 1, mouth and facial movements; stage 2, head nodding; stage 3, forelimb clonus; stage 4, rearing; stage 5, rearing and falling (\nBenkovic et al, 2004\n;\nRacine, 1972\n). Seizure burden was analyzed by assessing both seizure incidence (numbers of mice having seizures, numbers of observed seizures per mouse) and seizure severity [cumulative seizure score per mouse, numbers of mice with the various maximum seizure scores (stages 1\u20135), numbers of seizures scored as stage 5].\n\nHistology\nMice were euthanized on day 21 p.i. and perfused with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Brains were harvested, divided into 5 coronal slabs, embedded in paraffin and cut into 4 \u03bcm thick tissue sections. Paraffin sections were stained with Luxol fast blue and analyzed for neuron loss in the hippocampus as previously described (\nKirkman et al, 2010\n). Slides were examined in a blinded fashion using one slide, containing sections from all 5 coronal slabs, per brain (N = 14 to 20 brains per experimental group for antagonist-treated mice and 55 brains per experimental group for PBS-treated mice). The tissue section of only 1 of the 5 coronal slabs per slide contained the hippocampal region of the brain. The extent of neuron loss in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus from CA1 to CA3 was given a graded score as follows: score 0, no damage; score 1, 10\u201329% cell loss; score 2, 30\u201359% cell loss; and score 3, >60% cell loss. A score was given for each of the two hippocampi present in a brain and then the scores were summed so the highest possible score for neuron cell loss per brain could be 6 (the highest score, 3, for two regions of the brain).\nViral antigen positive cells were detected on consecutive paraffin sections using TMEV hyperimmune rabbit serum, as previously described (\nTsunoda et al, 2001\n;\nZurbriggen and Fujinami, 1989\n). Astrocytes were detected on paraffin sections using glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA), as previously described (\nKirkman et al, 2010\n). The slides were labeled using the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex technique with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma) in 0.01% hydrogen peroxide (Sigma) in PBS. Enumeration of viral antigen positive cells was performed in a blinded fashion with a light microscope using one slide per brain and evaluating the tissue section containing the hippocampal region (N = 15 to 20 brains per experimental group for antagonist-treated mice and 55 brains per experimental group for PBS-treated mice). Viral antigen positive cells were enumerated and summed from each of the two hippocampi present in a brain and each of the two dentate gyri present in a brain. The extent of gliosis was semi-quantified by scoring GFAP\n+\nactivated astrocytes in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus in a blinded fashion using one slide per brain (N = 14 to 20 brains per experimental group for antagonist-treated mice and 54 brains per experimental group for PBS-treated mice). Activated astrocytes have larger cell bodies, fatter processes, and stain more intensely for GFAP than quiescent astrocytes. Gliosis was given a graded score as follows: score 0, \u226450 activated astrocytes present; score 0.5, 51\u2013168 activated astrocytes; score 1, 169\u2013285 activated astrocytes; score 1.5, 286\u2013402 activated astrocytes; score 2, 403\u2013519 activated astrocytes; score 2.5, 520\u2013636 activated astrocytes; and score 3, \u2265637 activated astrocytes present (\nKirkman et al, 2010\n). A score was given for each of the two hippocampi present in a brain and each of the two dentate gyri present in a brain and then the scores were summed so the highest possible score for gliosis per brain could be 12 (the highest score, 3, for four regions of the brain).\n\nRicinus communis agglutinin (RCA)-1 lectin histochemistry\nActivated microglia and macrophages were identified by biotinylated RCA-1 (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) as previously described (\nSuzuki et al, 1988\n;\nTsunoda et al, 1996\n,\n2003\n,\n2007\n). One slide per brain, with 13 to 20 brains per experimental group for antagonist-treated mice and 55 brains per experimental group for PBS-treated mice, was examined in a blinded fashion. RCA-1\n+\ncells in each of the two hippocampi present in a brain and each of the two dentate gyri present in a brain were enumerated and summed.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe program StatView (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for most statistical analyses performed. The Student\u2019s\nt\ntest was performed for pairwise comparisons (observed seizures per mouse, cumulative seizure score per mouse, weights). Analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed were indicated by the Fisher\u2019s Protected Least Significant Difference (Fisher\u2019s PLSD) post hoc test, was performed to determine group differences for continuous data (RCA-1). The chi-square test was utilized for nominal data (seizures: yes or no; mortality: live or dead; stage 5 seizure: yes or no; seizure score maximums: yes or no). Finally, the unpaired two group Mann-Whitney U test was performed for all nonparametric analyses (neuronal cell loss and gliosis)."

    "Methods": "2.1. Cloning and virus construction\nStat3WT and Stat3CA mutants were fused to VP16 at the N-terminus to make VP16-Stat3WT and VP16-Stat3CA. VP64 was fused to the N-terminus of Stat3CA. All Stat3 mutants were cloned with a 3\u00d7 flag tag on the N-terminus of either Stat3 or VP16 with a CMV promoter followed by a beta-globin intron in the pAAV-MCS plasmid (Stratagene). Viral particles for RGC transduction were produced by the Miami Project Viral Vector Core in AAV2 capsid plasmids using FPLC purification to achieve titers of 2.7\u20133 \u00d7 10\n12\ngenome copies/mL.\n\n2.2. Neuronal cell culture\nCortices were dissected from postnatal day 3 (PN3) rat pups (Sprague\u2013Dawley; Charles River) in order to isolate primary cortical neurons for transfection as previously described (\nBlackmore et al., 2010\n). Briefly, neurons were dissociated and sequentially digested in 20 U/mL papain (Worthington) followed by 2.5% trypsin (GIBCO). 150,000 cells were electroporated with 1 \u00b5g of DNA using the AMAXA Nucleofector Technology (Program: Neurons, High Viability). Each of the plasmids was individually electroporated into freshly isolated primary cortical neurons, yielding transfection efficiencies of approximately 60%. Cells were cultured in 12-well Falcon plates (Catalog #353043) coated with 0.5 mg/mL poly-\nd\n-lysine (Sigma Aldrich; Catalog #P6407), in Proneural Growth Medium supplemented with PNGM SingleQuots (LONZA; Catalog #CC4461) conditioned overnight in cultured P5 rat glia. Cortical cultures were maintained at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\nfor 2 days.\n\n2.3. Neurite outgrowth assays\nCells were fixed 2DIV in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich) and immunostained first with antibodies to neuronal specific beta-III tubulin (rabbit; 1:2000; Abcam; ab18207) and flag tag (mouse; 1:750; Sigma-Aldrich; F1804) followed by AlexaFluor 488 (anti-rabbit) and 546 (anti-mouse) secondary antibodies. Images were captured using a Cellomics ArrayScanVTI automated microscope and neuronal morphology was assessed with the Neuronal Profiling algorithm (ThermoFisher). The total neurite length (NTL) and length of longest neurite (LOLN) were computed for each transfected neuron. For each experiment we measured a minimum of 100 neurons with three technical replicates per condition; 5 independent biological replicates were performed. Neurite outgrowth was normalized to controls transfected with a plasmid expressing the fluorescent protein mCherry. Cell survival was determined by quantifying cells in each condition with at least one neurite and a minimum NTL of 10 \u00b5M, normalized to control. One control replicate was set to 100% and the other controls were normalized to the replicate.\n\n2.4. RNA isolation and qPCR\nRNA was isolated from approximately 1 \u00d7 10\n6\nP3 rat cortical neurons transfected with mCherry, Stat3CA, or VP16-Stat3CA (Qiagen). Isolated RNA was reverse transcribed (iScript; Bio-Rad) to obtain 1 \u00b5g of DNA, and quantitative-PCR reactions (Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix; Applied Biosciences) were run on a 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosciences) with primers for Stat3, ATF3, Sprr1a, and GAPDH (\nTable S1\n). Each condition was run in three biological replicates as well as a no template control. Relative expression for each gene in each sample was calculated using the 2\n\u2212\u0394Cq\nmethod to reference gene GAPDH (\nSchmittgen and Livak, 2008\n).\n\n2.5. Optic nerve experiments\nIntravitreal injections were performed on 4\u20136 week old female C57BL/6 mice using a glass micropipette inserted in the peripheral retina, avoiding the lens. This method was used to deliver 2 \u00b5L of either AAV2 treatment (14 days and 7 days before injury) or cholera toxin B (CTB; 12 days post-injury). Optic nerve injury was performed by intraorbitally exposing the left optic nerve, which was crushed with Dumont #5 forceps (Roboz) for 10 s approximately 1 mm from the optic disc. CTB-Alexa 555 was injected 2 days before euthanasia as an anterograde tracer to visualize regenerating axons (2 \u00b5g/\u00b5L; Invitrogen). At 2 WPI, mice were euthanized and transcardially perfused and the optic nerve was dissected, post-fixed in 4% PFA in PBS overnight and cryoprotected with 30% sucrose. The tissue was embedded in OCT and sectioned at 12 \u00b5m. Regenerating axons were identified by CTB tracing and were counted at various distances from the site of injury (200 \u00b5m, 500 \u00b5m, 100 \u00b5m, and 1500 \u00b5m). At least four sections were counted at each distance for each animal (6 animals per condition). For RGC survival quantification, Neuron-specific tubulin+ RGCs in the injured and contralateral uninjured retinas were manually counted. For each flat-mounted retina, 10 fields of the central, intermediate, and peripheral regions were imaged. The percentage quantification is based on the average RGC count in the injured normalized to the uninjured contralateral retina. Quantification of regeneration and cell survival was performed by an investigator blinded to the treatment groups."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animal housing\nAdult male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (250\u2013300 g) were obtained from Charles River (St-Constant, Qc, Canada), and were let habituate for 72 h after delivery before the implantation of depth EEG recording electrodes. These animals were housed in controlled conditions, at 22 (\u00b12) \u00b0C and under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle (lights on from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.) with food and water\nad libitum\n. All experimental procedures were approved by the Canadian Council of Animal Care and all efforts were made to minimize suffering and the number of animals used.\n\n2.2. Surgery for the implantation of electrodes\nA total of 13 animals underwent surgery for the implantation of depth EEG recording electrodes before 4AP treatment. Before surgery, rats received topical Lidocaine (5%; Odan, Canada) in the areas that underwent surgical intervention. They were then anesthetized with isoflurane (3%) in 100% O\n2\nand positioned in a stereotaxic frame. An incision was then made in the skin to expose the skull plate, from bregma to lambda. Four stainless steel screws (2.4 mm length) were fixed to the skull and 3 small holes were drilled to allow the implantation of bipolar recording electrodes (20\u201330 k\u03a9; 5\u201310 mm length; distance between exposed tips: 500 \u03bcm) (MS303/2-B/spc, Plastics One, VA, USA). Electrodes were implanted in all animals in the CA3 region of the right hippocampus (AP: \u22124.3, ML: +4, DV: \u22127.8) and in the right entorhinal cortex (EC) (AP: \u22128.6, ML: +5.2, DV: \u22126.8) (\nPaxinos and Watson, 1998\n). A third bipolar electrode was placed under the frontal bone, after the removal of insulating material, and it was used as reference. During surgery, animals received a preventive antibiotic therapy (Enrofloxacine, 10 mg/kg, s.c.). After surgery, rats were injected with Ketoprofen (5 mg/kg, s.c. Merial, Canada), Buprenorphine (0.01\u20130.05 mg/kg, s.c., repeated every 12 h; CDMV, Canada) and 2 ml of 0.9% sterile saline (s.c.) repeated every 12 h if necessary.\n\n2.3. EEG recording\nTwo days after surgery, rats were placed in custom-made Plexiglas boxes (30 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 40 cm) and provided with food and water\nad libitum.\nElectrodes were then connected to multichannel cables and swivels. EEGs were amplified using an interface kit (Mobile 36 chlTMPro Amp, Stellate), low-pass filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 2 kHz per channel. On the day of injection, animals were given 4AP (4\u20135 mg/kg, i.p.) in order to induce acute seizures (\nL\u00e9vesque et al., 2013\n;\nSalami et al., 2015\n). EEG-video monitoring was performed using the Stellate system for at least 30 min before and 4 h following the injection of 4AP (\nL\u00e9vesque et al., 2013\n).\n\n2.4. Seizure detection and classification\nEEG recordings were visually analyzed for the detection of seizures. We identified in each animal the first seizure that occurred after 4AP injection and determined whether it remained isolated or it progressed to a condition characterized by repeated seizures thus replicating the SE condition. We then extracted time periods corresponding to 500 s before the onset and to 300 s after the end of each seizure. A time period of 300 s was selected in order to avoid the onset of a second seizure in the SE group. On average, the first seizure was followed by a second seizure 1012 (\u00b1398) s after. Data were exported to Matlab 7.11.0 (R2010b) (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) and were analyzed offline using custom-built routines.\n\n2.5. High-frequency oscillation analysis\nIn order to study the temporal evolution of HFOs over time, rates of HFOs (number of HFOs per bin) were first calculated for each seizure. The distribution of ripples and fast ripples during the ictal and post-ictal periods was then averaged for both groups. The ictal period was normalized into a 100 bins to account for differences in seizure duration and for easier comparison. The average rate of ripples and fast ripples was normalized according to the duration of the seizure to account for differences in seizure duration.\nIn order to detect HFOs, raw EEG recordings were first band-pass filtered in the 80\u2013200 Hz and in the 250\u2013500 Hz frequency range using a finite impulse response filter; zero-phase digital filtering was used to avoid phase distortion. Filtered EEGs from each region were then normalized using a 10 s reference period selected from 510 s to 500 s before the onset of the seizure. To be considered as an HFO candidate, oscillatory events in each frequency band had to show at least four consecutive cycles having amplitude of 3 SD above the mean of the reference period. The time lag between two consecutive cycles had to be between 5 and 12.5 ms for ripples and between 2 and 4 ms for fast ripples. Ripples and fast ripples occurring at the same time (overlapping events) were removed from analysis to avoid the effect of sharp events (\nB\u00e9nar et al., 2010\n;\nL\u00e9vesque et al., 2012\n;\nSalami et al., 2012\n).\n\n2.6. Statistical analysis\nIn order to compare the rates of occurrence of ripples and fast ripples in each region during the pre-ictal, ictal and post-ictal periods, we arbitrarily divided each period in three equal parts. We then compared the rate of occurrence of ripples and fast ripples using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests followed by Bonferroni\u2013Holm corrections to correct for multiple comparisons. By using this procedure, we determined if ripples or fast ripples predominated at different time periods during the pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal periods. Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests were used to compare the rate of occurrence of spikes during the pre-ictal period between regions and between groups. The level of significance was set to p < 0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nSix-to-eight week old (28-32 g) male CD-1 (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) or FVB-TgN(GadGFP)45704Swn (i.e. GIN) mice (The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME), which express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) in the somatostatin-positive subset of cortical GABAergic neurons (\nOliva et al., 2000\n), were housed in the University of Kentucky vivarium on a 14 hr light/10 hr dark cycle. Mice were housed for a minimum of 7 days prior to experimentation and food and water was provided\nad libitum\n. All procedures were approved by the University of Kentucky Animal Care and Use Committee and adhered to the NIH guidelines for the care and use of animals.\n\nTraumatic Brain Injury\nMice were subjected to severe unilateral, cortical contusion injury by controlled cortical impact (CCI), as previously described (\nHunt et al., 2012\n;\nHunt et al., 2009\n,\n2010\n,\n2011\n). Briefly, mice were anesthetized by 2% isoflourane inhalation and placed in a stereotaxic frame. The skull was exposed by midline incision, and a \u223c5 mm diameter craniotomy was made lateral to the sagittal suture and centered between bregma and lambda. The skull cap was removed without damage to the exposed underlying dura. The contusion device consisted of a computer-controlled, pneumatically driven impactor fitted with a beveled stainless-steel tip 3 mm in diameter (TBI-0310; Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Fairfax, VA). Brain injury was delivered using this device to compress the cortex to a depth of 1.0 mm (hard stop) at a velocity of 3.5 m/sec and 500 msec duration. A qualitative postoperative health assessment was performed daily for 4 days after CCI and periodically thereafter.\n\nRapamycin/ Vehicle injection\nRapamycin (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) was initially dissolved in 100% ethanol (20 mg/ml), stored at -20 \u00b0C, and diluted in a vehicle solution containing 5% Tween 80, 5% PEG 400, and 4% ethanol in double distilled H\n2\nO immediately before injection, as described previously (\nButler et al., 2015\n;\nGuo et al., 2013\n;\nHeng et al., 2013\n). Rapamycin (3 mg/kg) or vehicle solution was injected after mice regained consciousness following CCI injury (\u223c20-30 minutes after injury) and continued once daily until the mouse was used for experimentation. All other chemicals were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA) unless otherwise indicated.\n\nWestern blot\nWestern blot was performed with modifications as described previously (\nHalmos et al., 2015\n). Protein lysates were generated from whole hippocampi using a lysis buffer containing: 2 ml 10\u00d7 Ripa Lysis Buffer (20-188, Millipore), 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, 80 \u03bcL of protease inhibitor (P8340, Sigma), 80 \u03bcL of phosphatase inhibitor (P5726, Sigma) diluted in ddH2O (total volume: 20 ml). The Lowry assay was used to determine protein concentration. Extracted protein (30 \u03bcg) was loaded into 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and run for 1.5 hrs at 155 V and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 2 hours using Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against ribosomal S6 phosphorylated at serine 235 (anti-pS6; 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), or \u03b2-actin (1:5000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) overnight at 4\u00b0C in 50% Odyssey Blocking buffer and 50% TBS. Membranes were rinsed 5 times and then incubated with 700 IR goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:10000; Rockland, Limerick, PA). Membranes were rinsed 5 times and imaged using a LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (model 9120, LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Protein bands were quantified using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MA).\n\neGFP+ Hilar Cell Density Measurements\n72 hours after injury, GIN mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation to effect (lack of tail pinch response) and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH=7.4) while anesthetized. Brains were then removed and placed in fixative overnight, equilibrated in 30% sucrose for 48 hours, and sectioned at 30 \u03bcm on a cryostat (-22\u00b0C). 1-in-6 serial section series (180 \u03bcm between mounted sections) containing the hippocampus were mounted in Vectashield with DAPI counterstain (Vector Labs; Burlingame, CA) and images were taken on a Zeiss 5 Live confocal microscope (Zeiss; Oberkochen, Germany). Hilar area was measured using ImageJ software to trace along the inner surface of the upper and lower blades of the dentate gyrus and in a line from the tip of each blade of the dentate gyrus to the proximal most point of CA3 pyramidal cell layer. Cell counts from each section were divided by this hilar area measure to give enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) cell density measures for each section. On average, 15 serial sections were taken from each animal and cell density measurements were then averaged for each animal, divided into dorsal, medial, and ventral thirds of hippocampus. Each area covered \u223c900 \u03bcm. The investigator was blinded to animal treatment for all cell counts.\n\nSlice Preparation\nMice were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and decapitated while anesthetized. The brain was removed and placed in ice-cold (2-4\u00b0C) oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing in mM: 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.3 CaCl\n2\n, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 1.3 MgCl\n2\n, 11 glucose and 1.4 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\nequilibrated with 95% O\n2\n-5% CO\n2\n(pH 7.2-7.4). ACSF always contained the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist, kynurenic acid (1 mM; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Brains were blocked, glued to a sectioning stage, and slices (350 \u03bcm) were cut in the coronal plane into cold, oxygenated ACSF using a vibrating microtome (Vibratome Series 1000; Technical Products International, St. Louis, MO). The hippocampus was then isolated from surrounding tissue, making sure to completely remove the entorhinal cortex. Slices were transferred to a storage chamber containing oxygenated ACSF at 32-34\u00b0C. Slices of the dorsal hippocampus from the hemispheres ipsilateral and contralateral to CCI injury were used in these experiments and compared to comparable slices from sham-injured mice (i.e., craniotomy, but no impact injury). Both the hemisphere and dorsal-to-ventral location of each slice was documented; recordings were performed in the dorsal half of the hippocampus (coronal sections), corresponding to areas demonstrating the most cellular changes in previous reports (\nButler et al., 2015\n;\nHunt et al., 2012\n;\nHunt et al., 2009\n).\n\nWhole cell recordings\nCoronal hippocampal slices containing the dorsal third of the dentate gyrus were transferred to a recording chamber on an upright, fixed-stage microscope equipped with infrared, differential interference contrast optics (i.e., IR-DIC; Olympus BX50WI), where they were perfused with continuously warmed (32-34\u00b0C) ACSF. Recordings were performed from DGCs, which were identified using DIC imaging. Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (1.65 mm outer diameter, 0.45 mm inner diameter; King Precision Glass, Claremont, CA) with a P-87 puller (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). The intracellular solution contained (in mM): 140 Cs\n+\n-gluconate, 1 NaCl, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl\n2\n, 1 CaCl\n2\n, 3 CsOH, and 2 ATP; pH=7.15-7.3. Open tip series resistance was 2-5 M\u03a9. Recordings were obtained using an Axon Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), low-pass filtered at 6 kHz, digitized at 20 kHz with a 1322A Digidata (Molecular Devices), and acquired using pClamp 10.2 (Clampfit, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were voltage-clamped at 0 mV for 5-10 min to allow equilibration of pipette and intracellular solutions prior to data collection, after which time whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) were obtained. An initial 5 minute baseline recording period was followed by the addition of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridine-3-ol hydrochloride (THIP; gaboxadol; 3 \u03bcM; Sigma-Aldrich) to the ACSF, a super-agonist of GABA\nA\nR's containing \u03b4 subunits. At the concentration used here (3 \u03bcM), THIP selectively targets \u03b4 subunit-containing, putatively extrasynaptic GABA\nA\nRs that contribute to the tonic GABA current (\nBrown et al., 2002\n;\nEbert et al., 1994\n). THIP was applied for 10 minutes and followed by addition of bicuculline methiodide (30 \u03bcM; Tocris Bioscience; Minneapolis, MN) to the ACSF for 8 minutes to eliminate postsynaptic inhibitory currents and measure resting tonic current. Recordings exhibiting >25 M\u03a9 (mean= 13.53 \u00b10.62 M\u03a9, n=88) series resistance or in which series resistance changed by >20% were discarded.\n\nData and statistical analysis\nData analysis was performed using MiniAnalysis 6.0.3 (Synaptosoft; Decatur, GA) and Graphpad (La Jolla, CA) software programs. To measure sIPSC frequency, amplitude, and kinetics, a 3 minute sample of the baseline recording was used. Only events with three times the amplitude of root mean squared (RMS) baseline noise were included (RMS= 1.59 \u00b10.05, n=88). Events characterized by a typical fast rise phase and exponential decay were automatically detected and then manually verified in MiniAnalysis. Tonic current amplitude was detected by subtracting mean steady-state holding current values during baseline or during THIP application from mean steady-state holding current values in the presence of bicuculline methiodide, a competitive antagonist of GABA\nA\nR's. Tonic current amplitude values were normalized to whole cell capacitance (\nGlykys and Mody, 2007\n). For hilar interneuron counts, groups were compared using a Two Way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's\npost hoc\ntest at each septo-temporal hippocampal portion measured. For all electrophysiological data, groups were compared using a One Way ANOVA followed by Tukey's\npost hoc\ntest. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1SEM."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Research Foundation and conform to NIH guidelines for the care and use of animals. Two animal breeding schemes were followed: (1) In order to generate Gli1-CreER\nT2\n::GFP mice on a pure C57BL/6NCrl background for the study, hemizygous Gli1-CreER\nT2\nmice (\nAhn and Joyner, 2004\n,\n2005\n) on a C57BL/6NCrl background were crossed to homozygous CAG-CAT-EGFP (GFP) mice (\nNakamura et al., 2006\n) on a C57BL/6NCrl background (B6-GFP, n=77). (2) In order to generate Gli1-CreER\nT2\n::tdTomato positive mice on a 50:50 mix C57BL/6NCrl::FVB N background for the study, hemizygous Gli1-CreER\nT2\nmice on an FVB N background were crossed to mice heterozygous for a CAG promoter-driven red fluorescent protein (tdTomato) reporter construct (Jax; stock 007914) on a C57BL/6NCrl background (B6/FVB-Tomato, n=9). Gli1-CreER\nT2\n::tdTomato negative mice produced from this cross were also used (B6/FVB, n=5). All animals were analyzed for phosphorylated S6 protein (pS6), hilar ectopic dentate granule cell density, mossy fiber sprouting, mossy cell density, reactive astrocytosis and microgliosis. Basal dendrite frequency and granule cell hypertrophy were analyzed only in B6-GFP and B6/FVB-Tomato mice, because GFP or tdTomato expression is needed to visualize granule cell somas and dendrites. All animals were maintained as a colony in the vivarium at CCHMC. Animals were provided with food and water\nad libitum\nwith a 14/10 hour light/dark cycle to optimize breeding (\nFox et al., 2006\n).\nPostnatal tamoxifen treatment of Gli1-CreER\nT2\nmice activates CreER\nT2\nin granule cell progenitors (\nAhn and Joyner, 2005\n), resulting in continuous expression of GFP or tdTomato in the progenitor cells and subsequent daughter cells in B6-GFP and B6/FVB-Tomato mice. All mice were given injections of tamoxifen (250 mg/kg, s.c.) at 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 weeks of age, limiting labeling to granule cells born after three weeks of age. At eight weeks of age, mice received methyl scopolamine nitrate in sterile saline (1 mg/kg, s.c.) followed by pilocarpine (420 mg/kg, s.c.) ten minutes later. Animals were monitored for behavioral seizures and the onset of status epilepticus (SE). Following three hours of SE mice were given two injections of diazepam ten minutes apart (10 mg/kg, s.c.) to alleviate seizure activity. Mice were given sterile Ringers as needed to maintain pretreatment body weight. Animals not designated to undergo SE received saline instead of pilocarpine, but were given scopolamine and diazepam. Rapamycin (LC Laboratories) was dissolved in 5% Tween 80, 5% polyethyleneglycol and 4% ethanol in PBS and was administered daily (6 mg/kg, i.p; or vehicle control) for six weeks beginning one day after pilocarpine SE. The final treatment groups were: (1) SE+rapamycin, (2) SE+vehicle, (3) rapamycin only and (4) vehicle only. At 14 weeks of age mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused with 1U/ml heparin, 2.5% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in PBS (pH 7.4). Brains were extracted, stored overnight at 4\u00b0C in the same fixative, cryoprotected in ascending sucrose series (10, 20, 30%) in PBS and snap-frozen in isopentane at \u221225\u00b0C. Brains were sectioned coronally at 60 \u00b5m, and sections were affixed to gelatin coated slides and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nSlide mounted brain sections (two per slide) from dorsal hippocampus were processed for histological studies. Sections were immunostained with the following antibodies: rabbit anti-pS6 (1:500, Cell Signaling), chicken anti-GFP (1:500, Abcam, Boston, MA), rabbit anti-zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) (1:3000, Synaptic Systems, Gottingen, Germany), rabbit anti-Glutamate receptor 2/3 (1:100, Millipore, Temecula, CA), rabbit anti-prox1 (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), rabbit anti-GFAP (1:500, Millipore) and rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:1000, Synaptic Systems). AlexaFluor488 goat anti-chicken, AlexaFluor488 goat anti-rabbit, AlexaFluor594 goat anti-rabbit and AlexaFluor647 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were used (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR). Sections were dehydrated in alcohols, cleared in xylenes and coverslips were attached with Krystalon mounting-media (Harleco, Darmstadt, Germany).\n\nConfocal imaging and quantification of histological measures\nImaging for pS6, hilar basal dendrites, mossy fiber sprouting, dentate granule cell soma area and mossy cell density analyses was conducted using a Leica SP5 confocal system set up on a DMI 6000 inverted microscope equipped with a 63\u00d7 oil immersion objective (NA 1.4; image size 240 \u00d7 240 \u00b5m in the XY plane). Images for hilar ectopic dentate granule cell density were generated using a 3024 Nikon A1Rsi inverted microscope with a 40\u00d7 water objective (NA 1.15, image size 317 \u00d7 317 \u00b5m in the XY plane). Images for analyses of reactive astrocytosis and microgliosis were generated using the 3024 Nikon A1Rsi microscope with a 60\u00d7 water objective (NA 1.27, image size 210 \u00d7 210 um in the XY plane). For measures analyzing immunohistochemical staining intensity, including dentate and cortical pS6 expression, images were all collected with identical parameters. For soma areas, cell density measures and measures of cellular and neuronal process, image collection parameters were set to optimize cellular detail. For these latter measures, accurately identifying the boundaries of cellular structures is critical, so image setting were adjusted to avoid \u201cover or underexposure\u201d; conditions which can artifactually increase or decrease structure size, respectively. Images were collected and analyzed by an investigator blind to treatment group to avoid bias. For each parameter, dentate gyri were analyzed from dorsal hippocampus (1.6\u20132.0 mm posterior to bregma;\nPaxinos and Franklin, 2001\n). All cell counts were conducted using a variation of the optical dissector method (\nHowell et al., 2002\n;\nHofacer et al., 2013\n).\n1) Phosphorylated S6 protein (pS6)\nTo quantify pS6 immunostaining, single confocal optical sections were collected from the midpoint of the upper blade of the dentate gyrus and parietal association cortex. Images were taken 3 \u00b5m below the surface of the tissue section for all samples to control for antibody penetration. Tissue sections were imaged using 633 nm light with 10.0% laser intensity with the argon lamp set to 25.0%. For all images the PMT gain was set to 1200, PMT offset was set to \u221218.0, and pinhole was set to 95.2 \u00b5m. Images were all collected with 2048 \u00d7 2048 voxels at 200 Hz. Optical sections were analyzed for average pixel intensity within the upper blade of the granule cell body layer of the hippocampus using LAS AF software (Leica Microsystems). Average pixel intensity was measured on a scale of 0\u2013255, with 0 indicating no pS6 staining, and 255 indicating complete saturation.\n2) Dentate granule cell mossy fiber axon sprouting\nGranule cell mossy fiber sprouting was evaluated using ZnT3-labeling. Single confocal optical sections were collected at the midpoint of the upper and lower blades of the dentate gyrus to capture portions of the dentate inner molecular layer. Optical sections were taken 3 \u00b5m below the surface of the tissue for all samples. The area occupied by ZnT3-immunoreactive puncta within the dentate inner molecular layer was quantified using Neurolucida automated detection software (version 3.4.2). Puncta were defined as ZnT3-immunoreactive regions with a diameter greater than 0.5 \u00b5m. The degree of mossy fiber sprouting was defined as [(total area occupied by ZnT3 puncta/total inner molecular layer area) \u00d7 100].\n3) Hilar ectopic dentate granule cells\nThe density of ectopic granule cells in the hilus was assessed from confocal z-series image stacks of sections immunostained with the granule cell marker Prox1 (1 \u00b5m step through the top 10 \u00b5m of tissue). Prox1-immunolabeled cells were considered ectopic if they were in the hilus and at least two cell body diameters [~20\u00b5m] from the granule cell layer/hilar border. One hippocampal section for each animal was analyzed to determine hilar ectopic granule cell density [Prox1-expressing hilar granule cells/mm\n3\nof hilus].\n4) Dentate granule cells with basal dendrites\nTo assess basal dendrite frequency, confocal z-series image stacks of GFP or tdTomato labeled granule cells were collected (1 \u00b5m step through the top 10 \u00b5m of the tissue). One dentate gyrus/animal from dorsal hippocampus was imaged. Image stacks were imported into Neurolucida software, and cells were scored for the presence of basal dendrites projecting into the dentate hilus. Inclusion criteria for granule cells with basal dendrites were as follows: 1; Granule cells were morphologically mature, defined as cells with an axon extending into the hilus and spiny apical dendrites extending to the hippocampal fissure, 2; Cell bodies were fully contained within the tissue section, 3; Cell bodies were located within the granule cell layer and 4; Cells were well-labeled with GFP or tdTomato, such that processes could be followed to their natural endings. Data are presented as percentages (number of granule cells with basal dendrites/total number of granule cells scored).\n5) Reactive astrocytosis and microgliosis\nChanges in astrocytes and microglia were assessed by measuring the soma areas and total volume of GFAP- and Iba1-expressing cells located in the hilus. Image stacks were collected from within the dentate hilus (0.25 \u00b5m step through the top 5 \u00b5m of tissue). To measure soma areas, stacks were imported into Neurolucida software for measuring the maximum profile area of each respective cell type. Only cells whose somas were completely contained within the image stack were used. A total of five astrocytes and five microglia per animal were chosen at random for analysis. Soma areas presented for each animal are averages. To estimate total hilar volume occupied by astrocytes and microglia, 2 \u00b5m and 4 \u00b5m stacks (for GFAP- and Iba1-stained tissue, respectively) were imported into Imaris software. Stack size was determined so that the greatest number of sections with optimal antibody penetration for all brain preparations was used. Surfaces with a staining intensity of at least 4\u00d7 local background with a minimum detail level of 0.414 \u00b5m were automatically identified. Surfaces were added and removed manually following the automatic detection. Total volume occupied by the surfaces was determined and data is represented as [(total volume GFAP- or Iba1-stained regions/total volume of hilus) \u00d7 100].\n6) Dentate granule cell soma area\nChanges in granule cell soma area were assessed by measuring the maximum profile area of GFP- or tdTomato-expressing adult-born granule cells. Image stacks used to analyses the presence of basal dendrites on GFP or tdTomato expressing cells were also used to determine dentate granule cell soma area. Measurements were completed using Neurolucida software. Granule cells with partially visible cell bodies were excluded (i.e. cut at the tissue surface or edge). Five granule cells per animal were chosen at random for analysis. For each animal, soma areas were averaged for statistical analysis.\n7) Loss of hilar mossy cells\nThe density of mossy cells in the hilus was determined from confocal image stacks using GluR2/3-labeling (1 \u00b5m step through the top 10 \u00b5m of the tissue). Images were collected from the center of the hilus. Small, hilar GluR2/3-immunoreactive cells (8\u201312 \u00b5m diameter) were considered to be ectopic granule cells and were excluded, while larger GluR2/3-expressing neurons (30\u201340 \u00b5m diameter) localized to the hilus were counted as mossy cells (\nFujise and Kosaka, 1999\n;\nJiao and Nadler, 2007\n;\nScharfman and Myers, 2013\n). Mossy cell hilar density is presented as [GluR2/3-expressing hilar mossy cells/mm\n3\nof hilus].\n\nStatistics\nStatistical analyses were performed using Sigma Stat software (version 13.0). No differences were found between male and female animals, so data were pooled for further analysis (pilocarpine/rapamycin (n=4M, 2F), pilocarpine/vehicle (n=3M, 4F), saline/rapamycin (n=3M, 5F), saline/vehicle (n=3M, 4F). To account for differences between mouse strains, a two-way ANOVA was employed for each measure, controlling for strain (pure C57BL/6NCrl background vs. 50:50 mix C57BL/6NCrl::FVB N background) and treatment. Data that failed tests of normality or equal variance were normalized using either square root or rank transformations. Pairwise multiple comparison procedures were conducted using the Holm-Sidak method. Values are presented as least square means of raw (non-transformed) data \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM).\n\nFigure preparation\nFigures were prepared using Microsoft Excel and Adobe Photoshop (CS5-Extended). Brightness and contrast were adjusted to optimize cellular detail. Identical adjustments were made to all images meant for comparison. All error bars in graphs are SEM."

    "Methods": "Animal Studies\nAll animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the IACUC committee at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System (Palo Alto, CA, USA) and were consistent with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering, to reduce the number of animals used, and to utilize alternatives to\nin vivo\ntechniques, if available.\n\nExperimental Groups and DHF treatment\nTwo month old male C57BL/6J mice were sham-irradiated or received 5 Gy of cranial irradiation using a Mark I Cesium Irradiator (JL Shepherd, San Fernando, CA, USA) as described previously (\nCorniola et al. 2012\n,\nZou et al. 2012\n). The dose rate was approximately 58.8 cGy/min. One week after irradiation, 5 mg/kg DHF was administered daily by subcutaneous (SQ) injection for three weeks. For TrkB pathway immunoblotting, DHF was administered for 10 days. DHF was initially dissolved in DMSO and then diluted in PBS to achieve a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The final DMSO concentration was approximately 17%. Accordingly, vehicle control mice received daily SQ injection of 17% DMSO prepared in PBS. DHF was either synthesized by Dr. Keqiang Ye (Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA) or purchased from Santa Cruz biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).\n\nBehavioral studies\nBehavioral studies were performed four weeks after the completion of DHF treatment. Mice (n=12 per group) were tested sequentially in open field, Y maze, elevated zero maze, and fear conditioning. Approximately five weeks after the completion of contextual fear conditioning, the same groups of mice were tested again in open field, Y maze, and fear conditioning. Barnes maze was then used to investigate spatial learning. One week after the completion of Barnes maze, half of each cohort (n=6) was exposed to a novel environment for 5 minutes and sacrificed 90 minutes later to examine activation of the immediate early gene c-Fos. The remaining population (n=6 each) of each cohort served as cage controls and were sacrificed on the same day. Unless stated differently, all arenas were cleaned with 70% ethanol between each trial and test subject. All behavioral studies were recorded and analyzed by TopScan or FreezeScan (CleverSys Inc., Reston, VA, USA). Behavioral test procedures are explained in greater detail in\nSupplementary Material\n.\n\nHippocampal neurogenesis\nA separate set of mice were used for hippocampal neurogenesis studies. At the completion of DHF treatment, half of each cohort (n=6 each) was subjected to daily bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 mg/kg, IP) injection for five consecutive days and sacrificed four weeks after the first BrdU injection. The other half (n=6 each) was injected with two doses of BrdU, eight hours apart, and sacrificed for tissue collection the next day. BrdU was incorporated by replicating cells, and the long washout period in the long-term study allowed for identification of newborn cells with the capacity for long-term survival, while the short turnaround time in the short-term study allowed for examination of progenitor cell proliferation during the period of BrdU administration.\n\nImmunohistochemical staining, imaging, and analysis\nBrain tissues used for immunohistochemical analyses were processed and analyzed as described (\nCorniola et al. 2012\n,\nZou et al. 2012\n). Antibodies used are listed in\nTable 1\n. The systemic random sampling principal was applied as described (\nCorniola et al. 2012\n,\nZou et al. 2012\n) to estimate total number of newborn neurons in hippocampal formation. One in every 6th sections was used for BrdU staining for the estimation of total newborn cells; one in every 12th sections was used for doublecortin (Dcx) or triple (BrdU/NeuN/GFAP) staining for the estimation of total numbers of immature neurons or assessment of differentiation of newborn cells, respectively.\nTable 1.
