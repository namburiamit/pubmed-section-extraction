    "Methods": "All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Missouri. Male C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks old) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). All animals were allowed to recover within the animal care facility for 7 days upon arrival. Animals were housed in a controlled environment with 12 h light\u2013dark cycles (07.00 h\u201319.00 h) at constant temperature (24 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C) withad libitumaccess to food (normal chow) and water. At the end of the experimental period, mice were euthanized using carbon dioxide (1\u20132 min) followed by cervical dislocation.\n\nIntermittent hypoxia\nThe IH exposure protocol used has been described in detail previously (\nGozal et al., 2017\n). Briefly, room air (RA) mice were housed in standard housing conditions, and intermittent hypoxia (IH) mice were exposed to IH for 6 weeks. IH consisted of exposures alternating 21%\nF\nIO2\nand 6.1%\nF\nIO2\n, 20 cycles h\n\u22121\nfor 12 h day\n\u22121\nduring daylight (07:00 h \u2013 19:00 h) using a commercially available system (80 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 50 cm; Oxycycler A44XO, BioSpherix, Redfield, NY, USA). These exposures recapitulate nadir oxyhemoglobin saturations in the range of 68\u201375%, which are the dominant correlate of moderate to severe OSA in humans (\nR. Farr\u00e9 et al., 2018\n). The rest of the day (19.00 h\u201307.00 h), the mice were in normoxic conditions (21%\nF\nIO2\n).\n\nFecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) in Na\u00efve Mice\nFecal samples from mice exposed to RA or IH were collected, and FMT was performed by oral gavage of a fecal slurry into na\u00efve mice (C57BL/6, Jackson Lab) as described (\nStebegg et al., 2019\n). Recipient lean mice were fasted for 2 hours prior to FMT, and the fecal slurry were obtained from fecal pellets of 5 donor mice suspended by vortexing in 1 mL PBS per 100 mg of feces. Fecal mixtures were centrifugated at 500g for 5 min and the supernatants were collected for FMT. Each recipient mouse received 100 \u03bcl of fecal slurry by oral gavage twice/week for 3 weeks in both groups: i) FMT-RA and ii) FMT-IH. At the end of this period, fecal samples were collected from recipient mice were collected for further analyses.\n\n16S rRNA Sequencing of gut microbiota\nFeces from FMT-RA and FMT-IH mice were processed using PowerFecal kits (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (\nPoroyko et al., 2016\n). Briefly, bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons were constructed via amplification of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene with universal primers (U515F/806R) previously developed against the V4 region, flanked by Illumina standard adapter sequences (\nCaporaso et al., 2011\n). The final amplicon pool was evaluated using the Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer automated electrophoresis system, quantified using quant-iT HS dsDNA reagent kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and diluted according to Illumina\u2019s standard protocol for sequencing on the MiSeq instrument (Ilumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Paired DNA sequences were merged using FLASH software (\nMago\u010d and Salzberg, 2011\n). Cutadapt (\nhttps://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt\n) was used to remove the primers at both ends of the contig and cull contigs that did not contain both primers. To assess the structure and integration of the microbial community, taxonomy was assigned to selected operating taxonomic units (OTUs) using BLAST against the SILVA database v128 of 16S rRNA sequences and taxonomy. OTUs where then used to calculate dissimilarity matrix for Principal Coordinate analysis (PCoA).\n\nSleep scoring\nSleep/wake activity was acquired and recorded using a piezoelectric monitoring system as described previously (\nDonohue et al., 2008\n). The system records pressure changes using a piezoelectric film, the duration and intensity of which are automatically scored by computer algorithms and classified as wake or sleep states. The system has been previously validated and exhibits 90% accuracy when compared to EEG/EMG-based sleep acquisition and scoring approaches (\nMang et al., 2014\n). Data collected were binned over 5 mins using a rolling average of percentage sleep, and by individual sleep bout length from which mean bout lengths were calculated. Sleep bouts were defined by any contiguous sleep pattern that remained uninterrupted by arousal periods of more than 30 s. In addition, bout length counts were only initiated when a 30-second interval contained greater than 50% sleep and were terminated when a 30-second interval contained less than 50% sleep (\nPaulose et al., 2019\n).\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor gut microbiome analysis, two-tailed\nP\nvalues were calculated for all pairwise multiple comparison procedures using the Student-Newman-Keuls test among groups. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 21.0 software for Windows (IBM, Armonk, NY). Multivariate statistical analyses such as PLS-DA, ANOVA, box plots, and volcano plots were performed with the MetaboAnalyst 3.0 program after data pre-treatments,\ni.e.\n, normalization to the sum, log transformation and Pareto scaling (\nhttp://www.metaboanalyst.ca/\n). Changes in metabolite abundances were considered statistically significant when their\np\nvalues were <0.05. Statistical significance of the obtained PLS-DA model was evaluated with a permutation test (permutation number: 1,000). The PLS-DA model was considered statistically significant if the permutation test\np\nvalue <0.05. Data was expressed as mean \u00b1 SD.\nFor sleep scoring, statistical analysis was performed using Prism 8 (GraphPad, San Diego, Ca, USA). Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and Sidak\npost-hoc\ntest, and unpaired\nt\n-test were used as appropriate. The data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. A\np\nvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal experiments were carried out in compliance with the protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Wildtype male mice aged 8\u201310 weeks were purchased (C57BL6/J male mice, Jackson Laboratory) and used for the evaluation of MCT1 expression in sciatic nerves and DRG after diabetes induction. Breeding colonies of heterozygous MCT1 null (Het MCT1-null) mice on a C57B16J background were maintained at the Johns Hopkins University (\nLee et al., 2012\n;\nLengacher et al., 2013\n;\nMorrison et al., 2015\n). Het MCT1-null mice were used since full knockout of MCT1 is embryonically lethal. Both male and female Het MCT1-null mice and control littermates (wild-type) aged 8\u201310 weeks were used. Het MCT1-null mice develop normally and show no neurological symptoms at this age (\nMorrison et al., 2015\n).\n\nDiabetes induction with or without insulin treatment\nAs described previously (\nLennertz et al., 2011\n;\nWang et al., 1993\n), type-1 diabetes was induced in age-matched Het MCT1-null mice and control littermates by an intraperitoneal injection of STZ (Sigma-Aldrich; 180 mg/kg body weight) in 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.5). Blood samples were collected from the tail vein three days following injection and then at regular intervals throughout experiment, and glycemia was determined with a OneTouch Ultra 2 glucometer (LifeScan Inc., Milpitas, CA). If hyperglycemia (blood glucose >300 g/dl) was not obtained after a single injection, a second STZ injection (180 mg/kg body weight if no effect and 90 mg/kg body weight if partial effect) was administered after one week. Mice with sustained hyperglycemia were used for diabetes experiments, while those unable to achieve sustained hyperglycemia were used as STZ control mice. 85% of STZ-injected mice survived up to the end of the study with no difference between genotypes.\nAs an additional control for direct STZ toxicity, a subset of mice who achieved hyperglycemia after STZ were treated with insulin, by subcutaneous implantation of LinBit insulin pellets (LinShin; Toronto Canada) under the mid dorsal skin, to normalize their blood sugars. The number of pellets used was dependent on body weight (1 pellet <15g, 2 pellets 15-24g, 3 pellets >24g). Following implantation, blood sugars were measured weekly to assure normoglycemia.\n\nRNA preparation and quantitative real-time RT-PCR\nDeeply anesthetized mice were transcardially perfused with 0.1 M PBS to remove the blood, and the sciatic nerves rapidly dissected. RNA was isolated by an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), reverse transcribed to cDNA with a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems), and quantified by real-time RT PCR using Taqman probes (Applied Biosystems) for MCT1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Catalog # 4351372) or GAPDH (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Catalog # 4352339E) on a StepOne Plus RT-PCR System (Applied Biosystems).\n\nNerve conduction studies\nElectrophysiologic recordings were performed to measure sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) from the tail nerve while maintaining tail temperature at 32\u201334\u00b0C (measured with the Digi-Sense Infrared Thermometer [Model 20250-05]), and compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) by using a Neurosoft-Evidence 3102evo electromyograph system (Schreiber & Tholen Medizintechnik, Stade, Germany) as described previously (\nJha et al., 2020\n;\nXia et al., 2010\n).\n\nBehavioral studies\nMechanical and thermal sensitivity was assessed by the frequency method using two calibrated von Frey monofilaments (low force, 0.07 g; high force, 0.45 g) and Hargreaves test, respectively, as described previously .\n\nHistologic analyses\nToluidine blue-stained sections were used for quantification of myelinated axon number and diameter, myelin thickness, or\ng\nratio, as described previously (\nJha et al., 2020\n). Analysis of footpads for intra-epidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) was measured by PGP9.5-immunoreactive nerve counts normalized to epidermal area, as previously described (\nJha et al., 2020\n).\n\nQuantification and statistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 8. The number of animals per group (\nn\n), statistical test used for comparison, and statistical significance were included in the figure legends. All data were presented as mean \u00b1\nSEM\n. Differences in the\np\nvalues of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. The investigators performing electrophysiologic recordings, behavioral assessments, and quantification of histology were blinded to genotypes throughout the study."

    "Methods": "All experiments were performed on male C57BL6 mice (Charles River Laboratories) in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Pennsylvania. For all survival procedures requiring anesthesia, anesthesia was induced with 3% isoflurane mixed with oxygen (100%, Air Gas, PA) and maintained with 1\u20132% of the same (the percentage of isoflurane was lowered to 2% immediately after the animal was under and subsequently lowered in decrements of 0.5% as the duration under increased). Depth of anesthesia was frequently gauged by the paw pinch test and the percentage of isoflurane was increased to a maximum of 2% if a reflex was observed. Animals were placed on a regulated heating pad throughout the surgical procedures and their eyes were lubricated to prevent corneal damage under anesthesia. Their weight and general health were monitored once a week throughout the study.\n\nVirus Injection\nAAV9.CamKII.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40 and AAV9.Syn.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40 were obtained from the Penn Vector Core. Mice were unilaterally injected in either their right (n=10) or left (n=9) dorsal CA1 (RC: 1.8\u20132.0 mm from bregma, ML: 1.4\u20131.6 mm from midline and DV: 1.3\u20131.4mm from the surface of the brain) with 1\u03bcl of either hSyn.GCaMP6f (4.75e\n12\nGC ml\n\u22121\n, n=3; 2.37e\n12\nGC ml\n\u22121\n, n=1 was used only for behavior control) or CamKII.GCaMP6f (1.14e\n13\nGC ml\n\u22121\n, n=8; 1.14e\n12\nGC ml\n\u22121\n, n=7). After induction of anesthesia, animals were placed on a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting Co., IL) and their heads fixed. The skin on their heads was cleaned with povidone-iodine solution (10%, Betadine\u00ae Solution) and isopropyl alcohol (70%) after which an incision was made in the middle. Bupivacaine hydrochloride (2 mg kg\n\u22121\n) was injected into the periosteum and the latter cleared with a cotton swab. Hydrogen peroxide (3%) was lightly dabbed on the sutures to better expose them. A small hole was carefully drilled with a burr (0.5mm tip diameter, Fine Science Tools Inc., CA) and the needle (26s/2\u201d/2, Hamilton Company, NV) was positioned at the aforementioned coordinates. The tissue was allowed to settle for 2 minutes before starting infusion (0.125\u03bcl min\n\u22121\n, Stoelting Co.). Two minutes after completion of infusion, the needle was slowly retracted over the course of 5\u201310 minutes and the skin sutured (5\u20130 dissolvable sutures, EMSCO Scientific Enterprises Inc., PA). Meloxicam (5 mg kg\n\u22121\n) was administered subcutaneously at the nape prior to the start of the procedure and one day after injection.\n\nPreparation of Hippocampal Window\nOne (n=17) or two (n=2) weeks after virus injection a stainless steel (1.3mm inner diameter, HTX-15R, Component Supply, TN) cannula sealed with a glass cover slip (0.13\u20130.17mm, Fisher Scientific, MA) at one end was inserted above the hippocampus as follows. Animals were first head fixed, their skulls exposed and cleared of overlying tissue as above. The skull was then thoroughly cleaned with hydrogen peroxide (30%, Sigma Aldrich) and the skin glued (Vetbond\nTM/MC\n, No. 1469 SB) along the circumference. A circular aperture centered at the injection site was slowly drilled into the skull with a trephine (1.8mm tip diameter, Fine Science Tools Inc.) and the brain exposed. The dura was removed, and the neo-cortex and external capsule were continuously flushed with sterile saline and gently aspirated as described(\nDombeck et al., 2010\n) to expose the underlying hippocampus. Bleeding was stemmed with Gelfoam\u00ae (Midwest Veterinary Supply, MN), subsequent to which the cannula was gently inserted into the saline filled aspirated cavity. Once positioned in place, Kwik-Sil\n\u2122\n(WPI, FL) was applied around it to hold it in place. Dental cement was then applied uniformly on the entire exposed skull to secure the cannula and provide a scaffold for the baseplate of a miniature microscope (iNSCOPIX, CA). Meloxicam (5 mg kg\n\u22121\n) was administered subcutaneously at the nape prior to the start and for two days after the procedure.\nBaseplates were cemented at least one, but typically four, days prior to the commencement of the study. The original camera base plate was customized to move both vertically and horizontally to ensure that the cells were always in focus (\nFigure 1a\n). Briefly, animals were placed on a sterotax under anasesthesia and their cannulas cleaned with distilled water. A GRIN lens, (1.0 mm diameter, iNSCOPIX) that serves as the relay lens between the glass cover slip of the cannula and the miniature microscope, was then inserted into the cannula. The lens was secured to the cannula to prevent displacement during imaging with silicone grease applied very lightly around its circumference halfway through its length. The baseplate was centered so that the complete field of view of the GRIN lens was visible through the camera and the assembly was then cemented to the cement scaffold with additional dental cement. Upon conclusion of the study, animals were deeply anaesthetized with pentobarbital (100 mg kg\n\u22121\n) and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were removed, and the location of the imaging window was confirmed.\n\nPrimary Blast Injury\nTo enable the collection of pre and post injury data in the same animal, mTBI was caused by blast overpressure to the head as described previously(\nBeamer et al., 2016\n). Briefly, animals were first deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane (3% for induction for 5\u2019 and 2% for maintenance for 3\u2019) and then placed on a holder outside the exit end of a shock-tube with their snouts facing the tube. Their torsos and extremities were protected from the shockwave by sorbothane-lined aluminum casing and their heads constrained from moving with a thin metal rod encircling the snout and a cervical collar positioned between the occiput and shoulders. A subset of animals (n=8; mTBI group) were then exposed to a mild blast peak incident overpressure of 215 \u00b113 kPa, duration of 0.65 \u00b1 0.04ms, and an impulse of 46 \u00b1 5 kPa*msec. A subset of animals (n=7; sham group) were not exposed to the blast and served as procedural controls. After blast or sham exposure, the righting time was used to assess severity of injury. Mice took 143.84 \u00b1 120.41 (mean \u00b1 std) seconds to right after injury and 85.22 \u00b1 92.40 seconds after sham procedures. Blast did not displace or damage the imaging preparation unless the cement scaffold securing the cannula was insufficiently adhered to the skull, in which case it dislodged the intact preparation from the brain. In the latter event, animals were euthanized immediately.\n\nImaging\nActivity of CA1 neurons was imaged over the course of two weeks starting at least 7 weeks after virus injection when the animals were between 13\u201320 weeks old. Animals were handled once a week for 1\u20132 minutes in the interim and on the day before the first imaging session. On each imaging day, animals were briefly (6.70 \u00b1 3.81, mean \u00b1 std) anaesthetized and the miniscope was mounted onto its baseplate. Upon completion of imaging, the miniscope was usually removed by constraining the mouse briefly with one hand. Anesthesia was only induced if the animal was difficult to constrain making the maneuver difficult.\nAnimals were transferred to their own separate cages (referred to as home cage in this manuscript) at least one day prior to the start of the imaging study but typically on the day the base plate was attached and were housed individually for the two-week duration. Cages were changed once a week and cage changes were avoided in the middle of the block of consecutive imaging days (first change was performed on the first day after injury). Images, on all the days of study, were acquired during the day in a small enclosure near a corner of a dark room (\nSupplementary Figure 1a\n) under red light. The time of the day at which the activity of any given animal was imaged was kept approximately the same (within 25 minutes of the start time on the first day of imaging) for the animal throughout the study. After mounting the camera and adjusting the focus, animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia in their home cage (HC) for at least an hour (proportionally more if the duration under anesthesia was a little longer than usual) on a table perpendicular to the imaging enclosure (see\nSupplementary Figure 1a\n). Activity was imaged in two environments for ten minutes each. First in the animal\u2019s HC and then in a \u2018novel\u2019 open field (45.1 \u00d7 45.1 \u00d7 17.6 cm polycarbonate arena) with ten minutes of rest in between each, during which it was replaced in its HC on the recovery table. To maintain animals\u2019 familiarity with the imaging enclosure and procedures on 5d, animals were placed in their HCs in the enclosure twice on the day of (day 0; prior to and after injury) and 1d after injury (separated by 30 minutes), for the same duration as on the imaged days. Calcium transients were captured at a rate of 20 frames s\n\u22121\n. The LED illumination power and gain for a given animal were kept constant on all the days it was imaged. The LED illumination power for each animal was determined on the first day as the minimum power that clearly showed individual cells and the gain was set at one for all animals. Behavior was simultaneously captured at a rate of ~8 frames s\n\u22121\nwith a webcam controlled by user-defined MATLAB\u00ae scripts. The rate of acquisition of behavior data (~ 8 frames s\n\u22121\n) was constrained such that the least number of frames were dropped by the iNSCOPIX acquisition software. The acquired data was subsequently processed in MATLAB\u00ae.\n\nNovelty in the Open Field\nNovelty in the open field (OF) arena on each of the imaging days was provided by completely covering its walls with materials of different textures and with different pictures (see\nSupplementary Figure 1b\n). Textures ranged from that of the bare polycarbonate of the arena to reusable coarse domestic shelf liners and file enclosures containing pictures to disposable brown paper of grocery bags, crinkly tissue paper and the smooth and highly reflective printer paper. Pictures varied from simple shapes such as a circle or triangle to a more complex pattern of squares or tiles to natural scenes such as grass. The reusable textures viz., shelf liners and file holders were doused with ethanol and cleaned between animals on the same day and at the end of the day they were washed with soap water. The disposable paper textures were replaced with new ones for each animal. The arena was thoroughly wiped with water and ethanol, and the floor was covered with a fresh piece of laboratory shelf liner before placing an animal. The floor on each of the days was randomly arranged with chocolate shavings. Animals were given their first taste of a small shaving of chocolate on the day that they were transferred to their own cage. Animals (n=5) prepared for but excluded for imaging due to the absence of visible cells were used to control for behavior in the absence of chocolate shavings (\nSupplementary Figure 1f\n).\n\nAnalysis of Behavior\nThe animal\u2019s image in each frame of the behavior sequence was automatically segmented and its centroid determined as described previously (\nPatel et al., 2014\n). Due to movement of the miniscope wire and the dim red lights, centroids were frequently off the animal\u2019s image and were corrected manually in those frames. The image centroids in each frame were used to mark the animal\u2019s position in the environment in all subsequent analysis. Behavior in both environments was automatically divided into two intervals of \u2018active\u2019 and \u2018quiet\u2019 based on empirical displacement of the centroid (\nSupplementary Figure 1c\n). These intervals were subsequently manually checked by an investigator blind to the treatment group. In the manual classification, active intervals included the larger displacements of ambulation, leaning, rearing and smaller displacements of turns and limb extensions. Quiet intervals excluded all movements except for small head movements and centroid jitter. The automatic classifier overestimated quiet times by approximately 5% in the HC and 16% in the OF (\nSupplementary Figure 1d\n). Results from the automatic classifier are reported here. For the standard OF measures of time spent in center and periphery, the periphery was set at 11% of the total area i.e., approximately 5cm from each wall.\n\nAnalysis of Calcium Transients or Events\nThe acquired time-series in the two environments on each day were processed individually. Images in a series were registered to correct for horizontal or in-plane motion and normalized by the mean intensity image after subtraction of the same (background subtraction,\nd\nF\nF\n=\nf\ni\nj\n\u2212\nF\ni\nF\ni\n, f\nij\nis the intensity in pixel i in frame j and F\ni\nis the mean intensity in pixel i over time). Regions of Interest (ROI) and the transients therein were first automatically extracted from the raw motion corrected time-series using constrained non-matrix factorization (CNMF-E) (\nZhou et al., 2018\n). To ascertain that the ROI corresponded with a neuron and that the calcium transients were true calcium events in the neuron and not the result of bleed through fluorescence from adjacent overlapping cells or local neuropil fluorescence, each ROI and transient associated with it was then manually inspected in the background subtracted time-series (\nSupplementary Figure 2\n) as follows. First, maximum intensity projections and waveforms of the ROI from the background subtracted time-series in its entirety were examined and all ROI that did not obviously correspond with cells were discarded. Second, local maximum intensity images of all transients (i.e., maximum intensity within the frames comprising FWHM of a transient) with amplitudes greater than 10 in the CNMF-E waveform of a retained ROI were generated from the background subtracted time-series and all transients that were contained within the ROI with amplitudes larger than 3 standard deviations of the dF/F waveform were retained. The dF/F waveforms were then cleaned by setting all points except those of the retained transients to zero. These waveforms were used for all subsequent analysis.\nROI common to both time-series on each day were identified as follows. ROI from both time-series with centroids within 3\u00d73\u03bcm square neighborhood and distance less than 4.5\u03bcm of each other were first identified. The boundaries of these were then overlaid on the maximum intensity projection images of the two series and their correspondence manually verified. All pairs that did not enclose cells in both images were discarded.\nEvent rate was calculated as the number of above threshold transients (events) in the entire duration of recording. Transients that started prior to the start of the recording and decayed after the recording was stopped were excluded. Event rates were found to be below 0.035Hz and were similarly distributed between neurons transfected with GCamp6f under the CamKII and Synapsin promoters (\nSupplementary Figure 3a\n). Population rate vectors with a bin size of one-minute were constructed from z-scored number of transients that started within the one-minute intervals. The eigenvalues of their covariance matrices were determined, and the population vectors were projected onto the first two eigenvectors or principal components to observe the number of network states or dimensionality of the population (\nCarrillo-Reid et al., 2017\n).\n\nStatistics\nData was plotted in MATLAB\u00ae or GraphPad (San Diego, CA) and the final figures assembled in Adobe Illustrator\u00ae. Non-parametric statistics were used for desired comparisons (GraphPad). Comparisons were made with each animal treated as an independent sample. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "CRISPR/Cas9 construct generation and validation\nGuide RNA targeting the spCas9 endonuclease to regions in the mouse genome encoding\nTsc2 and Depdc5\nwere calculated\nin silico\nusing ChopChop software (chopchop.cbu.uib.no). A scramble gRNA (-GACTACCAGAGCTAACTCA-) was used as a transfection and gRNA control.\nIn silico\nguide RNAs were then assembled into oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA), annealed using ligase buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) at 98\u00b0C for 5 min. Annealed gRNA were then sub-cloned into PX330-based plasmid (addgene #48138) using Golden Gate Assembly containing an mCherry reporter linked to Cas9 via a T2a multicistronic element. Plasmid assembly was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Genewiz, South Plainfield, NJ).\nTo validate that our gRNA containing CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid created indels in our regions of interest, DNA from\nTsc2, Depdc5,\nand scramble FAC-sorted cells lines (as described below) as well as wildtype (WT) N2aC was assayed for mis-matched DNA pairs (EnGen Mutation Detection Kit; New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) with PCR primers targeted towards our genomic region of interest (Integrated DNA technologies, Coralville, IA).\nCell Culture and establishment of cell lines\nNeuro2a cells (N2aC; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were selected for analysis because they express neuronal marker proteins (\nFigure S10\n), have a high transfection efficiency, are readily FAC sorted, and can be rapidly differentiated into neurons. N2aC were cultured in complete medium consisting of EMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To create stable CRISPR/Cas9 edited cell lines, N2aC were transfected using Lipofectamine LTX with Plus reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and 30 \u03bcg of plasmid diluted in 300 \u03bcl Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 48 hours. Cotransfection experiments were performed by using 30 \u03bcg of each plasmid. After 48hrs of transfection, cells were trypsinized (0.25%), centrifuged, washed with ice-cold PBS, passed through a cell strainer into a 5 ml conical tube and assayed by flow cytometry (University of Maryland School of Medicine Flow Cytometry Core) for sorting based on mCherry (Cas9) fluorescence (BD FACSAria II cell sorter; Becton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ). mCherry+ sorted cells were placed into PBS containing 1% serum until re-plating. Cells were replated in complete media and grown to confluence.\n\nN2a Cell Differentiation\nUndifferentiated N2aC, both WT and KO cell lines, were plated onto glass bottom video dishes and allowed to adhere for 24 hrs. After 24hrs, cells were incubated in EMEM media containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 20 \u03bcM retinoic acid (Millipore Sigma, St Louis, MO) for 24 hrs. After incubation in retinoic acid containing media, N2aC display a change in cell body morphology and extend MAP2 positive neurites, confirmed in live cells using an ZOE Fluorescent Cell Imager (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). After confirming neurite extension, cells were transfected with mechanistic target of rapamycin activity reporter (TORCAR) as described above.\n\nQuantitative and Statistical analysis of cell size data\nCell soma diameter was measured in digital images of CRISPR-edited, scramble control, or WT N2aC lines in ImageJ (\nSchneider\net al.\n, 2012\n). Each measurement was taken using the longest dimension of each soma in 50 total cells (25 cells in 2 replicates). To define the mTOR dependency of cell size changes, cells were incubated with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (50 nM, 24hrs, Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA), torin1, a specific ATP-competitive dual kinase inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2 (50 nM; 24 hrs; Torcris, Bristol, UK), or amino acid free (AAF) media (1 hr., DMEM, US Biological, Salem, MA) using DMSO as a vehicle control. Statistical analysis of cell size differences was assessed in Origin (Northampton, MA) using one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05 considered statistically significant). Measurements were graphed using a box and whisker plot where the box represents the standard error of the mean and the whiskers represent the 5\u201395% confidence interval.\n\nAnalysis of mTORC1 activity using live-cell imaging\nN2aC were plated on video dishes coated with poly-L-lysine. Cells were grown to 30\u201340% confluence and co-transfected with TORCAR (pcDNA3-Lyso-TORCAR was a gift from J. Zhang; Addgene plasmid # 64929;\nhttp://n2t.net/addgene:64929\n; RRID:Addgene_64929) (\nZhou\net al.\n, 2015\n;\nZhou\net al.\n, 2016\n) and CRISPR-Cas9\nTsc2 or Depdc5\nKO plasmids, scramble plasmid or left as wildtype cells. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine LTX with Plus enhancing reagent (Thermofisher) in optimum and serum-free physiological media. For each chamber slide approximately 30 \u03bcg of each plasmid was used. Cells were transfected for 48 hours. After 48 hours, transfection media was removed, and warm complete imaging media was washed on. Cells were cultured for an additional 24 hours in complete DMEM imaging media (FluoroBrite DMEM, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).\nCells were imaged on a Zeiss LSM Duo slit scanning confocal microscope with lasers allowing us to visualize CFP, YFP and RFP channels. Cells were first selected by Cas9 (red) expression followed by determination of TORCAR transfection (green). Images were taken at 40x magnification simultaneously recording fluorescence from the CFP and YFP FRET channels using time-lapse imaging at two-minute intervals for 60 minutes. First, a 10-minute baseline in complete imaging media was established and then experimental media was washed on. Experimental conditions were defined as follows: 1) complete media baseline, 2) AAF imaging media (no phenol red; US Biologicals, Salem, MA) with or without glucose (5.5 mM), 3) complete imaging media with rapamycin (150 nM), 4) complete imaging media with torin1 (100 nM), 5) complete imaging media with rapamycin followed by washing on AAF media with rapamycin (150 nM), 6) complete imaging media with torin1 followed by washing on AAF media with torin1 (100 nM), 7) complete imaging media followed by washing on AAF media and then by washing on complete imaging media again, or 8) complete imaging media containing 150, 250, 350, 450, or 550 nM rapamycin (n=5 cells imaged in each group).\nAfter recording CFP and YFP fluorescence data, the CFP to YFP ratio (C:Y) was calculated (\nZhou\net al.\n, 2016\n), averaged across 5 cells per group and a best-fit line was generated in Origin statistical software (Northampton, MA). For experiments with one media change a linear best-fit line was generated. For experiments with multiple media changes a polynomial bet-fit line was generated. For each group, the individual C:Y for each cell is graphed (blue) along with the average C:Y (dashed black line) and best-fit line (red). All data were normalized to account for focal plane changes and differences in transfection efficiency. Percent change was also calculated and is defined as the average of data points recorded during the 10 minute baseline compared to the last data point recorded for each cell. These values were also used to calculate standard error. Statistical differences were determined using a one-way ANOVA with a p value of < 0.05 deemed significant. Statistical significance was determined using the average C:Y ratio during each 10 minute baseline and compared to the overall change in C:Y for each experimental manipulation. A representative video of the time-lapse recording can be found in the\nsupplemental material\n(\nMovie S1\n).\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nN2aC were fixed in 4% PFA at room temperature for 20 minutes and then permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Cells were blocked for 2 hours at room temperature (RT) in 5% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Cells were incubated in one of the following primary antibodies in blocking solution containing 5% normal serum at 4\u00b0C overnight: F-actin (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), mTOR (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), lysosome associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2; 1:1000; Thermofisher, Waltham, MA), microtubule associate protein 2 (MAP2; 1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), Tau (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), Nestin (1:1,000; Proteintech, Rosemont, IL), tubulin beta III isoform (TUJ1; 1:500; Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 1:1,000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). The secondary antibody, containing a fluorochrome (Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594; all 1:100 dilution; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), was incubated with the cells for 2 hours at RT. DAPI counterstain was used to visualize nuclei and was applied along with mounting media during coverslipping. Apoptosis and necrosis assays were performed using WT live N2aC plated in chamber slides using the Annexin V-FITC Early Apoptosis Detection Kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Experimental N2aC were incubated in AAF media for 60 minutes prior to imaging. As a positive control for apoptosis and necrosis, 25 nM Etoposide was incubated with WT N2aC for 24 hrs. As a negative control, WT N2aC were used after incubation in complete media.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nCells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0; 150 mM NaCl; 1% NP-40; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; and 0.1% SDS) with a protease (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and phosphatase inhibitor (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) followed by brief sonication. Lysates were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 20 minutes at 14,000\ng\n, and supernatants collected. Protein concentrations (\u03bcg/ml) were determined on a nanodrop spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). A sample mixture containing 30 \u03bcg of protein, Nupage Reducing Agent and Nupage Loading Buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was denatured for 10 minutes at 90\u00b0C and loaded onto a Bolt BT Plus 4\u201312% gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes (Immobilon; EMD millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) at 4\u00b0C. The membranes were blocked in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (Li-Cor, Lincoln, Nebraska) for 1 hr. at RT. Membranes were probed overnight at 4\u00b0C in Odyssey Blocking Buffer with antibodies recognizing PS6 (Ser240/244; rabbit monoclonal; 1:1000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), total S6 ribosomal protein (mouse monoclonal; 1:500; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA),\nTsc2\n(1:1,000, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Odyssey secondary antibodies 800CW or 680RD were used to visualize bands on the blot (1:1000; Li-Cor, Lincoln, Nebraska). To ensure equal loading, antibodies recognizing \u03b2-actin (1:10,000, Abcam, Cambridge UK) followed by Odyssey secondary (1:1,000, 2 hrs, RT; Li-Cor, Lincoln, Nebraska) were used. Blots were developed using an Odyssey Clx scanner and scanned at 169 \u03bcm resolution with exposure for both 700 and 800 nm channels set at 3.5 (relative intensity, no units; Li-Cor, Lincoln, Nebraska). All blots were performed in triplicate and densitometry analysis was performed in Image J (\nSchneider\net al.\n, 2012\n) normalizing band density to \u03b2-actin loading control. Densitometry data were analyzed in Origin software (Northampton, MA). Band density from each blot was averaged and the standard error calculated.\n\nmTOR-lysosome colocalization assay\nCRISPR-edited cell lines were plated into chamber slides and allowed to adhere for 24 hours. After 24 hrs, cells were incubated in AAF or complete media for 60 minutes and then PFA fixed. Cells were labeled with mTOR and LAMP2 antibodies. Using a spinning disk confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), cells were selected and a region of interest (ROI) was isolated. Fluorescence intensity of mTOR and LAMP2 was measured within the ROI using ImageJ (\nSchneider\net al.\n, 2012\n). A Pearson\u2019s correlation test (Excel, Microsoft, Redmond, WA) was then performed to determine whether or not an increase in fluorescence intensity in mTOR correlated with an increase in fluorescence intensity in LAMP2 - the higher the correlation coefficient (R), the greater the degree of colocalization between mTOR and LAMP2. ROIs were measured for 10 N2aC in\nTsc2 KO, Depdc5\nKO, scramble control, and wildtype cells each in either AAF or replete amino acid conditions. Statistical significance was determined using a one-way ANOVA of averaged R values, with p < 0.05 deemed significant. To better visualize the degree of colocalization in digital images, each ROI was reconstructed into a 3D fluorescence intensity surface plot. 3D surface plots were then converted into short video clips to better visualize fluorescence colocalization across the entire ROI."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experiments were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #201408657). Experiments were performed on 50 adult (300\u2013500 gram) male Sprague Dawley rats (208A Colony, Envigo; IN, USA) housed in pairs at 24 \u00baC with a 12/12 light cycle and access to food and water\nad libitum\n. Sample size estimation was based on our extensive experience with this experimental preparation.\n\nNeurophysiological experiments\nTerminal neurophysiological experiments were performed as previously described (\nBaker-Herman et al., 2004\n;\nPerim et al., 2018b\n,\n2019\n). Rats were induced with 3.0% isoflurane in oxygen in a plexiglass chamber, and transferred to a heated surgical table where anesthesia was continued (3.0% isoflurane; 60% oxygen, balance nitrogen). Body temperature was kept at ~ 37.5 \u00baC throughout the experiment using a temperature controller (TC-1000; Ardmore, PA, USA). A polyethylene catheter (I.D., 1.67 mm) was inserted into the trachea through a mid-line neck incision, and rats were mechanically ventilated (2.5 mL/breath, 70 breaths/minute; VentElite small animal ventilator; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). The inspired CO\n2\nfraction was adjusted as needed to keep end-tidal CO\n2\nwithin physiological limits.\nAnesthesia was then slowly converted to urethane (2.1 g/kg at 6mL/hour through a tail vein catheter); while progressively decreasing the inspired isoflurane concentration over ~20 minutes. At least 1 hour was allowed after conversion to start experimental protocols. Throughout experiments, adequate anesthetic depth was confirmed by absence of withdrawal reflex or blood pressure response to toe pinch. Both vagus nerves were exposed and cut at the mid-cervical level to avoid respiratory entrainment with the ventilator. The right femoral artery was exposed and cannulated with a polyethylene catheter (inner diameter 0.58) to monitor blood pressure and blood gases.\nRats were placed on a stereotaxic frame and cervical muscle layers dissected and separated to allow C3 to C5 laminectomy. During some experiments, spinal PtO\n2\nwas measured using a 50 \u03bcm optical sensor (Optode, MicroOptode, Unisense; Aarhus, Denmark) positioned 1 mm lateral to midline between C3 and C4 (~ 1.5 mm deep). Raw signals acquired at 1 Hz were converted to mmHg using a two-point calibration in saline at ~ 37\u00b0C. This solution was equilibrated with 21% O\n2\nfor > 40 minutes (i.e. normoxia), while sodium hydroxide and sodium ascorbate (0.1 M each) were dissolved in warmed saline to form an anoxic calibration solution (0% O\n2\n). Calibration was confirmed at the end of experiments by comparing oxygen pressure in anoxic solution\nversus\nspinal PtO\n2\nmeasured several minutes after death from urethane overdose (data not shown).\nA\n2A\nreceptor (MSX-3, 10 \u03bcM, 12 \u03bcL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or serotonergic 2A/2C receptor antagonists (ketanserin, 500 \u03bcM, 15 \u03bcL; Tocris Biosciences, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were initially diluted in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), aliquoted into vials and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. On the experimental day, stock solutions were diluted in aCSF (in mM: 125 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2.5 CaCl\n2\n2H\n2\nO, 1.25 MgSO4-7H2O, 1.25 KH2PO4, 25 NaHCO\n3\n, bubbled with 95% O\n2\n-5% CO\n2\n) to the final concentration. Prior to AIH, antagonists were administered via an intrathecal silicone catheter (2 French, 0.6 mm OD; Access Technologies; Skokie, IL, USA) attached to a 50\u03bcL Hamilton syringe. The catheter tip was advanced caudally through a small hole in the dura and stabilized on the dorsal side of ~ C4. Ten minutes before AIH, drugs (final DMSO concentration < 5%) were administered slowly from the catheter over a 2-minute period.\nThe left phrenic nerve was isolated and cut distally. Epineurium was retracted to expose the nerve tip, and electrical nerve signals were acquired using suction electrodes connected to a differential amplifier (A-M Systems, Model 1700; Sequim, WA, USA). Nerve signals were amplified (10,000x), band-pass filtered (0.3 to 5 kHz), and digitized (CED 1401; Cambridge Electronic Design; Cambridge, England, UK) using Spike2 software (version 8.08; Cambridge Electronic Design; Cambridge, England, UK). Rats were paralyzed with pancuronium bromide (3 mg/kg i.v.; Sigma-Aldrich; Saint Louis, MO).\n\nExperimental Design\nAfter establishing stable nerve activity, the inspired CO\n2\nfraction was slowly decreased until the apneic threshold was reached, defined as the end-tidal CO\n2\ncausing sustained apnea (> than 1 min). Inspired CO\n2\nfraction was then progressively increased until phrenic nerve activity resumed (i.e. recruitment threshold). Baseline end-tidal CO\n2\nwas then set at 2\u20133 mmHg above the recruitment threshold. Baseline nerve activity was characterized over a 15-minute period in which two stable blood gas values were obtained. Inspired O\n2\nfraction was reduced to ~ 0.13 for 5 minutes, targeting a PaO\n2\nbetween 35\u201355 mmHg (blood sample ~ 2.5 minutes after hypoxic episode onset). This 5-minute hypoxia cycle was repeated 3 times, separated by 5-minute 60% O\n2\nintervals. Phrenic nerve activity and spinal PtO\n2\nwere recorded up to 90 minutes after AIH in 3 experimental groups: 1) carotid-denervated (CBX) (\nPerim et al., 2018a\n); 2) CBX-Phenyl: in CBX rats, systemic phenylephrine was administrated during AIH to counteract hypoxia-induced hypotension; and 3) Sham, in which the carotid bifurcation was exposed, but the carotid sinus nerve left intact. Spinal A\n2A\nor serotonin 2A/2C receptors were inhibited in additional groups of CBX rats to further investigate mechanisms of residual pLTF. Carotid denervation was confirmed by an absence of increase in phrenic nerve burst amplitude following low dose intravenous injections of a sodium cyanide solution (25 \u03bcg in 0.2 mL saline), as in previous reports (\nBavis & Mitchell, 2003\n;\nAmorim et al., 2016\n;\nPerim et al., 2018a\n). Experiments were excluded only if: 1) not possible to stablish baseline (see above); 2) substantial hypotension developed post-AIH, affecting stability of the preparation and ability to regulate blood gases.\n\nData analyses\nFor quantitative analyses, raw nerve signals were smoothed (0.05 sec time constant) and rectified for off-line analysis. Integrated phrenic nerve burst amplitude 90 minutes post-AIH was compared with baseline values. One-way ANOVA was used to compare response means (mean arterial pressure during hypoxia, hypoxic ventilatory response, spinal PaO\n2\nduring baseline, spinal PaO\n2\nduring hypoxia, \u0394 mean arterial pressure during hypoxia, and \u0394 spinal PaO\n2\nduring hypoxia, both from baseline to 90 minutes post-AIH) among the 3 main experimental groups (Sham, CBX, CBX-phenyl;\nSchabenberger & Pierce, 2002\n). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to estimate group-specific trend line intercepts and slopes of a single predictor regressed on a response variable, and to compare slopes among the 3 experimental groups (\nSchabenberger & Pierce, 2002\n). A linear mixed effect random coefficients model was used to estimate group-specific mean trend line intercepts and slopes from animal-specific trend line intercepts and slopes of time regressed on spinal PaO\n2\n(\nBrown & Prescott, 2015\n). In the random coefficients model, animal-specific intercepts and slopes within an experimental group are assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution with mean intercept and slope parameters and associated covariance parameters. Mean slopes were compared among the 3 experimental groups within the framework of the random coefficients model. A linear mixed effect model with time modeled as a 4-level within-animal fixed effect (0, 30, 60, 90 minutes), experimental group modeled as a 3-level between-animal fixed effect, and animal modeled as a random effect, was used to assess change in group-specific mean response over time (integrated phrenic amplitude, respiratory frequency) and to compare patterns of change in mean response among the 3 experimental groups (\nBrown & Prescott, 2015\n). A linear mixed effect model was also used to compare patterns of mean response over time (integrated phrenic amplitude, respiratory frequency) between CBX-5-HT\n2\nand CBX-A\n2A\nantagonist or between time control and phenyl groups. Normal distribution of residual errors was confirmed by visual inspection of histograms and normal probability plots. Pre-planned pairwise comparisons of mean response within the framework of each type of analysis model were carried out using appropriately weighted contrasts based on the t statistic (\nBrown & Prescott, 2015\n). Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 1 standard error of the mean. Means are also displayed in some figures with 95% confidence intervals. An alpha-level of 0.05 was used to assess statistical significance for all pre-planned comparisons. All analyses were carried out using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary NC) or R Version 3.4.2 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThe CD63-GFP\nf/f\nknock-in mice were generated by homologue recombination, as we previously described (\n24\n). Briefly, the human CD63-copGFP-6xHis cassette was subcloned onto the Rosa-CAG targeting vector, downstream of the CAG promoter and upstream of the 3\u2019 arm, to generate the final CD63-copGFP-6xHis targeting vector. The targeting vectors were linearized and transfected into the ES cell line to induce homologue recombination. Chimeric mice were bred with C57BL/6J mice to obtain germline transmission. B6SJL-Tg (SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J mice were purchased from Jax Laboratories (# 002726). Both male and female mice were used in all experiments. All mice were maintained on a 12h light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum. Care and treatment of animals in all procedures strictly followed the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Guidelines for the Use of Animals in Neuroscience Research and the Tufts University IACUC.\n\nSciatic Nerve Injection\nControl wild-type littermates, SOD1G93A, CD63-GFP\nf/+\n, or CD63-GFP\nf/+\nSOD1G93A (P60) mice were deeply anaesthetized for surgery with ketamine (100 mg/kg) plus xylazine (10 mg/kg) in saline by intraperitoneal (IP) injection. The hindquarter of the nerve to be injected was shaved using electric clippers, and the skin was sterilized using betadine and sterile alcohol. A horizontal incision through the skin was made on the mouse hind limb. The sciatic nerve was located by opening the fascial plane between the gluteus maximus and the anterior head of the biceps femoris. The sciatic nerve was then lifted from the muscle bellies and propped up using a spatula, taking care not to damage the nerve. For control and SOD1G93A mice (P60), a mixture of FluoroGold (1 \u03bcL) and Cy5-miR-124\u20133p or Cy5-miR-709 (2 \u03bcL, 100\u03bcM) was injected into the sciatic nerves using a Hamilton syringe (10 \u03bcL). For CD63-GFP\nf/+\nand CD63-GFP\nf/+\nSOD1G93A mice (P60), a mixture of AAV9-CAMKII-Cre virus (2 \u03bcL, from Penn Vector Core), FluoroGold (1 \u03bcL), and Cy5-miR-124\u20133p (2 \u03bcL, 100\u03bcM) was then injected into the sciatic nerves. Cy5-miR-124\u20133p or Cy5-miR-709 was synthesized by IDT DNA Technologies with a 2\u2019 O-Methyl group on each nucleotide and phosphoorothioate bonds between the first and last three nucleotides.\n\nImmuno-EM Microscopy\nImmuno-EM was carried out in the Harvard EM facility. Adult mice (P60) were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 0.1% glutaraldehyde. The spinal cord was dissected out and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 2 hrs and then spinal cord slices (100 \u03bcm) were prepared using a vibratome. The slices were then quenched, permeabilized, and blocked in blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 5% normal donkey serum, and 0.1% Triton X-100) at 4\u00b0C. Anti-human CD63 (BD Pharmingen, #556019) antibody was then added and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. After wash, slices were incubated with Protein A-gold for 1 hour at 25\u00b0C. The images were taken using the JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope.\n\nTissue processing, confocal imaging, and quantification\nMice were deeply anesthetized with Ketamine (100mg/kg) + Xylazine (10mg/kg) in saline by intraperitoneal (IP) injection and perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. The lumbar spinal cords were dissected and kept in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C, then cryoprotected by immersion in 30% sucrose for 48h. Spinal cords were embedded and frozen in OCT-Compound Tissu-Tek\u00ae (Sakura, Tokyo Japan). Lumbar cord (L3-L5) sections (20 \u03bcm) were prepared with a cryostat (Thermo HM525) and mounted on glass SuperFrost+ slides (Fisher Scientific). The slides were rinsed three times in PBS before mounting. Confocal images were taken using the A1R confocal laser scanning microscope (15\u201320 \u03bcm Z stack with 0.5\u20131 \u03bcm step) magnified with 40X (numerical aperture 0.8) or 60X (numerical aperture 1.0) objectives (Nikon Instruments INC. Melville, NY). Low magnification images were taken using the Zeiss Axio imager with ApoTome. For the quantification of Cy5-miR signals, the far-red channel of the confocal image (63x) was thresholded to remove background signals. The puncta were then analyzed using the Analyze Particles tool in Image J to obtain particle counts. The intracellular and extracellular Cy5-miR signals were determined by manually examining the overlaying Cy5-miR signals with the FluoroGold channel. The percentage of intracellular and extracellular Cy5-miR signals were then calculated from the total Cy5-miR signals. For the quantification of CD63-GFP\n+\npuncta in spinal cord, confocal images (40x) were split into individual channels and converted to 8-bit greyscale. Regions of Interest (ROI) were drawn around motor neurons based on the FluoroGold fluorescence. Images were first thresholded to remove the background. The CD63-GFP puncta were then analyzed using the Analyze Particles tool to obtain particle count and particle area inside and outside of the ROIs, which was then converted to radius and then diameter (\u03bcm). For the quantification of the co-localization between extracellular CD63-GFP+ and Cy5-miR-124\u20133p puncta, green (CD63-GFP) and far-red (Cy5-miR-124\u20133p) channels of confocal images (40x) were first thresholded and their co-localization was identified and quantified using the JacoP plugin for Image J.\n\nIn situ\nhybridization and immunohistochemistry\nLocked-Nucleic-Acid (LNA) fluorescence\nin situ\nhybridization was performed as previously described (\n49\n) with modifications. Using RNase-free technique, mice were perfused with PBS, and freshly dissected lumbar cord tissue was embedded in OCT-Compond Tissu-Tek\u00ae (Sakura, Tokyo Japan). Lumbar cords were sectioned (10\u03bcm) on a cryostat (Thermo HM525) and then mounted on glass SuperFrost+ slides (Fisher Scientific). Slides were briefly fixed for 1 minute with freshly prepared 4% PFA. Slides were incubated in acetylation solution for 10 minutes, and then in hybridization solution at 60\u02daC for 4 hours. For hybridization, slides were hybridized with denatured DIG-labeled miR-124\u20133p or U6 RNA LNA probe (80 nM, Exiqon) overnight at 60\u02daC. Slides were then washed and incubated in blocking solution (1% BSA, 5% goat-serum, and 0.2% Triton-X 100 in PBS) for 1 hour. To amplify the LNA-probe signal, slides were incubated with HRP anti-DIG (1:1,000, 11207733910, Roche) for 1 hour, then incubated with biotin-tyramide (1:1,000, Sigma) for 1 hour, then incubated with DTAF-conjugated streptavidin (1:500, 016\u2013010-084, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 hour. The NeuN immunostaining (1:500, MAB377, Millipore) was performed following standard immunohistochemistry procedures. The slides were then mounted with ProLong Gold Anti-Fade mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\nImmunoblot\nPrepared CSF exosome samples were briefly sonicated, and the total protein amount was determined by the Bradford protein assay. A total of 30 \u03bcg proteins were loaded on 4\u201315% gradient SDS-PAGE gels and the protein mixtures were separated by size using gel electrophoresis. Separated proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (0.22 \u03bcm, Bio-Rad) at constant 2.5Amp for 10 minutes using the Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System. The membrane was blocked with 3% nonfat milk in TBST (Tris buffer saline with 0.1% Tween 20) then incubated with the appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. On the following day, the membrane was incubated with anti-CD81 antibody (1:200, clone B-11, Santa Cruz) and subsequently with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:5000, abcam) diluted in TBST for 1 hour at RT. Bands were visualized by ECL Plus chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP imaging system.\n\nRNA isolation and miR qPCR\nTotal RNA was extracted from lumbar cord tissue or from exosomes of CSF using TRiZol reagent, following the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. The quantity and quality of isolated miRNA was determined using the Agilent BioAnalyser with the pico RNA kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The miRNA was converted to cDNA using the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) with specific primers for each individual miR and control U6 small nuclear (sn) RNA. For pri-miR-124\u20133p, random primers were used for the reverse transcription. The relative quantity of individual miRs was measured by qPCR using SyberGreen. The miR-124\u20133p and pri-miR-124 is normalized by U6 snRNA or \u03b2-actin, respectively.\n\nCSF EV isolation and qNano particle analysis\nTunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS) (\n30\n,\n31\n) by qNano instrument 60 (Izon Science, MA, USA) was used to measure the size distribution and quantity of particles in isolated exosome fractions, as described in the instrument. An aliquot of exosomes fraction or calibration particles included in the reagent kit were placed in the Nanopore (NP150, Izon Science). CSF samples were first concentrated 6 x using Centricon (30 KDa cut-off) filters by centrifugation. Samples were then measured at 44.9 mm stretch with a voltage of 0.76 V at 1-pressure levels of 14 mbar. Particles were detected in short pulses of the current (blockades). The calibration particles were measured directly after the experimental sample under identical conditions. The data was analyzed using the Izon software (version 3.2). The Total Exosome Isolation Reagent (#4484453, Thermo Fisher Scientific)-mediated precipitation approach was used to isolate EVs from CSF for qPCR and western blot. CSF samples (2 mL/subject) were centrifuged at 2,000g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatants were mixed with equal volume (2 mL) of the Total Exosome Isolation Reagent (4484453, Thermo Fisher Scientific) overnight and then centrifuged at 10,000g for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C to pellet all precipitated exosomes.\n\nSubjects\nAll CSF samples of ALS patients, neurological disease controls (DCs) and healthy controls (HCs) were obtained from Northeast Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Consortium (NEALS) Biofluid Repository (\nTable 1\n). Samples were received frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. All the cases were selected by the NEALS Biofluid Repository to have the best possible matching by age, gender, weight and height, etc (\nTable 1\n).\n\nExperimental design and statistical analysis\nAll experiments and analysis were performed blindly (with different lab members) without knowing the sample identity in advance. Sample size and statistical approach used for each experiment are described in each method section and in figure legends. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7. For graphs with error bars, error bars are presented as SEM. No custom code was used in the analysis. For multiple groups (> 2), one-way ANOVA was used to analyze the variance, followed by a Tukey post-hoc test to compare multiple groups. For two-group comparison, two-tailed student t-test was used. Statistical significance was tested at a 95% (P<0.05) confidence level and p values are shown in each graph."

Animals\nAdult male, Sprague-Dawley rats (225 g at arrival, Envigo RMC Inc., Indianapolis, IN), were housed two per cage throughout the study in a temperature and humidity-controlled room on a 12-h reverse light/dark cycle. Food and water were provided\nad libitum\n. All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The University of Arizona, were performed in accordance with the NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the ARRIVE guidelines.\n\n2.3. Unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion\nRats (\nn\n= 110, 250\u2013300 g at time of surgery) were pretreated (30-min prior to 6-OHDA administration) with 12.5 mg/kg desipramine hydrochloride in sterile 0.9% normal saline, with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to prevent loss of noradrenergic neurons. Anesthesia was administered by isoflurane (1.5\u20132.0%; VetOne, Boise, ID) mixed in a vaporizer (JD Medical, Phoenix, AZ) with 1.5 l of oxygen/min. 6-OHDA (5.0 \u03bcg/\u03bcl in sterile 0.9% normal saline with 0.02% ascorbic acid; Sigma-Aldrich) was administered (0.5 \u03bcl/min) using a microinjector (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) attached to a 26-gauge needle (Hamilton Co., Reno, NV) and 10 \u03bcl Hamilton syringe. Two microliters (10 \u03bcg/coordinate) of 6-OHDA were injected at two coordinates in the MFB: AP = \u22121.8 mm, ML = +2.0 mm, DV = \u22128.2 mm and AP= \u22122.8 mm, ML = +1.8 mm, DV = \u22128.2 mm (\nPaxinos and Watson, 2007\n). The needle was removed 5-min post-injection to prevent backflow. Given the established and standard nature of this model, both in the field and in our Laboratory, no sham-surgery groups were included.\n\n2.4. Amphetamine-induced rotation test\nTo determine the severity of the 6-OHDA lesions, rats were treated with dextro-amphetamine (5 mg/kg in sterile 0.9% normal saline,\ni.p.\n; Sigma-Aldrich) and placed in a plexiglass cylinder (38 cm diameter \u00d7 38 cm height). Rotations (contralateral and ipsilateral to the lesion) were recorded for 1-min, every 5-min, over 100-min. The mean \u00b1 SEM net ipsilateral rotations were calculated and rats were assigned to balanced treatment groups. Only rats with a net ipsilateral rotation score \u2265 4 were included in each study (\nn\n= 80). In\nExperiment 1\n, one rat died and two were removed for unrelated health reasons. In\nExperiment 2\n, one rat was removed for its inability to perform the RotaRod test at pre-lesion baseline.\n\n2.5. Drug and vehicle preparation\nAll systemic drugs were administered at a volume of 1 ml/kg\nvia intraperitoneal\n(\ni.p.\n) injection. In\nExperiment 1\n, ketamine (20 mg/kg; VetOne),\nR\n-ketamine (10 mg/kg; Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI), and L-DOPA (6 and 12 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich) combined with benserazide hydrochloride (14 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich) were formulated in the vehicle solution, 0.9% USP grade sterile saline (VetOne). Benserazide is a peripherally acting aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase or DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, which is unable to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, used to prevent conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine in the bloodstream. In\nExperiment 2\n, ketamine (20 mg/kg; VetOne) was formulated in the vehicle solution, 0.9% USP grade sterile saline (VetOne). In\nExperiment 3\n, ketamine (20 mg/kg; VetOne) and L-DOPA (6 mg/kg) combined with benserazide (14 mg/kg) were formulated in 0.9% USP grade sterile saline (VetOne). N-[2-[(2-oxoazepan-3-yl)carbamoyl]phenyl]-1-benzothiophene-2-carboxamide (ANA-12; 0.5 mg/kg; Tocris Bioscience, Minneapolis, MN) was dissolved in 5% DMSO, 55% polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG-400; Sigma-Aldrich), and 40% normal saline. ANA-12 is a tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB)-receptor antagonist used to probe for involvement of the BDNF pathway (\nCazorla et al., 2011\n).\n\n2.6. L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) rating scale\nThe severity of LID was assessed by an investigator blinded to experimental conditions using the abnormal involuntary movement (AIM) rating scale, based on the work of\nDekundy et al., 2007\n, and established in our laboratory (\nFlores et al., 2014\n;\nBartlett et al., 2016\n;\nFlores et al., 2018\n). We initially had validated it in our laboratory with amantadine (40 mg/kg,\ni.p.\n). AIMs were each scored on a scale 0 (no AIMs) to 4 (severe and uninterruptible) for 1-min, every 20-min, over 180-min. Limb, axial, and orolingual (LAO) AIMs were scored and summed as a composite score.\n\n2.7. Forelimb adjusting steps (FAS) test\nThe FAS test was used to measure akinesia. In\nExperiments 1\nand\n3\n, rats underwent testing pre- and post-lesion. Testing was performed following the first, fourth, and fifth (paired with L-DOPA) injections on each treatment day. Each test consisted of three trials performed at 40, 60, and 80 min post-injection of either ketamine or saline. In each trial, the hind limbs of the rats were raised, and one forepaw was restrained by the investigator. The rat was then moved laterally, with only the unrestrained forepaw supporting its body weight, across a smooth surface of 90 cm, at a rate of 9 cm/s. All behavioral testing sessions were video recorded and the mean \u00b1 SEM number of steps were counted by a blinded investigator, as published (\nFlores et al., 2018\n).\n\n2.8. RotaRod test\nThe RotaRod test was used to investigate motor coordination in the unilateral 6-OHDA rat model as first shown by\nMonville et al., (2006)\n. Using a modified version of the protocol published by\nSu et al., (2018)\n, rats were trained on a 4-lane RotaRod (Rotamex 4/8, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) for two consecutive days. Each training session consisted of a 5-min trial at a constant speed of 10 rotations per minute (rpm). Testing was then performed 7 days prior to the administration of 6-OHDA (Pre-Lx) and again at 28 and 35 days post-lesion (Post-Lx). Testing sessions were performed on an accelerating rod (4 to 40 rpm) and consisted of four, two-minute trials spaced 20 min apart. These were performed at 40, 60, 80, and 100 min post-injection of either ketamine or saline. The mean latency to fall from the first three time points was used for analysis.\n\n2.9. Treatment groups and experimental design\nIn\nExperiment 1\n, PD rats were treated every seven-days with either vehicle,\nR\n-ketamine, or ketamine in accordance with our published (\nBartlett et al., 2016\n;\nYe et al., 2018\n) 10-h ketamine treatment-paradigm (\nFig. 1A\n). To create the LID model on day 0, L-DOPA was paired with the 5th injection and then given each day throughout the remainder of the priming period (D0\u201313: 6 mg/kg; D14\u201349: 12 mg/kg). LAO-AIMs were scored every 3\u20134 days up to day 45. In\nExperiment 2\n, PD rats underwent a similar treatment protocol that omitted L-DOPA (\nFig. 1B\n). In\nExperiment 3\n, rats underwent a similar treatment protocol (\nFig. 1C\n); vehicle and ketamine injections were given five times, every two-hours on days 0 and 7 during the two-week priming with L-DOPA (6 mg/kg). ANA-12 was administered with the first injection and again five-hours later based upon evidence that peak TrkB receptor phosphorylation occurs at 4-h (\nCazorla et al., 2011\n;\nFischer et al., 2017\n).\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nSchemes for\nExperiments\nand\npost hoc\nanalyses.

Electrochemical detection of striatal DA content (mean \u00b1 SEM) is reduced by>95% in the lesioned side. Striatal DA content was unchanged by a 10-h-treatment of either ketamine (K;\nn\n=9),\nR\n-ketamine (\nR\n-K;\nn\n=9)\nvs.\nvehicle (V;\nn\n= 9) 1-h before rats were euthanized, showing no effect on overall striatal DA levels by ketamine or\nR\n-ketamine-treatment compared to vehicle in either the lesioned (Lx) or the intact hemisphere.

Two-tailed\nt\n-test, ***\np\n< .001.\n\n2.10. Measurement of dopamine content\nIn\nExperiment 1\n, rats were euthanized on day 49 with carbon dioxide one hour after the fifth injection of ketamine paired with L-DOPA. The brains were extracted and coronal brain slices, 1 mm thick, were collected, 2 mm steel biopsy punches were taken from the intact and lesioned striata and analyzed by HPLC-EC, as previously published (\nFlores et al., 2018\n).\n\n2.11. Tissue preparation for western blot, multiplex immunoassays\nIn\nExperiment 2\nand the ANA-12-only control study, rats were euthanized on Day 14 with carbon dioxide. The remaining striatal tissue from\nExperiment 1\n, as well as the whole striatal tissue from\nExperiment 2\nand the ANA-12-only control study, was dissected from both hemispheres and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue was homogenized in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, protease inhibitor cocktail at 1:100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Homogenate was centrifuged for 30-min at 14,000 g and aliquoted at \u221270 \u00b0C. Protein concentration was determined for each subsequent immunoassay using a BCA assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and read on a FlexStation 3 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA).\n\n2.12. Western blot analysis\nAll striatal tissue was run on Any-kD MiniProtean\u00ae TGX\u2122 precast gels, transferred with a Trans-Blot TurboTransfer System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), Chameleon\u00ae Duo Pre-stained Protein Ladder was used for size reference, blots were scanned on an Odyssey CLx imaging system, (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) and analyzed with Empiria Studio Software according to the manufacturers respective recommendations. Tissue homogenate samples from the striata of dyskinetic rats in\nExperiment 1\nwere loaded with a two-fold dilution from 64 to 0.5 \u03bcg to determine a linear range for each protein, and 5\u201315 \u03bcg of protein was loaded on each gel with a positive and negative control. Primary antibodies: Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (Thr 202/Tyr 204) (L34F12) (1:2000), Pan-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (1:2000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Tyrosine Hydroxylase (1:2000) (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Beta-Actin (1:10,000) (Sigma-Aldrich). LICOR secondary antibodies: IRDye\u00ae 800 CW Donkey anti-Rabbit (1:10,000), IRDye\u00ae 680 CW Donkey anti-Mouse (1:10,000). Controls: p44/42 MAPK control cell extracts (Cell Signaling Technology).\n\n2.13. mTOR pathway evaluation\nPhospho-mTOR (Ser2448) and total mTOR levels were measured using a 2-plex magnetic bead panel kit (46\u2013686MAG; Millipore). The immunoassay was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol with each sample, standard, and quality control measured in duplicate, using a MAGPIX system (Luminex, Austin, TX).\n\n2.14. Tissue preparation for Golgi-Cox analysis and immunohistochemistry\nIn\nExperiment 3\n, rats were sacrificed on Day 14 of AIMs scoring, within 4-h of behavioral testing. They were deeply anesthetized with Euthanasia Solution (0.35 ml; VetOne) and transcardially perfused with 200 ml of heparinized (10 units per ml; Sagent, Schaumburg, IL) 0.9% normal saline, followed by 200 ml of cold paraformaldehyde (4% in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB); MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA). Brains were extracted and hemisected at the hypothalamus. The rostral half, containing the striatum, was post-fixed in paraformaldehyde for 1-h, then shipped overnight in 0.1 M PB to Dr. Steece-Collier. To validate severity of the 6-OHDA lesion, 40 \u03bcm sections yielding the SN were obtained using a cryostat (CM1850, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), and IHC was performed as described in prior work (\nFlores et al., 2018\n). Sections were incubated with rabbit anti-TH primary antibody (1:1000; AB152; Millipore) at 4 \u00b0C overnight and a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:4000; AP187B; Millipore) for 2-h at RT, followed by ABC reagent (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit; PK-6100; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). TH-ir neurons were visualized using a DAB Kit (SK-4100; Vector Laboratories). Densitometry analysis of the total area of detected objects (total pixels2) in a 480 \u00d7 480 pixel region of the mediolateral SN (3 sections/rat) was conducted by a blinded investigator with ImageJ software (\nvs.\n2.0.0-rc-69/1.52p,\nhttp://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/\n) according to an established protocol (\nKneynsberg et al., 2016\n).\n\n2.15. Golgi-Cox impregnation and analysis\nAll procedures and methods performed for Golgi-Cox impregnation and dendritic spine analysis were performed based on previously established criteria developed in the laboratory of Dr. Steece-Collier (\nZhang et al., 2013\n;\nLevine et al., 2013\n). Upon arrival at Michigan State University, the rostral half of the brain was impregnated using a modified Golgi-Cox protocol, sectioned at 100 \u03bcm on a vibrating microtome (VT1000S; Leica Microsystems), and mounted on gel-coated slides. Golgi-impregnated neurons from the dorsolateral part of the precommissural, commissural, and dorsal striatum were initially identified at low-power magnification. For analysis, only neurons with at least 4 primary dendrites radiating from the soma in a 360\u00b0 arc with no overlap with adjacent cells were selected. A single dendrite from a neuron in each region of the striatum (3 dendrites/hemisphere/rat) was traced and spine density, length, and phenotype were quantified by a blinded investigator using Neurolucida\u00ae (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT).\n\n2.16. Bladder pathology\nUrinary bladders were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, processed, paraffin-embedded, and 5 \u03bcm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. All slides were evaluated by a board-certified veterinary pathologist (DB) blinded to the experimental design and sample group assignment. Lesion interpretation was performed in accord with a previously published lesion scoring system (\nGu et al., 2014\n).\n\n2.17. Statistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). The null hypothesis was rejected when\np\n< .05. All values are represented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Dopamine content and TH-ir densitometry were analyzed with two-way ANOVAs and Bonferroni\npost hoc\ntests. LAO-AIMs were analyzed with non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests with Dunn\u2019s multiple comparisons\npost hoc\ntests. FAS and RotaRod tests were analyzed with ANOVAs with Tukey-Kramer corrected\npost hoc\ntests. Western blot and mTOR analyses were performed with two-tailed\nt-\ntests on data before normalization to vehicle control. Spine data was analyzed with one-way ANOVA with Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test. Correlations were performed with Pearson\u2019s correlations. A summary with all statistical details is presented in the Appendix A."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animal groups\nThirty adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (220\u2013250g; Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI, USA) were assigned randomly into three groups: (1) spinally-intact group (laminectomy only; N=10); (2) T8 complete transection group; N=10 (2) T8 spinal cord contusive injury group; N=10. Rats were housed in standard laboratory cages under 12:12-hour light-dark cycle conditions with standard rodent chow and water available\nad libitum\n. All experiments were performed during the light cycle. All animal procedures were approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The spinal cord surgery was performed under ketamine/xylene anesthesia and LUT functional assessments were prepared under isoflurane with urethane anesthesia, and all efforts were made during post-operation care to minimize suffering. All procedures were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.\n\n2.2. T8 spinal cord laminectomy, complete transection, and contusive spinal cord injury surgery\nThe spinal cord transection and contusion surgical procedures were described in detail in our previous studies (\nDePaul et al., 2017\n;\nLee et al., 2013\n). Briefly, animals had operations performed while they were under general anesthesia using intraperitoneal administration of ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Rectal temperature was monitored and maintained using a heating pad underneath the animal, which automatically adjusts the temperature based upon feedback from the rectal probe. A sterile eye lubricant (paralube) was applied to prevent dehydration. The musculature was cut from T7\u2013T9 and the dorsal surface of T8 was exposed by laminectomy. The spinally-intact group did not receive injury procedures. For the complete transection group, a complete cut was made by scissors at T8, resulting in a separated gap (2\u20133 mm) between two stumps. A high-magnification surgical microscope was used to confirm that there was no remaining neural tissue between the two stumps of cord. For the contusive injury group, the vertebral column was stabilized by clamping the T7 and T9 vertebral bodies with forceps fixed to the base of the Infinite Horizon Impact Device. The animal was situated on the platform and a 2.5 mm stainless steel impactor tip was positioned over the midpoint of T8 and impacted with a 250 kDyne force. The overlying musculature was sutured closed and the skin was closed using 4\u20130 black monofilament sutures. A force/displacement graph was used to monitor impact consistency and any animals that exhibited an abnormal impact graph or greater than 10% deviation from 250 kDynes were immediately excluded from the study.\n\n2.3. Urodynamics, EUS EMG recordings, and pharmacological interventions\nTwo months after complete SCI or four months after contusive SCI, animals were anesthetized under 2.5% isoflurane with oxygen to perform surgeries, and then cystometrography (CMG) and EUS EMG recording were performed under urethane (1.0 mg/kg) anesthetic conditions. The urinary bladder was exposed by an incision at the midline abdomen. A catheter (polyethylene 50) was inserted into the bladder through a small incision at the apex of the bladder dome. The bladder end of a PE catheter was heated to form a collar and was secured with a purse-string suture on the opening of the detrusor. A normal saline-filled femoral vein catheter was inserted into the femoral vein for drug delivery. The bladder catheter exited from the rostral edge of the abdominal wound, which was closed in layers. The skin above the vascular catheters was also closed. Fine (50\u03bcm diameter) teflon-insulated platinum wire electrodes (A-M Systems; Sequim, WA, USA) were inserted percutaneously on both sides of the mid-urethra using a 27-gauge needle for subsequent measurements of EUS EMG activity. Next, rats were placed in a restraining cage to perform physiological tests. Following a one-hour recovery period from isoflurane anesthesia, continuous CMGs were collected using constant infusion (6 ml/hr) of saline by an infusion pump (World Precision Instruments; Sarasota, FL, USA) through the catheter into the bladder to elicit repetitive voids. The electrodes were connected to an AC amplifier (AstroNova, Inc.; West Warwick, RI, USA) with high- and low-pass frequency filters at 10 Hz and 1 kHz and a recording system (DASH 8X, AstroNova, Inc.) at a sample frequency of 10 kHz. Continuous CMG at a flow rate of 6 ml/hr for 1 hour prior allowed the lower urinary tract to adjust to the flow rate. After an hour, the pump was stopped and the bladder was emptied by aspiration through the bladder catheter via a stopcock port. The pump was restarted and after at least three to five reproducible fillings, CMGs were obtained as a baseline and the bladder was emptied again. Three dosages of NLX-112 (0.05 mg/kg; 0.5 mg/kg; 2.5 mg/kg, i.v. (Neurolixis Inc.; Wilmington, DE, USA)) were intravenously administered through the femoral vein and then another filling CMG was performed, from which measurements were taken for three to five filling cycles. The interval between each was not shorter than 30 minutes. The bladder was emptied at the end of each dose study prior to starting the next one. Following the delivery of 2.5 mg/kg NLX-112, the 5-HT\n1A\nreceptor antagonist, WAY100635 (2 mg/kg, Sigma) was intravenously administered through the femoral vein and then another filling CMG was performed, from which measurements were taken for three to five filling cycles. WAY100635 solution was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml followed by a 0.2 ml flush of saline. The testing dosage was selected in accordance with previous studies (\nKakizaki et al., 2001\n).\n\n2.4. Quantification of CMG and EUS EMG patterns\nFor each of the individual treatments in the CMG and EUS EMG recordings, 3 to 5 consecutive and stabilized micturition events were segmented for analysis as described in our previous study (\nLee et al., 2013\n). Segmented data included the full duration between the completions of two consecutive voiding contractions. A MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) script was written to measure various CMG/EMG parameters. CMG voiding parameters include: the time to the first void (ttfV) (sec), peak pressure (cmH\n2\nO), volume-per-void (ml), and voiding efficiency. Non-voiding contractions (NVCs) were defined as contractions with amplitudes exceeding 5 cm H\n2\nO that were not associated with any successful micturition. In SCI animals, the series of NVCs preceding each voiding event were analyzed together to match their respective voiding events. Measured CMG non-voiding parameters include: amplitude (peak pressure \u2013 baseline pressure) (cmH\n2\nO) and the number of non-voids. The EMG parameters include (during the bursting phase): the number of EMG bursts, EMG bursting duration (sec), and EMG burst interval (sec). EMG bursts were qualified as coordinated when they were timed in sync with the CMG high-frequency pressure oscillations. Data are presented as group mean \u00b1 S.E.M. and were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with a Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\ntest using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). The significance level was set to 0.05 for all comparisons.\n\n2.5. Statistical analysis\nAll animal-related procedures, data collection, and data analyses were performed in a blinded fashion. Functional assessments were compared using repeated measures ANOVAs. Following significant main effects, Tukey\npost hoc\ntests were used to determine specific group and/or treatment differences. Significant differences between groups are indicated by a significant * (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001)"

Study participants signed informed consent and could withdraw at any time. They did not have history of neurological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, and/or severe musculoskeletal impairments. Participants completed at least one of the three experimental sessions. Data collection occurred on separate experimental sessions.\n\nB. Equipment\nAir delivery system:\nAs illustrated in\nFigure 1\n, a commercially available pressure-swing absorption (PSA) system [HYP-123; Hypoxico Inc., USA] served as the air source for administering intermittent oxygen-depleted air treatment (\nHayes et al., 2014\n;\nLynch et al., 2017\n;\nSandhu et al., 2019\n;\nTrumbower et al., 2017\n;\nTrumbower et al., 2012\n). The system included an onboard flow indicator for manual adjustment of FiO\n2\nbetween 10.0 \u00b1 2.0% (low O\n2\n) and 20.9 \u00b1 2.0% (room air). The system also included a closed breathing circuit to a non-rebreather mask [Universal mask; Hypoxico Inc., USA] via a HEPA filter, 3-liter expandable reservoir bags, and approximately 3 m of clear tubing per system. Expandable reservoir bags provided air storage for occasional changes in inspiration rates that exceed output flow from the generator.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nA block diagram depicts the \u2018manual\u2019 acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) delivery system for humans (\nA\n). The system includes a single pressure-swing absorber (yellow box) that generates and distributes low oxygen air through a human breathing circuit (solid red line) manually connected/disconnected to the end-user\u2019s face mask during AIH treatment. The dashed line denotes room air not supplied to humans during low O\n2\nbreathing. White open triangles point along the direction of air flow. An O\n2\nsensor near the face mask records the percentage of O\n2\nwithin the air mixture. A stand-alone patient monitor displays heart rate (HR), blood O\n2\nsaturation (SpO\n2\n), and blood pressure (BP) for safety. In\nB\n, a block diagram depicts the \u2018automated\u2019 AIH delivery system. The system includes 1) double pressure-swing absorbers (yellow boxes) that generate and distribute low O\n2\nair (solid, red line) and 2) blower that distributes room air (solid, green line) through the breathing circuit and 3) a gas mixing chamber that reduces fluctuations ins steady state O\n2\nconcentration. A microcontroller board controls two pairs of one-way solenoid valves that route air from either blower or absorbers to face mask. As shown, dashed lines denote air not supplied to human. Patient monitoring unit acquires HR, SpO\n2\n, and BP for real-time feedback to a microcontroller that maintains AIH protocols within safe limits.\nAir flow regulation:\nWe used a microcontroller [Arduino Uno SMD R3, Arduino\u00ae LLC, Italy] to control air delivery intervals during \u2018automated\u2019 AIH protocols. During \u2018manual\u2019 AIH protocols, switching between air sources often results in random errors in temporal sequencing of AIH. We eliminated this possibility using automated valve-switching where each selected solenoid valve directed air flow using 110 VAC and 10.5 watts power consumption via a microcontroller. The microcontroller timed a solid-state relay [4-channel, 5VDC relay board, SainSmart\u00ae Inc, USA] to distribute power to a either pair of four total solenoid valves [K3A462U, ASCO\u00ae Inc, USA]. Solenoid valves directed air flow within the breathing circuit. Constant flows from the PSA output (hypoxia or sham) and a fan that supplies room air at positive pressure (blower) are constantly provided. In the case of low O\n2\n(or sham) delivery, one valve delivered PSA output air to the mask and the other valve recirculated blower air to the spacious room. In the case of room air delivery, one valve delivered blower air to the mask and the other valve redirected unused low O\n2\nair to the spacious indoor environment.\nRoom air blower:\nAn 18.9 liter, high-flow air blower [PVC01A-1000W, Tacklife, USA] provided continuous positive pressure air to the breathing circuit. Using a 20-ampere variable transformer set to about 20VAC [input: 110 VAC/60 Hz, Model: TDGC2\u20132KM, Beleeb, USA], we regulated blower operating speed to produce a flow rate of 1.25 liters s\n\u22121\nto the mask. The room air blower provides continuous positive pressure of air to ease inspiration through the face mask.\nMask:\nA non-rebreather mask served as interface between subject and air delivery system [HYP-123; Hypoxico Inc., USA]. The mask included a one-way inlet valve that opened during inspiration of room air or delivery of positive pressure air from the generator. During expiration, the inlet valve closed, and a second one-way outlet valve opened to allow exhaled air to escape to surrounding environment. Air leakage at the mask reduces inspired FiO\n2\n(\nGoutorbe et al., 2013\n). To minimize this possibility, we used inflatable padding along the face mask perimeter to enclose the subject\u2019s nose and mouth, and a neoprene sleeve with Velcro\u00ae strappings to secure the mask to the subject\u2019s head.\nOxygen analyzers:\nWe used two in-line O\n2\nanalyzers to monitor and record O\n2\nconcentration within our breathing circuit. We affixed a MAX-250E galvanic, partial pressure sensor to the breathing circuit tee connector proximal to the non-rebreather mask. The sensor provided estimates of oxygen with a measurement range of 0 to 100%, a response time of 15s, and full-scale linearity \u00b1 1.0%. Using a MaxO \u00ae\n2\nanalyzer [OM25-RME, Maxtec Inc., Salt Lake City UT]. we performed a single-point calibration of this sensor at room air and ~23\u00b0C prior to each use (\nTrumbower et al., 2012\n).\nSerial data transmitted from the analyzer (1Hz) corresponded to changes in absolute O\n2\nconcentration \u00b1 0.2% error, with about 12-second settling time. To measure O\n2\nlevels during rapid transitions in air sources, we used a high-precision fiber oxygen microsensor [PM-Pst7, Presens, Regensburg, Germany]. The PM-Pst7 provided estimates of O\n2\nconcentration with a measurement range of 0 to 100%, a temporal resolution of t\n90\n= 1s, a resolution of \u00b1 0.01% at 1.0% O\n2\nand \u00b1 0.05% at 20.9% O\n2\n, and an accuracy of \u00b1 0.05% at 20.9 % O\n2\nwhen properly calibrated. The high-precision O\n2\nanalyzer [Oxy1-ST, Presens, Regensberg, Germany] transmitted these digital data to a PC at 1Hz.\nPneumotach flow sensor:\nWe used a factory-calibrated linear pneumotachometer with amplifier [sensor model: 4700, amplifier model 1100; Hans Rudolph, Shawnee, USA] to measure air flow rate. The sensor has a linear range of \u00b1 800-liter s\n\u22121\nand accuracy of \u00b1 2.0% at room air. We calibrated flow rate using integration of the analog flow signal to a fixed 3-liter volume (calibration syringe). We acquired flow rate signals using a PC-based acquisition system [Powerlab 16/30; AD Instruments, CO USA] at 1000Hz. The sensor data estimated the magnitude and frequency of variations in air flow within the breathing circuit.\nTemperature sensor:\nWe recorded temperatures of ambient room air and of our breathing circuit before and during AIH and SHAM delivery protocols. We affixed an NTC thermistor [ITC-1000F InkBird Tech Co., USA] adjacent to the O\n2\nanalyzer during recordings. The sensor provided a measurement range of \u221250 to 99\u00b0C, a resolution of 0.1\u00b0C, and accuracy of \u00b1 2.0\u00b0C. We used this sensor to estimate the magnitude of variations in air temperature at the face mask during AIH and SHAM treatments protocols.\nCardiopulmonary Monitor:\nTo ensure safety, a stand-alone cardiopulmonary monitoring system [Masimo Radical-7 and Root Platform, Masimo Corp., USA] recorded participant blood O\n2\nsaturation (SpO\n2\n), and heart rate (HR) every second, and blood pressure (BP) every five minutes. During \u2018automated\u2019 AIH delivery, we used custom PC-based control software to acquire these parameters at 1Hz via universal serial bus (USB).\n\nC. Protocols\nAIH Delivery Protocols\nThe purpose of our study protocol is to characterize the performance of the \u2018manual\u2019 system to administer AIH as compared to a novel \u2018automated\u2019 system.\nManual delivery:\nThe \u2018manual\u2019 AIH protocol requires a trained administrator to physically control the supply of air to a participant\u2019s non-rebreather facemask. We refer to \u201cmanual\u201d as the use of a protocol administrator to ensure the air delivery system hose is either physically connected to or disconnected from the facemask at alternating time intervals (\nFigure 1A\n). When the administrator connected the air generator to the facemask, the generator served as air source. When the administrator disconnected the air generator from the mask, the room served as air source, with flow driven by subject inspiration. An episode of AIH consisted of 60s or 90s bouts of generator air (nominally 10.0% or 20.9% O\n2\nconcentration) and 60s interval of room air (nominally 20.9% O\n2\nconcentration). A sequence of AIH consisted of 15 episodes of both generator and room air intervals.\nAutomated delivery:\nThe \u2018automated\u2019 delivery system provides alternating air delivery without the need for a trained administrator (\nFigure 1B\n). The system consisted of a timed solenoid-valve system that directed air alternately from the air delivery system or blower to the non-rebreather facemask. A pair of PSA generators served as the low O\n2\n(AIH) or ambient air (SHAM) source. The air blower operated as a source of positive-pressure room air during the 60s intervals. As shown in\nFigure 1B\n, these sources suppled air via a common breathing circuit. Similar to the \u2018manual\u2019 delivery protocol, the circuit included HEPA filters, a set of 3-liter expandable reservoir bags, and ~3m of clear tubing for each generator. The automated protocol also used a 6-liter mixing chamber to help reduce oscillations in FiO\n2\nduring steady-state hypoxic air flow from the generators.\nTo automate air delivery, we developed and implemented a stand-alone AIH delivery application using the C# programming language. As opposed to \u2018manual\u2019 switching between low O\n2\nand room air sources, this software application provided a user interface to command switching protocols to the airflow controller. The control software required USB-interface between the microcontroller and a laptop PC running the Windows 10\u00ae operating system. The application provided protocol adjustments, as well as acquired dose timing and physiological data to ensure safety and efficacy. The application enabled users to 1) configure physiological recordings from a patient monitor, 2) adjust duration, and frequency of low O\n2\nintervals, 3) establish safety limits that truncate or terminate low O\n2\nexposure, and 4) save/load person-specific protocol settings. Collectively, these features provide safe, consistent, and flexible AIH delivery options that are not available in current \u2018manual\u2019 systems.\nSafety Protocols\nSafely and consistently administering AIH treatment protocols is of highest priority. Regardless of delivery system, we monitored participant comfort and attention, as well as, their SpO\n2\n, HR, and BP before, during, and after AIH delivery. For \u2018manual\u2019 AIH delivery protocols, we implemented a 75% SpO\n2\nsafety limit that prompted trained personnel to remove low O\n2\nhosing from a participant\u2019s facemask until SpO\n2\nlevels returned to baseline levels. This required \u2018manual\u2019 switching between air sources based on visually inspected SpO\n2\nreadings. The \u2018automated\u2019 delivery system used real-time data acquisition and recording of SpO\n2\n, HR, and BP to eliminate the possibility of human switching and recording errors. In cases where SpO\n2\nmeasurements fell below 75%, the \u2018automated\u2019 delivery system provided one or more 60s intervals of room air until SpO\n2\nmeasurements returns to > 90%. In cases where systolic blood pressure exceeded 150 mmHg, the delivery system provided room air.\nExperimental Protocols\nWhile brief episodes of AIH appear safe and efficacious in humans (\nLynch et al., 2017\n;\nNavarrete-Opazo et al., 2016\n;\nTester et al., 2014\n;\nTrumbower et al., 2017\n;\nTrumbower et al., 2012\n), there are deficiencies in these delivery systems that may delay or prevent the technology\u2019s translation to clinic and home use. Thus, we performed a set of experiments to examine design issues related to inconsistencies in dose timing and undesired fluctuations in flow rate, and O\n2\nconcentration during \u2018manual\u2019 AIH delivery protocols. We also performed similar experiments to examine the extent to which an \u2018automated\u2019 AIH delivery system may overcome the design challenges inherent to the earlier delivery systems.\nExperiment 1: Quantifying dose timing\nThe sequence of \u2018manual\u2019 AIH treatment protocols is susceptible to human error, but the extent of this error remains unclear. In brief, the ideal dose timing of AIH consists of 15, 90s breathing episodes of oxygen-deprived air alternating with 60s intervals of room air (\nTrumbower et al., 2012\n). To deliver this sequence of concentration intervals to the participant, trained personnel physically attached and detached air-supply tubing to the participant\u2019s face mask. In experiment 1, we measured the cumulative and absolute timing errors while a trained administrator (S1) delivered a single sequence of AIH treatment (\nFigure 2A\n).\nFigure 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nQuantifying temporal accuracy during an acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) delivery protocol of 90s breathing bouts of low O\n2\nwith 60s intervals of breathing ambient room air.\nA)\nTime-dependent changes in relative O\n2\n(solid, black line) from the \u2018manual\u2019 AIH delivery system as compared to the \u2018ideal\u2019 AIH protocol (solid, gray line).\nB)\nTime-dependent changes in relative O\n2\nfrom the \u2018automated\u2019 AIH delivery system (dashed, black line) as compared to the \u2018ideal\u2019 AIH protocol (solid, gray line).\nExperiment 2: Characterizing flow rates\nAdequate flow to the face mask is important for maintaining safe and comfortable breathing during AIH treatment protocols. The PSA systems rely on pumps (e.g., vacuum) to distribute air mixtures through the breathing circuit. However, air flow from the PSA systems are oscillatory due to alternating pump phases and other mechanisms. The pulsatile air flow propagates from the generator to the face mask and varies according to generator flow settings. In experiment 2, we evaluated the amplitude and frequency of fluctuations in air flow proximal to the face mask via the \u2018manual\u2019 delivery system (one PSA with reservoir bags) that delivered 10.0% and 20.9% FiO\n2\n. We repeated these air flow measurements using the \u2018automated\u2019 system (two PSA with reservoir bags).\nExperiment 3: Characterizing fluctuation in oxygen concentrations\nAn AIH delivery system must provide consistent levels of O\n2\nto the face mask to accommodate variations in breathing (i.e., deep inhales, yawns) during AIH therapy. Breathing in low O\n2\noften triggers episodes of deep breathing to increase tissue oxygenation (\nBilo et al., 2012\n), but also may exceed the available air supplied by the \u2018manual\u2019 single PSA system. We first examined consistency in the O\n2\nsupply within and between the AIH delivery systems during quiet breathing of a study participant (S2). Similar to\nExperiment 1\n, each system delivered a sequence of AIH. We attached an O\n2\nsensor proximal to the face mask and measured O\n2\nconcentrations during the AIH sequence. We then instructed S2 to take a series of deep breaths during a single 60s bout of low O\n2\n. A similar protocol involved the use of an \u2018automated\u2019 AIH system.\n\nD. Data Analyses\nAIH dosing:\nPrecise timing and amplitude of air delivery ensure safe and reliable AIH treatments. Physical switching during \u2018manual\u2019 AIH delivery is subject to dosing accuracy and timing errors. Thus, we estimated the accuracy of our delivery systems (manual, automated) to the \u2018ideal\u2019 AIH protocol defined above. Specifically, we computed the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of the goodness-of-fit (GOF,\neq. 1\n) between delivery systems and the \u2018ideal\u2019 delivery protocol (\nHyndman and Koehler, 2006\n).\nG\nO\nF\n=\n100\n*\n(\n1\n\u2212\n\u2016\ny\n\u2212\ny\n\u02dc\n\u2016\n\u2016\ny\n\u2212\ny\n\u00af\n\u2016\n)\n(1)\nwhere \u1ef9 is the \u2018ideal\u2019 output, y is the output from either the \u2018manual\u2019 or \u2018automated\u2019 delivery system, and \u0233 is the mean of y. Timing errors corresponded to the differences between the \u2018ideal\u2019 and \u2018manual\u2019 dose time during a single AIH sequence (n = 15 low O\n2\nepisodes, n = 15 room air intervals). We computed the absolute timing error (TE\nabs\n) as the absolute incremental sum of the timing errors (\neq 2\n).\nT\nE\na\nb\ns\n=\n\u2211\ni\n=\n1\n30\n|\ny\ni\n\u2212\ny\n\u02dc\n|\n(2)\nFlow rate:\nWhile continuous air flow to the face mask ensures user comfort and stability of AIH treatment, there is potential for fluctuations in air flow within the breathing circuit that may compromise consistency of air delivery. Thus, we quantified the extent to which frequency, amplitude, and range of flow rate change during steady-state room air and low O\n2\nair delivery. We compared the peak amplitudes and ranges in measured flow rate between the AIH systems (\u2018manual\u2019, \u2018automated\u2019) and FiO\n2\n(low O\n2\nat 10.0%, ambient O\n2\nat 20.9%).\nOxygen concentrations:\nConsistent and reliable FiO\n2\nto the face mask is necessary to maintain safe and accurate AIH treatments. Fluctuations in air flow from the PSA systems contribute to fluctuations in O\n2\nconcentrations during AIH protocols, but the magnitude of these fluctuations remains unclear. Thus, we quantified the relationship between air flow to the face mask and oxygen-deprived air generated from the breathing circuit of the \u2018manual\u2019 and \u2018automated\u2019 delivery systems. A major design feature of the \u2018automated\u2019 system is the addition of a mixing chamber air from the HYP-123 generator. To examine the extent to which the mixing chamber reduced fluctuations in constant-resistance FiO\n2\n, we compared the mean absolute standard deviation (MAD) in fluctuations between the \u2018automated\u2019 delivery system (with and without the mixing chamber) and FiO\n2\n(low O\n2\nat 10.0%, ambient O\n2\nat 20.9%).\nDuring episodes of low O\n2\ndelivery, positive pressure from the PSA device ensures the AIH delivery system expels oxygen-rich air to the environment and delivers oxygen-depleted air to the breathing circuit. However, spontaneous deep breaths (e.g., yawn or sighs) and other patient specific ventilation patterns may disrupt this air separation due, in part, to pressure and/or the depletion of the available air supply by the single generator. Limited air flow from the \u2018manual\u2019 (single PSA) system during deep breathing contributes to increases in the inspiratory work of breathing and to negative pressure changes within the breathing circuit. The extent to which this vacuum may reduce generation of oxygen-depleted air needed to be characterized. Thus, we compared peak O\n2\nconcentration generated from a single versus a double PSA system while a participant (S2) performed five consecutive deep breaths at 10.0% FiO\n2\n.\nHowever, spontaneous deep breathes (e.g., yawn) may disrupt this air separation due, in part, to reduction in air volume within the breathing circuit. Limited air flow from the \u2018manual\u2019 (single PSA) system during deep breathing contributes to increases in the inspiratory work of breathing and to negative pressure changes within the breathing circuit. The extent to which this vacuum may reduce generation of oxygen-depleted air is not clear. Thus, we compared peak FiO\n2\ngenerated from a single versus a double PSA system while a participant (S2) performed five consecutive deep breaths at 10.0% FiO\n2\n.\nAir temperature:\nStable air temperature during AIH treatment is important for ensuring breathing comfort, as well as, for preserving SHAM blinding. However, the extent to which changes in O\n2\nduring AIH protocols may result in differences in air temperature when administering room air and low O\n2\nis not known. Thus, we measured air temperature within the breathing circuit during two sequences (30 episodes) of AIH and SHAM and quantified air temperature changes and compared these changes between the two air delivery methods.\n\nE. Statistical Analyses\nWe performed all statistical analyses using SPSS\u00ae 26 (IBM SPSS Inc, USA) and reported data as mean \u00b1 1 standard error (SE). Statistical significance corresponded to a p-value < 0.05. We used the Levene Test to determine homogeneity of variances between our independent factors (\nLevene, 1960\n). If variances differed (p > 0.05), we used equivalent non-parametric tests. We compared the TE\nabs\nto a null expectation of 0 (no error) using a one-sample t-test. We also compared the effects of transitioning between room air and low O\n2\non TE\nabs\nusing a two-sample t-test. To compare the effects of AIH delivery systems on amplitude and range of our peak flow rate estimates, we used a linear mixed-model with fixed effects (\nCleophas et al., 2012\n) and Bonferroni corrections for the multiple contrasts. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model provided comparison between the main effects of AIH delivery system (\u2018manual\u2019, \u2018automated\u2019) and FiO\n2\n(10.0%, 20.9%) and their interactions on fluctuation in O\n2\nand temperature within the breathing circuit."

Age-matched littermates (\nNestin\nCre/-\n::\nLrrc8a\nflox/flox\n) were used as wild-type (WT) controls. Blood pressure in mice was measured using a tail-cuff method (CODA Monitor, Kent Scientific, Torrington, CT) (\nLi et al., 2015\n;\nMa et al., 2019\n). All mice were housed in a pathogen-free environment (24 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C, 12 h light/dark cycle) with free access to standard laboratory food and water\nad libitum\n.\n\nOpen-field test\nThe open-field test was performed as we described previously (\nZhou et al., 2018\n). The test apparatus was purchased from Noldus (Boston, MA) with a size of 40 cm (length) \u00d7 40 cm (width) \u00d7 35 cm (height). Within the open-field testing area, a square of 24 cm (length) \u00d7 24 cm (width) in the center was defined as the inner zone, and the remaining space was defined as the outer zone. Mice were placed in a quiet procedure room for 30 min before starting the test. Prior to each test, 95% ethanol was used to remove any scent clues left by the previous mouse. Mice were placed at the center of the testing area and were allowed to freely move for 10 min. The travel path of each mouse was monitored by the Color GigE Camera (Noldus). Total travel distance and total time spent in inner and outer zones were analyzed using the Autotyping software (\nPatel et al., 2014\n).\n\nRotarod test\nAn accelerating rotarod apparatus was used to conduct the rotarod test (IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA). Each mouse was placed on a rotarod opposite to the rotating direction. In each trial, rotating speed started at 4 rotations/min and progressively increased to a maximum of 40 rotations/min over 300 s (\nCai et al., 2013\n;\nZhou et al., 2018\n). Each animal was given three trials at 20-min intervals. Latency to fall from the accelerating rotating rod in each mouse was automatically registered.\n\nIschemic stroke model\nThe middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) method was used to induce brain ischemia, as described previously (\nLuo et al., 2018\n). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5% in a mixture of 70% NO\n2\nand 30% O\n2\n). A nylon monofilament with a diameter of 0.16 mm was inserted to the right common carotid artery and advanced to the origin of the right middle cerebral artery. The monofilament was kept in place for 90 min and then removed to allow for reperfusion. Sham control mice were subjected to similar surgical procedures without MCAO. During the surgery, the body temperature of mice was kept at 37 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C using a heating pad. After recovery from anesthesia, mice were returned to the animal housing facility. After surgery, buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was administrated immediately to minimize postoperative pain.\nNeurological deficit was determined on a scale of 0 to 5 in mice, as reported previously (\nLonga et al., 1989\n;\nLuo et al., 2018\n). The scoring was defined as follows: 0, no observable neurological deficits; 1, failure to extend left forepaw completely (a mild focal neurological deficit); 2, circling to the left (a moderate focal neurological deficit); 3, falling to the left (a severe focal neurological deficit); 4, not walking spontaneously with a depressed level of consciousness; 5, death due to brain ischemia/reperfusion. Mice with a neurological deficit score of 4 or 5 after MCAO were excluded from analysis.\nThe infarct area in brain coronal sections was identified by staining with 1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Digital images were captured, and infarct volume was quantified using Image-J software and further analyzed according to the following formula: (contralateral hemispheric volume \u2013 ipsilateral hemispheric non infarcted volume)/(contralateral hemispheric volume \u00d7 2) (\nLuo et al., 2018\n;\nSwanson et al., 1990\n).\n\nImmunoblotting\nWhile the mice were under deep anesthesia with 2\u20133% isoflurane, the forebrains of sham control and MCAO mice were removed quickly. The cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum were dissected separately and homogenated in cold RIPA buffer with a 1% protease inhibitor cocktail to extract proteins. Fifty \u03bcg proteins from each sample were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in tris-buffered saline buffer at room temperature for 1 hour, and then precipitated with mouse anti-LRRC8A (1:1000, #SAB1412855, Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-Spectrin alpha chain (1:500, #MAB1622, Millipore Corporation), rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175) (1:1000, #9661, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), or rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:2000, #5174, Cell Signaling Technology). The LRRC8A antibody targeted the amino acid sequence from 711 to 810 at the C-terminus of the mouse LCRR8A protein. Immunoblots were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), quantified using an Odyssey Fc Imager (LICOR, Lincoln, NE), and normalized using the GAPDH band on the same blot (\nLuo et al., 2018\n).\n\nBrain slice preparation and whole-cell recordings\nBrain slices were prepared as described previously (\nLuo et al., 2018\n). Mice were decapitated under deep anesthesia with 2\u20133% isoflurane. The brain was quickly removed and placed to an ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) pre-saturated with 95% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\n. The aCSF contained (in mM): 126.0 NaCl, 3.0 KCl, 1.5 MgCl\n2\n, 2.4 CaCl\n2\n, 1.2 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 10.0 glucose, and 26.0 NaHCO\n3\n(315 \u00b1 5 mOsm). Transversal hippocampus brain slices of 300-\u03bcm thickness were sectioned using a microtome (Leica Microsystems Inc.) and then incubated in aCSF for 1 hour at 34\u00b0C before further experiments. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons were visualized under an upright microscope equipped with infrared and differential interference contrast optics (BX51W1, Olympus). Recording pipette resistance was 4\u20136 M\u2126 when filled with internal solutions. All external solutions were continually saturated with 95% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\nand perfused at 3 ml/min.\nVRAC-mediated chloride current, I\nVRAC,\nin brain slices was recorded as reported previously (\nInoue and Okada, 2007\n). Cell membrane potential was held at \u221240 mV, and step voltage was applied from \u2212100 mV to +100 mV in 20-mV increments. The I\nVRAC\nwas isolated using DCPIB, a specific VRAC blocker (\nDecher et al., 2001\n). DCPIB was bath applied via a syringe pump with a final concentration of 30 \u03bcM (\nWang et al., 2017\n). The internal solution contained (in mM) 120 NMDG, 120 gluconic acid, 4 MgCl\n2\n, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 5 Na\n2\n-ATP, and 0.3 Na-GTP (pH adjusted to 7.25\u20137.27 with NMDG; 296 \u00b1 5 mOsm). The external solution contained (in mM) 80 choline-Cl, 20 tetraethyl ammonium chloride, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2 4-aminopyridine, 4 MgCl\n2\n, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 11 glucose, 0.0005 tetrodotoxin (TTX), and 50 mannitol (310 \u00b1 5 mOsm). To record I\nVRAC\nin oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions, we treated brain slices with an OGD solution for 5 min followed by a 10-min recovery in normal aCSF. The OGD external solution contained (in mM) 126.0 NaCl, 3.0 KCl, 1.5 MgCl\n2\n, 2.4 CaCl\n2\n, 1.2 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 10.0 sucrose, and 26.0 NaHCO\n3\n(315 \u00b1 5 mOsm) continuously gassed with 95% N\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n(\nLuo et al., 2018\n). The recording signal was processed through a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, filtered at 1 kHz, and digitized by DigiData 1440 at 20 kHz (Molecular Devices). Series resistance was monitored continuously throughout recording processes. Data were not included for analysis if series resistance changed >20%.\nSpontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were recorded using whole-cell voltage-clamp mode. Cell membrane potential was held at \u221260 mV (\nChen and Pan, 2006\n;\nHuang et al., 2019\n;\nLi et al., 2008\n). The pipette internal solution contained the following (in mM) 135.0 K-gluconate, 5.0 tetraethyl ammonium, 2.0 MgCl\n2\n, 0.5 CaCl\n2\n, 5.0 HEPES, 5.0 EGTA, 5.0 Mg-ATP, 0.5 Na-GTP, and 10 lidocaine N-ethyl bromide (adjusted to pH 7.2\u20137.4 with 1 mol/L KOH; 290\u2013300 mOsm). QX314 was included to block voltage-gated sodium channels. The sEPSCs were recorded in isotonic and hypotonic external solutions (\nFiacco et al., 2007\n;\nLauderdale et al., 2015\n). Isotonic external solution contained (in mM) 80 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.4 CaCl\n2\n, 1.3 MgCl\n2\n, 1.3 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 10 glucose, and 90 mannitol (315 \u00b1 5 mOsm). Hypotonic external solution contained (in mM) 80 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.4 CaCl\n2\n, 1.3 MgCl\n2\n, 1.3 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, and 10 glucose (260 \u00b1 5 mOsm).\nTTX and 6,7-dinitro-2,3-dihydroxyquinoxaline (DNQX) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. QX-314 and DCPIB were purchased from Tocris. DCPIB was dissolved with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and the final concentration of DMSO was 0.05% in the bath solution. DNQX and TTX were dissolved with deionized water to make stock solutions and then diluted with the perfusion solution in electrophysiological experiments.\n\nData analysis\nAll data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. The frequency and amplitude of sEPSCs were analyzed offline using a peak detection program (MiniAnalysis; Synaptosoft, Leonia, NJ) (\nGuo et al., 2013\n;\nZhu et al., 2016\n). Whole-cell VRAC currents were analyzed with Clampfit 9.2 software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA), and DCPIB-sensitive VRAC currents were obtained by digitally subtracting VRAC currents recorded in the presence of DCPIB from VRAC currents recorded without DCPIB. A two-tailed Student t test was used for comparison between two groups, and one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Bonferroni post-hoc test was used to determine differences among three or more groups. Repeated measures ANOVA with the Dunnett\u2019s post-hoc test was performed to determine differences at different time points within the same group. All statistical analyses were performed using Prism software (version 7; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "2.1. Mouse strains\nThe CDKL5 R59X knock-in (\nCdkl5\nR59X\n) (\nTang et al., 2019\n) and\nCdkl5\nknockout (\nCdkl5\nKO\n) (\nWang et al., 2012\n) lines, which are also available from Jackson Laboratories (\nCdkl5\nR59X\n: Stock No. 028856;\nCdkl5\nKO\n: Stock No. 021967), were obtained as a generous gift from the Zhou Lab at the University of Pennsylvania. Briefly, colonies of\nCdkl5\nR59X\nand\nCdkl5\nKO\nmice were maintained by breeding heterozygous female breeders from each line (\nCdkl5\nR59X\n/+ or\nCdkl5\nKO\n/+) to wild type C57BL/6 J mice. The resulting mutant female offspring (\nCdkl5\nR59X\n/+ or\nCdkl5\nKO\n/+) and their respective wild type littermates (+/+), were used for experiments.\n\n2.2. Animal husbandry\nExperiments were conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All methods were in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Mice were group-housed in cages of two to five in a twelve-hour light/dark cycle with food and water provided ad libitum. All progeny was genotyped either with the previously reported PCR strategies or with quantitative PCR by Transnetyx, Inc. (\nTang et al., 2019\n;\nWang et al., 2012\n). Heterozygous female littermates (+/+,\nCdkl5\nR59X\n/+,\nCdkl5\nKO\n/+) were weaned at 3 weeks of age and housed together. After EEG electrode implantation surgery, mice were individually housed and kept on a 12 h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water.\n\n2.3. Four-channel EEG implantation surgery\nExperiments were conducted in accordance with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. EEG recording was performed as previously described (\nKahn et al., 2019\n). Mice were stereotaxically implanted with an electrode assembly under continuous isoflurane anesthesia. The electrode assembly consisted of 6 leads: 2 surface electrodes attached to miniature skull screws placed over the left and right frontal cortices (from Bregma: A/P \u2212 1.2 mm, M/L \u00b1 1.1 mm); a double-depth electrode in right hippocampus (A/P \u2212 2.2 mm, M/L + 1.2 mm, D/V \u2212 1.3 mm); and finally a reference and a ground electrode directly behind Lambda on either side of midline. Teflon-coated silver wires (0.13 mm diameter) were attached to each electrode and connected to a 6-pin pedestal (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA). The entire assembly was secured on the skull with dental cement (Ortho-Jet, Lang Dental, Wheeling, IL). All surgeries were performed by an experimenter blinded to genotype.\n\n2.4. Eight-channel EEG implantation surgery\nElectroencephalographic mouse studies were performed as previously described (\nMarsh et al., 2009\n;\nSimonet et al., 2015\n). The implant procedure, under ketamine/xylazine and isoflurane anesthesia, consisted of the stereotaxic placement of 8 electrodes (hippocampal, bilateral parietal, bilateral motor, bilateral visual electrodes) using the following coordinates (from Bregma \u2013 Bilateral motor: 0.5 mm Anterior-Posterior (A-P) and 1.0 mm medial-lateral (M-L); bilateral parietal: \u22120.7 mm A-P, 3.0 mm M-L; bilateral visual \u22123.5 A-P, 2.0 mm M-L; hippocampus: \u22122.2 mm A-P, 2.0 mm M-L, and 1.7 mm ventral). All electrodes were produced by attaching 125 \u03bcM silver wire (78,600, A-M Systems) to a 10-channel Omnetics nanoconnector (AP8393\u2013001, Omnetics Corp). Electrodes were placed after drilling 1 mm (0.6 mm Drill Bit cat no.39416022 Lecia) holes at each stereotaxic location, with cortical electrodes placed at the superficial cortical surface. The electrodes were covered with dental cement which attached the connector to the head. After 24\u201348 h of recovery in their home cage the animals were transferred to the monitoring cage and recorded using a 32-channel Intan extracellular amplifier (RHD2000 USB Interface Board, Intan Technologies) using either DataWave software or importing the raw data into Matlab. The recordings were sampled at 2000 Hz, with no on-line filtering. Electrode impedances were tested prior to all recordings. All animals were recorded for at least 72 h.\n\n2.5. Video-EEG recording\nA flexible cable connected each animals headcap assembly to a commutator thus allowing the mouse to move freely during the recordings. Mice were given at least 72 h post-surgery to recover prior to being placed in a recording cage and were acclimatized for at least 72 h before recording initiation. Video-monitored EEG recordings of awake and behaving mice were performed in custom-made Plexiglas cages using a Stellate Harmonie acquisition interface (Natus Medical, Pleasanton, CA) and sampled at 200 Hz in a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water provided ad libitum. Wild type,\nCdkl5\nR59X\n/+, and\nCdkl5\nKO\n/+ mice were randomized and placed into cohorts of four individual cages monitored by a single video camera, and each grouped cohort underwent video-EEG recording during the same period. All experimenters were blinded to genotype throughout the video-EEG recording process.\n\n2.6. Video-EEG data interpretation\nAll video-EEG interpretation and analysis were performed by an experimenter blinded to genotype. EEG signals were reviewed in Stellate Browser (Stellate Systems, Inc., Montreal, Canada). For each animal, three consecutive days of 24 h EEG monitoring from Day 7 \u2013 Day 11 relative to the beginning of the recording period were randomly selected and reviewed by a blinded reviewer.\n\n2.7. Manual seizure detection\nPrior to analysis, all EEG traces were pre-processed with the application of a 0.1 Hz high-pass filter, 70 Hz low-pass filter, and 60 Hz notch filter. Cortical channels were viewed at a scale 30\u201375 \u03bcV/mm, and hippocampal channels were viewed at a scale of 30\u201350 \u03bcV/mm. Sixty seconds of EEG were viewed in each frame. A blinded reviewer systematically screened the entirety of each EEG trace for large-amplitude, bilaterally synchronous slow-wave, spike-wave, sharp-wave, polyspike-wave, or spike/sharp activity. For each EEG event, time-locked video was used to assess for the presence of motor activity. Motor activity was considered typical of an epileptic spasm if it was 1) sudden-onset during a period of relative immobility, 2) a single, brief spasm involving limbs and/or trunk, and 3) temporally time-locked with the ictal event of interest (i.e. occurring concurrently with or immediately after the onset of the waveform). Only events with both typical ictal EEG waveforms and motor activity were considered epileptic spasms. Three days of EEG were reviewed to determine the presence or absence of spasms (for days without spasms, the entire 24 h period was examined). For animals that showed spasms on more than one of the three days reviewed, one day was randomly selected, and the total number of spasms was quantified by a reviewer.\n\n2.8. Automated seizure detection\nWe adopted a previously published detector for synchronous spiking (\nAhrens-Nicklas et al., 2019\n). We applied this detector to a 24 h period of EEG for each mouse in our study during Day 8 relative to the start of recording. This spike detection algorithm examined non-overlapping 5 min segments of intracranial EEG data from bilateral cortical screws. The segments were initially notch filtered at 60 Hz and bandpass filtered from 1 to 70 Hz. An initial amplitude threshold of 300 \u03bcV was applied to ensure that we only captured high-amplitude spiking events. We then applied a 5-standard deviation threshold to the absolute value of the 5 min segment to screen for spikes. Peaks found within 0.025 s (5 samples) of each other were considered to be the same event. Video was not used to curate events captured by this algorithm. We thank Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas for their validated code structure, which we modified for this analysis.\n\n2.9. Background EEG analysis\nEEG signals were processed offline for the purpose of power spectral density analyses. Power spectral analyses were performed using custom written MATLAB code. For all analyses, frequency bands were separated into delta (0.1\u20134 Hz), theta (4\u20138 Hz), alpha (8\u201313 Hz), beta (13\u201325 Hz), and gamma (25\u201350 Hz) ranges. The relative power for each frequency band was calculated by dividing the absolute power for each frequency by the total power and then normalizing it with a log transformation to allow comparisons between mice. To examine changes in power spectral density associated with seizure clusters, power spectral analysis was performed during a 24 h period on one cortical and one hippocampal channel, using epochs of five minutes. For assessment of the correlation between delta power and spasm occurrence, delta power values in one hippocampal channel across a 24 h period for each mouse was transformed to a list of z-scores. Each z-score was calculated as\n(x \u2013 \u03bc) / \u03c3\n, where\nx\nis delta power for a specific epoch,\n\u03bc\nis the overall mean delta power during the enclosing 24 h period, and\n\u03c3\nis the sample standard deviation of the delta power during the 24 h period. The distribution of z-scores during spasms was then compared to the overall distribution of delta power during the enclosing 24 h period. To assess overall differences in background power between wild type and\nCdkl5\nmutant mice, ten ten-minute segments were randomly sampled and analyzed from each of the light and dark cycles from Day 8 relative to the start of recording. We modified the analysis, including fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), from a previous publication (\nAhrens-Nicklas et al., 2019\n). Our custom MATLAB code can be found on Github (\nhttps://github.com/mulcaheyp/cdkl5_2020\n).\n\n2.10. Statistical analysis\nBecause this is the first systematic study of spontaneous seizures in mouse models of CDD, no estimate of spontaneous seizure incidence or frequency was available in literature. We pre-determined our sample size at approximately 8 mice per genotype, which would be sufficient to detect epilepsy in multiple mice as long as the incidence was at least 25% in each of the mutant lines. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad). All data sets were analyzed using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality. Data sets with normal distributions were analyzed for significance using the unpaired Students\nt-\ntest, whereas data sets with non-normal distributions were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. For comparisons of spasm occurrence and spasm burden, one-tailed Mann-Whitney tests were performed with Holm's correction for multiple comparisons. For power spectral analysis, two-way ANOVA was performed with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test. Graphs are plotted using Prism (GraphPad). In our figures,\np\n-values between 0.05 and 0.1 are shown explicitly, * is used to denote all 0.01 <\np\n< .05, ** for 0.001 <\np\n< .01, *** for 0.0001 <\np\n< .001, and **** for\np\n< .0001."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll procedures followed National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. Male Wistar rats \u22656 weeks of age (Hsd:WI, Stock 001, Envigo, Indianapolis, IN, USA) upon entrance into the experiment, initially weighing 150\u2013200 g; were double housed in a room maintained at 21\u201324 \u00b0C and a 12:12-h light\u2013dark cycle with food and water provided\nad libitum\n.\n\nSurgical procedures and post-operative care\nRats (n=45) were randomly assigned for SCI or surgical control surgery and each group was further divided into 3-day and 3-week postsurgical study groups. After being deeply anesthetized with 3\u20135% mixture of Isoflurane with oxygen (400\u2013600ml/min), surgery for T3-contusion SCI was performed using established surgical techniques as previously described in detail (\nWhite et al., 2018\n). Briefly, upon completion of surgical exposure of the T2 laminectomy site, the adjacent T1 and T3 vertebrae were clamped into the Infinite Horizons SCI device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Lexington KY) and a 300 kDyne impact (15 sec dwell time) was initiated. Surgical controls underwent all procedures except for the spinal impact.\nPost-operatively, rats were administered supplemental fluids by injection of 5cc warmed lactated Ringer\u2019s solution (s.c.) and stabilized in an incubator (37\u00b0C) until fully recovered from anesthesia. Animals were monitored daily for any signs of infection or complications from surgery. Body weight (bw) and food intake were measured daily for all animals as an index of well-being and rats were administered post-operative care as previously described (\nWhite et al., 2018\n).\n\nColonic and spinal tissue harvest\nDeeply anesthetized rats were exsanguinated via decapitation. For each animal, colonic tissue (proximal and distal) was isolated and immediately placed in ice-cold aerated Krebs solution (10 ml min\n\u22121\n; mmol l\n\u22121\n: NaCl, 121; KCl, 5.9; CaCl\n2\n, 2.5; MgCl\n2\n, 1.2; NaHCO\n3\n, 25; NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.2; and glucose 8; aerated with 95%O\n2\n/5%CO\n2\n; all chemicals purchased from Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Nifedipine (5 \u03bcM; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to all bath solutions to block smooth muscle contractile activity. The distal colon was rapidly dissected in cold Krebs by cutting along the mesenteric border and pinned flat. Next, the mucosal and submucosal layers were removed to expose the circular muscle layer. A 2\u20133cm portion of the smooth muscle tissue was excised and transferred to a Sylgard-lined recording chamber of our own design. The smooth muscle was then perfused with warmed (ca. 35\u00b0C) aerated Krebs and remained undisturbed for 1 hour before recordings were initiated.\nAn additional 5mm intact section of distal and proximal colon tissue was immediately post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours and then transferred to 70% ethanol for an additional 24 hours prior to paraffin embedding. For whole mount preparations for immunohistochemistry, the remaining distal and proximal tissue samples were immediately placed in ice-cold aerated Krebs before being opened along the mesenteric border and pinned flat. The mucosal and submucosal layers were removed and the tissue fixed\nin situ\nin 4% paraformaldehyde.\nThe vertebrae and spinal cord at the level of the lesion were removed\nen bloc\nand postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Following fixation, the spinal cord was extracted from the vertebrae for sectioning and histological processing of T3-SCI lesion extent.\n\nElectrophysiological recording\nIntracellular recordings from individual smooth muscle cells were obtained using glass microelectrodes pulled with a Flaming/Brown Micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, p-97, Novato, CA), filled with 2 M KCl, and that had resistances ranging from 80 to 120 M\u03a9. A Nikon TMZ inverted microscope was used at 200\u00d7 magnification to visualize the smooth muscle cells of the circular muscle layer. Voltage recordings were obtained with an Axoclamp-2A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA), and signals digitized and analyzed with Spike2 (version 8.01; Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, England). Smooth muscle cells were impaled at random. Impalements were accepted if 1) the membrane potential was \u221235 mV or lower and 2) if the recording was stable for at least 5 minutes.\nFor intracellular recordings of IJPs, the tissue was pinned so that the oral aspect of the colon was positioned perpendicularly relative to two parallel silver/silver chloride wire electrodes connected to a stimulus isolation unit (SIU5, Grass Instruments, Quincy, MA) driven by a two-channel stimulator (S88, Grass Instruments). Due to the polarity of the descending inhibitory motor neurons, evoked inhibitory junction potentials (IJPs) were recorded aborally to the transmural stimulating electrodes. The aboral aspect was pinned flat within the recording region of the chamber to expose the circular muscle layer for recording electrodes. The tissue was immediately and continuously exposed to warmed and aerated circulating Krebs solution and allowed to equilibrate for 1 hour. For intracellular recordings of EJPs, the tissue was pinned so that the aboral aspect of the tissue was positioned over the stimulating electrodes and the oral aspect was pinned flat within the recording region of the chamber. The recording region of the chamber for all intracellular recordings was 7\u201310mm from the stimulating electrodes.\nFor IJP recording experiments, atropine (1 \u03bcM; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the circulating Krebs solution to block spontaneous and evoked cholinergic activation of smooth muscle. In order to isolate the nitrergic (slow IJP) and purinergic (fast IJP) components, two separate solutions were prepared. Both preparations comprised of 200 mL of Krebs solution containing nifedipine (5 \u03bcM) and atropine (1 \u03bcM). For the isolation of the nitrergic component, one Krebs solution also contained MRS-2179 (3 \u03bcM; Sigma-Aldrich) to block the P2Y\n1\npurinergic receptors. To isolate the purinergic component, the Krebs solution contained N-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; 100 \u03bcM; Sigma-Aldrich) to block nitric oxide synthase.\nFor EJP recording experiments, separate stock solutions of MRS-2179 (3 \u03bcM) or L-NNA (100 \u03bcM; both from Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared with the addition of nifedipine to the circulating Krebs solution to block spontaneous and evoked purinergic and nitrergic activation, respectively, of smooth muscle.\nTransmural stimuli (55 ms pulse duration, 0.1 Hz, 50V) were used to activate junction potentials. For IJPs, once consistent baseline responses were established and recorded, the circulating Krebs solution was changed to the MRS-2179 containing solution. Effects of the MRS-2179 could be seen approximately 2\u20133 minutes after its circulation began. Once the fast component was fully blocked, the slow nitrergic IJP response (sIJP) was recorded for approximately 10 minutes. At completion of recording the sIJP signal, the bath solution containing MRS-2179 was then returned to the normal recording Krebs solution. After return of the complete IJP response (10\u201330 minutes) the normal recording Krebs solution was switched for the L-NNA containing solution. Due to the irreversible inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis by L-NNA (\nDwyer et al., 1991\n), the effects of L-NNA were always tested last. Effects of the L-NNA could be seen starting within 1\u20132 minutes of its circulation, however, its full effect could not be appreciated until approximately 10 minutes. As with the MRS-2179, once it was determined that the sIJP component was fully blocked, the purinergic response was recorded for approximately 10 minutes. During the recording of EJPs, the stock Krebs solution was first utilized in order to record IJPs as evidence of tissue viability. Once the tissue was deemed acceptable, the MRS-2179 + L-NNA solution was introduced and EJPs were randomly recorded. Due to the nature of EJP recordings (in which all other activity is blocked), tissue recordings were only attempted across a two-hour period of time. In order to validate that the tissue remained viable after two-hours, the stock Krebs solution was returned to the chamber. Following sufficient washout of the MRS-2179, the tissue was deemed viable if a fIJP could be elicited.\nAt the completion of the recordings, the maximum amplitude for the appropriate junction potential was calculated. For each animal, 10 data points for each component were randomly selected. The 10 randomly selected data points were then averaged for each animal.\n\nHistological processing of spinal cord\nThe spinal cord encompassing the lesion epicenter was embedded in OCT and sectioned at 40 \u03bcm thick with a cryostat. Alternate coronal sections were mounted onto gelatin-coated slides. To verify lesion severity or control, spinal cord sections were stained with luxol fast blue (LFB) to visualize myelinated fibers.\nLFB-stained slides were digitally imaged on a Zeiss Axioscope light microscope and Axiocam CCD camera, imported into Adobe Photoshop and contrast digitally enhanced to allow identification and threshold measurements of LFB-stained (i.e., spared) white matter. For individual images, the boundaries of the tissue slice were outlined to determine cross-sectional area. A separate threshold histogram was generated and the pixels corresponding to LFB staining above background were selected. These pixels were quantified and expressed per unit cross-sectional area (\nNoble & Wrathall, 1985\n). The proximity of the T3 lesion center to the cervical enlargement precluded an appropriate determination of spinal cord cross-sectional area in undamaged tissue rostral to the injury (i.e., damaged tissue extended into the cervical enlargement as described in\nTong & Holmes, 2009\n). Therefore, it was necessary that the cross-sectional area of the intact spinal cords at T3 of comparably sized animals be determined for normalization purposes. LFB-stained myelin in injured tissue was then expressed as a percent of the total spinal cord cross-sectional area as would be predicted by the intact tissue. Based upon previous reports (\nScheff et al., 2003\n;\nTong et al., 2011\n;\nTotoiu & Keirstead, 2005\n) we determined\na priori\nthat animals sacrificed 3 days following surgery in which LFB staining at the lesion epicenter accounted for \u2264 25% of the region occupied by white matter would be categorized as having received a severe spinal injury; those with \u2265 25% LFB staining were excluded from further analysis (n=1 T3-SCI rat met this criterion). This criterion is based upon the observation that considerable LFB-staining remains within the lesion center in the 1\u20133 days following injury, though the majority of the LFB-stained tissue likely consists of remaining myelinated axons as well as myelin debris in a loose fibrous matrix as reported previously (\nTotoiu et al., 2005\n). Historically, our animals with the same 300 kDyne injury that are sacrificed 3 weeks after injury display \u2264 5% of LFB staining above threshold as the lesion center is clear of cellular debris. After 3 weeks any remaining LFB staining is usually confined to a thin band within the ventrolateral white matter in a manner consistent with previous reports characterizing a 200 kDyne injury level (\nScheff et al., 2003\n).\n\nColonic tissue processing for immunohistochemistry\nFixed tissue samples from the colon were processed in an automated Tissue-Tek VIP processor and paraffin-embedded with a Tissue-Tek TEC embedding station (Sakura Finetek USA, Torrance, CA). Sections were serially cross-sectioned at 6 \u03bcm and processed for enteric neuronal immunohistochemistry. Following deparaffinization and rehydration (including a peroxidase wash to quench endogenous peroxidases), samples were taken and subjected to heat-mediated antigen retrieval in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer for 20 minutes. Non-specific antibody binding was reduced by incubation in UltraVision Protein Block (TA060PBQ; Thermo Scientific) for 5 minutes at room temperature. The sections were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature in a primary antibody cocktail containing either Hu/CD, nNOS or ChAT antibody and 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA; dilutions in\nTable 1\n). Following the incubation, the tissue underwent three 2 minute washes in wash buffer and then incubated in a secondary antibody cocktail (\nTable 1\n) for 1 hour at room temperature. Labeling was localized using diaminobenzadine (DAB) and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.\nTable 1.\nPrimary and secondary antibodies, and their respective dilutions, used for immunohistochemistry\nHost species\nDilution\nSource\nPrimary antibodies\nnNOS\nGoat\n1:1000\nAbcam\nChAT\nRabbit\n1:2000\nAbcam\nSecondary antibodies\nAnti-goat\nIgG-Peroxidase\nRabbit\n1:100\nSigma-Aldrich\nAnti-rabbit\nIgG-Peroxidase\nGoat\n1:100\nSigma-Aldrich\nOpen in a new tab\nUsing a previously described protocol to determine the number of neurons per enteric ganglion area (\nRivera et al., 2014\n), images of ChAT and nNOS positive ganglia from each tissue section were analyzed using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Immunopositive neurons were determined by the density of staining above a pre-determined threshold intensity. All specimens were scored according to the same threshold level and were scored blinded to group identity. Individual ganglia demonstrate variable cross-sectional size within the intact myenteric plexus and this might be reflected in what region of the ganglion appears in the plane of section. While reduction of ganglion area could be expected as a result of neuronal loss, differences in cross sectional area are deemed to be a greater source of variability. To normalize quantification of the number of neurons, total ganglion area was measured (as \u03bcm\n2\n) and the number of ChAT or nNOS positive neurons within the designated ganglion area were counted and calculated as the number of neurons per unit area.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe occurrence of outliers was tested using a Grubbs test macro written in GraphPad (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). No significant outliers were identified for removal from further analysis. Tissue unresponsive to transmural electrical field stimulation was considered to be a non-viable smooth muscle recording preparation (n=4 preparations).\nAll subsequent statistical calculations were performed using SigmaPlot software (version 12.5; Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Between groups results from anatomical or\nex vivo\nstudies were compared by Student\u2019s T-test or ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc analysis as appropriate. Results are expressed as means \u00b1 SEM with significance defined as\nP\n<0.05."

    "Methods": "Animal Care\nAll procedures and experiments were approved by the Georgia Institute of Technology Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee or the Wright State University Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee. Adult female rats (250\u2013350g) were studied in terminal experiments only and were not subject to any other experimental procedures. All animals were housed in clean cages and provided food and water ad libitum in a temperature- and light-controlled environment.\n\nChemotherapy treatment\nOxaliplatin (OX) was injected i.p. once a week (10mg/Kg, 1 ml 5% dextrose in DMSO ) to achieve a cumulative dose of 70 mg/Kg over 7 weeks (\nFig. 1a\n), which scales to a human dose of 420mg/m\n2\n(conversion based on rat body surface area and K\nm\n= 6)\n16\n,\n17\n. This dose minimizes nerve degeneration in patients\n18\n,\n19\n. Throughout treatment, rats were frequently monitored for pain or distress\n8\n. No individual rat reached set criteria established for early removal from the study.\nFigure 1.\nIn Silico\nMotoneuron Model.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Shows the ten-state model Na channel model. The green vertical arrows represent transitions to fast-inactivated states, whereas the red horizontal arrows represent transitions to slow-inactivated states. IFT represents the total occupancy of all fast-inactivated states whereas IST represents that of the slow-inactivated states. Shows the steady-state occupancy of the open (B), fast-activated (C) and slow-inactivated states (D) as a function of membrane voltage. The black lines represent the features of the standard model, the blue and green lines represent changes in fast-inactivation process produced by hyperpolarizing the fast-inactivation voltage-dependence by either 5 (blue) or 10 mV (green). The red lines represent changes in state occupancy produced by doubling the rate at which slow-inactivated states are entered. Note that the steady-state persistent Na current (open state occupancy) is nearly identical for the 10mV shift in fast-inactivation and for the faster entry into the slow-inactivated states. However, this state-state is reached at different rates in the two cases.\n\nIn Vivo Surgical Procedures and Intracellular Recordings\nTerminal\nin vivo\nexperiments were performed 5 weeks after achieving clinically relevant chemotherapy doses\n8\n,\n9\n. Experiments were designed to measure the electrical properties and firing characteristics of individual motoneurons\nin vivo\n. Surgical and recording techniques used in these studies have been described in previously published reports from this laboratory\n7\n,\n20\n\u2013\n23\n.\nBriefly, data were collected from medial gastrocnemius motoneurons (MG) in rats anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane (1.2\u20131.5% mixed in 100% O2) and fixed in a rigid recording frame. Properties of MG were measured by intracellular recording with glass microelectrodes (K-acetate, 5\u201310 M\u03a9). Microelectrodes were advanced through the dorsal spinal cord until antidromic APs, generated by electrical stimulation of the medial gastrocnemius nerve (0.04-ms pulses, 1 Hz), were identified in the microelectrode voltage records. All recordings were performed using an Axoprobe 1A (Sunnyvale, CA) amplifier in either bridge or DCC mode. APs were initiated in MG motoneurons by injecting suprathreshold depolarizing current (square pulses lasting \u2265100 ms) directly into motoneuron soma within the spinal cord. Intracellular measures were recorded or derived to characterized the intrinsic excitability of MG motoneuron: a series of antidromic action potentials (APs), a series of 50-ms current pulses of different amplitude to determine rheobase, a series of 1-ms, suprathreshold current pulses were applied to elicit direct APs and afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs), followed by a series of \u00b15 nA, 500-ms current steps to measure input resistance. Motoneuron firing rates in response to microelectrode current injection were used to measure the gain of the motoneuron frequency-current relation (f-I slope)\n24\n. Repetitive firing during 5-s pulses was assessed at several different levels of current. These parameters reflect the translation of current into firing rates by motoneurons and are standard indices of the intrinsic excitability of motoneurons. Respiratory and cardiac movement artifact of the rats sometimes made it difficult to maintain stable somatic penetrations. Therefore, a paralytic agent (pancuronium bromide) was occasionally administered intraperitoneally, and paralysis was maintained throughout the experiment.\n\nBayesian data analysis\nStatistical techniques used in these studies have been described in a previously published report from this laboratory\n25\n. Briefly, analyses focused on motoneuron spiking probability, firing characteristics, and rate-modulation for both OX and control groups. Because of inconsistent spiking behavior in OX motoneurons, all analyses utilized 20ms temporal bins in order to effectively characterize extended periods without spiking activity. Traditional analyses focused on interspike intervals underestimate information loss by counting these periods as one event whereas control motoneurons frequently had many tens or hundreds of events. Applying this approach to control motoneuron populations reproduces the expected behavior seen previously in multiple reports, giving confidence in its validity\n26\n\u2013\n29\n. We employed Bayesian models to compute parameters in order to explicitly test our working hypothesis that OX chronically impairs motor unit function. We empirically derived the full joint posterior probability distributions of model parameters simultaneously and directly examined the posterior distributions\n30\n\u2013\n32\n, imparting noteworthy advantages over frequentist analysis\n31\n\u2013\n33\n. Bayesian inference was performed by inspecting the highest density interval (HDI), such that values inside the 95% of the HDI are more credible than outside values\n33\n.\nHDI was used to make unbiased decisions on parameter values. All models were developed in fully Bayesian framework with the\nrstanarm\npackage (2.18.1)\n34\nin the R environment (3.5.0)\n35\n. For intercepts and predictors, we use Student\u2019s\nt-\ndistribution with mean zero and four degrees of freedom as the prior distribution. The scale of the prior distribution is 10 for the intercept and 2.5 for the predictors. Each model was run with four independent chains for 1,000 warm-up and 4,000 sampling steps. For all parameters, the number of effective samples was >500. Convergence was assessed and assumed to have reached the stationary distribution by ensuring that the Gelman\u2013Rubin shrinkage statistic for all reported parameters was <1.05\n36\n. We report the expected mean parameter values alongside 95% credible intervals using (HDI).\n\nIn Silico Motoneuron Experiments\nWe used a single compartment model of a rat motor neuron implemented in NEURON 7.6 to simulate the behavior of motoneurons from control animals and those treated with OX. The model was similar to those described in Golomb et al. (2007)\n37\nand Sciamanna and Wilson (2011)\n38\n, in that the critical components controlling the pattern of discharge were a slowly-inactivating, low threshold Kv1 current, a fast Na current that included a variable persistent component and a small amount of noise\n39\n. The model also contained a delayed rectifier K current responsible for AP repolarization, a calcium-activated K current responsible for the afterhyperpolarization, a hyperpolarization-activated mixed cation current and a leak conductance. Details of the model will be made available on the MODELDB website (\nhttps://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/\n). In our model, the Hodgkin-Huxley-type Na model used by Golomb et al. (2007)\n37\nand Sciamanna and Wilson(2011)\n38\nwas replaced by a ten-state kinetic gating model adapted from the eight-state model described by Schmidt-Hieber and Bischofberger (2010)\n40\nby adding two slow inactivated states; one entered from the open state and one from a fast-inactivated state. Variations in the amount of persistent Na current (i.e., the proportion of channels in the open state under steady-state conditions) were produced either by changing the rate at which channels entered the fast-inactivated states by changing the voltage dependence of fast-inactivation (green arrows in\nFig 1A\n) or by changing the rate of entry into slow-inactivated states (red arrows in\nFig 1A\n).\nFigure 1B\n\u2013\nD\nshows the effects of a 5 mV (blue) or 10 mV (green) hyperpolarizing shift in fast inactivation or a doubling of the rate of entry into slow inactivated states (red) on the steady-state voltage dependence of the proportion of channels in the open state (B), fast-inactivated states (C) and slow inactivated states (D). In addition, we then systematically varied the maximal Kv1 conductance along with the level of injected current to reveal regions in parameter space associated with irregular firing (coefficients of variation of interspike intervals (ISI)> 0.2; values for motor neurons are typically <0.229. For a given combination of conductance values we sampled a wide distribution of current levels (1nA apart) to best validate model performance on the distribution of experimental recordings."

    "Methods": "Human subjects and ethics statement\nAll human studies described in this paper were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Mayo Clinic, and the patient\u2019s parents gave informed consent for the patient to participate in the study. The investigation was carried out in accordance with the code of ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments.\n\nStructural studies\nIntercostal muscle specimens were obtained from the patient and from control subjects without muscle disease undergoing thoracic surgery. The endplates (EPs) were localized for electron microscopy (EM) (\nEngel 2004\n). EM images of individual EP regions were analyzed for the area of the nerve terminal, the area of the postsynaptic region, the postsynaptic membrane length, and the postsynaptic membrane concentration (length per unit postsynaptic area) (\nEngel 1994\n).\n\nIn vitro\nelectrophysiology studies\nIntercostal muscle specimens were obtained from origin to insertion from the propositus and from patients without muscle disease undergoing thoracic surgery. The amplitude of the miniature EP potential (MEPP) and the quantal content of the EP potential (\nm\n) were determined as previously described (\nEngel et al. 1993\n;\nUchitel et al. 1993\n;\nKamenskaya, Elmqvist, and Thesleff 1975\n;\nElmqvist and Quastel 1965\n). In brief, thin strips of muscle containing a motor nerve were pinned out in a chamber with continuously perfused Tyrode solution containing (in mM): NaCl 135, KCl 5, CaCl\n2\n2, MgCl\n2\n1, NaHCO\n3\n15, Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n1.3, Dextrose 11.1, 95% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\n, at pH of 7.2. MEPP and EP potential (EPP) were recorded by conventional methods. The MEPP amplitude was corrected for resting membrane potential of \u221280 mV and a fiber diameter of 50 \u03bcm in control subjects. The decay time of MEPP was determined by fitting each individual trace with one component exponential equation. The quantal content of the EPP (\nm\n) was determined by the variance method using the 6th to 70th EPP in a train of stimulation at 1 Hz, and was corrected for a resting membrane potential of \u221280 mV, nonlinear summation, and non-Poisson release.\n\nMutation analysis\nWe directly sequenced genes encoding the AChR \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b4-, and \u03b5-subunits using the patient\u2019s genomic DNA as previously described (\nOhno et al. 1995\n). Whole genome sequencing of patient\u2019s genomic DNA was performed by Prevention Genetics (Marshfield, WI) for detection of a large deletion or duplication. End-point quantitative PCR analysis within the deletion breakpoint confirmed the large deletion.\n\nConstruction and expression of wild-type and mutant AChR\nSources of human \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b4-, and \u03b5-subunit cDNAs and subcloning of the cDNAs into the CMV-based mammalian expression vector pRBG4 were as previously described (\nOhno et al. 1996\n). The mutations were engineered into wild-type AChR subunit cDNAs using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Presence of each mutation and absence of unwanted mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entire inserts. HEK293 cells (ATTC) were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b4- and \u03b5-subunits, and pEGFP-N1 at a ratio of 2:1:1:1:1, using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) as previously described (\nShen et al. 2005\n).\n\n\u03b1-Bungarotoxin binding measurements\nThe total number of\n125\nI-\u03b1-bungarotoxin (\n125\nI-\u03b1-bgt) sites on the surface of transfected HEK cells was determined as described previously (\nOhno et al. 1996\n). Briefly, intact cells were harvested 3 days after transfection by gentle agitation in phosphate buffered saline with 5 mM EDTA. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in a high-potassium Ringer\u2019s solution containing (in mM) NaCl 5.4, KCl 140, CaCl\n2\n1.8, MgCl\n2\n1.7, HEPS 25, and 30 mg/L BSA, pH7.4, and divided into aliquots for measurements of \u03b1-bgt binding. The total number of \u03b1-bgt binding sites was determined by incubation for 1 hour in the presence of 5 nM\n125\nI-\u03b1-bgt (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Unbound toxin was removed by washing with high-potassium Ringer\u2019s solution, followed by filtration using a cell harvester (Brandel Incorporated). Radioactivity retained by glass fiber filters (Whatman GF-B, 1-\u03bcm cutoff) was measured with a gamma counter (Wizard 1470, Perkin Elmer). Nonspecific binding was determined by measuring the radioactivity of parallel reaction tubes in presence of 300 \u03bcM d-tubocurarine before\n125\nI-\u03b1-bgt was added. The difference of radioactivity between reactions without and with d-tubocurarine reflects specific \u03b1-bgt binding sites.\n\nPatch-clamp recordings and single-channel kinetic analysis\nRecordings were obtained in the cell-attached patch configuration at a membrane potential of \u221280 mV at 22\u00b0C with bath and pipette solutions containing (in mM): 142 KCl, 5.4 NaCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1.7 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Single-channel currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) at a bandwidth of 50 kHz, digitized at 5-\u03bcs intervals using a Digidata 1322A (Molecular Devices) and recorded to a hard disk using the program Clampex 8.2 (Molecular Devices). Recordings obtained with ACh concentrations of 1 \u03bcM or lower were analyzed at a uniform bandwidth of 11.7 kHz with an imposed dead time of 15.3 \u03bcs using TACx4.0.9 software (Bruxton, Seattle, WA). Open intervals and closed times were fitted to the sum of exponentials using TACFITx4.09 (Bruxton). Burst durations were determined by grouping openings separated by a specified closed time, taken as the intersection between the briefest closed time component and the next longer component. Burst duration histograms were fitted to the sum of exponentials and plotted on logarithmic abscissa (\nSigworth and Sine 1987\n).\nIn the process of AChR activation, the rate of ACh association with the binding sites depends on the ACh concentration. Thus, to determine the rate constants underpinning activation of wild-type and mutant receptors, we employ a range of intermediate and high concentrations of ACh (10 to 1000 \u03bcM) , which have the added benefit that opening and closing events from the same receptor cluster into identifiable activation episodes due to desensitization (Sakmann, Patlak, and Neher 1980;\nSine et al. 1995\n). Recordings were analyzed at a bandwidth of 10 kHz and an imposed dead time of 25 \u03bcs. The global fitting of a kinetic scheme to dwell times elicited by different ACh concentrations allows us to simultaneously estimate the dissociation constants of ACh binding and the equilibrium constant for channel gating. Clusters were identified as a series of closely spaced openings preceded and followed by closed intervals greater than a defined critical time. The critical time (tcr), was determined by a method that misclassifies an equal number of events between two adjacent closed-time components (\nColquhoun and Sakmann 1985\n). We calculated the tcr manually by solving equation afexp(\u2212tcr/tf) = as(1-exp(\u2212tcr/ts), here, af and as represent area of fast and slow components of closed times, respectively; and tf and ts represent the time constant of fast and slow components of closed times, respectively. For each receptor, the critical time providing the best fit for the closed-time histogram was chosen for the final analysis. Clusters with fewer than five openings were excluded from analysis. Individual clusters were examined for homogeneity based on the mean open probability and open duration for each cluster, and clusters within two SDs of the means of both were accepted for further analysis (\nQin, Auerbach, and Sachs 1997\n;\nShen et al. 2002\n). We used TAC software to measure the durations of open and close events of each recording, and manually derived the open probability from the sum of open time divided by the sum of open and closed times for each cluster. The resulting global set of open and closed dwell times from wild-type and mutant AChRs were analyzed using the program MIL of QuB suite, which uses an interval-based maximum likelihood method that also corrects for missed events to yield fitted rate constants in a kinetic scheme for receptor activation (\nQin, Auerbach, and Sachs 1997\n). At least 3 patches for each desensitizing concentration of ACh were obtained for both wild-type and mutant AChR.\n\nStatistics\nTwo tailed Student\u2019s\nt\ntest was used to compare the surface expression of each mutant AChR with wild-type AChR;\nP\nvalue less than 0.05 was considered significant. Error estimates of the scheme rate constants for wild-type and mutant receptors in\nTable 3\nwere computed by the MIL program of QuB suite from the curvature of the likelihood function at its maximum (\nQin, Auerbach, and Sachs 1997\n).\nTable 3.\nKinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant AChRs expressed in HEK cells with ACh as agonist\nRate constants\nWild-type\n\u03b2P248L\nk\n+1\n(\u03bcM\n\u22121\ns\n\u22121\n)\n81\u00b1 6\n127 \u00b1 12\nk\n\u22121\n(s\n\u22121\n)\n1,036 \u00b1 108\n1,642 \u00b1 230\nK\n1\n(\u03bcM)\n12\n13\nk\n+2\n(\u03bcM\n\u22121\ns\n\u22121\n)\n84\u00b12\n132 \u00b1 5\nk\n\u22122\n(s\n\u22121\n)\n10,679 \u00b1 167\n13,682 \u00b1 302\nK\n2\n(\u03bcM)\n127\n104\n\u03b2 (s\n\u22121\n)\n57,138 \u00b1 1,219\n27,054 \u00b1 536\n\u03b1 (s\n\u22121\n)\n2,410 \u00b1 66\n2,708 \u00b1 39\n\u03b8\n24\n10\nPredicted mean burst duration (T\npred\n) (ms)\n2.6\n1.1\nLow conc mean burst duration (T\nrec\n) (ms)\n3.3\n1.2\nOpen in a new tab\nValues represent mean \u00b1 SE.

    "Methods": "Animals care and use\nCommercially-available male mice 7 to 10 weeks old (20\u201325g, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were utilized for all experiments. Wild-type (WT; C57BL/6J), CCR2 KO (JAX stock #004999 (\nBoring et al., 1997\n)), and CCL2 KO (JAX stock #004434 (\nLu et al., 1998\n)) mice were randomized to groups for experimental treatments. Mice were randomized to groups for experimental treatments. Randomized C57BL/6J mice were used as donor mice to derive ANAs. Surgical procedures and peri-operative care measures were conducted in compliance with the AAALAC accredited Washington University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the National Institutes of Health guidelines. All animals were housed in a central animal care facility and provided with free access to food (PicoLab rodent diet 20, Purina Mills Nutrition International, St. Louis, MO) and water.\n\nSurgical procedures\nFor surgical procedures, mice were anesthesized using a cocktail of ketamine (100 mg/kg; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) and dexmedetomidine (0.5 mg/kg; Pfizer Animal Health, Exton, PA). For mice serving as ANA donors, following euthanization, their sciatic nerves were transected proximally at the level of exiting nerve roots, and distally just beyond the sciatic trifurcation. In experimental mice receiving the ANAs, the right sciatic nerve was exposed and transected 5 mm proximal to the distal trifurcation. The indicated grafts (10 mm) were reverse oriented (distal end of donor graft facing proximal nerve stump of recipient) sutured into the nerve gap with 11\u20130 nylon microsuture (Sharpoint, Reading, PA). A two-layer closure of muscle and skin was performed using 6\u20130 vicryl and 4\u20130 nylon suture, respectively. Atipamezole solution (0.1mg/kg; Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ) was administered for anesthesia reversal. The animals were recovered on a warming pad and monitored for postoperative complications before returning them to a central animal care facility. Postoperative pain was managed using Buprenorphine SR\u2122 (0.05 mg/kg; ZooPharm, Windsor, CO). Animals were monitored daily post-operatively for signs of infection and/or distress. At the appropriate endpoints, animals were euthanized via cervical dislocation under anesthesia, and their tissues collected for respective studies (see below).\n\nANA processing\nANAs were decellularized using a modified series of detergents in the method described previously (\nPoppler et al., 2016\n). Briefly, nerves isolated from donor animals were repeatedly washed in deionized water and detergents in a sodium phosphate buffer: Triton X-100, sulfobetaine-16 (SB-16), and sulfobetaine-10 (SB-10). All grafts were washed and stored in 10 mM phosphate-buffered 50 mM sodium solution at 4\u00b0C and used within 1 week.\n\nVEGF Receptor (VEGFR) inhibition with cabozantinib\nIn select mice as indicated in the results, angiogenesis was inhibited using cabozantinib, a selective VEGFR2 inhibitor (Selleckchem, Houston, TX). Six days after surgery, mice were given cabozantinib (100mg/kg, in water) via oral gavage twice a day until fourteen days after surgery, when they were sacrificed. Control mice received water without the inhibitor.\n\nClodronate liposome depletion of macrophages\nIn select mice as indicated in the results, macrophages were depleted using clodronate liposome (Liposoma B.V., Amsterdam, Netherland), which selectively targets and kills macrophages. Starting either 2 days prior to surgery or 4 days after surgery, 200uL of clodronate liposome were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) once every three days. Control mice were administered phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\n\nMacrophage labeling with Dil-liposome (in\nsupplementary material\n)\nIn select mice as indicated in the results, macrophages were labeled using Dil liposome (Liposoma B.V., Amsterdam, Netherland). Thirteen days after surgery, 200uL of Dil-liposome were administered i.p. once in WT or CCR2KO mice. The next day, mice were sacrificed to collect ANAs for analysis.\n\nNeutrophil depletion using Ly6G antibody\nIn select mice as indicated in the results, neutrophils were depleted through the administration of Ly6G neutralizing antibodies (Bio X Cell, Lebanon, NH). Two days prior to surgery rat anti-mouse Ly6G antibody (clone 1A8) or its corresponding control isotype (clone LTF-2), were given intraperitoneally. Each mouse was given 250 \u03bcg of antibody diluted to 100 \u03bcL using PBS. These were continued once every other day until the fourteen-day endpoint. Depletion of neutrophils was verified by flow cytometry analysis of spleen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC)\nTo assess cell populations and protein expression within ANAs, nerve samples were explanted at indicated endpoints and immediately placed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffer overnight followed by immersion in 30% sucrose in PBS solution for 24\u201348 hours. Samples were then frozen in OCT Compound (VWR, Radnor, PA) and sectioned at 15 \u03bcm onto pretreated charged glass slides. Sections were rehydrated with PBS and blocked using 5% normal goat serum diluted in PBS before primary antibody staining. Primary antibodies were used to stain for endothelial cells (CD31), T cells (CD3), axons (NF200), Schwann cells (S100), myelin basic protein (MBP), and macrophages (CD68, CD206). Primary antibody in 5% serum buffer was applied and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with specific antibodies and concentrations outlined in\nSupplemental Table 1\n. Sections were then washed in PBS and stained for the appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. All sections were mounted with Fluoroshield mounting medium with DAPI (Abcam, Boston, MA) and then imaged using the Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope and acquisition system (Olympus, Waltham, MA) at overall 200x (20x water immersion objective) or 600x magnification (60x oil immersion objective). A minimum of three sections were analyzed and averaged for each tissue area using ImageJ (NIH) to obtain a value for each single animal (n=1). For percent area, an ImageJ macro was used to quantify the percentage of the area in a standardized field that was positive for the marker measured. For cell counts, field size was kept standard at a 60x objective (600x magnification overall), and colocalization of the primary marker(s) with DAPI was considered a positive cell. Data reported for cell counts was reflected as % cells, where cells colocalized with the marker(s) of interest was expressed as proportion of all DAPI+ cells in the standardized field.\n\nFlow cytometry\nTo identify and quantify immune cell populations, at the indicated endpoints after surgery, mice were sacrificed and their ANAs, blood (collected via cardiac puncture), or spleen harvested. Nerve tissues and spleen were digested using a cocktail of 1 mL digestion buffer (0.1% collagenase, 0.05% DNase in 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS)/ Dulbecc\u00f2s Modified Eagle Media (DMEM)). Samples were incubated for 20 minutes at 37\u00b0C with constant agitation, and following digestion, the samples were re-suspended in FACS buffer (2% FBS, 0.1% EDTA in phosphate buffered saline). RBCs from blood or spleen were removed using RBC lysis buffer. After filtering through 75 um membrane, the cells were incubated with Fc block for 10 minutes followed by an antibody cocktail specific to the cell of interest (\nSupplemental Table 2\n) for 1 hour before analysis with flow cytometry using BD Fortessa. At least 50,000 events were acquired for flow cytometry. Data were analyzed using FlowJo. Macrophages were gated by CD45+, CD11b+, CD64+, F4/80+. Monocytes were gated on CD45+, CD11b+, CD64-, Ly6C+. Neutrophils were gated by CD45+, CD11b+, Ly6G+. Single color stained compensation beads were used as control.\n\nGene analysis (qRT-PCR) (for\nsupplemental material\n)\nTo quantify gene expression from sorted cells within ANAs, total RNA was prepared from ANA explants. RNA was extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies), chloroform and a RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA concentration was determined on a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). The cDNA was generated with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Real-time PCR was performed using a Step One Plus thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using Taqman Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) reagents with CCL2 primer (Assay ID: Mm00441242_m1, Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The expression levels of genes were normalized to\nActb.\nData were analyzed using Step One Software v2.2.2 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).\n\nRelative Muscle Mass\nTo further quantify the extent of nerve regeneration, relative gastrocnemius muscle mass was measured as it is indicative of reinnervation of denervated muscles. After nerve harvest at 6 weeks, the gastrocnemius muscles were harvested from the experimental and contralateral sides. Wet muscle weight was recorded on each side, and the ratio of the ipsilateral to contralateral muscle weight was calculated.\n\nGrid walk assessment\nAt week 6 post-operatively, mice underwent a grid walk assessment to determine their functional recovery. Mice were placed on an elevated mesh or grid with a grid size measuring 3.5cm by 3.5cm. After mice have acclimated to the grid for at least 5 mins, they were recorded with a video camera for at least 4 minutes moving upon the grid. From the video considering the injured limb, the total number of steps with that foot, and total steps that resulted in a foot placement missing the mesh and going through the grid (slipped steps) was measured. Foot fault was calculated as the proportion of slipped steps to total steps.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism. Each animal was considered an \u2018n\u2019 value. All data were compiled as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Data were tested for normality using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Student\u2019s t test was performed for analysis between 2 groups. A significance level of p < 0.05 was used in all statistical tests performed."

    "Methods": "Experimental Subjects\nAdult male Sprague Dawley, F344 and Lewis RT.1 rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN; 225\u2013275 g at time of lesion surgery) were employed in three parallel but distinct studies (i.e.: Experiments #1, 2, 3a and 3b) as detailed in\nTable 1\n. Rats were kept on a 12h light/dark cycle, and given food and water\nad libitum\n. All studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Michigan State University (MSU), the Van Andel Institute (VAI), and State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton where these studies took place. All work was performed in accordance with the ethical standards established by the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\nTable 1.\nThree parallel but distinct studies (i.e.: Experiments 1, 2, 3a and 3b) used to examine the relationship of genotype-to-phenotype expression in LID.\nExperiment ID\nExperiment Name\nRat Strain\nPrincipal Experimental Endpoint\n1\nGene Array Exploration\nSprague Dawley\nDifferential Gene Expression in LID+ vs LID\u2212 Subjects\n2\nChronic LID+ vs Acute LID+\nSprague Dawley\nDifferential Transcript and Protein Expression in Chronically vs Acutely Dyskinogenic Subjects\n3a\nF344 LID+ vs Lewis LID\u2212\nF344 & Lewis\nDifferential LID and Transcript Expression and DA & 5-HT content in F344 LID+ vs Lewis LID\u2212 Subjects\n3b\nF344 LID+ vs Lewis LID\u2212\nF344 & Lewis\nDifferential Extracellular Striatal DA, 5-HT, & NE in F344 LID+ vs Lewis LID\u2212 Subjects\nOpen in a new tab\n\n6-OHDA Lesions\nAll rats were rendered unilaterally parkinsonian with a stereotaxic injection of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Dosage of 6-OHDA was defined for each rat strain as that necessary to obtain a comparable final degree of nigrostriatal DA loss (\u2265 90%) for all animals. Lewis rats have been reported to have lower dopamine transporter (DAT) levels in striatum (Gulley et al., 2007; Flores 1998) and as such we empirically determined that a slightly higher dose of 6-OHDA was necessary in this rat strain compared to the F344 and SD rats to meet the criteria of \u2265 90% nigrostriatal DA depletion. To produce equal levels of striatal DA loss, F344 and SD rats received a dose of 5\u03bcg 6-OHDA hydrobromide/\u03bcl and Lewis rats 7\u03bcg 6-OHDA hydrobromide/\u03bcl in 0.02% ascorbic acid in sterile saline. Rats were anesthetized with inhalant isoflurane (2\u20133%; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and secured in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA). Each rat received 2\u03bcl of 6-OHDA at a flow rate of 0.5\u03bcl/minute (min) into the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc; 4.8mm posterior, 1.7mm lateral, and 8mm ventral to bregma) and the median forebrain bundle (MFB; 4.3mm posterior, 1.6mm lateral, and 8.4mm ventral to bregma), an approach routinely used in our labs to reliably produce the severe (\u226595%) nigrostriatal dopamine depletion needed to model LID (e.g.: [\n5\n,\n6\n,\n20\n,\n21\n]). At completion of the surgery rats received carprofen (as Rimadyl\u00ae; 5mg/kg, 0.1cc/100g body weight) as analgesic treatment. For consistency, all lesion surgeries and levodopa priming treatments were performed at MSU by the same team of investigators.\n\nLesion Assessment Behavioral Evaluation\nEstimation of nigrostriatal DA lesion success prior to chronic levodopa treatment was done in all rats using a combination of drug-free behavioral tests including vibrissae test [\n22\n], cylinder test [\n23\n], tail hang [\n24\n], and/or forepaw bracing [\n22\n,\n25\n] tests. In the F344 and Lewis rats amphetamine (5.0mg/kg, i.p.; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) rotational response was used as an initial behavioral indicator of potential differential striatal DA release between strains, which was used also as an additional indicator of lesion success. These behaviors were assessed 2\u20133 weeks after 6-OHDA in all rats.\n\nLevodopa Priming and Dyskinesia Assessment\nApproximately 4 to 5 weeks after 6-OHDA, all rats were single housed in cages with enrichment materials at the initiation of daily injections (M-Fr). All rats received high dose levodopa (levodopa methyl ester 12mg/kg plus 12mg/kg benserazide, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO) as detailed below. Abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) were scored according to a LID severity rating scale for rats developed in our laboratories based on specific criteria reflective of the nature and occurrence of multiple behavioral attributes of dyskinesia as previously detailed [\n10\n,\n26\n,\n27\n]. Briefly, as detailed previously [\n10\n,\n26\n,\n27\n] both the intensity (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) and frequency (0= absent, 1 = 50% of rating period, 2 = 50% of the rating period, 3=constant/uninterruptable) were assessed for specific attributes of LID behaviors including: forelimb hyperkinesia, forelimb dystonia, hindlimb dystonia, trunk dystonia, neck dystonia, and orolingual dyskinesia (e.g.:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvENE02Kiwo\n; [\n28\n]). A dyskinesia severity score for a given individual component of LID was obtained by multiplying frequency times intensity. A total daily severity score for each animal was computed by adding the severity scores of all individual components of LID behavior. Experimental animals were randomized at the beginning of the experiment and rated in the same order and by the same blinded investigator throughout each experiment.\nFor\nExperiment (Exp.) 1\n(\u2018\nGene Array Exploration\u2019\n) the experimental timeline and groups are shown in\nFigure 1A\n,\nB\n. Unilaterally parkinsonian SD rats received daily injections with 12mg/kg levodopa (plus 12mg/kg benserazide) and LID behaviors were rated for a total of 7 sessions 50 mins after levodopa to differentiate LID-positive (LID+) and LID-negative (LID\u2212) subjects (\nFig. 1\n). For\nExp. 2\n(\u2018\nChronic LID vs Acute LID\u2019\n) expression patterns were compared in SD rats with: 1) long-term striatal DA depletion, na\u00efve to levodopa 2) long-term striatal DA depletion plus a single dose levodopa and LID expression, and 3) long-term striatal DA depletion plus long-term levodopa treatment and LID expression. Rats receiving\nchronic\nlevodopa were evaluated for their dyskinetic response once during weekly during the 3 weeks of levodopa priming (\nFig. 2\n) in order to identify LID+ rats for comparison to rats exhibiting similar levels of LID in response to a single\nacute\nlevodopa dose. For\nExp. 3a\n(\u2018\nF344 LID+ vs Lewis LID\u2212\n\u2019) unilaterally lesioned F344 and Lewis rats were evaluated for LID behaviors on days 1, 7 and 15 during the 3 weeks of levodopa priming with 12mg/kg levodopa (plus 12mg/kg benserazide). In the second cohort,\nExp. 3b\n, designated for\nin vivo\nmicrodialysis, F344 and Lewis rats were rendered unilaterally parkinsonian, amphetamine tested and levodopa primed in an identical manner as in Experiment 3a however, they were then transported from MSU to SUNY Binghamton one day after the final analyses. The SUNY investigators were blinded to LID priming scores and species identification until after Experiment 3b rats were sacrificed.\nFigure 1. Differential gene expression in response to chronic levodopa in parkinsonian Sprague Dawley (SD) rats expressing dyskinesia (LID+) vs non-responders (LID\u2212).\nOpen in a new tab\nA)\nExperimental timeline\n. Adult male SD rats were rendered unilaterally parkinsonian with 6-OHDA delivered into the SN and MFB. Lesion status was confirmed 2 weeks post-toxin with drug-free tests as described in the\nmethods\n. Rats began daily (Mon-Fri) treatment with levodopa (12mg/kg + 12mg/kg benserazide) for 2.5 weeks.\nB)\nTime course of\nLID in \u2018responders\u2019 and \u2018non-responders\u2019 (LID+ N=7, LID\u2212 N=5; Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison post-hoc test).\nC)\nExperimental groups\n. Gene expression levels were assessed from the striatum of parkinsonian rats that were: treated with levodopa and developed dyskinesias (N=3, LID+), treated with levodopa and remained resistant to dyskinesias (N=3, LID\u2212), treated with saline (N=3, 6-OHDA + Saline); and in intact rats treated with levodopa (Sham lesion + Saline).\nD)\nPrincipal component analysis showing the overall relationship between groups.\nE)\nDifferential expression\nwas performed for all pairwise comparisons at the probeset level. Significant probesets (FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05) were subsequently collapsed by gene prior to visualization of the results. There were 258 genes that showed differential expression between LID+ and LID\u2212 striatum.\nF)\nVenn diagram\nof the three comparisons showing the total number of differentially expressed genes and their direction of change (red/top # = up-regulated; blue/bottom # = down-regulated).\nG)\nHeatmap\nof the top 50 differentially expressed genes between LID+ and LID\u2212 rats. Color indicates the magnitude (per \u2018log ratio\u2019 legend) and direction of change between the expression of each gene for the N=3 subjects in each treatment group as compared to the LID\u2212 rats (red=increased expression; blue= decreased expression; white= no significant change).\nH)\nqPCR validation\nof the top 3 transcripts showing differential expression (DE) between LID+ and LID\u2212 subjects. There is a high degree of agreement between the microarray and qPCR DE for\nTrh\nand\nInhba\n. However, DE of\nNr4a2\nin the striatum of LID+ subjects was much greater when quantified by qPCR (39.39 fold) versus that observed with the microarray (9.42 fold) likely due to saturation of the\nNr4a2\nsignal on the microarray chip, which would result in an underestimation of the differential upregulation of this transcript.\nFigure 2. Comparable dyskinesia severity and differential candidate gene profiles in SD rats exposed to first-ever versus chronic levodopa.\nOpen in a new tab\nA)\nExperimental timeline\n. Adult male SD rats were rendered unilaterally parkinsonian with 6-OHDA delivered into the SN and MFB and lesion confirmed with drug-free behavioral testing 2 weeks later. The chronically treated rats received daily (Mon-Fri) levodopa (12mg/kg + 12mg/kg benserazide) for 3 weeks. Approximately 7 weeks post-lesion, rats receiving a single acute injection or those treated with chronic levodopa were given a test dose of levodopa (12m/kg) and sacrificed approximately 90 mins post-levodopa.\nB)\nLID behavioral data\nshowing equivalent levels of dyskinesia severity (p=0.257, Mann-Whitney U test; chronic (N=6), acute (N=12)). Transcript and protein levels of Fosb (\nC,D\n), Nurr1 (\nE,F\n), and Trh (\nG,H\n) were quantified in subsets of first-ever LID+ and chronic LID+ rats as well as parkinsonian na\u00efve rats which served as baseline data (N=3\u20136 as depicted in graphs C-H; p-values indicated in these graphs derived from one-way ANOVA with multiple comparison).\n\nGuide Cannulae Surgeries and In Vivo Microdialysis (Exp. 3b)\nAs previously detailed by [\n29\n], 1 week after arrival, rats that were previously DA-lesioned and primed with levodopa for 3 weeks were anesthetized with inhalant isofluorane (2\u20133%; Sigma) in oxygen and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA). Rats were fitted unilaterally with plastic microdialysis guide cannulae (CMA 12 Elite; Stockholm, Sweden) targeting the dorsal striatum ipsilateral to lesion (AP, 1.2 mm; ML, 2.8 mm; DV, \u22123.7 mm; relative to bregma; Paxinos & Watson, 1998). Cannulae were positioned and affixed to the skull with screws and liquid and dental acrylic (Lang Dental, Wheeling, IL). At the completion of surgery, animals were single housed in enriched cages and allowed to recover with\nad libitum\nfood and water. Pre-surgery and 1 day post-surgery, rats received Buprenex (buprenorphine HCl; 0.03 mg/kg, i.p.; Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc., Richmond, VA) as analgesic treatment. Soft chow was also provided and rats were monitored for 7 days post-surgery to ensure full recovery. Three rats did not survive post-surgical care and final groups were carried on through testing (F344, n = 9; Lewis, n = 6).\nApproximately 10 days after cannulation surgery, rats were injected with levodopa (levodopa methyl ester 6 mg/kg s.c. + benserazide 15 mg/kg s.c.; Sigma) and LID behaviors quantified; specifically axial, limb, and orolingual abnormal involuntary movements (ALO AIMs) every 10 min for the following 3 h. Microdialysis tested commenced approximately 3 days later. On the night before testing, striatal probes (CMA 12 Elite; membrane length = 3 mm; 20000 Dalton; Stockholm, Sweden) were inserted into the rats\u2019 guide cannulae and locked into place so that the dialysis membrane extended \u22123.7 to \u22126.7 mm ventral to bregma. The next day, rats were habituated for 1 h with artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF; 2.0 \u03bcL/min; in mM: 128 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.3 CaCl\n2\n, 2.1 MgCl\n2\n, 0.9 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.0 Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, and 1.0 glucose, brought to a pH of 7.4). At this point, rats received a systemic treatment injection of vehicle (0.9% NaCl + 0.1% ascorbic acid, s.c.) to determine injection-induced changes and striatal dialysate samples were collected every 20 min for 3 h to determine baseline levels of norepinephrine (NE), DA, and 5-HT. After baseline, rats received systemic injections of levodopa (6 mg/kg) followed by sample collection, LID ratings and rotations counting every 20 min for 3 h (\nFigs. 1\nand 7G, H). This lower dose of levodopa (compared to the 12mg/kg priming dose) was used for microdialysis to allow detection of potential differences in DA release between strains free from possible saturation effects that might have occurred with higher doses.\n\nEuthanasia and Tissue Collection\nIn all studies rats were sacrificed to allow examination of experimental endpoints during peak LID expression (i.e.: 90\u2013120 minutes after a final levodopa injection). In experiments involving gene array and/or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Exp. 1 & 3), rats were anesthetized with Beuthanasia (100mg/kg; Merck Animal Health, Madison, NJ) 120 minutes after a final levodopa injection and decapitated. Brains were rapidly removed (<1min) and submerged for 30 seconds (s) in a 250 ml beaker of isopentane super-cooled in powdered dry ice. The brains were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until time of dissection. At time of dissection, frozen brains were warmed to approximately \u221220\u00b0C by placing them into a \u221220\u00b0C freezer for 1\u20132 hours (h) prior to \u2018punch dissection\u2019. Brains were blocked caudally to remove the cerebellum, affixed to a cryostat chuck and placed into a \u221215\u00b0C cryostat (Microm HM 560, Thermo-Scientific, Waltham, MA). To obtain striatal tissue, brain tissue rostral to the striatum was removed by sectioning the brain until anterior aspect of the striatum (~1.8mm anterior to bregma) was visible.\nUsing specifically designed tissue punches, frozen striatal tissue was extracted for gene array or HPLC. For HPLC, a punch of striatal tissue 1mm wide x 2mm deep from the centromedial striatum was extracted with a slightly lateral trajectory from rostral to caudal using a15G tissue punch (Fine Science Tools, Inc., I.D. 1mm). Tissue from both the lesioned and unlesioned striata were placed into empty 1ml plastic eppendorf tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), frozen on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until time of assay. For microarray analysis, a 2mm wide x 2mm deep cylinder of striatal tissue was extracted, placed in 1ml of trizol, (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), homogenized by hand with a disposable plastic pestle, frozen on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C in preparation for RNA isolation.\nFollowing punch extraction of striatal tissue from the Exp. 3a subjects, the remaining brain was immersion fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde for 24 hours at 4\u00b0C followed by immersion in 30% sucrose. Sections were cut at 40 \u03bcm using a sliding microtome thru the extent of the striatum to collect tissue for RNAScope\u00ae in situ hybridization (ISH).\nRats in Exp. 2 (\nChronic LID+ vs Acute LID+)\nwere were anesthetized with Beuthanasia (100mg/kg; Merck Animal Health, Madison, NJ) 90 minutes after a final levodopa injection and perfused with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (0.1 M PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PF) per our usual protocol [\n6\n,\n30\n] to allow for examination of transcript using ISH and protein using immunohistochemistry (IHC).\n\nMicroarray Gene Analysis\nRNA extraction was performed using the RNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) and eluted into 15\u03bcl H\n2\nO. RNA quality was assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay on an Agilent Bioanalyzer, (Santa Clara, CA). RNA quality was measured using the 10-point scale associated with the RNA Integrity Number (RIN). Only samples with RIN values \u2265 7 qualified for inclusion in microarray analyses.\nIsolated RNA from tissue samples were processed for microarray hybridization on the Rat Gene 1.0 ST Array at the Gene Expression Microarray Core of Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH. Fifty-120ng of total RNA was converted to biotin\u2013labeled sense-strand cDNA for hybridization using the Ambion WT Expression Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) combined with the GeneChip WT Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Chips were incubated at 45\u00b0C for 17 hours in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640, washed and stained in the Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and scanned using an Affymetrix Gene Chip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).\nOnly arrays meeting all of the quality control measures defined by the Affymetrix Expression Control Program were included in this study. Specific quality control metrics included signal histogram, relative log expression signal, Pearson\u2019s correlation, perfect match (PM) mean (average signal intensity of probes), and positive and negative area under the curve (AUC). Also measured were the expression values of spiked-in poly-A RNA controls, and values of spiked-in hybridization controls. Raw data are available on the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus Repository (\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo\n;\nGSE88726\n).\n\nqPCR Validation of Striatal Microarray Gene Expression Changes\nTo validate expression differences observed from microarray analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to quantify levels of\nNr4a2, Trh\nand\nInhba\n. These three particular transcripts were chosen for validation due both to their high levels exclusively in the LID+ striatum; and for Inhba because it, together with Nurr1 is critically associated with synaptic plasticity, dendritic spine morphology, and learning and memory processes that are considered to be central to LID [\n6\n,\n31\n,\n32\n]. The mRNA levels in frozen striatal micropunches were derived from the same subjects. Total RNA was converted to cDNA using Superscript VILO Mastermix (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). PCR reactions were run in 30 \u03bcl using target specific, FAM\u2122 labeled Taqman hydrolysis probes (Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) multiplexed with a VIC\u00ae labeled primer-limited probe set to the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (\nGapdh)\nreference gene, which was confirmed to not vary with respect to the different treatment conditions (data not shown). Normalized gene expression was determined by differences in the cycle thresholds (Ct) between genes of interest and\nGapdh\n(\u0394Ct) on a Viia7 qPCR System (Life Technologies). Differences between these normalized values across treatment groups (\u0394\u0394Ct) were then linearized to determine fold change differences (2\n\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct\n) and compared to fold changes observed from samples subjected to microarray hybridization and Quantitation (\nFig. 1H\n).\n\nIn Situ Hybridization (ISH), Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Image Analysis\nThe relative abundance of LID-associated transcripts of interest (i.e.:\nNr4a2, Trh, Inhba, FosB\n) were examined in the dorsolateral striatum of SD (Exp. 2) and F344 and Lewis (Exp. 3a) rats using RNAscope (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA) ISH. RNAscope ISH technology utilizes a branched/\u201ctree\u201d\nin situ\nmethod to allow ultrasensitive, single transcript detection using standard microscopy as detailed previously [\n33\n]. Custom RNAscope target probes were generated against\nNr4a2\n(54278,\nNM_019328.3\n, target region 1004\u20131924),\nTrh\n(25569,\nNM_013046.3\n, target region 240\u20131382),\nInhba\n(N/A,\nNM_017128.2\n, target region 2\u20131083). A commercially available RNAscope target probe for\nFosB\n(455821,\nNM_013046.3\n, target region 84\u20131218) was used. The ISH signal was detected using 3, 3\u2019-diaminobenzidine to produce brown punctate staining.\nTo estimate degree of respective protein increase, individual series (1-in-6) of sections (40um thickness) were processed for Nurr1 (R&D Systems, goat anti-Nurr1, 1.5ug/ml), FosB (Santa Cruz, rabbit anti-delta FosB, 1:2,000) or TRH protein (generous gift from E. Nillni, rabbit anti-TRH 1:2,000) IHC using free-floating sections as previously described [\n10\n,\n34\n].\nWe found suboptimal tissue staining with several commercially available InhbA antibodies, and based on its close protein structure and potential cross-reactivity with InhbB and activinA [\n35\n] chose not to include analyses of its transcript and protein in this study.\nThe ISH and immunostaining analyses were performed using ImageJ\u00ae software (NIH) using the threshold function. Three separate images in the dorsolateral intact and DA-lesioned striatum were obtained for each animal (as illustrated in\nFig. 5a\n) using an OlympusBX51 light microscope at 20x by a blinded investigator. All microscope and camera settings were identical for all images within a given transcript or antibody. Data are represented as the mean area above threshold.\nFigure 5. Effect of strain on mRNA induction of LID candidate genes.\nOpen in a new tab\nRNAscope\u00ae\nin situ\nhybridization (ISH) was used to examine expression levels of mRNA of LID-associated genes in representative rats from same cohort shown in\nFigs. 3\nand\n4\n.\nA\n) Schematic showing post-mortem utilization of brains. A central region of the striatum (gray circle, \u201cHPLC\u201d) was punch extracted for examining monoamine content. Following tissue punch extraction, the remaining frozen block was sectioned on the cryostat and 20 \u03bcm thick sections processed for ISH for\nB\n) Fosb,\nC\n) Nurr1,\nD\n) Trh,\nE\n) Inhba mRNA. Three regions within the dorsolateral striatum (black boxes in area with slanted stripes) were analyzed for semiquantitative densitometry with ImageJ\u00ae in representative F344, N=4 and Lewis, N=4 rats with LID severity scores depicted in \u2018\nF\n\u2019. Differences in strain (F344 vs Lewis), treatment (vehicle vs levodopa), and lesion (intact vs lesion), and strain x treatment x time (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2) interactions with 3-way ANOVAs. All significant ANOVA effects were further analyzed using Tukey HSD post-hoc tests. Comparison of representative LID scores were analyzed with Mann Whitney U-test.\nAbbreviations\n: Veh = vehicle; L-dopa = levodopa; Ctx = cortex; cc = corpus callosum; str = striatum; ac = anterior commissure; V = ventricle\n\nHPLC for Striatal Monoamines\nExp. 1 & 3a\nFinal assessment of lesion status and potential differences in tissue content of DA and serotonin (5-HT) and their metabolites were done using HPLC as described previously [\n36\n]. Briefly, striatal samples were sonicated into 250\u03bcl of a 0.4 N perchlorate, 1.34 mM EDTA and 0.53 mM sodium metabisulfite solution. A 20\u03bcl aliquot of the homogenate was reserved for protein determination and the remaining homogenate was centrifuged at 10,500 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was stored in a separate tube at \u221280\u00b0C. Sample separation was performed on a 250\u00d74.6mm Microsorb MV C18 100\u20135 column (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). DA and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HT; serotonin) levels were detected and quantitated using a 12-channel CoulArray 5200 coulometric array detector (ESA, Chelmsford, MA). The mobile phase consisted of 100mM Citric Acid, 75mM Na2HPO4Na, 80\u03bcM 1-heptanesulfonate monohydrate, sodium salt, 5% MeOH, pH 4.25. Samples values were interpolated against a 6-point standard curve. The final values were standardized based on protein content (BCA Protein Assay Kit, Pierce Inc., Rockford, IL). Striatal DA depletion of \u226590% in the lesioned hemisphere as compared to the unlesioned hemisphere was used as a final criterion for inclusion in the study.\nExp. 3b\nAt least 3 days after last microdialysis, rats were rapidly decapitated and tissue was dissected and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C for later analysis for monoamine and metabolite content via HPLC with electrochemical detection. Reverse-phase HPLC was performed on bilateral striatal tissue, according to a previous protocol [\n37\n,\n38\n]. The limit of detection was 10\n\u221210\nM for monoamines and metabolites. The final oxidation current values were plotted on a standard curve of known concentrations from 10\n\u22126\nM to 10\n\u22129\nM, adjusted to respective tissue weights and expressed as picograms (pg) of monoamine per milligram tissue and as percent change from the intact striatum. As previously described in [\n39\n,\n40\n], dialysate samples were measured for monoamine levels via HPLC (Eicom USA, San Diego, CA). NE, DA, and 5-HT peaks were quantified using peak heights of standard solutions. The system detection limit is reliably <50 picomolar (pM) for NE, DA and 5-HT and well within the range for detecting striatal monoamines [\n41\n,\n42\n]. Chromatographs were analyzed using the software program Envision (provided by Eicom, USA). Data are presented as pM concentrations and as percent change from baseline.\n\nStatistical Analyses\nAll LID behavioral data were analyzed by non-parametric statistics including Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison tests (for between subjects tests) or Mann-Whitney U-tests (for between-subject contrasts) and Friedman tests with Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison tests (for within subjects tests). In Exp. 3a, amphetamine rotations and ISH data were analyzed by unpaired two-tailed t-tests and ANOVAs with Tukey HSD post-hoc comparisons, respectively. Monoamine and metabolite tissue values (pg/mg) were analyzed by mixed 2-way lesion x strain (2 \u00d7 2) ANOVAs while percent DA turnover was examined with 2-tailed unpaired t-tests. For correlation of LID severity with DA or 5-HT in DA-lesioned striata, best-fit linear regression analyses and non-parametric Spearman correlation tests were used. In Exp. 3b, averaged baseline and treatment dialysate samples were tested for lesion and strain differences using mixed 2-way (2 \u00d7 2) ANOVAs per monoamine. Percent baseline changes across time were analyzed for differences in strain, treatment, and time with mixed 3-way (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 9) ANOVAs per monoamine. Though constituting <1% of the data, when outliers, defined as 2 standard deviations outside the mean, were detected in microdialysis data, they were replaced with means of surrounding time point values. Strain differences at each microdialysis time point were determined using Tukey HSD post-hocs. Finally, levodopa-induced rotations were analyzed for strain and time differences using a mixed 2-way (2 \u00d7 9) ANOVA. Exp. 3b analyses (post-priming behavior after arrival at SUNY-Binghamton and neurochemistry) were performed with Statistica software \u201898 (Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA) and alpha was set at\np\n< 0.05. All other analyses performed at MSU were performed with Prism (v7 for Mac OS X, GraphPad Software, Inc) and alpha was set at\np\n< 0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Institutional Care and Use Committee. BACHD mice were maintained by breeding with FvB/NJ (Jackson Laboratories) mice. The dominant negative SNARE (dnSNARE) mouse model was generated by crossing GFAP.tTa and tetO.SNARE mouse lines (\nPascual et al., 2005\n). These mouse lines were maintained on the C57BL6 background. The GFAP.tTA/tetO.SNARE (dnSNARE) mice were bred to the BACHD mice to generate F1 BACHD/dnSNARE mice used in these studies.\n\nDoxycycline paradigm\nThe dnSNARE and BACHD/dnSNARE breeding mice and their progeny after weaning, along with appropriate mice (wild-type and BACHD) for comparison, were maintained on chow containing doxycycline (dox-625mg/kg, Envigo Teklab) to suppress the transgene expression until 7.5 months of age or to match the protocol in mice not carrying tTA. At this time point, mice used in behavioral experiments were removed from doxycycline-containing food pellets to allow transgene expression and in other mice to match the protocol.\n\nTissue processing and confocal imaging\nMice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains of the mice were dissected and post-fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C in 4% PFA, followed by cryoprotection in 30% sucrose at 4\u00b0C. Brains were sectioned and stored in cryopreserve (0.1M phosphate buffer, 0.01M MgCl\n2\n, and 0.5M sucrose, 50% glycerol). Cells within the tissue were permeabilized with 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 in 0.01M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 hour. Sections were incubated with 2% normal donkey serum and 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.25 % Triton X-100 in PBS (to block non-specific binding sites) and then with primary antibodies against GFP (1:500, goat, Rockland Immunochemical, Inc., Cat no. 600-101-215) and NeuN (1:500, mouse, Millipore, Cat no. MAB377) or S100\u03b2 (1:500, rabbit, Abcam, Cat no. ab52642) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Tissue was incubated for 2 hours with appropriate secondary, Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 donkey anti-goat (1:500, Invitrogen Cat no. A11055), Alexa Fluor\u00ae 555 donkey anti-mouse (1:500, Invitrogen Cat no.\nA31570\n) and Alexa Fluor\u00ae 555 goat anti-rabbit (1:500, Invitrogen A21428 ), antibodies. Tissue was then mounted in Pro- Long\u00ae Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (to label cell nuclei) (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA; cat. no.\nP36935\n) and left overnight to harden. Images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse Ti2-C2 confocal microscope and parameters in accordance with the Shannon-Nyquist theorem. Images acquired though a Nikon Plan Fluor 40X/1.30 oil immersion objective (OFN25 DIC N2) and were electronically zoomed in at 2.57X and processed by utilizing NIS-Elements software (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan)."

    "Methods": "Traumatic Brain Injury\nSurgical procedures were done in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Drexel University and the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of Laboratory animals (NIH Publications No. 8023, revised 1978). The injury model used in this study was originally characterized by\nRaghupathi and Huh (2007)\nand subsequently utilized in multiple studies (\nHanlon et al 2017\n,\nHanlon et al 2019\n). Timed-pregnant dams were ordered from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington MA) and housed in the vivarium under 12h light:12h dark conditions with access to food and water\nad libitum\n. On postnatal day 11 (the neurological equivalent of a child below the age of 4,\nPorterfield 1994\n,\nRice & Barone 2000\n,\nYager & Thornhill 1997\n), male and female Sprague-Dawley rat pups were anesthetized using isoflurane (Patterson Veterinary, Greeley CO, 5% induction, 2\u20133% maintenance), and a 2 cm incision was made to expose the skull. The anesthesia was stopped, and animals were placed in a plastic rodent restrainer (Braintree Scientific, Braintree MA) and transferred to the stage of an electronic controlled cortical impact device (eCCI, Custom Design and Fabrication, Richmond VA). The impactor tip (5 mm diameter) was positioned over the left parietal cortex midway, between the bregma and lambda sutures, and was driven into the intact skull at a velocity of 5 m/s (3 mm distance from zero point, 100 ms dwell time). After receiving the impact, animals were placed on their backs and the time to right themselves (righting reflex) and time to return to normal breathing (apnea) were recorded. Animals were then re-anaesthetized, and the scalp was sutured closed. Sham-injured animals were surgically prepared but did not receive the impact. Animals were allowed to recover in a separate cage before being placed back with the dam. Surgical procedures and recovery were performed on heating pads at 37\u00b0C to maintain the body temperature, as previously described (\nRaghupathi & Huh 2007\n).\n\nExperimental Design\nAnimals in each litter were randomly assigned to receive a closed head injury (N=69) or were treated as sham-injured controls (N=52). Progesterone (Sigma, Cat# 1000917813) was dissolved in sesame oil (Cat# 156621, MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) the day before surgery. Sham- and brain-injured animals from each litter were randomly assigned to receive either progesterone (16 mg/kg, N=57) or sesame oil (N=64). Progesterone or sesame oil was intraperitoneally injected immediately following the impact or the equivalent time after removal from anesthesia for the sham-injured animals. Subsequent injections via the subcutaneous route were given at 6 hours and every 24 hours for 6 additional days for a total of 8 injections/animal. The dose of progesterone used in the current studies was reported to be optimal for reversing cognitive deficits following TBI in both adolescent (\nGeddes et al 2014\n) and adult (\nGoss et al 2003\n) rats, relative to lower (4 mg/kg) or higher (32 mg/kg) doses. Progesterone was administered during the first week following injury, the standard treatment paradigm that has been utilized in both adult (\nGoss et al 2003\n,\nRoof et al 1994\n,\nRoof et al 1992\n) and pediatric (\nGeddes et al 2016\n,\nGeddes et al 2014\n) preclinical TBI studies. Animals were tested in the 4\nth\nweek after injury in novel object recognition (cognitive function, 25\u201326 days post-injury = postnatal days 36\u201337), novelty-induced locomotor activity (27 days post-injury = postnatal day 38) and the elevated plus maze (anxiety-like behavior, 28 days post-injury = postnatal day 39). Behavioral testing was performed in adolescent-aged rats (36\u201339-days-old) because cognitive and behavioral symptoms become more apparent as brain-injured infants and toddlers age into adolescence (\nChoe et al 2016\n,\nRyan et al 2015\n). Following behavioral assessments, subgroups of animals were randomly assigned to generate tissue for histological analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), or whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology at 4 weeks after injury (29 days post-injury = postnatal day 40,\nTable 1\n).\nTable 1.

On the day prior to testing, rats were placed in a 61 cm \u00d7 41 cm plastic box and habituated for 10 minutes. On the testing day, two identical objects (glass bottles) were placed in opposite corners of the box and the rats were given 5 minutes to explore the objects. After one hour, one of the objects was replaced with a new object of similar dimensions (metal cylinder) and rats were returned to the box and allowed to explore the objects for 5 minutes. Both of the trials were video-recorded, and the number of seconds spent sniffing each of the objects was timed. Rats that showed a preference for one of the objects during the first trial were excluded from further analysis, as were rats that failed to explore both of the objects for a minimum of 10 seconds during either trial. The discrimination index was calculated as:\n(\ntime\u00a0exploring\u00a0novel\u00a0object\n\u2212\ntime\u00a0exploring\u00a0familiar\u00a0object\n)\n(\ntime\u00a0exploring\u00a0novel\u00a0object\n+\ntime\u00a0exploring\u00a0familiar\u00a0object\n)\n\nLocomotor Activity\nAt the conclusion of NOR testing, rats were assessed for novelty-induced locomotor activity in a 30-minute open field test which was performed in a dark, sound-attenuated chamber. Rats were placed in the center of a 22.1\u201dx22.1\u201dx15.83\u201d SmartFrame Open Field System (Kinder Scientific, Poway CA). The distance traveled, as recorded by the number of beam breaks, was measured by MotorMonitor software (Kinder Scientific). Total distance traveled was averaged in 5-minute bins for each group.\n\nElevated Plus Maze\nAnimals were assessed for anxiety-like behavior using the EPM. Rats were placed in the center of an EPM and allowed to freely explore the maze for 5 minutes. EPM testing was performed under dim red light and recorded with an overhead camera. Data were collected using EthoVision XT12 software (Noldus Information Technology Inc., Leesburg, VA). The primary outcome measures were entries into and time spent in the open arms of the maze. Animals were scored as being in an open arm only when both forepaws passed into the open arm.\n\nWhole cell patch-clamp recording\nRats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of Euthasol (100 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 60 mL of carboxygenated (5% CO\n2\n, 95% H\n2\n0) slicing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) consisting of the following (in mM): 234 sucrose, 11 glucose, 24 NaHCO\n3\n, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 MgSO\n4\n, and 0.5 CaCl\n2\n, pH of 7.4. Brains were then rapidly removed and glued to the slicing stage of a vibrating microtome (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL), and 300 \u03bcM coronal slices containing the medial PFC were obtained. Slices were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing the following (in mM): 126 NaCl, 10 glucose, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1 MgSO\n4\n, and 2 CaCl\n2\n, pH 7.4. Brain slices were then kept at room temperature until use.\nBrain slices were individually transferred to a recording chamber and continually superfused with oxygenated ACSF maintained at 34\u00b0C. Using an Olympus BX51WI microscope and Samsung SCB-2001 camera, individual pyramidal neurons were identified with infrared differential interference contrast imaging. Recordings from pyramidal neurons were made using borosilicate glass patch pipettes (resistance 5\u20138 M\u03a9), which were filled with an intracellular solution containing the following (in mM): 128 K gluconate, 10 HEPES, 0.05 CaCl\n2\n, 0.3 GTP, 5 ATP, 1 glucose, 4 NaCl, pH 7.4 as previously reported (\nProuty et al 2017\n,\nSmith et al 2015\n). Whole-cell recordings were obtained using an axon MultiClamp 700A amplifier, DigiData 1332A digitizer, and ClampEx 9.2 software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). A series of depolarizing current steps (\u2212100 to 220 pA) were applied to the cell to evaluate membrane properties. Only neurons with an action potential (AP) overshoot greater than 0 mV were included in further analysis. Neurons were then held in voltage clamp mode at \u221270 mV to record spontaneous excitatory post synaptic currents (EPSCs) for 5 minutes, and at 0 mV to record spontaneous inhibitory post synaptic currents (IPSCs). Previous studies have isolated excitatory and inhibitory currents by recording postsynaptic currents at \u221270 mV and 0 mV, respectively (\nCantu et al 2015\n,\nProuty et al 2017\n). The driving force for cations is much greater than that for chloride ions at \u221270 mV (which is the reversal potential for currents mediated by both ionotropic glutamate receptors). In contrast, the driving force for chloride ions is much greater than that for cations at 0 mV (which is the reversal potential for gamma amino butyric acid isoform A - GABA\nA\n- receptor-mediated currents). In prior studies, EPSCs and IPSCs were recorded in the presence of GABA\nA\nand glutamate receptor antagonists, respectively (\nProuty et al 2017\n,\nSmith et al 2015\n), precluding the need for pharmacologic confirmation of similar currents in the present study. Recorded data were analyzed using ClampFit 10.5 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). Input resistance, resting membrane potential, rheobase and AP threshold were assessed in current clamp traces. In voltage clamp traces, spontaneous EPCSs and IPSCs were analyzed using an automated template-matching protocol. Mean spontaneous current frequency was calculated for each cell across the full duration of the recording.\n\nQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction\nThe medial prefrontal cortex was micro-dissected from coronal sections taken between 2 and 3 mm anterior to bregma and stored in RNA-Later (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Montana) until processed. As described previously (\nPandey et al 2019\n), the mRNA was purified using a Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and cDNA was synthesized using RNA-to-cDNA Master Mix (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). The concentration of total RNA was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. A SYBR Green PCR core reagents kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) was used for qRT-PCR. PCR analyses were performed in MicroAmp Optic 96-well reaction plates (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and run on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The PCR cycle was carried out at 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95\u00b0C followed by 1 min at 60\u00b0C. The levels of target gene expression were quantified relative to the expression of cyclophilin-A using the relative quantification method (\u0394\u0394CT). Expression of mRNA in sham-injured animals that received sesame oil was used as the basis for comparison of mRNA expression in all other groups. Primers were designed using the NCBI primer design tool (\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/\n) and purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific. The primers were validated by testing primer dilutions against a series of cDNA dilutions and determining the efficiency of the standard curve [10^(\u22121/slope)], as well as running a melting curve analysis to confirm primer specificity. The sequences and concentrations of the primers are listed in\nTable 1\n.\n\nHistological Analysis\nRats were transcardially perfused at 4 weeks following injury using 0.9% saline containing heparin (1000 units/L, Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Schaumburg, IL) followed by 10% formalin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Brains were post-fixed in formalin for 24 hours before being transferred to a cryoprotective solution containing 30% sucrose. Brains were frozen between \u221240 and \u221250\u00b0C and 40 \u03bcM coronal sections were obtained between 3 mm and 2 mm anterior to bregma using a freezing sliding microtome. Sections were incubated in anti-NeuN (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 4\u00b0C for 16\u201324 hours. Sections were then incubated in a biotinylated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 2 hours at room temperature. Sections were then mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides and cover-slipped using Permount mounting medium. Additional separate sets of adjacent sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides and stained for Nissl (2% Cresyl violet) as previously described (\nHuh et al 2008\n).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. All statistical tests were performed using Statistica 7 (StatSoft, Tulsa, Oklahoma). All analyses were evaluated using a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for sex, injury status, and treatment. When necessary, post-hoc analyses were conducted using the Neuman-Keuls test. Discrimination ratio and GAD\n67\nmRNA expression in brain-injured animals were correlated using linear regression. In all cases, a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered as significant."

    "Methods": "Rats\nFourteen time-pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats (Envigo RMS, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were obtained on embryonic day-14. The rats were maintained in temperature-controlled rooms with a 12-h light/dark cycle and\nad libitum\nfood and water. Day of birth was considered as postnatal day zero (P0). On P1, litters were cross-fostered, adjusted to eight pups (2\u20134 females), and randomly assigned to the MS180 protocol or left undisturbed with their mothers (CONT). Pups were weaned at P21 and received a mild CCI or sham injury (Sham). To avoid sex-and litter-dependent effects, only males were evaluated, and each experimental group consisted of pups from at least six different dams (CONT + Sham, n = 15; MS180 + Sham, n = 15; CONT + mTBI, n = 15; and MS180 + mTBI, n = 15). Females were reserved for a different study. All procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the National Research Committee of the Mexican Social Security System (R-2016-785-054). All experiments were carried out in accordance with the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, revised 1996) and the official regulations for use and care of laboratory animals of Mexico (NOM-062-ZOO-1999). Every effort was made to reduce the number of rats used and to minimize suffering.\n\nMaternal separation\nOn P1, pups of the MS180 group were separated from their dam and placed in a box filled with clean sawdust and placed in a room separated from the colony, with controlled temperature (30\u201332\u00b0C) for 3 h as previously described (\nLajud et al., 2012\n;\nRuiz et al., 2018\n) and then returned to the dam. This procedure was repeated every day at the same time (09:00\u201312:00) until weaning (P21). The control group remained undisturbed except for routine cage cleaning.\n\nControlled cortical injury (CCI)\nRats weighing 45\u201365 g were subjected to a CCI or sham injury on P21. Briefly, anesthesia was induced and maintained with inspired concentrations of 4% and 2% isoflurane, respectively, in 2:1 N\n2\nO:O\n2\n. The rats were secured in a stereotaxic frame, and a midline scalp incision was made utilizing aseptic conditions. The skin and fascia were reflected to expose the skull, then a craniectomy encompassing bregma and lambda and the sagittal and coronal sutures was made in the right hemisphere with a dental drill. The bone flap was removed, the impacting rod was extended and the impact tip (6 mm, flat) was centered and lowered through the craniectomy until it touched the dura mater, then the rod was retracted, and the impact tip was advanced 2.2 mm farther to produce a mTBI (2.2 mm tissue deformation at 4 m/s). Body temperature was monitored with a rectal probe and maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C with a heating blanket. Immediately after the CCI, anesthesia was discontinued, and the incision was promptly sutured. The rats were assessed for acute neurological outcome. Sham-operated rats underwent similar surgical procedures but were not subjected to the impact.\n\nAcute neurological evaluation\nHind limb reflexive ability was assessed immediately after the cessation of anesthesia and removal from the stereotaxic apparatus by gently squeezing the rats\u2019 paw every 5 s and recording the time to elicit a withdrawal response. Return of the righting reflex was determined by the time required to turn from the supine to prone position. These neurological indices are used to determine the level of injury severity (\nKline et al, 2002\n,\n2010\n,\n2012\n;\nBondi et al., 2014a\n,\nb\n;\nRadabaugh et al., 2017\n;\nLajud et al., 2019\n;\nNjoku et al., 2019\n).\n\nBrdU injections\nTo evaluate learning-induced neurogenesis, the rats were injected twice at ten days before sacrifice (12-hr apart, P32) with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma-Aldrich 500 mg/kg) and trained in a spatial learning task as previously described (\nLajud et al., 2019\n). A different cohort of rats were injected on the same dates but were evaluated under baseline conditions (na\u00efve).\n\nSpatial learning evaluation\nCognitive performance was assessed in a Morris water maze (MWM) task (\nMorris, 1984\n) on P35 to P39 (post injury days 14\u201318). The maze consisted of a circular pool (180 cm diameter \u00d7 60 cm height) that was filled with water (26\u00b0C \u00b1 1\u00b0C) to a height of 28 cm. The pool was divided into four quadrants and located in the center of a room with salient visual cues that remained constant throughout the training. The platform (26 cm in height) was placed 2 cm below the water\u2032s surface in the southwest quadrant. Each rat was provided four trials per day (4-min inter-trial interval) for five consecutive days of training. In each trial, the rat was placed in the maze facing the wall from a different quadrant and given a maximum time of 120 s to find the escape platform. If the rat was unable to find the platform, it was manually guided to it where it remained for 30 s before being returned to a heated incubator between trials. The distance traveled to reach the platform was recorded in all trials. On P40, a probe trial was performed with the platform removed to assess memory retention. Each rat was placed in the pool and allowed to swim freely for 30 s. The percent of distance traveled within the target quadrant relative to their respective totals were calculated. On the same day, but after the probe trial, a visible platform test was performed with the platform elevated 2 cm above the water level to determine the contribution of factors such as visual acuity and sensory-motor performance (\nKline et al, 2002\n,\n2010\n,\n2012\n;\nCheng et al., 2008\n,\n2012\n;\nRadabaugh et al., 2017\n;\nLajud et al., 2019\n).\n\nHistology\nOn P42, rats received an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (i.p.) and perfused intracardially with 200 mL of saline solution (0.9% NaCl) and 200 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde [PFA] in 0.1 M phosphate buffer [PB]). The brains were extracted, placed in 4% PFA for 24 hr, transferred to 30% sucrose PB until sunken, then frozen. Random systematic sampling of 40 \u03bcm thick slices along the rostro-caudal axis of the hippocampus was performed using a cryostat. The sections were placed in tubes with cryoprotective solution (25% glycerol, 25% ethylene glycol, 50% PB) until processing.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nA series of 40 \u03bcm-thick coronal sections were cut at 240 \u03bcm intervals and randomly selected for immunohistochemistry. For BrdU staining, brain slices were rinsed in PB and incubated in PBT (PB + Triton X-100 0.3%) containing 10% hydrogen peroxide. Subsequently, sections were incubated in absolute methanol, rinsed in PB and incubated in formamide (50% SSC, Sigma-Aldrich) at 74\u00b0C. After SSC wash, DNA denaturation was performed in HCl (1N) at 37\u00b0C followed by incubation in a borate buffer solution (pH 8.4). After pre-treatments, slices were incubated overnight in the primary anti-BrdU antibody solution (mouse anti-BrdU, 1:1000, Roche Molecular). Brains were incubated in the biotinylated secondary antibody solution (goat anti-mouse, 1:750, Vector Laboratories,) and visualized with avidin-biotin complex (Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories), and Ni-DAB solution (DAB staining kit, Vector Laboratories). Brains were mounted on gelatinized slides, counter stained with hematoxylin-eosin (Vector laboratories), and cover-slipped. For quantification of proliferation and microglia labeling, the brain sections were pretreated with hydrogen peroxide and methanol and further incubated in primary antibody solution for detecting the proliferation associated protein Ki-67 (rabbit anti Ki-67, 1:3000 ABCAM) or ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (mouse anti-Iba1 / IAF1, 1:3000, Millipore). Sections were visualized as described for BrdU.\n\nImmunofluorescence\nTo characterize the cellular phenotype of the BrdU-labeled nuclei, triple immunofluorescence was performed for BrdU, the mature neuron nuclear antigen NeuN, the marker of immature neurons doublecortin (DCX), or the glial cell marker GFAP as previously described (\nLajud et al., 2019\n). For BrdU/GFAP/NeuN labeling, sections were incubated overnight with a mixture of mouse anti-NeuN antibody (1:300, Millipore), rat anti BrdU antibody (1:200, ABD Serotec), and rabbit anti GFAP (1:300, Millipore). Slices were further visualized with corresponding goat anti mouse Alexa Fluor 647 (1:200, Invitrogene), donkey anti rat DyLight 405 (1:200, Jackson Immuno Research), and goat anti rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200, Jackson Immuno Research), mounted and cover-slipped with DAKO (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). For BrdU/DCX/NeuN labeling, slices were first incubated overnight in a mixture of two primary antibodies that detect different DCX epitopes, guinea pig anti DCX (1:400, Millipore) and goat anti DCX (1:200, Santa Cruz). Sections were further placed in a mixture of a biotinylated goat anti guinea pig IgG and donkey anti goat IgG (1:300, Vector laboratories) antibodies and visualized with the fluorescent avidin-FITC substrate kit (Vector laboratories). After DCX staining, slices were further incubated in a mixture of primary rat anti BrdU IgG (1:200, ABD Serotec, Oxford, UK) and mouse anti NeuN IgG (1:300, Millipore). Sections were then visualized with secondary donkey anti rat IgG (1:300, Alexa 405 Jackson Immuno) and goat anti mouse IgG (1:300, Alexa 643, Jackson Immuno) antibodies, mounted and cover-slipped with DAKO mounting media (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). This 2-phase immunostaining procedure was done to ensure that no cross reactivity was observed between Alexa 643 goat anti mouse fluorescent antibody used to visualize NeuN and donkey anti goat biotinylated secondary used to visualize DCX.\n\nBrdU+ and Ki67+ Cell counting\nFor stereology, the numbers of BrdU\n+\nand Ki67\n+\ncells along the entire hippocampus were evaluated by an experimenter blinded to group conditions. The boundaries of the granular and SGZ of the DG were digitally outlined using the software Axio Vision 4.6, Karl Zeiss. Total cell numbers were calculated in the granular and SGZ. DG volume was determined according to the Cavalieri principle as previously described (\nLajud et al., 2012\n,\n2019\n;\nRuiz et al., 2018\n). Evaluation of co-localization of the total BrdU\n+\nnuclei was made with an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope. A series of microphotographs 1 \u03bcm apart along the z-axis of the slice were obtained to generate an orthogonal view. The images were processed with the program \u201cFluoView FV10-ASW 2.0\u201d, and only BrdU\n+\nnuclei that showed co-localization on the z-axis were considered for quantification.\n\nMicroglia evaluation\nFor Iba1\n+\nmicroglial cell evaluation, four sections of the dorsal hippocampus were randomly selected for evaluation. Iba1\n+\ncells were quantified in four different optical frames per section, captured at a 20x magnification by an observer blinded to experimental conditions and assessed in the areas of interest of each section. Iba1\n+\nmicroglia were classified as resting glia when they presented a small soma with long and thin ramifications, and as an activated glia when a large soma with short and thick ramifications (bushy) were present. The proportion of activated Iba1\n+\ncells was estimated as previously described (\nRoque et al., 2015\n).\n\nCortical lesion volume\n40 \u03bcm-thick coronal sections were cut at 480 \u03bcm intervals through the lesion on a cryostat and mounted on Superfrost\u00ae/Plus glass microscope slides. After drying at room temperature, the sections were rehydrated and stained with cresyl violet. Cortical lesion volume (mm\n3\n) was assessed by an observer blinded to experimental conditions using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The area of the lesion (mm\n2\n) was first calculated by outlining the inferred area of missing cortical tissue for each section (Nikon NIS-Elements AR 3.22.14 software Nikon Corp, Tokyo, Japan), and then by summing the lesions obtained, as previously reported (\nOlsen et al., 2012\n;\nMonaco et al., 2013\n,\n2014\n).\n\nData analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed on data generated by experimenters blinded to conditions using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad software, US.). Cognitive data were analyzed by three-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with ELS, injury, and training day as factors. The acute neurological assessment, probe trial, visible platform, swim speed, Ki67, BrdU, and Iba1 quantifications were analyzed by two-way ANOVAs with ELS and injury as factors. When the ANOVA showed a significant effect, the Tukey post-hoc test was utilized to determine specific group differences. The results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (S.E.M.) and are considered significant when\np\n\u2264 0.05."

    "Methods": "A detailed experiment protocol section is available in the online Data Supplement.\n\n2.1. Treadmill exercise\nC57BL/6 J mice, 8\u201310-week old, were used in this study. Mice were randomly divided into control (no-exercise) and exercise groups (\nn\n= 11 per group). Treadmill exercise intensity (10 m/min for 4 wks, 5 days per wk) was based on our previous report (\nMa et al., 2018a\n). All mice were maintained in a 22 \u00b0C room with a 12 h light/dark cycle and fed with standard chow and drinking water ad libitum. Their body weights were recorded weekly.\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the Wright State University Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee and were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals issued by the National Institutes of Health.\nIsolating and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) of cEPC-EXs from peripheral blood.\nAfter 24 h of the last bout of exercise, blood samples were taken from the hearts of control and exercised mice using a 1 ml syringe with a small amount of anticoagulation solution. The isolation protocol of cEPC-EXs has been described in our previous report (\nWang et al., 2016\n). The isolated cEPC-EXs were used for NTA by fluorescence Nanosight NS300 (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) (\nWang et al., 2016\n), for RNA extraction to determine their carried miR level or for co-culture experiments with neurons.\n\n2.2. MCAO surgery and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling\nOn the next day of the last bout of exercise, all the exercised and control mice were subjected to MCAO by inserting an intraluminal filament according to our previous reports (\nChen et al., 2013\n;\nChen et al., 2011\n). For those mice sacrificed on day 28, BrdU (IP, 65 \u03bcg/g per day) was intraperitoneally injected to label the newly generated cells for 7 continuous days before scarification (\nChen et al., 2013\n).\n\n2.3. Infarct volume and microvessel density analyses\nThe infarct volume was evaluated on day 2 post-MCAO by TTC staining (\nChen et al., 2011\n) or day 28 post-MCAO surgery by cresyl violet (CV) staining (\nMehta et al., 2015\n). For TTC staining, images of all stained slices were captured using a flatbed scanner. For CV staining, Images were acquired using a 2\u00d7 objective under a bright-field microscope (Nikon, Eclipse E600). The area of infarction was measured by using Image J software.\nFor microvessel density analysis, brain sections were incubated with primary antibody rat anti-CD31 (1: 50, BD Pharmingen) overnight at 4 \u00b0C then followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated anti-rat secondary antibody. CD31 positive cell counting was performed from photographs in 5 random microscopic fields. The average of 6 sections from rostral to caudal represented the data for one mouse.\n\n2.4. Tunel assay of cell apoptosis and immunofluorescence analyses in the brain tissue\nIn situ apoptosis on day 2 post MCAO-surgery was measured by TUNEL assay kit (Roche, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Tissue samples were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Eclipse E600). Tunel\n+\ncells were counted at five selected microscopic fields and averaged. The angiogenesis and neurogenesis were evaluated 28 days after MCAO surgery. The average of 6 sections from rostral to caudal represented the data for one mouse. In all experiments involving image analysis, the individual(s) taking the photographs and conducting the analysis was blinded to the grouping.\n\n2.5. Neurological deficit and sensorimotor function evaluation\nThe neurological deficits score (NDS) was evaluated before (day \u22121) and after stroke (day 0), day 2 after MCAO surgery by using the 5-point scale method as previously described (\nChen et al., 2013\n). The sensorimotor deficits were assessed by adhesive removal test and corner test as previously reported (\nCai et al., 2017\n;\nMa et al., 2018b\n). Mice were tested before (day \u22121) and after stroke (day 0), 14 or 28 days after MCAO surgery.\n\n2.6. Isolation of EPC-EXs from the ischemic brain tissues\nThe protocol of isolating total EXs from the brain tissues has been described in a previous publication with slight modification (\nPolanco et al., 2016\n). The EPC-EXs were isolated from the total EXs on day 2 post-MCAO by using anti-CD34-conjugated and anti-VEGFR2-conjugated microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec).\n\n2.7. Co-incubation of cEPC-EXs with hypoxia challenged N2a cells\nTo mimic in vivo ischemic condition, we produced an hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury model of N2a cells which was used for coculture experiments (\nWang et al., 2013\n). The cEPC-EXs were sorted from the plasma of control mice and cEPC-EXs\nE\nwere sorted from the plasma of exercised mice (\nMa et al., 2018a\n). After 24 h co-culture, the BDNF level in the culture medium was determined by using the ELISA kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n2.8. Cell viability, apoptosis assay and neurite outgrowth of N2a cells\nAfter 24 h of co-culture, the viability, apoptotic rate and neurite outgrowth of N2a cells were determined. The neurite lengths of N2a cells were measured using Image J software (\nKamiya et al., 2006\n).\n\n2.9. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis\nThe RNAs of cEPC-EXs, N2a cells, and the brain tissue were extracted using Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reverse transcription (RT) reactions were performed using PrimeScriptTM RT reagent kit (TaKaRa, Japan) and PCR reactions were conducted using SYBR Premix EX TaqTM II kit (TaKaRa, Japan). The relative expression level of each gene was normalized to U6 and calculated using the 2\n\u2212\u0394\u0394CT\nmethod.\n\n2.10. Western blot analysis\nThe proteins of EPC-EXs, N2a cells in different co-incubation groups and brain tissue were extracted with cell lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The protein lysates (20 \u03bcg) and EX protein lysate (2 \u03bcg) were electrophoresed, transferred onto PVDF membranes and incubated with primary antibody against anti- cleaved cas-3 (1: 50, Abcam), BDNF (1:1000), TrkB (1:1000), p-TrkB (1:1000), Akt (1: 1000), p-AKt (1: 1000),\n\u03b2\n-actin (1:4000; Sigma) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. All antibodies except cleaved caspase-3 and\n\u03b2\n-actin were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Then all membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:40000; Jackson Immuno Research Lab) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence developing solutions and images were quantified under ImageJ software.\n\n2.11. Statistical analysis\nAll data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. The neurological deficit scores were expressed as median (range). The neurological deficit scores among different groups were compared by a Kruskal-Wallis test. When the Kruskal-Wallis test showed a significant difference, the Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntests were applied as a post hoc test. Multiple comparisons of the data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey post-hoc test (SPSS version 19.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). For all tests, a\nP\n< .05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nYoung adult male Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN; 10 weeks old, 300-325 g) were used for these studies. Dually-housed animals had access to food and water\nad libitum\n. All animal protocols met the guidelines of the NIH and complied with the policies and regulations approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, in accordance with the NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nControlled cortical impact traumatic brain injury (CCI-TBI)\nThe animals were subjected to a unilateral cortical contusion using an electronically controlled pneumatic impact device (Precision Systems & Instrumentation, Fairfax Station, VA) as previously described by our laboratory (\nCebak et al., 2017\n;\nSingh et al., 2013\n). All surgical procedures were performed by the same experimenter. Specifically, the animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (2-4%) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) the skin was retracted and a 6 mm unilateral craniotomy was performed that was centered between bregma and lambda. The skull cap was removed without disruption of the underlying dura. The exposed brain was injured using a 5 mm beveled tip that impacted the cortex at \u2265 3.5 m/sec to a depth of 2.2 mm. Following the injury, surgical foam (Surgicel, Johnson & Johnson) was laid upon the dura and the craniotomy site was sealed up with a sterile 8 mm plastic disc glued to the skull with Mascot tissue adhesive (Gesswein, Bridgeport, CT). The wound was closed with wound clips, the animal removed from the stereotactic device and the animal regained consciousness in a recovery cage on a circulating water heating pad.\n\nChemicals\nSodium pyruvate, malate, rotenone, carbonyl cyanide\np\n-trifuoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), magnesium chloride (MgCl\n2\n), sucrose, mannitol, EGTA, EDTA, bovine serum albumin (BSA), glycerol, HEPES potassium salt, Triton-X, Tris Buffered Saline with Tween 20 (TBS-T), Tris HCl, NaCl, KCl, potassium phosphate monobasic anhydrous (KH\n2\nPO\n4\n), and DMSO were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The citric acid (anhydrous) was from Fisher Scientific (Omaha, NE). The oligomycin was obtained from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY) and the protease inhibitors (Complete Mini Preotease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet) were from Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis, IN). U-74389G or Methylated Tirilazad (TZ) was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor MI).\n\nDrug preparation and dosing\nPZ was prepared fresh with 0.9% saline each day for subcutaneous (subQ) injections to deliver the assigned doses in an injection volume 0.2 ml/100 g rat. PZ-treated animals were administered an initial subQ dose at 15 min post-TBI, and a booster dose (50% of the original dose) administered subQ at various times post-TBI (refer to\nFigure 1\n). Doses were as follows (mg/kg): 3, 10 + 5 or 30. Vehicle-treated animals (saline) received an equivalent volume dose (by weight) at corresponding times after TBI. The animals were allowed to survive for up to 72 hrs prior to euthanasia. The route of administration and the dosages were used based upon previously published work (\nCebak et al., 2017\n;\nHill et al., 2019\n;\nWooters and Bardo, 2007\n).\nFigure 1:\nOpen in a new tab\nTimeline diagrams for these\nin vivo\nstudies detailing the injection time points after the CCI-TBI and the timing of the euthanasia and tissue collection. Experimental timelines are arranged by the total length of each experiment (#\u2019s 1 \u22125).\n\nIsolation of Ficoll-purified non-synaptic and synaptic cortical mitochondria\nMitochondria were isolated from the ipsilateral (injured) cortex or from Sham (craniotomized, but not injured) rats as described previously (\nSingh et al., 2013\n;\nSingh et al., 2006b\n) with modifications to enable separation of synaptic and non-synaptic populations (\nGilmer et al., 2010b\n;\nPatel et al., 2009\n). In brief, rats were deeply anesthetized with CO\n2\n, decapitated, and the cortical tissue was rapidly dissected using an 8 mm punch to collect the injury epicenter and surrounding peri-contusional cortical tissue. Cortical tissue then was homogenized in ice-cold isolation buffer (215 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.2) using Potter-Elvejhem homogenizers. Samples were then centrifuged twice at 1,300 x rcf for 3 min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were collected and spun at 13,000 x rcf for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The crude mitochondrial pellet was re-suspended and layered onto a discontinuous 7.5% and 10% Ficoll gradient and centrifuged at 100,000 x rcf for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The non-synaptic mitochondria pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer without EGTA and centrifuged at 10,000 x rcf for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove Ficoll and then re-suspended to a final concentration of approximately 10 mg/ml in isolation buffer without EGTA. The synaptosomal layer was removed from the 7.5%-10% Ficoll interface, re-suspended in isolation buffer and spun at 13,000 x rcf for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove Ficoll. The synaptosome pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer with EGTA, placed into a nitrogen bomb at 1200 psi for 10min at 4\u00b0C to release synaptic mitochondria, (\nBrown et al., 2004\n;\nKristian et al., 2006\n) layered onto a second discontinuous 7.5% and 10% Ficoll gradient, and centrifuged at 100,000 x rcf for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The synaptic mitochondria pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer without EGTA and centrifuged at 10,000 x rcf for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove Ficoll and resuspended to a final concentration of approximately 10 mg/ml in isolation buffer without EGTA. Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and measured at absorbance 562 nm with a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader (Winooski, VT, USA). Beginning at 48h after TBI, mitochondria obtained from individual animals were pooled based on protein yield, and therefore, each individual n for time points 48h and beyond represents 1-2 animals. Mitochondria were immediately used for respiratory analysis.\n\nMeasurement of e\nx vivo\nmitochondrial respiratory function\nMitochondrial respiratory rates were measured using a Clarke-type electrode in a continuously stirred, sealed and thermostatically-controlled chamber (Oxytherm System, Hansatech Instruments Ltd., Norfolk, England, UK) maintained at 37\u00b0C as previously described (\nHill et al., 2017\n;\nMustafa et al., 2010b\n;\nSingh et al., 2006b\n;\nSingh et al., 2007\n;\nSullivan et al., 2003\n;\nSullivan et al., 2004\n) Mitochondria loaded into the chamber were normalized based on protein content: 40-100 \u03bcg of isolated mitochondrial protein were placed into the chamber with 250 \u03bcl KCl-based respiration buffer (RB; 125 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCh, 2.5 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 20 mM HEPES and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.2) warmed to 37\u00b0C and allowed to equilibrate for approximately 1 min. State II respiration was fueled by addition of the Complex I substrates, 5 mM pyruvate and 2.5 mM malate. One minute later, two boluses of 150 \u03bcM ADP were sequentially added to the mitochondria to initiate state III respiration, followed by the addition of 2 \u03bcM oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATPase, to monitor state IV respiratory rate for an additional 2 min. To assess the uncoupled respiratory rate (State V (I)), 2 \u03bcM FCCP was added to the mitochondria, followed by the addition of 1 \u03bcM rotenone to shut down Complex I-driven respiration completely. Complex II-driven respiration (State V (II)) was then initiated with the addition of 10 mM succinate, a Complex II substrate. The slope of the oxygen consumption trace corresponded with the respiratory rate and the respiratory control ratio (RCR) was calculated by dividing the State III oxygen consumption rate (defined as the maximal rate of respiration in the presence of ADP, second bolus addition) by State IV oxygen consumption rate (defined as the rate of respiration in the presence of oligomycin, using the last 30 sec of the 2 min after the addition of the substrate). Mitochondria were isolated and prepared fresh for every experiment and were used immediately for respiration assays and then stored at \u221280\u00b0C for fijrther analysis.\n\nPreparation of cortical mitochondrial samples for measurement of oxidative damage\nA portion of the isolated cortical mitochondria was used for the quantitative measurements of 4-HNE and acrolein as an index of LP-mediated oxidative damage. Mitochondrial samples were centrifuged at max speed for 10 min to remove residual isolation buffer. The pellets were re-suspended in 20-30 \u03bcl ice-cold Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton-X, 20 mM tris-HCl, 150 mM Nad, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) with protease inhibitors. Samples were then briefly sonicated, repeatedly vortexed, and incubated on ice for 45 minutes, then centrifuged at max speed for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were collected for protein assay and stored at \u221220\u00b0C.\n\nMeasurement of mitochondrial reactive aldehydes by Western blot\nForty microgram aliquots of cortical mitochondrial protein samples were resolved on 12% Bis-Tris Criterion\u2122 XT pre-cast sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide (SDS-PAGE) gels (BioRad, Hercules, CA; 20 \u03bcl total volume) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry electro-transferring unit set at 15V for 60 min at 4\u00b0C. Following gel transfer, membranes were incubated in a TBS blocking solution with 5% milk for 1 hr at room temperature (RT). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and imaged to validate sample loading/lane. For detection of proteins, the membranes were incubated with one of the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-4-HNE (1:2,000) (Alpha Diagnostics Inti. (ADI), San Antonio, TX), rabbit anti-acrolein (1:2,000) (Abeam, Cambridge, MA) in TBS-T with 5% milk on an orbital shaker overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing with TBS and TBS-T, the membranes were incubated for an hour at RT with an infrared-labeled secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IRDye 800 (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE) to bind to the primary antibody. The bound complex was detected using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor). The images were analyzed using the Odyssey Application Software (Image Studio) to obtain the integrated intensities (OD values) of the bands between 150 \u2013 50 kD (see boxed area on gel images in\nFigures 13\n\u2013\n16\n). Briefly, values obtained from the image analysis were normalized for loading consistency to account for lane-to-lane variability as well as normalized to a control sample that was run on each gel to account for any gel-to-gel variability, as previously described (\nHill et al., 2017\n).\nFigure 13:\nOpen in a new tab\nAcute administration of PZ at 15 min post-TBI does not significantly reduce 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) accumulation within isolated cortical mitochondria at 24 hpi in young adult male rats. Representative Western blots demonstrate the differences in the accumulation of 4-HNE in protein samples from non-synaptic (A) and synaptic (B) mitochondrial populations. Quantification of 4-HNE bands (C) between the 150 and 50 kD (see outlined boxes) revealed no significant dose-dependent effects at this time for either the non-synaptic or synaptic mitochondrial populations; however, the synaptic mitochondria isolated from animals treated with the 10 mg/kg dose were almost significantly reduced compared to the vehicle-treated group. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD; a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\ntests revealed significant differences:\nx\np = 0.0776; n = 8 vehicle, n = 6 for all other grps.\nFigure 16:\nOpen in a new tab\nAcute administration of 2 doses of PZ at 15 min (10 mg/kg) and at 24 hrs (5 mg/kg) post-TBI demonstrates significant reduction in acrolein accumulation within isolated cortical mitochondria at 48 hrs following a severe (2.2 mm) CCI-TBI in young adult male rats. Representative Western blots demonstrate the differences in the accumulation of acrolein in protein samples from non-synaptic (A) and synaptic (B) mitochondrial populations. Lanes on the gel labeled similarly identify samples from the same group, but separate animals (for example, Veh, Veh). Quantification of acrolein bands (C) between 150 and 50 kD (see outlined boxes) reveals significant elevation in acrolein accumulation in the non-synaptic and synaptic mitochondria from vehicle-treated animals compared to sham. This was reduced by this particular PZ dosing paradigm; the reduction, however, was not significant compared to the levels in the vehicle-treated groups. Comparisons of the values for either non-synaptic or synaptic mitochondrial populations were made across all the groups; notable comparisons against sham (*). Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD; a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc\ntests revealed significant differences: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001; n = 4-5 sham, n = 6-8/TBI grp.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed with Prism version 8.0 (Graph Pad, San Diego, CA).

To determine significance for the improvement (%) comparisons, the \u201c\nN\n\u2013 1\u201d Chi-square (\u03c7\n2\n) test was performed using MedCalc statistical software (available online at\nwww.medcalc.org\n). Paired, two-tailed Student t-tests were used to compare the overall improvements (%) between the groups. For all data sets, a p-value of < 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval was defined as statistically significant. For some comparisons that came close to this value (p < 0.06 or p < 0.07, for example), they are reported as well as they may illustrate biological importance despite being statistically insignificant. All data for graphical representation are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD)."

MRI acquisition\nAll MRI was performed using a horizontal bore Biospec 11.7 T scanner (Bruker). For transmission, a 72 mm volume resonator coil was used, while for acquisition a 2 \u00d7 2 phased array coil was used. The slice thickness was 2 mm (0.7 mm to locate structures) and the field of view was 13 \u00d7 13 mm for MR images. The following scan parameters were used for T2-weighted MRI: Repetition time/Echo time (TR/TE) = 2000/20 ms, a rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) factor = 8, number of averages (NA) = 4, and matrix size = 128 \u00d7 128. For onVDMP CEST MRI, the scan parameters were TR/TE = 5000/25 ms, RARE factor = 10, NA = 1, repetitions = 9, B\n1\n= 46.8 \u00b5T, 32 pulse-exchange modules with a 2 ms pulse width, eight delays (mixing times from 1.14 to 100 ms), and matrix size = 128 \u00d7 128.\n\n2.4. MRI analysis\nMRI analysis was performed using custom-written MATLAB programs described previously (\nXu et al., 2017a\n). In EAE studies, regions of interests (ROIs) were defined by anatomical segmentation based on the Allen atlas (\nwww.brain-map.org\n;\nFig. 1\n). To minimize partial volume effects due to interindividual heterogeneity of the lateral ventricles, ventricular signal was evaluated at the adjacent 3rd ventricle (\nFig. S1\n). ROIs were not adjusted over time as ventriculomegaly and brain atrophy (\nAharoni et al., 2013\n;\nMacKenzie-Graham et al., 2012\n) are not observed in this model at these time points. In the na\u00efve transplantation study, ROIs were defined as an oval with a voxel size equivalent to 2.5 \u00b5L (injection volume) at and contralateral to the transplantation site (\nFig. S1\n). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad software. One-way analysis of variance with a Tukey post-doc or a student\nt\n-test was used for comparison. Statistical significance was defined as\np\n< .05.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nSpatiotemporal changes of onVDMP CEST MRI signal during the disease course of EAE in non-transplanted mice.

Female C57Bl/6 mice (\nn\n= 6\u20138 per group), 6\u201310 weeks old, were injected s.c. with 200 \u00b5L of MOG\n35\u201355\npeptide (0.5 mg/mL) emulsified in incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant supplemented with\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\nH37Ra (5 mg/mL). Mice were injected i.p. with 300 ng of pertussis toxin at the day of induction and two days later. Animals were monitored daily for 28 days after induction and scored for clinical disease signs as follows: 0 = asymptomatic; 1 = atonic tail; 2 = partial hind limb paralysis; 3 = paraplegia; 4 = quadriplegia; and 5 = moribund/death due to EAE. Na\u00efve mice were also assessed for comparison (\nn\n= 4\u20135).\n\n2.6. Cell transplantation\nMultiple transplantation experiments were performed to evaluate the contribution of the transplantation procedure, transplanted GRPs, transplant-mediated immune response, and tissue protection/repair by transplanted GRPs to the onVDMP signal changes that were observed (\nTable S1\n). To minimize risk of injection-mediated tissue injury, GRPs were transplanted at maximal density (2 \u00d7 10\n8\ncells/mL) at an injection volume of 2.5 \u00b5L (5 \u00d7 10\n5\ncells) per site for the parenchyma (\nFainstein and Ben-Hur, 2018\n;\nRumajogee et al., 2018\n) and 5 \u00b5L (1 \u00d7 10\n6\ncells) per site for the ventricles (\nKim et al., 2012b\n), consistent with previous reports on murine cell transplantation.\nTo evaluate the contribution of transplanted GRPs and transplant-mediated immune response to the onVDMP CEST MRI signal, 5 \u00d7 10\n5\ncells in sterile PBS were stereotaxically injected into na\u00efve Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212\n(\nn\n= 5) and C57Bl/6 mice (n = 5), using a Hamilton 31G micro-injection needle into the striatum (1 mm AP, 2 mm ML from bregma, 3.0 mm DV), which is a site that has been demonstrated by multiple groups to be permissive to the initial engraftment of transplanted cells (\nFainstein and Ben-Hur, 2018\n;\nJanowski et al., 2014\n;\nWalczak et al., 2007\n). Injections were unilateral with the contralateral side serving as control. Animals were imaged biweekly with BLI (n = 5 per group) until cell engraftment stabilized or rejection occurred (1, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 17 days after transplantation). Animals were imaged with MRI 3 and 17 days after transplantation.\nTo evaluate the therapeutic potential of GRPs to attenuate and/or ameliorate EAE, up to 2 \u00d7 10\n6\ncells were injected into the lateral ventricle (0 mm AP, \u00b1 1 mm ML from bregma, 2.5 mm DV) or the motor cortex (2 mm AP, \u00b1 1 mm ML from bregma, 1.2 mm DV) prior to onset (6\u20138 days after induction,\nn\n= 6\u20138 per cohort/group of which 4 were randomly selected for imaging). These locations were chosen based on their interaction with multiple brain and spinal cord structures associated with hindlimb movement. Injections were bilateral due to variability in presentation of diffuse injury observed in this model by multiple groups (\nBelloli et al., 2018\n;\nThomas et al., 2020\n). Na\u00efve mice or non-transplanted EAE mice served as control. Animals were imaged with MRI 5\u20136 days after transplantation in EAE mice (\nn\n= 4 per group), within the time-frame when most onVDMP CEST changes were observed (\nFig. 1\n) (\nThomas et al., 2020\n).\n\n2.7. Histopathology\nBrain tissue was collected 21 days after transplantation and 29 days after EAE induction. Brain tissue was perfused with paraformaldehyde (4%), cryosectioned into 20 \u00b5m thick slices and stained with rabbit anti-luciferase (Abcam, A21176, 1:100 dilution) or rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Dako, Z0334, 1:500), and goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 594 (Invitrogen, A11012, 1:250) antibodies. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Apotome 2 microscope digital imaging system. For quantification of GFAP staining intensity, ROIs defining the corpus callosum were manually selected."

    "Methods": "Rodents\nAll experiments were performed in accordance with the research guidelines set forth by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and were in accordance with National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH publication No. 80\u201323) revised in 1996 and the ARRIVE guidelines. Wild type (WT) CD-1 were purchased from Charles River laboratories. The germline LIF deficient mouse line was provided by Dr. Douglas Fields (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) with permission from Dr. Colin Stewart (Institute of Medical Biology, Singapore)(\nStewart et al., 1992\n) and was backcrossed at least 10 times onto a CD1 background Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Following delivery, litter sizes were adjusted to approximately 6 male and 6 female pups per litter and to normalize pup weights. Animals were group housed and kept on a 12-h light:dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and autoclaved water. Pups remained with the dam until the day of H-I injury.\n\nNeonatal H-I Brain Injury\nCerebral H-I in 9-day-old mouse pups (P9, day of birth = P0; mean body mass = 8 g), as a model of late preterm injury, was performed as previously described (\nGuardia Clausi and Levison, 2017\n;\nKim et al., 2017\n). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3\u20134% induction, 1\u20132% maintenance) prior to right common carotid artery cauterization. A special effort was made to carefully isolate the carotid artery without damaging other structures contained within the carotid sheath (i.e., internal jugular vein and vagus nerve). The neck incision was sutured with 4\u20130 surgical silk. Following a one-hour recovery period, mice were exposed to 65 min. of hypoxia in humidified 10% oxygen/nitrogen balance at 36\u00b0 C. Sham mice were anesthetized and underwent isolation of the right common carotid artery without cauterization followed by exposure to hypoxia. Mice were randomly assigned to experimental groups after H-I injury. Sample sizes per experiment were chosen to achieve sufficient statistical power with minimal numbers of animals based on pilot studies.\n\nDrug Administration\nWe tested several protocols for administering LIF to mice. We varied the dose, vehicle, administration duration and timing of administration. From those trials, we established the protocol described below. Three days after H-I (P12), mice were mildly anesthetized (isoflurane, 3\u20134% induction, 1\u20132% maintenance), and placed in a supine position. We administered a total volume of 10 \u03bcL of LIF (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA, Cat. # LIF2010) at 2 \u03bcg/mL dissolved in water, applied as 2 \u03bcl drops alternately to each nostril, every 2 minutes. Control mice received intranasal vehicle (water). LIF was diluted in water as pilot studies had found that mice that were administered LIF dissolved in PBS appeared uncomfortable tried to expel the LIF whereas they tolerated LIF dissolved in water much better. Mice were treated every 12 hours for 3 consecutive days. To establish whether LIF readily entered the brain, uninjured mice were mildly anesthetized on P12 and either 10 \u03bcl of LIF or vehicle was administered intranasally. Animals were euthanized 30 min later to evaluate the pStat-3 level in the brain.\n\nHistology and Immunofluorescence\nTwo weeks after H-I injury (P23), mice were deeply anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (87.5 mg/kg) and xylazine (12.5 mg/kg) and then perfused with 3% paraformaldehyde. Whole brains were dehydrated in 70% ethanol and embedded into paraffin. A total of nine sections per brain were used to evaluate the damage produced by the H-I insult. Forebrain hemisphere size was assessed from sections taken 0.2 mm from Bregma while hippocampal size was assessed from sections \u22122.4 mm from Bregma. All sections were Nissl stained with cresyl violet and imaged using an Olympus BX51 microscope (Center Valley, PA, USA), captured by a Q-imaging Retiga-2000R CCD camera (Surrey, BC, Canada) and acquired on PictureFrame software (Optronics, Goleta, GA). Sections were labeled with random codes and evaluated by an investigator who was blinded to the identity of the samples. Stereological volume assessments of the cortex, striatum, hippocampus and thalamus were produced using the Cavalieri principle associated with the counting point method as described elsewhere (\nAlles et al., 2010\n).\nThree days (P12) or 2 weeks (P23) after H-I injury, mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine before intracardiac perfusion with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brains were postfixed overnight and embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT matrix (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA). Serial coronal sections 20 \u03bcm thick were taken through the corpus callosum and striatum using a cryostat cooled to \u221214\u00b0 C and mounted onto Superfrost+ slides. Sections were stained with a 0.0001% solution of Fluoro-Jade C (Millipore, Watford, U.K.) in 0.1% acetic acid as described previously (\nGoodus et al., 2016\n). Other sections were incubated with primary antibodies in 1% goat serum/0.05% Triton X-100/PBS at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Primary antibodies included: (1) anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (rabbit polyclonal; Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA, Cat. # Z0334; 1:500); (2) anti-Iba-1 (rabbit polyclonal; Wako Chemicals Richmond, VA, USA, Cat. # 019\u201319741; 1:250); (3) anti-CD68 (rat monoclonal; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA, Cat. # MCA1957; 1:50); (4) anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) (mouse monoclonal; Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA, Cat. # SMI-99p; 1:1000); (5) anti-pStat3 (rabbit monoclonal; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA, Cat. # 9145S; 1:100). Secondary antibodies against the appropriate species were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies included: (1) donkey anti-mouse Alexa 488 (Cat. # 715-485-151); and (2) donkey anti-rabbit Cy5 (Cat. # 711-175-152); (3) donkey anti-rat Alexa 488 (Cat. # 712-546-153) (all from Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA; 1:250). Sections were mounted in Prolong Gold Antifade with DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).\nThree sections per brain and three fields per section were used to evaluate the integrated optical densities (IOD). Sections were 400 \u03bcm apart from each other, representing different levels of the regions of interest. To reduce the variability in signal intensity, sections were stained at the same time. Negative control sections, where the primary antibody was replaced with normal serum were used to define the background for the staining. Images were collected using an Olympus AX70 microscope (Center Valley, PA, USA) and Q-imaging Retiga-2000R CCD camera (Surrey, BC, Canada) using the same exposure time setting, brightness and contrast for each fluorophore. IODs were adjusted to reduce the background signal using FiJi (\nhttps://imagej.net/Fiji\n). White matter thickness was assessed from MBP stained sections taken 0.2 mm from Bregma. Images were analyzed using FiJi software. Fifteen regions per section were randomly picked and the area of corpus callosum and external capsule were measured. All sections were analyzed by an investigator who was blinded to the experimental groups.\n\nEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\nThree days after H-I injury (P12), microdissected brain tissue from the affected neocortex, striatum, and corpus callosum from the injured (ipsilateral) hemispheres was collected either as a single wedge of infarcted tissue or as microdissected regions. The tissue was homogenized and then sonicated in lysis buffer. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), artemin and Prokineticin-2 content in the supernatants were assayed by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using ELISA kit from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) for mouse IGF-1 (Mouse/rat IGF-1 DuoSet ELISA Kit, DY791) and mouse artemin (Mouse Artemin DuoSet ELISA Kit, DY1085\u201305) and for Prokineticin2 using an ELISA kit purchased from FineTest (Mouse Prok2 ELISA kit, EM0493, Wuhan, Hubei, China)\n\nBehavioral Testing\nAt P22, all animals were subjected to a battery of behavioral test by an investigator who was blinded to the experimental groups. All mice were familiarized with the testing environment before performing any of the tests. The following behavioral tests were administered: (1) Modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS):\nTable 1\ndescribes a set of motor (muscle status, abnormal movement), sensory (visual, tactile, proprioceptive), reflex and balance tests forming the modified mNSS (\nGuardia Clausi and Levison, 2017\n). (2) Beam walking test: This test was used to evaluate motor function. The mice were placed at the end of wooden beams 30 cm in length suspended 42 cm above the ground. Three different beam widths were used (1.5, 1 and 0.7 cm). A dark box with bedding at the other end of the beam served as a target for the mice. The number of foot slips was recorded and assessed. (3) Sticker removal test: This test examines somatosensory asymmetry (\nSchallert et al., 1983\n). Each animal received a training trial and a test trial one day later. The latency to remove the adhesive labels attached to the contralateral forelimb was recorded for the test trial.\nTable 1.\nModified neurological severity scoring (mNSS).\nTask\nDescription\nSuccess/Failure\nMono-/Hemiparesis\nParesis of upper and/or lower limb\n0\n1\nStraight walk\nAlertness, initiative, and motor ability to walk straight\n0\n1\nTail position\nTail position is either up (normal) or down (impaired) while walking\n0\n1\nStartle reflex\nInnate reflex of bounce in response to a loud hand clap\n0\n1\nCircle exit\nAbility to exit a large round container through the exit in 2 minutes\n0\n1\nGrip test\nAbility to grip forcep s with all four limbs\n0\n1\nRound stick balancing\nAbility to balance on a round stick of 5 mm diameter for at least 10 seconds\n0\n1\nBeam walk: 1.5 cm\nAbility to walk straight\n0\n1\nBeam walk: 1 cm\nTwo or more slips\n0\n1\nBeam walk: 0.7 cm\nTwo or more slips\n0\n1\nMaximal score\n0\n1\nOpen in a new tab\n\nData Analysis and Statistics\nRaw data from Fiji analyses and behavioral tests were imported into Prism 8 (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) for statistical analyses using ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc intergroup comparison or using Student\u2019s t-test.

    "Methods": "Study Approval - Procedures Involving Animals\nAll procedures involving the use of animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Virginia and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Virginia Tech.\nSexually mature adult animals were used for RNA sequencing (ages 2-4 months) and proteomics (P40), since the postnatal progressive microcephaly associated with CASK heterozygosity has stabilized by this age. EEG experiments were conducted at either P7-P14 for pups or between 2 and 4 months of age for adults. The age range for pups (P7-P14) was chosen since this stage of murine development is considered equivalent to human infancy; between 2 and 4 months was chosen for adult mice so as to observe changes between genotypes once the microcephalic phenotype has plateaued.\nCask\n+/\u2212\nmutants and\nCask\n+/+\nwild-type (WT) littermates are both from a C57BL/6J background and were backcrossed for at least 25 generations. Mice were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction followed by gel electrophoresis with primers targeted to the exon 1-intron 1 boundary of CASK.\n\nElectrode Implantation Surgery and EEG Data Acquisition\nPups\nPups (P7-P14) were anesthetized using 5% isoflurane for induction and 2-2.5% isoflurane for maintenance adapted from a previously published protocol [\n31\n]. Unipolar insulated stainless steel depth electrodes were stereotaxically implanted in the right hippocampus and right parietal cortex, with two reference electrodes on the left parietal cortex and the cerebellum. After the surgery, pups were allowed to recover for 24 hours with the mother. The next day, the pups were connected to a video-EEG monitoring system via a flexible cable connected to the amplifier. The output signal was amplified using a Grass amplifier (Model1, Natus Neurology Incorporated-Grass Products, Warwick, RI), digitized and recorded for later review using Labchart software (ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand).\nAdults\nFemale C57BL/6J mice of each genotype (four WT and three\nCask\n+/\u2212\n) between 68 and 93 days old were initially anesthetized using 5% isoflurane and head-fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus with continual 3% isoflurane administration throughout the surgery. Burr holes were drilled free-handed through the skull at 3mm anteroposterior and 3mm mediolateral from bregma to expose the dura. Two stainless steel electrodes were lowered into the hippocampus and overlying cortex; electrode positions were verified in post-hoc analysis by the presence of a characteristic theta peak recorded from hippocampal electrodes. Mice were allowed to recover for at least 6 days post-surgery before recordings began.\n\nPTZ Experiments\nAdult mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 40mg/kg of PTZ. If the animal did not seize for approximately 10 minutes after the first injection, then 20mg/kg of PTZ was injected every approximately 10 minutes until the animal seized. The highest dose received in the study was 80mg/kg of PTZ. Latency to seizure was calculated from the time of the first injection to electrographic seizure onset, and duration was calculated by the time length of electrographic seizure.\n\nEEG Data Analysis\nRaw data were visually inspected within the GRASS Technologies software for epileptiform activity by two trained observers. Upon identification of a seizure, the video recording was inspected to rule out artifacts due to movement or physical alterations in the recording setup. While blinding was not possible during recording due to the noticeably smaller size of the\nCask\n+/\u2212\nmice, subsequent spectral analyses were conducted by an independent experimenter blinded to the genotypes corresponding to each recording. Power spectra were calculated using the EEGlab toolbox in MATLAB2017a. Data were sampled at 400Hz. 20-hour-long epochs spanning the full day and majority of the night were used for spectral analysis, including periods of sleep and wake as well as all typical locomotor behaviors. No raw data during this 20-hour period was excluded from downstream analysis. The raw data were filtered from 0-50Hz using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter, DC offset was removed, and mean power spectral densities were calculated using the spectopo() function in EEGlab with a window length of 400 samples, FFT length of 400, and 0 overlap for each channel independently over 20 hours of recording. The mean power spectral density for hippocampal and cortical electrode placements were then averaged within each genotype. These genotype averages were then compared between WT and (\nCask\n+/\u2212\nconditions. Subsequently, the 0-50Hz filtered data was manually binned into frequency ranges of 0-4Hz, 4-8Hz, 8-12Hz, 12-15Hz, 15-20Hz, 20-30Hz, and 30-50Hz. Mean power spectral densities for each genotype in each frequency bin were calculated and compared as described above. Data were analyzed for statistical significance (p<0.05) using an f-test to determine homogeneity of variation and then a two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test with equal variance for all comparisons; data were collected from three\nCask\n+/\u2212\nmice and four WT mice.\n\nRNA Sequencing Analysis\nWhole brain RNA was extracted from four\nCask\n+/\u2212\nand four WT adult mice (age 2-4 months) using Aurum\u2122 Total RNA Fatty and Fibrous Tissue kit from Biorad following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. PolyA mRNA was extracted and fragmented into 180-200 nucleotide fragments. RNA sequencing experiments were performed at the Biocomplexity Institute of Virginia Tech on an Illumina Nextseq 500 platform. Strand-specific libraries were constructed using Illumina\u2019s TruSeq Stranded mRNA HT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, RS-122-2103). Generated libraries were validated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and clustered. Single-stranded, paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 (sequencing reagent kit was NextSeq 500/550 High Output kit V2; P/N FC-404-2005) with 75-bp read lengths (1 x 75; 400 million clusters). Illumina NextSeq Control Software v2.1.0.32 with Real Time Analysis RTA v2.4.11.0 was used to provide the management and execution of the NextSeq 500 and to generate BCL files. The BCL files were converted to FASTQ files using bcl2fastq Conversion Software v2.20, and sequences were trimmed of adapters and demultiplexed using ea-utils and Btrim [\n32\n,\n33\n]. Sequencing reads were then aligned to the genome (Ensembl Mus_musculus.GRCm38.78) using Tophat2/HiSat2 [\n34\n] and counted via HTSeq [\n35\n]. Quality control summary statistics were examined to identify any problematic samples (e.g. total read counts, quality and base composition profiles (+/\u2212 trimming)). Following successful alignment and counting, mRNA differential expression was determined using contrasts of reads from the two groups and tested for significance using the false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini-Hochberg) corrected Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) in the R-package DESeq2 [\n36\n]. The gene ontology classification of significant changes (p\nadjusted\n<0.05) was performed on the NIH DAVID web interface (\nhttps://david.ncifcrf.gov/\n).\n\niTRAQ Proteomics\nThree C57BL/6J mice from each genotype (WT and\nCask\n+/\u2212\n) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the brains were hemisected. One hemisphere of each brain was used for isobaric Tagging for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) [\n37\n]. iTRAQ experiments were performed commercially by MtoZ Biolabs (Boston, MA, USA). Total brain protein was extracted by physical homogenization in lysis buffer and subjected to trypsin digestion at a concentration of 0.025\u03bcg/\u03bcL overnight at 37\u00b0C. The TMT10plex Isobaric Label Reagent Set from Thermofisher Scientific (USA) dissolved in 41\u03bcL anhydrous acetonitrile was used to label peptides. The three WT samples were labelled with TMT10-126, TMT10-129N, and TMT-129C respectively; the three\nCask\n+/\u2212\nsamples were labelled with TMT10-130N, TMT10-130C, and TMT10-131N, respectively. Peptides were subjected to tandem LC-MS/MS using an Easy-nLC1000 chromatograph (Thermofisher Scientific, USA) and an Orbitrap\u2122 Fusion\u2122 Lumos\u2122 Tribrid\u2122 Mass Spectrometer (Thermofisher Scientific, USA).The raw MS/MS data were searched against the UniProt\nMus musculus\nprotein database using Proteome Discover 2.1 (Thermofisher Scientific, USA) using the following parameters: protein modifications were set to carbamidomethylation (C) (fixed), oxidation (M) (variable); enzyme set to trypsin; maximum missed cleavages set to 2; precursor ion mass tolerance set to 10ppm; MS/MS tolerance set to 20ppm. The resulting proteomic changes between WT and CASK\n+/\u2212\nwere selected based on significance (p<0.05) using a one-tailed Student\u2019s t-test assuming equal variance comparing abundance levels for each peptide between the three\nCask\n+/\u2212\nand three WT samples. Only changes with p<0.05 between groups were analyzed. Significant changes were categorized into subcellular compartments by using the GO_CC_DIRECT algorithm (NIH DAVID). The changes were also categorized into functional pathways using the KEGG_PATHWAY algorithm to sort them into functional categories (NIH DAVID). We also performed R spider analysis and Profcom GO analysis using the bioprofiling.de web interface [\n38\n,\n39\n].\n\nCo-Immunoprecipitation Mass Spectroscopy\nThese experiments were done using methodology described previously [\n29\n]. Briefly, lysates of HEK 293 cells expressing either GFP or GFP-CASK were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with whole rat brain lysate, to allow in vitro complex formation. Both cellular and rat brain lysates were made using a solubilizing buffer consisting of 20mM HEPES-KOH (pH7.2), 150mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X 100, 1% sodium deoxycholate and protease inhibitor cocktail. The lysate mixture was filtered through 0.2 micron filter and pre-cleared with glutathione agarose for 2 hours. GFP-Trap beads were subsequently incubated with the lysate mixtures for an hour to precipitate GFP-tagged proteins. Beads were washed thrice with ice cold solubilizing buffer without protease inhibitors. The GFP-Trap beads were then treated with trypsin, and peptide mixtures were then separated by nano-liquid chromatography (1260 Infinity from Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry with an LTQ XL\u2122 linear ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). Separation columns were prepared in-house using 100 \u03bcm i.d. fused silica capillaries (Polymicro Technologies Phoenix, AZ) and 5 \u03bcm Zorbax SB-C18 particles (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The length of the column ranged from 10 cm to 12 cm. Mobile phases A and B consisted of 0.01% TFA in 4% and 90% acetonitrile, respectively. The peptides were eluted at a flow rate of ~160-180 nL/min by using a 200 min long gradient with increasing concentrations of solvent B [\n40\n]. MS data were acquired via a data-dependent acquisition strategy by performing Zoom/MS2 scans on the 5 most intense peaks in each MS scan. Data were acquired over a mass range of 500 \u2013 1600 m/z. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) was performed at a normalized collision energy of 35%, activation Q = 0.250, and activation time of 30 msec. The threshold for triggering MS2 scans was set as 100 counts. The data-dependent parameters were set for exclusion mass width \u00b11.5 m/z, zoom scan width \u00b1 5 m/z, dynamic exclusion repeat count 1, repeat duration 30 sec, and exclusion duration 60 sec, and exclusion list size of 200. The Thermo Proteome Discoverer 1.4 software package was employed to search the MS/MS spectra against the\nRattus norvegicus\n(Rat) protein database (SwissProt/TrEMBL, combined 36081 entries) extracted from UniProt on November 7, 2017 (\nhttps://www.uniprot.org\n) (rat brain homogenate was used for protein interactions). The database search used the Sequest HT algorithm and included fully tryptic peptides with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages, minimum/maximum peptide length of 6/144, precursor ion mass ranging from 500-5000 Da with a precursor ion tolerance of 2 Da and fragment tolerance of 1 Da, no posttranslational modifications, and a stringent FDR of <1 % and relaxed of <3 %. In the case of 0 peptides coming down with GFP, a threshold of at least 2 peptide spectrum matches from a protein coming down with CASK-GFP was qualified as a putative interaction. In cases with background binding with GFP-beads, 3 times more peptides coming down with CASK over GFP alone was used as a threshold to identify putative interactors."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAdult male C57BL/6N mice (10 weeks old, weighing 22-25 g) from Charles\nRiver Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) were used in this study as described (\nSamantaray et al., 2015\n). Animals were\nhoused (4/cage) under standard conditions (12-hour light-dark cycles,\n23\u00b0C, and 55% relative humidity) with ad libitum access to food and\nwater. Mice were handled and cared for in accordance with the National\nInstitutes of Health (NIH, Bethesda, MD)\nGuide for the Care and Use of\nLaboratory Animals\n(NIH publication 80-23, revised 1996) and\napproved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the\nMedical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston, SC (Approval number:\nAR 2228). MPTP was also handled according to recommended precautions (\nJackson-Lewis and Przedborski, 2007\n;\nJakowec and Petzinger, 2004\n;\nPrzedborski et al., 2001\n). Mice were caged\nindividually after MPTP injections in disposal cages.\nAdult male Long Evans rats (200\u2013225) were also received from\nCharles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) (\nFarrand et al., 2017\n). These rats were housed in an Association for\nAssessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC)\naccredited facility at MUSC, with two rats per cage until surgery; they were\nsingle-housed post-surgery. The facility was kept at 20-22 \u00b0C with a\n12-hour light-dark cycle, and food and water were provided ad libitum. All\nprocedures were approved by MUSC\u2019s IACUC (Approval number: AR 2228).\n\nMPTP model and calpeptin treatment\nC57BL/6N mice were divided into the following groups: (1) control+saline\n(n=4); (2) control+calpeptin (n=4); (3) subacute MPTP (n=6); and (4)\ncalpeptin+subacute MPTP (n=6). Experiments were repeated, and data sets were\npooled from at least 3 independent experiments for statistical analyses. To\ninduce the sub-acute MPTP model, single injections per day of 25mg/kg of MPTP\n(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA; Catalog #: M0896) were injected (i.p) for 5\nconsecutive days. This regimen provided a high rate of animal survival\n(>90%), apoptotic mode of cell death as originally suggested (\nTatton and Kish, 1997\n), and ~40-50%\ndopaminergic cell loss on the 7\nth\nday after the last MPTP injection\n(\nJackson-Lewis and Przedborski,\n2007\n). To test neuroprotective efficacy, 25\u03bcg/kg of calpeptin (EMD\nMillipore Biosciences, Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ, USA; Catalog# 208733) was\ninjected 30 minutes prior to each MPTP administration. Mice were also treated\nwith calpeptin for five days following administration of MPTP. Calpeptin was\nroutinely dissolved in 2.5mg/mL DMSO as stock and diluted 1000-fold in saline to\nattain the optimum concentration of 25\u03bcg/kg in mice (s.c. \u2264\n200-250 \u03bcL/mice). This dose was chosen as a median dose between a less\nefficacious 10\u03bcg/kg and more toxic 100\u03bcg/kg. A cumulative dose of\n125\u03bcg/kg calpeptin over five days was well-tolerated with no change in\nmouse survival.\n\nN-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine hydrochloride\n(DSP-4)/6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of PD\nAdult male Long Evans rats (200-225g, Charles River) were randomly given\neither noradrenergic neurotoxin DSP-4 (50 mg/kg, i.p.,) or saline (0.9%sodium\nchloride, i.p., Hospira) (\nFarrand et al.,\n2017\n). Seven days later, all rats were deeply anesthetized with\nisoflurane (5% for induction, 2-3% for maintenance, Piramal Healthcare), and\n0.1mg/kg bupivacaine (Hospira) was administered subcutaneously at surgical\nsites. The rats were then placed into a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting) and\nreceived bilateral intrastriatal injections of either the dopaminergic\nneurotoxin, 6-OHDA (6ug/uL, 2uL/side, made with 0.02% ascorbate (Sigma) or\nsterile saline (controls), at the following coordinates: Hole 1: AP +1.6, ML:\n\u00b12.4, DV \u22124.2; Hole 2: AP +0.2, ML \u00b13.7, DV \u22125.0\n(Paxinos, Rat atlas REF). The injection syringe remained in place for 5 min to\nallow for maximal absorption before slowly retracting and suturing the skull\nincision. They were not treated with calpain inhibitor. Twenty days later the\nrats were euthanized (between 0800 and 1200), and spleen samples were processed\nfor Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) (\nHaque et al., 2017\n;\nSamantaray et al., 2016\n).\n\nWestern blot analysis\nBrain (micro-punched SN), spinal cord (cervical), and spleen tissues\nwere homogenized in an ice-cold homogenizing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 5\nmM EGTA) with freshly added phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM) (\nSamantaray et al., 2015\n). Protein\nconcentration was estimated with Coomassie Plus\u2122 Protein Assay Reagent\n(Pierce, Rockford, IL) at 595 nm. Samples were equilibrated (1:1 v/v) in sample\nbuffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 10%\nglycerol), boiled, and briefly centrifuged. Supernatants were diluted to a final\nprotein concentration of 1.5 mg/mL with sample and homogenizing buffer mix (1:1\nv/v) containing bromophenol blue dye (0.01%). Protein samples were resolved in\neither 4-20% sodium dodecyl sulfate pre-cast gradient gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories,\nHercules, CA, USA) at 100 V for 1 hour (or 7.5 % for spectrin breakdown products\nfor 90 minutes) and transferred to the Immobilon\u2122-polyvinylidene fluoride\nmicroporous membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) in a Genie transfer\napparatus. Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffer (20 mM\nTris\u2013HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween-20) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C\nwith appropriate primary IgG antibodies. Antibodies used were mouse monoclonal\nanti-\u03b1-spectrin (1:10,000; Biomol. International, Plymouth Meeting, PA,\nUSA; # E-AB-30060.60); Bax (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA, B-9, Cat\n#: sc-7480) and Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA, C-2, Cat#:\nsc-7382); Calpain 2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA, sc-373966), and\nrabbit polyclonal anti-m-calpain (1:500) raised and characterized in our\nlaboratory (\nBanik et al., 1983\n). Bound\nprimary antibodies were visualized with corresponding secondary horseradish\nperoxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:2000; MP\nBiomedicals, Solon, OH, USA; # SKU 0855293) and detected with enhanced\nchemiluminescence reagents (ECLplus, Amersham, UK) (\nSamantaray et al., 2015\n). Images were then captured\non Alpha-Innotech with FluorChem FC2 Imaging System (Cell Biosciences Inc.,\nSanta Clara, CA, USA). Immunoblots, except those for spectrin, were re-probed\nwith mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b2-actin (1:15,000 dilution, Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA, Cat. # sc-81178) antibody or GAPDH\n(MilliporeSigma, Danvers, MA, USA, Cat. # MAB374) as protein loading controls.\nThe immunoreactive bands of interest were quantified by densitometric analysis\nusing ImageJ 1.45 software.\n\nFlow cytometry\nPooled freshly isolated splenocytes (2\u00d710\n5\ncells/group, n=3-4 per group) obtained from naive control, MPTP, and calpeptin\ntreated mice were stained with CD8-FITC (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA; #553031)\nand CD4-PerCP (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA: #553052) as previously described\n(\nSamantaray et al., 2015\n). Other\nantibodies used were: PE Granzyme B Monoclonal Antibody (eBioscience, Waltham,\nMA, USA, #12-8898-82), APC anti-mouse Perforin antibody (BioLegend, San Diego,\nCA, USA, #154304), and PE anti-mouse CD25 Antibody (BioLegend, San Diego, CA,\nUSA, #101904). Flow cytometric two-parameter dot plots and quadrant statistics\nwere generated using FACScan and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, Mountain\nview, CA, USA). For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized\nusing Fix and Perm reagents (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and incubated with\nspecific antibodies (\nGod et al., 2015\n;\nGod et al., 2014\n). Briefly,\n5\u00d710\n5\ncells per group were re-suspended in 0.5 mL of\nFixation/Permeabilization Buffer and incubated at 2-8\u00b0 C for 30 minutes.\nAfter washing, the cell pellet was re-suspended in Permeabilization/Wash Buffer\nand stained with CD4-PerCP, CD8-FITC, APC-perforin and PE-granzyme B. Cells were\nthen analyzed on FACScan using CellQuest software as described above.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nBrain and spinal cord samples were cut into thin (10 \u03bcm for\nmidbrain through SN and 5 \u03bcm for spinal cord) sections in a Leica CM1850\ncryostat (Leica, Deerfield, IL). Sections were fixed in 95% ethanol, rinsed in\nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS, containing 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 11.9 mM\nphosphates, pH 7.4), and stored in the same buffer at 4\u00b0C for in situ\nimmunofluorescence staining. Slices were blocked for 1 hour in PBS containing 2%\nhorse, goat or sheep serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and incubated with\nrespective primary IgG antibodies. Antibodies used were: mouse monoclonal\nanti-tyrosine hydroxylase (MilliporeSigma, Danvers, MA, USA, AB152; 1:100);\nanti-NeuN (MilliporeSigma, Danvers, MA, USA, MAB377; 1:100); rabbit polyclonal\nactive calpain (1:100) raised and characterized in our laboratory (\nBanik et al., 1983\n;\nSamantaray et al., 2007\n); mouse monoclonal\nanti-pan-neuronal neurofilament non-phosphoneurofilament specific marker or\ndeNFP, (1:1000, Covance, Inc., Emeryville, CA, USA; SM1312); and OX-42 (Abcam,\nCambridge, MA, USA, AB1211; 1:100). Other antibodies used were calpain 2 (Santa\nCruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA, sc-373966), NeuN (MilliporeSigma, Danvers,\nMA, USA, MAB377), CD4 (ProteinTech, Chicago, IL, USA, 19068-1-AP), and Granzyme\nB (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA, ab4059). Spleen samples from DSP-4/6-OHDA (lesion)\nand control rats were also cut into thin (10 \u03bcm) sections in a Leica\nCM1850 cryostat (Leica, Deerfield, IL), fixed in 95% ethanol, rinsed in PBS, and\nstored in the same buffer at 4\u00b0C for immunofluorescence staining (\nSamantaray et al., 2007\n;\nSamantaray et al., 2013\n). Slices were blocked for 1\nhour in PBS containing 2% horse, goat or sheep serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,\nMO) and incubated with respective primary IgG antibodies. Unbound primary\nantibodies were washed off by 3\u00d7 5-minute rinses in PBS. Bound primary\nantibodies were visualized by incubation with either fluorescein isothiocyanate\n(FITC) - or Texas Red-conjugated corresponding secondary IgG antibodies (1:100;\nVector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). All sections were rinsed in PBS and\ndistilled water and mounted with anti-fade medium Vectashield\u2122 (Vector\nLaboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). The images were viewed using an Olympus BH-2\nmicroscope (Olympus, Melville, NY) at 200x magnification at a pixel resolution\nof 1280 \u00d7 1024. Images were captured with a Dage CCD100 integrating\ncamera (DAGE-MTI, Michigan City, IN, USA) and a Flashpoint 128 capture board\n(Integral Technologies, Indianapolis, IN). Image capture was performed on a\nPentium IV Imaging workstation (Dell Computers, Round Rock, TX, USA), using\nMagna Fire Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA).\nImage formatting was done using Photoshop software (Adobe, San Jose, CA).\n\nStatistical analysis\nData analyses were performed by GraphPad Software, and the differences\nwere calculated with either one-way ANOVA or student\u2019s t test. Changes\nbetween groups were considered significant at *p \u2264 0.05 compared to\ncontrols or\n@\np \u2264 0.05 compared to calpeptin treatment groups.\nComparisons of protein expression and associated statistical analysis were made\nbetween different conditions or groups of interest using the normalized read\ncounts. The immunoreactive bands of Western blotting and staining intensities in\nIHC were quantified by densitometric analysis using ImageJ software (U.S.\nNational Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The mean \u00b1 SEM. of\narbitrary units (A.U.) was plotted. Assessment was also done using Stat View\nsoftware (Abacus Concepts), and the difference was calculated with one-way ANOVA\nwith Fisher\u2019s protected least significant difference\npost\nhoc\ntest at a 95% confidence interval."

Mice\nWe used age- and weight-matched C57B/6 male and female (wild-type) WT mice generated in our breeding colony at UConn Health animal facility. Mice were fed standard chow diet and water\nad libitum\n. Standard housing conditions were maintained at a controlled temperature with a 12-h light/dark cycle. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Connecticut Health and conducted in accordance with the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\n2.3. Experimental design and animals\nEight- to twelve-week-old mice were subjected to right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) for 60 min followed by 3 (acute) or 30 (chronic) days of reperfusion. A total of 174 mice were randomly divided into vehicle (0.5% methyl cellulose, oral gavage) and 5-BDBD (1 mg/kg PO daily \u00d7 3 days starting after 4 h of MCAo) groups. After stroke, mice in the acute cohort were sacrificed for various biochemical and histological analyses, while mice in the chronic survival cohort were subjected to neurobehavioral analysis at days 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28 using rotarod and open-field tests, and day 29 for tail suspension test. A detailed list of mice and their use in each group are given in\nTable 1\n. Mice from the chronic survival cohort were harvested for either immunohistochemistry (IHC) infarct/atrophy assessment after paraformaldehyde perfusion fixation or were flash-frozen for subsequent biochemical analysis. Similarly, mice from the acute survival group were either fixed or flash-frozen for various activities as listed in\nTable 1\n. We chose 3 and 30 days post-stroke as representative time points for acute outcomes (peak of post-stroke inflammation) and long-term chronic recovery (translationally relevant), respectively.\nTable 1:\nNumber of mice utilized in each experiment\nGroups\nAcute (3 days post-stroke)\nLong-Term (30 days post-stroke)\nIHC/ Infarct analysis\nWestern/ Protein\nFlow Cytometry\nEvans Blue Dye (EBD)\nqPCR/ RNA Seq\nWestern/ Protein\nIHC/ Atrophy/Behavior\nqPCR/ RNA Seq\nVehicle\n12\n8\n11\n7\n8\n6\n18\n5\nExcluded (died)\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n6\n1\n*\n5-BDBD\n24\n6\n12\n9\n6\n4\n19\n4\nExcluded (died)\n0\n1\n2\n1\n1\n0\n1\nTotal no. of mice\n37\n17\n27\n19\n17\n13\n44\n9\nOpen in a new tab\nNote:\n*\nFor 5-BDBD Group IHC/Infarct Analysis consists of n=3 (0.3 mg/kg); n=3 (3 mg/kg); n=18 (1 mg/kg). Other parameters of 5-BDBD were recorded at dose 1mg/kg.\n\n2.4. In vitro efficacy of 5-BDBD\nHuman P2X4R-expressing cells (HEK 293) were trypsinized, counted, and seeded in black, clear-bottomed 96-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells per well and incubated overnight. The next day, media was removed from cell plates and 25 \u03bcl of assay buffer (1.11 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.43 mM MgCl\n.\n6H\n2\nO, 0.36 mM MgSO\n4\n.\n7H\n2\nO, 4.98 mM KCl, 0.39 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 122 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 4.86 mM D-glucose, 17.7 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) was added. Calcium 5 dye (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) was diluted in assay buffer and 10 \u03bcl was added to the wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. Compound dilutions (including serial dilutions) were performed in 100% DMSO then transferred to intermediate dilutions for a very limited amount of time (<10 min) just before adding to the cell plate. The final concentration of DMSO in the assay was 0.5%. Various concentrations of 5-BDBD were added using a manual multichannel pipettor and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The plates were then placed in the fluorescent imaging plate reader (FLIPR) and fluorescence monitored every 1.52 seconds. After baseline reading of standard agonist ATP (10 \u03bcl of 1 \u03bcM) for 20 seconds, ivermectin (100 nM) was added and the fluorescence was monitored for 5 min at excitation/emission: 488 nm/510\u2013570 nm. Details of their HEK 293 stability and validation data is available on\nhttps://www.sbdrugdiscovery.com/p2x-receptors.asp\nwhich was the original source this cells and data. Briefly HEK cells were transfected with sequence-verified P2X4 expression plasmid using standard chemical transfection reagents and single cell clones were cultured under antibiotic selection. Surviving clones were screened using a FLIPR assay to identify clones showing correct pharmacology and optimal window over un transfected cells. The best clone was then characterized using manual patch clamp electrophysiology. Attached is a datasheet from the manual patch clamp assay. More details can be found on\nhttps://www.sbdrugdiscovery.com/datasheets/SB-HEK-P2X4%20Datasheet.pdf\n\n2.5. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo)\nWe induced focal transient cerebral ischemia by a 60 min right MCAo under isoflurane anesthesia followed by reperfusion for either 3 or 30 days as described previously (\nVerma et al., 2017\n). Briefly, we proceeded with midline ventral neck incision and unilateral right MCAo using a 6.0 silicone rubber-coated monofilament (size 602145/602245; Doccol Corporation, Sharon, MA) placed 10\u201311 mm away from the bifurcation point of the internal carotid artery through an external carotid artery stump. Rectal temperatures were monitored and maintained at 37\u00b10.5\u00b0C with the help of a heating pad. We used laser Doppler flowmetry (DRT 4/Moor Instruments Ltd, Devon, UK) to measure cerebral blood flow and to confirm occlusion [reduction to 15% of baseline cerebral blood flow; {452\u00b172 (pre MCAo or baseline vrs. 69\u00b117 (after occlusion) perfusion unit}] and reperfusion. All animals were fed wet mash for one week after surgery to ensure adequate nutrition for chronic endpoints, as animals have rearing deficits after stroke. In sham surgery mice, we performed identical surgeries except the suture was not advanced into the internal carotid artery.\n\n2.6. Cresyl violet staining for infarct volume and tissue atrophy analysis\nAt the end of the experiment, mice were anaesthetized using an overdose of avertin (250 mg/kg intraperitoneally [i.p.]). Following blood collection, mice underwent transcardiac perfusion with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and then transferred to cryoprotectant (30% sucrose in 1x PBS) for 72 h prior to sectioning. Brains were then sliced into 30 \u03bcm free-floating sections using a freezing microtome. A total of eight slices covering ischemic territory were mounted and stained with cresyl violet to assess infarct volume (3 days after stroke) and tissue atrophy (30 days after stroke) as described earlier (\nVerma et al., 2017\n). An investigator blinded to the experimental cohort conducted the data analyses.\n\n2.7. Quantitative PCR (qPCR)\nTrizol (Ambion, Life Technologies Camarillo, CA) method was utilized for total RNA isolation from right hemisphere (perilesional cortex) of vehicle-treated and drug-treated WT mice. Reverse transcription (RT) and qPCR was carried out in accordance with manufacturer instructions - TaqMan RNA reverse transcription kit and TaqMan universal master mix reagent (Ambion, Life Technologies, Camarillo, CA).\n\n2.8. RNA-Seq\nDetails can be found in\nsupplementary files\n\n2.9. Behavioral analysis\nDetails can be found in\nsupplementary files\n\n2.10. Flow cytometry analysis of resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes\nFor sorting microglia and monocytes using flow cytometry, we collected and prepared tissue samples as described before (\nVerma et al., 2017\n). Briefly, all the cells isolated from the interphase 70%/30% Percoll gradient were washed and blocked with mouse Fc Block (clone 93, eBioscience, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) before staining for 30 min in dark and cold conditions with primary antibody-conjugated fluorophores: CD45-eF450 (clone 2D1, eBioscience), CD11b-APCeF780 (clone M1/70, eBioscience), Ly6G-AF700 (clone 1A8, eBioscience), Ly6C-PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone HK1.4, BioLegend, San Diego, CA), CX3CR1 APC (Clone SA011F11, BioLegend), and P2X4R-FITC (AFR-024-F, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel). Cells with marker profile CD45\nint\nCD11b\n+\nLy6C\n\u2212\nCX3XR1+ were identified as resident microglia, while those with CD45\nhi\nCD11b\n+\nLy6C\n+\nLy6G\n\u2212\nwere categorized as bone marrow-derived monocytes and CD45\nhi\nCD11b\n+\nLy6C\n+\nLy6G\n+\nas bone marrow-derived neutrophils. For live/dead cell discrimination, a fixable viability dye, carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester (CASE-AF350, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), was used at a dilution of 1:300 from a working stock of 0.3 mg/mL. LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Billerica, MA) enabled with FACsDIVA 6.0 (BD Biosciences, Billerica, MA) and FlowJo (Treestar Inc., Ashland, OR) software was used for data acquisition. The gating for each antibody being used was determined based on fluorescence minus one control.\n\n2.11. ImageStream data acquisition and analysis\nFlow-sorted microglia and monocytes from mouse brain were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and images of individuals from each sample (1000 cells/sample) were acquired on the ImageStream\u00aeX MARK II (Amnis Corp., Seattle, WA). P2X4R-FITC and CD11b-APCeF780 cell-surface expression levels were analyzed using the ImageStream Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS, Amnis) as described previously (\nLapilla et al., 2011\n). Ratio of P2X4R/CD11b surface expression was used on Y axis to compare P2X4R surface expression between the groups and cells type. CD11b was used a marker of myeloid cells.\n\n2.15. Western blot analysis\nMice were euthanized 3 or 30 days after stroke surgery with an overdose of avertin (250 mg/kg, i.p.). Following collection of blood from the right ventricle, mice underwent transcardiac perfusion using cold PBS supplemented with 5 mM EDTA. The brain was removed and perilesional cortical tissue from the right (ischemic) hemisphere was isolated and homogenized as described previously (\nVerma et al., 2016\n). Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL). 20 mg of protein was loaded into each well of 4\u201315% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight [P2X4R (1:500); BDNF (1:1000)] followed by incubation in HRP-linked secondary antibody. Chemiluminescent HRP substrate was used for developing the blot and \u03b2-Actin (1: 3000) was probed as loading control.\n\n2.16. Immunohistochemistry\nImmunostaining was used to visualize differences in the quantity and morphology of microglia/macrophages between 5-BDBD and vehicle-treated groups. Additional brain slices (30 \u03bcm) that were sectioned on a freezing microtome for infarct and atrophy analyses were mounted on the glass side. Antigen retrieval was done using citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and sections were incubated with blocking buffer followed by incubation overnight with primary antibodies [TMEM119 1:500; Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1) 1:1000; from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) and P2X4R (1:150, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel)]. Three coronal brain sections per mouse (n = 4 per group) were taken 0.45 and 0.98 mm from bregma, stained, and visualized for quantification at 20x magnification at the junction of core and penumbra regions. A blinded observer quantified IBA1, TMEM119, and P2X4R-positive alone or co-labelled cells using Image J software (NIH). DAPI staining was used to determine the number of nuclei and to assess gross cell morphology. The average numbers of cells visualized from 3 separate regions at the junction core and penumbra were recorded for each mouse.\n\n2.17. Evans blue dye (EBD) blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability assay\nEBD (4 ml/kg body weight) was prepared as a 1% solution in 0.9% saline and injected as a single bolus (i.v.) 2 h prior to sacrifice in stroke mice. Thereafter, mice were euthanized by overdose of avertin (250 mg/kg, i.p.) and were transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline to wash out the remnant dye and brains were collected. Right hemispheres were isolated followed by extraction of EBD in 50% TCA at 1:3 volume ratios. Isolated brain regions were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer and the extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7\ng\nfor 20 min to remove precipitates. Supernatant was collected and 30 \u03bcl was added per well of a 96-well plate following addition of 90 \u03bcl of 95% ethanol. Proper mixing was assured by pipetting and absorbance was read at 620 nm. A standard curve (1\u2013200 \u03bcg) was used to calculate unknown concentrations of EBD uptake and data expressed as \u03bcg/mg tissue.\n\n2.18. ELISA for IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 expression in plasma and tissue\nBlood samples from both vehicle- and 5-BDBD-treated groups were collected in 40 mM\nEDTA before sacrificing mice. Plasma was collected by centrifugation (10,000 \u00d7 g, 10 min, 4\u00b0C) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further use. Similarly, a small fraction of whole cell tissue lysate from biochemical analysis was separated for tissue analysis of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 using a Mouse ELISA ready-set-go kit (eBioscience).\n\n2.19. Statistics\nData from each experiment were represented as mean \u00b1 SD and significance was determined using Student\u2019s t-test for comparing the experimental groups between vehicle and drug (5-BDBD) treatment at days 3 and 30. If there were more than two groups, the data were analyzed by one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Bonferroni post-hoc test with repeated measure for correction of multiple comparisons (GraphPad Prism Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Owing to the ordinal nature of ND scores, the Mann-Whitney U test was used for ND score analysis. For survival curve analysis we used log-rank (Mantel-cox) analysis to determine statistical significance between the groups. The probability value of\np\n<0.05 was considered statistically significant. An investigator blinded to the experimental groups carried out the behavioral experiments and final data analyses of all the experiment. Experimenters were not blinded for biochemical experiments."

    "Methods": "2.1. Subjects\nYoung adult male (n = 84) or female (n = 96) Sprague-Dawley rats were received from Charles River Breeding Labs (Hollister, CA) and maintained in standard temperature and lighting conditions (23 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C, 12 h/12 h lighting cycle (06:00\u201318:00 h) with food and water available ad libitum. Rats were acclimated to their environment for 1wk prior to experimentation. Rats were randomized to drug and experimental groups listed in\nTable 1\n. Sample size was estimated using G*Power 3.1 (Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf). Experimenters were blinded to conditions. All procedures were approved by the UCLA Chancellor\u2019s Committee for Animal Research and the manuscript prepared according to ARRIVE guidelines for reporting animal research.\nTable 1.\nExperimental groups.\nMITO (E/L)\nIrradiated (E/L)\nVeh-SHAM\n(3/3)\n(3/3)\nVeh-CCI\n(6/6)\n(6/6)\nGLC\n(6/6)\n(6/6)\nBHB\n(6/6)\n(6/6)\nLAC\n(6/6)\n(6/6)\nCOMBO\n**\n(6)\n(6)\nOpen in a new tab\nExperimental groups and n for either male or females.

Cannulations\nAnesthesia was induced with 3% isoflurane vaporized in 100% O\n2\nand then maintained with 2% isoflurane during surgery. The femoral artery and vein were cannulated with a polyethylene tube (PE-50) on the day of study and animals were restrained to a piece of cardboard during the length of infusion. After completion of infusion, the cannula was tied off and the area sutured closed and animals were returned to their home cage.\n\n2.3. CCI injury\nAnesthesia was induced with 3% isoflurane vaporized in 100% O\n2\nand then maintained with 2% isoflurane during surgery. The head was positioned in a stereotaxic frame, a midline incision was made, and a 6-mm craniotomy was drilled centered at \u22124 mm anterior-posterior (AP), 5 mm midlateral (ML) relative to bregma. A CCI injury was produced on the exposed left cortex using an electronically controlled pneumatic piston cylinder (Hydraulics Control, Inc., Emeryville, CA) as previously described (\nPrins et al., 2004b\n). In the present study, the 5 mm diameter flat rod tip was angled at 22.5\u00b0 away from vertical and compressed the cortex at 1.9 m/s to a depth of 2 mm. After injury, a small piece of gel foam was placed over the craniotomy site to reduce bleeding and the wound sutured closed. Sham injured rats received only a craniotomy but no cortical injury.\n\n2.4. Substrate administration and infusion\nGroups received a 3 h i.v. infusion of either saline (0.9%), lactate (100 mM), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) (2 M) or glucose (30%) at a flow rate of 10.8 \u03bcl/s based on previous publications (\nPrins et al., 2004a\n,\n2004b\n;\nRice et al., 2002\n;\nShijo et al., 2015\n). To best target treatment during hyper- or hypo-metabolic periods there were two distinct infusion start times. To target the hyper-metabolic state, early infusion was started immediately following injury, while late infusion began 6 h post-injury during the hypo-metabolic phase. Immediately prior to the start of infusion and immediately after, venous blood was collected in EDTA collection tubes and spun at 3000\ng\nfor 10 min and plasma was collected. Glucose and lactate were measured using Stat Profile Prime (Nova Biomedical) while BHB while measured using BHB Stat Site BHB test strips and meter (Stanbio).\n\n2.5. Tissue fixation\nTissue was fixed using microwave irradiation in order to effectively reduce postmortem changes of energy-related metabolites/enzymes in the nervous tissues (\nSharpless and Brown, 1978\n). All animals were anesthetized with isoflurane before a beam of microwave irradiation at 2450 MHz and nominal output of 3.5 kW was focused for 2.45\u20132.90 s directly on the head (Thermex-Thermatron Model 4104 Microwave Fixation System, Louisville, KY). Individual irradiation time was adjusted based on the minimal time necessary for the temperature of the core to reach 80 \u00b0C, which is sufficient to denature enzymes (\nGuidotti et al., 1974\n). Rats were quickly decapitated and the brains were dissected hemispherically, placed into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, and ipsilateral cortex was submerged into methylbutane on dry ice before storing at \u221270 \u00b0C prior to metabolite quantification.\n\n2.6. Mitochondrial isolation\nRats were briefly restrained within a decapicone (Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA) and euthanized by decapitation and the ipsilateral peri-contusional cortex was rapidly dissected and homogenized in ice-cold isolation buffer (225 mM mannitol, 25 mM sucrose, 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4 at 4 \u00b0C). The homogenate was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 3 min. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 8 min. The pellets were resuspended in 1.5 ml isolation media and 4 ul of 10% digitonin was added. The tubes were gently inverted 6 times and left to incubate on ice for 4 min and then spun at 14000 rpm for 8 min. The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of isolation buffer and 10 mg/ml de-fatted bovine serum albumin was added. After a final centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 8 min, the mitochondria were resuspended in 30 ul of EGTA free isolation media.\n\n2.7. Protein determination\nProtein concentrations were measured using a Lowry DC kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA) with bovine serum albumin used as concentration standards.\n\n2.8. Mitochondrial respiration\nThe respiratory activities of isolated brain mitochondria were measured polarimetrically with a Clark-type oxygen electrode apparatus (Hansatech Instruments, Norfolk, England). Mitochondria were suspended at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in buffer containing 125 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM K\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.01 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n(pH 7.0) at 37 \u00b0C, plus glutamate (5 mM) and malate (0.1 mM). Addition of ADP (0.5 mM) was used to initiate State 3 (phosphorylating) respiration. Oligomycin (2.5 \u03bcg/ml), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, was used to induce State IV (resting) respiration. Maximal respiration was initiated with the addition of the protonophore uncoupler, FCCP (54 nM). Rates of oxygen consumption are expressed as nmol O\n2\n/mg mitochondrial protein/min). The respiratory control ratio (RCR) is defined as the rate of ADP-stimulated oxygen consumption (State III) divided by the rate of respiration determined in the presence of oligomycin (State IV).\n\n2.9. Mitochondrial H\n2\nO\n2\nproduction\nAdapted from Starkov (\nStarkov, 2010\n), deenergized mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) were suspended in 200ul of respiration buffer containing 4/U of horseradish peroxidase and 10 \u03bcM Amplex red. The background fluorescent signal was read for 120 s (555ex/581em). NAD+ linked respiratory substrates were added and baseline H\n2\nO\n2\nproduction was recorded for 120 s. 10 \u03bcM rotenone was added to stimulate H\n2\nO\n2\nproduction and production was again recorded for 120 s.\n\n2.10. Western blots\nTissue homogenates were lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.6 at 4 \u00b0C) containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Calbiochem). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE (4\u201312% Bis-Tris gels, Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Invitrogen), blocked in TBST plus 5% non-fat milk and then incubated with the following primary antibody: HMGB-1 (Abcam, ab18256) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The membranes were then washed and TBST and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The washed membranes were then treated with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (Thermo Scientific). All Blots were developed using ChemiDoc XRS+ Molecular Imager (BioRad) and analyzed using Quantity One software (BioRad). Band densities were normalized to the total amount of protein loaded per lane using Sypro Ruby (BioRad).\n\n2.11. Citrate synthase activity\nCitrate synthase activity was quantified in isolated mitochondria according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Sigma-Aldrich).\n\n2.12. Metabolic quantification\nMicrowave irradiated tissue was utilized to prevent endogenous breakdown of glycogen (Sigma-Aldrich), ATP (Abcam) and acetyl CoA (Sigma-Aldrich), while mitochondria were deproteinated with perchloric acid. Metabolites were quantified according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n2.13. Statistical analysis\nData are expressed as means \u00b1 SEM of n different experiments or a five-number summary of the data set. Differences between independent groups were assessed using either Student\u2019s\nt\n-test or one-way ANOVA, with Tukey\u2019s test for comparison between groups using SPSS Software 25. (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). P < .05 was considered to be statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Materials\nReagents were from purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise indicated. Cell culture supplies were obtained from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY).\n\nCell culture\nRat cortical neurons and established MCF10A cell lines were cultured as described below. Because we could not achieve a high transfection efficiency using neurons, the established cell lines were employed to demonstrate the comparison of genetically manipulated cell populations.\nPrimary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from a pool of embryonic day 18 rat cortices (~10 per preparation) that were obtained from both males and females (\nStoica et at. 2005\n,\nYakovlev et at. 2001\n). The University of Maryland Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all procedures, which were in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. A cell density of 60,000-100,000 cells/well (0.32 cm\n2\n) was used in V7-PS or V28-PS microplates (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Cytosine arabinofuranoside (5 \u03bcM, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cultured cells after four days\nin vitro\nto inhibit glial proliferation. The neurons were maintained for 11-15 days\nin vitro\nas described (\nClerc & Polster 2012\n), with this method yielding a >95% neuron-enriched culture at the time when experiments were performed (\nLaird et al. 2013\n).\nMCF10A human mammary epithelial cells stably overexpressing BCL-2 or harboring an empty vector (pcDNA3) were described previously (\nMartin & Leder 2001\n). These cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and F12 medium (DMEM-F12) containing 5% horse serum and the following supplements: hydrocortisone (0.5 \u03bcg/ml), insulin (10 \u03bcg/ml), epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml), penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/ml). Cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO\n2\n.\n\nOxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements by cell-based respirometry\nOxygen consumption by intact or permeabilized cells was measured at 37\u00b0C using a Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (\nWu et al. 2007\n,\nGerencser et al. 2009\n). Cells cultured in V7-PS or V28-PS plates were washed twice in 0.5 ml of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) assay medium and then incubated in 0.675 ml aCSF at 37\u00b0C in a CO\n2\n-free incubator for one hour prior to measurements. The aCSF consisted of 120 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.4 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 5 mM HEPES, 4 mg/ml fatty acid free bovine serum album (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue No. A6003), and 15 mM glucose, pH 7.4. As described previously (\nClerc & Polster 2012\n), experiments in which cells were permeabilized during the course of the assay were performed in aCSF containing an increased concentration of HEPES (20 mM instead of 5 mM) to limit the extent of acidification caused by the binding of calcium to the EGTA in the permeabilization mixture (see below).\nRespirometry assays consisted of cycles of 2-3 min mix, 3 min wait, and 2 min measure for experiments with intact cells and of 2.5 min mix, 0.5 min wait, and 2 min measure for experiments in which cells were permeabilized. The shortened measurement cycle allowed for a greater number of measurements following permeabilization before the time-dependent decline of mitochondrial function. The compounds described in the figure legends were injected sequentially from stocks prepared in 75 \u03bcl assay medium at 10X, 11X, 12X, and 13X the final working concentration for injections 1-4, respectively. Drug concentrations described throughout the article are the final working concentration unless otherwise specified.\nTo measure oxygen consumption by permeabilized cells, saponin (25 \u03bcg/ml) was co-injected with 3.6 mM K\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 1 mM ADP, 5 mM EGTA, and either a combination of pyruvate and malate (5 mM each) or succinate (5 mM) and rotenone (0.5 \u03bcM). The saponin concentration was optimized both for cell type and the individual saponin lot, as the purity of the active saponins (amphipathic glycosides) depends on the source. Both saponin and pyruvate were prepared freshly from powder in aCSF for all experiments. EGTA, which releases a proton when it binds to calcium (\nPatton et al. 2004\n), was diluted from a 250 mM stock that was pH-adjusted to 7.4. The aCSF pH was reduced to 7.0 following injection of the permeabilization mixture, modeling a normal cytoplasmic pH.\nFor the Complex I-III-IV-linked NADH oxidation assay, the bacterial pore-forming peptide alamethicin (40 \u03bcg/ml) was added in conjunction with saponin to porate the mitochondrial inner membrane, and NADH (2 mM, prepared freshly in aCSF) replaced the Complex I or ll-linked substrates in the permeabilization mixture. Purified horse heart cytochrome\nc\n(100 \u03bcM) was included to replace endogenous cytochrome\nc\nloss. Neurons cultured in V28-PS microplates were used for this assay. V28-PS microplates have a measurement volume of 28 \u03bcl, in contrast to the 7 \u03bcl measurement volume of V7-PS plates. The greater volume prevents excessive oxygen depletion of the media during the measurement period (e.g. when rates exceed 1000 pmol O\n2\n/min), extending the upper limit of accurate OCR measurements. These plates are very useful for respirometry assays using mitochondria-rich cells like neurons and cardiomyocytes that have high respiratory capacity.\n\nData analysis\nThe percent change rather than the absolute OCR is of the most interest when comparing OCR after drug exposure to OCR pre-exposure within a single population of cells. Therefore, to reduce variability primarily due to well-to-well differences in cell plating/survival, results are generally depicted as normalized OCR (% baseline rate) as previously described (\nWu et al. 2007\n,\nSchuh et al. 2011b\n). Both absolute and baseline-normalized OCR values are shown in the\nFig. 1\noptimization example. All data, with the exception of this example in\nFig. 1\n, are representative of at least two independent experiments performed in at least duplicate.\nFig. 1.

FCCP was added sequentially at 4 \u03bcM and 2 \u03bcM, respectively, followed by pyruvate (pyr, 10 mM) and antimycin A (Anti A, 1 \u03bcM).\nA & C\n) Absolute OCR values are shown (mean \u00b1 SD, n=3 wells).\nB & D)\nBaseline-normalized OCR values relative to the third rate, which was set at 100%, are displayed."

    "Methods": "The Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pittsburgh approved all protocols involving the use of animals in this study.\n\n2.1. Surgical procedures\nA total of 17 adult cats (6 males and 11 females, weight: 2.5\u20134.1 kg) were used in this study. The animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (2\u20135% in oxygen) during surgery and then switched to \u03b1-chloralose anesthesia (initial 65 mg/kg i.v. and supplemented as needed) during data collection. The left cephalic vein was catheterized for administration of anesthetics and fluid. A tracheotomy was performed and a tube was inserted to keep the airway patent. A catheter was inserted into right carotid artery to monitor systemic blood pressure. Heart rate and blood oxygen level were monitored by a pulse oximeter (9847 V; NONIN Medical, Plymouth, MN) attached to the tongue. Through an abdominal incision, the ureters were transected, ligated, and then drained externally. A single-lumen urethral catheter (2.3 mm inner diameter) was inserted into the bladder via a small anterior urethrotomy and fixed in place by a suture around the urethra. The urethral catheter was attached to a T-adapter to allow for simultaneous bladder pressure recording via a pressure transducer/amplifier (BLPR2/TBM4M, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL 34240) and bladder distention via a reservoir filled with saline or 0.5% AA. Bladder pressure was maintained at a constant level by adjusting the height of the reservoir connected to the urethral catheter. The HGNs were isolated bilaterally, tied, and then transected. The peripheral ends of the HGNs were laid on a small black platform to facilitate nerve splitting. The HGNs were immersed in a warm (35\u201337 \u00b0C) mineral oil pool formed by retracting the abdominal skin flaps using sutures.\n\n2.2. Recording action potential from single or multiple HGN fibers\nWhile observed through a microscope fine-tipped forceps were used to repeatedly spilt the HGN into 15\u201325 filaments that are small enough for recording individual action potentials. During the experiment each HGN filament was placed on a bipolar hook electrode composed of0.2 mm stainless-steel wires with a 2\u20133 mm distance between the wires. The action potentials were differentially amplified with a gain of 10,000\u201320,000 and filtered with a frequency band of 30\u201330,000 Hz by a P511 preamplifier (Grass Instruments, MA) with a needle reference electrode inserted in the adjacent abdominal skin. The amplified signal was displayed on an oscilloscope for real-time identification of single-fiber or multiple-fiber spikes that were isolated using a signal amplitude discriminator (custom-made) that was in turn connected to a rate meter (custom-made) for monitoring firing frequency. By adjusting the threshold levels of the signal amplitude discriminator, action potentials of the same amplitude were selected as the triggers for the oscilloscope to only display these action potentials and examine the shape of the action potentials. During multiple-fiber activity, the discriminator could isolate and display on the oscilloscope multiple action potentials of different amplitude and shape. If multiple-fiber activity was identified during saline distention, the nerve filament was spilt into finer filaments if possible in an attempt to record single units. Nerve splitting was not performed once the bladder distention was changed from saline to 0.5% AA. The recordings were sampled at 20 kHz by an analog-to-digital converter (PCI-6024E, National Instruments, TX) and saved in a computer running the LabVIEW program (National Instruments, TX) for off-line data analysis.\n\n2.3. Experimental protocol\nInitially, HGN afferent activity was recorded from every nerve filament during saline distention of the bladder. The responses of HGN afferents to graded increases in intravesical pressure (10 cmH\n2\nO steps) were examined at pressures between 10 and 80 cmH\n2\nO by raising a saline reservoir to different heights. At each pressure level, bladder distension was maintained for 30 s. Then, the reservoir was lowered to 0 cmH\n2\nO level for 30 s before raising to the next higher-pressure level. Multiple afferent axons on different nerve filaments were tested with saline distension and then one HGN filament that exhibited optimal single or multiunit recording was selected for further testing using bladder distension with 0.5% AA. Responses to at least two series of graded saline distensions between 10 and 80 cmH\n2\nO served as a control for responses to distension with AA.\nThen, the bladder was washed 2\u20134 times by instilling 10\u201320 mL of0.5% AA for 5\u201310 min each time to irritate the bladder. The order of preference for selecting the HGN filament for AA testing was: 1. a filament with single-fiber activity and responses only to high pressures (\u226550 cmH\n2\nO), 2. a filament with multiple-fiber activity and responses only to high pressures (\u226550 cmH\n2\nO), 3. a filament with single-fiber activity and responses to low pressures (\u226440 cmH\n2\nO), 4. a filament with multiple-fiber activity and responses to low pressure (\u226440 cmH\n2\nO). The selected HGN filament was tested during AA irritation at different distention pressures (10\u201380 cmH\n2\nO) in the same way as in the saline test.\nIn another series of experiments nerve filaments that did not respond to saline distention were re-tested after AA irritation by dis-tending to a range of pressures with 0.5% AA in an attempt to identify mechano-insensitive \u201csilent\u201d HGN afferent fibers that could be activated by bladder irritation. After determining the pressure response for these silent HGN afferent fibers in the presence of AA, the bladder was flushed with saline. The procedure to switch from AA to saline was same as the procedure to switch from saline to AA. For these experiments the nerve filaments with single-fiber activity were preferentially selected.\n\n2.4. Data analysis\nThe random artifacts with amplitude larger than the action potential spikes were identified by thresholding and then removed by a LabVIEW program. Action potentials from single afferent fibers were identified based on their similar amplitude and shape. The nerve filament that only had action potentials from a single fiber was marked as \u201cSingle\u201d, while the nerve filament that had action potentials of different amplitude and shape from multiple fibers was marked as \u201cMultiple\u201d. The single- and multiple-fiber nerve filaments were analyzed separately. The number of action potentials during the 30 s of bladder distention at different pressures (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 or 80 cmH\n2\nO) was counted using the LabVIEW program by setting a threshold level to distinguish the HGN fiber spikes from baseline activity. To calculate the peak firing rate of HGN spikes, a 1-s window was used to count the number of spikes at any time point by sliding the window across the entire recording period and the results were displayed as pulses per second (pps) over time. The mean firing rate was calculated by the total spikes during the 30 s distention divided by the time. For each nerve filament, the numbers of spikes measured during each 30-s bladder distention at different pressures (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 or 80 cmH\n2\nO) using saline or AA distension were all normalized to the measurement during 80 cmH\n2\nO saline distention. For silent nerve filaments that did not respond to saline distention but became responsive to AA distention, the number of spikes was normalized to the measurement during 80 cmH\n2\nO AA distention. The normalized data from different animals under the same conditions are presented as mean \u00b1 SE. Repeated measures ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison or the Mann Whitney\nt\n-test were used in this study to detect statistical significance (\np\n< .05)."

Animals were immunized with peptides from the N-terminal EGF-like repeat of human NOTCH3: ACLCPPGWGERCQLED. Splenic lymphocytes from immunized rabbits were fused to form hybridomas that were cloned and screened for secretion of antibodies exhibiting binding to the immunizing peptides (performed by Epitomics).

Two of these antibodies, UMI-D and UMI-F, exhibited similar characteristics and were used extensively in this study (see\nResults\n).\nProtein analysis\nNTF was synthesized by ThermoScientific. Lyophilized NTF was reconstituted in dH2O at 1ug/uL and aliquoted and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. All protein treatments were performed in PBS with supplemental chemicals, as noted in specific experiments. At the end of each treatment, proteins were denatured in sample buffer with or without 5% beta-mercaptoethanol and boiled at 100\u00b0C for 5 minutes. All samples were separated on standard 8\u201316% tris-glycine or 10\u201320% tricine gels (ThermoFisher and Bio-Rad) and electroblotted to nitrocellulose using the iBlot 2 system (Invitrogen). Western Blot analysis was performed with antibodies as indicated, followed by incubation with infrared fluorophore labeled secondary antibodies (Rockland). Bands were detected using a Licor Odyssey infrared scanner. To visualize total protein, standard Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad) staining and silver staining (ThermoScientific) protocols were used. For relative analysis of NTF proteins, multimerized NTF was compared to monomer NTF by antibody detection and normalized to multimerized/monomer NTF detected by Coomassie Blue staining that was quantified by IR fluorescence.\nMass Spectrometry\nSynthetized NTF was incubated with chemical treatments in dH2O. Samples were diluted to 5pmol/uL in 20% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid and infused into Orbitrap Fusion Tribid mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 4uL/min. The precursor mass (MS1) scans were collected at a resolution of 120,000 for a full minute. The MS1 data was deconvoluted using the Xtract function of QualBrowser (ThermoScientific, ZXCalibur v3.0.63) to determine the monoisotopic intact mass of the NTF peptides."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll of the studies performed were approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee. Additionally, the Division of Laboratory Animal Resources at the University is accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation for Laboratory Animal Care, International (AAALAC, International) and all experiments were performed with its guidelines. All animal experiments are in compliance with ARRIVE guidelines and experiments are carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of Laboratory animals (NIH Publications No. 8023, revised 1978). All experiments were conducted using either male or female adult (3 to 5 months) wild-type C57BL/6 (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) or mitoNEET null mice with an average mass of 30 grams. mitoNEET null mice were gifted to the lab and the generation of the mouse model was previously described (\nWiley et al., 2007\n). In summary, the mitoNEET null mice were developed through disruption of the mitoNEET gene on the C57Bl/6 (albino) \u00d7 129 SvEv Brd (agouti) background acquired from the Lexicon Genetics Omnibank program which they developed using their proprietary gene trap technology (\nZambrowicz et al., 1998\n). Experiments using NL-1 also involved the usage of Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River; ~300 g; male) at 2mo of age.\nAnimals were randomly assigned to groups and all data analysis was performed blinded to treatment groups. The animals were housed 5 (mice) or 2 (rats) per cage and maintained in a 14-hr light/10hr dark cycle for mice and 12-hr light/12hr dark cycle for rats. All animals were fed a balanced diet ad libitum and water was reverse osmosis generated. For mitochondrial bioenergetics assessment, experiments were conducted with n=3\u20136 biological replicates and for each biological replicate there were technical replicates of n\u22653. For Pioglitazone cortical sparing assessment in WT versus mitoNEET null mice, n=6/group. For NL-1 functional assessments in WT versus mitoNEET null mice, n=13\u201316/group. For chronic NL-1 mouse study and NL-1 rat efficacy experiment, n=4\u20138/group. The exact number of animals per study are reported within the figure legends.\n\nControlled Cortical Impact Brain Injury\nAll surgical procedures were performed as previously described and were classified as moderate (0.75 mm depth of contusion) to severe (1.0 mm depth of contusion) in mice or severe (2.0 mm depth of contusion) in rats at 3.5 meters/second for 500ms (\nSullivan et al., 1999\n;\nSullivan et al., 2000\n;\nSullivan et al., 2011\n). Prior to injury, animals were anesthetized using 2% isoflurane, animals were weighed and their head was shaved to remove hair to avoid infection. Animals were then placed in a Kopf stereotaxic frame for proper positioning under a pneumatic impactor (Precision Science Instruments) and body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C with the use of an isothermal pad. A 3mm (mice) or 6mm (rats) craniotomy was performed lateral to the central fissure on the left side of the skull centered between lambda and bregma, with much care taken to not disrupt the dura. Animals with damage to the dura were excluded. Injury groups then received a unilateral injury directly to the surface of the brain using a 2mm (mice) or 5mm (rats) impactor rod tip. Sham animals received a craniotomy but did not receive an impact to the brain. Following the injury, the craniotomy was covered with a piece of hardened dental acrylic, made the night before, and secured with sterile surgical adhesive. Incisions were then closed with sutures. After the craniotomies were covered and the incisions were closed on all animals, isoflurane exposure was ended and the animals were removed from the stereotaxic frame. They were then placed in a clean cage that was temperature controlled at 37\u00b0C with a heating pad until the animals were mobile and fully responsive.\nTo investigate the neuroprotective effects of either Pioglitazone or NL-1 after TBI, animals received a CCI (as described above) and then given an IP injection of either Pioglitazone or NL-1 as described in figure legends. Both drugs were solubilized immediately before injections in vehicle (25 \u03bcl of 100% Ethanol, 1 \u03bcl 38% HCl, and 225\u03bcl of 0.9% saline for Pioglitazone and 100% DMSO for NL-1) to yield a concentration which would require 100 \u03bcl of compound injected at the desired dosage (\nSauerbeck et al., 2011a\n). WT animals that received continuous administration of NL-1 for 1 week received one injection of NL-1 at 15minutes after injury and then the osmotic pump was inserted at the nape of the neck to release 3ug/\u03bcl of NL1 at a rate of 1.0 \u03bcL an hour for 7 days. Osmotic pumps were removed at 7 days post-injury and animals were allowed to recover.\n\nMitochondrial isolation\nMitochondria were isolated using previously employed differential mitochondrial isolation methods (\nPandya et al., 2007\n;\nPandya et al., 2009\n;\nPandya et al., 2016\n). Animals were asphyxiated with CO\n2\nand rapidly decapitated. Following decapitation, the brain was rapidly removed and placed in a beaker of ice-cold mitochondrial isolation buffer (MIB) composed of 215 mM Mannitol, 75 mM Sucrose, 0.1% BSA, 1 mM EGTA, and 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.2. Cortical tissue samples were homogenized and then centrifuged at 1300 \u00d7 G for 3 min. The supernatant was placed in a fresh tube and the pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer to be spun again at 1300 \u00d7 G for 3 min. The supernatants from the first and second spins were collected in separate tubes and spun at 13,000 \u00d7 G for 10 min. The pellets from both tubes were combined, resuspended in 500 \u03bcl isolation buffer and placed in a nitrogen bomb at 1,200 psi for 10 min to release trapped mitochondria within synaptosomes. The pressure in the nitrogen bomb was rapidly released after 10 min.\nThe samples were placed as the top layer on a Ficoll separation column which consisted of a 10% Ficoll layer (bottom) and a 7.5% Ficoll layer (top). The Ficoll column with sample was centrifuged at 32,000 \u00d7 G for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. Following the Ficoll purification, the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer without EGTA and centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 G for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C in order to remove residual Ficoll from the purified mitochondrial sample. The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer without EGTA to yield a final concentration of approximately 10 mg/ml, and stored immediately on ice. Protein concentrations for each sample were determined with all the samples on the same plate using the BCA protein assay kit and measuring absorbance at 560 nm with a Biotek Synergy HT plate reader (Winooski, VT).\n\nMeasurement of mitochondrial bioenergetics\nMeasurements of mitochondrial bioenergetics in isolated mitochondrial were completed using a Seahorse XFe24 Flux Analyzer as published previously using slight modifications (\nHubbard et al., 2019\n;\nPandya et al., 2016\n;\nSauerbeck et al., 2011b\n). Stock mitochondrial substrates of 500 mM pyruvate, 250 mM malate, 30 mM ADP, 1 mg/ml oligomycin-A, 1 mM FCCP, 1 mM rotenone and 1 M succinate were prepared and the pH was adjusted to pH 7.2. The day before the planned experiment, a 24 well dual-analyte sensor cartridge was hydrated and kept in a non-CO\n2\nincubator at 37 \u00b0C. On the scheduled day of the experiment, the sensor cartridge ports A through D were loaded with the appropriate mitochondrial substrates or inhibitors (10 \u00d7 working concentration made from stocks) and injected into the assay plate according to protocol procedure to reach the final concentration of the compound (1 \u00d7) in each well. All mitochondrial working stocks were prepared in respiration buffer (RB) composed of 215 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 0.1% BSA, 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl, 2.5 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\nat pH 7.2 and stored at 4 \u00b0C. The amount of substrates/inhibitors loaded for each port is based upon the initial 500 \u03bcl RB volume in the mitochondrial plate as follows: Port A \u2013 50 \u03bcl (mixture of pyruvate, malate and ADP), Port B \u2013 55 \u03bcl (Oligomycin A), Port C \u2013 60 \u03bcl (FCCP), and Port D \u2013 65 \u03bcl (rotenone and succinate). Once the sensor cartridge was loaded with all of the experimental reagents it was placed into the Seahorse XFe24 Flux Analyzer for automated calibration.\nSeahorse Standard XFe24 flux assay plates were utilized for mitochondrial analysis. Mitochondria (5 \u03bcg) from every experimental group were analyzed together on a single plate. Mitochondrial samples were resuspended in 50 \u03bcl RB and added in experimental wells whereas background control wells contained 50 \u03bcl of RB without mitochondria. Once every well was loaded on XFe24 plate, it was then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 4 min at room temperature. Following the centrifugation of the plates, 450 \u03bcl (37 \u00b0C) of pre-warmed RB was gently added to each well for a final volume of 500 \u03bcl per well. Plates were then placed into the calibrated Seahorse XFe24 flux analyzer for mitochondrial bioenergetics analysis after the sensor cartridge calibration was concluded.\nAn optimized protocol was utilized for the analysis of bioenergetics in purified mitochondria using the Seahorse Biosciences XFe24 Flux Analyzer. The protocol contains sequential and/or cyclic steps of a cartridge probe calibration, mixing substrates in the assay system, a delay for some time, injections of substrates/inhibitors and then measurement of the oxygen consumption rates (OCR) as elaborated upon previously.(\nPandya et al., 2016\n;\nSauerbeck et al., 2011b\n) Mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates (OCR) were recorded in the absence or the presence of various mitochondrial substrates/inhibitors which were added from port A to port D. State III response in presence of 5 mM pyruvate, 2.5 mM malate and 1 mM ADP (Port A) was measured followed by State IV response in presence of 1 \u03bcM oligomycin A (Port B). Sequentially, State V\nFCCP\nand State V\nSucc\nOCR rates were recorded automatically in presence of 4 \u03bcM FCCP (Port C); 0.1 \u03bcM rotenone and 10 mM of succinate (Port D) respectively. The data files collected from each experiment were analyzed and reported here as percent OCR (% OCR). In this study, we reported on State V\n(FCCP)\nrates since as this parameter is indicative of impairment of maximal mitochondrial function and mitochondrial reserve capability following TBI.\n\nWestern Blot Analysis\nCortical tissue was isolated from both mitoNEET null and WT mice and homogenized in cold lysis buffer supplemented with 1X protease inhibitor. The homogenate was sonicated for 10 seconds at 10% amplitude and then centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 15minutes at 13,000g. The supernatant was removed and protein concentration was quantified using a BCA protein assay kit (23227, Peirce BCA Protein Assay, ThermoFisher Scientific). Ten micrograms of each sample was loaded into a 10% mini-PROTEAN precast gel running and ran at 165 V for 60minutes (Bio-Rad). The protein was transferred to a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane at 100 V for 1 h. The membrane was blocked for 1 hour with reconstituted 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.2% TBST (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20). The membrane was then blocked for 1hr with 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.2% TBST (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20). mitoNEET Protein-Tech Primary antibody (16006\u20131-AP) was diluted at 1:500 in TBST and the mixture was incubated on the membrane for 1hr at room temperature. The membrane was then washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody Anti-Rabbit IgG-HRP (#7074S Cell Signaling) diluted at 1:5000 followed by 3 washes of TBST. The blots were imaged using Chemidoc-XRS system (Bio-Rad).\n\nHistological Analysis\nAnimals were euthanized using FATAL-Plus (NAC No.: 10980012, Vortech Pharmaceuticals, Dearborn, Michigan 48126) and immediately perfused with saline followed by cold 4% paraformaldehyde, which was freshly prepared one-day prior. The brains were removed and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 30% sucrose solution in PBS for 24hrs. After 24hrs, the brains were transferred to a 30% sucrose PBS buffer solution without paraformaldehyde. 35uM coronal sections were cut with a freezing microtome throughout the rostral caudal extent of the damaged cortex. Sections were stained with cresyl violet and subjected to image analysis for lesion volume assessment. Quantitative assessment of cortical damage employed a blinded unbiased stereological protocol using the Cavalieri method as previously described (\nSullivan et al., 1999\n;\nSullivan et al., 2000\n). All slides were assessed blindly with respect to treatment group using ImageJ software (NIH, USA) for simple ROI analysis of 12 sections per animal to measure cortical sparing.\n\nAdjusted Neurological Severity Score\nInjured wild-type or mitoNEET null mice had functional motor recovery tested using the adjusted neurological severity score (aNSS). This 14-point test measures coordinated motor function and balance as a measurement of motor function/recovery following injury. This score is based upon functional ability measured during the beam walk test. One day prior to injury, all animals were trained to traverse elevated beams of 3, 2, 1, and 0.5 cm width and a 0.5 cm diameter rod. At 1 hour, 24 hours, 72 hours and 120 hours post-injury, mice were allowed to traverse the beams and scored as follows. The 4 largest beams had a maximum score of 3-points and the smallest, 0.5cm diameter, rod had a maximum score of 2-points. For the largest 4 beams, one point was deducted if the animal had one or more footfalls or became inverted during the test. For the 0.5cm rod, 1-point was deducted for inversion on the rod. For all beams/rods, if an animal was unwilling to traverse the beam or fell off during the test, the animal received a score of 0 for that beam.\n\nNovel Object Recognition\nInjured WT mice underwent cognition testing following injury using the novel object recognition (NOR) test. Prior to surgery, each animal tested received their own 10.5\u201d x 19\u201d x 8\u201d plastic box which was not cleaned to maintain a familiar environment for the length of the study. During this time, animals were allowed to acclimate to their box for 1hr. On testing day, 6 weeks post-injury, vehicle and drug treated mice were place back into their designated box that had two identical novel objects placed 1inch from two diagonal corners. The objects used for this study were plastic children toys (Fisher-Price\u00ae Little People\u00ae) approximately 3 \u00d7 2 inches. The animals were allowed to explore their box and the novel objects for 5 minutes. After the acclimation period, the mice were removed from their designated boxes and then tested 4 hours later. During the test period, mice were placed back into their boxes where one of the previous objects was replaced with novel object of equal size and shape. Objects were not shared between groups and were thoroughly cleaned with soap and water after usage. The amount of time that the animal spent investigating each object was recorded by an evaluator who was blinded to the injury and treatment of each mouse. The discrimination index was then calculated by subtracting the time the animal spent investigating the familiar object from the time that the animal spent investigating the novel object. This value was then divided by the total time of investigation, calculated by adding the time the animal spent investigating the familiar object and the novel object.\n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging was conducted using an approach similar to our previously published work (\nPatel et al., 2017\n). In summary, a 7T Bruker/Siemens Clinscan MRI scanner was used to image rat brains at 14 days post-injury following either vehicle or NL-1 treatment. During the imaging, animals were placed under continuous isoflurane anesthesia which was introduced through a nose cone and the animals head was placed under a 4-channel rat brain coil. After inserting the animal and coil into the MRI scanner, localizers in the three orthogonal planes were used to focus and homogenize the magnetic field around the injured brain tissue. Following localization, T2-weighted images were acquired in the coronal plane yielding 12 subsequent slices centered around the injury site with a field-of-view (FOV) of 40 mm \u00d7 40 mm x 0.7 mm with a pixel resolution of 384 \u00d7 512. The imaging parameters were: Excitation Time (TE) = 42 ms, Relaxation Time (TR)= 2070 ms, with the phase encoding direction set to Anterior-Posterior and a total acquisition time of 11.25 minutes. MRI images were generated using Syngo Medical Imaging software (Siemens AG, Germany). Quantification of these images were conducted in a similar manner to those reported previously (\nPatel et al., 2016\n). In summary, all images were post-processed using FSL FMRIB Software Library v5.0 (Analysis Group; FMRIB, Oxford, UK). (\nJenkinson et al., 2012\n) For each of the 12 coronal sections, the mean and standard deviation of the T2 parameter throughout the imaged brain (including the injury) was calculated. A threshold was then applied where any voxel greater than 3 standard deviations (SD) above the total mean signal was considered T2 hyper-intense \u201cinjured tissue\u201d. The T2-weighted cortical sparing was then calculated by the total volume of tissue on the injured hemisphere minus the T2 hyper-intense voxels on the injured hemisphere divided by the total volume of tissue on the contralateral hemisphere minus T2 hyper-intense voxels.\n\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, CA, USA). Animal numbers were powered according to published experimental data and anticipated effect sizes; experiments were not powered to detect for sex differences where applicable. For all analyses, the significance of differences among groups was set at p < 0.05. For each measure, data were measured using interval/ratio scales. The Brown-Forsythe and Bartlett\u2019s tests were performed to ensure homogeneity of variance. Furthermore, the Shapiro-Wilk test was completed to ensure normality. As these criteria were met for all experimental data, parametric statistics were employed for all data analyses. The statistical test employed for each study can be found within the figure legend however in summary, the following applied. For mitochondrial assessments, data sets were evaluated using either a t-test or a one-way analysis of variance and, when appropriate, post-hoc comparisons employing the Dunnett and Bonferoni test. Two-way ANOVA were run to analyze differences in cortical sparing and aNSS between mitoNEET null mice and wild-type mice with Pioglitazone or NL-1 treatment. For Novel Object Recognition and MRI-weight cortical sparing studies with continuous NL-1 treatment for 7 days in WT mice, a t-test was performed to measure differences between groups."

    "Methods": "Animal use\nAll experiments were conducted in accordance with the University of Louisville Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, adhering to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Adult 6\u20138 week old (male and female) hemizygous\nThy1\nYFP+\ntransgenic mice (\nFeng et al., 2000\n) were bred in-house to visualize dorsal column axons\nin vivo\nand to identify axons for immunofluorescent staining in fixed, frozen spinal cord sections.\n\nSurgical procedures and implantable spinal cord chamber\nMice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3\u20135% for induction and 1.5% for maintenance; Vetland Medical Sales & Services LLC; Louisville, KY), received saline, and buprenorphine to manage pain. Body temperature was maintained at 37 \u00b0C throughout the surgeries, which typically lasted 30\u201345 minutes. Artificial tear ointment (Akorn Inc.) was used to protect the eyes during surgery. To facilitate\nin vivo\nimaging of the spinal cord, some (n=7) mice were implanted with a custom spinal cord imaging chamber generated using SolidWorks software; design modified from (\nFarrar et al., 2012\n). The chamber sidebars and top plate that secured and enclosed the spinal cord, respectively, were 3D-printed in high resolution by direct metal laser sintering of titanium (Ti-6Al-4V ELI, Proto Labs, Inc., Maple Plain, MN). The top plate posts and sidebar posts of the surgical and imaging platform were 3D-printed in normal resolution via direct metal laser sintering of aluminum (AlSi10Mg, Proto Labs, Inc., Maple Plain, MN). Alternatively, we used a custom mouse spinal column clamp only (n=12) as previously described for intravital imaging (\nStirling et al., 2009\n) to firmly support the exposed vertebral column. A laminectomy was then performed at T12, and the exposed spinal cord was covered either with an inert silicone elastomer as an interface between the cord and the glass coverslip sealed on the top plate, or with an inert gel to facilitate live imaging and to prevent drying of the exposed spinal cord. The implantable chamber allowed for chronic time-lapse intravital imaging of the spinal cord in the same animal without complications of repeated surgery (\nFarrar et al., 2012\n). Once baseline images were collected the mouse was positioned under the Infinite Horizon Impactor Device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Lexington, KY). The contusion was at T12 to allow for better stabilization of the vertebral column and to limit breathing artifacts during imaging. Following a mild (30 kilodyne) contusion, mice were positioned under the microscope to collect 4D two-photon excitation recordings at 20\u201330 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr, 4 hr and 1 day, 3 day, 7 day and 14 day post-SCI. Following surgery, mice were given lactated ringer\u2019s solution (2cc, s.c.) to replenish electrolytes and fluids, and gentamycin (Gentafuse; 0.1 ml, s.c., every day for 3 days) to prevent infection. Not all animals were imaged for every timepoint due to animal care restrictions that require a minimal amount of time to recover between serial imaging sessions and potential complications due to scar formation across the laminectomy site that restricts imaging quality.\n\nMicroscopy\nIn order to visualize the dynamic response of dorsal column axons following a mild contusion SCI\nin vivo\n, time-lapse two-photon excitation images of fluorescently labeled spinal cord axons were obtained using a commercial A1\nR\nMP\n+\nmultiphoton confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY) and Elements software (Nikon Instruments Inc.). The microscope is equipped with a Chameleon Vision II Ti: sapphire ultrafast pulsed laser and a 25\u00d7 1.1 NA water immersion lens to allow for high resolution images at submicron resolution. The laser was tuned to 950 nm (~17 mW measured at the exit of the objective) to excite YFP and clearly image dynamic changes in axons\nin vivo\n.\n\nImage analysis\nSoftware.\nFor image analysis, the freeware ImageJ v1.33 from the NIH website (\nhttp://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij\n) was used.\nAxonal Sparing.\nThe dorsal columns of mice were imaged using two-photon excitation microscopy to yield 3D images. Time-lapse large images (950 \u03bcm wide by 1385 \u03bcm long, centered at the contusion site) of the spinal cord dorsal columns were collected in z-stacks (3 \u03bcm/step size) at baseline, 20\u201330 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr, 4 hr and 1 day, 3 day, 7 day and 14 day after SCI. Data were then imported into ImageJ for visualization and analysis. A region with good visibility was chosen and a perpendicular line (ImageJ) was drawn from the dorsal vein to the beginning of the dorsal roots (~250 \u03bcm) at the epicenter of the contusion site or a similar location in all mice at all timepoints. Intact axons without spheroids or endbulbs that touched this line were manually counted and divided by the length of the line and compared to the same animal\u2019s pre-injury baseline. Axon sparing was calculated as a percentage to allow comparison between animals. Axons were examined to the extent possible throughout the image to ensure that no end bulbs are present for a single axon. When an end bulb was found, the axon was not counted as surviving. Moreover, double counting was avoided by placing a point marker on the axon in an optical slice with a good view of the full width and scrolling up and down in the z-stack before placing markers. Six to nine animals per time point were assessed and data reported as percent axonal sparing (median \u00b1 25th percentile).\nAxonal terminal bulb (endbulb) and axonal spheroid quantification.\nIn the same 3D data sets as above, the mean axonal diameter was measured from ten random axons selected from each baseline image per animal and averaged to provide a reference for defining axonal spheroids and endbulbs for quantification. Axonal spheroids were defined and scored as axonal swellings three times the width or larger than the diameter of the reference axonal width. Similarly, any severed axonal ending three times or larger than the width of the reference axonal width was scored as an endbulb. Double counting was avoided by placing a point marker on the axonal spheroid or endbulb in an optical slice with a good view of the full width and scrolling up and down in the z-stack before placing markers using a distance tool in ImageJ. This point marker crosses the maximum diameter of its corresponding spheroid or endbulb to measure its size. Total spheroids and retraction bulbs at any timepoint were normalized to visible area to allow comparison between animals. The visible area was calculated by manual segmentation using the ImageJ selection tool and measuring area. The visible area included the area where the full thickness of the dorsal columns was visible and excluded the midline posterior vein and areas devoid of axons. The lateral distribution (distance to midline) of spheroids was calculated using a manually placed two-point line from the center of the spheroid to the center of the dorsal vein (midline) for each data set. A minimum of 6 animals per timepoint was assessed and the data were presented as median \u00b1 25th percentile for axonal spheroids, and endbulbs. The lateral distribution of spheroids was presented as the percentage of axonal spheroids as a function of distance from the midline over time (cumulative distribution).\nAxonal spheroid formation and resolution.\nTo determine the individual fate of axonal spheroids over time, we tracked the same spheroids for a minimum of 3 hours or longer (where possible) and measured changes in their size over time. A total of 71 axonal spheroids from an n=6 mice were followed. Based on our observations the fate of axonal spheroids fell into 6 categories. We found that axonal spheroids either increased in size, increased in size and then remained static, increased in size and then resolved, decreased in size then increased, resolved, or remained static. Axonal mitochondria and tubulin polyglutamylation. To determine changes in axonal mitochondria, image recordings of stained sections were collected in z-stacks (2.08x zoom, 3\u00d71 stitch, 1.5 \u03bcm/step size). To determine changes in axonal tubulin polyglutamylation, image recordings of stained sections were collected in z-stacks (2.08x zoom, 1.5 \u03bcm/step size). Data were then imported into ImageJ for visualization and analysis. A 3 \u00d7 3 box was made and was placed randomly on spheroids and endbulbs, as well as within axons for each section assessed (minimum of 3 sections from 3 animals per group (Na\u00efve, 4 h, 24 h adfter SCI). A threshold was created to match the signal of the Alexa 647 channel within YFP+ axons. The percent area was then measured inside the 3\u00d73 box based on the threshold. A spheroid and endbulb was classified as being three times the width of the parent axon and the latter having one axonal segment attached.\n\nImmunofluorescence staining for mitochondria and tubulin polyglutamylation\nNa\u00efve (control) animals, and 4h, or 1d after SCI animals (n=3/ group) were anesthetized with a lethal dose of ketamine\u2013xylazine and perfused with ice-cold PBS, followed by perfusion fixation with a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The spinal cords (brainstem to lumbar region) were removed and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and subsequently cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. The spinal cords were cut into blocks, frozen, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until sectioned. Specifically, a 2 cm lesion block, centered at the lesion site, was cryo-sectioned at a thickness of 20 \u03bcm, and tissue sections were collected on Superfrost slides (Fisher Scientific) organized into adjacent section series. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry was performed on slides containing sections of naive, 4 h, and 1 d post-injured spinal cords. Slides were rinsed in PBS for 5 min and then underwent a delipidation process. The slides were placed in 50%, 70%, 90%, 95%, 100% ethanol for 1 min each in ascending then descending order. Slides were rinsed in TBS for 5 min for a total of three washes and then blocked in either 10% normal goat serum or 10% normal donkey serum in TBS for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were washed with TBS for 10 min for a total of three washes before adding the primary antibody overnight. To detect changes in axonal mitochondria and tubulin polyglutamylation respectively, the following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-TOMM20 (1:50, MA5\u201332148, Invitrogen) and monoclonal anti-tubulin, polyglutamylated antibody (1:100, T9822, Millipore Sigma). Slides were then washed in TBS, TBS + Triton, TBS for 10 min each and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody: Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) to visualize the primary antibodies listed above for 1h at room temperature. After three washes in TBS, TBS + Triton, TBS slides were left to dry before placing the coverslip on. Images were captured using a commercial A1RMP+ multiphoton confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY) and Elements software (Nikon Instruments Inc.).\n\nExperimental design and statistical analysis\nData for axonal survival, axonal spheroid and endbulb counts were expressed as median, 5th, 25th, 75th and 95th percentiles and displayed as box and whisker plots. Data for axonal spheroid distance to midline was displayed as a cumulative distribution and each timepoint was compared using a nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution Test. Sample size for the animal studies was determined using power analysis based on our pilot studies. Significant differences among the timepoints for the number of spheroids and endbulbs as well as the axonal survival were compared using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U Test. Data for immunofluorescence quantification were compared using an ANOVA and Holm-Sidak method. Probability values\np\n< 0.05 were considered significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll handling, housing, stimulation, and surgical procedures were approved by The University of Texas at Dallas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Twenty-three Sprague Dawley female rats (Charles River, 3 to 6 months old, 250 to 500g) were housed in a 12:12 h reverse light-dark cycle. Fifteen rats were tested with non-invasive stimulation using tcVNS at various parameters. Of these 15, 8 were also tested with taVNS. Eight rats were implanted with a cuff electrode and tested with iVNS after a week of recovery.\n\nImplanted Cervical VNS\nCuff implantation was performed as previously described [\n27\n]. Eight rats were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (80 mg/kg, IP) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, IP) and placed in a stereotactic apparatus. An incision was made down the midline of the head to expose the skull. Bone screws were inserted into the skull at points surrounding the lamboid suture and over the cerebellum. A two-channel connector was mounted to the screws using acrylic. An incision was made on the left side of the neck and the overlying musculature was blunt dissected to reveal the vagus nerve. The nerve was gently dissected away from the carotid artery. A cuff electrode, described in detail previously, was implanted surrounding the vagus nerve with two leads tunneled subcutaneously and connected to the two-channel connector on the skull [\n9\n]. Nerve activation was confirmed peri-surgically by observation of a \u2265 5% drop in blood oxygen saturation (SpO\n2\n) in response to a 5 s stimulation train of VNS consisting of 0.8 mA, 0.1 ms biphasic pulses at 30 pulses per second (PPS). Once cuff efficacy was confirmed, head and neck incisions were sutured closed and treated with antibiotic ointment. Rats received subcutaneous injections of 5 mL 50:50 0.9% saline 5% dextrose solution. A five day recovery period followed surgery and rats were given one Baytril tablet per day (2 mg/tablet, BioServ, Frenchtown, NJ).\nStimulation testing commenced approximately one week after surgical implantation. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane mixed with pressurized room air (0.5 L/min, 1\u20133% isoflurane), placed in the supine position, and connected via the two-channel connector to an isolated programmable stimulator (Model 4100; A-M Systems\u2122; Sequim, WA). Comparison of animals from previous experiments tested under isoflurane, ketamine/xylazine, and pentobarbital indicates that HB reflex measurement is not dependent on the anesthetic type (\nFig. S4\n). Rats were stimulated with 5 second trains of biphasic current-controlled square waves (0.1 ms per phase) at 30 PPS across intensities ranging from 0.1 mA to 2.5 mA. All stimulation and recording were controlled with custom MATLAB software. SpO\n2\nand heart rate were recorded using a pulse oximeter (Starr Life Sciences\u2122, MouseOx Plus\u00ae) as previously described [\n23\n]. Data were read into MATLAB using a Starr Link Plus\u2122 with the outputs connected to analog channels on an Arduino Mega 2560. To measure muscle activation, a force-transducer (2kg EBB Load Cell; Transducer Techniques; Temecula, CA) was placed on the surface of the neck directly over the implant and connected to another analog channel on the Arduino. Stimulation trains were delivered every 60 seconds, but subsequent stimulation trains were delayed if needed to allow SpO\n2\nto recover. To avoid any effects of HB reflex sensitization or habituation, stimulation parameters were randomly interleaved and repeated twice in each preparation [\n28\n]. Data were sampled at 100 Hz.\n\nTranscutaneous Cervical VNS\nFifteen rats were anesthetized with isoflurane mixed with pressurized room air (0.5 L/min, 1\u20133% isoflurane) and placed in the supine position with their upper limbs secured to the table. An experimental non-invasive stimulator developed to deliver tcVNS in rats (gammaCore; electroCore, LLC; Basking Ridge, NJ) was placed on the skin centered over the left or right cervical vagus nerve (parallel to the sagittal plane, 3 to 6 mm lateral from midline, 8 to12 mm rostral of the manubrium). As an active control, in some experiments the stimulator was placed on the medial surface of the left hind limb. The stimulator consisted of two surface disc electrodes (5 mm diameter, 10 mm separation center to center). Leads from the electrodes were connected to the A-M Systems stimulator. Square waves were generated using the built in stimulation waveform library. Sine waves were generated using a digital processor with a digital-to-analog converter (RP2; Tucker-Davis Technologies; Alachua, FL) and amplified to the desired current or voltage by the A-M systems stimulator. Prior to stimulation, the hair on the neck and left hind limb was removed with a chemical depilatory, and conducting gel (Signa gel; Parker Laboratories; Fairfield, NJ) was applied to the electrodes to ensure good contact with the skin.\nElectrical stimulation consisted of 5 second trains at 10 to 480 PPS, where each pulse was a 1 ms sine wave at 1, 5, or 25 kHz with amplitude ranging from 0.5 to 48 mA or 1 to 64 V. Both current-controlled and voltage-controlled stimulation configurations were tested. To compare 5 kHz sine waves to the more commonly used square waves, a subset of four animals were also stimulated with biphasic current controlled square waves (5 second trains, 30 PPS, 0.5 to 48 mA, 0.5 ms per phase). SpO\n2\nand heart rate were measured as described above. Muscle activation was measured via the force transducer attached to the tcVNS device directly over the electrodes. Stimulation trains were delivered every 60 seconds, but subsequent stimulation trains were delayed if needed to allow SpO\n2\nto recover. Stimulation parameters were randomly interleaved and repeated twice in each preparation. Data were sampled at 100 Hz.\n\nTranscutaneous Auricular VNS\nEight rats were anesthetized with isoflurane mixed with pressurized room air (0.5 L/min, 1\u20133% isoflurane) and placed in the prone position. Acupuncture needles (0.14 mm diameter; J-Type No. 01; Seirin America; Weymouth, MA) were placed on the auricular concha and connected to the A-M Systems stimulator, similar to previous studies [\n29\n], [\n30\n]. Electrical stimulation consisted of 5 second trains at 30 to 120 PPS, where each pulse was a current controlled biphasic square wave with current ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 mA and pulse-width ranging from 0.1\u20130.5 ms. SpO\n2\nand heart rate were measured as described above. The threshold at which ear twitching could be observed was visually noted and recorded in each experiment. Stimulation was delivered every 60 seconds, but subsequent stimulation trains were delayed if needed to allow SpO\n2\nto recover. Stimulation parameters were randomly interleaved and repeated twice. Data were sampled at 100 Hz.\n\nAnalysis and Statistical Comparisons\nThe magnitude of the HB reflex and heart rate response to each stimulation was measured as the maximum change from baseline in a 20 second window starting at the onset of stimulation. The baseline was defined as the average of the 20 seconds of data prior to the onset of each train of stimulation. The magnitude of the muscle response was measured as the maximum change from baseline in a 5 second window starting at the onset of stimulation. Baseline was defined as the average of the 5 seconds of force data prior to the onset. The window lengths were selected to effectively capture the peak response for each measure. The threshold for each measure in each animal was defined as the lowest current amplitude that resulted in a change in signal greater than 5x the standard deviation of the baseline for all stimulations at that intensity. The measured response for each stimulation and threshold for each experiment were calculated automatically by analysis software. Manual quality control was performed by three experimenters blinded during analysis to identify and rectify any trials with errors, such as a momentary loss of pulse oximeter signal.\nData reported in the text and figures represent mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). For dose-response curves, a one-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed to determine if there was an effect of stimulation. Individual comparisons for each stimulation intensity were made using a post hoc Dunnett\u2019s test compared to zero. When comparing dose-response curves for left and right tcVNS, a two-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed. Muscle and HB reflex thresholds were compared using a paired t-test. Thresholds for the various stimulation rates and sine wave frequencies were compared using a one-way ANOVA with individual comparisons made using post hoc Tukey\u2019s tests. Thresholds for square waves and sine waves were compared using a two-sample t-test. The statistical test used for each comparison is noted in the text. All calculations were performed in MATLAB."

    "Methods": "Here we review methods for activating the spinal respiratory circuitry. In this context \u201cactivation\u201d of spinal circuits refers to utilizing both exogenous (e.g. electrical, chemical, or photostimulation) or endogenous (e.g. via coupling to locomotor circuits during exercise) methods to engage and depolarize spinal neurons which may impact breathing.\n\n3.1. Chemo/Pharmacogenetic\nChemo- or pharmacogenetic activation involves using small molecules, which are not natively recognized by the host. These small molecules are specifically designed to interact with exogenous engineered proteins. One class of chemogenetics are designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) (\nRoth, 2016\n). DREADDs allow for targeted activation of neuronal subpopulations (\nAldrin-Kirk and Bj\u00f6rklund, 2019\n) through transgenic breeding or viral delivery. Two common receptors, the Gq- and Gi-DREADDs respond to a non-native ligands such as: clozapine-n-oxide (CNO) or Compound 21 (\nChen et al., 2015\n). Gq-DREADD, such as hM3Dq, are muscarinic receptors which increase the excitability of cells expressing them (\nArmbruster et al., 2007\n) The Gi-DREADD (hM4Di) results in reduced neuronal excitability. The \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was modified to form another set of engineered channels and ligands known as pharmacologically selective actuator modules (PSAMs) which are activated via pharmacologically selective effectors molecules (PSEMs). PSAMs can then be combined with glycinergic (GlyR) or GABAergic (GABA C) channels to reduce cell membrane resistance and inhibit firing (\nAtasoy and Sternson, 2018\n;\nMagnus et al., 2011\n). Recent work has suggested that these ligands are not entirely inert (\nGoutaudier et al., 2019\n). Indeed, several studies have expressed concerns that CNO can be back metabolized into clozapine, which is biologically active. Of particular concern to respiration, repeated exposure to back metabolized clozapine can blunt CO\n2\nchemosensitivity (\nMartinez et al., 2019\n). While the spinal cord is not the primary site of CO\n2\nsensing this stresses the importance of DREADD null controls when using CNO or other ligands. Further, chemogenetic approaches are temporally constrained as the cells expressing the novel receptor are tonically excited or inhibited following ligand administration.\nA growing number of studies have used chemogenetic methods to manipulate brainstem respiratory circuits, but relatively few have applied this technology towards the study of spinal respiratory interneurons. Satkunendrarajah et al. recently used chemogenetics to manipulate excitatory glutamatergic spinal interneurons following SCI. They injected an adeno-associated virus (AAVDJ) into the murine cervical spinal cord near the phrenic motor pool to produce cre-dependent expression of PSAM\nL141F\n-GlyR in excitatory interneurons. Activation with PSEM\n308\ncaused a reduction of inspiratory flow indicating that these spinal interneurons were required to sustain ventilation (\nSatkunendrarajah et al., 2018\n). This study also showed that transfection of glutamatergic interneurons in the mid-cervical spinal cord (near the phrenic motor pool) with AAV5-DIO-hM3Dq (i.e., cre-dependent excitatory DREADD), and subsequent activation via CNO causes a substantial\nincrease\nin diaphragm EMG activity following acute SCI (\nSatkunendrarajah et al., 2018\n). A study from Crone\u2019s laboratory used chemogenetic methods to activate V2a interneurons in the mouse (\nRomer et al., 2017\n). V2a cells are glutamatergic and are found in the spinal cord and also the brainstem. In the spinal cord, V2a interneurons are synaptically coupled to phrenic motoneurons (\nZholudeva et al., 2017\n). Using a V2a-CHRM3 (Gq excitatory DREADD) mouse, intraperitoneal delivery of the DREADD ligand increased accessory respiratory muscle activity and breathing. These results confirm a role of V2a interneurons in activating the respiratory muscles, but do not shed light on the location of these neurons (i.e., brainstem vs. spinal cord). A subsequent study by Jensen et al. used an inhibitory DREADD to acutely silence brainstem and spinal V2a interneurons in the mouse. The data showed that inhibiting V2a cells caused activation of accessory respiratory muscles, but had minimal impact on the diaphragm (\nJensen et al., 2019\n). Thus, V2a cells may be part of a brainstem and/or spinal cord circuitry which constrains accessory respiratory output during periods of quiet breathing.\nChemogenetic methods are a powerful tool for studying neural networks, and recent publications illustrate that these methods can help to unravel the complexities of the spinal respiratory circuit (\nJensen et al., 2019\n;\nRomer et al., 2017\n;\nSatkunendrarajah et al., 2018\n). In a relatively short period of time, chemogenetic technology has considerably advanced the understanding of how spinal interneurons can regulate spinal respiratory motor output. As the field moves forward, the use of molecular and genetic tools will enable improved targeting of specific neural populations during chemogenetic stimulation.\n\n3.2. Optogenetic\nOptogenetics can selectively target specific cells types, and compared to chemogenetics provides the advantage of high temporal and spatial sensitivity. Since the initial description of activating neurons with light (\nBoyden et al., 2005\n) several light sensitive channels have been developed to excite or inhibit neurons at various wavelengths. Transgenic breeding and viral manipulations can be used to insert these channels/pumps into selected cell populations. Transgenic animals tend to have more robust expression, but viral transduction is not as species restrictive. One of the first applications of optogenetics in the spinal cord focused on restoring breathing after SCI (\nAlilain et al., 2008\n). In that study, a Sinbus virus was utilized to express channelrhodopsin-2 (Chr2) in the mid-cervical spinal cord of adult rats. Rats received a cervical SCI at the time of viral injection, and several days later, diaphragm EMG activity, recorded ipsilateral to the spinal lesion, could be increased by directing the appropriate wavelength light at the spinal cord. (\nAlilain et al., 2008\n). Subsequently, Cregg et al. used optogenetic methods to define a spinal circuit that is capable of rhythmically activating phrenic motoneurons in the absence of brainstem inputs (\nCregg et al., 2017\n). Short (200 ms) pulses of light were used to activate Vglut2+ neurons in the cervical cord, and this was sufficient to generate prolonged (4 s) bursts in the phrenic nerve. However, in the same study, optical activation of the spinal cord in a mouse strain expressing channel rhodopsin in motoneurons (ChAT\nCre\n; R26R\nChR2\n) did not produce prolonged bursts. Taken together, this suggests there are spinal glutamatergic neurons capable of generating rhythmic like activity allowing the burst to continue beyond the light duration (\nCregg et al., 2017\n). These studies have shown that optogenetics are a powerful tool for understanding the function of spinal respiratory interneurons, and moreover may be an approach to restore breathing after injuries to the spinal cord.\n\n3.3. Spinal cord electrical stimulation\nThere is mounting evidence that epidural stimulation (\nWagner et al., 2018\n) or intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) (\nKasten et al., 2013\n;\nMcPherson et al., 2015\n) can restore at least partial function in animal models and humans with SCI. For epidural stimulation, electrodes are typically placed directly over the spinal dura; modeling studies indicate that passing electrical currents into the spinal cord with this approach activate sensory afferents and/or ventral spinal roots (\nCapogrosso et al., 2013\n). In contrast, ISMS involves placing wires directly into the spinal cord, near the motor neurons. Due to neuronal biophysical properties, ISMS is more likely to activate presynaptic inputs rather than directly depolarizing spinal motoneurons (\nNowak and Bullier, 1998a\n,\n1998b\n). ISMS can also antidromically activate afferents to depolarize spinal motoneurons (\nGaunt et al., 2006\n), and activate multiple motor pools synergistically from one stimulation site (\nMoritz et al., 2007\n;\nMushahwar et al., 2002\n). In regards to the focus of this paper, both epidural and intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) can activate respiratory muscles after SCI, and both methods appear to activate spinal interneurons as summarized next.\nThe ground breaking work of DiMarco and Kowalski has defined epidural spinal stimulation in the context of respiratory recovery (\nDiMarco and Kowalski, 2009\n;\nDiMarco and Kowalski, 2013a\n;\nDimarco and Kowalski, 2013b\n;\nKowalski et al., 2013\n). Early work developed a ventral spinal epidural stimulation approach in dogs, and this approach activated all of the primary inspiratory muscles with very few implanted electrodes (\nDiMarco et al., 1987\n). These findings led to a clinical intervention combining phrenic nerve and thoracic spinal stimulation (\nDiMarco et al., 2005\n). In 2009, this group published a remarkable study that advanced the epidural stimulation approach while also providing new insights regarding spinal respiratory interneurons (\nDiMarco and Kowalski, 2009\n). When high frequency (300 pulses per second, pps) stimulation was delivered to the ventral spinal cord of dogs with high cervical spinal transection, it caused recruitment of intercostal and phrenic motoneurons. However, the motoneuron discharge patterns were consistent with \u201cnormal\u201d discharge rates (e.g., ~15 Hz). One interpretation of this result is that local spinal circuits were engaged by the high frequency stimulation, and these propriospinal circuits caused \u201cphysiologic\u201d recruitment of respiratory motoneurons. Subsequent studies confirmed this fundamental observation (\nDiMarco and Kowalski, 2013a\n;\nDimarco and Kowalski, 2013b\n;\nKowalski et al., 2017\n), and also showed that the same approach works in a rat model (\nKowalski et al., 2013\n). Lesioning studies indicate that the upper cervical respiratory interneurons (see\nSection 2.2\n) are not involved in recruitment of phrenic motoneurons during high frequency epidural stimulation of the thoracic spinal cord, but that an intact lateral funiculus is required for the response (\nDiMarco and Kowalski, 2013a\n;\nDimarco and Kowalski, 2013b\n).\nISMS has also been used to activate spinal respiratory motor output. In a rat model of high cervical SCI (lateral hemisection at C2), the phasic inspiratory signal recorded in the tongue was used as a \u201ctrigger\u201d to activate ISMS at C4 (100 pps). This closed loop stimulation effectively activated phrenic motoneurons (indicated by diaphragm EMG recordings) and evoked tracheal pressure fluctuations consistent with inspiratory efforts (\nMercier et al., 2017\n). We also mapped the locations from C2\u2013T1 which ISMS could elicit either independent or simultaneous muscle potentials in the diaphragm, external intercostal, and sternocleidomastoid (\nSunshine et al., 2018\n). Co-activation of inspiratory muscles is more common during inspiration triggered stimulation, suggesting if the timing is appropriate an ISMS based intervention may activate interneuron networks which link these motor pools. The latency of the ISMS-evoked potentials recorded in the respiratory muscles suggested that polysynaptic spinal pathways to respiratory motoneurons were being activated (\nSunshine et al., 2018\n).\nEpidural stimulation is already a clinically viable approach to improve respiratory function in individuals with respiratory motor impairment (\nDiMarco et al., 2009a\n;\nDiMarco et al., 2009b\n;\nDiMarco et al., 2014\n), and while not demonstrated in the respiratory circuit in humans ISMS may also be effective in this regard. Strengths of spinal stimulation approaches include the ability to activate respiratory motor pools spanning multiple segments (\nDiMarco and Kowalski, 2009\n), evoking \u201cnatural\u201d motoneuron recruitment patterns.\n\n3.4. Hypoxia\nReductions in arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO\n2\n) from typical resting values of 90\u2013100 mmHg triggers a robust activation of carotid chemoafferent neurons which in turn evokes an increase in breathing. Interest in hypoxia has spiked in recent years due to an emerging appreciation that there may be therapeutic value in using carefully controlled mild hypoxia to stimulate neuronal networks after neurologic injury (\nGonzalez-Rothi et al., 2015\n). In regards to this review, the salient point is that hypoxia is a powerful activator of cervical interneurons, and appears to trigger plasticity within cervical networks. Sandhu et al. reported that the majority of mid-cervical spinal interneurons recorded in multi-electrode array experiments changed their discharge pattern during acute exposure to a single bout of hypoxia (inspired O\n2\n~ 15%). The data suggested that interneurons responded to hypoxia in a complex but seemingly orchestrated manner, and alterations in neuronal discharge patterns often persisted after the hypoxic stimulus was removed (\nSandhu et al., 2015\n). Subsequently, Streeter et al. reported that inspiratory- and expiratory-modulated cervical interneurons often switched to a tonic firing pattern during exposure to hypoxia. Upon removal of the hypoxic stimulus, cells that displayed inspiratory-related bursting at baseline tended to resume that pattern, but expiratory interneurons maintained the tonic bursting. Interestingly, after repeated exposures to hypoxia (i.e., acute intermittent hypoxia, AIH), cervical interneurons which were activated by hypoxia tended to return to baseline (pre-AIH) firing rates after AIH, whereas inhibited interneurons had persistent decreases in firing rates after AIH (\nStreeter et al., 2017a\n). Recent work demonstrated that hypoxia alters the behavior of mid-cervical interneurons in rats with chronic C2Hx (\nStreeter et al., 2019\n). At baseline contra- to ipsilesional relationships accounted for ~13% of excitatory connections (assessed via cross correlation), while only ~9% projected ipsi- to contralesional. Following a brief (5 min) hypoxic (inspired O\n2\n11%) period this contraipsilesional trend was eliminated and both populations accounted for ~13% of excitatory connections (\nStreeter et al., 2019\n).\nThus, hypoxia is a powerful experimental tool for activating (or inhibiting) cervical interneurons, and may have therapeutic value in the context of neurorehabilitation (\nGonzalez-Rothi et al., 2015\n). Mechanistically, it is not known how hypoxia impacts spinal interneuron discharge rates and/or connectivity. These cells may receive synaptic input from brainstem respiratory or sympathetic nuclei.\n\n3.5. Pharmacological agents\nLu et al. observed that thoracic interneurons (T3) responded to application of glutamate at C1\u2013C2. The majority (82%) of the thoracic interneurons responded to glutamate, 55% reduced their firing rate, while 38% increased their firing rate in response to glutamate application (\nLu et al., 2004\n). Phrenic nerve output was largely unaffected by glutamate administration, suggesting there is separate propriospinal network modulating thoracic interneuron firing. To our knowledge, the study by Lu et al. is the only report in which the direct response of respiratory spinal interneurons (e.g., changing in firing rates, biophysical properties) has been evaluated following pharmacologic manipulations. As such, that is an area in need of investigation using extracellular multielectrode arrays (\nStreeter et al., 2017b\n) or intracellular recording techniques.\nSeveral studies have induced rhythmic discharge in spinal respiratory nerves (e.g. phrenic, intercostal) following spinal drug application in animal models of high cervical transection. In these experiments, it can be inferred that the rhythmic discharges result, at least in part, from the action of the drugs on spinal interneurons that transmit rhythmic signals to respiratory motoneurons. For example, blocking inhibitory synaptic transmission in the cervical spinal cord can induce rhythmic phrenic/diaphragm discharge after spinal injury. Zimmer used an adult rat C2 hemilesion model, and found that blocking GABA-A, but not glycine receptors in the mid-cervical spinal cord could induce \u201ccross phrenic activity\u201d (\nZimmer and Goshgarian, 2007\n). Ghali and Marchenko subsequently showed that combined application of GABA-A and glycine antagonists applied to the C1\u2013C2 spinal cord could induce rhythmic phrenic bursting in rats that had a high cervical spinal transection (\nGhali and Marchenko, 2016\n). Interestingly, pharmacologic stimulation of the same region of the spinal cord (C1\u2013C2) with glutamate can increase intercostal and phrenic nerve activity (\nLu et al., 2004\n), a finding that indicates synaptic connectivity between C1\u2013C2 neurons and spinal respiratory motoneurons. Finally Cregg et al. have recently confirmed the earlier reports by showing that pharmacologic blockade of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord using picrotoxin and strychnine to block inhibitory neurotransmission produced rhythmic bursting in the rat and mouse phrenic nerve following complete transection of the C1 spinal cord (\nCregg et al., 2017\n).\nIn addition to the aforementioned spinal drug application studies, a few more relevant experiments merit discussion. The early work of Viala and colleagues showed that intravenous delivery of nialamide (monoamine oxidase inhibitor) and DOPA evoked rhythmic phrenic and hindlimb bursting in rabbits with C2 spinal transection. These data provided early evidence for coupling of a spinal locomotor CPG with spinal respiratory circuitry (\nViala and Freton, 1983\n;\nViala et al., 1979\n) (see\nSection 3.6\n). Several years later Pers\u00e9gol and Viala used an in vitro brainstem spinal cord preparation from neonatal rats and showed that drugs including 5-HT evoke rhythmic bursting from the cervical ventral roots after transection of the high cervical cord (\nPers\u00e9gol and Viala, 1994\n). Collectively this work suggests cervical neurons are sensitive to chemical stimuli, and these stimuli, under certain conditions, can produce bursts of activity on respiratory nerves.\n\n3.6. Locomotor activity\nActivation of lumbar locomotor circuits (\nMorin and Viala, 2002\n) as well as limb proprioceptive and/or nociceptive afferents (\nAmann et al., 2010\n) can activate respiratory networks. In turn, this may serve to enable (or facilitate) coupling of the locomotor and respiratory rhythms. It has long been known that these two fundamental biological rhythms can be \u201ccoupled\u201d in mammals such that breathing movements are coordinated with locomotion (\nBramble and Carrier, 1983\n). The most direct evidence for neurologic mechanisms causing respiratory-locomotor coupling comes from in vitro studies under carefully controlled conditions. For example, electrical activation of hindlimb sensory afferent neurons in a neonatal rat brainstem-spinal cord preparation results in a precise 1:1 entrainment of respiratory and locomotor rhythms (\nLe Gal et al., 2014\n). Further, hindlimb flexion-extension movements lead to entrainment of phrenic motor output with limb movement in neonatal rat preparations (\nGiraudin et al., 2012\n). Interestingly, stimulation of dorsal roots at cervical and lumbar levels (e.g., where limb muscle afferents are prominent) is much more effective than thoracic dorsal root stimulation at promoting coupling (\nGiraudin et al., 2012\n). Thus coupling is likely to involve a neural mechanism triggered via activation of proprioceptive afferents. In regards to spinal interneurons, direct recordings in the in vitro preparation show that expiratory spinal interneurons are also activated in phase with locomotor rhythms. This coupling between spinal respiratory interneuron discharge and locomotor rhythms did not require brainstem synaptic inputs, possibly indicating that the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) influences spinal respiratory neurons via propriospinal pathways (\nLe Gal et al., 2016\n;\nLe Gal et al., 2014\n).\nRespiratory-locomotor coupling can also be readily observed in exercising humans by examining the timing of each breath relative to each locomotion cycle (\nBernasconi and Kohl, 1993\n;\nHill et al., 1988\n). The ratio of steps to breaths in a given period is typically used to quantify respiratory-locomotor coupling (\nDaley et al., 2013\n;\nHill et al., 1988\n;\nO\u2019Halloran et al., 2012\n). An example of respiratory-locomotor coupling in humans collected by our research team is shown in\nFig. 4\n. These data were collected in a 41 year old male with a SCI at C5 and classified as a \u201cD\u201d using the American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA) scale. This means more than 50% of the muscles below the level of injury can move against gravity. Note the coupling of the respiratory and locomotor rhythms as indicated by alternating dark and light gray boxes, the number of steps (s) and breaths (b) during each period are marked. This individual with spinal cord injury utilized a 2:1 coupling utilized a 5:2 step to breath ratio, while the spinal injured subject utilized a 2:1 coupling. These data confirm that respiratory locomotor coupling can be observed in persons with SCI as previously reported (\nSherman et al., 2009\n). Further, it has been suggested that a 2:1 entrainment pattern may provide mechanical advantages as the \u201cstep driven flow\u201d can reduce the work of respiratory muscles (\nDaley et al., 2013\n). In turn, this suggests that spinal neural circuits may underlie the entrainment preference since spinobulbar (and bulbospinal) tracts will be altered after SCI. That suggestion is supported by in vitro work showing entrainment after high cervical transection (\nLe Gal et al., 2016\n;\nLe Gal et al., 2014\n), but on the other hand brainstem nuclei are involved in coupling when the spinal cord is intact (\nGiraudin et al., 2012\n). The mechanisms underlying coupling in the injured human spinal cord are unknown, but one intriguing possibility is that enhancing the strength of respiratory-locomotor coupling (e.g., via neurorehabilitation strategies) could improve breathing ability during exercise. Possibilities such as this are one of the reasons to aggressively pursue a deeper understanding of the spinal respiratory neural circuitry.\nFig. 4.\nOpen in a new tab\nExamples of respiratory-locomotor coupling. Recordings of knee angle measured with a goniometer and respiration measured using a nasal temperature probe from individuals walking on a treadmill at a self-selected speed. The largest trough in knee angle demarcates a step (s) cycle. The peaks in the respiratory trace indicate a breath (b) cycle. Coupling periods are marked with alternating dark and light gray boxes and the steps (s) and breaths (b) within that period are annotated using the method described previously (\nHill et al., 1988\n;\nO\u2019Halloran et al., 2012\n). An example record from a 41 year old male with a C5 motor-incomplete SCI, showing a locomotor respiratory coupling in a pattern of two steps (s1\u2013s2) per one breath (b1).\n\n3.7. Respiratory muscle afferents\nAfferent information arising from the respiratory muscles can impact spinal respiratory interneurons and rhythmic respiratory motor output. A few studies suggest that afferents may be a sufficient stimulus to generate rhythmic bursting in respiratory muscles and/or nerves without brainstem input. An early report from Ramos and Mendoza included an example from a spinally transected (C2) rabbit where rhythmic bursting was observed in the diaphragm and intercostals muscles as a result of thoracic distention (\nRamos and Mendoza, 1959\n). A 1977 report from Coglianese et al. showed that after C1\u2013C2 spinal transection in dogs, rhythmic phrenic nerve bursting was observed in sync with positive pressure mechanical ventilation (\nCoglianese et al., 1977\n). Since the phrenic nerve bursts occurred in phase with inflation of the lung, it suggests that activation of afferent neurons sensing the movement of the lung and/or chest wall was triggering the response.\nA few published studies have provided direct evidence that respiratory muscle afferents can activate spinal interneurons. Bellingham and Lipski found that C5 interneurons in cats could be activated or inhibited when the phrenic nerve was electrically stimulated (\nBellingham and Lipski, 1990\n). Similar data have been reported by other research teams in cats (\nIscoe and Duffin, 1996\n) and guinea pigs (\nCleland and Getting, 1993\n), thus demonstrating that this is a consistent response across species. Razook et al. studied rats and showed that stimulation of putative group III/IV diaphragm afferents (based on conduction velocities) increased bursting in C1\u2013C2 interneurons (\nRazook et al., 1995\n). In rats, electrical stimulation of phrenic nerve afferents results in c-Fos activation in mid-cervical spinal interneurons (\nMalakhova and Davenport, 2001\n), and anatomical data suggest that myelinated phrenic afferents terminate in the vicinity of pre-phrenic cervical interneurons (\nNair et al., 2017a\n). Finally, activation of propriospinal pathways via phrenic afferent neurons is indicated by studies of \u201cphrenic-to-phrenic\u201d or \u201cphrenic-to-intercostal\u201d reflexes (reviewed in (\nNair et al., 2017b\n)). Thus, it is very well established that activation respiratory muscle afferents can impact the discharge of spinal interneurons. The relative impact of group 1a/1b vs. group III/IV afferents in altering spinal interneuron discharge is not clear, but there is evidence that both proprioceptive and nociceptive afferents can impact spinal respiratory interneurons. It seems likely that one functional impact of these pathways is to enable coordinated activation between the respiratory muscles and/or coordinated activation of respiratory and locomotor muscles."

Sciatic and optic nerve surgery protocols received institutional IACUC approval. Mice were anesthetized in Isoflurane. For optic nerve crush, the optic nerve was exposed by an incision in the conjunctiva next to the globe and the conjunctiva was retracted by rotating the globe. The optic nerve was grasped with cross action forceps and clamped for 10 seconds. Subsequently, local anesthesia was applied via eye solution followed by eye ointment to prevent drying of the eye. For sciatic nerve transection, animals received a skin incision at mid-thigh level and the sciatic nerve was exposed taking care to minimize damage to surrounding tissues. A 1-2 mm piece was cut 5 mm distal from the proximal nerve to prevent re-attachment of the cut ends. Finally, the skin was closed using fine surgical suture. Animals were kept warm until fully recovered.\nFigure 1.

The synthetic DNA fragment encoding ADPRM mutant (ADPRM-QM, (\nRibeiro et al., 2018\n)) and CD38 mutant (sCD38-DM, (\nZhao et al., 2011\n)) were cloned into lentivirus transfer vector FUGW (\nAraki et al., 2004\n). Briefly the synthetic DNA fragment (IDT) encoding human ADPRM with mutations (F37A, L196F, V252A, and C253G) was cloned using InFusion (Clontech) reaction. CD38 without 45 N-terminal amino acid with two mutations (E146A and T221F) was PCR amplified from pLX304 CD38-V5 (Clone ID: TOLH-1518440, Transomic Technologies) and cloned into lentivirus transfer vecot FUGW (\nAraki et al., 2004\n).\n\nDRG culture and axon degeneration assay\nMouse DRG culture was performed as described before (\nSasaki et al., 2009\n).

Then cell suspensions were triturated by gentle pipetting and washed 3 times with the DRG growth medium (Neurobasal medium (Gibco) containing 2% B27 (Invitrogen), 100 ng/ml 2.5S NGF (Harlan Bioproduts), 1 \u03bcM uridine (Sigma), 1 \u03bcM 5-fluoro-2\u2019-deoxyuridine (Sigma), penicillin, and streptomycin). Cells were suspended in DRG growth medium at a ratio of 100 \u03bcl medium/50 DRGs. The cell density of these suspensions was ~7x10\n6\ncells/ml. Cell suspensions (1.5 \u03bcl/96 well, 10 \u03bcl/24 well) were placed in the center of the well using either 96- or 24-well tissue culture plates (Corning) coated with poly-D-Lysine (0.1 mg/ml; Sigma) and laminin (3 \u03bcg/ml; Invitrogen). Cells were allowed to adhere in humidified tissue culture incubator (5% CO2) for 15 min and then DRG growth medium was gently added (100 \u03bcl/96 well, 500 \u03bcl/24 well). For\nFig. 2B\n, 1 million cells as 10 \u03bcl spotted culture in 24 well plate were used with 1 ml DRG growth medium. Lentiviruses were added (1-10\u00d710\n3\npfu) at 1\u20132 days in vitro (DIV) and metabolites were extracted or axon degeneration assays (\nSasaki et al., 2009\n) were performed at 6\u20137 DIV.

Cells were seeded at a density of 1 \u00d7 10\n6\ncells per 35 mm well on the day before transfection. FCIV lentivirus transfer vectors (400 ng) was co-transfected with VSV-G (400 ng) and pSPAX2 (1.2 \u03bcg) using X-tremeGene (Roche). The virus containing medium was collected at 3\u20135 days after transfection. The lentivirus particles (1\u201310\n5\nx 10\n6\ninfectious particles/ml) were collected from the cleared culture supernatant with Lenti-X concentrator (Clontech) and resuspended in the 1/10 original volume of PBS, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nMetabolite extraction\nMetabolites extraction from DRG neurons: at DIV6, tissue culture plates were placed on ice and culture medium replaced with ice-cold saline (0.9% NaCl in water, 500\u03bcl per well). For collection of axonal metabolites, cell bodies were removed using a pipette. For collection of intracellular metabolites, saline was removed and replaced with 160 \u03bcL ice cold 50% MeOH in water. The axons were incubated for a minimum of 5 min on ice with the 50% MeOH solution and then the solution was transferred to tubes containing 50 \u03bcl chloroform on ice, shaken vigorously, and centrifuged at 20,000\ng\nfor 15 min at 4\u00b0C. The clear aqueous phase (140 \u03bcl) was transferred into a microfuge tube and lyophilized under vacuum. Lyophilized samples were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until measurement.\nTissue metabolites extraction in\nFigures 1C\n-\nD\n: tissues were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Frozen tissues were homogenized by sonication (Branson Sonifier 450, output 2.5, 50% duty cycle, 10- 20 sec) in 50% MeOH in water (10 \u03bcl/mg tissue). Homogenates were centrifuged (13,000\ng\n, 10 min, 4\u00b0C) and cleared supernatants were transferred to new tubes. One third volume of chloroform was added to the supernatant, mixed, and centrifuged (13,000\ng\n, 10 min, 4\u00b0C). The aqueous phase (100 \u03bcl) was transferred to a new tube and lyophilized and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until analysis. Lyophilized samples were reconstituted with 5 mM ammonium formate (50 \u03bcl for the brain 15 \u03bcl for the sciatic nerve), centrifuged (13,000\ng\n, 10 min, 4\u00b0C), and 10 \u03bcl clear supernatant was loaded on LC-MS.\nTissue metabolites extraction in\nFigures 2C\nand\n5\n: at time of tissue collection animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the optic or sciatic nerves were quickly removed and placed on an ice cold metal plate. The length of the individual nerve sample was measured using digital calipers, after removing the swollen end near the site of transection or crush. Tissues were transferred to pre-filled collection tubes (CK28 Precellys tube, Bertin technologies) with 1 mL ice-cold accetonitrile (Carlo Erba) in water (Fischer chemical) mixed with 1% formic acid (Acros organic) (3:1). Tubes were thawed on ice and homogenized with 10 \u03bcl of 2-chloroadenosine (2 ng/\u03bcl), used as an internal standard. The samples were ground three times at 4500 rpm for 90 sec with a Precellys Evolution (Bertin Technologies, Aix en Provence, France). The homogenate was centrifuged at 4\u00b0C (4500\ng\nfor 5 min) and 900 \u03bcl of the supernatant were transferred to a borosilicate tube. The sample was ground again in 1.1 ml of a solution of acetonitrile / water 1% formic acid (3:1) three times at 4500 rpm for 90 sec. After centrifugation, 900 \u03bcl of the supernatant were transferred to the same borosilicate tube. The combined extracts were evaporated to dryness at 40\u00b0C in a Genevac EZ-2 Plus Evaporator (Genevac, Ipswich, UK).\nFigure 5.

To increase the sensitivity and specificity of the analysis, we worked in multiple reaction monitoring and followed the MS/MS transitions: NAD\n+\nMH+, 664.1\u2013136.1; ADPR MH+, 560.1\u2013136.1; cADPR MH+, 542.1\u2013136.1; 2Cl-Ade MH+, 302.1\u2013170.1. The spray chamber settings were as follows: heated capillary, 325\u00b0C; vaporizer temperature, 40\u00b0C; spray voltage, 3500 V; sheath gas, 50 arbitrary units; auxiliary gas 10 arbitrary units. Calibration curves were produced by using synthetic NAD, ADPR, cADPR and 2-chloroadenosine (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). The amounts of metabolites in the samples were determined by using inverse linear regression of standard curves. Values are expressed as ng per 100,000 cells for axons, ng/mL for supernatant and ng/mm of tissue for the nerves.\n\nPlasma NfL measurement\nBlood plasma (120 \u03bcl) was collected from the facial vein into a 200 \u03bcl K-EDTA Sarstedt tubes . Samples were placed on ice and centrifuged as early as possible for 5 min, at 10.000 g and 4\u00b0C. Plasma NfL was measured by ELISA using the NF-Light ELISA kit from Uman Diagnostics (Ume\u00e5, Sweden) using the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSample number (n) was defined as the number of cell culture wells that were independently manipulated and measured or the number of mice. Data comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney test (two group comparison) or one-way ANOVA using R. F and P values for ANOVA were reported for each comparison in corresponding figure legends. For multiple comparisons, the Holm-Bonferroni multiple comparison method was used."

    "Methods": "A detailed description of this model, the stereologic quantification of hippocampal neuronal death, and the neurologic deficit scoring system can be found inBalan et al. (2006). All animal procedures were performed as approved by the University of Maryland Baltimore Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. Ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest was induced in chloralose-anesthetized and intubated adult female (9\u201312 kg) purebred beagles (Covance) by stopping the ventilator and applying electrical stimulation to the cardiac surface with a Grass stimulator. Ten min later, dogs were ventilated with 100% O2and the heart resuscitated using 3 min open-chest CPR and electrical defibrillation. Following defibrillation, animals were maintained on 100% oxygen for one hr and then 28\u201335% oxygen for an additional 23 hr. All 11 animals received constant critical care with a morphine drip and additional boluses as needed for analgesia. A subgroup of animals (n=4) received an intravenous 5 min infusion of sulforaphane (LKT Laboratories Inc., catalog number S-8044) at 1 mg per kg in saline containing 0.6% dimethyl sulfoxide immediately after defibrillation. Pancuronium was used intermittently, only as needed, to facilitate ventilation and only after verification that the animal was adequately anesthetized. Ventilation was adjusted to maintain arterial carbon dioxide and oxygen in normal ranges.\n\nAt hr 20, anesthesia and analgesia were lightened, and animals weaned from controlled ventilation. At hr 23, the effects of morphine were reversed with naloxone and the neurological deficit score (NDS) was measured by two examiners blinded to treatment protocol. The NDS used has been validated in other laboratories (Bircher and Safar, 1985), as well as ours (Rosenthal et al., 1992) and is a multisystem test of 18 parameters in 5 categories (level of consciousness, respiration, cranial nerve, motor, sensory, behavior), yielding a score between 0 (normal) and 100 (brain death). Following the 5 min NDS procedure, the dogs were re-anesthetized with pentobarbital and \u03b1-chloralose, intubated, and mechanically ventilated. At 24 hr post-resuscitation, the deeply anesthetized animals were perfusion-fixed with paraformaldehyde. The fixed brains were removed and processed for histopathology."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nSubjects were 23 male Long-Evans rats (Charles River, Wilmington, MA). Rats were approximately 4 months old at the time of injury, and 7 months at euthanasia. Rats were pair-housed pre-injury and single-housed post-injury in controlled environmental conditions and standard cages (temperature, 24\u00b0C; 12-h reverse light/dark cycle). Rats had continuous access to water in home cages but were food restricted at approximately 14g/day post-session. All procedures were approved by the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, under the guidance of the NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nRotarod\nThe rotarod task is a sensitive measure of motor impairment following TBI [e.g.,\n25\n], which consists of a cylinder located above a foam pad (Rota Rod Rotamex 5, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). The cylinder is controlled mechanically to rotate and accelerate. To evaluate motor function, the rotarod task was administered for two sessions immediately preceding injury (training) and again for three sessions on post-injury days 7-9 (testing). At the start of the first session, rats were required to stand on the stationary cylinder for 60 s without falling to habituate them to the task. After meeting this criterion, training began immediately. During each trial, rats were placed on the cylinder as it began rotating at a rate of 5 rpm for 20 s. After 20 s, the cylinder began accelerating from 5 rpm to 50 rpm over a period of 300 s (acceleration rate of 0.055 cm/s\n2\nor 0.15 rpm/s). Four trials were conducted per rat per day with an approximate intertrial interval of 10 min. Latency to fall was the outcome measure of interest and was calculated by averaging the latencies for all four trials during a single session.\n\nTBI Surgery\nRats were matched for performance on the rotarod and then randomly assigned to TBI (n = 9) or Sham (n = 14) groups. Controlled cortical impact (CCI) procedures were carried out aseptically, as previously described [\n26\n]. Briefly, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 2-4% maintenance) in 0.5 L/min oxygen. Local (bupivacaine, 0.25%) and general (ketoprofen, 5 mg/kg) analgesic were given subcutaneously. Rats were placed in a stereotaxic frame, the surgical site sterilized, and a midline incision performed. After retracting the periosteum, a 5 mm circular craniectomy was measured out in the left hemisphere, centered at +2.4 mm, \u22122.4 mm from bregma and performed using a surgical drill. A severe, unilateral parietal CCI (4 mm in diameter, 2.5 mm depth, 3 m/s velocity, 500 ms dwell time) was induced using a Leica Impact One CCI device (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Bleeding was stopped, incision site sutured closed, and triple-antibiotic ointment applied to the site. Sham surgeries were identical to TBI surgery with exception of the impact. Rats were placed on free-feeding for four days following surgery, after which they were leaned back down to 14g/day to motivate behavior on the RGT.\n\nRodent Gambling Task (RGT)\nApparatus.\nBehavioral testing took place in 16 standard five-hole operant conditioning chambers for rats, each enclosed in a sound-attenuating cubicle (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT). Each chamber included a stimulus light at the back of each 5-choice hole and infrared beams to record nose pokes. A food magazine with a light was on the wall opposite to the working wall with a pellet dispenser and houselight above it. Chambers were controlled by custom software written in Med-PC IV. Sucrose pellets (45 mg, BioServ, Fleming, NJ) were used as reinforcers.\nTraining.\nAfter seven days of recovery from surgery, RGT training was conducted as described previously [\n20\n,\n24\n]. First, 20-min habituation sessions were conducted in which sucrose pellets were placed manually into all five nose-poke holes and the food magazine. Once rats consumed all of the pellets during one session, training began to shape responses to the presentation of cue lights in the nose-poke holes. To initiate a trial, rats nose-poked into the food magazine. After a 5-s delay, a cue light turned on in one of the five nose-poke holes for 30 s. A response to the corresponding nose-poke hole resulted in the delivery of a single sucrose pellet. Premature responses before the cue light turned on, incorrect responses, or omitted responses resulted in a 5-s timeout. Sessions were terminated following 30 min or 100 reinforcers, whichever came first. Once rats completed at least 30 trials, the cue light duration was reduced from 30 s to 20 s and eventually to 10 s [\n27\n]. RGT training began when rats completed at least 50 trials with 80% accuracy at the 10-s cue light duration.\nPrior to beginning the full RGT, training was conducted using a \u201cforced-choice\u201d trials procedure for seven sessions (weeks 3 and 4 post-injury). One at a time, four choice options were presented, each associated with a different probability and magnitude of reinforcement and punishment (see\nFig 1\n). Choice PI had a 90:10% chance of one sucrose pellet or a 5-s timeout. Choice P2 had an 80:20% chance of two sucrose pellets or a 10-s timeout. Choice P3 had a 60:40% chance of three sucrose pellets or a 30-s timeout. Choice P4 had a 40:60% chance of four sucrose pellets or a 40-s timeout. \u201cForced-choice\u201d sessions lasted 30 min and each trial included only one available choice option to familiarize rats with the different contingencies. Rats were required to nose poke into the food magazine to initiate atrial. After a 5-s delay, the cue light for one nose-poke hole was turned on. Premature responses made before the cue light came on were punished with a 5-s timeout. Following a correct response to the corresponding hole, either the associated number of pellets would be delivered (\u201cwin\u201d) or no pellets would be delivered (\u201closs\u201d) and the choice hole would slowly (1 Hz) flash for the duration of the timeout. Contingency locations were kept consistent for individual rats throughout the study and were counterbalanced across rats using two versions of the program.\nTesting.\nTesting on the full RGT began during week 5 post-injury. Sessions during the full RGT were identical to those during \u201cforced-choice\u201d training with except that all four nose-poke holes were illuminated on each trial and rats could choose freely between the four options (Pf-P4). Full RGT responding was assessed until 12 weeks post-injury. To maximize reinforcement, the P2 option should be chosen 100% of the time as it is the most optimal alternative.\n\nLesion Analysis\nFollowing behavioral assessment (12 weeks post-injury), rats were transcardially perfused with 0.9% phosphate buffered saline, followed by 3.7% phosphate buffered formaldehyde. After perfusions, brains were post-fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 24 h and placed in 30% sucrose solution for 48 h. Brains were them embedded in a gel matrix (15% gelatin) with between three and four brains per gel block, and then sliced, frozen, on a sliding microtome at 30 pm.\nFor lesion analysis, four sections were selected (0.0, \u22121.0, \u22122.0, and \u22123.0 from bregma) and mounted to slides before cresyl violet or thionin staining. In brief, slides were rehydrated through alcohols with increasing concentrations of water, stained with thionin or cresyl violet, and then dehydrated through alcohols with decreasing concentrations of water. Images were captured on a Konica Minolta copier at 600 DPI and the area of each hemisphere was measured using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Volumes for each hemisphere were calculated by multiplying the mean area from the four coordinates by the thickness of sections (30 pm) and total number of sections (4). Then, extent of injury was determined by calculating the percent reduction from the contralateral hemisphere using the formula: 100\u2212(ipsilateral hemisphere volume/contralateral hemisphere volume)* 100.\n\nData Analysis\nBefore analyzing statistically, dependent variables were tested for normality with a Box-Cox test and transformations were applied as appropriate to ensure normality.\nFor nose-poke training, sessions required to meet criterion to progress to the forced-choice RGT procedure were analyzed as a function of group (FBI vs. Sham) using an independent-samples\nt\n-test. Omissions (motivation) during nose-poke training were analyzed using linear mixed-effects regression, examining effects of Group, Session, and Group x Session interactions. For forced-choice RGT training, omitted and premature responses (motor impulsivity) across the seven sessions were analyzed as a function of group using independent samples\nt\n-tests.\nThe primary dependent measure from the full RGT procedure was percent choice among the four nose-poke options. However, premature responses (motor impulsivity), omitted responses (motivation), pellets earned (overall efficiency), trials completed, win-stay percentages, and lose-shift percentages were also recorded and analyzed. Win-stay percentages were calculated as the percent of trials in which a \u201cwin\u201d was followed by a subsequent response on the same nose poke. Lose-shift percentages were calculated as the percent of trials in which a \u201closs\u201d was followed by a subsequent response on an alternative nose poke. The arcsine-square root transformation was applied to choice data, log transformation for premature responses, pellets earned, trials completed, and lose-shift percentages, inverse square-root transformation for omitted trials, and square transformation for win-stay percentages. Then, RGT outcome measures and latency to fall (s) from the rotarod were analyzed using linear mixed-effects regression, examining effects of Group, Time, and Group x Time interactions. Linear mixed-effects regressions were used because they account for the nested nature of individual subjects within groups; given that parameters are allowed to vary at each nested level, precise estimates and strong models are obtained. For lesion analysis, the percent reduction score for the ipsilateral hemisphere was analyzed using an independent-samples\nt\n-test. All analyses were performed using R statistical software (\nhttp://www.r-project.org/\n) in the\nMASS, lme4, lmerTest\n, and\nstats\nlibraries. All outcomes were considered statistically significant at the level of\np\n< 0,05."

To evaluate the effect of Mfsd2a on BBB permeability and neurobehavior outcome following SBI, Mfsd2a was either overexpressed or downregulated in the brain by administering Mfsd2a CRISPR activation or knockout plasmids, respectively. The potential mechanism of Mfsd2a-mediated BBB protection through the cav-1/Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling pathway was evaluated."

    "Methods": "Materials.\nMale\nSarm1\nknockout mice (B6.129X1-Sarm1\ntm1Aidi\n/J; strain 018069) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The following antibodies were used in these studies: astrocytic marker GFAP (Bethyl, custom), microglia marker Iba1 (Synaptic Systems, cat# 234004), myelin marker MBP (Millipore, cat# MAB386), dendritic marker MAP2 (Millipore, cat# AB5622), neuronal marker NeuN (Millipore, cat# ABN91), and axonal injury marker amyloid precursor protein APP (Abcam, cat# ab32136). Species-specific secondary antibodies linked to AlexaFluor dyes (AlexaFluor-430, AlexaFluor-488, AlexaFluor-54, AlexaFluor-594, and AlexaFluor-647) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA).\n\nRepeated mild closed head injury (rmCHI).\nThe\nSarm1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice purchased from Jackson Labs have been backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice for at least 16 generations and maintained using a homozygous \u00d7 homozygous breeding scheme. Therefore, wild-type C57BL/6J mice are recommended by Jackson Labs as the appropriate control strain. Twenty male\nSarm1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice and twenty C57BL/6J mice (aged 24 weeks) were single housed on a 12-hour light/dark cycle, with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. Experiments were performed during the light cycle. All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Repeat mild closed head injury was delivered essentially as described previously (\nHylin et al., 2013\n;\nOjo et al., 2016\n). Mice were initially anesthetized with 5% isoflurane in a 1:1 O\n2\n/air mixture, mounted on a stereotaxic frame, then maintained with a 2.5% isoflurane and 1:1 O\n2\n/air mixture via a face mask. A midline incision was made and the soft tissue reflected to expose the skull. A stereotaxic frame was used to immobilize the animal during the surgical incision and ensure a smooth cut was made. The mouse was then transferred to a foam pad designed to support the head level with the body. At 40 sec after discontinuation of anesthesia (a time point at which mice typically regain their tail withdrawal reflex after anesthesia), a single impact was applied to the skull. A metal impactor tip (5 mm in diameter) was driven at a velocity of 5.0 m/sec to a depth of 1.0 mm. The center of the tip was located midway between lambda and bregma, over the sagittal suture. Immediately following the injury, the animals were monitored for apnea, and when normal breathing was observed, the scalp was closed using sterile surgical staples. Mice received one injury/day for 4 consecutive days. Minor skull fractures were observed in 15% of the injured mice independent of genotype. Mice with skull fractures, noted either during surgery or during euthanasia, were removed from the study. Sham mice received daily anesthesia, but were not injured.\n\nVestibulomotor and Motor Function.\nThe foot-fault, or grid walking task, and Rotarod tasks were used to assess motor function and coordination. Motor testing began 24 hr after the last injury, and was carried out for three consecutive days. For each day of testing, animals were brought to the testing room and allowed to acclimate for an hour. Following the acclimation period, animals were first tested in the foot fault task, followed by a 1\u20132 hour break. Animals were then tested on the Rotarod task. This testing order was chosen to avoid any fatigue or distress from the Rotarod task that could have altered performance in the foot fault task.\nFoot-faults were evaluated by placing the animal on a wire grid (1\u00d71 cm) and the number of foot misplacements out of a total of 50 steps were counted. A fault was defined as when a front paw missed and appeared below the plane of the wire grid. Right and left forepaws were scored independently on three trials/day which were averaged. Animals were trained on the Rotarod for the first two days after injury by placing the animal upon the stationary Rotarod for a period of 5 sec, after which a slow rotation (4 rpm) was initiated and then incrementally increased by 4 rpm every 10 sec until a maximum of 40 rpm was reached. On the third day after the last injury, locomotor function was tested by placing the animal upon the stationary Rotarod for a period of 5 sec, after which the rotation was initiated at a constant speed of 32 rpm. Rotarod testing was repeated three times and averaged. Animals were allowed 10 to 15 minutes between trials to ensure ample time for the animals to rest and recover.\n\nNovel Objection Recognition (NOR).\nBeginning on day 4 post-injury, animals were habituated to an empty training chamber (30 cm \u00d7 30 cm) for two 10-minute periods per day for two days. On the third day, training was carried out by placing two identical objects in the chamber and the animal allowed to freely explore them for 10 minutes. Twenty four hours later, the mouse was tested for its long-term memory by replacing one of the objects with a new object of a different shape and allowing it to again explore the objects for 10 minutes. Trials were video recorded and the time spent exploring each object was measured during both the familiarization period and memory test by an experimenter blind to the animals\u2019 experimental group.\n\nContext Fear Discrimination.\nThe context fear discrimination task assesses an animal\u2019s ability to distinguish between two similar contexts (one \u201csafe\u201d and one \u201cshock\u201d), and has been shown to be dependent on hippocampal function (\nFrankland et al., 1998\n). On day 28 post-injury, mice were pre-exposed (without shock) to two contexts sharing certain features (background noise, animal handling to and from the room) while differing in others (different floor surface, scent, and wall colors). During training, animals were given two trials each day, one in each chamber (\u201csafe\u201d and \u201cshock\u201d). For the \u201cshock\u201d chamber, mice were placed in the chamber and allowed to freely explore their surroundings for 148 sec. A 2-sec, 0.70 mA shock was then given, followed by an additional 30 sec during which the animal remained in the chamber. In the \u201csafe\u201d chamber, animals were allowed to freely explore the chamber for the entire 3 min and no shock was given. Animals were exposed to the \u201cshock\u201d and \u201csafe\u201d chambers once a day for 4 days. Discrimination of the two contexts was assessed by comparing the time spent freezing in each chamber during training. Trials were recorded and freezing behavior analyzed using tracking software (Ethovision, Noldus Information Technology, Leesbury VA, USA).\n\nImmunohistochemistry.\nAfter the completion of behavioral testing (six months after the last injury) mice were given an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg), followed by exsanguination with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were carefully removed and post-fixed in PBS/4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and then cryoprotected in PBS with 30% sucrose. Brains were sectioned on a cryostat in the coronal plane at 20 \u03bcm through the rostral-caudal extent of the brain. Selected sections were rinsed in PBS and then permeabilized in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 two times for 10 min each. After washing in PBS, sections were blocked in PBS containing 2.5% BSA and 2.5% normal goat serum for 1 h, then incubated overnight in blocking buffer supplemented with primary antibody (0.5\u20131.0 \u03bcg/ml). After extensive washing in PBS, sections were incubated for 1 h in PBS containing species-specific secondary antibodies linked to AlexaFluor dyes. After additional washing, sections were rinsed for 2 min in PBS containing 0.1 \u03bcg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Sections were mounted onto glass Apex Superior Adhesive Slides (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and coverslipped with ProLong Gold (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) to reduce fading.\n\nFluorescence Intensity Quantification.\nImmunofluorescence imaging was performed using an Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanning microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with an X-Cite XYLIS LED light source (Waltham, MA) and custom filter sets for AlexaFluor-430, AlexaFluor-488, AlexaFluor-546, AlexaFluor-594, and AlexaFluor-647 (Semrock). Images were captured using a 20X/0.8 Plan-Apochromat objective (Zeiss) and ORCA-Flash4.0 sCMOS digital camera (Hamamatsu) at 325 nm/pixel resolution, and montaged using Zen Blue 2.3 software. Exposure and gain settings were adjusted using a section from a sham animal and then kept constant across all groups. Four sections from each animal, ~250 \u03bcm apart (Bregma \u22121.22 mm to \u22122.18 mm), were used to quantify fluorescence intensity signals for each of the markers in regions of interest (ROIs) in both hemispheres. For each marker, the ROI was traced in ImageJ. Myelin basic protein (MBP) immunoreactivity was used as a guide to accurately differentiate between the alveus and the overlying corpus callosum and external capsule. ROIs were identified using a mouse brain atlas and regions included the corpus callosum (750 \u03bcm traced at the midline between the cingulum bundle of either hemisphere), the entirety of the cingulum bundle, the alveus (traced from middle of the cingulum bundle to the lateral ventricle), and the entirety of the fimbria. The off-target fluorescence intensity (measurement of region without specific signal) for each fluorochrome was measured for each section, averaged and subtracted from the target signal for quantification. The corrected fluorescent intensity was then averaged across the four sections for each animal and data (mean \u00b1 standard error) is presented relative to wild-type sham (set to 100%). For presentation purposes, a magnified image from within the ROI is shown to illustrate staining within axon bundles (for APP) or in astrocytes (for GFAP) or microglia (for Iba1).\n\nStatistical Analysis.\nData were analyzed using Sigma Plot 14.0 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA). Acute neurological measures (duration of apnea and suppression of pain reflexes, and latency to return of righting response) and the number of foot missteps in foot fault were analyzed using three-way repeated measures ANOVAs for Injury, Genotype, and Time. Latency to fall from the Rotarod, and fluorescence intensity were analyzed using two-way ANOVAs for Injury and Genotype. Percent time freezing in contextual fear discrimination task was analyzed within each group with two-way repeated measures ANOVAs for Context and Time. Percent time spent with the novel compared to familiar objects in the novel object recognition task was analyzed within groups using two-sample paired t-tests. All data was tested for normality using a Shapiro-Wilk test. Data not having a normal distribution was statistically compared using an appropriate nonparametric test. Data was not transformed to satisfy normality. Significant omnibus differences were further analyzed using Bonferroni corrected\npost-hoc\nanalyses. All data are reported as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean."

    "Methods": "Animals:\nAll procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Kentucky, and studies were conducted in accordance with the standards of proper experimentation in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and ARRIVE guidelines. Experiments used either 4-month-old C57BL/6J mice or 2-month-old rTg4510 mice. Experiments included an equal ratio of male and female mice for all endpoints. Data for both sexes were combined after observing no differences between the responses of male and female mice tested. However, the study was not statistically powered to assess sex differences; thus, we cannot conclude that sex differences did not affect our results. The number of mice used for each endpoint is shown in the figure legend. One mouse died from apnea after the 2nd CHI surgery, and one mouse was excluded because of poor healing of the surgical incision; both mice were from the 2x CHI group (1d) in\nFigure 1\n. No other mice died or were excluded from the study. Mice were randomized and assigned groups before the start of the experiment. The study was completed with multiple batches of mice using a block experimental design, with each batch including all experimental groups and the order of the group was randomized for each block so that the order of sham and CHI surgery varied for each cage. Each cage of mice included more than one experimental group. Each subject was given a unique identification number, which does not identify the experimental group. The persons conducting the endpoint analysis were blinded to the treatment conditions.\nFigure 1: Characterization of 2-hit CHI model in WT mice.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A)\nGraphical summary of the overall experimental design is shown. The white boxes indicating a sham surgery, with the red boxes indicating a CHI surgery.\n(B)\nMice were tested in the voluntary running wheel assay and the total distance traveled per day is shown in the bar graph. At 1d post injury (p.i.) the mice 2x CHI (1d) ran significantly less than the sham injured mice. *sham vs. 2x CHI (1d) p=0.032. A Mesoscale discovery Elisa was used to measure p-tau and total tau in a PBS soluble and detergent (TPER) soluble fraction of the cortex brain homogenate at 7d post injury\n(C)\nAn increase in detergent soluble p-tau (*sham vs. 2x CHI (7d) p=0.017),\n(D)\nand total tau (**sham vs. 2x CHI (1d) p=0.0027. *sham vs. 2x CHI (7d) p=0.0257) was seen in the 2x CHI groups.\n(E)\nA shift in the ratio of detergent soluble to PBS was found in the 2x CHI groups. (*sham vs. 2x CHI (1d) p=0.045).\n(F)\nRatio of p-tau to total tau is increased in the PBS soluble fraction (*sham vs. 2x CHI (7d) p=0.033). Sham n=11, 1x CHI n=12, 2x CHI (1d) n=4, 2x CHI (7d) n=8.\n\nClosed head injury (CHI):\nThe CHI model was performed as previously described (\nBachstetter et al., 2015\n;\nWebster et al., 2015\n). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3\u20135%). The head was stabilized in a stereotaxic frame before a sagittal midline incision was made. A 1ml latex pipette bulb filled with water was placed under the head. The stereotaxic electromagnetic impactor used a 5.0mm flat steel tip (Leica Biosystems). It delivered a closed-skull midline impact (coordinates: mediolateral, 0.0mm; anteroposterior, 1.5mm) 1.0mm deep with a controlled velocity (5.0\u00b10.2m/s) and a dwell time of (100ms). Sham mice received the incision, but not the impact. At time 0, all mice received a sham or CHI surgery. At 24h or 168h after the first surgery, the mice underwent a second sham or CHI surgery.\n\nNesting Behavior:\nThe nesting test followed established protocols as previously described (\nWebster et al., 2015\n). Briefly, a 5cm \u00d7 5cm pressed cotton square was added to the cage between 4\u20135pm. After 15\u201316h, two observers blind to the experimental conditions scored the quality of the nest following a semi-quantitative 5-point scale (1: >90% of nestlet intact; 2: 50\u201390% of nestlet intact; 3: 10\u201350% of nestlet intact but no identifiable nest site; 4: <10% of nestlet intact, nest is identifiable but flat; 5: <10% of nestlet intact, nest is identifiable with walls higher than the mouse body).\n\nRunning wheel behavior:\nThe running wheel assay followed our previously described protocol (\nWebster et al., 2015\n). Briefly, at 12\u201314h following the CHI or sham injury, the mice were introduced into the running wheels (Lafayette Instruments; Lafayette, IN) and data was recorded for 5 days. Computerized counting software (Lafayette Instruments; Lafayette, IN) automatically recorded the total distance run each hour by each animal, and the 1-hour blocks were combined into 1d blocks.\n\nRadial Arm Water Maze (RAWM) behavior:\nThe six-arm RAWM followed the well-established protocol, as previously described (\nBachstetter et al., 2015\n;\nWebster et al., 2015\n). Briefly, in block 1 (first 6 trials) and block 2 (6 trials), mice were trained to identify the platform location by alternating between a visible and a hidden platform (3 hidden platform trials and 3 visible platform trials for each block). Block 3 (3 trials) used only a hidden platform. The next one or two day, mice were tested in 3 blocks of 5 trials each (blocks 4\u20136; 15 total trials), all using only a hidden platform. Data are presented as the average errors per block during the hidden platform trials. RAWM performance was recorded and scored using EthoVision XT 8.0 video tracking software (Noldus Information Technology).\n\nBrain tissue harvesting, biochemical endpoints:\nMice were deep anesthetized with 5% isoflurane prior to transcardial perfusion with ice-cold PBS for 5 min. The brains were rapidly removed, dissected, processed, and archived for subsequent biochemical analysis as previously described (\nWebster et al., 2015\n). Brain homogenates for tau levels were made as previously described (\nWebster et al., 2015\n). Levels of p-Thr231 and total tau were measured by V-Plex ELISA from Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Western blots were performed as previously described with minor modifications (\nKoren et al., 2019\n;\nMeier et al., 2015\n). Briefly, protein levels were first determined by BCA. Western blotting was performed with SDS-PAGE using 10% tris-glycine gels (Biorad). Samples were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Following a 1 hour block in 5% milk in tris-buffered saline (TBS), blots were incubated with primary antibody in 5% milk/TBS overnight. The following day, blots were washed in TBS, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (ThermoFisher) for one hour, washed again, and then exposed using West Pico Plus chemiluminescent substrate (ThermoFisher) on the Amersham 680 Imager. Stripping of blots in between probes was performed with incubations in 0.5 M sodium hydroxide for 15 minutes followed by TBS washes. In this fashion, PHF1 (abcam), H150 (Santa Cruz), and Actin (Santa Cruz) antibodies were all serially applied to the same membrane. Western blot images were analyzed using imageJ software.\n\nMagnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging:\nMR imaging was performed in the University of Kentucky Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy Center (MRISC) on a 7-Tesla Clinscan scanner (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) using a cylindrical volume coil for excitation and a cryocoil for detection as previously described (\nFontaine et al., 2017\n). Briefly, manganese chloride (MnCl2, 30 mM) prepared in saline was delivered to mice via intraperitoneal injection (66 mg/kg). Imaging was performed before the injection of MnCl2 (baseline) and repeated at 6 hours after injection. During the imaging, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane, and vital signs (core temperature and respirations) were monitored. Look-Locker imaging was performed following nonselective spin inversion in one slice of the brain containing large regions of hippocampus. Fifty images were acquired following inversion with image spacing of 100 ms (total sequence repetition time of 5s) to fully sample the T1 relaxation curve. Additional image parameters included TR/TE = 5500/1.9, Matrix = 128 \u00d7 128, number of averages = 3, field of view = 17 mm \u00d7 17 mm \u00d7 0.7 mm. T2-weighted images were acquired covering the entire brain (excluding the cerebellum and olfactory bulb) using a turbo-spin echo sequence with TR/TE = 3360/42, Slices = 21, Matrix = 448 \u00d7 336, number of averages = 2, field of view = 25 mm \u00d7 25 mm \u00d7 0.5 mm. The imaging procedures for scanning a mouse were completed in 45 minutes.\n\nMR data analysis:\nImage mapping and analysis were performed in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). Images from the Look-Locker series were used to reconstruct voxel-by-voxel signal relaxation curves which were fit to the equation S(TI) = S\no\n*(1\u2212e\n\u2212R1*TI\n), where S(t) represents the signal at a given inversion time (TI), S\no\nrepresents the steady-state signal at maximal TI, and R1 represents the longitudinal relaxation rate. Regions of interest (dentate gyrus [DG], cornu ammonis 1 [CA1], cornu ammonis 3 [CA3], and superior medial cortex [CTX]) were identified using the Allen Brain Mouse Atlas. Within each, the change in R1 relaxation rates (\u0394R1) before and after MnCl2 exposure was calculated as \u0394\nR\n1 =\nR\n1\n6\nh\n\u2212\nR\n1\nbaseline\n.\n\nStatistical Analysis:\nJMP Software version 12.0 (SAS institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used for statistical analysis. A repeated-measures ANOVA was used for RAWM. For all other endpoints, a one-way ANOVA was used comparing injury groups. If a significant main effect was found,\npost hoc\nanalysis was used to compare groups. Differences between mean were considered significant at \u03b1=0.05. Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism version 7.0. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM, unless otherwise noted. Number of mice used for each endpoint are indicated in the figure or figure legend.\n\nSystematic review:\nSearch Criteria:\nOur search criteria were established to be specific for mild TBI models caused by a closed head injury (\nBodnar et al., 2019\n). Following guidelines established by PRISMA (\nMoher et al., 2009\n), comprehensive searches (on 5/15/2018) of both PubMed and Web of Science were conducted using the following keyword search: mild TBI, concussion, closed head injury, rodent, mice, mouse, or rat; excluding controlled cortical impact, fluid percussion, or review papers. Using the advanced search tools on PubMed and Web of Science, we searched both title and abstract with the following Boolean search strategy: [(((((((rodent) OR rat) OR mouse) OR mice)) AND (((mild TBI) OR concussion) OR closed head injury))) NOT ((CCI) OR fluid percussion)]. From PubMed, 984 articles were given in the final results and Web of Science produced 1,336 articles. Both of these lists of articles were combined, and duplicate references were removed leaving 1,890 articles (\nFigure 1\n). The search was repeated on PubMed on 4/3/19 to identify additional articles published in the previous year. The following MESH Headings were used in the search [brain concussion, AND (mice or rats)], resulting in 411 articles.\nInclusion/Exclusion Criteria:\nAbstracts and titles were screened by CNB to include only peer-reviewed primary research reports specific for mild, closed head traumatic brain injury only in rodents. All other types of articles were excluded. Blast injuries were excluded because although military related blast injuries are a major cause of TBI (\nDeWitt et al., 2013\n), the vast complexity of the different injury models used were beyond the scope of this review (\nCourtney and Courtney, 2015\n)."

    "Methods": "Mouse Breeding and Maintenance\nTissue-specific\nDars2\nknock-out mice were generated using the Cre-LoxP system. LoxP-flanked\nDars2\nmice (as described in\nDogan et al., 2014\n) were mated with mice expressing cre-recombinase under the regulation of the CamKII\u03b1 promotor (The Jackson Laboratory stock no. 005359) to selectively knock-out\nDars2\nexpression in CamKII\u03b1-expressing neurons (mutant mice). All experimental mice were bred in house and genotyped for presence of homozygous flox sites and cre by Transnetyx (Cordova, TN). All animal procedures were carried out in accordance with the\nNational Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\nand were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Johns Hopkins University.\n\nBehavior\nBehavioral assessments were performed in control (n = 12) and mutant (n = 12) mice. Assessment of open field behavior began on or around post-natal day (PND) 50 and continued bi-weekly until perfusion on or around PND 250. Open field (45 \u00d7 45 cm) activity over a 10-minute period was assessed using the Photobeam Activity System from San Diego Instruments in which distance traveled, time in center, and rearing activity were measured.\n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\nSix- and nine-month old control (6 month, n = 5; 9 month, n = 2) and mutant mice (6 month, n = 3; 9 month, n = 5) were anesthetized with isoflurane and imaged using a Bruker Biospec horizontal 11.7 T animal scanner (Bruker Corp., Billerica, MA) in the F.M. Kirby Research Center High-Field Preclinical MR Facility at the Kennedy Krieger Institute. Heart and respiratory rates were monitored throughout image acquisition. Following a localizer scan, T2-weighted images were acquired using the following parameters: echo time (TE)/repetition time (TR) = 30/4600 ms, 2 signal averages, with a FOV of 20 \u00d7 20 mm\n2\n, matrix size of 256 \u00d7 256, and a total of 45 slices of 0.5 mm thickness. Total scan time was approximately five minutes per animal. Images were reconstructed and analyzed using ROI Editor software by experimenters blinded to groups.\n\nHistology and imaging\nAs pathology was evident at six months of age, for histological assessment, mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with saline and 4% paraformaldehyde at an early (5 months; control n = 4; mutant n = 6) and severe time point (9 months of age; behavioral mice). Brains and spinal cords were harvested, post-fixed overnight, cryoprotected, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until cryostat sectioning at 20 \u03bcm. For immunohistochemistry, sections were blocked (10% normal serum, 0.3% Triton-X in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature prior to overnight incubation with IBA1 (1:1000 in PBS; DAKO, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) or CD68 primary (1:250 in PBS, conjugated Alexa Fluor\u00ae 647; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) at 4\u00b0C. On day 2, secondary incubation lasted 1 h at room temperature using goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 488 secondary (1:500 in PBS). Sections were rinsed, incubated with Hoescht dye (1:3000) for 3 minutes, rinsed, and coverslipped. Similarly, fluoromyelin red (FMR; Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) was performed on adjacent sections according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Tissue was imaged using a Zeiss LSM 700 Confocal or a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 microscope operating AxioVision 4.8.2 (Zeiss; Oberkochen, Germany). Z-stacks of four 1 \u03bcm thick images were compressed and analyzed using FIJI (ImageJ 1.52h; National Institutes of Health, USA).\n\nElectron Microscopy\nA second cohort of control (n=4) and 3 mutant (n=3) mice were perfused for electron microscopy (EM) at nine months of age. Because myelin fixation has traditionally proven difficult to achieve at the ultrastructural level, a novel combination buffer system (involving reduced osmium;\nLangford and Coggeshall, 1980\n) was used here to achieve near perfect myelin preservation. Mice were perfused with a solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde (freshly prepared from EM grade prill), 50 mM sodium cacodylate, 50 mM phosphate (Sorenson\u2019s), 3 mM MgCl2, pH 7.2 at 1085 mOmols. Brains were then removed, and the corpus callosum was isolated and placed in fresh fixative overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The following steps were kept cold (4 \u00b0C) until the 70% ethanol step, then run at room temperature. Samples were rinsed in 75 mM cacodylate, 75 mM phosphate, 3.5% sucrose, 3mM MgCl2, pH 7.2 at 430 mOsmols for 45 min, microwaved (50% power, 10 sec. pulse-20 sec. pause-10 sec. pulse in a Pelco laboratory grade microwave model 3400), and post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide reduced with 1.6% potassium ferrocyanide in the same buffer without sucrose, then placed on ice in the dark for 2 hours. Samples were then rinsed in 100 mM maleate buffer with 3.5% sucrose pH 6.2, en-bloc stained for 1 hour with filtered 2% uranyl acetate in maleate sucrose buffer, pH 6.2. Following en-bloc staining, samples were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol to 100%, transferred through propylene oxide, embedded in Eponate 12 (Pella) and cured at 60 \u00b0C for two days.\nSections were cut on a Reichert Ultracut E microtome with a Diatome Diamond knife (45 degree). 60 nm sections were picked up on formvar coated 1 \u00d7 2 mm copper slot grids and stained with methanolic uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate. Grids were viewed on a Hitachi 7600 TEM operating at 80 kV and digital images captured with an XR50 5 megapixel CCD by AMT.\n\nRNAseq\nTo better understand the mechanisms contributing to the observed deficits, a third cohort of control (n=6) and mutant (n=7) male mice were saline perfused at 16 weeks old and cortices were dissected frozen and analyzed using RNAseq. This time point was selected as it just precedes both a behavioral phenotype and cellular/morphological changes in the cortex and may offer early insights into the pathogenic processes. RNA was isolated from tissue samples with a Qiagen RNeasy Lipid kit. RNA quality and concentration were assayed with a Fragment Analyzer instrument. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Poly A (Unique Dual Index) RNA kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Libraries were sequenced on one lane of an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument. Alignment to the mouse transcriptome was performed with the STAR aligner (\nDobin et al., 2013\n) and quantification of transcript abundances in units of Transcript Per Million (TPM) units was performed with MMSEQ (\nTurro et al., 2011\n). Differential expression analysis between the genotypes was performed with MMDIFF (\nTurro et al., 2014\n). A threshold for confidence was set to exclude genes with fewer than 50 average reads, and resultant fold change of gene expression was determined relative to control littermates. Pathway analyses were completed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Qiagen) version 46901286. Top pathways were visualized for expression differences and consistency among transcripts that were up- or down-regulated.\nRNAseq data were validated with RT-PCR using a separate cohort of four control and four mutant mice. Male and female mice were aged at 9 months and showing signs of pathology. Cortices were again dissected frozen to look for upregulation and confirmation of highly changed genes detected by RNAseq. RNA was extracted using RNeasy isolation kits (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and single stranded cDNA was generated using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher). cDNA was diluted and expression of\nCst7\n(forward\nGGAGCTGTACTTGCCGAGC\n; reverse\nCATGGGTGTCAGAAGTTAGGC\n),\nCtsc\n(forward\nCAACTGCACCTACCCTGATCT\n; reverse\nTAAAATGCCCGGAATTGCCCA\n),\nMhcII\n(forward\nAGCCCCATCACTGTGGAGT\n; reverse\nGATGCCGCTCAACATCTTGC\n),\nIba1\n(forward\nATCAACAAGCAATTCCTCGATGA\n; reverse\nCAGCATTCGCTTCAAGGACATA\n),\nCd68\n(forward\nTGTCTGATCTTGCTAGGACCG\n; reverse\nGAGAGTAACGGCCTTTTTGTGA\n), and\nPpia\nforward\nGAGCTGTTTGCAGACAAAGTTC\n; reverse\nCCCTGGCACATGAATCCTGG\n) were measured using a BioRad CFX384 system. Results were quantified using the 2\n\u2212\u0394\u0394CT\nmethod, standardized to\nPpia\nand normalized to control expression.\n\nData Analysis\nBehavioral and histological analyses were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with genotype and time as factors. EM and rt-pcr results were averaged by group and compared by student\u2019s t-test. For RNAseq expression data, fold-change and significance were calculated relative to control expression using MMDIFF. Pathway significance was determined by IPA. Statistics were completed using SPSS version 25. Graphs are depicted as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) and findings were considered significant when\np\n\u2264 0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Health & Science Center and were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Young C57Bl/6 male mice (8-10 weeks) and aged mice (18-20 months) from Charles River were used for this study. Animals were aged in house to control for dietary factors. Food and water were provided\nad libitum\n.\n\nAnimal Cohort\nCohort 1:\nTo investigate the acute effects of age and stroke on central and peripheral CD4 cytokine/chemokine levels (CXCL10, IFN-y), young (n=14) and aged (n=14) mice underwent ischemia or sham surgery and were euthanized 72 hours following. Brain and plasma IP-10 levels were measured.\nCohort 2:\nTo investigate the effects of transient CD4 T depletion on post-stroke recovery in aged male and female mice (n=20 male & 11 females) were randomly assigned to receive anti-CD4 antibody or IgG isotype control on days 3 and 4 post-stroke. Mice were euthanized on day 7 following behavioral assessments. Brain and plasma were collected for infarct analysis and cytokine measurement.\n\nMiddle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo)\nThe MCAo model was used in young and aged mice as described previously (\nHarris et al., 2016\n). In brief, transient focal ischemia was induced under isoflurane anesthesia by occlusion of right MCA; the filament was not inserted into the MCA for sham mice. The suture diameter was 0.21mm for young mice and 0.23mm diameter for aged animals with a silicone coated tip at a length 5-6 mm. The MCA was occluded for 60 minutes, followed by reperfusion in both young and aged mice. All studies were performed blinded and animals were randomly assigned to stroke/sham and treatment group by computer generated block randomization.\n\nCD4\n+\nT cell depletion\nMice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 5mg/kg of an anti-CD4 depletion antibody (clone GK 1.5, eBioscience, San Diego, CA) or IgG isotype control (BD Biosciences PharMingen). The dose was based on prior literature that found that i.p. injection of this antibody (0.2mg/kg/day on 2 consecutive days and 5mg/kg a week apart) leads to depletion of CD4 T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood in mice (\nMochimaru et al., 2008\n). In order to ensure adequate depletion, we administered 5mg/kg on days 3 and 4 following stroke, at a time of high parenchymal T cell infiltration. CD4 T cell depletion was confirmed by flow cytometry using an anti-CD4 clone (RM4-5) (\nSupplementary figure 2\n).\n\nBehavioral testing and Infarct analysis:\nBehavioral testing and analysis were performed by a blinded investigator on day 7 following MCAo. Details of procedures including infarct analysis are provided in\nsupplementary methods\n.\n\nCytokine Measurement\nBlood was obtained from anesthetized mice via cardiac puncture and collected into heparinized tubes. Blood was spun at 500 RCF for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C, and the plasma supernatant was removed. Plasma was stored frozen (\u221280\u00b0C) until assay. Plasma levels were assessed per manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Bio-Plex Pro Mouse Cytokine 23-Plex Immunoassay BioRad, Hercules, CA and Mouse IP-10 Platinum ELISA, eBioscience Inc., San Diego, CA).\n\nOutcome Measures\nFor the human group and animal cohort one, the primary objective was to determine the impact of age and stroke on levels of pro-inflammatory IP-10. For animal cohort two, the primary objective was to examine the impact of CD4+ T cell depletion on post-stroke recovery, including infarct size, behavioral outcomes, and circulating IP-10 levels. We also examined the impact of depleting CD4 cells on other inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, utilizing a 23-multiplex.\n\nStatistics\nData are expressed as mean \u00b1SD except for the NDS where the interquartile range is provided (Mann-Whitney). Two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare variables between different groups. Two-way ANOVA or a general linear model was used depending on whether the number of mice in each category was equal, followed by post-hoc tests adjusted by Tukey method. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 7."

    "Methods": "Animals and EEG Electrode Implantation\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (N=26: Standard EM N=12; IM Gold N=6; Ephys N=8) (Charles River Laboratories, Raleigh, NC) were used in this study. Given the labor-intensive nature of acquiring and analyzing electron microscopy data, and to limit biological variability, only male animals were used in the present study. Animals were housed in individual cages in a temperature controlled room (70\u201374\u00b0F) with a 12h light/12h dark cycle, and had\nad libitum\naccess to food and water for the entire study. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Rats (216\u2013281 g) were implanted with EEG electrodes as follows. After anesthetization with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg ketamine (ip) and 12.5 mg/kg xylazine (ip)), animals were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. A bipolar (with ground) electrode (MS333\u20133-B, Plastics One, Roanoke, VA) was used for surface recordings (\nThomson and H. S. White, 2014\n). Two holes were drilled on the right side of the midline, and one lead was placed into each of the craniotomies to provide differential recordings. A third lead was placed in a third craniotomy left of the midline to be used as the ground electrode. Three additional holes were drilled in the surrounding space and screws were fashioned. The electrodes were fixed in place with dental cement, and the skin was sutured around the skull.\n\nvEEG recording\nRats were permitted six days to recover from surgery before being placed into a video-EEG (vEEG) suite, and monitored 24/7 using vEEG for the duration of the experimental trial. Animals were tethered to a rotating commutator (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA) which in-turn was connected to an EEG100C amplifier. EEG recordings were obtained at a frequency band of 1\u201350 Hz, and sampled at 100 Hz/channel using a BioPac MP150 Recording system (BioPac Systems Inc., Goleta, CA) and Acknowledge Software. Video was captured by a pair of DVP 7020BE Capture cards (Advantech, Milpitas, CA). Video and EEG data were synchronized and written to disk using custom software (\nThomson and H. S. White, 2014\n). Video was stored in MPEG4 format, and EEG was stored in a custom file format.\n\nInduction of SE and EEG review\nAfter a 24 hour acclimation period inside the video-EEG chambers, SE was induced using the repeated low-dose systemic KA protocol as previously described (\nHellier et al., 1998\n;\nRobel and Sontheimer, 2016\n;\nSmith et al., 2007\n;\nTakahashi et al., 2010\n;\nToyoda et al., 2013\n). This protocol results in the development of epilepsy in greater than 90% of the animals that experienced SE (\nHellier et al., 1998\n), (\nThomson et al., 2017\n). KA (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol) was dissolved for 1 hour in sterile isotonic saline prior to first injection. Rats received an initial 10 mg/kg injection of KA, followed by a 5 mg/kg injection an hour after. Animals continued to receive 5 mg/kg injections every 30 minutes until the first Racine stage 5 seizure was observed (\nRacine, 1972\n). Sham-treated animals (Standard EM N=4; IM Gold N=3; Ephys N=2) received an equivalent number of injections with 0.9% saline. All animals were observed for behavioral seizures and EEG data captured with synchronized video recording. Video EEG monitoring was performed 24 hrs per day for 7 days until rats were sacrificed for either the EM component of the study or the electrophysiology study. An experimenter blinded to the treatment paradigm reviewed video EEG files for spontaneous recurrent seizures and any rats that displayed seizure activity 24 hrs after the initial KA-induced SE activity were eliminated from the study. In the KA treated groups, only animals displaying SE were included in the study.\n\nTissue Preparation\nAt 7 days following the induction of SE, rats were anesthetized using pentobarbital. The CNS was fixed following transcardial perfusion according to the following conditions:\n\nFor Conventional Electron Microscopy Analysis:\nRoom temperature 0.1 M Phosphate buffer (PB) (pH = 7.2) was perfused for ~90 seconds prior to perfusion of fixative solution consisting of 3% PFA and 1.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M PB. After perfusion with fixative for 30 minutes, the rat was decapitated and the head was kept on ice for 30 minutes. The brain was then dissected and postfixed overnight in the same fixative solution at 4\u00b0. Brains were then transferred to 0.1 M PB and shipped overnight on cold packs to the University of Pittsburgh for processing for EM. A total of 5 brains (2 shams and 3 KA) were used for the morphometric analysis of astrocyte perisynaptic processes and Schaffer collaterals synapses on CA1 spines after 3D reconstructions.\nCoronal brain slices (100-\u03bcm thick) were vibratome-sectioned in an ice-cold solution (0.15 M cacodylate buffer and 2 mM calcium chloride). Slices were washed with the same solution and then incubated in a solution containing 3% potassium ferrocyanide in 0.3 M cacodylate buffer with 4 mM calcium chloride and 4% aqueous osmium tetroxide. Tissues were washed with ddH\n2\nO and incubated in a filtered thiocarbohydrazide solution. After this incubation, sections were washed with ddH\n2\nO and placed in a 2% osmium tetroxide solution in ddH\n2\nO. Sections were washed with ddH\n2\n0 and then placed overnight in 1% uranyl acetate. Sections were stained en bloc using Walton\u2019s lead aspartate solution (\nWalton, 1979\n). After several washes in ddH\n2\nO, sections were dehydrated in an ethanol series (50%, 70%, 85%, 95%, and 100%), infiltrated with epoxy resin (EMbed-812; Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA, USA), and embedded between acetate sheets. Sections were placed in an oven at 60 \u00b0C for 48 hours to polymerize (\nClarkson et al., 2016\n).\n\nMorphometric analyses of perisynaptic astrocytes and stratum radiatum CA1 synapses\nTo determine the changes of reactive astrocytes after KA treatment we characterized the ultrastructure of astrocytes and their relation to CA1 neurons in sham and KA treated rats. Using 3D reconstructions from images after serial ultrathin sections we determined the percentage of astrocyte enwrapping around CA1 excitatory synapses and investigated ultrastructural changes at presynaptic endings and postsynaptic spines that might indicate changes in normal excitatory transmission.\nFollowing polymerization, the CA1 region was trimmed and block-mounted. Serial ultrathin sections (60\u201370 nm) were cut with a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems) and collected on formvar-coated single slot grids. The electron micrographs for the astrocytes processes, presynaptic terminal and spine 3D-reconsturctions were taken at 25,000X. A total of 449 serial ultrathin sections were analyzed (Shams: n= 206; KA n= 243) from sham rats (n=2) and KA treated rats (n=3). Sets of approximately 20 serial ultrathin sections were used per spine. Each set covered the entire PSD and most of the CA1 spine head receiving CA3 Schaffer collaterals. Spines were randomly selected within the middle regions of the Stratum Radiatum. Serial ultrathin sections were observed with a JEOL 1400 TEM (JEOL Ltd., Akishima Tokyo, Japan). A total of 60 3D reconstructions were performed in sham treated (n=2) and KA treated rats (n=3) (shams: n = 24 spines and KA: n = 36 spines, 12 per animal). Astroglial cells and their processes enwrapping Schaffer collateral synapses on CA1 spines were identified by their irregular shapes interdigitating among neuronal processes and by the presence of glycogen granules, intermediary filament bundles, and a relatively clear cytoplasm (\nMatsui et al., 2005\n). Three-dimensional reconstructions were made by alignment of serial electron micrographs of astrocyte processes within the neuropil of CA1 (Reconstruct software; Fiala, 2005) as previously described (\nG\u00f3mez-Nieto and Rubio, 2009\n;\nTran et al., 2009\n). In brief, two successive sections were aligned via rotation and translation such that corresponding structures like mitochondria in the two sections superimposed. To compensate for distortions introduced by the sectioning, we had to transform the images linearly. Alignment was followed by a contouring of membranes by visually defining markers of different colors. The subsequent linear interpolation between these markers resulted in a polygonal outline membrane. The three-dimensional rendering was generated as VRML files from the stacks of all contoured sections. By filling these stacks with tetrahedra, we calculated volumes and surface areas of the structures of interest.\n\nMorphometric analysis of CA1 synapses\nIn single images (at x60,000 magnification) in which the pre-synaptic membrane was found parallel to the post-synaptic plasma membrane, we analyzed the thickness of the PSDs as previously described (\nDosemeci et al., 2001\n;\nRubio, 2006\n), using ImageJ software (\nrsbweb.nih.gov/ij/\n).\nWe also used RECONSTRUCT software as above, to create 3D reconstructions from serial section electron micrographs at x60,000 magnification of PSDs and the docked synaptic vesicles within 50 nm of the pre-synaptic plasma membrane of CA1 spines receiving Schaffer collaterals. A total of 60 3D reconstructions were performed from sham treated (n=2) and KA-treated rats (n=3) (shams: n = 24 PSDs and KA: n = 36 PSDs, approximately 12 per animal). We reconstructed those vesicles that were embedded in the synaptic active zone, which included synaptic vesicles up to 33 nm away from the pre-synaptic plasma membrane. Canvas software (ACD system, Texas, USA) was used to calculate the area of the reconstructed PSDs and to quantify the number of docked synaptic vesicles.\n\nFreeze-substitution and postembedding immunogold labeling for GLT-1 and AMPARs\nTo determine the expression of the glutamate transporter protein, GLT-1, in astrocyte processes enwrapping CA1 excitatory synapses and AMPA receptors at the PSD of CA1 spines, we used the postembedding immunogold labeling after freeze-substitution technique, as previously described (\nDouyard et al., 2007\n;\nRubio and Wenthold, 1997\n;\nWhiting et al., 2009\n). A total of 6 brains were used (sham n = 3; KA n = 3). Paired sham and experimental animals were used for transcardial perfusions, tissue preparation, freeze substitution, and postembedding immunogold labeling. Briefly, low glutaraldehyde fixative was used for freeze substitution; animals were perfused with a solution that contained 4% PFA and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.12 M PB, pH = 7.2. Brains were immediately dissected and postfixed for 90 minutes in cold 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.12 M PB. Brains were transferred to cold 0.12M PB and shipped overnight on cold packs to the University of Pittsburgh.\nThe brains were vibratome-sectioned (200-\u03bcm thickness) and cryoprotected in ascending battery of glycerol (10%, 20% and 30%) in 0.12 M PB, pH = 7.2. The hippocampus was dissected and processed first for high-speed plunged immersion freezing in propane (Leica EM CPC unit, Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria) and after for freeze-substitution/ low temperature embedding techniques (Leica EM AFS unit). For GLT-1 and GluA1, GluA2 and GluA2/3 postembedding immunogold labeling, a protocol similar to those described by (\nClarkson et al., 2016\n;\nDouyard et al., 2007\n;\nRubio and Wenthold, 1997\n) was used. Briefly, ultrathin sections (100-nm thickness) on nickel grids were incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature (RT) in sodium borohydride and glycine in 0.01M Tris-buffered saline solution with Triton X-100 (TBST). After being preblocked with 5% normal goat serum (NGS) for 10 minutes, the sections were incubated with an affinity purified polyclonal rabbit antibody (1:75 dilution) against the C-terminus of GLT-1 (Dr. Jeffrey D. Rothstein, Johns Hopkins University) or with affinity purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies (1:100 dilution) against the C-terminus of GluA1, GluA2 or GluA2/3 (Dr. Robert Wenthold, NIDCD/NIH) in TBST containing 1% NGS for 2 hours at RT. These antibodies have been previously characterized with respect to its specificity and localization in the brain (\nDouyard et al., 2007\n;\nRothstein et al., 1994\n;\nRubio and Wenthold, 1997\n). Sections were briefly washed x3 times in TBST containing 1% NGS. The primary antibody was recognized with an anti-rabbit IgG gold-conjugated (10-nm diameter) secondary antibody (Ted Pella, Redding, CA, USA) containing 1% NGS and polyethylene glycol (5 mg/ml) in TBST for 1 hour. Sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and analyzed with a transmission electron microscope.\nControl experiments, in which the rabbit GluA1, GluA2, GluA2/3 and GLT1 antibodies were incubated with anti-mouse secondary antibodies, showed no immunoreactive labeling.\nOnly astrocyte profiles surrounding the CA1 Schafer collateral endings on spines and with a well-preserved cell membrane were included in the analysis. In electron micrographs at 60,000x from single ultrathin sections, we calculated the number and density of GLT-1-labeled gold particles in the membrane of astrocyte processes enwrapping Schafer collateral endings and the number and linear density of gold particles on the PSDs of CA1 spines of shams and KA-treated rats. The area of astrocyte profiles or the length of the PSD were measured with ImageJ software, and the number of gold particles was manually counted. The number and density of gold particles for GLT-1 or for the AMPAR subunits were not different among the animals analyzed within each of the groups (sham, KA).\n\nStatistical analysis for electron microscopic analysis\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using Prism 5.0d software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA). No significant difference in the morphometric analyses or immunogold labeling for each specific antibody was found between the animals in the sham group (Mann Whitney U,\nP\n> 0.05). There was also no significant difference in the morphometric analyses or immunogold labeling for each specific antibody between the animals in the KA group (Mann Whitney U test,\nP\n> 0.05; ANOVA,\nP\n> 0.05). Therefore, we were able to used pooled results to compare the sham group to the experimental group. To analyze changes in immunogold labeling between shams and KA treated animals, we used a normality test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) followed by one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests with Dunn\u2019s post-hoc comparisons. Comparisons between the two groups were conducted with an unpaired t test or a Mann-Whitney U test. All values are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM; for all comparisons, the level of significance was fixed at 0.05.\n\nBrain slice recording\nThe rats used for electrophysiology all underwent surgical placement of cortical EEG electrodes (n=8). Rats previously administered the injections of KA, as well as vehicle treated sham rats, were monitored using video EEG as described above to ensure the induction of SE in animals treated with KA, the subsequent absence of spontaneous seizures, and to confirm that the rodents were still in the latent period. Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (Nembutal) (25 mg/kg) and decapitated. The brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold sucrose Ringer\u2019s solution bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2 and containing (in millimolar): 124 sucrose, 3 KCl, 1.2 NaPO4, 2 MgSO4, 6 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, and 2 CaCl2. For all external solutions, the pH was between 7.34 and 7.36, and the osmolality was 295\u2013305 mOsm. Brains were blocked and glued caudal side down on a chuck, and coronal slices 400 \u03bcm thick were cut using a Vibratome slicer (Vibratome, St. Louis, MO). Brain slices were placed in an incubation chamber at room temperature containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) consisting of (in millimolar) 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.2 Na2PO4, 10 glucose, 6 NaHCO3, 2.0 MgCl2, and 2.0 CaCl2.\nFor recording, slices were placed in a submersion chamber and constantly perfused at between 29 to 30 C\u00b0 (1\u20132 ml/min) with oxygenated Ringer\u2019s solution. The whole-cell patch clamp technique was used to record from pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region. A microscope equipped with Nomarski optics and infrared illumination was used to visualize the slice and position the electrode above the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Borosilicate patch electrodes (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) were pulled to 2.0\u20133.0-M\u03a9 resistances when measured in Ringer\u2019s solution using a micropipette electrode puller (Heka, Novato, CA). Miniature EPSCs were recorded with a cesium-based internal solution composed of (in millimolar): 80 CsMeSO\n4\n, 60 CsCl, 10 Hepes, 1 EGTA/CsOH, 0.5 CaCl\n2\n, 2 ATP, 0.5 GTP, 12.5 glucose, and 2.6 lidocaine N-ethyl bromide (QX-314; Sigma). Whole-cell recordings were obtained using a MultiClamp 700 A amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Signals in voltage-clamp mode were acquired at 20 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz for off-line analysis using MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA) and Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Additionally, only recordings that did not exhibit substantial changes (<20%) in either holding current or input resistance after 20 min of time, allowing for the internal pipette solution to equilibrate with the neuron, were included in the study. Positive and negative current injections of 500 ms length were used to assess blockage of action potentials by QX314 and the diffusion of cesium into the neuron and subsequent changes in membrane resistance. Spontaneous and miniature EPSCs were recorded in voltage clamp with a holding potential of \u221270 mV. Pipette offset was zeroed in the bath solution. EPSCs were isolated by the bath application of 50 \u03bcM picrotoxin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for a minimum of 20 min. Recordings of mEPSCs were performed after 10 min of perfusion with ACSF containing 1 \u03bcM tetrodotoxin (TTX, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Identification and measurement of EPSCs were performed using Axograph X (Berkeley, CA). The threshold for event detection was set at three times baseline root- mean-square noise as previously described (\nSmeal et al., 2012\n).\n\nStatistics used for electrophysiology data\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using Prism 5.0c (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA) and Matlab 2013a software (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Comparisons of averages were done with an unpaired t-test and cumulative distributions were tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nAll animal protocols were conducted under National Institutes Health\n(NIH) Guidelines using the NIH handbook\nAnimals in Research\nand\nwere approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (University of\nCincinnati). The mice were housed in the animal facility of University of\nCincinnati on a 12-h light/dark diurnal cycle. Food was provided ad libitum. To\nevaluate neurogenesis in stroke mice, the nestin-CreERT2-R26R-YFP strain was\nused in this study. The generation and characterization of animals used in this\nstudy were previously described (\nLagace et al.,\n2007\n;\nJin et al., 2015\n).\n\n2.2. Murine model of transient focal ischemia\nTransient MCAo was induced in C57BL/6 or Nestin-CreERT2-YFP mice (C57BL/6\ncongenic background, 10\u201312 week old) mice as described (\nLonga et al., 1989\n). Transient MCAo was induced by an\nintraluminal suture method. Mice were anesthetized with\nisoflurane\nand a midline neck\nincision\nwas made to expose the\nright common carotid artery\n(rCCA). The\nisolated rCCA was temporarily ligated with a silk suture during whole period of\nocclusion. The right\nexternal carotid artery\n(rECA), and the right\ninternal carotid artery\n(rICA) were also\nisolated by dissection of\nfascia\n. The rICA was clamped with an artery\nclamp above a loose suture tie around rICA. The rECA was ligated and cut to make\na rECA stump. A nylon filament suture with a silicone rubber-coated tip\n(#602212PK10Re, Doccol co, Sharon, MA, USA) was inserted in rECA stump and\nfurther pushed along the lumen of ICA while the clamp was released and then the\ntie around rICA was tightened. After 45 min of occlusion, the nylon suture was\ngently removed from rMCA to reperfuse the rMCA territory. The rECA stump was\npermanently ligated and the temporary\nligation\nin rCCA and rICA were removed to\nallow normal blood flow to the brain. During the surgery, mice were placed above\na temperature-controlled heating blanket and after the 45 min occlusion, the\nskin wound was closed with suture and the mice were placed in a heated animal\nintensive care unit chamber until recovery. To ensure consistent and successful\nblockage of MCA, we monitored\nischemia\nin all of our animals by\nLaser Doppler flowmetry\n(PeriFlux System\n5000, Perimed,\nJ\u00e4rf\u00e4lla-Stockholm\n, Sweden).\n\n2.3. Cortical ischemia model (distal MCA occlusion)\nFocal\ncerebral ischemia\nwas produced in the mice as\ndescribed in detail previously (\nShen et al.,\n2008\n;\nLuo et al., 2009\n). The\nmice were anesthetized with\nchloral hydrate\n(0.4 g/kg, intraperitoneally\n[IP]). Body temperature was monitored and maintained at 37 \u00b0C by a\nheating pad. The surgical area was shaved and prepared with alternating\nbetadine\nscrub and ethanol. A small 5-mm\nvertical\nskin incision\nwas cut between the right eye\nand ear to expose the skull. A\ncraniotomy\nof about 1 \u00d7 1\nmm\n2\nwas made in the right squamosal bone to expose the middle\ncerebral artery (MCA). The MCA was ligated with 10\u20130 suture for 90 min\nfollowed by removal of the ligating suture at right CCA to allow for partial\nreperfusion\n. The skin wound was closed with\nsuture and the mice were placed in a heated animal intensive care unit chamber\nuntil recovery. After recovery from the anesthesia, body temperature was\nmaintained at 37 \u00b0C using a temperature-controlled incubator.\n\n2.4. Tamoxifen administration\nMale nestin-CreERT2-R26R-YFP mice (8\u201310 weeks old) were given\ntamoxifen (TAM) dissolved in 10% EtOH/90%\nsunflower oil\nby gavage feeding at a dose of\n180 mg/kg daily for 5 consecutive days. This dosing regimen was previously\ndemonstrated to provide maximal recombination with minimal mortality and\nsuccessfully monitored the activated SVZ\nNSCs\nby stroke (\nLagace et al., 2007\n;\nJin et al., 2015\n;\nLi et al.,\n2010\n). For NSC fate mapping, TAM treated mice received MCAo surgery\n10 days after the last TAM administration and mice were perfused at 42 days post\nstroke to harvest the brain for\nimmunostaining\n. The time frame was chosen to\nspecifically label NSCs in adult mice before the introduction of MCAo but also\nallow the clearance of TAM from mice at the time of MCAo to prevent labeling of\nreactive\nastrocytes\nwhich also upregulate\nnestin\nexpression after stroke.\n\n2.5. Transient demyelination by cuprizone treatment\nAdult male C57BL/6 mice (sham or 1 week after stroke) at about 12 weeks\nof age were fed with 0.2% cuprizone (TD.140800, ENVIGO) for 5 weeks. Starting at\n3th weeks, substantial\ndemyelination\nin the\ncorpus callosum\ncan be observed (\nMatsushima and Morell, 2001\n). Demyelination\nreaches a maximum at 5 weeks (\nSteelman et al.,\n2012\n;\nGudi et al., 2009\n)\n\n2.6. Behavioral assay\nLocomotor function: Animals were placed in an Accuscan activity monitor\n(Columbus, OH, USA) before and at various days after MCAo for behavioral\nrecording for 1 h as previously described (\nLuo\net al., 2009\n). The monitor contained 16 horizontal and 8 vertical\ninfrared sensors spaced 2.5 cm apart. Each animal was placed in a 42 \u00d7 42\n\u00d7 31 cm Plexiglas open box for 60 min. Motor activity was calculated\nusing the automated Versamax software (Accuscan, Columbus, OH, USA). The\nfollowing variables were measured to assess both horizontal movement and\nvertical movement: (A) total distance traveled (the distance, in centimeters,\ntraveled by the animals), (B) Vertical activity (the total number of beam\ninterruptions that occurred in the vertical sensors). This behavioral test is\nautomatically monitored by the computer and software therefore avoided observer\nbias.\n\n2.7. Adhesive removal test\nTo examine sensorimotor deficits, the adhesive removal test was performed\non the indicated days in pre-stroke or post-stroke animals. Each mouse was\nplaced into transparent cylinder (15 cm diameter) during a habituation period of\n1 min. Thereafter, two different colored adhesive labels (2.5 mm diameter made\nby punch, Tough Spots) were applied with equal pressure on each mouse\u2019s\nforepaw. The mouse was recorded in the cylinder and scored later by observers\nblinded to the treatment. The time to remove the adhesive labels was scored with\na maximum of 2 min. To achieve an optimum level of performance, mice were\ntrained for 4 days before surgery to establish baseline performance.\n\n2.8. Cylinder test\nThe\nCylinder test\nwas used to evaluate locomotor\nasymmetry in rodent models of stroke. As the animal moves within an open-top,\nclear plastic cylinder, its\nforelimb\nactivity while rearing against the\nwall of the arena is recorded. Forelimb use is defined by the placement of the\nwhole palm on the wall of the arena, which indicates its use for body support.\nForelimb contacts while rearing are scored with a total of 20 contacts recorded\nfor each animal. The number of impaired and non-impaired forelimb contacts are\ncalculated as a percentage of total contacts.\n\n2.9. MRI method\nImaging session was carried out at 2 days after stroke by staff that\nwere blinded to the treatment groups. MRI studies were performed on a horizontal\nBruker 9.4 T scanner with a 3-cm birdcage coil. Multi-slice,\nT\n2\n-weighted, axial images were acquired using a rapid acquisition\nwith relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence(\nHennig et al., 1986\n) to quantify ischemic edema volume. Imaging\nparameters were: TE/TR, 15/2000 ms; RARE factor, 8; NAV, 4; matrix size, 256\n\u00d7 256; slice thickness, 1 mm; number of slices, 13; field of view (FOV),\n2.4 \u00d7 2.4 cm. Image reconstruction and analysis were performed offline\nusing in-house developed, MATLAB-based (Natick, MA, USA) software. ROIs of\nischemic edema volume and brain tissue were drawn from T\n2\n-weighted\nimages. Consequently, the percentage of ischemic edema volume was\ncalculated.\n\n2.10. Luxol fast blue staining\nTo examine demyelination in cuprizone treatment mice, brain cryosections\n(30um) were mounted on Superfrost Plus slides and stained with 0.1% luxol fast\nblue solution (#26681\u201301,\nElectron Microscopy\nSciences) in 56 \u00b0C\noven overnight. Sections were then rinsed sequentially in 95% ethanol, water and\n0.05%\nlithium carbonate\nsolution (#26681\u201304,\nElectron Microscopy Sciences) until the white matter sharply defined. When\ndifferentiation is complete, cryosections were dehydrated in 100% ethanol,\ncleared in\nxylene\nand mounted with cytoseal 60 mounting\nmedium.\n\n2.11. Immunohistochemistry\nAt different time points after stroke, mice were perfused transcardially\nwith a solution of 4%\nparaformaldehyde\n(PFA, pH 7.2) in 0.1 M\nphosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.2). Brains were removed from the skull, post-fixed in\n4% PFA overnight at 4 \u00b0C, and sequentially transferred to 20% and 30%\nsucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 solutions overnight. Brains were\nfrozen on dry ice and sectioned on a\ncryostat\nto obtain coronal sections of 30\n\u03bcm in thickness.\nThe sections were then incubated with blocking buffer for one hour. The\nprimary antibodies were prepared in the blocking buffer and the sections were\nincubated in the solution overnight: anti-GFP (Green fluorescent protein)\n(1:1000; Invitrogen) and anti-DCX (1:500, Millipore). After incubation with\nprimary antibody solution, the sections were washed and incubated for four hours\nat room temperature in diluted secondary antibody prepared with blocking\nsolution (secondary\nantibody conjugated\nwith Alexa 488 or Alexa\n555, 1:1000; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The slides were then washed\nwith PB solution and cover-slipped. Images were acquired using a Leica\nmicroscope. Omission of primary or secondary antibodies resulted in no staining\nand served as negative controls. Group and treatment information are all blinded\nto image analyzer.\n\n2.12. Quantification of SVZ and SGZ neurogenesis and migration\nTo quantify total newly born YFP+ progeny or newly born neuroblasts,\nYFP+ or DCX+ cells are outline with region of interest (ROIs) at the horn or\nwall of SVZ region as illustrated in Fig. 5A. Immunoreactive positive signals\nwere analyzed by Nikon NIS-Elements software (Tokyo, Japan) on at least three\nsections at equivalent coronal positions in each animal. To quantify for the\nmigration of YFP+ or DCX+ cells, the distance of YFP+ or DCX+ migrated from the\nhorn of the SVZ was measured using NIS-Element software on the same three brain\nsections for each animal. To analyze the neurogenesis at SGZ in\nhippocampus\n, YFP+ cells were counted on at\nleast three sections that contains similar coronal position of SGZ regions. DCX+\nimmunoreactivity\nwas quantified using\nNIS-Element software on the same three sections for each animal. The\nquantification results were averaged for each animal from the measured sections\nand used as a single data point for statistical analysis. All of the images were\nanalyzed by observers blinded to the treatment group.\n\n2.13. SVZ and SGZ neural stem cell 3D neurosphere growth assay\nPrimary\nstem cell cultures\nwere obtained from\nC57BL/6J mice at 4\u20136 weeks of age from the SVZ and SGZ as described\n(\nTurcato et al., 2018\n;\nGuo et al., 2012\n). Whole brains were\nharvested and dissected under microscope to obtain the subventricular zone (SVZ)\nand SGZ tissue. After mechanical dissociation with a stab knife, the tissue\nfragments were processed using\ntrypsin\nand resuspended as individual cells\nat a density of 10\n4\ncells/cm\n2\nin neurobasal media with\ngrowth factors EGF and bFGF (NBM-GF). Subsequent passaging of cells was\nperformed using Accutase (Innovative #AT-104) every 7 days until the cells\nestablished viable lines, and cellular debris was naturally diminished after\neach passage. At day 4 of each passage, the proliferating spheres were fed with\nNBM-GF. We used NSCs at passage P3-P8 in this study. After dissociation the\nneurospheres during passaging, individual cells were plated at a density of 3\n\u00d7 10(\nMendez et al., 2018\n)\ncells/well in a round bottom 96-well plate in 100uL of NBM-GF with vehicle or\ndifferent concentrations of cuprizone treatment. After 48 h of\nneurosphere\naggregation, neurospheres were\ntreated with different concentrations of cuprizone or vehicle. On day 7, images\nof each well were taken using Evos M5000 microscope (ThermoFisher Scientific). 8\nreplicate wells were quantified for each condition and the radius of the\nneurospheres were measured using Nikon NIS Element software (Nikon). Three\nreplicating experiments showed similar results.\n\n2.14. Statistics\nResults are expressed by mean \u00b1 SEM of the indicated number of\nexperiments. Statistical analysis was performed using Student\u2019s\nt\n-test, and one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA),\nas appropriate, with Student-Newman-Keuls\npost hoc tests\nor Bonferroni post-hoc tests\nfor repeated behavioral measurements. A\np\n-value equal to or\n<0.05 was considered significant. Number of animals used in each\nexperiments are indicated in figure legends."

    "Methods": "Ethical Approval\nThe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Dartmouth College approved all surgical and experimental protocols. We included both male and female Sprague-Dawley rat pups ranging in age from post-natal day 8 (P8) to P24 in all sets of experiments.\n\nIntrauterine hypoxia\nWe placed Sprague-Dawley pregnant dams carrying fetuses between embryonic age day 4 and day 6 (e4-e6) into either a chamber supplied with normal room air (RA) oxygen levels (21%) or a chamber that we intermittently made hypoxic (IH). The IH chamber was equipped with oxygen sensors, nitrogen and oxygen gas supply lines, and mixing valves (OxyCycler Model A84, Biospherix, Lacona, NY) under software control (WatView Runtime v. 2.5.63, Watflow Anafaze, Watsonville, CA) designed to allow sensor-driven control over chamber oxygen levels. We generated intermittent hypoxia using software written to alternate one hour of RA with one - hour intermittent hypoxia so that there were 12 hours of IH interleaved with 12 hours of RA (See\nFigure 1\n). During each hour of IH, there were five -minute hypoxic intervals, during which chamber oxygen dropped rapidly to a nadir of 4.5-7.5% oxygen and during the following 5 minutes, chamber oxygen levels returned to 21% oxygen (see\nFigure 1\n). Thus, there were six, 5-minute intervals of hypoxia interleaved with RA in each hour of intermittent hypoxia and 12 hours of this alternating IH interleaved with twelve, one-hour periods of RA. Because the pressure in our nitrogen supply decreased over the course of each hour of hypoxia, the actual nadir of the oxygen concentration became less hypoxic in a relatively linear fashion from ~4.5% fraction inspired oxygen level (FIO\n2\n) at the start of each hypoxia hour to ~7.5% FIO\n2\nduring the final hypoxic interval of each hour (see lower panel in\nFigure 1\n). The control, RA chamber was fed by tubing connected to controllers that opened to allow pressurized air to enter the chamber following a temporal pattern similar to that experienced by animals in the IH chamber so that the noise and gas flows experienced by animals in the IH chamber were identical to those experienced by dams in the control, RA chamber. Dams were kept in the chambers until they delivered and then removed to RA, and postnatal care and development of the rat pups occurred under normoxic conditions. Animals were checked daily in the morning except when a delivery was expected; at which point, we checked the animals twice a day.\nFigure 1:\nOpen in a new tab\nA schematic of the experimental design is shown above (A). Two groups of pregnant dams were exposed either to room air (RA) or intermittent hypoxia (IH) starting at embryological age 4-5 days. Once the rat pups were born (postnatal day 0), the mothers and pups from both treatment groups were removed from the exposure chamber and each litter and mother were placed in RA in a plexiglass cage with appropriate bedding and food and water\nad libitum\n. Pups were selected for LCR testing between P8 and P20. The scheme of IH is shown in panel B. Intermittent hypoxia, nominally 5% FIO\n2\n(red command O\n2\nline), was administered every other 5-minute interval of every other hour 24 hours per day (so alternate hours of intermittent hypoxia or room air) for the duration of the exposure, which started on e4 or e5 of the pregnancy and ended when the rat pups were born (usually an exposure of 17 days). The RA mothers were housed in RA, but adjacent to the hypoxia-exposure chamber and were exposed to the same environmental noises as the solenoids controlling gas entry into the chambers were activated by the sequence of intermittent gas changes. The exposure chambers are large and accommodated 2-3 pregnant dams, but the size of the chamber meant that the time constant of gas exchange was long. Therefore, 5% FIO\n2\nresulted in an approximately exponential fall in the FIO\n2\nwithin the hypoxic chamber, and 5% hypoxia was not consistently reached (blue or yellow actual O\n2\nmeasured by chamber sensors). The inset shows that the nadir of each hypoxic interval was quite brief within each 5 minutes of hypoxia. Moreover, the pressure in the nitrogen supply reservoir decreased over the course of each hour of hypoxia, and therefore, the actual nadir of the oxygen concentration became less hypoxic in a relatively linear fashion from ~4.5% to a value less than 10% in the final hypoxic episode of each hour of IH.\n\nSurgical preparation of rat pups\nWe determined the sex and weight of each pup, and then administered 1.2-1.5 g/kg urethane (U2500, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 10 mg/kg chloralose (C0128, Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.9% saline by intraperitoneal injection. We maintained body temperature at ~34 \u00b0C using a rectal temperature probe (RET-4, Physitemp, Clifton, NJ) connected to a Physitemp TCAT-2 DF servo-controller that regulated a heat lamp positioned over the animal. After each animal reached a surgical plane of anesthesia (lack of withdrawal reflex or significant change in heart or respiratory rate following a toe pinch), we inserted two 30-gauge platinum needle electrodes (FE2M, Grass Technologies, West Warwick, RI) subcutaneously on the left upper chest wall to record electrocardiogram (ECG) activity. We amplified (100X) and filtered (low cutoff 10 Hz, high cutoff 500 Hz) signals from the ECG leads using a DAM-80 AC Differential Amplifier (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). We inserted a second pair of needle electrodes into the intercostal muscles in the region of the ninth through eleventh ribs on the lower right costal margin to monitor respiratory electromyographic (EMG) activity. We secured both electrode pairs with small amounts of cyanoacrylate glue. We amplified (1000X) and filtered (low cutoff 10 Hz, high cutoff 500 Hz, 60 Hz notch) the EMG signals using Iso-DAM8A amplifiers (WPI, Sarasota, FL). We sampled both ECG and EMG signals at 1 kHz using a USB-6009 driven by a custom LabVIEW program (National Instruments, Austin, TX).\nWe placed each animal supine, exposed the trachea and larynx, incised the anterior wall of the trachea circumferentially between adjacent rings of cartilage and placed a polytetrafluoroethylene breathing tube (19-23 gauge) in the caudal segment. We inserted a length of PE-50 tubing into the rostral trachea and advanced it until its tip was near the caudal border of the larynx; this tubing was used to deliver microliter amounts of distilled water via a syringe pump to the larynx to elicit the LCR. We secured both tubes into the trachea using 4-0 silk sutures and cyanoacrylate adhesive. Next, we placed the animal in the prone position on the edge of an elevated platform and secured its head in a ventri-flexed position using surgical tape. We exposed the foramen magnum by removing the skin and bluntly dissecting the overlying muscle tissue. We used the tip of a 32-gauge needle to incise the membranes covering the foramen. This exposed the cerebrospinal fluid and floor of the fourth ventricle to provide access for focal microinjections. We made 50-100 nanoliter, focal injections through fine, pulled glass pipettes using a Picospritzer II (Parker Hannifin, Cleveland, OH). Bilateral microinjections were made just caudal and lateral (within 1 mm in both directions) to the termination of the floor of the fourth ventricle in the medial portion of the gracile nucleus, and unilateral microinjections were made in the midline just caudal to the termination of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The glass pipettes were held in a micromanipulator perpendicular to the surface of the brainstem to allow precise control over the location and depth of microinjection. We microinjected 4 mM 5-HT diluted in normal saline. We used a high dose of 5-HT to try to saturate 5-HT receptors in the medial caudal NTS. All microinjections included 0.02% of fluorescent 0.4 \u03bc diameter carboxylated latex microspheres (Fluoresbrite, PolySciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) for verification of injection locations.\n\nLCR protocol\nAfter opening the foramen magnum, we delivered small volumes of water rostrally into the larynx via syringe pump to elicit the LCR. We started with 2-4 \u03bcL and increased the volume until an LCR-associated apnea of a consistent, moderate duration (usually two to five seconds) was elicited. The water volumes required to elicit the LCR were usually between 8 \u2013 20 \u03bcl. Once established in each animal, we held the stimulus volume constant for the entire duration of each experiment in each pup. We gave a minimum of three stimulations using the effective volume to establish a baseline LCR response. Next, we administered 4 mM 5-HT in normal saline by focal microinjection, after which we gave a minimum of three additional LCR stimulations. We waited ten to twenty minutes between stimulations to allow the animal to clear the water from its larynx, to allow breathing to recover and to minimize accommodation to the stimulus. After each experiment, we euthanized the animal by an anesthetic overdose. We decapitated each animal that received a microinjection and carefully removed its brain to determine the injection location.\n\nNeuroanatomy\nWe fixed the brains of microinjected animals by immersion in approximately twenty volumes of 4% paraformaldehyde in 10 mM phosphate buffered saline for a minimum of 48 hours, and cryoprotected them by immersion in tubes of 30% sucrose in phosphate buffered saline until they no longer floated. We blocked the brains, froze them in an aqueous cutting medium (Tissue-Tek O.C.T., Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and cut 40-0 micron, coronal sections on a cryostat (CM 3050 S, Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL). Each coronal section was examined and photographed immediately using an E800 microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) with a mercury arc light source with appropriate filters for the fluorescence profile of the beads used. We compared anatomical landmarks visible on each slice with those shown on atlas plates (\nPaxinos and Watson, 1998\n) to determine the location of each injection in the brainstem and plotted each location on the atlas plate that corresponded most closely with its position in the brain. Sections from two animals in the IH group could not be analyzed for the location of the microinjections.\n\n5-HT\n3\nautoradiography\nFrom a separate group of dams exposed to IH or RA as described above, we selected pups between ages P7 and P24, and anesthetized each animal before euthanizing it. The brain from each of these animals was removed, frozen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until sectioned at 20 microns. Sections were collected serially onto sets of 4 slides such that each slide contained every fourth section. Slides were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until processed for autoradiography.\nSlides were removed from the \u221280 \u00b0C, placed at 4 \u00b0C for 2 hours and then dried at room temperature for 1 hour. For each experiment, 1 set of slides was used for total radioligand binding and a second set of slides was processed to determine non-specific binding. The incubation of 5-HT\n3\nreceptor antagonist,\n3\nH GR65630, was performed according to Kilpatrick\net al\n. (\nKilpatrick et al., 1988\n), with slight modification. Slides were pre-incubated at room temperature in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) for 15 minutes. For total binding, slides were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 nM\n3\nH GR65630 (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Ma). Non-specific binding was determined with 30 uM metoclopramide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louise, MO). Incubated slides were washed 2 times for 2 minutes each in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) followed by a 10 second rinse in water. Slides were air dried overnight and exposed to a Fuji phosphoimaging plate (BAS-TR2025) (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences; Pittsburgh, PA) for 3 weeks with a\n3\nH standard slide (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc, St. Louise, MO). The standard permitted conversion of optical density of silver grains to femtomoles per mg (fmol/mg) of tissue to quantitate the binding results.\nAfter 3 weeks, the Fuji plates were exposed on a Typhoon FLA 7000 phosphoimager (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences; Pittsburgh, PA) to obtain a digital autoradiographic image. Quantitative densitometry of autoradiograms was performed using an MCID imaging system (Imaging Research Inc, St. Catharines ON, Canada). For each brain,\n3\nH GR65630 binding was measured at 3 different brainstem levels within the NTS: rostral, middle and caudal. At rostral levels the NTS was bilaterally separate under the 4\nth\nventricle corresponding to atlas levels Bregma \u221212.90 to \u221213.50. Middle levels where characterized by the joining of the NTS at the midline over the central canal and below the area postrema at Bregma \u221213.50 to \u2122 14.10. Caudal levels of the NTS were sampled near or caudal to the obex corresponding to atlas levels Bregma \u221214.10 to \u221214.70. At each level, 2-4 brainstem sections (depending on availability of sections) were measured and averaged together. Non-specific binding was also measured at each level and subtracted from the total binding to determine specific binding. Due to an increased chance for tissue loss during the incubation process of younger animals, 2 different incubations were performed, and the data from each incubation were averaged together. For the older animals, only one incubation was performed. All quantitative measurements were made blinded to the treatment group.\n\nStatistics and Data Analysis\nWe measured the effect on respiration of each laryngeal water stimulus in two ways. First, we measured the duration of the apnea, which we defined as the period from the onset of the last breath before the water stimulus was given until the start of the first obvious respiratory activity following the stimulus. Second, we measured the length of the period from the onset of the last breath before the water stimulus until the start of the first of five regular breaths after the stimulus (regular in rhythm, but not necessarily amplitude), a more comprehensive measure of respiratory disruption and instability that we refer to as the LCR. We found in previous studies (\nCurran et al., 2005\n;\nXia et al., 2007\n) that this dual set of measurements provided a more robust measurement of respiratory disruption than either would alone.\nData are presented as means \u00b1 the standard deviation. To compare apnea and LCR durations before and after focal application of 5-HT, we used a two-way ANOVA in which the effect of prenatal gas exposure (RA versus IH on the LCR was compared between treatment groups, and the LCR responses before and after 5-HT microinjection were compared within each animal (a repeated comparison). The variances of the durations of apnea and the LCR were not homogeneous, and the data were not normally distributed. Therefore, we log-transformed the apnea and LCR durations and performed the statistical analysis in STATA 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). We incorporated age as a random effect in some of these analyses. When the ANOVA indicated that significant differences existed among treatments, specific, pre-planned comparisons were made using P-values adjusted by the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons. We performed regression analysis in STATA 15.1 to determine if the stimulus volume used to elicit the LCR differed between the two treatment groups (RA versus IH) or differed among animals of different post-natal age.\nStatistical comparisons of 5-HT\n3\nbinding in the NTS were also made in STATA 15.1 using a three-way ANOVA in which the age of the rat pups, the type of prenatal gas exposure, and the rostro-caudal level of the NTS were used as categorical variables. The rostro-caudal levels were treated as a repeated measure within the ANOVA. As above, we performed specific, pre-planned, paired comparisons using P-values adjusted by the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons only when the ANOVA indicated that significant interactions existed."

    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nAll procedures for the current study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California Irvine, and in accordance with the recommendations from the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nAnimals\nMice lacking Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (Ccdc109a [Mcu], IST11669F8; Texas A&M Institute for Genomic Medicine) were bred from homozygous breeding pairs. Genotype was validated with protocol as detailed previously (\nPan et al., 2013\n), using the following primers: HP3\u2019 (CCATCTGTTCCTGACCTTGA), IST11669F8-F (GGAGTTAAGTCATGAGCTGC), and IST11669F8-R (CTGGCTTAGTTGGCAGAGTT). CD-1 mice (used as control and wildtype) were ordered from Charles River (Crl:CD1[ICR]).\n\nReagents and indicators\nMaterials for culture maintenance (Minimum Essential Media [\nMEM\n], fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and horse serum) and for imaging (Newport Green, FluoZin-3 AM, MitoTracker Green, Pluronic F-127, Fura-FF) were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). Other reagents for experiments (2,2\u2019-dithiodipyridine [\nDTDP\n], Carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone [\nFCCP\n], Rhodamine 123 [\nRhod123\n], Ruthenium Red [\nRR\n], and N-methyl-D-aspartate [\nNMDA\n]) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Hydroethidine (\nHEt\n) was purchased from Assay Biotech (Sunnyvale, CA), MK-801 from Abcam, Apocynin from Acros Organics (Morris Plains, NJ), and XF Base Medium (minimal Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium) from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA). All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from common commercial sources.\n\nMedia\nFor culture growth and/or maintenance, the following media were used: \u201cMaintenance media\u201d (MEM supplemented with 25 mM glucose), \u201cgrowth media\u201d (maintenance media supplemented with 10% heatinactivated horse serum 2 mM glutamine), and \u201cplating media\u201d (growth media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum). For imaging experiments and/or Zn\n2+\nexposures, HEPES-buffered media (consisting of the following [in mM]: 120 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.8 MgCl\n2\n, 20 Hepes, 15 glucose, 10 NaOH, in pH 7.4; with either 0 mM CaCl\n2\n[\n0 mM Ca\n2+\nHSS\n] or 1.8 mM CaCl\n2\n[\n1.8 mM Ca\n2+\nHSS\n]) were used, and kept at room temperature unless specified otherwise. To prepare hippocampal slices, isolated brains were maintained in the \u201cpreparation solution\u201d (consisting of the following [in mM]: 220 sucrose, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 6 MgSO\n4\n, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 0.2 CaCl\n2\n, 10 glucose, and 0.42 ketamine, kept in pH 7.35, maintained at 310 mOsm, and equilibrated with 95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n). The hippocampal slices were maintained in artificial cerebral spinal fluid (\nACSF\n; consisting of the following [in mM]: 126 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1 MgSO\n4\n, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 10 glucose, kept in pH 7.35, maintained at 310 mOsm with sucrose, and equilibrated with 95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n).\n\nNeuronal culture preparation\nMixed cortical neuronal cultures were prepared as described previously (\nYin et al., 1994\n). Briefly, neocortical regions from CD-1 or MCU KO mouse embryos (15 \u2013 16 gestational day; mixed gender) were isolated and cells suspended in plating media. The neuronal suspension was then plated on previously established astrocytic monolayers (of the same genotype) on glass-bottomed dishes, Seahorse XF24 cell culture microplates, or culture-treated 24 well microplates. 2 \u2013 3 days after plating, culture was treated with 10 \u03bcM cytosine arabinoside for 24 hrs (to stop non-neuronal cell division), and media was switched to growth media. Cells were kept in 5% CO\n2\n/37\u00b0C incubator for at least 10 days prior to experiment. To prepare astrocytic monolayers, the same protocol was used with the following changes: 1) neocortical tissues from postnatal mice (1 \u2013 3 days old; mixed gender) from CD-1 or MCU KO mice were used, 2) plating media was supplemented with epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), and 3) suspended cells were plated on poly-D-lysine and laminin-coated glass-bottomed dishes, culture treated 24 well microplates, and Seahorse XF24 cell culture microplates.\n\nZn\n2+\nexposure\nCultured neurons were placed in either 0 mM Ca\n2+\nor 1.8 mM Ca\n2+\nHSS prior to starting all experiments. After 10 min baseline and pre-treatment with 60 \u03bcM DTDP \u00b1 500 \u03bcM Apocynin (if indicated), Zn\n2+\nand/or Ca\n2+\nloading was induced. To permit ion influx, neurons were exposed to indicated levels of Zn\n2+\n(0 \u2013 300 \u03bcM) and/or 1.8 mM Ca\n2+\nin 90 mM K\n+\nHSS (\u201c\nhigh K\n+\n\u201d\n; HSS modified with 90 mM K\n+\nand Na\n+\nadjusted to 35 mM to maintain osmolarity) for 5 min to depolarize neurons, inducing Zn\n2+\nand/or Ca\n2+\nentry through VSCC. NMDA antagonist MK-801 (10 \u03bcM)\u2014used to inhibit Ca\n2+\nentry through NMDA receptors\u2014was added during all Zn\n2+\nand/or Ca\n2+\nexposures (even when Ca\n2+\nwas not present during the experiment) to maintain consistency. After 5 min Zn\n2+\nand/or Ca\n2+\nexposure in high K\n+\n, neurons were washed 3 times in HSS (60 \u03bcM DTDP \u00b1 500 \u03bcM apocynin or 10 \u03bcM RR, as indicated). If the experiment involved incubation, cultured neurons were washed 3 times into maintenance media and kept in the 5% CO\n2\n/37\u00b0C incubator until needed. When attempting to best model the events that may occur during ischemic conditions, the following standardized paradigm was used when indicated (10 min pre-exposure to 60 \u03bcM DTDP, followed by 5 min 100 \u03bcM Zn\n2+\n+ high K\n+\n+ MK-801 + DTDP and 3x wash into DTDP, all in 1.8 mM Ca\n2+\nHSS; termed \u201c\nischemic Zn\n2+\nexposure\n\u201d).\n\nQuantitative imaging studies\nNeuronal cultures aged 10 \u2013 16 days\nin vitro\n(\nDIV\n) were placed on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope equipped with 75 Watts Xenon-lamp, a filter wheel controlled by a computer, a 40x (1.3 numerical aperture) epifluorescence oil-immersion objective along with the following fluorescence cubes: a green FITC (Ex: 480 nm, dichroic: 505 nm, Em: 535 nm) and a red TRITC fluorescence cube (Ex: 540 nm, dichroic: 565 nm, Em: 605 nm). Emitted signals were captured every min with a Sensys Photometrics intensified charge-coupled device camera, and converted digitally by the MetaFluor software (Version 7.0, Molecular Devices LLC, Sunnyvale, CA). Gain and exposure of the camera were adjusted to obtain baseline fluorescence level of 200 \u2013 300 arbitrary units of a 12-bit signal output of 4,096 for all fluorophores. For imaging, only fields with at least 20 healthy looking cells (non-clustered neurons with robust processes) were used. For analysis, background fluorescence (the lowest value in a neuron-free region of the field) was subtracted from images, and fluorescence measurement for each neuron (\nF\nx\n) was normalized to the average fluorescence intensity of the 10 min baseline measure (\nF\n0\n) to trend normalized fluorescence over time (\nF\nx\n/F\n0\n). The F\nx\n/F\n0\nof each cell in the field was averaged to produce a value constituting one experiment repetition.\nCytosolic Zn\n2+\nEither low affinity cytosolic Zn\n2+\nindicator Newport Green diacetate (K\nd\n~ 1 \u03bcM, Ex: 490 nm, Em: 530 nm; using a green FITC fluorescence cube) or the high affinity cytosolic Zn\n2+\nindicator FluoZin-3 AM (K\nd\n~ 15 nM, Ex: 494 nm, Em: 516 nm; using a green FITC fluorescence cube) was used to quantify neuronal Zn\n2+\nlevels (\nCanzoniero et al., 1999\n;\nGee et al., 2002\n;\nSensi et al., 1999\n). Cultured neurons were loaded with 5 \u03bcM Newport Green or FluoZin-3 in 0 mM Ca\n2+\nHSS containing 0.2% Pluronic F-127 and 1.5% dimethlyl sulfoxide (in the dark room, at room temperature) prior to use for experiments. To assess mitochondrial Zn\n2+\nlevels, FCCP (1 \u03bcM) was added at the end of each experiment to release mitochondrially sequestered Zn\n2+\n, with the resulting increase in cytosolic Zn\n2+\nlevel permitting estimate of degree of mitochondrial Zn\n2+\naccumulation.\nMitochondrial membrane potential\nMitochondrial membrane potential sensitive indicator Rhod123 (Ex: 507 nm, Em: 529 nm; using a green FITC fluorescence cube) was used to quantify mitochondrial depolarization. Neurons were used for imaging after loading the cultures with 2 \u03bcM Rhod123 in 1.8 mM Ca\n2+\nHSS for 30 min (in the dark room, at room temperature). Rhod123 is a positively charged dye which accumulates in mitochondria, where its fluorescence is quenched. With mitochondrial depolarization, the Rhod123 sequestered in the mitochondria gets released, resulting in increase in Rhod123 fluorescence intensity (\nDuchen et al., 2003\n). FCCP (1 \u03bcM; 5 min) was added at the end of each experiment to induce maximal mitochondrial depolarization, permitting measure of maximal Rhod123 \u0394F.\nReactive oxygen species\nSuperoxide sensitive dye HEt (Ex: 510\u2013560 nm; Em: > 590 nm; using a red TRITC fluorescence cube) was used to quantify ROS generation. Neurons were used for imaging after loading the cultures with 5 \u03bcM HEt in 0 mM or 1.8 mM Ca\n2+\nHSS for 30 min (in the dark room, at room temperature). As HEt is oxidized into highly fluorescent ethidium, ROS generation is quantified as the HEt fluorescence increase.\n\nMitochondrial respiration assay\nMitochondrial respiration was assessed by measuring changes in O\n2\nconsumption rate (\nOCR\n) using the Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer, as described previously with adjustments (\nYao et al., 2009\n). Briefly, neurons plated on top of astrocytic monolayers on Seahorse XF24 Cell Culture Microplates were exposed to the ischemic Zn\n2+\nexposure, washed into DTDP for 20 min, and incubated for 2 hrs (in maintenance media and % CO\n2\n/37\u00b0C incubator). After completing the incubation, cultures were washed into XF Base Medium (supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 15 mM glucose, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate), and maintained at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr prior to starting the Seahorse XF24 assay. The machine measures the OCR of cells during baseline and after the sequential exposure to 1 \u03bcM oligomycin, 2 \u03bcM FCCP, and antimycin A/rotenone (both at 1 \u03bcM). The concentrations of mitochondrial inhibitors were determined empirically, with FCCP specifically adjusted to induce approximately 1.5x the baseline. Prior to each experiment, all culture wells were visually inspected (to ensure equal distribution of cells) and randomly assigned to treatment groups. All calibration instructions were followed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols, and Seahorse XF24 program and Wave software were used to run the assay and analyze the data respectively. We carried out prior validation studies confirming astrocytes make minimal contributions to observed OCR and its changes, as our cultured neurons are plated on top of astrocyte monolayers (as discussed above).\n\nConfocal imaging of mitochondrial morphology\nMitochondrial morphology was assessed as described previously (\nJi and Weiss, 2018\n). Briefly, confocal microscopy was performed using an inverted stage Nikon Eclipse Ti chassis microscope with a Yokogawa CSUX spinning disk head. Images were observed at 1000x oil-immersion objective (1.49 numerical aperture) using a Hamamatsu electromultiplying CCD camera. Field was scanned sequentially with excitation (488 nm) via a Coherent sapphire laser source synchronized with the camera, and emission monitored with a 525 (50) nm filter. Images were acquired using the MicroManager Image Acquisition software (ver 1.52). After cultured neurons were exposed to the ischemic Zn\n2+\nexposure paradigm (discussed above) + 20 min wash + 12 hr incubation (in maintenance media at 37\u00b0C/5% CO\n2\n), cultures were loaded with 200 nM MitoTracker Green (Ex: 490 nm, Em: 516 nm) in 1.8 mM Ca\n2+\nHSS for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, and then switched into 1.8 mM Ca\n2+\nHSS for the imaging. Only healthy appearing neurons with intact outer membranes (as could be visualized via brightfield imaging) were chosen for imaging. Camera gain, laser intensity, and exposure times were adjusted to make MitoTracker Green fluorescence intensity 1.5 \u2013 2 times that of the background fluorescence value. Heat fan was used to maintain imaging rig at 37\u00b0C. Images acquired were blinded, and lengths and width of distinct mitochondria measured manually in the ImageJ software. The values were used to calculate length/width (\nL/W\n) ratio of individual mitochondria, which were then averaged to produce one average L/W ratio representing one repetition of an experiment.\n\nNeurotoxicity Assessment\nNeurotoxicity was examined in cultured neurons plated on 24 well microplates at 14 \u2013 16 DIV. Briefly, neurons were switched into HSS (0 or 1.8 mM Ca\n2+\n), and exposed to 60 \u03bcM DTDP (10 min), Zn\n2+\n\u00b1 Ca\n2+\n(in high K\n+\nand 10 \u03bcM MK-801, as discussed above; 5 min) and 10 \u03bcM RR (20 min), with concentration as detailed above. After the exposures and treatment, cultures were washed in maintenance media and kept in 37\u00b0C/5% CO\n2\nfor 24 hrs, at which cell death was quantified with by lactate dehydrogenase (\nLDH\n) efflux assay as described (\nKoh and Choi, 1987\n). In all experiments, the background LDH present in the media was subtracted by measuring the level in the sham wash protocol, used as negative control, and scaled to levels in positive controls (obtained in cultures exposed to 300 \u03bcM NMDA for 24 hrs, a paradigm that reliable destroys >90% of neurons while sparing glia). All wells were visually inspected to estimate degree of cell death, which was compared to quantification from LDH assay, for validation.\n\nHippocampal slice oxygen-glucose deprivation\nAcute hippocampal slices were prepared as described previously (\nMedvedeva et al., 2009\n). Briefly, brains from 25 \u00b1 3 days old mice were rapid removed after anesthesia with isoflurane and kept in the ice-cold preparation solution. Hippocampal slices were cut with Leica VT1200 vibratome at 300 \u03bcm thickness and placed in ACSF. After slices were equilibrated in ACSF for 1 hr at 34\u00b0C, slices were switched into oxygenated ACSF in room temperature for \u22651 hr prior to use.\nSlices were mounted on the stage of an upright microscope (BX51WI; Olympus), placed in a flow-through chamber (RC-27L chamber with plastic slice anchor; Warner Instruments), and perfused with the oxygenated ACSF (2 ml/min; 32\u00b0C). To measure intracellular Ca\n2+\ndynamics, Fura FF (K\nd\n~ 6 \u03bcM) was loaded into individual hippocampal pyramidal neurons using a patch pipette held in the whole cell configuration at \u2013 60 mV for 5 min. After pipette withdrawal, the injected cells were left to recover for 20 min prior to experiment. Fluorescence was alternately excited at 340(20)/380(20) nm via 40\u00d7 water-immersion objective using a xenon light source (Sutter Instruments) and emitted fluorescence was collected at 532(40) nm using a cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu). All filters are band pass with bandwidths indicated in parentheses. Images were taken every 15 or 30 s, background subtracted, and analyzed using the MetaFluor software. Changes in Ca\n2+\nlevels are displayed as the ratio of background subtracted Fura FF emission intensities upon excitation at 340 and 380 nm (\u201c340/380 ratio\u201d).\nTo model ischemic injury, slices were placed in hypoxic-hypoglycemic condition (via oxygen-glucose deprivation [\nOGD\n]). ACSF was changed to the same solution lacking glucose (and replaced with sucrose to maintain osmolarity) and bubbled with 95% N\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n. OGD was continued for \u2265 15 min and maintained until Ca\n2+\nderegulation occurred.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll values on traces are displayed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (\nSEM\n), and on bars displayed as mean + SEM. All experiments were interleaved and have been repeated \u2265 3 times. All comparisons reflect matching sets of cell cultures or slices from the same set of dissections or slice preparation, and all efforts were made to match biologic variables between comparisons. Two-tailed student\u2019s t-test was used to assess significance."

    "Methods": "2.1. Study Population and controls\nFourty-Nine MG patients were enrolled from the Duke MG clinic. All patients had detectable anti-AChR binding antibodies according to commercially available testing (Mayo Medical Laboratory, Rochester, MN) as well as clinical and electrodiagnostic features consistent with the disease. Severity of MG disease was defined according to the MGFA Severity Class and MG-Manual Muscle Test (MG-MMT) (\nJaretzki et al., 2000\n;\nSanders et al., 2003\n). MG patients were grouped by MGFA severity classification 0-II (ocular/mild disease) or III-V (moderate/severe). Control blood samples were obtained from 23 healthy individuals, who were age- and gender-matched to MG patients as closely as possible. Controls were not receiving therapy for any chronic disease. This study was approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board and written and informed consent was obtained from subjects.\n\n2.2. Isolation and storage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)\nFollowing venipuncture, peripheral blood was collected in acid-citrate-dextrose tubes (BD Vacutainer). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and were resuspended in a 90% FBS (Gemini, Sacramento, CA) and 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) freezing solution. PBMCs were viably cryopreserved and stored in vapor phase liquid nitrogen. Plasma was isolated after Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\n2.3. Polarization of IL-17 producing T cells\nTo polarize T cells into Th17 cells, we adapted \u201c\nBD Bioscience\u2019s (BDB) protocol for Generation of Human IL-17-Producing Cells in Vitro (2013)\n.\u201d 3\u00d710\n6\nPBMCs were plated in 24-well flat bottom plates in R10 (RPMI 1640 media [Gibco] + 10% FBS + 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin-L-Glutamine [Sigma-Aldrich]) and stimulated with \u03b1CD3 (1\u03bcg/mL, BDB) and \u03b1CD28 (1\u03bcg/mL, BDB) in the presence of IL-6 (10ng/mL, BDB), IL-1\u03b2 (10ng/mL, BDB), IL-23 (10ng/mL, R&D Systems), TGF-\u03b21 (10ng/mL, BDB), along with anti-IL-4 (10\u03bcg/mL, BDB) and anti-IFN-\u03b3 (10\u03bcg/mL, BDB) for 7 days at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO\n2\nincubator. For the last 5 hours, cells were restimulated with PMA (1\u03bcg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich), ionomycin (0.25\u03bcg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) and brefeldin A (BFA;1\u03bcg/mL, BDB).\n\n2.4. Intracellular cytokine staining\nFor intracellular cytokine staining of cells at baseline and following 7 days of Th17 polarization, cells were stained with Zombie Violet (BL) at room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, cells were surface stained with anti-CXCR5 Alexa Fluor 647 (RF8B2, BDB), anti-CD14 Pacific Blue (M5E2, BL), anti-CD45RA Brilliant Violet 510 (HI100, BL), and anti-CCR7 PE-Dazzle 594 (G043H7, BL) for 25 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Following cell surface staining, cells were treated with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BDB) in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. To detect intracellular markers, cells were stained with fluorescent antibodies for anti-CD3 APC-Cy7 (SK3), anti-CD4 PE-Cy7 (SK3), anti-CD8 Alexa Fluor 700 (SK1), anti-IFN-\u03b3 FITC (B27), anti-IL-17A PerCP-Cy5.5 (BL168), and anti-IL-4 PE (MP4\u201325D2) for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The fluorescent antibodies used for intracellular staining were obtained from Biolegend. Lastly, cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and acquired on a LSRII flow cytometer (BDB).\n\n2.5. ROR-\u03b3 Inhibition Assay\nThree million PBMCs were plated in a 24-well flat bottom plate in R10 and stimulated with the described Th17 cocktail or the Th17 cocktail plus a high affinity small molecule inhibitor of ROR-\u03b3 transcription factor, ROR-c (gift from Novartis) (\nGuendisch et al., 2017\n;\nGuntermann et al., 2017\n). Cells were placed in a 37\u00b0C 5% CO\n2\nincubator for 7 days. Five hours prior to the end of in the incubation period, cells from each condition were re-stimulated with PMA and ionomycin in the presence of BFA. 50\u03bcM of ROR-c was selected for subsequent experiments because it maintained viability and provided maximum inihibition of IL-17 production.\n\n2.6. Data analysis\nThe studied population of MG patients was compared with healthy controls. To determine whether Th17 cell frequencies changed with MG disease severity we compared ocular/mild generalized MG with moderate/severe MGFA Severity Classes. T cell subset frequencies were compared with and without ROR-\u03b3 inhibition. Data analysis was performed using Flowjo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Student T-tests determined statistical significance (\u03b1<0.05) between groups. The p values were calculated using Prism software (Graph Pad, LaJolla, CA). Samples in which stimulation with \u03b1CD3 and \u03b1CD28 failed to generate increased IL-17 over background were not analyzed."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nWe used adult, 3 month old male, C57Bl6 wild type (WT), SIRT3KO mice (B6.129S6(Cg)-Sirt\ntm1.1Fwa/j\n) that were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and our transgenic animals that expresses mitochondria-targeted yellow fluorescence protein (mito-eYFP) in neurons (\nChandrasekaran et al., 2006\n). We also used mito-eYFP-SIRT3KO mice generated by crossbreeding the mito-eYFP animals with SIRT3KO mice (\nKlimova et al., 2019\n). All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health and were approved by the Animal Care and use Committee of the University of Maryland Baltimore. The animals were maintained in a 12-h light/dark cycle and were housed in temperature-controlled room at 23 \u00b0C. All cages contained bedding and nesting material for environmental enrichment. The mice were free of all viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens. All mice were allowed free access to water and a maintenance diet. Mice were divided at random into several groups for all experiments.\n\n2.2. Transient forebrain ischemia\nForebrain ischemia was induced as described in (\nOnken et al., 2012\n), see also (\nPark et al., 2016\n). Briefly, before the surgery, the animals were fasted with free access to tap water. Under isoflurane anesthesia common carotid arteries (CCA) were isolated and the ischemia was induced by clamping the CCA with micro-vessel clamps with concomitant reduction of mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) to 30 mmHg. Both, core and head temperature were monitored and maintained at 37.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C. Following 10 min ischemic period the clamps were removed, anesthesia discontinued, and the animals were placed into a temperature-controlled incubator for 3 h before they were moved to pre-heated cages. Sham operated animals underwent the same surgical procedure without the occlusion of common carotid arteries. The ischemia surgery schedule was adjusted to accommodate for NAD\n+\ncontent determination at the desired time of the day.\n\n2.3. NMN administration\nNicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) (Sigma N3501) was prepared in 0.2 mL sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and was administered to mice at a dose of 62.5 mg/kg (\nPark et al., 2016\n). The drug or vehicle solution (PBS) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) using 29G needle 30 min after the start of reperfusion. NMN and vehicle solution were prepared the same day as administered. To avoid the effect of circadian rhythm on brain tissue NAD\n+\nlevels (\nPeek et al., 2013\n), all samples were collected at the same time of the day between 9 and 10 AM.\n\n2.4. Mitoquinol and Apocynin administration\nVehicle treated post-ischemic animals were i.p. administered with mitoquinol (MitoQ) (Cayman Chemical #89950) (4 mg/kg) at 22 h of reperfusion. MitoQ was prepared in a solution of 1.8% DMSO in filtered PBS (200 \u03bcL). Apocynin, an NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitor was prepared as a stock solution in DMSO (30 mg/mL) and then diluted with filtered PBS prior to administration. Animals received a dose of 5 mg/kg (200 \u03bcL volume) as i.p. injection at 30 min of recovery. All drugs administration, sample collection and processing was performed by investigator that was blinded to the identity of the experimental groups.\nIn vivo\nreactive oxygen species (ROS) detection by dihydroethidium (DHE).\nFor ROS detection studies in vivo we administered to animals dihydroethidium that is oxidized to fluorescent hydroxyethidium by reactive oxygen species (\nZielonka et al., 2008\n). DHE (Axxora) stock solution was prepared by dissolving 10 mg in 200 \u03bcL DMSO (50 mg/mL) and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. The stock was diluted in filtered PBS for administration. DHE (50 mg/kg) was injected i.p. (\nHall et al., 2012\n). Sham operated, vehicle or NMN treated post-ischemic animals received DHE at 1 h or at 23 h of recovery. In another group of animals, DHE was injected 10 min before the onset of ischemia at 25 mg/kg dose to measure ROS generation during the early first hour of reperfusion.\nIn all experimental groups, 1 h after the DHE administration mice were either perfusion fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and their brain was removed from skull and processed for histology or the animals were decapitated, and the hippocampi were isolated on ice and homogenized in isolation medium (see below) with protease inhibitors. Perfusion-fixed brains were further processed by cutting coronal sections of 40 \u03bcm on a freezing microtome. Brain sections were mounted on slides and hippocampal images were collected using Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope.\nZ\n-stack images were obtained from the CA1, CA3, and DG neuronal cell body layer of the hippocampal tissue from sham operated and vehicle or NMN treated post-ischemic animals. Four images were taken from each section. Images were analyzed with Volocity software (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Mitochondrial localization of ROS was determining by the Pearson\u2019s colocalization coefficient between mito-eYFP and hydroxyethidium signal and the total intensity of all objects within the recorded volume was counted and normalized to the unit volume (\u03bcm\n3\n).\nROS generated fluorescence signal (red fluorescent hydroxyethidium) from homogenized hippocampal tissue was also measured using Fluostar Optima plate reader. Excitation wavelength was set at 460 nm and emission wavelength set at 590 nm. Samples were run in triplicates. Data are reported as fluorescence units/\u03bcg protein. Protein concentration of samples was determined by Lowry method using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard.\n\n2.5. Hippocampal mitochondria isolation\nNon-synaptic hippocampal mitochondria were isolated from sham, vehicle or NMN treated ischemic animals at 2, 4, and 24 h of reperfusion as described in (\nKristian et al., 2000\n;\nKristian, 2010\n). Briefly, following decapitation, hippocampi were isolated on ice and then homogenized in ice-cold isolation medium (225 mM sucrose, 75 mM mannitol, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM Hepes) with protease inhibitors (AG Scientific T-2495), acetylation inhibitors (10 \u03bcM TSA, 10 mM nicotinamide, 10 mM sodium butyrate), and PARP1 inhibitors (2 mM Naorthovanadate, 5 mM NaF, 5 mM glycerol-2-phosphate, 1 \u03bcM ADP-HPD, 40 \u03bcM PJ-34). Homogenate was mixed 1:1 with 30% percoll, loaded on a 24% \u2013 40% percoll gradient, and centrifuged at 30,700\ng\nfor 8 min at 4 \u00b0C. The layer at the 24% and 40% percoll interface was collected as purified non-synaptic mitochondria. The collected fraction was resuspended in isolation medium and centrifuged at 16,700\ng\nfor 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Supernatant was removed, isolation medium was added to the pellet, and centrifuged at 6900\ng\nfor 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Finally, isolation medium lacking EGTA was added to the obtained pellet and used for metabolite measurement or western blots. Hippocampi from one mouse yielded to about 0.25 mg of mitochondrial protein. The whole sample was used for NAD\n+\nextraction procedure.\n\n2.6. Blood sample collection for metabolite determination\nArterial blood was collected at 2, 4, and 24 h after the start of reperfusion from sham, vehicle, and NMN treated ischemic animals. Plasma was isolated by centrifugation of blood at 10,000\ng\nfor 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was then stored at \u221280 \u00b0C till further processing.\nExtraction of metabolites.\nMetabolites from isolated mitochondria and plasma were extracted by 7% ice-cold perchloric acid (PCA) and were incubated on ice for 15 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 10,000\ng\nfor 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was used for Lowry protein measurements while the supernatant was neutralized with 1 M Trizma and 9 M KOH. The supernatant was then filtered by 0.22 \u03bcm PVDF filter and used for NAD\n+\ndetermination by enzymatic cyclic assay (\nKristian and Fiskum, 2004\n).\n\n2.7. Measurement of mitochondrial NAD\n+\nlevels\nNAD\n+\ncontent in plasma and mitochondrial samples were measured by a cycling enzymatic assay that generates a fluorescent product (\nKristian and Fiskum, 2004\n,\nKlimova et al., 2019\n). Levels were normalized to the respective protein amount.\n\n2.8. Western blots\nAfter hippocampal dissection and mitochondrial isolation was performed twenty-five \u03bcg of mitochondrial protein were heated at 75 \u00b0C, loaded into Bio-Rad 10 well mini-protean TGX precast gels and separated through sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).\ntrans\n-Blot Turbo system (Bio-Rad) was used to transfer proteins from gels to immobilon PVDF-FL membranes. Membranes were incubated in Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-cor Biosciences) for 1 h and then incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 \u00b0C (acetylated lysine (1:1000, Cell Signaling #9814); SIRT3 (1:1000, Cell Signaling #5490); VDAC (1:5000, Abcam #14734); VDAC (1:5000, Cell Signaling #4661); MFN1 (1:1000, ProteinTech #13798\u20131-AP); MFN2 (1:1000, Abcam #56889); OPA1 (1:1000, BD Biosciences #612606); SOD2 (1:1000, ProteinTech #24127\u20131-AP); pDrp1 (S616) (1:1000, Cell Signaling #4494); Drp1 (1:1000, Abcam #56788)). Membranes were washed in phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% tween-20 (PBS-T) and then incubated in infrared (IR) fluorophore conjugated secondary antibody (Li-Cor) for 30 min in the dark at room temperature (800CW Goat anti-Mouse IgG (1:50,000, Li-cor #925\u201332,210); 680RD Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (1:10,000, Li-cor #925\u201368,071)). Membranes were washed with PBST, PBS, and scanned using Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor). Bands were quantified with Li-cor imaging system and VDAC signal was used as normalization control in samples. All antibodies were titrated to appropriate working concentrations before use.\n\n2.9. Immunoprecipitation\nHippocampal tissue was dissected from sham operated or vehicle/NMN treated ischemic animals 24 h after reperfusion and homogenized in 500 \u03bcL RIPA buffer containing protease and acetylation inhibitors (10 \u03bcM TSA, 10 mM nicotinamide, 10 mM sodium butyrate). The volume was adjusted to 1.5 mL with PBS and concentration was measured by Lowry assay. Four mg of hippocampal tissue was incubated with protein A sepharose bead slurry (Sigma #P9424) for 30 min on a rotator at 4 \u00b0C, then centrifuged at 1000\ng\nfor 3 min at 4 \u00b0C, and supernatant transferred to a new tube. Four \u03bcg of SOD2 antibody (Protein Tech #24127\u20131-AP) was added to pre-cleared supernatant and incubated rocking for 12 h at 4 \u00b0C. Next, 50 \u03bcL of the protein A sepharose bead slurry was added and incubated rocking for 12 h at 4 \u00b0C. The immunocomplex-beads were washed 3 times with 1 mL 0.2% TBSTriton X-100. SOD2 protein was eluted using elution buffer (0.1 M Glycine, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 1.5\u20132.5) and neutralized by 10\u00d7 PBS. 4\u00d7 Laemmli Sample Buffer was added to the eluted protein samples and heated at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min. Western blot analysis was performed using primary antibodies for SOD2 (1:1000, ProteinTech #24127\u20131-AP) and acetylated lysine (1:1000, Cell Signaling #9814) and normalized to the amount of SOD2 protein.\n\n2.10. Immunohistochemistry\nSham, vehicle or NMN treated ischemic mito-eYFP mice were perfusion fixed under deep anesthesia 24 h after the start of reperfusion. Mice were intubated and ventilated and then transcardialy perfused for 1 min with oxygenated cold PBS. This was followed by perfusion with warm (37 \u00b0C) 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 7 min (\nOwens et al., 2015\n). Afterwards brains were post-fixed overnight in paraformaldehyde at 4 \u00b0C and the next day transferred into 30% sucrose for 3 days. Coronal sections of 40 \u03bcm were cut on a freezing microtome and collected. Sections were washed with KPBS and incubated with pDrp1 (S616) antibody (1:500, Cell Signaling #4494) at 4 \u00b0C overnight in 0.3% KPBS-T (Triton X-100). Afterwards, sections were washed with KPBS and incubated in goat anti-rabbit (Alexa Fluor 594) secondary antibody (1:600, ThermoFisher #A-11012) for 1 h shaking at room temperature. After subsequent washes with KPBS sections were mounted on slides for analysis using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Four\nZ\n-stack images were obtained from the CA1 stratum oriens, CA3 stratum oriens, and dorsal molecular layer of the DG for each experimental group. Volocity software was used to measure colocalization by determining the Pearson\u2019s coefficient between mito-eYFP and pDrp1 (S616) signal.\n\n2.11. Mitochondrial dynamics quantification\nMitochondrial length in sham operated, vehicle or NMN treated ischemic mito-eYFP mice was measured 24 h after the start of reperfusion. Z-stack images of mitochondria from hippocampal sub-regions, CA1 stratum oriens, CA3 stratum oriens, and dorsal molecular layer of the DG, (4 images/region) were collected using a laser scanning confocal microscope. Volocity software was used to analyze and quantify images. While defining individual mitochondria the program measures morphometric parameters of identified objects including skeletal length and shape factor (measure of circularity, 1 being spherical) of each individual mitochondrion. After measurements were completed, mitochondria were sorted based on length and shape factor and data exported to excel for final calculations and graph constructions.\n\n2.12. Laser scanning confocal microscopy\nA Ziess LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope using a Plan-Apochromat 63\u00d7/1.4 oil lens was used to acquire images from brain sections. Single planes of 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixels were recorded at 1.0\u20131.5 Airy unit pinhole every 0.5 \u03bcm z-spacing throughout the whole tissue section. For mitochondrial length analysis 0.2 \u03bcm z-interval was used.\n\n2.13. Statistics\nStatistical analysis was performed using Prism (GraphPad) version 6.0c. All data are expressed as averages \u00b1 standard error of mean (SEM). Data was assumed normally distributed based on the skewness or kurtosis parameter. Statistical significance was assessed by Student\nt\n-test when two groups were compared, and one-way or two-way ANOVA test followed by the Tukey HSD test for multiple comparisons. Figure legend indicates which test was used for each corresponding experiment. The\np\nvalues < .05 were considered to be statistically significant. However, due to small sample sizes we confirmed any significant differences between experimental groups also using non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test, or Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals\nAll animal procedures were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Weill Cornell Medicine. Experiments were performed on adult male and female C57BL/6 mice (2 months old at time of arrival; N = 39; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) and aged adult male and female C57BL/6 mice (18 months old at time of arrival; N=19; National Institute on Aging, Bethesda, Maryland). Four to five mice were housed per cage and mice had access to\nad libitum\nfood and water\n\n2.2. AOF induction and Estrous Cycle Determination\nTo model hormonal levels seen in post-menopausal humans, female mice (50-55 days old; N = 10) were injected with 130 mg/kg 4-vinylcyclohexane diepoxide (VCD) in sesame oil intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 5 sequential days per week for 3 weeks to induce AOF, as described previously (\nMarques-Lopes et al., 2017\n;\nVan Kempen et al., 2014\n). Control mice were injected with sesame oil alone. AOF mice were randomly assigned to CIH or control groups. Mice were subjected to CIH (see below) 129 days following the initiation of the VCD injection (~6.5 months old), at a post-AOF time point corresponding to \u2018post-menopause\u2019 wherein mice have an acyclic, anestrous status, in which ovulation has ceased (\nVan Kempen et al., 2014\n). Similar to human post-menopause, this time point is characterized by undetectable levels of estrogen, decreased levels of progesterone as well as elevated serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and androstenedione (\nLohff et al., 2005\n;\nMayer et al., 2004\n;\nVan Kempen et al., 2014\n;\nVan Kempen et al., 2011\n). Vaginal smear cytology (\nTurner and Bagnara, 1971\n) and uterine weight (collected at the end of the experiment) were used to assess estrous cycle stage.\n\n2.3. Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia\nA CIH system developed by Dr. George J. Delagrammatikas was used to create cyclic hypoxia conditions, as previously described (\nColeman et al., 2010\n;\nJackman et al., 2014\n;\nLessard et al., 2010\n). Briefly, all mice were kept under conditions of 21% oxygen before being separated into CIH and control groups. The gas distribution was controlled by an automated gas delivery system, and oxygen (O\n2\n) levels within the cage transitioned from low O\n2\n(10\u00b11%) or (5\u00b11%) following nitrogen (N\n2\n) infusion to ambient concentrations (21\u00b11%) following pure O\n2\ninfusion. This transition occurred every 90 sec resulting in 20 hypoxic episodes per hour. This rate is comparable to the number of oxygen desaturation events that occur in patients with mild to moderate OSA (\nBoland et al., 2002\n). Hypoxia/sham cycling was induced throughout the light (sleep) phase (8:00 am to 4:00 pm; 8 hours). The control cages were infused with air every 90 seconds to maintain oxygen concentrations at 21\u00b11%. During the remaining 16 hours of the day (4:00 pm to 8:00 am), both CIH and sham cages were infused with room air. The protocol was repeated for 35 days during which the mice in each treatment group were housed together (5 per cage) and had free access to food and water. The temperature was kept at 22-24\u00b0C. The group housing protocol and procedure were developed to minimize variability due to differences in handling and constraints on mobility (\nLee et al., 2009\n;\nLiu et al., 2009\n).\nThere were six CIH cohorts: 1) young males (~2 months old) with mild (10%) CIH (N = 5) and controls (N = 5), 2) aged males (~18 months old) with 10% CIH (N = 5) and controls (N = 4), 3) young saline-injected females (~6 months old) with 10% CIH (N = 4) and controls (N = 5), 4) AOF females (~6 months old) with 10% CIH (N = 5) and controls (N = 5), 5) aged females (~18 months old) with 10% CIH (N = 5) and controls (N = 5), and 6) young males (~2 months old) with severe (5%) CIH (N = 5) and controls (N = 5).\n\n2.4. Blood Pressure Measurements\nOur previous studies (\nColeman et al., 2010\n) in male mice have shown small but significant increases in systolic blood pressure (SBP) following 35 days of 10% CIH. Thus, in the present study, we recorded blood pressure in the female cohorts (described above). For this, we used tail-cuff plethysmography (Model MC4000; Hatteras Instruments, Cary, NC) to measure SBP, as previously described (\nColeman et al., 2010\n). Measurements were taken prior to CIH (baseline) as well as weekly throughout the CIH administration. Measuring SBP through tail-cuff plethysmography has limitations as have been discussed previously (\nMarques-Lopes et al., 2014\n). Animals were handled by the same experimenter and at the same time of day throughout the experiment to minimize stress. Mice were euthanized one day after the final SBP measurements were taken (\nColeman et al., 2013\n;\nMarques-Lopes et al., 2014\n).\n\n2.5. Antibody characterization\nA rat polyclonal antiserum against GABA-glutaraldehyde-hemocyanin conjugates was produced and provided by Dr. Andrew Towle, formerly affiliated with Department of Neurology and Neuroscience at Cornell University Medical College. Preadsorption with GABA-BSA (bovine serum albumin) was used to test the specificity of the antiserum and served to eliminate immunoreactivity. Preadsorption with unconjugated GABA or BSA conjugated to glutamate, \u00df-alanine, or taurine did not abolish immunoreactivity (\nLauder et al., 1986\n). Immunoreactivity of this antiserum is consistent with the specificity of other GABA-antisera (\nLauder et al., 1986\n). This antiserum has been used previously in light and electron microscope studies (\nAlmey et al., 2016\n;\nBayer and Pickel, 1991\n;\nMazid et al., 2016\n).\nA rabbit polyclonal antibody against rat muscle PARV was provided by Dr. K.G. Baimbridge of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. Its specificity has been demonstrated through incomplete cross-reactivity with muscle or brain preparations from other species (\nMithani et al., 1987\n). It has been previously used in light and electron microscope studies (\nMilner and Prince, 1998\n).\nA polyclonal rabbit anti-Somatostatin-14 antibody (Peninsula Laboratories, Catalog. No. T-4103; RRID:AB_518614) was used. It has been previously used in light and electron microscope studies (\nPeng et al., 2013\n).\nA polyclonal rabbit anti-vGAT (Synaptic Systems, Catalog no. 131 002; RRID:AB_887871) was used (\nMartens et al., 2008\n). The manufacturer has demonstrated its specificity using knockout mice (\nhttps://www.sysy.com/products/vgat/facts-131002.php\n). It has previously been utilized in immunohistochemistry and western blot experiments (\nBocarsly et al., 2015\n).\n\n2.6. Tissue preparation\nThe mice were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg,\ni.p.\n) and perfused through the left ventricle of the heart sequentially with ~5 ml heparinized saline followed by 30 ml of 3.75% acrolein and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB; pH 7.4) (\nMilner, 2011\n). The brains were then removed and post-fixed in 2% acrolein and 2% paraformaldehyde in PB for 30 minutes. The brains were cut into 5-mm coronal blocks using a brain mold (Activational Systems Inc., Warren Michigan) and sectioned (40 \u03bcm thick) using a VT1000x Vibratome (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Sections were stored at \u221220\u00b0C in cyroprotectant solution (30% sucrose, 30% ethylene glycol in PB) until immunocytochemical processing (\nMilner, 2011\n).\n\n2.7. Immunocytochemistry\nThe sections were processed for immunoperoxidase labeling using previously described protocols (\nMilner, 2011\n). For this, the sections were washed in PB to remove cryoprotectant. PFC and hippocampal sections from each mouse were marked with punch codes prior to pooling into crucibles. To minimize differences due to immunocytochemical labeling, tissue from animals in the same set were processed together through all procedures (\nPierce et al., 1999\n). However, separate cohorts were run at different times so comparisons were only made between controls and CIH of each group (as described in\n2.3\n).\nThe sections were incubated in 1% sodium borohydride in PB for 30 minutes to remove unbound aldehydes, and subsequently washed in PB until gaseous bubbles disappeared. Next, the sections were washed in 0.1M Tris-saline (TS; pH 7.6) followed by incubation in 0.5% BSA in TS, to block non-specific binding. The sections were then rinsed in TS and then incubated in the GABA (1: 4000 dilution), PARV (1: 20,000 dilution), SOM (1: 8000 dilution), or vGAT (1: 15000 dilution) antibody in 0.1% BSA in TS for 1 day at room temperature (~23\u00b0C), followed by 3\u20134 days cold (~4\u00b0C). The primary antibody diluent for PARV and SOM also included 0.25% Triton-X.\nAfter the allotted 3-4 days, sections were removed from the primary antibody and rinsed with TS. They were then incubated in a biotinylated secondary antibody (GABA: donkey anti-rat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Catalog no. 712-065-150, RRID:AB_2340646); SOM and vGAT: goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Catalog no. 111-065-144, RRID:AB_2337965); PARV: donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Catalog no. 711-506-152, RRID:AB_2616595) diluted 1:400 for 30 minutes. The sections were rinsed with TS and then incubated in avidin-biotin complex (ABC) solution (Vector labs, Burlingame, CA) for 30 minutes, followed by TS washes. The ABC reaction product was visualized with 3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and H\n2\nO\n2\nin TS for 6-12 minutes. Following this, sections were washed in TS followed by PB and mounted in 0.05M PB on 1% gelatin coated glass slides. The sections then were dehydrated through a series of alcohols and xylene and cover slipped using DPX mounting media (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).\n\n2.8. Cell counting\nAn investigator blind to experimental conditions performed cell counts and data analyses. GABA, PARV and SOM cell bodies were quantified in the PL and IL regions of the PFC (between Bregma 1.7 and 1.4) and the dorsal hippocampus (between Bregma \u22122.1 and \u22122.5) (\nPaxinos and Franklin, 2001\n). Labeled cell bodies had clearly recognizable nuclei. The Paxinos and Franklin Mouse Brain Atlas was used to set landmarks, and cells were counted at 10x from a square of equivalent size (5.8 cm x 3.9 cm) for each PFC region and the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus. Cells also were counted in the hilus of the dentate gyrus (DG). For this, labeled cells were counted between the granule cell layers and then the number per unit was determined by dividing by the area of the hilus determined using ImageJ64 (ImageJ, RRID:SCR_003070).\n\n2.9. Densitometry\nDensitometry measurements were taken using previously described methods (\nPierce et al., 2014\n). Images from Regions of Interest (ROI) were taken at 4x magnification on a Nikon eclipse 90i light microscope (RRID: SCR_O15572). Densitometry analyses of GABAergic terminal fields using ImageJ64 were performed on the mPFC, the PL and IL of which were roughly divided into four layers (Paxinos and Franklin atlas between Bregma 1.7 and 1.4). Background was subtracted from an area of tissue lacking immunoreactivity.\n\n2.10. Statistics\nData are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Cohorts were run individually, so comparisons were made between the CIH and control groups of individual cohorts only. All statistical analyses were conducted on JMP 12 Pro software (JMP, RRID:SCR_014242). Significance was determined through one-way ANOVA or Welch t-test for samples with unequal variances (as determined by Levene\u2019s test).\n\n2.11. Figure preparation\nData were unblinded after the final graphs were generated. Adjustments to brightness, contrast and sharpness on the photographs were made in Adobe Photoshop 9.0 (Adobe Photoshop, RRID:SCR_014199) on an iMac prior to importing into PowerPoint 2011, where final adjustments to brightness, contrast and size were made. Illustrations were created in PowerPoint 2011. Graphs were generated using Prism 7 software (Graphpad Prism, RRID:SCR_002798)."

    "Methods": "All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the Institutional Biosafety Committee at Rutgers University. All animal work was conducted in compliance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\n2.1. Transgenic animal\nNotch1CR2-GFP (N1CR2) transgenic mouse line was generated and maintained in our lab (\nTzatzalos et al., 2012\n). Animals of 8\u201312 weeks of age and with equal number of males and females were used for the experiments.\n\n2.2. CHI procedure\nMice 8\u201312 weeks of age were subjected to CHI using the protocol previously described (\nFlierl et al., 2009\n). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 5% Isoflurane for 3\u20135 min (min) and kept under 3% Isoflurane for experimental procedure. The parietal bone was exposed by a midline scalp incision after shaving and cleaning the skin with 3 sets of betadine scrub, followed by 70% ethanol. A free-falling rod (327 g weight) with a blunt tip of 3.0 mm diameter dropped onto mouse skull 3.0 mm anterior to the lambda suture and 2.0 mm lateral to the middle line and the falling height was 3.0 cm over the skull to induce injury without cracking the skull. After surgery, mice were allowed to recover on a heating pad until fully awake.\n\n2.3. Behavior\nMice were evaluated beginning at 1 h (hr) post-CHI using mNSS behavior tests by two blinded, trained observers (\nFlierl et al., 2009\n).\n\n2.4. Tissue preparation\nAt designated time points after injury, animals were euthanized, and brains were removed for tissue processing. Brains were washed in 1\u00d7 PBS, and fixed with 4% (\nw/v\n) PFA for 1 day. Fixed brains were then washed four times with 1\u00d7 PBS before being added to 30% (w/v) sucrose for 1\u20132 days. Next, the brain tissue was embedded in cryopreservation solution (Tissue Tek OCT compound) and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C until cryosectioning.\n\n2.5. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)\nFrozen brain tissue was cryosectioned at 12 \u03bcm using a cryostat (Thermo Shandon Cryostat Cryotome) and air dried. Tissues sections were frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C until staining. Before staining, tissue sections were removed and stored at ambient room temperature for 30 min until beginning procedure. Sections were antigen retrieved with methanol for 10 min at room temperature, blocked and permeabilized for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (10% donkey serum, 0.1% Triton-100, 0.1% Tween 20), then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The next day, samples were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS, then incubated with corresponding fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were washed with PBS, DAPI was added, then slides were dried before adding Cytoseal20 mounting media prior to fluorescent imaging. The primary antibodies used include: GFP (Abcam ab5450), Ki67 (Abcam ab15580), Nestin (Abcam ab6142), Sox2 (Millipore MAB4343), Caspase3 (Cell Signaling 661S), CD68 (Millipore mab1435), Notch1 (Abcam ab8925), DCX (Cell Signaling 4604S), NG2 (Millipore MAB5384), S100b (Abcam ab52642), Olig2 (Millipore AB9610), NeuN (Millipore MAB377), vGlut2 (Abcam ab79157), and GABA (Abcam ab8891).\n\n2.6. Imaging and cell counting\nHorizontal brain sections were imaged with a Zeiss LSM800 microscope for confocal imaging or a Leica DMi8 motorized fluorescence microscope with LED light source for tiled imaging to show a whole or large brain area. Cell counting was performed manually to quantify and compare fluorescence intensity of GFP and cell markers in CHI and sham brain sections. For each marker, 3\u20135 sections from at least 3 animals of each gender were counted at each time point. Since some markers were nuclear and others cytoplasmic, DAPI nuclei staining was necessary to confirm co-expression of markers. All images, under multiple conditions, were taken using the same optical parameters to avoid saturation. The images were acquired and analyzed blindly by a separate analyzer. Data was presented as dot plots, where each dot represents an animal with the average result of \u22653 quantified cryosections from that animal. Statistics was performed on each group and error bars are represented as Mean \u00b1 SEM. For statistical significance, students\nt\n-test was performed with * =\nP\n< .05 significance, ** =\nP\n< .01 significance, *** =\nP\n< .0005 significance, and **** =\nP\n< .0001.\n\n2.7. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)\nFor qPCR, total RNA was extracted from mouse SVZ, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex at specified time points with Tri Reagent. RNA was isolated, and cDNA was synthesized using qSCRIPT cDNA SuperMix. qPCR was performed using the Roche 480 LightCycler platform with SYGR Green FastMix and primers for genes of interest and GAPDH as a reference gene. Analysis was performed using the Livak method (\nLivak and Schmittgen, 2001\n)."

    "Methods": "Electrophysiological tests\nNerve conduction tests in vivo\nNerve conduction tests reliably assess the functional state of sensory and motor myelinated nerve fibers. Methods are minimally invasive (percutaneous small needle electrodes), and thus have the advantage of allowing serial evaluation at desired intervals without killing the animals or disturbing the neuropathy establishment and the further degenerating/regenerating processes. For comparisons over time and between studies, it is important to place the anesthetized animals at regulated body temperature, and use standardized needle electrodes placed under microscope to ensure the same location. The possibility of testing in the same session proximal and distal (nerve and muscle) targets increases the information acquired regarding progression of the neuropathy. The most sensitive tests to detect differences are the conduction tests for distal targets, such as foot muscles and digital or caudal nerves. It is advisable when a new drug-induced neuropathy model is implemented or new drug schedules are tested, to perform both sensory and motor nerve conductions tests, to ensure an accurate characterization of nerve involvement, and to resemble the examination protocols most used in patients, thus facilitating the correlation of results from basic to clinical studies.\nFor nerve conduction tests, an invasive approach with dissection of the tested nerve can be used, but non-invasive methods are preferable since they allow repeated testing the same animals over time (\nNavarro and Udina, 2009\n;\nBruna et al., 2011\n;\nBoehmerle et al., 2014\n). The nerve of interest is directly stimulated with short duration (50\u2013100 \u03bcs) electrical pulses of progressively increasing intensity until the maximal response is recorded, usually delivered with small needle electrodes inserted at a proximal site of the assessed nerve (for instance, sciatic notch and ankle for the sciatic nerve), and the evoked compound nerve action potential (CNAP) may be recorded with small needle electrodes placed also near the distal segment of the nerve. The biphasic potential recorded represents the CNAP of myelinated fibers. Recording needle electrodes are preferred to surface electrodes because they allow for higher resolution to detect the small CNAPs, in the range of microvolts. Small recording needle electrodes can be placed near the tibial nerve at the ankle, the plantar nerves of the hindpaw and the digital nerves of toes for evaluation of the sciatic nerve, near digital nerves of fingers for the median and ulnar nerves, or near the caudal nerves in the tail. The CNAP amplitude correlates with the number of large (A\u03b1\u03b2) myelinated fibers. The latency time, from the stimulus artifact to the onset of the CNAP, is used to derive the conduction velocity of the fastest axons in each nerve segment tested. CNAPs recorded from digital and caudal nerves give a good assessment of the innervation of sensory axons to the most distal skin (\nFig. 1\n), and are among the most sensitive measures to detect neuropathic changes (\nVerd\u00fa et al., 1999\n;\nBruna et al., 2010\n). Orthodromic or antidromic techniques can be used; the latter have the advantage of usually giving larger amplitude of the CNAP. It is worth to note that pure sensory CNAPs can be recorded only from the digital nerves, whereas the caudal nerves are mixed sensory-motor nerves in most of their length except at the very tip. Nevertheless, both motor and sensory caudal nerve conductions can be estimated, since stimulation of the tail root evokes a muscle response, which is preceded by a smaller nerve potential, due to the fastest sensory fibers conducting antidromically (\nLeandri et al., 2007\n). Detailed information on technical issues and electrophysiological methods can be found in previous texts (\nLoeb and Gans, 1986\n;\nNavarro and Udina, 2009\n).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nElectrophysiological recordings of the CMAP from the interosseus plantar muscle (A, D), the CNAPs from the fourth digital nerve (B, E) and from the tail nerve (C, F) in a control mouse (A, B, C) and in a mouse treated with cisplatin (D, E, F). Note the longer latency and the smaller amplitude of the potentials, most evident in the nerve recordings, in the cisplatin-treated mouse compared with the untreated mouse.

The nerve is similarly stimulated with electrical pulses of increasing intensity, and the evoked compound muscle action potential (CMAP) is recorded with needle electrodes placed percutaneously on the target muscles, the active electrode on the muscle belly near the motor point and the reference electrode at the distal tendon. Different muscles located proximal or distal in the limbs and tail can be tested for assessing progression of the motor neuropathy. For example, gastrocnemius and interosseus muscles for the tibial nerve, tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum brevis muscles for the peroneal nerve, flexor carpi and interosseus for the median nerve, tail muscles for the caudal nerves. The amplitude of the CMAP is determined by the number of muscle fibers innervated, and it is the most useful indicator for motor neuropathy assessment. The latency to the CMAP includes the conduction time of the impulse along the nerve and also the transmission time in the neuromuscular junction (\nFig. 1\n). Therefore, the motor nerve conduction velocity can be calculated only in the nerve segment between two sites of stimulation, for example, at the sciatic notch and the ankle for the sciatic-tibial nerve (\nNavarro and Udina, 2009\n).\nMotor unit number estimation (MUNE)\nDespite this is a test not much used in CIPN studies, due to the predominant or exclusive sensory nerve impairment caused by most neurotoxic cytostatic drugs, for some compounds as vincristine and taxanes that induce also motor impairment the MUNE might be useful (\nTaleb et al., 2017\n). An accurate estimation of the number of functional motor units in a muscle can be obtained by using the incremental stimulation technique with the motor nerve conduction setting (\nShefner, 2001\n;\nMancuso et al., 2011\n). Starting from subthreshold intensity, the nerve is stimulated with single electrical pulses of gradually increased intensity until the first response appears, representing the first motor unit recruited. After following stimuli, quantal increases in the response are recorded. The estimated number of motor units results from the equation: MUNE = maximal CMAP / mean amplitude of single motor unit action potential. These methods give good information on the number of functional motoneurons innervating the studied muscle, and their capacity for collateral sprouting that increases the size of reinnervated motor units over normal values. MUNE requires an accurate methodology and some time for testing, but it may add valuable information on models of motor neuropathies and motoneuron diseases.\nMicroneurography\nConventional nerve conduction studies assess mainly the functional state of large myelinated fibers; thus, small fibers involved in nociception, thermal sensation and autonomic functions cannot be assessed, even though they are frequently affected by chemotherapy agents (\nGrisold et al., 2012\n). Microneurography allows overcoming this pitfall. It was first developed in human setting in the 1960s (\nHagbarth and Vallbo, 1968\n;\nVallbo and Hagbarth, 1968\n); despite it never reached a widespread use, given its technical complexity and time-consuming features, it has relevant applications for research and a few groups have translated this technique to the preclinical setting.\nSerra et al. (2010)\nproposed a detailed method to assess unmyelinated C-fibers in rats, targeting alterations underlying neuropathic pain and dysautonomia. Briefly, the anesthetized rat is subjected to sciatic nerve exposure and a microneurography tungsten needle inserted within the nerve. Recording of neural activity, spontaneous and evoked by stimulation under specific protocols, allows to identify different functional types of small nerve fibers and their potential dysfunctions (\nSerra et al., 2012\n). The microneurography procedure can be carried on for 3\u20135 hours if it is a one-time procedure, but if longitudinal monitoring is sought for, less than 3 hours recording allows animal recovery for subsequent procedures. Specialized equipment is required (a shielded cage, micromanipulator for intraneural electrode positioning, special amplifier, appropriate hardware and software settings). The advantage of microneurography in rodents is that it is an in vivo technique and it does not damage axons during the recordings, as happens with single unit nerve recordings (\nFleischer et al., 1983\n;\nKoltzenburg et al., 1997\n). This technique is far more stable than in humans provided that animals are anesthetized, and an open-field setting is possible. The natural situation of the tested nerve is maintained during the recording (i.e., temperature, vascular supply, humidity), and the exposure to active drugs is similar to clinical practice (i.e., the compound active on small fibers is administered per os, intravenous or intraperitoneal, better mimicking the route of administration in clinical practice).\nNerve Excitability Testing\nA technique to test axonal excitability, Nerve Excitability Testing (NET), was developed in the clinical setting in the 1990s (\nBostock et al., 1998\n). NET provides complementary data to nerve conduction studies; in fact, nerve excitability properties reflect many different elements involved in impulse conduction: ion channels and ion pumps activation and ion exchanges (\nBurke et al., 2001\n;\nKiernan et al., 2000\n;\nKrishnan et al., 2008\n). Therefore, NET allows to gain inferences on axonal properties, detection of early functional changes that can precede neuropathy detection by conventional nerve conduction studies. It is not a widely used technique since it has been introduced in the preclinical setting quite recently and it requires specialized equipment (hardware and setting), software and a trained examiner. For NET recordings a non-invasive montage is required, similar to that of conventional nerve conduction tests, apart from the use of non-polarizable electrodes for the stimulating dipole. A dedicated software and hardware are used; the TROND protocol, a semi-automated computer-controlled protocol, is available in the Qtrac\u00ae software (\nKiernan et al., 2000\n,\n2001\n). TROND protocol allows to obtain multiple excitability parameters that can be used to define both early neuropathy signs and to identify pathogenetic mechanisms, useful to drive future drug discovery in this field. Regarding CIPN, NET has been mainly used to test patients with alterations due to oxaliplatin administration. These studies showed alterations compatible with axonal hyperexcitability (\nPark et al., 2009\n) and slowed sodium voltage operated channels activation (\nHeide et al., 2018\n), thus confirming the potential role of NET in CIPN pathogenetic studies. NET has been successfully performed both in rats (\nYang et al., 2000\n;\nGeorge and Bostock, 2007\n;\nArnold et al., 2017\n) and in mice (\nBo\u00ebrio et al., 2009\n,\n2010\n) in models of neuropathy other than CIPN. Recently\nAlberti et al. (2019)\nused NET in a rat model of oxaliplatin neuropathy, demonstrating not only the presence of axonal hyperexcitability but also that modulating alterations seen in NET resulted in neuroprotection.\nElectrophysiological evaluation of reflex circuits\nElectrophysiological methods are useful for the quantitative assessment of the spinal reflex circuits and their dysfunctions. Testing monosynaptic H and polysynaptic withdrawal reflexes are valuable for the investigation of secondary alterations to peripheral nerve injuries, such as neuropathic pain and neuronal hyperexcitability. The\nH reflex\nrepresents the equivalent electrophysiological response to the functional stretch reflex. The H wave can be easily recorded when performing motor nerve conduction tests. Following stimulation to a motor or mixed nerve, the recording on the target muscle shows a short-latency direct CMAP or M wave, elicited by activation of the A\u03b1 motor fibers at the site of stimulation, followed by a late response, the reflex H wave, due to stimulation of the large Ia proprioceptive sensory fibers that conduct the impulse to the spinal cord where they synapse with the \u03b1-motoneurons and part of them are excited to conduct impulses to the muscle. In rodents the H wave is evoked at low threshold similar to the M wave and, unlike in humans, it is consistently maintained even when delivering high intensity stimuli, although it may slightly decrease in amplitude at supramaximal stimulus for the M wave (\nMeinck, 1976\n;\nValero-Cabr\u00e9 and Navarro, 2001\n). The H wave amplitude provides an indirect measure of the efficacy of transmission between Ia sensory fibers and \u03b1-motoneurons, and of the excitability of the motoneuron pool (\nValero-Cabr\u00e9 and Navarro, 2001\n;\nEnglish et al., 2007\n). The H wave latency may be used to assess the central conduction time (H latency \u2013 M latency), and to derive the conduction velocity of sensory Ia proprioceptive fibers. This neurophysiological parameter has been used in the characterization and to assess neuroprotective strategies in cisplatin, vincristine and taxanes models (\nDe Koning et al., 1987\n;\nCliffer et al., 1998\n;\nJa\u2019afer et al., 2006\n;\nCallizot et al., 2008\n). Evaluation of the full\nstretch reflex\nby stretch applied to the muscle tendons can be also of interest in CIPN experimental paradigms, but it is quite more complex to apply (\nGoldstein et al., 1981\n).\nThe functional status of the facial and trigeminal nerves can be evaluated using the blink reflex (\nTerrell and Terzis, 1994\n), paralleling the electrophysiological test utilized in human patients. There is increasing evidence of impairment of corneal innervation in patients under chemotherapy treatment (\nArgyriou et al., 2019\n) and also in paclitaxel animal model (\nFerrari et al., 2013\n) assessed by corneal confocal microscopy. Thus, blink reflex can be an alternative to monitor the functional involvement of trigeminal nerve fibers in CIPN.\n\nFunctional motor tests\nRotarod test\nThe rotarod test is a broadly used method that allows to assess general sensory-motor function and coordination. The animals are placed on the rod of a rotarod apparatus, which is made to rotate either at a fixed rate (5\u201320 rpm) or at accelerating rate (0 to 40 rpm), until the animals are unable to maintain themselves on the rod and fall off. The time or the maximal rate of maintenance on the turning rod is measured. Animals have to be trained for several days before starting the study, and then tested at regular intervals to ensure consistent performance, since performance in the test is affected by learning during initial trials. To prevent visual information and thus to enhance the role of proprioceptive input, the rotarod test may be performed in the dark (\nApfel et al., 1992\n). However, the rotarod is not a specific test, since abnormalities can be due to sensory or motor nerve dysfunction but also to central alterations of coordination and strength. The rotarod has been shown useful for the study of animal models of peripheral neuropathies (\nApfel et al., 1992\n;\nRustay et al., 2003\n;\nCallizot et al., 2008\n;\nBruna et al., 2010\n;\nBruna et al., 2011\n) and is commonly applied in motoneuron disease models (\nMiana-Mena et al., 2005\n). It has been noted that certain animal strains are not testable on the rotarod due to their propensity to jump from the rod instead of running on it. Variable conditions have been reported in the literature, and the optimal parameters (e.g. rotation speed and acceleration) need to be defined for each condition (\nRustay et al., 2003\n).\nGait and kinematic analyses\nThe analysis of the walking pattern by recording the footprints is a well-established and widely employed method for the assessment of motor recovery after nerve injuries, mostly of the sciatic nerve. The plantar surface of the hindpaws is painted (with ink or other means) and the animal allowed to walk along a narrow track. Then, measures of the footprints length and toes spreading are taken to derive the sciatic functional index (SFI) (\nDe Medinaceli et al., 1982\n;\nBain et al., 1989\n). However, its use in the CIPN field is anecdotal (\nTassler et al., 2000\n). Taken into account the disappointing results obtained in the traumatic or surgical nerve injury models (\nVarejao et al., 2004\n;\nNavarro, 2016\n) and the lack of reports, the usefulness of this test in the evaluation of CIPN models is more than uncertain.\nIn order to overcome some of the frequent problems found in hard prints of the rat/mouse feet, video recordings of the walking animal were introduced, and analysis expanded to the gait kinematics. Rats are recorded walking in a transparent runway with a camera placed under the runway or at the side. The video recordings enable analysis of quantitative gait parameters (stride length, stance and swing phase duration, ankle angle) as well as kinematic reconstructions of paw excursion. Commercially computerized systems (CatWalk\u00ae, DigiGait\u00ae) are available allowing a quantitative assessment of both dynamic and static gait changes associated with nerve injuries and diseases. The most relevant disturbances observed in CIPN models are increases in the swing walk phase and decreases in the stance walk phase and the print area of hind paws (\nHuehnchen et al., 2013\n;\nBoehmerle et al., 2014\n). Discriminant models using kinematics data of ankle, knee and hip joints revealed high sensitivity and specificity to identify denervated versus reinnervated and control animals although such analysis has not been applied to neuropathies (\nAmado et al., 2011\n).\n\nFunctional sensory tests\nPinprick test for assessing innervation of the skin\nRecovery of pain sensitivity can be tested on awake animals by light pricking with a blunt needle at several distal points on the skin of the projection territory of the nerve under study. For example, after injuries to the sciatic nerve, six delineated areas of the plantar skin are tested, from the ankle to the tip of the toes (\nNavarro et al., 1994\n;\nCobianchi et al., 2014\n). Each site is stimulated two or three times, and responses are recorded as positive only when clear reaction of limb withdrawal and vocalization appear. A pinprick score can be constructed by addition of the graded response in each delimited area (\nNavarro et al., 1994\n). Given the discrete area that is stimulated for each pinprick, this test is useful to assess hyperalgesia, progression of skin denervation with time, and to map the denervated territory (\nCobianchi et al., 2014\n;\nVashistha et al., 2017\n;\nKaur and Muthuraman, 2019\n).\nAlgesimetry tests\nAlgesimetry tests are mainly used to assess hypersensitivity in neuropathic or inflammatory pain models. However, the same behavioral tests are useful to evaluate the decrease of innervation by different modalities of nociceptive sensory neurons in neuropathies.\nMechanical algesimetry is mostly tested using von Frey filaments (\nChaplan et al., 1994\n) or von Frey electronic devices (\nCasals-Diaz et al., 2009\n). Animals are placed on a wire net platform in plastic chambers and habituated. Then, von Frey calibrated filaments or the probe of the electronic device is gently applied to a test site in the plantar surface of the fore- or hind-paw, increasing the pressure (\nFig. 2A\n\u2013\nB\n). The nociceptive threshold is expressed as the force at which the animal withdraws the paw in response to the stimulus. The modified Randall-Selitto test can be also applied to test pressure-induced pain. An increasing amount of pressure with a pointed probe is exerted to the animal paw and the amount of force needed for withdrawal or vocalization is the withdrawal threshold (in grams) (\nAnseloni et al., 2003\n;\nSantos-Nogueira et al., 2012\n). This test may assess nociceptors in deeper tissues.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nPain sensibility tests. A. An electronic Von Frey device for the mechanical algesimetry test. B. Image of the stimulation with the tip of the Von Frey probe pressing the lateral side of the sole. Note the different position of the intact paw (top) and the denervated paw (bottom) of the rat. C. Plantar algesimetry apparatus for the hot algesimetry test. D. Image of rat being stimulated with the hot light beam under the paw. Reproduced with permission from Navarro, Eur. J. Neurosci. 2016; 43:271\u2013286.\nThermal algesimetry tests use a radiant heat source (\nHargreaves et al., 1988\n). The animal is placed into a plastic box with an elevated glass floor. The beam of the lamp probe is focused on the paw plantar surface, until the animal withdraws the paw, and sensors in the device shut off the lamp (\nFig. 2D\n\u2013\nE\n). The threshold is defined as the latency time until withdrawal. Other devices that can be also used for the same type of evaluation include the hot plate and tail-flick tests.\nFor cold algesimetry the animal is placed into a similar box on a wire mesh platform. A small pointed ice probe is applied directly on the plantar surface of both hindpaws (\nLindsey et al., 2000\n) or a drop of acetone deposited, and the withdrawal latency measured with a time-meter. The cold plate can be also used, although it exposes the four paws to cool, and it has been pointed out in some studies that cold temperature exposure does not appear to evoke \u201cpain\u201d in uninjured animals, making difficult the interpretation of hyperalgesia (\nTa et al., 2009\n). Responses to cold result more variable than those to heat and pressure in rodents as well as in human subjects (\nNavarro and Kennedy, 1991\n;\nGaltrey and Fawcett, 2007\n;\nCasals-Diaz et al., 2009\n) so the cold testing has more problems in interpretation (\nHama and Takamatsu, 2016\n).\nTo reduce the variability in testing conditions, the withdrawal responses are recorded at least in triplicate, with minutes between stimuli, for one or both paws at each testing day, and the mean of the values used for calculating the percentage of the experimental vs the control group tested in parallel. Using these tests, the accompanying vocalization or paw lick should be monitored in order to further assess whether foot withdrawal is due to a painful stimulus (\nKemp et al., 2011\n). It is important to note that algesimetry results are indicative of a reduced withdrawal threshold, and not directly of pain, which is a subjective sensation. The lowered withdrawal response in models of CIPN is attributed to sensitization of nociceptors to mechanical and thermal stimuli, although an important part of these reports use short or very short schedules of drug administration. The most commonly described results in rats and mice receiving different chemotherapeutic agents have been mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia (\nHama and Takamatsu, 2016\n). Nevertheless, later in the course increased thresholds evidencing hypoalgesia due to skin denervation may appear. Thus, controversial results are expected in the literature depending upon drug exposure and time, but also biased testing. The mechanical algesimetry and the thermal algesimetry methods can give similar results or sometimes diverging results, depending on the particular involvement of the different populations of primary nociceptive neurons (\nVerd\u00fa et al., 1999\n;\nAuthier et al., 2000\n;\nDina et al., 2001\n;\nTa et al., 2009\n).\nConditioned Place Preference\nThe ability to measure the affective component of pain and pain relief using the Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) procedure is an interesting recent progress in the evaluation of animal models of pain. CPP allows to measure the non-evoked spontaneous or ongoing component of neuropathic pain. Pairing a rewarding experience with a distinctive environment increases the time spent in that environment (\nNavratilova and Porreca, 2014\n). This is an important procedure for testing potential treatments that alleviate pain in CIPN rodent models. Drugs that are not rewarding in the absence of pain (or at least at doses that do not activate reward pathways) become rewarding in the presence of CIPN since they improve pain sensation (\nPark et al., 2013\n;\nToma et al., 2019\n).\n\nFunctional autonomic tests\nSweat gland function tests\nThese tests allow evaluating the sympathetic sudomotor function non-invasively in diverse animal models. Sweating is stimulated by cholinergic stimulation with pilocarpine or by thermal stimulation heating the animal body. Then, a silicone material is spread over the plantar surface of the paw; as the silicone hardens, it retains the impressions caused by the sweat droplets emerging from each sweat duct. The silicone mold is viewed under a dissecting microscope using transmitted light to count the number of sweat impressions (\nNavarro and Kennedy, 1989\n). Denervated sweat glands do not secrete, so the number and volume of the sweat impressions are reliable measures of loss of sympathetic axons (\nBharali et al., 1988\n,\nNavarro and Kennedy, 1989\n). Despite its use is not much extended in the CIPN assessment, it has been employed in the characterization of cisplatin (\nVilches et al., 1998\n) and bortezomib (\nBruna et al., 2010\n) induced neuropathies in mice. A variation using iodine paper to record the sweat secretion has been also used in diabetic neuropathy studies (\nLiu et al., 2017\n).\nHeart rate variability tests\nHeart rate variability, which is influenced by the activity and balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiac sinus innervation, is an extended non-invasive measure to assess autonomic neuropathy in patients. However, its use in rodent models carry important difficulties, such as the high heart rate and frequent recording artifacts. Most reports come from the cardiology field and show discrepancies about the analysis and recording methodology (Thireau et al., 2007). Most works use 24h continuous electrocardiogram recordings, and the telemetry device requires surgery for subcutaneous implanting teletransmitters. More practical for testing in CIPN models are the protocols involving short time recording periods in the study of rodent R-R variability (\nGehrmann et al., 2000\n). After propranolol and atropine-induced conduction blocks, the parasympathetic innervation is the main responsible of the R-R variability in mice. Thus, this technique could be useful to study the parasympathetic branch in autonomic neuropathy. However, this type of tests has been scarcely attempted in CIPN experimental models (\nBruna et al., 2010\n)."

(\nZhu et al., 2002\n). Chemical characterization confirmed the structure of the desired agent in high purity (> 99%). PFT-\u03bc (2-phenylethynesulfonamide) was obtained from Millipore Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Chemical characterization confirmed the structure with > 97% purity. Both agents were prepared freshly in 100% DMSO (Millipore Sigma) immediately prior to use and diluted with physiological saline.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nPost-injury administration of PFT-\u03b1 or PFT-\u03bc at 5 h after TBI significantly reduced contusion volume at 24 h.

Animal model of TBI using a controlled cortical impactor (CCI)\nAll animals were treated in accordance with international guidelines for animal research, and the study design was approved by the animal ethics committee of Taipei Medical University (protocol # LAC-2015\u20130051). Animals were housed in groups in a temperature- (21\u201325 \u00b0C) and humidity (45%~50%)-controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle and ad libitum access to pellet chow and water. A CCI was used to produce TBI in rats as previously described (\nYang et al., 2015\n;\nWang et al., 2016\n). All animals were randomized into four groups (sham, TBI + veh (veh, 0.1% DMSO in saline), TBI + PFT\u03bc, and TBI + PFT-\u03b1). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250\u2013300 g body weight) were anesthetized (2.5% isoflurane) and placed in a stereotaxic frame. A 5-mm craniotomy was performed over the left parietal cortex, centered on the coronal suture and 3.5 mm lateral to the sagittal suture. Injury was made using a CCI instrument with a rounded metal tip (5 mm in diameter). A velocity of 4 m/s and a deformation depth of 2 mm below the dura were used as we previously described (\nChen et al., 2007\n). Sham animals received anesthesia and a craniotomy but no TBI. The body temperature was monitored throughout the surgery with a rectal probe; it was maintained at 37 \u00b0C using a heating pad. Rats were placed in a heated cage to maintain their body temperature while recovering from anesthesia. Our selected treatment time of 5 h and dosage (PFT\u03b1 or PFT\u03bc 2 mg/kg intravenous injection) were based on our prior study indicating that the secondary phase of neuronal injury following TBI can be attenuated if appropriate treatment is initiated within this time window (\nYang et al., 2015\n). The body temperature was monitored in TBI animals following vehicle, PFT-\u03b1 and PFT-\u03bc group treatment over a period of 3 h, as well as in our previous study (\nYang et al., 2015\n).\n\n2.3. Behavioral evaluation of neurological outcome\nBeam walking test, modified neurological severity scores (mNSS), swing test and tactile adhesive-removal test were performed to compare functional outcomes in sham or TBI rats treated with vehicle or PFT-\u03b1 or PFT-\u03bc (2 mg/kg i.v.) (\nHsueh et al., 2019\n). All behavioral tests were performed by an observer blinded to the experimental groups before CCI and at 24 h after CCI, as described in our previous publications. Overall motor activity was measured in automated chambers, as in our prior studies (\nYang et al., 2015\n). To compare neurological deficit severity in TBI rats, a mNSS (a composite of motor, sensory, reflex and balance tests) was performed (\nChen et al., 2008\n). One point was scored for inability to perform the test or for the lack of a tested reflex; thus, the higher the score, the more severe the injury. Neurological function was graded on a scale of 0\u201318 (normal score: 0; maximal deficit score: 18) (\nAlder et al., 2011\n). The tactile removal test was used to evaluate somatosensory function. Two small adhesive-backed stickers are used as bilateral tactile stimuli that are placed on the distal\u2013radial region on the wrist of each forelimb (\nChen et al., 2008\n). Rats were pre-trained daily for 3 days before CCI. The time required (not to exceed 180 s) for the rats to remove the sticker from the forelimb was recorded.\n\n2.4. Fluoro Jade C (FJC) staining\nFJC, a derivative of polyanionic fluorescein, selectively binds to degenerating neurons. We used an FJC ready-to-dilute staining kit (TR-100-FJ, Biosensis) to identify degenerating neuronal cells according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol with some modifications. After behavioral evaluation, rats were deeply anesthetized by Zoletil (20\u201340 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused through the left ventricle with cold saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde fixative. The brains were immediately removed, and postfixed for 24 h in the same fixative at 4 \u00b0C for paraffin sections. The 4\n\u03bc\nm coronal sections were prepared for staining (cresyl violet, immunohistochemical, immunofluorescent or FJC staining). Other sets of animals were guillotine decapitated after deep anesthesia for brain dissections for biochemical measurement. Brain sections from the different treatment groups were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and incubated in distilled water for 2 min. These sections were then incubated in a solution of potassium permanganate (1:15) for 10 min, rinsed in distilled water for 2 min, and then incubated in the FJC solution (1:25) for 30 min. After incubation, sections were washed and mounted on coverslips with Vecta-shield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). All sections were observed and photographed using a fluorescent inverted microscope (IX70, Olympus, Japan). The numbers of FJC-positive cells were thereafter counted in three randomly selected fields per slide by means of SPOT image analysis software (Diagnostic Instruments). Finally, the numbers of FJC-positive cells observed on the slides from different treatment groups were counted and used to generate a mean number per treatment group.\n\n2.5. Quantification of contusion volume\nContusion volume measurement was performed as previously described (\nChen et al., 2007\n). Specifically, cresyl violet was used to measure contusion volume, by staining the sections followed by digitization and analysis using a 1\u00d7 objective and a computer image analysis system (ImageJ 1.8 software, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Contusion area was calculated from all images of cresyl violet-stained sections that contained contused brain. Hemisphere tissue loss was expressed as a percent calculated by (contralateral minus ipsilateral hemispheric volumes) / (contralateral hemispheric volume) \u00d7 100%, as previously reported (\nZhang et al., 1998\n).\n\n2.6. Measurement of mRNA levels\nLevels of mRNA encoding for p53, HO-1, SOD1, SOD2, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and PINK1 genes were measured by reverse transcription followed by real time-PCR from TBI without or with PFT-\u03b1 / PFT-\u03bc treatment.\nTotal RNA was extracted from brain tissues using the TRIzol\n\u00ae\nreagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland). Total RNA (3 \u03bcg) was reverse-transcribed into complimentary (c)DNA using the ReverTra Ace-\u03b1 First-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Toyobo Life Science, Japan). The resulting cDNA was incubated with a Rotor-Gene SYBR Green kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and appropriate primers.\nHO-1, 5\u2032- GAGATAGAGCGAAACAAGCAGAAC-3\u2032 (forward) and.\n5\u2032-CATACCAGAAGGCCAATGTCCTG-3\u2032 (reverse);\np53, 5\u2032- CCATGGCCATCTACAAGAAGT-3\u2032 (forward) and.\n5\u2032-TGTCGTCCAGATACTCAGCATA-3\u2032 (reverse);\nPINK1, 5\u2032- CTGTCAGGAGATCCAGGCAATT \u22123\u2032 (forward) and.\n5\u2032- GCATGGTGGCTTCATACACAGC-3\u2032 (reverse);\nIL-6, 5\u2032-TTCTTGGGACTGATGTTGTTGAC-3\u2032 (forward) and.\n5\u2032-AATTAAGCCTCCGACTTGTGAAG-3\u2032 (reverse);\nIL-1\u03b2, 5\u2032-GTTTGAGTCTGCACAGTTCCC-3\u2032 (forward) and.\n5\u2032-CAACTATGTCCCGACCATTGC-3\u2032 (reverse);\nSOD1, 5\u2032-CGGCTTCTGTCGTCTCCTTGC-3\u2032 (forward) and.\n5\u2032-GTTCACCGCTTGCCTTCTGC-3\u2032 (reverse);\nSOD2, 5\u2032-ACGCGACCTACGTGAACAATCT-3\u2032 (forward) and.\n5\u2032-CAGTGCAGGCTGAAGAGCAA-3\u2032 (reverse);\n\u03b2-actin, 5\u2032-GACCCAGATCATGTTTGAGACCTTC-3\u2032 (forward) and.\n5\u2032-GGTGACCGTAACACTACCTGAG-3\u2032 (reverse). The comparative threshold cycle (Ct) value of the \u03b2-actin gene was used as reference. Relative transcript expression of mRNA levels was calculated by the Ct method.\n\n2.7. Immunofluorescence: double immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against NeuN, HO-1, Annexin V, p62, 4-HNE, and LC3\nCoronal sections (10 \u03bcm) were obtained from the anterior area of the left hemisphere. Sections were dried, rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and rinsed in PBS. Sections were blocked for 60 min in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA, PBS containing 5% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies. These were either mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN antibody (Millipore; 1:500, NeuN is a neuronal marker)/rabbit polyclonal anti-HO-1 antibody (Enzo Life Sciences; 1:200)/rabbit polyclonal anti- annexin V (Abcam; 1:500), / rabbit polyclonal anti-4-HNE (Abcam; 1:250), / rabbit polyclonal anti-p62 (Abgent; 1:200), / mouse monoclonal anti-LC3 (Genetex; 1:200) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Thereafter, incubation with a secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor\n\u00ae\n488 goat anti-rabbit/anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) or Alexa Fluor\n\u00ae\n594 goat anti-rabbit/anti-mouse IgG; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA; 1:250) was undertaken for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were mounted with mounting medium H-1000 (Vector Laboratories). Immunofluorescence images were viewed using an inverted Olympus IX 70 microscope equipped with a cooled CCD camera and SPOT advanced software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI, USA). Images (in three randomly selected fields within the calibrated area which is the same as indicated by the black square box in\nFig. 3C\n) were captured as digital micrographs and counted. Background control sections were evaluated in which primary antibody was omitted. Notably, sections from the four animal groups were incubated with antibodies in the same chamber or well.\nFig. 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nPost-injury administration of PFT-\u03bc at 5 h after TBI significantly decreased FJC-positive cells at 24 h.

    "Methods": "2.1.1. Animals\nCNP-aSyn (B6:C3-Tg-CNP-SNCA-M2Vle) breeders were generously provided by Dr. Virginia Lee (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) (\nGiasson et al., 2003\n;\nYazawa et al., 2005\n) from a repository at the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Non-littermate heterozygous CNP-aSyn breeders (N = 6, 4 females, 2 males) were used to generate our cohort of male and female Tg and WT littermates for our studies. Heterozygous and homozygous Tg mice express one or two copies of WT human\nSNCA\n, respectively, driven by the CNP promoter to express aSyn in myelinating oligodendrocytes of CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) Schwann cells (\nGiasson et al., 2003\n;\nYazawa et al., 2005\n). Mice were housed (2 \u2013 5 per group) in barrier cages on ventilated racks in pathogen free rooms with temperature and humidity-control on 12 hr light/dark cycles. Food and water were available\nad libitum\n. Ethical treatment of animals followed AALAC, ARRIVE, and NIH guidelines on Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved breeding and experimental protocols. CNP-aSyn Tg mice and WT littermates were randomly assigned to groups (Research Randomizer,\nhttps://www.randomizer.org\n) with mice and data assessed by experimenters blinded to the conditions.\n2.1.2. Genotyping\nUsing the protocol kindly provided by Ms. Susan Leight of Dr. Virginia Lee\u2019s laboratory, genomic DNA from pups was used to measure human\nSNCA\ncopy number by real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) with the following primers SNCA Fwd: 5\u2019-GGAGCAGGGAGCATTGCA-3\u2019 and SNCA Rev: 5\u2019-CCTTCTTCATTCTTGCCCAACT-3\u2019. Murine\nGapdh\ngene was used as an endogenous control, with levels detected by the following primers Gapdh Fwd: 5\u2019-CCTGCTCCCCCTACACACA-3\u2019 and Gapdh Rev: 5\u2019-CCTGTTCTTCTCGGGCAAAA-3\u2019, with qPCR performed using the RealPlex Mastercycler 2 (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY) and GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Cat # A6001, Promega, Madison, WI). Thermal qPCR conditions were: pre-PCR hold for 1 min at 60\u00b0C, pre-PCR hold for 10 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec each at 95\u00b0C then 1 min at 60\u00b0C followed by fluorescence emission detection. Levels of human\nSNCA\nand murine\nGapdh\nwere quantified and compared to one of the heterozygous Tg CNP-aSyn breeders originally provided by Jackson Laboratories. Relative fold changes of human SNCA were determined by the comparative cycle threshold method (2-\n\u0394\u0394\nCt) and interpreted as follows: 0 = WT, 1 = Tg heterozygous CNP-aSyn and \u22652 = Tg homozygous CNP-aSyn.\n\n2.2. FTY720-Mitoxy is stable and accumulates in mitochondria\nLiquid chromatography (LC) separates compounds on a column, and then spectrometry (MS) is used to measures the mass of the compound, which for FTY720-Mitoxy produced a single peak, confirming that no breakdown of the compound occurred (\nEnoru et al., 2016\n). LC/MS/MS assessed FTY720-Mitoxy stability for a sample that was aged 3 yr at \u221220\u00b0C and compared to freshly prepared FTY720-Mitoxy in solution. Both had single peaks (\nFig. 1b\n, top and middle chromatograms), confirming long term stability of the drug. To test FTY720-Mitoxy stability at body temperature, drug was prepared in lactated Ringer\u2019s solution then incubated at 37\u00b0C in sterile O-ring tubes for 42 days (the lifetime of Alzet Model 2006 pump). Tubes were spun to collect full samples for physiological evaluation of FTY720-Mitoxy effects on PP2A enzymatic activity in MN9D cells (\nVargas-Medrano et al., 2014\n). Briefly, cells were treated 30 min with Vehicle, 5 \u03bcM of FTY720, fresh FTY720-Mitoxy, or the 42 day aged FTY720-Mitoxy. Cells were prepared as before (Peng et al., 2005) with protein concentration determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (\nSmith et al., 1985\n). Using 150 \u03bcg of cell lysate per sample, PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) was immunoprecipitated from lysates using anti-PP2Ac antibody 1D6 (Cat # 05\u2013421, EMD Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) + protein A beads (Cat # 20333, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Activity of immunoprecipitated PP2Ac was then measured relative to freshly prepared standards using the malachite green assay as before (\nLek et al., 2017\n;\nVargas-Medrano et al., 2014\n) with samples read at 630 nm (Multiskan Spectrum, ThermoFisher Scientific) (\nFig. 1c\n).\nFigure 1. FTY720-Mitoxy is stable in solution, present in mitochondria, and retains activity after long term freezer storage or 42 days at body temperature.\nOpen in a new tab\n(a)\nChemical structures of FTY720 and FTY720-Mitoxy.\n(b)\nLC-MS/MS shows single peaks, indicating single compounds purified by LC with similar retention times, confirming FTY720-Mitoxy stability when Freshly Prepared, stored 3 years at \u221220\u00b0C, or in mitochondria from FTY720-Mitoxy treated MN9D cells.\n(c)\nPP2A immunoprecipitated from MN9D cells treated with FTY720 or FTY720-Mitoxy, show similar activation of PP2A in response to fresh FTY720, fresh FTY720-Mitoxy, and FTY720-Mitoxy aged 42 day at 37\u00b0C compared to Vehicle.\n(d)\nTimeline of behavioral assessment and osmotic pump implantation for delivery of Vehicle or FTY720-Mitoxy. Two way repeated measures (RM) ANOVA, * p < .05, ** p < .01.\nFTY720-Mitoxy, though not orally bioavailable, rapidly crosses the blood brain barrier (\nEnoru et al., 2016\n) and protects both neuronal and oligodendrocyte cells (\nSegura-Ulate et al., 2017b\n;\nVargas-Medrano et al., 2014\n;\nVargas-Medrano et al., 2019\n;\nVargas-Medrano et al., 2018\n). Briefly, MN9D cells were treated 30 min with 5 \u03bcM FTY720-Mitoxy, a dose that is within a linear range for stimulating PP2A activity when compared to aSyn in dose response experiments (see\nFigs. 1\nand\n4\nof\nVargas-Medrano et al, 2014\nfor details). Mitochondria were isolated using a kit (Cat# 89874, ThermoFisher Scientific) and validated to be mitochondria as those samples contained heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) and cyclooxygenase 4 (COX4) that were not present in cytosol of MN9D cells (not shown). LC/MS/MS of MN9D mitochondria was performed by Ricerca Biosciences LLC (now Concord Biosciences LLC, a Frontage Company, Concord, OH, USA) which confirmed that intact FTY720-Mitoxy was present in mitochondria (\nFig. 1b\n, bottom chromatogram).\nFigure 4. FTY720-Mitoxy improves sweat function in CNP-aSyn Tg MSA mice.\nOpen in a new tab\nThe iodine starch test labels sweat droplets as purple dots on the paw at the 5 min time point.\n(a)\nRepresentative images of 11.5 mo old CNP-aSyn Tg mouse treated with Vehicle shows fewer sweat droplets (upper image) than a Tg mouse treated with FTY720-Mitoxy (lower image) with the main paw area outlined.\n(b)\nQuantification of sweat droplet signal shows more sweat in Tg mice treated with FTY720-Mitoxy as compared to Vehicle treated Tg littermates, and a non-significant trend noted in WT mice treated with FTY720-Mitoxy.

(\nd\n) Analysis of mRNA using qPCR shows no difference in GDNF, NGF, or RET mRNA of Tg mice compared to WT Vehicle baseline (left side). In Tg mice compared to Tg Vehicle baseline RET mRNA is significantly increased (right side). The qPCR data were analyzed with REST-2009 suite as detailed in Materials and methods, *** p < .001.\n\n2.3. Subcutaneous drug delivery by osmotic pump\nFTY720-Mitoxy synthesis and pharmacokinetics have been described (\nEnoru et al., 2016\n;\nVargas-Medrano et al., 2014\n). Intravenously delivered FTY720-Mitoxy enters brain in 5 min and is present in brain for at least 48 hr (\nEnoru et al., 2016\n). A stock solution of 150 mM FTY720-Mitoxy was prepared in 200 proof ethanol, then dissolved in Ringer\u2019s lactate solution (Cat # sc-516304 Rx, Santa Cruz Animal Health, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Mice received FTY720-Mitoxy (1.1 mg/kg/day) by continuous release using Model 2006 pumps from Alzet Corporation (Cupertino, CA, USA) for 84 days. Pumps containing FTY720-Mitoxy or Vehicle were subcutaneously implanted through an incision between the scapulae of WT or CNP-aSyn Tg mice (8.5 mo, \u2265 20 gm weight) under general anesthesia. During recovery, pumps move from a dorsomedial to a lateral position on the animal\u2019s back, which still allows normal movement for behavioral tests. The pump life of Model 2006 is 42 days, so after 42 days, a second pump was implanted to deliver drug to 11.5 mo according to the time line shown (\nFig. 1d\n). In separate experiments to assess the impact of FTY720-Mitoxy on mitochondria\nin vivo\n, we used Alzet pumps (Model 2002) to deliver FTY720-Mitoxy for 14 days with Vehicle or 3NP given as described below.\n\n2.4. Behavioral analysis\nBehavioral tests were performed at 6 mo, 8 mo, 10 mo and 11.5 mo. Experiments were conducted in clean quiet test rooms at Texas Tech University Health Science Center Laboratory Animal Resources Center (LARC). Animals were transferred to test rooms at least 15 min before to allow them to acclimate to the novel environment prior to testing.\n2.4.1. Movement\nBalance and coordination were measured by rotarod (Cat # LE8200, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), which also measures endurance in N = 138 mice, (WT = 68, Tg = 70). Rotarod timing as \u201clatency to fall\u201d from the apparatus was recorded in sec using established methods (\nGiasson et al., 2002\n;\nGraham and Sidhu, 2010\n). Briefly, mice were familiarized with the rotarod during initial trainings of 2 sessions on 2 consecutive days. Each training session consisted of 2 runs lasting 2 min each, one at 4 revolutions per min (rpm) and the other at 8 rpm. Experimental data were collected in 3 runs/day on 2 different days for each mouse, with rotation increasing from 4\u201340 rpm over 5 min time. A minimum 5 min rest period was allowed between runs for all mice.\n2.4.2. Sweat analysis\nAs a measure of autonomic injury consistent with MSA, sweat droplets were measured by the method of Liu, et al. (2017) with minor modifications in N = 41 mice, (WT = 19, Tg = 32). Briefly, mice were gently and firmly manually restrained by one experimenter throughout each test. Another experimenter cleaned the left hind paw with a water-moistened cotton tipped swab. Then the second experimenter painted the hind paw using a small artist brush dipped in a freshly prepared solution of 2% iodine (Cat # 207772, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) prepared in ethanol. After the paw had dried, it was then painted with a starch solution prepared in castor oil (1g/mL, Cat # S9765 in Cat # 259853, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The paw was then photographed through a 10X magnifier lens at 0, 2.5 and 5 min to record dark purple precipitates that formed. Digital images were then blind coded and analyzed using ImageQuant 5.2 software (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) to quantify sweat droplets in arbitrary units on the main area of the paw (outlined areas shown in\nFig. 4a\n) overlying the eccrine sweat glands. Sweat drops on the digits were not included in the quantification.\n\n2.5. Evaluation of mitochondrial toxin 3NP \u00b1 FTY720-Mitoxy in WT and Tg mice\nOsmotic pumps with FTY720-Mitoxy in Ringer\u2019s lactate delivered 1.1 mg/kg/day to 8.5 mo old WT or CNP-aSyn Tg mice from day 0 to 14 (time span of Alzet model 2002 pump) in N = 24 mice, (WT = 8, Tg = 16). The 3NP toxin (Cat # N5634, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), an inhibitor of mitochondrial SDH, also known as mitochondrial Complex II (\nScallet et al., 2001\n), was prepared in sterile saline (pH 7.4). Vehicle consisted of an equal volume of sterile saline. On day 9.5, mice received twice daily subcutaneous injections of 3NP using methods previously used in MSA mice (\nUbhi et al., 2009\n) as follows: 10 mg/kg (day 9.5), 20 mg/kg (days 11 and 12), and 30 mg/kg (days 13 and 14) or Vehicle control solution.\n\n2.6. Tissue collection and handling\nMice were euthanized by CO\n2\ninhalation followed by decapitation. Tissues for protein and/or RNA were rapidly collected and included brain, spinal cord, paw sweat pads, and soleus muscles. Most tissues were frozen on dry ice then stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. For total RNA, fresh tissues were submerged in RNA-later solution (Cat # AM7020, ThermoFisher Scientific) then incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight prior to transfer to \u221220\u00b0C for storage, as per manufacturer. Some RNA extractions were performed using tissues stored at \u221280\u00b0C, to which we added RNA-later-ICE (Cat # AM7030, ThermoFisher Scientific) followed by overnight incubation at \u221220\u00b0C before subsequent processing.\n\n2.7. Gene and microRNA expression\n2.7.1. Gene expression\nTotal mRNAs were extracted from brain and paw sweat glands using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Cat # 74134, Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) then retrotranscribed using a High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Cat # 4387406, ThermoFisher Scientific), as per manufacturer. Total miRNAs from brain were extracted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Cat # 217004, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer. Retrotranscription of mature miRNAs was performed using the miScript II RT Kit (Cat # 218160, Qiagen). RNA concentration and purity were confirmed using NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometry (ThermoFisher Scientific). Integrity of RNAs and assessment for genomic DNA contamination were done by evaluating 28S/18S rRNAs band ratios on RNA \u201cbleach\u201d gels as before (\nAranda et al., 2012\n;\nSegura-Ulate et al., 2017b\n;\nVargas-Medrano et al., 2018\n). The mRNA and miRNA levels were measured by qPCR using the RealPlex Mastercycler 2 described above. Relative expression of mRNAs was evaluated using Taqman assays (ThermoFisher Scientific) for mouse BDNF (Cat # Mm04230607_s1), mouse NGF (Cat # Mm00443039_m1), mouse RET (Cat # Mm00436304_m1), and mouse GDNF (Cat # Mm00599849_m1), with mouse Gapdh (Cat # Mm99999915_g1) as an internal control. Reactions were carried out in triplicate using GoTaq Probe qPCR Master Mix (Promega, Cat # A6102).\n2.7.2. MicroRNA expression\nRelative expression of miR-96\u20135p was determined using miScript primer assays (Qiagen) for mature mm-miR-96\u20135p (Cat # MS00001456). Internal expression controls were performed with miScript primer assays for SNORD72 (Cat # MS00033719) and SNORD95 (Cat # MS00033726) and miScript miRTC (Cat # MS00000001) primer assay. Reactions were carried out in triplicate using the miScript Sybr Green qPCR Kit (Cat # 218075, Qiagen).\n2.8.1. Mitochondria isolation\nBrain mitochondria were isolated using a kit (Cat # 89801, ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer. Protease inhibitors that were added to all solutions included 17 ug/mL aprotinin, 1 mM benzamidine, and 1 mM AEBSF. Dounce homogenization of 200 mg cerebellum/mouse was performed on ice to isolate mitochondria. The mitochondrial fraction was purified by centrifugation steps in which a final pellet containing mitochondria was suspended in 50 \u03bcl sterile PBS. Total protein concentration of isolated mitochondria was determined by BCA analysis described above.\n2.8.2. Succinate dehydrogenase assay of isolated mitochondria\nSDH activity was measured using 60 \u03bcg of purified mitochondrial protein for all conditions using a colorimetric assay (Cat # MAK197\u20131KT, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO USA). Briefly, mitochondria were added to the reaction mixture in a 96-well plate. Initial absorbance was measured at 600 nm at baseline (time 0), then again after 30 min incubation at 25\u00b0C. SDH activity was determined relative to freshly prepared standards read at 600 nm in a plate reader (Multiskan Spectrum, ThermoFisher Scientific). The difference between the two readings was used to calculate SDH activity as defined in the kit protocol.\n\n2.9. Protein assessments\n2.9.1. Immunoblots\nProtein concentrations were determined by BCA assay as described above. Proteins (25\u201350 \u03bcg per lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, stained with Ponceau S to assess transfer, blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in buffer 1 hr at room temperature, and incubated at 4\u00b0C in primary antibody overnight. For dot blots, equal protein amounts were applied to nitrocellulose with blots handled as described above. Blots were imaged using LiCor Odyssey (Model 9210, LiCor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) and quantified with LiCor Image Studio software or ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare Technologies, Waukesha, WI, USA).\n2.9.2. Antibodies\nAntibodies included: total aSyn (Cat # sc-7011-R, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., 1:200), PSer129 aSyn (Cat# SAB4503996, Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO, 1:100), GDNF (Cat # ab18956, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, 1:500), Iba1 (Cat# 016\u201320001, FujiFilm/Wako Pure Chemical Corp., Richmond, VA, USA; 1:200) and \u03b2-actin (Cat # 3700 or 4970 Cell Signaling Technology Inc., 1:1000). Infrared signals were produced using anti-mouse, anti-goat, or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies coupled to IgG IRDye680 or IgG IRDye800 (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA, USA, 1:5000 \u2013 1:10,000).\n2.9.3. Sequential protein extractions\nPlease note that this method does not isolate cellular and subcellular fractions, but rather separates soluble from insoluble proteins in a series of buffers using ultracentrifugation for pellet re-extractions. Thus loading controls are unavailable when using this method. Protein extraction from lumbar spinal cord was performed according to\nWaxman and Giasson (2008)\nas detailed in\nWu et al. (2012)\nand Vidal-Martinez et al. (\nVidal-Martinez et al., 2016\n). Soluble and insoluble proteins were isolated using a series of 4 buffers with pellets re-extracted after ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 \u00d7 g (4\u00b0C). Extraction buffers were: (1) high-salt (\nHS\n) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 750 mM NaCl, and 5 mM EDTA; (2) high salt Triton X-100 (\nHST\n) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 750 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, (3) 1% Triton X-100; radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (\nRIPA\n) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, and (4) 0.1% SDS; Sodium dodecylsulfate + Urea (\nSDS/Urea\n) containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 8 M Urea, 2% SDS. Protease inhibitors included 17 \u03bcg/mL aprotinin, 1 mM benzamidine, and 1 mM AEBSF in all buffers.\n\n2.10. Statistical analyses\nData represent mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) of 3 or more independent experiments. Unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t-tests, One way ANOVA, or Two way repeated measures ANOVA were performed using Prism 8 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) with significance set to p < .05. Linear regression was performed using GraphPad QuickCalcs. Relative mRNA or miRNA expression was calculated by the 2\n\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct\nmethod using Relative Expression Software Tool (REST-2009, Qiagen) (\nPfaffl et al., 2002\n). Whisker box plots generated with REST-2009, show relative mRNA or miRNA expression as median (dashed midline inside the box), interquartile ranges 1 and 3 (upper and lower edges of the box), and maximum and minimum expression values (top and bottom whiskers) (\nPfaffl et al., 2002\n). We are aware of growing concerns about the indiscriminate use of p values as the sole measure of statistical significance (\nWasserstein et al., 2019\n). Thus, we discuss why the differences found appear to be meaningful."

We first removed the neomycin selection cassette by crossing with FLP mice (Jackson Laboratory stock no. 003946) to obtain\nBtbd9 loxP\nbreeders, which was then crossed with the\nEmx1-cre\nmice, with\ncre\ndirectly inserted into the downstream of putative\nEmx1\npromoter (\nGuo et al., 2000\n). Double heterozygous male mice were then crossed with homozygous\nBtbd9 loxP\nfemale mice.\nEmx1\nexpresses in the testis germ cells (\nYue et al., 2014\n). Therefore, when the sperms contained both\nEmx1-cre\nand\nBtbd9 loxP\n, the recombination occurred and led to a deletion of the targeted sites. The offspring generated from this sperm had a\nBtbd9\nheterozygous KO locus. Heterozygous\nBtbd9\nKO mice were either interbred directly or bred with the\nDrd1-EGFP\nmice (MMRRC stock no. 000297-MU) to generate\nDrd1-EGFP Btbd9\nKO double heterozygous mice, which were then bred with heterozygous\nBtbd9\nKO mice to produce the experimental heterozygous\nDrd1-EGFP\nand homozygous\nBtbd9\nKO mice, and the heterozygous\nDrd1-EGFP\ncontrol littermates. Mice were housed in standard mouse cages (29 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 13 cm; up to 5 mice with the same gender) at 72\u00b0F under normal 12-hour light, 12-hour dark cycle (12 LD) condition.\nThe generation of cerebral cortex-specific Btbd9 knockout mice\nThe cerebral cortex-specific\nBtbd9\nknockout mice (\nBtbd9\ncKO) were generated by crossing\nBtbd9 loxP\nmice with\nEmx1-cre\nmice. Double heterozygous female mice (\nEmx1-cre\n+/\u2212\nBtbd9 loxP\n+/\u2212) were then crossed with homozygous\nBtbd9 loxP\nmale mice (\nBtbd9 loxP\n\u2212/\u2212). The offsprings whose genotypes were\nEmx1-cre\n+/\u2212\nBtbd9 loxP\n\u2212/\u2212 were used as experimental animals.\nBtbd9 loxP\n+/\u2212 or\nBtbd9 loxP\n\u2212/\u2212 littermates were used as controls. PCR was used for genotyping the\nEmx1-cre\n(forward: ATC TCC GGT ATT GAA ACT CCA GCG C; reverse: CAC TCA TGG AAA ATA GCG ATC) and the\nloxP\nsites (forward: ACA TCA CCC ATT ACT TAG AAC CTC; reverse: CAC AGC TAT TTC CTG TCA TTC TGG ACA).\n\nManganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI)\nManganese Chloride (MnCl\n2\n) pretreatment\nA total of 6 adult\nBtbd9\nKO and 8 WT littermates were used in brain imaging. Before the treatment, the animals used in the experiment were handled every day for 2 weeks and acclimatized to the investigator. Manganese (II) chloride tetrahydrate was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA), dissolved in distilled deionized water and sterilely filtered before administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 70 mg/kg/ml. After injections, mice were returned to their home cage and imaged in the next 20\u201324 h.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nImages were collected by a 4.7 Tesla Magnex Scientific scanner under the control of Agilent Technologies VnmrJ 3.1 console software. A 38-mm quadrature transmit/receive radiofrequency coil tuned to 200MHz was used (Insight NeuroImaging Systems, LLC, Leominster, MA). Mice were anesthetized with 2.0% (0.1 L/min) of isoflurane delivered in 100% oxygen for 30\u201360 s. Then the level of isoflurane was maintained between 1.0\u20131.25% throughout the entire setup and imaging session, during which the respiratory rates were monitored continuously and sustained between 20\u201330 beats per minute by adjusting isoflurane levels between the range. Placed prone on custom-size plastic bed with a respiratory pad placed underneath the abdomen, body temperatures of the mice were maintained using a warm air recirculation system (SA Instruments, Inc., New York). The head and incisors of mice were secured on the front end of the plastic bed to minimize motion. The front half of the bed was aligned and clamped inside the quad RF coil and placed inside the isocenter of the scanner. Images were acquired using a T1 - weighted spin echo pulse sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)= 300 ms, echo time (TE) = 12 ms, field of view = 19.2 \u00d7 19.2, slice thickness = 0.8 mm, 12 slices. Total scan time per mouse was 30 min.\n\nHistology\nSix adult\nBtbd9\nKO mice and 7 WT littermates, or 2 adult\nBtbd9\ncKO mice and 4 control littermates were anesthetized and perfused with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4; PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS. The brains were soaked in the paraformaldehyde-PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight and soaked in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PBS until they sank. The brains were frozen by dry-ice powder and cut coronally into 40 \u03bcm sections with a Histoslide 2000 sliding microtome (Reichert-Jung) (\nYokoi et al., 2009\n). Sections were rinsed, mounted, and dipped in freshly prepared cresyl violet stain at room temperature for 16 min. After dehydrated with progressively more concentrated ethanol and clarified with xylene, sections were coverslipped with DPX Mountant for histology. Neurolocida was used for the measurements. The magnification used was 10\u00d7 for ocular lenses and 2.5\u00d7 for objective lenses. Measurements of the S1HL, M1 and the corpus callosum thickness were made in two planes. The positions of the two planes were (1) between 4.42 and 3.94 mm/interaural reference (anterior),\nBtbd9\nKO, n = 33 sections for S1HL, n = 64 sections for M1 and n = 57 sections for corpus callosum; WT, n = 44 sections for S1HL, n = 56 sections for M1 and n = 54 sections for corpus callosum;\nBtbd9\ncKO, n = 18 sections for the S1HL, n = 29 sections for the M1 and n = 20 sections for the corpus callosum; control, n = 44 sections for the S1HL, n = 86 sections for the M1 and n = 46 sections for the corpus callosum, and (2) from 3.82 to 2.58 mm/interaural reference (posterior),\nBtbd9\nKO, n = 67 sections for S1HL, n = 93 sections for M1 and n = 85 sections for corpus callosum; WT, n = 83 sections for S1HL, n = 110 sections for M1 and n = 119 sections for corpus callosum;\nBtbd9\ncKO, n = 64 sections for the S1HL, n = 58 sections for M1 and n = 78 sections for the corpus callosum; control, n = 124 sections for the S1HL, n = 132 sections for M1 and n = 131 sections for the corpus callosum.\n\nWhole-cell voltage-clamp recording\nFive adult\nDrd1-EGFP Btbd9\nKO (male: n=2; female: n=3) and 6\nDrd1-EGFP\nlittermates (male: n=2; female: n=4) with an average age of 2 months were sacrificed, and their brains were rapidly removed. Coronal corticostriatal slices were used for recording spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sEPSC) for 5 mins and evoked currents from EGFP-positive MSNs. Recordings were done in the whole-cell voltage-clamp (MSN neurons were held at \u221270 mV) configuration, with Cesium methane sulfonate-based internal solution (in mM): 125 Cesium methane sulfonate, 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 4 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP,0.2 EGTA, 0.1% Biocytin, pH 7.2. Picrotoxin (50\u03bcM; GABAa receptor blocker) was added in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). Paired-pulse ratios were measured by a glass electrode (3\u20135 M\u03a9) filled with the ACSF, which was placed in the white matter around 40 \u03bcm away from the recorded region to evoke currents. Currents were obtained from the dorsal-lateral striatal MSNs close to the white matter. The position of the glass electrode was carefully adjusted so as not to evoke polysynaptic responses. Two pulses (20 Hz) were given 10 times for every 10 s with 50 ms inter-pulse interval.\n\nQuantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR)\nqRT-PCR was performed as described before (\nYokoi et al., 2015\n) to confirm whether exon 4 was deleted in the\nBtbd9\ncKO mice after\ncre\n-mediated recombination. In brief, 3 adult\nBtbd9\ncKO mice and 3 littermates were sacrificed, and brain regions including the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord were harvested and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted using an RNAeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Next, cDNA was made using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR primers specific to\nBtbd9\nexons 4 and 5 (forward: GAC TCT TGT CTC CGG ATG CT; reverse: TCA CAA CCT GAG CCC CAT AC) and \u03b2-actin (forward: CAC CCG CGA GCA CAG CTT CTT TG; reverse: AAT ACA GCC CGG GGA GCA TCG TC) were used. The CFX real-time system was programmed in the following way: 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 2 min, 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, and 65\u00b0C for 1 min + plate read, followed by the melting curve analysis: melt curve 65\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C, increment 0.5\u00b0C for 5 s + plate read.\n\nBehavioral studies\n30 min open field\nSixteen adult\nBtbd9\ncKO mice and 14 control littermates were used in the open field analysis as previously described (\nYokoi et al., 2008\n). Briefly, each mouse was placed in the center of a VersaMax Legacy open field apparatus connected to a computerized Digiscan System (Accuscan Instruments, Inc. OH) and continuously monitored for 30 min. Bright illumination (approximately 1 k lux at the center by a 60 W white bulb) was focused on the center of each field.\nContinuous open field\nA separate batch of four adult\nBtbd9\ncKO mice and 8 control littermates was monitored under 12 LD for 7 \u00bd days. As described previously (\nLyu et al., 2019a\n;\nLyu et al., 2019b\n;\nMeneely et al., 2018\n), each mouse was placed in the center of a VersaMax Legacy open field apparatus with enough corncob bedding, food, and water. The apparatus contains infrared sensors along the walls that detect any breaks in the beams, which are then decoded by VERSDATA version 2.70\u2013127E (AccuScan Instruments INC.) into behavioral patterns. The data was recorded every 15 min (15 min bin) throughout the experiment. Data from the first three days were excluded from analysis because the animals were assumed to be accommodating. To compare the total distance traveled between\nBtbd9\ncKO and WT, we separated the data into a light cycle or dark cycle because mice are nocturnal. Each cycle contains 4\u20135 periods, from day 4 to day 8, or night 4 to night 7. The distance traveled during each period was added up from the 15 min bins. To compare the probability of waking between the two groups, we recoded the data according to the total distance traveled during each 15 min bin. If the total distance traveled during the 15 min was 0, the mouse was considered as sleeping, and the data were coded as 0; otherwise, the mouse was considered as awake, and the data were coded as 1.\nWheel running\nSixteen adult\nBtbd9\ncKO mice and 14 control littermates (after the open field test) were monitored under 12 LD condition for 7 days. Wheel running activity was recorded as the number of wheel revolutions occurring during 5 min bins and analyzed using Lafayette Instrument Activity Wheel Monitor software. The activities from the 5th to the 7th day were included in the data analysis, grouped by the light and dark cycles.\nTail flick\nSixteen adult\nBtbd9\ncKO mice and 14 control littermates (after the wheel running test) were tested for the perception of warm stimuli using the Tail Flick Analgesia Meter (San Diego Instruments) as previously described (\nDeAndrade et al., 2012a\n). Briefly, each mouse was placed in an acrylic restrainer with the distal end of its tail protruding under a heat lamp. The lamp, together with a timer, was turned on, both of which stopped automatically when the mouse flicked its tail away from the light. The latency to respond was limited to 15 s to prevent injury to the mouse.\nRotarod and beam walking\nEight\nBtbd9\nKO mice and 9 WT littermates and the third batch of 5\nBtbd9\ncKO mice and 6 control littermates were tested as described previously (\nDang et al., 2005\n). The apparatus started at an initial speed of 4 rpm and gradually accelerated at a rate of 0.2 rpm/s. The latency to fall was measured with a cutoff time of 3 min. Mice were tested for three trials on each day for 2 days. The trials within the same day were performed approximately 1 h apart.\nAfter resting for a week, animals were trained to traverse a medium square beam (14 mm wide) in three consecutive trials each day for 2 days. After training was completed, the experiment commenced with recordings of the number of hind paw slips for each of the two trials per beam. On the first test day, animals were made to cross the medium square and round beam (17 mm diameter) and on the second day, a small round beam (10 mm diameter) and an additional small square beam (7 mm wide). Any animal dropped during the test was assigned the largest number observed during the whole beam walking experiment.\n\nData processing and statistical analysis\nImages were processed and analyzed as previously reported (\nPerez et al., 2013\n). Mn\n2+\naccumulation in active neurons produces signal intensity increases in T1 images. However, as this is a non-quantitative approach to measure activity and because there is scan-to-scan intensity variation independent of Mn\n2+\n, we normalized images based on their individual variance (\nPerez et al., 2013\n). Using this normalization approach, where surpassing a normalized threshold value of 1 indicates increased activity associated with Mn\n2+\nadministration, we have observed significant differences between Mn\n2+\nadministered and non-treated rodents. Image processing was carried out using ITK-SNAP (\nhttp://www.itksnap.org\n) and image math scripts were available on FSL (fslmaths\nhttp://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/\n). Scans were aligned with a segmented atlas of the adult mouse brain using an automated affine linear registration tool from FSL (\nJenkinson et al., 2012\n). Each scan was converted to a z value map through a voxel-wise normalization procedure. The mean signal intensity across the entire extracted brain volume (x\n\u2212\n) was subtracted from each voxel (xi) and then divided by the variance (\u03c3). A pre-set threshold of z \u2265 1 was selected based on a prior observation of individual datasets and a close inspection of their intensity distribution histograms. All voxels with z score values below this threshold were set to zero. Thus, the voxels exceeding the threshold value of z \u2265 1 were considered in our statistical analysis as having higher signal intensities (quantified as the number of voxels above a z value of 1). The mean number of voxels for each region of interest (ROI) was compared using an unpaired two-tailed t-test (homoscedastic variances, \u03b1 \u2264 0.05).\nThe data were tested for normality using the SPSS statistical package first. Part of the thickness of specific brain region, PPF, membrane properties, wheel running test, continuous open field, tail-flick data and rotarod data for\nBtbd9\nKO were not normally distributed and were analyzed by the logistic regression with a gamma distribution (SAS statistical package), which log-transformed the data and then normalized the WT or the control group to 0 without the error bar. 30 min open field activity, the sEPSC, the rest of the cortical thickness data and rotarod data for\nBtbd9\ncKO were normally distributed and compared by mixed-model ANOVA (SAS). Beam walking data were count data hence were analyzed by logistic regression with a negative binomial distribution. Gender (if females were used) and age were used as covariates in both ANOVA and logistic regression. qRT-PCR data were analyzed by the Student\u2019s t-test."

    "Methods": "AAV shRNA vectors:\nThe AAVshPTEN vector (serotype AAV2/9) expresses shRNA-PTEN from the human U6 promoter and a zsGreen reporter protein from the CMV promoter as previously described (\nLewandowski and Steward 2014\n). Studies involving cortical stimulation and cell size assessment were done using a similar vector in which zsGreen was replaced by GFP. The control vector was the same AAV2/9 vector expressing shRNA against luciferase (AAVshLuc). Vectors were constructed by the University of Pennsylvania Vector Core. As previously documented, intra-cortical injections of AAVshPTEN lead to effective knockdown of PTEN in cortical neurons (\nLewandowski and Steward 2014\n).\nAnimals and surgery\nExperimental animals were adult female Fisher 344 rats. Some experiments involving injections into the dentate gyrus were done with Fisher 344 transgenic rats from our breeding colony that express GFP. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of California Irvine.\n\nAAVshRNA injections into the sensorimotor cortex:\nRats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2\u20133%) and placed in a stereotaxic device. The scalp was incised and burr holes were drilled in the skull at 2.5L/2.0P; 2.5L/1.0P; 3.2L/1P; 2.5L/0P; and 3.2L/0P. Using a Hamilton syringe tipped with a pulled glass pipette, a total of 5X 1\u03bcl injections of AAVshRNA were made at each site at a depth of 0.8mm (total of approximately 10\n9\ngenome copies); ten rats received the control vector (AAVshLuc). Injections were unilateral to allow comparisons between areas in which PTEN was depleted vs. the homologous area of the contralateral cortex. After completing the injections, the scalp was sutured and rats were kept on water circulating heating pads until they recovered from the anesthetic and then were returned to their home cage. Rats were allowed to survive for 8 weeks post-AAV injection.\n\nHome cage vs. novel enriched environment (EE):\nThe study of basal and learning-induced IEG expression involved 20 rats that received AAVshPTEN (n=10) or AAVshLuc (n=10) and were allowed to survive for 2 months post-AAV injection. Animal numbers were based on data from previous studies in mice in which n=5 per condition provided adequate statistical power (Steward et al, 2018). Rats were divided into 2 experience groups using a random number generator. Five rats of each AAVshRNA treatment group were allowed to explore a novel enriched environment prior to sacrifice (EE). The enriched environment was a 2\u00d72\u2019 black box with plastic toys scattered on the floor. Rats were placed individually in the box for 1 hr. At the end of the hour, rats immediately received a lethal dose of Fatal Plus (~85 mg/kg) and were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde solution in 0.1M phosphate buffer. Home cage controls (HC), were removed from their home cage and immediately received a lethal dose of Fatal Plus\u00ae and were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde.\n\nHigh Frequency electrical stimulation of the cortex:\nThe study of IEG induction with cortical stimulation involved 3 rats that received AAVshPTEN injections into the cortex as above and survived for 4 months and 3 un-injected controls. For this study, we used the AAVshPTEN vector with GFP reporter. Rats were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injections of 20% urethane (1ml initial dose with supplemental doses of 0.5ml approximately every 10 minutes until the animal was unresponsive to tail pinch). Rats were positioned in a stereotaxic apparatus and burr holes were placed in the skull (anterior site: 2.5A, 2.0L; posterior site: 4.0 posterior, 3.0L). Flat-end machine screws were placed in the posterior burr hole and advanced to touch the cortical surface. An insulated wire was inserted into the cortex at the anterior position to a depth of 0.5mm. For the rats that had previously received intra-cortical injections of AAVshPTEN, the insulated wire stimulating electrode was inserted through the soft scar tissue that had formed in the craniotomy site in the skull. Stimulus intensity was set to evoke a forelimb twitch in response to a single pulse (anode at the anterior position). Then, high frequency stimulation (HFS) was delivered for 10 minutes (trains of eight pulses at 400Hz given at a rate of 1/10 seconds). Rats were allowed to survive for 20\u201360 minutes after after completion of HFS, and then rats received Fatal Plus\u00ae (0.5ml) and were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde.\nAAVshRNA injections into the dentate gyrus:\nRats were prepared for AAV injection surgery as described above except that a single burr hole was made over the dorsal hippocampus (3.5 posterior to bregma, 1.8 lateral). A single injection of 0.3\u03bcl of AAVshRNA (total of approximately 3\u00d710\n8\ngenome copies) was made at a depth of 2.8mm. Fifteen female rats received AAVshPTEN; six rats received the control vector (AAVshLuc). Rats were allowed to survive for 2\u20135 months post-AAV injection.\n\nNeurophysiology:\nTwo rats that had received AAVshRNA injections into the dentate gyrus were euthanized without neurophysiological recording to assess IEG and kinases with PTEN knockdown alone. The remainder were used for neurophysiology. Rats were anesthetized for acute neurophysiology via intraperitoneal injections of 20% urethane and were positioned in a stereotaxic apparatus. A burr hole was placed in the skull at 4.2 mm lateral to the midline and 1.0mm anterior to the transverse sinus for placement of a stimulating electrode into the entorhinal cortex. The depth of the stimulating electrode was adjusted to optimally activate the medial perforant path originating from the medial entorhinal cortex (EC) \u2013 usually about 4mm below the cortical surface. Glass recording electrodes filled with 0.9% saline were lowered into the brain through the burr hole that was previously placed for AAVshRNA delivery and positioned in the dorsal blade of the dentate gyrus to record field potentials from the cell body layer.\n\nStimulation paradigm:\nAfter positioning the stimulating and recording electrodes, stimulus intensity was set so as to evoke a population spike of 3\u20136 mV. Single test pulses were delivered at a rate of 1/10 seconds for 10 minutes in order to determine baseline response amplitude; measures were the slope of the population EPSP and amplitude of the population spike. Following baseline recordings, 3 rounds of high frequency stimulation were delivered at the same stimulus intensity, with each round consisting of ten trains of eight pulses at 400Hz given at a rate of 1/10 seconds. After delivering 3 bouts of HFS, test pulses were delivered at a rate of 1/30sec for 1hr to determine the extent and duration of LTP. Then, HFS was continued at a rate of one 400hz train per 10sec for 1hr to activate kinase pathways and induce IEGs. One additional rat received 3 bouts of HFS (30 trains) and survived for 1 hour. At the designated survival time, rats received Fatal Plus\u00ae (0.5ml) and were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemistry. One additional rat received 3 bouts of HFS (30 trains) and survived for 1 hour.\nTissue preparation and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for rats that received intra-cortical injections\nBrains were cryoprotected in 27% sucrose and frozen in OCT using a mixture of dry ice and 100% ethanol. Brains were sectioned in the coronal plane by cryostat collecting sets of sections at 300\u03bcm intervals.\nSets of sections were immunostained for PTEN to determine the area of PTEN knockdown, for c-fos as a measure of IEG expression and using antibodies that recognize the phosphorylated form of ribosomal proten S6 (p-S6), which is a downstream marker for mTOR activation. Prior to immunostaining, sections were placed in 1.7mL microfuge tubes with nano-pure water and microfuge tubes were placed in boiling water for 5min for antigen retrieval. Sections were then equilibrated in TBS (100mM Tris, pH 7.4 and 150mM NaCl), blocked for 1\u20132hrs at room temperature in 5%TSA blocking reagent (Perkin Elmer catalog FP1012) or in TBS with 5% normal donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 and then incubated overnight in primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-PTEN (1:250 Cell Signaling Technology; Cat # 9188), rabbit anti c-fos (1:1000 Millipore; ABE457) and rabbit anti-p-S6 SER 240\u2013244 (1:250 Cell Signaling Technology; Cat # 2215). Sections were rinsed and incubated in horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated donkey anti rabbit secondary (1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Sections were then treated by Catalyzed Reporter Deposition (CARD) amplification to generate tyramide-Cy3. Sections were then washed with TBS, mounted and coverslipped using Vectashield.\nImage collection and quantification of c-fos positive neurons\nPTEN IHC was used to determine the area of knockdown. For rats that received AAVshPTEN injections into the cortex, a sampling box 750\u03bcm wide was positioned over the cortex in the area of PTEN deletion identified by PTEN IHC and in the homologous area in the contralateral hemisphere, which serves as an intra-animal control. C-fos positive neurons were summed across cortical layers from the cortical surface to the white matter.\n\nCell size measurements.\nTo quantify de novo growth of PTEN-depleted cortical neurons, a subset of animals (n=3) received unilateral injections of AAV-shPTEN-GFP as above and were allowed to survive for 4 months post injection. Brains were sectioned in the coronal plane at 40\u03bcm thickness on a Vibratome\u00ae collecting sets of sections at 480\u03bcm intervals. One set of sections was triple stained for PTEN immunofluorescence, NeuN and Hoechst for nuclear detection.\nSections were washed in TBS (100mM Tris, pH 7.4 and 150mM NaCl) then quenched for endogenous peroxidase activity by incubation in 3%H2O2/TBS for 15 minutes. Sections were then washed in TBS and blocked in blocking buffer (TBS, 0.3% Triton X-100, 5% NDS) for 2 hours at room temperature. Sections were then incubated overnight at room temperature in buffer containing primary antibodies for rabbit anti-PTEN (1:250, Cell Signaling Technology; 9188) and mouse anti-NeuN (1:200, Millipore MAB377). Sections were then washed in TBS, incubated for 2 hours in buffer containing biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:250, Jackson ImmunoResearch 711\u2013065-152) and donkey anti-mouse Alexa 555 (1:250, Invitrogen\nA31570\n), then washed again. PTEN detection was accomplished through incubation in ABC reagent (Vectastain Elite kit, catalog #PK-6100; Vector Laboratories) and CARD amplification with Tyramide-FITC. Sections were then mounted on 0.5% gelatin coated slides and counterstained with Hoechst (1\u03bcg/mL).\nThree consecutive sections spaced 480\u03bcm apart were taken for assessment of cross sectional area. Images were taken at 10x on an Olympus A\u00d780 microscope and images were imported into ImageJ. Sampling was done by identifying a 400\u00d7300\u03bcm region of interest (ROI) in layer V of the motor cortex within the area of PTEN knockdown. PTEN deletion was confirmed by a lack of co-labeling of PTEN with NeuN. The cross-sectional area of cell bodies and corresponding nuclear size were manually traced beginning at the top left end of the ROI, moving medially until 25 cells were collected. Only neurons with a pyramidal cell shape were included, and whose soma and nuclear borders could be distinguished from surrounding cells. As an intra-animal control, 25 PTEN-expressing cells and their corresponding nuclei were measured on the contralateral cortex using comparable methods. In total, 75 PTEN-depleted and 75 PTEN-expressing neurons were assessed per animal, calculating averages for each individual rat, then the overall mean cross-sectional area for the PTEN depletion and control groups was determined by averaging measures across rats.\nTissue preparation of brains from rats that received AAVshRNA into the dentate gyrus\nBrains were sectioned in the coronal plane on a Vibratome\u00ae at 40\u03bcm collecting sets of sections at 480\u03bcm intervals and sections were stored in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4). Unstained sections were mounted on slides to visualize zsGreen expression. To define the area of PTEN knockdown, one set of sections was immunostained for PTEN as described above. Other sets were immunostained for\nc-fos\n(as above) and\nArc\nand for the phosphorylated form of ribosomal protein S6 (p-rpS6) and the phosphorylated form of extracellularly regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2).\nPreparation for immunostaining and incubation in primary antibodies was as above; Primary antibodies were: rabbit anti-Arc (1:1000 Synaptic Systems 156 003); rabbit anti-c-fos, (1:1000 EMD Millipore ABE457); rabbit anti-p-rpS6 ser 240/244 (1:250 Cell Signaling 2215); rabbit anti-p-rpS6 ser 235/236 (1:250 Cell Signaling 4858); goat anti-p-ERK 1/2 (1:100 Santa Cruz Biotech SC-16982).\nSections were then incubated 1 to 2 hours in a 1:250 dilution of biotin-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 711\u2013065-152) for all immunostains with the exception of the p-ERK 1/2 for which a 1:250 dilution of biotin-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Vector Laboratories, BA-5000) was used. Sections were then treated with ABC (Vector Laboratories PK-6100) for 1\u2013 2 hours. Sets of sections were prepared for immunohistochemistry with both DAB and immunofluorescence. For DAB, sections were stained in DAB (Vector Laboratories, SK-4100) for 3\u20135 minutes. For immunofluorescence, CARD amplification of Cy3 labeled tyramide was run for 25 minutes. After immunostaining, sections were mounted on 0.5% gelatin subbed slides. DAB stained slides were dehydrated through washes of graded ethanol, cleared in 3 changes of xylene and coverslipped with DPX.\nImage collection and quantification\nPTEN knockdown in the dentate gyrus leads to de novo growth of granule cell bodies and increases in the thickness of the granule cell layer. To determine whether there were also increases in granule cell number, sets of sections from 4 rats were immunostained for NeuN and coversliped with Vectashield\u00ae with DAPI. Images were taken of the GCL layer in the middle of the area of PTEN depletion and in the homologous part of the contralateral GCL and counts were made of the number of granule cell bodies/100\u03bcm length of the GCL. For counting, images were imported into photoshop and overlaid with a grid with lines spaced at 100\u03bcm intervals. DAPI-positive nuclei within the granule cell layer were counted including nuclei that touched the grid line on the left and excluding nuclei that touched the grid line on the right.\nPTEN IHC was used to determine the area of knockdown. In sections immunostained for c-fos, Arc, and p-S6, images of the dorsal leaf of the granule cell layer were taken at 40X in 3 sites: 1) On the side contralateral to the stimulation (control); 2) Outside the area of PTEN knockdown on the side of the high frequency stimulation; 3) In the area of PTEN knockdown. We then counted the number of c-fos, Arc, and p-S6-positive dentate granule cells per 100\u03bcm length of the granule cell layer.\nTo quantify immunostaining for p-ERK, images were taken at 20X from the same regions as above. Images were imported into ImageJ and converted to 8-bit. An ROI line was oriented perpendicular to the granule cell layer extending from the cell layer through the molecular layer and fluorescence intensity along the ROI line was assessed averaging 5 measurements per animal.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData on counts of c-fos and Arc-positive neurons (n=5 rats per condition) and measures of cell body and nuclear size (n=3 rats) were imported into Graphpad Prism\u00ae software and analyzed using repeated measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with post-hoc comparisons using Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons.\nCounts of granule cells per 100\u03bcm segment of the granule cell layer (GCL) were done in 4 rats exhibiting minimal damage to the granule cell layer and data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll studies followed National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Penn State Hershey College of Medicine. Male Wistar rats \u22658 weeks of age, upon entrance into the experiment, and initially weighing 175\u2013200 g (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were used. Animals were initially double housed in a room maintained at 21\u201324\u00b0C and a 12:12-h light-dark cycle with food and water provided\nad libitum\n. After surgery animals were single housed in cages mounted on warming pads in order to assist in maintaining an adequate body temperature of 37\u00b0C. All experimental animals were observed daily, and food and body weight were recorded.\n\nSurgical procedures and post-operative care\nAnimals (n=200) were randomly assigned to the control or SCI surgical group. After initial groups were assigned, the groups were further evenly divided into 3-day and 3-week post-surgical control or post-SCI study groups. Additional 1-day and 7-day groups were generated for qRT-PCR analysis. After being deeply anesthetized with 3\u20135% mixture of Isoflurane with oxygen (400\u2013600ml/min), surgery for T3-contusion SCI was performed using established surgical techniques as previously described in detail (\nSwartz EM and Holmes GM, 2014\n). Briefly, upon completion of surgical exposure of the T2 laminectomy site, the adjacent T1 and T3 vertebrae were clamped into the Infinite Horizons SCI device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Lexington KY) and a 300 kDyne impact (15 sec dwell time) was initiated. Surgical controls underwent all procedures except for the spinal impact.\nIn a subset of rats (n=4/group), gastric projecting NG neurons were specifically identified in 3-day and 3-week T3-SCI or surgical control groups. In 3-day rats, immediately prior to the SCI or control laminectomy procedure, the retrograde tracer 1,1\u2019-dioctadecyl-3,3,3\u2019,3\u2019-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI; Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, Waltham, MA) was utilized to label gastric projecting NG neurons. A midline laparotomy was performed to expose the stomach. DiI (3%), dissolved in DMSO, was microinjected at multiple points into the serosal surface of the ventral and dorsal surfaces of the corpus of the stomach (totaling 10 \u03bcL/surface). Precautions were taken to prevent the leakage of DiI from the injection sites and the visceral surface was repeatedly cleaned with a cotton swab. The wound margin was closed with absorbable suture (Vicryl 4\u20130) and wound clips. In the 3-week groups, DiI was injected in a separate procedure 3-days prior to tissue harvest.\nPost-operatively, rats were administered supplemental fluids by injection of 5cc warmed lactated Ringer\u2019s solution (s.c.) and stabilized in an incubator (37\u00b0C) until fully recovered from anesthesia. Afterward, animals were monitored daily for any signs of infection or complications from surgery and administered post-operative care as previously described (\nSwartz EM\net al.\n, 2014\n).\nFifteen rats were excluded from final analysis due to A) non-viable nerve recording preparations (n=14) or C); nerve recording data exceeding an outlier test (n=1).\n\nGastric vagal afferent nerve recording\nThree-days or three-weeks following the initial surgery, T3-SCI or control animals were fasted overnight with water provided\nad libitum\n. After being deeply anesthetized with 3\u20135% Isoflurane with oxygen, animals were prepared for physiological instrumentation. Animals were placed on a feedback-controlled warming pad (TCAT 2LV, Physitemp Instruments, Clifton, New Jersey) and rectal temperature monitored and maintained at 37\u00b11 \u00b0C for the duration of the experiment. Once aseptically prepared for surgery, the animal was intubated to maintain an open airway via the trachea.\nFollowing tracheal intubation, the femoral artery and adjacent vein or tributaries were exposed via a small incision of the proximal-medial thigh overlying the quadriceps and adductors and cleared superiorly and proximally to the inguinal ligament. An aseptic PE-50 catheter was inserted towards the abdominal aorta for arterial blood pressure and a PE-50 catheter was inserted in a direction away from the abdominal vena cava for drug administration and the wound margin was closed with wound clips. The rat was slowly weaned from Isoflurane to thiobutabarbitol (Inactin 80\u2013100mg/kg, i.v.) which does not affect cardiovascular (\nBuelke-Sam et al., 1978\n) or gastrointestinal (\nQualls-Creekmore et al., 2010b\n) autonomic function. The rate of Inactin infusion was monitored in conjunction with the resulting temporary drop in arterial blood pressure (SYS-BP1, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Data from the blood pressure monitor was digitized via an analogue-to-digital converter (1401 Micro3, Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). All data signals were continuously digitized at 2kHz and recorded to computer using Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). Heart rate values were calculated from the peak-to-peak mean arterial pressure (MAP) by the Spike2 software.\nOnce full Inactin anesthesia was achieved, a midline upper-abdominal laparotomy was performed to expose the stomach and distal esophagus. Under higher power stereoscopic magnification (45\u201360X), the subdiaphragmatic left vagus was isolated from the esophageal surface with fine-tipped Dumont forceps by removing the adjacent connective tissue from the nerve and esophageal surface while keeping the area moist with physiological saline. Once isolated, the gastric vagus nerve was then carefully placed on bipolar recording electrodes. The electrodes were connected to a differential amplifier (1700, A-M Systems, Inc., Sequim, WA), and whole-nerve recordings were filtered (low pass, 1\u20135 kHz; and high pass, 50\u2013100 Hz with a 60-Hz notch filter) and the output signal distributed to the 1400 Micro3 A/D converter, and audio monitor (AM-8, Grass Instruments, Cambridge, MA). Digitized nerve signals were further rectified and integrated by the Spike2 software. Once the vagal nerve signal was verified, the nerve and electrodes were secured to the bipolar electrodes using KwikSil (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and the portion of the gastric vagus proximal to the bipolar electrodes was crushed to eliminate recording vagal efferent action potentials. The stomach was carefully returned to the abdominal cavity to sufficiently maintain temperature and prevent desiccation, yet still permit access for mechanical stimulation of the stomach wall.\nBaseline recordings were established after the rat had stabilized for at least 60-minutes following surgical procedures. Mechanical responses were determined using calibrated von Frey hairs (0.07g-60g). Stimulus-responses were evoked by static pressure to the gastric corpus and movement across the serosal surface at a rate of 5mm s\n\u22121\nand the interval between each mechanical stimulus test was a minimum of 5-minutes of recovery. Infusions of PBS, CCK (0.06 and 0.4 \u03bcg kg\n\u22121\n, i.v.) or capsaicin (0.05 and 0.5 \u03bcg kg\n\u22121\n, i.v.) were separated by a minimum of 20-minute recovery period. Background nerve activity was normalized post-hoc to 100% after noise subtraction from the nerve recordings.\n\nNodose ganglia isolation\nNodose ganglia were harvested bilaterally from a cohort of animals other than those used for extended nerve recording studies. Following the appropriate time-course (1d, 3d, 1w or 3w), animals were anesthetized with 3\u20135% Isoflurane until non-responsive to toe pinch and corneal reflex. The rat was immediately placed dorsally and an incision was made in the skin from the superior notch of the sternum towards the midline of the mandible and both carotid arteries were exposed in order to locate the vagus nerve bilaterally. The rat was then rapidly exsanguinated and the nodose were quickly excised and placed in liquid nitrogen-cooled microcentrifuge tubes and stored at \u221280 degrees Celsius until all had been collected for processing.\n\nQuantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction\nQuantitative RT-PCR reactions were performed as described previously (\nBesecker\net al.\n, 2017\n). The forward and reverse primer pairs used for these studies were designed using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) and are shown in\nTable 1\n. Quantity of mRNA for the listed primers was based on a standard curve and normalized to \u03b2-actin mRNA (ABI QuantStudio 12KFlex with available OpenArray block, Applied Biosystems). Nomenclature is presented according to Rat Genome Nomenclature Committee guidelines (\nhttp://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/gene.shtml\n) along with more common, informal, usage. For example, CCK-1r is a human protein commonly used in human research literature to represent the CCK receptor found in periphery tissue including the alimentary tract (\nDufresne et al., 2006\n); in the rat the homolog is CCKar.\nTable 1.\nForward and reverse primer sequences for quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR)\nGene\nForward Primer\nReverse Primer\nTRPV1\n5\u2019-CCCAGGCAACTGTGAGGGCG-3\u2019\n5\u2019-GGCAGGCACAGAGTGGACCC-3\u2019\nCCK\n5\u2019-AGCTGAGGGCTGTGCTCCGA-3\u2019\n5\u2019-TTCGAGGCGAGGGGTCGTGT-3\u2019\nCCKar\n5\u2019-TTCTCAGTGTGCTGGGGAAC-3\u2019\n5\u2019-AGGTTGAAGGTGGAAACGCT-3\u2019\nOpen in a new tab\n\nNodose ganglia dissociation\nRats were first anesthetized with CO\n2\nand then quickly euthanized by decapitation. The ganglia were dissected in ice-cold Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS). Thereafter, the ganglia were enzymatically dissociated in Earle\u2019s balanced salt solution containing 0.6 mg/ml collagenase (Roche Diagnostics Corp. Indianapolis, IN), 0.4 mg/ml trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corp. Lakewood, NJ), 0.1 mg/ml DNAase Type I (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in a shaking water bath at 35\u00b0C for 45-min. The neurons were then dispersed by vigorous shaking, centrifuged twice for 6-min at 500 rpm. The dispersed neurons were resuspended in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (VWR), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (all from Thermo-Fisher Scientific). The dissociated NG neurons were plated on multiple poly-L-lysine coated dishes or coverslips and incubated (5% CO\n2\n/95% air) at 37\u00b0C overnight until experimentation.\n\nFluorescence immunocytochemistry\nRandomly selected coverslips with dissociated NG neurons were fixed with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde for 10-min then washed three times with 1X PBS. Neurons were blocked for 30-min with a solution of 10% normal donkey serum (NDS)/1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) in 1X PBS with 250 \u03bcg/mL digitonin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Cells were then incubated with primary antibody in 3% NDS/1% BSA/ 0.05% sodium azide (Acros, Thermo Fisher, NJ) in 1X PBS with 250 \u03bcg/mL digitonin (see\nMatsubayashi et al., 2008\n) for 2-h at room temperature. Primary rabbit polyclonal antibody against either CCKar (5\u03bcg/mL; Neuromics RA15049) or primary rabbit polyclonal antibody against TRPV1 (1:1000; EMD Millipore AB5370) were used to identify CCKar-positive and TRPV1-positive NG, respectively. Primary antibodies were diluted in sterile PBS (CCKar) and sterile distilled water (TRPV1). Coverslips were washed three times with 1X PBS, then incubated with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000; Jackson Laboratory) in 3% NDS/1% BSA in 1X PBS with 250 \u03bcg/ml digitonin for 30-min in the dark. Lastly, coverslips were washed three times in 1X PBS then mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Inc, Burlingame, CA). To check for specificity of the secondary antibody, negative controls were prepared by omitting one primary antibody during the incubation. All antibodies were validated in rodent tissue preparations at least three times to confirm specificity and optimize concentration prior to performing any immunolabeling experiments.\n\nConfocal imaging\nImages of isolated NG neurons were acquired using a Nikon C2+ confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) with Plan Apochromat 40X/1.30 Oil DIC objective with Nikon Elements software (ver. 4.5). To identify fluorescent signals, specific band-pass filters were used to achieve proper separation of signals for each laser excitation (for double labeling 488nm laser/505\u2013530, 543nm laser/560\u2013590BP). Most confocal images were acquired at an approximate optical thickness of 0.5 \u03bcm or 1.0 Airy unit. Digital confocal images were saved as Nikon .ND2 format and final publication quality images were exported in the TIFF format as 300 dpi images. All images were processed and adjusted for brightness and contrast using Adobe Photoshop CC (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA).\n\nHistological Analysis of Lesion Centers\nFollowing euthanasia, the spinal cord and surrounding vertebrae were removed\nen bloc\n, and immediately post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. For histological staining of T3-SCI lesion extent, tissue was cryo-sectioned (40\u03bcm thick) and alternating sections were mounted on gelatin coated slides. To compare lesion severity with the spinal cords of control animals, spinal cord sections were stained with luxol fast blue (LFB) to visualize myelinated fibers. LFB-stained slides were digitally imaged on a Zeiss Axioscope light microscope and Axiocam CCD camera and analyzed as described previously (\nBesecker et al., 2017\n).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nThe occurrence of outliers was tested using a Grubbs test macro written in GraphPad (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). One significant outlier was identified for vagal afferent nerve recording in response to capsaicin administration and was excluded from analysis. Normality tests were performed for each analysis to determine if parametric or nonparametric statistics should be used. All statistical calculations were performed using SigmaPlot software (version 12.5; Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA). In the early stages of data collection, Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to determine the lowest dose to consistently evoke an integrated, rectified vagal afferent response 10% above baseline. Effects of injury and vagal afferent nerve activity were evaluated using two-way repeated measures ANOVAs for the given postoperative time. A Tukey post-hoc test was used to determine differences in vagal afferent nerve activity between injury and stimulus parameters. Between group results from\nin vivo\nor qRT-PCR studies were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey post hoc analysis. Results are expressed as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) with significance defined as\np <\n0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals and experimental design\nIn total, we used 306 adult mice and ~50 pups. Adult C57BL/6 (JAX Stock 000664), pregnant female C57BL/6, VTN (JAX Stock 004371) and GFAP-cre breeders (B6.Cg-Tg(GFAP-cre/ERT2)505Fmv/J, JAX Stock 012849) were from The Jackson Laboratory. The FAK-flox mice breeders (B6;129X1-\nPtk2\ntm1Lfr\n/Mmucd, RRID:MMRRC_009967-UCD) were from the MMRRC at the University of California, Davis. Experimental mice were produced by breeding heterozygous mice and characterized as described in detail before (\nJia et al., 2019b\n). To induce cre-lox gene excision, tamoxifen (T5648, Sigma) was injected i.p. at 50 mg/kg, twice a day, for five days. Fourteen days later, such mice were used for MCAO experiments. Tamoxifen induced an increase in body weight compared to no increase with oil control injections (10.3 \u00b1 3.0% vs. \u22121.1 \u00b1 4.2%, p <0.05, n=16,14) over 5 d of injection and 14 d post-injection period before the MCAO (data not shown). However, there was no difference in body weight gain in the conditional knockout and control FAK-lox mice treated with tamoxifen (5.0 \u00b1 2.9% vs. 3.3 \u00b1 3.3%, n=19,22). Some groups of mice were ovariectomized or castrated and used for MCAO experiments 2 weeks later, as indicated. SVZ tissue was collected fresh at 24 after MCAO for cytokine mRNA and protein analyses. In mice with i.v. injection of rhVTN, SVZ tissue was collected at 28 h after MCAO. For histological analyses, mice were processed at 24 h, 28 h or 14 d. All procedures and postoperative care were approved by the University Committee on Animal Care and complied with the NIH Guide on Care and Use of Animals.\n\nMCAO and intrastriatal injections\nA 30 min MCAO was performed as described (\nKang et al., 2013\n) in which blood flow in the cortex was reduced to less than 20% using Doppler flowmetry and body temperature was maintained. Cortical blood flow levels before or during the MCAO were not different among C57BL/6, VTN+/+, VTN\u2212/\u2212, FAK-lox and GFAP-cre/FAK-lox mice and less than 2% on average. Sham operated animals underwent the same procedure except that the 0.21 mm thick Doccol filament was not inserted. To document VTN leakage following stroke, rhVTN (50 \u03bcg in 100 \u03bcl of saline, Sigma, SRP3186) was injected intravenously via the jugular vein at 24 h after MCAO in C57BL/6 mice or VTN\u2212/\u2212 mice. Four hours later, the mice were perfused with PBS for SVZ fresh tissue collection used in western blotting or with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde for immunostaining (experimental design,\nSupplemental Fig. 1A\n). To measure MCAO-induced changes in the levels of VTN mRNA, C57BL/6 mice were perfused with PBS at 24 h after MCAO and followed by fresh SVZ tissue collection. To assess SVZ cell proliferation, BrdU (50 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected at 12, 13 and 14 days, with the last injection 2 h before processing (experimental design,\nSupplemental Fig. 1B\n). BrdU labeling was not done during the acute phase because such BrdU-labeled neuroblasts would have migrated away by 14 days. We were interested in the longer-term effects of the early IL-6 peak expression after stroke. To investigate IL-6 effect on VTN-induced inhibition of SVZ neurogenesis in female mice, mouse IL-6 (100 ng in 1 \u03bcl PBS, Cat# 200-06, Peprotech) or control (1 \u03bcl PBS) was stereotactically injected into the striatum neighboring the SVZ as described before (\nKang et al., 2012\n) in female VTN+/+ and VTN\u2212/\u2212 mice immediately before MCAO. Then the mice were processed for histological analysis of neurogenesis at 14 days (experimental design,\nSupplemental Fig. 1B\n). To determine the effect of plasma VTN on FAK phosphorylation in the SVZ, PBS (1 \u03bcl), VTN +/+ plasma (1 \u03bcl) or VTN \u2212/\u2212 plasma (1 \u03bcl) was injected into the striatum next to the SVZ of VTN +/+ mice and fresh SVZ tissue was collected at 24 h (experimental design,\nSupplemental Fig. 1C\n). To determine the effect of FAK inhibition on MCAO-induced cytokine expression, female mice received an MCAO followed by i.p injection of saline or FAK inhibitor, FAK14 (3 mg/kg, Tocris, #3414) at 6 h when IL-6 is increasing and then SVZ tissue was collected at 24 h after MCAO.\n\nOvariectomy (OVX) and castration (CAS)\nFemales were ovariectomized and males were castrated as described previously (\nJia et al., 2019a\n). For OVX, the oviduct and ovary on each side were first ligated with a sterile silk ligature and then removed by incisions through two 0.5 cm incisions on each side of back. For CAS, a suture was first placed around vas deferens and spermatic blood vessels on each side through a 0.5 cm midline incision in the scrotum and followed by removal of the testes. The skin and muscle were sutured afterwards. MCAO or Sham surgeries were performed 14 days after OVX or CAS.\n\nmRNA and protein quantification\nA 0.5 mm strip of SVZ-containing brain tissue was collected (\nJia et al., 2018\n). CNTF (Mm00446373_m1), LIF (Mm00434762_g1), IL-6 (Mm00446190_m1) and GAPDH (4352932E) mRNA expression levels in RNA extracts were quantified by RT-qPCR using primers (Life Technologies) and a QuantStudio 6 Flex (Applied Biosystems) as described (\nJia et al., 2018\n). The protein extract was dissociated in 100 \u03bcl RIPA buffer supplemented with proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors by sonication. The protein levels of VTN, actin, phosphorylated FAK (pFAK) and total FAK were measured by western blot, as described previously (\nJia et al., 2018\n), with mouse anti-human VTN (1:500, MAB88917, Millipore, RRID:AB 2216433), rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:2000, #5174, Cell Signaling, RRID:AB 10622025), rabbit anti-pFAK (1:1000, #3283, Cell Signaling, RRID:AB 2173659) and rabbit anti-FAK (1:1000, #3285, Cell Signaling, RRID:AB 2269034) antibody. Each sample was run in three independent gels and densitometry performed on each western blot.\n\nImmunostaining and cell counting\nMice were perfused with ice-cold PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. After cryoprotection in 30% sucrose overnight, 20 or 30 \u03bcm coronal sections containing the SVZ were collected from the genu of the corpus callosum to the anterior commissure decussation using a cryostat or microtome. Every 6\nth\nsection was stained for BrdU (1:1000, ab6326, Abcam RRID:AB 305426) followed by DAB or for BrdU and doublecortin (DCX) double labeling (DCX, 1:500, SC-8066, Santa Cruz, RRID:AB 2088494) followed by appropriate secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), as described (\nJia and Hegg, 2015\n;\nJia et al., 2019b\n). Nuclei were stained with DAPI. BrdU-positive nuclei in the SVZ were counted using unbiased stereology (\nKang et al., 2013\n) and BrdU/DCX double-labeled neuroblasts in the dorsolateral SVZ were counted manually (\nJia and Hegg, 2015\n;\nJia et al., 2019b\n) by researchers blinded to the treatment. To detect leaked VTN at 24 or 28 h after MCAO, 20 \u03bcm coronal sections were stained with mouse anti-human VTN antibody (1:200, MAB88917, Millipore, RRID:AB 2216433). The immunostaining specificity was validated by replacing the primary antibody with purified isotype IgG or by staining VTN\u2212/\u2212 tissue. Some sections were stained with rabbit anti-mouse VTN antibody (1:1000, ab62769, Abcam, RRID:AB 956454, (\nJia et al., 2019b\n). Rat anti-CD31 (1:500, #550274, BD Biosciences, RRID:AB 393571) was used to delineate endothelial cells and show perivascular VTN staining. To detect IL-6 expression in different cell types at 24 h after MCAO, 20 \u03bcm coronal frozen sections were stained with goat anti-mouse IL-6 antibody (1:100, AF-406-NA, R&D Systems, RRID:AB 354478) combined with rabbit anti-S100 (astrocytes, instead of lowly expressed GFAP, 1:250, Z0311, Agilent, RRID:AB 10013383), rat anti-CD11b (microglia, 1:200, 14-0112-82, ThermoFisher Scientific, RRID:AB 467108), mouse anti-NeuN (neurons, 1:500, 550274, BD Biosciences, RRID:AB 393571) or rat anti-CD31 (endothelial cells) antibody . All staining was followed by appropriate secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) to visualize the positive immunofluorescent staining. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.\n\nCell culture experiments\nPrimary astrocytes were isolated from P0-1 day old mouse pups as previously described (\nKang et al., 2012\n). Briefly, cortices were collected and digested in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. Tissue was dissociated in DMEM with 10% serum containing DNAse (1 mg/ml), centrifuged cell pellets collected and resuspended in medium containing 10% FBS [v/v], 2 mM L-Glutamine in DMEM. Cells were plated for 24 h in t75 culture flasks, washed to remove dead cells and then incubated for a further 7-10 days until confluent. After trypsinization, they were plated onto poly-D-lysine (50 \u03bcg/ml) and laminin (50 \u03bcg/ml) coated 6 well plates (50,000 cells/ml) for another 3 days. The cells were then treated with vehicle (culture medium plus 0.1% DMSO), vehicle plus FAK14 (10 \u03bcM) or vehicle plus PF573228 (10 \u03bcM, Tocris, #3239) for 4 h before RNA isolation. Cytokines were quantified by RT-qPCR by delta delta CT method and expressed relative to vehicle treated controls (n=3 independent experiments).\n\nStatistics.\nStatistically significant differences (\np\n\u2264 0.05) were determined using Graphpad Prism 7.

    "Methods": "Mice\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Johns Hopkins Medical Institute. For CCI experiments, surgeries were performed on female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River). For cortical stab injury experiments, we used male and female Slc6a4-EGFP BAC transgenic mice made by Dr. Charles Gerfen (NIH) as part of the GENSAT consortium (line RP23-39F11, BAC BX86, RRID: MMRRC_030692- UCD;\nGong et al., 2003\n). For labelled norepinephrine neurons, BAC transgenic mice in which cre recombinase was driven by the promoter of the dopamine-\u03b2-hydroxylase gene (GENSAT, STOCK Tg(Dbh-cre)KH212Gsat/Mmucd, Stock #032081-UCD, RRID: MMRRC_032081-UCD;\nGong et al., 2007\n) were crossed with the mTmG reporter line (Jackson Laboratory, Stock #007576, Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo/J, RRID: MGI:3722405;\nMuzumdar et al., 2007\n). All mice were group housed at up to 5 mice per cage on a 12 hour light/dark cycle. Mice were given food and water\nad libitum\n.\n\nControlled Cortical Impact\nCCI injury was performed as previously described (\nKajstura et al., 2018\n). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic device (Stoelting) with continued isoflurane delivery. The skin was retracted and fascia removed to expose the skull. A round craniotomy was made with an electric drill using a 2.7mm trephine drill bit (Fine Science Tools). The skull was removed and an electromagnetic impactor with a 1.5 mm tip (Leica Benchmark Stereotaxic Impactor model #39463920) was placed over the craniotomy site perpendicular to the brain surface in contact with the intact dura. The impactor was then retracted and then activated to impact the brain with a velocity of 4m/s, dwell time of 100 ms, and depth of 0.75 mm from the dural surface. Following impact injury, the skin was closed above the craniotomy using 9 mm wound clips (Fine Science Tools). Mice were given subcutaneous injections of Baytril (2.5 mg/kg) and Buprenex (0.01 mg/kg) and were monitored before being returned to group housing. Control mice received the same treatment (anesthesia, incision, staples, drug treatment) excluding the craniotomy and the impactor injury.\n\nStab Injury\nThe stab injury was performed as previously described (\nJin et al., 2016\n). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic device (Stoelting) with continued isoflurane delivery. A small dose of dexamethasone (0.04 mL at 2 mg/mL) was administered by subcutaneous injection prior to surgery to minimize potential swelling at the surgical site, and a subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine (0.3 mg/mL) was also given before surgery to alleviate pain. A 2 by 2 mm craniotomy was made overlying the right somatosensory cortex. With the pial surface exposed, a miniature blade (Surgistar, USM 6700) was placed on the dura with a stereotaxic device at a location that was roughly centered in the window but which was chosen to avoid major surface blood vessels. The blade was then slowly advanced into the brain to the depth of 2 mm. The blade was immediately retracted and saline-soaked surgifoam (Johnson & Johnson) was applied to stop bleeding, if necessary. A square cover glass was placed over the craniotomy and sealed with Metabond dental cement (Parkell). Mice were given a subcutaneous injection of Baytril (2.5 mg/kg), monitored for distress and then returned to group housing.\n\nTissue Preparation and Immunohistochemistry\nMice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). They were then sacrificed by intracardial perfusion with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Brains were then removed, incubated in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C and then cryopreserved in graded sucrose steps (15% and 30% for 24 hours each) at 4\u00b0C. Whole brains were sectioned on a sliding microtome (Leica) at 40 \u03bcm thickness and stored in PBS with Na-Azide (Fisher) at 4\u00b0C until use. Brain sections were washed in 0.3% TritonX100 PBS and then blocked for 2 hours at room temperature in 5% normal goat serum. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in primary antibodies. Double-labeling was performed with each marker of a neuromodulator and NeuN (to identify cortical layers). The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-TH (Millipore #AB152, RRID: AB_390204), rabbit anti-VAChT (Synaptic Systems #139103, RRID: AB_887864), rat anti-DAT (Millipore #MAB369, RRID:AB_2190413), chicken anti-GFP (Aves Labs #GFP-1010, RRID: AB_2307313) and mouse anti-NeuN (Millipore #ABN60; RRID: AB_2298767). Primary antibody dilutions were all 1:1000 with the exception of the anti-GFP primary which was used at a dilution of 1:6000. Sections were then washed in .3% TritonX100 PBS followed by overnight incubation in secondary antibodies at 4\u00b0C. Secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-chicken (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories #103-007-008, RRID: AB_2632418), Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories #115-586-146, RRID: AB_2338899), Alexa Fluor 647-labeled goat anti-rat (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories #112-606-062; RRID: AB_2338407), Alexa Fluor 647-labeled goat anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories #111-607-008; RRID: AB_2632470), and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories #111-547-003; RRID: AB_2338058). Secondary antibody dilutions were all 1:500. Sections were washed, mounted on slides, and coverslipped using Prolong Antifade Diamond mounting media. Full section thickness z-stack images were acquired using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 880 AxioExaminer.Z1) with a 1 \u03bcm step size.\n\nImage Analysis\nRaw confocal images were obtained as czi files using Zeiss Zen Black software, exported as channel merged z-stack tifs and analyzed using custom code written using the Anaconda Python distribution (Continuum Analytics). Full z-stack maximum projection images were used to set a detection threshold for pixels positive for either TH or VAChT signal. NeuN staining was used as a cortical layer marker and an indicator of tissue quality. Using an iterative threshold detection algorithm (\nKajstura et al., 2018\n), the intensity of all positive pixels were set to 255 (the highest value for an 8-bit image) and background pixels were set to 0. The fiber density quantification was expressed as the percent supra threshold pixels within image area.\nWe performed axon tracing on volume-matched maximum-projected image stacks using Imaris (Bitplane;\nFigure 8\n). TH+ axons were exhaustively traced within a 50 \u03bcm wide designated-rift area. Total axon length within stab rift area and the number of mid-rift axon crossings were measured. For colocalization studies, TH+ axon segments were exhaustively traced within a 75 \u00d7 75 \u03bcm\n2\nregion of interest using only the TH channel of the z-stack maximum projection image. These traces were then superimposed onto the corresponding DBH-GFP channel ROI and each segment was manually scored as either positive or negative for GFP. One-tailed student\u2019s t-tests were used to evaluate significance in layer-specific single time points. ANOVA tests were performed for layer-specific comparisons over time and any comparison across three or more groups.\nFigure 8.

    "Methods": "In vitro\ndigest\nRecombinant MMPs and PNN proteins aggrecan and brevican were incubated\nin vitro\nto assess MMP-dependent cleavage of PNN substrate. Recombinant human MMP-3 (Millipore Calbiochem, catalog # 444217) was used at a concentration of 5 \u03bcg/mL and recombinant human MMP-13 (Enzo Life Sciences, catalog # BML-SE246-0010) was used at a concentration of 17.5 \u03bcg/mL. Recombinant human aggrecan (R&D, catalog # 1220-PG-025) was used at a concentration of 62.5 \u03bcg/mL and recombinant human brevican (R&D, catalog # 5800-NC-050) was used at a concentration of 50 \u03bcg/mL. The broad-spectrum MMP-inhibitor GM6001 (Tocris, catalog # 2983) was used at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM. Enzyme and substrate were incubated together for two hours at 37\u00b0 C. Following incubation, an equal volume of 2X Laemmli buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol was added, heated for 5 minutes at 95\u00b0 C, resolved using SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were then stained with Coomassie Blue (BioRad, R-250) for two hours. Excess staining was removed using a de-stain solution containing 50% distilled water, 40% ethanol, and 10% glacial acetic acid. Membranes were placed into a total of three fresh de-stain solution containers for 20 minutes each. After the last de-stain, the membranes were allowed to air-dry and then scanned for image acquisition.\n\nWestern blot\nCortical tissue was dissected from post-mortem human brains (\nTable 1\n). Tissue was homogenized in a standard RIPA lysis buffer containing protease/phosphatase inhibitors. Samples were sonicated, spun down, and the soluble supernatant was separated. Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher, catalog # 23225). Samples were mixed with 2X Laemmli buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol, and heated for 5 minutes at 95\u00b0 C. Forty \u03bcg of total protein was loaded per lane and resolved in a 4% - 20% gradient polyacrylamide tris glycine gel (BioRad). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in a Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (BioRad) set to mixed molecular weight. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBST for 1 hour prior to overnight incubation with primary antibodies. The dilution of the primary antibodies were: MMP-3 (Abcam, catalog # ab52915, 1:1000), MMP-13 (ThermoFisher, catalog #MA5-14238, 1:220), aggrecan (ThermoFisher, catalog # MA3-16888, 1:2000), brevican (ThermoFisher, catalog # PA5-47563, 1:2000), GAPDH (Millipore, Catalog # MAB374, 1:5000). Membranes were washed multiple times the next day and incubated at room temperature with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, and followed by additional washes. Signal was detected using SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (ThermoFisher, catalog # 34580). Bands were visualized using an Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Band densitometry was conducted using ImageJ (NIH). Band density for all proteins of interest were normalized to GAPDH. A biological mixture was used as a standard control that was run on every gel in order to compare band density across different blots. When reprobing membranes for proteins of similar molecular weight, membranes were stripped with the Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (ThermoFisher, catalog # 21059) according to manufacturer\u2019s directions. Stripping efficiency was assessed each time by incubating membranes with ECL and exposing for an extended duration. After successful stripping, membranes were blocked again and probed for proteins as mentioned above.\nTable 1.\nPost-mortem human brain tissue demographics and clinical characteristics\nControls (n=15)\nHIV+ (n=26)\nAge\n51.1 +/\u2212 15.1 (100%)\n46.2 +/\u2212 7.1 (69%)\nGender\n9 male, 6 female (100 %)\n11 male, 5 female (62%)\nCD4 cell count\nN/A\n112.8 +/\u2212 123.5 (62%) range: 2\u2013471\nPlasma VL (copies/ml)\nN/A\n22975.3 +/\u2212 50312.5 (38%, 4/10 und.) range: 0 (und.)122642\nOpen in a new tab\n(% reported from total n); und. = undetectable\n\nSlice preparation and incubation\n21 \u2013 32-day old male and female C57BL6/J mice were used to prepare paired hippocampal hemi-slices in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and a protocol that had been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Georgetown University Medical Center. Following deep isoflurane anesthesia, mice were decapitated, and the brain was dissected in ice-cold sucrose-based cutting artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM) 252 sucrose, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 2 MgSO\n4\n, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 10 dextrose and bubbled with 95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n. Horizontal hippocampal slices were cut at 490 \u03bcm thickness using a vibratome (Leica, VT1000s). Slices were bisected to obtain paired hemislices for subsequent incubation in either control aCSF or aCSF containing hyaluronidase. The aCSF contained (in mM): 132 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 2 MgSO\n4\n, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 26 NaHCO\n2\n, 10 dextrose and bubbled with 95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\nat 26\u00b0 C. Slices were incubated for at least four hours before being moved to the recording chamber. Lyophilized hyaluronidase (Sigma, catalog # H4272) was reconstituted in aCSF prior to brain slice incubation. The final concentration of hyaluronidase in the incubation solution was 0.25 g/mL which was based on previously published work (\nBikbaev et al., 2015\n;\nSun et al., 2017\n).\n\nLocal field potential recordings\nLow-resistance glass microelectrodes (50\u2013150 K\u2126) filled with aCSF were used for recording local field potentials in hippocampal slices. The recordings were conducted in a submerged chamber and slices were perfused on both sides at a high flow rate (20 mL/min). The recording electrodes were placed in CA1 stratum radiatum. Comparisons between control and hyaluronidase-treated slices were performed with paired hemispheres. After baseline recording, gamma oscillations were induced by adding the cholinergic-agonist carbachol (carbamoylcholine chloride, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #: C4382) at a concentration of 40 \u03bcM into the recording chamber. Analysis of the LFP signal was performed using a custom MATLAB algorithm. A Gaussian FIR band-pass filter with corrected phase delay was applied between 1 \u2013 1000 Hz, after which additional band-pass filters were applied for theta (4 \u2013 12 Hz), low gamma (25 \u2013 55 Hz), and high gamma (65 \u2013 85 Hz) ranges. The power was computed by integrating the entire recorded block band-pass filtered signals. Traces in figures were additionally notch filtered at 60 Hz to correct for line noise. Spectrograms of LFP traces were calculated in MATLAB with a short-time Fourier transform, in 1 Hz frequency bins from 1 \u2013 100 Hz, and in 30ms time windows. Presented results display the Z-scored power to show temporal deviations from baseline. The average and standard deviation (SD) were computed for each frequency bin from a baseline recording before carbachol administration, and the carbachol-induced deviations for each frequency bin were computed as [P(t) \u2013 Average(P\nbaseline\n)] / SD(P\nbaseline\n).\n\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (Graphpad Software). Data were subjected to unpaired t-tests. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for relationships between protein levels in human brain tissue. All data are reported as mean +/\u2212 SEM and significance was set at p \u2264 0.05. Some human samples were omitted from the correlational analyses given that they did not have a value for at least one of the four probed proteins. Furthermore, an outlier analysis was conducted for each probed protein and identified outliers were omitted from subsequent analyses."

    "Methods": "Telemetry probe implantation:\nAll animal housing conditions, surgical procedures, and postoperative care were conducted according to the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the National Institutes of Health animal care guidelines. Animals were housed in a temperature and humidity-controlled room with a 12/12-hour light/dark cycle. Efforts were made to minimize unnecessary foot traffic and other potential environmental disturbances in the room. One week prior to SCI, a total of 24 na\u00efve 3 to 3.5 month old female Wistar rats (250-275 grams) were anesthetized (2% isoflurane) and implanted with telemetric blood pressure transmitters (model HD-S10, Data Sciences International, Inc., St. Paul, MN) into the descending abdominal aorta according to the manufacturer\u2019s surgical guidelines as previously reported (\nEldahan et al., 2018\n;\nRabchevsky et al., 2012\n). Telemetry probes were secured intra-abdominally by suturing to the ventral abdominal wall using non-absorbable silk sutures before closing the skin with 3-0 vicryl sutures. Animals were treated post-operatively as described below.\n\nSpinal cord injury:\nAll rats recovered from telemetry probe implantation for one week. A total of n=24 rats were anesthetized (ketamine, 80 mg/kg; xylazine 7 mg/kg, i.p.) and underwent a T3 laminectomy prior to complete transection of the T4 spinal cord (T4Tx) using a scalpel blade, as previously described (\nCameron et al., 2006\n;\nRabchevsky et al., 2012\n). Two independent observers confirmed complete spinal cord transection of each rat based on full separation of the rostral and caudal stumps. Immediately afterwards, gelfoam was placed into the transection site to achieve hemostasis before the overlying muscles were sutured with 3-0 vicryl and the skin stapled with wound clips (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL).\n\nCardiophysiological monitoring:\nHemodynamic data was recorded 24/7 (500Hz sampling rate) using implanted telemetric probes as described above using Dataquest A.R.T. acquisition system (Data Sciences International, Inc., St. Paul, MN). Rats were single-housed, with each cage placed directly on top of its corresponding data receiver plate (model RPC-1, Data Sciences International, Inc., St. Paul, MN). Raw telemetry files were stored in a single folder containing data for the entire study period to analyze daily blood pressure, heart rate, colorectal distension, and spontaneous AD (sAD).\nDaily blood pressure and heart rate values were calculated with Dataquest A.R.T. analysis system (Data Sciences International, Inc., St. Paul, MN) by averaging the corresponding 24-hour period. CRD data was calculated using the 30-second period immediately prior to balloon catheter inflation as a baseline for comparison with the 60-second average values during the duration of balloon inflation. The effect of experimental handling on resting blood pressure was evaluated by comparing the averaged mean arterial pressure during the 30-minute period prior to entering the animal housing room with the 30-minute period following handling and catheter insertion when animals were returned to their home cage for catheter acclimation. Un-induced sAD was analyzed with a modified version of our previously reported algorithm (\nEldahan et al., 2018\n;\nRabchevsky et al., 2012\n) implemented in Matlab software (The MathWorks, Inc., Natwick, MA). Briefly, this algorithm simultaneously processes 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) traces for instances where a rise in MAP of 20 mmHg or more above baseline is accompanied by a decrease in HR of at least 20 beats per minute (bpm). While this algorithm does not require such events to be sustained above baseline for a specific duration, it does require the rise in MAP over baseline to occur within a 35-second window. MAP rises accompanied by tachycardia (an increase in HR) were not included in these sAD detections. Notably, our modified algorithm screens for instances where multiple sAD detections occur within a 120-second window such that events beginning within two minutes of each other are counted as a single unified event. This modification is similar to recent sAD algorithms described by (\nMironets et al., 2018\n;\nWest et al., 2015\n). Following automated computer detected sAD events, a single human observer manually screened all detections to remove false-positive events stemming from technical artifacts, such as non-physiological rises in MAP associated with sudden animal movements. For each of the four daily injections (12:00 a.m., 6:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.), recordings were stopped simultaneously for all animals and an \u201cevent marker\u201d was placed for each animal immediately after injection to allow for accurate tracking of all injection time points. Routine animal care, including twice-daily bladder expression, was performed at 6 am and 6 pm along with corresponding treatment injections. Cardiophysiological recordings were paused during routine animal care and handling to minimize data artifacts.\n\nDrug administration and colorectal distension (CRD):\nGabapentin (GBP; 100 mg/kg, i.p, 4x daily, Spectrum Chemicals, New Brunswick, NJ) was injected after injury and then every 6 hours for 4 weeks. Daily body weights were recorded immediately prior to drug administration to ensure accurate dosages. On days 14, 21 and 28 post-injury, rats underwent 2 trials of CRD one hour after treatment. Rats were gently restrained using surgical towels leaving the lower body exposed for observation of hindlimb spasticity during CRD. After removing fecal pellets in the distal rectum, silicone balloon catheters (Coloplast Cysto-Care Folysil, 2-Way Pediatric Silicone Foley Catheter, Fr10 3 cc) were inserted 2.5cm into the rectum and secured to the tail with Transpore\u2122 tape. Bladder expression was performed immediately prior to catheter insertion. Following restraint and catheter insertion, rats acclimated for 20-30 minutes. All efforts were made to minimize distractions and potentially stressful stimuli. A hood fan was left running to provide white noise and buffer noise occurring outside of the experimental room. All CRD testing was performed in the same room that the animals were housed in regularly. For each CRD trial, the catheter balloon was inflated with 2.2 mL of air over the course of 5 seconds. Each distention trial lasted 60 seconds, separated by 30 minutes of rest. At 28 DPI, following the second CRD trial, a prolonged 90-minute session of intermittent CRD (30 second inflation periods separated by 60 seconds of rest) was performed to induce intraspinal c-Fos expression prior to euthanasia (\nEldahan et al., 2018\n;\nHou et al., 2008\n).\n\nAnimal Care:\nAll rats which underwent ketamine/xylazine anesthesia prior to cord transection received i.p. injections of the xylazine reversal agent antisedan (0.5 mg/kg Zoetis Inc., Kalamazoo, MI). Immediately after all surgical procedures, rats received 10 mL of subcutaneous lactated Ringer\u2019s solution. Post-surgical pain management was achieved with twice-daily buprenorphine injections (0.03mg/kg, s.c.; Reckitt-Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc., Richmond, VA) for three days. All rats received two daily injections of the antibiotic cefazolin (33.3 mg/kg, s.c.; WG Critical Care, LLC, Paramus, NJ) for 5 days post-surgery and twice daily manual bladder expression for 2-3 weeks or until they regained spontaneous bladder voiding reflexes without signs of urinary tract infection. Rats were housed one per cage with food (Envigo Tekland, 18% Protein Rodent Diet) and water ad libitum. A heating pad and surgical towel was placed between each cage and its corresponding telemetric receiver plate for the duration of the study period. Following telemetry implantation, body weight was recorded every morning during routine animal care procedures.\n\nTissue collection and immunohistochemistry:\nTerminal body weights were recorded, and rats received a fatal overdose of sodium pentobarbital within 15 minutes following the end of the 90-minute CRD session. After the loss of pinch-reflex in the forelimbs, the spleen was rapidly dissected after applying Bulldog clamps to the vascular bundle serving the spleen. Rats were then transcardially perfused with 0.1M PBS, the telemetry probes were rapidly explanted according to manufacturer\u2019s guidelines, which was followed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1M PBS. Excess fat and connective tissue were removed from the spleens and raw spleen weights were recorded prior to soaking them in 4% PFA overnight before flash freezing. The spinal cord caudal to the T4-transection site was carefully dissected and post-fixed for 3-4 hours in 4% PFA before being placed in 0.2M PB solution overnight at 4\u00b0C. Cords were then cryopreserved in 20% sucrose (in 0.1M PBS) with 0.02% sodium azide at 4\u00b0C until all cords sank, after which they were embedded in gum tragacanth mixed with 20% sucrose and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until cryosectioning (\nEldahan et al., 2018\n). Every fifth serial coronal cryosection (20uM) was collected and placed on a series of Superfrost Plus\u2122 slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). This cutting scheme results in 10 adjacent sets of slides with each slide containing 10 consecutive spinal sections separated by 1mm. Slides were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until further use.\nFor immunohistochemistry, slides were removed from the freezer and warmed on a 37\u00b0C slide warmer for 10 minutes then 3 x 30-min before a Pap-pen (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) border was applied to all tissue slides before washing in 0.1M PBS with gentle agitation. Slides were then blocked for 1-hour at room temperature in 5% normal serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in 0.1M PBS. Primary antibodies against presynaptic excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters were incubated for either 24-hours (synaptophysin and VGLUT2) or 72-hours (VGAT) then 24-hours (synaptophysin) in buffer containing 1 ug/ml mouse anti-synaptophysin (SYN) (Clone SY3; Synaptic Systems Cat #101-011) and 2 ug/ml rabbit anti-VGLUT2 (Synaptic Systems Cat #135-403) or 2 ug/ml rabbit anti-VGAT (Synaptic Systems Cat #131-002). Excess primary antibodies were washed 3x10 minutes in 0.1 M PBS before incubation with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit-Alexa488 (1:500) or biotinylated goat anti-mouse (1:200) for 24-hours at 4\u00b0C. Following removal of excess secondary antibody with 3x10 minute 0.1 M PBS washes, slides were incubated in tertiary solution containing 1:200 streptavidin conjugated Texas Red in 0.1 M PBS. Two series of tissue staining were performed, one for SYN and VGLUT2 and the second for SYN and VGAT, and all treatment groups were stained simultaneously using identical buffers and antibody lots; different SYN antibody lots were used in each staining set due to availability.\n\nImage acquisition and analysis\nHigh-resolution (2048 x 2048 pixels) images were captured with a 40x oil-immersion lens using a Nikon Ti Eclipse inverted confocal microscope paired with a C2+ controller system and Nikon NIS Elements Advanced Research software (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY, USA). Laser settings for each fluorescent marker were optimized on na\u00efve spinal cord tissues and maintained constant for all sections assessed. The pinhole size was maintained at 40 \u03bcM and pixel dwell time set to 4.4 seconds/pixel. A histogram was used to monitor pixel intensity and ensure that the total fraction of saturated pixels remained below 2% for all images.\nFrom the central plane of the tissue section, two additional optical sections 2 \u03bcM above and below (4 \u03bcM total thickness) were captured. Each optical section represented a thickness of 0.86 \u03bcM and 0.16 \u03bcM individual pixel size. After image acquisition, the optical plane with the highest mean fluorescence intensity was selected for analysis. Selection of the optical plane with the brightest staining helps to correct for potential issues with antibody penetration (\nFerguson et al., 2008\n). Synaptic quantification was performed using densitometric analysis. For each subject, 3 spinal sections centered on the L6/S1 spinal segment and separated by 1 mm were analyzed (see\nFigure 1\n). Cross-sections of the right dorsal horn were used for all animals with the rare exception of folded tissue sections, in which case the left dorsal horn was used. A local contrast was applied using a radius of 1.0 \u03bcM to more clearly delineate the border of individual SYN\n+\n, VGLUT2\n+\nand VGAT\n+\npuncta. Thereafter, each fluorescent channel was thresholded to exclude non-specific background signal. All contrast and threshold settings were optimized on na\u00efve spinal cord tissues and remained constant for all sections (see\nFigure 2\n). After applying a threshold for each fluorescent channel, a binary layer mask was created for each marker (SYN and VGLUT2 or VGAT) indicating the location of pixels above threshold. These two layers were then overlaid to create a third layer representing the area of overlap between markers. Using these three binary layers, either the area occupied by SYN, VGLUT2 or VGAT or the area occupied by the overlap of VGLUT2/SYN or VGAT/SYN puncta were measured using a standardized region of interest (ROI) measuring 175 x 175 \u03bcM. One ROI, designated \u201cR1\u201d, was placed the upper dorsal horn (laminae I-II) and the other, designated \u201cR2\u201d, was placed in the dorsal gray commissure (laminae X just above the central canal (see\nFigure 1\n). To control for potential variation in antibody labeling efficiency between sets of synaptic staining, data was normalized to na\u00efve control values within a respective set of staining. These methods were adapted from\nMcKillop et al. (2016)\nwho used a similar threshold-based method to identify and quantify areas occupied by presynaptic (SYN) terminals in the mouse spinal ventral horns after SCI as either glutamatergic (VGLUT1) or GABAergic (VGAT).\nFigure 1. Diagrammatic representation of synaptic quantification scheme.\nOpen in a new tab\n(\nA,B\n) Tissue from the L6/S1 spinal segment was sampled for histological analysis of synaptic density. High-resolution confocal images were acquired from laminae I-II of the upper right dorsal horn (\nB\n, R1) and the laminae X region containing the dorsal gray commissure (\nB\n, R2). (\nC\n) Volumetric reconstruction shows co-localization of VGLUT2 and Synaptophysin in 3D, indicating the co-occurrence of these presynaptic markers. Scale bars in\nC\n= 4 uM or 1 uM (inset).\nFigure 2. Representative threshold and overlap identification of excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals.\nOpen in a new tab\nAdjacent tissue sections were double-labeled with VGLUT2/Synaptophysin (\nA-F\n) or VGAT/Synaptophysin (\nG-L\n). Contrasted images (top rows\nA-C; G-I\n) were thresholded (bottom rows\nD-F; J-L\n) to segregate positive staining from background, and a mask was applied representing supra-threshold pixels in VGLUT2 (\nD\n), VGAT (\nJ\n) and Synaptophysin (\nE,K\n) channels. Co-localization of VGLUT2/Synaptophysin or VGAT/Synaptophysin was determined based on overlapping of signal (\nF,L\n). Images represent cropped and enlarged areas taken from the\nR1\nfield as shown in\nFigure 1B\n. Scale bar in\nF\n= 5 uM and applies to all photos.\nTo validate the densitometric analyses, quantitative co-localization analyses were also performed using the JACoP plugin (\nhttps://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/track/jacop.html\n) implemented in the ImageJ/FIJI platform. This plugin, which has previously been described in depth (\nBolte and Cordelieres, 2006\n), contains a collection of commonly used tools to measure intensity correlation and co-occurrence of dual-color molecular probes. The same ROIs used for density analysis were cropped for JACoP analysis. To reduce confounding influences of non-specific background pixels, a threshold was applied to restrict analysis to pixels containing positive staining. The Costes\u2019 automated thresholding algorithm was determined to yield inappropriately low thresholds, likely due to the high density of labeling and variability of pixel intensity reported to be problematic for appropriate automated thresholding and image segmentation (\nDunn et al., 2011\n). Therefore, threshold values were determined based on the background pixel intensity in a set of negative primary antibody control slides processed and imaged using identical settings. These threshold values were visually validated on a set of naive group images and subsequently applied equally to all images/treatment groups. The Manders\u2019 overlap coefficient (MOC) and fractional overlap coefficients (tM1 and tM2) were calculated using supra-threshold pixels with positive staining to avoid inflated results due to low-level background signal (\nBolte and Cordelieres, 2006\n). The Costes\u2019 randomization test was applied to a subset of images representing each experimental group (i.e. 3-4 images selected from 3 animals per group), which resulted in P values of 100%, along with R-values of 0.0 +/\u2212 0.001, indicating that the positive co-localization signal measured in our images was not attributed to statistical chance or haphazard signal overlap.\n\nStatistical Analyses\nFor daily body-weight, MAP, HR, spontaneous AD and spasticity measurements, a repeated measures two-way analysis of variance (2-way RM ANOVA) was performed with Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons post-hoc test when appropriate. The Geisser-Greenhouse correction was used for repeated measures analyses to provide additional rigor and minimize type-I errors. Unpaired t-tests were performed on CRD and spleen weight data. One-way ANOVA tests were used for synaptic histology, with Sidak\u2019s post-hoc analysis when appropriate. All statistical analyses were conducted with GraphPad Prism 7 software using alpha = 0.05."

    "Methods": "Animal surgery.\nAll animal work was conducted under Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)-approved protocols at Drexel University and at Temple University. For nerve injury, Male Sprague Dawley rats (150\u2013225 g) were anesthetized using isoflurane and then subjected to a unilateral conditioning sciatic nerve crush at mid-thigh level as previously described (\nTwiss et al., 2000\n) using a Dumont 0 forceps (\nSmith and Skene, 1997\n). Animals were euthanized at 1 h, 6 h, 18 h and 7 days after nerve crush and sciatic nerves (na\u00efve and injured) were collected proximal to the crush injury site with a corresponding level of na\u00efve nerve collection. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h, cryoprotected in buffered 30% sucrose at 4\u00b0C overnight, and processed for cryostat sectioning (10 \u03bcm thick). The contralateral nerve to crush injury was exposed but not manipulated to use it as a control (i.e., na\u00efve).\n\nDNA expression constructs.\nAll DNA constructs outlined below were sequence validated before use. All the constructs used for studying axonal translation through Calreticulin UTR elements were generated in the pcDNA3.1+ backbone (Invitrogen, V79020). For these, we used eGFP and mCherry sequences with an N-terminal myristoylation signal (\nMyr\nGFP and\nMyr\nmCherry, respectively). Diffusion limited\nMyr\nGFP reporter constructs, 5\u2019Calr-\nMyr\nGFP-3\u2019Calr, 5\u2032Calr-\nMyr\nmcherry-3\u2032Calr and 5\u2019Actb-\nMyr\nGFP-3\u2019Calr, were previously described (\nVuppalanchi et al., 2012\n). The Calr 3\u2019UTR from 5\u2019Calr-\nMyr\nGFP-3\u2019Calr was replaced NotI/XhoI with the segments corresponding to nt 1315\u20131412 (Calr 3\u2019UTR proximal element) or corresponding to nt 1413\u20131780 (Calr 3\u2019UTR distal element) of the rat Calreticulin mRNA (GenBank accession no.\nNM_022399\n) that were cut NotI/XhoI from the 3\u2032UTR deletion mutants constructs previously described (\nVuppalanchi et al., 2010\n) generating the vectors 5\u2032Calr-\nMyr\nGFP-3\u2032Calr\n1315\u20131412\nand 5\u2032Calr-\nMyr\nGFP-3\u2032Cal\n1413\u20131780\nrespectively. The\nMyr\nGFP segments from 5\u2032Calr-\nMyr\nGFP-3\u2032Calr\n1315\u20131412\nand 5\u2032Calr-\nMyr\nGFP-3\u2032Calr\n1413\u20131780\nwere replaced BamHI/NotI with the\nMyr\nmcherry fragment from 5\u2032Calr-\nMyr\nmcherry-3\u2032Calr generating the vectors 5\u2032Calr-\nMyr\nmcherry-3\u2032Cal\n1312\u20131412\nand 5\u2032Cal-\nMyr\nmcherry-3\u2032Cal\n1413\u20131780\nrespectively. To generate the construct 5\u2019Cal-\nMyr\nGFP-3\u2019Hmgb1, Calr 3\u2019UTR from 5\u2019Calr-\nMyr\nGFP-3\u2019Calr was replaced NotI/XhoI with the rat sequence of Hmgb1 3\u2019UTR that was cut NotI/XhoI from the construct with the rat Hmgb1 3\u2019UTR previously described (\nDonnelly et al., 2013\n).\nThe adenoviral vectors that express the sequences of eIF2\u03b1 mutants S51D and S51A (\nVuppalanchi et al., 2012\n) were used as PCR templates to generate the cDNAs of the eIF2\u03b1 mutants S51D and S51A. The primers were engineered to include 5\u2019 HindIII and 3\u2019 BamHI restriction sites in the cDNA products. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 58\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min for 35 cycles with a final 72\u00b0C extension for 10 min. The digested PCR products were subcloned into pECFP-N1 (BD Biosciences Clontech, #6900\u20131) to generate constructs encoding an in frame ECFP fused to the C-terminus of eIF2\u03b1S51D or eIF2\u03b1S51A (pS51D-ECFP and pS51A-ECFP respectively). The vectors that express mouse sequence of\nPERK\nwt\n(addgene plasmid # 21814) and mouse sequence of PERK\nkinase dead\n(addgene plasmid # 21815) were used as PCR templates to generate the cDNAs of PERK\nwt\nand PERK\nKinaseDead\n. The primers were engineered to include 5\u2019 NheI and 3\u2019 XhoI restriction sites in the cDNA products. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 58\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min for 35 cycles with a final 72\u00b0C extension for 10 min. The digested PCR products were subcloned into the pTagBFP-N vector (evrogen products, FP172) to generate constructs encoding an in frame BFP fused to the C-terminus of PERK\nwt\nor PERK\nKinaseDead\n(pPERK\nwt\n-BFP and pPERK\nKD\n-BFP respectively). Replacing K618 of PERK with alanine (K618A) abolishes the ability of the protein to undergo autophosphorylation or to phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 (\nHarding et al., 1999\n). Both constructs encoded an in frame BFP fused to the C-terminus of PERK\nwt\n(pPERK\nwt\n-BFP) or and PERK\nKinaseDead\n(pPERK\nKD\n-BFP), respectively. For siRNA-resistant pPERK\nwt_\nRescue-BFP and pPERK\nKD\n_\nRescue-BFP construct, 3 nucleotides of the siRNA-targeted regions (GGTCATGGCGTTTAGTAAG) were mutated in the plasmids pPERK\nwt\n-BFP and pPERK\nKD\n-BFP using QuikChange XL Site-DirectedMutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following primers were used: sense, 5\u2019- GCTGATTGGAAGGTA*ATGGCT*TTTAGC*AGGAAGGGAGGCCG -3\u2019 and antisense, 5\u2019- CGGCCTCCCTTCCAG*CTAAAA*GCCATT*ACCTTCCAATCAGC-3\u2019 (asterisks indicate mutated nucleotides).\nRat Calreticulin cDNA (GenBank accession no.\nNM_022399\n) was generated by RT-PCR and cloned into pTagBFP-N plasmid (evrogen products, FP172). For this, RNA (200 ng) isolated from rat DRG cultures was reverse transcribed using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). The cDNA was then amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 60\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min for 35 cycles with a final 72\u00b0C extension for 10 min. Primers spanning the coding sequence of Calreticulin (nt 1\u20131251) were engineered to include 5\u2019 XhoI and 3\u2019 SacII restriction sites in the cDNA products. The purified PCR product was cloned upsteam of BFP, generating pCalr-BFP. For siRNA-resistant pCalr-BFPrescue construct, 3 nucleotides of the siRNA-targeted regions (GTGCTGATCAACAAGGATA) were mutated in the plasmid pCalr-BFPusing QuikChange XL Site-DirectedMutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following primers were used: sense, 5\u2019-CAAGGGCAAGAACGTGCTA*ATCAAT*AAGGAC*ATCCGGTGTAAGGATG-3\u2019 and antisense, 5\u2019- CATCCTTACACCGGATG*TCCTTA*TTGATT*AGCACGTTCTTGCCCTTG-3\u2019 (asterisks indicate mutated nucleotides).\nThe vectors pGFP-Calr-3\u2019Actb and pGFP-Calr-3\u2019ACTG1 were generated as follow. 5\u2019Calr-\nMyr\nGFP-3\u2019Calr DNA was used as PCR template to amplify the sequence 5\u2019HindIII-GFP-3\u2019BamHI that was subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ backbone (Invitrogen, V79020) generating pGFP vector. Rat Calreticulin cDNA was amplified by PCR using pCalr-BFPrescue as template. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 56\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min for 35 cycles with a final 72\u00b0C extension for 10 min. Primers spanning the coding sequence of rat Calreticulin (nt 521251) were engineered to include 5\u2019NotI and 3\u2019XbaI restriction sites in the cDNA that was cloned in frame downstream the GFP sequence of pGFP generating pGFP-Calr. The rat sequences of 3\u2019Actb and 3\u2019 ACTG1 UTRs were amplified by PCR using as templates previously described vectors (\nWillis et al., 2007\n). The primers were engineered with 5\u2019XbaI and 3\u2019ApaI restriction sites. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 56\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min for 35 cycles with a final 72\u00b0C extension for 10 min. The digested PCR products were subcloned in pGFP-Calr downstream of Calreticulin sequence generating pGFP-Calr-3\u2019Actb or pGFP-Calr-3\u2019ACTG1. The GFP sequence of pGFP-Calr was replaced with the mcherry sequence HindIII/NotI generating the vector pmcherry-CalrRescue. The vector pmCherry-Calr was generated as follow. Rat Calreticulin cDNA was amplified by PCR using pCalr-BFP as template. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 56\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min for 35 cycles with a final 72\u00b0C extension for 10 min. Primers spanning the coding sequence of Calreticulin (nt 52\u20131251) were engineered to include 5\u2019 NotI and 3\u2019 XbaI restriction sites. The PCR product was used to replace the CalrRescue sequence on pmcherry-CalrRescue generating pmcherry-Calr.\n\nsiRNA depletion of endogenous Calreticulin and PERK mRNAs.\nshRNA sequences were expressed based on pSuper.puro (VEC-PBS-0007/0008, OligoEngine) with modifications. GFP sequence was subcloned PstI/NheI on the plasmid pSuper.puro generating the vector pSuper.GFP.puro. Calreticulin (pSUPERshRNA-Calr-GFP) or the PERK silencing plasmid (pSUPERshRNA-PERK-GFP) [target rat sequences GTGCTGATCAACAAGGATA (nt 525\u2013544, GenBank accession no.\nNM_022399\n) and GGTCATGGCGTTTAGTAAG (nt 929\u2013948, GenBank accession no.\nNM_031599\n), respectively], were generated according to the manufacturer instructions\n(OligoEngine)\n. Both Calreticulin and PERK shRNA target sequences were obtained through screening of a list of predicted shRNA targets sequence by the online siRNA design tool siDRM (\nGong et al., 2008\n). The control shRNA-nontarget (target sequence GCGCGATAGCGCTAATAAT) has no homology to any mammalian gene. For \u201crescue\u201d experiments, dissociated DRGs were co-transfected, as explained below, with the corresponding shRNA expressing plasmid and recombinant PERK or Calreticulin expression constructs and they were cultured for 48 h before imaging. Protein depletion were quantified by immunoblot 48 h after transfection as explained below.\n\nDRG explants culture.\nFertilized chicken eggs containing embryos of either sex were obtained from Charles River. At embryonic day 8 (E8), embryos were removed from the eggs and the DRG dissected out. Whole explants were cultured, using previously described protocols (\nP.l. Lelkes et al., 2006\n). The culturing substrata were coated with 100 \u03bcg/ml polylysine (SIGMA, P9011) in borate buffer overnight and 25 \u03bcg/ml laminin (Invitrogen) in PBS 4 h. Explants were cultured in defined F12H medium with NGF as previously described (\nKetschek and Gallo, 2010\n) and were used for experiments 24 h after plating in video dishes that provide a fixed substratum during severing, unlike coverslips placed in dishes. Six to eight cultures, each containing 3 DRG explants, were used per group and axons were manually severed\n~\n800 \u2013 1000 \u03bcm from the soma on one side of the explants using an interchangeable blade 1.5 mm cutting edge (Fine Science Tool, 10035\u201305). The unsevered explants in the same cultures served as internal controls. PERK inhibitor (GSK2606414, 90 \u03bcM), ISRIB (SML-0843, 300 nM) or DMSO was added 15 min before severing the axons. The cultures were immunostained 20 min after axotomy.\n\nCell culture and transfections.\nHEK 293 cells, were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented DMEM at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 on plastic dishes. Neuronal-like F11 cells, a hybridoma of embryonic rat DRG neurons and mouse neuroblastoma cell line N18TG (\nPlatika et al., 1985\n), were cultured in DMEM:F12, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 on plastic dishes. HEK-293 and F11 cells were transfected with 2 mg plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent per manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Invitrogen, 11668\u2013027). Transfected cells were cultured for 48 h before lysates collection.\nPrimary cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) were prepared from adult Sprague Dawley rats (175 g). These were dissociated using 5 units/\u03bcl collagenase type XI (Sigma, C9697) for 30 min. The dissociated DRGs were transfected using\nAMAXA Nucleofector\napparatus with the SCN Nucleofector kit (program G-8; Lonza, Inc.) and resuspended in DMEM/F12 (Corning, 16\u2013405-CV) with 10% horse serum (Hyclone) and cultured for 48h. The culture media was replaced at 20 h post-transfection with media containing 10 mM arabinofuranosyl cytidine (SiGMA-Aldrich, C6645) to decrease proliferation of non-neuronal cells. Dissociated DRG neurons were plated in videodishes coated with 100 \u03bcg/ml polylysine (SIGMA, P9011) in H2O for 1 h and 25 \u03bcg/ml laminin (Invitrogen) in PBS overnight. DRG neurons were plated in videodishes for 24 h in the experimental groups of DRG neurons treated with drugs (PERK inhibitor and ISRIB), or for 48 h in the transfected neurons studies, before axotomy and live imaging analysis. DRG neurons that were subject to axonal growth analysis were plated on coated coverslips and fixed 48 h after transfection using 8% paraformaldehyde (PFA) containing 5% sucrose for 15 min, washed in PBS, washed in deionized water, and mounted in no-fade mounting medium. The samples were imaged using a Zeiss 200 M microscope equipped with an Orca-ER camera (Hamamatsu) in series with a PC workstation running Axiovision software for image acquisition and analysis. Imaging was performed using a Zeiss Plan-Neofluar 20X objective (0.5 NA), 2X2 camera binning, minimal light exposure. Acquisition parameters were set to prevent saturation of the signal in axons\n\nImmunocytochemistry and quantification of fluorescence intensities.\nCultures of chicken DRG explants were fixed, 20 min after severing the axons, using 8% paraformaldehyde (PFA) containing 5% sucrose for 15 min; Samples were then blocked using 10% goat serum in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 (GST) and stained with primary antibodies for 60 min, washed in PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies for 60 min (Alexa 488, 1:400, Invitrogen), washed in PBS, washed in deionized water, and mounted in no-fade mounting medium as previously described (\nGallo and Letourneau, 1999\n). The following primary antibodies were used in conjunctions with the described fixation protocol above and at the described dilutions: P-eIF2\u03b1 (1:100; Cell Signaling, #9721), P-PERK (Thr980) (1:1000, cell signaling, #3179S) and Calreticulin (1:100; abcam, ab2907). For quantification of the levels of immunolabeled axonal proteins, samples were visualized using a Zeiss 200 M microscope equipped as described above using a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 40X objective (1.0 NA). Phase contrast images of the axons acquired at the same times as the GFP channel were used to determine the location of the axon. Camera binning of 2X2 was used and the acquisition parameters were set so that the entire dataset was within the dynamic range of measurement. A minimum of 40 axons was scored per culture in the peripheral halo of both severing axons and control axons (no severing axons). Only distal axons that were not contacting other axons were scored. The distal 30\u201350 \u03bcm from the tip of severed axon shaft remaining attached to the soma was defined as a region of interest using the Zeiss Axiovision software interactive measurement module, and the area of the region of interest was multiplied by the background subtracted mean intensity of the stain to obtain the total integrated staining intensity within the region of interest.\nFor sciatic nerve tissue sections, immunofluorescence was performed as previously published (\nMerianda et al., 2013\n). Tissue sections were equilibrated in PBS and then incubated in 20 mM Glycine for 10 minutes each with three changes followed by 0.25 M NaBH4 for 30 min to quench auto-fluorescence. Permeabilized with 0.2 % Triton X-100 for 15 min and incubated in blocking buffer for an hour at room temperature (\nVuppalanchi et al., 2010\n). Tissues were incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4 C. The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-Calreticulin (1:100; Stressgen), chicken anti-neurofilament Heavy NF H (1:800; Millipore), chicken anti-NF Light (1:400; Aves) and chicken anti-NF Medium (1:200; Aves). After several washes with PBS, samples were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies used were Alexa 488 conjugated anti-chicken (1:400; Invitrogen) and Alexa 555 conjugated anti-rabbit (1:500; Invitrogen). After series of washes in PBS, samples were mounted on Prolong Gold Antifade with DAPI (Invitrogen). Tissue sections were imaged using Zeiss LSM 700 laser scanning confocal microscope. All images were matched for acquisition parameters and post-processing. Calreticulin protein intensity was calculated from images that were matched for exposure time, gain, offset, and post-processing parameters. NF signals were used to trace axons.\nImage J\nwas then used to calculate the average pixels/\u03bcm\n2\nin these areas for >25 axons as described (\nMerianda et al., 2013\n;\nVuppalanchi et al., 2012\n).\n\nFluorescence recovery after photobleach.\nTo monitor localized translation of diffusion-limited\nMyr\nGFP or\nMyr\nmcherry reporters, we used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) as previously described (\nYudin et al., 2008\n) with minor modifications. Briefly, transfected DRG cultures were analyzed 48 h after transfection for intra-axonal GFP or mcherry fluorescence using Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope fitted with an environmental chamber to maintain 5% CO2 and 37 C over the duration of the imaging sequences. 40X C-Apochromat-Korr M27 water immersion objective (1.20 NA) was used for imaging, and the confocal pinhole was set to 4 airy units to ensure that the entire 2\u20134 \u03bcm thickness of axons was fully photobleached. DIC imaging was used to visualize neuronal processes; these are easily distinguished from Schwann cells in these cultures by presence of a terminal growth cone and length of several hundred microns. This was facilitated by the use of low-density cultures for these imaging studies. Prior to photobleaching, neurons were imaged every 60 sec for 2 min to establish baseline intensity using 488 and 555 nm lasers at 6.0 and 0.5% power, respectively. For photobleaching, the terminal \u2265 150 \u03bcm of distal axon was exposed to 100% laser power at 488 and/or 555 nm (for GFP and mCherry, respectively) to reach a pixel intensity of <5% of the prebleach signals (50 iterations). Recovery of\nMyr\nmCherry and\nMyr\nGFP was then monitored in a region of interest (ROI) comprising the terminal 50 \u03bcm of the axons every 60 sec. over 28 min. using 488 nm laser at 0.5% power and 555 nm laser at 6.0% power. To test for translation-dependent recovery, cultures were pretreated with 150 \u03bcM anisomycin (A9789, SIGMA-Aldrich) for 30 min or with 150 \u03bcg/ml cycloheximide (01810, SIGMA-Aldrich) prior to photobleaching as previously described (\nPacheco and Twiss, 2012\n). Transfected DRG cultures were imaged 1 h after exposure to 30 \u03bcM LPA (BioMol). Images were analyzed using ZEN 2010 software package (Zeiss) to calculate the mean fluorescence intensity within the ROI. Fluorescent intensity at each time point was normalized to the average pre-bleach intensity. Each construct was analyzed in \u2265 8 neurons over at least 4 independent transfections/culture preparations.\nTo monitor localized translation of diffusion-limited\nMyr\nGFP reporter in response to injury of DRG neurons, we used FRAP analysis with measurements in the cut end of the distal shaft of axons attached to the soma 20 min after axotomy. Briefly, DRG cultures were analyzed 48 h after transfection for intra-axonal GFP fluorescence using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope equipped with an Orca-ER camera (Hamamatsu) in series with a PC workstation running Axiovision software for image acquisition and analysis. Cultures were placed on a heated microscope stage (Zeiss temperable insert P with objective heater) for 15 min before imaging. Imaging was performed using a Zeiss Pan-Neofluar 100X objective (1.3 NA), 2X2 camera binning, minimal light exposure. Acquisition parameters were set to prevent saturation of the signal in axons. The FRAP assays were started 20 min after axotomy. Frames were acquired just before and immediately after bleaching and at 5 min intervals thereafter over 35 min time-lapse experiments. Photobleaching of\nMyr\nGFP was performed in the terminal 60\u201380 \u03bcm of distal axon remained attached to the soma, by using 30\u201345 s exposure in the entire imaging field to light from a 100 W source. Phase contrast images of the axons acquired at the same times as the GFP channel were used to determine the location of the axon at early time points in the FRAP when the GFP signal is otherwise too low to detect the axon. Only axons that were photobleached by 90% of their initial value were used in the analysis. To track recovery, the mean background subtracted intensity of GFP was measured in a fixed ROI at the terminal axon using the Zeiss Axiovision software interactive measurement module to calculate the mean fluorescence intensity within the ROI.\n\nLive imaging analysis of axonal growth after axotomy.\nDRG dissociated cultured were grown 24 h (drugs experiments) or 48 h (transfections experiments) and a single axon per DRG neuron was severed under phase-contrast with a pulled glass electrode set up in a manual micromanipulator (WPI, M3301R). The position of axotomy was set up in the distal axon close to the axonal tip (50\u2013100 \u03bcm from the end of the axon) and the position and appearance of the axons was recorded before and after the lesion. We monitored regeneration by imaging the movement of the axons from the lesion site right after cut by time-lapse microscopy every 5 min during 2h time-lapse imaging experiment. The analysis was performed under phasecontract on a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 inverted microscope, in series with a PC workstation running Axiovision software for image acquisition and analysis. Cultures were placed on a heated microscope stage (Zeiss temperable insert P S1 with objective heater 2000) associated to a temperature control module (TEMPCONTROLLER 2000\u20132, PECON). PERK inhibitor (GSK2606414, 90 \u03bcM) and ISRIB (SML-0843, SIGMA, 300 nM) drugs were added to the cultures 10\u201315 min before severing the axons. The site of axotomy was set up as cero \u03bcm and the axonal movement was quantified using Image J softward (NIH) by tracing from the axon tip the axonal length changes between time frames acquisitions. The values were represented every 5 min along the 2h time-lapse imaging experiment as the position of the axons at each time point respect the cut site (X axis). Negative values represent axonal positions retracted from the lesion site and positive values represent axonal positions elongated beyond the cut site.\n\nImmunoblotting.\nFor detection of endogenous PERK and Calreticulin knockdown, F11 cells were lysed 48h after transfection in RIPA buffer at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000\u00d7g, 4 \u00b0C; cleared lysates were normalized for protein concentration by Bradford assay and then processed for SDS/PAGE. Fractionated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes, blocked for non-specific binding using 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and then probed with anti-eIF2\u03b1 (1:1000, cell signaling, #9722S) or anti-PERK (1:1000, cell signaling, #3192S) overnight at 4 \u00b0C in blocking buffer. After washing in TBS, blots were incubated in HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:10,000; Cell Signaling, #7074) and developed with ECL\nPlus\n(Amersham). For detection of recombinants PERK (PERK-BFP) and Calreticulin (mcherry-Calr) recombinant proteins, HEK-293 cells were lysed 48h after transfection in RIPA buffer at 4\u00b0C for 20 min following the same immunoblotting protocol explained above and then probed with anti-RFP (1:1000, Allele, ABP-MAB-RT008) overnight at 4\u00b0C in blocking buffer. After washing in TBS, blots were incubated in HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:10,000; Cell Signaling, #7076) and developed with ECL\nPlus\n(Amersham). \u03b2-Actin Antibody (C4) (sc-4778, Santa Cruz) was uses as a loading control.\n\nStatistical analyses.\nThe GraphPad Prism 5 software package (La Jolla, CA) was used for all statistical analyses. Student\u2019s\nt\ntest was used to compare two means of independent groups. These included the data from axonal length measurements in the static imaging experiments as well as from quantified immunofluorescence signals from sciatic nerve sections and chicken explants experiments. Data generated from live imaging experiments as FRAP studies, were statistically tested by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni\npost hoc\ntest multiple comparisons to compare fluorescence signal intensities at different time points as previously published (\nPacheco and Twiss, 2012\n;\nVuppalanchi et al., 2010\n); time-lapse imaging to study axonal regeneration after axotomy was statistically tested by regression analysis. All values were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). P values of \u2264 0.05 were considered as significant."

    "Methods": "Materials\nAntibodies used for immunohistochemistry were as follows: vGlut1 (#135303, Synaptic Systems, Gottingen, Germany), vGlut2 (#135403, Synaptic Systems, Gottingen, Germany), bassoon (#141003, Synaptic Systems, Gottingen, Germany), tyrosine hydroxylase (#ab112, AbCam, Camdridge, MA) and NeuN (#MAB377; Millipore, Temecula, CA). For westerns, DOPA decarboxylase (#369003, Synaptic Systems, Gottingen, Germany), dopamine \u00df-hydroxylase (#ab209487, AbCam, Cambridge, MA), tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (#ab184505, AbCam, Cambridge, MA), dopamine D1 receptor (#ab216644, AbCam, Cambridge, MA), dopamine D2 receptor (#ab85367, AbCam, Cambridge, MA), dopamine transporter (#284003, Synaptic Systems, Gottingen, Germany), Lys63-linked ubiquitin (#05\u20131313, Millipore, Temecula, CA) and beta-actin (#a2228, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) antibodies were used.\n\nAnimals\nAll animal protocols were in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Homozygous male\nPink1\n\u2212/\u2212\n(B6.129S4-\nPink1\ntm1Shn\n/J) mice in a C57BL/6 background were originally generated from parents with a targeted germ-line deletion of exons 4\u20137 and a nonsense mutation at exon 8 (\nKitada et al., 2007\n) and knockout animals were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (JAX stock #017946; Bar Harbor, ME). This homozygous knockout mouse strain is maintained by Jackson Laboratories using a homozygote\nx\nhomozygote breeding scheme, and has been backcrossed to the C57BL/6J line for at least 8 generations. As a consequence of their breeding scheme, wild-type siblings are not commercially available from Jackson Laboratories. Age-matched C57BL/6J mice are recommended for use as control animals. All mice were individually housed upon receipt (6\u201310 weeks of age) to avoid barbering. Animals used for motor and behavioral analyses were tested in all tasks. All studies were performed by blinded observers, and animals were only identified by a numeric code.\n\nIsolation of mitochondria\nTo isolate mitochondria from brain tissues, Percoll density gradient centrifugation was used as previously described (\nLennartz, 2008\n). Hippocampi from two animals per experimental group were pooled together to increase the quantity of starting material. Tissue was homogenized in ice-cold isolation buffer (100 mM Tris pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 12% Percoll solution, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium molybdate, 100 nM okadaic acid, 1 mM PMSF and 10 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin) using 4 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer using the loose pestle followed by 8 strokes using the tight pestle. A small fraction of each homogenate was removed for determination of protein content. The remaining homogenate was then layered onto a discontinuous Percoll gradient (26% and 40% Percoll) and centrifuged for 10 minutes (30,700\nx\ng at 4\u00b0C). The enriched mitochondrial fraction was removed from the 26%:40% Percoll interface, transferred to clean centrifuge tubes, and diluted (1:4) with isolation buffer. Fractions were then pelletized by centrifugation (16,700\nx\ng at 4\u00b0C) for 10 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the samples were either immediately prepared for electron microscopy analysis or snap frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Samples underwent one freeze-thaw cycle prior to western analysis.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy\nImmediately after isolation, mitochondria from mice hippocampi were applied to freshly glow-discharged (30 sec) carbon-coated copper grids, blotted, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 for 15 minutes on a chilled plate. Grids were prepared for negative staining by washing once in HBS (HEPES buffered saline), then three times with water, followed by incubation in methylamine vanadate (Nanovan, Nanoprobes) for 20 seconds. Grids were then blotted and dried for at least 10 minutes prior to imaging. CCD images of isolated mitochondria were taken on a JEOL1400 transmission electron microscope running at 120 kV with a Gatan Orius SC1000 camera. Four to six grid squares were selected based on optimal density of structures within the grid square and high magnification images (15kx) of the entire grid square were taken to capture all mitochondria within the selected grid square.\n\nMitochondrial length measurements\nTo remove potential biases, the experimenters quantifying the length of individual mitochondria were blinded to the sample identities. To quantify mitochondrial length, CCD images were displayed in FIJI (NIH) and a line was drawn along the major axis of each mitochondrion. Length measures and aspect ratios (major/minor axis) were used for further analysis. Measures were extracted for 200 mitochondria/animal, separated by length into 500 nm bins, and summed across the six animals per group.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were euthanized by sodium pentobarbital overdose (100 mg/kg) then transcardially perfused with ice-sold saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were removed and post-fixed in perfusant for 24 hours before step-wise cryopreservation in sucrose (15% to 30% in PBS). Cryo-sections (40 \u03bcm thick) containing the dorsal hippocampus were permeabilized in 0.25% Triton-X100/PBS and blocked in 2.5% normal goat serum/2.5% BSA/PBS before incubation in primary antibody solutions overnight at 4\u00b0C. Tissues were then washed in PBS, incubated in species-specific secondary antibody solutions, washed again in PBS, and allowed to dry overnight before coverslipping with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Immunoreactivity within the hippocampus was assessed by carefully outlining the hippocampus and determining the mean fluorescent intensity value using\nImage J\nafter subtraction of background. Three sections/animal, corresponding to approximately \u22122.0 \u00b1 0.2 mm from bregma, were quantified and averaged.\n\nCell Counts\nCalbindin-D28k-positive cells in the dentate gyrus were counted using\nStereo Investigator\n(MicroBrightField, Williston, VT). The dentate gyrus was carefully outlined by an experimenter blind to the group designations. Cap zones of 2.5 \u03bcm were used to avoid counting cell caps. The counting grid was 100 \u00d7 100 \u03bcm using a counting frame of 25 \u00d7 25 \u03bcm. These parameters were chosen based on preliminary counts in order to \u201cmark\u201d 100\u2013150 cells/section. Calbindin-D28k-positive cells in 3 sections/animal, corresponding to approximately \u22122.0 \u00b1 0.2 mm from bregma, were counted and averaged.\n\nWestern Analysis\nMice were deeply anesthetized with isofluorane, exsanguinated, and hippocampal tissues dissected under ice cold artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) and snap frozen on dry ice. Total protein homogenates were prepared using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 5 mM NaF, 5 mM Na\n2\nMoO\n4\n, 1 mM DTT, and 1X cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO). Total protein concentration was measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay using BSA as the reference standard. Sample aliquots were diluted into 1X\nWes\nsample buffer and protein content equalized. Target proteins were quantified using an automated capillary immunoassay system (\nWes\nsystem; Protein Simple, San Jose, CA). Immunoreactivity was detected with a luminol-peroxide solution and a series of timed exposures were collected. The images were analyzed using\nCompass\nfor SW (version 3.1.7; Protein Simple). Results were normalized against Actb, and presented as percent control.\n\nImmunoprecipitation\nTissues were homogenized as described in the\nWestern Analysis\nsection, and 100 \u03bcg extract was diluted into 1 ml of RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 140 mM NaCl) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Diluted extracts were precleared for 3 hr by incubation with 20 \u03bcl protein A-agarose (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), followed by overnight incubation (on a rotator) in 20 \u03bcl protein A-agarose and 5 \u03bcg phospho-TH (ser40) antibody at 4\u00b0C. Agarose beads were collected by centrifugation (5 min, 1,000\nx\ng) and washed five times with RIPA buffer. Following the final wash and bead collection, the bound proteins were removed by incubation in 1X\nWes\nsample buffer for 10 min at 65\u00b0C. These extracts were then used for western analysis to examine K63-linked ubiquitination and TH levels.\n\nRNA isolation and quantitative PCR\nTissues from the hippocampus, striatum, and region containing the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra were quickly dissected under ice-cold aCSF and snap frozen on dry ice. Tissues were homogenized on ice in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in lysis buffer as described in the\nWestern Analysis\nsection, and immediately after disruption a portion of the homogenate was diluted 1:5 into a solution containing 4 M guanadinium thiocyanate, 25 mM Na\n3\nC\n6\nH\n5\nO\n7\n, 0.5% sarcosyl, 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Total RNA was then isolated by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation (\nChomczynski and Sacchi, 1987\n). RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry, and cDNA was generated from either 1 \u03bcg (hippocampus) or 0.5 \u03bcg (striatum, VTA/SN) total RNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit in a 20 \u03bcl reaction following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA levels were quantified by Taqman probe (Applied Biosystems) using a CFX Connect (Biorad Instruments). Data was normalized against internal reference RNAs (Actb and Gapdh) for each sample using the formula \u0394C\nT\n= C\nT\n(TH) \u2013 C\nT\n(average Actb:Gapdh), then \u0394\u0394C\nT\nvalues were calculated using the wild-type striatum as the reference. Data is presented as the group mean \u00b1 SEM.\n\nWire hang task\nGrip strength was tested using the wire hang task. A 2 mm gauge wire was suspended in place from a height of 35 cm. For each trial, the animal was allowed to hang until falling. Animals were tested in three trials with a 10 minute inter-trial interval.\n\nRotarod\nRotarod performance was assessed using an ENV-576 Rotarod from Med Associates (Fairfax, VT). Mice were placed by hand on the rotating rod, facing away from the direction of rotation. The initial rotation speed started at 4 rpm and gradually increased to 40 rpm over a 4 minute period. The time the animal remained on the beam without falling off (or if the animal failed to continue walking but held onto the rotating rod for three complete rotations) was recorded. Each mouse was given 3 trials per day, which were averaged.\n\nDigiGait Analysis\nGait analysis was carried using a DigiGait (Framingham, MA). Mice were placed on the transparent treadmill and forced to walk/run at a fixed velocity of 20 cm/sec on a level gradient. Bumpers in front and behind the animal are used to restrict the mouse and discourage \u201criding\u201d on the treadmill. Bumper separation was 15 cm. A high-speed camera (150 fps) aimed at the ventral surface of the mouse recorded paw steps which were digitized for analysis. Settings used for defining the paw area were adjusted, as needed, to ensure fidelity of the measures. Mice were initially allowed to run on the treadmill for a period of 2 seconds, followed by a 10 second rest period. This procedure was repeated 3 times to ensure that all animals would run on the treadmill. For gait analysis, mice were run on the treadmill for a period of 8\u201310 seconds, and a 3 second video was selected (based on mouse being centered in the camera field and actively walking) for analysis. Gait metrics (stance width, angle of paw, stride length, braking speed, propulsion speed, and swing speed) for each paw were collected separately. Forepaw and hind paw measures were averaged within an animal before comparison across groups.\n\nSpontaneous alternation\nSpontaneous alternation was tested in a plus maze consisting of four 30 cm \u00d7 6.5 cm \u00d7 10 cm (L \u00d7 W \u00d7 H) closed arms connected to a central hub. Each animal was tested in a single 8 minute trial in which the mouse was placed in the central hub and allowed to freely explore the maze. Movement in the maze was recorded using a CCD camera. The maze was cleaned with 70% alcohol between animals. An arm entry was counted if the animal\u2019s entire body, including the tail, entered the arm. Reentries, wherein an animal immediately re-enters the same arm it just left, were excluded (\nLennartz, 2008\n). Alternation was calculated using the method of\nRagozzino et al. (1996)\n, wherein a successful alternation was counted if in five consecutive arm entries, the animal chose four different arms (\nRagozzino et al., 1996\n). The percent alternation was calculated as the number of successful alternations out of the total number of possibilities.\n\nContext Discrimination\nThe context discrimination task was adapted from the contextual fear conditioning protocols previously described by\nFrankland, 1998\n(\nFrankland et al., 1998\n). Prior to initiating training, independent wild-type and\nPink1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice were assessed for their shock threshold, essentially as described previously (\nRodriguiz and Wetsel, 2006\n). Both groups displayed overt reactions to the shock at the 0.3 mA threshold. A 0.7 mA shock (>2X threshold) was employed to generate a fear response. The context discrimination task consists of two conditioning chambers (a \u201cshock\u201d and a \u201csafe\u201d chamber), which share some features (e.g. size, shape) but differ in others (e.g. visual cues, smell, and flooring). Animals were first pre-exposed to each chamber one day prior to training. Training consisted of morning and afternoon sessions, during which the animals were exposed to either the shock chamber or safe chamber in alternating sessions. A mixed exposure protocol was used, in which half of the animals were exposed to the shock chamber in the morning session then exposed to the safe chamber in the afternoon session, while the other half were exposed to the safe chamber followed by the shock chamber. In the shock chamber, animals received a mild foot shock (2 s, 0.7 mA) 148 sec after being placed in the chamber. Animals remained in the chamber for an additional 30 sec before being returned to their home cage. In the safe chamber, animals again remained in the chamber for a total of three minutes, but no foot shock was delivered. This training procedure was repeated for four days. An overhead CCD camera creates an image every 100 msec which is segmented into individual pixels for analysis of freezing behavior using\nEthovision XT\nsoftware (Leesburg, VA, USA). Movement was defined as a change in 0.1% of the pixels. To ensure the accuracy of these measures, random videos were hand-scored by an investigator. The percent of time the animals remained frozen within each chamber was used as an index of fear memory. The difference in freezing response between the shock and safe cages was used as an indicator of discrimination.\n\nMarble burying and open field tasks\nAnxiety was measured using the marble burying and open field tasks. The marble burying test as described in\nAngoa-Perez et al. (2013)\nwas used to measure anxiety-like behaviors(\nAngoa-Perez et al., 2013\n). Standard polycarbonate rat cage with fitted filter-top covers were filled with unscented mouse bedding material to the depth of 5cm. Twenty standard black glass marbles (15 mm diameter, 5.2 g) were placed gently on the surface of the bedding in 5 rows of 4 marbles. The mouse was then allowed to remain undisturbed in the cage for 30 minutes. After test completion, two scorers (blind to the genotype of the mouse being tested) counted the number of marbles buried. A marble was considered buried if two-thirds of its surface area was covered by bedding. Fresh bedding was used for each animal. Open field testing was conducted in an 18 \u00d7 18 inch container. Mice were allowed to explore the chamber for a period of 5 minutes. Movement in the maze was tracked using\nEthovision XT\nsoftware. For analysis, the chamber was segmented into 36 equal sized bins. The number of entries and the time spent in the center of the open field (12 \u00d7 12 inch; comprised of 16 bins) was compared to assess anxiety-like behavior.\n\nPreparation and injection of\nSKF38393\nSKF38393\nstock (20 mg/ml) was prepared in saline and diluted prior to injection to give a final solution containing 0.25 mg/ml\nSKF38393\n. For testing performance in spontaneous alternation, mice received either 1.0 mg/kg\nSKF38393\nor an equal volume of vehicle (i.p.) 30 minutes prior to testing. For testing in the contextual discrimination task, each mouse received 1 mg/kg\nSKF38393\nor saline 30 min prior to each training session (i.e. prior to being placed in either the \u201cshock\u201d or \u201csafe\u201d cage). Thus, for the contextual discrimination task, each mouse received 2 injections/day, for a total of 8 injections over the four training days.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll data was subjected to a Shapiro-Wilk normality test and an equal variance test prior to analysis. Cell counts, fluorescent intensity and western data were analyzed across groups using a two-tailed Student\u2019s t-tests for unpaired variables. Mitochondria data was binned into groups based on length, and compared across groups using a Chi Square test. For assessing spontaneous alternation across conditions (pre,\nSKF38393\ntreatment, and washout) between wild-type and\nPink1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice, a two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used, followed by\npost-hoc\nanalysis with correction for multiple comparisons. For context discrimination, freezing behavior recorded within a group was analyzed across time and between contexts using a repeated measures two-way ANOVA. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM."

    "Methods": "Organotypic Co-culture of Spinal Cord, DRG, and Peripheral Nerve\nOrganotypic cultures were prepared using spinal cord from mice that express YFP in motoneurons (B6.Cg-Tg[Thy1-YFP]16Jrs/J: (\nFeng et al., 2000\n), DRGs from mice that express RFP in all neurons (ROSA mT/mG), and peripheral nerve from non-expressing C57Bl6 mice. All procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. Two basic configurations of the model were prepared:\nMotor Only\n, in which a spinal cord slice innervates a peripheral nerve segment with green fluorescent motor axons (\nFigure 1\n), and\nDual\n, in which spinal cord and DRG contribute both green fluorescent motor axons and red fluorescent sensory axons to generate a mixed nerve in which axons are color-coded by modality (\nFigure 2\n). The\nDual\nmodel was first used without modification to examine the interaction of regenerating sensory and motor axons, and was then modified to explore the effects of delaying sensory regeneration or of knocking down expression of the adhesion molecules NCAM and L1CAM. Throughout the following discussion each axon population is referred to first by the basic culture configuration, Motor Only or Dual, to which is appended specific descriptors when needed (e.g. Dual, Sensory Delay). This group descriptor is then followed by the axon type being considered, sensory axons or motor axons (e.g. Dual, Sensory Delay: motor axons).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nSteps in the construction of a Motor Only culture. Upper left: a custom PDMS frame is fabricated and bonded to a glass culture dish. Upper right: the Transwell\n\u00a9\ninsert is modified by removing the plastic well, leaving only a ring of plastic to support the membrane. Lower left: the device is assembled by seating the plastic ring into the PDMS frame, which supports the membrane 1mm above the floor of the culture dish. The space within the PDMS enclosure beneath the membrane holds 1 cc of culture medium. Lower right: a spinal cord slice is placed on the membrane in contact with a segment of peripheral nerve that serves as a new ventral root. One week after the culture is set up, when green motor axons have re-populated the peripheral nerve, it is transected and the freshly cut end is placed on a collagen-laminin hydrogel.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nThe configuration of Dual cultures. A reversed segment of P4-P5 wild-type femoral nerve is used to blend sensory and motor axons into a color-coded mixed nerve. The former muscle branch of the femoral nerve is opposed to the ventral exit zone of the spinal cord slice, and the former cutaneous branch is joined end-to-end with the peripheral nerve emanating from the DRG. The nerve is then reinnervated in a retrograde fashion so that green motor and red sensory axons intermingle in the former nerve trunk as shown on the right. When this nerve is transected, sensory and motor axons grow out on an unstructured surface in direct contact with one another.\nMotor Only cultures (\nFigure 1\n; n=11) were prepared from neonatal (P4-P5) mice using a modification of our earlier technique (\nSiddique et al., 2014\n;\nVyas et al., 2010\n). Mouse pups were chilled until all movement ceased, then decapitated. Their spinal cords were removed through a ventral approach and suspended in dissection medium (Hanks Balanced salt solution [HBSS, Gibco, Grand Island, NY], 4.3 mM sodium bicarbonate, 10mM HEPES [4\u20132-Hydroxyethyl, piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid], 33.3 mM D-glucose, 5.8 mM magnesium sulfate, 0.03% BSA and penicillin/streptomycin [Gibco]) to facilitate debridement of dura and root fragments. Lumbar spinal cords were then cut into 350 \u03bcm transverse sections with a McIllwain tissue chopper and placed on Transwell\n\u00a9\ncollagen-coated membrane inserts (Corning, Acton, MA.). The Transwell\n\u00a9\nsystem was modified by removing the walls of the insert, leaving only a ring of plastic to support the membrane, and by suspending it in a low-profile poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) base (\nFigure 1\n). These modifications facilitated imaging cultures directly from above, rather than from below through plastic and fluid, and improved accessibility for microsurgery. The culture was completed by opposing a segment of wild-type P4-P5 peripheral nerve to the ventral root exit zone to capture and channel regenerating motor axons. For successful reinnervation to occur, the cut face of the nerve must be in direct contact with transected motor axons as they exit the ventral surface of the spinal cord slice; if axons escape onto the surface of the membrane, they cannot be recaptured.\nCultures were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO\n2,\nand were nourished by culture medium that contained 50% minimal essential medium (Gibco), 25% HBSS, 25% heat-inactivated horse serum (Hyclone, Logan UT), 25 mM HEPES, 35mM D-glucose, 2 mM glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. The reservoir in the PDMS base holds 1 cc of medium, which was changed every third day. Glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF, 70 ng/mL; R&D systems Inc, Minneapolis MN) and insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1, 50 ng/mL; Peprotech Inc, Rocky hill, NJ) were added to the medium during culture preparation to protect newly axotomized neurons from apoptosis (\nVyas et al., 2010\n), but were not included in subsequent medium changes.\nCultures were supported for one week during which motor axons fully reinnervated the peripheral nerve segment. The portion of the nerve farthest from the spinal cord section was then raised from the Transwell\n\u00a9\nmembrane with microforceps, and cells that had migrated from the nerve onto the membrane during the week of incubation were carefully removed to insure that the regeneration environment was not influenced by Schwann cells. The nerve was then transected with microscissors 3\u20135 mm from the spinal cord, and the freshly-cut end placed on an unstructured collagen/laminin hydrogel (\nFigure 1\n). We found that, once the nerve had been incubated for one week, no additional cells migrated from the nerve when it was transected. The hydrogel was made by mixing 400 \u03bcl collagen type I solution (3 mg/ml, ThermoFisher Scientific), 50 \u03bcl 10\u00d7PBS, 50 \u03bcl 7.5% sodium bicarbonate and 5 \u03bcl laminin (1 mg/ml, ThermoFisher Scientific) on ice to prevent polymerization. This solution was then placed in 10mm \u00d7 4 mm PDMS frames and polymerized in a 37\u00b0 incubator for 20 minutes. When hydrogels had gained sufficient tensile strength they were grasped with microforceps, lifted from the PDMS frame, and transferred to the surface of the Transwell\n\u00a9\nmembrane. Cultures were then imaged daily for five days or once after 5 days of regeneration (see\nData Collection and Analysis\nfor breakdown).\nPreparation of Dual cultures (\nFigure 2\n; n=26) was similar to that of motor only cultures, but also involved harvest and placement of DRGs. Two- to four-week-old ROSA mT/mG mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of xylazine (16 mg/Kg) and ketamine (100 mg/Kg) before decapitation and exsanguination. Lumbar DRGs were excised through a ventral approach by sequentially removing lumbar intervertebral discs and vertebral bodies. DRGs were then dissected free, taking great care to preserve several millimeters of both dorsal root and peripheral nerve to lessen the stress imposed upon the neuron by proximal axotomy. Femoral nerves were excised from P4-P5 wild-type mice and placed on the Transwell\n\u00a9\nmembrane with the muscle branch opposed to the ventral root exit zone of the spinal cord slice and the cutaneous branch opposed end-to-end to the peripheral nerve emanating from the DRG. During the following week sensory and motor axons reinnervated the femoral nerve segment in a retrograde direction, joining in the former femoral nerve trunk to produce a mixed nerve with intermingled green fluorescent motor axons and red fluorescent sensory axons. The remainder of the procedure followed the protocol already described for pure motor cultures.\n\nExperimental Manipulations\nThe Dual culture model was used as described to study the interaction of regenerating sensory and motor axons (n=8), and was modified to delay sensory axon regeneration relative to motor regeneration (Dual, Sensory Delay; n=7), and to evaluate the contributions of NCAM (Dual, NCAM siRNA; n=5) and L1CAM (Dual, L1 siRNA; n=6) to heterotypic adhesion of sensory and motor axons (total 26 Dual cultures).\nSensory axon regeneration was delayed by crushing the peripheral nerve extension of the DRG at the time of nerve transection and hydrogel placement (\nFigure 3\n). As a result, motor axons could grow out on the hydrogel immediately, but sensory axons had to regenerate 2\u20133mm within the nerve before reaching its cut end, and their appearance on the hydrogel was thus delayed by 2\u20133 days. The role of adhesion molecules in the interaction of sensory and motor axons was evaluated by injecting and electroporating the DRGs with siRNA to NCAM or L1CAM (Dharmacon) to disrupt their expression (\nFigure 4\n:\nSaijilafu et al., 2011\n).\nFigure 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nModification of the dual culture model to delay sensory axon regeneration. One week after the culture is set up the femoral nerve trunk has been reinnervated by both sensory and motor axons and is transected and placed on the collagen/laminin hydrogel. At the same time, the femoral branch attached to the DRG is crushed to selectively degenerate sensory axons throughout the femoral graft. Motor axons are thus able to grow out from the transected nerve onto the hydrogel without being influenced by sensory axons for the first 2\u20133 days.\nFigure 4.\nOpen in a new tab\nModification of adhesion molecule expression with siRNA. At the time of initial culture set-up DRGs were injected with siRNA to either NCAM or L1, then electroporated to internalize the siRNA construct.\nThe siRNAs were dissolved in the buffer provided by the manufacturer. Four-week-old ROSA mT/mG mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of xylazine (16 mg/Kg) and ketamine (100 mg/Kg), and their L3 and L4 DRGs were surgically exposed. One \u03bcl of siRNA solution (50 pMol \u03bcl\n\u22121\n) was injected into each DRG using a Picospritzer III (pressure: 30 psi; duration: 8 ms). Immediately thereafter electroporation was performed using tweezer electrodes powered by a BTX ECM830 Electro Square Porator (five 15 ms pulses at 35 V with 950 ms interval). After electroporation, DRG\u2019s were placed on the culture membrane and the dual culture was constructed as described previously. Additionally, Western blots were performed on DRGs one week after injection and electroporation to confirm the deletion efficacy for both siRNAs (\nFigure 5\n).\nFigure 5.\nOpen in a new tab\nWestern blot of DRGs 1 week after injection of siRNA to NCAM (left) or L1 (right). Expression of NCAM is reduced substantially, and expression of L1 is eliminated.\n\nData Collection and Analysis\nCultures were imaged at 10\u00d7 with a Nikon Eclipse E600 fluorescent microscope equipped with Nikon GFP and TRITC filter cubes, a motorized stage, and a Spot CCD camera. Eight cultures in which motor axons regenerated alone (Motor Only), six in which sensory and motor axons regenerated together (Dual) and an additional seven dual cultures in which sensory axon regeneration was delayed (Dual: Sensory Delay) were imaged daily for five days. The remaining 16 cultures were imaged once after five days of regeneration. Cultures were maintained throughout the imaging process in a Takai-Hit INU on-stage incubator that controlled temperature, humidity, and CO2 level. NIS-Elements Microscope Imaging Software was used to generate and individually flatten z-stacks of the 6\u201318 microscope fields needed to encompass an entire culture. These images were then opened in Photoshop to adjust their contrast and brightness and to stitch the images together to form a single composite of the entire culture. A Photoshop layer containing a protractor with concentric lines at 0.25 mm intervals from the cut end of the peripheral nerve was then superimposed upon the composite image. Regeneration was evaluated by separately counting the green and red axons that crossed the lines delimiting each 0.25 mm of growth.\nTo evaluate the significance of our findings, we examined sensory and motor axon counts in two ways. First, to assess the synchrony of the onset of regeneration, we compared the number of axons crossing the 0.25 mm grid line at successive time intervals in three axon populations: sensory axons (Dual: sensory), motor axons growing alone (Motor Only), and motor axons growing with sensory axons (Dual: motor). Second, we evaluated the extent of regeneration in all experimental groups by plotting the percentage of axons counted at the 0.25 mm grid line that extended to each of the more distant grid lines after 5 days of regeneration. The number of axons at 0.25 mm was taken to represent 100%, and the percentage of these axons that reached each subsequent distance was calculated as the ratio of the number of surviving axons at that distance to the number present at 0.25 mm.\nIn the process of evaluating the synchrony of the onset of regeneration we found that it was not appropriate to assume a normal distribution (Shapiro Wilk text, p<.05), so we present descriptive data evaluated for this analysis as median and interquartile range (25\nth\nand 75\nth\npercentile, maximum and minimum). Comparisons in the number of axons crossing the 0.25 mm grid line between cultures were made using Poisson regression. Main effect variables were axon type (Motor Only, Dual: Sensory, and Dual: Motor) and time in hours (24, 48, 72, 96, 120). The interaction between axon type and time allowed for the test of a differential relationship between axon regeneration and time among axon types.\nComparisons in the proportion of axons present at 0.25 mm that crossed each subsequent protractor grid line (interval= 0.25 mm) were made using a non-parametric test of equality of the medians with a chi-squared continuity correction applied. This model was expanded to test for the effect of knocking down expression of L1CAM and NCAM on axon regeneration. Type I error threshold was set at 0.05. All analyses were conducted in Stata IC, version 14 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX).\nDual cultures were further analyzed to determine the percentage of motor axon length that was directly opposed to sensory axons. Composite images were imported into Wolfram Mathematica and cropped accordingly. To improve the contrast between green and red axons, images were adjusted using a pre-set function, Image Adjust. The \u201cpoint\u2013and\u2013click\u201d feature in the Graphics Drawing Tools was used to define endpoint coordinates of short line segments that defined portions of each green motor axon that were 1) contacting sensory axons, or 2) extending without sensory axon contact. These sets of coordinates were then compiled into a list. A \u201cloop\u201d was used to add together the total distances between the successive sets of coordinates. The totals from each category were then used to determine the percentage of motor axon length that was adherent to sensory axons within each dual culture."

    "Methods": "Animals\nExperiments were conducted on 32 adult, male, Sprague-Dawley rats weighing ~350g (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Experimental procedures were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the\nNIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n(2011). Rats were fed\nad libitum\n, monitored daily for their body weights and behavior, and were exposed to 12-hour light-dark cycle. Intrapleural injections and terminal procedures were conducted under anesthesia, whereas intraperitoneal injections were performed while awake. Toe pinch and corneal reflexes were absent during anesthesia; blood pressure and heart rate responses to the toe pinch and were also absent during terminal EMG studies. All rats were sacrificed via transcardial perfusion.\n\nExperimental Design\nA total of 32 rats were studied. Different sets of rats were used for electrophysiology and phrenic motor neuron count (Day 8,\nn\n= 21), and protein analysis experiments to quantify protein expression prior to total phrenic motor neuron loss (Day 5,\nn\n= 11, see\nFigure 1\n). In electrophysiological experiments, we tested the hypothesis that A\n2a\nreceptor antagonist enhances phrenic motor neuron survival and preserves diaphragm activity following CtB-Saporin injections. In immunohistochemistry experiments, we tested the hypothesis that A\n2a\nreceptor expression is upregulated in CtB-identified phrenic motor neurons following CtB-Saporin injections prior to complete cell death.\nFigure 1:\nOpen in a new tab\nTimeline for experimental procedures: 36 hours after bilateral intrapleural CtB-Saporin injections (Total dose: 50 \u03bcg/rat), rats were treated with A\n2a\nreceptor antagonist (KW6002; also known as Istradefylline) twice daily, attaining a total dose of 1 mg/kg/day. Terminal EMG measurements and phrenic motor neuron counts were performed on day 8 (24 h after the last A\n2a\nreceptor antagonist injection). Because almost all phrenic motor neurons died by day 8, an earlier time-point when phrenic motor neurons were still viable was selected for immunohistochemical evaluation of protein expression and localization. Thus, for molecular analyses, rats were sacrificed and perfused at Day 5 post-CtB-Saporin injection.\n\nDrugs\nCtB-Saporin (50 \u03bcg, Catalog No: IT-14, Advanced Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA) was dissolved in 80 \u03bcl phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and administered intrapleurally to target phrenic motor neurons (25 \u03bcg per side) using 50 \u03bcl Hamilton syringes having semi-blunt needles of 23-gauge and 6 mm length through the fifth intercostal space anterior axillary line (\nMantilla et al., 2009\n). Additionally, 50 \u03bcg CtB (Catalog No: 227039, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was dissolved in 25 \u03bcl sterile water and injected intrapleurally (12.5 \u03bcl on each side) to label the spared phrenic motor neurons.\nRats were administered with A\n2a\nreceptor antagonist starting 36 hours after CtB-Saporin injections, until 6 hours before perfusion at day 5 or 24 hours before EMG recordings (to minimize acute effects of the drug on recordings) and subsequent perfusion. KW6002 (Istradefylline, Sigma-Aldrich) is a selective, blood-brain-barrier-penetrable A\n2a\nreceptor antagonist (\nYang et al., 2007\n). KW6002 was dissolved in DMSO (37\u00b0C) at 9.3 mg/ml concentration, sonicated, aliquoted and stored at 4\u00b0C in dark. Prior to use, KW6002 was re-warmed and administered intraperitoneally twice daily at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg (1.0 mg/kg per day total). The volume of DMSO administered to the vehicle rats was also normalized to body weight (~17\u201320 \u03bcl DMSO per injection, ~50 \u03bcl/kg).\n\nEMG Recordings\nRats were anesthesized with isoflurane (3% induction, 2\u20132.3% maintenance), then converted to urethane anesthesia (1.5\u20131.6 g/kg) via tail vein intravenous fluid delivery (R-99, Razel Scientific Instruments, Saint Albans, Vermont). To maintain fluid and acid-base balance, Lactated Ringer\u2019s Solution was administered via tail vein as necessary. Right femoral artery was catheterized to measure arterial pressure and to collect arterial blood sample to measure PO\n2\n, PCO\n2\n, pH, and standard base excess (ABL90 Flex, Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). Body temperature was maintained at 37.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C with a custom-built heating table and rectal thermistor (Physitemp, model 700 1H).\nTeflon-coated stainless-steel multistrand electrodes (AS631, Cooner Wire, Chatsworth, CA) were uninsulated for a length of ~2 mm under a dissecting scope on graph paper. A pair of electrodes were implanted in parallel to the muscle fibers to the mid-costal region of diaphragm muscle following laparotomy. To eliminate potential influences of upper airway muscles, the trachea was cannulated with tubing matching upper airway volume. Experiments were performed during spontaneous breathing with an inspired gas composition regulated to match desired blood-gas values (\nTable 1\n). Mechanical ventilation was not performed at any point during the experimental protocols. Following surgical procedures, isoflurane was cleared from the tissues by waiting at least 1 hour or the total isoflurane exposure period, whichever is longer.\nTable 1:\nPhysiological variables at baseline and maximal chemoreceptor stimulation in control, vehicle-treated CtB-Saporin injected and istradefylline-treated CtB-Saporin animals 24 h following the last treatment\nCondition\nControl\nCtB-Saporin + Vehicle\nCtB-Saporin + KW6002\nPaCO\n2\n(mmHg)\nBaseline\n43.9\u00b10.5\n44.7\u00b10.6\n44.7\u00b11.3\nMCS\n58.6\u00b11.2\n59.8\u00b11.3\n57.0\u00b11.5\nsBE (m Eq/L)\nBaseline\n2.4\u00b11.0\n2.5\u00b11.2\n2.0\u00b11.1\nMCS\n3.5\u00b10.9\n2.3\u00b11.4\n4.3\u00b11.0\nPaO\n2\n(mmHg)\nBaseline\n92.1 \u00b11.6\n93.7\u00b11.3\n97.9\u00b13.3\nMCS\n46.3\u00b11.8\n41.4\u00b12.0\n45.3\u00b12.2\nTemperature\nBaseline\n37.3\u00b10.2\n37.4\u00b10.2\n37.5\u00b10.2\nMCS\n36.9\u00b10.1\n36.8\u00b10.1\n37.5\u00b10.1\nMAP (mmHg)\nBaseline\n94.8\u00b15.2\n96.2\u00b17.3\n96.6\u00b15.8\nOpen in a new tab\nEMG signals were differentially amplified (1000x) and bandpass filtered (10\u20131000 Hz) using a biopotential amplifier (Model 1800, A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA, USA) prior to digitization at 10 kHz (Powerlab, AD Instruments, Colorado, United States). Since root-mean-squared (RMS) EMG correlates with force generated by various muscles including diaphragm muscle (Fuglevand et al., 1993; Lawrence and De Luca, 1983; Mantilla et al., 2010), it was used to estimate EMG amplitude using a 50-ms sliding window.\nSpontaneous EMG signals were recorded in supine position at 4 different diaphragm activation levels: (1) Eupnea (i.e. PO\n2\n>85 mmHg and PCO\n2\n~45 mmHg). To attain these blood-gas values, inspired O\n2\nwas slightly supplemented (FiO\n2\n= 21\u201326%) (2) Maximum chemoreceptor stimulation (MCS; FiO\n2\n= 10.5%, FiCO\n2\n= 7%). (3) Augmented breaths/sighs during MCS (RMS EMG amplitude > 2 x Eupneic value, presenting post-sigh apnea). Augmented breaths elicit near-maximal respiratory muscle activation (\nSeven et al., 2013\n;\nSeven et al., 2014\n;\nSeven et al., 2018c\n).\n\nImmunohistochemistry and Image Acquisition\nImmunohistochemistry was performed to count the phrenic motor neurons at day 8 and to evaluate protein expression and phosphorylation at day 5. Protein analyses were performed at day 5, because vehicle-treated CtB-Saporin group had nearly no surviving phrenic motor neurons by the 8th day. All rats were perfused transcardially using 0.01 M PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.01 M PBS at the pH of 7.4 and 4\u00b0C. Rats perfused at day 8, had received their last A\n2a\nantagonist injection ~24 h ago. On the other hand, rats perfused at day 5, had received their last A\n2a\nantagonist injection ~4 h ago. Spinal cords were harvested, post-fixed at 4\u00b0C in 4% PFA overnight, and cryo-protected in 20% sucrose for 1 day and 30% sucrose for 3 days until sinking. C3, C4, and C5 spinal segments were sectioned at the transverse plane at 40 \u03bcm thickness using a freezing microtome (SM2010R, Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). Sections were stored in antifreeze solution (30% glycerol + 30% ethylene glycol in 0.01 M PBS at the pH of 7.4). All sections were uniformly sampled throughout C3\u20135 spinal segments for each protein of interest, washed (3x) in 0.01 M PBS, and blocked in the blocking solution (5% normal donkey serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h. Sections were incubated in primary antibodies and 2.5% normal donkey serum, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at 4\u00b0C for 2 days. Then, sections were washed in PBS and incubated with their respective secondary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h. After the final washes, sections were mounted on charged slides with hard-set anti-fade solution (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA). Slides were imaged at 20x magnification (Numerical aperture: 0.75) with a fluorescence microscope (BZ-X710, Keyence Co., Osaka, Japan). The same exposure times and excitation intensities were used for all groups.\nPhrenic Motor Neuron Counts.\nTwelve sections per rat were systematically sampled from the C3-C5 spinal segments. CtB-labeled phrenic motor neurons were immunostained using goat anti-CtB primary antibody (1:2500, catalogue no: 227040, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and anti-goat secondary antibody (1:1000, Alexa Fluor 488; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Imaging was performed with a GFP filter (BZ-X, model no: OP-87763) with exposure time of 1/35 s. CtB-positive motor neurons with intact nuclei were counted; phrenic motor neuron number was averaged per slice/ side.\nProtein Expression, Phosphorylation and Localization.\nSix sections per animal were systematically sampled from C3-C5 spinal segment and double-labeled for CtB and the protein of interest. CtB-labeled phrenic motor neurons were immunostained using goat anti-CtB primary antibody (1:2500, catalogue no: 227040, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and anti-goat secondary antibody (1:1000, Alexa Fluor 488, Thermo Fisher). Other proteins were immunostained with the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-A\n2a\nreceptor (1:500, 05\u2013717, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), rabbit anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (1:500, 4370, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (1:500, 4370, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit anti-phospho-JNK (1:250, 4668, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA); and the anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:500, Alexa Fluor 594, Thermo Fisher). The exposure time for A 2A receptor labeling was 1/5 s. For the other proteins, sectioning module of the Keyence Imaging Software was used with the exposure times of 1/5, 1/4, and 1/3 s for phospho -ERK1/2, phospho-p38 MAPK, and phospho-JNK, respectively.\n\nImage Analysis\nFluorescence images for A\n2a\nreceptors, p-p38 MAPK, and pJNK were analyzed based on colocalization with the CtB-labelled phrenic motor neuron somata. A histogram was created for each image channel containing CtB immunostaining (green). For each CtB image, a threshold was set at a binarized pixel intensity value corresponding to a fixed percentile (P\n99.2\n) for all rats and images to account for changes in signal and background intensities. Using binarized images, CtB+ areas greater than 200 \u03bcm\n2\nwere used to mask the other channel to assess immunofluorescence intensity of the protein of interest.\n\nStatistics\nEMG recordings were averaged within each experimental condition to represent the value for each condition for each rat. Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA. When the outcome of ANOVA was significant, Tukey-Kramer honestly significant difference test was used to assess pairwise differences\npost hoc\n. Data was presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean. JMP 14.0 software was used for statistical calculations."

    "Methods": "Mice\nAdult wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J female and male (3\u20134 months old) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and were allowed to acclimate in the animal facility at Drexel University for at least 1 week prior to the start of experiments. Mice were housed in groups of 5 in a 12hour day/night cycle and had access to food and water\nad libitum\n. All animal experiments under protocol #20627 were approved by Drexel University\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n\nEAE Induction and Motor scoring\nMice were immunized using subcutaneous injections containing an emulsion of 100\u03bcg of MOG\n35\u201355\npeptide and complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA; InvivoGen, San Diego, California) supplemented with 200\u03bcg of heat-inactivated\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\nH37Ra in CFA as previously described (\nKrementsov et al., 2014\n). These injections were administered 50\u03bcL each to the posterior right and left flanks. All mice received a booster MOG/CFA injection 7 days after the first injection. The CFA control group of mice received the same immunization without the MOG\n35\u201355\npeptide. Mice were evaluated on a daily basis for both body weight changes and signs of motor deficits. Motor scores were assigned based on the following: 0 \u2013 no motor deficits, 1 \u2013 loss of tail tone, 2 \u2013 fully flaccid tail, 3 \u2013 hind-limb paralysis, 4 \u2013 forelimb paralysis, 5 \u2013 moribund, 6 \u2013 death (\nBrambilla et al., 2011\n).\n\nPain Assessment\nMechanical allodynia was assessed using the Von Frey test as described previously (\nDellarole et al., 2014\n). Briefly, Von Frey hair monofilaments were used to assess sensitivity to a mechanical stimulus administered to the hindpaw of each mouse. Mice were placed in individual clear plexiglass chambers elevated on a mesh-wire platform and allowed to acclimate for 30 minutes. The von Frey hair filaments were applied to the plantar surface of each hindpaw using the up-down method of analysis as previously described (\nChaplan et al., 1994\n). If no reaction is seen to the administered monofilament, a monofilament with a slightly greater diameter is used. This is done for a series of 5 trials once the first positive pain response is noted. The paw withdrawal threshold is then measured in grams (g) of force, with thresholds typically ranging from 0.0 to 2.0 g. Hindpaw withdrawal was only considered a pain response if paired with at least one or more of the following actions: looking at the hindpaw, stimulus avoidance behavior, tucking the tail under stimulated hindpaw, and/or licking the stimulated hindpaw, which are indicative of cognitive awareness of the stimulus as being painful. Baseline testing was done a week prior to EAE induction and then pain was assessed on a weekly basis.\n\nIsolation of Leukocytes from Spinal Cord and Flow Cytometry Staining\nMice were sacrificed 31 days post-immunization (dpi), perfused with PBS and spinal cords were harvested and kept in cold MACS buffer. All samples were homogenized and dissociated through a 70\u03bcm filter and washed in ice-cold MACS buffer (PBS pH7.2, 0.5% BSA, 2mM EDTA). Single-cell suspensions were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 10 min at 300\ng\n. Myelin was removed by incubation of the samples with myelin removal beads II for 15 min at 4\u00b0C, and purification through a LD column (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The myelin-free cell suspensions were then centrifuged for 10 min at 300 x\ng\nand resuspended in MACS buffer at a concentration of 10\n7\ncells/mL. The percentages of macrophages and microglia were determined by flow cytometric analysis using FITC-anti-CD45 and PE/Cy7-anti-CD11b (Miltenyi Biotec, 1:100). Data were acquired using a BD FACS Canto (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and analyzed with FlowJo (TreeStar, Ashland, OR).\n\nLuxol Fast Blue Staining\nAnimals were perfused at 31 dpi with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 30 dpi. Brain and lumbar spinal cord were embedded in paraffin and microtome-cut into 10\u03bcm thick sections and placed onto slides. Sections were deparaffinized and hydrated in 95% EtOH. The slides were immersed in Luxol fast blue solution and incubated at 56\u00b0\u221260\u00b0C overnight. The slides were then immersed in 55% EtOH to remove excess stain and rinsed in dH\n2\nO. Differentiation was done through a quick immersion in a lithium carbonate solution followed by 70% EtOH until grey and white matter can be distinguished. Sections were then dehydrated and mounted with ClearVue\u2122 Mountant XYL (Thermo Scientific).\n\nWhole Tissue Protein Extract\nAt 31 dpi animals were deeply anesthetized with Ketamine (215mg/kg) and Xylazine (43mg/kg), and perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) until blood was thoroughly removed from the circulatory system. Tissue was then isolated from the cortex, hippocampus, and lumbar spinal cord and quickly frozen on dry ice. Ti ssue was homogenized in RIPA buffer (10mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 150mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX) and phosphatase inhibitors (Biovision, Milpitas, CA), and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. on a rocker. The samples were then centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 15 minutes at 13,200RPM. Protein concentrations were determined using the\nDC\u2122\nprotein assay (Biorad, Hercules, CA).\n\nSynaptosome Protein Extract\nBrain\nAnimals were anesthetized at 31 dpi with Euthasol (0.2mL/kg) until unresponsive to toe pinch and perfused with HEPES perfusion buffered sucrose solution (2mM HEPES pH 7.4, 320mM sucrose, 2mM EGTA, 10mM Na pyrophosphate, 1mM Na orthovanadate, 10mM NaF, 0.1mM PMSF) and cortex and hippocampus were collected and quickly frozen on dry ice. The cortical and hippocampal tissues were homogenized in HEPES homogenization buffered sucrose solution (2mM HEPES pH 7.4, 320mM sucrose, 2mM EGTA, 10mM Na pyrophosphate, 1mM Na orthovanadate, 10mM NaF, 1\u03bcg/mL aprotinin, 1\u03bcg/mL leupeptin, 0.1mM PMSF) and centrifuged at 1,000xg for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C.The supernatant (S1) was collected and the 1\nst\npellet (P1) was kept as a protein/synaptosome preparation purity control (\nSupplemental Fig.1\n). The supernatant S1 was then spun at 17,000xg for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatant 2 (S2) was collected and pellet 2 (P2) representing the synaptosomal fraction was resuspended in 120\u03bcl of HEPES homogenization buffer.\nSpinal Cord\nSince the spinal cord contains a high amount of white matter that can interfere with the isolation of synaptosomes, 40\u03bcl of myelin removal beads were added to the S1 fractions, and incubated for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C on a rocker. The samples were then centrifuged at 5,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The myelin-depleted S1 supernatants were then processed as above, and the resulting synaptosomal P2 fractions were resuspended in 100\u03bcl of HEPES homogenization buffer.\n\nWestern blotting\nProtein resolution was done using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8\u201315% gels, transferred to nitrocellulose (Turbo blot, Biorad) and blocked in 5% non-fat milk (Biorad) in 1x TBS-T (10mM Tris-HCL pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20). Membranes were probed with antibodies against: myelin basic protein (MBP, rat, 1:15,000, Millipore, Burlington, MA); 2\u20193\u2019 cyclic nucleotide 3\u2019 phosphodiesterase (CNPase, rabbit, 1:1000 Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1, rabbit, 1:750, Proteintech, Rosemont, IL); glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, mouse, 1:1000, Santa Cruz), post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95, mouse, 1:5000, BioLegend, San Diego, CA); vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1, mouse, 1:1000, Neuromab, Davis, CA); gephyrin (mouse, 1:1000, Santa Cruz); glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65, rabbit, 1:1000, Millipore); Glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST, rabbit, 1:1000, Cell Signaling), and gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA\nA\nR, rabbit, 1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies. Proteins of interest were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce, Waltham, MA) and band intensity was quantified using Quantity One\u00ae software (Biorad). Data were normalized for each sample to the total amount of protein loaded through visualization with Ponceau S solution (Sigma) and expressed as percent of na\u00efve group (\nSupplemental Fig.2\n).\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis of EAE motor scores were conducted using two-way ANOVA and per day analysis using Bonferroni\u2019s multiple comparisons test. Cumulative disease index was analyzed using Mann-Whitney test. Two-way ANOVA was used to assess changes in withdrawal thresholds. Western blots and flow cytometry were analyzed using t-test for single comparisons. P\u22640.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "2.1. Animals and SCI model\nFemale wild-type C57Bl/6 mice between 8 and 9 weeks of age were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME), housed in groups of 3\u20135, and allowed to habituate for 7 days prior to use. Female ADRB2 knockout (KO) mice backcrossed onto a C57Bl/6 background were kindly provided by Dr. Douglas Tilley from Temple University (\nGrisanti et al., 2018\n).\nTo determine the mitochondrially biogenic effect of formoterol in the spinal cord under physiological conditions, na\u00efve mice were treated with 0.1 mg/kg formoterol i.p. once daily for 48 h, followed by euthanasia via anesthesia overdose and isolation of the T9\u201313 region of the spinal cord and the gastrocnemius muscles.\nFor SCI studies, mice were randomized into sham and SCI groups. Animals were anesthetized with 10 mg/kg ketamine and 6 mg/kg xylazine via i.p injection and continuously monitored for spontaneous breathing. Mice underwent a complete single-level laminectomy at the 11th thoracic vertebrae (T11). The vertebral column was clamped and stabilized at the upper thoracic and lumbar levels, and a controlled contusion with a force of 80 kilodynes (Kdyn) and dwell time of 0 s was administered using the Infinite Horizon IH-0400 impactor (Lexington, KY) with the dura intact as previously described (\nScholpa et al., 2019\n). Sham mice received laminectomy only. Manual bladder expression was performed twice daily until functional recovery. Injured mice were further divided into formoterol- or vehicle-treated groups. Animals were weighed daily and groups were euthanized 21d post-SCI via anesthesia overdose. Spinal cords were removed and gastrocnemius muscles were isolated and weighed. Tissues were flash frozen for analysis. All studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Arizona in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the National Institutes of Health\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\n2.2. Drug treatment\nFormoterol fumarate dehydrate was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and dissolved in saline/1% DMSO to 0.01, 0.03 or 0.1 mg/mL. Mice were treated intraperitoneally (i.p) daily with either 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 mg/kg formoterol or vehicle control beginning 8 h after injury.\n\n2.3. Transmission electron microscopy\nApproximately 4 mm\n2\nsamples of thoracic spinal cord and gastrocnemius were fixed overnight in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PIPES buffer (pH 7.4) then transferred to PBS at which point they were delivered to the University of Arizona Microscopy Alliance, where they were placed in 0.1 M PIPES buffer (pH 7.4) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Samples were then transferred to 0.1 M PIPES/Glycine buffer for 30 min at room temperature, then washed in deionized water (diH\n2\nO) twice for 5 min each, placed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h, washed twice in diH\n2\nO for 10 min, then stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 h and washed again in diH\n2\nO for 10 min. Samples were then dehydrated with increasing ethanol dilutions (5 min, 50, 70, 90, 100%) and acetone (2 \u00d7 5min), infiltrated with 1:1 acetonitrile/Spurr\u2019s resin overnight, then 100% Spurr\u2019s resin for 24 h and flat-embedded overnight at 60 \u00b0C. Sections (80 nm) were cut on an RMC PTXL ultramicrotome, placed onto uncoated 150-mesh coper grids and counterstained with 2% lead acetate for 2 min. Spinal cord and skeletal muscle sections were viewed with an FEI Tecnai Spirit Transmission Electron Microscope (Hillsboro, OR) operated at 100 kV and TIFF images (8 bit) captured via an AMT XR41 CCD digital camera (Woburn, MA) at a magnification of 8200X, creating an 11.95 \u00d7 11.95 \u03bcm field, or 11,500\u00d7 creating an 8.96 \u00d7 8.96 \u03bcm field, respectively. For the spinal cord, images of the white matter, particularly myelinated axons were captured. In all cases, 4\u20135 images were analyzed per sample and the average mitochondrial number and area per field calculated.\n\n2.4. Locomotor capability assessment\nLocomotor capability was assessed using the ten-point (0\u20139) Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) (\nBasso et al., 2006\n) by an observer blinded to experimental groups. Each mouse was observed for 3 min, with bladder expression taking place prior to assessment. Animals were observed 24 h after surgery and every other day thereafter until euthanasia. Sham animals maintained a BMS score of 9 throughout the experiment.\n\n2.5. RNA expression\nTotal RNA was extracted from the spinal cord and skeletal muscle using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) based on the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. cDNA was synthesized using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit and qPCR performed using 500 ng of cDNA template and SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Fold changes were calculated using the \u0394\u0394Ct method.

ND1, a mitochondrial gene, was measured and normalized to the nuclear encoded gene \u03b2-actin.\n\n2.7. Immunoblot\nProtein was extracted from the spinal cord and skeletal muscle using RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100), 1 mM sodium fluoride and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Samples were agitated for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C and then centrifuged at 14,000 \u00d7\ng\nfor 15 min and the supernatant collected. Protein was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid assay, and 10\u201312 \u03bcg of protein was separated via electrophoresis using 4\u201315% SDS-PAGE gels, then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk or BSA in TBST and incubated overnight with primary antibodies with constant agitation at 4 \u00b0C. Membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized using chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) on a GE ImageQuant LAS4000 (GE Life Sciences, Pittsburg, PA). Optical density was determined using Image Studio Lite software. Primary antibodies used were as follows: MuRF-1 (1:1000, ECM Biosciences, Versailles, KY), p-Akt (S473, 1:1000, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), t-Akt (1:1000, Cell Signaling), p-FoxO1 (S256, 1:1000, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), t-FoxO1 (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), PGC-1\u03b1 (1:1000, Abcam), TFAM (1:1000, Abcam), ATP Syn \u03b2 (1:1000, Abcam), \u03b1-tubulin (1:1000, Abcam), GAPDH (1:1000, Abcam).\n\n2.8. Histopathological analysis\nSpinal cord tissues were processed as previously described (\nScholpa et al., 2019\n). Briefly, mice were transcardially perfused with 0.1 M PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). A 6 mm segment centered on the injury sight was frozen in OCT at \u221280 \u00b0C and cryosectioned into 10 \u03bcm coronal sections. Eriochrome cyanine (EC) staining for myelin was used to distinguish damaged and spared tissue (\nPatel et al., 2017\n;\nScholpa et al., 2019\n). Analyses were performed in a blinded fashion, with respect to treatment group, using an Aperio AT2 Slide Scanner and ImageScope software (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL). Lesion and percent spared tissue areas were quantified across 2 mm of spinal cord centered on the epicenter at 100 \u03bcm intervals using the Cavalieri method (\nPatel et al., 2017\n;\nScholpa et al., 2019\n), totaling 21 sections per animal.\n\n2.9. Statistical analysis\nTissue isolated from a single animal or a single animal\u2019s behavior represented\nn\n= 1. Number of mice used for each analysis can be found in the Figure Legends. For behavior and body weight, data were analyzed using Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. Differences between two groups were analyzed using two-tailed student\u2019s\nt\n-test, while that of three groups was analyzed using One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. In all cases, GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA) was used and a\np\n< 0.05 was considered indicative of a statistically significant difference between mean values."

    "Methods": "Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in human brain endothelial cell line-5i (HEBC 5i) were performed to mimic ischemic stroke. Lentivirus vectors encoding Rac1 with GFP and endothelial promotor ENG were injected into the animal\u2019s brain after stroke to overexpress Rac1. After injection, stroke recovery was tested by multiple behavioral tests including novel object recognition, adhesive removal and single pellet reaching tests. Endothelial regeneration in the peri-infarct zone was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). In the vitro model, the effect of Rac1 and Pak1 inhibitors to cell proliferation and migration was examined by CCK-8 and wound healing assays after OGD. The cellular protein level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 were detected by western blots."
