    "Methods": "In this retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, the primary outcome was complete spinal cord decompression on post-operative MRI studies, defined as a continuous column of CSF anterior and posterior to the spinal cord on T2WI or STIR sagittal imaging.\n\nCohort\nFrom January 2001 through December 2016, over a 16-year period, 1927 patients with blunt subaxial cervical TSCI were admitted to a level I trauma center. Of this number, 184 patients were screened, selected, and included in this study. Patients were age 16 years or older, and based on the International Standards for Neurological and Functional Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI)\n29\nwere classified as either AIS grade A or B. Good quality pre- and post-operative CT and MRI studies were available for all patients. The subjects underwent surgery for their injuries and were followed in the intensive or intermediate care unit until discharge to a rehabilitation center or death. Excluded patients included those with AIS grades C and D or non-testable (NT; 832 patients), those with non-operative management of their subaxial cervical spine and spinal cord injuries (509 patients), and those with no or poor imaging studies (197 patients). Also excluded were patients with penetrating (gunshot wound or sharp object) SCI (68 patients;\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFlow diagram indicating the selection criteria for 184 American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grades A and B subaxial cervical spine traumatic spinal cord injury patients who had decompressive surgery following trauma.\nVariables including patient demographics, injury mechanism, and severity (Glasgow Coma Scale Score (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), evidence of shock or hypoxemia) were recorded.\n30\nWe determined American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score and ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) grade at admission and following operative intervention.\n29\n,\n31\nMidsagittal canal diameter and the height of the subaxial cervical spine were measured to control for congenital spinal stenosis.\n32\n,\n33\nThe fracture/dislocation morphology was classified according to the AOSpine subaxial cervical spine injury classification system.\n34\nSurgical management of subaxial cervical spine fracture dislocations was compatible with the scheme used in the randomized prospective trial of Vaccaro and colleagues\n9\nand the management algorithm of Dvorak and colleagues\n27\nWe reviewed post-operative CT and MRI studies in order to determine the surgical technique (i.e., stand-alone anterior cervical discectomy and fusion [ACDF], anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion [ACCF], or laminectomy, or in combination). Using the T2WI or STIR sequences, we measured pre-operative and post-operative intramedullary lesion length (IMLL)\n28\n,\n35\nand determined the state of (obliteration or patency) the subarachnoid space (SAS).\n28\nThe study started following Investigational Review Board approval of the research proposal.\n\nInitial rescue, resuscitation, and imaging studies\nPatients were initially searched and rescued from the scene of the accident\n36\nby emergency medical technicians. Trauma victims were transferred to the Trauma Resuscitation Unit (TRU), back-boarded, and chin-strapped.\n28\n,\n37\n,\n38\nThe median time between injury and arrival to TRU for 183 patients was 1.1\u2009h, and the scene time was unknown for one patient. The mean scene time in 140 patients who were directly transferred to the TRU was 1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009h (median 1.0; range 0.2\u20133.0\u2009h).\n28\nIn 43 patients who were transferred to the TRU from another facility, the time to arrival was 9.1\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u2009h (median 5.0; range 3.5\u201353.5\u2009h). In the TRU, primary and secondary surveys were performed before neurosurgical consultation. Following resuscitation, the patients were sent for CT and MRI of the cervical spine. Pre-operative multi-planar CT of head, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and spine was performed after a mean of 4.1\u2009\u00b1\u20097.0\u2009h (median 2.1; range 0.5\u201357.5\u2009h) from injury. The exact delay from injury to CT studies was unknown in one patient. Multi-planar multi-sequence pre-operative MRI images were acquired a mean of 8.4\u2009\u00b1\u20098.0\u2009h (median 6.0; range 1.7\u201357.5\u2009h) from injury. MRI was acquired either before or after closed cervical traction reduction in some patients.\n28\n,\n39\nPost-operative MRI scans were acquired 48.9\u2009\u00b1\u200930.7\u2009h following injury (median 27\u2009h; range 12\u2013150\u2009h).\n28\n,\n37\nFor one patient, the time interval between injury to pre-operative and post-operative MRI studies was unknown.\n\nNormal anatomy, injury morphology, and instability\nWe controlled for congenital spinal stenosis by calculating the mean mid-sagittal A-P diameter of the subaxial cervical spine at three different segmental levels (\nFig. 2\n), applying the methodology recommended by Furlan and colleagues.\n33\nAdditionally, the height of the subaxial cervical spine was measured from the C2\u2013T1 vertebrae. The AOSpine subaxial cervical spine classification system was used in order to determine injury morphology (\nFig. 3\n).\n34\nIn this system, compression fractures are classified as types A3 or A4, distraction injuries as types B2 or B3, and injuries associated with translation as type C. To determine fracture/dislocation instability we applied the checklists of White and Panjabi\n40\nor Vaccaro and colleagues.\n41\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nMidsagittal plane of CT scan from subaxial cervical spine indicating methodology of measurements of sagittal diameter at three segmental levels and the subaxial cervical spine height from C2-T1.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nMidsagittal subaxial CT and MRI cuts indicating morphology according to AOSpine Subaxial Cervical Spine Classification System.\n34\nC, translation rotation and highly unstable injuries; A4, compression burst fractures; B2, flexion distraction without translation; B3, extension distraction without translation; A0, no imaging evidence of fracture dislocation.\n\nIntramedullary lesion length and verification of spinal cord decompression\nIntramedullary lesion length (IMLL) was measured on pre-operative and post-operative MRI (T2WI or STIR) images (\nFig. 4\n).\n28\n,\n35\n,\n37\n,\n39\nThe mean time from trauma to pre-operative MRI was 8.4\u2009\u00b1\u20098.0\u2009h (median 6.0; range 1.7\u201357.5\u2009h). The mean time from injury to post-operative MRI was 48.9\u2009\u00b1\u200930.7\u2009h (median 37; range 12\u2013150\u2009h).\n28\n,\n39\nFor one patient, the exact time of MRI acquisition following trauma was not recorded. IMLL on pre-operative and post-operative MRI was recorded as the mean of the measured values by four blinded investigators: the principal investigator (B.A.), a trauma neuroradiologist (K.S.), a spine fellowship certified neurosurgeon (K.C.), and a neurotrauma fellowship trained neurosurgeon (G.S.). Decompression was verified by a spine fellowship trained neurosurgeon (C.S.) and a neurotrauma fellowship trained neurosurgeon (G.S.). If there was disagreement between the two raters, the principal investigator (B.A.) served to resolve the discrepancy.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nPre-operative\n(A)\nand post-operative\n(B)\nmidsagittal magnetic resonance images indicating measured intramedullary lesion length a and b.\n\nSurgical intervention and technique\nDecompressive surgery was performed a mean of 21.5\u2009\u00b1\u200920.8\u2009h (median 14; range 4.0\u2013136.8\u2009h) following trauma by one of 14 board -certified neurosurgeons (five were spine-fellowship trained). When appropriate, certain patients underwent attempted closed reduction by cervical traction prior to operative intervention. Whether or not reduction was achieved, all pre-operative candidates had evidence of spinal cord compression as indicated by deformation and effacement of SAS at the injury epicenter, and either rostrally or caudally to it.\n28\nThe objective of surgery was anatomical alignment and internal fixation (anterior, posterior, or a combination of anterior and posterior) of the subaxial cervical spine and decompression of the spinal cord.\n28\nThere was no policy or guidelines for surgical procedures. Each neurosurgeon applied his preferred surgical techniques to obtain decompression and the most secure internal fixation.\n28\n,\n38\nThe five common operative techniques chosen by surgeons were: 1) ACDF (one to three skeletal segments); 2) ACCF (one or two skeletal segments); 3) ACDF in association with laminectomy (one to five levels) with or without posterior spinal fusion; 4) ACCF and laminectomy (one to five levels); and 5) laminectomy (two to five levels) with or without posterior spinal fusion. The surgical techniques used by the 14 neurosurgeons were compatible with the recommended surgical approaches reported previously by Vaccaro and colleagues\n9\nand Dvorak and colleagues\n27\n(\nFig. 5\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 5.\nMidsagittal CT scan of cervical spine indicating\n(A)\nanterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF);\n(B)\nanterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF);\n(C)\nCombined ACDF and three level laminectomy and posterior spinal fusion (PSF);\n(D)\nACCF (two levels) and Laminectomy (two levels) and PSF; and\n(E)\nthree levels of laminectomy and PSF.\n\nSteroid protocol\nFrom 2001 through 2010 we administered methylprednisolone (30\u2009mg/kg in 15\u2009min within the 1st h and 5.4\u2009mg/kg/h for the next 23\u2009h)\n42\nto all patients with TSCI. Infusion started within the first 8\u2009h of trauma. After 2010, this steroid protocol was abandoned at our institution.\n43\n\nCritical care and hospital length of stay\nFollowing surgery, the patients were kept in the intensive or intermediate care units until discharge or death.\n28\n,\n37\n,\n39\nFifteen (8.4%) patients died during their acute care in this trauma center. For the 169 patients who were discharged to a rehabilitation center, the mean hospital length of stay was 24.2\u2009\u00b1\u20098 days (median 19.1; range 3.3\u2013127.5 days). The mean survival for the 15 patients who died was 17.5\u2009\u00b1\u200915.9 days (median 12.3 days; range 3.3\u201359.6 days).\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were calculated. Unpaired\nt\n-tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to assess parametrically and non-parametrically distributed variables, respectively. Univariate logistic regression was performed, followed by multi-variable logistic regression to identify variables independently associated with the outcome of successful decompression. Analysis of variance was performed. Variables for the multi-variate regression analysis were chosen after stepwise selection using Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) to measure the efficiency of the parameterized model in terms of predicting data.\n44\nMultiple effect modification terms were assessed, but no evidence of statistical interaction was detected. A final model was chosen based on the model with the smallest BIC value. Regression diagnostics were performed, consisting of Pearson chi-squared goodness-to-fit testing, tests for collinearity and specification, and examination of Pearson residual plots for influential observations. A\np\nvalue of <0.05 was considered statistically significant, and all tests were two-tailed. All analyses were performed in Stata/SE version 15.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX) and GraphPad Prism version 7.0d (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA)."

    "Methods": "Subjects and surgeries\nAdult, female Sprague-Dawley rats (225\u2013250\u2009g; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were housed 2\u20133 per cage in a controlled environment (12-h light-dark cycles) with food and water\nad libitum\n. All experimental procedures were approved by the Drexel University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Rats were randomly assigned to a na\u00efve control (\nn\n=\u20095) or SCI (\nn\n=\u200944) group. All rats were handled and acclimated before baseline behavioral testing. Rats in the SCI group were subjected to a moderate spinal cord contusion injury at C5. A subset of rats (\nn\n=\u200915) in the SCI group was subjected to an acute exercise paradigm for 4 weeks beginning at 5 days post-injury (dpi). After behavioral testing post-injury, SCI rats (Exercise and Non-Exercise) were further partitioned into two groups based on whether they developed pain (SCI No Pain [SCI NP;\nn\n=\u200912] and SCI Pain [SCI P;\nn\n=\u200911), and SCI Ex No Pain [Ex NP;\nn\n=\u20099) and SCI Ex Pain [Ex P;\nn\n=\u20096]). Groups of naive (\nn\n=\u20095) and SCI (\nn\n=\u20096) rats were sacrificed at 5 dpi to correspond to the time point of initiation of exercise.\nThe SCI was performed according to a clinically relevant and accepted model of SCI-induced neuropathic pain.\n41\nBriefly, rats were anesthetized using a ketamine (60\u2009mg/kg)/xylazine (6\u2009mg/kg)/acepromazine (6\u2009mg/kg) cocktail and a hemilaminectomy was performed over C5, exposing the right dorsal surface of the spinal cord up to and partially over the midline. The spinal column was stabilized in the Infinite Horizons device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Lexington, KY),\n42\nand a custom probe was positioned 2\u2009mm over the right dorsal surface of the C5 spinal cord close to the midline, centered between midline and the lateral edge. The spinal cord and surgical field were submerged in sterile saline, and a contusion was performed with 200-kdyne force, resulting in tissue displacement of 1500\u20131700\u2009\u03bcm consistent across rats (see\nTable 1\nfor details). The incision was sutured in layers. Antibiotic (cefazolin, 160\u2009mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously at the time of surgery to prevent infection. Lactated Ringer's solution (5 cc) was administered subcutaneously on the day of surgery and up to 5 days after surgery to prevent dehydration.\nTable 1.\nSpinal Cord Injury Parameters for All Groups\nGroups\nn\nForce (kDyne)\u00b1SEM\nDisplacement (\u03bcm) \u00b1SEM\nVelocity (mm/s) \u00b1SEM\nNa\u00efve\n5\nNot applicable\nNot applicable\nNot applicable\nSCI 5 days\n6\n224.66\u2009\u00b1\u200913.22\n1711.1\u2009\u00b1\u200922.76\n123.66\u2009\u00b1\u20091.17\nSCI\n23\n239.78\u2009\u00b1\u20099.94\n1643.06\u2009\u00b1\u200941.49\n122.91\u2009\u00b1\u20090.62\nSCI NP\n12\n227.37\u2009\u00b1\u20099.16\n1662.52\u2009\u00b1\u200956.33\n123.37\u2009\u00b1\u20091.13\nSCI P\n11\n219.14\u2009\u00b1\u20099.05\n1619.34\u2009\u00b1\u200972.89\n120.43\u2009\u00b1\u20091.52\nSCI Ex\n15\n234.54\u2009\u00b1\u20095.25\n1598.66\u2009\u00b1\u200940.31\n121.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.63\nEx NP\n9\n235.69\u2009\u00b1\u20095.69\n1612.15\u2009\u00b1\u200942.42\n122.12\u2009\u00b1\u20090.73\nEx P\n6\n227.83\u2009\u00b1\u200913.99\n1562.33\u2009\u00b1\u200996.73\n119.667\u2009\u00b1\u20090.91\nOpen in a separate window\nSCI spinal cord injury; SCI NP, SCI No Pain; SCI P, SCI Pain; SCI Ex, SCI Exercise; Ex NP, Exercise No Pain; Ex P, Exercise Pain; SEM, standard error of mean.\n\nForced exercise paradigm\nRats in the SCI Ex group were subjected to a 4-week forced exercise paradigm beginning at 5\u2009dpi, 5 days a week for 20\u2009min each day, as described previously.\n40\nBriefly, rats were placed in the forced exercise wheel walking system (Lafayette Instruments, Lafayette, IN) modified with a smooth vinyl surface added over rungs of the wheel to prevent slipping and compensate for the loss of function in the ipsilesional forepaw attributed to SCI. Rats were allowed to acclimate to the wheels before injury by being placed in the wheel walking system with the wheels locked in a stationary position. Starting at 5\u2009dpi, rats were placed in the locked wheel walking system for 5\u2009min before initiating exercise. The speed of running the wheels was gradually increased in 1-m/min increments, starting from 7 m/min to a maximum of 14\u2009m/min as the forelimb capabilities of the rats allowed, and time spent at each speed was recorded. All rats walked at maximum speed by 10\u201312\u2009dpi.\n\nBehavioral testing\nRats were assessed for development of pain using von Frey monofilaments exerting varying forces on the rat forepaw with the up-down method.\n43\u201345\nAll rats were acclimated to the apparatus, and behavioral parameters recorded preoperatively as the baseline response, and post-operatively at 28\u2009dpi in a blinded experimental design. Ipsilesional (right) forepaws were tested to assess differences in pain perception attributed to the unilateral nature of our injury model. Operant testing for pain was performed 4 weeks post-SCI using the Mechanical Conflict-Avoidance Paradigm (MCAP; Noldus Technologies, Leesburg, VA).\n\nvon Frey testing\nRats were placed in individual Plexiglas chambers with a wire mesh bottom and allowed to acclimate for 10\u2009min. Each paw was tested only when the weight of the rat was equally distributed on all four paws, or as much as possible post-SCI. Plastic monofilaments of varying bending forces (von Frey monofilaments; Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) were applied to the plantar surface of the forepaw in the up-down method with an interval of 2\u20134\u2009min between applications. A total of 10 von Frey monofilament stimulus applications were collected for each paw for each day of testing, beginning with the 5.18\ng\nforce von Frey hair. Immediate forepaw withdrawal with evidence of supraspinal awareness (licking or looking at the paw, moving away from the stimulus, vocalization, etc.) was considered as a positive response, followed by application of von Frey hair of next lower force value. Absence of forepaw withdrawal was noted as a negative response, and the next higher force von Frey hair was applied. Behavior indicating supraspinal awareness of tactile stimuli (glancing at paw, licking, and vocalization) was recorded. Paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) was determined as the lowest force (\ng\n) that produced a forepaw withdrawal and supraspinal behaviors in at least 50% of the applications at that force. Order of paw testing was randomized to minimize fatigue or an order effect. SCI rats that demonstrated a >50% reduction in PWT at 28\u2009dpi compared to baseline were assigned to pain subgroups.\n40\n,\n46\n,\n47\n\nOperant testing for cognitive perception of pain\nThe mechanical conflict-avoidance paradigm (MCAP) tests the cognitive perception of pain by presenting rats with a choice to remain in an aversive (brightly lit) environment to avoid painful mechanical stimulation, or subject themselves to the noxious stimulation to escape the aversive chamber and reach a preferred dark chamber. The experimental setup consists of a rectangular runway connecting the aversive (light) chamber with the preferred (dark) chamber (\nFig. 1C\n). During 3 days of post-operative training (22\u201324\u2009dpi), rats learned to spontaneously cross the runway to escape the aversive light stimulus. For testing, the runway floor was modified with an array of nociceptive probes (2\u2009mm in height, 0.4\u2009mm in diameter, spaced 10\u2009mm apart), and latency to exit the aversive light chamber as well as time taken to cross the runway of nociceptive probes were recorded in seconds and averaged for each group. Rats that did not exit the lit chamber were assigned an escape latency of 30\u2009sec for that trial, and those that failed to cross the runway in 60\u2009sec were assigned a runway crossing time of 60\u2009sec.\n48\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nAssessment of evoked and ongoing pain behavior after SCI in rats with and without exercise. PWTs were assessed pre-operatively and at 28 days post-injury (dpi) in SCI rats with and without exercise, and proportional paw withdrawal thresholds relative to baseline were calculated. Rats were assigned to the SCI Pain (SCI P) group if their PWTs at 28\u2009dpi were less than 50% of baseline. There were no overall differences between SCI and SCI Ex rats (\nA\n; gray circles indicate rats with PWT <50% baseline). A proportion of rats in the SCI only group as well as in the SCI Ex group developed pain. Analysis based on subgroups showed that SCI P rats had significantly lower proportional PWTs compared to SCI No Pain (\nB\n; SCI NP;\np\n=\u20090.02) and Exercise No Pain (Ex NP;\np\n<\u20090.001). Similarly, Ex Pain rats (Ex P) had significantly lower PWTs compared to SCI NP (\np\n=\u20090.017) and Ex NP (\np\n<\u20090.001). Importantly, SCI P and Ex P, and SCI NP and Ex NP did not differ significantly from one another (B). Cognitive perception of pain behavior was assessed using a mechanical conflict-avoidance paradigm depicted in (\nC\n). Rats were trained to cross a runway to escape a brightly lit aversive chamber and enter a safe, dark chamber. On testing day, the runway was inlaid with nociceptive probes and changes in latency to exit the bright chamber onto the nociceptive runway, as well as time taken to cross the runway into the dark chamber were measured. There was a non-significant tendency for the average latency to exit the brightly lit chamber to be lower in exercised rats than in unexercised rats (\nD\n). Whereas more rats in the SCI group (8 of 23) chose not to exit the chamber and cross the runway in one or more of the three trials compared to SCI Ex rats (2 of 15), there were no differences in crossing time between exercised and unexercised rats (\nE\n). There was no correlation between von Frey thresholds and escape latency in the MCAP (\nF\n;\nr\n=\u20090.06;\np\n>\u20090.05).

Color image is available online.\n\nHistology\nRats were sacrificed at 30\u2009dpi (with a subset at 5\u2009dpi) with an overdose of Euthasol (390\u2009mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital and 50\u2009mg/kg of phenytoin, intraperitoneally) followed by thoracotomy and perfused transcardially with 0.9% ice-cold saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Eight millimeters of cervical spinal cord between C4 and C6 spanning the rostrocaudal extent of the lesion and a 4-mm block containing C7\u2013C8 cord as well as ipsilesional C7 and C8 DRGs were dissected, post-fixed in PFA at 4\u00b0C overnight, then submersed in 30% sucrose for cryoprotection. Spinal cord blocks and DRGs were embedded in OCT compound (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and sectioned at \u221220\u00b0C using a cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Transverse 25-\u03bcm-thick sections 250\u2009\u03bcm apart spanning across C4\u2013C6 cord as well as 10-\u03bcm ipsilesional C7 DRG sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides and 30-\u03bcm C7\u2013C8 cord sections were floated in 0.1\u2009M of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for immunohistochemical processing.\n\nAnalysis of lesion epicenter\nSpinal cord sections (25\u2009\u03bcm thick) 250\u2009\u03bcm apart spanning the extent of the lesion from C4\u2013C6 were stained with cresyl violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for Nissl substance and euriochrome cyanine (Sigma-Aldrich) for myelin. Sections were cover-slipped with DPX (dibutylphthalate polystyrene xylene) mounting medium (Fisher Scientific). To determine the amount of spared tissue, the area of contralesional gray and white matter, spared gray and white matter on the ipsilesional side, and the extent of lesion cavity were measured using the Cavalieri estimator method (Stereo Investigator; MBF Bioscience, Burlington, VT) by an experimenter blinded to experimental groups. Proportion of spared tissue on the ipsilesional side compared to the tissue area on the contralesional side, as well as area of lesion cavity, was measured and compared across animals and groups.\n40\n,\n41\n\nAnalysis of microglia and macrophages\nSpinal cord sections spanning the extent of the lesion from C4\u2013C6 on slides, as well as floating sections of C7\u2013C8, and ipsilesional C7 DRG sections on slides were washed three times with oxidized PBS with Tween 20 (OX-PBST; with thimerosal, T-8784; Sigma-Aldrich). Sections on slides (C4\u2013C6 lesion, C7 R DRG) were treated with Dako Antigen Retrieval Solution (Agilent Pathology Solutions, Santa Clara, CA) at 95\u00b0C in a steamer for 20\u2009min for heat-induced target retrieval. Slides and floating sections were incubated in blocking solution (5% normal serum, 1% fish gelatin [G7765; Sigma-Aldrich], 10% bovine serum albumin [BP1605; Fisher Scientific], 1% Triton X-100 [X-100; Sigma-Aldrich] in OX-PBS) at room temperature for 1\u2009h, then incubated in primary antibodies (ED-1/mouse anti-rat ED-1/CD68 [MCA341R; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA] 1:1500, ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 [Iba-1]-rabbit anti-rat Iba1 [1:6000; 019-19741; Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA] overnight at room temperature. After three rinses in OX-PBST and a two hour incubation in secondary antibodies (biotinylated horse/anti-mouse immunoglobulin G [IgG]; H+L; #BA-2001; 1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), biotin-SP\u2013conjugated goat/anti-rabbit IgG H+L; #111-065-144; 1:200; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) sections were washed with 0.3% H\n2\nO\n2\n, 50% histology grade methanol in OX-PBS at room temperature for 30\u2009min to quench endogenous peroxidases. Antibodies were visualized using the Vectastain Elite ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories) and 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories). DRG sections were counterstained with cresyl violet to visualize nuclear staining. Sections were dehydrated, cleared in Citrisolv (Fisher Scientific), and cover-slipped using DPX (Fisher Scientific).\nED-1 and Iba1 immunoreactivity was quantified using techniques adapted from Popovich and colleagues.\n11\n,\n49\nOptical density thresholds were manually selected using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) for positively labeled tissue for either ED-1 or Iba1 and were quantified as the proportional area (PA) of positively stained tissue within a specific region. PA of ED-1 staining was measured from 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009images of whole cord from three representative sections 250\u2009\u03bcm apart at the lesion epicenter (C4\u2013C6) and C7\u2013C8, and proportional area of Iba1 labeling in C7\u2013C8 cord was measured from 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009images of medial and lateral ipsilesional dorsal horn from three representative sections at C7\u2013C8 (Leica DM5500 B microscope; Leica Microsystems). Values for medical and dorsal horn images for three sections were averaged for each rat, and group averages are represented. For DRGs, ED-1\u2013positive cells with phagocytic amoeboid morphology were identified as macrophages in methyl green counterstained sections and manually counted on 10-\u03bcm-thick sections 50\u2009\u03bcm apart spanning through the entire ipsilesional C7 DRG and aggregated to represent total macrophage count for each DRG.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using SigmaPlot software (version 13; Systat Software, San Jose, CA). Wilks-Shapiro and Brown-Forsythe tests were used to assess normality and equal variance measures for all data before using parametric tests. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and ANOVA on ranks were used to analyze differences between groups for PWTs, latency to exit and crossing time for MCAP, epicenter sparing, lesioned area, number of ED1\n+\ncells in the DRG and proportional area of ED1\n+\nand Iba1\n+\ntissue in the spinal cord, followed by Holm-Sidak (for one-way ANOVA) or Dunn's (for ANOVA on ranks) post-hoc comparisons. Chi-square tests were used to compare number of ED1\n+\ncells in DRG to tactile sensitivity, and Pearson correlations were used to compare proportional area of ED1 and Iba1 staining in the cord to tactile sensitivity. All graphs are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nFifty hTau mice (C57BL/6 Cg-Mapt<tm1(EGFP)Klt>(MAPT), Cat #00549, Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) aged 4\u20138 weeks were purchased as two cohorts of 25 animals each. All mice were allowed to acclimate to 12-h light-dark cycles. Food and water were supplied\nad libitum.\n\nCHIMERA injury and anesthesia\nInjuries were performed using the CHIMERA injury method, which involves a midline closed-head impact followed by rotational acceleration. Each animal was anesthetized with 5% isoflurane for 2.5\u2009min followed by maintenance at 2.5% isoflurane during positioning on the platform. Total isoflurane exposure did not exceed 5\u2009min and delivery was stopped immediately before impact. Sham animals underwent the same anesthesia protocol and head positioning on the CHIMERA device but no impact by the piston.\n\nDetermination of injury thresholds\nBecause animals were exposed to 20 daily impacts, the energy levels for subconcussive and concussive impacts were determined empirically (\nSupplementary Fig. 1A\n; see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). Latency to right reflex (LRR), defined as the time from impact to regaining consciousness and becoming upright, was used as the acute metric of injury. In an initial study, wild-type mice (C57Bl6/J, Jackson Laboratory) were randomly assigned to receive a single impact with piston pressure set to range between 0 and 2.4\u2009psi. Injuries were performed using the same anesthesia and head placement protocol described above, and righting time was recorded and used to determine the subconcussive threshold. Mice injured with piston pressures greater than 1.9\u2009psi (0.13J energy intensity) all had mean righting times greater than the sham average.\nPrevious work using the CHIMERA device has determined that a single impact below 0.5J does not result in phenotypic deficits, including any increases in LRR time.\n28\nHowever, our pilot study with a single impact showed that animals receiving impacts between energy intensities of 0.13J and 0.24J (3.1\u2009psi piston pressure) had increased LRR times (\nSupplementary Fig. 1A\n). Further, because we were interested in the cumulative effect of repeated injuries rather than a single impact, a second study was performed using wild-type mice. These mice were randomly assigned to receive 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009sham, 20\u2009\u00d7\u20090.13J or 20\u2009\u00d7\u20090.24J injuries spaced 24\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009h apart. Righting times were recorded daily. The average righting time over the course of the 20 injuries was then calculated for each group and analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a\npost hoc\nTukey's test (\nSupplementary Fig. 1B\n). There was a significant effect of injury in this study [F(2,31)\u2009=\u200928.99, \u03b7\n2\np\n=\u20090.652,\np\n<\u20090.00001]. Animals in the 0.24J group had increased righting times relative to shams and 20\u2009\u00d7\u20090.13J mice (20\u2009\u00d7\u2009sham vs. 20\u2009\u00d7\u20090.24J,\np\n=\u20090.000126, 20\u2009\u00d7\u20090.13J vs. 0.24J,\np\n=\u20090.000125). Based on these data, we determined a subconcussive energy threshold of 0.13J and a concussive energy threshold of 0.24J.\n\nInjury timeline\nAt 4 months of age, hTau mice were assigned to 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009concussive injury, 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009subconcussive injury, or 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009sham groups using a random number generator. Following impact or sham, each animal was placed supine in a warmed chamber (37\u00b0C) and monitored by an investigator blinded to injury status in a quiet, separate room until fully upright and ambulatory. LRR was recorded by this investigator. For sham animals, LRR was defined as the time from when isoflurane delivery was stopped to regaining consciousness. After regaining consciousness, each animal was returned to its home cage. This procedure was repeated for 20 consecutive days with injuries spaced 24\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009h apart, such that each animal received 20 head impacts or sham procedures (\nFig. 1A\n). A Cox regression for survival analysis was performed to determine the effect of injury on survival post-injury (\nFig. 1B\n), and showed that there was a significant effect of injury status on survival (\np\n=\u20090.0304), with a trend towards more deaths in the 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009concussive injury group.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nInjury timeline and survival post-injury.\n(A)\nFifty male hTau mice were purchased in two separate cohorts. Animals were randomly assigned to sham, 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009subconcussive (0.13J) or 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009concussive (0.24J) injury groups. Following 20 days of injuries, behavioral outcomes including social interaction (SI), elevated plus maze (EPM), open field maze (OFM), Morris water maze (MWM) and tail suspension (TS) were assessed acutely, at 3 months, and 1 year post-injury. Following the 12-month behavioral test session, all animals were perfused.\n(B)\nSurvival and mortality risk were assessed using a Cox survival and hazard regression analysis. The data showed a modest but significant (\np\n=\u20090.03) effect of subconcussive or concussive injury on mortality rate. Color image is available online.\n\nBehavioral testing\nAll neurobehavioral testing was performed in a specified behavior room isolated from external noise and with light and sound controls. We controlled for 60 dB white noise (Marpac Dohm-DS, Wilmington, NC) and lighting (40 lux for Morris water maze, 20 lux for all other tests) for all testing. Neurobehavioral tests were performed during the work day (6\nam\n-6\npm\n). All equipment was cleaned with 70% ethanol prior to each test to remove scents. Animals were allowed to acclimate in the room for at least 1\u2009h before testing. Following injuries, cages were renumbered such that the investigator remained blinded to injury status during the following behavioral testing. Behavioral testing was performed at three time-points: acutely, 3 months and one year following injuries. Acute behavioral testing began 22 days after the first injury (\nFig. 1A\n). Social interaction testing was performed on Days 22\u201324, to provide sufficient testing time for each animal (25\u2009min per animal with 5\u2009min between animals). Acute elevated plus maze testing was performed 25 days after the first injury and acute open field testing was performed 28 days after the first injury. Acute Morris water maze testing began with the first day of the visible platform phase 29 days after the first injury and ending with the probe trial test 38 days after the first injury. Finally, acute tail suspension was performed 40 days after the first injury. Animals were allowed one day of rest between each test to minimize effects of stress induced by each behavioral assay. With the exception of tail suspension, all tests were recorded on video and subsequently analyzed using Panlab SMART (Harvard Bioscience, Holliston, MA).\nSocial interaction and social novelty\nCrawley's three-chamber test was used to measure social interaction and social novelty.\n29\nTest mice were singly housed for 24\u2009h prior to testing. On testing day, the test mouse was placed in a 42\u2009\u00d7\u200970\u2009cm three-chamber box made of opaque white plastic. Following a 5\u2009min habituation session where the mouse was allowed to freely explore all three chambers, the test mouse was then confined to the middle chamber during preparation for the preference for sociability session. A stimulus mouse (male C57BL/6 aged 6\u20138 weeks) was placed in a wire cage in one chamber while a dummy mouse made of black Legos was placed in a wire cage in the opposite chamber. The test mouse was then allowed to explore all three chambers for 10\u2009min. The test mouse was then confined again to the middle chamber prior to preference for social novelty testing. The dummy mouse used during sociability testing was replaced with a novel stimulus mouse (male C57BL/6 age 6\u20138 weeks). The test mouse was then allowed to explore all three chambers for 10\u2009min. Because each testing session required approximately 30\u2009min of test time, stimulus mice were used in pairs and allowed to rest while a second pair of stimulus mice was used for the next test mouse. Time spent interacting with each mouse was measured by tracking the time the mouse spent sniffing within a 1.5\u2009cm radius around each wire cage. Activity such as climbing on top of the wire cage was not counted as interaction.\nElevated plus maze\nA custom maze (30\u2009cm high) with arms that were 30\u2009cm long and 5\u2009cm wide was used for testing. Closed arms were enclosed by 16\u2009cm high walls while open arms had a 2-mm railing to prevent mice from falling. Mice were placed in a closed arm and allowed to explore the maze for 5\u2009min. A 5\u2009cm square was defined as the center zone, requiring the mouse to have all four paws in an arm of the maze to be quantified in SMART as being in that arm. Time spent in all zones (open arms, closed arms, center zone) was quantified using SMART.\nOpen field test\nMice were placed in a 44.5\u2009\u00d7\u200944.5\u2009cm box made of white opaque plastic and allowed to explore for 5\u2009min. Thigmotactic behavior was defined as the average distance away from the wall. Briefly, the time spent moving was measured using Panlab SMART. During video analysis the box was divided into 15 concentric zones spaced 1.5\u2009cm apart. Time spent in each zone was weighted by zone distance from the maze wall and summed to obtain a time-weighted average.\nMorris water maze\nA 120\u2009cm diameter pool was filled with 22\u00b0C water made opaque using non-toxic white tempera paint. For each day except for probe trial, mice were required to swim for four trials per day, and were inserted into four locations in the pool (NW, SW, SE, NE) and allowed to swim for a maximum of 1\u2009min to reach the 11\u2009cm platform. The order of insertion points was changed each day. During the visible platform phase (3 days, Wednesday-Friday), a flag was placed on the platform so that it would be clearly visible. For the hidden platform phase (4 days, Monday-Thursday), opaque white curtains were hung to enclose the pool, with prominent visual cues in each quadrant. The platform was then moved to a different quadrant and the water level was increased so that the platform was hidden under 1\u2009cm of opaque white water. To control for memory retention between test sessions, the hidden platform was placed in a different quadrant for each test session. For hidden and visible platform testing, the average distance swum, average swim speed, and latency to platform were recorded and calculated using Panlab SMART. Twenty-four hours following the final day of hidden platform testing, the platform was removed from the pool. Mice were then subjected to a single probe trial, where each mouse was inserted at the insertion point furthest from where the hidden platform had previously been and allowed to swim for 30\u2009sec. The percentage of time spent in the target quadrant, as well as mean proximity from the platform, were recorded and calculated using Panlab SMART.\nTail suspension\nA white paper cone was placed on each animal's tail to prevent climbing behavior commonly exhibited in C57Bl/6 mice. Mice were then suspended from a rod at a height of 30\u2009cm by their tails. The total test time was 6\u2009min. Time immobile, defined as any time the mouse was not moving except swinging from previous movement, was recorded manually by an investigator blinded to injury status.\n\nCSF, blood, and tissue collection\nFollowing the 1-year time-point of behavioral testing, mice were sacrificed. Animals were randomly assigned a new identification number to assure blinding during histological analysis. Mice were anesthetized with a 75\u2009mg/kg dose of pentobarbital administered IP. When mice remained unresponsive to tail or toe pinch, they were placed on a pad heated to 37\u00b0C, and CSF was extracted from the cisterna magna.\n30\nMice were then transcardially perfused using ice cold 0.3% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-heparin solution and approximately 800\u2009\u03bcL of blood was collected using the cardiac bleeding method. Following tissue extraction, the brain was separated into two hemispheres. The left hemisphere was drop fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and then switched to 30% sucrose solution, stored at 4\u00b0C. The right hemisphere was dissected on a chilled aluminum foil plate into cortical and hippocampal regions and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Blood samples were allowed to clot for a minimum of 1\u2009h, and then blood and CSF were centrifuged at 2000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g to extract serum samples, which were stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Results from CSF, blood and frozen brain tissue analyses will be reported separately.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nFixed brain tissue was sectioned coronally into 50-\u03bcm thick sections using a freezing sliding microtome (Microm HM 430, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in a 1:6 series and stored in cryoprotectant (sucrose dissolved in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and ethylene glycol) at 4\u00b0C. Total human tau was detected using monoclonal HT7 (Cat# MN1000, ThermoFisher Scientific). Primary antibodies used to detect phosphorylated tau included monoclonal AT8 (Cat# MN1020, ThermoFisher Scientific), CP13 (courtesy of Peter Davies, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, NY) and RZ3 (courtesy of Peter Davies). Astrocytes and activated microglia were detected with polyclonal GFAP (Cat# AB5541, Millipore Sigma, St Louis, MO) and polyclonal Iba1 (Cat# 019-19741, Wako Chemicals USA Inc., Richmond, VA) respectively. APP immunoreactivity was detected using polyclonal \u03b2APP (Cat# 51-2700 Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA). For tau staining, antigen retrieval was performed using a 5-min incubation in 70% formic acid. Sections were then incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide solution to block endogenous peroxidase and then blocked for 30\u2009min in 3% serum diluted in TBS-X. Normal goat serum (Cat# S-1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used for tau, Iba1 and APP staining, while normal donkey serum (Cat# 017-000-121, Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) was used for GFAP staining. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in primary antibody diluted 1:1000 in 3% serum. Tissue from an uninjured 22-month-old 3xTG mouse was used as a positive control for tau pathology, while tissue from a mouse injured using the controlled cortical impact injury model was used as a positive control for GFAP, Iba1 and APP staining.\n31\n,\n32\nNegative controls with the primary antibody excluded were performed for all stains. The next day, sections were incubated in secondary antibody diluted 1:1000 in TBS-X for 1\u2009h. For tau staining, biotinylated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Cat# BA-9200, Vector Laboratories) was used while biotinylated donkey anti-chicken secondary antibody (Cat# 703-065-115, Jackson Immunoresearch) was used for GFAP staining. Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Cat# BA-1000, Vector Laboratories) was used for Iba1 and APP staining Sections were incubated for one 1\u2009h in ABC solution (Cat# PK-6100, Vector Laboratories) diluted 1:400\u2009A and B in 1xTBS, followed by visualization using 3\u20323\u2032 diaminobenzidine (Cat# D5905-100TAB, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Sections were washed three times in 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009TBS between each step.\n\nMyelin Black Gold II staining\nTissue sections were first washed in TBS to remove residual cryoprotectant. Black Gold II solution was prepared by resuspending 150\u2009mg dry Black Gold II powder (Cat# AG400, Millipore Sigma) in 0.9% saline solution. The Black Gold II solution was then heated to 60\u00b0C. Free-floating tissue sections were incubated in the solution for 8\u201312\u2009min until fibers were completely stained (\nSupplementary Fig. 2\n; see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). Following two washes in Milli-Q water, sections were incubated in 0.1% sodium thiosulfate solution heated to 60\u00b0C for 3\u2009min. The tissue sections were then washed three times in TBS to remove trace sodium thiosulfate.\n\nQuantification of histology\nFollowing staining, tissue sections were mounted onto positively charged slides, dehydrated in a series of graded ethanols (50%-70%-95%-100%-100%), and cleared in three changes of xylenes before being cover-slipped (No. 1.5, Cat # 48393-241; VWR). Images of stained sections were acquired on a Zeiss Axioscan (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) using a brightfield 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009objective lens and then exported at their original resolution into tiff format for quantification. Regions of interest (ROIs) in the gray matter included cortical gray matter (4\u20135 sections/animal), lateral septal nucleus (1 section/animal), and the hippocampus (3\u20134 sections/animal). White matter intact (> 50% of region without folds or tears) ROIs included the corpus callosum (4\u20135 sections/animal) anterior commissure (one section/animal), hippocampal commissure (1 section/animal) and fimbria (2 sections/animal).\nTo quantify GFAP staining, the Renyi entropy thresholding method was applied to all images (\nSupplementary Fig. 3\n; see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). The Sauvola local thresholding method (radius of 15) was used to quantify microglial cell bodies stained using Iba1. Similar to Myelin Black Gold II analysis, ROIs were included and considered intact only if >50% of the region was without folds or tears. To exclude remaining edge and fold artifacts, only particles with an area of 10\u2013500 pixels were included in analysis.\nBecause there were no signs of severe demyelination in any of the tissue sections, we used power coherence as a measure of white matter integrity as previously described.\n33\nBriefly, each ROI was subdivided into square regions with an area of 10 pixels\n2\n. This area was used to sustain sufficient spatial resolution and prevent artifacts caused by multiple crossing fibers, while also removing noise related artifacts. A two-tensor model was then fit to the power spectrum of each subdivided region. Power coherence, a metric ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated by subtracting the ratio of the major and minor axes of the tensors from one.\n\nPCR confirmation of genotype\nPCR was used to confirm the hTau genotype from one animal selected at random from each cohort of hTau mice. DNA from the leftover regions of the fresh-frozen brain tissue was extracted using the EZ High MW Mouse Tail DNA Isolation Kit (Cat# M1007-100, EZ Bioresearch, St. Louis, MO). Nuclei lysis and Proteinase K solution were added to the tissue sample and incubated overnight at 55\u00b0C with gentle shaking until the tissue was completely digested. The next day, protein precipitation solution was added to the mixture. Following a 5-min incubation on ice, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 3\u2009min at room temperature, separating the protein pellet from supernatant. Isopropanol was added to the supernatant and inverted until DNA was visible as threads. The supernatant and isopropanol solution was then centrifuged 16,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 1\u2009min at room temperature. The supernatant was then removed from the microcentrifuge tube and the remaining DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol. The DNA pellet was centrifuged and washed again with 70% ethanol. Any residual supernatant was then removed and the DNA pellet was allowed to air dry for 10\u2009min. DNA Hydration Solution was added to the pellet and incubated at 65\u00b0C for 1\u2009h with gentle shaking. The extracted DNA was then stored at 4\u00b0C until PCR genotyping. Tail DNA from an hTau mouse was obtained from an independent investigator to use as an external positive control.\nControl (hTau ctrl R : 5\u2032- GTA GGT GGA AAT TCT AGC ATC ATC C -3\u2032, hTau ctrl F : 5\u2032- CTA GGC CAC AGA ATT GAA AGA TCT -3\u2032) and hTau specific oligonucleotides (hTau R : 5\u2032- CTC TGC ATG GCT GTC CAC TAA CCT T -3\u2032, hTau F : 5\u2032- ACT TTG AAC CAG GAT GGC TGA GCC C -3\u2032) were resuspended to 100\u2009\u03bcM concentration in molecular grade water. The extracted DNA was thawed on ice and diluted to a final concentration of 100\u2009ng/\u03bcL. A solution of DNA, control or hTau oligonucleotides (0.2\u2009\u03bcM), GoTaq Flex (Promega, Madison, WI), deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, reaction buffer, and enhancer was then prepared in molecular grade water and heated using a thermocycler. Thermocycler conditions were 94\u00b0C for 30\u2009sec, 58\u00b0C for 1\u2009min, and 72\u00b0C for 1\u2009min for 35 cycles each, with a final extension phase of 72\u00b0C for 2\u2009min. PCR was visualized on a 1% agarose gel.\n\nWestern blotting\nWestern blotting for total human tau and phosphorylated tau was performed as previously described.\n17\n,\n34\nBriefly, frozen hippocampi from 5\u20136 randomly selected animals from each injury group were homogenized in RIPA buffer with added protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Hippocampal tissue from an uninjured 22-month-old 3xTG animal was used as a positive control for total and phosphorylated tau. Homogenates were centrifuged (13,000\u2009rpm, 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C) and protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay methods in order to obtain equal amounts of protein sample. Samples were then heated with mercapto-ethanol. Dot blot analysis was performed by pipetting 100\u2009\u03bcg of protein onto 0.2\u2009\u03bcm nitrocellulose membranes which were then allowed to dry completely. In parallel, 20\u2009\u03bcg of protein with loading buffer was loaded per well and then electrophoresed on 10% BisTris NUPAGE gels (Cat#NP0301, ThermoFisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA), followed by transfer to 0.2\u2009\u03bcm nitrocellulose membranes. These membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS with Tween (PBS-T) for 1\u2009h, followed by incubation in primary antibody (HT7, total human tau or AT8, ptau) diluted 1:1000 in 5% milk in TBS-T overnight at 4\u00b0C. Antibodies were detected using sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare, Cat#NXA931, Buckinghamshire, UK; 1:10,000 dilution in 5% milk and PBS-T solution) and ECL Western blotting kit (GE Healthcare, Cat#RPN2235, Buckinghamshire, UK). Membranes were then stripped and reprobed for tubulin (1:1000 dilution).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll analysis was performed using Statistica (Tibco Software Inc., Palo Alto, CA). All data was tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Any datasets that violated the assumption of normality were transformed so that parametric analyses could be performed (\nSupplementary Table 2\n; see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). A two-way, repeated measures ANOVA was performed for each neurobehavioral metric to test for the effects of injury and cohort, with test session (acute, 3-month, one1data and histological data. We pre-specified the statistical plan to collapse across the two cohorts of mice for analyses for which there were no significant main effects or cohort of interactions with of other factors with cohort. Statistical power calculations for main effects of injury was 80% at\np\n<\u20090.05 with an effect size of 0.50. Animals that died before the end of the experiment were excluded from behavioral and histological analysis.\nPost hoc\nTukey's tests were then used to determine significance for specific pairwise comparisons (\np\n<\u20090.05). Because the residuals were not normally distributed, all correlational analyses were performed using Spearman's rank correlations, followed by Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The relationship between power coherence and microgliosis in white matter tracts was assessed using Spearman's correlations, followed by Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. When determining the relationship between white matter power coherence and Morris water maze measures (four ROIs\u2009\u00d7\u2009five behavioral measures\u2009=\u200920 correlations), the effective number of tests was adjusted to account for potential correlation between measures.\n35\nWithout this adjustment, the Bonferroni correction at\np\n<\u20090.05/20\u2009=\u20090.0025; however, with the variance of the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix (v\u03bbobs\u2009=\u20091.265), the adjusted Bonferroni at\np\n<\u20090.05/18.79\u2009=\u20090.0027.\nCorrelations between microgliosis in both gray and white matter with Morris water maze measures (seven ROIs\u2009\u00d7\u2009five behavioral measures\u2009=\u200935 correlations) were similarly adjusted. After adjustment using the variance of the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix (v\u03bbobs\u2009=\u20091.041), the adjusted Bonferroni at\np\n<\u20090.05/33.99\u2009=\u20090.0015. Effect sizes were calculated for each test that was performed (\nSupplementary Table 3\n; see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). Graphs were plotted using Prism v7.0 (Graph Pad, La Jolla, CA). All error bars represent standard error of mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nHypocretin knockout mice on a C57BL/6 background (HCRT KO) were kindly provided by Dr. John Peever (University of Toronto; Toronto, Ontario), and adult male C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were group housed until surgery (\u223c3\u20134 months old at time of use), after which they were single housed. Mice were maintained on a 12:12 light:dark cycle at 29\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0 C with food and water provided\nad libitum.\nAll procedures involving the use of animals were approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal Welfare Act and the National Institutes of Health policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nEEG recording and determination of sleep\u2013wake behavior\nSleep\u2013wake behavior of mice was determined based on the electroencephalogram and cage activity patterns. EEG signals were amplified, filtered, and recorded for offline processing using custom software written in LabView for Windows (ICELUS, M. Opp, University of Washington, Seattle, WA; National Instruments, Austin, TX) as previously described.\n52\n,\n53\nEEG and cage activity records were visually scored in 10-sec epochs. Artifact-free EEG signals were subjected to fast Fourier transformation, yielding power spectra between 0.5 and 40\u2009Hz in 0.5-Hz frequency bins. Arousal states were determined as previously described and classified as NREM sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, or wakefulness (WAKE) based upon published criteria.\n52\u201354\n\nExperimental design\nA schematic representation of the protocols used in this study is presented in\nFigure 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic representation of the protocols used in the present study. C57BL/6J and hypocretin knockout (HCRT KO) mice were implanted with electroencephalography (EEG) recording electrodes and allowed to recover. Forty-eight hours baseline EEG recordings were obtained from undisturbed mice, after which two mice were dropped from the study due to poor EEG signals. Mice of each genotype were randomized into either control (sham surgeries) or experimental (moderate traumatic brain injury [TBI] surgeries) groups. Moderate TBI was induced using controlled cortical impact with a piston depth of 1.0\u2009mm. Forty-eight\u2013hour recordings were obtained from all mice at 3, 7, 15, and 30 days post-surgery. After the last recording period (32 days post-surgery), animals were perfused and brains were removed for immunohistochemistry.\nExperiment 1: Effects of TBI on sleep\u2013wake behavior of hypocretin KO mice\nC57BL/6J mice (\nn\n=\u200918) and HCRT KO mice (\nn\n=\u200917) were surgically implanted with EEG recording electrodes under isoflurane anesthesia. These electrodes were implanted in the skull but did not penetrate the dura matter. We\n37\nand others\n38\n,\n42\nhave previously used this method to assess sleep\u2013wake behavior following TBI. The leads from the screw electrodes were soldered to pins of a plastic connector (Digi-Key; ED85100-ND) to allow coupling to the recording system. Dental acrylic (Integrity Caulk; Dentsply) covered the electrodes and formed a headpiece to which the flexible recording tether could be connected. The section of the skull over the left parietal cortex was not covered with dental acrylic at this time. The incision was closed with sutures, and a subcutaneous injection of an analgesic (0.5\u2009mg/kg buprenorphine) was given at the end of the surgery. Mice were allowed 7 days to recover before they were attached to a flexible tether for habituation to the recording system. After 3 days of habituation to the tether and recording environment, 48-h undisturbed baseline recordings were obtained.\nAfter the 48-h baseline recordings, two mice were dropped from the study due to poor quality of the EEG signals. Remaining mice were then randomized into four groups: C57BL/6J sham (\nn\n=\u20098), C57BL/6J TBI (\nn\n=\u20099), HCRT KO sham (\nn\n=\u20098), and HCRT KO TBI (\nn\n=\u20098). TBI was induced using controlled cortical impact (CCI), as previously described.\n37\n,\n55\nWe previously demonstrated that 1\u2009mm depth CCI produces moderate TBI and significant changes in sleep\u2013wake behavior,\n37\nand we used the same parameters in this study. All mice (sham, TBI) received a craniotomy over the left parietal cortex using a 5\u2009mm trephine, approximately \u22122\u2009mm relative to bregma and 2.5\u2009mm lateral to the midline. The skull fragment was removed without disrupting the underlying dura, and TBI was induced in the experimental group using the Leica Impact One system (Richmond, IL) equipped with an electrically-driven 3-mm diameter metal piston controlled by a linear velocity displacement transducer. CCI parameters were: 5.0\u2009m/sec impact velocity; 100\u2009msec dwell time; and impact depth of 1.0\u2009mm (moderate TBI). Sham (control) animals received identical anesthesia and craniotomy without the CCI injury. After the CCI, a sterilized polystyrene disc created from a weighing boat was placed over the craniotomy and covered with dental acrylic. We\n37\n,\n55\nand others\n56\nhave used this or a similar technique to protect the brain after craniotomy. After the incision was closed with sutures, mice received a subcutaneous injection of analgesic (0.5\u2009mg/kg buprenorphine) and were returned to their home cages. Animals were closely monitored after surgery and none displayed overt signs of infection.\nAdditional 48-h recordings were obtained from all mice on post-craniotomy/TBI Days 3\u20134, 7\u20138, 14\u201315, and 30\u201331. Sleep\u2013wake behavior was determined and the EEG subjected to fast Fourier transformation to produce power spectra between 0.5 and 40\u2009Hz in 0.5\u2009Hz bins as described previously.\n52\nPower in the delta frequency band (0.5\u20134.5\u2009Hz) during NREM sleep was analyzed in a subset of mice (\nn\n=\u20095\u20136 mice per group). NREM delta power was normalized to the total state-specific power (NREM sleep), summed across all frequency bins from 0.5 to 40\u2009Hz for the light and dark periods and expressed as a percent of total power.\n53\nExperiment 2: Effects of TBI on numbers of hypocretin neurons\nAfter the Day 30\u201331 post-craniotomy/TBI recording, mice were perfused and brains removed for immunohistochemical assessment of TBI effects on hypocretin neurons. Brains were sectioned on a Leica cryostat at 14\u2009\u03bcm and mounted on Superfrost Plus slides. Briefly, slides were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times for 5\u2009min each, then blocked for 30\u2009min with a 1:20 dilution of normal donkey serum in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin. Slides were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in rabbit anti-mouse orexin-A (H-003-30; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; 1:1,000 dilution). Slides were then rinsed with PBS six times for 5\u2009min each. Slides were then incubated for 30\u2009min in the secondary antibody solution (Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit; Jackson ImmunoResearch; 711-545-152; 1:400 dilution). Slides were rinsed with PBS six more times for 5\u2009min each and then cover-slipped.\n\nEstimating cell numbers\nCell numbers were estimated using quantitative methods for unbiased stereology.\n57\nBriefly, positively stained cells were visualized on an Olympus BX-51 fluorescent stereoscope using Stereo Investigator 10 (MBF Biosciences, Williston, VT). Hypocretin cell number estimates were obtained from seven sections in a 1:9 series spanning approximately \u22121.20\u2009mm to \u22122.10\u2009mm from bregma. The contour for the perifornical-lateral hypothalamic region was outlined using a 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009objective. Cells were then counted using the 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009objective and optical fractionator, with a counting frame of 50\u2009\u00d7\u200950 microns and a grid size of 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009100 microns. All cell counts were obtained from the hemisphere ipsilateral to injury. TBI-induced changes in cellular and tissue outcomes (cell death, inflammatory cytokine expression, presence of immune cells, etc.) are typically most severe on the side ipsilateral to injury\n58\n,\n59\nand previous studies using unilateral CCI have examined hypocretin neuron number and function in the hypothalamus ipsilateral to injury.\n34\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo determine the impact of TBI and genotype on sleep\u2013wake behavior, percent time spent in wake, NREM sleep, or REM sleep during the light or dark periods was analyzed using a two-way variance of analysis (ANOVA; with injury condition and genotypes as the two factors) with repeated measures. If there were statistically significant differences observed in the full model, sleep\u2013wake behavior was further examined using a one-way ANOVA within time block to determine differences between the four groups (C57BL/J sham, C57BL/6 TBI, HCRT KO sham, and HCRT KO TBI). If significant differences were detected,\npost hoc\ncomparisons were made using Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) to determine which groups contributed to statistical differences.\nWe also determined the effect of injury and genotype on the temporal distribution of sleep\u2013wake behavior over the course of 24-h recording periods. The percent time spent in wake, NREM sleep, and REM sleep were determined for each recording hour and then grouped into 4-h time blocks. For each 4-h time block, values were evaluated using a two-way ANOVA (with injury condition and genotype as the two factors) with repeated measures (i.e. across baseline, 3 days post-surgery, etc.). If there were statistically significant differences observed in the full model, a further examination was made using a one-way ANOVA within each 4-h time block to determine differences between the four groups (C57BL/J sham, C57BL/6 TBI, HCRT KO sham, and HCRT KO TBI). If significant differences were detected,\npost hoc\ncomparisons were made using Tukey's HSD to determine differences between/among groups.\nTo assess the effects of injury and genotype on sleep architecture, bouts of wakefulness were sorted by length into 1\u2009min bins up to 10-min. Wake bout lengths of 10- 20\u2009min, and wake bout lengths greater than 20\u2009min, were grouped into two separate bins. Light and dark period wake bouts were assessed separately. For each bout length bin, significance was assessed using a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures. If there were statistically significant differences observed in the full model, a further examination was made using a one-way ANOVA within each bout length bin to determine differences between the four groups (C57BL/J sham, C57BL/6 TBI, HCRT KO sham, and HCRT KO TBI). If significant differences were detected,\npost hoc\ncomparisons were made using Tukey's HSD.\nTo assess effects of injury and genotype on delta power, normalized NREM delta power was calculated for each hour across the 24-h period. Since animals do not enter NREM sleep every hour, NREM delta power could not be calculated for every hour. Further, each animal did not have the same number of hours in NREM at each time-point. Since a repeated measures ANOVA requires the same number of values at each time-point, the full model could not be statistically analyzed. Statistical analyses using one-way ANOVA (between the four groups) were then conducted separately for 12\u2009h of the light and dark periods for baseline and each post-surgical time-point. If significant differences were revealed within time-point,\npost hoc\ncomparisons were made using Tukey's HSD to determine which conditions contributed to these effects.\nBecause HCRT KO mice lack hypocretin, the effect of TBI on numbers of hypocretin neurons was assessed only in C57BL/6J mice. Estimated numbers of hypocretin neurons in mice subjected to sham and TBI were compared using a non-paired Student's\nt\ntest.\nAll analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM), unless otherwise indicated. An alpha value of\np\n<\u20090.05 was accepted as indicating a significant difference between or among groups."

    "Methods": "Materials\nPowdered GTE was provided by Unilever BestFoods (Englewood, NJ). Its composition was verified by ultraviolet high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) to contain 30% (w/w) total catechins (48% EGCG, 31% EGC, 13% ECG, 8% EC) and 4.6% caffeine.\n30\n\nDiet treatment\nAll procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The Ohio State University. Female Sprague Dawley rats (250\u2009g; Harlan Laboratory) were randomized to the following dietary treatments (\nn\n=\u200918/group): purified control diet devoid of GTE (D11112201) or containing GTE at 2% (w/w) (D15022601). The pelleted diet contained 65% energy from carbohydrate, 20% energy from protein, and 15% energy from fat. GTE was provided at 2% (w/w) based on our prior studies demonstrating that this dietary level protects against liver injury associated with NAFLD in rodents.\n30\n,\n32\u201334\nGTE at 2% also closely approximates intake from epidemiological studies suggesting that green tea (\u2265 10 servings/day) lowers the risk of liver injury and inflammation.\n44\nRodents were provided ad libitum access to food and water for the duration of this investigation. Although time-dependent studies have yet to assess green tea catechin accumulation in target tissues, long-term feeding of tea catechins for >9 weeks suppresses high-fat diet\u2013induced obesity by modulating lipid metabolism.\n47\nTherefore, to avoid profound effects on weight loss between diet groups that may confound the interpretation of SCI-induced changes in metabolic endpoints, rats were fed 2% GTE diet for just 3 weeks before injury. Experimental diets were weighed and replenished, and rat body weights were recorded every 2\u20133 days.\n\nSCI\nThree weeks after beginning the control or GTE diets, rats were randomized to the following groups: Uninjured +0% GTE (\nn\n=\u20096), Uninjured +2% GTE (\nn\n=\u20096), SCI +0% GTE (\nn\n=\u200912) and SCI +2% GTE (\nn\n=\u200912). Animals in the SCI groups were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal cocktail of ketamine (80\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg) after which a dorsal laminectomy was performed at vertebral level T8. The Infinite Horizons device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation) was used to deliver a moderate (200\u2009kD) spinal contusion, after which back muscles were sutured, and the skin was closed with wound clips. Rats were injected with 5\u2009mL of saline subcutaneously, and then were placed in warm cages overnight. To maintain hydration and prevent infection, saline and antibiotics were administered subcutaneously for 5 days post-injury (DPI). Bladders were expressed manually twice daily until spontaneous voiding returned.\n\nHindlimb locomotor assessment\nAll animals were acclimated to handling and testing in the open field environment prior to injury. Rats were tested by two observers blinded to the treatment groups prior to injury and at days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 post-injury using the Basso\u2013Beattie\u2013Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale.\n48\nScores for each rat's hindlimbs were averaged and used to create group means at each day.\n\nTissue extraction and preparation\nAll rats were euthanized 9 weeks after beginning the GTE enriched diets, which was 42 DPI for the SCI groups. All rats were fasted for 8\u2009h before euthanasia. Cardiac blood samples were collected then centrifuged for 5\u2009min at 300\ng\nto separate the serum, which was flash frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. Rats were exsanguinated using 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Once the blood was cleared from the body, small cross-sections of liver from the central lobe (\u223c0.5\u2009g each) were preserved in RNAlater (ThermoFisher Scientific) for gene expression studies. The rats were then transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1\u2009M PBS. Livers and spinal cords were removed, post-fixed in 4% PFA for 2\u2009h, and then transferred to 0.2\u2009M PB overnight. Samples were then cryoprotected for 2\u20133 days in 30% sucrose solution. Fixed liver and spinal cord samples were frozen on dry ice and blocked using optimal cutting temperature (OCT) solution. Frozen spinal cord and liver tissues were sectioned at 10 and 20\u2009\u03bcm, respectively, then mounted on slides (Superfrost Plus Slides, Fisher Scientific).\n\nSerum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and glucose analysis\nSerum ALT activity, glucose (Point Scientific), and NEFA (Wako Diagnostics) were measured using spectrophotometric clinical assays in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions as previously described.\n32\n\nLiver histology\nImmunohistochemistry was performed on liver tissue as previously described.\n10\nBriefly, anti-CD11b (Ox42; Serotec, MCA275, 1:2,000) and anti-Clec4f (ThermoFisher Scientific, PA5-47396, 1:400) were used to visualize liver macrophages. Liver iron was visualized using Perls Prussian blue reagent, and liver H-ferritin (Santa Cruz, sc-376594, 1:1,000) and L-ferritin (Santa Cruz, sc-74513 1:1,000) were visualized as previously described.\n49\n,\n50\nOil Red O staining was used to assess the deposition and accumulation of lipid molecules in hepatic tissue as previously described.\n10\n\nSpinal cord histology\nSpinal cord sections spanning the rostral to caudal extent of the lesion were used for immunohistochemistry as previously described.\n51\nBriefly, axons and white matter were visualized with anti-neurofilament (NF) antibody (DSHB, RT97, 1:2000) and eriochrome cyanine (EC), respectively. Anti-CD11b (Ox42; Serotec, MCA275, 1:2000) and anti-CD68 antibodies (Serotec, MCA341GA, 1:1000) were used to visualize macrophages/microglia. Iron was visualized using Perls Prussian blue reagent as previously described.\n49\n,\n50\nNeurons were visualized with anti-NeuN antibody (EMD-Millipore, MAB377, 1: 25,000).\n\nTissue analysis and quantification\nAn investigator blinded to experimental treatments quantified histological outcomes with MCID imaging software (Imaging Research Inc.). Sections of liver tissue were randomly selected from each group. The proportional area of Clec4f, CD11b, L-ferritin, and H-ferritin immunoreactivity and Oil Red O stain was quantified from six random fields per section by dividing the stained \u201ctarget\u201d area by the total hepatocyte area measured in each field. Staining levels are expressed as % of total hepatocyte area. For spinal cords, the injury epicenter was identified as the section with the least white matter (EC/NF labeling); analyses of spared white matter and volume at the lesion epicenter and in 10 sections spaced 200\u2009\u03bcm apart for a total of 2\u2009mm analyzed rostral and caudal to the epicenter were completed using MCID software and the Cavalieri estimation.\n52\nThe total immunoreactivities for CD11b+ and CD68+ macrophages/microglia and Perls Prussian blue+ iron label were quantified at the lesion epicenter and in 10 sections spaced 200\u2009\u03bcm apart for a total of 2\u2009mm analyzed rostral and caudal to the epicenter.\n\nAnalysis of gene expression\nGene expression was examined in fresh liver and spinal samples as previously described.\n10\nBriefly, total RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent (15596018, Life Technologies), and purity was assessed using microdrop spectrophotometry. cDNA was synthesized using a Superscript III reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using Sybr green on an Applied Biosystems quantitative PCR (qPCR) instrument. All primers for inflammatory genes (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [TNF\u03b1], CD68, CD11b, interleukin-1\u03b1 [IL-1\u03b1], and interleukin-1\u03b2 [IL-1]) and iron storage genes (L-ferritin, H-ferritin) were purchased from Quantitect (\nTable 1\n). mRNA expression was normalized relative to 18S, and quantification was performed using the \u0394\u0394 cycle threshold (CT) method.\n53\nTable 1.\nPrimers for Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction-Based Quantification of Hepatic Gene Expression in Rats\nName\nForward sequence\nReverse sequence\nTNF-\u03b1\nTCGTAGCAAACCACCAAGCG\nATGGCAGAGAGGAGGCTGACTTTC\nIL-1\u03b1\nTCACTCGCATGGCATGTGCTGA\nTCGGGCTGGTTCCACTAGGCT\nIL-1\u03b2\nGAAGATGGAAAAGCGGTTTG\nAACTATGTCCCGACCATTGC\nCXCL1\nCAGACAGTGGCAGGGATTCA\nTGACTTCGGTTTGGGTGCAG\nCCL2\nAGCCAACTCTCACTGAAGCC\nAACTGTGAACAACAGGCCCA\nCD68\nGGATTCAAACAGGACCGACATCAG\nCTACAGAGTGGACTGGAGCAAATGC\nCD11b\nGAGAACTGGTTCTGGCTTGC\nTCAGTTCGAGCCTTCTT\nL-ferritin\nCGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC\nGGACACACTTTAACAATAGGCGAG\nH-ferritin\nGCCACTGACAAAAATGACCCC\nTGGCGGCGACTAAGGAGAGGGCG\n18S\nTTCGGAACTGAGGCCATGAT\nTTTCGCTCTGGTCCGTCTTG\nOpen in a separate window\nTNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; CXCL1, chemokines C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData (means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM) were analyzed using Graph Pad Prism 7.0c software.

    "Methods": "Human tissues\nAll cases were patients at the R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, Baltimore; the cases reported here are distinct from the cohort from Barcelona reported earlier.\n13\n,\n28\nThe tissue collection protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Under this IRB protocol, brain tissue biopsy specimens were obtained from 16 patients with non-ballistic, closed head injury, contusion-TBI who underwent decompressive craniectomy (by BA or JMS) for elevated intracranial pressure\n29\nbetween January 12, 2013, and August 3, 2014. All had CT scans exhibiting hemorrhagic contusions with mass effect. Patients were (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation) 48\u2009\u00b1\u200920 years of age, and 81% were male. The mechanism of injury was motor vehicle accident, pedestrian struck, or assault. Time to surgery was 58\u2009\u00b1\u200985\u2009h (range, 2\u2013280) after TBI.\nIn each case, one or two biopsy specimens, 0.5\u20131\u2009cm\n3\n, were obtained from what appeared grossly to be non-necrotic brain at the interface between contused brain and normal-appearing brain. Following biopsy, specimens were placed immediately in 4% formaldehyde for immersion fixation. Tissues were cryoprotected with 30% sucrose, embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound, frozen on dry ice, and cryosectioned (10\u2009\u03bcm).\nFor control tissues, five postmortem specimens were obtained from three men and two women who died rapidly from non-neurological diseases, including pneumonia, status asthmaticus, and rupture of aortic aneurysm.\n30\nThe postmortem interval ranged from 18\u201374\u2009h. The average age of control subjects was 51.3\u2009\u00b1\u20097.0 years.\n\nAntibody validation\nThe custom anti-SUR1 and anti-TRPM4 antibodies used for immunolabeling and immunoFRET in this study were validated previously using lysates from appropriate SUR1 and TRPM4 expression systems, tissues from wild-type,\nTrpm4\u2013/\u2013\nand\nAbcc8\u2013/\u2013\nmice, and using mass spectrometry of immunoisolated proteins,\n26\nin accordance with recommendations for antibody validation by Uhlen and colleagues.\n31\nHere, we further validated the specificity of the custom anti-SUR1 antibody for immunohistochemistry of human tissues by comparing immunolabeling of adjacent sections using our custom polyclonal antibody, a monoclonal antibody (S289-16; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) and a commercial polyclonal antibody (sc-5789; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX).\nWe evaluated the suitability of three commercial anti-KIR6.2 antibodies using myc-tagged KIR6.x (myc-KIR6.2 or myc-KIR6.1) plasmids expressed in COS-7 cells. Myc-KIR6.2 and myc-KIR6.1 plasmids were constructed as follows. Complementary DNA clones encoding mouse\nKcnj11\n(KIR6.2) and\nKcnj8\n(KIR6.1) were obtained from Dr. Shyng (Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR) and DNASU Plasmid Repository (Tempe, AZ), respectively, and used as templates for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplified PCR products were cloned into pCMV-Tag3C vector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) for expression of myc-KIR6.x. The myc-KIR6.x plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing prior to transfection.\nWhole\u2013cell lysates and myc-KIR6.2 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted using anti-myc antibody (sc-40; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or one of three anti-KIR6.2 antibodies: 1) GTX80493, an anti-human (N-terminus of KIR6.2), rabbit polyclonal antibody from GeneTex (Irvine, CA); 2) sc-11226, an anti-human (N-terminus of KIR6.2) goat polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; or 3) sc-11228, an anti-human (internal region of KIR6.2) goat polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.\nAnti-myc immunoblot of whole\u2013cell lysates and of myc-KIR6.2 immunoprecipitate from cells transfected with empty vector yielded no bands (\nFig. 1A\n; lanes 1, 3). Anti-myc immunoblots of whole\u2013cell lysates and myc-KIR6.2 immunoprecipitate from cells transfected with myc-KIR6.2 showed bands at \u223c75\u2009kDa, \u223c110\u2009kDa, and \u223c150\u2009kDa (\nFig. 1A\n; lanes 2, 4). An additional band at \u223c38\u2009kDa was observed in the anti-myc immunoblot of myc-KIR6.2 immunoprecipiate (\nFig. 1A\n; lane 4). These four bands correspond to the monomer and multimers of KIR6.2.\n32\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nKIR6.2 antibody validation. (\nA)\nWhole\u2013cell lysate (WL) or anti-myc immunoprecipitate (IP) were prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with myc-KIR6.2 or empty vector; immunoblot with anti-myc antibody showed no bands with expression of empty vector (lanes 1, 3), and showed KIR6.2 monomers and multimers with KIR6.2 expression (lanes 2, 4); immunoblot with GTX80493 anti-KIR6.2 antibody showed a single faint nonspecific band in WL immunoblot of empty vector (lane 5), and showed KIR6.2 monomers and multimers with KIR6.2 expression (lanes 6, 8); representative of three experiments.

Upper panel: superimposed double immunolabeling for KIR6.2 (GTX80493, GeneTex; green) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; red) showed astrocytes that express KIR6.2 (asterisks); in the same field, other cells identified by 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining of nuclei showed no immunoreactivity for GFAP or KIR6.2 (red circles). Lower panel:\nin situ\nhybridization for\nKcnj11\nin the same tissue section showed positive signal within the same astrocytes that express KIR6.2 protein (asterisks), and no signal in cells that express no KIR6.2 protein (circles); representative of five experiments.\n(E)\nDouble immunolabeling for KIR6.2 using APC-020 (Alomone Labs; green) and GFAP (red) in tissues from the same case as in (D) confirmed the specificity of the anti-KIR6.2 antibody, GTX80493.\n(F)\nDouble immunolabeling for KIR6.2 (GTX80493, GeneTex; green; green) and GFAP (red) in control (uninjured) cortical tissue showed that GTX80493 exhibited no immunoreactivity when used to label control GFAP+ tissues.\nThe antibody from GeneTex yielded an immunoblot that was nearly identical to that obtained with anti-myc antibody (\nFig. 1A\n; lanes 5\u20138). GTX80493 detected all multimers of KIR6.2 (\nFig. 1A\n; lane 8). GTX80493 showed one faint nonspecific band \u223c120\u2009kDa in the absence of KIR6.2 expression (\nFig. 1A\n; lane 5).\nThe antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were evaluated using only whole\u2013cell lysates (\nFig. 1B\n; lanes 1, 2). When used to immunoblot lysates that did not contain KIR6.2, the sc-11228 immunoblot showed many nonspecific bands (\nFig. 1B\n; lane 3), and detected KIR6.2 only very poorly (\nFig. 1B\n; lane 4). Similarly, sc-11226 showed many nonspecific bands (\nFig. 1B\n; lane 5), although it did detect all KIR6.2 multimers (\nFig. 1B\n; lane 6).\nWe also evaluated the ability of GTX80493 to distinguish between KIR6.2 and KIR6.1 (both of which can be expressed by astrocytes; see\nDiscussion\n). COS7 cells were used to express myc-KIR6.2 or myc-KIR6.1, as above. Immunoblot using anti-myc antibody confirmed the expression of both (\nFig. 1C\n). Immunoblot using GTX80493 again confirmed detection of KIR6.2 multimers, but KIR6.1 was not detected. As noted above, GTX80493 showed one faint nonspecific band \u223c120\u2009kDa in both the absence and presence of KIR6.x expression (\nFig. 1C\n).\nTo further validate GTX80493 specifically for immunohistochemistry, we used it to co-localized expression of KIR6.2 protein and\nKcnj11\nmRNA in brain tissue sections from contusion-TBI patients.\nIn situ\nhybridization was performed for\nKcnj11\nmRNA, and the same tissue section was double-immunolabeled for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and for KIR6.2 using GTX80493 (see\nMethods\n). Immunolabeling showed GFAP-expressing stellate cells with prominent expression of KIR6.2, with the same cells also exhibiting\nKcnj11\nmRNA (\nFig. 1D\n; asterisks). In the same field, other cells were present, as identified by nuclear staining with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI); these cells showed no immunoreactivity with GTX80493, and no\nKcnj11\nmRNA (\nFig. 1D\n; circles). Using a different anti-KIR6.2 antibody (APC-020; Alomone Labs) that was validated previously\n28\nconfirmed astrocyte-specific expression of KIR6.2 in the same tissue specimen (\nFig. 1E\n). GTX80493 exhibited no immunoreactivity when used to label control (uninjured) GFAP+ tissues (\nFig. 1F\n).\nAll immunohistochemistry for KIR6.2 reported in this manuscript was conducted using GTX80493.\n\nHistology, immunolabeling, and immunoFRET of human tissues\nHuman sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin using routine techniques, and were examined with light microscopy. For terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, cryosections were processed according to kit instructions (C10617; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.).\nFor fluorescence immunohistochemistry, cryosections were blocked 1\u2009h in 2% donkey serum (D9663; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 0.2% Triton X-100. After rinsing, sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with a primary antibody: goat ant-SUR1 (1:500; custom antibody,\n26\nmouse monoclonal anti-SUR1 (1:100; S289-16; Novus Biologicals), goat anti-SUR1 (C-16; 1:200; sc-5789; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), chicken anti-TRPM4 (1:500; custom antibody), goat anti-TRPM4 (G-20; 1:200; sc-27540; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or KIR6.2 (1:100; GTX80493; GeneTex, Irvine, CA). After labeling for one of the channel subunits, double immunolabeling was performed using either: CY3-conjugated, monoclonal anti-GFAP (1:500; C9205; Sigma-Aldrich), or rabbit anti-collagen IV (1:200; ab6586; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or mouse anti-CD68 (ED1; 1:100; MAB1435; Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA), to analyze cell-specific expression. For visualization, we used fluorescent-labeled species-appropriate secondary antibodies (1:500, Alexa Fluor 488 [green] and Alexa Fluor 555 [red]; Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at room temperature. Sections were cover-slipped using ProLong Gold antifade reagent containing the nuclear stain, DAPI (Invitrogen). Immunolabeled sections were visualized using epifluorescence microscopy (Nikon Eclipse 90i; Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY). Specific labeling was defined as fluorescence intensity twice that of background. Controls included incubation with pre-immune serum, when available, omission of primary antibodies, and testing cell-specific antibodies (anti-GFAP, anti-CD68) to assure no cross-reactivity with SUR1, TRPM4, or KIR6.2.\nTo demonstrate formation of SUR1-TRPM4 and SUR1-KIR6.2 heteromers, we performed antibody-based F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (immunoFRET),\n33\nusing methods we described.\n26\n,\n34\n,\n35\nTo study SUR1-TRPM4 heteromers, we used rabbit anti-SUR1 (1:200; custom antibody) and goat anti-TRPM4 (G-20; 1:200; sc-27540; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) primary antibodies, along with donkey anti-rabbit CY5 (1:100) and mouse anti-goat CY3 (1:100) (the Jackson Laboratory) secondary antibodies. To study SUR1-KIR6.2 heteromers, we used goat anti-SUR1 (1:400; custom antibody) and rabbit anti-KIR6.2 (1:50: GTX80493; Genetex) primary antibodies, along with donkey anti-rabbit CY5 (1:100) and mouse anti-goat CY3 (1:100; the Jackson Laboratory) secondary antibodies. Sections were first immunolabeled using a mixture of the two primary antibodies, with incubation performed overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the sections were incubated with a mixture of the two secondary antibodies for 1\u2009h, rinsed and cover-slipped. FRET fluorescence imaging was analyzed on a commercial laser scanning microscope combination system, LSM510 Meta (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with an Axiovert inverted microscope and a 63\u2009\u00d7\u2009oil immersion lens. The following settings were used throughout the experiments: for Cy3, excitation, 543\u2009nm; detection, 565\u2013615\u2009nm; for Cy5, excitation, 633\u2009nm; detection, 650\u2013704\u2009nm. The images were captured and processed with the LSM Image Examiner software (Zeiss), with an integration time of 5\u2009msec/pixel. ROIs were three rectangles, 225\u2009\u00d7\u2009180\u2009\u03bcm, positioned within GFAP+ tissues. Controls studied here included omission of primary antibodies and study of uninjured control brain tissues; additional controls for immunoFRET validation used a COS-7 cell expression system, as described.\n26\n\nImmunohistochemistry analysis\nChannel subunit expression was assessed in all cases, but was quantified only in cases with GFAP-positive specimens. Unbiased measurements of signal intensity within regions of interest (ROIs) were obtained using NIS-Elements AR software (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY). Images were collected from sections double immunolabeled for GFAP and SUR1 or TRPM4 or KIR6.2. The GFAP channel was used to define ROIs (pixel intensity >2\u2009\u00d7\u2009background). The GFAP-defined ROIs were used to quantify astrocyte-specific expression of SUR1, TRPM4, or KIR6.2, with the % ROI calculated by dividing the number of positive pixels (> 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009background) for individual channel subunits by the total number of GFAP+ pixels in the ROI. For each case, three representative areas (410\u2009\u00d7\u2009325\u2009\u03bcm ROI) were analyzed and averaged.\n\nIn situ hybridization\nFor\nin situ\nhybridization, cryosections were processed with digoxigenin-labeled probes against\nAbcc8\n(antisense: 5\u2032-TGCAGGGGTCAGGGTCAGGGCGCTGTCGGTCCACTTGGCCAGCCAGTA-3\u2032), TRPM4 (antisense: 5\u2032-CCGAGAGTGGAATTCCCGGATGAGGCGGTAACGCTGC-3\u2032), or KIR6.2 (antisense: 5\u2032-CCATGCGCCCCCCAAAGCCAATAGTCACTTGGACCTCAAT-3\u2032), supplied by IDT (Skokie, IL).\nIn situ\nhybridization was performed on 10-\u03bcm sections and controls using an IsHyb In Situ Hybridization (ISH) Kit (Biochain Institute, Inc., Newark, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sections were incubated in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)\u2013treated PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20\u2009min. After being rinsed twice with DEPC-PBS, the slides were treated with 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL proteinase K at 37\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. Slides were then washed in DEPC-PBS, rinsed with DEPC-H\n2\nO, and prehybridized with ready-to-use prehybridization solution (BioChain Institute, Newark, CA) for 3\u2009h at 50\u00b0C. The DIG-labeled probe was diluted in hybridization buffer (BioChain Institute, Newark, CA) and applied at 4\u2009ng/\u03bcL. Sections then were incubated at 45\u00b0C for 16\u2009h. Post-hybridization washing and immunological detection, using anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase (AP) with NBT/BCIP as substrates were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. AP-conjugated anti-DIG antibodies (1:100 PBS diluted, BioChain Institute, Newark, CA), were incubated with slides for 2\u2009h. Finally, slides were rinsed in distilled H\n2\nO and then were immunolabeled for the corresponding protein using a fluorescent secondary antibody, as above.\n\nRat experiments\nEthics statement\nWe certify that all applicable institutional and governmental regulations concerning the ethical use of animals were followed during the course of this research. Animal experiments were performed under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, and in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations as stipulated in the United States National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.\nSubjects and surgical procedure for contusion-TBI\nMale Wistar rats, ages 12\u201316 weeks (325\u2013400\u2009g; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN), were anesthetized (60\u2009mg/kg ketamine plus 7.5\u2009mg/kg xylazine, intraperitoneally) and allowed to breathe room air spontaneously. Core temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C with an isothermal pad (Deltaphase; Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA). Oxygen saturation and heart rate were monitored using a pulse oximeter (Mouse Ox\u2122; STARR Life Sciences Corp., Oakmont, PA). Surgical incision sites were prepared using iodine and alcohol, and a sterile environment was maintained throughout the procedure. Rats were mounted in a stereotactic apparatus (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). Lidocaine solution (2%) was injected prior to making an incision. A midline scalp incision was made to expose the skull. A circular bone incision positioned 2\u2009mm anterior to lambda and 1\u2009mm lateral to midline was made using a high-speed drill with a 1\u2009mm diamond burr (Dremel, model 732), to create a 6-mm diameter craniotomy in the left parietal region. After removing the bone flap, contusion-TBI was induced using a controlled cortical impact device (Impact One impactor system; 39463920; Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) with the following parameter settings: 5\u2009mm diameter impactor, angled 20\u00b0 from vertical, 4.5\u2009mm tissue displacement from the dural surface, 1\u2009m/sec velocity, 200\u2009msec dwell time. The bone flap was then repositioned and cemented in place using a cyanoacrylate adhesive (Loctite\n\u00ae\n454 Prism Instant Adhesive Gel plus Insta-Set accelerator). For analgesia, we used buprenorphine (0.05\u2009mg/kg) 15\u2009min before surgery then every 12\u2009h for 24\u2009h.\nSeries\nFour series of rats with contusion-TBI were studied. In series 1, five contusion-TBI rats were euthanized at each of four time-points: 6, 12, 24 and 72\u2009h, with five uninjured rats serving as controls; these rats were used for immunohistochemistry. In series 2, five contusion-TBI rats received no treatment and were euthanized at 15\u2009min to measure the hemorrhagic lesion area (primary hemorrhage before HPC) and hemispheric swelling. In series 3, 18 contusion-TBI rats were administered either glibenclamide (nine rats) or vehicle (nine rats). In series 4, 53 contusion-TBI rats were administered either antisense-oligodeoxynucleotide (AS-ODN) targeting a channel subunit, or scrambled ODN (Scr-ODN) or sense ODN (SE-ODN) as control, including AS-ODN targeting SUR1 (12 rats, with 10 Scr-ODN controls), TRPM4 (seven rats, with eight SE-ODN controls) or KIR6.2 (eight rats, with eight SE-ODN controls). Rats in series 3 and series 4, were euthanized at 24\u2009h to measure the hemorrhagic lesion area (primary hemorrhage plus secondary hemorrhage after HPC) and hemispheric swelling.\nTreatments\nThe drug formulation for glibenclamide (#G2539; Sigma) in dimethyl sulfoxide was as described.\n36\nTreatment consisted of administering a single loading dose of glibenclamide (10\u2009\u03bcg/kg) or an equivalent volume of vehicle intraperitoneally within 10\u2009min of trauma, as well as continuous infusion via mini-osmotic pump (Alzet 2001, 1.0\u2009\u03bcL/h; Alzet Corp, Cupertino, CA) beginning at the end of surgery, resulting in delivery of 400\u2009ng/h or an equivalent volume of vehicle subcutaneously until euthanasia. The dose of glibenclamide used here has been shown to not result in hypoglycemia.\nAnti-SUR1 (5\u2032-GGCCGAGTGGTTCTCGGT-3\u2032) and anti-TRPM4 (5'-TTGTGGTAACACTCTCCAAA-3\u2032) AS-ODNs were described and validated previously in rats\nin vivo\n.\n37\u201339\nThese AS-ODNs were shown to result in >60% suppression of protein expression as well as highly significant reductions in progressive hemorrhagic necrosis in a contusion spinal cord injury model. Anti-KIR6.2 (5\u2032-CCTTTCGGGACAGCATGGCT-3\u2032) AS-ODN was described and validated previously in rats\nin vivo\n.\n40\nThis AS-ODN was shown to result in 80% suppression of\nKcnj11\nmRNA expression in the basal ganglia. ODNs, which were phosphorothioated at 4 distal bonds at both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends to protect against endogenous nucleases,\n41\nwere obtained commercially (Sigma-Aldrich). Prior to surgery, mini-osmotic pumps (Alzet 2001D, 8\u2009\u03bcL/h; Durect Corp.) fitted with jugular vein catheters were loaded with ODN and primed. ODN solutions were prepared in sterile normal saline (NS; 4\u2009mg/mL). Immediately after trauma, the jugular vein was catheterized, a loading dose of ODN (400\u2009\u03bcg in 100\u2009\u03bcL) was administered intravenously, and the pump catheter was inserted into the vein with the pump implanted subcutaneously in the dorsal thorax, to obtain intravenous delivery of ODN at a rate of 32\u2009\u03bcg /h until euthanasia, yielding a total dose delivered of \u223c1.2\u2009mg/24\u2009h.\nExclusions\nIn all series, there was no unplanned mortality, and no animal was excluded for any reason.\n\nHemorrhagic lesion area and hemispheric swelling\nAt the designated time after trauma, rats were euthanized by an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (> 100\u2009mg/kg), then underwent transcardial perfusion with NS (60\u2009mL) followed by 10% neutral buffered formalin (50\u2009mL; Sigma-Aldrich). Immediately after perfusion-fixation, brains were harvested and bisected coronally at the contusion epicenter using a pre-chilled (-20\u00b0C) rat brain coronal matrix (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA). The exposed coronal faces were imaged on a flatbed scanner to obtain high resolution digital images (red-green-blue [RGB]; 600\u2009dpi).\nTo obtain unbiased measurements of hemorrhagic lesion area, we used an algorithm-based segmentation protocol similar to what we used previously for TTC-stained sections after ischemia,\n42\ntaking into account that the colors red and white have opposite biological meaning in the two scenarios. NIS-Elements AR software (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) was used to process the RGB images. The quadrant that included cortex, corpus callosum and hippocampus with normal-appearing brain surrounding the contusion was outlined manually. The hemorrhagic lesion area within this quadrant was determined, based on pixel intensities identified by a histogram of the green channel (dark pixels depict blood; brighter pixels depict normal brain). The percent hemorrhagic lesion was calculated based on the hemorrhagic lesion area and the area of the manually traced ipsilateral hemisphere. The percent hemispheric swelling was calculated based on the areas of the manually traced ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. This unbiased method of segmentation for determining the hemorrhagic lesion area was validated in a subset of images by two investigators (ZI, JAS), blinded to treatment group, who independently traced the hemorrhagic area manually on full color RGB images. HPC is defined as the increase in hemorrhagic lesion area at 24\u2009h compared with 15\u2009min after trauma.\n\nImmunolabeling and TUNEL staining of rat tissues\nFor rat tissues, cryosections were immunolabeled as above using the following primary antibodies: goat ant-SUR1 (1:500; custom antibody),\n26\nchicken anti-TRPM4 (1:500; custom antibody), goat anti-TRPM4 (G-20; 1:200; sc-27540; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or KIR6.2 (1:100; GTX80493; GeneTex, Irvine, CA). After labeling for one of the channel subunits, double immunolabeling was performed using either: CY3-conjugated, monoclonal anti-GFAP (1:500; C9205; Sigma-Aldrich), or monoclonal anti-RECA (MA1-81510; 1:100; HIS52; Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), or mouse anti-CD68 (ED1; 1:100; MAB1435; Millipore Sigma), to analyze cell specific expression. Secondary antibodies and subsequent image processing, as well as TUNEL labeling were performed as above.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM, unless otherwise noted. The treatment effect (percent reduction in hemorrhagic lesion area or percent reduction in hemispheric swelling) was calculated as: (A\nV\n\u2013A\nD\n)/(A\nV\n-A\nB\n)*100, where A\nB\nis area at baseline, A\nV\nis area at 24\u2009h with vehicle/control treatment, and A\nD\nis area at 24\u2009h with drug treatment. Statistical analyses were performed using Origin Pro (V8; OriginLab Corp, Northampton, MA). Student's\nt\n-test and one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's honestly significant difference\npost hoc\ncomparisons were used as appropriate."

    "Methods": "Study design\nWritten informed assent (child) and consent (parent) were obtained under the protocol approved by the institutional review board. A retrospective study included 10 typically developing (TD) subjects and 10 subjects with chronic SCI who underwent SC imaging in 2014\u20132017. A sample of consecutive subjects were studied consisting of 10 TD (age range, 6\u201316 years; mean age, 12.38\u2009\u00b1\u20092.81; 3 male and 7 female) and 10 subjects with chronic SCI (age range, 6\u201316 years; mean age, 12.33\u2009\u00b1\u20093.03; 6 male and 4 female).\nTable 1\nshows the demographic information of the SCI subjects and the extent of the lesion as defined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All MRI lesions represented contiguous abnormality. There were three patients who had non-traumatic SCI as follows: subject 205 had a focal non-traumatic spinal cord hemorrhage, subject 203 had a spinal cord tumor and a post-resection SCI, and subject 115 had focal transverse myelitis with chronic residual neurological symptoms. Two SCI subjects, 205 and 115, had no focal abnormality on MRI and, therefore, represented Spinal Cord Injury without Radiographic Abnormality (SCIWORA). The cephalad and caudal margins of the lesion present on MRI in these subjects were based on the neurological level determined by the ISNCSCI examination (\nTable 1\n).\nTable 1.\nDemographic Information of the SCI Subjects\nSubject ID\nAge at enrollment (years)\nAge at the time of injury\n(years)\nTime interval from injury to DTI studies (years)\nGender\nCephalad and caudal margins of the lesion present on MRI\nNL\nAIS grade\nISNCSCI motor scores\nISNCSCI sensory scores\nCause\n201\n11.12\n4.73\n6.38\nM\nC5-C6 to mid T5\nC6\nA\n42\n23\nMVA\n204\n12.65\n5\n7.65\nF\nC6-C7 to conus\nT3\nA\n50\n44\nMVA\n215\n14.96\n13.66\n1.30\nM\nMid C6 to T1-T2\nC8\nA\n50\n31\nMVA\n208\n8.08\n2.09\n5.98\nM\nMid C6 to C7-T1\nC8\nA\n50\n36\nMVA\n205\n9.41\n8.29\n1.13\nF\na\nMid T8 to mid T9\nT9\nA\n50\n69\nBleed\n209\n15.71\n12\n3.71\nM\nT8-T9 to conus\nT9\nA\n50\n64\nMVA\n203\n11.04\n1.5\n9.54\nF\nMid T5 to mid T8\nT4\nA\n50\n48\nTumor resection\n217\n16.99\n15.82\n1.16\nM\nMid C3 to mid C4\nC4\nB\n24\n38\nDiving\n115\n9.24\n1.82\n7.41\nM\na\nMid C5 to mid C6\nC6\nB\n45\n108\nTM\n221\n14.12\n0.7\n13.43\nF\nC6-C7 to mid T6\nT3\nB\n50\n44\nMVA\nOpen in a separate window\na\nBased on NL.\nSCI, spinal cord injury; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; NL, neurological level; AIS, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale; ISNCSCI, International Standard of Neurological Classification for Spinal Cord Injury; TM, transverse myelitis; MVA, motor vehicle accident.\nInclusion criteria for the TD subjects were: no evidence of SCI or pathology, as assessed by performing a neurological screen and a brief assessment of motor and sensory function and reflexes. Inclusion criteria for SCI subjects were: stable SCI in the past 3 months and being at least 6 months post-SCI. Exclusion criteria were: being unable to tolerate MRI without sedation, scoliosis, any abnormality (unrelated to the SCI) of the nervous and/or musculoskeletal system, or orthodontic hardware or other internal metal material.\n\nISNCSCI\nAll the subjects with SCI underwent a full neurological evaluation based on ISNCSCI.\n14\nThe evaluation consisted of manual muscle strength testing of five upper and lower extremity muscles bilaterally, testing of light touch and sharp\u2013dull discrimination at 28 dermatomes bilaterally, and a rectal examination of sensory and motor function.\n14\nThe upper extremity and lower extremity total motor possible scores ranged from 0 to 25 for each limb (maximum score of 50 for each side). The sensory score ranged from 0 to 56 for each modality on each side (maximum score of 112 on each side). The ISNCSCI total motor score refers to the sum of the bilateral upper extremity and lower extremity motor scores, and the ISNCSCI total light touch sensory score is the sum of right and left light touch scores.\n\nImaging acquisition\nA 3T MR scanner (Siemens, Germany) with a four channel neck matrix and an eight channel spine matrix coil was used. Conventional T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans were obtained for all the subjects. The T2-weighted image of the cervical and thoracic SC in the sagittal plane was initially obtained using a gradient echo (GRE) sequence and was used to facilitate slice prescription for the subsequent scans perpendicular to the cord. Next, an axial GRE T2-weighted, sagittal T2-weighted 3D SPACE; sagittal turbo spin-echo (TSE), T1-weighted; sagittal TSE T2-weighted; and axial DTI scans using an inner field of view (iFOV) sequence were obtained for the subjects. The iFOV sequence used in this study has been described in detail elsewhere\n15\nand was based on a diffusion sensitized single-shot echo planar imaging sequence using 2D radiofrequency excitations, which allows for higher in-plane resolution with fewer geometric distortions and improved signal-to-noise ratio. Manual shim volume adjustments were also performed prior to data acquisition in order to restrict the adjustment volume to the anatomy of interest in an effort to further improve signal.\nThe iFOV sequence was optimized for both signal and scan duration to image the entire cervical and thoracic SC. DTI scans were acquired axially in the same anatomical location prescribed for the T2-weighted GRE images to cover the cervical (C1-upper thoracic region) and thoracic (upper thoracic-L1) SC using two overlapping slabs.\n16\nThe imaging parameters for each slab of DTI acquisition included: field of view, 164\u2009mm; phase field of view, 47\u2009mm; number of excitations, 3; number of diffusion directions, 20; b0 images, 6; b-value, 800\u2009s/mm\n2\n; voxel, 0.8\u2009\u00d7\u20090.8\u2009\u00d7\u20096\u2009mm\n3\n; axial slices, 40; repetition time, 7900\u2009ms; echo time, 110\u2009ms; and acquisition time, 8:49\u2009min. Anesthesia and cardiac and respiratory gating were not used, to shorten scan times.\n\nData pre-processing\nA central mask was applied to the raw DTI images to eliminate the anatomy outside the SC. Motion correction was performed first on the 6 b0 images to create a mean b0 image, and the diffusion weighted images were subsequently co-registered to the mean b0 image.\n17\nThe diffusion data sets were corrected for motion-induced artifacts based on 3D registration technique using an in-house software developed in Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA).\n17\nThe technique uses rigid body transformation with 6 degrees of freedom (3 translational, 3 axis rotations) paired with normalized mutual information as cost function to align target images (20 diffusion directional images) with the reference image (b0). A robust, iterative diffusion tensor estimation scheme, RESTORE, was implemented to ensure removal of data outliers from the final tensor fit.\n18\nAll the processing was performed using in-house software developed in Matlab.\n6\n\nRegion of interest (ROI) analysis\nROIs were drawn manually on axial fractional anisotropy (FA) maps to extract information from the SC WM areas: right and left lateral, ventral, and dorsal (\nFig. 1\n). ROI's included: right and left posterolateral (lateral corticospinal and rubrospinal motor tracts), ventral (medial reticulospinal, ventral corticospinal, and tectospinal motor tracts); and dorsal (fasciculus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus sensory tracts). The right and left posterolateral ROIs were specifically placed dorsal to a line that bisected the anterior and posterior cord to attempt to not include the lateral spinothalamic tract (\nFig. 2\n). The ROI was drawn at each intervertebral disk and mid-vertebral body level of the cervical and thoracic SC to compute DTI metrics FA, mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). There was a consistent sparring of the outer margin of the SC of approximately one voxel width, to minimize volume averaging with cerebrospinal fluid. These ROIs were anatomically localized by a board-certified pediatric neuroradiologist using axial T2-weighted GRE images as a reference.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRegions of interest (ROIs) are anatomically defined on the gray scale axial fractional anisotropy (FA) map (for diffusion tensor imaging [DTI] metrics) to extract information from the spinal cord white matter (WM) areas: Right and left lateral (dark and light blue), ventral (green) and dorsal (yellow) regions respectively.

Regions of interest (ROIs) for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are drawn on the dorsal region to include fasciculus gracilis (1) and fasciculus cuneatus (2), right and left lateral regions to include the lateral corticospinal tract (3) and rubrospinal tract (4), and ventral region to include the medial reticulospinal tract (5) tectospinal tract (6), and ventral corticospinal tract (7).\nFor each SCI subject, we chose to separate the normal-appearing cord on the MRI cephalad and caudal to the lesion into three equal segments: proximal third, middle third, and distal third in relation to the lesion present on MRI, or the neurological level of injury in patients with SCIWORA (\nTable 1\n). For choosing the TD cord for comparison, we took the epicenter as the average of the SC lesion in all the 10 SCI subjects, which was mid T3, C1 to T2-T3 was defined as the cephalad SC, and T3-T4 to T12-L1 was defined as the caudal SC. In the group analysis of the six segments (three cephalad, three caudal) of the entire cord, the TD cord was separated into proximal third, middle third, and distal third and compared with the respective segments in the SCI subjects.\nAdditionally, we analyzed five vertebral body levels cephalad and caudal to the lesion for all subjects, to examine the more detailed DTI changes in the immediate perilesional SC regions. For the TD group, the cephalad levels included C5 to mid T2, and the caudal levels included mid T4 to mid T8. The mean of each of the five vertebral body levels both cephalad and caudal to the lesion was determined for all subjects (\nFigs. 3\nand\n\u200b\nand4\n4\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nScatter plots showing mean fractional anisotropy (FA)\n(A)\n, axial diffusivity (AD)\n(B)\n, mean diffusivity (MD)\n(C)\n, and radial diffusivity (RD)\n(D)\nmeasurements for the motor tracts (right and left lateral and ventral white matter) for five vertebral body levels cephalad and caudal to the lesion for typically developing (TD) subjects and subjects with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI).

    "Methods": "Study population\nA sample of 130 participants enrolled at three level I trauma centers for the TRACK-TBI Pilot study was included in this analysis. Patients were enrolled between April 2010 and January 2011. Inclusion criteria for enrollment in TRACK-TBI Pilot included patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) within 24\u2009h of brain injury and were triaged to a clinically indicated non-contrast head CT scan. Following the evidence-based guidelines, informed consent was obtained, and all data collection procedures followed protocols by the institutional review boards of the participating centers (University of California, San Francisco/Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, CA; University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA; and University Medical Center Brackenridge, Austin, TX). Patients were excluded if they were pregnant, could not speak English, or presented with a psychological disorder that precluded them from giving consent. Others were excluded because of major polytrauma that would interfere with follow-up tests, infectious conditions, or late-stage cancer.\n21\n\nSample collection\nBlood samples were collected within 24\u2009h of injury (see\nFig. S1\nfor distribution of time from injury to blood draw for each patient), and plasma was prepared according to the TBI Common Data Elements (CDE) Biospecimens and Biomarkers Working Group guidelines (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n).\n22\nSamples were centrifuged, aliquoted, and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C for future batch processing. Frozen plasma samples were sent to Myriad Rules-Based Medicine (Myriad RBM, Austin, TX) for protein analysis. Proteins were quantified using a multiplexed fluorescent immunoassay profile (HumanMAP v2.0). Protein concentrations for a total of 72 targets were quantified for each sample. Lower limit of quantification and least detectable dose for each analyte can be found in\nTable S1\n(see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n).\n\nInitial CT scan\nA brain CT was performed on all patients within 24\u2009h of ED presentation. CT data collection and interpretation were performed in accordance with TBI-CDE Working Group.\n23\nAll CT scans were uploaded to a central database, from which a blinded board-certified neuroradiologist reviewed the de-identified scans.\n\nOutcome measures\nSubjects in TRACK-TBI Pilot underwent outcomes testing using measures from the TBI CDE core outcomes battery.\n24\nThe Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) was used to assess overall functional disability at 3 and 6 months post-injury.\n25\nThe GOS-E consists of eight categories of outcome: 1(Dead), 2(Vegetative State), 3(Lower Severe Disability), 4(Upper Severe Disability), 5(Lower Moderate Disability), 6(Upper Moderate Disability), 7(Lower Good Recovery), and 8(Upper Good Recovery).\n26\nThis 8-point GOS-E was dichotomized in two ways to assess (1) full recovery (GOS-E\u2009=\u20098, indicative of a return to pre-injury baseline), or not (GOS-E < 8), and (2) good recovery (GOS-E < 4) or poor recovery (GOS-E > 4), in keeping with the practice of previous TRACK-TBI studies and other clinical trials.\n15\n,\n21\n,\n27\nCognitive domain was assessed after injury using the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II), a memory and verbal learning memory task. This test was only given at 6 months. The task consists of five learning trials, an interference trial, an immediate recall trial, and a delayed (20\u2009min) recall trial. The CVLT-II trials 1\u2013 5 Standard Score is a sum of the first five learning trials normed for age and sex, and provides a global index of verbal learning ability.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 24 (IBM, Inc. Chicago, IL). Non-linear principal components analysis (NL-PCA) was used to determine covariance among proteins. To confirm the stability of the PC loadings, a bootstrapping procedure was employed using 1000 balanced iterations. To provide further cross-validation of PC loading patterns, the root mean squared difference between initial and bootstrapped PC loadings was assessed, as well the Pearson product correlation coefficient, coefficient of congruence, and Cattell's salient variable similarity index.\n27\nIndividual scores for each patient on the PCs were then calculated based on the weight of the loadings for all proteins. For CT and GOS-E measures, PC scores were compared with outcome measures using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to determine the predictive validity of protein biomarker clusters. Linear regression was to test the first principal component (PC1) score as a predictor of CVLT, as well as to determine the variance in each outcome measure explained by PC1 score. Statistical significance level for all analyses was set to \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05."

Adult male CD1 mice (weighing 25\u201330\u2009g) (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were housed for 5\u20137 days in standard facilities before experiments, with access to water and food\nad libitum\n. Forty animals were randomized into four groups: sham craniotomy and vehicle (0.9% normal saline) without controlled cortical impact (CCI) or tibial FX (Sham,\nn\n=\u200910); TBI and vehicle (CCI,\nn\n=\u200910); TBI and tibial FX + vehicle (CCI+FX,\nn\n=\u200910); TBI and tibial fracture and ENX (CCI+FX+ENX,\nn\n=\u200910). ENX (1\u2009mg/kg, Winthrop, Sanofiaventis, NJ) or an equal volume of 0.9% normal saline (1\u2009mL/kg, Baxter Deerfield, IL) were injected into all animals subcutaneously at 2, 8, 14, 23, and 32\u2009h after CCI (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental design and procedures.\n(A)\nTimeline of the experimental protocol.\n(B)\nSchematic representation of localization of both craniotomies.\n(C)\nA fluoroscopic image of tibial fracture with internal fixation 2 days following injury. The white arrow indicates the tibial fracture site. The fracture was isolated to the tibia (not the fibula), and an intermedullary pin was used for fixation.\n\nTBI model: CCI\nTo simulate severe TBI, we adopted the validated CCI model for mice, which is widely used in experimental TBI reports.\n19\n,\n20\nAt time 0, mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine, xylazine, and acepromazine (KXA) (100, 10, 1\u2009mg/kg, respectively) and placed prone in a stereotactic device. After scalp incision, a left-sided 3\u2009mm craniotomy was created with a trephine, centered between the sagittal, bregma, and lambda sutures (\nFig.1B\n). The exposed left parietotemporal cortex, covered with dura mater, was then directly injured using a CCI device (AMS 201; AmScien Instruments, Richmond, VA). The velocity, area, and depth of impact remained constant for all animals, consistent with severe TBI (impact velocity of 6\u2009m/sec, 3\u2009mm diameter impactor tip, and cortical deformation of 1.0\u2009mm).\n19\nSham animals underwent craniotomy but not CCI.\n\nLong bone injury: Open tibial diaphyseal FX with intramedullary fixation\nTo simulate the most common concomitant injury with TBI, we adopted a validated long-bone FX model. Immediately after CCI and prior to anesthetic reversal, a right-sided open midshaft tibial FX was created and immediately repaired with intramedullary fixation under aseptic conditions.\n21\nBriefly, the mouse was placed in a lateral decubitus position, and a skin incision (2\u2009mm) was made on the proximal end of the leg anteriorly. A small hole was made on the articular tibial plateau, extending into the medullary cavity, using a 26 G needle. The skin incision was distally extended by 5\u2009mm to expose the tibia, and a transverse osteotomy was performed across the proximal diaphysis with Iris scissors. The tibial FX was then stabilized with an intramedullary rod (inner trocar of a 22 G spinal needle) inserted through the tibial plateau hole, along the bone marrow cavity to the distal tibial shaft. The protruding pin extending beyond the cortex at the site of insertion was trimmed (\nFig.1C\n). Sham and CCI animals only underwent skin incision without FX or fixation.\nAll animals received buprenorphine (0.1\u2009mg/kg) for analgesia, every 6\u2009h for 48\u2009h after surgery, regardless of group assignment.\n\nLive intravital microscopy (IVM)\nIVM of the cerebral microcirculation was conducted.\n20\n,\n22\nForty-eight hours after CCI, animals were anesthetized and the right jugular vein was cannulated for administration of fluorescent dyes. Animals were placed in a stereotactic frame, and a second circular craniotomy (2.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u2009mm) was created adjacent to the first craniotomy using a handheld dental drill (Henry Schein, Melville, NY) (\nFig.1B\n) and covered with a 5\u2009mm glass cover-slip. Animals were then transferred to an intravital microscope (ECLIPSE FN1; Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) and received a 50\u2009\u03bcL IV bolus of 0.3% rhodamine 6G (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to fluorescently label circulating LEUs. Non-branching venules, 25\u201350\u2009\u03bcm in diameter, were randomly chosen, and 1\u2009min footage of the pial microcirculation was recorded under a 590\u2009nm epi-illumination emission filter using a digital camera (QuantEM; Photometrics, Tucson, AR).\nIntravenous bovine fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled albumin (Sigma-Aldrich; 100\u2009mg/kg) was then administered, and the same pial regions were visualized for determination of fluorescent albumin (FITC) leakage, a surrogate for microvascular BBB leakage. A 10\u2009sec video was recorded under the 488\u2009nm fluorescent filter.\n\nPial LEU/endothelial interactions and FITC albumin leakage (\nn\n=\u200940)\nLEU rolling and adhesion were evaluated using digital analysis software (NIS-elements; Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY). LEU rolling (mean number of labeled cells crossing a 100\u2009\u03bcm venular segment; LEUs/100\u2009\u03bcm/min) and LEU adhesion (labeled cells stationary for at least 30\u2009sec during recording period; LEUs/100\u2009\u03bcm) were counted by a blinded observer unaware of treatment groups (\nFig. 2A\n). Microvascular permeability was then determined using the same software, where FITC-albumin leakage was determined as the light intensity (grays) measured in three distinct regions within the vessel (venular intensity [Iv]) and outside the vessel wall (perivenular intensity [Ip]). The ratio of mean Ip to Iv for 10\u2009sec was calculated to determine the mean permeability index for the given vessel [(Ip/Iv)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100 %] (\nFig. 3A\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nIn vivo\nleukocyte/endothelial cell interactions.\n(A)\nRepresentative image of the pial microcirculation.

The increased number of rolling LEUs in CCI was significantly enhanced with a concomitant long bone fracture (FX), and enoxaparin (ENX) reduced this significantly.\n(C)\nForty-eight hour LEU adhesion to endothelium showed that CCI+FX increased the number of adherent LEUs compared with Sham procedure. *\np\n<\u20090.01 versus Sham; **\np\n<\u20090.05 versus Sham; #\np\n<\u20090.01 versus CCI+FX.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nIn vivo\nmicrovascular permeability.\n(A)\nRepresentative image of a post-capillary pial venule after fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-albumin injection.

Immediately after euthanasia, blood was obtained via cardiac puncture to measure hemoglobin levels using an i-STAT blood analyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL).\nFollowing euthanasia, bleeding assessments were conducted via autopsy to determine the extent of hemorrhage in different sites. Classification (no or mild [< 2\u2009mm diameter] [1 point], moderate [2\u20135mm diameter] [2 points] or extensive [> 5\u2009mm diameter] [3 points] hematoma) of each surgical site (tibia fracture, craniotomy, neck area) was conducted via gross inspection by an investigator unaware of treatment groups, and is presented as mean score per group.\n\nBrain and lung water content (\nn\n=\u200920)\nAfter euthanasia, and prior to autopsy, whole brains and left lungs were excised for wet-to-dry ratio determination from five mice in each group. Brains were divided along the midline into hemispheres. Samples were immediately weighed (wet weight [WW]) and again after 72\u2009h of drying at 70\u00b0C (dry weight [DW]) in an incubator. Tissue water content in each sample was calculated using standard wet-to-dry ratios [(WW \u2013 DW)/WW\u2009\u00d7\u2009100 %].\n\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) for neutrophils in brain (\nn\n=\u200920)\nIn five animals from each group (\nn\n=\u200920), excised brains were post-fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) (Sigma Aldrich) after transcardial perfusion with phosphate buffered solution (PBS) and 10% NBF. Brains were dissected into 2\u2009mm thick coronal blocks and processed to paraffin using standard techniques; 8\u2009\u03bcm thick sections were prepared for staining procedures.\nFollowing deparaffinization and rehydration, tissue sections were immersed in aqueous hydrogen peroxide (15\u2009min) to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. Antigen retrieval was performed in a microwave pressure cooker with immersion in preheated Tris ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) buffer. Subsequent blocking was achieved using 1% normal goat serum (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) in Optimax buffer (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA) for 30\u2009min. A rat monoclonal primary antibody specific for the protein Ly-6G (1: 15K, BD Bio sciences, San Jose, CA)\n25\nwas applied for 20\u2009h at 4\u00b0C.\nIncubation with the primary antibodies was performed for 20\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. After rinsing, sections were incubated with the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody for 30\u2009min (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA), followed by avidin biotin complex as per the manufacturer's instructions (Vectastain Universal Elite kit, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Finally, visualization was achieved using via 3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine (DAB), as per manufacturer's instructions (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Counterstaining with hematoxylin was performed.\nSlides were digitally scanned and visualized at 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification in Image Scope software (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The captured cross-sectional brain image was divided into four equal quadrants (superior ipsilateral hemisphere [Area 1], inferior ipsilateral hemisphere [Area 2], superior contralateral hemisphere [Area 3] and inferior contralateral hemisphere [Area4]) (\nFig. 4A\n).

    "Methods": "Participants\nTwenty-nine combat-deployed veterans were recruited from the Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System (VAPORHCS) in Portland, Oregon, including those who had been exposed to high-intensity blast discharges within the past 10 years, as well as those with no history of blast exposure or brain injury. Potential participants completed an interview regarding their military service, prior head trauma, and blast exposure(s), including symptoms immediately and within the first 24\u2009h of injury. Only participants who met basic criteria for brain injury (e.g., disorientation, ringing in the ears, nausea, light sensitivity, loss of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia, and headache immediately following the event) established by the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC) were admitted to the blast-exposed participant group. All participant reports were consistent with a classification of mTBI. Although a medical chart review was also performed to determine if a clinical diagnosis of TBI had been made, blast-exposed participants without the clinical diagnosis of TBI were still included in the study, as previous work has indicated that patients who meet the DVBIC criteria for brain injury following blast exposure experience auditory dysfunction similarly to those who have received a blast-related diagnosis of TBI.\n6\n,\n17\n,\n18\n,\n28\nAdditional exclusionary criteria included pure-tone hearing thresholds >30\u2009dB hearing level (HL) at any test frequencies between 250 and 4000\u2009Hz, threshold differences of >10\u2009dB between the left and right ear at any test frequency, and diagnosis of mental health conditions associated with poor sensory gating including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Sixteen participants (all males) were admitted to the blast-exposed group (average age 36.9 years; age range 24\u201358 years), and 13 participants (2 females) were admitted to the control group (average age 38 years, age range 19\u201366 years). The Institutional Review Board at the VAPORHCS approved this project, and all subjects provided oral and written informed consent prior to participation.\n\nStudy overview\nTesting was completed over two to three visits (\nFig. 1\n). Visit 1 consisted of screening measures, including an audiological assessment, an interview of past head traumas, and a medical history questionnaire. Once inclusionary criteria were confirmed, participants then completed speech-in-noise perception testing as well as additional self-report questionnaires. Following visit 1, a medical record review was conducted to determine if a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was present, and to confirm self-reported reported medical history. Visit 2 consisted of sensory gating testing, including both the ASR and AERP analyses. All participants completed visits 1 and 2.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic representation of study visits and procedures.\nVisit 3, which was not part of the original study design, was added to further assess comprehension of competing and degraded speech. All participants were invited back for this third visit; 15/16 blast-exposed participants, and 9/13 control participants returned for this test session.\n\nSelf-report measures\nAll participants completed a medical case history questionnaire including questions assessing audiological history, military service, other health diagnoses, and use of medications, cigarettes, alcohol, and illicit drugs. The Functional Hearing Questionnaire (FHQ), developed for veterans with brain injuries was used to evaluate self-perceived hearing difficulties.\n5\nThe FHQ is a nine item questionnaire that asks participants to rate their level of difficulty hearing in different circumstances on a four point scale. Scores range from 9 to 36, with higher scores indicating a greater level of difficulty. The Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults (HHIA)\n29\nwas used to assess the social and emotional impact of hearing difficulties on everyday life. The HHIA is a 25 item questionnaire that asks patients to rank how often auditory issues create problems in daily life. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater perceived levels of handicap. Lastly, all participants completed the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory-22 (NSI)\n30\nto assess post-concussive symptom severity. Each item is scored from 0, indicating no problem, to 4, indicating a severe debilitating problem.\n\nBehavioral speech perception testing\nAll speech testing was completed in a sound-attenuating chamber using ER3-A insert earphones (Etymotic Research, Elk Grove Village, IL). Speech-in-noise tests were selected from the Minimum Speech Test Battery\n31\nand presented via a CD player routed through an audiometer. The AzBio was selected as a sentence-level speech perception test. This test is composed of target sentences spoken by two male and two female speakers using conversational speech patterns presented at a level of 60\u2009dB HL.\n32\nConditions included binaural presentation of target sentences in quiet, and in the presence of 10-talker speech babble presented at 55\u2009dB HL and 60\u2009dB HL resulting in signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of +5\u2009dB and 0\u2009dB for the two speech-in-babble conditions, respectively. Each condition included 20 target sentences that participants were asked to repeat to the researcher. Word-level speech perception was measured using the Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant (CNC) test.\n33\nCNC test materials are comprised of monosyllabic words spoken by a female talker, each preceded by the carrier phrase \u201cReady\u201d. Each word consists of three speech phonemes including two consonant sounds with a vowel in the middle. CNC target words were presented at a level of 60\u2009dB HL in quiet and in 55\u2009dB HL of background noise (+5\u2009dB SNR) with a spectrum matching the average long-term spectrum of speech. In each condition (quiet and noise), responses were scored based upon the number of phonemes correctly repeated with a maximum score of 150 for each condition. Results for both the AzBio and CNC tests are presented as percent correct for each condition.\nAdditional speech tests included in the third test session consisted of two tests of competing dichotic speech (the Dichotic Digits Test [DDT] and the Staggered Spondaic Words [SSW] test) and one test of degraded speech (the Compressed Word Test [CWT] test). Each of these tests were developed for the clinical assessment of central auditory processing disorders, and previous research has indicated that blast-exposed veterans often perform poorly on these measures.\n6\n,\n18\nTests were presented at a level of 35\u2009dB above each participant's speech recognition threshold, determined during the audiological evaluation at the first visit, to ensure equivalent levels of audibility across all participants. The DDT consists of four numbers, two spoken to each ear nearly simultaneously.\n34\nParticipants were asked to repeat back all four numbers in any order, and scores were reported as percent correct. The SSW test consisted of 40 pairs of \u201cspondaic\u201d words, each \u201cspondee\u201d consisting of two complete one-syllable words (e.g., \u201ccupcake\u201d) spoken with equal emphasis on both syllables.\n35\nIn each trial, the two spondees were presented, one to each ear, such that the first syllable of the first spondee was presented in quiet in one ear and the second syllable of the first spondee overlapped the first syllable of the second spondee in the opposite ear. Participants were asked to repeat back both words and scores were reported as the total number of errors out of all 80 words. Lastly, the CWT test consisted of 50 monosyllabic words time-compressed to 45% of their original duration.\n36\nEach ear was tested separately and participants were asked to repeat back each word, with scoring reported as percentage of words correctly repeated.\n\nMeasurement of PPI and habituation of the ASR\nThe acoustic startle stimulus consisted of a 40\u2009ms duration burst of white noise presented at a level of 113\u2009A-weighted decibels (dBA) with a nearly instantaneous rise time. Stimuli were presented binaurally via ER3A insert earphones (Etymotic, Elk Grove Village, IL) over a continuous background of white noise presented at 60\u2009dB A. All stimulus presentations and responses were recorded using the Neuroscan Synamps System II (NeuroScan Inc., El Paso, TX). The skin below the left eye and on the forehead was first exfoliated and then cleansed using an alcohol swab. Eye blink responses to startle stimuli were measured by recording the electromyographic (EMG) activity from the orbicularis oculi muscle under the left eye using two EL254 Ag-AgCl electrodes (BIOPAC Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA) spaced \u223c25\u2009mm apart. An additional ground electrode was placed on the forehead.\nParticipants were seated in a reclining armchair within a double-walled sound-attenuating chamber and instructed to look at a static image of a beach scene located on the wall in front of them to maintain vigilance and eye gaze. Prior to testing, all participants were given the opportunity to listen to the acoustic startle stimulus to ensure tolerability. Testing began with the background white noise presented for 2\u2009min to allow participants to acclimate to the sound and test environment. All stimuli were presented at an average inter-trial interval of \u223c45\u2009sec (range 35\u201355\u2009sec). Four startle stimuli were initially presented, and the average EMG magnitude in response to these four initial startle stimuli was taken as the baseline startle response. Participants were then presented with 16 additional startle stimuli, 8 of which were preceded by a low-amplitude pre-pulse tone presented 120\u2009ms before the startle stimulus. The sequence of startle-only and prepulse and startle stimuli were randomized for each participant. The experiment ended with four additional startle stimuli (without pre-pulse tones), and the average EMG response to these final four stimuli was taken as the habituated startle response.\nThe raw EMG signal was amplified, sampled at 1000\u2009Hz, bandpass filtered between 30 and 200\u2009Hz, and rectified. Responses to startle stimuli were defined as EMG peak amplitude in a time window from 20 to 120\u2009ms after stimulus presentation. Trials with excessive EMG artifact, which obscured the response stimulus, were excluded (\u223c3%, or 12 of the 416 total trials). PPI was defined as the reduction in the magnitude of response from startle stimulus-only trials to prepulse and startle stimulus trials, and was calculated as the percent change in amplitude. Habituation was defined as the reduction in response magnitude from the initial four startle stimulus presentations to the final four startle stimulus presentations, and was calculated as the percent change in amplitude.\n\nMeasurement of cortical sensory gating\nAll participants were asked to abstain from consuming caffeine and smoking cigarettes for a minimum of 2\u2009h prior to completing the cortical sensory gating protocol, to avoid excitation of nicotinic receptors, which can temporarily improve sensory gating.\n37\n,\n38\nParticipants were seated comfortably in a sound attenuating booth, and instructed to ignore the test stimuli and watch a silent closed-captioned movie of their choice. A validated paired-click testing paradigm was used,\n25\u201327\nto target thalamocortical and auditory cortex responses. On each trial, two identical 10\u2009ms clicks were presented with an inter-stimulus interval of 500\u2009ms. The conditioning (first click) and test (second click) stimuli were presented binaurally at a level of 80\u2009dB C via ER3A insert earphones. A total of 200 trials (consisting of both a conditioning and a test click) were presented. ERP responses were obtained using a 64 channel cap (Electro-Cap International, Inc.; Eaton, OH) and the Compumedics Neuroscan System (Charlotte, NC). The ground electrode was located on the forehead, and Cz served as the reference electrode during recordings. Data were then re-referenced off line to an average reference of all electrodes. Horizontal and vertical eye movement was monitored with electrodes located inferiorly and at the outer canthi of both eyes. The recording time window consisted of a 200\u2009ms pre-stimulus baseline following by an 1100\u2009ms post-stimulus onset. Responses were analog low-pass filtered online at 100\u2009Hz (12\u2009dB/octave roll off), and all channels were amplified with a gain\u2009\u00d7\u200910 and converted using an analog-to-digital sampling rate of 1000\u2009Hz. Trials with eye blink artifacts were corrected off line using Neuroscan software. This blink reduction procedure calculates the amount of covariation between each active recording channel and a vertical eye channel using a spatial, singular value decomposition, and removes the vertical blink activity from each electrode on a point-by-point basis to the degree that the evoked response and blink activity co-varied. After blink correction, trials containing artifacts > \u00b170\u2009\u03bcV were rejected from averaging. For all individuals and conditions, \u226570% of the collected trials were available for averaging after artifact rejection. After artifact rejection, the remaining sweeps were averaged (an average of 178 sweeps per participant after artifact rejection and a minimum of 142 sweeps) and filtered off line.\nThe latencies and amplitudes of P1, N1, and P2 peaks were obtained from the central electrode Cz. For N1 and P2 peaks, offline bandpass filters from 0.1\u2009Hz (high-pass filter, 24\u2009dB/octave) to 30\u2009Hz (low-pass filter, 12\u2009dB/octave) were used to maximize cortical responses while reducing extraneous noise. P50 peaks were analyzed after applying a bandpass filter from 10 to 30\u2009Hz, because of the higher frequency content of thalamocortical responses.\n39\nPeak values were confirmed by comparing peaks at the Cz electrode location with peaks in the inverted waveforms measured at temporal electrode locations, as well as comparison with global field power traces for each individual, and grand averaged subject group responses. Amplitude values were measured relative to pre-stimulus baseline. Gating was defined as the reduction in peak amplitude from the conditioning (S1) to the test stimulus (S2) of a stimulus pair, and calculated as percent change in response amplitude [(S1amplitude-S2amplitude/S1amplitude)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100]. The change in amplitude between responses to conditioning and test stimuli is hereafter referred to as \u0394P1, \u0394N1, and \u0394P2, to denote changes in each peak.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis was completed using SPSS. Group differences for all test measures were assessed via one way ANOVA with \u03b1 set\na priori\nto\np\n<\u20090.05. Bivariate correlations were conducted using Kendall's tau-b to assess relationships among self-report, demographic, behavioral, and physiological test measures. Kendall's tau was used because it is independent of underlying distributions and because the resulting significance values are more accurate in small sample sizes than those of other non-parametric measures such as Spearman's rho.\n40\n,\n41\nIn light of the multiple comparisons necessary in the correlation analysis, we employed a Benjamani\u2013Hochberg correction to limit the false discovery rate to \u226410%. Last, stepwise multiple linear regression was used to determine which test variables were significant predictors of sensory gating indices and behavioral test performance."

    "Methods": "Subjects and pre-surgical procedures\nFifty-seven adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, Indiana) were paired in ventilated polycarbonate rat cages and maintained in a temperature-controlled (21\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) and light-controlled (on 0700-1900\u2009h) environment with food and water available\nad libitum.\nDuring the week of habituation, the rats were pre-trained on the motor task to ensure that they could balance on the beam for the allotted 60\u2009sec. On the morning of surgery, the rats were pre-assessed for beam-balance to determine baseline performance (\nFig. 1A\n). Following training the rats were randomly assigned to the following conditions, which included both TBI and respective sham controls: standard (STD) housing (TBI,\nn\n=\u200911; sham,\nn\n=\u20098), early + continuous EE (TBI,\nn\n=\u200911; sham,\nn\n=\u20098), and delayed + abbreviated EE (TBI,\nn\n=\u200911; sham,\nn\n=\u20098). All experimental procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the National Research Committee of the Mexican Social Security System (R-2014-784-057).

After endotracheal intubation, the rats were secured in a stereotaxic frame, ventilated mechanically, and temperature maintained at 37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C with a heating blanket. Adhering to aseptic protocol, a midline scalp incision was made, the skin and fascia were reflected to expose the skull, and a craniectomy was made in the right hemisphere (encompassing bregma and lambda and the sagittal and coronal sutures) with a hand-held trephine. The bone flap was removed and the craniectomy was enlarged further to ensure that penetration of the impact tip (6\u2009mm, flat) was unobstructed. Subsequently, the impacting rod was extended and the impact tip was centered and lowered through the craniectomy until it touched the dura mater; then, the rod was retracted and the impact tip was advanced 2.8\u2009mm farther to produce a brain injury of moderate severity (2.8\u2009mm tissue deformation at 4\u2009m/sec). Immediately after the CCI, anesthesia was discontinued and the incision was promptly sutured. The rats were subsequently extubated and assessed for acute neurological outcome. Sham-operated rats underwent similar surgical procedures, but were not subjected to the impact.\n\nAcute neurological evaluation\nHindlimb reflexive ability was assessed immediately following the cessation of anesthesia and removal from the stereotaxic apparatus by gently squeezing the rats' paw every 5\u2009sec and recording the time to elicit a withdrawal response. Return of the righting reflex was determined by the time required to turn from the supine to prone position. These sensitive neurological indices are used to determine the level of injury severity.\n15\u201318\n\nHousing conditions (environmental manipulation)\nAfter the effects of surgical anesthesia abated (as evidenced by spontaneous movement in the holding cage), the rats were placed in their assigned home environments. Specifically, one-third were immediately placed in the EE cages (i.e., early + continuous EE group). Briefly, the EE is a specifically designed three-tiered stainless steel-wire cage (91\u2009\u00d7\u200976\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009cm) with ladders to ambulate from one level to another and contains various toys (e.g., balls, blocks, and tubes), nesting materials (e.g., paper towels), and\nad libitum\nfood and water.\n14\u201318\nTo maintain novelty, the objects were rearranged every day and changed each time the cage was cleaned, which was twice per week. Ten to 12 rats, which included TBI and sham controls, were housed in the EE together to minimize variability among the groups. The remaining two-thirds were placed in typical laboratory shoebox cages (37\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2009\u00d7\u200918\u2009cm, two rats per cage; STD environment) with\nad libitum\nfood and water. Beginning at 9:00\nam\non post-injury Day 4, the rats randomized to the delayed + abbreviated EE condition (6\u2009h of EE) were removed from the STD cages and placed in the EE cages until 3:00\npm\n, at which time they were returned to STD housing. These rehabilitative manipulations occurred each day for 22 days.\n\nMotor performance\nThe well-established beam-balance test was utilized to assess motor function.\n15\u201318\n,\n43\nBriefly, the task consisted of placing the rat on an elevated narrow beam (1.5\u2009cm wide) and recording the time it remained on for a maximum of 60\u2009sec. Baseline performance was assessed 1\u2009h prior to surgery. Testing consisted of three trials (60\u2009sec allotted time with an inter-trial interval of 30\u2009sec) per day and was conducted on post-operative Days 1\u20135 for the STD and early + continuous EE groups and on Days 4\u20138 for the delayed + abbreviated EE groups. The average daily scores for each rat were used in the statistical analyses.\n\nCognitive function\nAcquisition of spatial learning\nSpatial learning was assessed in a Morris water maze (MWM) task that has been shown to be sensitive to cognitive function/dysfunction after TBI.\n15\n,\n19\n,\n44\u201347\nBriefly, the maze consisted of a plastic pool (180\u2009cm diameter; 60\u2009cm high) filled with tap water (26\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) to a depth of 28\u2009cm. The maze was in a room with salient visual cues that remained constant throughout the study. The platform was a clear Plexiglas stand (10\u2009cm diameter, 26\u2009cm high) that was positioned 26\u2009cm from the maze wall in the southwest quadrant and held constant for each rat. Training began on post-operative Day 14 for the STD and early + continuous EE groups and on Day 17 for the delayed + abbreviated EE groups. Assessment of spatial learning consisted of providing a block of four daily trials (4-min inter-trial interval) for 5 consecutive days to locate the platform when it was submerged 2\u2009cm below the water surface. On Day 19 for the STD and early + continuous EE groups and on Day 22 for the delayed + abbreviated groups the platform was made visible to the rats by raising it 2\u2009cm above the water surface as a control procedure to determine the contributions of non-spatial factors (e.g., sensory-motor performance, motivation, and visual acuity) on cognitive performance. For each daily block of trials, the rats were placed in the pool facing the wall at each of the four possible start locations (north, east, south, and west) in a randomized manner. Each trial lasted until the rat climbed onto the platform or until 120\u2009sec had elapsed, whichever occurred first. Rats that failed to locate the hidden platform within the allotted time were manually guided to it. All rats remained on the platform for 30\u2009sec before being placed in a heated incubator between trials. The times of the four daily trials for each rat were averaged and used in the statistical analyses.\n\nProbe trial\nOn Day 19 for the STD and early + continuous EE groups (TBI and sham) and on Day 22 for the delayed + abbreviated EE groups (TBI and sham), the rats were subjected to a probe trial to test their memory retention. Briefly, the platform was removed from the pool and the rat was provided a single 30-sec trial to swim freely. The percentage of time spent in the quadrant where the platform was situated during training (i.e., target quadrant) was recorded using ANY-maze video tracking software. Swim speed also was recorded during this testing period. The percent time spent in the target quadrant was used in the statistical analysis.\n\nBrdU administration\nTo determine whether EE affects learning-induced neurogenesis in the hippocampus, rats were injected for 3 days (12\u2009h apart) with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma-Aldrich 500\u2009mg/ kg; intraperitoneally) 10 days before sacrifice. Injections were conducted on Days 12\u201314 for the STD and early + continuous EE groups and on Days 15\u201317 for the delayed + abbreviated EE groups.\n\nHistology\nImmunostaining\nAfter completion of cognitive testing, the rats were anesthetized with Fatal-Plus\n\u00ae\n(0.25\u2009mL, intraperitoneally) and then perfused transcardially with 200\u2009mL 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buff6ered saline (pH 7.4), followed by 300\u2009mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were extracted, post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24\u2009h and cryoprotected in serial sucrose-phosphate-buffered saline solutions. To visualize BrdU+ and DCX+ cells, 40\u2009\u03bcm coronal sections were cut in a systematic random series and immunostained as previously described.\n48\nAll immunostaining and immunofluorescence procedures were performed on free-floating sections and all antibody incubations were carried out in a PBT solution (phosphate buffer +4% Triton X-100, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) containing 5% horse serum (GIBCO, Paisley, UK). After permeabilization (10\u2009min, PB +10% H\n2\nO\n2\n+ 4% Triton X-100), the sections were rinsed 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009(PB 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min), incubated for 2\u2009h in formamide (50% in SSC, Sigma-Aldrich) at 74\u00b0C, and washed for 5\u2009min in pre-heated SSC buffer. DNA denaturation was performed in HCl (1\u2009N) for 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. Sections were incubated for 10\u2009min in borate buffer (pH 8.4) and rinsed 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009in PB (3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min). For BrdU peroxidase immunostaining, we used mouse anti-BrdU immunoglobulin G (IgG; 1:5000; Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN) and for DCX goat anti-human doublecortin (1:3000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for 12\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. Brains were rinsed in PB (3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min), incubated for 2\u2009h in a biotinylated secondary goat anti-mouse IgG or guinea pig anti-goat (1:750; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), washed (PB 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min) and further incubated with the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex solution (5\u2009\u03bcL/mL in PBT, Vectastain Elite ABC kit; Vector Laboratories) for 90\u2009min. Immunostaining was visualized using a DAB staining kit for 10\u2009min (Vector Laboratories). Sections were mounted on gelatin coated slides, cover-slipped, and counter stained with hematoxilin-eosin (Vector laboratories).\nFor BrdU/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)/NeuN triple immunofluorescence, we used a mixture of primary rat anti-BrdU IgG (1:200; ABD; Serotec, Oxford, UK), rabbit anti-GFAP IgG (1:400; ABCAM, Cambridge, MA), and mouse anti-NeuN IgG (1:300; Millipore, Temecula, CA) overnight at room temperature. Sections were washed, incubated for 3\u2009h in a secondary donkey anti-rat IgG (1:300; Alexa 405; Jackson Immuno Research Labs, Pennsylvania, PA), goat anti-mouse IgG (1:300; Alexa 643; Jackson Immuno), and guinea pig anti-rabbit IgG (1:300; Alexa 488; Jackson Immuno), and mounted and cover-slipped with DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). For BrdU/NeuN/DCX triple immunofluorescence, sections were incubated with a mixture of primary rat anti-BrdU IgG (1:200; ABD Serotec, Oxford, UK) and mouse anti-NeuN IgG (1:300; Millipore) overnight at room temperature. Sections were washed, incubated for 3\u2009h in a secondary donkey anti-rat IgG (1:300; Alexa 405; Jackson Immuno) and goat anti-mouse IgG (1:300; Alexa 643; Jackson Immuno) and rinsed with PB. After visualization of BrdU and NeuN, sections were then incubated overnight in a mixture of two primary antibodies that detect different DCX epitopes, guinea pig anti-DCX (1:400; Millipore) and goat anti-DCX (1:200; Santa Cruz). Sections were incubated for 2\u2009h in a mixture of a secondary antibody biotinylated goat anti-guinea pig IgG and donkey anti-goat IgG (1:300; Vector Laboratories). This two-phase immunostaining procedure was done to ensure that no cross reactivity was observed between Alexa 643 goat anti-mouse fluorescent antibody used to visualize NeuN and donkey anti-goat biotinylated secondary used to visualize DCX. Brains were rinsed in PB (3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min) and incubated for 90\u2009min with the fluorescent avidin-FITC substrate kit (Vector laboratories), washed (3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min in PB), mounted and cover-slipped with DAKO mounting media (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Negative controls without primary antibodies were carried out for all immunostaining and immunofluorescence protocols. Negative controls for mouse and rat IgG cross reactivity were also performed to determine working dilutions.\n\nCell counting\nFor stereology, sections were evaluated as previously described.\n48\nBriefly, the series of brain sections (240-\u03bcm apart from one another) were used for generating stereological counts of BrdU+ nuclei along the extent of the hippocampus. The boundaries of the granular and subgranular zone (SGZ) of the DG were digitally outlined with the aid of image analysis software (axiovision 4.6; Karl Zeiss). Total cell number and density in the areas of interest were obtained from both the dorsal and ventral blades of the DG. DG volume was quantified according to the Cavalieri principle, where the volume is the sum of the areas of each 40\u2009\u03bcm section.\n48\n,\n49\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed on data collected by observers blinded to treatment conditions using Statview 5.0.1 software. The motor and cognitive data were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The acute neurological assessments, swim speed, visible platform performance, and immunostaining data, were analyzed by one-factor ANOVAs. When the overall ANOVAs revealed a significant effect, the Newman-Keuls post-hoc test was utilized to determine specific group differences. The data are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM) and are considered significant when corresponding\np\nvalues are \u22640.05."

Eligible patients were (1) between the ages of 16 and 80, (2) had a diagnosis of PCS as per the International Classification of Disease 10.0 criteria, (3) sustained the concussion greater than three months before the date of testing, (4) endorsed difficulties in tolerating computer screens (which we term computer screen intolerance), and (5) were proficient in English. Patients were ineligible if they did not have PCS, had a brain injury more severe than a concussion, or had another neurological, ocular, or psychiatric condition. Eligible participants were identified by the senior author (CHT).\n\nDevice\nTwo computer devices were used in this study: a 15.0\u201d LCD personal computer screen and a similar sized non-LCD computer (first generation) designed by Iris Technologies. This non-LCD screen is a separate monitor that attaches by USB to the LCD screen and mirrors the contents that are on the LCD display (\nFig. 1\n). It uses magnetized polymers to create shapes, as opposed to the light modulating liquid crystals on an LCD screen. This non-LCD screen is nonbacklit and does not constantly refresh the page the way an LCD screen flickers; instead, it refreshes only when the content on the screen is changed, and it refreshes at only 8\u201312 frames per second. This technology is similar to commercialized hand-held devices including the Kindle and Kobo e-readers.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nThe study devices. (\na\n) The non-liquid crystal display (LCD) device on the left and LCD device on the right demonstrating webpage data; (\nb\n) the non-LCD device on the left and the LCD device on the right demonstrating a reading task.\nThe resolution of the LCD screen was reduced to 1600\u2009\u00d7\u20091200 so that the effective screen area for both screens was the same. The screens differ in contrast; contrast refers to the difference between the darkest dark pixel and the brightest white pixel. It is expressed as a ratio. The contrast of a typical modern LCD screen is 1000:1, whereas the contrast was 12:1 in the non-LCD screen. Thus, the non-LCD screen has reduced contrast in comparison with the LCD screen, but has greater contrast than print media.\n\nProcedures\nAn outline of the study protocol is illustrated in\nFigure 2\n. Participants were required to make two visits, at least 24\u2009h apart. On each visit, they were asked to complete a silent reading task on one of the devices until any of their PCS symptoms were exacerbated, but only for a maximum of 30\u2009min. The order of the devices was randomized. The reading excerpt was designed by the study team using nonlicensed online material chosen from material written at the Grade 5 English level, at which all participants would be proficient.\n11\nThe excerpts were not from popular stories that participants may have been exposed to in the past. The content of the two reading tasks, one for each device, was different to avoid any practice effects.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nSummary of study protocol. CCC, Canadian Concussion Centre.\nThe symptom component of the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool 3 (SCAT3) was completed before and after the reading task to quantify the change in symptom number and severity attributed to the reading task. The SCAT3 is a validated clinical assessment protocol that lists 22 symptoms of concussion with a severity scale of 0\u20136 for each, and with a maximum score of 132; it is used widely in concussion assessment but does not yet have published normative data (SCAT3,\nhttp://links.lww.com/JSM/A30\n).\n1\nAfter completion of the reading task, participants were asked to complete a comprehension test of the material they read, but were only required to answer questions pertaining to the information they were able to read. At the end of the second visit, participants completed a self-reported questionnaire of their experience with the two devices. The questionnaire included both multiple choice and short answer feedback (\nAppendix A\n). Both interventions occurred in the same room, which had two incandescent light sources for background illumination; the latter is important because the LCD screen diminishes its brightness in the presence of a bright environment whereas the non-LCD screen reflects the ambient light. Therefore, we aimed to keep the effects of ambient lighting consistent between participants and study visits. Lastly, the devices were kept at a standard distance and inclination from the participant's seat.\nThe study personnel involved in administering the tasks were blinded to the patients' clinical information. Different members of the team conducted the data analysis to avoid any bias.\n\nData analysis\nVariables assessed:\n1.\nSymptoms: the symptom severity for each symptom listed in the SCAT3, the change in total symptom severity after the reading task, and the change in the number of symptoms endorsed after the reading task.\n2.\nReading: the number of words read, and the time spent reading.\n3.\nComprehension: the number of questions answered, and the percentage of questions answered correctly.\n4.\nSubjective experience: experience with the non-LCD screen using a Likert scale, aspects they liked about the non-LCD screen and areas of improvement, subjective symptom change with each device, and the commercial potential of the non-LCD device. These topics were addressed using a combination of Likert scale, multiple choice. and short-answer questions.\nThe change in symptom severity, change in number of symptoms, and change in specific symptoms with the LCD and non-LCD device were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. The reading time, number of words read, number of comprehension questions answered, number of comprehension questions answered correctly, and percent of comprehension questions answered correctly were analyzed by comparing the LCD screen directly to the non-LCD screen using the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed Rank Test. The change in number of symptoms and change in symptom severity were also analyzed by comparing the LCD screen directly to the non-LCD screen using the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed Rank Test.\nThe effect of gender on these outcome variables was assessed using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest whereas the implication of age, number of concussions, and time since diagnosis were assessed using Spearman correlations. The sample size was 29 subjects who varied in their clinical and demographic characteristics. Our goal was to determine the clinical utility of the non-LCD screen as a treatment option for screen intolerance, and therefore we were conservative with the statistical analysis and reported outcomes as significant at\np\n<\u20090.01.\nQualitative data were analyzed using grounded theory, whereby data were coded to devise common themes that inform theories."

    "Methods": "The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine approved the experiments used in this study. Inducible HMGB1 KO mice (n=\u200945) and age-matched WT littermate mice (n=\u200945) 16\u201320 weeks of age were allowedad libitumfood and water and were housed in controlled environmental conditions until the study began. Mice were apportioned to the two study protocols as described below (i.e., Study 1: assessment of markers of brain edema at 24\u2009h after injury, or Study 2: assessment of long-term behavioral and neuropathological outcomes over 21 days).\n\nGeneration of inducible global HMGB1 KO mice\nInducible global HMGB1 KO mice were generated because embryonic deletion was shown to be lethal shortly after birth,\n18\npreventing the\nin vivo\nfunctional study of the HMGB1 gene beyond this early age. The floxed HMGB1 mouse was generated as previously described.\n19\nThe targeted allele was designed to have two Lox/P elements inserted into introns 1 and 3. The flanking region of the two Lox/P elements includes exon 2, comprising the transcription initiation codon that covers most of the HMGB1 coding region. Before generating the chimeric mouse with the correct ES cell clones, the selection marker, Neo gene cassette, was removed by\nin vitro\nFRP recombination. Therefore, only two short Lox/P elements remained in the mouse genome. We confirmed that this modification of the genome did not affect HMGB1 gene expression.\nFigure 1\nillustrates the HMGB1 allele in wild type, floxed, and KO cells and shows the analysis of the floxed and KO mice. The strain used in this study was generated by introducing the inducible Cre transgene into HMGB1 floxed mice. The transgene is driven by a ubiquitously active CAG promoter and expresses a Cre and estrogen receptor fusion protein. This fusion protein changes its configuration upon binding to estrogen or an estrogen analog such as tamoxifen (TM) and translocates into the cell nucleus to excise the floxed gene. We confirmed that HMGB1 expression was intact in the inducible global HMGB1 KO mouse until TM administration. TM was administered to the mice by intraperitoneal injection and complete absence of HMGB1 protein expression in murine brain extracts was confirmed 6\u20137 weeks after TM administration. An identical approach was taken for the na\u00efve mice assessed in the behavioral studies (see below). Although HMGB1 deletion in young mice (less than 3 weeks old) leads to death, deletion in young adult mice (6 weeks of age or older) was well tolerated.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nThe mouse high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) gene loci for wild type, floxed, and knockout (KO) mice are shown. The HMGB1 protein is encoded by four exons and starts from exon 2. Lox/P sequences were placed in introns 1 and 3; therefore, Cre-mediated recombination deleted exons 2 and 3, including the initiation codon (ATG). The floxed HMGB1 mouse strain was established to produce a global, inducible HMGB1 KO mouse.\n\nControlled cortical impact model of TBI\nAll experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh. TBI was performed using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model in mice as previously described\n20\u201322\nwith minor modifications. Briefly, male mice (12 weeks of age) were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane (in 2:1 O\n2\n/N\n2\nO) for induction and then with 1\u20132% isoflurane throughout the surgical procedure via a nose cone. Animals were positioned in a stereotaxic frame, and a needle electrode (Physitemp Instruments [MT-29/1HT], Clifton, NJ) was inserted into the temporalis muscle ipsilateral to the injury to monitor brain temperature.\n23\nA 5-mm craniotomy was performed over the left parietal cortex, the bone flap removed, and brain temperature was maintained at 37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C for 5\u2009min to confirm normothermia at the time of TBI. Body temperature also was monitored by a rectal probe (Physitemp Instruments, Clifton, NJ). Mice were then subjected to vertically directed CCI using a pneumatic cylinder with a 3-mm tip impounder at a velocity of 5\u2009m/sec and a depth of 1.2\u2009mm producing a moderate-severe level of injury with appreciable loss of CA1 hippocampal neurons and no mortality. This model was utilized for studies of brain edema and BBB permeability, and a severe CCI model (velocity 6\u2009m/sec and a depth of 1.8\u2009mm) was used for long-term outcome studies. Immediately after the injury, the bone flap was replaced, sealed with dental cement (Vernon Benshoff, Albany, NY), and the wound sutured closed. Sensorcaine was (0.25%) was applied topically to each wound site. Isoflurane was discontinued, and the mice were placed in an oxygen hood for 30\u2009min, after which they were returned to their cages.\n\nStudy 1: Assessment of brain edema and BBB permeability over the initial 24\u2009h after CCI\nAssessment of brain edema\nA total of 10 mice (\nn\n=\u20095 per genotype) were recovered after CCI, returned to their cages and then sacrificed at 24\u2009h euthanized with isoflurane followed by decapitation and their brains were immediately removed and bisected into left and right hemispheres. Each hemisphere was immediately weighed (wet weight). Hemispheres were then placed in an oven, dehydrated at 110\u00b0C for 72\u2009h, and re-weighed (dry weight). To quantify brain edema after TBI, percent brain water (%BW) content of injured and contralateral hemispheres was determined by the wet\u2013dry weight method.\nAssessment of BBB permeability\nIn separate mice, at 4\u2009h after CCI (\nn\n=\u200910 per genotype) mice were re-anesthetized with isoflurane in oxygen, a femoral venous catheter was surgically placed, and Evans Blue (a 2% solution, 2.5\u2009mL/kg, intravenous) was injected. After allowing the mice to recover for an additional 20\u2009h after injection, they were anesthetized with isoflurane in oxygen followed by perfusion with ice cold heparinized normal saline. The brains were immediately removed and bisected into left and right hemispheres. Each hemisphere was immediately weighed. Subsequently, the hemispheres were extracted with 3\u2009mL of N,N-dimethyl formamide at room temperature for 3 days to allow spectrophotometric quantification (at 620\u2009nm) of the amount of Evans Blue in the tissue which reflects the extent of BBB permeability to albumin as previously described.\n24\nBBB permeability was quantified in injured (left) and non-injured (right) brain hemispheres as micrograms of Evans Blue per gram of brain.\n\nStudy 2: Assessment of long-term behavioral and neuropathological outcomes over 21 days\nA total of 40 mice were studied in this protocol. To determine if motor or cognitive performance was altered in HMGB1 KO mice versus WT, we evaluated the performance of both na\u00efve and injured mice on these behavioral tasks. Mice were thus randomly divided into four groups WT (na\u00efve), HMGB1 KO (na\u00efve), WT (CCI) and HMGB1 KO (CCI),\nn\n=\u200910 per group, respectively.\nAssessment of motor function and Morris water maze (MWM) performance\nAnalysis of motor function and MWM spatial memory acquisition was performed as previously described.\n21\n,\n24\nFor mice subjected to CCI, WT and inducible global HMGB1 KO mice underwent surgery at 6\u20137 weeks after administration of TM, following the CCI injury protocol exactly as described above (\nn\n=\u200910 in each group). For na\u00efve animals, testing of WT and KO in the behavioral protocols (as described below) temporally matched the approach taken for the CCI groups relative to TM dosing. Motor function was assessed at Days 1\u20135 after injury using a beam balance task, with mice trained on Day 0 (pre-injury). Spatial memory acquisition was assessed using the MWM hidden platform task on Days 14\u201318 followed by probe trial. Performance in the MWM was quantified by measuring latency in finding the platform and the probe trial was quantified as percent time in the target quadrant. Visible platform testing was then performed on Days 19\u201320 after TBI to confirm that latencies were not confounded by visual impairments. Mice whose 20-day visible platform scores were greater than two standard deviations greater than the sham group (2-day average) were deemed to exhibit visual impairment and were removed from the study.\nAssessment of lesion volume and hemispheric tissue loss\nTo assess lesion volume and hemispheric tissue loss, mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and brains perfused with 50\u2009mL of 0.9% NaCl, followed by 50\u2009mL of 10% buffered formalin solution via the left ventricle 21 days after TBI (\nn\n=\u200910 per group). Brains were removed and coronal brain sections (10\u2009\u03bcm) were cut on a cryostat at 0.5-mm intervals and mounted on Superfrost (Fisher Scientific) slides. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Contralateral and remaining ipsilateral hemispheric areas were measured using an image analysis system (MCID Imaging Research, St. Catharines, ON). Volumes were calculated by multiplying slice area\u2009\u00d7\u2009slice interval thickness and adding together all slices. Lesion volume was then quantified both in mm\n3\nand as a percent of the contralateral hemisphere as previously described.\nAssessment of hippocampal neuronal survival\nTo assess the role of HMGB1 in neuronal death in the selectively vulnerable dorsal hippocampus ipsilateral to CCI, separate mice (\nn\n=\u200910 per genotype) were subjected to CCI (5\u2009m/sec velocity, 1.2\u2009mm depth) and recovered exactly as previously described. At 24\u2009h after injury, mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane, and brains perfused with 50\u2009mL of 0.9% NaCl, followed by 50\u2009mL of 10% buffered formalin solution via the left ventricle. Brains were blocked through the hippocampus at the center of the lesion and embedded in paraffin. Section measuring 5\u2009\u03bcM were cut in the center of the contusion on a microtome and stained with H&E. One section was analyzed per animal and the number of surviving hippocampal neurons in CA1 and CA3 regions were counted in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres as previously described.\n20\nResults are reported as surviving neurons/0.1\u2009mm. Only neurons with visible nuclei were counted; shrunken or pyknotic cells were excluded from cell counts.\nWestern blot analysis\nBrain tissue was homogenized using 500\u2009\u03bcL of lysis buffer (0.1M sodium chloride, 0.01M Tris-Cl pH 7.6, 0.01M EDTA, protease inhibitors, and PMSF). Protein concentrations were analyzed using the BCA assay. Samples were prepared in Laemmli loading buffer and were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK), and blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk in PBS for 1\u2009h. Primary polyclonal mouse HMGB1 antibody (1:500; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and \u03b2-actin (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich) were used for Western blot. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% Tween 20 (PBST), secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G; Sigma-Aldrich) was applied at 1:10,000 dilution for 1\u2009h. Blots were washed in PBST thrice for 10\u2009min, incubated in Enhanced Chemiluminescence Reagent (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK), and used to expose x-ray film (GE Healthcare).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. One-way analysis of variance followed by the\npost hoc\nStudent-Newman-Keuls test was used to determine the differences among multiple groups. The Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest was applied on small-size comparisons with non-normal distributions between groups. The\nt\ntest was applied only on experiments with normal distributions between the comparison groups. A\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "This study examines 35 patients with mild TBI (GCS 13-15) enrolled in a larger (n=\u200960) prospective, observational parent study (National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Nursing Research, 1P30-NR014139; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 71244). It was performed in a single, large academic medical center in the U.S. It was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board, and patients were enrolled after obtaining parental consent. Patients enrolled (2012\u20132015) in the parent study included children ages 10 days to 15 years admitted to the hospital for a TBI (mild, moderate, and severe) as a result of accidental or abusive head trauma. All children had to both be previously healthy and have no history of developmental delay. All injuries were isolated head trauma, and had no previous history of TBI. Both English- and Spanish-speaking families were enrolled.\n\nInclusion criteria for the 35 children in the subgroup analysis were GCS score 13\u201315, availability of bilateral middle cerebral artery flow velocity measurements, and a neurocognitive outcome score using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended, Pediatrics (GOS-E Peds). The GOS-E Peds score was captured at hospital discharge and at 4\u20136 weeks post-hospital discharge. Patients determined to have an abusive head injury were excluded because of the challenge to determine time of injury, potential for multiple episodes of injury prior to presentation, and other potential historical confounders.\n\nTranscranial Doppler ultrasound was performed within 24\u2009h of admission to the hospital. All patients received standard care, and all patient providers were blinded to the TCD findings. Head CT scans were performed to determine location and type of injury on all patients, although this was not requisite for study inclusion.\n\nTranscranial Doppler ultrasound\nTCD is a non-invasive portable ultrasound modality. The advantages of TCD include ease of use, reproducibility, absence of radiation exposure, availability at bedside, real-time results and relatively low cost. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound utilizes a low-frequency (2-MHz) transducer on the surface of the scalp to measure blood flow velocities within the circle of Willis using four common transcranial acoustic windows (temporal, transforaminal, transorbital, and submandibular). We report data from the M1/M2 sections of bilateral middle cerebral arteries obtained through the temporal acoustic window. Data obtained is reported as mean flow velocity (MV), peak flow velocity (PV), and end diastolic flow velocity (EDV). In addition, a pulsatility index (PI) was calculated on both left and right sides. PI is derived from the difference in the PV and EDV divided by MV (PV - EDV/MV).\n27\nThe pulsatility index represents a measure of cerebral vascular reactivity; values greater than 1.3 have been independently correlated with poor neurofunctional outcome.\n28\n,\n29\n\nGOS-Extended, Peds\nFunctional outcomes were measured using the GOS-E Peds score at the time of hospital discharge and at a 6 weeks post-discharge follow-up visit. The GOS-E Peds instrument is designed to be developmentally appropriate for children younger than 17 years of age, and was validated in a trial of 159 patients. The Glasgow Outcome Scale scores from a range of 1 to 8, with lower scores indicating a better functional outcome. The eight categories are as follows:1\u2009=\u2009Upper Good Recovery (performs all age-appropriate activities as before); 2\u2009=\u2009Lower Good Recovery (normal activities with mild impairment in social activities or family relationships); 3\u2009=\u2009Upper Moderate Disability (reduced capacity for school work and moderate impairment in social activities and family relationships); 4\u2009=\u2009Lower Moderate Disability (assistance of another person at home is essential for most, but not all, activities of everyday living or child's ability to interact outside the home is impaired as expected for age); 5\u2009=\u2009Upper Severe Disability (requires sheltered work or school environment, or is unable to attend school and unable to participate in social activities or has daily severe disruptions in family relationships); 6\u2009=\u2009Lower Severe Disability (assistance of another person at home is essential for all activities of everyday living as expected for age); 7\u2009=\u2009Vegetative State (unable to follow simple commands or interact beyond reflexes) and; 8\u2009=\u2009Death. Scores from 1 to 3 are most often described as a \u201cgood outcome\u201d whereas scores 4 to 8 as a \u201cpoor outcome\u201d.\n30\n\nStatistical analysis\nAnalyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics summarized participant characteristics. Correlations of the standardized cerebral flow velocities and pulsatility index with GOS-E Peds score were evaluated using Spearman correlation coefficients as GOS-E Peds is measured on an ordinal scale. Because our sample's cerebral flow velocities in each level of gender and location of injury are not normally distributed with a small sample size, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were carried out to assess the relationship of gender and location of injury with cerebral flow velocities. Paired\nt\n-tests were used to assess the difference between left- and right-side cerebral flow velocities. Power analysis was conducted using the SAS power procedure for estimating power of a Pearson's correlation based on a two-sided hypothesis test with a significance level of 0.05.\nAnalysis was performed using the highest mean flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery. Left and right sides were analyzed separately. Values were normalized for age and gender based on published means and standard deviations.\n24\nThe highest measured pulsatility index value was used for analysis."

    "Methods": "Animal model of TBI\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Henry Ford Health System. All functional tests and spine analyses were performed by investigators blinded to the treatment status.\nMale Wistar rats weighing 305\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u2009g (2\u20133 months old, Charles River Breeding Company, Wilmington, MA) were employed in our experiments. A controlled cortical impact (CCI) rat model of TBI was utilized to induce moderate focal brain injury (contusion). The moderate CCI-TBI we used is one of the most widely used TBI models with high reproducibility. It causes both cortical lesion and subcortical injury including the hippocampus that lead to sensorimotor and cognitive deficits, which can last up to one year after TBI compared with age-match sham rats as demonstrated by us and other investigators.\n19\u201321\nBriefly, each rat was anesthetized with IP ketamine/xylazine (100/10\u2009mg/kg). Rectal temperature was maintained at 37\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u00b0C using a feedback-regulated water-heating pad. Rats were placed in a stereotactic frame. Two 10-mm-diameter craniotomies were performed adjacent to the central suture, midway between lambda and bregma. The second craniotomy allowed for lateral movement of cortical tissue. The dura mater was kept intact over the cortex. Cortical injury was delivered by impacting the left cortex (ipsilateral cortex) with a pneumatic piston containing a 6-mm\u2013diameter tip at a rate of 4\u2009m/sec and 2.5\u2009mm of compression. CCI corresponding to moderate TBI was performed in male Wistar rats.\n22-\u201325\nThe moderate CCI-TBI model employed in this study is one of the most widely used clinically relevant animal models of focal TBI.\n25\u201327\nThis model causes not only cortical injury but also selective neuronal death in the hippocampus in rats, leading to sensorimotor dysfunction and spatial learning and memory deficits, respectively.\n19\n,\n28\u201334\n\nSPG101 treatment (35-day study)\nAnimals with TBI were randomly divided into one of the two groups: (1) TBI + Vehicle at 1\u2009h (\nn\n=\u20097), and (2) TBI + SPG101 (30\u2009mg/kg) at 1\u2009h (\nn\n=\u20097). SPG101 was administered IP to rats once daily for the next 34 days, starting at 1\u2009h after TBI, at a dose of 30\u2009mg/kg. To date, the optimal dose and time of SPG101 have not been identified for treatment of rats with TBI. This dosing protocol is based on previous studies in wild-type mice\n17\nand in a mouse model of AD\n16\nbecause SPG101 at 30\u2009mg/kg daily IP for two weeks has been demonstrated to have pronounced effects on increasing dendritic spine density and improving cognitive performance in wild-type mice and AD mice.\n16\n,\n17\nAnimals treated with vehicle (1% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] in phosphate buffered saline [PBS]) were used as a control group. SPG101 was supplied by Spinogenix, which provided funding for this study.\n\nEvaluation of neurological outcome\nPrimary end-points include the following battery of behavioral and neurological tests: sensorimotor tests (foot fault, modified Neurological Severity Score-mNSS, and adhesive patch removal),\n14\n,\n35\n,\n36\nand cognitive tests (the Morris water maze [MWM], Novel Object Recognition [NOR], and Three-Chamber Social Interaction).\n14\n,\n37\n,\n38\nAll personnel were blinded to the treatment groups for tests. Animal behavioral outcomes were compared between the two groups. Secondary end-points were the effects of SPG101 on dendritic spine density and morphology measured using ballistic dye labeling technique.\n39\n\nSensorimotor tests\nFoot fault test\nTo evaluate sensorimotor function, the foot fault test was performed before TBI and at one, seven, 14, 21, and 35 days after TBI. The rats were allowed to walk on a grid. With each weight-bearing step, a paw might fall or slip between the wires and, if this occurred, it was recorded as a foot fault. A total of 50 steps were recorded for the right forelimb and hindlimb.\n14\nmNSS test\nTo investigate neurological functional outcome, the mNSS test was performed. The test was carried out on rats pre-injury and at one, seven, 14, 21, and 35 days after TBI. mNSS is a composite of the motor (muscle status, abnormal movement), sensory (visual, tactile, and proprioceptive), and reflex tests and has been used in previous TBI studies.\n14\nNeurological function was graded on a scale of 0 to 18 (normal score 0; maximal deficit score 18). One point is awarded for each abnormal behavior or for lack of a tested reflex; thus, the higher the score, the more severe the injury.\n14\nAdhesive patch removal test\nBriefly, two pieces of adhesive-backed paper (113.1\u2009mm\n2\n) were used as bilateral tactile stimuli occupying the distal-radial region on the wrist of each forelimb.\n36\nEach animal received three trials per testing day, and the mean time (seconds) required to remove stimuli from the right forelimb was recorded. The average of three trials was used for statistical analysis. The test was performed on the rat pre-injury and at one, seven, 14, 21, and 35 days after TBI.\n\nCognitive tests\nMWM test\nThe modified MWM test was used for assessment of spatial learning function, as described previously.\n24\n,\n40\nThis test was performed daily for five days in all rats at one month (days 31\u201335 after injury). Briefly, the experimental apparatus consists of a circular water tank (180\u2009cm in diameter) that is placed in a large test room with many external cues (e.g., pictures, lamps, camera, etc.) visible to the rats. A transparent platform (10\u2009cm in diameter) is submerged 2\u2009cm below the surface of the water at a random location within the northeast (correct) quadrant of the maze.\nFor each trial, the rat was placed randomly at one of four fixed starting points (north, south, east, and west) and allowed to swim for a maximum of 90\u2009sec. If the animals did not locate the platform within 90\u2009sec, they were guided gently to it by the experimenter. All animals were allowed to remain on the platform for 10\u2009sec before being removed from the tank. The swim speed, latency to find the hidden platform, and the time spent within the correct quadrant were recorded. Data are presented as the percentage of time spent within the correct quadrant relative to the total amount of time spent to find the hidden platform.\nNOR test\nThe NOR task is a well-characterized behavioral measure of hippocampally based working nonspatial visual recognition memory in rodents.\n41\nNOR task has been used to evaluate cognition, particularly recognition memory, in rodent models of central nervous system disorders. This test is based on the spontaneous tendency of rodents to spend more time exploring a novel object than a familiar one. The choice to explore the novel object reflects the use of learning and recognition memory. Given the more subtle nature of the histological damage, it is likely that traditional behavioral tasks used for TBI models may lack the sensitivity to detect deficits after a mild injury. The hippocampus and the perirhinal cortex play different roles in object recognition memory.\nThe NOR test is a simple method that does not need external motivation reward or punishment; however, a little training or habituation is required. It can be completed in a short time so animals are not stressed, and it can assess the recognition memory after only one trial, which gives it an advantage over other methods.\n42\nThis test was performed on all rats at 14 days and 35 days after injury.\nBriefly, rats were habituated individually to an open field Plexiglas arena (50\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009cm) for a period of 3\u2009min. Twenty-four hours later, in the acquisition phase, two identical objects (A and B) were placed in a symmetrical position within the arena. The objects are sufficiently large to ensure that the rat could neither move nor climb over them. The memory recognition assessment was performed 4 hours later after the acquisition test. Thereafter, one of the objects (A or B) was replaced randomly by a novel one (C), and the rat exploratory behavior was analyzed over a 3\u2009min period. Exploration of an object was defined as rearing on the object, sniffing it at a distance of less than 2\u2009cm, and/or touching it with the nose.\nSuccessful recognition was represented by preferential exploration of the novel object over the familiar object. The time spent by each rat exploring the novel object over the familiar object was recorded and used to generate a preference index. A discrimination preference index was calculated as the following: time spent near the new object minus time spent near the old object)/(time spent near the new object plus time spent near the old object).\n37\nAfter each session, the objects and arena were cleaned thoroughly with 70% ethanol to prevent odor recognition.\nThree-chamber social interaction test\nThis test is used to assess memory for interactions with novel conspecifics.\n43\n,\n44\nRats tend to spend more time interacting with a rat over an object (sociability) or a novel rat versus one they have encountered previously (social novelty). The three chamber test can help identify rodents with deficits in sociability and/or social novelty.\n43\nDecreased duration and/or number of contacts may be associated with depressive- and/or anxiety-like behavior,\n45\nwhich are common after TBI, especially after mild TBI or in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n46\nThis test was performed on all rats at 14 days and 35 days after injury.\nThe test rat was placed in the central compartment (20\u2009\u00d7\u200935\u2009\u00d7\u200935\u2009cm) and remained there for a 2-min habituation period. Thereafter, retractable doors were removed, and the rat explored the left and right compartment (30\u2009\u00d7\u200935\u2009\u00d7\u200935\u2009cm) for 5\u2009min. After 5-min habituation, the left and right compartments were equipped with a cylinder (15\u2009cm in diameter, 35\u2009cm high) that contains either an unfamiliar rat or an unfamiliar object (empty container). The cylinders are perforated with holes (0.5\u2009cm) to allow olfactory and nose-to-nose contact. The time spent by the test rat sniffing either the rat (social target) or the novel object (inanimate target) was recorded manually from videotapes by an experimenter who is blinded to the treatment groups. Then, an unfamiliar rat was placed in the empty cylinder (social novelty). The time spent by the test rat sniffing either the new rat (social novel target) or the old rat (social familiar target) was recorded manually.\nA discrimination preference index was calculated as the following: (time spent near the new rat minus time spent near the old rat)/(time spent near the new rat plus time spent near the rat object).\n37\nAfter each session, the arena was cleaned thoroughly with 70% ethanol to prevent odor recognition.\n\nEvaluations of dendritic spine morphology\nAnimals\nBrains were fixed following methods developed by Afraxis.\n47\nBriefly, rats were anesthetized with IP ketamine/xylazine (100/10\u2009mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Whole brains were removed and post-fixed in the same fixative. All brain tissue was stored in 0.1\u2009M PBS at 4\u00b0C. Within three days, brains were sectioned using a tissue vibratome (Leica VT1000) to collect sections (300\u2009\u03bcm thick) from the anterior to posterior extremes of each brain.\nBallistic dye labeling and microscopy\nBallistic dye labeling (DiI and DiO) was performed according to protocols developed by Afraxis (San Diego, CA) to label target neurons, as described previously.\n48\nSections were slide mounted and cover slipped using ProLong Gold Mountant (ThermoFisher Scientific). Super-resolution laser-scanning confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM880, Airyscan)\n49\nwas performed using a 63X objective (1.42 NA) to individually scan labeled neurons at high resolution (scan resolution\u2009=\u20090.06\u2009\u03bcm/pixel; axial resolution\u2009=\u20090.06\u2009\u03bcm/focal step). Target neurons were identified in the brain region of interest by epifluorescence navigation using anatomical location and cell morphology. Microscopy was performed blind to experimental conditions. A minimum of five rats was tested in each experimental condition. A minimum of five samples per rat (range\u2009=\u20095\u201312) was measured for each segment.\nAfraxis enhanced spine profiling (ESP) dendritic spine analysis and assessment of dendritic membrane integrity\nAiryscan post-processing (ZEN 2.3, Zeiss) was applied to raw three-dimensional digital micrographs followed by analysis for spine density and morphology by trained analysts. Individual spines were measured manually for (a) head diameter, (b) length, and (c) neck diameter from image Z-stacks using custom-built Afraxis ESP software. Each dendrite was analyzed by three (on average) independent analysts. Automated image assignment software distributed images to analysts in a randomized manner and ensured that each analyst performed measurements of near equal numbers of dendrites per group. Analysts were blinded to all experimental conditions (including treatment, brain region, and cell type). Statistical analysis of interanalyst variability for each dendrite was examined on line and used to eliminate dendrites that did not meet interanalyst reliability criteria: for spine density and spine morphological classification, data across analysts were averaged to report data for each dendrite.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are presented as the means with standard error of the mean. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by\npost hoc\nBonferroni tests was used for repeated measurements of cognitive and sensorimotor function to compare the difference between the SPG101-treated and DMSO-treated groups. Independent samples\nt\ntest was used for NOR and three chamber tests between two groups (DMSO versus SPG101). For evaluations of total spine density, statistical significance was determined using the ANOVA test (SPSS), and spine morphological classes were evaluated by multi-variate (M) ANOVA. Treatment groups expressed normally distributed values (Shapiro-Wilk test,\np\n>\u20090.05), and homogeneity of variances was not significant for any comparison (Levene statistic,\np\n>\u20090.4; Box test of equality of co-variances,\np\n>\u20090.3). Non-parametric comparisons of individual measure population distributions were conducted using the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test.\nConsidering the sensitivity of pooled-population non-parametric statistics, we applied a conservative hypothesis test (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.0001). All experimenters were fully blinded to treatment conditions during the collection, assembly, and interpretation of the data."

    "Methods": "Patient population\nPatients were children from birth to <31 months of age recruited from two level 1 pediatric trauma centers: Primary Children's Hospital (PCH) in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth)/Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital. These children are a subset of a larger cohort of children recruited up to age 15 years.\n23\nThis young age group is reported separately to allow similar developmental outcome measures and represent children eligible for early childhood intervention (ECI) services. Children were recruited from January 2013 through September 2015 if they had sustained either a TBI or an orthopedic injury (OI). Abusive head trauma (AHT) is included in the TBI group. English- and Spanish-speaking children and families were recruited and asked for consent in person while in the ED or hospital or were contacted by telephone after review of ED logs (UTHealth) and returned consent forms by mail. Children with severe developmental delay, psychiatric diagnoses, or very pre-term birth (<32 weeks) that would preclude understanding whether changes in development could be attributed to the injury were excluded. Institutional review board approval was obtained from both the University of Utah and UTHealth.\n\nDefinitions\nTBI group\nTBI was defined according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2002 report as an injury to the head with observed or reported decreased level of consciousness, amnesia, and/or neuropsychological abnormality or diagnosed intracranial lesion.\n24\nFor children <2 years of age, neuropsychological abnormality included irritability, vomiting, or lethargy. TBI severity was measured using the lowest ED pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)\n25\nand was divided into mild, moderate, and severe categories. Mild TBI was defined according to CDC and World Health Organization definitions as a GCS \u226513 upon presentation to healthcare with a GCS of 15 at discharge or after 24\u2009h if hospitalized, and one or more focal signs including a period of transient confusion, loss of consciousness for 30\u2009min or less, and/or transient neurological abnormalities.\n26\n,\n27\nMild TBI was subclassified as complicated mild based on the presence of an intracranial hemorrhage diagnosed on computed tomography (CT) scan.\n28\nChildren with skull fracture and no underlying parenchymal hemorrhage were classified as mild TBI. Moderate TBI was categorized as a GCS of 9\u201312. Severe TBI was categorized as a GCS of 3\u20138. For children who had received heavy sedation and/or muscle relaxants precluding evaluation, a score of 3T was assigned. Abusive injury was categorized by each institution's child abuse team. Child abuse team consultation notes were reviewed both at the time of injury and after the medical workup was completed. Injury mechanism was adjudicated by the investigators if no conclusion was reported in the medical record.\nComparison group\nChildren with an upper or lower-extremity long-bone fracture and no evidence of TBI were recruited contemporaneously with the TBI group. OI comparisons isolate the effect of TBI from the effect of being injured and account for unmeasured pre-injury differences between injured versus uninjured children. Injury severity was measured with the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS).\n29\nTo insure even distribution of children with OI and different levels of TBI severity, families were recruited sequentially until the target number was attained for each subgroup.\n\nData sources\nParents retrospectively completed surveys of family demographics, family functioning and social support, and child outcomes as soon as possible after injury. Demographic information included family composition, self-identified race and ethnicity, income category, parental education, employment, and health insurance status. Parents were asked to recall their child's pre-injury functioning right before injury. Follow-up assessments were collected at 3 and 12 months. English-speaking families completed assessments in person, online, or by telephone. Bilingual study coordinators interviewed Spanish-speaking families in person or by telephone.\nMedical records were abstracted for clinical and injury mechanism data by trained study coordinators using standardized data abstraction forms. A hierarchy of sources was established before data abstraction for cases in which multiple people recorded information in the medical record. The hierarchy was as follows: trauma surgeon, ED attending, trauma fellow, ED fellow, nurse, and resident. Trauma registrars assigned AIS scores. CT scans were performed at the treating clinician's discretion and were read by pediatric neuroradiologists at each site.\n\nMeasures\nOutcomes\nAges & Stages Questionnaire-3 (ASQ-3) assesses communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem-solving, and personal-social skills in children ages 1\u201360 months. Higher scores indicate more-advanced development. Children are categorized as appropriate, need to monitor (\u22651 standard deviation [SD] and <2 SDs below the mean), and need to assess (\u22652 SDs below the mean corresponding to \u22642nd percentile).\n30\nAges & Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE) measures seven developmental and behavioral characteristics, including self-regulation, compliance, communication, adaptive functioning, autonomy, affect, and interaction with others in ages 3\u201366 months.\n31\nASQ:SE is scored against an age-normed risk threshold. Higher scores indicate more problems. Sensitivity and specificity are favorable for identifying children who need evaluation for the ASQ (0.86 and 0.85) and ASQ:SE (0.81 and 0.83). ASQ and ASQ:SE are parent-reported measures available in both English and Spanish.\n32\nSpecifically in the 2- to 12-month age range, ASQ is 91.3% accurate at correctly identifying children not at risk for developmental delay and 84.6% accurate at correctly identifying children at risk for developmental delay when compared to the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Test-test reliability is good for parent report (0.91) as is inter-rater reliability (0.92).\n30\nThe Spanish language version of ASQ-3 is validated.\n33\nFamily environment covariates\nPre-injury family function was assessed over the past 6 months using the McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD)\u2013General Functioning Scale.\n34\nFAD includes 12 items scored 1\u20134, with higher scores representing worse functioning. The Social Capital Index provides a total score measuring a person's connection to their community, including perceptions of personal, family, neighborhood, and spiritual community support, with higher scores representing more support.\n35\nFamily income relative to federal poverty level was calculated using self-reported income category and family size. Families reported receipt of ECI at 3 and 12 months.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll children with evaluable outcomes pre-injury and either the 3- or 12-month time point were included in the analysis. Because of small numbers of children with moderate TBI, the moderate and complicated-mild groups were combined for modeling based on previous studies showing similar outcomes.\n28\nGeneralized linear mixed models, with a subject-level random effect, and allowing for different residual variances for each time point, were fit for each outcome using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) and the gls function from the nlme package.\n36\n,\n37\nOur strategy was to develop an explanatory multi-variate model for each outcome that addressed the hypotheses that earlier age at injury and higher injury severity would lead to worse outcomes. Additionally, we wished to identify other variables potentially important to very young children's outcomes that had been identified in studies of older children.\nWe used the following approach to construct multi-variable models for each outcome. First, we created a reference model that included\na priori\nidentified covariates to address our hypotheses. Theses covariates included the following: injury group (OI reference), time post-injury (centered at 12 months), and age at injury (continuous, centered at mean); clinical covariates known to affect outcome in very young children (pre-maturity and abusive injury); and covariates needed because of the study structure (study site and pre-injury scores). All two- and three-way interactions among injury group, time post-injury, and age at injury with likelihood ratio\np\nvalue <0.15 were also included in the reference model for that outcome. Because sample size was not adequate to include all potentially relevant covariates, candidate covariates selected\na priori\nthat have been important to studies of older children were individually screened for inclusion using the reference model. These covariates included child demographics: sex, race/ethnicity, and previous diagnosis of health or behavioral problem; family demographics: income relative to poverty level, parent education, parent employment, parent marital status, and parent preferred language; and family functioning and Social Capital Index. Candidate covariates were retained if\np\n<\u20090.15. Finally, in order to achieve a parsimonious model, a \u201cfull model\u201d including all reference model variables and candidate covariates from the screening step was iteratively reduced by removal of covariates with\np\n>\u20090.1. Reference model variables were retained in the final model regardless of significance. Statistical significance was evaluated at the 0.05 level. All tests were two-tailed. Finally, we created figures displaying interaction terms using categorized age and time for ease of interpretation."

    "Methods": "Protocols general to all experimental phases\nThe experimental optimization of this model was carried out in three phases. The purpose of Experimental Phase 1 was to test the implementation of the insults and the survivability of the combinations of injuries and insults in escalating doses. The purpose of Experimental Phase 2 was to determine the effect of potentially synergistic combinations of sub-lethal injuries and insults on the pattern of brain pathology. The purpose of Experimental Phase 3 was to further refine the model to restrict damage to the hemisphere under the SDH with the injuries and insults scaled to age to develop a model that can test the effects of age on injury pattern in future experiments.

A total of 48 piglets (Experimental Phase 1,\nn\n=\u20098; Experimental Phase 2,\nn\n=\u200925; Experimental Phase 3,\nn\n=\u200915) were used to develop this model in three experimental phases. Injuries were scaled to PND 7, similar to human infants, and PND 21\u201330, which are similar to human toddlers (described in detail previously).\n22\n,\n26\nAll protocols and procedures were in accordance with the guidelines of the American Veterinary Association and the National Institutes of Health, and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Dartmouth College or Massachusetts General Hospital.\nConsistent with the severe nature of the injury being modeled, there were 5 deaths prior to the end of the experiment (Experimental Phase 1\u2009=\u20091 death; Experimental Phase 2\u2009=\u20094 deaths). Four deaths were due to cardiac arrest and failed resuscitation, and 1 death was likely due to an adverse reaction to anesthesia during transition between anesthetic regimens (Experimental Phase 2).\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane delivered via nose-cone mask, and an intravenous (IV) catheter was placed in a limb or ear vein. End-tidal CO\n2\n, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, heart rate, and core body temperature were monitored and recorded. Core body temperature as measured via a rectal probe was maintained between 37 and 39\u00b0C utilizing a heated pad and Bair Hugger forced air blanket. Buprenorphine (0.002\u2009mg/kg for PND 7 piglets and 0.02\u2009mg/kg for PND 21\u201330 piglets; intramuscularly [IM] or IV) was administered prior to incision. Piglets were intubated and mechanically ventilated with room air and minute ventilation was adjusted to maintain an end-tidal CO\n2\nbetween 35 and 45\u2009mm Hg except during episodes of induced apnea and hypoventilation (described below). Saline boluses (5\u201310\u2009mL/kg) were administered for hypotension (mean arterial pressure [MAP] <35\u2009mm Hg). If saline was not successful in increasing blood pressure, then epinephrine (0.005\u2009mg/kg) or ephedrine (0.05\u2009mg/kg) was given via IV. If cardiac arrest occurred, then chest compressions were administered. Before skin incisions, bupivacaine was administered subcutaneously (maximum total\u2009=\u20092.5\u2009mg/kg). Venous or arterial blood was assessed with an iSTAT-handheld\u00ae (Abbott Point of Care, Princeton, NJ) at regular intervals (described in detail below for each experimental phase), and dextrose was administered (0.75\u2009mg/kg, IV) if the piglet was hypoglycemic (glucose <70\u2009mg/dL).\nAn arterial line was placed in the femoral artery as peripheral blood pressure could be undetectable via blood-pressure cuff due to injuries/insults and potentially from anesthetics (Experimental Phases 2 and 3), and was used for blood collection for iSTAT analysis, for a blood source for subdural placement, and for future biomarker analysis. A central venous catheter was placed in either the femoral vein or external jugular vein for administration of medications (Experimental Phase 3). No more than 15% of estimated blood volume was collected over the course of the experiment.\nTo model the frequent concomitant physiological events seen in children with severe AHT, which include hypoventilation and/or apnea and seizures, piglets received focal injuries (cortical impact, SDH, and mass effect) and global insults (apnea, hypoventilation, and seizures) in patterns that evolved over the three experimental phases of the experiment (\nFigs. 1A\n,\n\u200b\n,2A,\n2A\n,\n\u200b\n,3A).\n3A\n). For creation of focal injuries, the scalp was incised, and a burr hole (2\u2009cm in diameter) was made through the skull at the mid-portion of the right coronal suture. With the dura closed, a cortical impact was deployed as previously described (\nTable 1\n).\n22\nAfter the cortical impact, subjects received an injected autologous SDH and epidural balloon inflation to create additional mass effect with volumes and durations as described below (\nTable 1\n). For the SDH, the burr hole was enlarged medially and an angiocatheter (24 gauge) was inserted into the dura as previously described.\n27\nLeak of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the catheter indicated placement in the subarachnoid space, in which case the catheter was removed and replaced within the subdural space as confirmed by no CSF egress. Autologous blood (1.5\u20135.2\u2009mL; 3.6\u201312% of estimated brain weight;\nTable 1\n) was introduced through the angiocatheter slowly over 5\u2009min, creating an SDH; the blood was allowed to clot, and the catheter was removed. Additional temporary mass effect with the potential for midline shift and increased intracranial pressure was achieved by introduction of a Fogarty embolism catheter (size 6 French [6F]) into the epidural space and was inflated slowly (1\u20133\u2009mL; 2.4\u20137.2%;\nTable 1\n) over 1\u2009min and left in place for 15\u201330\u2009min (\nTable 1\n). Seizure-permissive anesthesia was initiated (described below for each experimental phase) and isoflurane was discontinued. When end-tidal isoflurane reached zero, with the plane of anesthesia sufficient (unresponsiveness to the pinch reflex and lack of muscle movement), neuromuscular blockade was initiated (0.8\u2009mg/kg rocuronium) before seizure induction to prevent de-instrumentation with convulsions and breathing during apnea and hypoventilation. Rounds of apnea and hypoventilation were administered as described for each experiment below (\nTable 1\n). Apnea (1\u20133\u2009min) was achieved by turning off the ventilator and clamping the endotracheal tube, and hypoventilation was achieved by turning off the ventilator and manually ventilating the piglet to \u223c4 breaths per min on room air or supplemented with oxygen to allow desaturation of oxygen to 80\u201390% and hypercarbia with the goal of reaching an end-tidal CO\n2\nof \u223c60\u2009mm Hg.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental Phase 1 of model development.\n(A)\nSchematic of experimental time line and procedures.\n(B)\nPTZ failed to induce seizures with methohexital anesthesia.\n(C)\nBicuculline (intravenously) rapidly induced seizures.\n(D)\nAfter seizures, induced with bicuculline piglets had decreased left ventricular contractility and a lower fractional area change (\n*\nmeans\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM differ,\np\n<\u20090.05) indicating reduced ejection fraction and at least temporary myocardial dysfunction.

EEG, electroencephalogram.\nPiglets were maintained on anesthesia (Experimental Phases 1 and 2) or recovered (Experimental Phase 3) to allow evolution of the pathophysiological cascades that might induce HH. Brains were collected 9\u201325\u2009h after the cortical impact under deep anesthesia with isoflurane (\nTable 1\n).\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining\nSections were placed on a 60\u00b0C heat block for 10\u2009min, then rehydrated with xylene (twice for 5\u2009min), 100% ethanol (twice for 1\u2009min), 95% ethanol (twice for 1\u2009min), and 70% ethanol (once for 1\u2009min). Between all subsequent steps, sections were washed 3 times in de-ionized H\n2\nO (dH\n2\nO). Sections were stained with Gill's III Hematoxylin for 2\u2009min (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 1% acid alcohol for three washes, bluing reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30\u2009sec, and 1% alcoholic Eosin Y (Electron Microscopy Sciences; pH 4.5) for 30\u2009sec. Slides were then dehydrated with 70% ethanol (once for 1\u2009min), 95% ethanol (twice for 1\u2009min), 100% ethanol (twice for 1\u2009min), and xylene (twice for 5\u2009min). Permount (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) was applied to slides and coverslipped.\nImmunohistochemistry for active caspase-3, APP, and albumin\nTo determine the presence of apoptosis, axonal damage, and vasogenic edema, sections were de-paraffinized and rehydrated as described above and probed for active caspase-3, APP, or albumin, respectively (see\nTable 2\nfor antibody details). Sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide (Medline, Mundelein, IL) for 15\u2009min to quench endogenous peroxide activity (\nTable 2\n). Slides were placed in pre-heated buffer (\nTable 2\n) and heated for 120\u00b0C for 10\u2009min and 90\u00b0C for 20\u2009min in a pressure cooker (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). After 10\u2009min of equilibration to room temperature, sections were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (137\u2009mM NaCl, 2.7\u2009mM KCl, 10\u2009mM phosphate buffer (EMD Chemicals, Inc., Gibbstown, NJ; pH 8.0) with 1% Tween 20 (PBST; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 5\u2009min to increase permeability followed by a dH\n2\nO rinse for 1\u2009min. Slides for caspase-3 staining were washed 3 times for 5\u2009min each in dH\n2\nO without the PBST step. A PAP pen (Life Technologies, Frederick, MD) was used to create a hydrophobic barrier surrounding the tissue, and slides were incubated with a blocking solution (\nTable 2\n). For the cleaved caspase-3 SignalStain Antibody diluent and SignalStain Boost Detection Reagent (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) were used. The albumin and APP protocols used undiluted normal horse serum in Super Sensitive Wash Buffer (wash buffer; BioGenex, Fremont, CA) for blocking and the Vectastain Universal Elite ABC Kit PK-6200 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Slides were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibody diluted in the blocking buffer (\nTable 2\n). For negative controls, the primary antibody was omitted. Slides were washed 3 times for 8\u2009min each in PBST before application of the secondary antibody and color reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (\nTable 2\n).\nTable\n2.\nImmunohistochemistry Details\nQuenching\nAntigen retrieval buffer\nBlocking\nPrimary antibody\nSecondary antibody\nColor reaction\nAlbumin\n3% H\n2\nO\n2\n15\u2009min, 5\u2009min dH\n2\nO rinse\n1\u2009M Tris 0.5\u2009M EDTA buffer (pH\u2009=\u20098.0)\nNormal horse serum in Optimax buffer, 30\u2009min\nRabbit anti-human Ab137885\n1:250 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA)\nVectastain Universal Elite ABC Kit\nDAB (Vector Labs) solution 3\u2009min\nAPP\n3% H\n2\nO\n2\n15\u2009min, 5\u2009min dH\n2\nO rinse\n1\u2009M Tris 0.5\u2009M EDTA buffer (pH\u2009=\u20098.0)\nNormal horse serum in Optimax buffer, 30\u2009min\nMouse anti-human MAB348\n1:100 (Millipore, Billerica, MA)\nVectastain Universal Elite ABC Kit\nDAB solution 1\u20133\u2009min\nActive-caspase-3\n3% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 10\u2009min during deparaffin/hydration\n10\u2009mM sodium citrate buffer (pH\u2009=\u20097.5)\n5% normal goat serum in SignalStain\u00ae Antibody Diluent #8112\nRabbit anti-human Ab2302\n1:500 (Abcam)\nSignalStain Cleaved Caspase Kit (12692S)\nDAB solution 6\u2009min\nOpen in a separate window\nSlides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated following the rehydration process in reverse as described above (see H&E section), then mounted with Shandon Mount (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cheshire, United Kingdom) and coverslipped. After 30\u2009min, nail polish (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) was applied to the border of each coverslip to seal the slide.\nAnalysis of tissue damage and APP staining pattern\nSections used for analysis were photographed (Rebel, Cannon USA, Melville, NY) with a ruler in the frame. These photographs were printed and the area of brain damage (H&E stained sections) or pattern of APP or albumin staining was observed using the 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009and 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009objectives and drawn on the paper map of the slide using specific landmarks on the slide and slide photograph.\n28\u201330\nAn area was determined to be \u201cdamaged\u201d if the tissue had (1) \u201cred neurons,\u201d (2) acute tissue hemorrhage, or any of the following changes in combination with or adjacent to areas of red neurons: (3) vacuolization around blood vessels, or (4) vacuolization of neuropil, or (5) vacuolization around neurons. Operational criteria to classify neurons as red neurons were the presence of all three of the following features: (1) cell shrinkage with perineuronal vacuolization, (2) cytoplasmic hypereosinophilia, and (3) nuclear pyknosis. Vacuolization alone was not included in the calculation of brain damage areas. Scientists (BB, GP) trained and audited by a forensic neuropathologist (DM) delineated the areas of damage. The sections chosen for analysis differed per experimental phase (noted below). In addition, we qualitatively examined APP, caspase, and albumin staining patterns.\nThe maps of damage identified via H&E were scanned and Adobe Photoshop CS5 (San Jose, CA) was used to determine the area of damage in each hemisphere. Hemispheres were analyzed separately. Details on determining damage areas and volume are described below in the protocol-specific sections of Experimental Phases 2 and 3.\n\nProtocol specific to Experimental Phase 1\nA total of 8 piglets aged 7 (\nn\n=\u20093; 2.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2009kg) or 21 days (\nn\n=\u20095; 5.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009kg) were used. Piglets were treated as above with the following exceptions. Blood pressure was monitored with a blood-pressure cuff that had a lower detection limit of 19\u2009mm Hg for MAP.\nFour piglets (PND 7 or 21) were used for subdural placement optimization and testing of epileptic agents with the seizure-permissive anesthesia protocol. Isoflurane was withdrawn and a bolus of 1.5\u2009mg/kg methohexital (Brevital\u00ae Sodium; JHP Pharmaceuticals, Parsippany, NJ) was administered, followed by an infusion of 50\u2013150\u2009\u03bcg/kg/min that was titrated to normal vital signs. To eliminate motor expression of seizures and allow physiological monitoring, neuromuscular blockade was induced with rocuronium (0.8\u2009mg/kg per 10\u2009min) via an IV catheter titrated to less than 2 twitches by Train-of-Four monitoring. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) were obtained via a montage consisting of scalp-applied electrodes in two longitudinal bipolar configurations on the left and on the right with adjustments made for the craniectomy using silver-coated disc electrodes (1\u2009cm; Grass Technologies, West Warwick, RI) and a Comet Grass-Telefactor EEG machine (Grass Technologies). Results were reviewed by a board-certified pediatric neurologist. Pentylenetetrazol (50\u2013150\u2009mg/kg) and penicillin applied to the surface of the cortex, and bicuculline, a competitive \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A (GABA\nA\n) receptor antagonist, were tested as epileptic agents in PND 7 piglets. Bicuculline was prepared by dissolving in 0.1\u2009N HCL, and adding 0.1\u2009N NaOH until pH\u2009=\u20094.5, resulting in a final concentration of 1.4\u20131.6\u2009mg/mL.\nFour piglets (PND 21) were used to test escalating combinations of injuries and insults starting with low volumes of subdural blood, short-duration apnea, and short-duration hypoventilation and then increasing the volume and duration of insults with the addition of mass effect (\nTable 1\n). After injuries (cortical impact, SDH with or without mass effect), insults were clustered together with apnea induction, a 1-min break, seizure induction, and then a 10-min break followed by hypoventilation induction. A second round of insults 2\u2009h later started with apnea, a 2-min break, then hypoventilation, followed by seizure induction. Cerebral oxygen saturation of the brain was measured via near-infrared spectroscopy as pulse oximetry units attached peripherally failed during apnea. Poor blood flow to the skin was observed following seizure indicating impaired cardiac function. An echocardiogram measuring two-dimensional systolic area, diastolic area, and stroke area was obtained prior to and after seizure induction in two subjects by a cardiologist or cardiac scientist. The ratio of diastolic area to stroke area was used to calculate the fractional area change. Arterial blood was analyzed with an iSTAT in one subject prior to injuries and insults and at the end of the experiment. At the end of the experiment, under anesthesia, piglets were euthanized by IV or intracardiac administration of Euthasol\u00ae (Vibrac Animal Health, Fort Worth, TX). The skull was opened to confirm the placement of an SDH. One piglet died before the end of the experiment, 2\u2009h after the end of the second round of insults due to cardiac arrest and failed resuscitation.\n\nProtocol specific to Experimental Phase 2\nA total of 25 male PND 21 piglets (6.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.25\u2009kg) were used. Piglets were assigned to four treatments: injuries + apnea with hypoventilation, injuries + seizures, injuries + apnea with hypoventilation + seizures, or sham injuries (\nFig. 2\n) with the parameters as described in\nTable 1\n. A subset of piglets received an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function (\nn\n=\u20097). A total of 4 animals died before the end of the experiment. Three animals died from cardiac arrest, and all were in a treatment group including apnea. One animal, which was in the seizure only group, likely died from an adverse anesthetic event in the transition from seizure permissive protocol to isoflurane. One animal (injuries + seizures group) was excluded from damage area assessment due to the presence of an intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the cortex. Arterial or venous blood was collected for blood gases and metabolites prior to injury, 30\u2009min to 7\u2009h post-injury, and prior to sacrifice. If venous blood was collected, values were adjusted for pH (+0.03), HCO\n3\n(\u22121\u2009meq/L), and PCO\n2\n(\u22125\u2009mm Hg). Seizures induced by IV bicuculline were estimated via a heart rate over 250\u2009bpm based on correlation between this degree of tachycardia and seizures on EEG recordings from Experimental Phase 1 and were not directly recorded in Experimental Phase 2.\nAt the end of the experiment, piglets were deeply anesthetized with 3\u20135% isoflurane and euthanized via exsanguination by transcardial perfusion with 0.9% saline followed by 10% phosphate buffered formalin as previously described.\n23\n,\n25\nThe brain was removed leaving the ventral dura intact and post-fixed at 4\u00b0C for up to 1 month. The eyes with attached optic nerves were removed by dissection through the floor of the anterior cranial fossa into the orbital space to expose the globe and contents of the orbit in a subset of injured piglets (\nn\n=\u20093). The eyes were then formalin fixed, photographed, examined grossly for presence of optic nerve sheath hemorrhage, and sectioned horizontally from the posterior pole to the corneal rim, preserving the optic nerve. The eyes were examined macroscopically for retinal hemorrhage, and then were whole mount paraffin embedded. Tissue sections were examined for microscopic retinal hemorrhage using H&E staining. Brains were weighed, photographed with and without the dura, and the presence of subdural blood and/or subarachnoid blood was noted. Whole brains were photographed and sectioned in the coronal plane into 5-mm blocks starting at the anterior edge of the rostral gyrus. Blocks were paraffin embedded and stored in sealed containers at room temperature. Three 5-mm blocks at the level of the rostral gyrus (\nFig. 3F\n; blocks corresponding to 3/11, 4/12, and 5/13) were serially sectioned into 10-\u03bcm sections, and every other section was mounted on poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides (Plain Micro Slides, Corning, Inc., Corning, NY), dried, and stored in labeled slide boxes at room temperature.\nH&E-stained sections were qualitatively assessed for mechanical injury (contusion area, presence of necrosis, extravasated red blood cells, tissue tears, and axonal swelling), as well as for red neurons. Apart from focal blunt impact injury, no other lateralizing pattern of injury was observed: red neurons were widespread throughout the cerebrum, predominantly at watershed areas (see\nResults\nsection for details); therefore, two sections containing both hemispheres (one section from two blocks: 4/12 and 5/13;\nFig. 3F\n) were mapped for tissue damage as described above. The area of tissue damage was taken as a percentage of the area of the entire hemisphere and averaged among sections per hemisphere per piglet.\n\nProtocol specific to Experimental Phase 3\nA total of 14 piglets aged 30 days (9.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.36\u2009kg) were used. Piglets were treated as described in the general methods with the following exceptions. Piglets received Cetacain\u00ae spray (Cetylite Inc., Pennsauken, NJ) prior to intubation. Piglets received 25\u2009mg/kg cefazolin via IV after IV placement. CSF was collected via 23-gauge catheter from the subarachnoid space in the ventral portion of the burr hole of the skull (200\u2013400\u2009\u03bcL) or via the cisterna magna (0.5\u20131.5\u2009mL) with an 18-gauge spinal needle prior to injury and prior to sacrifice for future analysis.\nTo facilitate the determination of the effect of age on the pathophysiology of this injury in planned future experiments, the GABA\nA\nreceptor was avoided for both anesthesia and seizure induction and a new anesthetic protocol was developed (see\nResults\nsection) using 5 piglets. A previously published protocol failed to work in our hands due to lack of adequate sedation.\n31\nTherefore, while subjects were on isoflurane for the initial surgical procedures, infusions of morphine (3.5\u2009mg/kg/h) and dexmedetomidine (20\u03bcg/kg/h) were initiated and isoflurane was decreased. After the surgeries were completed, isoflurane was discontinued and piglets received chlorpromazine (2\u2009mg/kg every 4\u2009h). Once end-tidal isoflurane was zero for 30\u2009min and piglets were adequately sedated (no response to noxious stimulation) without isoflurane, neuromuscular blockade was induced (rocuronium; 0.8\u2009mg/kg) prior to induction of seizures to prevent de-instrumentation and to prevent over-breathing the ventilator during hypoventilation. After insults, breakthrough movement was treated with 0.4\u2009mg/kg boluses of morphine and rocuronium (0.8\u2009mg/kg), no more than once per h. To allow the drugs to metabolize, 3\u2009h prior to recovery, dexmedetomidine infusion was discontinued and the morphine infusion was decreased to 0.5\u20131.4\u2009mg/kg/h. If additional analgesia/sedation was needed to cause muscle relaxation once infusion of dexmedetomidine ceased, analgesia was supplemented with 20\u201340% nitrous oxide prior to recovery.\nCortical impact, mass effect, and SDH occurred as in Experimental Phase 2, but seizures were induced by local application of kainic acid (42\u2009\u03bcg/kg) instead of with IV bicuculline. The dose of kainic acid was determined by injecting rounds of 100\u2009\u03bcg kainic acid 15\u2009min apart until seizures occurred, and then testing this total dose administered once in the piglets to optimize the anesthetic protocol. Kainic acid prepared at 1\u20131.25\u2009mg/mL achieved more reliable and longer seizures than a solution at 5\u2009mg/mL, possibly due to greater distribution of the larger volume when mixed in with the blood placed in the subdural space (\nTable 3\n). The kainic acid dose (an average of 0.07\u2009\u03bcg kainic acid/g body weight among ages) is similar to the dosage of kainic acid injected into the perirhinal or occipital cortex that causes seizures in adult rodents (0.004\u20130.010\u2009\u03bcg kainic acid/g body weight).\n32\u201334\nKainic acid was either injected 5\u20137\u2009mm deep into the cortical parenchyma of the rostral gyrus leaving the needle in place for 5\u2009min (to prevent egress) or kainic acid was mixed into the blood that was placed under the dura at one time. One piglet that received kainic acid in the cortical parenchyma developed an intraparenchymal hematoma and was excluded. In subsequent experiments, all kainic acid was mixed into the injected subdural blood to avoid intraparenchymal hemorrhage.\nTable\n3.\nArterial Blood Gases and Chemistry in Experimental Phase\n2\nPre-injury\nPost-injury\nSacrifice\nBase excess (BEEcf) (mmol/L)\nGroup 1\n5.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090.63\na\n-2.75\u2009\u00b1\u20092.84\nb\n0.00\u2009\u00b1\u20092.00\na,b\nGroup 2\n4.50\u2009\u00b1\u20091.32\na\n2.25\u2009\u00b1\u20091.31\nb\n1.67\u2009\u00b1\u20090.67\na,b\nGroup 3\n4.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.84\na\n-5.80\u2009\u00b1\u20094.33\nb\n-3.75\u2009\u00b1\u20096.55\na,b\nSham\n7.00\u2009\u00b1\u20091.00\na\n3.00\u2009\u00b1\u20092.52\nb\n6.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\na,b\nTotal CO\n2\n(mmol/L)\nGroup 1\n29.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.65\na\n23.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.59\nb\n27.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.00\na,b\nGroup 2\n27.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.70\na\n25.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.26\nb\n28.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.53\na,b\nGroup 3\n28.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.07\na\n22.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.86\nb\n28.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.53\na,b\nSham\n32.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.50\na\n28.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.45\nb\n31.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\na,b\nOxygen saturation (%)\nGroup 1\n99.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.58\na\n93.2\u2009\u00b1\u20092.81\na\n94.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.50\na,b\nGroup 2\n98.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9\na\n96.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.11\na\n98.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.50\na\nGroup 3\n63.0\u2009\u00b1\u200919.4\nb*\n70.2\u2009\u00b1\u200919.6\nb*\n68.8\u2009\u00b1\u200916.1\nb*\nSham\n81.5\u2009\u00b1\u20094.50\na,b\n75.7\u2009\u00b1\u20096.84\na,b\n95.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\na,b\nSodium (mmol/L)\nGroup 1\n137\u2009\u00b1\u20090.75\na\n139\u2009\u00b1\u20090.50\nb,c\n141\u2009\u00b1\u20090.88\nb,c\nGroup 2\n137\u2009\u00b1\u20092.33\na\n141\u2009\u00b1\u20090.63\nb,c\n141\u2009\u00b1\u20090.58\nb,c\nGroup 3\n137\u2009\u00b1\u20090.75\na\n141\u2009\u00b1\u20090.89\nb,c\n143\u2009\u00b1\u20091.80\nb,c\nSham\n138\u2009\u00b1\u20091.00\na\n142\u2009\u00b1\u20092.96\nb,c\n139\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\nb,c\nGlucose (mg/dL)\nGroup 1\n109\u2009\u00b1\u200914.2\na\n162\u2009\u00b1\u20093.90\nb\n136\u2009\u00b1\u200917.5\na,b\nGroup 2\n126\u2009\u00b1\u200924.8\na\n149\u2009\u00b1\u200911.4\nb\n118\u2009\u00b1\u20093.00\na,b\nGroup 3\n121\u2009\u00b1\u20095.79\na\n160\u2009\u00b1\u200920.4\nb\n114\u2009\u00b1\u200917.1\na,b\nSham\n74.5\u2009\u00b1\u20099.5\na\n104\u2009\u00b1\u20092.89\nb\n113\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\na,b\nOpen in a separate window\nData are expressed as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.

EEGs were analyzed with dClamp (version 3.5; Staley Lab\n\u00a9\n2012). Tachycardia was a biomarker for seizure activity confirmed by EEG and was used as a surrogate for seizure duration in those piglets not instrumented with EEG. Tonic-clonic seizure activity (detected with EEG) after focal kainic acid administration was accompanied by tachycardia (> 200\u2009bpm;\nTable 4\n), but clonic seizure activity occurred with a normal heart rate. Only seizures with tachycardia were included in \u201cestimated seizure duration.\u201d\nTable\n4.\nKainic Acid Administration, Seizure Length, and Damage Pathology per Piglet in Experimental Phase\n3\nPiglet\nKainic acid diluent, concentration\nKainic acid route\nLength of induced seizures (min)\n#, length of spontaneous seizures\nTotal estimated seizure time\n% Damage contralateral hemisphere\n% Damage ipsilateral hemisphere\n359\nWater, 1.25\u2009mg/mL\nIP\n180\na\n2: 15, 105\u2009min\nb\n300\n22.6\n64\n361\nWater, 1.25\u2009mg/mL\nIP (2 doses)\n450\na,b\n0\n450\nIntraparenchymal hemorrhage, excluded\nIntraparenchymal hemorrhage, excluded\n365\nWater, 1.25\u2009mg/mL\nSDH\n210\nb\n2: 60, 30\u2009min\nc\n300\n12.0\n50.9\n369\nSaline, 1.25\u2009mg/mL\nSDH\n45\na\n0\n45\n7.2\n27.0\n370\nSaline, 1.25\u2009mg/mL\nIP\n90\nb\n2: 3\u20135\u2009min\nc\n98\n2.7\n26.9\n371\nPBS, 5\u2009mg/mL\nSDH\n30\na\n0\n30\n0.0\n6.0\n373\nPBS, 5\u2009mg/mL\nIP\n3\nb\n3: 3\u20135\u2009min\nc\n12\n2.5\n24.5\nOpen in a separate window\na\nSeizure length via EEG.\nb\nSeizure length estimated via heart rate over 200\u2009bpm.\nc\nSeizure length estimated via visible convulsions.\nEEG, electroencephalogram; IP, intraparenchymal injection of kainic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SDH, kainic acid injected with blood to create subdural hematoma.\nApnea duration was reduced from 3\u2009min in Experimental Phase 2 to 1\u2009min, and oxygen was not supplemented during hypoventilation. Rounds of apnea and hypoventilation were reduced from two rounds to a single round.\nSix hours after cortical impact or sham surgery, piglets were recovered from anesthesia. Sham piglets received buprenorphine (0.02\u2009mg/kg; IM or IV) and were returned to the animal facility. Piglets receiving model injuries had impaired neurological status and stayed in the operating room where a protocol was developed for an intensive care unit (described in\nResults\nsection) for recovery from anesthesia and constant observation and critical care interventions as needed.\nOne hour after extubation, either in the operating room/intensive care unit (piglets receiving model injuries) or in the animal facility (sham piglets), piglets underwent a neurological assessment adapted from a global asphyxia model to which assessment of focal deficits was also added (\nTable 5\n).\n35\nJust prior to re-intubation at the end of the 12-h recovery period, the neurological and motor assessments were repeated.\nTable\n5.\nNeurological and Motor Assessment Tools\nNeurological assessment\nFinding\nScore\nMental status (subtract 1 for seizures)\nComa, no responsiveness\n1\nStupor, responsive to vigorous stimulation only with posturing\n2\nLethargy, drowsiness or delirium\n3\nAwake\n4\nSubtotal\nCranial nerves\nPupil reflex\nUnreactive (dilated and not constricting to light)\n1\nSluggish (dilated and slow to constrict to light)\n2\nNormal\n3\nCorneal reflex\nAbsent\n1\nPresent\n2\nOculovestibular reflex\nAbsent\n1\nPresent\n4\nSucking reflex (7 days) Swallowing (1 month)\nAbsent\n1\nPresent\n4\nSubtotal\n/4\u2009=\nReflexes\nDeep tendon reflex\nAbsent\n1\nHyper\n2\nNormal\n4\nStep reflex\nAbsent\n1\nNormal\n4\nRighting\nAbsent\n1\nNormal\n4\nSubtotal\n/3\u2009=\nMotor: global\nStanding\nUnable to stand\n1\nBears weight with abnormal posture\n2\nGets to standing with difficulty\n3\nStands normally\n4\nCoordination\nNo attempt to walk\n1\nAttempts to walk but cannot\n2\nWalks but fails\n3\nWalks normally\n4\nSubtotal\n/2\u2009=\nSensorimotor\nWithdrawal to pain\nDoes not respond to pain\n1\nWithdraws from pain unilateral (note side)\n2\nWithdraws from pain bilateral\n4\nVision\nNo reaction, startles to face touch bilateral\n1\nStartles to face touch unilateral (note side)\n2\nReacts to approaching object; does not startle to face touch\n4\nSubtotal\n/2\u2009=\nGrand Total\nMaximum Possible\n20\nMotor assessment\nScore 0 (none), 1 (present)\nNotes\nUpper right\nUpper left\nLower right\nLower left\nAll limbs equal (score\u2009=\u20095)\nObserve during neurological assessment: using one side more than other when walking, posturing, thrashing, righting reaction.\nGrand total\u2009=\u2009_____/ 5\nOpen in a separate window\nPiglets were recovered from anesthetics and extubated for a maximum of 12\u2009h and were then re-anesthetized with isoflurane, intubated, mechanically ventilated, and transitioned to the morphine-dexmedetomidine-chlorpromazine protocol, withdrawing isoflurane. Nitrous oxide was administered if necessary to keep piglets sedated. Sham piglets were treated similarly for a similar exposure to anesthetics.\nTwenty-four hours after the injury, piglets were deeply anesthetized with 3\u20135% isoflurane and euthanized via exsanguination by transcardial perfusion with 0.9% saline followed by 10% phosphate buffered formalin. The brain, including olfactory bulbs, and 2\u2009cm of spinal cord were removed leaving the ventral dura intact; the brain was weighed, and post-fixed at 4\u00b0C for 5 days. Brains were weighed and photographed with and without the dura, and the presence of subdural and/or subarachnoid blood was noted. One piglet was excluded due to lack of placement of SDH. All other piglets with SDH were included in the study regardless of the area of distribution of hemorrhage in the subdural space, which varied. The total area of the SDH covering each hemisphere was determined by analyzing photographs of the separated dura and with ventral and dorsal views of the brain in Adobe Photoshop. To avoid over-estimation, any predicted superimposition of subdural blood between ventral and dura photos was only analyzed once.\nThe cerebellum was removed and the cerebral hemispheres divided, weighed, and coronally sliced (\nFig. 3F\n). Blocks were paraffin embedded and stored in sealed containers at room temperature. Blocks were trimmed and 10-\u03bcm sections were made, and seven consecutive sections were mounted on poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides (Plain Micro Slides, Corning Inc., Corning, NY), dried, and stored in slide boxes at room temperature. Additional sections were made per block if needed.\nOne section in each block (\nFig. 3F\n) was stained with H&E and analyzed for the tissue changes described in Experimental Phase 2, above. The volume of tissue damage and the volume of each hemisphere was estimated by averaging the area of tissue damage as a percentage of the total area of the hemisphere among all sections spanning the entire brain (10 sections per hemisphere).\n\nStatistical analysis\nPhysiological measures\nIn arterial blood, the differences in pH, partial pressure of CO\n2\nand O\n2\n, base excess of extracellular fluid compartment, HCO\n3\n, total CO\n2\n, oxygen saturation, sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, glucose, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and lactate among time-points and among treatment groups and the interaction were tested via two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons tests. Lactate was compared pre-injury versus maximum post-injury with a Student's\nt\ntest or over several time-points with a repeated measures ANOVA. The effect of treatment and hemisphere and the interaction were tested on damaged area via a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons tests. The effects of treatment on left ventricle area systolic, diastolic, and fractional area change were tested with a one-way ANOVA. The difference between heart rate, end-tidal CO\n2\n, and oxygen saturation were compared with paired Student's\nt\ntests in Experimental Phase 1. The differences between heart rate, MAP, end-tidal CO\n2\n, and oxygen saturation minimum and/or maximum after injury versus pre-injury among treatment groups were tested via two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons tests for Experimental Phases 2 and 3. If oxygen saturation was too low to read, then 20 was inserted as a value as the lowest values successfully detected with our pulse oximetry unit were 18\u201322%. In Experimental Phase 2, if piglets died before receiving their assigned treatment, they were re-assigned to the treatment group matching the actual insults received.\nNeurological scores, damage volumes, and effect of estimated seizure duration\nIn Experimental Phase 3, the difference in motor and neurological scores in injured versus sham piglets 8\u2009h after injury and 20\u2009h after injury was tested via a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison tests. The difference between the percentage of the hemisphere covered by SDH in ipsilateral versus contralateral hemisphere was tested with a paired Student's\nt\ntest. The potential correlation between the percentage of the hemisphere covered by SDH and percentage of hemisphere damaged and the potential correlation between estimated seizure duration and percentage of damaged hemisphere were tested via Pearson correlation and the regression line plotted in SigmaPlot\n\u00ae\nversion 11.0 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA).\nAll values were expressed as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM);\np\n-values <0.05 were considered significant.

    "Methods": "Mice\nExperiments were conducted in accordance with The Ohio State University Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee. Adult (3\u20134 months of age) female C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. Mice were housed 3\u20134 per cage and provided food and water\nad libitum.\nThe chimeric mice were engineered by adoptively transferring bone marrow (BM) from a C57BL/6-Tg (CAG-enhanced green fluorescent protein [EGFP] donor (3\u20134 months of age, Jackson) into a busulfan-treated C57BL/6J recipient mice (1\u20132 months of age, Jackson).\n\nEngineering of GFP\n+\nBM-chimera\nBM recipient C57BL/6 female mice (6\u20138 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally once daily for two consecutive days with busulfan in a 1:1 solution of dimethyl sulfoxide and deionized H\n2\nO (30\u2009mg/kg/100\u2009\u03bcL). The selected dosage of busulfan results in partial BM ablation and limited morbidity.\n20\n,\n24\nDonor mice were euthanized with carbon dioxide, and the femur was extracted. Donor BM-derived cells were isolated from the femur and passed through a 70\u2009\u03bcm cell strainer. Total number of cells was determined with a BD Coulter Particle Count and Size Analyzer (Beckman Coulter). BM-derived cells (1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n6\n) were transferred to recipient mice by tail vein injection (100\u2009\u03bcL) 48\u2009h after the second dose of busulfan. Mice were left undisturbed for four weeks to allow engraftment. Engraftment was verified by determining the percentage of GFP+ cells in the blood.\n\nSCI\nContusion of the spinal cord was performed as described previously.\n7\nIn brief, mice were anesthetized with a ketamine (138\u2009mg/kg)-xylazine (20\u2009mg/kg) cocktail and given prophylactic antibiotic agents (gentocin, 1\u2009mg/kg). Using aseptic techniques, removal of the spinous process and lamina of T9 exposed the dura. After stabilizing the vertebral column, the Infinite Horizon (IH) device delivered 75 kilodynes of force to induce a severe contusion injury. The incision was closed in layers and 2\u2009mL of sterile saline was administered subcutaneously (SC) to prevent dehydration. Randomized group assignment occurred. During recovery, mice received antibiotic agents (1\u2009mg/kg gentocin, SC) and saline for five days, and bladders were expressed manually twice per day until tissue harvest.\n25\n\nTraining paradigm and locomotor recovery\nTreadmill training was delivered in subgroups of mice at early time points as described previously.\n7\nStarting two days after injury, training consisted of six consecutive days of manually delivered, weight-supported stepping during quadrupedal locomotion on a custom-built treadmill (Columbus Instruments). Hindlimb stepping was assisted manually as needed using small rounded pestles to achieve toe clearance and plantar placement of the paw on the treadmill belt. Adjustable harnesses provided partial body weight support while maintaining the trunk in a typical horizontal murine posture. Each session included two 10\u2009min bouts separated by a 20\u2009min rest interval to prevent delayed onset muscle soreness. Locomotor recovery was assessed in the open field using the Basso Mouse Scale\n26\nbefore injury and at one, three, and seven days post-SCI. Two raters, blind to group, assessed joint movement, weight support, plantar stepping, coordination, paw position, trunk and tail control over a 4-min period. Scores range from no hindlimb movement (0) to normal locomotion (9).\n\nFlow cytometry on blood\nTo confirm chimerism, blood was collected by cardiac stick, and red blood cells were lysed. Blood leukocytes were washed, and the Fc receptors were blocked with anti-CD16/CD32 antibody (eBioscience). Cells were incubated with CD11b (eBioscience) and Ly6C (BD Biosciences) antibodies for 1\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. Cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer for analysis. Antigen expression was determined using a Becton-Dickinson FACSCaliber four-color cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star), and gating for each antibody was determined based on isotype stained controls and percent GFP+ cells was determined. Chimerism resulted in 60\u201365% of all circulating cells and 95% of Ly6C\nhigh\nmonocytes being positive for GFP.\n\nPurification of CD11b\n+\ncells from spinal cord\nEnriched CD11b\n+\ncells were isolated from the spinal cord as described previously.\n27\nIn brief, the spinal cord was removed, and the epicenter and lumbar regions were dissected. Each segment was homogenized and centrifuged to collect a cell pellet. Cells were then suspended in a discontinuous Percoll density gradient (70%/35%/0%) and centrifuged. Microglia and peripherally derived CD11b\n+\ncells were collected at the 70%/35% Percoll interphase.\n\nSorting of microglia and macrophages from spinal cord tissue\nPercoll enriched CD11b\n+\ncells were incubated with an Fc receptors block (anti-CD16/CD32 antibody) followed with rat anti-mouse Ly6G-PE, CD45-PerCP-Cy5.5, and CD11b-APC antibodies (eBioscience, CA). Cells were sorted using a Becton-Dickinson FACSAria III cell sorter at the OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center core facility. Neutrophils were identified by CD11b\n+\n/GFP\n+\n/Ly6G\n+\nexpression and were excluded (\nFig. 1A\n). Microglia were identified by CD11b\n+\n/CD45\nlow\n/GFP\n-\nexpression, and peripherally derived macrophages were identified by CD11b\n+\n/CD45\nhigh\n/GFP\n+\nexpression (\nFig. 1A\n). Microglia and macrophages (10\u20135000 cells) were sorted into separate collection tubes. Flow data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, CA).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRecruitment of peripheral macrophages and neutrophils into the spinal cord. (\nA\n) FAC-sorting of neutrophils, macrophages, and microglia. C57BL6 mice underwent busulfan treatment to ablate the bone marrow (BM). Next, busulfan treated mice received a BM transfer of cells from a green fluorescent protein (GFP)+ C57BL6 donor mouse. After BM resconstitution (3 weeks), GFP+ BM chimeric mice were na\u00efve or underwent a thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI). The epicenter region and lumbar region was collected 24\u2009h, here days, and seven days after the injury. Myeloid cells were isolated by Percoll gradient and neutrophils (CD11b\n+\nLy6G\n+\n), macrophages (CD11b\n+\nLy6G\n-\nGFP\n+\n), and microglia (CD11b\n+\nLy6G\n-\nGFP\n-\n) were identified by FACS. (\nB\n) The percentage of neutrophils in the epicenter and lumbar region is shown. (\nC\n) Neutrophil infiltration into the lumbar gray matter was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in a subset of chimeric mice. (\nD\n) The percentage of macrophages in the epicenter and lumbar region is shown. Bars represent the mean + standard error of the mean. Means with (*) are significantly different than controls. (\nn\n=\u20095 per group)\n\nNanoString and nCounter analysis of mRNA copy number\nFAC-sorted microglia and macrophages were pelleted and lysed in RNA lysis buffer. Norgen Biotek Single Cell RNA Purification Columns were used to purify and concentrate total RNA. RNA quality and integrity was determined using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). RNA was analyzed using NanoString nCounter technology (\nwww.nanostring.com\n), which allows expression analysis of multiple genes from a single sample. This approach adds confidence in reaching conclusions on expression patterns that would be limited if using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to validate single gene messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. Here, the low number of cells sorted and low RNA concentration would necessitate pooled samples for qPCR, potentially increasing variability. Hence, Nanostring is a more sensitive assay. NanoString analysis was performed by the Nucleic Acid Core Facility at OSU (\nn\n=\u200984).\nnCounter multiplexed target profiling of 60 custom genes was performed. Customized plates were designed with selected microglia or macrophage related genes that are relevant to inflammation/trafficking, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and growth/repair. Importantly, several genes within each category were chosen so that a trend in expression could be determined. Data were analyzed using nSolver 2.6. After technical normalization of positive and negative controls, RNA was normalized based on expression of housekeeping genes glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta-actin (ACTB), and ornithine decarboxylas antizyme 1 (OAZ1). Samples with correlation coefficients <0.8 within the biological group were removed from the study (\nn\n=\u20096). Heat maps were generated by unsupervised clustering analyses using Pearson correlation in the nSolver program.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and digital image analysis\nGFP+ chimeric mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.2). Spinal cord segments from spinal levels L1\u2013L6 were post-fixed for 1\u2009h in 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed overnight in 0.2M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4), then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose before being embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Thermoscientific) and frozen on dry ice.\n7\n,\n28\n,\n29\nLumbar blocks were sectioned in their entirety at 20\u2009\u03bcm on a Microm HM505E cryostat.\nSections were stained for neutrophils using Ly6G antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific). In brief, sections were blocked (1% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 5% normal goat serum [NGS]) and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal Ly6G antibody (1:500) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Sections were washed with PBS and incubated with a fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody (Alexa Flour 594) (1:500). Control sections were processed by eliminating the primary antibody and replacing with blocking solution to ensure positive labeling. Fluorescent images were visualized using a Zeiss 510 Laser Confocal Microscope (The Ohio State University Confocal Microscopy Imaging Facility).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were analyzed using one way analysis of variance with Tukey\npost hoc\ntesting or Student\nt\ntest when appropriate (IBM SPSS).

    "Methods": "Differential centrifugation is a common method used to isolate EVs from biological fluids and media. The basis of differential centrifugation is the application of successive centrifugation steps of increasing centrifugal force and duration to sequentially isolate smaller from larger objects. The larger particles sediment faster and, by leaving the majority of smaller ones in the supernatant, can be progressively removed in the initial centrifugation steps (Fig. 2A). Subsequent successive rounds of centrifugation ultimately provide the particulate of interest. For most common EV isolation protocols, there are four consecutive centrifugation steps: low speed (10\u2009min at 300g) is initially used to sediment cells and debris, (10\u2009min at 2000g) to remove further debris and apoptotic bodies, (30\u2009min at 10,000 to 20,000g) to isolate microvesicles (generally with diameters in excess of 100\u2013150\u2009nm), followed by pelleting of smaller EVs with predominance of exosomes (100,000g for 70\u2009min). Thereafter, washing and a repeat 100,000gcentrifugation step of the re-suspended pellet is commonly applied to further purify the EV sample from any free proteins.81\n\nEssentially, the method provides a reasonable purity of EVs but at a moderately low yield. The primary challenge for this purification technique is the separation of EVs from smaller microvesicles consequent to their close size similarity. Additionally, the method is not particularly efficient for handling large numbers of biological fluids, such as would be expected with time-dependent serum or plasma samples deriving from a clinical trial for EV analysis of potential biomarkers.\n\nDensity gradient centrifugation, a variation of ultracentrifugation, described above, is the use of a density gradient during the centrifugation process.82There are essentially two types, isopycnic and moving-zone (Fig. 2A). The use of the former, density gradient ultracentrifugation, is being increasingly applied to the isolation of EVs where separation is achieved based on their size, mass, and density within a selected density gradient medium of increasingly higher density from top to bottom. The biological sample is added as a narrow band onto the top of the density gradient, and subjected to ultracentrifugation to allow centrifugal force to move the assorted components within the sample, including EVs, as different discrete zones depending on their specific sedimentation rate. These zones can then be collected and cleaned by re-suspending them in physiological buffered saline (PBS) and ultracentrifuged (100,000g) to provide EVs for further analysis. In the isopycnic process, a density gradient medium is selected to cover the entire range of densities of sample constituents, and thus zone separation depends on density differences between EVs versus other components, with each sedimenting along the density gradient that matches its own, the isopycnic position\u2014which, in general, lies between 1.10 and 1.21\u2009g/mL for EVs.83\n\nIn moving-zone ultracentrifugation, the biological sample is added as a thin layer to the top of a prepared gradient density medium of lower density than any of the sample's components. EVs hence gradually separate from other elements based on their different size and mass, rather than their density difference (as in isopycnic ultracentrifugation), and thus the moving-zone process permits the separation of EVs with similar densities but diverse sizes. When centrifugal force is applied, the separation process is dynamic for the moving-zone procedure as, over sufficient time, all components will eventally pellet together at the bottom of the centrifuge tube, and hence time and the application of centrifugal force need to be optimized to maximize EV separation. This contrasts with the isopycnic procedure, in which static zones are ultimately achieved at the isopycnic position of the alike density components.\n\nIn synopsis, when applied optimally, density gradient ultracentrifugation procedures can be advantageouly applied to differential ultracentrifugation to improve the quantity and purity of the EVs harvested, particularly when there is an expected heterogeneity in the EV population and an overlap in size in relation to other elements within the biological sample.84A disadvantage is that such techniques are relatively labor-intense and cannot readily be applied to large numbers of samples."

    "Methods": "Twenty subjects treated for mTBI were entered into a prospective clinical cohort study to localize fMRI differences specifically associated with mTBI with OMD using whole brain task and resting-state fMRI. Mild TBI subjects who had OMD (OMD group) were compared with mTBI subjects who had no findings of OMD (control group). These groups were determined by a developmental optometrist using the following objective testing for OMD: positive fusional vergence, near point convergence (NPC), accommodation amplitude, positive relative accommodation (PRA), negative relative accommodation (NRA), smooth pursuits, and saccadic movement. All subjects had sustained mild TBI as defined by a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of \u226513 and no findings on either a computed tomography (CT) or a clinical MRI scan.\n\nSubjects were possible candidates for the study if they met all inclusion/exclusion criteria listed inTable 1and, for controls, those who also had no visual findings. They were entered into the study within nine months of their injury. After eligibility was established, informed consent was obtained from either the subject or the subjects' legally authorized representative. The human subjects protocol for this study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards from Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) and the University of Minnesota. This clinical study was registered withclinicaltrials.gov; NCT # 02771106.\n\nVision testing\nPotential subjects were identified by physicians in the TBI Outpatient program at HCMC and referred to the developmental optometrist who performed objective testing to confirm whether they did or did not have OMD related to the mTBI, as well as the severity of their OMD if they were found to have this diagnosis. Ten subjects with mTBI were found to have significant OMD (OMD group), and 10 subjects with mTBI had no OMD findings (control group). One control subject was withdrawn from the study because of incidental findings on the MRI. An assessment for pre-injury OMD symptomatology as well as a Post-Trauma Vision Survey were used to screen for undiagnosed or subclinical vision problems.\n12\nThe primary indicators of convergence insufficiency are the presence of a receded NPC and a decreased positive fusional vergence. The NPC was measured with the fixation stick (Gulden Ophthalmics, Elkins Park, PA). The fixation stick has a single letter (20/80 equivalent at 40\u2009cm). This letter size was selected to accommodate presbyopic subjects who would not have their spectacle correction during the task fMRI, ensuring their ability to see the near target and accurately report any diplopia. The fixation stick was slowly brought toward the subject, and the distance at which either the subject reported diplopia of the letter or the distance at which the developmental optometrist observed an eye drift was recorded. If an eye drift was observed and no diplopia was reported, suppression was recorded. Suppression was also evaluated with the Worth four dot (W4D). The W4D was held 16 inches away from subjects while they are wearing red and green glasses. If the subject saw four dots, there was not suppression, and if they reported two or three dots, then there was suppression.\nThe positive fusional vergence was measured using a single column of letters on a fixation stick (20/30 equivalent at 40\u2009cm) and a horizontal prism bar (HLB-15 Astron International, Naples, FL). This measurement was performed in free space, which allowed for more peripheral visual input because mTBI patients have decreased peripheral visual processing. A phoropter may restrict the TBI subject's peripheral vision when performing vergence tasks. Free space vergences have been shown to have good repeatability.\n13\nThe fixation stick was held by the subject 40\u2009cm from the nose. The developmental optometrist then presented an increasing amount of base out prism in front of the subject's right eye until the subject report sustained diplopia or when an eye drift was observed.\nThe two primary indicators of accommodative insufficiency are a reduced amplitude of accommodation and a decreased PRA.\n14\nThe amplitude of accommodation was measured using the Reichart phoropter (model 11625B, Depew, NY), and the subject viewed a single horizontal line of letters (20/30 at 40\u2009cm) with one eye occluded. The amount of minus lens needed to blur the letters was recorded as the amplitude of accommodation measurement. This test was repeated for the left eye. The PRA was measured in the phoropter; both eyes were open for this test. The amount of minus lens needed to completely blur the letters was recorded as the PRA. This test was repeated with plus lenses presented in front of both eyes, the amount of plus lens needed to completely blur the letters was recorded as the NRA.\nThe smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movement testing was performed with a Wolff wand (Bernell, Mishawaka, IN). For the smooth pursuits testing, the wand was held in front of the subject and moved in a large circular pattern several times. For the saccades testing, two wands were held in front of the subject who was asked to move the eyes back and forth between the two wands when prompted. The developmental optometrist observed the accuracy of the subject's eye movements and graded the accuracy and speed of the eye movements on a scale of 1\u20134, with 4 being normal.

These symptoms are ones that other OMD diagnoses do not cause and can include nausea or dizziness with reading and up close tasks, as well as difficulty scrolling on computers, walking through narrow hallways, driving with windshield wipers on, and/or looking at busy patterns on the floor.\n\nMRI\nWithin three weeks of the objective visual testing, MRI data were acquired using a Siemens Magnetom Prisma 3T scanner, including T1-weighted anatomical (MPRAGE, voxel size: 0.94\u2009\u00d7\u20090.94\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009mm\n3\n) and fMRI (TR/TE\u2009=\u20091000/36\u2009msec, voxel size: 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009mm\n3\n) scans.\nDuring the task fMRI acquisitions, subjects held their gaze at a near target, presented 10\u2009cm from the nose, for 10\u2009sec and attempted to maintain fusion. Next, they relaxed their gaze to a far target that was 110\u2009cm from the nose for 30\u2009sec. The far target stimuli were generated using PsychoPy and were presented on a rear-projection screen visible through a mirror.\n18\n,\n19\nThis cycle repeated for about 6\u2009min. For resting-state fMRI, subjects were scanned \u201cat rest\u201d for 6\u2009min and 40\u2009sec with their eyes closed.\nData processing and analyses were performed using programs from the AFNI and FSL analysis packages.\n20\n,\n21\nPre-processing steps include motion correction, distortion correction, co-registration to the T1-weighted anatomical images and spatial smoothing.\n22\nThe data were smoothed conservatively (to preserve spatial resolution) with a 3\u2009mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel.\nEach subject's task fMRI data were statistically analyzed with a general linear model, with the time course of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal serving as the dependent variable in each voxel. The regressor (effect) of interest was coded as a boxcar function, modeling whether the subject's focus was on the near or far target, convolved with a gamma variate to account for the gradual rise and fall of the hemodynamic response. Additional regressors were also included to account for head movement and drift in the baseline MR signal over time. At each voxel and for each subject, a beta weight for near versus far target was estimated as the effect of eye convergence (independent variable).\nFor the group analysis (OMD group vs. control group), these betas were used in a voxel-wise two-sample\nt\ntest comparing the two groups. Based on the results of this\nt\ntest, voxels were thresholded at an uncorrected\np\nvalue <0.01. The correction for multiple testing was achieved by determining the minimum significant cluster size. Taking into account increasing concerns over the risk of inflated false positives with voxel-wise group comparisons, as reported by Eklund and associates,\n23\na non-parametric permutation test was used. This permutation test randomized the signs of the residuals of the model among subjects, per voxel, and then performed a\nt\ntest, with these steps iterated 10,000 times, to determine the probability that, if each voxel has a 1% chance of displaying a false positive group difference, clusters of a given size would occur by chance. Based on these probabilities, clusters (in the original voxel-thresholded group-difference map) that were smaller than those that would occur by chance more than 5% of the time were filtered out of the results to achieve a cluster-level \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05.\nAfter similar pre-processing for the resting-state fMRI data, each of the (three) identified clusters of activation differences between groups, found with task fMRI, was treated as a \u201cseed\u201d region. Resting-state fMRI time courses across voxels for each region were averaged to generate representative seed time courses. These seed time courses were then correlated with all other voxels' time courses throughout the brain in each subject. Correlation coefficients were Fisher z-transformed and treated as the dependent variable in a\nt\ntest comparing groups. Results were thresholded and corrected for multiple testing as in the task analysis.\n\nCorrelation analyses of vision measures and fMRI data\nTo study possible correlations between objective oculomotor measures and fMRI data, task fMRI activation maps (beta weights) were averaged, for each subject, within brain areas showing significant response to our task using only the control group. (Defining the regions by significant contrast between the groups would result in inflated correlations because of selection bias of voxels sensitive to group differences).\n24\nWith this approach, six brain clusters were identified, which include the lingual gyrus (bilateral), middle occipital gyrus (bilateral), cuneus (right) and tuber of vermis (right).\n\nStatistical methods\nComparisons between the OMD group and the control group were performed with the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and with the Wilcoxon test for continuous variables. The fMRI task activation (beta weights averaged for each subject over voxels in each of the clusters defined by where controls had significant activation) was associated with continuous vision metrics using the Spearman correlation. The non-parametric tests and correlations were used because of the small sample sizes and skewness in some measures. The statistical significance level is taken as 0.05 throughout."

    "Methods": "Drugs and chemicals\nWe collected TBI drugs from the clinicaltrial.gov web site (\nhttps://clinicaltrials.gov/\n) with \u201ctraumatic brain injury\u201d as the keyword, and the corresponding drug target information from the DrugBank and ChEMBL databases. For example, progesterone was included because it had been evaluated in clinical trials for TBI treatment (clinical trials #NCT00822900 and #NCT01730443 in the clinicaltrials.gov database). It interacts with the progesterone receptor, estrogen receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor, kappa-type opioid receptor, and steroid 17-alpha-hydroxylase as reported in the DrugBank database. The detailed procedures can be found in our previously published work on AlzPlatform, CVDPlatform, StemCellCKB, and other chemogenomics databases.\n29\u201334\n\nDifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) induced by TBI, chemicals, and genetic perturbations\nDifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) of TBI were collected from commercial software Illumina BaseSpace (formerly Nextbio\u2122, Santa Clara, CA;\nhttp://www.nextbio.com\n). In BaseSpace, most of the raw gene expression datasets were from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\n). Only genes with\np\n-values <0.05 and absolute fold changes in their expressions >1.2 were considered as DEGs. The TBI gene expression datasets were selected by keyword searches (\u201ctraumatic brain injury,\u201d \u201cintracranial trauma,\u201d \u201ccraniocerebral trauma,\u201d \u201cbrain injury, traumatic,\u201d \u201cbrain trauma,\u201d and \u201ctrauma brain damage\u201d) and were refined by only keeping datasets of TBI versus sham injury or ipsilateral to injury site versus contralateral site. The DEGs of TBI datasets were used as input to search against other gene expression datasets in BaseSpace for identifying the top most associated gene profiles induced by drugs through the integrated Pharmaco Atlas search or genetic perturbations through Knockdown Atlas search. Pharmaco Atlas archives DEGs induced by drugs, whereas the Knockdown Atlas stores the DEGs caused by gene knockdown, knockout, mutation, or overexpression. The searching algorithm for gene signature (i.e., the pattern of DEGs) associations is described in the following section.\n\nCalculation of gene signature correlation\nThe calculations of correlation between DEGs were performed using a modified form of rank-based enrichment statistics implemented in BaseSpace software.\n35\u201337\nBaseSpace pre-processed gene expression data with biomedical ontologies enables the comparison among heterogeneous datasets from different species. It also uses meta-analyses to provide consistent predictions from multiple instances of similar perturbations, such as the gene expression profiles from different cell lines induced by the same drug.\n37\nAll analyses by BaseSpace were performed utilizing the default parameters.\nFigure 1\nshows an example of a comparison between a TBI-induced gene signature and a dexamethasone-induced gene signature. (Detailed information for this example in\nSupplementary Tables 1\u20133\n; see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). We can see that TBI induced 415 DEGs (169 upregulated and 246 downregulated genes, respectively), whereas dexamethasone treatment induced 2022 DEGs (891 upregulated and 1131 downregulated genes, respectively). These two biosets share 50 DEGs in common, but most of the changes in gene expression are in opposite directions (i.e., they negatively correlate) and the overlap\np\n-value is 0.0031. In addition, pathway enrichment analysis can be done by calculating the associations between TBI-induced DEGs and genes in the pathways from different databases, such as MSigDBand GO.\n38\n,\n39\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nAn example of comparison of gene expression profiles showing a negative association between the TBI-induced and dexamethasone-induced profiles.

    "Methods": "Study design and participants\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pittsburgh. We assessed 82 adults with severe TBI (\nn\n=\u200965 men and\nn\n=\u200917 women) recruited through our level 1 trauma center. Participants had a GCS score of \u22648 and received standard care as outlined in\nThe Guidelines for the Management of Severe Brain Injury\n. Participants were between 16 and 73 years of age. Additional inclusion criteria included positive findings on head computed tomography (CT) and extraventricular drainage catheter placement for intracranial pressure monitoring. Subjects with a penetrating brain injury, history of hypothalamic or pituitary tumors, history of breast cancer necessitating chemotherapy, history of prostate cancer necessitating orchiectomy or LH suppression agents, or untreated thyroid disease were excluded.\nDemographic variables such as age, sex, and race were collected. Clinical variables included mechanism of injury, GCS (best in 24\u2009h),\n30\nnon-head Injury Severity Score (ISS),\n31\nlength of hospital stay, hospital complications, and admission CT findings assessing brain injury type. Hospital complications were grouped by system assessed and included pulmonary, infectious disease, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, hematological (HEME), renal, wounds, gastrointestinal, neurological, and other complications. In addition, mortality status was determined at one month post-injury by extracting date of death from the Social Security Death Index.\n32\nControl subjects (\nn\n=\u200911 men and\nn\n=\u200921 women), who did not have a history of endocrine dysfunction and were not taking hormone replacement therapy or contraceptives, were enrolled for a single serum sample collection. Demographic information collected from controls at the time of blood draw included age, sex, and race. We assessed mortality at 30 days as a measure of acute care hospital-based outcomes given previously reported mean acute hospital stays of three to five weeks after severe TBI\n33\n,\n34\nand given that most deaths in this cohort occurred within this time frame.\n\nSample collection and hormone measurements\nBlood samples were collected daily from enrolled TBI subjects during the first three days post-injury. On collection, samples were centrifuged, aliquoted, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until the time of assay. Serum hormone assessments for E2 (\nn\n=\u2009324 samples) and T (\nn\n=\u2009320 samples) were measured using radioimmunoassay with the Coat-A-Count\n\u00ae\nIn-Vitro Diagnostic Test Kit (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostic). Kits included a solid-phase\n125\nI radioimmunoassay and were designed for direct, quantitative measurement of each serum hormone. Serum hormone assessments for A (\nn\n=\u2009228 samples) and E1 (\nn\n=\u2009205 samples) were measured using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (DRG International, Springfield, NJ). The interassay and intra-assay coefficients of variance were <15%, and any samples that fell below the detection limit were assigned the value of the detection limit for the respective assay. Subjects who had at least one serum sample in the first 0\u20133 days were included in graphical and statistical analyses.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were computed using SAS software (version 9.4. SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Means and standard error of the mean (SE) were calculated for all continuous variables. Categorical variables were summarized using frequencies and percentages. Associations between continuous variables and differences between categories were determined using the Mann-Whitney test. Associations between categorical variables were assessed using the chi-square analysis and Fisher exact test where appropriate.\nIn cases where multiple samples were obtained within a particular day for a given individual, daily mean levels were first calculated to generate a day 0, day 1, day 2, and day 3 mean value for each hormone. E2:A and E1:T ratios were then calculated by day to evaluate temporal trends with aromatization pathway intermediates/products, characterized by E2:A ratios, and also the production of aromatization intermediates. After inspecting these profiles, E2:A ratios were then averaged over 0\u20133 days to evaluate this ratio as an informative time-averaged marker reflecting mortality. Quartiles were initially assessed for E2:A levels; there was a higher percentage of non-survivors in quartiles three and four compared with quartiles one and two (20 vs. 11). Thus, E2:A was dichotomized at the median, with E2:A ratios above and below the 50th percentile representing\nhigh aromatization\nand\nlow aromatization,\nrespectively. E2:A ratios were used as an index from which to identify high versus low-aromatization risk groups and assess their mortality risk. Average daily hormone levels for A, T, E1, E2, and E1:T were compared by aromatization group. Average hormone levels for control subjects were also graphed to serve as a reference group.\nA Kaplan-Meier survival curve was generated to test the potential association between E2:A ratio and time to 30-day mortality. The log-rank statistic was used to compare survival rates among those above and below the median E2:A ratio. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was then generated to identify relationships between E2:A ratio and mortality status while adjusting for covariates. All the independent variables that were included were tested for the assumption of proportional hazards before inclusion in the model. The independent variables and covariates were first analyzed in a bivariate analysis before inclusion in the multivariable model and were selected\na priori\nbased on previous literature.\n35\nAll main effects were tested for interactions with E2:A ratios, and significant interaction terms were included in the multi-variable model. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals are reported for all main effects and interactions in the multivariable model. Logistic regression models to 30-day mortality were generated to assess the area under the curve (AUC) statistic to describe model prognostication."

    "Methods": "Study design and population\nParticipants were recruited as a part of a larger study examining genetic associations with TBI outcomes, some of whom have been included in previous candidate gene associated studies evaluating PTE.\n7\n,\n8\n,\n10\nAs presented in\nFigure 1\n, patients aged 18\u201375 from consecutive admissions to a level 1 trauma center with sTBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score \u22648), positive head computed tomography findings, and requiring extraventricular drainage catheter placement for intracranial pressure management were screened for participation. Exclusion criteria included penetrating head injury, prolonged cardiac or respiratory arrest before admission, or inability to obtain legal proxy consent.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nConsort diagram representing the cohort used for analysis.\nAnalyses were limited to individuals categorized as White by self/proxy-report (\nn\n=\u200925 participants excluded) because of racial differences in allelic frequency obtained from the database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP:\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp\n). Participants with a pre-morbid history of seizure (\nn\n=\u20095) were also excluded because of an inability to attribute seizure to injury or pre-existing pathology. The total number of participants analyzed was N\u2009=\u2009260. The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board approved this study.\n\nCritical care management\nParticipants were admitted to the neurotrauma intensive care unit at our level 1 trauma center and received treatment consistent with the Guidelines for the Management of Severe Head Injury.\n17\nStandard care consisted of early extraventricular drain (EVD) placement and central venous and arterial catheters. Further surgical intervention was pursued when clinically indicated. Intermittent electroencephalograms were obtained by treating physicians as part of standard-of-care when there was clinical concern for non-convulsive seizures. Most participants received anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) for the first week post-injury.\n\nDemographic and injury related data\nDemographic and injury data were documented at enrollment. Intracranial pathology type was assigned one of seven distinct categories based on radiologic findings using the\nInternational Classification of Diseases,\nNinth Edition. These categories were divided by injury type (present or absent) and were not mutually exclusive. Admission GCS score was used to establish study eligibility; however, the best GCS score during the first 24\u2009h after admission was used as a covariate in analyses. Injury Severity score (without injury to head and neck) was obtained from medical records to determine overall body injury measure of extracerebral trauma, based on survivability of injuries within and across body regions. The electronic medical records (EMR) were reviewed to identify AED use for early seizure prophylaxis during acute care.\n\nGenetics protocol\nDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted either from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), collected via passive drainage, using a QIAamp DNA extraction protocol (Qiagen) or from whole blood using a salting out procedure. DNA samples were genotyped using iPLEX Gold SNP Assay (Sequenom). Tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for\nSLC1A2\n(\nn\n=\u200921) and\nSLC1A3\n(\nn\n=\u200918) were evaluated based on data available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, HapMap Build 36. The major and minor allele designations, as well as the minor allele frequency, are presented in\nSupplementary Table 1\n(see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) \u226520% were selected to optimize heterozygosity and to assess common variants among unrelated individuals. Identified SNPs captured genetic variability including 1000 bases 5\u2032 upstream into the promoter region. Double-masked genotype assignments were created for each SNP, and discrepancies were reviewed using raw data or re-genotyping. Blinded duplicates of assays were included for quality control. SNP genotypes with\nSLC1A2\nand\nSLC1A3\nvariability were evaluated for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), MAF, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) specific to the study population using Haploview\n18\n(\nFig. 2A,B\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nHaploview generated gene map displaying linkage disequilibrium (D\u2032) for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on\nSLC1A2\n(\nA\n) and\nSLC1A3\n(\nB\n). Deeper red colors are indicative of greater D\u2032 values. SNP meeting threshold significance on\nSLC1A3\nis highlighted with red square.\n\nOutcome measure: PTS\nThe primary outcome of interest was time to first seizure after TBI. We reviewed electronic inpatient and outpatient medical records available from our medical center to obtain PTS status. Date of first seizure was recorded based on ambulance and/or emergency department report, inpatient progress or nursing note, electroencephalography (EEG) report, patient history, or discharge and transfer summaries. Medical record notation referring to convulsions, seizures, status epilepticus, or seizure disorder was considered evidence of seizure occurrence. Notation of possible seizure activity that was either ambiguous or non-conclusive was categorized as no PTS. Date of death was obtained from medical records or from social security death data (\nhttp://www.ssa.gov/sitemap.htm\n). Participants were followed until date of first seizure or date of death. Follow-up was censored at three years post-injury. Primary analyses examined all seizures through three years post-injury.\nPost hoc\nanalysis compared genetic associations with immediate/early PTS versus late PTS (i.e., post-traumatic epilepsy [PTE]). Late PTS was left censored at seven days post-injury to compare with immediate/early PTS. For this\npost hoc\nanalysis, participants who had a seizure (\nn\n=\u200919) or died (\nn\n=\u200936) during the first week post-injury were also excluded, leaving N\u2009=\u2009212 for analysis.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSAS-9.4 (Cary, NC) and R-3.0.2 were used to complete analyses. All genotyped participants who met eligibility criteria were included. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between individuals with and without PTS using chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests when appropriate. Descriptive statistics are presented in three groups: no seizure, immediate/early seizure (within the first seven days post-injury), and late seizure (beginning after seven days post-injury). Among individuals with PTS, chi-square analyses were conducted, using the Fisher exact test as appropriate, to determine whether genotype frequencies differed by time of first seizure (i.e., early and late).\nTo test the primary hypothesis regarding genetic variation and post-TBI epileptogenesis over a three-year period, time-to-event analyses were performed. Because of LD, or correlation among selected SNPs, the number of effective number of tests conducted was smaller than the number of SNPs screened. The minimum number of effective tests (M\neff\n) was calculated using methods based on eigenvalues.\n19\nThe M\neff\nwas calculated for each gene and generated a M\neff\nof 9.9 for\nSLC1A2\nand 6.7 for\nSLC1A3\n. A Bonferroni correction was then applied to the original \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05 using the M\neff\nas the number of independent tests for each gene for subsequent time-to-event analyses. This adjustment corresponded to a threshold for significance of \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.005 and 0.007 for\nSLC1A2\nand\nSLC1A3\n, respectively.\nOn visual inspection of the data, there was a dominant pattern of seizure incidence for minor allele carriers; therefore, genotypes were grouped by minor allele carriers versus major allele homozygotes. All bivariate and multi-variate analyses are presented with significant SNPs classified by minor allele carrier status.\nSeizure rates were estimated at three years post-injury, considering the full follow-up period (i.e., time of injury through three years post-TBI), for individual SNPs by minor-allele carrier status using Kaplan-Meier curves. Log-rank statistics were used to compare rates. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for minor-allele grouped SNPs that had significant Kaplan-Meier estimated PTS rates based on Bonferroni corrected\np\nvalues. Cox regression models were adjusted for demographic and injury characteristics that differed significantly by seizure status (no seizure, immediate/early, and late seizure) or that have been shown previously to impact PTS incidence. Proportionality over time assumptions were assessed for all variables by examining correlations of Schoenfeld residuals with time for all included independent variables in the Cox regression model. If a given covariate did not pass the proportionality assumption, it was stratified in the Cox regression model. Time-to-event analyses were repeated for\npost hoc\nanalysis evaluating risk for PTE."

From the total two cohorts of rats, a subset (\nn\n=\u20097/group) was also tested at 35 days post-injury to determine if temporary silencing produced any lasting effects on limb function, and was then used to determine contusion size by histology at 40 days. A number of these injured rats (11 muscimol-injected, 3 aCSF-injected) were used to confirm right cortical inactivation due to muscimol after behavior at 5\u20136 weeks post-injury by recording fMRI activation data elicited by electrical stimulation of the left forelimb before and after brain infusion (\nFig. 1A\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental overview.\n(A)\nTime line of the experimental paradigm for behavior and fMRI before or after muscimol or aCSF infusion.\n(B)\nA stylized figure to represent an overview of the locations of the injury and muscimol drug injection sites, and the nomenclature used to describe the brain regions (ipsilesional\u2009=\u2009primary injured hemisphere; contralesional\u2009=\u2009less affected hemisphere opposite to the primary-injured hemisphere) and limb stimulations (muscimol-affected left limb and injury-affected right limb. aCSF, artificial cerebrospinal fluid; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; Inj, injury; Mus, muscimol.\n\nBrain injury and cannula placement\nAll study protocols were approved by the University of California, Los Angeles (Los Angeles, CA) Chancellor's Animal Research Committee and adhered to the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The method for induction of moderate CCI injury was performed as previously described.\n3\n,\n18\n,\n22\u201324\nBriefly, rats (220\u2013250\u2009g in body weight) were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane vaporized in O\n2\nflowing at 0.8\u2009L/min and placed on a homeostatic temperature-controlled blanket while being maintained in a stereotactic frame. CCI was produced using a 4-mm diameter impactor tip that was advanced through a 6-mm craniotomy (centered at 0\u2009mm bregma and 3\u2009mm left lateral to the sagittal suture) onto the brain using a 20-psi pressure pulse and to a deformation depth of 2\u2009mm below the dural surface. Care was taken to prevent heat damage to the brain during drilling of the craniotomy by cooling the skull with sterile saline (0.9%).\nImmediately following CCI injury, a permanent, in-dwelling plastic cannula (0.46\u2009mm outer diameter, Plastics One Inc., Roanoke, VA) was placed into the contralesional homotopic primary sensory forelimb (S1-FL) cortex, an area that overlaps with the caudal forelimb cortex.\n25\n,\n26\nUsing stereotaxic coordinates from Paxinos and Watson's rat atlas data,\n27\na 0.8-mm burr hole was drilled in the skull above the S1-FL area using the following coordinates, and based on our previous functional MRI data\n7\n: +3.5\u2009mm lateral, +0.5\u2009mm rostral relative to bregma, and 2.5\u2009mm below the outer skull surface. After carefully incising the dura with a 27-guage needle, the cannula was advanced into the center of the S1-Fl area and secured to the skull with cyanoacrylate gel glue and dental cement. The craniotomy was then sealed with a layer of non-bioreactive, Kwik-Cast silicon elastomer (Sarasota, FL) and the scalp was re-sutured and covered with a layer of bupivicaine local anesthetic solution and triple antibiotic ointment. Animals were placed in a recovery chamber with ambient temperature maintained at \u223c28\u00b0C until they had awoken from anesthesia and then they were returned to their home cages. No mortalities occurred due to acute post-traumatic complications.\n\nCortical silencing\nImmediately after surgery, injured animals were randomized (\nrandomizer.org\n) into two groups: muscimol or aCSF. After behavioral testing on post-injury days 6 and 27, the following day (day 7 and 28), rats were re-anesthetized for 15\u2009min with light sedation (isoflurane 1.5% in oxygen) and S1-FL cortex activity was temporarily silenced by infusion of 1\u2009\u03bcL of the GABA\nA\nchannel receptor agonist muscimol (1\u03bcg/\u03bcL in aCSF vehicle) through the cannula over a period of 10\u2009min using a 5-\u03bcL syringe connected to an infusion pump (Stoelting, IL). This has previously been shown to inactivate a region 1\u20132\u2009mm from the injection site.\n17\nVehicle-treated control rats received equivalent volume of aCSF (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) by the same injection procedure. The cannula was sealed with a dust cap (Plastics One Inc., Roanoke, VA). Following recovery from sedation, post-injection behavioral assessment was performed within 30\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u2009min, well within the 2-h window during which muscimol levels remain in the region.\n17\n\nFunctional MRI\nForelimb-evoked fMRI was conducted at 5\u20136 weeks post-injury as described previously,\n7\nbefore and within 1\u2009h after muscimol or aCSF infusion (35 and 40 days post-injury, respectively) using a 7-Tesla Bruker Biospec spectrometer and a single channel receiver radiofrequencey coil actively decoupled from a whole body transmit coil (\nFig. 1B\n). Briefly, blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI data were acquired under medetomidine sedation (0.05mg/kg intravenously followed by 0.1\u2009mg/kg constant subcutaneous infusion) using a 1-shot echo-planar, gradient-recalled echo sequence (repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE]\u2009=\u20092000/30\u2009msec) using a 128\u2009\u00d7\u200964 data matrix over a 3-cm\n2\nfield of view and 14\u2009\u00d7\u20090.75-mm contiguous image slices. Data were acquired over three 40-sec periods of electrical stimulation of the left forelimb (3.5\u2009mA, 10\u2009Hz) interleaved with 60-sec rest periods. A two-dimensional rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence was used to collect T2-weighted images with the following parameters: TR\u2009=\u20096018\u2009msec, TE\u2009=\u200956\u2009msec, RARE factor\u2009=\u20098, and using the same geometry as used for the fMRI protocol, except a data matrix of 128-read\u2009\u00d7\u2009128-phase-encoding steps. Functional data were entered into the FEAT analysis pipeline,\n28\n,\n29\nbrain extracted, motion and slice-timing corrected, smoothed to 0.5\u2009mm, registered to a template rat brain using the RARE data, and processed to determine statistical differences between pre-injection on post-injury day 35 and post-muscimol or aCSF data on post-injury day 40. Statistical maps were computed using a paired\nt\ntest for muscimol pre/post-injection data that were cluster thresholded at\nz\n=\u20091.7 and\np\n<\u20090.01 family-wise error corrected, whereas aCSF data were thresholded at\nz\n=\u20091.7 and\np\n<\u20090.01 uncorrected given the low group size.\n\nAssessment of forelimb function\nPrior to injury, rats were habituated and trained in a staircase forelimb reaching/pellet retrieval apparatus\n21\n(Lafayette Instruments, Lafayette, IN) for 1 and 2 weeks, respectively, until they reached 60% reaching success rate on both limbs, as with prior studies.\n24\nWe did not account for handedness among the rats and used all those that reached above 60% success, regardless of hand preference, by week 3, after which left cortex injury was immediately conducted. The number of steps cleared of sugar pellets within a 10-min period (pellet retrieved and eaten) is used as an objective measure of forelimb skilled-reaching ability. The number of pellets dropped is used as a measure of unskilled limb performance. Two trials were run for each rat per testing day and the results were averaged. Each trial was video-recorded for offline analysis. Reaching dexterity was assessed offline on a frame-by-frame basis. The reviewer was blinded to the treatment group and was asked to count the number of pellets eaten and dropped, and the total number of attempted reaches with each forelimb. An unsuccessful attempt was counted when a rat reached for a pellet inside a stairwell and then closed its digits in a grasping effort, but ultimately failed to hold and eat the pellet. The number of pellets eaten divided by the total attempts was used as a measure of reaching accuracy. The number of pellets dropped divided by the total number of reaching attempts was used as a measure of reaching inaccuracy. We consider that these normalized values provide a more precise measure of dexterity and sensory function compared with the pellets eaten and dropped, because it accounts for how much difficulty the rat had in aiming for and grasping each pellet.\n\nHistology\nAt 40 days post-injury all rats were terminally anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100mg/kg intraperitoneally [IP]) and then transcardially perfused-fixed with 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were post-fixed overnight, cryoprotected in 20% sucrose in PBS for \u223c24\u2009h at 4\u00b0C, sectioned at 50\u2009\u03bcm, collected onto gelatinized microscope slides, stained with thionin, cleared in Citrisolv (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ), and cover-slipped using Cytoseal 60 (Richard Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI). Eight mounted sections, 650\u2009\u03bcm apart, were used to measure contusion volume by determining the left-right hemispheric difference in tissue volume using Stereoinvestigator software (Microbrightfield, Inc., Williston, VT). At this time post-injury, gross tissue atrophy and resolution of edema has already occurred, making the requirement for boundary criteria with which to judge the edge of the tissue far easier than at earlier times post-injury. As a result, the absolute tissue edge of all remaining tissue was used to delineate total hemispheric cortical gray + white matter, where white matter was the corpus callosum and external capsule. The difference between the hemispheric cortical areas was used as a measure of contusion area/section, which was multiplied by the intersection distance to obtain an estimate of contusion volume.\n\nStatistical analysis\nGroup data were tested for equal variances and departure from normality using Levene's test for homogeneity and the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, respectively (R version 3.3.1, car and stats packages, respectively). The majority of the data were non-normality distributed and so the penalized quasi-likeihood method\n30\nwas implemented to model the data, which were transformed to best fit a log-normal distribution, and using generalized linear mixed modeling for testing of statistical inference (R functionglmmPQL from the MASS package).\n31\nThis method is a flexible technique that can deal with non-normal data, unbalanced designs, and crossed, random effects. An additive model was shown to be optimal using the Akaike information criterion, with group, time, and group\u2009\u00d7\u2009time assigned as fixed effects, and rat as a random effect. Acute (pre-injury to 7 days post-injury) and chronic injections (28\u201335 days post-injury) were considered as independent processes given the return of limb function to pre-injection levels in the time elapsed after the first injection to the second, and so were tested separately. Post hoc testing was calculated using the LSMEANS package\n32\nwith adjustment for multiple comparisons using Tukey's method. Adjusted probability (\np\n) values are cited in the text along with the corresponding\nt\nstatistic and degrees of freedom. Correlation analysis and calculation of the coefficient of determination (R\n2\n) were implemented using GraphPad version 7.04 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) on raw, untransformed data."

    "Methods": "Ethical approval\nAll procedures were approved by the University of Massachusetts Medical School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nExperimental design and animals\nThis pre-clinical study was designed to characterize the incidence of concussive CSD and its relation to histological and functional outcome. To this end, spontaneously breathing male C57BL6/J mice (\nn\n=\u200962, Jackson Laboratories) weighing 27.5\u2009\u00b1\u20096.0\u2009g (age 8\u201312 weeks) underwent closed head TBI with a 50\u2009g weight (\nn\n=\u200945), 25\u2009g weight (\nn\n=\u200911), or sham injury (\nn\n=\u20096). The 50\u2009g TBI paradigm was chosen based on our previous observations that this closed-head injury produces a mild, concussive TBI as based on the mild severity of neurological deficits, presence of traumatic axonal injury, but absent macroscopic brain injury consistent with human concussion.\n7\n,\n18\n,\n23\nWe included a sham group to control for potential nonimpact related confounders such as anesthesia and analgesia and a milder 25\u2009g TBI paradigm to determine whether the impact severity is an important determinant for CSD.\nWe excluded two 25\u2009g mice and three 50\u2009g mice because the Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) probe dislodged after impact. LDF was used to assess the temporal evolution of the relative regional CBF in all included mice (\nn\n=\u200957). Seven mice that underwent 50\u2009g TBI had a femoral artery catheter placed to assess continuously the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) concurrently with the CBF. These animals were sacrificed immediately after the completion of CBF measurements and were not included in the neurological and histological analyses. In addition, we assessed CBF over the contralesional, nontraumatized hemisphere in six mice that underwent 50\u2009g TBI. These mice were also excluded from behavioral and histological analyses.\nNeurobehavioral deficits were determined from acute to subacute time points utilizing the Neurological Severity Score (NSS), which has been validated to determine neurological sequelae in the used closed head mouse TBI model.\n18\nTUNEL staining was conducted to determine histological damage after TBI in a subset of mice that underwent sham injury (\nn\n=\u20096) and 50\u2009g TBI (n\u2009=\u200918). Prussian blue staining was obtained from a subset of mice that underwent 25\u2009g TBI (\nn\n=\u20096) and 50\u2009g TBI (\nn\n=\u200912).\nFinally, we conducted exploratory cortical optical intrinsic signal (COIS) imaging in a subset of mice for qualitative assessment of the temporospatial dynamics of post-concussive CBF (\nn\n=\u20096 for 25\u2009g TBI;\nn\n=\u20095 for 50\u2009g TBI).\nSupplementary Figure 1\n(see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n) summarizes the study design. All analyses were conducted by investigators masked to the experimental group. This article was prepared in adherence to the ARRIVE guidelines.\n\nAnesthesia, analgesia, and TBI induction\nAnimals were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% for induction, 2% for surgical procedure, 1.5% for maintenance) in room air. Anesthesia was discontinued immediately before TBI and sham injury. Body temperature was monitored continuously with a rectal probe and maintained at 37.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C. To alleviate pain, animals received 0.05\u2009mg/kg subcutaneous buprenorphine (Patterson Veterinary, Devens, MA) 30\u2009min before the end of anesthesia and every 6\u2009h afterward for 24\u2009h. In addition, each animal received 5\u2009mg/kg subcutaneous carprofen (Patterson Veterinary, Devens, MA) at the end of the anesthesia.\nClosed head TBI was produced using a weight drop device as described previously in detail.\n18\nBriefly, the skull was exposed to allow for visualization of the sutures as landmarks for consistent impact relative to bregma (-2.5\u2009mm in rostrocaudal and 2.5\u2009mm lateral distance). Anesthesia was discontinued, and the animal was positioned on a 6.4\u2009mm thick ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber surface (60 durometer hardness) with the head placed under the weight drop device. A weight (25\u2009g or 50\u2009g) was dropped freely 15\u2009cm to strike a cylindrical polyacetal transducer rod (Delrin,\n\u00a9\ntip-diameter 2\u2009mm, 17.4\u2009g) that was placed with its tip directly on the mouse's skull under the tip at an angle of 90 degrees. Holding the transducer rod with one hand immediately after the initial impact prevented rebound impact. After TBI, skulls were examined for potential fracture and the wound closed with interrupted sutures. Sham animals were anesthetized, surgically prepared, and placed under the impact device, but were not subjected to injury.\n\nCBF\nThe CBF was measured in animals using a PR407-1 straight needle LDF-probe (Perimed, J\u00e4rf\u00e4lla, Stockholm, Sweden) connected to a standard laser Doppler monitor (PF5010 LDPM Unit and PF5001 main unit, Perimed, J\u00e4rf\u00e4lla, Stockholm, Sweden). The probe was placed either over the ipsilateral traumatized (\nn\n=\u200945), contralateral nontraumatized (\nn\n=\u20096), or ipsilateral sham operated (\nn\n=\u20096) hemisphere (approximately 3\u2009mm posterior, 6\u2009mm lateral, and 1\u2009mm ventral to the bregma) on the intact lateral aspect of the skull to assess CBF.\n18\nA stable baseline was established and recorded for 15\u2009min, TBI was induced, anesthesia resumed after return of regular spontaneous breathing, and CBF continuously assessed for up to 90\u2009min. For analysis, values were averaged across 5\u2009sec epochs from baseline to 10\u2009min after TBI and then across 1\u2009min epochs at designated time points afterward. In addition, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the CBF measured during the first 60\u2009min of observation. All CBF data were normalized to baseline for statistical comparisons.\n\nCOIS imaging\nTo characterize the temporospatial hemodyamics after concussive TBI, we conducted exploratory COIS imaging based on the cortical light reflectance through the intact skull. Details regarding the principle underlying COIS and its use for the detection of CSD in mice have been described previously.\n24\nIn brief, after midline incision and scalp reflection, the intact skull overlying both hemispheres was covered with a thin layer of mineral oil to prevent drying and enhance transparency. Images were obtained continuously every 2\u2009sec from pre-TBI to 30\u2009min post-TBI using a 3.1 megapixel microscope digital camera (Model #300MU-CK, AmScope, Irvine, CA). Raw images (10\u2009\u00d7\u2009; 2048\u2009\u00d7\u20091536 resolution) were converted off-line to inverted gray scale (arbitrary units) and by subtracting each image from the subsequent image to highlight temporal changes using Matlab (version R2016a, MathWorks, Natick, MA).\n\nNeurologic evaluation\nPresence of seizure activity was evaluated clinically (facial twitching as well as tail, forelimb, and hindlimb tonic-clonic or tonic movements) as described previously.\n18\nBecause all seizures occurred while animals were still unconscious, no attempt was undertaken to grade seizure severity according to previously developed grading scales as these are partially based on loss of posture in previously conscious animals.\n18\n,\n25\nSternal recumbency was measured as the time (s) from TBI/sham injury to righting from a supine to prone position after discontinuation of anesthesia.\nThe NSS was assessed before TBI as well as at 2\u2009h, 24\u2009h, and 48\u2009h post-operatively as described previously in detail.\n18\nBriefly, the NSS consists of 10 individual clinical parameters, including tasks on motor function, alertness, and physiological behavior, and examines sensorimotor integration scored on a scale from 0 (no deficit) to 10 (maximal deficit), whereby scores from three to four indicate mild TBI.\n18\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were perfused under isoflurane anesthesia through the ascending aorta with 50\u2009mL saline and then with ice cold phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10\u2009min. Brains were removed from the cranium, post-fixed overnight in the same fixative, and then stored in 0.4% PFA at 4\u00b0C until further processing. Before paraffin embedding, brains were coronally pre-sectioned using a brain matrix. Histological paraffin sections, 10-\u03bcm thick, were obtained from a slice below the impact site and evaluated with immunohistochemistry. All histological analyses were performed by an investigator masked to the animal group (N.H.).\nTo assess cell death, the\nin situ\nCell Death Detection Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Billerica, MA) was used following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were imaged at 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification to quantify the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)/4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) co-stained cells. To this end, all TUNEL/DAPI co-stained cells were systematically counted in the entire coronal section using nonoverlapping fields of view (FOV). Counts were conducted in two adjacent sections (100\u2009\u03bcm apart) obtained at the level of bregma and averaged for both sections to provide the final count. Cells were counted separately for the corpus callosum, caudate putamen, and the cerebral cortex. Note that for presentation purpose, image contrast and brightness of the histological figures was enhanced by using Photoshop's nonlinear curve function across the entire image.\n\nCerebral microbleed detection\nSections were stained for Prussian blue reaction using an Iron Stain Kit (# HT20, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, slides were deparaffinized and hydrated to deionized water, immersed in a freshly prepared solution of equal parts 5% potassium ferrocyanide and 5% hydrochloric acid for 10\u2009min, rinsed with deionized water, immersed in 2% pararosaniline solution for 5\u2009min, rinsed with deionized water, and then rapidly dehydrated and coverslipped.\nTo assess for microhemorrhages, samples were imaged at 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification and all Prussian blue positive profiles systematically counted separately for the entire left (nontraumatized) and right (traumatized) coronal section using nonoverlapping FOVs. Counts were conducted in one section obtained approximately at 0.25\u2009mm and \u22120.75 from bregma, respectively. To describe the distribution of cerebral microbleeds within each hemisphere, we conceptually divided each coronal hemisection into three regions of interest: (1) dorsal, (2) lateral, and (3) deep (see\nFig. 5C\n). The number of Prussian blue positive profiles per section and their approximate location within each section was recorded for each mouse. In addition, we recorded the presence of microbleeds within the subarachnoid space; however, these were not counted toward the number of Prussian blue profiles. Images of positively stained sections were taken using an Olympus BX53 microscope and Soft-Imaging System with Olympus Cell Sens software version 1.18 (Olympus, Waltham, MA).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 5.\nCortical spreading depression (CSD) is associated with worse functional deficit recovery. (\nA\n) Significantly greater relative Neurological Severity Score (NSS) recovery from the 2\u2009h time point was observed in mice without a CSD as compared to mice with a CSD (\np\n=\u20090.027 for group effects (DF\u2009=\u20091, F\u2009=\u20095.5);\np\n<\u20090.0001 for time effects (DF\u2009=\u20092, F\u2009=\u200934.4); two-way RM analysis of variance [ANOVA]). There was no significant group\u2009\u00d7\u2009time interaction (\np\n=\u20090.078, DF\u2009=\u20092, F\u2009=\u20092.7) indicating a similar rate of recovery over time, however. (\nB\n) Mice with and without CSD lost weight to a similar degree over the course of the first 48\u2009h (\np\n=\u20090.93 for group effects (DF\u2009=\u20091, F\u2009<\u20090.01);\np\n<\u20090.0001 for time effects (DF\u2009=\u20092, F\u2009=\u200955.0);\np\n=\u20090.54 for group\u2009\u00d7\u2009time interaction (DF\u2009=\u20092, F\u2009=\u20090.6); two-way RM ANOVA). (\nC\n) Similar time to regaining sternal recumbency after the end of anesthesia in a subset of mice with (\nn\n=\u200912) versus without (\nn\n=\u20098) a CSD (\np\n=\u20090.75,\nt\n=\u2009-0.32, DF\u2009=\u200918; Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest).\n#\np\n<\u20090.05; *\np\n<\u20090.05 versus baseline; n.s.\u2009=\u2009not significant. Color image is available online.\n\nStatistical analysis\nUnless otherwise stated, continuous variables are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation, and categorical variables are reported as proportions. Normality of data was examined using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Between-group comparisons for continuous (body weight, CBF, blood pressure, cell counts, sternal recumbency) and ordinal (relative and absolute composite NSS) variables were made with unpaired\nt\ntest, paired\nt\ntest, Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Kruskal Wallis with\npost hoc\nDunn method, analysis of variance (ANOVA) on ranks, two-way ANOVA, two-way repeated measures ANOVA (two-way RM ANOVA), and two-way RM ANOVA on Ranks, as appropriate. The presence of subarachnoid microbleeds was compared using the Fisher exact test. Spearman rank correlation was used to assess the association between post-traumatic CBF and the neurological deficit severity. Two-sided significance tests were used throughout, and a two-sided\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SigmaPlot 12.5 (Systat Software, Inc., Germany) or IBM\n\u00ae\nSPSS\n\u00ae\nStatistics 22 (IBM\n\u00ae\n-Armonk, NY)."

The first scan (baseline) was acquired at 49.67 (\u00b1 22) days post-injury, the second scan at two, the third scan at six, the fourth scan at 12, and the fifth scan at 24 months after injury. The images on the first four time points were acquired using a 3T Magnetom Verio (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany), and for measurements on the fifth time point, the scanner was upgraded to a 3T Magnetom Skyra\nfit\n. We used a 16-channel radiofrequency receive head and neck coil in combination with a spine matrix coil.\nTrained radiographers positioned all participants in the same supine position for each scan. Image acquisition over five time points was completed successfully in 14 patients and in 18 healthy controls. One patient died of causes unrelated to SCI after the second time point. A total of 156 MRI datasets were analyzed from 33 participants. All T1-weighted 3D-MPARGE images acquired from subjects were included in the VBM analysis.\n20\n,\n21\n\nBrain volume\nGlobal tissue volumes for GM, WM, and CSF at each time point were calculated using the segmented T1-weighted images with applying unified segmentation,\n23\nand the total ICV was expressed as the sum of volumes of all tissue classes. A previously established global measure of CSF volume is the CSF volume-to-ICV (CSF/ICV) ratio, calculated as the CSF volume divided by total brain volume (sum of GM, WM, and CSF) to adjust for intersubject differences in brain size.\n24\nCSF/ICV ratio is used as a global atrophy marker associated with CSF volume.\nTo assess local change of CSF volume over time, longitudinal VBM was applied within SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging). Diffeomorphic registration was applied for longitudinal MRI, and resulting midpoint images were segmented,\n20\nNon-linear template generation and image normalization were performed using a geodesic shooting procedure.\n25\nThe template was affine registered to the standard brain template from Montreal Neurological Institute for all subsequent modeling steps. Consecutively, normalized CSF tissue segments from all subjects and time points were modulated by the Jacobian determinants encoding individual volume changes over time. Morphometric images were smoothed using Gaussian kernels of 6\u2009mm full width at half maximum. Subsequent modeling and analysis were performed for smoothed, normalized CSF segments within specific brain areas.\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo statistically assess cross-sectional and longitudinal changes of the CSF/ICV ratio, we used pairwise comparisons for each time point and linear mixed effects models with a group indicator and group by time interaction to assess changes over time using STATA 14 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX).\nTo assess group differences in trajectories of local CSF volume and ventricular enlargements, we followed a conservative two-stage summary statistics approach commonly used in fMRI and longitudinal image analysis. In a first stage, we estimated individual quadratic trajectory models y (t)\u2009=\u2009\u03b2\n0\n+ \u03b2\n1\nt + \u03b2\n2\nt\n2\nand obtained intercepts (\u03b2\n0\n), rate of change (\u03b2\n1\n), quadratic effects (\u03b2\n2\n), and time since injury (t) for all subjects in the sample independently. In a second stage, we used two-sample parametric\nt\ntests (for all voxels within each region of interest [ROI]), comparing the parameters across clinical groups, while adjusting for age and sex as covariates of no interest. Group differences of linear (e.g., \u03b2\n1\n< 0 indicating decline) and quadratic (e.g., \u03b2\n2\n> 0 indicating deceleration) effects were assessed using random field theory for correction of multiple comparisons within each considered ROI.\nThe associated\np\nvalues were corrected for multiple comparisons using family-wise error correction, and cluster significance was tested (after applying a cluster-forming\u2013threshold of 0.001), using Gaussian random field theory. Regression models were applied to determine associations between CSF volume and ventricular expansion and clinical outcomes over two years of follow-up. The mean age difference between patients and controls was not found to be statistically significant (\np\n=\u20090.071, Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest). However, age was included as a covariate of no interest in all statistical tests.\nFor CSF volume, we applied the six-month effect size to calculate estimates of the sample sizes necessary to detect a 100% treatment effect with 80% statistical power and 5% significant differences between healthy controls and patient group, by use of the standard formula based on two-group trials, assuming a baseline adjusted comparison of mean (analysis of covariance).\n26\nThe required Pearson correlation coefficient between baseline data and six-month CSF volume was estimated using the available data. The associations between MRI readouts (i.e., CSF/ICV ratio and ventricle enlargements) and clinical outcomes were investigated using regression model in SPM 12 and Stata 13."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale mice expressing hTau on a C57BL/6 and null murine tau background,\n24\n,\n25\n(aged 10\u201312 weeks, 20\u201324\u2009g, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were housed singly under standard laboratory conditions (23\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C, 50\u2009\u00b1\u20095% humidity, and 12-h light/dark cycle) with free access to food and water throughout the study. These hTau mice were generated by crossing mice that express a tau transgene derived from a human PAC, H1 haplotype, known as 8c mice,\n25\nwith tau knockout (KO) mice in which complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) for the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was inserted into exon one of tau. The resulting hTau mice express all six hTau isoforms, but do not express mouse tau.\n24\nOf note, the physiological tau isoform ratio (3R/4R) in the hTau mice is not 1:1 as in humans; rather, it is 4:1,\n24\nbut still closer to mimicking physiological occurrence of hTau than WT mice or other tau transgenic models that express single isoforms of either mutated or WT tau. All procedures were performed under Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval and in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nInjury groups and schedule\nFor the behavioral analyses, a total of 36 mice were assigned randomly to one of four treatment groups: single injury, single sham, repetitive injury (total of five hits with an interconcussion interval of 48\u2009h), and repetitive sham (five anesthesias, 48\u2009h apart). The behavior analysis began 24\u2009h or 12 months after the sole/last mTBI/anesthesia for each group. Behavior outcomes were assessed blinded to group assignment. After the acute time point of behavioral analyses, this cohort of mice was then allowed to survive for analyses at 6 and 12 months post-injury. One animal from the r-sham group died from natural cause before the last behavioral measurement. There was no mortality rate in either mTBI group. Separately from this behavioral cohort, two other cohorts of hTau animals were assigned for pathological (\nn\n=\u200920) and biochemical (\nn\n=\u200920) examination. As before, the animals were assigned randomly to one of the four treatment groups, with five mice per group for pathology and biochemistry. All mice for pathological and biochemical analyses were euthanized at 24\u2009h or 12 months post-sole/last mTBI/anesthesia.\n\nInjury protocol\nThe mTBI was administered to mice as described previously.\n14\nMice were anesthetized with 1.5\u2009L/min of oxygen and 3% isoflurane before anesthesia or mTBI. A 5\u2009mm blunt metal impactor tip was retracted and positioned midway relative to the sagittal suture before each impact. The injury was triggered using the myNeuroLab controller at a strike velocity of 5\u2009m/sec, strike depth of 1.0\u2009mm, and dwell time of 200\u2009msec. Sham injured animals underwent the same procedures and were exposed to anesthesia for the same length of time as the mTBI animals.\n\nAssessment of cognitive function\nLearning and memory were evaluated using Barnes maze and the Ethovision XT software (Noldus) by monitoring the distance and time taken to find an escape hole over a period of six acquisition days (learning) and a final probe trial (memory). During the acquisition trials, mice were given 90\u2009sec to locate and enter the target box. Mice were led to the target box if they did not locate it within 90\u2009sec, and all mice were required to remain in the target box for 30\u2009sec before retrieval, regardless of success. For a period of six days, four trials were given per day, with mice starting from one of four cardinal points on each trial. On the seventh day, a single probe trial lasting 60\u2009sec was performed with the mouse starting from the center of the maze and the target box removed.\n\nAssessment of anxiety\nAnxiety-related and risk-taking behavior of mice were evaluated using the elevated plus maze (EPM) test, which relies on the animal's preference for dark enclosed arms rather than brightly lit, open arms at an elevated height. Time spent in the open arm is decreased in mice that exhibit anxiety-like behaviors. The maze consisted of a polyvinyl chloride plus-shaped platform elevated 50\u2009cm from the floor with four arms intersecting at a 90-degree angle, creating four individual arms each 55\u2009cm long and 5\u2009cm wide. Closed and open arms were orthogonal to each other; the two closed arms were shielded by 25\u2009cm high side and end walls, whereas the two open arms had no walls.\nThe experimental procedure was initiated by the placement of the mouse into the center zone (intersection point) of the maze, facing one of the open arms. The mouse was allowed to explore the maze for a 5-min period while an overhead video camera recorded the movements of each mouse. Ethovision XT was used to automatically score, in an unbiased manner, the number of entries in each of the arms as well as the time spent in each arm. All four paws of the mouse had to enter an arm for it to be considered an entry; the percentage score for the time spent in the open arm was calculated as follows: (time spent in the open arms/ [time spent in the open arms + time spent in closed arms])\u2009\u00d7\u2009100.\n\nHistology\nAt 24\u2009h after their last injury/anesthesia, the mice assigned to histological studies were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 followed by PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. After perfusion, the brains were post-fixed in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C for 48\u2009h. The intact brains were then blocked and processed in paraffin using Tissue-Tek VIP (Sakura, Torrance, CA). Sagittal (\nn\n=\u20095 brains/group) and six \u03bcm sections were cut with a microtome (2030 Biocut, Reichert/Leica, Germany) and mounted on positively charged glass slides (Fisher, Superfrost Plus). Before staining, sections were deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in an ethanol to water gradient. For each group, sets of sagittal (lateral 0.2\u20130.4\u2009mm) sections were cut. Each slide was visualized with a bright field microscope (Leica, Germany), and digital images were taken for further analysis and quantification.\n\nImmunohistochemical quantification\nFor each animal, (\nn\n=\u20095 per group at 24\u2009h and 12 months post-mTBI), sagittal sections were stained and analyzed by an observer blinded to experimental conditions using ImageJ software (US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Using this software, images were separated into individual color channels (hematoxylin counter stain and diaminobenzidine [DAB]) using the color deconvolution algorithm. Three non-overlapping areas of 100\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nfor the body of the corpus callosum (CC) were selected randomly within which the area of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity was calculated and expressed as a percentage of the field of view (lateral 0.2\u20130.4\u2009mm). Four non-overlapping areas of 150\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nbetween layer III and IV in the primary somatosensory cortex, and three non-overlapping areas of 100\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nin the CC were selected randomly within which the area of anti-Iba1 immunoreactivity was calculated and expressed as a percentage of the field of view (lateral 0.2\u20130.4\u2009mm).\nThe extent of axonal injury was determined in amyloid precursor protein (APP) stained sections. APP immunoreactive axonal swellings were quantified from the caudal to the dorsal area of the body of the CC. Using ImageJ software, the average thickness of the CC was calculated as described previously. A total of five slides per animal were averaged for each immunohistochemical analysis.\nFor tau immunohistochemistry, sections were stained with the following monoclonal antibodies at a 1:400 dilution: CP13 (pS202); PHF1 (pS396/404); RZ3 (pT231) (\nFig. 1A\n). MC1 is a conformation-dependent antibody that reacts with both the N terminus (amino acids 7\u20139), and an amino acid sequence of tau in the third MTB (amino acids 313\u2013322) that is necessary for\nin vitro\nformation of filamentous aggregates of tau similar to those seen in AD\n28\n(\nFig. 1B\n). These Tau antibodies and protocols were generously provided by Dr. Peter Davies, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Bronx, NY. A summary of antibodies used for these neuropathological analyses is shown in\nTable 1\n. Changes in CP13 and RZ3 immunoreactivity were calculated and expressed as a percentage of the field of view within the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 and CA3 subregions of the hippocampus.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nTau phosphorylation sites for the antibodies used in this study (\nA\n). These phosphorylation sites are found both in normal brain and Alzheimer disease brains. MC1 recognizes a very specific early pathological tau conformation produced by the intramolecular association between the extreme N-terminus (aa7\u20139) and the third microtubule repeat domain (aa313\u2013322) of tau (\nB\n).

Immediately after cardiac puncture, mouse brains were perfused with chilled 1X phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for 1\u2009min to eliminate the confounding effects of blood proteins present in the brain vasculature. Brains were dissected at 4\u00b0C into hemispheres, then cortices, hippocampi, and cerebella, and then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.\nThe p-tau and total tau protein were analyzed in the hemisected hippocampi and cortices obtained from all groups (\nn\n=\u20095/group). Snap-frozen hemisected cortices and hippocampi were sonicated in 0.5\u2009mL and 0.3\u2009mL of chilled mammalian protein extraction reagent (M-PER) buffer solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Biochemical analyses were performed by our collaborators at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Bronx, NY, to whom we sent coded tissue homogenates for quantitative assessments. Sample preparation for low-tau sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitation of murine-specific tau protein were performed as described previously.

    "Methods": "Animals and ethics\nThe animals described within this study have in part been described in previous studies related the physiological response to intracranial hypertension.\n11\n,\n12\nThe archived data from a subset of 12 animals from these previous studies were utilized for the analysis. The initial experiments were conducted between 1995 and 1996, in accordance with the standards of the United Kingdom Animals Scientific Procedures act of 1986, under a United Kingdom Home Office license and with permission from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Cambridge. This has been previously documented.\n11\nFormal assessment of the LLA and its association with continuous indices of cerebrovascular reactivity using this data set has not been previously conducted. Therefore, these data were retrospectively analyzed for this purpose.\nThe initial study protocol has been previously described.\n11\n,\n12\nTwenty-eight white New Zealand (NZ) rabbits (7 female, 21 male; weight 2.7\u20133.7\u2009kg) were subjected to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infusions. No adverse events were recorded within this animal cohort. As with previous publications on this animal cohort, experiments are reported in compliance with the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines for the reporting of animal experiments.\n13\nThese animals were placed under general anesthetic via alphaxalone/alphadalone induction, with 1\u20133% halothane in 3:1 nitrous oxide/oxygen maintenance. Each animal subsequently had ligation of the common carotid arteries, leaving the brain entirely basilar artery dependent and allowing for TCD assessment of global blood flow. Once 2 weeks had passed, the animals were placed under general anesthestic again, with cannulation of the jugular vein and placement of a tracheostomy. Arterial blood pressure (ABP) was measured through the dorsal aorta after catheter insertion in the femoral artery (GaelTec, Dunvegan, UK). Cerebral blood velocity was measured using an 8\u2009MHz Doppler ultrasound probe (PCDop 842, SciMed, Bristol, UK) positioned to insonate in the direction of the basilar artery through a burr hole located over bregma. TCD ultrasonography was conducted from this point with the probe situated on the dura, facing the basilar artery. The TCD probe was held\nin situ\nwith a custom-made holder, to reduce the chance of loss of insonation angle and signal. ICP was monitored using an intraparenchymal microsensor (Codman and Shurtleff, Raynham, MA) inserted through a right frontal burr hole, and a laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) probe was placed epidurally through a further right frontal burr hole (Moor Instruments, Axbridge, Devon, UK).\nA lumbar laminectomy was performed to allow the positioning of a permanent catheter (sealed with cyanoacrylate after introduction) into the lumbar subarachnoid space. This facilitated the controlled infusion of artificial CSF during the experimental protocol. Rectal temperature was monitored and the animals were placed on a padded warming blanket. The rabbits were given an intravenous infusion of pancuronium (Pavulon, 0.5\u2009mg/kg/h) and ventilation was controlled according to arterial pCO\n2\nvia periodic arterial blood gas analyses. The animals were supported in the Sphinx position using a purpose-built head frame with three-point skull fixation. All experiments were performed in an animal laboratory at the same time of day.\n\nCSF infusion protocol\nThe protocol for CSF infusion is identical to that previously reported.\n11\n,\n12\nAfter completion of the lumber laminectomy, the animals were allowed to rest for 20\u2009min, with 5\u2009min of baseline data recorded. Subsequently, the animals were subjected to raised ICP secondary to CSF infusion with Hartmanns solution into the lumbar cistern. Infusion rates were initially 0.1\u2009mL/min, allowing ICP increase to reach a plateau of \u223c40\u2009mm Hg after \u223c10\u2009min. Thereafter the infusion rate was increased to rates between 0.2 and 2\u2009mL/min to produce severe intracranial hypertension. ICP was increased until the point at which TCD diastolic flow velocity approached zero, which corresponded to an ICP of between 60 and 100\u2009mm Hg (mean 75\u2009mm Hg) at the termination of the experiment. Rabbits were euthanized with thiopental at the conclusion of the test. No direct pCO\n2\nmanipulations occurred during this experiment, with a mean pCO\n2\nof 26.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.7\u2009mm Hg seen across the cohort animals. Further details can be found in the previous studies reporting these experiments.\n11\n,\n12\n\nData acquisition\nAll signals from the combined abovementioned invasive and non-invasive monitoring modalities were recorded and archived for future retrospective use. All recorded signals were digitized via an A/D converter (DT300; Data Translation, Marlboro, MA), sampled at frequency of 100\u2009Hz, using WREC software (Warsaw University of Technology), and subsequently processed using ICM+ software (Cambridge Enterprise Ltd, Cambridge, UK,\nhttp://icmplus.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk\n). Signal artifact was removed prior to further processing or analysis using tools available in ICM+.\n\nSignal analysis\nSimilarly to in one of our recent studies reporting on the entire rabbit cohort,\n11\nwe conducted the following analysis. CPP was determined as: MAP \u2013 ICP. FVs was derived by calculating the maximum of the recorded high frequency TCD maximum FV envelope over a 0.5\u2009sec window, updated every 0.25\u2009sec. FVm was calculated using the average of the recorded high frequency TCD maximum FV envelope over a 10\u2009sec window, updated every 10\u2009sec without data overlap. AMP was determined by calculating the fundamental Fourier amplitude of the ICP signal over a 10\u2009sec window, updated every 10\u2009sec. This was done over the frequency range consistent with the rabbits' HR (i.e., 100\u2013400\u2009bpm). Finally, 10\u2009sec moving averages (without data overlap) were calculated for all recorded signals: ICP, AMP, ABP (i.e., producing MAP), CPP, FVm, FVs, LDF-based CBF (LDF-CBF).\nThe archived signals for all 28 of the animals were interrogated visually and analyzed. Utilizing ICM+ software, plots for LDF versus CPP and FVm/FVs versus CPP were constructed. These were inspected visually for overall trend and the presence of a visible \u201cbreakpoint\u201d in LDF/FVm/FVs where future piecewise linear regression analysis would potentially be able to identify an accurate LLA. It was found that only 12 of the animals had sufficient recordings to allow for the accurate assessment of the LLA (given insufficient data after artifact removal to clearly identify an LLA), and, therefore, only 12 animals were utilized for the remainder of the study. The reason for eliminating 16 animals from future analysis stemmed from LDF and/or TCD probe shift throughout the experiments, leading to loss of viable signal and inability to derive an accurate LLA. The apparatus employed for holding the LDF and TCD probes\nin situ\nduring these experiments in the mid 1990s was inadequate, leading to poor signal acquisition in many animals.\n\nAutoregulation/cerebrovascular reactivity indices\nContinuous indices of autoregulation/cerebrovascular reactivity were derived within ICM+ in a similar fashion to that in other clinical studies.\n8\n,\n14\n,\n15\nThe following method was conducted for each index, with a summary of these indices found in\nTable 1\n. For PRx, we derived a moving Pearson correlation coefficient between ICP and MAP, using 30 consecutive 10\u2009sec windows (i.e., 5\u2009min of data), updated every 10\u2009sec. We employed a 10\u2009sec update frequency given the relatively short duration of recordings (mean for all animals 28.2\u2009min \u00b18.4\u2009min). Aside from the indices in\nTable 1\n, we also derived one index of compensatory reserve, RAP (correlation [R] between AMP [A] and ICP [P]), the correlation between AMP and ICP.\nTable\n1.\nAutoregulation/Cerebrovascular Reactivity Indices and Calculation Methods\nIndex\nSignals correlated\nSignal averaging (sec)\nPearson correlation coefficient calculation window (min)\nIndex calculation update frequency (sec)\nPRx\nICP and MAP\n10\n5\n10\nPAx\nAMP and MAP\n10\n5\n10\nRAC\nAMP and CPP\n10\n5\n10\nMx\nFVm and CPP\n10\n5\n10\nSx\nFVs and CPP\n10\n5\n10\nLx\nLDF-CBF and MAP\n10\n5\n10\nOpen in a separate window\nAMP, pulse amplitude of ICP; CBF, cerebral blood flow; CPP, cerebral perfusion pressure; FVm, mean flow velocity; FVs, systolic flow velocity; ICP, intracranial pressure; LDF-CBF, laser Doppler flowmetry based cerebral blood flow.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis was conducted utilizing R statistical software (R Core Team [2016].\nR: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing\n. R Foundation for Statistical Computing: Vienna.\nhttps://www.R-project.org/\n). The following packages were employed:\nggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse, lubridate, segmented, and pROC\n. Where significance is reported, \u03b1 was set at 0.05. The following analysis described is identical to that performed by Brady and coworkers,\n9\nthe only study in existence validating PRx against the LLA. This was done to allow comparison between the results, and potentially provide validation of the results seen within that study.\nFinding the LLA\nIn order to determine the LLA in the 12 animals, we employed piecewise linear regression of either LDF-CBF versus CPP plots, or FVs versus CPP plots. In 3 of the 12 animals, the LDF-CBF signals were not adequate for piecewise regression, and, therefore, FVs versus CPP plots were utilized to find the LLA. The LDF-CBF signal was standardized against the individual animal's baseline LDF-CBF signal, producing \u201c% change of LDF-CBF from baseline.\u201d This is similar to other studies evaluating LDF-CBF.\n9\n,\n11\nThe piecewise regression process employed a starting point for estimation of the breakpoint in either LDF-CBF or FVs. This starting point was visually estimated from the ICM+ plots of LDF-CBF versus CPP or FVs versus CPP, as described. Despite this initial visual inspection, the automated piecewise linear regression was conducted via the \u201csegmented\u201d computational package within R statistical software. The \u201cstart point\u201d is only a starting reference for the automated algorithm to perform the piecewise regression, with the full range of available CPP values tested during the process. This process functions on the assumption of continuity in data, splitting the data into two distinct linear segments. The intersection point of these two linear segments is considered the breakpoint in the piecewise function. The breakpoint identified by the piecewise regression process is one that minimized the sum residual square error (SSE) of the two linear segments, above and below this point. This breakpoint represents the LLA, with this method being described previously for the determination of the LLA in experimental models.\n9\nThis process was conducted for each animal, with piecewise regression plots produced denoting the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each fitted linear segment. Finally, the mean LLA for the cohort of 12 rabbits was determined by averaging all 12 LLA values obtained.\nFinding the \u201cCushing's response point\u201d\nGiven that this animal model involved sustained intracranial hypertension, the profound sympathetic surge seen during herniation could influence the relationship between MAP and ICP or AMP, leading to overwhelming positive trends in PRx, PAx and RAC below the LLA. Therefore, we wanted to see if there was a difference between the LLA and when the Cushing's response\n16\nwas seen. We performed separate piecewise linear regression analysis of MAP versus CPP plots, looking for a breakpoint where as CPP continued to decrease, we saw a dramatic increase in MAP, corresponding to the point at which the Cushing's response took effect. The breakpoint identified by the piecewise regression process is one that minimized the SSE of the two linear segments, above and below this point. This process was conducted for each animal, with piecewise regression plots produced denoting the 95% CI for each fitted linear segment. Finally, the mean \u201cCushing's point\u201d for the cohort of 12 rabbits was determined by averaging all 12 breakpoint values of MAP versus CPP. The mean LLA was compared with the mean \u201cCushing's point\u201d via student\nt\ntest, to assess statistical significance.\nBinned cohort data and plot\nAfter delineating the mean LLA for the cohort, we then produced cohort wide plots to inspect the population trend of various physiological measures against the LLA. We first binned all data across 2.5\u2009mm Hg bins of CPP, using R statistical software. The following error bar plots were then produced: LDF-CBF versus CPP, FVs versus CPP, PRx versus CPP, PAx versus CPP, AMP versus CPP, and Lx versus CPP. All other indices described in\nTable 1\nwere explored, but failed to produce conclusive results within this model of intracranial hypertension to either confirm or refute their association with the LLA. Therefore, these plots were not reported in the body of this, article, but can be found in the\nsupplementary materials\n(see online supplementary material [Appendices A\u2013F] at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n).\nComparing CPP for various clinical thresholds of PRx and PAx to LLA\nOur aim was to conduct a rough comparison of CPP for clinically defined thresholds of PRx and PAx to CPP at the LLA, defined via piecewise regression in each animal. To do so, we employed a simplified piecewise linear regression of PRx versus CPP and PAx versus CPP, using these models to determine CPP in each animal for the following thresholds of PRx\n17\nand PAx defined in TBI patients. For PRx, the thresholds of 0, +0.25, and +0.35 were tested, based on previous work in TBI\n17\nand currently unpublished data from our laboratory. For PAx, the thresholds of 0 and +0.25 were tested, based on unpublished work from our laboratory. We then compared the CPP values at each threshold for PRx and PAx, with the CPP values at the LLA, using a Bland\u2013Altman analysis. The Bland\u2013Altman analysis was only conducted for those index thresholds that displayed statistically significant Pearson correlation coefficients with the LLA.\nPrediction of continuous indices for impaired autoregulation\nAs was done in the study by Brady and coworkers,\n9\nwe performed receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis of PRx, PAx, and Lx across the cohort defined LLA. This was conducted in order to determine the ability of these indices to predict being either above or below the LLA. For each rabbit, one mean value for each variable was obtained at each 2.5\u2009mm Hg bin of CPP (i.e., CPP\u2009=\u200940\u2009mm Hg, 42.5\u2009mm Hg, etc.). We utilized 2.5\u2009mm Hg bins of CPP for the ROC analysis, to provide improved ROC prediction compared with the 5\u2009mm Hg binned data utilized in the previous study by Brady and coworkers.\n9\nThese data were then given the binary designation of being above the LLA, or below the LLA, based on the LLA defined previously. The data from all 12 rabbits were then utilized for the ROC analysis. Area under the curve (AUC) for the ROCs and 95% CI were reported via the DeLong method. Significance values (i.e.,\np\nvalues) for the AUCs were derived from univariate logistical regression analysis. Comparison between AUCs was conducted utilizing DeLong's test."

    "Methods": "Sample\nParticipants were recruited from a neurointensive care unit at a level 1 trauma center between 2000 and 2012 and co-enrolled under approved institutional review board (IRB) protocols (University of Pittsburgh IRB# 971212 and 001004). Prior to data collection, consent was obtained from the authorized legal representative of each sTBI participant. If, during the course of the study, the participant's status improved to the extent that (s)he had capacity, informed consent for continued participation was obtained.\nParticipants in the present study enrolled individuals based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) diagnosed with an sTBI (GCS \u22648), (2) 18\u201380 years old, and (3) presence of a ventriculostomy catheter. Exclusion criteria were: (1) penetrating TBI, (2) cardiac and/or respiratory arrest, and/or (3) any pre-existing neurological deficit that could confound scoring on the chosen measures (e.g., GCS, Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS]), such as an intellectual disability, stroke, or dementia.\nA total of 460 adults with sTBI were enrolled. Additional criteria for this genetic-based study approach were added, including the decision to limit the sample to Caucasians because of the low enrollment of black, Hispanic, and other non-Caucasian participants (\nn\n=\u200963), combined with the possible confounding effects of known allelic frequency differences based on ancestry. To address the goals of the study, individuals without genotypic data for at least one of the 18 SNPs of interest (\nn\n=\u200948) and those without valid GOS data for at least one post-injury time point (\nn\n=\u200944) were also eliminated. The final sample (\nn\n=\u2009305) consisted of adult, Caucasian, sTBI patients with some genotypic and phenotypic data (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nStudy sample-consort diagram.\n\nBiospecimen collection, processing, and analysis\nBiospecimens used for genotyping were either cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood, both collected under the same IRB-approved protocol. CSF was collected from an indwelling ventriculostomy catheter and blood was collected from either an intravenous or an intra-arterial catheter. DNA was extracted from CSF using the Qiamp Midi Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) and from blood by centrifugation, removal of buffy coat, and extraction of the DNA from buffy coat using a salting out procedure, as previously described.\n28\nA total of 18 SNPs representing three candidate biomarker genes (GFAP, S100B, and UCHL1) were genotyped using the iPLEX MassARRAY multiplex assay platform (Sequenom Inc., San Diego, CA). Genotype quality control included independently double calling genotypes, inclusion of blind duplicates, and excluding SNPs not meeting a minimum 85% call rate from analyses.\n\nMeasures\nUpon patients' admission, initial GCS score assessed by a neurosurgeon after resuscitation was confirmed for inclusion. GOS was assessed and collected by a trained neuropsychological technician at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-injury. To ensure that groups were sufficiently large and balanced for analysis, GOS scores were dichotomized as 1\u20132 versus 3\u20135, with lower scores corresponding to profound injury (i.e., death or a vegetative state). Whenever possible, GOS scoring was completed face to face, but when this was not possible, phone interviews were performed. Personnel involved in data collection were blinded to participant genotype.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSPSS version 24 software (IBM, Chicago, IL) was used for all statistical analyses. Variables were screened and summary statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, range) were generated for all continuous variables; frequencies were generated for categorical variables. Univariate associations between interval-level variables (age, Injury Severity Score [ISS] and GOS scores at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months were assessed with logistical regression. Univariate associations among categorical variables (e.g., sex, GCS) were assessed using \u03c7\n2\nanalysis and, when appropriate, Fisher's exact test. Multivariate logistical regression controlling for age and sex, as well as admission GCS, was used to explore the relationship between variant allele presence and neurological outcomes (i.e., GOS\u2009=\u20091\u20132 vs. 3\u20135) assessed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.\nA priori\ncriteria for statistical significance was set at\np\n<\u20090.05. Because of the descriptive nature of this pilot study, and the primary goal of identifying possible confounders in biomarker studies, corrections for multiple comparisons were not performed. The rationale was that correcting for multiple comparisons would have increased the chance of type II errors, which would potentially make subsequent regression models too lenient."

    "Methods": "Head impact data previously reported by Kelley and colleagues were used in this study approved by the Wake Forest School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB).7Athletes participating in at least 1 of 4 consecutive years (2012\u201315) of youth tackle football within a single league were evaluated in this study. All athletes provided written consent and parental consent to participate in this study. All players were fitted with youth Riddell Speed football helmets containing Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) MX Encoders in the space between padding in the helmet. The MX Encoder includes accelerometers, a digital encoder, and instrumentation to transmit signals via a wireless antenna to a base unit. Trained research assistants monitored the HIT System at all practices and games. All measured head impacts exceeding 10g, a commonly used threshold among the HIE literature,7,10,27were recorded. Information from all accelerometers was collected at 1\u2009kHz for a period of 40\u2009msec; 8\u2009msec before the trigger and 32\u2009msec after the trigger. Data were screened to remove impacts that did not occur while the helmet was worn (i.e., dropped helmets) using recorded video data. Data processing algorithms and the data collection methodology used in this study were previously published.7,29\n\nCumulative HIE was quantified in terms of combined magnitude and frequency using the risk-weighted cumulative exposure (RWECP) metric.8RWE encompasses magnitude and frequency in an augmented way versus other biomechanical HIE metrics (e.g., number of impacts, percentiles of acceleration) by non-linearly weighting each impact by the estimated concussion risk.8To compute RWECP, the risk of concussion for each impact for each player was calculated using the combined probability risk function previously described by Rowson and Duma.29The logistic regression equation with appropriate coefficients was used to compute probability (i.e., risk) of concussion from peak resultant linear and rotational acceleration for each impact. Risks associated with each head impact for each player were summed to compute the RWECPfor the season. Athletes were then divided into one of four exposure groups based on quartiles computed from the distribution of RWECP. The exposure groups are termed RQ1 to RQ4 for the first to fourth quartiles, respectively.\n\nHIE was compared between pre-season, regular season, and playoffs. Pre-season was defined as the time from the first day of practice up to and including all scrimmage games. The regular season was divided into first and second halves. The first half of the regular season was defined as the first practice after the final pre-season scrimmage up to the mid-point in the regular season. The second half of the regular season was defined as the first practice after the mid-point in the regular season up to the last session of the regular season. Playoffs were defined as the first practice after the final regular season session up to the final playoff game.\n\nMean impacts per session were computed for each athlete and session type (practice or game) within each time frame (i.e., pre-season). The 95th percentile linear and rotational acceleration values were calculated from the distribution of each athlete's linear and rotational acceleration profiles within each time frame as well. Mean impacts per session (i.e., practice or game), 95th percentile linear acceleration, and 95th percentile rotational acceleration were compared across each exposure group and time frame using mixed effects models while evaluating the interaction between exposure group and time frame. Mixed effects models were also used to compare athlete characteristics, including age, weight, height, playing experience, and length of season, between exposure groups. Each model was computed while controlling for intra-individual correlations in players across seasons and level of play.7The distribution of impacts per session within each quartile grouping were right-skewed; log-transformations were used to improve symmetry prior to computing the means.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC)."

    "Methods": "Population\nParticipants were from the VETSA project, a longitudinal study of cognitive and brain aging among middle-aged male twins who served in the United States military sometime between 1965 and 1975. VETSA methodology has been detailed elsewhere.\n30\n,\n31\nVETSA participants were recruited from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, a national database of male-male twin pairs who both served in the military during the Vietnam Era, although most VETSA participants (\u223c80%) did not experience combat.\n32\n,\n33\nData collection took place at the University of California, San Diego and Boston University. A total of 1237 men (ages 51\u201360) participated in VETSA Wave 1. An average of 5.6 years later, 1018 of these men (ages 56\u201366) returned to participate in Wave 2. The study was approved by institutional review boards at both sites, and all participants provided written informed consent.\nHere, we focused on Wave 2 data, as the most comprehensive assessment of lifetime TBI was conducted at that time. Of the 1018 Wave 2 participants, 37 had missing TBI data, 17 could not be clearly classified for TBI status, and 11 had missing psychiatric symptom data. The present analyses focused on the remaining 953 participants. The 65 participants who had missing TBI or psychiatric data or were unclassifiable for TBI status were similar to the 953 remaining participants in terms of age, education, pre-morbid cognitive ability, and apolipoprotein E (\nAPOE\n)-\u025b4 status (all\np\n>\u20090.05). Although they had lower levels of current alcohol use (\np\n=\u20090.04) than the 953 remaining participants, there were no differences in the other health variables listed in the subsequent sections (all\np\n>\u20090.05).\n\nMeasures\nTBI\nParticipants were interviewed to ascertain lifetime exposure to TBI. First, participants were asked: (1) \u201cHave you ever had a severe head injury that was associated with loss of consciousness or confusion?\u201d (2) \u201cHave you ever been told by a doctor that you had a concussion? (If yes, how many times?),\u201d and (3) \u201cAltogether, how many different head injuries or concussions (all total) have you had?\u201d Participants who denied head injury on all questions were considered to have no history of TBI. Participants who responded in the affirmative to any of these questions were interviewed regarding the details of each head injury, including age and cause of injury, presence/duration of loss of consciousness (LOC), confusion or memory loss, seizures related to the injury, and whether they received medical attention or were hospitalized overnight. LOC was coded as follows: No LOC, LOC \u22645\u2009min, LOC >5\u2009min to \u226420\u2009min, LOC >20\u2009min to several hours, LOC for several hours to 1 day, and LOC >1 day. Duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) was coded as follows: No PTA, PTA <1\u2009h, PTA \u22651\u2009h to <24\u2009h, PTA \u226524\u2009h to 7 days, and PTA >7 days.\nWe utilized details about each head injury to distinguish likely TBIs from asymptomatic head injuries. A head injury was considered to meet criteria for TBI if descriptions were positive for: (1) LOC for any length of time, (2) confusion or memory loss, (3) seizures related to the injury, (4) receipt of medical attention, or (5) overnight hospitalization. We considered 17 individuals who had experienced only asymptomatic head injury to be unclassifiable, and we excluded them from our analysis. For participants with a history of TBI, each TBI was further classified by injury severity based on LOC and PTA duration, approximating standard Veterans Administration (VA)/Department of Defense (DOD) recommendations for defining mild, moderate, and severe TBI,\n34\nalthough these guidelines were not used in the original design of the TBI assessment. mTBI was defined as LOC \u226420\u2009min and/or PTA <24\u2009h. Moderate TBI was defined as LOC >20\u2009min to 1 day and/or PTA \u226524\u2009h to 7 days. Severe TBI was defined as LOC >1 day and/or PTA >7 days.\nCurrent psychiatric symptoms\nPTSD and depressive symptoms. To assess current PTSD symptoms, participants completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL) \u2013 Civilian version,\n35\n,\n36\na 17-item checklist that assesses PTSD symptoms as outlined in the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Revision\n(DSM-IV). Total possible score ranges from 17 to 85, with higher scores indicating greater symptoms. (The Civilian, rather than the Military, version of the PCL was used so that assessment was not limited to symptoms from military-related traumatic events, particularly because most VETSA participants did not see combat [as noted] and had had military service that had ended decades prior to this assessment). To assess current depressive symptoms, participants completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies \u2013 Depression Scale (CES-D),\n37\na 20-item symptom checklist. Total score ranges from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater symptoms.\nPTSD is often comorbid with depression,\n38\n,\n39\nand the two symptom scales were strongly correlated (\nr\n=\u20090.77,\np\n<\u20090.001) in our cohort, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of these different conditions. Therefore, we classified individuals based on whether or not they had current clinically significant symptoms for\neither\ncondition, reflecting overall presence/absence of elevated symptoms. For depressive symptoms, we applied the recommended cutoff score of \u226516 for the CES-D.\n40\nFor PTSD symptoms, we applied a cutoff score of \u226536 for the PCL.\n41\nThis cut-point is recommended for detection of elevated PTSD symptoms among veterans in general settings (e.g., VA Primary Care) and strikes a balance between lower cut-points recommended for use in general civilian settings and higher cut-points recommended for use among veterans and civilians in mental health clinics.\n41\nParticipants who met or exceeded either symptom cut-off are henceforth referred to as having current elevated psychiatric symptoms (abbreviated as \u201cPsych\u201d).\nCognition\nParticipants were administered a comprehensive neurocognitive battery of standard measures, from which domain scores representing nine cognitive functions were derived.\n42\n,\n43\nRaw scores for individual tests were converted to z-scores using means and standard deviations calculated from all Wave 2 VETSA participants, such that higher z-scores indicate better performance. For cognitive functions measured with multiple tests, a domain score was calculated by averaging z-scores across tests. Several executive function tasks were included in the test battery, but these were examined individually, because these are differentiated in the executive function literature.\n44\nVisual spatial function was assessed with the Mental Rotation Test\n45\nand the Hidden Figures Test.\n46\nWorking memory was assessed with Digit Span \u2013 Forward and Backward, Letter-Number Sequencing, and Spatial Span \u2013 Forward and Backward tests from the Wechsler Memory Scale \u2013 III (WMS-III)\n47\nand a modified Reading Span test.\n48\nEpisodic memory was assessed with the California Verbal Learning Test \u2013 Second Edition (CVLT-II)\n49\n\u2013 Total Learning, Short Delay Free Recall, and Long Delay Free Recall; WMS-III Logical Memory\n47\n\u2013 Immediate Recall and Delayed Recall; and WMS-III Visual Reproduction\n47\n\u2013 Immediate Recall and Delayed Recall. Processing speed was assessed with the Stroop Word Reading and Color Reading Subtests\n50\nand the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Trails Number Sequencing and Letter Sequencing tests.\n51\nVerbal fluency was assessed with the D-KEFS Letter Fluency and Category Fluency tests.\n51\nAbstract reasoning was assessed with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) Matrix Reasoning.\n52\nTrails switching was assessed with the D-KEFS Trails Letter-Number Switching test\n51\n(score adjusted for D-KEFS Trails Number Sequencing and Letter Sequencing performance). Category switching was assessed with the D-KEFS Verbal Fluency Category Switching test\n51\n(score adjusted for D-KEFS Category Fluency performance). Inhibition was assessed with the Stroop Color-Word interference score,\n50\nwhich is adjusted for word reading and color reading performance.\nOther variables\nParticipants self-reported their age and education. As a measure of pre-morbid cognitive ability, we used Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT)\n53\nscores, completed just prior to military induction (at mean age of 20 years old; score range 10\u2013100).\nAPOE\n-\u025b4 is the major risk allele for Alzheimer's disease.\n54\nCarrier status was determined from blood samples and was based on presence/absence of at least one \u025b4 allele.\n55\n,\n56\nHypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, and history of substance abuse (alcohol or drugs) were determined via self-report (\u201chave you ever been told by a physician that you had\u2026\u201d). Participants self-reported current alcohol use (within the past 14 days), and this was coded as none, \u22641 drink per day, >1 and \u22642 drinks per day, or >2 drinks per day. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from height and weight.\n\nStatistical analysis\nUsing mixed-effects models, we examined whether men with and without a history of TBI (TBI+ or TBI-) differed by demographics (age, education), pre-morbid cognitive functioning (age 20 AFQT score),\nAPOE\n-\u025b4 status (\u025b4+ vs. \u025b4-), cardiovascular health factors, substance abuse, current alcohol use, current PTSD and depressive symptoms, and presence/absence of current elevated psychiatric symptoms (Psych). These models account for correlated observations (persons nested within twin pairs) as a random effect. We used SAS PROC MIXED for continuous variables and SAS PROC GLIMMIX for binary and count variables.\nIn mixed-effects models, we first tested the main effect of TBI on the cognitive outcomes, adjusting for presence of current elevated psychiatric symptoms (Psych). The models also adjusted for age, pre-morbid cognitive ability,\nAPOE\n-\u025b4 status, and other health factors that differed between those with and without TBI (\np\n<\u20090.05) as detailed. Next, we tested for TBI\u2009\u00d7\u2009Psych interactions by adding an interaction term. These analyses were conducted using SAS PROC MIXED. We used the false discovery rate (FDR)\n57\nto correct for multiple testing."

    "Methods": "Study design and subjects\nThis study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh's Institutional Review Board. We enrolled 100 unique individuals admitted with severe TBI, defined as admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) \u22648, at a level 1 trauma center.\nFigure 2\nshows how our cohort was used for analysis: 96 patients had E1 data from days 0\u20133, and 92 of these individuals had E1, T, E2, and Andro data from samples collected on days 0\u20133 post-injury. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age between 16 and 75 years, (2) positive findings on head CT, (3) insertion of extraventricular drainage catheter (EVD) for intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, and (4) signed consent for enrollment from appropriate proxy. Individuals with penetrating brain injury, documented history of prolonged cardiac or respiratory arrest, history of endocrine tumor, history of breast cancer requiring chemotherapy or tamoxifen, history of prostate cancer with orchiectomy or luteinizing hormone suppressing agents, or untreated thyroid disease were excluded from this study. Also, eight healthy controls were recruited as a reference group for serum hormone measurements. Healthy controls did not have previous endocrine pathology, were not pregnant, and were not using oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, or hormone-modifying supplements. Those with a history of TBI, neurological disorder, or bleeding disorder were also excluded as healthy controls.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nDivisions of cohort used for analyses. Our 100 patient cohort had 96 individuals with data on E1 and 92 individuals with data on estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), androstenedione (Andro), and testosterone (T).\nCritical care management of individuals with TBI was consistent with\nThe Guidelines for the Management of Severe Head Injury\n.\n52\nInitial interventions included targeted temperature management, EVD placement, central venous catheterization, arterial catheterization, and monitoring via pulse oximetry. ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were managed to target (< 20\u2009mm Hg and >60\u2009mm Hg, respectively). Mean arterial pressure was maintained at least at >90\u2009mm Hg. Two patients were enrolled in a trial evaluating moderate hypothermia in TBI, and five patients were involved in the Citicoline Brain Injury Treatment (COBRIT) study. The details of these trials are as described previously.\n53\n\nStudy variable description\nThe clinical and demographic characteristics of the individuals with E1 data (\nn\n=\u200996) were assessed in relation to survival status and day 0\u20133 E1 levels. Demographic variables (age, sex, race, body mass index [BMI]) were recorded from admission hospital records. We obtained best in 24\u2009h GCS, given that it more reliably predicts cognitive outcome than does admission GCS.\n54\n,\n55\nAdditional clinical variables included Injury Severity Score (ISS), non-head ISS, length of hospital stay (LOS), mechanism of injury (MOI), total hospital complications (e.g., pulmonary, cardiac), and injury type on head CT. The vast majority of subjects (or proxy respondents) could not provide accurate information regarding hormone supplementation/replacement at the time of injury.\nThe GCS is a measure of the degree of impaired consciousness in patients, with lower scores representing more severe deficits.\n56\nThe ISS combines scores from the most severe injuries in distinct anatomical locations, resulting in a positive association with injury severity.\n57\nWe additionally calculated a non-head ISS, excluding brain injuries, using the same method to represent extracerebral trauma severity. Injury types on head CT included subdural hemorrhage (SDH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), diffuse axonal injury (DAI), epidural hemorrhage (EDH), contusion, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and other injury not classified elsewhere. CT injury types associated with mortality in bivariate analysis (\np\n<\u20090.2) were incorporated into a neurological burden score (NBS). NBS was calculated by summing the total number of these injuries observed on CT in each patient. Presence of SDH, SAH, and contusion were summed to calculate the NBS. Presence of sepsis, splenic injury, and other abdominal injury was also obtained using records on International Statistical Classification of Disease Injury codes version 9 (ICD-9). Presence of sepsis, splenic injury, and other abdominal injury were summed to generate a score (SSA) to assess concomitant extracerebral inflammatory burden. We measured mortality at 1 month given that the majority of deaths after TBI occurred in the 1st month in our cohort and a previously reported mean acute hospital stay of 3\u20135 weeks following severe TBI.\n58\u201360\n\nSerum sample collection and measurements\nBlood samples were collected at \u223c7:00\u2009a.m. daily during days 0\u20133 post-injury. Samples were centrifuged, aliquoted, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until used for assay. Samples from control subjects were drawn at 7:00\u2009am, processed, and stored as described. Serum samples were measured for E2 (\nn\n=\u2009272 samples), T (\nn\n=\u2009272 samples), and progesterone (\nn\n=\u2009281 samples), using radioimmunoassays via the COAT-A-COUNT\n\u00ae\nIn-vitro Diagnostic Test Kit (#TKE2, #TKTT, and #TKPG, respectively; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc., Tarrytown, NY). Assay sensitivities were as follows: E2, 8\u2009pg/mL; T, 4\u2009ng/mL; and progesterone, 0.03\u2009ng/mL. Serum samples (\nn\n=\u2009212) were measured for Andro using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (sensitivity 0.021\u2009ng/mL; #EIA-3265; DRG International, Springfield, NJ). Also, serum samples (\nn\n=\u2009202) were measured for E1 concentrations using competitive ELISA kits (sensitivity 2.21\u2009pg/mL; #EIA-4174; DRG International, Springfield, NJ).\nGiven the known effects of cortisol and inflammatory cytokines as aromatase gene transcription factors within the steroidogenesis pathway,\n35\n,\n36\n,\n51\nwe assessed cortisol, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 levels measured in this population. Serum samples were measured for cortisol (\nn\n=\u2009281 samples) using RIA via the COAT-A-COUNT\n\u00ae\nIn-vitro Diagnostic Test Kit (sensitivity 20\u2009ng/mL; #TKCO; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc., Tarrytown, NY). Serum samples (\nn\n=\u2009201) were measured for TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 concentrations using a Luminex\u2122 bead array assay (#HSCYTO-60SK; Millipore, Billerica, MA). Sensitivities for the cytokines were as follows: TNF-\u03b1, 0.05\u2009pg/mL; and IL-6, 0.1\u2009pg/mL.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were completed using SPSS (v23.0; IBM, Armonk, NY) and SAS (v9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Summary statistics of means, standard error of means (SE), medians, and interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated for continuous variables. Data were assessed for normality using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test, and nonparametric tests (Mann\u2013Whitney's test, Kruskal\u2013Wallis's test, and Spearman's rank correlation) were used as appropriate to compare variables when data did not meet normality assumptions. Categorical variables were summarized with frequencies and percentages. Associations between categorical variables were determined using the \u03c7\n2\ntest, or the Fisher's exact test as appropriate.\nFor all individuals with TBI and serum E1, averages were calculated. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was conducted to assess departures from linearity in the effect of E1 on mortality over the range of E1 levels in the study population. The RCS procedure uses piecewise functions of low-order polynomials over specified intervals, known as knots, to discern points of departure from linearity.\n61\nAfter inspecting these data, we applied tertile cut points for E1 to discriminate the dose-response relationship between E1 and mortality. Subjects were accordingly assigned to E1 low, medium, and high groups based on having E1 levels in the 0th\u201325th, 25th\u201375th, and 75th\u2013100th percentiles.\nBinary logistic multivariate regression was performed to adjust for the effects of demographic and injury variables in assessing the association between E1 tertile and 1 month mortality. Covariates were tested in the model if they demonstrated a trend with mortality (\np\n<\u20090.2). To assess potential variation between hormone values by sex, interaction terms were generated between sex and E1 level.\nDay 0\u20133 averages for individuals with Andro, T, E2, and E1 were calculated for 92 patients. Mean hormone levels in relation to mortality status were assessed as well as average Andro, T, and E2 levels for each E1 tertile. In order to assess relationships between serum steroids in the aromatization pathway via causal inferences, a structural equations model (SEM) was fitted using the covariance analysis of linear structural equations (CALIS) procedure in SAS. The data for the four serum hormones were first z-score standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 to adjust for inherent differences between hormone marker concentrations. An SEM was run among all individuals, and a post-hoc exploratory analysis was conducted among survivors and non-survivors respectively. Standardized \u03b2 coefficients and standard errors were reported for each path, and significant paths (\np\n<\u20090.05) were indicated."

    "Methods": "Outline of study design\nStep 1: Comparative pharmacokinetic trial\nAs a first step, we performed a 24-h comparative PK trial of the NeuroSTAT and Sandimmune intravenous (i.v.) formulations of cyclosporine in a large animal model of focal controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury to compare PK profiles of both cyclosporine formulations in swine. We have previously shown bioequivalence between cyclosporine formulations in humans.\n54\nPiglets were randomized to 20\u2009mg/kg/day (i.v.) of either the NeuroSTAT or Sandimmune formulation of cyclosporine (\nN\n=\u20093/group). One hour post-TBI, a bolus dose was i.v. administered, with bolus/infusion ratio of 0.3 administered over 5\u2009min, followed by a continuous infusion for 24\u2009h.\nStep 2: Dose escalation\nWe then performed a 24-h PK dose escalation study using the NeuroSTAT formulation in the same model to determine optimal dosing for the efficacy study. Optimal dosing was determined based on blood exposure as well as brain concentrations as compared to the previous literature, including the clinical studies, with minimal evidence of toxicity. In addition to the 20 mg/kg/day dose evaluated in step 1, we also evaluated 5, 10, and 40\u2009mg/kg/day of NeuroSTAT (\nN\n=\u20093/group), administered as described above.\nStep 3: Efficacy trial\nInformed by data from steps 1 and 2, we then evaluated the NeuroSTAT formulation of cyclosporine at the dose of 20\u2009mg/kg/day, in a 5-day, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled efficacy study. The bolus dose was administered as described above, and the infusion was continued for 5 days at 20\u2009mg/kg/day. A total of 37 animals underwent randomization, of which 24 received the full dose (\nn\n=\u200911 cyclosporine and\nn\n=\u200913 placebo) and were subsequently included for analysis of outcome metrics as indicated in\nFigure 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRandomization and inclusion for analysis per protocol. The per-protocol population includes all the pigs that underwent randomization and received the full dose. All data underwent quality control (QC), and all exclusions of data points were performed before unblinding. CCI, controlled cortical injury; CsA, cyclosporine; CVC, central venous catheter; CNS, central nervous system; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; ROS, reactive oxygen species.\n\nAnimals\nThe study was carried out in accord with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania (Number: 803401). Four-week-old (7\u20139\u2009kg) Yorkshire piglets, with brain development and characteristics similar to human toddlers, were studied. Based on previous work, females were utilized to limit heterogeneity.\nFasted piglets were pre-medicated with an intramuscular injection of ketamine (20\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (2\u2009mg/kg). Subjects were intubated after induction with 4% inhaled isoflurane using a 1.0 fraction of inspired oxygen by snout mask, until abolishment of response to an interdigital hoof pinch. Anesthesia was maintained with approximately 1% inhaled isoflurane by endotracheal tube with fraction of inspired oxygen set to 0.21. Anesthetic depth was characterized by a relaxed jaw tone, absence of foot withdrawal in response to a firm interdigital pinch, and absence of palpebral and corneal reflexes. If any of these signs were absent, depth of anesthesia was altered by increasing the percentage of isoflurane. Preceding injury, buprenorphine SR (0.1\u2009mg/kg) was also delivered intramuscularly for analgesia, and Cefazolin (30\u2009mg/kg) was injected intramuscularly as a prophylactic antibiotic. A circulating water blanket kept core body temperature constant between 36 and 38\u00b0C monitored by a rectal probe. Throughout the experiment, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, heart rate, and end-tidal CO\n2\nwere continuously monitored (VetCap model 2050081; SDI, Waukesha, WI). Mechanical ventilation, if necessary, was adjusted to maintain normoxia and normocarbia, titrated to peripheral saturation of greater than 94% and an end-tidal CO\n2\nlevel of 35\u201345\u2009mm Hg.\n\nPlacement of central venous catheters\nBefore injury, two tunneled central venous catheters (CVCs) were placed into bilateral cephalic veins, with termination in the superior vena cava and right atrial junction. The lines were tunneled between the animals' scapula. One CVC line was connected to an ambulatory Bluetooth pump (3D BT mini infusion; Strategic Applications Inc., Infusion Technologies, Lake Villa, IL) for continuous drug delivery, whereas the other CVC was used for serial blood collection.\n\nControlled cortical impact injury\nA mild-to-moderate focal contusion injury (corresponding to clinical human severity classifications) was induced using a spring-loaded CCI device with a typical lesion volume of 8% of the hemisphere or 4% of the cerebrum as previously described.\n55\nIn short, while maintained on anesthesia, the head was trimmed and prepped with chlorhexidine solution. The right coronal suture was exposed, a craniectomy was performed, and the exposed dura was opened to reveal the cortical surface. The device was stabilized against the skull with screws and the spring-loaded tip rapidly (4\u2009ms) indented to a depth of 0.7\u2009cm of the cortical rostral gyrus. The device was removed and the dura reapproximated. Finally, the surgical flap was sutured closed. After emergence from anesthesia, the piglets were extubated. Animals were continuously monitored during recovery. They all displayed initial depressed activity and gait instability, but neither hypotension nor desaturation was ever observed after injury in any subject. Subjects were returned to the animal housing facility when they met the following criteria: vocalization without squealing, able to ambulate, devoid of aggression or avoidance behavior, absence of piloerection, and unassisted feeding and drinking.\n\nSample acquisition\nBefore sacrifice the animals were reanesthetized as described above. While under general anesthesia, a 24-gauge spirotte spinal needle was placed at lumbar level into the intrathecal space for removal of approximately 23\u2009mL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A wide bilateral craniectomy was subsequently performed and the brain was rapidly extracted while simultaneously receiving a pentobarbital (150\u2009mg/kg i.v.) overdose. For the PK studies, heart, liver, and kidney samples were harvested immediately after sacrifice, and immediately frozen at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nPharmacokinetics\nAnalysis of cyclosporine levels was carried out using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry by a contract research organization (Alliance Pharma, Devault, PA).\n\nNeuroimaging\nIn the efficacy study, the animals were anesthetized again on day 5 as described above, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) sequencing was obtained on a Siemens 3T TRIO MRI research magnet (Seimens, Munich, Germany) using a standard knee coil. Anatomical images (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR] weighted, susceptibility-weighted, and diffusion-weighted) were assessed for presence of hemorrhage, edema, and other structural abnormalities. MRI criteria for injury were defined as an area of increased signal abnormality on FLAIR imaging relative to the contralateral (uninjured) hemisphere. Images were analyzed using TeraRecon v4.4.12.194 (TeraRecon, Foster City, CA) software and interpreted by a board-certified neuroradiologist blinded to treatment group. For each subject, the area of injury on each slice was manually traced and volume of injury was then automatically calculated by the software.\nSingle-slice two-dimensional multi-voxel\n1\nH MRSI was performed using a spin echo (point resolved spectroscopy) sequence with water suppression by means of a chemical shift selective saturation pulse. Sequence parameters included: repetition time/echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20091700/30\u2009ms, number of excitations\u2009=\u20093, field of view\u2009=\u200916\u2009\u00d7\u200916\u2009cm\n2\n, matrix size\u2009=\u200916\u2009\u00d7\u200916, slice thickness\u2009=\u200920\u2009mm resulting in a voxel size of 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009mm\n3\n, bandwidth\u2009=\u20091200\u2009Hz, flip angle\u2009=\u200990 degrees, and vector size\u2009=\u20091024. Volume of interest (VOI) was selected so as to include regions of injury and normal brain parenchyma avoiding the scalp, skull base, or sinuses. Outer volume saturation slabs (30\u2009mm thick) were placed outside the VOI to suppress lipid signals from the scalp. The data set was acquired using elliptical k-space sampling with weighted phase encoding to reduce the acquisition time. Manual shimming was performed to achieve an optimal full width half maximum of <20\u2009Hz (magnitude spectrum) of the water signal. A water unsuppressed\n1\nH MRSI spectrum was also acquired to use the water signal for computing metabolite concentrations.\nAbsolute concentrations of metabolites were measured using a user-independent spectral fit program (linear combination [LC] model).\n56\n,\n57\nThe region between 0.2 and 4.0 parts per million of the spectrum was analyzed and the following metabolites were evaluated: N-acetylaspartate (NAA), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), phosphocreatine (PCr), taurine (Tau), creatine (Cr), choline (GPC and PCh), myoinositol (Ins), Glx (glutamate + glutamine), lactate (Lac), glutathione (GSH), alanine (Ala), and aspartate (Asp). The error in the spectral fitting routine (LC model) was used to assess the spectral quality for a particular voxel; metabolite concentrations from only those voxels were used that had Cramer-Rao lower bounds/standard deviations (SDs) of less than 20% for all the metabolites. Short TE (TE30)\n1\nH-MRS metabolites NAA, GABA, PCr, Tau, Cr, GPC and PCh, Ins, Glx, Lac, GSH, Ala, and Asp were measured and quantified using the LC model.\n\nCerebral microdialysis\nAfter neuroimaging, cerebral microdialysis was performed in the ipsilateral hemisphere 10\u2009mm from the contusion (CMA 71 Elite; M Dialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden). While under anesthesia, as described above, the scalp was reopened and the microdialysis probe was placed in the brain parenchyma after needle puncture of the dura mater. Probes were placed 1\u2009cm deep to reach the junction of cortex and subcortical white matter. Sterile saline was perfused at 1\u2009\u03bcL/min, and after a 30-min equilibration period, samples were collected over the succeeding 30\u2009min. Samples were labeled and immediately frozen at \u221280\u00b0C and subsequently analyzed by ISCUS Flex\u2122 Microdialysis Analyzer (M Dialysis AB) by a blinded technician.\n\nMitochondrial high-resolution respirometry\nAfter neuroimaging and collection of cerebral microdialysis, tissue was harvested as described above. A 2\u2009cm\n2\nregion of cortex of visibly viable tissue was resected immediately adjacent to the rostral edge of the contusion, along with a corresponding mirrored region from the contralateral hemisphere and placed in ice-cold buffer (320\u2009mM of sucrose, 10\u2009mM of Trizma base, and 2\u2009mM of ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid [EGTA]). Adherent necrotic tissue from the contused area was dissected and disposed. In addition, subcortical white matter and blood vessels were removed through dissection. Tissue was subsequently quickly placed on drying paper to absorb excess buffer and weighed. Tissue was then gently homogenized on ice in MiR05 (110\u2009mM of sucrose, 0.5\u2009mM of EGTA, 3.0\u2009mM of MgCl\n2\n, 60\u2009mM of K-lactobionate, 10\u2009mM of KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 20\u2009mM of taurine, 20\u2009mM of HEPES, and 1.0\u2009g/L of fatty acid\u2013free bovine serum albumin) using a 5-mL Potter\u2013Elvehjem Teflon and glass homogenizer to a concentration of 1\u2009mg of wet weight tissue/10\u2009\u03bcL of MiR05 buffer.\nMitochondrial respiratory function was analyzed\nex vivo\nin brain cortex homogenates using high-resolution respirometry (Oxygraph-2k; Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria) with a substrate-uncoupler-inhibitor titration (SUIT) protocol with sequential additions, as previously described.\n55\nIn the utilized SUIT protocol, oxidative phosphorylation capacities with electron flow through both complex I (CI) and complex II (CII) were evaluated as well as the convergent electron input through the Q-junction (CI + CII) using the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide\u2013linked substrates, malate (5\u2009mM) and pyruvate (5\u2009mM), and succinate (10\u2009mM), both in the presence of adenosine diphosphate (1\u2009mM), corresponding to state 3 respiration in established bioenergetics terminology.\n55\nOligomycin, an inhibitor of the ATP synthase, induced mitochondrial respiration independent of ATP production across the inner mitochondrial membrane, referred to as LEAK respiration (LEAK\nCI + CII\n) or State 4\nO\n. Maximal convergent nonphosphorylating respiration of the electron transport chain (ETC\nCI +\nCII\n) was evaluated by titrating the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone. Respiration exclusively through complex II (ETS\nCII\n) was achieved through the addition of rotenone (2\u2009mM). The complex III inhibitor, antimycin-A (1\u2009\u03bcg/mL), was added to measure the residual oxygen consumption (ROX) that is independent of the ETC, and this was subtracted from each of the measured respiratory states. Complex IV activity was measured by the addition of N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyl-pphenylenediamine (TMPD; 0.5\u2009mM) together with ascorbate (ASC; 0.8\u2009mM). The complex IV inhibitor, sodium azide (10\u2009mM), was added to reveal the remaining chemical background that is subtracted from the TMPD-induced oxygen consumption rate.\n\nFluorometry and measurement of reactive oxygen species\nMeasurements of ROS generation were assessed simultaneously with respirometry measurements by a O2k-Fluorescence LED2-Module (Oxygraph-2k; Oroboros Instruments), utilizing an Amplex UltraRed assay, as previously described. In short, in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (1\u2009U/mL), Amplex UltraRed (N-acetyl-3,7 dihydroxyphenoxazine) (5\u2009mM) reacts with H\n2\nO\n2\nto produce the fluorescent compound, resorufin. The addition of superoxide dismutase (10\u2009U/mL) ensures that all superoxide is converted into H\n2\nO\n2\n.\n\nCitrate synthase activity\nCitrate synthase (CS) activity was measured as a marker of mitochondrial content. Chamber contents from mitochondrial high-resolution respirometry measurements were frozen for subsequent CS activity measurements. A commercially available kit (Citrate Synthase Assay Kit, CS0720; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used, according to the manufacturer's instructions, to determine CS activity (\u03bcmol/mL/min).\n\nStatistical analysis\nData reporting was based upon the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Common Data Elements (CDE) for pre-clinical TBI research.\n58\nCDE for individual animals will be available in the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research informatics system. In steps 2 and 3, animals were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups by a study monitor not performing the experiment or analyses, in permuted blocks of 4. Drug and placebo vehicle were individually coded and identical vials were utilized. All participants performing the study and analyzing outcome metrics were completely blinded to treatment group. The randomization key was kept in an encrypted folder only accessible by the study monitor.\nNo interim evaluation of data was carried out. All data underwent quality control before unblinding, and all exclusions of data points were performed at this stage. Data were excluded because of clear laboratory error and using the Grubbs test with \u03b1 set at 0.01.\n59\nOne imaging sequence was also excluded because of a technical mistake with an incorrect sequence. The primary and secondary end-points, as outlined in the\nResults\nsection, were determined before unblinding. An unpaired Student's\nt\n-test or Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest were used for interval data. For ordinal data, Fisher's exact test was used for two categories and chi-square for three or more categories. A\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical evaluation was performed using SPSS 23 and Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Results are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM), except when noted."

    "Methods": "Animal subjects\nCommon pig (\nSus scrofa domestica\n) and Hanford miniature swine heads were included in the study. Both the common pig and Hanford miniature swine are routinely utilized in brain injury research. The common pig (\nn\n=\u20094 heads, 8 TB) were \u223c5\u20137 months old at time of imaging. Hanford miniature swine (\nn\n=\u20094 heads, 8 TB) were 6 months old at time of imaging. The common pig heads were obtained from a local butcher (Cambridge, MA) and the Hanford miniature swine heads were procured from a research farm facility (Sinclair BioResources). Gender and weight at time of harvest were unknown. With regard to size, common pig and Hanford miniature swine reach sexual maturity between 3 and 5 months; however, they generally increase in size and weight after reaching maturity.\n39\n\nHRCT scans\nWhole porcine heads were placed in a high resolution multi-detector CT scanner (Discovery 750 HD, General Electric, Milwaukee, WI). Images were acquired with 0.625\u2009mm axial slices, a 0.2\u2009mm slice gap, and 120\u2009kVp and 240\u2009mA. To visualize the ossicular chain, a cone beam CT (CBCT, 3D Accuitomo, J. Morito MFG Corp., Kyoto, Japan) of the specimen was performed following TB dissection (see next section,\nPorcine TB dissection\nfor details). CBCT images were acquired at 90kV, 8mA, hi-resolution mode, exposure time 30.8\u2009sec, field of view 60\u2009\u00d7\u200960\u2009mm, with a slice thickness of 0.5\u2009mm. CBCT allows lower irradiation by trend\n40\nand higher accuracy because of the smaller voxel size,\n41\nand is often used clinically for TB imaging of the middle ear and skull base.\n\nPorcine TB dissection\nIn order to isolate the TBs for CBCT, the TBs were removed based on human TB techniques.\n42\nIn brief, the caudal portion of the skull was removed by an oscillating saw blade (Model 810, Stryker Corportation, MA) (\nFig. 1A\n). Next, the brain and dura mater were removed from the skull base. Removal of dura revealed the middle cranial fossa and the superior surface of petrous bone, which was easily identified because of the bright white appearance and high-density characteristic of the pig TB (\nFig. 1B,C\n). The TB was then isolated and removed using the autopsy saw with a circular cutter (1.5 inches or 38\u2009mm inside diameter and 51\u2009mm in length), (\nFig. 1A\n). The circular cutter was positioned at an acute angle to generate a cone of tissue containing part of the external auditory canal (EAC), middle ear, and inner ear (\nFig. 1D\n). The saw was taken down to soft tissue, which was then dissected free by an osteotome and heavy Mayo scissors. Muscular attachments to the styloid were typically the most medial aspect of the dissection. After the dissection, a TB HRCT scan was performed to exclude any sign of injury of the middle and inner ear in the TB plug, such as presence of fracture or ossicular chain disjunction (\nFig. 2A, B\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nTemporal bone extraction.\n(a)\nAutopsy saw and surgical instruments necessary for dissection of the porcine temporal bone.

To perform qualitative comparisons between normal human and porcine TB HRCT scan anatomy, the National Temporal Bone Hearing and Balance Pathology Resource Registry (Boston, MA) was used to identify normal human cases. All HRCT images were evaluated by a neuroradiologist (K.L.R.) and four otolaryngologists (R.M.K., S.R.B., A.K.R., E.D.K.) who have expertise in TB imaging and clinical anatomy.\nTo perform quantitative comparisons, DICOM data from the HRCT scans of the porcine heads were imported into OsiriX Lite v.9.0.2, in which measurements in the axial plane were obtained. Measurements included: maximal width and length of vestibule, canal lumen width and bony island width of the superior semicircular canal (SSCC) and lateral semicircular canal (LSCC), canal lumen width and inferior limb length of posterior semicircular canal (PSCC), vestibular aqueduct (VA) midpoint, and operculum. The mean values and standard deviation (SD) of the measurements were calculated, and then compared with normal historical human TB data as previously described.\n43\n,\n44\n\nThree-dimensional (3D) reconstructions\nDICOM data from the HRCTs of the heads and TB plug were imported into 3D Slicer 4.8, where the bone was manually segmented into 3D surface meshes and exported as stereolithography (STL) files. Files were imported into 3D modeling software where physically based rendering (PBR) materials and lighting were applied for model production."

    "Methods": "TBI cohort\nConsecutive patients consented to the UCLA Brain Injury Research Center (BIRC) study of moderate to severe TBI patients between 2010 and 2013 were included. Eligible patients were \u226518 years of age, were admitted within 24\u2009h of a non-penetrating brain injury had post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores \u22648 or deterioration to GCS \u22648 within 24\u2009h of injury, and required mechanical ventilation and ICP monitoring. Patients with terminal illness, pre-existing neurological disorders, or spinal cord injury were excluded from the study. UCLA Medical Institutional Review Board for human research approved the protocol and informed consent was received from the patients' legal representatives. TBI patients were treated in accordance with the Brain Trauma Foundation and American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS)/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) TBI Guidelines. General management goals included maintenance of ICP <20\u2009mm Hg and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) >60\u2009mm Hg and were obtained using a standardized treatment protocol including head elevation, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, jugular venous monitoring, sedation, and more.\n6\u20138\nFollowing consent, blood was drawn daily, subject to constraints including catheter removal or declining health status. Blood was collected in heparin-coated tubes and immediately placed on ice. After centrifugation, samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until the time of analysis. Samples selected for the following analysis were the first blood sample collected to include both arterial and jugular venous blood. Neurological outcome was assessed at time of discharge and at 6 months post-injury by research staff using the Glasgow Outcome Scale extended (GOSe). Sedative medications at the time of blood draw were determined by reviewing patient charts. Enteral nutrition data were extracted from the UCLA BIRC database, and reflect the cumulative kilocalories delivered in the preceding 24\u2009h.\n\nHC subjects\nHealthy volunteers were recruited with posted notices and Internet advertisements from UCLA and surrounding areas, and consented to participate in a lactate tracer infusion study, as described in the studies by Glenn and coworkers.\n8\n,\n9\nInclusion criteria for controls included no history of TBI, being weight stable for 6 months, not currently receiving medications, and having normal lung function. Control subjects had a jugular venous bulb catheter and radial arterial line placed ahead of the infusion study. In our analysis, arterial and jugular blood drawn prior to the tracer infusion study was included.\n\nMass spectrometry protocol\nPlasma was thawed and prepared for analysis by deproteinization with methanol (Sigma Aldrich) followed by solvent removal. Prior to deproteinization of plasma, we added 5\u2009nmol DL-Norvaline (Sigma Aldrich) to 20\u2009\u03bcL plasma to serve as an internal standard. Metabolite relative concentrations were determined by mass spectrometry methods as previously published.\n10\nLCMS was analyzed with an UltiMate 3000RSLC (Thermo Scientific) coupled to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The Q Exactive was run with polarity switching (+4.00\u2009kV / \u22124.00\u2009kV) in full scan mode with an m/z range of 70\u20131050. Separation was achieved using (A) 5\u2009mM NH4AcO (pH 9.9), and (B) ACN. The gradient started with 15% (A) going to 90% (A) over 18\u2009min, followed by an isocratic step for 9\u2009min and reversal to the initial 15% (A) for 7\u2009min. Metabolites were quantified with TraceFinder 3.3 (Thermo Scientific) using accurate mass measurements (\u22643\u2009ppm) and retention times established by running pure standards.\nA total of six replicates of all arterial and jugular venous samples were analyzed by LCMS, totaling 378 samples. Plasma samples were prepared for mass spectrometry analysis in eight batches, separating replicates one through three from replicates four through six between analytical batches. Quality control samples, including a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549, ATCC, Manassas, VA), were run in each batch. A total of 156 specific metabolites were assigned across all batches. Metabolites that were not detected in any one batch, in any one patient's samples, or in at least half of the samples, were removed from the analysis, leaving 76 metabolites. Metabolites were categorized using the\nKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes\n(KEGG),\n11\nthe Human Metabolome Database web site,\n12\nand MetScape pathway-based networks.\n13\nSeven metabolites were not products or reactants of human cellular metabolism and, instead, were products of microbial metabolism or phytochemicals; these were removed from the analysis, leaving 69 metabolites.\nBatch effects were removed in R, version 3.4.0,\n14\nusing the multivariate integrative method (MINT), as implemented in the\nmixOmics\npackage.\n15\n,\n16\nFollowing batch correction of the full data set, metabolite concentrations were centered and unit-variance scaled prior to further analyses.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData analysis was conducted in R, version 3.4.0.\n14\nA robust equivalent of the\nt\ntest, the Yuen test, was used to compare between TBI and HC cohort demographics.\n17\nFisher's Exact Test was used to compare sex ratios. The dependent Yuen test modified was used to compare GCS and GOSe scores over time.\nAll univariate analyses were conducted on log-transformed relative metabolite levels. Univariate analysis of the 69 metabolites was accomplished by mixed-effects modeling with fixed effect of group (TBI or HC) and random effect of ID to account for replicate samples, analyzing arterial and jugular venous blood samples separately.\n18\nAll\np\nvalues were corrected for multiple comparisons by the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg method to control for a 5% false discovery rate. We considered the test results significant when the multiple comparison-adjusted\np\nvalues were below a 0.05 threshold. We also performed univariate mixed-effects analysis to compare metabolite levels between injury severities (fixed effect GCS3 vs. GCS not 3, random effect ID) and between arterial and jugular venous samples (fixed effect blood, random effect ID). In the case of significant differences between arterial and jugular venous blood, post-hoc mixed-effects modeling was performed, including group and the group\u2013blood interaction fixed effects, followed by model selection with multi-model inference. The best approximating model was chosen from all possible models by minimizing residuals and comparing Akaike information criteria (AIC).\n19\nFinally, for analyzing the association between metabolite levels and enteral nutrition received, the percentage bend correlation coefficient was determined using the average of the log-transformed metabolite levels.\nMultivariate analysis was performed on arterial and jugular venous blood data sets separately using the\nmixOmics\npackage.\n15\nPrior to multivariate analysis, each subjects' six replicate samples were averaged using the trimmed mean. Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed to compare the 69 metabolites quantified in each TBI (26) and HC (6) sample. Group separation in PC scores plots was defined as a significant difference among PC scores (\np\n<\u20090.05) with linear modeling. Separation of PC scores based on characteristics of TBI patients, such as 6 month outcomes, injury severity, or medications received at the time of blood draw, were also defined as a significant difference between PC scores (either PC1 or PC2\np\n<\u20090.05) using linear modeling.\nMetabolite contributions to separating between groups were assessed in two steps. First, the scalar projection of a metabolite loading on the axis connecting the average HC PC score from the average TBI score, with slope\nm\n, was calculated as follows.\nMetabolites with larger scalar projections are considered to contribute more to group separation than those with smaller scalar projections. Second, the scalar offset of a metabolite from the axis with slope\nm\nand scalar projection\nsp\nwas calculated as follows\nwhich is proportional to the angle between vectors. The absolute value of the ratio between a metabolite's scalar projection and scalar offset increases as the scalar offset decreases. Therefore, the largest contributors have a large scalar projection and/or a small scalar offset with moderate scalar projection."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAdult female C57BL/6 mice (\nn\n=\u200936, 10 weeks old, 18\u201322\u2009g) were purchased from Charles River Inc. (Wilmington, MA). Mice were randomly divided into four groups: sham (\nn\n=\u20096) and injury displacements of 0.2\u2009mm (\nn\n=\u200910), 0.5\u2009mm (\nn\n=\u200910), and 0.8\u2009mm (\nn\n=\u200910). Sham-operated mice received the same surgical procedures, including laminectomy, as the SCI groups although they did not sustain an SCI. All animal care, handling, and surgery were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council) and the Guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Indiana University School of Medicine.\n\nSurgery\nA contusive SCI on mice was produced at the 10th thoracic vertebral level (T11/12 spinal cord segments) using the LISA impactor as described.\n14\nPrior to surgery, the mouse was anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (87.7\u2009mg/kg)/xylazine (12.3\u2009mg/kg). A midline skin incision was made over the lower thoracic spine. The muscles were separated from the T9-11 spinous processes and laminae, and the mouse was placed into the U-shaped customized vertebral stabilizer. The T10 facets were fixed bilaterally with the stabilizer, and the T10 laminectomy was performed to expose the dura over the spinal cord. The pressure of the nitrogen tank that controls the impact tip was adjusted to 18\u2009psi or 124\u2009kPa. The U-shaped stabilizer with the mouse was loaded onto the stage of the LISA and the height of the dura/spinal cord was adjusted directly under the impactor that was monitored by the laser beam. We reported a detailed video demonstration of the step-by-step procedures for producing a contusive SCI in mice using LISA.\n14\nAfter injury, the U-shaped stabilizer was detached from the stage, and the mouse was removed from the stabilizer. The injury area was checked and, if present, bleeding was stopped. The muscles and skin were sutured in layers with 3-0 silk surgical suture (Henry Schein, Melville, NY). The injured mouse received subcutaneous (SC) injection of buprenorphine (0.01\u20130.05\u2009mg/kg every 8\u201312\u2009h for 48\u2009h) and 1\u2009mL saline for hydration. The mouse was placed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled cage until it recovered from anesthesia. Soft food and water were provided during recovery. Manual bladder expression was performed twice daily until reflex bladder emptying was established.\n\nBehavioral assessments\nFour behavior assessments including Basso Mouse Scale (BMS), grid-walking, TreadScan, and Hargreaves tests were employed. Prior to surgery, each mouse was trained in the open field 4\u2009min for BMS and on the grid 3\u2009min for grid-walking per day for up to 3 days. Baseline scores of the four assessments were recorded. Methods for individual behavior assessments are described in the next sections.\nBMS locomotor test\nThe BMS locomotor test was performed weekly up to 5 weeks post-SCI according to a method published previously.\n15\nEach mouse was placed in an open field (diameter 42 inch) and observed for 4\u2009min by two observers who were blinded to the experimental groups. The movements were scored based on the joint movement, weight support, plantar stepping, paw position, coordination, and trunk and tail control following the standard guide.\n15\nThe scores ranged from 9 to 0 and represent normal movement to complete paralysis, respectively.\n15\nBMS was recorded before injury and at 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days post-injury.\nGrid-walking\nThe grid-walking test assesses the ability of a mouse to place its paws on the rungs of a grid accurately during spontaneous exploration. An elevated metal rectangle grid (12\u2009\u00d7\u200936 inch\n2\nwith each grid cell 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5 inch\n2\n) and 16 inches above a table top was used for the hindlimb drop error test. Each mouse was placed in the center of the grid for 3\u2009min. A one-foot drop error was counted when the hindlimb paw was entirely dropping through the grid with all toes and heel below the grid surface. The total number of foot drop errors and total number of steps were recorded by video. Two observers who were blinded to the experiment analyzed the video and counted the steps.\n16\u201318\nThe grid-walking test was performed on the day before surgery and on days 21 and 35 post-SCI. Only those mice with consistent plantar stepping (BMS \u22655) were tested on the grid.\nTreadScan\nGait analysis using TreadScan (CleverSys Inc, Reston, VA) allows highly sensitive, noninvasive evaluation of extremities through a forced locomotion (treadmill) to indicate pathophysiological conditions occurring following SCI.\n19\nTreadScan recording and analysis followed a reported description.\n19\nBriefly, each mouse walked on the transparent treadmill for 20\u2009sec with a speed of 7\u2009cm/sec before injury and at 6 weeks post-injury. A high speed digital video camera recorded all the movements. The TreadScan software identified each individual paw profile, such as initial foot contact, stance time, print length, track width, and toe spread. For each 20\u2009sec session, four to six consecutive step cycles of consistent walking underwent video analysis. Only the mice with consistent plantar stepping (BMS \u22655) were tested on the treadmill.\nHargreaves test. The noxious thermal stimulus test was used with the Hargreaves apparatus which was set at 30% intensity 20\u2009sec cutoff time to avoid paw skin damage according to our previous protocol.\n20\nBriefly, each mouse was placed on the pre-warmed (34\u00b0C) glass surface (IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA), and a heat source stimulated the hindlimb plantar paw under the glass surface until the paw withdrew from the noxious thermal stimulus. The latency time (sec) of paw withdraw was recorded. Each paw was tested three times.\n20\n,\n21\nThe Hargreaves test was performed before injury and on day 21 post-injury. Only those mice with consistent plantar placing of the paw (BMS \u22653) were tested.\n\nHistological assessments\nA 3\u2009cm segment of the spinal cord containing the injury epicenter was dissected out and removed after perfusion with 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (30\u2009mL) and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (30\u2009mL) on day 45 post-injury. The spinal cord segments were transferred to 4% PFA overnight and then transferred to 30% sucrose in 0.01\u2009M PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 week.\n22\nOne centimeter of the cord segment at the injury epicenter was subsequently embedded with OCT embedding solution (Fisher HealthCare, Waltham, MA) and cut with a cryostat into 25-\u03bcM-thick cross-sections and mounted on frosted slides in five identical sets, eight slides per set, and eight sections per slide. One set of the sections/slides was stained with cresyl violet eosin for lesion area measurement, and another set of sections was used for Luxol Fast Blue staining for myelin quantification. Areas of lesion and spared white matter (WM) were measured using Olympus BX60 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Neurolucida System (MicroBrightField, Colchester, VT).\n23\nBriefly, at the epicenter, the area of the lesion, spared WM, and the total cord were outlined and measured. The lesion area (%) was calculated as lesion area divided by the cord area; the spared WM (%) was calculated as spared WM area divided by the cord area. All values were reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM) (sham\nn\n=\u20096, 0.2\u2009mm\nn\n=\u200910, 0.5\u2009mm\nn\n=\u20098, 0.8\u2009mm\nn\n=\u20094).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Data were presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM values. One way or two way ANOVA or repeated measures as appropriate followed by Tukey multiple comparison test were used to determine statistical significance among multiple groups with one factor, or multiple groups with two factors. XY analyses were obtained by correlation and linear regression. The difference was considered significant when\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Study population\nThis study was a secondary analysis of the publicly available, prospective PECARN cohort study of children with mild head injuries.\n18\nThe details of this study have been described previously, but briefly, this study included children younger than 18 years who were enrolled in one of 25 participating EDs in North America. Enrollment occurred from 2004 to 2006. To maximize the capture of clinically relevant outcomes, research coordinators reviewed inpatient records and conducted follow-up telephone interviews with patients' guardians 7 to 90 days post-ED evaluation. When guardians could not be reached, additional hospital and county records were reviewed.\nWithin the PECARN cohort, we included children with GCS scores of 13\u201315 who had a CT scan performed in the ED that did not show ICI. Consistent with the PECARN methods, ICI was defined as intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral edema, skull diastasis, midline shift, pneumocephalus, significantly depressed skull fracture (depressed by at least the width of the skull), traumatic infarction, diffuse axonal injury, herniation, shear injury, or sigmoid sinus thrombosis identified on CT.\n18\nMildly depressed skull fractures (i.e. depressed less than the width of the skull) and non-depressed skull fractures were not considered ICI, keeping with the original PECARN terminology.\n18\nImaging findings were extracted from radiology reports and approved by site principal investigators. A quality review also was conducted, assessing all positive and any unusual findings. The PECARN cohort excluded patients with trivial injury presentations (e.g. ground-level falls, running into stationary objects), as well as those with penetrating TBI, pre-existing comorbid neurological disease, and bleeding disorders.\n\nPredictor variables\nAmong the variables collected by PECARN, we focused on those thought to be the most clinically relevant in the post-CT evaluation of mTBI patients. The full list of potential predictors evaluated is shown in the\nAppendix Table 1\n. All of these variables\u2014except scalp hematoma\u2014had kappa coefficients of at least 0.5, indicating at least moderate inter-rater reliability.\n18\n,\n19\nFor the \u201cskull fracture\u201d variable, we grouped together non-depressed and mildly depressed fractures (combining those depressed less than the width of the skull) since we found that the event rate for the two groups was similar. Patients with fractures depressed by the width of the skull or greater were considered to have ICI and were excluded from the analysis.\n8\nPresence of a neurological deficit was defined as any abnormality noted in the cranial nerve, motor, sensory, or reflex assessment.\n18\nThe composite variable for any neurological deficit was analyzed for predictive modeling, but the frequency of each subtype of deficit also was reported for descriptive purposes.\n\nOutcome variable\nThe study dataset did not include variables to reflect the potential benefit of a brief overnight admission (e.g., intravenous hydration). Further, given evidence demonstrating that this population is at exceedingly low risk of needing neurosurgical intervention,\n10\n,\n11\nmany potential indications for hospital admission relate to brief, symptomatic management (e.g., nausea or pain). While no decision tool will absolutely distinguish which patients may derive any potential benefit from hospital admission, our goal was to focus on those patients with more persistent and prolonged TBI-related difficulties that would be challenging to manage at home. Therefore, for the primary study outcome we used EIM, defined as hospitalization for 2 or more nights due to the TBI, with the goal of providing physicians and families with an outlook of the child's near-term clinical course. While patients with extracranial injuries were included in the study, this outcome of EIM excluded patients with prolonged admissions due to social reasons, workup of non-accidental trauma, or other extracranial injuries. However, specific indications for inpatient TBI management (e.g., seizure treatment or intravenous hydration) were not recorded. To the extent possible, we included in this outcome patients initially discharged home but later readmitted for EIM. As secondary outcomes, we evaluated the rate of intubation, neurosurgical intervention, and death due to TBI.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe found that some variables in the risk prediction analysis had missing data. These missing data were treated as previously reported.\n8\nFor dichotomous variables with less than 5% missing data, we assumed that missing indicated not present (i.e., \u201c0\u201d values). We verified that this assumption did not significantly alter the results by conducting a sensitivity analysis where such missing data were instead treated as missing in a complete case analysis (see\nAppendix\n). For other variables with missing data, we used multiple imputation with 10 imputed datasets, using previously published approaches for missing data exploration and imputation.\n20\u201322\nThe details of our imputation techniques have been reported previously.\n8\nAfter imputation, multi-variable logistic regression was used to develop a model to predict the risk of EIM. Univariate analyses were first conducted with potential predictors, and variables with\np\n<\u20090.20 were entered into the multi-variable analysis. Forward selection was used to select variables for the final multi-variable model that had\np\n<\u20090.10 in 50% of more of the imputed datasets. Rubin's rules were used to combine\np\nvalues and regression coefficients across the imputed datasets.\n23\nUsing this approach, we developed an initial model that included all variables identified by the automatic selection procedure. This \u201clarge\u201d model was further refined to maximize the simplicity and clinical utility of the final decision tool. For example, although length of loss of consciousness was initially selected for the multi-variable model, using history of loss of consciousness (yes/no) instead improved the ease of clinical use with a negligible impact on the model's overall predictive ability\u2014as evaluated by the C-statistic. In addition, we recognized that the size of the initial 10-variable model made it impractical for routine use. Consequently, we derived an abridged model by evaluating the model beta coefficients, first-differences of each variable, variable prevalence, and the clinical significance of each variable in the larger model. In this context, first-difference refers to the difference in predicted risk between two levels of a variable, holding all other factors constant (e.g., the difference in risk between yes vs. no headache when all other variables are constant).\nWe evaluated the discrimination of both models using the C-statistic, which represented the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Bootstrapping was used to obtain the bias-corrected confidence interval of the C-statistic. We evaluated calibration using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, which compares observed versus predicted values.\n24\nTo evaluate whether model performance varied between very young and older children, we tested the discrimination of the final model in children younger than 2 years versus children age 2 years or older.\nBased on the final multi-variable model, we created a clinical risk score using previously described approaches, assigning integer point values to each factor in the model.\n25\nThe details of this process are described in the\nAppendix\n. After the CIDSS\n2\nscore was finalized, its performance was evaluated by examining the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and negative likelihood ratio for different point score cutoffs. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals were calculated using exact methods as previously described.\n8\nStatistical analyses were done using R statistical software and related packages (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria),\n21\n,\n22\n,\n26\nalong with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Statistically significant outcomes were defined based on two-tailed\np\nvalues less than 0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experiments were conducted in accordance with the institutional guidelines of Sapporo Medical University. The use of animals in this study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Sapporo Medical University.\n\nPreparation of MSCs from rat bone marrow\nRat MSCs were prepared following a protocol used in our previous studies.\n16\n,\n17\nIn brief, bone marrow was obtained from the femoral bones of adult rats. The marrow was then diluted to 20\u2009mL with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA), 2\u2009mM l-glutamine (Sigma), 100\u2009U/mL penicillin, and 0.1\u2009mg/mL streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), and incubated for 3 days (5% CO\n2\n, 37\u00b0C). When cultures had almost reached confluence, the adherent cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma) and subcultured at 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n4\ncells/mL. Phenotypic analysis of the MSC surface antigen was performed using anti-CD45, CD73, CD90, and CD106 antibodies.\n22\nFollowing three passages, the MSCs were collected for infusion.\n\nSCI model\nContusive SCI was made as described previously.\n17\n,\n20\nBriefly, adult male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats at 8\u20139 weeks (250\u2013300\u2009g) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of ketamine (90\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (4\u2009mg/kg). Following incision, the T9 vertebra was stabilized by clamping the rostral T8 and caudal T10 vertebral bodies with forceps, and a dorsal laminectomy was performed at the T9 to 10 level. A 130\u2009kDyn contusion was then delivered using the Infinite Horizons impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Lexington, KY). After the injury, actual injured forces were recorded and compared with predicted severities. There was \u223c < 0.05% variation between these values, which is consistent with a previous report.\n23\nAppropriate postoperative care, including manual bladder expression twice a day, was provided for all animals. Rats were housed at a temperature of 24\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00b0C and 50% humidity.\n\nTransplantation procedure\nOnly rats with Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores\n24\ndisplaying 0 points at 1 day after SCI induction were included in this study. The SCI rats with BBB scores of 0 points were randomized and received a single intravenous infusion of MSCs at 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n6\ncells in 1.0\u2009mL of fresh DMEM or vehicle (1.0\u2009mL fresh DMEM alone) via the femoral vein 1 day after SCI induction. All rats were injected daily with cyclosporine A (10\u2009mg/kg, IP).\n16\n,\n17\n,\n25\nIn addition, intact rats were used as sham.\n\nBehavioral testing\nOpen field locomotor function was assessed using the BBB scale by an evaluator blinded to treatment condition. Rats were scored at 1 day after SCI induction (immediately prior to infusion) and 3 days post-infusion (\nn\n=\u20097/group, time point).\n\nRNA purification\nAnimals (MSC group,\nn\n=\u20097/time point; vehicle group,\nn\n=\u20097/time points; sham group,\nn\n=\u20095) were euthanized using deep anesthesia with ketamine (75\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg, IP) and the brains were dissected. The cerebral cortex (motor cortical region) was extracted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. After homogenization, total RNA was purified using the RNeasy Plus mini kit (QIAGEN, Venlo, The Netherlands). RNA quality was assessed using the Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 nano kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Samples showing RNA integrity number (RIN) >7.0 were selected for subsequent use in this study (\nTable S1\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n).\n\nMicroarray hybridization and analysis\nThe Clariom\n\u2122\nD/Gene Chip\n\u00ae\nRat Transcriptome Array (RTA 1.0., Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used with 100\u2009ng input. The images of hybridized microarrays were processed using Expression Console software (Affymetrix). Raw expression values obtained directly from CEL files were preprocessed using the Signal Space Transformation-Robust Multichip Analysis\n18\npipeline as previously described.\n26\nA single microarray analysis was performed in this study. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using one way ANOVA with a cutoff\np\nvalue <0.05 and a fold change (FC) >1.5 or <\u22121.5. A volcano plot and heat map were generated using the statistical language\nR\nver.3.4.2 (\nFig. S1\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n).\n\nQuantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)\nThe Super Script\n\u00ae\nVILO\n\u2122\ncDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used for reverse transcription. A 100\u2009ng total mRNA input was used for qRT-PCR. TaqMan\n\u00ae\nUniversal Master Mix II with Uracil-N glycosylase (UNG), and TaqMan\n\u00ae\nGene Expression assays were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (\nGapdh\n, Rn01775763_g1;\nKcnip2\n, Rn01411450_g1; lipid phosphate phosphatase-related protein type 4 [\nLppr4\n], Rn01522267_m1;\nPde10a\n, Rn00673152_m1; calcium binding protein 7 [\nCabp7\n], Rn01443564_m1; plakophilins-2 [\nPkp2\n], Rn01404502_m1;\nScn3b\n, Rn01422019_m1; nuclear receptor binding protein 2 [\nNrbp2\n], Rn01505756_m1;\nSik1\n, Rn00572495_m1;\nFos\n, Rn02396759_m1;\nDusp1\n, Rn00678341_g1;\nBtg2\n, Rn00568504_m1;\nIer2\n, Rn02531674_s1;\nCyr61\n, Rn00580055_m1;\nApold1\n, Rn02131262_s1; Id2, Rn01495280_m1). qRT-PCR was performed in triplicate using PRISM7500 with 7500 software v2.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Thermal cycling was performed at 50\u00b0C for 2\u2009min and at 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009sec and of 60\u00b0C for 1\u2009min. The \u0394CT was calculated against the endogenous control (\nGapdh\n), and the \u0394\u0394CT was calculated against the \u0394CT of the sham. FC was also calculated using the comparative Ct method.\n27\n\nPrediction of transcription factor binding domains\nTranscriptional binding domains in the gene loci of interest were determined using the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser (\nhttps://genome-asia.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?redirect=manual&source=genome.ucsc.edu\n) with the JASPAR custom track (\nhttp://jaspar.genereg.net/\n). The information of functional genomic domains and cross-species conservation was downloaded from the VISTA Genome Browser (\nhttp://pipeline.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/gateway2\n).\n\nGene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)\nGSEA\n28\nwas performed as detailed in the online\nsupplementary materials\n(see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n).\n\nData deposition\nThe data reported in this article (\nTables S2\nand\nS3\n) have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database:\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo\n(accession no. GSE108168) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n).\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were subjected to statistical analyses using TAC version 3.1.0.5 (Affymetrix\n\u00ae\n) and JMP\n\u00ae\nversion 12.2.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Comparison of the BBB behavioral scores between MSC and vehicle-treated animals was performed using the Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest. Microarray statistical analyses were performed using one way ANOVA. Correlation between mRNA expression and BBB behavioral score was evaluated using Pearson's correlation coefficients (PCC). Continuous data were assessed for normality using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test. The continuous data with normality were analyzed by one way ANOVA, and the Tukey\u2013Kramer test was used for post-hoc comparisons. Results were expressed as the means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM."

    "Methods": "Participants were 20 women recruited from women's shelters, domestic violence programs, and word-of-mouth. To be included in the study, at least one incident of physical abuse needed to be reported. Age and race of the women were as follows: mean age\u2009=\u200932.3 (standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u200910.9); 55% African American, 30% Caucasian, 10% Latina, and 5% mixed race. The mean reading achievement of the group, as assessed with the Wide Range Achievement Test 3 (WRAT-3)32Reading measure was 89.7 (SD\u2009=\u200912.6). Women reported a mean 11.8 (SD\u2009=\u20092.0) years of education, and 15% were currently employed. (If a woman received a general equivalency diploma, we considered that as 12 years of education. Educational level and vocational status were missing for three subjects.) Functional connectivity and other data (e.g., post-concussive symptom information) were reported on most of this sample in a previous publication.16\n\nWomen were phone screened for eligibility criteria and excluded for potentially confounding conditions (e.g., alcohol or drug dependence within the past 6 months, current bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or autism, autoimmune disorders such as lupus, current pregnancy). Women with non-partner\u2013related mTBIs occurring within the past 3 months or any past history of moderate to severe non-partner related TBI were excluded. Women with questionable substance use issues (n=\u20093) or who were currently taking psychotropic medications (n=\u20092) were identified, and primary analyses were conducted with and without these women included. Finally, because we wanted to focus on the effects of mTBIs rather than all TBIs (which could also include moderate or severe TBIs), we also excluded four women who had sustained severe IPV-related TBIs but otherwise met all inclusion/exclusion criteria and had full datasets. Here, we present data without those women included (n=\u200920) but note that results showed a similar pattern when including them in the analyses (n=\u200924).\n\nWomen provided written informed consent, and the local institutional review board human subjects committee approved the study. The study was conducted in one session, and the brain injury interview was always administered before cognitive testing, which was always administered before scanning. Session length varied but averaged close to 3\u20134\u2009h. Of note, retrospective histories of abuse and mTBIs are critical to obtain, as most women never seek medical attention and consequently have no medical documentation of their TBIs.16\n\nMeasures\nBrain injury\nPartner- and non-partner\u2013related mTBI was assessed using an identical protocol to that used in previously published reports.\n4\n,\n16\nUsing a semi-structured interview, women were asked questions about potential traumas to the head that might have resulted in an alteration in consciousness (AIC), consistent with the diagnostic criteria for TBI by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine Special Interest Group on Mild TBI.\n33\nAs such, a TBI was defined as: \u201cA traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function, as manifested by at least one of the following: any loss of consciousness; any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the accident; any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident (e.g., feeling dazed, disoriented, or confused); focal neurologic deficit(s) that may or may not be transient.\u201d For example, \u201cAfter anything your partner has ever done to you, have you ever lost consciousness or blacked out?\u201d If the subject responded affirmatively, follow-up questions would be used to determine severity of the injury (based on duration of AIC, etc.), as well as the first, last, and number of times the mTBI occurred. Additionally, women subjected to IPV are often strangled. Since the effects of anoxic or hypoxic insults to the brain are uncertain, we also assessed for AIC as a result of strangulation. All women who reported any strangulation-induced AICs also reported a high number of repetitive mTBIs with the exception of one woman. An mTBI was considered mild if a loss of consciousness was \u226430\u2009min and/or the post-traumatic amnesia was \u226424\u2009h.\n33\nFinally, identical to previous work\n4\n,\n16\na brain injury severity score was created based on number, recency, and severity of AICs. The frequency score was the number of TBI-related AICs reported by the women. The recency score was based on the number of weeks since the most recent brain injury. Whether a brain injury was mild versus moderate-to-severe was defined as noted above. A score was then generated based on the following criteria: frequency, 1\u20135 brain injuries\u2009=\u20091, 6\u201310 brain injuries\u2009=\u20092, 11\u201315 brain injuries\u2009=\u20093, 16 or more brain injuries\u2009=\u20094; recency, more than 52 weeks ago\u2009=\u20090, 27\u201352 weeks ago\u2009=\u20091, 14\u201326 weeks ago\u2009=\u20092, 0\u201313 weeks ago\u2009=\u20093; and severity, never sustained a moderate-to-severe brain injury\u2009=\u20090, sustained a moderate-to-severe brain injury\u2009=\u20091. The three scores were added to create the brain injury score. As noted earlier, we excluded women with moderate to severe TBIs so the score for all the women in the current study reflects only number and recency of mTBIs. Non-partner related mTBI information was acquired to ensure exclusion criteria were met.\nCognition\nTo assess whether cognitive functioning was related to the FA findings that were associated with the brain injury score, we administered a brief neuropsychological battery. We examined cognitive processes, namely learning, memory, and cognitive flexibility, that were associated with mTBIs and functional connectivity in our previous work. Memory and learning were assessed using the Sum of Trials 1\u20135 and Long Delay Free Recall scores from the California Verbal Learning Test II (CVLT II).\n34\nWomen were read a list of words five times and asked to recall as many words as possible immediately following each reading, and after a 20-min delay. The sum of words recalled from trials 1\u20135 served as a measure of learning, whereas the words recalled after the delay served as a measure of memory. Cognitive flexibility was assessed with the Trail Making Test Part B.\n35\nWomen were required to connect a series of numbers and letters in ascending order alternating in numerical and alphabetical sequence.\nTo account for effects of potential confounds, we also administered questionnaires to assess abuse as an adult and child, as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic-stress disorder.\nAcademic reading achievement, as one index of premorbid cognitive functioning, was assessed with the Reading test of the Wide Range Achievement Test 3 (WRAT-3).\n32\nAdult and childhood abuse\nPartner abuse was assessed via the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS),\n36\nwith an additional 10 items from the Severity of Violence Against Women scale\n37\nto assess for more severe forms of violence. The CTS is a 28-item scale that measures the extent to which a participant is exposed to violence within families or in the setting of an intimate relationship. Total score for the past year was used as a measure of partner abuse severity. History of childhood abuse and neglect was assessed with the 34-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).\n38\nThe CTQ is a measure of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, as well as physical and emotional neglect. Participants are asked to indicate on a 5-point scale (1\u2009=\u2009never true; 5\u2009=\u2009very often true) the degree to which they experienced a range of traumatic events as a child (e.g., \u201cSomeone in my family yelled and screamed at me.\u201d). The CTQ has been associated with interview-based ratings\n38\nand independent corroborations\n39\nof childhood maltreatment.\nPsychopathology\nDimensional levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptomatology were assessed with the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ)\n40\nand the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale IV (CAPS-2),\n41\nrespectively. The MASQ is a 62-item questionnaire that assesses non-specific anxiety, depression, and mixed symptomatology, along with anxiety-and depression-specific symptoms. One total MASQ score was computed for each woman. The CAPS-2 is a semi-structured clinical interview used to assess the frequency and intensity of PTSD symptoms. It is a well-established, valid, and reliable measure.\n41\n,\n42\nOne total severity score was computed for each woman.\n\nImaging procedures\nDiffusion imaging data were acquired on a 3-Tesla Siemens Magnetom TrioTim scanner with a 32-channel head coil (other imaging scans were also acquired and are reported in previous work). A 9-min diffusion-weighted imaging scan was acquired with the following parameters: 68 slices per volume; 1.9\u2009\u00d7\u20091.9\u2009\u00d7\u20091.9\u2009mm\n3\nvoxels; b\u2009=\u2009700\u2009sec/mm\n2\n; 60 diffusion-encoding directions; 10 non-diffusion-weighted B0 images; echo time\u2009=\u200982\u2009msec; repetition time\u2009=\u20097640\u2009msec).\nDiffusion imaging data were corrected for motion and eddy currents using affine transformations (FSL).\n43\nBrain masks were edited using Slicer 3D software (\nwww.slicer.org\n) and manually edited.\n44\nThe diffusion MRI data were then processed using a Matlab code that estimates DTI parameters corrected for CSF contamination.\n45\nTo define our ROIs, the diffusion scans of each subject were non-linearly registered (FSL) to the DTI FA Atlas provided by the Enhanced Neuroimaging Genetics by Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) DTI Working Group at the University of California,\n46\nin MNI space. Then the FA images were used to generate a white matter skeleton using the Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) processing pipeline.\n47\nThe ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels atlas provided by the Johns Hopkins University DTI workgroup,\n48\nwas then used to extract and average FA ROI values for the posterior and superior corona radiata (P/SCR) as well as the posterior thalamic radiation (PTR;\nFig 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRegions of interest for fractional anisotropy measures.

    "Methods": "Adult female, Sprague-Dawley rats (n=\u200948; 250\u2013280\u2009g; Envigo\u00ae) were housed at the Drexel University College of Medicine animal care facility. Experimental procedures were conducted with approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and following the National Research Council Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All animals received a lateralized moderate contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) located at cervical levels 3\u20134, which results in the loss of phrenic motoneurons and spinal interneurons (SpINs) as well as persistent respiratory deficits as measured by response to respiratory challenges (hypoxia, hypercapnia). Animals were blindly separated into one of three groups (vehicle, NPCs, or NPC/V2a INs) and decoded at the end of experiments and analysis. V2a INs were engineered from mouse embryonic stem cells,57whereas NPCs were derived from the developing rat spinal cord (E13.5 rat).48NPCs were injected as either single cells or were aggregated for 2 days prior to injection. V2a INs were combined with NPCsin vitrofor 2 days to form NPC-V2a cellular aggregates, which were then injected into the contused spinal cord.\n\nPreparation of NPCs\nSpinal cord tissue was dissected from E13.5 Fischer 344 GFP or alkaline phosphatase (AP) transgenic rat embryos, obtained from time-mated dams. NPCs were derived from the mechanically and enzymatically (Trypsin; Life Technologies #25200-056) dissociated spinal cord tissues and cultured as previously described,\n48\nand stored in liquid nitrogen until needed. Cells were thawed 1 day prior to aggregation by seeding 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n6\nNPCs onto poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, #P8920) and laminin (ThermoFisher, #23017015) coated T75 flasks and cultured in NPC Medium comprised of: DMEM/F12 containing 25\u2009mg/mL bovine serum albumin, B-27 supplement (Life Technologies, #17504-044), N2 supplement (Life Technologies, #17502-048), 10\u2009ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; Peprotech, #450-10, Rocky Hill, NJ), and 20\u2009ng/mL neurotrophin-3 (NT-3; Peprotech, #450-03;\nFig. 1A\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nGeneration and aggregation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and V2a interneurons (INs).\n(A)\nNPCs isolated from E13.5 rat spinal cords were stored frozen and thawed 1 day prior to aggregation.\n(B)\nChx10-Puro embryonic stem cells (ESCs) expressing TdTomato were induced using a 2\n-\n/4\n+\nprotocol followed by 24\u2009h of puromycin selection for V2a INs.\n(C)\nSchematic showing aggregation protocol. Populations of NPCs were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with TdTomato-V2a cells and seeded into an AggreWell plate. After 2 days of culture, spherical aggregates form in the dish (green fluorescent protein/TdTomato, NPC/V2a INs, respectively shown in\nD-F\n), which are then resuspended in fresh media and washed in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution prior to transplantation (F). Scale bars are as indicated.\n(G)\nExperimental timeline of the study.\n\nNeural inductions from selectable embryonic stem cell lines\nA selectable Chx10-Puro mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) line constitutively expressing TdTomato was cultured and differentiated as previously described\n57\nto produce V2a INs. ESCs were cultured on gelatin-coated T75 flasks in complete media containing 1000\u2009U/mL leukemia inhibitory factor (Millipore, #ESG1106) and 100\u2009\u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (Life Technologies, #21985-023). The cell line was differentiated using a 2\n-\n/4\n+\ninduction protocol (\nFig. 1B\n). On Day 0, 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n6\nESCs were seeded into 10\u2009mL of DFK5 media on an agar-coated 100\u2009mm petri dish for 2 days to form embryoid bodies (EBs). On Day 2, the media was replenished with DFK5 containing 10\u2009nM retinoic acid (Sigma, #R2625) and 1\u2009\u03bcM purmorphamine (EMD Millipore, #540223); on Day 4, the media were replaced with DFK5 containing 10\u2009nM RA, 1\u2009\u03bcM purmorphamine and 5\u2009\u03bcM (N-N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-L-alanyl)-(S)-phenylglycine-t-butyl-ester) (DAPT; Sigma, #D5942). EBs were dissociated and re-suspended in a selection media of DFK5NB containing B-27 supplement, glutaMAX (Life Technologies, #35050-061), 5\u2009ng/mL glial-derived neurotrophic factor (Peprotech, #450-10), 5\u2009ng/mL brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; Peprotech, #450-02), 5\u2009ng/mL NT-3, and 4\u2009\u03bcg/mL puromycin in water (Sigma, #P8833). Differentiated Chx10-Puro cells were plated on laminin coated T75 flasks at a density of 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n5\nin the selection media for 24\u2009h (\nFig. 1B\n).\n\nPreparation of aggregates for transplantation\nNPCs and V2a INs were lifted from laminin-coated flasks using Accutase (Sigma, #A6964) for 30\u2009min at room temperature; 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n5\ncells were seeded into each well of a 400-\u03bcm AggreWell plate (StemCell Technologies, #27845) for 2 days in NPC Media to form aggregates for transplantation (\nFIG. 1C-E\n). Mixed groups were seeded at a 1:1 ratio, to make a total of 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n5\ncells per well, and half the media were replaced daily. Aggregates were resuspended by trituration and allowed to settle in microcentrifuge tubes (\nFig. 1F\n). The media were aspirated, and the cells washed once with Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; ThermoFisher, #14025076) prior to transplantation or\nin vitro\ncharacterization.\n\nCharacterization of NPCs in vitro (2D culture)\nAt the time of NPC aggregation with V2a INs, a subset of NPCs (50,000 cells/cover-slip) were plated onto poly-L-lysine and laminin coated 25\u2009mm\n2\nglass cover-slips and allowed to attach for 10\u2009h prior to live-cell immunocytochemistry or fixation with paraformaldehyde (4%) for 10\u2009min and staining. Live cell immunocytochemistry was used to confirm the previously published characteristics of NPCs used for transplantation in this study. As previously described,\n48\nneuronal and glial restricted progenitor cells were labeled with surface markers E-NCAM and A2B5, respectively (\nFig. 2A-E\n). Briefly, after aspirating the culture media, cells were washed with 37\u00b0C HBSS prior to application of primary antibody (\nTable 1\n) diluted in 37\u00b0C NPC Medium (see above). Cells were incubated with primary antibody at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO\n2\nfor 30\u2009min before the media were aspirated and the cells were washed with 37\u00b0C HBSS three times. Secondary antibodies (\nTable 1\n) diluted in NPC Medium were applied to cells and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO\n2\nfor 30\u2009min prior to three washes with 37\u00b0C HBSS. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10\u2009min before three washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; ThermoFisher, #10010023) and a 10-min incubation with PBS containing 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (1:1000; DAPI; ThermoFisher, #D1306). Cover-slips were secured onto slides with fluorescence mounting medium (Dako Agilent, #S302380-2) and imaged using a Zeiss AxioImager microscope with a Zeiss Axiocam MRm camera, attached to a Dell PC.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nIn vitro\ncharacterization of neural progenitor cells (NPCs).

Fixed cells were washed with PBS prior to blocking with normal donkey serum (GeneTex, #GTX73205) and 0.01% Triton (EMD Millipore, #9036-19-5) for 1\u2009h. Cells were stained with primary antibody overnight (\nTable 1\n), washed three times with PBS, and stained with appropriate secondary antibody (able 1). Cells were then washed three times for 5\u2009min with PBS prior to a 10-min incubation with PBS containing DAPI as above. Cover-slips were secured onto slides with fluorescence mounting medium (Dako Agilent, #S302380-2) and imaged using a Zeiss AxioImager microscope with a Zeiss Axiocam MRm camera, attached to a Dell PC. Counting of Chx10-positive cells (\nFig. 2F\n) was performed in ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda, MD) with approximately 200 cells counted (as determined by DAPI staining) per replicate (\nn\n=\u20096).\n\nQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)\nThree different groups of cultured NPCs were analyzed and compared with fetal spinal cord tissue (FSC): NPCs that were thawed and plated onto poly-L-lysine and laminin coated T75 flask for 12\u2009h (equivalent to non-aggregated transplanted NPCs) or 2 days (2DIV, 2D), as well as NPC aggregates (2DIV, 3D culture; equivalent to transplanted NPC aggregates). All samples were lysed and RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, #74104). The complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using a high capacity RNA to cDNA kit (ThermoFisher, #4368814) and combined with TaqMan Gene Expression Assays and TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, #4444963). qRT-PCR was performed using a QuantStudio 3 (Applied Biosystems, CA) thermocycler with the following protocol: 95\u00b0C for 20\u2009sec; 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 1\u2009sec, and 60\u00b0C for 20\u2009sec. Expression of transcription factor messenger RNA (mRNA) of Evx1, En1, Chx10, Lhx3, and Hb9 was assessed in each NPC sample described above and compared with level of expression in embryonic (E13.5) spinal cord tissue (FSC) and graphically represented as a percent relative to expression in FSC, with FSC levels set as 100%.

Fluorescent images of aggregates were obtained by placing the aggregates between glass cover-slips and imaging using a MICROfire camera attached to an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope (\nFig. 1F\n). To determine cell viability, aggregates were prepared using an ESC line that does not contain a fluorescent reporter, whereas GFP expression in rat NPCs was sufficiently low enough to achieve threshold for analysis. Aggregates were incubated in Accutase for 3\u2009h at room temperature with agitation, then triturated to dissociate. Single cells were then incubated for 30\u2009min in PBS containing calcein-AM and ethidium homodimer-1 (Life Technologies, #C481) to stain alive and dead/dying cells prior to imaging. Counting was performed in ImageJ, with approximately 300 cells counted per replicate (\nn\n=\u20093). Fluorescent aggregates were similarly dissociated and quantified to determine the population distribution within mixed groups.\n\nSurgical methods\nAll animals were anesthetized by injection of xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg, s.q.) and ketamine (120\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) for spinal cord injury, transplantation and electrophysiology procedures. Spinal cord injured and vehicle treated animals also underwent neuroanatomical tracing under isoflurane anesthesia (4% in 100% O\n2\nto induce, 2% in 100% O\n2\nto maintain). Upon completion of each procedure, xylazine-induced anesthesia was reversed via injection of yohimbine (1.2\u2009mg/kg s.q.). Post-operative medicine included lactated Ringer's (5\u2009mL, s.q.) to prevent dehydration and buprenorphine (0.025\u2009mg/kg s.q.) was used as an analgesic.\n\nSCI\nFor SCI, animals were prepared for surgery as previously described.\n12\nBriefly, a skin incision was made with a No. 15 scalpel blade from the base of the skull to the fifth cervical segment (C5), surrounding musculature was carefully cut and pushed apart and a laminectomy was made at the third cervical segment (C3) and rostral part of C4. Animals were secured with vertebral clamps at the C2 process and C4 process, slightly elevating the animal from the surgical frame. All animals received a lateralized contusion injury just caudal to C3 dorsal root on the left side of the spinal cord using a 2\u2009mm tip attached to the Infinite Horizon Pneumatic Impactor (Precision Systems, Lexington, KY), with the height of the tip preset to 5\u2009mm and impact force preset to 200 kilodynes and zero dwell time. All animals that experienced respiratory arrest were intubated using a 16-gauge catheter (Braun Medical Inc., #4251695-02) attached to a fiber optic light and mechanically ventilated (Small Animal Ventilator; Harvard Apparatus) for 1\u2009h. The underlying muscle was sutured in layers and the skin was closed with wound clips just prior to administration of post-operative medicine.\n\nTransplantation\nAll animals were immunosuppressed with cyclosporin A (10\u2009mg/kg daily s.q.), starting three days prior to transplantation and throughout the duration of the study (\nFig. 1G\n). Animals were blindly separated into one of three groups (vehicle, NPCs, or NPC/V2a INs) and decoded after all functional data analysis. Animals were anesthetized as described above and the skin and underlying musculature were re-exposed 1 week post-injury. Using a 33-gauge needle tip, a small hole was made in the dura overlying the epicenter of the injury (visualized by the bruise in the spinal tissue). Non-aggregated (single-cell suspension) NPCs (5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n5\ncells per animal;\nn\n=\u20098), NPC aggregates (5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n5\ncells per animal;\nn\n=\u20096) or NPC/V2a IN aggregates (5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n5\ncells per animal prepared in a 1:1 ratio as described above;\nn\n=\u20098) were injected into the contusion cavity via a gas tight 25\u2009uL Hamilton syringe with a custom 30-gauge needle attached to a micromanipulator (Model Kite-L; World Precision Instruments). Age-matched controls (\nn\n=\u20098) received all the described surgical procedures, but instead of a cellular injection, received an equal volume (6\u2009uL) of HBSS into the lesion cavity. The underlying muscle was sutured in layers and the skin was closed with wound clips prior to administration of post-operative medicine. Animals recovered for 1 month prior to terminal electrophysiology recordings. A separate group of injured animals received single-cell suspension AP NPCs (5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n5\ncells per animal;\nn\n=\u20095) and sacrificed at 3 days (\nn\n=\u20092), 1 week (\nn\n=\u20092), and 2 weeks (\nn\n=\u20091) post-transplant.\n\nNeuroanatomical tracing\nA transynaptic retrograde tracing technique (pseudorabies virus [PRV]) was used to label the phrenic motor circuit and confirm the location and severity of the injury, 1 month after injury as previously described.\n58\nBriefly, after reaching a surgical plane of isoflurane-induced anesthesia, a laparotomy was performed to expose the diaphragm and a Bartha strain of PRV (50\u2009uL total volume) was topically applied onto the hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to injury. The PRV recombinant used in this study was PRV 614 (8.0\u20139.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n8\npfu/mL) expressing red fluorescent protein. PRV614 was supplied to us by Dr. David Bloom, University of Florida.\n\nDiaphragm electromyography\nTerminal, bilateral dEMG recordings were performed on every animal as described elsewhere\n12\njust prior to being euthanized and perfusion-fixed for histological analyses. Briefly, animals were anesthetized with a mixture of xylazine and ketamine and a laparotomy was performed to expose the abdominal surface of the diaphragm. Bipolar hook electrodes (PFA coated tungsten wire with exposed tips; A-M Systems, #796500) were then placed into the medial costal region of the left and right hemidiaphragm as previously described.\n12\nPulse oximetry was used to assess change in blood oxygen saturation using a collar cuff (Part #: 015023) and MouseOx (Starr Life Sciences Corp.). Diaphragm activity was recorded during spontaneous breathing and baseline was counted as a minimum of 10\u2009min of stable activity with an oxygen saturation of 90\u201398%. Once baseline was acquired, a nose cone was placed over the animals' nose, which allowed the administration of hypercapnic (7% CO\n2\n, balanced in N\n2\n; flow rate 2\u2009L/min) or hypoxic gas (10% O\n2\n, balanced in N\n2\n; flow rate 2\u2009L/min), as means of a 5-min respiratory challenge. The purpose of the 5-min respiratory challenges is to test the ability of the animals (injured and injured with transplant) to increase muscle output and subsequent ventilation upon increased demand. This method of increasing the respiratory drive can reveal functional deficits that are not evident during a period of quiet, eupneic breathing (e.g. baseline).\n59\nThe dEMG signals were amplified (1000\u2009\u00d7\u2009) and band pass filtered (0.3\u20135\u2009KHz) using differential A/C amplifier (Model 1700; A-M Systems) and digitized (Power 1401; Cambridge Electronic Design).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAt the end of terminal recordings, all animals were intracardially perfused with physiological saline (0.9% NaCl in water) and paraformaldehyde (4% w/v in 0.1\u2009M PBS; pH 7.4). The spinal cords were then removed and stored in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. Spinal cord tissue spanning caudal-most part of brainstem to beginning of thoracic spinal cord (T1-2) was cryoprotected (15%, then 30% sucrose, overnight), and sectioned (on-slide 20\u2009\u03bcm or 30\u2009\u03bcm, transverse or longitudinal, respectively) using a cryostat.\nSections were rehydrated for 15\u2009min in PBS, blocked against endogenous peroxidase activity (30% methanol, 0.6% hydrogen peroxide in 0.1\u2009M PBS, incubated for 1\u2009h), and blocked against non-specific protein labeling (10% serum in 0.1\u2009M PBS with 0.02% Triton-X, incubated for 1\u2009h), prior to application of primary antibodies in blocking solution. Primary antibodies (\nTable 1\n) were left on the tissue overnight at room temperature. Antibodies to PRV were supplied by Dr. Lyn Enquist (Princeton University, NJ). The following day, tissue was washed in PBS (0.1\u2009M, 3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min) and incubated in blocking solution with secondary antibodies (\nTable 1\n). Immunolabeled sections were then washed in PBS (0.1\u2009M, 3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min), allowed to dry, and cover-slipped with fluorescence mounting medium (Dako). Sections were examined using a Zeiss AxioImager microscope with Apotome 2 attached to a Dell PC. Photographs were taken with a digital camera (Zeiss Axiocam MRm) or with a Leica TCS SP8 with DMi8 inverted optical stand (63\u03b2 objective lens).\n\nAnatomical and functional data analysis\nDiaphragm electromyography traces were integrated (DC bias removed at 0.1\u2009sec), rectified and smoothed (0.03\u2009sec) using Spike 2 software (version 8; Cambridge Electronic Design, UK). Baseline diaphragm output was determined during eupneic breathing by averaging integrated signal over a 40-sec interval immediately before a respiratory challenge. Diaphragm output during a respiratory challenge was determined by averaging integrated signal over a 40-sec interval at the end of each 5-min challenges. The average maximum voltage and percent change of each challenge from baseline breathing was determined from the averaged, integrated signal for each respiratory state using OriginPro9 software (Northampton, MA). Results are reported as average\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error, or as percent change relative to baseline (eupnea) where indicated. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics 23). Comparison between vehicle and transplant recipients was made using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student\nt\n-test (IBM SPSS Statistics 23). All analyses of electrophysiological data were blinded.\nTransplant survival was determined as the volume of GFP-positive labeling within the volume of lesioned tissue between serial sections 90\u2009\u03bcm apart. To estimate the volume of the transplant and lesioned tissue between two serial sections, the area of the transplant or lesion was multiplied by the distance between each section. Half of the difference between the two volumes was then added to the volume measured for the section with the smaller measured area, giving an estimate of the volume between two sections. The area of the transplant was defined as area occupied by green labeled cells with a threshold set based on presence of positive GFP signal while excluding background noise using ImageJ. Lesioned area for each section was manually determined in ImageJ by the presence of clearly identifiable macrophages, tissue debris, presence of empty cavity space, or a clearly defined transplant\u2013host integration zone. The integration zone is defined as the intermingling of host and donor cells. Results are reported as average percent of transplant volume per volume of lesioned tissue\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error.\nThe number of TdTomato positive V2a INs (TdTomato only), NeuN positive V2a INs (NeuN/TdTomato double labeled), and NeuN positive NPC INs (GFP/NeuN double labeled) were manually counted in 12 sections, 90\u2009\u03bcm apart to avoid double counting cells, per animal (\nn\n=\u20095). To estimate the total number of cells within a transplant, the number of cells counted in a section was multiplied by the thickness between sections used for cell counts. Feret diameter maximum (the longest diameter measured for each circled cell) for the three types of interneurons (V2a INs, V2a INs that are positive for NeuN, and NPCs positive for NeuN) and migrating glial cells were determined with Zen Blue software. Results are reported as average Feret diameter (\u03bcm)\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics 23). Comparison between vehicle and transplant recipients was made using ANOVA and Student's\nt\n-test."

    "Methods": "Subjects and instrumentation\nVolunteer subjects were instrumented with mouthguards measuring 6DOF (translation and rotation) accelerations (\nFig. 1A\n). We recruited male subjects between the ages of 18 and 40 that had no previous history of brain, neck, or spinal cord injury. To investigate whether past participation in a ball sport (where rapid head motion is common from following a target) affected head motion performance, we classified subjects as\nathletes\nif they had played a ball sport at the high school or college varsity level (including, but not limited to, baseball, basketball, football, golf, hockey, lacrosse, soccer, squash, tennis, volleyball, and water polo). All other subjects were considered\nnonathletes\nfor the purposes of this study.\nEach subject received a custom-fit instrumented mouthguard.\n13\n,\n17\n,\n32\n,\n33\nWe made impressions of each subject's upper dentition, and embedded electronics in material that was pressure formed around the subject's dental mold (\nFig. 1A\n). The custom fit provided tight coupling to the subject's skull through the maxillary dentition. Mouthguard electronics included a tri-axis accelerometer (measuring translational acceleration in the anterior-posterior, left-right, and superior-inferior directions), a tri-axis gyroscope (measuring rotational velocity in the coronal, sagittal, and horizontal planes), a microprocessor, 16-bit flash memory, and a battery. Activity that exceeded a programmed gyroscope threshold was recorded and downloaded at the conclusion of each experiment. Here, we used a rotational velocity magnitude trigger of 5\u2009rad s\n\u22121\n, modified from the 7\ng\ntranslational acceleration magnitude threshold we used in previous sports impact studies,\n13\n,\n17\n,\n32\n,\n33\nwhich we expected would be too high for these voluntary head motions. The embedded microprocessor recorded time-stamped sensor measurements at 500\u2009Hz for 50\u2009ms preceding the triggering velocity and 350\u2009ms post-trigger (for a total record time of 400\u2009ms). During all experiments, members of the research team noted the time of each head motion to later remove spurious false-positive mouthguard measurements that exceeded the rotational velocity threshold, but did not correspond to head motions. The kinematic accuracy of these devices was previously characterized in dummy head,\n13\n,\n32\nin vivo\n,\n17\nand\nex vivo\nexperiments.\n33\n\nKinematic measurements and processing\nAccelerometer and gyroscope data were filtered using a second-order Butterworth low-pass filter with 200- and 110-Hz cut-off frequencies, respectively.\n13\n,\n32\nSensor measurements were then transformed to express the translational acceleration of the head center of gravity and the rotational velocity and acceleration of a head anatomical reference frame (pointing in the anterior, left, and superior directions) using a previously published algorithm and assuming a 50th percentile male head size.\n32\nRotational acceleration was computed using a fourth-order central difference derivative of each rotational velocity component. Because the head motion experiments were mostly planar, we took a numerical integration of the primary rotational velocity to compute a change in orientation in the primary plane of motion.\nIn addition to peak kinematics values, we calculated the BrIC for each head motion. BrIC was developed by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\n31\nfor inclusion in future vehicle safety standards and is a function of head rotational velocity (\nEq. 1\n):\nwhere\n\u03c9\ncoronal\n,\n\u03c9\nsagittal\n, and\n\u03c9\nhorizontal\nare the peak values for rotational velocity in each anatomical direction over time, and\n\u03c9\ncr,coronal\n,\n\u03c9\ncr,sagittal\n, and\n\u03c9\ncr,horizontal\nare the corresponding critical values determined from experimental data of pendulum dummy impacts. Though originally developed to assess severe brain injuries, BrIC has also been adapted to predict risk of mTBIs with critical angular velocity values of: 66.2, 59.1, and 44.2\u2009rad s\n\u22121\n, respectively.\nTo assess the performance of BrIC and other kinematic measurements as predictors of concussion risk, we constructed precision-recall curves. Precision, or positive predictive value, is the fraction of impacts predicted to be concussions that were actually concussions. Recall, or sensitivity, is the fraction of concussions that were correctly classified as concussions. Precision and recall can be summarized with the following equations (\nEqs. 2\nand\n3\n):\nThe area under the precision-recall curve (\nAUC\nPR\n), which ranges from 0 to 1, quantifies the degree to which both are achieved. A perfect classifier would have\nAUC\nPR\nequal to 1. A random classifier would have\nAUC\nPR\nequal to the fraction of concussions in the total data set. Precision-recall curves are better suited than receiver operating curves for use in assessing injury safety where the baseline probabilities of positive (injury) and negative (noninjury) classification are different (e.g., injuries are far rarer).\n\nHead motion experiments\nFor all subjects, we measured a total of 27 rapid head movements using two experiments: 1) 18 isolated head motions and 2) nine tracking head motions. At the beginning of the experiments, we guided subjects through a series of neck stretches and rolls to warm them up. Subjects were then given their mouthguards and instructed to maintain a slack jaw throughout the entire duration of the study, given that this has been found to minimize mouthguard measurement errors.\n33\nWe then conducted the isolated head motion experiments, where each subject was instructed to rotate their head as fast as possible in each of three rotation planes: coronal, sagittal, and horizontal (\nFig. 1B\n). Starting with coronal plane rotation, subjects rotated their head from their leftmost extreme position (left ear on left shoulder) to the rightmost extreme position (right ear on right shoulder) three times. They then performed another triplicate in the reverse direction, right to left. The process repeated in the sagittal plane (looking up to down, and then down to up) and in the horizontal plane (looking right to left, and then left to right). Triplicates were performed to provide subjects an additional opportunity to warm up, get accustomed to the motion, and reach their peak performance/velocity. In addition, subjects were instructed to use only their head and neck, and minimize any movement or rotation of their arms and torso.\nFor the tracking head motions, each subject was instructed to follow a fast-moving (approximately 10\u2009m s\n\u22121\n) soccer ball (\nFig. 1C\n). The first three head movements came from tracking a soccer ball flying approximately 3 feet directly overhead in a seated position with legs stretched forward and hands placed in front of them. The other six head movements came from tracking the soccer ball flying to the left and right in a standing position. In all cases and across all subjects, a soccer ball launcher (Sports Tutor, Burbank, CA) was used at the same setting to ensure consistency in the velocity and trajectory of launches across experiments. Markings on the ground were also used to keep subject placement consistent. Subjects were instructed to begin looking at the ball launcher and then follow the soccer ball with their eyes, only allowing their head and neck to rotate (and again minimize motion or the arms and torso). Subjects were also reminded to keep their jaw slack. All head motions, in both experiments, were videotaped just in case qualitative follow-up of the measurements were needed.\nHead accelerations from these experiments were then compared with previously recorded padded sports impact data sets. The first set was collected at Stanford using similar instrumented mouthguards and consisted of 513 football, boxing, and mixed martial arts impacts, including two resulting in diagnosed concussion.\n13\nThe second set came from laboratory dummy reconstructions of NFL impact videos and consisted of 58 impacts, including 25 that resulted in diagnosed concussion.\n14\nFinally, analysis of pendulum dummy tests that were used in the development of BrIC\n31\nwere included in this study for comparison.\n\nBrain response modeling\nTo quantify potential brain tissue damage during these head motions, we simulated head motions using a combination of rigid body and finite element brain models that are commonly utilized in brain injury assessments and criteria. We performed rigid body simulations to predict brain response to varying inputs of velocity and acceleration. Using a previously published method of determining velocity and acceleration-dependent regimes,\n23\nwe quantified brain displacement in a simple second-order system model. The model, briefly, consisted of a rigid brain mass with a single-degree-of-freedom pivot with respect to a rigid skull, located near the base of the brain. A torsional spring and damper were also included at the brain-skull pivot to provide the characteristic second-order dynamics, similar to an inverted pendulum with a spring damper.\n34\n,\n35\nWe simulated a triangular acceleration pulse where the peak was set to a given acceleration, and the duration was set to produce a given velocity (area under the curve). We swept a rectangular grid of velocities and accelerations to find contour lines of constant peak response, taken as peak displacement of the mass from neutral. An additional injury threshold line, calculated and scaled from primate experiments,\n20\nwas included for comparison.\nWe also simulated head movement measurements using a finite element (FE) model to estimate brain stress and strains. We used the FE head model developed at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden,\n36\nwhich is sized to match an average adult male human head. Developed in LS-DYNA (LSTC, Livermore, CA), this model incorporates the brain, skull, meninges, scalp, cerebral spinal fluid, and eleven pairs of bridging veins. Brain tissue is modeled using an Ogden hyperelastic constitutive law (to account for large deformations of the tissue) with additional linear viscoelastic terms (to account for the rate dependence of the tissue). The model also accounted for material property differences between white and gray matter. The FE model was previously validated against intracranial pressure and displacement data from cadaver head impact experiments performed.\n37\nFrom the models, we analyzed the deformation of brain tissue in the primary direction of fiber tracts using a previously published technique using average diffuse tensor imaging of 81 healthy subjects.\n38\nTract-direction strain was computed by projecting the Green\u2013Lagrange strain tensor in the direction of preferred diffusion (which aligns with the primary direction of fiber tracts in a given direction). Principal strain was computed by taking the largest eigenvalue of the Green\u2013Lagrange strain tensor. Strain rate in each brain element was determined using a fourth-order central difference derivative of strain over time.\nWe ran our data through similar analyses used to develop BrIC.\n31\nSpecifically, we correlated max principal strain (MPS) with peak values of rotational velocity, peak values of rotational acceleration, and BrIC. In all cases, we performed linear regression that was constrained to go through the origin. We also used the same formulation of\nr\n2\ncoefficient of determination used by Takhounts and colleagues, for MPS data and regression through the origin.\n31\n\nNeurological testing\nTo quantify deficits from performing these head motions, three different neurological tests were performed at four different time periods throughout the study: 1) baseline testing conducted 2\u20134 days preceding the head movement experiments at the time of obtaining written consent to participate in the study; 2) pre-experiment testing immediately preceding the experiments; 3) post-experiment testing immediately after the experiments; and 4) post-experiment testing approximately 20\u2009min after the experiments. Tests were selected to span a variety of cognitive and neurological function, and the 20-min gap was selected based to allow for vestibular effects on balance to subside.\n39\nFor all scores, we calculated differences from the subject's baseline.\nThe first test was the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), which has been used previously to assess static postural stability.\n39\u201345\nAs part of this test, subjects were instructed to close their eyes and hold three different stances (double leg, single leg, and tandem) and two different surfaces (firm floor and a foam pad). In the double leg stance, subjects stand straight, feet together (side by side), with hands on their hip. In the single-leg stance, subjects stand on their nondominant leg while the other leg is raised to maintain a knee flexion angle of approximately 90 degrees. In the tandem leg stance, subjects put one foot in front of the other, their dominant foot in front. To determine their dominant foot, subjects were asked to identify which foot they were more likely to kick a soccer ball. The BESS score for each test was the number of errors committed by the subject in a 20-sec period. Errors were defined as opening of the eyes, removing their hands from their hips, steps, stumbles, falls, and other failures to hold the specified stance. As such, a larger BESS score is thought to correspond with higher probability of brain injury. Live scoring was performed by the research team during the experiments and in video.\nThe second test was the King\u2013Devick (KD) assessment.\n46\nThis exam has been used to test oculomotor function, language function, and visual acuity by requiring subjects to read numbers on a tablet screen, as fast as possible, without committing any errors.\n46\u201348\nThe numbers are to be read left to right, top to bottom, for three exams of increasing difficulty (rows get closer and guidelines are removed). As such, larger KD scores (time it takes to read the number) correspond with higher probability of brain injury.\nThe final test was the Standard Assessment of Concussion (SAC), which has been used to assess a wide variety of concussion symptoms.\n40\n,\n49\n,\n50\nThe exam consists of four scored sections: 1) orientation, where subjects have to recite the current day, time, year, etc.; 2) memory, where subjects have to repeat back five words; 3) concentration, where subjects have to recite digits back in reverse order; and 4) delayed recall, where subjects have to remember the five words told to them in the memory section. Because points are provided for correct responses, lower SAC scores correspond with higher probability of brain injury."

    "Methods": "Patients\nPatients were prospectively enrolled in a cohort study at an academic level 1 trauma center, during the period between February 2010 and November 2014, after approval from the local institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from each patient's legal representative. Eligibility for enrollment included patients 18 years of age or older with TBI, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <12 (or higher GCS on admission, but >2-point fall in the first 8\u2009h with an abnormal head computed tomography scan), and admission to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit. Patients on anticoagulation or -thrombotic therapy at time of TBI were excluded from the study. Patients presenting with severe coagulopathy were excluded from the study (all patients had an international normalized ratio [INR] <1.4 upon enrolment). No patient received plasma, platelets, or other hemostatic agents preceding enrollment. Controls were healthy subjects not taking antithrombotic medications; all controls consented for the study.\nPatient demographic information, including age, sex, and race, was obtained, as was admission GCS. Comorbidity data, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, previous venous thromboembolism, and history of liver and renal failure, were collected. Tobacco use, ethanol use, and positive blood alcohol test on admission were also recorded. Mechanism of injury was noted, as were patterns of bleeding: epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, and contusion. Other admission other variables obtained include vital signs (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and triage temperature), laboratory results (PT [prothrombin time], INR, aPTT [activated partial thromboplastin time], pH, and base deficit), and volume of resuscitation fluids.\n\nPlasma levels of von Willebrand factor antigen\nPlasma VWF antigen (VWFAg) was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as described previously.\n15\nBriefly, a Maxisorp plate (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) was coated with a polyclonal rabbit antihuman VWF antibody at 1:2000 dilution (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Plasma samples at various dilutions and standards were incubated at room temperature for 2\u2009h after blocking with 1% casein in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After being washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated polyclonal rabbit antihuman VWF (Dako) immunoglobulin G (IgG) at 1:3000 was applied as the detection antibody. After the additional wash steps, a tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution (Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA) was added for color reaction. Absorbance at 450\u2009nm was determined with a ThermoMax190 microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Normal pooled human plasma (NHP; George King Bio-Medical, Overland Park, KS) was used as the standard, defined as having 100% of VWFAg.\n\nPlasma levels of von Willebrand factor activity\nPlasma VWF activity (VWFAc) was determined by its ability to bind type III collagen.\n15\nA microtiter plate was coated with 100\u2009\u03bcL of type III collagen (6\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL) in 20\u2009mM of acetic acid. After blocking with 1% casein in PBS, diluted patient plasma or a standard was added to the wells and incubated at room temperature for 2\u2009h. Bound VWF was detected by addition of a HRP-conjugated antihuman VWF IgG (1:3,000), followed by TMB. NHP was defined to have 100% of VWFAc.\n\nPlasma a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 repeats 13 activity\nPlasma ADAMTS13 activity was determined by its ability to cleave a FRETS-VWF73 peptide. A recombinant human VWF fragment (rVWF73) from the central A2 domain of VWF was expressed and fluorescein-labeled, and purified to homogeneity using the protocol described previously.\n16\nThe final concentration of FRET-rVWF73 was determined by a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at the absorbance of 280\u2009nm with a correction at 495\u2009nm. Purified FRETS-rVWF73 (1\u2009\u03bcmol/L) was incubated with either 2.5\u2009\u03bcL of NHP or patient plasma in 5\u2009mmol/L Bis-Tris, pH 6.0, 25\u2009mmol/L CaCl\n2\n, and 0.005% Tween-20 at 25\u00b0C. Rate of fluorescence generation was monitored every 2\u2009min for 60\u2009min on a GeminiXPS microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices). Relative activity (%) was determined based on the standard curve generated with NHP. ADAMTS13 activity in the pooled NHP was defined as having 100% of proteolytic activity.\n\nPlasma levels of human neutrophil peptides 1\u20133\nPlasma concentrations of HNP1-3 were determined by a commercially available ELISA method (Hycult Biothech, Plymouth, PA), following the manufacturer's recommendation.\n17\nDetection ranges from 156 to 10,000\u2009pg/mL.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe Kruskal\u2013Wallis test was used to determine differences in median values of plasma levels of VWFAg, VWFAc, ADAMTS13 activity, and HNP1-3 among various time points in TBI patients compared to those in healthy controls. Because of low sample size, for outcome association purposes, the statistical analysis is not inference based, but rather exploratory in nature. Data were explored using cluster analysis for repeated measures of on days 2, 3, and 5 for all biomarkers. Generated clusters were used to summarize both quantitative and categorical variables. The first step in cluster analysis involved finding the optimal number of clusters. The \u201celbow method\u201d using a plot of within-cluster error measure indicated two clusters. Consequently, a k-means clustering algorithm was used to perform the cluster analysis. The two-cluster solution for all the variables was performed. Cluster analysis was performed using R statistical software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The Everitt and Hothorn (2009) R function was used to plot the cluster elbows.\n18\nThe cluster analysis requires complete data (no missing data); therefore, only 11 observations were available for use in this analysis."

    "Methods": "Animals\nA total of 52 female Thy1-Channelrhodopsin 2-YFP (ChR-2) transgenic mice (line 18, stock 007612, strain B6.Cg-Tg(Thy1-COP4/EYFP)18Gfng/J; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), 8\u201310 weeks of age and weighing 20\u201322\u2009g, were used in this study. All animals were maintained in a 12/12-h light/dark cycle with food and water freely available. Surgical interventions, treatments, and post-operative animal care were performed in accord with Guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Indiana University School of Medicine (Indianapolis, IN).\nTo determine whether optogenetic motor mapping could be used as a physiological measurement of functional deficits after SCI, we assigned 8 mice to each of a sham group and three SCI groups that received mild, moderate, and severe SCI respectively. All these animals received behavioral tests, optogenetic motor mapping, and retrograde tracing with Fluoro-Gold (FG). To determine motor pathway plasticity after SCI, 10 mice were divided into a sham group and a moderate SCI group. For each animal, anterograde tracing with biotin dextran amine (BDA) and retrograde tracing with FG were performed. To further determine plasticity of corticorubral projection after SCI, 10 mice were assigned to a sham group and a moderate SCI group for optogenetic stimulation of the motor cortex followed by c-Fos staining and synapse immunostaining.\n\nContusive spinal cord injury surgery\nThe SCI procedure was performed as described by Liu and colleagues.\n26\nUnder anesthesia with ketamine-xylazine (87.7\u2009mg/kg of ketamine, 12.3\u2009mg/kg of xylazine), contusive SCI models were created at the T10 level using an Infinite Horizon Impactor (Infinite Horizons [IH], Lexington, KY). Three different impact forces (30, 60, and 90 kDyn) were used to create mild, moderate, and severe injuries, respectively. Mice in the sham groups underwent laminectomy, but without receiving an impact. After the laminectomy and SCI, the muscle and skin were closed in layers, and all animals were placed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled chamber overnight. Manual bladder expression was carried out twice-daily until reflex bladder emptying was established.\n\nBehavioral assessments\nBasso Mouse Scale (BMS) locomotor test, rota-rod, and grid walk test were performed. Every animal was trained for 1 week before surgery and all behavior tests were performed by experienced observers who were blind to the experimental groups. The BMS locomotor tests were performed at baseline and weekly up to 6 weeks after SCI according to a method published previously.\n27\nBriefly, the animal was placed in an open field (42 inches in diameter) and observed for 4\u2009min by two observers. The score was on a scale of 0\u20139, which was based on hindlimb movements made in an open field including hindlimb joint movement, weight support, plantar stepping, coordination, paw position, and trunk and tail location.\n26\nThe rota-rod test was performed as published previously\n28\nat baseline and 2, 4, and 6 weeks after injury. Retention time of an animal staying on a rotating rod was measured at a rotation speed of 18\u2009rpm using a five-lane rota-rod device (IITC Life Science, Inc., Woodland Hills, CA). The device was accelerated from 1 to 18\u2009rpm over 90\u2009sec, with each trial lasting a maximum of 120\u2009sec. Trials ended when the animal either fell off the rod or clung to the rod as it made one complete rotation. Three trials were performed for each mouse at each test, and an average retention time was taken from the three trials.\nThe grid walk was also used to evaluate hindlimb locomotor deficits\n29\nand was performed at baseline and 2, 4, and 6 weeks after injury. Animals walked on a plastic mesh (1.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5 square foot) containing 1.2\u2009\u00d7\u20091.2\u2009cm diamond holes. During the test, total hindlimb footfalls of each animal were counted by two observers blind to the experimental groups. The number of footfalls (fall of the hindlimb, including at least the ankle joint, through the grid surface) was determined individually for each hindlimb.\n30\n\nIn vivo\noptogenetic motor mapping\nIn vivo\ntranscranial optogenetic motor mappings were made at baseline, 1 day, and 2, 4, and 6 weeks after SCI. Before baseline mapping, the skin above the bilateral motor cortex was removed, the skull was exposed and covered with a thin layer of cyanoacrylate glue, and the bregma was marked for reference (\nFig. 1\n). For optogenetic mapping, each animal was anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine (80\u2009mg/kg of ketamine, 4\u2009mg/kg of xylazine, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) and placed on a platform. When a mouse responded to a tail pinch with a slight tail move, depth of anesthesia was regarded as appropriate for mapping.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nA laser scanning photostimulation setup for optogenetic mapping of motor cortex in Thy1-ChR2 transgenic mice. (\nA\n) A mouse was anesthetized and the left motor cortex was photostimulated by a blue laser (470\u2009nm) through a 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009microscope objective, and the evoked motor response was detected by an electrode inserted in the gastrocnemius muscle of the right hindlimb. (\nB\n) Six stimulation regions were set in the left motor cortex, with two regions anterior and four regions posterior to bregma. There were 30 stimulation spots in each region and totally 180 stimulation spots on the left cortex. The white dot in (B) indicates the location of bregma, and the black dashed area indicates the area of optogenetic mapping. EMG, electromyogram.\nWe made motor cortical mapping by using a blue laser to stimulate the left motor cortex and recording an evoked electromyogram (EMG) of the contralateral hindlimb in each animal. Six stimulation regions were set in the left cortex, with two regions anterior to bregma and four regions posterior to bregma. There were 5\u2009\u00d7\u20096 stimulation spots in each stimulation region and a total of 180 stimulation spots on the left cortex, which completely covered the hindlimb area of the left motor cortex. We used a laser scanning photostimulation system for optogenetic mapping.\n31\n,\n32\nA blue laser (470\u2009nm) went through an optic fiber and a lens assembly that focused the light onto a dichroic mirror, which reflected the light beam to the back aperture of a 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009objective (Fluar 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) of an upright Olympus microscope and projected to the left cortex (\nFig. 1A\n). In each mapping region, the blue laser scanned three times repeatedly. Upon finishing mapping one region, the next region was mapped by moving the microscopic field. A complete map was obtained by averaging the results from three maps at each region and combining the maps of the six regions together. Intensity of the blue laser was 17\u2009mW at the maximum and could be attenuated through a neutral density filter. A pulse duration of 5\u2009ms was used for motor mapping. EMG responses induced by optogenetic stimulation were recorded from gastrocnemius muscle of the contralateral hindlimb using two stainless steel needles. Responses were amplified, digitized, and recorded in a computer.\nEvents that occurred within 50\u2009ms after laser flashes were detected using an event-detecting software. At each mapping spot, peak amplitudes of the event from three repetitions were averaged for comparison and map construction. In each motor map, different color spots represented different EMG amplitudes, with red spots having the higher amplitude and blue spots having the lower amplitudes (\nFig. 2A\n). Total number of spots with positive EMG was counted to reflect the size of a cortical motor map. Average EMG amplitudes with respect to anterior-to-posterior or medial-to-lateral direction were calculated by dividing total EMG amplitudes along each column by total number of stimulating spots. Motor maps were constructed with OriginPro software (version 9.1; OriginLab, Northampton, MA).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nLongitudinal optogenetic mapping revealed initial loss and subsequent recovery of cortical motor map after different severities of spinal cord contusion. (\nA\n) Representative motor maps at baseline, 1 day, and 2, 4, and 6 weeks after sham (Shm) and mild (Mld), moderate (Mod), and severe (Sev) SCI, respectively. Distances between neighboring spots were 300\u2009\u03bcm. The scale bar at the bottom represents different amplitudes of evoked EMG normalized to maximal response. Shown on the right column are representative EMG traces at 6 weeks after SCI, which correspond to the black circles of the W6 maps of the same row.

A glass pipette attached to a Hamilton syringe was inserted into the spinal cord (0.3\u2009mm from the midline, 0.5\u2009mm from the dorsal surface of the spinal cord, and 10\u2009mm caudal to the injury site) to inject 2% FG (Fluorochrome, Inc, Denver, CO). Every animal received two stereotaxic injections of 0.5\u2009\u03bcL of FG each. The glass pipette was left in place for 5\u2009min before moving to the next injection site. Mice were perfused for histological processing 1 week after FG injection. For simultaneous antero- and retrograde tracing, all animals received an FG injection, as described above, 1 week after BDA injection.\nAt 4 weeks post-SCI, 10 mice received a stereotaxic injection of BDA (10%; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for tracing axons of the primary motor cortex. The protocol of BDA injection was described previously.\n34\nA 3\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009mm cranial window was made above the left motor cortex with a micro-drill to expose the dura mater. Five injections of 3\u2009\u03bcL each were made at a rate of 0.15\u2009\u03bcL/min and 0.6\u2009mm deep into the cortex. Injection coordinates were as follows: 1.5\u2009mm lateral and 2.0, 1.25, and 0.5\u2009mm anterior to bregma; 1.0\u2009mm lateral and 0.25 and 1.0\u2009mm caudal to bregma. The BDA injection was made using the same system as the FG injection. The glass pipette was left in place for 5\u2009min before moving to the next injection site.\n\nOptogenetic stimulation of the motor cortex\nTo determine whether stimulating motor cortex would cause enhanced activation of cortical or subcortical neurons after SCI, 5 mice each were assigned to a sham group and a moderate SCI group. At 6 weeks post-surgery, a blue light-emitting diode (LED; 470\u2009nm) was implanted on the left skull (1.5\u2009mm lateral and 1.2\u2009mm anterior to bregma) to stimulate the motor cortex. The LED was controlled by a miniature circuit that generated a burst of three pulses at 33\u2009Hz once every 3\u2009sec. After receiving 30\u2009min of the optogenetic stimulation, mice were perfused and processed for immunostaining with c-Fos.\n\nTissue histology and immunofluorescence staining\nAnimals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (150\u2009mg/mL) and transcardially perfused with 0.01\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.01\u2009M of PBS. Brain and spinal cord were dissected, post-fixed with 4% PFA overnight at 4 \u00b0C, and then transferred to 30% sucrose for 3\u20137 days. The brain was frozen within optimal cutting temperature in compound embedding matrix (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL). Brain tissue containing cortex and red nucleus was sectioned coronally at 30-\u03bcm thickness on a cryostat set. Coronal sections were examined to evaluate neurons labeled by FG in the motor cortex and red nucleus. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to assess activated neurons labeled by c-Fos in the cortex and red nucleus, and BDA-labeled axons and FG-labeled neurons in the red nucleus.\nFor c-Fos fluorescence staining, brain sections were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (0.1\u2009M, pH 7.4), immunoblocked with 20% normal goat serum in PBS at room temperature for 1\u2009h, and then incubated with a primary antibody against c-Fos (rabbit, 1:800; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were then incubated with a goat antirabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 2\u2009h at room temperature. For nuclear staining, 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1:10,000) was added to the final wash for 5\u2009min. To visualize BDA-labeled axons, brain sections were incubated sequentially with ABC reagent (1:250, 30\u2009min; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), biotinyl tyramide (1:75, 10\u2009min; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Waltham, MAQ), and extra-avidin fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:500, 2\u2009h; Sigma-Aldrich). After BDA staining, the same sections were incubated with a primary antibody against synaptophysin (rabbit, 1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at 4\u00b0C overnight and then incubated with a goat antirabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Invitrogen) for 2\u2009h at room temperature.\nFor histological assessments of SCI, all animals that had undergone optogenetic mapping at 8 weeks after SCI were sacrificed and perfused. Spinal cords containing the lesion epicenters were dissected out, embedded, and sectioned at 30\u2009\u03bcm. A set of serial cross-sections of spinal cord were stained with cresyl violet and eosin. Lesion areas were outlined and quantified under an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped with a Neurolucida system (MicroBrightField, Colchester, VT) and ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).\n\nQuantification of biotin dextran amine\u2013labeled axons, Fluoro-Gold\u2013labeled neurons, and synapses\nFor quantification of neurons labeled by FG in the motor cortex and red nucleus, every third brain section involving anatomical sites of motor cortex and red nucleus were chosen. Only labeled cells that were fluorescent with clearly defined somata were counted. Boundaries of the motor cortex and red nucleus were established using a stereotaxic mouse brain atlas.\n35\nUsing similar methods, the numbers of neurons co-labeled with c-Fos and DAPI were counted in every third brain section involving red nucleus. The number of labeled cells per section for each mouse was calculated by dividing the total number of labeled cells counted in that mouse by the number of counted sections that contained the motor cortex or red nucleus.\nTo quantify the BDA-labeling axons projecting from the motor cortex to red nucleus, serial brain sections involving the red nucleus were chosen. Density of BDA labeled axons was quantified using NIH ImageJ software as described previously.\n10\nUnder low magnification (10\u2009\u00d7\u2009objective), the outline of red nucleus was drawn, BDA-labeled axons within the red nucleus were detected, and then density of BDA-labeled axons was quantified. The number of synapses was counted using a method described previously.\n36\nSpots of co-localization between BDA-labeled axons and FG-positive neurons in each counting area under high magnification (40\u2009\u00d7\u2009objective) were counted and corrected by the number of FG neurons in the same area within the red nucleus. In each animal, we chose three sections for quantifying the density of BDA-labeled axons and the number of synapses, respectively.\n\nRecording corticorubral synaptic responses\nin vivo\nTen C57Bl mice, at 2.5\u20133.0 months old, were equally assigned to a sham group and a moderate SCI group. At 6 weeks after SCI or sham surgery, mice were anesthetized with i.p. injection of 250\u2013500\u2009mg/kg of Avertin. After a mouse was placed on a stereotactic device, two holes were drilled on the skull, with one above the hindlimb area of the motor cortex for stimulation (bregma \u22120.8\u2009mm and lateral 1\u2009mm) and the other above the red nucleus (bregma 3.5\u2009mm and lateral 0.5\u2009mm) for recording evoked responses. After a concentric bipolar electrode (FHC, Inc., Bowdoin, ME) was lowered into the motor cortex to a depth of 600\u2013700\u2009\u03bcm and a tungsten microelectrode (WPI, Sarasota, FL) was lowered to a depth of 3400\u2009\u03bcm, single electrical pulses were applied (200\u2009\u03bcs at 0.2\u201310.0\u2009mA) to the stimulating electrode once every 15\u2009sec. For each mouse, stimulus intensity was started from 0.2\u2009mA and gradually increased to up to 10\u2009mA. Response thresholds were determined when around 50% of the stimuli induced responses. Once the threshold stimulus intensity was determined, increasing stimulating currents at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 times the threshold were applied to determine a stimulus-response relationship. Responses were amplified at 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009, digitized, and saved to a computer. For analysis, responses from 30 repetitions at each intensity were averaged and peak amplitude and latency were measured in Clampfit software.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. One- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post-hoc analysis or Student's\nt\n-test were used to evaluate statistical significance. Correlation coefficients were calculated as Pearson correlation coefficients (\nR\n) and as multiple linear regression correlation coefficients (\nR\n2\n). Pearson correlations were performed between motor map size and behavioral scores, and between motor map size and neurons labeled with FG in the red nucleus. All statistical values were calculated using GraphPad Prism software (version 7.0; GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA), and\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (23\u201324 days old; weighing 60\u201380\u2009g) were procured from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Rats were housed in pairs under controlled conditions and used for experiments after 30 days of age. All procedures were carried out in accord with the institutional guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences\u2013New Jersey Medical School (Newark, NJ).\n\nLateral fluid-percussion injury\nRats (age, P31) were subject to lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI) as previously described.\n15\n,\n42\nThe FPI method produced diffuse moderate TBI. Briefly, animals were anesthetized with ketamine (80\u2009mg/kg intraperitoneally [i.p.]) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg i.p.) and positioned on a stereotaxic frame after confirming surgical plane anesthesia. A 3-mm craniotomy was performed on the left side of the skull \u22125\u2009mm posterior to the bregma and 3\u2009mm lateral to the sagittal suture while retaining the dura. A Luer\u2013Lock syringe hub was glued surrounding the exposed dura using a cyanoacrylate adhesive. After 24\u2009h, injury was induced to the TBI group (\nn\n=\u20099) by attaching the Luer\u2013Lock hub of each isoflurane-anesthetized animal to the FPI device (Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA). A pendulum drop delivered a brief 20-ms impact on the intact dura. Impact pressure was measured by an extracranial transducer and controlled between 1.8 and 2.0 atmospheres. For the sham group (\nn\n=\u20098), animals underwent surgery to implant the hub and were isoflurane anesthetized and attached to the FPI device without the pendulum drop. Immediate neurological parameters, such as apnea, startle, and seizure-like behavior, were assessed within the first few minutes after injury. Sham and injured animals were subsequently monitored for the next 1\u2009h and returned to their housing environment and monitored on a daily basis. One week after injury, animals were briefly anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5\u20132.0%) and the Luer\u2013Lock hub was gently removed by twisting and the scalp was closed. Scalp incisions were completely healed by 3 weeks after injury over all animals.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nMRI experiments were performed at adolescence (2 months after TBI). Animals were anesthetized using i.p. injection of urethane (1.3\u2009mg/kg body weight), then placed in a custom-built frame, where they were freely breathing a mixture of O\n2\nand N\n2\nO (30/70%) through a nose cone. Body temperature was monitored throughout the procedure using a rectal probe and maintained within 35\u201337\u00b0C using warm water pumped through a pad.\nMRI data were obtained on a modified 9.4 Tesla system with a Bruker spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) and custom-built\n1\nH ellipsoidal surface coil (5\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009cm). Images were acquired over 12 contiguous coronal slices (thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm), covering the parenchyma between the olfactory bulb and cerebellum, with an in-plane field of view of 3.2\u2009\u00d7\u20091.6\u2009cm. Anatomical reference images (repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE]\u2009=\u20094000/30\u2009ms, two averages) were acquired in a 128\u2009\u00d7\u200964 matrix, for an effective in-plane resolution of 250\u2009\u00d7\u2009250\u2009\u03bcm. Diffusion-sensitive images for DTI (TR/TE\u2009=\u20094000/20\u2009ms, for averages) were acquired as a four-segment echo planar imaging (EPI) in a 64\u2009\u00d7\u200932 matrix (in-plane resolution\u2009=\u2009500\u2009\u00d7\u2009500\u2009\u03bcm), with five A\n0\nimages, 30 diffusion directions, and a b-value of 1000\u2009s/mm\n2\n. fMRI images using the EPI sequence (TR/TE\u2009=\u20091000/15\u2009ms, preceded by eight dummy scans) were acquired with the same geometry as DTI: For the resting-state paradigm, each scan lasted for 5\u2009min (300 repetitions), repeated four times per animal; the arterial CO\n2\nchange-induced cerebrovascular reactivity functional scans lasted for 12\u2009min (720 repetitions), with 10% CO\n2\nadded to the breathing gas mixture between minutes 3 and 6 of the acquisition, and repeated twice per animal. Last, a fast three-dimensional (3D) anatomical scan (TR/TE\u2009=\u200950/5.6\u2009ms, FA\u2009=\u200920 degrees, two averages) was acquired with an isotropic resolution of 250\u2009\u03bcm, for image registration purposes.\n\nStatistical analysis\nUsing BioImage Suite (\nhttp://bioimagesuite.yale.edu/\n), the tensor model was fitted at every voxel of the diffusion-sensitive images to generate parametric maps of fractional anisotropy (FA) and the three eigenvalues were averaged to obtain apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps as described in our earlier studies.\n43\nUsing Analysis of Functional Neuro Image (AFNI) software,\n44\nfunctional images of CO\n2\nchallenge were corrected for motion and spatially smoothed using a Gaussian filter (full width at half maximum FWHM\u2009=\u20091.5\u2009mm). Parametric maps of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) were generated from a voxel-level linear model and expressed as the\nt-\nstatistical value of the contrast between baseline (frames 1\u2013180) and CO\n2\nchallenge (frames 210\u2013360). For resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis, images were pre-processed and corrected for slice time and motion. Subsequently, images were linearly detrended, band-pass filtered (0.01\u20130.15\u2009Hz), and spatially smoothed using a Gaussian filter (FWHM\u2009=\u20091.5\u2009mm). Six seed voxels were randomly placed on the right (contralateral to the injury) sensorimotor cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus with the regions identified according to the rat brain atlas.\n45\nThe signal time series from each selected random seed was cross-correlated with the entire brain producing six correlation maps each for the sensorimotor, hippocampal, and thalamic region seeds as demonstrated in our earlier studies.\n46\nVoxel-level correlation maps obtained with the six seed voxels were averaged in each animal and subsequently across animals in each group after Fisher z-transformation to generate group-level average RSFC maps. Voxels with average Pearson correlation coefficients (cc) >0.2 in clusters of at least 30\u2009mm\n3\n, corresponding to a corrected\np\n<\u20090.05, represented active voxels of the respective RSFC network.\n3D anatomical images were used to generate a nonlinear transform from each animal subject's native space to a common standard space, consisting of an averaged brain from all sham animals. The transform was then applied to all parametric maps of FA, ADC, CVR, and RSFC networks. Regions of interest (ROIs), which included the cortex, hippocampus, corpus callosum, internal capsule, and cingulum, were drawn on the common anatomical template of co-registered average brains from sham group identified using the rat brain atlas.\n45\nGroup contrasts were calculated from co-registered images with a voxel-level linear model for each modality, and significant differences were determined between sham and TBI groups using a two-tailed\nt\n-test with an adjusted threshold of\np\n<\u20090.05 corrected for multiple comparisons using a random field theory approach.\n47\nSignificantly different voxels were depicted as a color overlay on the anatomical image. Between-hemisphere differences were tested for asymmetry using the two-tailed\nt\n-test of the mean values from corresponding ROIs across each hemisphere in both sham and TBI groups."

    "Methods": "This review was conducted and reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement.13A protocol was registered on June 10, 2014 with the University of York's International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (registration number CRD42014013623; available at:http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42014013623).\n\nThis review is being prepared as a \u201cliving systematic review\u201d as part of the CENTER-TBI project (www.center-tbi.eu).14A living systematic review is a high-quality, up-to-date online summary of health research that is updated as new research becomes available.12In practice, this means that the searches will be rerun frequently and any new studies incorporated into the review. We will seek to publish regular updates. In this context, we would see this article as part of a knowledge commons, which would provide a basis for ongoing update of the available literature in this area, could be revised and updated by collaboration between both current and new contributors.\n\nInclusion/exclusion criteria\nWe included all studies of five or more adult patients (over 16 years of age) with TBI of all severities, which reported a global functional outcome measure of any type, reported by patient genotype (including mortality, Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS], GOS-extended [GOSE], and Disability Rating Scale [DRS]). We also included studies that reported neuropsychological outcome. We only included studies in the English language.\nWe excluded studies that included non-TBI or pediatric patients, and those that did not report outcome data separately for the adult TBI cohort. Studies reporting nonfunctional outcome measures, such as histological findings at post-mortem, were also excluded. We elected to exclude studies with less than 5 patients given that such small patient numbers would not likely add to our review. Conversely, we did not restrict ourselves only to studies with a larger number of patients because this would have excluded several of the publications in this field. Finally, any studies reporting APOE as the genetic association of interest were not included within this systematic review. A separate living systematic review on APOE, and its association with patient outcome in adult TBI, is currently underway by our group. This was conducted as a separate living systematic review given the large volume of APOE studies available, warranting a separate review dedicated to this gene in adult TBI.\n\nSearch strategy\nAt the beginning of August 2017, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CINAHL (all through National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE] Healthcare Databases) and Google Scholar were searched for published studies, and conference abstracts from inception to the start of August 2017 inclusive. Developed with search experts at Monash University's National Trauma Research Institute (NTRI), search strategies used a combination of keywords and MeSH terms (see\nSupplementary Appendix 1\n). Reference lists of included studies were manually reviewed to identify relevant publications not identified by the search strategy. Wherever conference abstracts were found, a further PubMed search was performed to discover whether the data had subsequently been published in full.\n\nStudy selection\nCitations were downloaded into EndNote (Thomson Reuters) and duplicates removed. Titles and abstracts were screened against the eligibility criteria in EndNote by one author (C.A.M.), to remove irrelevant studies, and the remaining citations were reviewed in full text independently by two authors (C.A.M., with either V.F.J.N. or F.A.Z.) to assess them for eligibility. Disagreements regarding eligibility were resolved by consensus, and referral to a third reviewer (D.K.M.) was not required.\n\nData extraction\nCitations and full-text files for all included studies were uploaded to Covidence (\nwww.covidence.org\n), an online systematic review workflow tool, to undertake quality assessment and data extraction. Two authors (C.A.M., with either F.A.Z. or V.F.J.N.) independently extracted data, resolving disagreements through consensus. The following characteristics were extracted from all studies, where available:\n1.\nInclusion/exclusion criteria\n2.\nBaseline characteristics, where possible, for each genotype within the cohort:\na.\u2002Cohort sex composition\nb.\u2002Age (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation [SD] if available)\nc.\u2002TBI severity (wherever possible as mean Glasgow Coma Sclae [GCS]\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, or GCS grouped according to existing practice as mild, moderate, or severe TBI)\n3.\nOutcome data (see below)\n4.\nFunding source(s)\nFor studies reporting global functional outcomes (e.g., GOS/GOSE, modified Rankin, numerical rating scale [NRS], DRS, and mortality), scores were extracted at all available time points for each genotype. Where possible, the total numbers of patients assessed at each time point was extracted and used to calculate the number of patients with a \u201cfavorable\u201d outcome. Categorical scales were dichotomized in line with previously recognized methods for defining \u201cfavorable\u201d outcomes (i.e., GOS 4\u20135, GOSE 5\u20138). If the reported data simply included author-defined favorable or unfavorable outcomes, without a breakdown of the underlying raw categorical data, then this was extracted instead. If ordinal data were not available, the mean scores and SDs (or standard errors/95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were extracted. In studies dealing with neuropsychological scales or other outcomes (e.g., measures of fatigue), reports of statistically significant differences between genotype results (at the alpha level selected by the study's authors) were extracted, with a narrative note made of nonsignificant results. In the case of no significant results being reported, results of the study were assumed to show no positive results, and the study was reported as negative for the SNP in question.\n\nRisk of bias assessment\nRisk of bias was assessed using the Quality In Prognostic Studies (QuIPS) risk of bias criteria, a validated domain-based tool for quality assessment of prognostic studies.\n15\nQuIPS addresses six important areas to consider when evaluating validity and bias in studies of prognostic factors: participation, attrition, prognostic factor measurement, confounding measurement and account, outcome measurement, and analysis and reporting. The rating system for QuIPs is trichotomous, with a range from low risk, medium risk and high risk of bias. The lowest risk of bias that a study may receive in any given category is low risk. Two authors (C.A.M., with either F.A.Z. or V.F.J.N.) independently completed the QuIPS for each study and then reached a final judgement on each of the six domains by consensus. The results of this process are presented for each study, as well as tabulated for the study overall (\nSupplementary Appendix 11\n). In line with the guidance provided by the team who developed QuIPS, we did not calculate a summated score for overall study quality.\n\nData synthesis\nMany of the publications reviewed included results on outcome association for more than one SNP, and individual cohorts were sometimes used to explore the effect of more than one SNP in separate publications, though this was not always explicitly stated. Consequently, the results in the text of this article primarily relates to analysis with references to specific SNPs. The tables in the Supplementary Materials tabulate individual publications under summaries for each SNP, or class of SNPs. Where a study was used to explore more than one SNP or class of SNP, it was cited separately in the table that addressed results for that SNP. Studies were grouped by gene, where multiple mutations within a gene were studied. Within each group of genes, studies were subdivided for analysis by TBI severity/patient characteristics, or by outcome measures. Given the large number of heterogeneous studies with mixed patient cohorts and varied SNPs analyzed, a meta-analysis was not performed, and the results were synthesized narratively. Simple descriptive statistics can be found in the summary of patient cohorts for the various SNPs analyzed (\nSupplementary Appendix 4\n)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Kentucky, and that were conducted in accordance with the standards of proper experimentation in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and ARRIVE guidelines. Experiments used four-month-old C57BL/6J mice and included an equal ratio of male and female for all end points. This project used a total of 204 mice: 36 mice were used for mitochondrial isolation; 19 mice were used for behavioral assays; 37 mice were used for pCASL and\n1\nH-MRS experiment 1; 112 mice were used for\n1\nH-MRS experiment 2; 22 of the 204 mice were not included in the data analysis for reasons described in the following method sections for each end point. The final number mice used for each end point are indicated in the figure or figure legend.\nMice were randomized and assigned groups before the start of the experiment. The study was completed with multiple batches of mice using a block experimental design, with each batch including all experimental groups; the order of the group was randomized for each block, so that the order of sham and CHI surgery varied for each cage. Each cage of mice included more than one experimental group. Each subject was given a unique identification number, which does not identify the experimental group. The persons conducting the mitochondrial bioenergetics (HV), behavior (TM), and neuroimaging (DNL, VB) were blinded to the treatment conditions and were not involved on the surgery or postoperative care of the mice, which could potentially lead to unblinding of the experimental groups.\n\nCHI\nThe CHI was performed as described previously.\n12\n,\n13\nBriefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3\u20135%). The head was stabilized in a astereotaxic frame before a midline sagittal incision was made. A 1\u2009mL latex pipette bulb filled with water was placed under the head. The stereotaxic electromagnetic impactor\n14\nused a 5.0\u2009mm flat steel tip (Leica Biosystems). It delivered a closed-skull midline impact (coordinates: mediolateral, 0.0\u2009mm; anteroposterior, 1.5\u2009mm) 1.0\u2009mm deep with a controlled velocity (5.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u2009m/sec) and a dwell time of (100\u2009msec). No mice were eliminated because of surgery complications. Mice were randomized to a group (sham or injured), with each group containing approximately 50% males and females. Sham mice received the incision, but not the impact and were included for the three day post-injury and 28 day post-injury time points.\n\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC)\nMice were deep anesthetized with 5% isoflurane before transcardial perfusion with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 5\u2009min. The brains were rapidly removed, dissected, processed for IHC end points as described previously.\n12\n,\n13\nPrimary antibodies used included: rabbit anti-\u03b2APP (LifeTechnologies cat# 51\u20132700 (1:2000)) and rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Dako Cat# Z0334; (1:10,000). Aperio ScanScope XT digital slidescanner was used to image the entire stained slide at 20x magnification to create a single high-resolution digital image.\n\nMitochondrial bioenergetics\nTotal mitochondria were isolated from the cortex and hippocampus as described previously.\n15\n,\n16\nSynaptic and nonsynaptic mitochondria were isolated from the cortex as described previously.\n3\nMitochondrial bioenergetics were measured using the Seahorse XF-24 Flux Analyzer as described previously.\n16\nOne mitochondria sample from the cortex was lost because of technical error.\n\nSix-arm radial arm water maze\nA modified four-day version of the previously reported radial arm water maze (RAWM)\n13\n,\n17\nwas used as described previously.\n12\n,\n13\nThe RAWM protocol consisted of four days of training, which occurred on nonconsecutive days (that is, day 14, 15, 16, and 21 post-injury). The total trials/day were 15, and each trial was up to 60\u2009sec long. EthoVision (Noldus Information Technology) was used for video recording and scoring behavior. A memory retention 60\u2009sec probe trial was performed seven days after the last training day (28 days post-injury). Time spent in the goal arm and the percentage of entries in the goal were recorded.\n\nMR imaging\nMR imaging was performed on a 7-Tesla Clinscan scanner (Bruker, Billerica, MA) using a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 Bruker brain surface coil or a Bruker quadrature, cryocoil at the University of Kentucky Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy Center, as described previously.\n18\nHeart rate (90\u2013130\u2009bpm), respiration rate, and rectal temperature (37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C) were monitored continuously. A water bath with circulating water at 45\u201350\u00b0C was used to maintain the body temperature. The order of mice scanned was randomized between sham and CHI groups for each acquisition period.\nT2-weighted structural images were acquired with field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u200918\u2009\u00d7\u200918\u2009mm\n2\n, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256; slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm, six slices, repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20091500\u2009msec, and echo time (TE)\u2009=\u200935\u2009msec.\nQuantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) (units of mL/g per min) was measured using MR based pCASL. A whole-body volume coil was used for transmission, and a mouse brain surface coil was placed on top of the head for receiving. Paired control and label images were acquired with a train of Hanning window-shaped radiofrequency pulses of duration and spacing 200/200\u2009\u03bcsec and the following parameters: flip angle\u2009=\u200925 degrees, slice-selective gradient\u2009=\u20099mT/m, labeling duration\u2009=\u20092100\u2009msec, echo spacing\u2009=\u20090.33\u2009msec. A two-dimensional multi-slice spin-echo planner imaging sequence was used with a FOV: 18.0\u2009\u00d7\u200918.0mm\n2\n, matrix\u2009=\u2009128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091.0\u2009mm, six slices, TR\u2009=\u20094000\u2009msec, and TE\u2009=\u200920\u2009msec with 1200 repetitions.\n19\nManual shimming was applied after automatic shimming with the lowest possible frequency obtained before the image was acquired. Ten measurements were obtained before the usable 120 measurements as a test run to optimize the phase adjustment between two successive tagging radiofrequency pulses.\n1\nH-MRS was acquired in the first setup experiments using the 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092-surface coil, a single\n1\nH-voxel of interest was defined as the bilateral dorsal hippocampus with a size of 12.48\u2009mm\n3\n(2.0\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20095.23\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20091.2\u2009mm). Acquisition parameters for applied PRESS spectroscopy sequence include: TR\u2009=\u20091500\u2009msec, TE\u2009=\u2009135\u2009msec, flip angle (FA)\u2009=\u200990 deg, rotation (R\u2009=\u20090 deg), spectral width (SW\u2009=\u200960\u2009Hz), and averages (A\u2009=\u2009400). Manual shimming was applied after automatic shimming on a shimming volume 30% larger than the spectroscopy voxel to maximize the suppression of outer-voxel water. A second acquisition with 10 averages and no water suppression was acquired and used to calculate metabolite concentrations relative to water.\n1\nH-MRS was acquired in the second set of experiments using the cryocoil; acquisition parameters for the LASER spectroscopy sequence\n20\nfor the cryocoil include: TR\u2009=\u20092500\u2009msec, TE\u2009=\u200921\u2009msec, FA\u2009=\u200990, R\u2009=\u20090 deg, SW\u2009=\u2009250, and A\u2009=\u2009200. The LASER sequence was used for the second set of experiments to maximize the suppression of outer-voxel water and use a short TE. This maximizes signal to noise, allows for the measurement of metabolites not observable at higher TEs, and increases sensitivity to metabolite concentrations. The single\n1\nH-voxel of interest was defined as the bilateral dorsal hippocampus. Manual shimming was applied after automatic shimming on a shimming volume 30% larger than the spectroscopy voxel to maximize the suppression of outer-voxel water. The lowest possible full width half maximum (FWHM) was obtained, and any spectra with a FWHM greater than 40\u2009Hz as determined by the LCmodel processing software was eliminated. A second acquisition with 10 averages and no water suppression was acquired and used to calculate metabolite concentrations relative to water.\n\npCASL data analysis\nMANGO software (version 3.8, UT Health, San Antonio, TX) was used to quantify the blood perfusion to the brain. pCASL images were overlaid on top of the T2-weighted structural images in MANGO software to visualize the regions of interest (ROI). Labeling efficiency (e.g., >0.85) was used to verify the quality of the image series. Four mice were excluded because of a poorly acquired image. The pCASL images were analyzed using a custom, in-house developed MATLAB (Natick, MA) script, based on published equations.\n21\nA single image slice was used for the CBF quantification with approximate coordinates of 1.5\u20131.7\u2009mm anterposterior).\n\n1\nH-MRS data analysis\nThe concentrations of the metabolites were derived from the Linear Combination model (LCModel) on a Linux operation system.\n22\n,\n23\nThe concentrations of the metabolites (in \u03bcM) were computed using the following equation:\nwhere [\nm\n] is the concentration of the specific metabolite, S\nm\nis the metabolite intensity obtained from\n1\nH-MRS, S\nwater\nis the water intensity, [water] is the water concentration (55.14\u2009mM at 310\u2009K), C\nn\nis the correction for the number of equivalent nuclei for each resonance, and C\nav\nis the correction for the number of average.\n18\n,\n24\nFor each spectra, a signal to noise ratio was calculated by LCModel; the FWHM estimate of 0.049 was used as a cutoff for the cyrocoil\n1\nH-MRS results. Nine mice were excluded because of a FWHM greater than 0.049.\n\nStatistical analysis\nJMP Software version 12.0 (SAS institute, Cary, NC) was used for statistical analysis. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for RAWM. For all other end points, a one-way ANOVA was used comparing injury groups. If a significant main effect was found,\npost hoc\nanalysis was used to compare groups. The normality assumption was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and heterogeneity of variances was assessed with the Levene test. Differences between mean were considered significant at \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05. Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism version 7.0. Values are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM), unless otherwise noted. Scatter plots represent individual mice. No difference was found between the sham group three days post-surgery compared with the sham group at 28 days post-surgery; therefore, these groups were collapsed into a single sham group for all end points. Number of mice used for each end point are indicated in the figure or figure legend."

    "Methods": "Animal model\nThe neonatal piglet data described within were retrospectively amalgamated from three separate experiments. Inclusion criteria for the current study were normothermic, sham control piglets that had complete and time-synchronized data for arterial blood pressure, laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), and ICP from our previously published studies.\n6\n,\n11\n,\n12\nTwenty-two piglets met the inclusion criteria: 1) control animals from a study on LLA\n6\n(\nn\n=\u20098; age, 5\u201310 days; weight, 2.2\u20133.9\u2009kg); 2) sham controls for a model of cardiac arrest\n11\n(\nn\n=\u20097; age, 3\u20135 days; weight, 1\u20132.5\u2009kg); and 3) sham normothermic controls for a model of cardiac arrest with hypothermic therapy\n12\n(\nn\n=\u20097; age, 3\u20135 days; weight, 1\u20132.5\u2009kg). All procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Johns Hopkins University and complied with the United States Public Health Service Policy on Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Further, animal care was in accord with National Institutes of Health Guidelines and ensured animals' comfort.\n\nAnesthesia and surgical preparation\nWe previously published detailed methodology of these experiments.\n6\n,\n11\n,\n12\nBriefly, male piglets were intubated and mechanically ventilated to maintain normocapnea. General anesthesia was provided with isoflurane in a 50%/50% nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture, fentanyl infusion and, as needed, boluses, and pancuronium or vecuronium infusions. Fentanyl and neuromuscular blockade were given through a femoral venous catheter. The isoflurane dose was held constant for the duration of the experiment. Arterial blood pressure was continuously monitored by an indwelling femoral artery catheter. A 5-F esophageal balloon catheter (Cooper Surgical, Trundall, CT) was placed into the contralateral femoral vein and advanced into the inferior vena cava for later induction of hypotension. A ventricular ICP monitor and a cortical LDF probe (model DRT4; 60\u2009Hz; Moor Instruments, Devon, UK) to measure CBF were placed through small cranial burr holes. ICP and LDF were monitored in the same cerebral hemisphere. For all animals, pCO\n2\nwas targeted to maintain eucarbia and a pH of 7.35\u20137.45\n6\nor a pCO\n2\nof 40\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009mm Hg\n11\nand 40\u2009\u00b1\u20097\u2009mm Hg.\n12\n\nControlled hypotension\nThe balloon catheter was slowly inflated in the inferior vena cava using a saline syringe pump. Hypotension was induced from baseline to near-zero blood pressure over 2\u20133\u2009h. This slow induction of hypotension permitted capture of slow-wave ICP fluctuations for analysis of cerebrovascular reactivity.\n\nSignal acquisition and processing\nAll signals from the combined above monitoring modalities were recorded and archived for future retrospective use. All recorded signals were digitized by an A/D converter (DT9804; Data Translation, Marlboro, MA), sampled at a frequency of 50\u2009Hz or higher, using ICM+ software (Cambridge Enterprise Ltd, Cambridge, UK;\nhttp://icmplus.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk\n). Signal artifacts, such as transducer adjustments, were removed before further processing or analysis using tools available in ICM+.\nCPP was determined as: MAP \u2013 ICP. AMP was determined by calculating the fundamental Fourier amplitude of the ICP signal over a 10-sec window, updated every 10\u2009sec. This was done over the range consistent with the normal range for piglet heart rate (i.e., 100\u2013350 beats per minute). Finally, 10-sec moving averages (without data overlap) were calculated for all recorded signals: ICP, AMP, ABP (i.e., producing MAP), CPP, and LDF measurement of CBF (LDF-CBF). Piglets' archived signals were retrospectively interrogated and analyzed.\nThe following continuous indices of cerebrovascular reactivity were derived: PRx, PAx, RAC, and LDF-derived Lx (correlation between LDF-CBF and CPP). All indices were derived by moving Pearson correlation coefficients between 30 consecutive 10-sec average values of relevant signals and their parameters (i.e., 5\u2009min of data), updated every minute.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis was conducted utilizing R statistical software (R Core Team [2016]; R: A language and environment for statistical computing; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria;\nhttps://www.R-project.org/\n). The following packages were used: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse, lubridate, segmented, and pROC. Where significance is reported, alpha was set at 0.05. The following analysis described is similar to that performed within previous studies on the LLA.\n6\nThis was done so as to allow comparison between the results and potentially provide validation of the results observed within that study.\n6\n\nFinding the lower limit of autoregulation\nIn order to determine the LLA of autoregulation in the 22 animals, we used piece-wise linear regression of the CPP versus LDF-CBF plots. The LDF-CBF signal was standardized against the individual animal's baseline LDF-CBF signal, producing \u201c% change of LDF-CBF from baseline.\u201d This is similar to other studies evaluating LDF-CBF.\n6\n,\n11\n,\n12\nThe piece-wise regression process used a starting point for estimation of the break point in either LDF-CBF. This starting point was visually estimated from the ICM+ plots of CPP versus LDF-CBF. The piece-wise regression process used a starting point for estimation of the break point in either LDF-CBF. This starting point was visually estimated from the ICM+ plots of CPP versus LDF-CBF versus CPP, described above. Despite this initial visual inspection, the automated piece-wise linear regression was conducted by the \u201csegmented\u201d computational package within R statistical software. The \u201cstart point\u201d is only a starting reference for the automated algorithm to perform the piece-wise regression, with the full range of available CPP values tested during the process. This process functions on the assumption of continuity in data, splitting the data into two distinct linear segments. The intersection point of these two linear segments is considered the break point in the piece-wise function. The break point identified by the piece-wise regression process is one in which minimized the sum residual square error (SSE) of the two linear segments, above and below this point. This break point represents the LLA, with this method being described previously for the determination of the LLA in experimental models. This was conducted for each animal, with piece-wise regression plots produced denoting the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each fitted linear segment. Finally, the mean LLA for the cohort of 22 piglets was determined by averaging all 22 LLA values obtained.\n\nBinned cohort data and plot\nAfter delineating the mean LLA for the cohort, we then produced cohort-wide plots to inspect the population trend of various physiological measures against the LLA. We first binned all data across 5-mm Hg bins of CPP, using R statistical software. The following error bar plots were then produced: CPP versus % change in LDF-CBF from baseline, CPP versus PRx, CPP versus PAx, CPP versus RAC, and CPP versus Lx.\n\nComparing CPP for various clinical thresholds of PRx, PAx, and RAC to LLA\nWe wished to conduct a rough comparison of the CPP for clinically defined thresholds of PRx, PAx, and RAC to the CPP at the LLA, defined by piece-wise regression in each animal. To do so, we used a simplified piece-wise linear regression of CPP versus PRx and CPP versus PAx, using these models to determine the CPP in each animal for the following thresholds of PRx and PAx defined in TBI patients. For PRx, the thresholds of 0, +0.25, and +0.35 were tested, based on previous work in TBI\n4\nand currently unpublished data from our lab.\n13\nFor PAx, the thresholds of 0 and +0.25 were tested, based on unpublished work from our lab. Finally, for RAC, the thresholds of \u22120.10 and \u22120.05 were tested, again based on unpublished work from our lab. We then compared the CPP values at each threshold for PRx, PAx, and RAC, with the CPP values at the LLA using a Pearson correlation coefficient and Bland\u2013Altman analysis. The Bland\u2013Altman analysis was only conducted for those thresholds reaching statistically significant correlations with the LLA (i.e., PRx 0, PRx +0.25, and PRx +0.35).\n\nPrediction of continuous indices for impaired autoregulation\nAs done in previous studies,\n6\nwe performed receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis of PRx, PAx, RAC, and Lx across the cohort-defined LLA. This was conducted in order to determine the ability of these indices to predict being either above or below the LLA. For each piglet, one mean value for each variable was obtained at each 5-mm Hg bin of CPP (i.e., CPP\u2009=\u200940\u2009mm Hg, 45\u2009mm Hg, etc.). We utilized 5-mm Hg bins of CPP for the ROC analysis, given that this was what was conducted within the previous study by Brady and colleagues.\n6\nData were then given the binary designation of being above the LLA, or below the LLA, based on the LLA defined previously. Data from all 22 piglets was then used for the ROC analysis. Area under the curve (AUC) for the ROCs was reported and 95% CI reported by Delong's method. Significance values (i.e.,\np\nvalues) for the AUCs were derived from univariate logistic regression analysis. Comparison between AUCs was conducted using Delong's test.\nWe elected to use the ROC analysis based on population LLA, given that this is how the original studies were conducted to validate PRx- and NIRS-based indices in experimental models.\n6\nIn order to allow comparison across all studies (i.e., the previous work, and both part I and II of this article series), we maintained the analysis as such. Individual animal-specific LLA ROC analysis would lead to the inability to compare results to before and further limit the ability to extrapolate results to other animal models or human TBI data."

All participants were examined during sitting with and without using multi-site spinal stimulation over a range of intensities between the spinous processes of the 11th and 12th thoracic (T11 and T12) and the first and second lumbar (L1 and L2) vertebrae, hereafter referred to as T11 and L1. Stimulated and non-stimulated conditions alternated in a pseudo-random sequence at the individual level to achieve a balanced protocol. Each participant received each condition once within an experimental session. Each session was a maximum of 90\u2009min long, including setup, calibration, and testing. The duration of each exercise varied from 1 to 2\u2009min, and 2\u2009min of rest were provided between tests. A schematic representation of the experimental design and interventions is shown in\nFigure 1A\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\n(A)\nSchematic representing the experimental design protocol and interventions. Eight individuals were tested in a single experimental session without and in the presence of transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation.\n(B)\nTesting room layout and experimental setup.\n(C)\nRepresentative participant (P5) without (left) and with submotor threshold spinal stimulation (right). Note the decrease in trunk curvature (orange), increase in trunk angle (green), and improvement in upright sitting posture and spinal alignment. Key anatomical landmarks are shown without (blue) and with stimulation (red).\n\nAssessment of postural control\nThree primary tests were performed: quiet sitting, multi-directional leaning (\u201coctagon\u201d), and self-initiated perturbations. During each test, participants were instructed to sit unsupported on the force plate and attempt to actively maintain their trunk as upright as possible, maintain balance, and minimize the use of their arms and heads. One researcher was standing behind each participant to ensure the safety of the participants and to provide assistance to prevent falls if needed. During the quiet sitting test, participants were instructed to sit as quietly as possible for 60\u2009sec with eyes open. After 2\u2009min of rest, the task was repeated with the participant's eyes closed. During the multi-directional leaning test, the ability to voluntarily displace the center of pressure (COP) to a maximum distance without losing balance was assessed.\n39\nParticipants were instructed to lean from the center position as far as possible in the indicated direction without losing balance, while keeping their backs extended. The COP position registered by a force plate was visualized on the monitor to provide feedback on body displacement. Eight targets were presented at 45 degree angle increments around the center, starting in the forward right direction. The participant was asked to move the COP indicator to each target, which was present for 5\u2009sec, hold the position during that time, and return to the starting position.\nThen, a self-initiated perturbation test was performed in seven participants (P1\u20134, P6\u20138) to assess the efficiency of postural corrective responses. The data from participant P5 were omitted from the group analysis because of incomplete video and three-dimensional (3D) kinematic recordings during the self-initiated perturbation test. In agreement with previous literature,\n40\nthe participants were instructed to rapidly raise their extended right arm forward to a horizontal position and then return the arm back to the initial position based on auditory cues.\n\nTranscutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation\nA custom-built, three channel constant-current stimulator with a range of 0\u2013250\u2009mA was used to deliver transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation. The stimulation was administered using two self-adhesive electrodes (ValuTrode, Axelgaard Ltd., Fallbrook, CA) with a diameter of 3.2\u2009cm placed as cathodes on the skin over T11 and L1. In addition, two 7.5\u2009\u00d7\u200913\u2009cm self-adhesive electrodes serving as anodes (ValuTrode) were placed symmetrically on the skin over the iliac crests. A foam rubber pad was placed over the cathodes and secured using adhesive tape, and an elastic belt was wrapped tightly around the trunk above the waist to ensure a constant pressure between the electrodes and the skin. The stimulation waveform consisted of monophasic, rectangular 1\u2009ms pulses at a frequency of 30\u2009Hz during stimulation over T11, and 15\u2009Hz during stimulation over L1, with each pulse filled with a carrier frequency of 10\u2009kHz.\n41\nIn the beginning of each experimental session, the participants were instructed to maintain a \u201crelaxed\u201d sitting posture; that is, without actively trying to extend the trunk. During these preliminary tests, the stimulation intensity, ranging from 10 to 150\u2009mA at each location, was gradually increased to generate threshold motor outputs as detected via the COP movements recorded by the force plate and/or via changes in trunk extension and improved trunk curvature as confirmed by visual inspection (see\nSupplementary Video 1\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n).\nAfter that, the stimulation intensity at each location was adjusted to a submotor threshold level, which was then kept constant during the main tests with stimulation.\n\nElectromyography (EMG)\nEMG signals were recorded using bipolar surface electrodes. Signals from the right rectus abdominis (RA), external obliques (Obl), erector spinae at the levels of the seventh thoracic vertebra (E-T7) and the third lumbar vertebra (E-L3), rectus femoris (RF), and anterior deltoid (AD) muscles were recorded using a PowerLab 16/35 series DAQ system (ADInstruments, Australia) with a low-noise, high-gain differential amplifier (Octal Bio Amp, ADInstruments, Australia). A reference electrode was placed over the sternum. EMG signals were differentially amplified with a band-pass filter with a bandwidth between 10 and 2000\u2009Hz (\u22123\u2009dB) and digitized at a sampling frequency of 2\u2009kHz.\n\nForce plate system\nExperiments were performed using the \u2018\u2018Stabilan-01\u2019\u2019 (Rhythm, Russia) force plate analysis system. Participants were asked to sit on the force plate covered with a silicon mat, which was implemented into an elevated surface (\nFig. 1B\n). During the multi-directional leaning test, they were instructed to look at the monitor that was placed at eye level. Force plate data were sampled at 50\u2009Hz.\n\n3D Kinematics\nKinematic data were collected using the Xbox One Kinect (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). The Xbox One Kinect is a markerless computer vision system that uses an RGB camera and an infrared laser. Three-dimensional positioning was determined via a point cloud generated by the infrared laser and a triangulation process described by Freedman and coworkers.\n42\nEssentially, a laser light source is split via refraction after exiting a specialized lens that creates a point cloud on an object. These refractions are transmitted back to the Kinect receiver, which then processes the data using Onboard firmware.\nThe Xbox One Kinect was placed \u223c1.5\u2009m in front of the participant at \u223c2\u2009m height from ground level and angled 60 degrees downward. Video (RGB camera) and kinematic (infrared depth-finding camera) data were both acquired at 640\u2009\u00d7\u2009480 pixels of resolution and 30\u2009Hz. The kinematic model output of the Xbox One Kinect consisted of 24 segments of which the head, neck, intervertebral space between the VII cervical and I thoracic vertebrae (T8), XII thoracic and lumbar vertebrae (T12), III and IV lumbar vertebrae (L3), V lumbar vertebra and sacrum (lower trunk), and pelvis (midpoint between the left and right hip joint locations) landmarks were used to calculate trunk curvature, angle, and displacements during the quiet and dynamic seated tests. Trunk curvature was determined as the distance between the vertical line projecting from the anterior-superior iliac crest (ASIS), and a point corresponding to the maximal T12 landmark displacement in the anteroposterior (A-P) direction for forward and backward movements, or in the mediolateral (M-L) direction for left and right movements. The trunk angle (degrees) was determined as the angle between the horizontal line intersecting the ASIS and a vertical line from that to the head landmark from the Kinect sensor (\nFig. 1C\n).\n\nExperimental data processing and analysis\nCOP trajectory data from the force plate were analyzed in the A-P and M-L directions. The COP characteristics were quantified via total excursion, mean displacement, and mean acceleration. COP excursions were calculated where (x\ni\n,y\ni\n) was the COP position at frame\ni\nand N the total number of samples:\nThe maximum COP displacement for both the quiet and dynamic sitting tasks was defined for each direction as the mean COP position maintained for 0.24\u2009sec at the extreme points of a given direction; the primary directions (forward, backward, right, and left) were used to define the limits of stability.\nThe digitized EMG time series were full-wave rectified and filtered with custom Matlab code as outlined in\nFigure 2A\n. First, each individual, raw trunk muscle EMG (Obl, RA, E-T7, E-L3) was passed through a median filter with a 7.5\u2009ms sample window to reduce the magnitude of the noise signal and remove any significant outliers while retaining prominent muscle activation features; for example, muscle activation peaks. This signal was then passed through a high-pass filter with a 0.0001\u2009Hz cutoff frequency (E\nh\n) to bring the EMG signal to baseline (0 DC component), and then full-wave rectified (E\nr\n). The filtered and rectified signal, E\nr\n, was finally passed 10 times through a 15th order linear adaptive filter with \u0394 set to 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n\u22129\nsec.\n43\nThe input signal was E\nr\n, and the reference signal was the summation of both stimulation channels (Stim T7 and Stim L3). The linear adaptive filter was used to isolate the EMG artifacts caused by stimulation from both the T-7 and L-3 stimulation electrodes. An example of the EMG time series prior to and following filtering and the same signal post-filtering is shown in\nFigure 2B and C\n. Muscle activity was quantified by calculating the mean EMG signal amplitude, after measurement windows were normalized in duration for each trial. Incidences of lost balance were excluded from analysis. The EMG data of participant P3 were excluded from the group analysis because of the relatively low, T9 neurological level of SCI.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\n(A)\nSchematic representing the filtering of the trunk muscle's electromyography (EMG) time series. Note that for the linear adaptive filter, the reference signal was the sum of the T11 and L1 stimulation signals.\n(B)\nRepresentative raw unfiltered (left) and filtered (right) EMG sample from P1 without (light blue) and with (light red) the presence of stimulation.\n(C)\nZoomed in, 50\u2009ms sample of raw unfiltered (left) and filtered (right) EMG without (light blue) and with (light red) stimulation. The orange and green dashed lines indicate the enlarged segments without and with stimulation, respectively.\nCustom source code with a graphical interface was used to extract image, joint, and depth data from the Xbox One Kinect motion capture system. Custom Matlab (Mathworks, USA) code was used to plot and analyze the COP and kinematic joint location data and associated trajectories to determine the limits of stability, quantify spinal alignment, and graph EMG data during each test. The 3D kinematic data was used to determine the trunk angle and curvature. These displacements were then used to determine the velocity and acceleration profiles of each joint via single and double derivatives of the position profile, respectively.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using a within-subject statistical design. Comparisons among force plate data, EMG, and 3D kinematic positional data for all assessment tasks without and with the presence of stimulation were performed using the two tailed nonparametric Wilcoxon signed- rank test (\u03b1 < 0.05). The results for the pooled data are presented as mean values and standard deviations (SD). In addition to EMG comparisons within each of the quiet sitting, multi-directional leaning, and self-initiated perturbation tasks, comparisons between no stimulation in quiet sitting versus no stimulation in multidirectional leaning as well as stimulation in quiet sitting versus stimulation in multi-directional leaning were performed. Correlation coefficients between arm velocity and A-P COP displacement for the self-initiated perturbation were determined using the nonparametric Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, with rho and\np\nvalues indicated (\u03b1 < 0.05). A statistical comparison of the correlation coefficients, with the null hypothesis implying that the difference between no stimulation and stimulation conditions is 0, was performed. For this purpose, we used the cocor R package web-based interface (\nhttp://comparingcorrelations.org/\n) developed by the CRAN project (\nhttp://cran.r-project.org/package=cocor\n), using an \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05, and a confidence interval of 95%.\n44\nPearson and Filon's z test results are reported."

    "Methods": "Reagents\nBD vacutainer K\n2\nEDTA (dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) tubes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were used for blood collection. Affinity-purified rabbit anti-GFAP (antibody to GFAP) antiserum was purchased from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). Rabbit anti-CRMP2 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluors were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Rockford, IL). Purified recombinant GFAP (TP304548) and CRMP2 (TP309080) proteins were obtained from OriGene (Rockville, MD).\n\nHuman subjects\nThe protocol for the use of adult human subjects was reviewed and approved by the University of Texas Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects. All SCI subjects enrolled were over 18 years of age and had a traumatic, nonpenetrating SCI with deficit. Acute SCI subjects were enrolled within 5 days of SCI. Chronic SCI subjects were enrolled at greater than 1 year post-injury. Exclusion criteria included a known medical condition that accounted for neuropathic pain (e.g., diabetic neuropathy, renal insufficiency, human immunodeficiency virus\u2013associated, and ethanol-associated neuropathy) or diagnosis of cancer within the previous 5 years. In addition, chronic SCI subjects were excluded if they had a known infection at the time of, or within 30 days preceding, blood sampling. Blood samples were obtained with informed consent and were de-identified to provide confidentiality.\n\nNeuropathic pain classification\nPatients' neurological levels of injury were classified according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI)/American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS).\n22\nThe scale ranges from A (complete injury, no sensory or motor function preserved below the neurological level of injury or in the sacral segments S4\u2013S5) to E (normal sensory and motor function). The definition of neuropathic pain was based on a clinical diagnosis and documentation of neuropathic pain. In order for a subject to be classified as having neuropathic pain, there must have been documentation of pain that included the descriptor \u201c\nneuropathic\n.\u201d The IASP has proposed a uniform classification system to define pain as nociceptive (musculoskeletal and visceral) or neuropathic (at level and below level of injury).\n23\nIn accord with the proposed IASP classification and other recommendations, pain documented as \u201c\nacute pain due to trauma\n\u201d was not considered neuropathic pain, nor was nociceptive pain described as musculoskeletal, visceral, or headache.\n9\n,\n24\nTreatment with gabapentin or pregabalin, commonly used medications for neuropathic pain, was used as confirmation of the neuropathic categorization.\n10\n,\n25\nAdditionally, chronic SCI subjects and 18 of the 38 acute subjects completed the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-LANSS) pain scale and the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire as additional validation of their pain classification.\n26\u201328\nThe S-LANSS scale has been validated against clinical judgement.\n27\nThe S-LANSS self-assessment form was administered by trained personnel who instructed subjects to consider their pain within the last week and to focus on the most severe pain. The instrument includes a numeric visual analog scale for rating pain intensity and a diagram on which the subject indicates where the pain exists. Descriptors on the S-LANSS and in the McGill Pain Questionnaire include words commonly associated with neuropathic pain (e.g., pins and needles, electric shock, and burning). All subjects with an S-LANSS score of 12 or greater had clinical diagnoses of neuropathic pain.\n\nPlasma preparation\nFor autoantibody screening, blood samples were collected in K\n2\nEDTA tubes (BD) from 38 adult, acute, traumatic SCI patients at three time points: 6.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091 days post-injury (\nn\n=\u200937), 16\u2009\u00b1\u20097 days post-injury (\nn\n=\u200938), and 96\u2009\u00b1\u200954 days post-injury (\nn\n=\u200913). The 80 chronic SCI subjects (>1 year post-SCI) and 20 healthy volunteers (HVs) provided a one-time blood sample at enrollment. Blood cells were removed by centrifugation (4\u00b0C, 800\ng\nfor 10\u2009min), and the plasma fraction collected and centrifuged again (4\u00b0C, 10,000\ng\nfor 10\u2009min) to prepare platelet-poor plasma. Samples were aliquoted and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until assayed.\n\nTwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting\nLarge-format 2D gels (20\u2009\u00d7\u200922\u2009cm) were prepared by Kendrick Labs (Madison, WI) using cadaver brain tissue as the sample source. Resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for western analysis. To identify potential autoantibodies that appear in plasma after an SCI, pairs of identically prepared membranes were probed with plasma collected at <3 and 16\u2009\u00b1\u20097 days after SCI from representative study subjects with early post-injury samples (n\u2009=\u20092). Because the IgG response to a stimulus typically peaks around 10\u201330 days, novel immunopositive signals observed with the 16-day plasma were considered to be triggered by the injury.\n29\n,\n30\nMembranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) overnight, incubated with plasma (1:1000 dilution) for 3\u2009h at room temperature, then washed in TBS. Immunoreactivity was detected using anti-human IgG secondary antibodies coupled to ALP followed by chemiluminescence visualization. Immunoreactive spots detected on the paired blots were compared, and novel immunoreactive spots on the membranes probed with the 16-day plasma samples were identified and used to guide excision of the corresponding protein spots from a duplicate Coomassie-stained gel. Excised spots were sent for LC-MS/MS identification (Dr. Costel Darie Laboratory, Clarkson University Protein Core, Potsdam, NY).\n\nCapillary westerns\nCapillary westerns were carried out using a WES system, essentially as described by the vendor (ProteinSimple, San Jose, CA). Purified recombinant GFAP protein (160\u2009ng/\u03bcL) was denatured in a lithium dodecyl sulfate\u2013containing buffer including fluorescent standards to control for differences in separation across capillaries. Each assay included positive controls consisting of a commercial anti-GFAP antibody and a validated plasma sample containing GFAPab, and a negative control in which the primary antibody was not added. All plasma samples (1:50) for individual subjects were assayed simultaneously. Peak detection, AUC and the signal-to-noise ratio were calculated using\nCompass\nsoftware (ProteinSimple, San Jose, CA). Measurements of AUC, in arbitrary units, were used for comparison across groups.\n\nImmunodepletion of collapsin response mediator protein-2 from brain homogenate\nAn immunodepletion column was prepared by attaching a commercial CRMP2 antibody to a protein A agarose resin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) per the manufacturer's instructions. Cadaver brain was homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (10\u2009mM of Tris-Cl [pH 8.0], 1\u2009mM of EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 140\u2009mM of NaCl, 1\u2009mM of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL of leupeptin). The extract (100\u2009\u03bcg) was applied to the CRMP2/protein A column (containing 25\u2009\u03bcL of anti-CRMP2 resin) overnight at 4\u00b0C in order to allow binding of CRMP2. The flow-thru was then collected and used for western analysis to establish the specificity of the CRMP2ab signal.\n\nBinding competition studies\nTo verify autoantibody specificity, competition studies were performed. Plasma samples were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 160\u2009ng of target protein (e.g., GFAP for GFAP westerns), an equimolar amount of an unrelated protein (e.g., CRMP2 for GFAP westerns), or an equal volume of resuspension solution. After the overnight incubation, plasma samples were diluted (1:50) and used as primary antibodies for capillary-based western analysis as described above. To be considered autoantibody positive, plasma samples had to meet the following criteria: 1) having immunoreactivity above baseline; 2) immunoreactivity that decreased by >30% when pre-blocked with the target protein; and 3) immunoreactivity was not decreased when blocked with a competing protein.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSummary demographics for subject groups are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD). Data were assessed for normality using the Kolmogoroff\u2013Smirnov test. Data that were not normally distributed were compared using an appropriate nonparametric test. Two group comparisons at a single time point (e.g., SCI vs. healthy volunteers) were analyzed using the Mann\u2013Whitney rank-sum test, and the data are presented as medians. A Spearman rank-order correlation was used to examine if the level of GFAPab correlated with the S-LANSS score for neuropathic pain. Chi-square test was performed to determine the relationship between the presence of GFAPab or GFAPab + CRMP2ab and the development of neuropathic pain. A two-by-two table of subjects with and without neuropathic pain at 6 months, by those positive or negative for autoantibody at 16 days, was used to calculate the odds of developing neuropathic pain. Multiple logistic regression was performed controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), complete injury, and cervical injury level to evaluate the association between GFAPab and/or CRMP2ab and neuropathic pain. Significance was defined as\np\n\u2264\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Participants\nAdolescents and young adults (\nn\n=\u2009180) between the ages of 12 and 30 years (mean\u2009=\u200920.29, SD\u2009=\u20095.39) were recruited as part of a larger study.\n36\n,\n38\n,\n39\nPatients who had sustained either an mTBI (\nn\n=\u200983) or OI (\nn\n=\u200961) were recruited from a consecutive series of admissions to EDs of three level 1 trauma centers in Houston, Texas\u2014Texas Children's Hospital, Memorial-Hermann Hospital, and Ben Taub General Hospital\u2014by study personnel according to a rotating schedule. The TD group (\nn\n=\u200936) was recruited from the community by advertising. To be included, participants had to be right handed as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory\n40\nto control for hemispheric asymmetry. Overall study exclusionary criteria for participants in all groups included (1) lack of fluency in English or Spanish, (2) pre-existing neurological disorder or severe psychiatric disorder (e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia), (3) blood alcohol level >200\u2009mg/dL at initial evaluation in the ED (when measured), or (4) previous hospitalization for brain injury. The neurobehavioral outcome data for the three groups are reported elsewhere.\n38\nPatients in the mTBI and OI groups were generally screened and enrolled in the ED. However, to accommodate the schedules of the patients who were discharged from the ED, initial subacute assessments for most patients occurred within a target of 96\u2009h post-injury. In rare circumstances, the post-injury interval exceeded this window, with the longest interval being 130\u2009h in the mTBI group and 132\u2009h in the OI group.\nAll study procedures were conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, and approved by the institutional review boards of Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Memorial-Hermann Hospital, and Ben Taub General Hospital in Houston, Texas. Informed consent and assent (as appropriate) were obtained for each participant from the parent or other legally authorized representative (in the case of a minor) and/or from the participant.\nmTBI group\nPatients were included in the mTBI group if they had incurred an injury to the head from blunt trauma or acceleration/deceleration forces that resulted in one or more of the following: (1) observed or self-reported confusion, disorientation, or otherwise impaired consciousness; (2) loss of consciousness lasting <30\u2009min; (3) post-concussion symptoms;\n41\n(4) Glasgow Coma Scale\n42\n,\n43\nscore of 13\u201315 on examination in one of the three EDs and without delayed neurological deterioration; and (5) a period of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) <24\u2009h as assessed by the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT).\n44\u201346\nOther eligibility criteria for the mTBI group were a normal (negative) CT scan of the head within 24\u2009h after injury, and mild or no concomitant extracranial injury\n47\n(i.e., Abbreviated Injury Score [AIS] score \u22642).\n48\nOI group\nEligibility criteria for the OI group also included a mild injury (AIS \u22642) without external evidence or history of head trauma, or post-concussion symptoms.\nAll AIS ratings were made by AIS-certified research nurses based on detailed medical record review; head CT scans were reviewed by a board-certified neuroradiologist.\nTD group\nIndividuals comprising the uninjured, TD group were recruited through community bulletins, advertisements, and word of mouth. Recruitment efforts were made to ensure that the TD group had distributions of age, sex, level of education, and SES level that were comparable with those of the traumatic injury groups.\n\nMRI common data elements for imaging\nAlthough presence of an intracranial abnormality on clinical CT performed in the ED was an exclusion criterion, all MRI data were also reviewed by a single board-certified neuroradiologist (J.V.H.) for incidental findings and trauma-related abnormalities using the standardized Intra-agency Imaging Common Data Elements for Traumatic Brain Injury.\n49\nAll tiers of data collection were used, including presence or absence of each feature as well as anatomic location, and lesion or abnormality volume estimates, where applicable. In coding the MRI data, high-resolution T1-weighted, gradient recalled echo (GRE), fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) were utilized, as appropriate.\n\nDTI\nParticipants in the mTBI and OI groups underwent DTI at a subacute (within 96\u2009h) and later (3 months) post-injury period. Of the 83 patients with mTBI, 46 (55.4%) underwent DTI on both occasions; 39 of the 61 OI patients (63.9%) underwent DTI on both occasions. Participants in the TD group had DTI on a single occasion, according to the study design, as changes were not expected to occur across the 3 month interval.\nAcquisition\nDTI was performed on a Philips 3T scanner (Best, The Netherlands) using transverse multi-slice spin echo, single-shot, echo planar imaging sequences (6318.0\u2009ms repetition time [TR], 51\u2009ms echo time [TE], 2.0\u2009mm slices, 0\u2009mm gap, 224\u2009mm field of view, and 2.0\u2009\u00d7\u20092.0\u2009\u00d7\u20092.0\u2009mm voxel size, sensitivity encoding [SENSE] factor of 2). Diffusion was measured along 30 directions\n50\n(number of b-value\u2009=\u20092, low b-value\u2009=\u20090 and high b-value\u2009=\u20091000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n). To improve signal-to-noise ratio, two acquisitions were acquired and averaged.\nQuality assurance and stability of the MRI scanner\nAll DTI data were evaluated for image quality assurance (QA). To ensure consistent scanner performance throughout this longitudinal study, QA was evaluated every morning. QA involved implementing the American College of Radiology (ACR) (\nhttp://www.acr.org/quality-safety/accreditation/mri\n) recommended QA program that measures signal-to-noise ratio, field uniformity, gradient linearity, image distortions, and ghosting using the vendor provided phantom. Any scans that had unacceptable image quality were deleted from further analysis and are not included in the current analyses.\nQuantitative DTI fiber tractography analysis\nAll images were analyzed by experienced image analysts who were masked to group assignment. The Philips diffusion affine registration tool was used to remove shear and eddy current distortion and head motion prior to calculating FA maps with Philips fiber tracking 4.1V3 Beta 4 software.\n51\nRegions of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually using published protocols.\n52\u201354\nSelected ROIs for analysis were the total corpus callosum (total CC), right and left uncinate fasciculi (UF), right and left cingulum bundle (CB), right and left inferior longitudinal fasciculi (ILF), and right and left inferior frontal occipital fasciculi (IFOF). The tracts were selected based on their high reproducibility using tractographic techniques as well as their structural and functional significance to outcomes in mTBI. For example, disrupted interhemispheric transfer of information (total CC), and frontal-temporal UF, frontal-parietal CB, and long distance frontal-occipital IFOF connections that are associated with alterations of attention, episodic and working memory, cognitive processing speed, and cognitive control, and are commonly altered in mTBI.\n5\nMean FA and MD of each of the fiber tracts were extracted and analyzed. To examine intra-rater agreement, analysis of each ROI was performed twice for each participant; intra-class correlation coefficients exceeded 0.95 for all DTI metrics. Inter-rater agreement also exceeded 0.98 for measurement of each protocol by two raters and 10 participants per group.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic characteristics and variables related to mechanism of injury for the mTBI and OI groups were compared using univariate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) for continuous variables and \u03c7\n2\nfor categorical variables. Covariates were selected in preliminary analyses using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Age, sex, SES (as measured by the Socioeconomic Composite Index [SCI)], and all two way interactions with group (mTBI, OI, TD) were included in initial models. However, none of the two way interactions, sex, or SCI effects, reached statistical significance for any of the regions, and were trimmed from the models (\np\nvalues >0.010). Therefore, only age was included as a covariate in the final models. Preliminary analyses also indicated significant hemispheric differences in both DTI metrics (i.e., FA and MD) for many of the tracts (\np\nvalues <0.045). Therefore, left and right WM ROIs were analyzed separately.\nSeparate analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) (with covariate age) were used to examine differences between the groups (mTBI, OI, TD) on FA and MD measures of WM ROIs at the subacute (i.e., within 96\u2009h) as well as at the late (i.e., 3 months) post-injury assessment. These cross-sectional analyses were examined prior to the evaluation of any longitudinal effects so that the injury groups (i.e., OI and mTBI) could be compared with the TD group. Longitudinal changes in FA and MD between the mTBI and OI groups in each WM region were subsequently examined using separate 2 (occasion: subacute, late) x 2 (group: mTBI, OI) repeated measures ANCOVAs, with age as a covariate.\nPower of the current sample size for detecting small between-group effects was computed using G*Power 3.1 (hpower.hhu.de accessed February 18, 2018): power (1-\u00df)\u2009=\u20090.439 (critical\nF\n-value\u2009=\u20092.44) for detecting a small effect size (i.e.,\nf\n=\u20090.20) between the mTBI and OI groups (\nn\n=\u2009144, \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05, with 1 covariate); power (1-\u00df)\u2009=\u20090.554 (critical\nF\n-value\u2009=\u20092.83) for detecting a small effect size (i.e.,\nf\n=\u20090.20) between all three groups (\nn\n=\u2009180, \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05, with 1 covariate)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nExperiments were performed on 77 (29 TBI, 29 sham, 11 TBI + BCAA, and 8 sham + BCAA) 5- to 7-week-old (20\u201325\u2009g) male C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were maintained on a 12-h/12-h light-dark cycle, with light on at 7:00\nam\n, and all experiments were performed during the dark cycle. Mice had access\nad libitum\nto food and water. All experimental procedures and protocols for animal studies were approved by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accord with the international guidelines on the ethical use of animals (see Johnson and colleagues\n27\n; National Research Council, National Academy Press, Washington, DC, 1996). Experiments were designed to minimize the number of mice required.\n\nLateral fluid percussion injury\nOn day 1, all mice were anesthetized with ketamine (10\u2009mg/100\u2009g body weight; JHP Pharmaceuticals, Parsippany, NJ) and xylazine (1\u2009mg/100\u2009g body weight; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Phoenix, AZ) mixture and placed in a mouse stereotactic frame (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). The scalp was incised and reflected. The following was conducted under\u2009\u00d7\u20090.7\u20133.5 magnifications. A craniotomy was performed using a 3-mm trephine over the right parietal area between bregma and lambda, just medial to the sagittal suture and lateral to the lateral cranial ridge. The dura remained intact throughout the craniotomy procedure. A Luer Lock needle hub (3-mm inner diameter) was secured above the skull over the opening with Loctite adhesive and subsequently with cyanoacrylate plus dental acrylic. The Luer Lock needle hub was filled with isotonic sterile saline, and the hub was capped. Mice were then placed on a heating pad until spontaneously mobile and returned to the home cage. On day 2, mice were briefly placed under isoflurane anesthesia; the hub was filled with saline and connected by high-pressure tubing to the LFPI device (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA). Injury was induced by a brief pulse of saline onto the intact dura, which delivers a pressure of 1.5 atmospheres, generating a mild brain injury. Immediately post-injury, mice were reanesthetized with isoflurane for hub removal from the skull and scalp closure. Mice were warmed with an electric heating pad until they could move freely, before they were returned to their cages and fed with regular diet and tap water. Sham mice received all of the above procedures except the fluid pulse. Each mouse was allowed 6 days to recover before performing the behavioral task.\n\nObject spatial-location recognition task\nAll mice were handled for 5\u2009min each day for the duration of the experiment. Mice were tested on a memory task that assesses hippocampal-dependent memory for the locations of the objects.\n28\nAs schematically shown in\nFigure 1\n, after a period of 6 days from injury/sham procedure, mice were habituated to a square testing apparatus (30\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009cm) with visual cues present on the walls and no other objects in the environment for a 30-min period (habituation phase, H).\n29\nItems in the recording room were maintained constant across the experiment and served as distal cues. Each behavioral experiment consisted of two different phases\u2014familiarization (F) and test (T) with rest between them. Specifically, the familiarization phase was split into two subphases: familiarization 1 (F1) and familiarization 2 (F2). During F1, mice were allowed to explore the environment for a 10-min period with two identical novel objects located in two different quadrants of the apparatus. After F1, mice rested for 1\u2009h before F2 began. During F2, mice were re-exposed to the identical apparatus setting (the same novel objects in the same location) for another 10\u2009min. The next part of the experiment after familiarization was the test phase (T). Before the test phase (T), objects were removed and replaced with another pair. This new pair was indistinguishable from the first pair. In other words, the objects were physically different, but morphologically identical. One object was left in the previous location, and the other object was placed in a previously empty quadrant. The test phase lasted 5\u2009min, during which time mice explored the new apparatus setting. The test phase tested the ability to identify the new location in the already well-known environment. We restricted our analysis to the first 3\u2009min of the test phase to avoid the habituation phase.\n30\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nBehavioral task. The spatial object recognition task consists of three different phases interlaid by resting time. In the first phase (Habituation), animals explored an empty apparatus. In the second phase (Familiarization) animals were exposed to two identical objects (filled circles) with 1-h interphase rest. In the third phase (Test), one object was displayed to a previous empty quadrant and the animal entered the field from a different starting point. Between familiarization 2 and test, the delay interval was randomly chosen between 3\u2009min, 1\u2009h, and 24\u2009h. Each animal performed the task with one delay time.\nOne goal of this experiment was to explore how memory performance changes across time. To accomplish this, we varied the time between familiarization (F) and test (T). Specifically, we used three different delay times between familiarization (F) and test (T): 3\u2009min (sham 10, TBI 10), 1\u2009h (sham 10, TBI 10), and 24\u2009h (sham 9, TBI 9). Mice were randomly assigned to each of these groups. All analyses were made with experimenters blinded to both experimental conditions: 1) injury versus sham and 2) the delay time between familiarization and test.\n\nTreatment\nIn order to test the efficacy of our BCAA therapy on memory task performance, an additional group of mice (11 TBI, 8 sham) were treated with BCAA dietary therapy. Specifically, drinking water was supplemented with 100\u2009mM of leucine, isoleucine, and valine amino acids and consumed\nad libitum\n. Mice started the treatment 48\u2009h after injury and continued until the test phase of the task. The rationale for initiating treatment after 48\u2009h was that previous evidence has demonstrated that it was effective.\n24\n,\n25\nAs described above, mice were allowed to recover for 6 days, and then behavior testing was performed with a 1-h delay between familiarization and test.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData collection and analysis were performed blinded to the experimental group. Statistical analyses were performed using custom software written in Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA).\nWe quantified exploratory behavior as the time the mouse spent with its nose directed toward any object within a distance of <2\u2009cm. Of note, other behaviors, such as sitting on top of the object and looking around while sitting or resting against the object, were not considered exploratory behavior.\n29\nAny mouse with less than 15\u2009sec of exploratory behavior during familiarization, or with less than 10\u2009sec of exploratory behavior during the test, was excluded from all analyses and not included in this article. Novelty preference was quantified with the discrimination index (DI), which was defined as the absolute difference in time spent exploring the novel and the familiar object divided by the total time spent exploring both objects. A preference score of 1 indicated that mice explored only the object in the new location, a score of 0 denoted no preference or equal time exploring the object in the new and old location, and a score of \u22121 indicated that mice explored only the object in the familiar location.\nWe found the DI for each mouse during the three testing intervals: 3\u2009min, 1\u2009h, and 24\u2009h. In addition, we also calculated the percentage of time during F1, F2, and T that each mouse spent in exploratory behavior (EB). We also calculated the EB values across time during F1 and F2. Specifically, we segmented the F1/F2 into 90-sec sliding windows with 15-sec increments (80% overlap). We found the percentage of time in EB in each time window, and compared these values across time for sham and TBI. We also ran an identical analysis with 200-sec, nonoverlapping windows during F1/F2.\nFor the statistical approach, we used an unpaired\nt\n-test to compare TBI and sham DI values for all time delays between the familiarization and the test phase. For the unpaired\nt\n-test, the null hypothesis is that the TBI and sham DI values are drawn from the same distribution with identical mean and standard deviation (SD). In general, we used unpaired\nt\n-tests when comparing DI or EB values between TBI and sham groups because the number and SD of the DI/EB values in TBI and sham conditions were not identical. We also used paired\nt\n-tests when determining whether a within-group, single distribution of DI values (TBI or sham) showed any location preference. We performed this test because the expected value of DI is zero under the null hypothesis that the animal is unable to discriminate new and old spatial locations (chance performance). Thus, two-tailed, paired\nt\n-tests were used to compare within-group distributions of DI against the chance value of zero (\nFigs. 2\n,\n\u200b\n,3,\n3\n, and\n\u200b\nand4B),\n4B\n), similar to the approach used by others in the field.\n46\nFinally, we also used a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to investigate whether there was an effect of experimental conditions as well as time on EB values (\nFigs. 3\nand\n\u200b\nand4A).\n4A\n). The ANOVA allowed us to test both the main effects of time and experimental condition on EB values, as well as the interaction of these two factors. Of note, post-hoc\nt\n-tests were done to compare the effects across conditions, and a significance value of 0.05 was used. Again, post-hoc unpaired\nt\n-tests were used to compare across sham and TBI conditions for both EB and DI values, and paired\nt\n-tests were used to compare with group DI values against a chance value of zero.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nMemory retrieval: Novelty preference during test phase. Novelty preference was assessed in sham and TBI condition during the test performance after 3\u2009min, 1\u2009h, and 24\u2009h. There was no difference in performance between TBI and sham animals when discrimination was tested after 3-min delay. However, after 1\u2009h, mice in the TBI condition had a decrease in performance compared to sham mice (**\np\n<\u20090.05). Both conditions were not able to discriminate after 24\u2009h.

Colored lines in each row represent time windows in which the mouse was interacting with the objects (see\nMethods\n). Light colors and dark colors represent one of object 1 and object 2, respectively. (\nB\n) Data in (A) were segmented into thirty-four 90-sec time windows incremented by 15-sec intervals (80% overlap). The percentage of time spent interacting (\npercent interaction\n) with the objects was recorded for each animal for each time window. The percentage interaction was then averaged across animals separately for TBI (red line) and sham (blue line) animals. Error bars represent SEM. (\nC\n) To statistically analyze the data, we simplified the time periods in to three nonoverlapping windows of 200-sec duration. Percent interaction was calculated in each time window for all animals, and a two-way ANOVA was performed with time and condition as factors. There was a main effect across time (\np\n<\u20090.001) and an interaction effect between time and condition (\np\n<\u20090.05) that was driven by an increase in exploration time for sham mice in the first time window (asterisk plot, on post-hoc\nt\n-test, T\n(56)\n=\u2009\u22122.25;\np\n<\u20090.03).

    "Methods": "Participants\nA total of 42 patients were recruited from the emergency department of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (Lebanon, NH), a level 1 trauma center. The mTBI group included 19 patients (11 females, 8 males) with recent autopedestrian accidents. Cases of moderate-to-severe TBI with positive clinical imaging findings (e.g., significant impact-site lesions and hemorrhage) were excluded from this study. In addition, an \u201cother injury\u201d control group consisting of 23 trauma control patients (11 females, 12 males) was also studied. Inclusion criteria for the mTBI group followed the guidelines of the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine,\n71\nincluding an alteration in level of consciousness subsequent to a force acting on the head, a Glasgow Coma Score of 13\u201315, loss of consciousness <30\u2009min, and post-traumatic amnesia <24\u2009h. For the trauma control group, individuals with orthopedic injuries, but without injury involving the head, were screened for recruitment.

RPQ scores included RPQ-3 (i.e., the sum of the first three items), RPQ-13 (i.e., the sum of the items 4\u201316), and RPQ-TOT (i.e., the sum of all items). Clinical assessments were performed on the same day of the imaging study. Details of the 10 neuropsychological measures and two mood measures and their abbreviations are listed in\nTable 1\n.

Anatomical imaging included conventional whole-brain T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. These anatomical images were read by board-certified neuroradiologists to detect abnormal findings. HYDI was performed on a 3.0-T Philips Achieva TX scanner with an eight-channel head coil and sensitivity encoding parallel imaging (\nR\n=\u20092). Similar to a previous work,\n53\nthe HYDI encoding scheme contained one zero diffusion-weighting (b-value\u2009=\u20090\u2009s/mm\n2\n, b\n0\n) and five concentric diffusion-weighting shells (b-values\u2009=\u2009250, 1000, 2250, 4000, and 6250\u2009s/mm\n2\n). A total of 142 diffusion-weighting gradient directions (6, 21, 24, 30, and 61 in each shell) were encoded. The diffusion-weighted pulse sequence was a single-shot, spin-echo, echo-planar imaging. MRI parameters used were as follows: repetition time\u2009=\u20093.59 ses, echo time\u2009=\u2009114.24\u2009ms, field of view\u2009=\u2009224\u2009\u00d7\u2009224\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u2009128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128, voxel size\u2009=\u20091.75\u2009\u00d7\u20091.75\u2009mm\n2\n, 40 slices with slice thickness\u2009=\u20093\u2009mm, and a total scan time of 24\u2009min. If using a simultaneous multi-slice technique (also called multi-band)\n77\nas in our other studies,\n78\nthe scan time could reduce to approximately 7\u2009min. Diffusion parameters comprised a maximum b-value of 6250\u2009s/mm\n2\n, a diffusion gradient duration \u03b4 of 46\u2009ms, and a diffusion gradient separation \u0394 of 58.4\u2009ms.\n\nImage processing\nImage processing included an initial pre-processing and diffusion metrics computation. The diffusion-weighted images were first denoised using a local principle component analysis (LPCA) approach provided in the toolbox developed by Manjon and colleagues.\n79\nWith the b\n0\nimages as reference, the diffusion-weighted images were then corrected for motion, eddy current artifacts, and geometrical distortion using the\neddy\ncommand provided in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL).\n80\nUsing an in-house MATLAB script (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA), the transformation matrices output from the\neddy\ncommand were used to rotate the corresponding diffusion-weighting directions to match the rotation of the brain image during the motion correction process. After image pre-processing, seven diffusion metrics were computed from the HYDI data set. Diffusion metrics of DTI were computed similarly to a previous work\n81\nfrom the inner two shells of the HYDI data using the FSL\ndtifit\ncommand and included FA, AD, RD, and mean diffusivity (MD). NODDI metrics included the axonal density metric (intra-axonal volume fraction; V\nic\n) and orientation dispersion (OD) index, which were computed according to the three-compartment model described in previous works\n54\n,\n82\nusing a MATLAB toolbox provided in\nhttps://www.nitrc.org/projects/noddi_toolbox/\n. The HYDI q-space analysis used in-house MATLAB scripts (The MathWorks, Inc.)\n69\nto produce a diffusion metric, zero displacement probability (P\n0\n), which describes restricted diffusion.\n53\n,\n64\nThe restricted diffusion index, P\n0\n, may infer cellularity of the tissue.\n61\n,\n83\nMaps of the diffusion metrics were nonlinearly transformed to standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs) registration.\n84\n\nTract-based spatial statistics analysis\nTo minimize partial volume effects in finite imaging resolution, in the standard MNI space, a common whole-brain while matter skeleton was extracted using the FSL toolbox, TBSS.\n85\nThe white matter skeleton included only voxels in the center of white matter tracts and excluded edge voxels, which may be contaminated with signals from the nearby anatomy. Within the white matter skeleton, nonparametric permutation-based statistics utilized in TBSS (i.e., the\nrandomise\ncommand) was used for voxel-wise statistical analyses in which general linear models controlling for participants' sex, age, and intellectual ability (i.e., WRAT4) were tested. A threshold-free cluster enhancement\n86\nand 5000 permutations to obtain a corrected\np\nvalue\n87\nwere utilized in this study. White matter voxels were deemed significant as a corrected\np\nvalue <0.05 after being adjusted for multiple comparisons by controlling family-wise error rate. Using TBSS, we tested: 1) between-group differences in the diffusion metrics; 2) within-group correlations between the diffusion metrics and neuropsychological measures to explore how sensitive the diffusion metrics are to each neuropsychological outcome; and 3) how mTBI moderates the correlations, that is, the interaction of the group membership and the relationship between the neuropsychological measures and diffusion metrics in general linear regression analyses.\n\nPost-hoc region-of-interest analysis\nTo produce aggregate results at the subject level, post-hoc region-of-interest (ROI) analyses were performed. For each subject, the mean of each diffusion metric was computed in an ROI comprising white matter voxels that were tested significant in TBSS. For between-group differences, a box plot was used with subjects' means plotted according to their group membership. For within-group correlations, a scatter plot was used with subjects' means plotted against their neuropsychological outcome measures. Further, post-hoc regression analyses allow us to retrieve correlation coefficients (\u03c1) at the ROI level. In addition, to compare across the diffusion metrics, the total numbers of voxels that were significant in the TBSS regression analysis of within-group correlations and group interactions were summarized in a matrix format for each diffusion-neuropsychological pair. The anatomical interpretation of ROI was based on the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) white matter atlas provided in FSL\n88\nafter skeletonization (\nFig. 1\n). In particular, the TBSS-significant ROIs were intersected with the JHU 48 white matter labels and the voxels counts were summarized in a color-coded matrix.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSkeletonized Johns Hopkins University (JHU) white matter atlas and their acronyms.

Between-group differences in diffusion metrics, within-group correlation, and interaction effects of mTBI were analyzed by regression analyses of general linear models controlling for participants' sex, age, and estimated intellectual ability (i.e., WRAT4)."

Food intake and body weight were monitored daily. All animal procedures were carried out under a Project Licence approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body, at Queen Mary University of London and the UK Home Office, in accord with the EU Directive 2010/63/EU.\n\nControlled cortical impact model\nA CCI TBI model was used.\n41\nAfter a 1-week acclimatization period, mice were anesthetized using ketamine (50\u2009mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.5\u2009mg/kg), administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). Mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame and a midline longitudinal incision was performed to expose the skull. A right lateral craniotomy was carried out using a pneumatic drill, 2.0\u2009mm behind bregma, and 2.5\u2009mm lateral to the midline. CCI injury was induced using the following settings: a 3-mm impactor tip with a speed of 3\u2009m/s, a depth of 2.2\u2009mm, and a dwell time of 100\u2009ms, applied using the PCI3000 Precision Cortical Impactor\u2122 (Hatteras Instruments, Inc., Cary, NC). A control group underwent craniotomy only. Post-injury, the skull flap was placed back and the skin was sutured. Mice were allowed to recover in an incubator (37\u00b0C) until they were fully awake and active. Buprenorphine (0.05\u2009mg/kg), administered subcutaneously, was used pre-operatively for pre-emptive analgesia and post-operatively every 12\u2009h for 3 days post-TBI.\n\nDietary supplementation\nPost-CCI, mice were randomized into two groups and fed with a control diet (CCI-Control;\nn\n=\u200910) or with a FC multi-nutrient diet (CCI-FC;\nn\n=\u200910) for 70 days (detailed composition in\nTable 1\n). The craniotomy group were fed with control diet (craniotomy;\nn\n=\u200910), and there was no craniotomy-FC group, because the emphasis of the study was on the brain injury component. The choice of the dose used in this study was based on a previous study carried out in our group, in which we tested several dose levels.\n42\nThe diets were formulated by Nutricia Research (Utrecht, The Netherlands) and manufactured by Ssniff (Soest, Germany), stored at \u221220\u00b0C to prevent lipid peroxidation, and fresh diet was given daily. Diet stability under these conditions has been confirmed by the producers of the diet. No significant differences were observed in the daily food intake and body weight (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n) between groups.\nTable 1.\nCompositions of the Experimental Diets (g/100 g)\nIngredient\nControl\nFC\nCorn starch\n35.57\n31.31\nCaseine (>85% protein)\n14.00\n14.00\nCorn dextrine\n15.50\n15.50\nSucrose\n10.00\n10.00\nDextrose\n10.00\n10.00\nFiber\n5.00\n5.00\nMineral mix (AIN-93M-MX)\n3.50\n3.50\nVitamin mix (AIN-93-VX)\n1.00\n1.00\nCholine bitartrate (41.1% choline)\n0.250\n0.250\nl\n-cystine\n0.180\n0.180\nTert-butylhydroquinone\n0.0008\n0.0008\nOil blends\nSoy oil\n1.900\n\u2014\nCoconut oil\n0.900\n0.100\nCorn oil\n2.200\n0.100\nDHA25 oil\n\u2014\n4.500\nEPA28/12\n\u2014\n0.300\nOther additions\nPyridoxine-HCL\n\u2014\n0.00529\nFolic acid (90%)\n\u2014\n0.00111\nCyanocobalamin (0.1% in mannitol)\n\u2014\n0.00650\nAscorbic acid (100% pure)\n\u2014\n0.24000\ndl-\u03b1-tocopheryl acetate (500\u2009IU/g)\n\u2014\n0.70500\nUMP disodium (24% H\n2\nO)\n\u2014\n1.50000\nCholine chloride (74.576%)\n\u2014\n0.67046\nSoy lecithine (Emulpur)\n\u2014\n1.13205\nTotal phospholipids\n(\u2014)\n(0.8717)\nPhosphatidylcholine\n(\u2014)\n(0.2264)\nPhosphatidylinositol\n(\u2014)\n(0.1585)\nPhosphatidylethanolamine\n(\u2014)\n(0.1472)\nSodium selenite (46% min)\n\u2014\n0.00036\nTotal\n100.0\n100.0\nOpen in a separate window\nFatty acid profile\nControl\nFC\nC-4:0\n0.000\n0.000\nC-6:0\n0.004\n0.001\nC-8:0\n0.064\n0.007\nC-10:0\n0.052\n0.006\nC-12:0\n0.395\n0.046\nC-14:0\n0.155\n0.191\nC-14:1 n5\n0.000\n0.000\nC-15:0\n0.000\n0.035\nC-16:0\n0.492\n0.795\nC-16:1 n7\n0.004\n0.251\nC-17:0\n0.000\n0.042\nC-18:0\n0.136\n0.222\nC-18:1 n9\n1.041\n0.656\nC-18:2 n6\n2.181\n0.158\nC-18:3 n3\n0.107\n0.038\nC-18:3 n6\n0.000\n0.006\nC-18:4 n3\n0.000\n0.001\nC-20:0\n0.020\n0.018\nC-20:1 n9\n0.010\n0.097\nC-20:2 n6\n0.000\n0.035\nC-20:3 n6\n0.000\n0.008\nC-20:4 n3\n0.000\n0.000\nC-20:4 n6\n0.000\n0.092\nC-20:5 n3\n0.000\n0.433\nC-22:0\n0.009\n0.011\nC-22:1 n9\n0.000\n0.012\nC-22:4 n6\n0.000\n0.017\nC-22:5 n3\n0.000\n0.074\nC-22:6 n3\n0.000\n1.117\nC-24:0\n0.000\n0.008\nC-24:1 n9\n0.000\n0.014\nTotal FA\n4.771\n4.771\nSAT FA\n1.327\n1.382\nMUFA\n1.055\n1.030\nPUFA\n2.288\n1.979\nOther FA\n0.101\n0.379\nMCT\n0.515\n0.060\nTot n6\n2.181\n0.316\nTot n3\n0.107\n1.663\nn6/n3\n20.298\n0.190\nOpen in a separate window\nUMP, uridine monophosphate; FC, Fortasyn\u00ae Connect; FA, fatty acid; SAT FA, saturated fatty acid; MUFA, monounsaturated fatty acid; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; MCT, medium-chain triglyceride.\n\nExperimental design and behavioral testing\nTesting at various days post-injury (dpi) is summarized in\nFigure 1\n. Sample size was calculated using power analysis (\nhttps://eda.nc3rs.org.uk/eda/\n) for pair-wise post-hoc comparisons after analysis of variance (ANOVA), to a statistical power of 90%, with a significance level \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05 to detect a 25% and 20% relative difference in sensorimotor behavioral scoring (Modified Neurological Severity Score; mNSS), lesion size, and histopathology (glial responses, cell proliferation, and white matter), as experimental primary and secondary outcomes. All the behavior (the primary study endpoint) was assessed in \u201cblind,\u201d with the researcher unaware of the treatment, in accord with ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental design. Behavioral testing was performed for 70 days post-injury (dpi). A controlled cortical impact (CCI) or a control craniotomy (sham injury) were induced in adult male mice. Animals were divided into three experimental groups (craniotomy-control, CCI-Control, and CCI-FC). All mice were tested for motor and cognitive impairments on all behavioral tests. Mice were trained for 3 consecutive days for the Rotarod test pre-injury. Throughout the study (1\u201370\u2009dpi), mice were tested for mNSS every other day on the first week and once a week thereafter, Rotarod (1\u20133\u2009dpi), CatWalk (2\u2009dpi), MWM (13\u201318\u2009dpi), novel object recognition (NOR; 22\u201326\u2009dpi), and elevated zero maze (EZM; 45\u2009dpi). A week before the end of the study mice were injected twice a day with BrdU. Mice were monitored daily for weight and food consumption. On 70\u2009dpi, mice underwent perfusion for immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis or were decapitated and brains were quickly removed and snap frozen for western blot (WB) analysis. Seventy-day plasma and cerebellar tissue samples were used for lipid analysis. BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine; FC, Fortasyn\n\u00ae\nConnect; MWM, Morris water maze; mNSS, Modified Neurological Severity Score; TBI, traumatic brain injury.\n\nModified Neurological Severity Score\nThe mNSS was used to evaluate motor ability, balance, and alertness, using a scoring system based on the ability to perform 10 tasks that evaluate motor ability, balance, and alertness (\nSupplementary Fig. 2\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). During the first week, testing was performed every other day, then once a week, until the end of experiment. A point was given for failure to perform a task. Tissue pathology correlates well with impairment scores and with degree of brain edema.\n43\n,\n44\nThe first mNSS was obtained 24\u2009h post-TBI.\n\nRotarod\nThe Rotarod test (Ugo Basile SRL, Gemonio, Italy; 3\u2009cm in diameter) was used for the evaluation of motor coordination and balance and was carried out between days 1 and 3 post-CCI. Pre-surgery, mice were trained on the Rotarod for 3 consecutive days. The first two trials were 60\u2009sec each, at a speed of 3\u2009rpm, followed by a single trial at accelerating speed (3\u201320\u2009rpm over 300\u2009sec), with intervals of at least 25\u2009min of rest. The rest of the training days consisted of one trial at a constant speed of 3\u2009rpm followed by two accelerating trials. The latency to fall from the Rotarod was recorded. The average of all accelerating phase scores was considered as the baseline (pre-injury score). Mice were tested during days 1\u20133 post-injury, in three trials a day, using the accelerating mode.\n\nCatWalk\nThe CatWalk is a system for a quantitative automated assessment of gait. It consists of an enclosed walkway, a camera, and recording and analysis software (Noldus/Tracksys Ltd, Nottingham, UK; RRID:SCR_004074). Dynamic gait parameters were analyzed on day 2 post-CCI. Each mouse was placed individually in the walkway, which consists of a glass plate (100\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009\u00d7\u20090.6\u2009cm) surrounded by two black Plexiglas walls, spaced 8\u2009cm apart. The mouse was allowed to walk freely and traverse from one side to the other of the walkway. Two infrared beams spaced 90\u2009cm apart were used to detect the arrival of the mouse and control the start and end of data acquisition. Recordings were carried out in a dark room. After each trial, the walkway was cleaned with 1% acetic acid for odor neutralization. CatWalk XT 7.0 software (Noldus) was used to analyze the data.\n\nMorris water maze\nThe Morris water maze test (MWM) was used to assess memory deficits associated with spatial learning\n45\nbetween days 13 and 18 post-CCI. A 100-cm-diameter pool filled with opaque water at 23\u00b0C was placed inside a white tent, ensuring light uniformity, with four visible cues hung 10\u2009cm from the pool walls and an 11-cm diameter Plexiglas resting platform submerged 0.5\u2009cm below the water level. Swimming performance (e.g., path, distance, speed, and latency) was tracked using software (ANY-maze, Smart; Bioseb, Vitrolles, France; RRID:SCR_014289). A learning period of 5 consecutive days (days 13\u201317 post-injury) and a probe trial on day 6 (day 18 post-injury) were used. During the learning period, each mouse was subjected to four trials a day, in the pool divided into four virtual quadrants. The position of the platform was constant throughout the training session, whereas the starting position on each of the four training trials was changed. If a mouse did not find the platform within 60\u2009sec, it was guided to it. After reaching the platform, mice were allowed to stay there for 15\u2009sec. During the probe trial, mice were allowed to swim for 60\u2009sec in the absence of the platform, and the time it took to first enter the quadrant that had previously hosted the platform, was measured.\n\nNovel Object Recognition\nThe novel object recognition (NOR) test was used to evaluate recognition memory on day 26 post-CCI. In the habituation phase, on days 22\u201325 post-injury, animals were exposed to an empty opaque box used as an open field, for 10\u2009min. Twenty-four hours later, in a familiarization phase, each animal was given 20\u2009min to explore two identical objects, placed in the same open field. Four hours later, in the second test phase, animals were exposed to two dissimilar objects placed in the same open field: one familiar object used in the first phase and one novel object. In the test phase, exploration time was 10\u2009min and time spent exploring each of the objects was measured. Performance was tracked with software (ANY-maze, Smart; Bioseb). A recognition index (RI), that is, the time spent investigating the novel object relative to the total object investigation, was calculated as follows: percentage time spent with novel object/time spent with novel and familiar objects. Mice that discriminate between the old and new object should have an RI above 50%.\n46\n\nElevated zero maze\nAn elevated zero maze test (EZM) was used to assess exploratory behavior in an anxiety-provoking environment. Anxiety is expressed by spending more time in the enclosed quadrants. On day 45 after CCI or craniotomy, mice were individually placed in a closed quadrant and allowed to freely explore the maze for 5\u2009min. A camera tracked the animal, and ANY-maze software calculated the time spent in the open quadrants, the head dips (downward movement of the head toward the floor) and stretch-attenuated postures (elongation of the body with the feet remaining in place) from the closed arms, and the total distance travelled during the test.\n\nBromodeoxyuridine injections\nFrom day 63 post-injury or craniotomy, and for 7 sequential days, animals received i.p. injections of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 50\u2009mg/kg, twice a day), to assess cell proliferation.\n\nHistology and immunohistochemistry\nAt day 70 post-TBI, 5 animals from each group were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50\u2009mg/kg, i.p.; Sagatal; Rh\u00f4ne-M\u00e9rieux, Harlow, UK) and received a transcardiac perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.01\u2009M, pH 7.4), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (0.1\u2009M, pH 7.4, 4\u00b0C). Brains were dissected out and tissue blocks were paraffin-fixed for histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses. All tissue staining was performed between bregma \u22121.28 and bregma \u22122.34, where the lesion was located. All tissue analyses were carried out in \u201cblind\u201d with the researcher unaware of the treatment, in accord with ARRIVE guidelines. Sections (7-\u03bcm) were deparaffinized and hydrated through xylene and ethanol baths. Sections were subjected to antigen retrieval (10\u2009mM of citrate buffer, pH 6.0, 30\u2009min at 80\u00b0C) and then cooled at room temperature. Tissue was blocked with 5% normal donkey serum in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for an hour, followed by three PBS washes. The following primary antibodies were used (overnight incubation): rat anti-BrdU (for cell proliferation; 1:200; Acris Antibodies GmbH, Herford, Germany; Cat# SM1667PS Lot# RRID:AB_973414); rabbit anti\u2013glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; for astrocytes; 1:800; Dako, Carpinteria, CA; Cat# Z0334 Lot# RRID:AB_10013382); goat anti\u2013ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1; for microglia; 1:800; Wako Chemicals USA, Inc., Richmond, VA; Cat# 019-19741 Lot# RRID:AB_839504) and rabbit anti\u2013translocator protein (TSPO; for glial activation following central nervous system injury and inflammation; 1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, MA; Cat# ab109497 Lot# RRID:AB_10862345); mouse anti\u2013adenomatous polyposis coli (APC; for oligodendroglia; 1:50; Millipore, Billerica, MA; Cat# OP80 Lot# RRID:AB_2057371); rabbit anti\u2013cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175; for apoptosis; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA; Cat# 9661 also NYUIHC-314, 9661S, 9661L Lot# RRID:AB_2341188); and antidoublecortin (DCX; for immature neurons; 1:100 Millipore; Cat# AB2253 RRID:AB_1586992). The secondary antibodies were Alexa 488 or Alexa 555 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands; 1:200), and Hoechst 33342 stain (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK; 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL of PBS) was used to visualize nuclei. Slides were mounted and cover-slipped using Vectashield fluorescent mounting medium (H-1000; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). A subset of representative randomly selected sections across the whole lesion was used for Luxol fast blue (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) myelin staining.\nFor calculation of lesion size, sections of 7\u2009\u03bcm, 200\u2009\u03bcm apart, and spanning the entire rostrocaudal extent of the injured cortex were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Lesion size was measured with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda, MD) and calculated using the equation: the contralateral (nonlesioned) hemisphere size minus the injured hemisphere size and divided by the contralateral hemisphere size.\n47\nResults are expressed as a percentage of hemispheric tissue.\n\nImage capture analysis and processing\nFour sections per animal were stained, per antibody. At least 24 fields were captured perilesionally (immediate area around the lesion, except for DCX, which was used to assess the differences in the contralateral hippocampus). Images were viewed at\u2009\u00d7\u200940 and photographed using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a Hamamatsu camera (C4742-95; Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Hamamatsu City, Japan). All image capture and quantification were performed blinded. Analyses were done using the ImageJ program and a dedicated script (JVP AutoColourCellCountsRev). Fluorescent signals under different excitation lasers were selected by thresholding and then superimposed on nuclei, for colocalization. A Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope was used for further characterization (ZENlite software; Zeiss, Cambridge, UK). Figures were prepared using Illustrator software (Adobe Illustrator CS6; Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA; RRID:SCR_014198). For quantification of microglia morphology, we measured cell size with ImageJ (ImageJ 1.50i; NIH), for a minimum of 20 cells per animal, and 5 animals per group.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nTissue from 5 animals from each group (CCI or craniotomy) was used. At day 70 post-TBI, animals from each group were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50\u2009mg/kg, i.p.; Sagatal; Rh\u00f4ne-M\u00e9rieux), and they were decapitated. Brains were removed, and a cube of the right hemisphere around the lesion was dissected using a brain matrix. Tissue was snap-frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Samples were prepared in radioimunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) complete with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) and sonicated, then centrifuged (10,000\ng\n, 10\u2009min, 4\u00b0C), and the supernatant was taken. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein (50\u2009\u03bcg) were mixed with NuPAGE\n\u00ae\nLDS sample buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and dithiothreitol and boiled (95\u00b0C, 10\u2009min), then separated using Mini-Protean TGX Gels, 10% (Bio-Rad, Watford, UK), and electro-transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (BioTrace Medical Inc, Menlo Park, CA). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.4), with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS/Tween) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. The primary antibodies used were: mouse anti\u2013myelin basic protein (MBP; 1:1,000; myelin marker, Abcam; Cat# ab62631 Lot# RRID:AB_956157); mouse anti\u2013beta-amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2-APP; 1:500; amyloid peptide marker, Abcam; Cat# ab11132 Lot# RRID:AB_297770); rabbit anti-Nogo-A (1:500; myelin-derived neurite growth inhibitor, Abcam; Cat# ab62024 Lot# RRID:AB_956171); mouse anti\u2013post-synaptic density 95 (PSD-95; 1:500; post-synaptic density protein, Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA; Cat# MAB1596 Lot# RRID:AB_2092365); and rabbit anti-synaptophysin (1:1000; presynaptic protein, Cell Signaling Technology; Cat# 5461S Lot# RRID:AB_10698743), all diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin solution, and membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The primary antibody was removed and the blots were washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)/Tween and incubated (1\u2009h, room temperature) in horseradish-peroxidase\u2013conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, West Grove, PA; Cat# 323-005-021 Lot# RRID:AB_2314648). Reactive proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (VWR International, Franklin, MA). Optical density was determined using ImageJ software (NIH, RRID:SCR_003070). All membranes were also incubated with a mouse polyclonal antibody for \u03b2-actin (1:4,000; Sigma-Aldrich; Cat# A5316 Lot# RRID:AB_476743). Protein level was expressed as relative optical density, that is, the optical density of the band revealed by the primary antibody, divided by the optical density of \u03b2-actin in the same lane.\n\nPhospholipid fatty acid analysis\nPL fatty acid content of plasma was determined as described.\n48\nLipids were extracted using the method of Folch and colleagues,\n49\nwith 0.01% (w/v) 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol (butylated hydroxytoluene) added as antioxidant. Total PLs were isolated by thin-layer chromatography, and the PL fatty acid composition was measured after transesterification with 14% boron trifluoride in methanol. Fatty acids were identified by gas chromatography with a flame ionisation detector (Agilent 7820A; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) using an Omegawax\n\u00ae\ncapillary column (15\u2009m\u2009\u00d7\u20090.10\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20090.10\u2009\u03bcm). Identity was confirmed by retention times compared to standards, and quantification was performed on peak areas with ChemStation software (Agilent Technologies). Corrections were made for variations in detector response, and values of fatty acids were normalized to 100% and expressed as wt %.\nPL content of the cerebellum was measured as previously described.\n50\nNeutral and acidic PLs were isolated from a total lipid extract by solid-phase extraction using Isolute\n\u00ae\nbonded phase aminopropyl columns (Kinesis Health Technologies, Dublin, UK). The neutral PL extract was separated into PC and PE by thin-layer chromatography and the phosphate content measured. The results were normalized to 100-mg wet tissue weight.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were done out using GraphPad Prism software (version 5; RRID:SCR_002798; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). Groups were compared using one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by different post-hoc tests for multiple comparisons, and significance level set at\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Experiments were performed and animals were treated humanely according to ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines. All procedures were performed in accord with the NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and followed protocols approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice had access to food and waterad libitumand were housed on a 12-h day-night cycle in laminar flow racks in a temperature-controlled room (25\u00b0C). Mice were randomized to sham and injury groups except for sham-injured CCI mice that were done as groups separate from CCI mice. Investigators blinded to study groups performed brain injury models and all behavioral experiments. Behavior testing was performed during the same time of day (7:00 am to 11:30 am) to ensure consistent results.\n\nExperimental animals\nStudies were performed using adult, 3- to 6-month-old male IL-1 receptor 1 knockout (IL-1R1 KO) mice (B6.129S7-\nIl1r1\ntm1Imx\n; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) and the appropriate age-matched wild-type (WT) controls (C57/BL6J, stock #000664; The Jackson Laboratory). For biomechanical assessments, C57Bl/6N mice (stock #027; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, DE) were used.\n\nClosed head injury\nA modified CHI model was used as previously described.\n12\nMice were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflourane in 70% N\n2\nO and 30% O\n2\nfor 90\u2009sec. Anesthetized mice were placed on a custom wooden support holder and the head rested on a taught KimWipe napkin. The brass guide tube was 60 inches long and nine-sixteenths of an inch in diameter. A half-inch diameter, 81-g lead cylindrical weight with a flat, unbuffered surface was dropped onto the vertex of the head between the ears. After impact mice were placed supine, and loss of consciousness (LOC) time was recorded as time to righting reflex. Sham-injured mice received anesthesia but no injury.\n\nControlled cortical impact\nA CCI model was used as described previously,\n13\nwith velocity 6\u2009m/sec, depth 0.6\u2009mm, and duration 100\u2009ms.\n\nBiomechanics of closed head injury\nBiomechanical measurements of CHI were made in 3-month-old male mice (\nn\n=\u20097). Immediately preceding CHI, an 0.8-g triaxial accelerometer (3133A1; Dytran Instruments, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) with sensitivity of 10\u2009mV/g was taped to the ventral jaw of the anesthetized mouse. The lead of the accelerometer was taped along the mouse's body to prevent tugging on the lead at the time of impact. Data were acquired at a rate of 20\u2009kHz (USB-4432; National Instruments, Woburn, MA) during CHI. Linear acceleration was quantified as the magnitude of the three-dimensional acceleration vector. The corresponding rotational acceleration was obtained by dividing linear acceleration by the radius of rotation\u2014measured for each mouse as the distance between the center of the skull and the point located midway between the cervical axis and the scapula. Impact time was defined as the duration between the time at which acceleration increased above 10\ng\n(ignoring <10\ng\nnoise) to the first local minimum below 200\ng\nafter the peak acceleration. To compare to published thresholds for injury in humans with concussion syndrome, we assumed thathuman and mouse brains have equal stiffness, and that equal strains are required in both brains to achieve the same injury. A characteristic mass scaling ratio,\n, was used to convert measured values to equivalent scaled human values,\n14\n,\n15\nassuming an average human adult male brain mass of 1336\u2009g.\n\nGenotyping of mutant mice\nMice were genotyped according to protocols published by The Jackson Laboratory. Primers used for IL-1R1 mice are as follows \u2013 Mutant Forward: CTCGTGCTTTACGGTATCGC, Wild Type Forward: GGTGCAACTTCATAGAGAGATGA, Common: TTCTGTGCATGCTGGAAAAC.\n\nPreparation of brain tissue for TUNEL, Fluoro Jade B, and immunoglobulin G histochemistry\nMice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. Brains were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen before making coronal sections (14\u2009\u03bcm) on a poly-\u03b9-lysine-coated slide (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) using cryostat. Brains were cut at 0.5-mm intervals from the anterior to the posterior of the brain. For analyses using paraformaldehyde (PFA)-fixed tissue, mice were transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% PFA and brains were post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight, frozen at \u221280\u00b0C, and cut on a cryostat as above. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) was performed on frozen sections and Fluoro Jade B (FJB; EMD Millipore, Burlington, MA) on fixed brain sections according to the manufacturer's instructions. BBB damage was assessed by immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunohistochemistry (rabbit antimouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 488, 1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). IgG\n+\nbrain regions were assessed qualitatively by comparing to corresponding brain regions of sham-injured mice.\n\nQuantitative assessment of cell counts\nTUNEL\n+\n, FJB\n+\n, propidium iodide (PI)\n+\n, CD45\n+\n, and degenerating (hematoxylin and eosin; H&E) cell counts were performed in fields randomly chosen from cortex, hippocampus, or striatum in five brain sections spanning anterior to posterior brain. A total of six fields per section were counted for cortex, two to four fields per section for hippocampus, and two to four fields per section for striatum in each hemisphere.\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed using the Mouse IL-1\u03b2 Quantikine Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), according to manufacturer's protocol.\n\nWestern blot\nBrain tissues were prepared for western blot as previously described.\n16\nAfter blocking in 5% bovine serum albumin for 1\u2009h, membranes were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight in primary antibodies (rabbit antimouse Il-1\u03b2, 1:1000 [Abcam, Cambridge, MA] and rabbit antimouse HMGB1 [high mobility group box 1; 1:1000; Abcam]). Horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) was used for enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Results were normalized to \u03b2-actin (1:5000; Cell Signaling Technology). Densitometry was performed using image analysis (ImageJ; NIH, Bethesda, MD).\n\nAssessment of brain edema\nBrain edema was assessed by the wet-dry/wet weight method. Bisected brains from CCI mice were weighed on a pre-weighed weigh boat and then dried at 80\u00b0C overnight. Dried brains were weighed and wet-dry/wet percentage was calculated. For CHI brains, CHI or sham-injured brains were weighed wet, dried, and weighed as for CCI, but were not bisected into separate hemispheres.\n\nAssessment of brain tissue loss after controlled cortical impact\nMorphometric image analysis (ImageJ; NIH) was used to determine volume of brain tissue loss as previously described.\n13\n\nFoot fault test\nMice were placed on an elevated grid (30\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009cm). Openings in the grid were 1\u2009cm\n2\n. Mice were recorded from below, and front paw steps were counted while the mouse was moving around on the grid. A blinded observer analyzed the video for time to 100 steps and foot faults per side.\n\nWire grip test\nVestibular-motor function was assessed between 1 and 28 days post-injury using a wire-grip test as previously described.\n13\n\nMorris water maze\nCognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) as previously described.\n17\nOne hidden platform trial was performed on day 1 of MWM, and two hidden platform trials were performed on following days up to seven hidden platform trials. Seven hidden platform trials were performed rather than five because we found that seven trials resulted in more spatial search strategies in probe trials. Probe trials and visible platform trials were performed 24\u2009h after the last hidden trial. MWM was performed on days 3\u20136 post-injury for CHI mice and days 10\u201314 for CCI mice. Mice were given 30\u201360 minutes of rest in between the trials. Reversal MWM was performed at 3 weeks after initial the MWM using the same parameters, but the hidden platform was relocated to a different quadrant.\n\nElevated plus maze\nAnxiety-related behavior was assessed using elevated plus maze. Mice were placed in the center and allowed to walk freely in each arm (30\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009cm). The closed arms had walls of 15\u2009cm high. The plus maze was elevated 40\u2009cm from the floor. Times spent in open arms, closed arms, and the center were analyzed using Any-maze (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL).\n\nY-maze\nA Y-maze consisting of three arms (35\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009\u00d7\u20096\u2009cm) with an angle of 120 degrees between each of the two arms was used with visual cues (black symbols) on each end of the arms. The Y-maze test consisted of one 5-min trial per mouse. Mice were placed in the center of the Y-maze and had free access to all three arms. Trials were recorded using a ceiling-mounted camera, and the number of entries into each separate arm was analyzed. Alternation was assessed by the sequential pattern of arm entry. Continuous alternation was scored as the number (proportion) of arm choices that differed from the previous two choices. Data are expressed as percentage of alternating choices compared to total choices during the 5\u2009min.\n\nPorsolt forced swim test\nThe Porsolt forced swim test was performed as previously described,\n18\nwith minor modifications. Mice were placed in a cylindrical transparent glass tank of 30.5\u2009\u00d7\u200920.3\u2009cm (height\u2009\u00d7\u2009diameter) that was filled with water up to a height of 20\u2009cm. A white styrofoam box provided visual shielding on three sides. Mice were videotaped for 6\u2009min and put back into their cages after the trial. Videos were analyzed for escape-related mobility behavior that was quantified by a blinded observer by comparing the time the mouse spent struggling versus the time spent floating during the last 4\u2009min of the video.\n\nOpen-field test\nMice were individually placed in housing cages with clean bedding covered by a thin wire grid. Movements were tracked and recorded by ceiling-mounted cameras and Any-maze (Stoelting Co.). Recording started between 7:00\nam\nand 8:00\npm\n, 3\u2009h after mice had been placed in their cages, and continued for 8\u2009h. Mice were tested at 6 weeks post-injury.\n\nIsolation of brain leukocytes by fluorescence activated cell sorting\nMicroglia and brain leukocytes were isolated by MACS dissociation and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) as previously described.\n19\n,\n20\nMice were transcardially perfused with PBS, and brains were processed using gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) in an RPMI solution containing 0.2% Collagenase Type 3 (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ) and Dispase (2\u2009U/mL; Worthington Biochemical Corporation). DNase I (40\u2009U/mL) was added after dissociation and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. Five percent fetal bovine serum in PBS/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution was added to inactivate the digestion enzymes and passed through a 100-\u03bcm filter and centrifuged. Cell pellets were resuspended and mixed gently with physiological Percoll and centrifuged. Red blood cells (RBCs) were lysed with RBC lysis buffer. Cells were filtered through a 40-\u03bcm filter and stained with Alexa 488\u2013labeled CD45 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) and Alexa 647\u2013labeled CD11b (BioLegend) antibodies. Cells were sorted based on CD11b/CD45 expression using FACS ARIA (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ).\n\nIsolation of brain CD31\n+\nendothelial cells and CD11b\n+\ncells\nAdult mouse brain endothelial cells (ECs) were isolated as previously described using enzymatic dissociation and anti-CD31\u2013conjugated or anti-CD11b\u2013conjugated magnetic beads.\n21\nMice were transcardially perfused with PBS, and brains were homogenized in a 1-mg/mL collagenase A (Roche) solution and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. Samples were triturated with a 14-gauge metal cannula and passed through a 40-\u03bcm filter and centrifuged at 400\ng\nfor 8\u2009min. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS and incubated with either anti-CD31\u2013conjugated (BD) or anti-CD11b\u2013conjugated (BioLegend) Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30\u2009min and isolated using Dynamag (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until processing for western blot.\n\nQuantification and statistical analysis\nData are represented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). All data with\nn\n=\u20095 or more per group passed normality tests (Anderson-Darling test and others). Data with\nn\n=\u20094/group were densitometry or cell counts (continuous) and expected to be normally distributed. Data were analyzed using GraphPad PRISM software (version V; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Wire-grip, overnight open field, and MWM were analyzed using two-factor repeated measures of analysis of variance (ANOVA; group\u2009\u00d7\u2009time). Foot fault, brain edema, lesion volume, probe trial data, elevated plus maze, forced swim test, Y-maze, western blot densitometry data, and percentage of leukocytes were analyzed by\nt\n-test. For all comparisons,\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Animal procedures\nAll animal experiments were conducted in compliance with animal protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), following National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal care. Because repetitive injury in humans has predominately been reported in male athletes, particularly in contact sports, and in veterans,\n13\n,\n26\u201329\nwe sought to first specifically evaluate male mice to examine if this model of mild rTBI could recapitulate the higher-order cognitive deficits observed in humans. C57BL/6J male mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory at 7 weeks of age. Mice were given one week of acclimation and housed with a reversed 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and provided food and water\nad libitum\n. At 8 weeks of age, mice (total\nn\n=\u200941) were randomly assigned to the rTBI (\nn\n=\u200919) or sham control group (\nn\n=\u200922). Animals were anesthetized using isoflurane (2%) in oxygen 1\u2009L/min during the procedure. rTBI animals were subjected to multiple, mild, closed-head injuries using the CHIMERA device as previously reported.\n23\n,\n24\nBriefly, rTBI animals were placed supinely into an angled holding platform without any shaving of the head or incision into the skin so that the head was level with the piston target hole while aligning the eyes, ears, and nose such that the impact was centered on the dorsal convexity of the skull, targeting a 5-mm area surrounding bregma. A nose cone delivering isoflurane was removed just prior to the impact. Impact was initiated using RealTerm software, which was connected to a system including air tank, pressure regulator, digital pressure gauge, two-way solenoid valve, and piston. The impact was administered using an air pressure of 2.95 psi, resulting in an impact energy of 0.5\u2009J from the 5 mm, 50 g piston.\n23\n,\n24\nAnimals were moved to an incubator immediately after the impact and monitored until fully recovered. rTBI animals received an injury once per day for 5 days with a 24 h interval in between impacts. Five repeated hits were chosen to specifically focus on the effects of repeated exposure to TBI, as athletes and veterans are exposed to constant and repeated blows, even without experiencing concussive symptoms. Sham mice were exposed to the same isoflurane anesthesia paradigm (\u223c8\u2009min of anesthesia) without sustaining an impact. All animals regained the righting reflex in 5\u2009min or less. Skull fractures, seizures, apnea, or mortality were not observed in any animals, and no animals were excluded from the study due to injury parameters.\nMice underwent behavioral testing between 26 and 35 days post-injury (dpi), elevated plus maze at 26\u2009dpi (\nn\n=\u20099\u201310/group), social testing on 27\u201328\u2009dpi (\nn\n=\u200913\u201316/group), and delayed matching to place (DMP) using a modified Barnes maze at 32\u201335\u2009dpi (\nn\n=\u200915\u201318/group).\nIn vivo\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 40 dpi (\nn\n=\u20095\u20137/group). These animals were chosen randomly based on MRI scanner availability. In addition, a separate sub-set of animals that did not undergo behavioral testing or\nin vivo\nimaging (\nn\n=\u20094/group) was used for electrophysiological analysis, with recordings performed at 36\u201351\u2009dpi. Of note, three separate cohorts of mice were used for testing. The first cohort included 8 sham and 5 rTBI mice and underwent only social and DMP testing. A second cohort included 10 sham and 10 rTBI mice and it was decided to additionally evaluate behavior in the elevated plus maze. A third cohort included 4 sham and 4 rTBI mice and was used only for electrophysiology.\n\nBehavioral assays\nFor all behavioral assays the experimenters were blinded to the treatment. Beginning one week prior to behavioral analysis, animals were handled for habituation to experimenters and room settings. Behavior testing was performed during the animals' wake cycle. All behaviors were recorded using an overhead camera connected to a video tracking and analysis system (Ethovision XT 12.0, Noldus Information Technology). When tracking was not optimal, videos were manually scored by an investigator blinded to the treatment.\nElevated plus maze (EMP)\nAt 26\u2009dpi, animals were tested for their response to environmental stimuli using an elevated plus-shaped maze (\nn\n=\u20099\u201310/group) raised 40\u2009cm above the floor in a room with bright lighting, as previously described.\n30\u201332\nThe surface of the maze consisted of two closed arms opposite each other (30.5\u2009cm in length) enclosed in black plastic. The other two perpendicular arms were open (35\u2009cm in length) with white lights illuminating the open arms. Mice were placed in the center (4.5\u2009cm square) of the maze and allowed to explore for 5\u2009min while their location and activity were recorded. The maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between animals. The time in the open (which included time both in the open arms and center, which is uncovered) as well as the total distance traveled for each animal were recorded and scored using a video tracking and analysis setup (Ethovision XT 8.5, Noldus Information Technology). One sham animal fell off the maze during testing and was excluded from analysis.\nSociability and social memory\nAt 27\u201328\u2009dpi, sociability and social memory were assessed using a three-chamber social approach task in a dark room under red lighting as previously described (\nn\n=\u200913\u201316/group).\n32\n,\n33\nAnimals were placed individually into the center of the three chambers and their behavior was recorded during three consecutive phases: habituation, sociability, and social memory. In the habituation phase, the test animal was allowed to explore all three chambers for 10\u2009min. In the sociability phase, the mouse was returned to the center chamber while the experimenter placed a novel (non-aggressive, sex- and aged-matched) mouse in a wire cage on one side. On the opposite side, an empty wire cage was present (schematic in\nFig. 2A\n). The test animal was allowed to explore for 10\u2009min. In the social memory phase, the test animal was once again returned to the center chamber. In the previously empty wire cage, a novel (non-aggressive, sex- and aged-matched) mouse was placed, while the now familiar mouse was left in the opposite wire cage (schematic in\nFig. 2D\n). The test subject was then given 5\u2009min to explore. All of the apparatus was thoroughly cleaned using 70% ethanol between each animal. Animals were excluded from analysis if they failed to explore (less than 5\u2009sec of interaction) either the novel mouse or the empty cage/familiar mouse. Animals that failed to explore during the sociability phase were also excluded from the social memory phase.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nrTBI effects social functions, 27\u201328\u2009dpi.\n(A)\nSchematic of the three-chamber sociability task.

Spatial working memory was evaluated at 32\u201335\u2009dpi using a modified Barnes maze (pictured in\nFig. 3A\n) in a room with bright lighting, as previously described (\nn\n=\u200915\u201318/group).\n34\nThe maze consisted of a round table 112\u2009cm in diameter with 40 escape holes arranged in three concentric rings consisting of 8, 16, and 16 holes at 20, 35, and 50\u2009cm from the center of the maze, respectively. An escape tunnel was connected to one of the outer holes. Two visual cues were placed around the room such that they were visible to animals on the table. Bright overhead lighting and a loud tone (2 KHz, 85 db) were used as aversive stimuli to motivate animals to locate the escape tunnel. The assay was performed for 4 days (32\u201335\u2009dpi). The escape tunnel location was moved each day and animals ran four trials per day.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nrTBI impairs spatial learning and working memory, 32\u201335\u2009dpi.\n(A)\nRepresentative activity tracks for the last trial of a sham animal (left panel) and rTBI animal (right panel).\n(B)\nrTBI mice exhibit an altered escape latency compared with sham mice, most prominently on days 3 and 4 of testing. In addition, sham mice appear to learn by day 2 with a significant difference between trial 1 and 4, whereas rTBI mice do not demonstrate learning until day 4. Data are mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM (\nF\n(1,31)\n=\u200912.83,\np\n<\u20090.01; h\n2\n=\u20090.05 for treatment effect,\nF\n(15, 465)\n=\u200914.55,\np\n<\u20090.001; h\n2\n=\u20090.24 for trial effect,\nF\n(15, 465)\n=\u20091.95,\np\n<\u20090.05; h\n2\n=\u20090.03 for treatment x trial interaction, repeated measures two-way ANOVA); trials 2, 3, and 4 on day 3 (\n*p\n<\u20090.05) and trial 3 on day 4 (***\np\n<\u20090.001) show significant elevated escape latency in rTBI mice compared with sham mice; a significant reduction in escape latency between trial 1 and trial 4 is identified in sham mice on day 2 (###\np\n<\u20090.001), which continued through day 4 (day 3 ###\np\n<\u20090.001; day 4 ####\np\n<\u20090.0001), whereas rTBI animals only demonstrated a significant reduction in escape latency between trial 1 and trial 4 on day 4 (##\np\n<\u20090.01; Bonferroni post hoc test)).

Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nDuring each trial, animals were placed onto the center of the table covered by a dark box to prevent exposure to the room. The start of the trial was initiated when the box was removed and the tone started playing. The trial ended when the animal reached the escape tunnel or a maximum trial time of 90\u2009sec was reached. Upon entry into the tunnel, the tone was stopped. Animals that failed to find the escape tunnel were guided there. Animals remained in the escape tunnel for 10\u2009sec before being returned to their home cage. The maze and escape tunnel were cleaned with ethanol between each trial. No animals were excluded from this analysis.\n\nIn vivo\nmagnetic resonance imaging acquisitions\nMRI was performed on a 14.1 Tesla vertical MR system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with 100 G/cm gradients and a 1 H volume coil (internal diameter \u00d8I\u2009=\u200940\u2009mm). At 40\u2009dpi, mice (\nn\n=\u20095\u20137/group) were anesthetized using isoflurane (2% in O2) and then placed in a cylindrical holder with a tooth bar, allowing for reproducible positioning of the mouse head. Throughout all acquisitions, respiration rate and body temperature were continuously monitored. High-resolution axial T\n2\n-weighted fast spin echo images of the entire brain were acquired using the following parameters: Echo time (TE)/repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u200911.6/2006\u2009msec, echo train\u2009=\u20098, slice thickness\u2009=\u20090.5\u2009mm, slice number\u2009=\u200920, number of averages\u2009=\u20092, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u200930\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009mm\n2\n, scanning time\u2009=\u20092\u2009min, 12\u2009sec.\n\nMagnetic resonance image analysis\nFor anatomical and structural analyses, regions of interest including the corpus callosum, cortex, hippocampus, ventricles, and total brain were manually delineated utilizing AMIRA\n\u00ae\nsoftware (Mercury Computer Systems, San Diego) as depicted in\nSupplementary Figures 1\nand\n2\n(see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). For each region of interest, volume and regional average of T\n2\n-weighted MR signals, normalized to the average signal from the cerebral spinal fluid of the lateral and third ventricles (nT\n2\nw), were computed.\n\nElectrophysiology\nCoronal brain slices (250\u2009\u03bcm) including the medial PFC (mPFC) were prepared from both sham and rTBI mice, 36\u201351\u2009dpi (\nn\n=\u20094/group). Mice were anesthetized with Euthosal\n\u00ae\n(0.1\u2009mL/25\u2009g), and transcardially perfused with an ice-cold sucrose cutting solution containing (in mM): 210 sucrose, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 7 MgCl2, 7 dextrose, 1.3 ascorbic acid, 3 sodium pyruvate (bubbled with 95% O2\u20135% CO2, pH \u223c7.4). Mice were then decapitated and the brain was isolated in the same sucrose solution, and cut on a slicing vibratome. Slices were incubated in a holding solution (composed of [in mM] 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 dextrose, 1.3 ascorbic acid, 3 sodium pyruvate, bubbled with 95% O2\u20135% CO2, pH \u223c7.4) at 36\u00b0C for 30\u2009min and then at room temperature for at least 30\u2009min until recording.\nWhole cell current-clamp recordings were obtained from these slices in a submersion chamber with a heated (32\u201334\u00b0C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 dextrose (bubbled with 95% O2\u20135% CO2, pH \u223c7.4). Patch pipettes (3\u20136\u2009M\u03a9) were manufactured from filamented borosilicate glass capillaries and filled with an intracellular solution containing (in mM): 135 KGluconate, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 NaCl, 4 MgATP, 0.3 Na3GTP, 7 2K-phosphcreatine, and 0.5\u20131% biocytin or neurobiotin. Layer V pyramidal neurons in the mPFC were identified using infrared microscopy with a 40x water-immersion objective (Olympus, Burlingame, CA). Recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) amplifier, which was connected to the computer with a Digidata 1320 ADC, and recorded at a sampling rate of 10\u201320\u2009kHz with pClamp\u2122 software (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA). We did not correct for the junction potential, but access resistance and pipette capacitance were appropriately compensated before each recording. Only neurons with an access resistance <20\u2009M\u03a9 and a resting membrane potential below \u221255 mV were included.\nThe membrane and spiking characteristics were assessed by injection of a series of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current steps with a duration of 250\u2009msec from \u2212250 pA to 700 nA (in increments of 50 pA). The resting membrane potential was the measured voltage of the cell 5\u2009min after obtaining whole cell configuration without current injection. A holding current was then applied to maintain the neuron at \u221270mV before/after current injections. The input resistance was determined from the steady-state voltage reached during the \u221250 pA current injection. The membrane time constant was the time required to reach 63% of the maximum change in voltage for the \u221250 pA current injection. The degree of I\nH\ncurrent was assessed by measuring two parameters: 1) the voltage sag, defined as the change in voltage between the maximum hyperpolarization and the steady state potential for the \u2212200 pA current injection; and 2) the rebound after depolarization (ADP), defined as the change in voltage between the maximum depolarization and the steady-state potential achieved immediately after ending the \u2212200 pA current injection. The sum of these two variables is an overall indicator of the amount of I\nH\ncurrent.\n35\nAction potential parameters were measured from the current injection that was 100 pA above the first current injection that elicited spiking, or if this injection had fewer than 3 action potentials, the first current injection with >3 action potentials. Action potential times were detected by recording the time at which the positive slope of the membrane potential crossed 0\u2009mV. From the action potential times, the instantaneous frequency for each action potential was determined (1/inter spike interval). Action potential rate as a function of current injection was examined by plotting the first instantaneous action potential frequency versus current injection amplitude. The F/I slope was then determined from the best linear fit of the positive values of this plot. The action potential amplitude was calculated by measuring the voltage difference between the peak voltage of the action potential and the subsequent minimum voltage prior to the next action potential. The half width of the action potential was determined as the average duration of the action potentials at half the amplitude. The frequency adaptation of each cell was the ratio of the first over the last instantaneous firing frequency. Action potential threshold was defined as the voltage at the maximum second derivative of V (\nd\n2\nV/dt\n) in the phase-space representation of the action potential.\n36\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nBrain slices obtained from electrophysiological recordings were drop-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in a phosphate-buffered solution (4\u201348\u2009h), then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with sodium azide (0.1\u2009M PBS +0.05% NaN\n3\n) and stored at 4\u00b0C for 0\u20135 days until processing. Sections were then washed in PBS (3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min), incubated in a blocking solution (10% donkey serum diluted in 0.5% Triton X-100 in 0.1M PBS) for 1\u2009h, and then incubated with primary antibody, IBA-1 (1:500, Wako 019-19741) with 0.25% Triton X-100, and 5% donkey serum in 0.1\u2009M PBS, at room temperature overnight, along with a streptavidin-conjugated Alexafluor 555 (1:500, ThermoFisher Scientific, S32355). The following day, sections were then rinsed with PBS (3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min) and incubated in secondary antibody (1:500, Alexa 488 donkey anti-rabbit, Invitrogen, A21206) at room temperature overnight. Finally, sections were rinsed and mounted in an aqueous medium. Images were obtained using a Zeiss Imager Z1 Apotome microscope controlled by ZEN software (Zeiss 2012). For each mouse, three sections of mPFC (from bregma 1.42\u20131.98\u2009mm) were imaged with a 20x objective, centered over layer V and including multiple layers of cortex (\u223clayers II\u2013VI), obtaining a Z-stack of 10\u2009\u03bcm with a 0.5-\u03bcm slice interval. Image stacks were viewed and Z-projected using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) or LSM Viewer (Zeiss). IBA-1-positive cells were manually counted for each image and divided by the total surface area of the flattened image to obtain the number of cells/mm\n2\n.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 7 statistical software. It is well established that violations in normality have little effect on Type 1 error rates,\n37\ntherefore we have used a very restricted definition for defining data as non-parametric: using both D'Agostino-Pearson omnibus and Shapiro-Wilk tests, the data distribution had to exhibit an alpha <0.01 for both tests to be considered outside of the normal distribution. Differences in variance between groups were determined using an F test. Statistical significance between groups for most variables was determined using a two-tailed\nt\ntest. If there was a significant difference in variance between groups, Welch's correction was added to the two-tailed\nt\ntest. If data were outside of the normal distribution as indicated above, a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used. The DMP maze and the firing response to increasing current injections were analyzed as a repeated measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Bonferroni post hoc examination. Outliers were determined using the extreme Studentized deviate (ESD) method and were excluded from analysis.\nP\nvalues <0.05 were considered significant."

    "Methods": "Animals and controlled cortical impact\u2013induced traumatic brain injury\nExperimental procedure was conducted as recently reported.\n18\nIn brief, 48 male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (170\u2013200\u2009g; Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) were randomly assigned to three different groups: 1) na\u00efve control; 2) craniotomy (sham CCI); and 3) CCI. Four animals per group were sacrificed at 4\u2009h, 24\u2009h, 3 days, and 7 days post-CCI. For the CCI group, animals were initially anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in O\n2\nto a surgical plane in a vented anesthesia chamber connected to an isoflurane scrubber. Rats were mounted in the injury device, secured by ear bars and incisor bar, and spontaneously anesthetized with a 2% isoflurane in O\n2\nby blow-by nose cone connected to a charcoal canister passive isoflurane scavenger. Animal body temperature was maintained at the temperature range between 35\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C during the surgery by a warming lamp. An incision and a 10-mm craniotomy were made over the left primary and secondary motor cortex (bregma 3.70\u2009mm, interaural 12.70\u2009mm). After removal of the bone flap, cortical injury was induced with a CCI device,\n44\nwith a penetration depth of 1.5\u2009mm, velocity of 5\u2009m/s, and duration of 50\u2009msec. The bone flap was replaced and sealed with dental cement, and the scalp incision was closed with staples. Animals were observed after the surgery until fully recovered. All CCI and craniotomy animals recovered from isoflurane anesthesia and became mobile within 5 mins after isoflurane discontinuation. Although most CCI animals resumed some exploratory behavior 30\u2009min after CCI, their motor activity (open-field and rotarod performance) was significantly reduced immediately after the surgery, but recovered to baseline within 3 days post-CCI (data not shown). No additional post-operative pain medicine was given to the animals with CCI or craniotomy. Animals were sacrificed and brain samples were collected at 4\u2009h, 24\u2009h, 3days, and 7 days post-CCI (\nN\n=\u20094/group/time). Coronal sections of the hemisphere corresponding to the CCI epicenter and the corresponding contralateral area were separated, rapidly frozen in pre-cooled isopentane (on dry ice), and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for mRNA (rostral half section) and protein analysis (caudate half section). For immunohistochemistry, animals were perfused with 100\u2009mL of normal saline and then 500\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) as reported.\n45\nAll animal procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.\n\nPrimary cortical neuronal and astrocyte cultures\nEmbryos from pregnant rats (E-18) were used for the culture of cortical neurons. Pregnant rats were euthanized with CO\n2\n, and the embryos were removed immediately. Cortices were dissected carefully and cut into small pieces, and 0.5\u2009mL of 2.5% trypsin in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) was added and incubated 15\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. Tissue was then washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Tissue was triturated in three cycles with 20 triturations each using a plastic serological pipette to dissociate cells from tissue. Neurons were plated in poly-\nd\n-lysine\u2013coated six-well plates or 10-cm dishes at a density of 6\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n6\nin DMEM. Neurons were adjusted with DMEM to the density and then plated. The medium was changed into neurobasal medium with 5% B27 the following day and every 3 days thereafter. Cells were studied on day 11.\nPrimary culture of astrocytes was prepared from cortices of postnatal day 3 Sprague\u2013Dawley rat pups. Pups were anesthetized by hypothermia and rapidly decapitated; the cranium was cut away and the brain was removed. Brain cortices were dissected and chopped to fine pieces in HBSS with penicillin/streptomycin, then trypsinized with 2.5% trypsin and 0.001% DNAse for 25\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. The trypsin reaction was inhibited with DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 50\u2009\u03bcg/mL of gentamicin. Tissue was triturated in three cycles with 20 triturations each using a plastic serological pipette to dissociate the cells from the tissue. Cells were passed through a cell strainer and then plated in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 50\u2009\u03bcg/mL of gentamicin to a density of 40,000 cells/cm\n2\n, counted with a hemocytometer. Media was changed every 3 days, and cells were allowed to grow to 95% confluence.\nBecause a high level of glutamate is a chemical stress to neurons, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) is a stimulus for astrocytes,\n46\n,\n47\nthey were selected to challenge the appropriate neural cells in our\nin vitro\nstudy.\n\nRNA extraction and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction\nFrozen brain tissues were homogenized and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed (RT) into first-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) in a total volume of 20\u2009\u03bcL using the RETROscript reverse transcriptase kit and oligo dT primers (Ambion, Austin, TX). Quantification of mRNA expression was performed in triplicate using a SYBR Green SuperMix (BioRad, Hercules, CA) in a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reaction procedure, performed on the MyiQ Single Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad). One microliter cDNA from the reverse transcription (RT) reaction was used as the template for quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) reaction with a final PCR reaction volume of 25\u2009\u03bcL, with the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 gene-specific PCR primer concentrations at 200\u2009nM each. Real-time PCR primers were designed using Primer3 software (Whitehead Institute, MIT, Cambridge, MA) according to the coding sequences of each gene. After initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 3\u2009min, 40 cycles of primer annealing and elongation were conducted at 60\u00b0C for 45\u2009sec, followed by denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009sec. Fluorescent emission data were captured, and mRNA levels were quantified using the threshold cycle value (Ct). To compensate for variations in input RNA amounts and efficiency of RT, qPCR data for mRNA for each sample were normalized by reference to the data obtained for housekeeping beta-actin (GenBank #BC063166) determined from the same sample. Fold change in mRNA expression was calculated using the equation: fold change\u2009=\u20092\n\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct\n, where \u0394Ct\u2009=\u2009target gene Ct\u2212house-keeping gene (\u03b2-actin) Ct, and \u0394\u0394Ct is \u0394Ct control\u2212\u0394Ct CCI-TBI (or fold change)\u2009=\u20092^\n(\u0394CT control\u2212\u0394CT CCI-TBI)\n.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nPerfusion-fixed (4% PFA) brains were cut into coronal sections of 50-\u03bcm thickness with a cryostat, and sections were rinsed with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30\u2009min. Endogenous peroxidase and peroxidase-like activity were blocked by incubating the sections in 0.36% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 30\u2009min. For immunostaining, brain sections were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with a goat polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) against pBCKD (generous gift from Dr. C.J. Lynch, 1:500). After three 10-min washes with PBS, brain slices were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with biotin-conjugated antigoat IgG (1:400; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and then horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin (1:500; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), respectively. Brain sections were rinsed three times in PBS for 10\u2009min. Finally, sections were incubated with 0.05% 3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine and 2.5% nickel ammonium sulfate. The omission of the first antibody was used as the negative control.\n\nWestern blotting\nBrain tissues samples from the cortex around the CCI territory, the corresponding area in the contralateral side, and sham-operated and normal rats were homogenized and sonicated for 40\u2009sec in a lysis buffer as previously described.\n18\n,\n45\nProtein concentrations were determined and aliquots of 10\u2009\u03bcg of the total proteins were separated by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gels (10%). Proteins were subsequently transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was then incubated with the monoclonal antibodies to BCKD (generous gift from C.J. Lynch, 1:500), pBCKD (generous gift from C.J. Lynch, 1:500), or BCKDK (generous gift from R. Harris, 1:200) at 4\u00b0C overnight, respectively. Membranes were washed three times with PBS and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescent autoradiography. Bands of western blotting were scanned and quantified with NIH IMAGE 1.61 software (version 1.61; NIH, Bethesda, MD).\n\nStatistical analysis\nData of real-time qPCR of mRNA expression level and western blotting of protein levels were expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. Effects of CCI/craniotomy treatment on gene/protein expression were analyzed using analysis of variance followed by post-hoc test. A difference with a\np\nvalue less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Mice\nAll animal procedures were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health PHS Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice were maintained in a temperature-controlled animal room on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Four cohorts of C57BL/6 male mice were used. This 3-day study used a total of 36 randomized mice (4.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 months). Two cohorts (\nn\n=\u200912 each) were used as controls and HBED treatment. Procedures in sham cohorts were performed with two groups equally assigned with and without HBED treatment (\nn\n=\u20096 each). No mice died or were excluded from this study. All procedures, including HBED and vehicle delivery, functional outcomes, and anatomical and histological analyses were performed, assessed, and analyzed in a blinded manner.\n\nControlled-cortical impact model of TBI\nThe controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI was induced by following the procedure we have described earlier with some modifications.\n13\nBriefly, mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and were maintained with 1.5\u20132% isoflurane during surgical procedures. Mice were placed in the stereotaxic apparatus and the skull was exposed by a 1-cm incision using a scalpel blade. The skin was displaced with a cotton tip, and a circular craniotomy approximately 4\u2009mm in diameter was made in the right parietal bone. Mild-to-moderate impact on the right hemisphere was inflicted using the CCI model (PCI3000 PinPoint Precision Cortical Impactor, Hatteras Instruments, Cary, NC) with an impact tip diameter of 3\u2009mm, a velocity of 3\u2009m/sec, and a compression distance and time of 1.5\u2009mm and 100\u2009msec, respectively. A sterile cylindrical-shaped ring was placed around the craniotomy and sealed by a glass coverslip to preserve brain tissue and minimize external confounding factors. After closing the incision, the mice were placed into a temperature-controlled recovery chamber for at least 1\u2009h before being moved to a clean home cage. During the entire surgical procedure mouse rectal temperature was monitored and maintained at 37.0\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C using a controlled heating pad (Fine Science Tools, Vancouver, BC, Canada).\n\nHBED dose and administration\nThe HBED iron chelator (Strem Chemicals, Inc., Newburyport, MA) was dissolved in sterile phosphate buffered saline,\n7\n,\n14\nand then filtered through a 20-\u03bcm Whattman filter. HBED was administered in a 50-mg/kg subcutaneous dose. The dose used in this study is based on previous studies showing the effect of this dose in removing excess iron from the brain and other organs in na\u00efve animals.\n6\u20138\n,\n15\n,\n16\nEach mouse received a loading dose of 100\u2009mg/kg immediately after the onset of TBI and then received a dose of 50\u2009mg/kg/12\u2009h for 72\u2009h. Thus, each mouse received 150\u2009mg/kg during the first 24\u2009h and 100\u2009mg/kg/24\u2009h for the remaining days. HBED has significant bioavailability after such a subcutaneous protocol.\n7\nMore specifically, in previous studies, HBED levels in brain were detectable at 1\u2009h, peaked at 3\u2009h, and remained stable for at least 6\u2009h, which gives it an advantage over other iron chelators such as DFO, which has a shorter half-life.\n6\n\nNeurologic deficit scores\nFunctional outcomes after TBI were assessed by neurological deficit scores (NDS) and rotarod tests daily. These outcomes were assessed in the same order and at the same time of day, with 1\u2009h of rest between the tests.\n17\n,\n18\nAs we maintained our mice in a reversed light/dark cycle facility, these behavioral protocols were performed during their active, awake period. The NDS behavioral test assesses motor function by examining body and front limb symmetry, circling and compulsory circling behavior, and climbing. Higher scores are given for more severe injuries and lower scores for mild to no injury. The scores were graded from 0 to 4 in increasing deficit order for each function assessed. Each mouse was assessed by two independent investigators and the scores for each function were combined. The average of both investigators' final score is reported.\n\nRotarod\nThe accelerating rotarod tests mice for their motor ability, coordination endurance, and balance (Rotamex-5, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Baseline was the final read after 3 consecutive days of training where each mouse had three sessions of training in the morning and another three sessions in the afternoon. Rotational speed began at 8\u2009rpm and ended at 50\u2009rpm, and the latency to fall was collected automatically by the machine software.\n17\n,\n19\n\nHistology and quantification\nHistology and quantification were conducted as described.\n17\n,\n18\nBriefly, 16 sections equally distributed throughout the trauma area were processed. Cresyl violet staining was used to assess anatomical tissue injury, hemispheric enlargement, hippocampal swelling, and bleeding amounts. Perls' iron staining was used to evaluate iron following a previously described protocol.\n20\n,\n21\nImmunohistochemistry staining was performed using anti-Iba1 (1:1500, Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA), anti-AQP4 (1:2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and anti-4-HNE (1:750, Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Secondary matched antibodies and 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine protocols were provided by Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). All brain sections were simultaneously stained. Slides were scanned using an Aperio ScanScope CS and analyzed with ImageScope software (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany).\nFor quantification of brain pathology (cortical lesion, hippocampal swelling, hemisphere volumes, and Perls' iron), all sections were quantified. Injured brain areas were outlined. Using these areas, known distances between sections, and section thickness, a total brain injury volume was calculated. For Perls' staining and blood quantification, brain compartments were outlined. Ipsilateral cortical and hippocampal microgliosis, 4-HNE, and AQP4 expression were analyzed by placing identically sized boxes of 1000\u2009\u00d7\u20091000 pixels in these regions, whereas 500\u2009\u00d7\u2009500 pixel squares were used to assess 4-HNE and microgliosis in the impacted corpus callosum. Hemispheric microgliosis and AQP4 expression were analyzed by outlining of the ipsilateral hemisphere, including the lesion area, and these data are presented as the signal per area quantified. A positive pixel count algorithm was optimized for each stain such that the appropriate signal level was detected and the data were reported as positivity ratio or positive pixel count per given area.\n22\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo compare NDS and anatomical differences between the experimental and control groups,\nt\ntest with equal variants was used. Generalized regression data analysis was used for progression of NDS performance over time. Mixed model regression data analysis and Tukey's post hoc comparison test between matched groups was used for rotarod assessment. All data were checked for normality and equal variances and are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of mean;\np\n-values <0.05 were considered significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nStudies were performed using young-adult (3 months of age, 22\u201326\u2009g) male C57Bl/6 mice. All surgical procedures complied with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH; DHEW publication NIH 85-23-2985). Males and females have differences in response to TBI.\n21\nIn this study, we used only male mice to avoid influence of reproductive cycle and hormone fluctuation.\n\nControlled cortical impact\nCCI is an experimental model of TBI.\n22\nOur custom-designed CCI device\n23\nconsists of a microprocessor-controlled pneumatic impactor with a 3.5-mm diameter tip. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane evaporated in a gas mixture containing 70% N\n2\nO and 30% O\n2\nand administered through a nose mask (induction at 3% and maintenance at 1.5%). The head was mounted in a stereotaxic frame, a 10-mm midline incision was made over the skull, and the skin and fascia were reflected. A 5-mm craniotomy was made on the central aspect of the left parietal bone. Moderate-level injury was induced by using an impactor velocity of 6\u2009m/s and deformation depth of 2\u2009mm as previously described.\n24\nAfter injury and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection, the incision was closed (the craniotomy was not closed to avoid additional injury) with 9-mm EZ clips (Steeling), anesthesia was terminated, and the animal placed into a heated cage to maintain normal core temperature for 45\u2009min post-injury. In this study, we only used male C57Bl/6 mice to avoid the disrupting influence of the reproductive cycle and hormone fluctuation in female mice on cell death mechanisms. References to TBI in this work refer only to this CCI model.\n\nIn vivo\ndrug treatments\nFifteen minutes post-injury, mice received a single i.c.v. injection of 0.3125 or 1.25\u2009\u03bcg of recombinant Ang-1 or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; vehicle). Drugs were administered in ACSF and injected into the left ventricle (coordinates from bregma\u2009=\u2009A: \u22120.5; L: \u22121.0; and V: \u22122.0) using a 30-gauge needle attached to a Hamilton syringe at a rate of 0.5\u2009mL/min, with a final volume of 5\u2009\u03bcL of 0.1\u2009mM of miR hairpin inhibitor or 5\u2009\u03bcL of 0.25\u2009\u03bcg of Ang-1.\n\nIn vitro\ncell culture\nRat cortical neurons (RCNs) were derived from rat embryonic cortices as previously described.\n25\nNeurons were maintained in serum-free conditions using the B27 supplement. Purity of the neuronal culture was confirmed by MAP-2\n26\nstaining (a marker for viable neurons) showing the cultures were >95% neurons (\nFig. 1\n). Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; astrocyte marker) staining was used to determinate the presence of astrocytes. We found that 2.3% of cells in culture were GFAP positive (data not shown). Primary cortical neurons grown on glass cover-slips were fixed and immunostained using standard immunocytochemistry techniques. Sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor goat antimouse and -rabbit antibodies; 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used as a nuclear counter stain. Imaging was performed using a Leica TCS SP5 II Tunable Spectral Confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn, IL). We examined nine independent fields of control primary neurons identifying live cells based on lack of chromatin condensation (DAPI; the number of total counted cells/field [DAPI] ranged from 211 to 359. The number of neurons in these populations were identified as microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) positive whereas astrocytes were identified as GFAP positive.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nPurity of primary rat cortical neuron (RCN) cultures.

RCNs were transfected with miR mimics and hairpin inhibitors using the LipofectamineRNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Based on preliminary titration experiments, we chose a final concentration of 50\u2009nM for the miR mimics, hairpin inhibitors, and their negative controls. This concentration resulted in optimal transfection efficiency (\u223c50%), was devoid of nonspecific changes in nontargeted miRs, and had no neurotoxic effects.\n18\nFour hours after transfection, media were replaced with normal condition media and cells treated with etoposide or \u03b2-amyloid. The following miR mimics and hairpin inhibitors were used: miRIDIAN microRNA Mimic Negative Control (\u2212ve con mimic; CN-001000-01-05); miRIDIAN Mimic, Rat rno-miR-711 (C-320669-00-0005); miRIDIAN microRNA Hairpin Inhibitor Negative Control (\u2212ve con inhibit; IN-001005-01-05); and miRIDIAN microRNA Rat rno-miR-711 Hairpin Inhibitor (IH-HMR-XX-0005) (Dharmacon Inc.). Sequences of both miRIDIAN microRNA Mimic Negative Control and miRIDIAN microRNA Hairpin Inhibitor Negative Control are based on\nCaenorhabditis elegans\nmiRs and have minimal sequence identity in human, mouse, and rat.\n\nRat cortical neuron treatment\nDNA damage, including DNA breaks produced by oxidative injury and other mechanisms, is a key inducer of neuronal cell death after TBI.\n27\nEtoposide is an anticancer drug that produces DNA breaks in neurons by inhibiting DNA-topoisomerase-II, resulting in caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis.\n28\n,\n29\nEtoposide treatment\nCells were treated with 12.5\u2009\u03bcM of etoposide diluted in normal condition media for 3\u2009h. After 3\u2009h, etoposide media were replaced with normal condition media.\n\u03b2-amyloid treatment\nCells were treated with 50\u2009uM of \u03b2-amyloid for 24\u2009h. Carrier Free Recombinant Human Angiopoietin-1 Protein (Ang-1; cat# 923-AN-025/CF; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) that shares 97% amino acid sequence identity with mouse and rat Ang-1 has been used in this study. RCNs were treated with Ang-1 at a final concentration 200\u2009ng/mL.\n\nSmall interfering RNA gene silencing\nRCNs were transfected with ON-TARGET plus SMART pool Angpt1 siRNA (#L-089028-02) and ON-TARGET plus Non-targeting Pool (#D-001810-10; GE Healthcare Dharmacon Inc., Lafayette, CO) using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer's protocol. SMART pool small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a pool of four chemically modified siRNAs. Using pool of siRNAs lowers the effective concentration of each individual siRNA. Chemical modifications of the siRNA itself impede sense-strand entry into RISC and other potential off-targets. Dharmacon siRNA design considers miRNA-like seed regions as one of the filters for siRNA screening. These three approaches help to eliminate siRNA-induced nonspecific gene modulation by siRNAs.\n\nFunction-blocking experiments\nThe following reagents were used in signaling-blocking experiments: antibodies against \u03b21-integrin (5\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Clone JB1A; Chemicon, Temecula, CA); antibodies against Tie2 (50\u2009\u03bcg/mL; #AF762; R&D Systems); focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor PF573228 (100\u2009nM; TocrisBioscience, Bristol, UK)\n30\n; PLC inhibitor U73122 (1\u2009\u03bcM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO); and U-73344 (1\u2009\u03bcM; Sigma-Aldrich) as control/inactive analog of PLC inhibitor\n10\n; Akt inhibitor (1L6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol-2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecyl-sn-glycerocarbonate; Calbiochem, Burlington, MA) selectively inhibits Akt (PKB; half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC\n50\n] of 5.0\u2009\u03bcM) and moderately inhibits PI3-K activity (IC\n50\n=\u200983.0\u2009\u03bcM).\n\nCell death, cell viability, and in-plate fluorometric caspase-3 assays\nCell death, cell viability, and in-plate fluorometric caspase-3 activity were measured using the LDH, Calcein AM, and DEVD-AMC assays, respectively, as previously described.\n18\nEach individual treatment/time point reflects six replicates for all assays performed in RCNs cultured in 96-well plates.\n\nRNA-interacting protein immunoprecipitation using argonaute 2\u2013specific antibodies\nOne strand of the mature miR binds to argonaute (Ago) proteins to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), and miR acts as a template for RISC to recognize and cleave complementary mRNA. miRNA-mRNA target pairs can be purified by immunoprecipitation of the RISC components to confirm mRNA targets. Ago2 immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described.\n31\nBriefly, RCNs were suspended in 500\u2009\u03bcL of lysis buffer (150\u2009mM of KCl, 25\u2009mM of Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 5\u2009mM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], 0.5% NP-40, 5\u2009mM of dithiothreitol [DTT]) and protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor (2, 3) cocktails (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4\u00b0C for 20\u2009min., and cell lysates were separated by centrifugation at 12,000\ng\nfor 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. A volume of 50\u2009\u03bcL of protein A/G UltraLink Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and 20\u2009\u03bcL of argonaute 2 (Ago2) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) were added to 400\u2009\u03bcL of cell lysate (in a final 1-mL mixture filled with lysis buffer), and the mixture was rotated for 4\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. Beads were washed three times with 1\u2009mL of lysis buffer to remove nonspecific binding. RNAs bound on the beads were extracted by the miRNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). miR and gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR; as described below).\n\nConstruction of reporter plasmids and luciferase assays\nAn RNA hybrid miR target prediction tool\n32\npredicted two sites for rno-miR-711 in 3\u2032UTR of rat Ang1 (at positions 1872 and 1820; NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_053546.1); six sites for has-miR-711 were predicted in 3\u2032-UTR of human Ang-1 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_001146.4); and four sites for mmu-miR-711 were predicted in 3\u2033UTR of mouse Ang-1 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_009640.4). To produce reporter plasmids containing 3\u2032-UTRs of rat Ang-1, sequences were PCR amplified, digested, gel purified, ligated, and cloned into pmirGLO vector (Promega, Madison, WI) digested with XbaI and SalI restriction enzymes. The following primers were used to amplify 3\u2032-UTR of rat Ang-1; 3\u2032-UTR forward primer 5\u2032-tg\nTCTAGA\nCTGAAGGCGCTATGCC TAGTA-3\u2032, reverse primer 5\u2032- tg\nGTCGAC\nTGGAACGGAGACAATGCTGG-3\u2032. XbaI site was added on the 5\u2032 end of forward primers, and SalI site was added to the 5\u2032 end of reverse primers for cloning into pmirGLO vector XbaI, SalI-digested vector (XbaI and SalI sites are marked bold). RCNs were cultured in 96-well plates and transfected as described above. All assays were performed at 24\u2009h after transfection with the dual luciferase assay (Promega) on a BioTek Synergy HT Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Experiments were performed in triplicate.\n\nRNA isolation\nTotal RNA was isolated using miRNeasy Kit (Qiagen). During the process of isolation, samples were treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) to digest DNA contamination of the samples according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\nQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction\nThe Verso cDNA Kit (Thermo Scientific) was used to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) from purified total RNA as described previously.\n18\nqPCR amplification was performed by using cDNA TaqMan Universal Master Mix II (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). TaqMan Gene Expression assays for following mouse (Mm) and rat (Rt) genes were performed: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Mm99999915_g1; Rn01775763_g1); p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA; Mm00519268_m1); Noxa (Mm00451763_m1); Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim; Mm00437796_m1); Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax; Mm00432051_m1); Ang-1 (Mm00456503_m1; Rn01504818_m1); neurogranin (Nrgn; Mm01178296_g1); neurofilament medium polypeptide (Nefm; Mm00456201_m1); and synapsin I (Syn-1; Mm00449772_m1; Applied Biosystems). Primers for tight junction protein 1 (TJP1) and occludin (Ocln) were described previously.\n33\nReactions were amplified and quantified using a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System and the corresponding software (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH, and the relative quantity of mRNAs was calculated based on the comparative threshold cycle method.\n34\n\nMicroRNA reverse transcription\nqPCR was used to measure the expression of mature miR-711. A unit of 10\u2009ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the TaqMan miRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) with miRNA-specific primers. Reverse-transcription reaction products (1.5\u2009\u03bcL) were used for qPCR as described above. TaqMan Gene Expression assays for the following miRs were used: mmu-miR-711 (001646); rno-miR-711 (241136_mat); and U6 snRNA (001973; Applied Biosystems).\n\nCell lysates preparation and western blot\nWhole-cell extracts and western blot were prepared/performed as previously described.\n35\nChemiluminescence was captured on a ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and protein bands were quantified by densitometric analysis using Image Lab Imaging Software (Bio-Rad). The data presented reflect the intensity of the target protein band compared to the control and were normalized based on the intensity of the endogenous control for each sample (expressed in arbitrary units).\n\nAntibodies\nThe following antibodies were used in this study: Histone H2A.X (ab11175; Abcam); apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF; sc-13116); cytochrome c (sc-13560) and Bim (sc-11425; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); cleaved caspase-3 (#9661), cleaved PARP (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1; #9545); phospho-GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 (glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b1/\u03b2; Ser21/9; #9331); forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a; 75D8; #2497); Akt (pan; 11E7; #4685); FAK (#3285); phospho-FAK (Tyr397; #3283); phospho-p53 (Ser15; #9284); p53 (#2524); mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2; #8727); Lamin A/C (#4777); cyclooxegenase IV (COX-IV; #4844); phospho-Akt (Ser473; #4060; Cell Signaling Technology; GAPDH (ADI-CSA-335) and \u03b1-fodrin (BML-FG6090); active Bax (ALX-804-224-C100; Enzo Life Sciences, Inc., Farmingdale, NY); PUMA (#3041), Noxa (#2437; ProSci Incorporated, Poway, CA); \u03b2-actin (A1978); MAP2 (M3696; Sigma-Aldrich); integrin \u03b21 (MAB1965); GFAP (MAB360; Millipore, Billerica, MA); Ang-1 (GTX28451; GeneTex Inc., Irvine, CA); Tie-2 (#AF762); phospho-Tie-2 (#AF2720; R&D Systems); and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (019-19741; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan).\n\nSubcellular fractionation\nSubcellular fractionation was performed as described previously,\n35\nwith some modifications. RCNs were harvested and washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell suspension was centrifuged at 500\ng\nfor 15\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Cell pellet was resuspended for 10\u2009min on ice in the digitonin lysis buffer (20\u2009mM of HEPES [pH 7.4], 80\u2009mM of KCl, 1\u2009mM of EDTA, 1\u2009mM of ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 1\u2009mM of DTT, 250\u2009mM of sucrose, 200\u2009\u03bcg/mL of digitonin and protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor (2, 3) cocktails; Sigma-Aldrich). The lysate was centrifuged at 1000\ng\nfor 5\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to pellet the nuclei. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged again at 12,000\ng\nfor 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to pellet the mitochondria. The resulting supernatant, representing the cytosolic fraction, was recovered. Nuclear and mitochondrial lysates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (TEKnova, Hollister, CA) with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Tissue samples were homogenized in a glass dounce after 20 passes with a 20-G needle. All steps were performed on ice. To check the purity of nuclear and cytosolic fractions, we probed pooled nuclear (N), cytosolic (C) fractions and total lysates (T) samples (20\u2009\u03bcg of protein per well) with antibodies against the well-established mitochondrial marker, COX-IV, nuclear marker, Lamin A/C, and cytosolic marker, MEK1/2.\n\nY-maze spontaneous alternation test\nThe Y-maze measures the willingness of rodents to explore new environments and assesses spatial working memory. Rodents typically prefer to investigate a new arm of the maze rather than returning to one that was visited previously. The Y-maze test was performed on day 14 post-injury as previously described.\n36\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging procedure\nTwenty-four hours after CCI, mice underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI). All experiments were performed on a Bruker BioSpec 7.0 Tesla 30-cm horizontal bore scanner (Bruker BioSpin, Austin, TX), interfaced to a Bruker Paravision 5.1 console. A four-element 1-H surface coil array was used as the receiver and a 72-mm linear-volume coil as the transmitter. Animals were initially anesthetized using isoflurane (3\u20134% in O\n2\n; 1L/min), then placed prone in a Bruker animal bed. The radiofrequency receiver coil was then centered over the brain and the animal bed was moved to the center of the magnet. At all times during the experiment, the animal was under 1\u20132% isoflurane anesthesia and 1\u2009L/min oxygen administration. An MR-compatible system was used to monitor respiration rate, and body temperature was maintained at 36\u201337.5\u00b0C, using a circulating warm water heater.\nA scout image consisting of three slices (one each in the axial, mid-sagittal, and coronal planes) was used to center the mouse's brain in the imaging field of view. A rapid shimming protocol (FASTMAP) was used to reduce external magnetic field inhomogeneity within the region of interest.\n37\nBoth proton density- and T\n2\n-weighted coronal images were obtained using two-dimensional rapid acquisition with a relaxation enhancement sequence. The sequence parameters were: repetition time/effective echo time (TE\neff1\n/TE\neff2\n)\u2009=\u20093500/18.9/56.8\u2009ms, number of echoes\u2009=\u20094, matrix size\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, slice thickness\u2009=\u20090.5\u2009mm, number of averages\u2009=\u200910, field of view\u2009=\u200920\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009mm\n2\n, in-plane resolution\u2009=\u200978\u2009\u03bcm\n2\n, number of slices\u2009=\u200932.\nMRI data were quantified using the MIPAV application. The MIPAV (Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization) application enables quantitative analysis and visualization of medical images of numerous modalities, such as positron emission tomography, MRI, computed tomography, or microscopy, and is provided by the Center for Information Technology at the NIH (\nhttps://mipav.cit.nih.gov\n).\nBrain lesion volume was measured on the T\n2\n-weighted coronal images using a semiautomatic procedure. Hyperintense areas marking the post-traumatic edema at the lesion site were outlined on each image in the series using the \u201cdraw level set VOI (volume of interest)\u201d tool of MIPAV. Extended volume was calculated using the \u201cVOI statistics generator\u201d tool. Volume of the skull and overlying skin was determined by modifying the original contours using the \u201csplit VOI contour\u201d tool to mark these regions and was subtracted from the extended volume to produce the final lesion volume.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nAt 24\u2009h after injury, mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with saline, then 4% buffered paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution (Fisher Scientific). Brains were removed, post-fixed in PFA for 24\u2009h, and protected in 30% sucrose. Frozen brain sections (60 and 20\u2009\u03bcm) were cut on cryostat and mounted onto glass slides.\nAcute neurodegeneration\nSelected slides (20\u2009\u03bcm) were stained with Fluoro-Jade B (Chemicon), following the manufacturer's protocol. Imaging and analysis were performed as previously described,\n38\nwith some modifications, as follows: Image acquisition was performed using a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), at\u2009\u00d7\u200910 (Plan APO 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009NA 0.45 WD) with NIS-Elements AR software. Fluoro-Jade\u2013positive areas of the injured cortex were scanned using the same acquisition parameters and applying the \u201clarge-image\u201d and \u201cstiching\u201d tools. Images were analyzed with the Fiji image processing package based on ImageJ (\nhttps://fiji.sc/#cite\n) to quantify the number of Fluoro-Jade\u2013positive degenerating neurons. The same automatic threshold methods and cell-counting parameters were uniformly applied to all sections using the following Macro: [run(\u201c8-bit\u201d); run (\u201cAuto Threshold\u201d, \u201cmethod\u2009=\u2009RenyiEntropy white\u201d); set Option (\u201cBlackBackground\u201d, false); run(\u201cMake Binary\u201d); run(\u201cAnalyze Particles\u2026\u201d, \u201csize\u2009=\u200920\u2013200 show\u2009=\u2009Outlines display clear summrize add\u201d)]. For each brain, we selected three separate sections with the highest number of Fluoro-Jade\u2013 positive cells and added them to create a composite number representing degenerating neurons.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data have passed the normality test, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis followed by multiple pair-wise comparisons using the Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls (SNK) post-hoc test was performed using Prism software (version 6 for Windows; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Lesion volume and Fluoro-Jade B\u2013positive cell assessments were analyzed by one-tailed unpaired Student's\nt\n-test."

    "Methods": "Setting\nStudy sites were: Carolinas Rehabilitation in Charlotte, North Carolina (lead site); Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana (Indianapolis, IN); Kessler Institute of Rehabilitation (West Orange, NJ); Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital (Boston, MA); TIRR Memorial Hermann (Houston, TX); The Ohio State University (Columbus, OH); and University of Washington (Seattle, WA).\n\nStudy oversight\nInstitutional review board approval was received at each site, informed consent obtained from all participants and their observers, and the study registered on\nwww.clinicaltrials.gov\n(#NCT00779324). An external Data and Safety Monitoring Board provided independent oversight. A data coordinating center (DCC) managed the concealed treatment allocation, data storage, and data monitoring and, upon study closure, transferred the data to the statistician.\n\nParticipants\nRecruitment was through referrals, physician letters, and newsletters. Individuals were eligible if 16\u201375 years of age, sustained a nonpenetrating TBI at least 6 months prior to enrollment, and obtained a score \u22656 on observer-rated Neuropsychiatric Inventory\u2013Irritability. TBI was verified by record review and clinician interview as meeting at least one of the following criteria: 1) post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <13; 2) GCS Motor <6 off paralytics; 3) loss of consciousness attributable to TBI; 4) post-traumatic amnesia lasting \u226524\u2009h; 5) neuroimaging consistent with TBI; and/or 6) other evidence of TBI-related focal neurological findings. An observer (family member, close friend, or employer) with adequate interaction to observe irritability was required. Enrollment was further contingent upon medical and neurological stability, ability to comply with study protocol, negative pregnancy test, and creatinine clearance >60. Individuals were excluded if: 1) unable to interact and communicate; 2) threat of harm to self or other; 3) history of neurologic disorder, schizophrenia, or psychosis; 4) seizure in month preceding enrollment; 5) concomitant use of typical neuroleptic agents or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (because of potential drug interactions); and 6) amantadine ingested during the month preceding enrollment. All medications were on stable dosing for at least 1 month before enrollment with no plans to change medications during the 60-day study. Active rehabilitation therapies, behavior treatments, and counseling, if present, were started at least 1 month before enrollment, and none were started during the study. We did not attempt to record and compare groups on therapy involvement because both rehabilitation and psychological therapies may vary considerably in approach and quality among providers with no accepted method to quantify therapy impact. We relied on random assignment to control for this and other potential group differences.\nA sample of 168 was enrolled based on the sample needed to replicate the study of the effect of amantadine on the primary outcome (irritability).\n12\nFrom the 168 study participants, a subset of 119 was selected with significant cognitive impairment as indicated by two or more cognitive test scores at least 1 standard deviation (SD) below normative values. Of this subset, 59 were in the amantadine group and 60 in the placebo group.\n\nProcedures\nDemographic, medical history, and injury data were collected and verified through interview and record review. Measures of participant mood and behavior were administered to the participant and the participant's observer. Cognitive performance tests were administered by trained study coordinators and audio recorded for quality assurance review. After confirmation of eligibility and baseline assessment, participants were randomly allocated 1:1 to take amantadine (100\u2009mg every morning and noon) or placebo equivalent. In cases of presumed drug intolerance, the dose was reduced or terminated per pre-specified protocol. Participants and observers completed the assessment measures at baseline and treatment days 28 and 60.\n\nRandomization and masking\nThe DCC conducted computer-generated block randomization and concealed group allocation. After the site coordinators entered the participant's eligibility data into the study webpage and eligibility confirmed, the DCC assigned a study number that indicated which study drug kit to dispense. Randomization was stratified on presence of depression at time of enrollment (<13 vs. \u226513 on the Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]\u2013II)\n13\nbased on possible association of depression with irritability. The compounding pharmacist and DCC had access to group assignment; all other study personnel, participants, and observers were blinded to group allocation.\n\nMeasures\nA battery of neuropsychological measures with well-established psychometric properties was used\n14\u201319\n(see\nTable 1\n).

(Note: Due to a few missing values, the overall sample mean for each composite does not equal exactly 50.) The following indices were created:\nLearning Memory Index (LMI):\nComprised of the following California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) measures: Trials 1\u20135 Total Score (T-score), Short Delay Free Recall (Z score), Short Delay Cued Recall (Z score), Long Delay Free Recall (Z score), and Long Delay Cued Recall (Z score).\nAttention/Processing Speed Index (APSI):\nComprised of Digit Span (Scaled Score), Processing Speed Index, Trail Making Test\u2013A (T Score), Trail Making Test\u2013B (T score), and Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT; T score).\nGeneral Cognitive Index (CGI):\nComprised of measures in LMI and APSI.\nBaseline Cognitive Index (BCI):\nBaseline CGI.\nTreatment groups were compared on baseline characteristics and BCI. For ordinal variables, the normal approximation for the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used. For categorical variables, Fisher's exact tests were used.\nAnalyses were performed using the intention-to-treat principle. Pre-specified outcome analyses included: 1) comparison of the change in cognitive performance scores from baseline to day 28 and baseline to day 60 and 2) comparison of the change in cognitive indices (GCI, LMI, and APSI) from baseline to day 28 and baseline to day 60 using linear mixed-effects modeling, where each subject was modeled with a random slope and intercept, time was treated as categorical, and no other covariates were included in the models."

    "Methods": "The multi-disciplinary panel used to identify SRC CDEs was created using current and former SRC grantees from domestic and international governmental funding agencies, participant lists from international SRC guideline development, and lead personnel in SRC related organizations. A principal consideration was to include a diverse knowledge across academic backgrounds, sport, participant age, clinical expertise, and research methodology. During the planning of this project, two working groups were proposed with a recommended minimum of eight persons per working group. We assumed an approximate 50% acceptance rate to participate and developed an initial list of 35 invitees, including experts in both adult and pediatric SRC, from diverse training and expertise backgrounds that included athletic training, kinesiology, neurosurgery, neurology, neuroradiology, neuropsychology, physical therapy, physical medicine and rehabilitation, psychiatry, and general pediatrics.\n\nTo establish the SRC CDEs, the injury spectrum was ultimately divided into three Subgroups based on injury chronicity: 1) Acute, 2) Subacute, and 3) Persistent/Chronic. Acute SRC CDEs were identified based on typical clinical or research evaluations that would occur from the time of injury until 72\u2009h post-injury. This time frame was implemented to include delayed reporting and at least one clinic examination in most instances. Subacute SRC CDEs were identified as assessments that would occur between 72\u2009h and 3 months post-injury. This time period was used to focus more on clinical and laboratory measures typically used following an initial acute or on-field evaluation. Persistent/Chronic CDEs focused on common injury-related variables and data elements of interest that would occur during a post-injury interval of 3 or more months. This time frame specifically incorporated CDEs to address longer-term sequelae and accommodate studies with a developmental focus or studies that addressed potential long-term SRC-related neurodegenerative change.\n\nThe NINDS Program Directors selected chairpersons for each Working Group to lead discussions and coordinate specific tasks. The Working Group included members with expertise in both adult and pediatric populations. Members of each Working Group began by evaluating existing NINDS mild TBI/concussion CDEs. The initial screening was done independently by the group members prior to organized conference calls, with call time dedicated to achieving consensus on specific items wherea prioriconsensus did not exist. Following the review of the previously available CDEs, each member of the Working Group was asked for suggestions related to other tools/instruments based on his or her knowledge of the SRC literature and professional experience. Deliberations of each panel led to inclusion/exclusion and subsequent ranking of the candidate data elements for a specific context of use (e.g., to assess cognition during the first 72\u2009h post-concussion in adolescents) based on the evidence for the measure's utility in SRC populations, accessibility, psychometric characteristics (e.g., validity, reliability), ease of administration, and burden on the injured athlete. The following sections report the recommendations of the three Working Groups.\n\nFollowing the identification of all potential CDEs, the individual data elements were categorized into one of four categories of priority based on their evidenced-based support in the SRC literature and psychometric properties, a stratification consistent with the convention of other CDEs: Core, Supplemental\u2013Highly Recommended, Supplemental, or Exploratory.18A description of each category is provided inTable 1.\n\nWorking Group members attempted to streamline the recommended data elements to those with the broadest applicability and greatest utility in the SRC fieldper se. In other instances, new domains and data elements were suggested, reviewed, and recommended to capture additional areas of interest in this field, based on Working Group members' professional expertise and knowledge of the SRC literature. The Working Groups' recommendations reflected the position that when there was no recommended measure to address a given domain or construct, investigators would be encouraged to select additional data elements that best suited the research focus of their studies.\n\nFollowing the process outlined above, all identified CDEs were made available for public viewing and comment for a 3-month period between February and April 2017. The public was informed via email to investigators and listservs, as well as through national meetings where the public review period was advertised to clinical research investigators. The public review packet consisted of all the materials that were to be posted on the website, including summary tables of recommendations, template case report forms and recommended instruments for measuring various outcomes, and end-points. Following the public review period, the SRC Working Groups reviewed a compilation of suggestions and edits received from outside reviewers, which consisted of clinical and research experts in the field, patient advocates, and other stakeholders. These revisions were addressed with responses sent to public reviewers as necessary. Further review and revision of CDEs were encouraged on the NINDS CDE website via the feedback links on each page. On June 1, 2017, Version 1.0 of the SRC CDE recommendations were posted on the NINDS CDE website.19"

    "Methods": "Clinical material and methods\nThis prospective study included all TBI patients who had an initial computed tomography (CT) scan and underwent surgical evacuation of their BCs at our institution between January 2006 and July 2015. The brain specimens were obtained from surgically resected areas of the BCs that were stored in a biobank collection of TBI specimens at our institution (registration number C0002524 at the Carlos III Institute). The mean contusion volume at the time of evacuation was determined using the ABC/2 method.\n28\nAs suggested by Iaccarino and co-workers, in patients with more than one lesion, the volume of each contusion was calculated and then added to get a total contusion volume.\n1\nThe clinical outcome for each patient was assessed 6 months after the injury, using the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE), by an independent neuropsychologist blinded to the immunolabeling and western blot (WB) data.\nThe control group included tissue specimens obtained from limited brain resections of macroscopically normal brain, which were performed to access extra-axial skull base tumors or intraventricular lesions. These samples were included if the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans did not show any abnormalities in T1-weighted, T2-weighted, or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Our research was carried out in accordance with the ethical principles for medical research of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n29\nThis study and the tissue collection protocol were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Vall d'Hebron University Hospital (protocols PR-ATR-68/2007 and PR-ATR-286/2013) and written informed consent was obtained from all of the patients (including the controls) or the patient's legally authorized representative.\n\nCriteria for surgical evacuation of brain contusions\nAt our institution, patients must fulfill at least one of the following criteria to be considered for surgical evacuation: (1) for patients with intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, the ICP exceeds 20\u2009mm Hg and the total volume of a single contusion or multiple contusions exceeds the 25-mL threshold; (2) for patients without ICP monitoring (mostly moderate TBI), the total contusion volume (hemorrhagic and edematous components) is above the 25-mL threshold; (3) any temporal contusion that produces a significant mass effect and/or compresses the basal cisterns; and (4) contusions that induce a significant midline shift (> 5\u2009mm) despite having an ICP <20\u2009mm Hg. The surgical approach in non-eloquent brain areas is usually excision of the necrotic tissue with variable margins but without external bone decompression.\n\nBrain tissue collection\nAfter surgical resection, all of the specimens were immediately transported to the laboratory on ice. Using dissection material and phosphate buffer (0.2\u2009M), the cauterized and necrotic zones of the resected tissues were removed; excess blood and hematomas were also eliminated. Samples (the minimum size was 5\u2009mm\n3\n) were obtained from the processed tissue. The specimens with preserved anatomical structures were selected from areas of the resected tissue, corresponding to penumbral zones or the interface of the penumbra/core using the terminology described by Kurland and associates.\n2\nThe surgical samples were processed following different protocols. For WB analysis, specimens were rapidly frozen on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. For immunohistochemistry, samples were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 48\u2009h and cryoprotected using 30% sucrose solution. After cryoprotection, the specimens were embedded in Tissue-Tek optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (OCT 4583; Sakura Finetek Europe B.V., Alphen aan den Rin, The Netherlands) and frozen on dry ice. From these blocks, 10-\u03bcm-thick sections were obtained using a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S; Leica Biosystems, Heidelberg, Germany), mounted on glass slides, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until further analysis.\nThe MRI images of all controls were independently assessed by two of the authors (JS and JMS), who were blinded to the immunolabeling data. The tissue quality was evaluated in the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections by a neuropathologist (EMS), who was blinded to the immunolabeling data, using one scale for edema and another for signs of tissue hypoxia/ischemia (0: absent, 1: mild, 2: moderate, or 3: severe). The patients with edema and/or ischemia scores >2 were excluded as controls.\n\nWestern blot\nProtein extracts were homogenized by tissue lysis via sonication in ice-cold RIPA buffer (R0278; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). To avoid protein degradation, proteases were inhibited by a protease inhibitor cocktail (11697498001; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). After homogenization, samples were put on ice for 20\u2009min and centrifuged at 12,000\u2009rpm for 15\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant was used to quantify the protein concentration by the Bradford's method\n30\nusing bovine serum albumin as the standard (A2153; Sigma-Aldrich). Once the concentration was determined, 15\u2009\u03bcg of denatured protein (5\u2009min at 100\u00b0C) from each sample were loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, separated electrophoretically, and transferred in a tank filled in with 1x running buffer (Tris/Glycine/SDS; 161073; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. A standard molecular weight marker (Precision Plus Protein Standards-Dual Color; Bio-Rad) was included in a separate lane. The transferred membrane was incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight in blocking solution with a primary antibody (rabbit anti-Kir6.2 at 1:10,000; APC-020; Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel). Blocking solution was composed of 5% skimmed milk powder and Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-Tween-20; P9416; Sigma-Aldrich). Alomone's APC-020 is an affinity purified, polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against amino acid sequence 372-385 of rat Kir6.2, which is homologous to human Kir6.2. After washing in TBS-Tween-20 the horseradish peroxidase-labeled species-appropriate secondary antibody (A0545; Sigma-Aldrich) was applied at a dilution of 1:2000 for 1\u2009h. The blot was washed again in TBS-Tween-20 and then positive signals were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (RPN2232; Amersham Biosciences, Bucks, UK) and detected by a 30-sec exposure to radiographic films. The relative optical density of the resulting bands was determined by Quantity One 1-D Analysis Software v4.6.6 (Bio-Rad) and, for quantification, was normalized to the \u03b2-actin loading control. We tested whether there were some significant differences between \u03b2-actin concentration in contusion (optical density units; median: 1.2x10\n11\n; min-max: 0.6 to 30.4x10\n11\n) and controls (optical density units; median: 1.3x10\n11\n; min-max: 1.2 to 1.8x10\n11\n). The differences in actin concentration observed between contusions and controls were not statistically significant (Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test,\np\n=\u20090.11).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nBefore immunolabeling, to reduce autofluorescence, the samples were pre-treated by immersing the 10-\u03bcm-thick sample sections for 7\u2009min in 0.1% sodium borohydride (NaBH\n4\n) diluted in 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n31\nAfter this treatment, sections were incubated in a blocking solution containing 4% donkey serum (D9663; Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.2% Triton-X (T8787; Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in PBS for 1\u2009h and then overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibodies indicated in\nTable 1\n. Fluorescent-labeled, species-appropriate secondary antibodies (also indicated in\nTable 1\n) were used for signal visualization. The omission of primary antibodies was used as a negative control. Sections were cover-slipped with polar mounting medium containing anti-fade reagent and the nuclear dye 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; P36935; Invitrogen). Fluorescent signals were visualized using an epifluorescence microscope (BX61Olympus; Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).\nTable 1.\nAntibodies Used for Immunohistochemistry\nPrimary antibody\nDilution\nSupplier\nSecondary antibody\nDilution\nSupplier\nRabbit anti-Kir6.2; APC-020\n1:300\nAlomone Labs\nAlexaFluor\n\u00ae\n568; A10042\n1:400\nInvitrogen\nGoat anti-Kir6.2; sc-11228\n1:50\nSanta Cruz Biotechnology\nAlexaFluor\n\u00ae\n488; A11055\n1:400\nInvitrogen\nMouse anti-NeuN; MAB377\n1:100\nMillipore Corporation\nAlexaFluor\n\u00ae\n488; A21202\n1:400\nInvitrogen\nMouse anti-GFAP; C-9205, CY3 conjugated\n1:3000\nSigma-Aldrich\n\u2013\n-\n-\nMouse anti-Iba; 174429658\n1:100\nThermo Fisher\nAlexaFluor\n\u00ae\n488; A21202\n1:400\nInvitrogen\nMouse anti-CD31; M0823\n1:100\nDako\nAlexaFluor\n\u00ae\n488; A21202\n1:400\nInvitrogen\nOpen in a separate window\n\nAntibody validation\nTo avoid reproducibility problems, we validated our Kir6.2 antibody with some of the independent antibody strategies proposed by Uhlen and associates.\n32\nAs a first step, we conducted a comparative analysis between our antibody (APC-020; Alomone Labs) and a second one recognizing a different Kir6.2 epitope (GTX80493; GeneTex, CA). We performed a WB with both antibodies in the same specimens and compared the expression of Kir6.2 by the Pearson correlation coefficient (R\u2009=\u20090.88,\np\n=\u20090.049) as shown in\nFigure 1A\n. As a second validation method, we tested our antibody (APC-020; Alomone Labs) by immunofluorescence using a second antibody against Kir6.2 (G-16; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). We looked for an overlapping distribution of both antibodies, as shown in\nFigure 1B\n, to ensure accuracy. As the third validation method, we performed a WB using a fragment (amino acids 301 to 390) of the recombinant human Kir6.2 protein (ab114436; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) to demonstrate that Alomone's antibody recognized recombinant human Kir6.2 protein. A second recombinant protein of GFP (ab134853; Abcam) was used as a negative control. For this test, 1\u2009\u03bcg of protein was loaded per lane onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane that was incubated with the primary antibody from Alomone Labs at a 1:1000 dilution; the secondary antibody was applied at 1:2000. Positive signals were detected by a 1-min exposure to radiographic film. The results show that our antibody recognized the recombinant protein but not the tags, as shown in\nFigure 1C\n. Finally, to have a positive control, we decided to show the expression of Kir6.2 in a cell line of human cardiomyocytes (ScienCell Research Laboratories, San Diego, CA), because these cells express Kir6.2 constitutively.\n9\n,\n33\nAs shown in\nFigure 1D\n, the cardiomyocytes were strongly positive for Kir6.2.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nAntibody validation.\n(A)\nUpper images show the result of a western blot analysis of human Kir6.2 in five specimens of human brain tissue (lanes 1 to 5: 2, 4 corresponding to contusion specimens and 1, 3, 5 corresponding to healthy tissue) using two independent antibodies (Alomone Ab and GeneTex Ab). The bar graphs are shown as a visual aid for the inmunoblot results. Optical density with both antibodies was compared and resulted in a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.88 (\np\n=\u20090.049). The scatterplot is shown as a visual aid to the immunoblot results.\n(B)\nFluorescence labeling of Kir6.2 using Alomone Ab (red) and SantaCruz Ab (green); merged images in yellow.\n(C)\nWestern blot analysis of a human recombinant Kir6.2 protein (ab114436; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) (1) tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and GFP recombinant protein (2) used as a negative control.\n(D)\nKir6.2 expression (green) in a cell line of human cardiomyocytes (P10451; Innoprot, Derio, Spain) used as a positive control. Nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).\n\nCross-reactivity between Kir6.2 and Kir6.1\nTo demonstrate that our Kir6.2 antibody (APC-020; Alomone Labs) was not binding to Kir6.1, we conducted immunofluorescence labeling using our Kir6.2 antibody and a Kir6.1 antibody (APC-105; Alomone Labs) in adjacent sections of a mouse brain sample. The rationale for using mouse brain tissue is that Kir6.2 and Kir6.1 are compartmentalized in mouse brain (Kir6.2 expression is mostly located in neurons and Kir6.1 in astrocytes).\n34\nWe took immunofluorescence images from the same region of our samples using an epifluorescence microscope (BX61, Olympus), and we observed that Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 were labeling different zones and cells. Kir6.2 was restricted to neuronal structures, and Kir6.1 was restricted to blood vessels. Thus, the Kir6.2 antibody does not cross-react with the Kir6.1 epitope.\nWe also performed an experiment with a lysate of HEK293T cells that overexpress only Kir6.1 (NBL1-12174; Novus Biological, Littleton, CO) but not Kir6.2, to confirm that our antibody was not cross-reacting also with Kir6.1. We simultaneously ran two WBs where 15\u2009\u03bcg of the lysate was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. As negative controls, we used HEK293T cells transfected with an empty vector. One of the membranes was incubated with our Kir6.2 antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution and the other one with the Kir6.1 antibody at a 1:200 dilution as recommended by the manufacturer. Both secondary antibodies were applied at a 1:2000 dilution. Signals were detected by exposing the membranes to radiographic films for 1\u2009min. The results obtained showed that only the Kir6.1 antibody was detecting the HEK293T-cells lysate, as is shown in\nFigure 2B\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nCross-reactivity Kir6.2-Kir6.1.\n(A)\nStaining of Kir6.1 (green; APC-105; Alomone Labs) and Kir6.2 (red; APC-020; Alomone Labs) in the same section of mouse brain tissue. Kir6.1 shows labeling in blood vessel-like structures and Kir6.2 in neuronal-like structures. This shows that the Kir6.2 antibody does not cross-react with the Kir6.1 epitope.\n(B)\nWestern blot analysis of a lysate of HEK293T-cells transfected with an empty vector (lane 1) and HEK293T cells that overexpress Kir6.1 (NBL1-12174; Novus Biological, Littleton, CO) (lane 2). The membrane shown on the left was incubated with an anti-Kir6.1 antibody and the one on the right with an anti-Kir6.2 antibody. Only the Kir6.1 antibody was detecting the HEK293T-cells lysate showing that cross-reactivity does not occur between the Kir6.2 antibody and the Kir6.1 epitope.\n\nAnalysis of immunohistochemical findings\nQuantitative immunohistochemical analysis in neurons and endothelial cells\nTo calculate the number of Kir6.2-positive neurons and vessels, 4\u20138 captured 440x330\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nimages from the cortex were taken by the investigator with an epifluorescence microscope (BX61, Olympus) using DAPI as a guide. All images were quantified using the plug-in Cell Counter (Kurt De Vos;\nhttp://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/cell-counter.html\n) of the Image J program, v1.47 (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). This plug-in allows counting cells manually. The investigator clicks in the cell image and this method marks the cell with a colored square and adds the cell to a tally sheet. The percentage of Kir6.2-positive cells was calculated from the total number of neurons and blood vessels (NeuN/CD31-positive).\nSemi-quantitative immunohistochemical analysis in astrocytes and microglia\nTo evaluate whether Kir6.2 was expressed in these cells, specific antibodies were used (anti-GFAP and anti-Iba1, respectively). The whole section was quantified by two independent observers using a semi-quantitative scale to count: (1) the different cell types (0: absent; 1: scanty; 2: moderate; or 3: numerous) and (2) the Kir6.2-positive cells of each type (0: none; 1: in a few cells; 2: in many cells; or 3: in all or almost all cells). The inter-observer agreement (weighted kappa) was 0.83 (min: 0.78, max: 0.94). The statistical analysis was conducted using the average of the assigned scores from the two independent observers. To facilitate data interpretation, an example of the quantification in different cell types is shown in\nSupplementary Figure 1\n(see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n).\n\nControls\nThe tissue quality was evaluated in the H&E-stained sections by a neuropathologist (EMS), who was blinded to the immunolabeling data, using one scale for edema and another for signs of tissue hypoxia/ischemia (0: absent, 1: mild, 2: moderate, or 3: severe). The patients with edema and/or ischemia scores >2 were excluded as controls.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were obtained for each variable. For continuous variables, the mean, median, range, and standard deviation were used for normally distributed data and the median, minimum, and maximum values were used for non-Gaussian distributions. The Shapiro-Wilk test and the inverse probability plot were used to test whether the data followed a normal distribution. The percentages and sample sizes were used to summarize the categorical variables. To correlate two continuous variables, the Pearson correlation test was used for data that followed a normal distribution and the more conservative Spearman's rho was used if the data did not follow a normal distribution. For each marker, scatter plots were constructed with time as the abscissa and the percentage/score of positive immunolabeling as the ordinate. A simple linear regression and the ordinary least squares (OLS) method were used. Adjusted R\n2\nvalues were calculated for all of the models to test whether the linear or non-linear models adequately explained the relationships between both variables. The statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft R Open (version 3.4.2) and the integrated development environment R Studio (version 1.1.383).\n35\nThe car package was used for regression analysis.\n36\nTo calculate the inter-observer agreement between the two independent observers using the immunolabeling ordinal scales, we used weighted kappa with the routine implemented in MedCalc version 12.2 (MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium). Statistical significance was considered when\np\n\u2264\u20090.05. Data are presented graphically using box-and-whisker plots."

    "Methods": "Participants\nChildren who had sustained a TBI between the ages of 36 and 84 months (3\u20137 years) were recruited from a cohort of participants that were enrolled previously in a multi-center study of cognitive and behavioral outcomes of early childhood TBI (three sites: Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus, OH). The study prospectively evaluated child outcomes. Pre-injury functioning was assessed at an initial baseline visit (\u223c1 month post-injury) and current functioning was assessed at 6, 12, and 18 months post-injury. Additional follow-ups were completed two or more years post-injury (average 3 1/2 years) and when the child entered middle school (average 7 years). Only post-acute (12 month) and long-term (7 year) outcomes were examined in this study.\nThe Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and imaging findings were used to define TBI severity, as follows: mild as GCS score of 13\u201315 with associated computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging findings, moderate TBI as GCS score of 9\u201312, and severe TBI as GCS score of 3\u20138, with the former two groups combined into a single complicated mild-to-moderate TBI group (henceforth collectively referred to as \u201cmoderate TBI\u201d). The GCS score assigned to the child was the lowest one recorded. The initial study also recruited an orthopedic injury (OI) control group for comparison that was assessed at the same time-points post-injury as the TBI group. Inclusion in the OI group required a documented bone fracture in an area of the body other than the head that required an overnight hospital stay, as well as the absence of any evidence of loss of consciousness or other findings suggestive of brain injury. Exclusion criteria included histories of child abuse, neurological disorder, autism, or intellectual disability prior to injury, or a language other than English as the primary language spoken in the home.\nOf 213 participants enrolled in the original study, 135 provided DNA samples and were genotyped for the ANKK1 gene. Of those with genetic data, 15 had severe TBI, 50 moderate TBI, and 70 OI. The TBI and OI groups did not differ significantly in race, sex, age at injury, median family income, or level of maternal education (\nTable 1\n). Participants with genetic data did not differ significantly from those without genetic data in demographic characteristics or on other study measures.\nTable 1.\nParticipant Demographic Characteristics by Injury Group\nOI\nTBI\np\n(\nn\n=\u200970)\n(\nn\n=\u200965)\nGender,\nn\n(%)\n0.731\nMale\n36 (51.4)\n36 (55.4)\nFemale\n34 (48.6)\n29 (44.6)\nRace,\nn\n(%)\n0.563\nWhite\n53 (75.7)\n46 (70.8)\nNon-white\n17 (24.3)\n19 (29.2)\nAge at injury in years, M (SD)\n5.07 (1.08)\n5.21 (1.09)\n0.471\nMedian family income, M (SD)\n$60,736 (22,122)\n$59,332 (23,002)\n0.720\nHighest maternal education,\nn\n(%)\n0.172\n<High school\n5 (7.1)\n10 (15.4)\n\u2265High school\n65 (92.9)\n55 (84.6)\nGCS, M (SD)\n11.23 (4.42)\nOpen in a separate window\nOI, orthopedic injury; TBI, traumatic brain injury; M, mean; SD, standard deviation; GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale.\n\nDNA collection\nParticipants provided saliva samples for DNA extraction. The Oragene (DNA Genotek, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) DNA Self-collection kit was used. Saliva was self-collected by spitting into an Oragene cup. DNA was extracted using the manufacturer's recommended procedure. ANKK1 rs1800497 genotyping was analyzed using TaqMan (Applied Biosystems) assay.\nANKK1 rs1800497 did not violate Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (\np\n>\u20090.05). Genotypes were collapsed into either 0 (absence of the T allele, non-carriers) or 1 (homo- or heterozygous T allele[s], carriers). There were 46 carriers and 78 non-carriers. Participants who were carriers did not differ significantly from those who were non-carriers in demographic characteristics, with the exception of race (\np\n\u2264\u20090.01), or on performance on study measures (\nTable 1\n); however, this difference appears to be consistent with findings in the general population.\n\nMeasures\nChild EF\nTo assess behavioral outcomes related to attention and everyday EF, a parent-report of EF behaviors, the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF),\n37\nwas administered at all follow-ups. The BRIEF is widely used to assess behavioral manifestations of problems in EF in children following TBI.\n38\nParent reports at baseline were based on retrospective recall of the child's function prior to injury to control for premorbid differences. For study analyses, the Global Executive Composite (GEC) score was used as a dependent variable.\nFamily environment\nTo assess the quality of home environment, the Early Childhood-Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (EC-HOME),\n39\nwas administered at baseline. This instrument involved an in-home visit by an assessor who rated observed levels of parental stimulation and support for the child. Both objective observations of stimuli found within the home and discussions about child-related activities with parents were included in the scoring of the instrument. Domains assessed included learning materials, developmental stimulation, physical environment, and parental supportiveness. A total EC-HOME score is calculated by summing ratings across eight domains. Higher scores indicate greater levels of structure, stimulation, and support as rated in the home environment. Research has shown the EC-HOME to be a reliable and valid predictor of cognitive development in children that incorporates factors not wholly captured by socioeconomic status (SES).\n39\nTo assess self-reported parenting style, the Parenting Practices Questionnaire (PPQ) was administered at all follow-ups.\n40\nThe PPQ assesses self-reported engagement in three types of parenting styles: authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive.\n41\nThe authoritative parent directs the child in a rational manner, encourages give and take, and both autonomy and disciplined conformity are valued. The authoritarian parent shapes and controls the child in accordance with a set standard and often restricts the child's autonomy. The permissive parent allows the child to regulate his or her own activities, avoids control, and uses reason and manipulation, but not power, to parent the child. Permissive and authoritarian parenting styles are generally considered maladaptive, whereas authoritative parenting is considered effective. The instrument consists of 62-items presented in a 5-point Likert scale. We used the raw total score for each of the three dimensions to characterize parenting styles affecting the family environment.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.3. Separate general linear model analyses (SAS GLMSELECT Procedure) were used to examine the moderating effect of carrier status (presence vs. absence of T allele) on associations of the three parenting styles (authoritarian, permissive, authoritative) and quality of the home environment with post-injury developmental change in EF, at 12 months and 7 years post-injury. Separate models were developed for each of the environmental factors: the three parenting styles and home environment. The two time-points were selected to examine both short-term and long-term recovery effects from early TBI. We initially examined the highest-level interaction of carrier status, family environment, group (TBI vs. OI), and time since injury, as well as all lower-level interaction terms involving carrier status. A backward elimination technique was used to remove effects based on significance level until effects in the model were significant at the 0.1 level.\nConcurrent parent ratings of EF behaviors at the 12-month and 7-year follow-up were included in modeling the post-acute and long-term outcomes, respectively. Because baseline ratings represented pre-injury functioning, baseline EF ratings were included as a covariate in the models to control for pre-injury group differences in EF.\nInitial models controlled for race (white vs. non-white) and SES, defined as a z-score that combined parental education and median census track income by zip code. Models were trimmed using backward elimination and a\np\nvalue threshold of 0.1. Higher interactions terms were trimmed first, followed by lower interaction terms and individual variables. The main effects for carrier status, group, and family environment were included in all models. When a significant interaction involving carrier status was detected,\npost hoc\nanalyses were done to characterize interpretation of group differences in outcome at low and high levels of family environment (defined at the 10th and 90th percentile for the sample). TBI carriers and non-carriers were compared with each other and to OI carriers and non-carriers at each level of family environment. Therefore, interaction effects were examined in terms of variations in the effect of carrier status across injury groups and/or level of family environment quality.\nIn this exploratory study, the significance threshold was set at an alpha of 0.05 for interactions and main effects of interest despite multiple comparisons to reduce the risks of Type II error associated with tests of interactions in non-experimental designs\n42\nand because interactions were the primary focus of the study. Effect sizes were created by obtaining parameter estimates based on the final mixed model for each dependent variable and by standardizing all continuous predictors (M\u2009=\u20090, SD\u2009=\u20091) other than time since injury. The resulting coefficients are akin to standardized regression coefficients for continuous predictors and to standardized mean differences (e.g.,\nd\n) for categorical variables. Because standardized regression coefficients can be scaled to correlations,\n43\nwe used conventional definitions of effect size for correlations to characterize the magnitude of the standardized parameter estimates for continuous predictors and interactions involving only them (i.e., 0.1 is small, 0.3 is medium, and 0.5 is large). Likewise, we used conventional definitions of effect size for mean differences to characterize the magnitude of parameter estimates for categorical predictors and any interactions involving them (i.e., 0.2 is small, 0.5 is medium, 0.8 is large).\nBecause gene by environment interactions are the focus of the present paper, we report significant results only for main effects or interactions involving carrier status; significant findings involving the moderating effect of the family environment alone have been reported in other papers from our group.\n15\n,\n44"

    "Methods": "Design and participants\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at participating institutions including University of California San Francisco, San Francisco VA Medical Center, and VA Northern California Health Care System (VANCHS) Martinez. All participants provided informed consent prior to any of the study procedures taking place. Behavioral assessments and interventions took place at VA medical centers in San Francisco and Martinez.\nA total of 33 veterans of the Vietnam, Gulf War, and OEF/OIF eras with history of chronic TBI completed the study. Participants were primarily recruited from San Francisco VA and VANCHS-Martinez TBI Clinics. Inclusion criteria included history of chronic TBI (> 6 months post-injury) sustained either in combat or as a civilian; stable psychoactive medication regimen; self-reported cognitive difficulties in areas of concentration, planning, multitasking and memory that interfere with daily function; and interest/availability to participate in cognitive training. Exclusion criteria included: unstable medical, neurologic, or psychiatric conditions; psychosis, severe depression, anxiety, or PTSD precluding participation in research activities; ongoing illicit drug or alcohol abuse; or poor English comprehension. TBI diagnosis and severity was established using VA/Department of Defense TBI classification criteria, via review of participant medical records as well as detailed interview conducted by a clinician (neurologist or neuropsychologist) experienced in the diagnosis of brain injury.\nParticipants' average age was 43.3 years (standard deviation [SD] 11.57; range 25\u201366 years); 85% of participants were male, 67% of participants were white, and participants had an average of 14.45 years of education (SD, 1.82). A majority of participants (\nn\n=\u200919) sustained mTBI, with the remainder experiencing moderate (\nn\n=\u20097) or severe (\nn\n=\u20097) injury. The injuries sustained were from mixed causes including blunt injuries, motor vehicle accidents, and blasts. Eighteen participants reported experiencing multiple (i.e., more than one) TBIs. The injuries occurred at least 1 year prior to study participation (median time since injury\u2009=\u20096 years). All participants were independent in basic activities of daily living but reported continuing to experience mild to moderate difficulties on tasks involving organization, problem solving, multitasking, and distractibility. A majority of participants (\nn\n=\u200920) were not working or going to school. Seven participants were gainfully employed and six were students, but indicated having difficulties completing work and/or school tasks.\nAs shown in\nFigure 1\n, ten participants discontinued the study after either consent or baseline evaluations due to scheduling difficulties, change in medication, and/or family circumstances, and an additional two discontinued after starting the interventions due to illness and to a severe stressor (one after starting GOALS and one after starting BHE), leaving a total of 33 participants who completed the study.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nEnrollment information.\nConsecutively recruited participants were placed in small groups following completion of baseline evaluation (average group size: three participants), and the entire group was then randomized to receive either GOALS (\nn\n=\u200920) or an active comparison BHE training intervention (\nn\n=\u200913). BHE and GOALS were closely matched for therapist time and training intensity. Participants in the two intervention groups did not differ based on age (t\u2009=\u2009\u22121.59, df\u2009=\u200931,\np\n=\u20090.12), education (t\u2009=\u2009\u22121.20, df\u2009=\u200931,\np\n=\u20090.24), time since injury (t\u2009=\u2009\u22120.05, df\u2009=\u200931,\np\n=\u20090.96), gender (\u03c7\n2\n=\u20090.93, df\u2009=\u20091,\np\n=\u20090.34), ethnicity (\u03c7\n2\n=\u20091.59, df\u2009=\u20091,\np\n=\u20090.21), or TBI severity (\u03c7\n2\n=\u20092.39, df\u2009=\u20092,\np\n=\u20090.30).\nPre-and post-training, participants were evaluated with a multilevel battery consisting of neuropsychological and complex functional performance assessment and self-report measures of daily and emotional functioning. The assessments were administered by the same evaluator at both time-points, and every attempt was made to administer them at the same time of the day. Evaluators were blinded to participants' treatment conditions, and evaluators and therapists were separate individuals.\n\nInterventions\nGOALS training involved ten 2-h sessions of group-based training, three individual 1-h training sessions, and approximately 20\u2009h of home practice over 5 weeks. It was conducted in a small group format with two to five participants and two therapists per group. For a detailed review of GOALS training, see Novakovic-Agopian and colleagues.\n22\nThe GOALS intervention emphasizes two key components. First, regulation of distractibility (i.e., redirection of attention to goal-relevant processes and the filtering of non-relevant \u201cnoise,\u201d especially in the context of distractions) is addressed with attention regulation training. This aspect of the training emphasizes principles of applied mindfulness-based attention regulation to redirect cognitive processes towards task-relevant activities even when distracted. This requires identifying the current primary task, separating information into relevant and non-relevant categories, and working to selectively maintain relevant information while letting go of non-relevant information. Participants are trained in applying a meta-cognitive strategy (\u201cStop-Relax-Refocus\u201d) to stop activity when distracted, anxious, and/or overwhelmed; relax; and then re-focus attention on the current primary goal. They are taught to actively apply goal-directed attention regulation skills to a range of situations, from simple information processing tasks to complex multi-step problems and challenging low-structure situations occurring in their own lives. Training via in-class exercises and homework is applied to progressively more challenging situations, including holding increasing amounts of information in mind, culminating with maintaining information while exposed to distractors. Homework includes practice in maintaining goal-direction during challenging real-life situations identified by participants. At the beginning of each session, participants discuss their experiences completing the homework with the rest of the group.\nThe second major component of GOALS training involves the active application of these goal-oriented attentional self-regulation skills to the identification, selection, and execution of self-generated complex goals. Participants are asked to identify personally relevant and feasible functional goals (e.g., finding an apartment, looking for a job, writing a school term paper, planning a vacation) as individual and group projects. They are then trained in applying the goal management strategies on the functional task(s) of their choice. The step-wise meta-cognitive goal management strategies trained were modified from the Goal Management Training\n28\n,\n30\nand Problem Solving Therapy\n26\n,\n27\n,\n29\n,\n31\nprotocols. The main objective is to allow extensive practice and application of skills, thereby linking the attentional regulation directly to goal attainment efforts.\nThree individual sessions are distributed at the beginning, middle, and towards the end of the training. Individual Session 1 occurs after Group Session 1 or 2. It covers orientation to the training program, including orientation to and clarification of the Participant Handbook and discussion of the following: a) brainstorming feasible individual goals; b) common internal and external distractions encountered and potential solutions; and c) homework implementation (e.g., noticing absentminded slips in daily life). Individual Session 2 occurs after Group Session 4 or 5 and involves review and implementation of training strategies. This includes discussion of plans for individual and group projects, identification of challenges to project completion (e.g. anxiety provoking situations, procrastination), and discussion of successes and failures in homework implementation (e.g., use of Stop-Relax-Refocus in daily life). Individual Session 3 occurs after Group Session 6 or 7 and covers review and implementation of training strategies in daily life, and review of execution, obstacles, and adjustments required for individual and group projects.\nTo ensure consistency of administration, intervention manuals were written for instructors and participants (Instructor and Participant Manuals of Goal-Orientated Attentional Self-Regulation \u2013GOALS).\n23\nIf a session is missed, every effort is made for the participant to complete a make-up session.\nBHE training is an active comparison matched with GOALS for therapist time, homework load, and participation in a group. It involved ten 2-h sessions of group-based training, three individual 1-h training sessions, and approximately 20\u2009h of home practice over 5 weeks. It is conducted in a small group format with two to five participants and two therapists per group. The BHE training was designed to be engaging and provide information about brain functioning and brain health. Although session materials include information about sleep, diet, and effects of stress, they are educational in nature, emphasizing knowledge and not skills. Group leaders do not assist participants with making connections between the material presented and possible positive effects on their own daily functioning, or how to integrate into their daily lives. Further, the presumed active ingredients of GOALS training, which include applied problem-solving and attention regulation, are not part of the BHE intervention.\nIntervention manuals were written for instructors and participants.\n33\nParticipants were provided with a make-up session if a session was missed. Participants also were given up to 30\u201360\u2009min of daily homework between sessions (approximately 4\u2009h per week). Homework consisted of reading articles related to session content and watching DVDs about brain functions and health.\n\nMeasures\nParticipants were evaluated with a multi-level battery consisting of neuropsychological and ecologically valid functional performance measures of complex attention and executive function, and self-report measures of daily functioning at pre- and post-GOALS or BHE group intervention. Additionally, they completed self-report measures of emotional functioning. These measures were administered by the same evaluator at both time-points and every attempt was made to administer them at the same time of the day. Evaluators were blinded to participants' treatment conditions, and evaluators and therapists were separate individuals.\nNeuropsychological assessments\nSimilar to our previous studies,\n22\n,\n32\nthe current study used a neuropsychological battery specifically designed to assess performance in cognitive domains of complex attention and executive function that are commonly affected by TBI and targeted by GOALS training. Working Memory was assessed with 1) Auditory Consonant Trigrams,\n34\nrequiring recall of three consonants after counting backward by threes (e.g., 100, 97, 94, etc.) from a specified number for a variable amount of time, and 2) the Letter Number Sequencing subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition,\n35\nrequiring mental reordering of scrambled letter-number series of increasing lengths.\nInhibition of automatic responding was assessed with the Stroop Inhibition task (time and errors) from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS),\n36\nin which words are printed in dissonant ink color and participants are instructed to name the color of the ink instead of providing the more automatic response of reading the word. Mental Flexibility was assessed with 1) Trail Making Test-Part B,\n37\nrequiring rapid alternation between letters and numbers to connect them in order; 2) Design Fluency-Switching (DKEFS),\n36\nrequiring alternating between empty and filled dots while generating different designs using four lines; 3) Verbal Fluency Switching (DKEFS),\n36\nrequiring the generation of words that belong to two specified categories and alternating between them; and 4) Stroop Inhibition-Switching (time and errors; DKEFS),\n36\nduring which the participant is presented with words printed in dissonant ink color, some of which are contained in boxes, and the participant is instructed to name the color of the ink unless the word is inside the box, in which case they are to read the word. Sustained Attention was assessed using the Digit Vigilance Test\n37\ntime and error scores. A composite Overall Attention and Executive Function domain (primary neurocognitive outcome measure) was constructed using\nZ\nscores on measures from the Inhibition, Working Memory, Sustained Attention, and Mental Flexibility domains.\nParticipants' performance in cognitive domains commonly affected by TBI, but not targeted by the intervention, also was assessed as a marker of potential nonspecific changes. To this end, the neuropsychological battery also contained measures of verbal and visual learning and memory, performance on which may be indirectly affected by changes in attention and executive functioning. Immediate Recall was assessed with Hopkins Verbal Learning Test\u2013Revised (HVLT-R),\n38\nrequiring participants to learn 12 words presented over three learning trials, and with Brief Visual Memory Test\u2013Revised (BVMT-R),\n39\nrequiring participants to learn and reproduce six abstract designs over three learning trials. Delayed Recall was assessed with HVLT-R and BVMT-R Delayed Recall trails, requiring participants to recall the word list or figures after a 20\u201325\u2009min delay. A Memory composite score was created using the Total Recall and Delayed Recall scores. It is important to note that Overall Attention and Executive Function and Memory composite domain scores were not based on factor structure, but were constructed based on theory and authors' previous work.\nTo minimize practice effects, alternative test forms (DKEFS, HVLT-R, BVMT-R) and/or norms for repeated testing (Auditory Consonant Trigrams) were used for repeated administrations whenever feasible.\nFunctional assessment\nIt may be argued that the accurate measurement of executive control functioning requires observation and quantification of performance with real-life functional tasks that require planning, multitasking, and goal management in a low structure environment. To address the functional and ecological limitations of conventional clinical neuropsychological tests in characterizing executive dysfunction, we included a complex functional task assessment in the neurobehavioral test battery. (For further discussions, see Burgess and colleagues\n40\nand Novakovic-Agopian and colleagues\n41\n). The Goal Processing Scale (GPS)\n41\ninvolves the observation and rating of a participant completing a challenging task that engages executive control using a scoring system to quantify observations. Participants are instructed to plan and execute a task requiring them to gather and compare information about three different activities (or products/services, as designated on alternate forms) of their choice, using the available means while following specified rules in a limited time (30\u2009min). Participants work in an office equipped with a computer with Internet access, a telephone, yellow pages telephone book, blank paper, pen, calculator, and clock. They are given a task instructions page, which contains the key requirements of the task and the task rules.\nThe subdomains of executive function evaluated during the Planning stage include the ability to comprehend task instructions and ask for clarifications when needed, to decide on and identify realistic goal(s), and to organize and prioritize steps involved in actual task execution. After the task goals and plan are decided upon, the participants are told to execute the task on the basis of their identified plan and task rules. The domains assessed during the task execution stage include the ability to initiate task-directed activities; Maintain Attention on a task both in a non-distracting environment and during the built-in task distractions; Self-Monitoring of performance (including inhibiting task activities to stop at specified times, review performance, notice, and correct errors); Sequence and Switch attention between and among the identified task subcomponents; and demonstrate Flexibility in approaching alternate solutions when the situation changes (e.g., the ability to continue with specified task goals when the preferred means of obtaining information such as the Internet or phone becomes unavailable). Memory, including both the ability to recall strategies when needed and the ability to correct previously noted errors, also was assessed. The Execution score reflects the accuracy of completion of identified task goals and effectiveness of time management while executing steps relevant to the identified plan and goals. Functional performance in these domains is rated on a scale ranging from 0 (not able) to 10 (absolutely not a problem). The GPS Overall Performance Score (primary functional performance outcome measure) is the average of the seven subdomain scores.\nTo assist in rating of performance on the subdomains and to ensure rating consistency, the GPS Rating Instruction Manual operationally defines and calibrates the following: 1) the cognitive domains evaluated; 2) the task-based context; 3) the rating scale; and 4) the objective criterion-based scoring used for evaluation. For further information about the development and validation of this measure, see Novakovic-Agopian and colleagues.\n41\n\nMeasures of daily and emotional functioning\nParticipants also completed self-report measures of daily and emotional functioning. Participants completed the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 (MPAI-4),\n42\na measure of common sequelae of TBI including impact on activities of daily living, emotional adjustment, and community integration. The Goal Processing Questionnaire (GPQ),\n22\na self-report measure of post-training improvement in ability to plan and execute aspects of complex goal-directed behavior in daily life, also was completed (available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\n).\nLevel of psychological distress was assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS).\n43\nDepressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II).\n44\nSymptoms of PTSD were evaluated with the PTSD Checklist, Military Version (PCL-M).\n45\n\nPrimary outcome measures\nBased on theory and previous research, primary outcome measures were selected for each level of functioning assessed. Attention and Executive Function Domain Score was the primary outcome measure for neurocognitive functioning. The primary complex functional task performance measure was GPS Overall Performance Score. POMS Total Mood Disturbance was the primary outcome for self-report of emotional functioning, and MPAI-4 Total Score was the primary outcome for self-report of daily functioning.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were calculated for the neuropsychological, functional, and self-report variables for the whole sample and both intervention groups separately (GOALS and BHE). All analyses were conducted using SPSS Version 23.\n46\nAll neuropsychological test data were scored based on standardized age and when available, educational and repeated administration norms, and transformed into z scores for consistency. To assess the impact of training on targeted cognitive domains and reduce the variability and number of multiple comparisons, z scores for individual neuropsychological tests were averaged into the overall Attention and Executive Function Domain Score, as well as the following Memory Domain scores:\nAttention and Executive Function Domain Score primary neurocognitive outcome measure (average of z scores): Letter Number Sequencing; Auditory Consonant Trigrams 9, 18, and 36\u2009sec; Digit Vigilance Test\u2013Time and Errors; Design Fluency Switching; Verbal Fluency Switching; Trails B; Stroop Inhibition/Switching- Time and Errors; Stroop Inhibition\u2013Time and Errors;\nWorking Memory Sub-Domain Score (average of z scores): Letter Number Sequencing; Auditory Consonant Trigrams 9, 18, and 36\u2009sec;\nMental Flexibility Sub-Domain Score (average of z scores): Design Fluency Switching; Verbal Fluency Switching; Trails B; Stroop Inhibition/Switching\u2013 Time and Errors;\nSustained Attention Sub-Domain Score (average of z scores): Digit Vigilance Test\u2013Time and Digit Vigilance Test-Errors;\nInhibition Sub-Domain Score (average of z scores): Stroop Inhibition\u2013Time and Stroop Inhibition Errors;\nMemory Domain Score (average of z scores): HVLT-R Total Recall; BVMT-R Total Recall; HVLT-R Delayed Recall; and BVMT-R Delayed Recall.\nImmediate Recall Sub-Domain Score (average of z scores): HVLT-R Total Recall and BVMT-R Total Recall;\nDelayed Recall Sub-Domain Score (average of z scores): HVLT-R Delayed Recall and BVMT-R Delayed Recall.\nScores on GPS, BDI-II, GPQ, and PCL-M were analyzed in their original scales; POMS and MPAI-4 raw scores were converted to z scores.\nA 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to compare group performances on neurocognitive domain scores at pre- and post-intervention, and to compare within-group changes over time on neurocognitive domain scores (Attention and Executive Function, and Memory) for GOALS versus BHE (Aim A). Additional repeated measures MANOVAs examining changes pre- to post-training also were conducted for each group (GOALS and BHE) separately (Aim B).\nSimilarly, a repeated measures MANOVA was used to compare group performance on GPS functional task domain scores at pre- and post-intervention, and to compare changes over time for GOALS versus BHE (Aim A). Additional repeated measures MANOVAs were then conducted for each group separately (Aim B).\nSeparate repeated measures MANOVAs were conducted to compare changes in scores on measures of everyday and emotional functioning (raw-score measures BDI-II and PCL; z-score measures POMS and MPAI-4) for the whole sample (Aim C) and each group separately (Aim D). Finally, post-training GPQ scores were compared for the two groups using a single MANOVA.\nAlthough we have examined a number of cognitive domains and sub-domains, we report nominal\np\nvalues, without adjustment for multiple testing, consistent with our previous work.\n22\nSuch adjustments are focused on avoidance of one or more results with\np\n<\u20090.05 in the case where all differences are truly zero,\n47\u201349\nwhich is an unrealistic hypothesis about the state of nature in this context. In addition, adjustment would require that each result detract from the others, but there are clear relationships between the domains under study as they represent different levels of the same hypothesized constructs, and these permit coherent sets of findings to reinforce each other rather than detract from one another.\nIn order to demonstrate the strength and relative significance of our results, we report partial\n\u03b7\n2\n, which is a standardized estimate of effect size equivalent to the partial proportion of the variance in the dependent variable explained uniquely by the predictor divided by the proportion of variance explained by the other variables.\n50\nValues of around 0.01 are considered small, 0.09 is considered medium, and values of 0.25 and above are considered large.\n51\n,\n52"

    "Methods": "Experimental protocol\nTwo separate cohorts of adult male rats were used to acquire either: 1) longitudinal sensory-evoked (fMRI) data before injury and then at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after mild-to-moderate CCI (\nn\n=\u200911), followed by c-FOS histology in a subset of animals (\nn\n=\u20098) together with an additional seven injured rats at 5 weeks post-injury; or 2) longitudinal SEP electrophysiology recordings (\nn\n=\u20098) before and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after moderate brain injury. Pre-injury data served as control data. In addition, to control for any effects of experimental conditions on BOLD or SEP data, we first acquired data by stimulating the unaffected limb in order to confirm the expected cortical activation indicating optimal experiment conditions. As a result, low or absent activations elicited by subsequent stimulation of the affected limb could be attributed solely to the effects of injury and not to artifacts of experimental condition. All experimental procedures were approved by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nBrain injury\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (320-350\u2009g) purchased from Charles River Breeding Labs (Hollister, CA) were acclimated to standard housing conditions for 1 week prior to use. Throughout the study, rats were allowed access to food and water\nad libitum.\nBrain injury was conducted as described previously by our lab.\n17\u201320\nBriefly, following anesthetization with isoflurane (3% induction, 1\u20131.5% for maintenance) vaporized in oxygen flowing at 0.8\u2009L/min flow rate, the rat was placed in a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) and the scalp was shaved. Body temperature was maintained throughout the surgery using a thermostatically-controlled heating pad. After cleaning the scalp with alternating betadine and ethanol scrubs, 0.1\u2009mL of the local anesthetic bupivicaine was injected subcutaneously at the midline of the scalp before the skull was exposed via a midline incision.\nA 6\u2009mm diameter craniotomy was created using a dental drill with intermittent perfusion with sterile saline to prevent heating. A surgical microscope was used to expose the left hemispheric sensorimotor cortex 0\u2009mm from bregma and \u22122.5\u2009mm lateral from the midline. Injury was induced by controlled cortical impact (CCI) whereby a 3\u2009mm \u00d8 flat tip was advanced through the craniotomy tangentially onto the dural surface at 20 psi (1.3\u2009m/sec;\nn\n=\u20097) or 30 psi (1.8\u2009m/sec;\nn\n=\u20094) to a depth 2\u2009mm below the dural surface with a 250\u2009msec dwell time, resulting in a left-side injury focused over the primary sensorimotor cortex. Two speeds were used to induce mild-to-moderate injury in order to try to reproduce real-world variation in clinical injuries that are used in research studies. Injury severity was assessed in an unbiased automated fashion using quantitative brain atrophy measures (see below), which resulted in final subgroup assignments of five mild and six injured rats. An image was acquired through the microscope for all injuries for later verification of the presence of a subdural hematoma. The craniotomy was then sealed with a layer of non-bioreactive, Kwik-Cast silicon elasomer (Sarasota, FL) and the scalp was resutured and covered with a layer of bupivicaine local anesthetic solution and triple antibiotic ointment. Animals were placed in a recovery chamber with ambient temperature maintained at \u223c28\u00b0C until they had awoken from anesthesia and then returned to their home cages. No mortalities occurred due to acute post-traumatic complications.\n\nMRI\nA 7 Tesla Bruker MR spectrometer running Paravision 5.1 (Bruker, Billerica, MA) was used to acquire structural and functional data before and at weekly intervals after brain injury. Rats were briefly anesthetized with 4% isofluorane in oxygen flowing at 0.6\u2009L/min in order to administer medetomidine sedation (0.05\u2009mg/kg in sterile saline)\n21\nvia the penile vein. Following placement of a subcutaneous cannula and initiation of continuous infusion of medetomidine (0.1\u2009mg/kg/h), the rat was transferred to a purpose-built cradle and secured using 3-point immobilization of the head with two ear bars and a tooth bar. Respiration was monitored remotely and temperature was homoeothermic-controlled by forced air (SA11 Instr, Inc.). The S116 Bruker gradients (400 mT/m) were used in combination with a birdcage transmit and an actively decoupled receive-only surface coil to acquire the data. Following a multi-slice gradient echo pilot scan to optimize positioning within the magnet, localized shimming was performed on the head to improve B0 homogeneity.\nfMRI\nA multi-slice, gradient-echo, single shot echo-planar imaging sequence (repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20092\u2009sec, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u200930\u2009msec, no averages and using 14\u2009\u00d7\u20090.75\u2009mm thick coronal, slices with a 30\u2009mm\n2\nfield of view and a data matrix of 128 read by 64 phase-encoding steps) was used to acquire BOLD data during repeated electrical stimulations (10\u2009Hz, 3.5\u2009mA) of affected and unaffected forelimbs in separate experiments that each used an \u201coff-on-off\u201d block design repeated thrice, with each block consisting of 60\u2009sec off, 40\u2009sec on, and 60\u2009sec off. Limb stimulation was evoked through a pair of steel electrodes positioned subcutaneously while the rat was under the initial period of isoflurane anesthesia through the thenar and hypothenar pads on each paw, so that the electrode tips lay just distal to digit numbers 2 and 5, under pads 1 and 3, respectively. fMRI data acquisition began at 20-30\u2009min after the termination of the initial 10-min period of isoflurane anesthesia. After two runs of stimulus-evoked fMRI acquisition, isoflurane anesthesia was reinstated and detomidine infusion was discontinued.\nStructural\nA two-dimensional rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence was used to collect T2-weighted images with TR\u2009=\u20096018\u2009msec, TE\u2009=\u200956\u2009msec, and RARE factor\u2009=\u20098, and using the same geometry as used for the fMRI protocol, except a data matrix of 128-read by128-phase encoding steps. At the end of the imaging session, sedation was reversed using antisedan (1.0\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Rats recovered to the awake state and resumed exploratory behavior in their home cages within 2 minutes of this reversal injection.\n\nImage analysis\nfMRI\nData were weighted Fourier transformed to 128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128 and converted to compressed Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative format for entrance into the FEAT analysis pipeline.\n22\n,\n23\nFirst-level analyses were run after brain extraction, motion and slice timing correction, 5\u2009mm spatial smoothing, and a high-pass filter (100\u2009sec). Data were analyzed using the general linear model by fitting a hemodynamic response function composed of a square wave according to the stimulus protocol timing, convolved with a single gamma variate function to derive the temporal derivative waveform. Analysis was performed using temporal filtering and using FMRIB's improved linear modeling with pre-whitening while including motioning correction parameters in the model. Data were co-registered to a study-specific anatomical template using FLIRT\n24\nwith 12 degrees of freedom and a corratio cost function. Statistical maps were initially cluster thresholded at z\u2009=\u20091.7 and\np\n<\u20090.05 based upon pre-injury data showing the expected robust activation within the sensory-motor cortex. Higher level group analyses were run between baseline and post-injury data using FMRIB's local analysis of mixed effects\n25\nwith automatic outlier de-weighting and with contrasts cluster thresholded at z\u2009=\u20091.7 and\np\n<\u20090.001.\n26\n,\n27\nInitially, the T2-weighted images were used for segmentation of the contused from non-contused tissue using manual tracing based on the well-defined border of hyperintensity at 4 weeks post-injury. These were displayed as an overlap map after warping the data to a common template space using the transformation parameters obtained from the fMRI analysis. A more objective gray matter volume analysis was also conducted via tensor-based morphometry (TBM; see below) from the T2-weighted anatomical data at 4 weeks after injury and were used as a surrogate measure of injury severity for the fMRI analysis. These data were used as a covariate of interest to determine whether brain activation was modulated by the severity of the ipsilateral injury.\n\nTBM\nTBM was used to measure local volumetric differences on T2-weighted structural data pre-injury and at 4 weeks post-injury as an indicator of injury severity, implemented in a similar manner as before\n28\n,\n29\nwith the LONI pipeline.\n30\nEarlier post-injury structural data were not analyzed in the same way because temporary, acute time-point edema would confound the loss of brain tissue in a developing contusion. Briefly, following brain extraction of pre-injury and 4-week data with BET2,\n23\ndata were corrected for B1 field intensity correction using the nonparametric, non-uniform intensity normalization N4 algorithm.\n31\nA minimum deformation target (MDT) image was created by aligning all subject volumes to all other volumes using a mutual information-based, inverse-consistent algorithm, followed by applying the inverse of the mean displacement field from all subjects to the MDT.\nNext, image volumes in subject space were aligned to the MDT by nonlinearly deforming the anatomy of each image to the MDT, while optimizing the regularity of the deformation by quantifying the inverse consistent symmetric Kullback-Leibler distance between the MDT and the resulting deformation to allow for unbiased registration.\n28\nThe Jacobian matrices were derived from the displacement field calculated from each image-to-MDT template co-registration. The Jacobian determinant of the matrix is a univariate measure that represents the fractional volume change required to match the template image to each subject space, and represents relative tissue volume differences between each rat and the MDT. A gray matter region of interest was drawn on the MDT within the area encompassed by injury in all rats. Regions were warped to subject space to obtain mean gray matter Jacobian values for each rat as a surrogate for severity. Unsupervised k-means clustering (Matlab, 2011a; Mathworks) was used to classify individual values into different injury level subgroups. Correlation analysis of TBM values and activated voxel counts were conducted by Spearman's rank correlation.\nImmunohistochemistry\nc-FOS immunohistochemistry data were obtained using a previously published method\n18\nfrom eight rats used for MRI together with an additional seven injured rats at 5 weeks after injury (CCI; 20 psi, 1.4\u2009m/sec). Briefly, rats were continuously stimulated by electrical stimulation of the unaffected forelimb for 1\u2009h while under medetomidine anesthesia as for fMRI, following which they were kept in a quiet environment for a further 2\u2009h. Following terminal barbiturate anesthesia, they were transcardially perfused-fixed with saline and 4% paraformaldehyde, the brains were cryoprotected, sectioned at 50\u2009\u03bc, incubated with goat anti\u2013c-FOS primary antibody (#PC38; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA; 1:200), which was amplified using biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA; 1:500) and visualized using the diaminobenzidine reaction product. Eight mounted sections, 650\u2009\u03bcm apart were used to measure cortical gray matter (GM) volume/hemisphere and expressed as loss of ipsilateral cortical gray matter (ipsilateral GM \u2013 contralateral GM/contralateral GM\u2009\u00d7\u2009100) using Stereoinvestigator software (Microbrightfield Inc., Williston, VT). Unsupervised k-means clustering (Matlab, 2011a; Mathworks) was used to classify the GM loss data into the smallest number of groups based on the data through minimizing the variance within each group and maximizing it between groups. This resulted in two groups, which we operationally defined as mild and moderate injury severity, merely as indicated by the difference in loss of GM tissue, and not in reference to any type of standard severity level across the TBI field. The original eight rats were clustered into a mildly injured (\nn\n=\u20094) group and a moderately injured (\nn\n=\u20094) group, the same designation as for fMRI and an additional seven rats were classified as six mildly injured rats and one moderately injured rat. One mildly injured rat did not produce high quality c-FOS staining and therefore it was removed so that the total group size was nine mildly injured and five moderately injured rats.\nThree sections/brain, 650\u2009\u03bcm apart, were used to compute c-FOS density bilaterally within gray and white matter regions using Stereoinvestigator software (MicroBrightFiled, Inc, Williston, VT) interfaced to an M2 upright microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Group versus region cell density data were tested for mild versus moderate injury differences using linear mixed effects models with Dunnett's\npost hoc\nmultiple comparison for correction of multiple regions using a one-tailed test (R, version 3.13, packages lme, multcomp).\n32\nA one-tailed test was implemented since the\na priori\nhypothesis generated from the fMRI data was that an increase in c-FOS density would be found in moderately injured rats compared with mildly injured rats.\n\nSensory-evoked cortical recordings\nA parallel series of eight injured rats (CCI 30 psi, 1.8\u2009m/sec) was used to investigate the cortical sensory evoked potential before and after injury. Two electrode montages were used to cover the extent of the contralesional cortex. Montage A (\nn\n=\u20094) consisted of three stainless steel epidural screw electrodes of \u00d8\u2009=\u20091.19\u2009mm (including threading) over the anterior aspect of the forelimb sensorimotor cortex (SMC) at coordinates relative to bregma: (2.0, 2.0\u2009mm), (1.5, -1.0\u2009mm), and (4.0, -1.0\u2009mm). Montage B (\nn\n=\u20094) consisted of five electrodes that overlapped with Montage A, with electrodes placed at: (3.0, 2.0\u2009mm), (2.0, 0.0\u2009mm), (4.5, 0.0\u2009mm), (2.0, -2.0\u2009mm), and (4.5, -2.0\u2009mm). A reference electrode was placed midline in the frontal bone. A hand drill (model DH-1 holder, D#60 bit; Plastics1, Roanoke, VA) set to 0.8\u2009mm depth and diameter of 1.00\u2009mm was used to fine tune the depth and width of the smaller pilot hole so that recording electrode screws could be set into the skull with 1/2 turn or less. These precautions ensured that the dura was not deformed at any time throughout the drilling or electrode placement procedure. Insulated electrode leads were connected to gold-plated sockets within a plastic pedestal and dental acrylic was used to anchor it to the skull over the electrodes. The location of the skull that would later be removed for CCI injury was covered with silicon elastomer (WP Inst, Sarasota, FL) and a thin layer of dental acrylic for easy removal. Each montage was implanted one week prior to control recordings and 2 weeks in advance of CCI injury.\nSEPs were recorded using the MP150 Biopac system (Biopac Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA). Single and paired-pulse SEPs (PP-SEPs) were recorded over the contralesional cortex evoked by 2.0\u2009mA electrical stimulation of the unaffected forelimb using bipolar, 1\u2009msec square pulses, and while under the same medetomidine sedation as detailed before for the MRI study. The inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between pulses was varied between 30, 35, 40, 50, 100, and 200\u2009msec. One week after the pre-injury PP-SEP recording, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and the left side of the electrode headset was removed with a dental drill and CCI was performed through the left side of the headset as described above. The contused cortex and craniotomy was sealed with a thin layer of silicon elastomer and the headset was re-closed with dental acrylic. Further PP-SEP data was acquired at 3 days and 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks post-injury.\n\nSEP analysis\nThe first 23 of 35 acquired time-locked PP-SEP epochs of 350\u2009msec duration were averaged offline using the ensemble averaging function within the Acknowledge Software v4.1.1 (BioPac Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA). Peak amplitudes of the evoked response (N1) were measured from the baseline immediately following the first (stimulus A) and second (stimulus B) stimulus artifacts for N1A and N1B for each ISI at each time-point. The PP ratio was calculated as the ratio of the second response amplitude relative to the first (N1B/N1A) as a function ISI time. Data were averaged over all electrode pairs (three or five electrodes, Montage A and B, respectively) within each rat, and final data were obtained by averaging across all rats (\nn\n=\u20098). Peak latency, amplitude, and peak ratio data are shown as normalized to pre-injury values, and this was achieved on a per electrode, per rat basis prior to averaging within each rat over all electrode pairs, and then finally across all rats. Group univariate statistics were analyzed as peak latency and peak ratio raw data values compared with pre-injury using linear mixed effects analysis of variance (r version 3.3.2, LME function from the NMLE package) with Dunnett's\npost hoc\nmultiple comparison correction for multiple time-points. A one-tailed test was used based on the\na priori\nhypothesis arising from the BOLD data that increased excitability was anticipated at post-injury time-points."

    "Methods": "Patients\nEthics\nThe protocol for this study was approved by the National Research Ethics Service (NRES) Committee East of England\u2013Cambridge Central (REC Reference No. 11/EE/0463). Informed consent was obtained from all participants in the control \u201cnormal\u201d brain and muscle groups and assent from the relatives of those patients who had TBI. None of the patients in this study formed part of a previously published cohort. The study was performed in conformation with the spirit and the letter of the Declaration of Helsinki.\nTBI brain microdialysis patients\nNine patients with TBI were studied. Patients with TBI were defined as those who had cranial trauma with consistent computed tomography scan findings and required invasive intracranial monitoring as part of their clinical management. Placements of microdialysis catheters in patients with TBI were into white matter not close to focal lesions. Patients were treated per local TBI-management protocols (including the following in all patients: endotracheal intubation, ventilation, sedation, and muscular paralysis) as in a previous study.\n23\nControl \u201cnormal\u201d non-TBI brain microdialysis patients\nFive patients undergoing a craniotomy for the resection of a benign lesion whereby a microdialysis catheter could be placed safely into radiographically normal brain were selected as control subjects. The microdialysis catheter was placed via the craniotomy at the time of craniotomy under direct vision after resection of the benign lesion and tunneled under the scalp. The catheters were inserted at the edge of the craniotomy and directed away from the operative site into white matter; they came to lie approximately 2\u20133\u2009cm away from the area of brain from which the benign lesion had been resected. The control patients were awake for the duration of microdialysis perfusion.\nMuscle microdialysis patients\nFive patients undergoing resections of acoustic neuromas that required thigh fat and fascia harvesting for dural closure were recruited for studying resting muscle. Microdialysis was performed as before, with patients under general anesthesia for the duration of microdialysis perfusion.\n23\n\nMaterials\nCentral nervous system (CNS) perfusion fluid and T1 perfusion fluid, the compositions of which were described previously,\n23\nwere obtained from M Dialysis AB (Stockholm, Sweden). Sodium L-lactate (3-\n13\nC) (isotopic enrichment 99%, chemical purity 99%, microbiological and pyrogen tested MPT grade) 20% w/w in water was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Tewksbury, MA) and was formulated to a final concentration of 8\u2009mmol/L in CNS perfusion fluid (for brain) or T1 perfusion fluid (for muscle) by the Manufacturing Unit, Department of Pharmacy, Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust, who then tested the formulations to verify purity, sterility, freedom from endotoxins. and absence of pyrogenicity.\n\nMicrodialysis technique\nThe microdialysis technique and catheters (M Dialysis 71) were the same as before.\n23\nCatheters were placed into the right frontal white matter via a triple lumen cranial access device (Technicam, Newton Abbot, Devon, UK) in locations not close to focal lesions in the patients with TBI. Each patient received one microdialysis catheter, except for one patient with TBI in whom a left frontal catheter was placed via a craniotomy in addition to a right frontal catheter via cranial access device (\nTable 1\n). Catheters in the patients with TBI and the \u201cnormal\u201d (non-TBI) brain control subjects were perfused with CNS perfusion fluid supplemented with sodium 3-\n13\nC lactate (8\u2009mmol/L) at 0.3\u2009\u03bcL/min. In resting muscle, catheters were perfused with T1 perfusion fluid supplemented with sodium 3-\n13\nC lactate (8\u2009mmol/L) at 0.3\u2009\u03bcL/min. Microdialysate collection vials from the patients with TBI were changed hourly and analyzed at the bedside using an ISCUS analyzer (M Dialysis AB) employing enzymatic colorimetric assays for glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and glutamate. In patients with TBI, brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO\n2\n) data were collected using a Licox brain tissue oxygen sensor (GMS, Kiel-Mielkendorf, Germany) placed via the same cranial access device as the microdialysis catheter, and recorded at the bedside using ICM+ software (Cambridge Enterprise Ltd, University of Cambridge, UK).\nTable\n1.\nTraumatic Brain Injury Patient Demography\nTBI patient\nAge\nSex\nInjury mechanism\nInitial injury severity: GCS at scene/15\nClinical outcome\nLactate perfusion period start time (hours from injury)\nCatheter location (right frontal - RF; left craniotomy - LC)\nPbtO\n2\nduring unsupple-mented period and during 3-\n13\nC lactate perfusion (mm Hg)\nTBI 1\n51\nM\nFall\nE1 V2 M5\nMDU/GRL\n14\nRF & LC (2 catheters)\n\u2013\nTBI 2\n36\nM\nRTC\nE1 V1 M2\nSDL\n\u00a7\n34 & 60\nRF\n19.5, 29.3\nTBI 3\n17\nM\nRTC\nE3 V4 M5\nGRL\n18\nRF\n\u2013\nTBI 4\n48\nM\nFall\nE4 V4 M5\nSDL\n26\nRF\n\u2013\nTBI 5\n45\nM\nAssault\n\u2013\nVg\n*\n64\nRF\n\u2013\nTBI 6\n22\nF\nRTC\nE1 V2 M2\nMDL\n53\nRF\n\u2013, 23.9\nTBI 7\n24\nM\nRTC\nE1 V1 M5\nMDU\n83\nRF\n27.9, 26.0\nTBI 8\n47\nM\nRTC\nE1 V2 M5\nSDL\n37\nRF\n37.4, 31.4\nTBI 9\n64\nM\nFall\nE3 V4 M6\nD\n98\nRF\n20.2, 35.1\nOpen in a separate window\nM, male; F, female; RTC, road traffic collision; GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale score (E, eye opening; V, verbal response; M, motor response.

Other outcomes were from clinic.\n\nNMR analysis\nMicrodialysate sample preparation and NMR analysis were performed as before.\n23\nBrain microdialysate samples were pooled into 24-h periods for each patient. For NMR analysis, 20\u2009\u03bcL of deuterium oxide (D\n2\nO) and 50\u2009\u03bcL internal reference standard from a stock solution of 24.0\u2009mmol/L 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propanesulfonic acid sodium salt (also termed 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt or 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate sodium salt; DSS) in CNS perfusion fluid were added to 180\u2009\u03bcL of the pooled microdialysate sample. Muscle microdialysate samples were pooled into 8-h periods for each patient, these shorter periods (compared with 24-h pool for each brain patient) being because of clinical constraints. Then 20\u2009\u03bcL of D\n2\nO and 70\u2009\u03bcL from a stock solution of 2.84\u2009mmol/L DSS were added to 120\u2009\u03bcL of the pooled microdialysate sample. Pooled samples, after addition of D\n2\nO and DSS, were stored at \u221280\u00b0C. For NMR analysis, samples were transferred into 3\u2009mm NMR tubes (Hilgenberg GmbH, Malsfeld, Germany). All chemical shifts were referenced to DSS\u2009=\u2009zero ppm (Hz per MHz) in the NMR spectra.\nThe\n13\nC and\n1\nH NMR spectra were acquired as described previously\n23\non a Bruker Avance III HD 500\u2009MHz spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) with a dual\n13\nC/\n1\nH cryoprobe (CP DUL500C/H, Bruker BioSpin GmbH), and TopSpin software (Bruker GmbH). using the pulse programs noesypr1d and zgpg30 for\n1\nH and\n13\nC spectra, respectively.\n23\nThese are detailed\nSupplementary Methods\n(see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n). Because of the small sample size of the microdialysates, which necessitated long acquisition times to achieve adequate sensitivity, it was impracticable to run fully relaxed spectra without nuclear Overhauser enhancement. Therefore, we undertook detailed calibration of the signal intensities for each carbon position within the glutamine molecule (see paragraph below on quantification).\nInterpretation of the NMR results was based on biosynthetic pathways summarized schematically in\nFigure 1\n, which shows the glutamine labeling patterns corresponding to TCA cycle metabolism of lactate. To summarize, 3-\n13\nC lactate is metabolized via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) to 4-\n13\nC glutamine on the first turn of the TCA cycle and to equal amounts of 2-\n13\nC glutamine and 3-\n13\nC glutamine on the second turn of the TCA cycle. When 3-\n13\nC lactate is metabolized via pyruvate carboxylase (PC), 2-\n13\nC glutamine is produced on the first turn of the TCA cycle.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic of\n13\nC labeling patterns derived from 3-\n13\nC lactate. 3-\n13\nC lactate is metabolized to 3-\n13\nC pyruvate, which then enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle via conversion to 2-\n13\nC acetyl CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) or via pyruvate carboxylase (PC) to 3-\n13\nC oxaloacetate. 2-\n13\nC acetyl CoA is metabolized to citrate, isocitrate, and then to 4-\n13\nC \u03b1-ketoglutarate where it can then spin out as 4-\n13\nC glutamate, which is then converted to 4-\n13\nC glutamine. Consequently 4-\n13\nC glutamine is produced on the first turn of the TCA cycle. If 4-\n13\nC \u03b1-ketoglutarate remains within the TCA cycle, it is metabolized to equal proportions of 2-\n13\nC malate and 3-\n13\nC malate because of \u201crandomization\u201d of label in the fumarate to malate step, because fumarate is a symmetrical molecule whereas malate is asymmetric. If malate continues within the TCA cycle, equal amounts of 2-\n13\nC glutamine and 3-\n13\nC glutamine are produced on the \u201csecond turn\u201d of the TCA cycle. When 3-\n13\nC lactate is metabolized via PC to 3-\n13\nC oxaloacetate, 2-\n13\nC \u03b1-ketoglutarate is produced, which results in 2-\n13\nC glutamine produced on the \u201cfirst turn\u201d of the TCA cycle. For the labeling patterns of the second turn, we have assumed for schematic illustration that the incoming second acetyl-CoA molecule is not enriched with\n13\nC. These patterns were consistent with our observations; see\nResults\nsection and\nSupplementary Table 2\n. Colored filled circles indicate position of\n13\nC atoms within molecules. Red indicates entry via PDH into the TCA cycle, first turn, and purple for second turn; yellow indicates entry via PC, first turn.\nQuantification of glutamine isotopomers was performed with the same methodology used previously.\n24\nCalibration curves were constructed using glutamine standards of varying concentration prepared in CNS perfusion fluid with the same fixed concentration of D\n2\nO and DSS used for the preparation of brain microdialysate samples and run under identical NMR conditions. The peak areas (measured using TopSpin software) of the glutamine\n13\nC NMR signals in the microdialysate samples relative to the DSS internal standard were used with reference to the calibration curves to calculate\n13\nC concentration. Notably, the\n13\nC NMR signals of each of the glutamine carbon positions (C2, C3, C4) were individually calibrated, thereby taking into account the different strengths of nuclear Overhauser enhancement effect at these individual positions. Peak areas of the\n1\nH NMR spectra fitted using Chenomx software (Chenomx Inc, Edmonton, Canada) were used to calculate\n12\nC concentration.\nFractional enrichment (%) is defined as 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009[\n13\nC] / ([\n13\nC] + [\n12\nC]) where square brackets indicate concentrations of the relevant species. [\n13\nC] was determined from the\n13\nC NMR spectra and [\n12\nC] from the\n1\nH spectra. Natural abundance of\n13\nC is 1.1% of all carbon atoms, and\n13\nC fractional enrichment values for glutamine were expressed after subtracting this naturally occurring\n13\nC background from the\n13\nC singlet signals.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS21 for Mac (IBM SPSS Statistics, NY). Changes of ISCUS microdialysis parameters between baseline and 3-\n13\nC lactate perfusion periods were assessed for statistical significance with Wilcoxon signed rank test with a preselected\np\nvalue of 0.05 for statistical significance. Student paired\nt\ntest (StatView 5, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used additionally for corroboration. Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest (on SPSS21) was used to compare glutamine fractional enrichment between TBI and normal brain microdialysates."

    "Methods": "Study design, data source, and patient population\nThis is a cross-sectional cohort study using prospectively collected data from the TRACK-TBI Pilot study. The TRACK-TBI Pilot study protocol has been previously described in detail.\n32\nBriefly, the TRACK-TBI Pilot study was a prospective observational cohort study that enrolled 586 patients with TBI across the spectrum of age and TBI severity who presented to the emergency department (ED) of one of the three participating Level 1 trauma centers within 24\u2009h of head trauma sufficient to warrant evaluation with a non-contrast head CT according to the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP)/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) evidence-based joint practice guidelines.\n33\nPatients underwent extensive baseline assessments using National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke TBI Common Data Elements (CDEs).\n34\nAdditional inclusion criteria for TRACK-TBI Pilot included age 16 years and older and ability to provide informed consent either independently or via a proxy. Patients were excluded if they were non-English speaking, pregnant, in custody, undergoing psychiatric evaluation, had contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or had pre-existing medical or neurological conditions that would interfere with evaluation of TBI (such as pre-existing dementia or severe psychiatric illness). All patients or their legal authorized proxies provided written informed consent.\nOf note, while TRACK-TBI Pilot enrolled 586 patients, only 183 patients had sufficient quantity of blood drawn within 24 hours of injury for measurement of the proteomic biomarkers analyzed in this study. Of these 183 patients, 169 presented with a GCS score of 13-15 and 14 (\nn\n=\u20097 age <40 years;\nn\n=\u20095 age 40\u201359 years;\nn\n=\u20092 age 60 years+) presented with a GCS score \u226412. Given the small number of patients with moderate-to-severe TBI (defined as a GCS score \u226412) that would have precluded investigation of the role of TBI severity on the performance of these proteomic biomarkers as well as our stated aim to investigate the performance of these assays in the population at highest risk for inappropriate triage and delays in care (e.g., older adults presenting with a GCS score of 13-15), we excluded the 14 TRACK-TBI Pilot patients who presented with a GCS score \u226412 who otherwise had analyzable proteomic biomarker data. Thus, for the present analysis, a sub-set of TRACK-TBI Pilot participants were included if they: 1) presented with mTBI defined as a GCS score of 13-15 upon arrival to the ED; 2) consented to blood draw; and 3) had sufficient quantity of blood drawn within 24\u2009h of injury for the measurement of the proteomic biomarkers analyzed in this study (\nn\n=\u2009169). Compared with the 417 TRACK-TBI Pilot patients excluded from this study, the patients included in this study did not significantly differ in age, education, sex, race, or ethnicity. This study was approved by the University of California San Francisco committee for human research.\n\nBaseline demographics and pre-existing medical conditions\nData about baseline patient characteristics were collected from the patient or proxy via a medical interview and chart review. These data included: patient age, years of education, sex, race, ethnicity, and baseline medical comorbidities (prior history of TBI before incident TBI, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, tobacco use, alcohol use, illicit drug use, depression/anxiety).\n\nCharacterization of TBI\nGCS score was determined by a physician upon arrival to the ED. Additional details about mechanism of injury and whether the patient required a neurosurgical procedure while in the hospital were recorded by trained study staff in the ED via patient or proxy interview and chart review.\n\nHead CT\nA single board-certified neuroradiologist (ELY), blinded to demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical data (except age and sex), reviewed each head CT and scored evidence of acute intracranial trauma according to expert consensus recommendations of the TBI CDE Neuroimaging Working Group.\n35\nFor this study, evidence of acute intracranial trauma (i.e., CT+) was defined as presence of at least one of the following: epidural hemorrhage (EDH), subdural hemorrhage (SDH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), brain contusion, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), traumatic or diffuse axonal injury (TAI/DAI), midline shift >5\u2009mm, partial or complete effacement of basal cisterns, or cerebral edema. CT- was defined as having none of these aforementioned findings. Additionally, intra-parenchymal injury was defined as contusion, ICH, TAI/DAI, or edema; extra-parenchymal injury, as EDH, SDH, SAH, or IVH.\n\nPlasma assays\nAll blood samples were obtained within 24\u2009h of injury. Details of sample collection, storage, and GFAP and tau assay performance have been described previously in detail.\n23\n,\n26\nBriefly, sample collection and storage at each site were performed according to the TBI CDE Biospecimens and Biomarkers Working Group Guidelines.\n36\nWhole blood was collected into K2-EDTA blood tubes. Plasma was extracted after centrifugation for 5\u2009min at 3000\u2009g, pipetted into 0.5-1.0\u2009mL aliquots in polypropylene tubes, and stored at -80\u00b0C until they were shipped overnight via courier service to the biomarker analysis site. All samples were de-identified and thus all assays were performed blinded to patient characteristics and head CT findings.\nP-tau and T-tau levels in each sample were assayed in triplicate via enhanced immunoassay using multi-arrayed fiberoptics (EIMAF) conjugated with rolling circle amplification (a-EIMAF) as described previously in detail by Rubenstein and colleagues.\n26\nIntra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) for P-tau and T-tau were 3.5% and 5.5%, respectively. Inter-assay CV for P-tau and T-tau were 7.0% and 5.2%, respectively. Lower limit of detection (LLOD) for P-tau and T-tau are 0.00001 fg/mL and 0.0001 fg/mL, respectively. GFAP level in each sample was measured in duplicate using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to GFAP-BDP that detected both whole GFAP molecules and GFAP-BDPs, thereby achieving a more complete measure of circulating GFAP levels\n37\nas previously described in detail by Okonkwo and colleagues.\n23\nIntra-assay CV for GFAP was 4.3-7.8%. Inter-assay CV for GFAP was 7.8-14.3%. Estimated LLOD for GFAP was 0.10\u2009ng/mL; samples with undetectable levels were assigned a value of 0.03\u2009ng/mL.\n23\n,\n25\n\nStatistical analysis\nAnalyses were conducted using Stata 15. Patients were categorized as young (age <40 years), middle-aged (age 40\u201359 years), or older (age 60 years+). The definition of \u201colder adult\u201d varies widely in the published literature. We chose to define older adult as those age \u226560 years, rather than \u226565 years because there were only 16 patients age \u226565 years in our cohort.\nBaseline demographics, pre-existing conditions (including prior TBI and anticoagulant use), TBI characteristics, and CT findings (e.g., acute intracranial trauma) were compared across age categories using summary statistics including chi-squared tests for categorical variables and analysis of variance for continuous variables. P-tau, T-tau, P-tau:T-tau ratio, and GFAP were not normally distributed. Correlations between assays were assessed using Spearman rank-order correlations, comparisons of assay levels across the three age categories were conducted using tests of trend, and comparisons of assay levels by CT findings were conducted using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. We used linear regression to assess for an association between each assay and age in both unadjusted models and models adjusted for CT findings and time from injury to blood draw.\nWe used logistic regression to assess the association of each assay with CT findings in the entire cohort. We determined whether an interaction with age category was present. We visualized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for diagnostic accuracy of each assay individually, and of the tau assay with highest accuracy (by AUC) plus GFAP in combination, to identify CT findings by age category. We used chi-squared tests to assess for statistically significant differences in the AUC by age category. Based on the ROC curve for each assay for the entire pooled cohort, we identified the point on the ROC curve nearest to the point with perfect sensitivity and specificity [0,1] in order to estimate an optimal cut point for each plasma assay to discriminate patients with versus without intracranial trauma on CT. For each cut-point, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using 100 bootstrap samples. We then determined the sensitivity and specificity of the identified optimal cut-point for each assay for diagnosis of CT findings for patients in each age category. Statistical significance was defined as\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nOne hundred and sixteen adult male C57BL/6 mice (pre-injury weight 25\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7\u2009g; Taconic, Denmark) were housed in groups of six per cage, with access to food and water\nad libitum,\non a 12\u2009h light/dark cycle. The animals were housed in the animal care facility for a minimum of seven days before any experiments. All experiments were approved by the Uppsala County Animal Ethics board and followed the regulations of the Swedish Animal Welfare Agency.\n\nSurgical procedure\nMice were subjected randomly to sham injury (\nn\n=\u200938) or central fluid percussion brain injury (cFPI;\nn\n=\u200978). Based on previous results in TBI models showing early oligodendrocyte death and transient OPC proliferation with a peak at seven days post-injury,\n10\n,\n16\nthree survival end-points were used; two days post-injury (dpi), seven dpi, and 14\u2009dpi. The cFPI protocol was adapted to mice and used in the present report as described previously.\n16\n,\n30\nAnesthesia (4% isoflurane in air) was induced in a chamber, and the animals were then moved to a stereotaxic frame where anesthesia was maintained through a nosecone delivering isoflurane 1.2% and N\n2\nO/O\n2\n70/30% and spontaneous breathing. The scalp was shaved and cleaned with ethanol, and bupivacaine 2.5\u2009mg/mL (Marcaine\n\u00ae\n, AstraZeneca, Sweden) was applied subcutaneously. A midline incision was made and the skull exposed.\nA 3.0\u2009mm diameter craniotomy was made in the midline between bregma and lambda sutures, carefully leaving the underlying dura intact. A dural breach was an exclusion criterion. A plastic cap was attached over the craniotomy using dental cement (HeraeusKulzer GmbH, Hanau, Germany). Saline was added into the cap, and any signs of saline leakage were noted. If the seal was intact, the saline cap was attached to the Luer-Lock on the fluid percussion device (VCU Biomedical Engineering Facility, Richmond, VA). The injury was produced by releasing the fluid percussion pendulum striking a saline-filled cylinder creating a pressure wave transmitted into the closed cranial cavity. A transducer measured the pressure pulse and the pressure peak noted in pressure by square inch (psi).\nImmediately after the injury, an apnea was noted, and when spontaneous breathing resumed, anesthesia was resumed. An apnea >60\u2009sec was used as an exclusion criterion. The cement and cap were removed and the bone flap replaced over the craniotomy and the skin sutured using resorbable sutures. The animal was placed in a separate cage until fully recovered from anesthesia. Animal weight was recorded for a minimum of three days after the injury. If weight loss more than 10% was noted, the animal was sacrificed and excluded from the study. Sham-injured animals were subjected to an identical procedure as the cFPI animals except that the pendulum was not released.\nAll animals were sacrificed by an intraperitoneal (ip) overdose of sodium pentobarbital (pentobarbital natrium 60\u2009mg/mL, VET ATL, Apoteket, Sweden; 200\u2009mg/kg. Cardiac perfusion was performed using 4% formaldehyde (formaldehyde 4% Fosfatbuffrad, HistoLab Products AB, Gothenburg), and the brains were removed rapidly from the cranium, placed in formaldehyde for 24\u2009h, and then placed in 30% sucrose solution for 72\u2009h until snap frozen in isopentane and stored at \u221270\u00b0C until sectioned.\n\nEdU and IL-1\u03b2 neutralizing antibody administration\nThe IL-1\u03b2 neutralizing antibody (IL-1\u03b2; 300\u2009\u03bcg/dose) or control anti-cyclosporinA mlgG2a (CsA; 500\u2009\u03bcg/dose), kindly provided by Novartis, Inc., Basel, Switzerland, was administered ip 30\u2009min after sham injury or cFPI for all evaluated groups. The 14\u2009dpi group received a second dose at seven dpi. The CsA control antibody is directed toward unnatural amino acids of a fungal peptide, and no pharmacological activity is expected because there is no cross-reaction with mammalian epitopes. Several previous studies used this treatment regime, suggested by the manufacturer, and observed brain penetration of the antibody and improved behavioral and histological outcome in different TBI models.\n27\u201329\nTo study OPC proliferation, 50\u2009mg/kg of 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (EdU)\n31\n,\n32\nwas administrated ip after sham injury or cFPI. The two dpi group received one dose of EdU 24\u2009h post-injury. The seven dpi group received six doses of EdU 24\u2009h post-injury until 24\u2009h before sacrifice. The 14\u2009dpi group received six doses of EdU days 8\u201313 post-injury.\n\nTissue preparation and image processing\nA sliding microtome (SM 2000R; Leica, Nusstoch, Germany) was used to make 20\u2009\u03bcm thick coronal sections. All sections were collected and placed in cryoprotectant buffer (30% glycerin, 30% ethylenglycerol, and 40% 1x phosphate buffered saline [PBS]) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Images for quantification were captured using a bright field and fluorescent microscope system, Zeiss Axiovision (Carl Zeiss Inc. Gottingen, Germany). Quantification was made from\u2009\u00d7\u200920 images (138.79\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009103.99\u2009\u03bcm). Co-localization studies (EdU/Olig2/4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole [DAPI], cleaved caspase-3/MOG/DAPI) and microglia/macrophage stainings were studied by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning microscope; Carl Zeiss Inc. Gottingen. Germany), and ZEN 2012 blue edition software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany) was used for image processing.\nAll quantifications were made by an observer blinded to type of injury and treatment. The number of cleaved caspase-3 positive stainings was quantified from one image (138.79\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009103.99\u2009\u03bcm) of the corpus callosum from three levels per animal (\u22121.5, \u22122.0, and \u22122.5\u2009mm from bregma). The corpus callosum was outlined using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Washington, DC) and then converted to a 32-bit grayscale image and threshold was set. The number of cleaved caspase-3 positive stainings was estimated using the ImageJ software particle analysis.\nThe number of OLs, defined as labeled by the oligodendrocyte-specific marker CC1, in the corpus callosum and external capsule, \u22121.5, \u22122.0, and \u22122.5\u2009mm form bregma, was quantified using the ImageJ software. One image from the corpus callosum and four images from the external capsule were analyzed from each level by converting the images to 32-bit grayscale images, setting threshold, and measuring the number of cells positive for CC1 staining by particle analysis in ImageJ, as described previously.\n13\nThe corpus callosum and external capsule were outlined in each image, and only the cells within the outline were included in the analysis. The number of cells in the four images of the external capsule was added together, results presented as cells/mm\n2\n, and total number of cells from all three levels included.\nAll cells positive for EdU in the corpus callosum, external capsule, and fimbriae were photographed in three levels, \u22121.5, \u22122.0, and \u22122.5\u2009mm from bregma, for each animal. EdU/DAPI and EdU/Olig2/DAPI positive cells were counted, and results are presented as cells/mm\n2\n.\nIn situ\nhybridization was performed to co-localize EdU positive cells with Olig2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcripts and the nuclear marker DAPI. Ten RNAOlig2/EdU/DAPI positive cells from the corpus callosum and external capsule at \u22122.0\u2009mm from bregma were analyzed in\u2009\u00d7\u200963 magnification. All Olig2 RNA transcripts, where each dot in the image corresponds to one single RNA transcript, were counted in three animals per group by an observer blinded to the injury and treatment status of the animals. Co-localization of cleaved caspase-3/MOG (myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprotein) was also made with\nin situ\nhybridization to confirm apoptotic OLs.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nCleaved caspase-3 staining and staining for CC1 positive mature OLs was used to study OL cell loss. Sections were placed in 1x PBS +0.1% triton and washed 3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min. The sections were then blocked with 5% normal goat serum in 1x PBS +0.1% triton at room temperature for 1\u2009h. The sections were placed in 0.3% triton in 1x PBS at 80\u00b0C for 20\u2009min and then citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 20\u2009min at 80\u00b0C and washed again. The primary antibody (anti-cleaved caspase-3, 1:300, Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA) was applied in 1x PBS +0.1% triton in room temperature on a rocking plate overnight. The sections were washed and the secondary antibody was applied for 1\u2009h (1:500, 555 Alexa Fluor Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Eugene; OR). The sections were washed again and the second primary antibody (anti-CC1, 1:300, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was applied in 1x PBS +0.1% triton in room temperature on a rocking plate overnight. The sections were washed and the second secondary antibody was applied (1:500, 488 Alexa Fluor Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Eugene; OR) for 1\u2009h. After washing the sections, the nuclear marker DAPI was applied for 5\u2009min. The sections were washed and mounted (Everbrite Hardset mounting medium, Biotium, Hayward, CA).\nOPC proliferation was studied by EdU labeling using the Click-iT\n\u00ae\nassay together with immunohistochemistry for Olig2, a transcriptional factor expressed in OLs and up-regulated in OPCs, and the nuclear stain DAPI. The sections were washed in 1x PBS +0.1% triton for 3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min and blocked with 5% normal goat serum in 1x PBS +0.1% triton at room temperature for 1\u2009h. EdU cells were detected with Click-iT\n\u00ae\nassay according to manufacturers' protocols; the sections were washed and placed in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 15\u2009min at 80\u00b0C and washed again. The primary antibody anti-Olig2 (1:500, Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) in 1x PBS +0.1% triton was applied in room temperature on a rocking plate overnight. The sections were washed and the secondary antibody was applied for (1:500, 555 Alexa Fluor Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1\u2009h. The nuclear stain DAPI from the Click-iT\n\u00ae\nkit was applied for 30\u2009min and the sections then were washed and mounted (Everbrite Hardset mounting medium, Biotium, Hayward, CA).\nMicroglia/macrophages were detected using the ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba 1) (1:1000, Wako Chemicals, Neuss Germany), an accepted marker for activated microglia/macrophages,\n33\u201335\nand neutrophils by anti-GR-1 (1:200, Bioledgend, San Diego, CA) by washing the sections 3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min in 1x PBS\n+\n0.1% triton. The sections were blocked using 5% normal donkey serum in 1x PBS +0.25% triton at room temperature for 1\u2009h. The primary antibody was applied overnight and the secondary antibody (1:500, Cy3 Alexa Fluor Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 90\u2009min in room temperature and cover-slipped using PVA-DABCO (Saveen-Werner, Malm\u00f6, Sweden).\n\nIn situ\nRNA hybridization\nRNAScope\n\u00ae\ntechnology (Advanced Cell Diagnostics Milan, Italy) was used for\nin situ\nRNA hybridization according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sections were washed in 1x PBS\n+\n0.1% triton for 3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min and then placed on glass slides and air dried. The slides were incubated in warmed pre-treatment 3 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics Milan, Italy) for 5\u2009min, kept at a light boil, and then placed in distilled water. The slides were then subjected to RNAscope\n\u00ae\nMultiplex Fluorescent Assay by first incubating the probe (mmOlig2, mmCasp3, or mm MOG) for 2\u2009h at 40\u00b0C and then pre-forming the amplification steps according to instructions. The slides used for Olig2/EdU labeling were then blocked with 5% normal goat serum in 1x PBS +0.1% triton at room temperature for 1\u2009h, and the Click-iT\n\u00ae\nassay (described above) was then performed followed staining with the nuclear marker DAPI for 5\u2009min. The sections were washed and mounted (Everbrite Hardset mounting medium, Biotium, Hayward, CA).\n\nAnalysis of microglial/macrophage reactivity\nSholl analysis was performed to evaluate ramification of microglial/macrophage cells\n36\nin the corpus callosum at two, seven, and 14 days after cFPI and sham injury. The number of intersections of a cell with circles of increasing diameters indicates the degree of ramification of the cell. Sections were stained for Iba-1. Z-stacked confocal images were merged into a single plane image using the LSM Image Browser software (Carl Zeiss Inc, Gottingen, Germany). Per picture, three cells per animal were selected randomly, using a circle with a circumference of 100\u2009\u03bcm (140/\u03c0 in diameter). The following selection criteria for analysis were defined: (1) a cell needed to completely fit in the circle; (2) a cell needed to have a visible soma; and (3) a cell should not overlap with other cells. Using ImageJ, pictures were converted to eight-bit files with a set threshold. The center of a cell was defined manually, and Sholl analysis was performed by starting with a circle with a diameter of three pixels and expanding the circles with one pixel each time. Intersections per circle were counted using the ImageJ Sholl analysis plugin up to 60 intersections. Results from each cell per conditions were integrated and analyzed using Microsoft Excel.\nAreas of Iba-1 immunoreactivity were also quantified in the corpus callosum and bilateral external capsule after cFPI and sham-injury. Areas have been delineated according to our previous study.\n10\nZ-stacked micrographs from coronal brain sections were acquired using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope and merged into a single plane image using the LSM Image Browser software. Thereafter, micrographs were converted into binary eight-bit pictures and the area covered by immunoreactivity in the corpus callosum and external capsule was quantified as percentage of total image area using the ImageJ software (NIH, Washington, DC).\n\nStatistics\nThe data were analyzed for Gaussian normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilks test. The data did not meet the assumption of normal distribution, and the Kruskall-Wallis test was used; if\np\n\u2264\u20090.05, the Mann Whitney\nU\ntest was performed. A\np\nvalue \u22640.05 was considered significant. All statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS 20 (SPSS IBM, Chicago, IL). Graphs are presented with mean value and standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Animals were housed up to two rats per cage in the University of Pittsburgh vivarium with a 12:12 light/dark photoperiod (lights on at 7:00\na.m.\n) and provided food and water\nad libitum\n. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) weighing 325-425\u2009g were utilized in this study.\n\nCCI\nRats were randomized for assignment to injury and treatment status. Rats were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in a 2:1\u2009N\n2\nO/O\n2\nmixture in a ventilated anesthesia chamber. Following endotracheal intubation, rats were mechanically ventilated and anesthesia was maintained with a 2% isoflurane mixture. Rats were placed in a stereotaxic frame in the supine position and body temperature was monitored by rectal thermistor probe and maintained at 37\u00b0C with a heating pad. Following a midline incision, soft tissues were reflected and a craniotomy (7\u2009mm diameter) was completed between bregma and lambda and centered 5\u2009mm lateral of the sagittal suture to expose the dura mater over the right parietal cortex. Control sham-injury animals were subjected to anesthesia and surgical procedures but did not receive a TBI. The CCI injury was produced using a small bore (1.975\u2009cm) double-acting stroked-constrained pneumatic cylinder with a 5.0\u2009cm stroke.\n61\nAn impactor tip (6\u2009mm in diameter) was set to produce a tissue deformation of 2.8\u2009mm at a velocity of 4\u2009m/sec with a dwell time of 150\u2009msec. Following sham or CCI injury, the scalp was sutured, anesthesia stopped, and the righting time of each animal was recorded. Once ambulatory, the rats were returned to their home cage.\n\nAdministration of lithium\nA therapeutic dose of 1\u2009mmol/kg/day lithium chloride was selected based upon published work demonstrating that 1\u2009mmol/kg/day lithium chloride increased SNARE protein abundance in the hippocampus\n43\nand was neuroprotective after TBI.\n50\n,\n51\n,\n62\n,\n63\nTreatment with lithium chloride (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), or vehicle (U.S.P. saline) was initiated at 5\u2009min post-injury by intraperitoneal injection and continued daily until date of euthanasia.\n\nMeasurement of evoked neurotransmission\nA total of 26 rats (\nn\n=\u20096-7 per group) were generated to evaluate the efficacy of lithium to improve evoked dopamine release in the striatum. Rats were randomly assigned to receive sham or CCI injury and treated with vehicle or lithium as described. At 1 week post-injury, the animals were anesthetized as described and placed in the stereotaxic frame for microdialysis probe insertion. The incision was opened and soft tissues reflected for the placement of two set screws and the completion a burr hole for probe insertion in the striatum (AP, +0.0\u2009mm; ML, +2.8; DV, \u22125.0). A guide cannula (SciPro, Sanborn, NY) was inserted into the brain and secured with dental cement. Following curing of the cement, the microdialysis probe (3\u2009mm length, 0.6\u2009mm diameter, 35\u2009kDa molecular weight cutoff; SciPro) was lowered and secured in the guide cannula. Following a 10-min equilibration period, anesthesia was stopped and the animals were placed in a Plexiglass chamber designed for continuous microdialysate collection in awake free-moving animals, as previously described.\n13\nArtificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; 126.5\u2009mM NaCl, 2.4\u2009mM KCl, 1.1\u2009mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.83\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, 27.5\u2009mM NaHCO\n3\n, and 0.5\u2009mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n) was continuously infused at a rate of 2\u2009\u03bcL/min for 3\u2009h to allow equilibration prior to collection of microdialysate for analysis. After the equilibration period, microdialysate was collected every 20\u2009min for 60\u2009min (-60, -40, -20\u2009min). At the 0\u2009min time-point, the dialysate was switched to high-potassium aCSF (48.9\u2009mM NaCl, 80\u2009mM KCl, 1.1\u2009mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.83\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, 27.5\u2009mM NaHCO\n3\n, and 0.5\u2009mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n) in order to stimulate dopamine release for a period of 40\u2009min (0 and 20\u2009min), followed by a second switch for infusion of normal aCSF until the completion of the experiment (40, 60, 80, and 100\u2009min).\nAfter collection of the last sample, rats were euthanized by overdose of sodium pentobarbital (intraperitoneal, 100\u2009mg/kg), and transcardially perfused with saline, followed by 10% neutral-neutral buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA); the brains removed for post-fixation for 24\u2009h, and cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline. Brains were frozen, cut into 35\u2009\u03bcm thick coronal sections and stained with cresyl violet to verify the location of the probes.\nIn vitro\nanalysis of the probe was completed to verify probe function. The concentration of dopamine in the microdialysates was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography consisting of a CoulArray Detector (ESA, Chelmsford, MA), eight coulometric electrodes using \u2212120 to +300\u2009mV potentials in 60\u2009mV increments and a C\n18\ncolumn. Dopamine levels of sham animals from the vehicle and lithium-treatment groups were not significantly different and were combined for statistical comparisons with injured groups.\n\nSynaptosome isolation for Western blot analysis\nA total of 24 rats (\nn\n=\u20096 per group) were injured and treated with vehicle or lithium as described above. Rats received an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (intraperitoneal, 100\u2009mg/kg) at 1 week post-injury, and the ipsilateral striatum was rapidly dissected on a chilled ice plate, immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Tissue samples were processed to produce synaptosomal-enriched lysates as previously described.\n64\nThe tissues were homogenized using a dounce homogenizer with SYN-PER isolation reagent (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) with a freshly prepared protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). The homogenized lysates were centrifuged at 1200\u2009\u00d7\u2009g at 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, and supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 15,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g at 4\u00b0C for 20\u2009min. The pellet was suspended in isolation reagent and protein concentration was measured with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific) using a 96-well microplate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT).\n\nImmunoblotting\nTo examine the abundance of synaptic proteins and monomeric SNARE proteins in the striatum, synaptosomal lysates were boiled for 10\u2009min prior to SDS-PAGE. SNARE complex abundance was examined in unboiled lysates to retain high molecular weight complexes, defined as SNAP-25 immunoreactive material greater than 50\u2009kDa that was absent from boiled samples, as previously described.\n39\n,\n43\n,\n44\nProtein lysates (20\u2009\u03bcg per well) and molecular weight markers were separated by SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Membranes were incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk in tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (blocking solution) for 1\u2009h. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Primary antibodies utilized were mouse anti-SNAP-25 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA), mouse anti-\u03b1-syn (BD Transduction, San Jose, CA), rabbit anti-CSP\u03b1 (Thermo-Fisher, Rockford, IL), rabbit anti-VAMP2 (Millipore, Temecula, CA), rabbit anti-synaptophysin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), rabbit anti\u2013post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95: Abcam), rabbit anti-phospho-GSK3\u03b2 (Ser9; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), rabbit GSK3\u03b2 (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-phospho-tyrosine hydroxylase (P-Ser40 TH; Millipore), mouse anti-dopamine transporter (Abcam), rabbit anti-dopamine D2 receptor (Abcam), and mouse anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). On the following day, the membranes were rinsed with 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009TBS buffer and incubated in blocking solution containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1\u2009h. Proteins were visualized using a chemilluminescence detection system (Supersignal, Pierce) and imaged with a Chemidoc Imager (BioRad).\nTo normalize for protein content, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with mouse anti-\u03b2 actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Lysates from all groups were loaded in the same gel for comparison. Optical density (OD) of each protein of interest was measured using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). The OD of \u03b2-actin was measured for each lane and used for normalization as a loading control for each sample. Values are presented as the ratio of OD of samples as a percentage of Sham+Vehicle (100%). Sham+Vehicle and Sham+Lithium groups were not combined for immunoblot analysis to evaluate potential effects of lithium treatment on protein abundance in control sham rats. OD for proteins of interest were normalized to Sham+Vehicle rats to examine the potential effects of lithium treatment between groups.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical comparisons of evoked dopamine release were completed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests, when appropriate. Statistical comparisons of dopamine area under the curve and peak values were compared using a one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests, when appropriate. Immunoblot data were compared using a two-way ANOVA. For immunoblot data, no significant interactions were found for two-way ANOVA comparisons and as a result, no\npost hoc\ncomparisons were completed. A\np\nvalue less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests. Statistical tests were completed using Graphpad (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA)."

    "Methods": "Animal subjects and experimental groups\nAll experiments were conducted in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive (European Union and institutional guidelines) and approved by the local governing body (Regierungsprasidium Karlsruhe). A total of 53 adult female C57BL/6 mice (8\u201312 weeks old; Janvier) weighing between 20\u201325\u2009g were used and animals were housed in groups of 4\u20135 mice per cage on a 12/12-h light/dark cycle and had access to water and food\nad libitum.\nSurgeries and behavioral tests were done in three cohorts of animals to ensure that training and behavioral testing can be done by the same investigator. In each cohort, animals were assigned to one of four experimental groups (numbers in parentheses indicate the group size in each cohort): spinal cord injury (SCI;\nn\n=\u20096;\nn\n=\u20095;\nn\n=\u20094), spinal cord injury with training (SCI+T;\nn\n=\u20097;\nn\n=\u20094;\nn\n=\u20094), sham-operated (Sham;\nn\n=\u20094;\nn\n=\u20094;\nn\n=\u20093) and sham operated with training (Sham+T;\nn\n=\u20094;\nn\n=\u20095;\nn\n=\u20093). Individual animals were assigned to training or no training groups based on paw withdrawal responses to the 0.4\u2009g von Frey hair filament at 35\u2009dpi to match trained and untrained animals. Data from the three cohorts were combined for statistical analysis. Spinal cord injured mice were subdivided\npost hoc\ninto animals with pain (SCI-Pain) or without pain (SCI-No Pain) following completion of all behavioral tests to maintain blinding in behavioral tests (see below).\n\nSpinal cord injury\nMice were deeply anesthetized using a cocktail (2.5\u2009mL/kg) containing ketamine (31.25\u2009mg/kg; Bremer Pharma, Warburg, Germany), xylazine (1.58\u2009mg/kg; Ecuphar, Oostkamp, Belgium), and acepromazine (0.31\u2009mg/kg; Sanofi-Ceva, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany). After exposing the vertebral column and localization of the target region, mice underwent a T9 laminectomy (corresponding to T11 spinal cord) followed by a moderate contusion with a force of 50\u2009kDyn using the Infinite Horizon Impact Device (IH-0400 Impactor; Precision Systems & Instrumentation, Lexington, KY) equipped with a standard mouse steel-tipped impactor with a diameter of 1.3\u2009mm as previously described.\n24\n,\n30\nBriefly, the spinal processes of the adjacent vertebral bodies rostrally (T8) and caudally (T10) from the site of laminectomy were used to stabilize the spinal column using extra fine forceps (Extra Fine Graefe Forceps; Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA) attached to the impactor device. The exposed spinal cord was aligned perpendicular to the impounder tip. The position of the impactor tip was adjusted if necessary and positioned 3\u20134\u2009mm above the exposed spinal cord. After contusion, the paravertebral muscle layers were sutured and the skin incision was stapled. In sham mice, skin incisions and separation of paravertebral muscles to isolate the T9 vertebra was performed followed by suturing and stapling of the skin. To prevent and compensate dehydration during surgery, animals received a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of lactated Ringer's solution (100\u2009\u03bcL) immediately after surgery. Post-surgical care included close observation, manual bladder voiding twice per day, and treatment with antibiotics to prevent bladder infection (100\u2009\u03bcL ampicillin s.c., 33\u2009mg/kg, twice per day; Ratiopharm, Ulm, Germany) for about 10\u201314 days after surgery until reflexive bladder function was restored. Analgesics (0.01\u2009mg/kg buprenorphine-HCL, 100\u2009\u03bcL s.c., Temgesic; Reckitt Benckiser, Heidelberg, Germany) were administered to injured and sham-operated animals immediately after recovery from anesthesia and twice daily during the first 2 post-operative days. All surgeries were performed by the same experienced investigator.\n\nBehavioral testing\nMice were acclimated to the individual testing set-up for 2\u20133 days for at least 1.5\u2009h per day prior to behavioral testing and for 30\u201360\u2009min in each set-up on testing days. All behavioral testing was performed in awake, unrestrained mice by the same investigator blinded to group identity.\n\nMechanical sensitivity testing: von Frey\nTo evaluate changes in mechanical sensitivity after injury and sensorimotor training, von Frey hair filaments with ascending diameter and force (0.16\u2009g, 0.4\u2009g, 0.6\u2009g, 1.4\u2009g; Touch Test Sensory Evaluators; North Coast Medical, Gilroy, CA) were applied to the hindpaws of mice. The filaments were chosen based on results from a previous study evaluating effects of early-onset treadmill training in mice with the same SCI.\n24\nMice were placed in plexiglass chambers (modular animal-enclosure; Ugo Basile Srl, Gemonio, Italy) on a 90\u2009\u00d7\u200939\u2009cm perforated metal platform (framed testing surface; Ugo Basile). Starting with the smallest filament (0.16\u2009g) each hindpaw was stimulated five times resulting in 10 stimuli per filament per mouse. Up to 12 animals were tested in parallel and only after testing one hindpaw with a single stimulus in all mice and testing the other paw once in all mice, the paw was re-tested with the same filament. Thereby a stimulus-induced sensitization of the paw was avoided. The response rate defined as paw withdrawal frequency (number of positive responses divided by the number of stimuli) was used to express mechanical sensitivity. The sensitivity towards each filament per animal represents the average response rate of the trials for the left and right paw. To define the baseline sensitivity for all filaments in each animal, mechanical sensitivity testing was performed on 2 consecutive days before surgery. The mean of the two pre-injury values per animal and filament was taken as pre-operative baseline response rate. After surgery, mechanical sensitivity was assessed 35 days post-injury, as well as 2 and 4 weeks (56\u2009dpi and 70\u2009dpi) after training was started (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental design. Adult female C57BL/6 mice (\nn\n=\u200953) were assigned to four groups (spinal cord injury [SCI],\nn\n=\u200915; SCI with training [SCI+T],\nn\n=\u200915; sham-operated [Sham],\nn\n=\u200911; Sham with training [Sham+T],\nn\n=\u200912) after baseline testing and 35\u2009dpi before treadmill training was initiated. Mechanical sensitivity data 35\u2009dpi were used to define \u201cPain\u201d and \u201cNo Pain\u201d animals. Starting from 42\u2009dpi, mice in the training groups (SCI+T; Sham+T) were trained 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009/day for 15\u2009min each, 5 days per week for a total of 23 days. To investigate the effect of moderate treadmill training on nociceptive behavior, mechanical and thermal sensitivity testing was performed 2 and 4 weeks after training start. Supraspinal pain processing was tested using a place escape/avoidance paradigm (PEAP). Coronal sections (25\u2009\u03bcm) of the lesion epicenter and lumbar spinal cord were analyzed by eriochrome cyanine staining, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-/protein kinase C\u03b3 (PKC)- and isolectin-B4 (IB4)-/PKC\u03b3-labeling. Sections of L4-L6 dorsal root ganglia (DRGs; bilaterally;\nn\n=\u20093 per group of the last cohort; see\nMethods\n) were labeled for CGRP and NeuN.\n\nMechanical sensitivity testing: place escape/avoidance paradigm\nMechanical sensitivity testing using von Frey hair filaments is a stimulus-evoked behavioral measurement. Since changes in these measures might only be the result of evoked hyperreflexia, responses in a place escape/avoidance paradigm (PEAP) addressing the aversive quality of pain and thereby supraspinal processing of nociception were evaluated. The PEAP is based on the assumption that animals escape and/or avoid an aversive mechanical stimulus. Animals have the active choice between a naturally preferred dark environment and pain relief in a more aversive light environment.\n31\nThe testing environment, modified from LaBuda and Fuchs,\n32\n,\n33\nconsists of the same plexiglass enclosure used in the von Frey testing modified to create a box consisting of a dark and a light side. One half of the box was darkened using mat black self-adhesive tape, whereas the other half was coated with mat white self-adhesive tape creating a dark and a light side equal in size (10\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200914\u2009cm).\nTo further enhance the contrast between both sides, a removable partition was positioned in the middle of the chamber separating the dark from the white side creating a passage to either side. The height of the border was adjusted to allow for normal crossing and the partition was also laminated with black and white adhesive foil. Additionally, the lid of the dark side was covered with black foil while the other lid was left transparent. The enclosure was placed on a perforated metal platform and it was ensured that the light side was uniformly illuminated by the ceiling light. Animals were placed in the middle of the chamber and the time spent on the dark side of the chamber was measured. An initial 10\u2009min exploration phase (baseline) without any stimulus was followed by a 15\u2009min testing phase (3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min blocks) in which the hindpaws were stimulated using a 0.16\u2009g von Frey filament every 15\u2009sec when the mouse was present on the dark side of the chamber. The left and right hindpaw were stimulated in an alternating manner. The PEAP was used to assess mechanical sensitivity changes after injury at the end of the experiment, 72\u2009dpi.\n\nThermal sensitivity testing: Hargreaves' method\nThermal sensitivity was assessed according to Hargreaves' method using the plantar test (Hargreaves Apparatus; Ugo Basile). Mice were enclosed in plexiglass chambers (modular animal-enclosure; Ugo Basile) placed on a 90\u2009\u00d7\u200939\u2009cm metal platform with a glass floor (Ugo Basile). An infrared laser beam was presented to the plantar surface of the hindpaws and the time (sec) until withdrawal was recorded resulting in the response latency to the heat stimulus. The laser intensity was adjusted to give a latency of approximately 8\u20139\u2009sec in na\u00efve animals (190\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009mW/cm\n2\n). To avoid tissue damage, a 15-sec cut-off time, as well as a delay of at least 1\u2009min between two trials for the same paw and mice, was introduced. The paw testing order was chosen randomly to minimize an order effect. In each animal, the mean of four trials for the left and right hindpaw was used to express the thermal sensitivity. Similar to the von Frey testing, the mean latency of 2 consecutive testing days before surgery determined the baseline of the animals (pre-operatively). After surgery, thermal sensitivity was assessed 35 days post-injury, as well as 2 and 4 weeks (56 and 70 days post-injury) after training was started. The response latencies for the left and right hindpaw were averaged.\n\nMotor recovery: Basso Mouse Scale\nRecovery of motor function was assessed using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) for locomotion.\n34\nSingle mice were placed randomly in an open field and observed by two experienced investigators blinded to group identity for at least 5\u2009min. The BMS is a 9-point scoring system developed and validated for spinal cord contusion injuries in mice. A score of 0 reflects complete hindlimb paralysis without ankle movement, whereas a score of 9 indicates normal locomotion. Lower scores (0\u20133) express changes in ankle movement and plantar placement of the hindpaw, continuing with stepping, coordination, and paw position in intermediate scores (4\u20136), and assessment of trunk stability and tail position in higher scores (7\u20139). Dorsal and/or plantar stepping starts at a score of 3, becomes frequent or consistent plantar with a score of 5 with some coordination, whereas scores of 6 and 7 indicate mostly coordinated stepping with parallel or rotated paw placement at initial contact and lift off. The motor function was scored 1 day post-injury to confirm an adequate injury and weekly starting 35 days post-injury. Each hindpaw was scored individually and averaged to get a single score for each animal per testing day.\n\nTreadmill training\nTo test the impact of delayed sensorimotor activity on neuropathic pain, treadmill training was used as previously described.\n24\nThe custom-made motorized treadmill consists of three individual lanes (7\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009cm) separated by walls of red acryl glass, allowing for parallel training of up to three animals. A motor-driven rotor (RollerDrive EC310; Interroll Automation, Sinsheim, Germany) controlled by a proprietary software developed under LabVIEW 2012 (version 12.0; National Instruments Corporation, Austin, TX) enabled spinning of the belts with adjustable velocity. A load-independent constant velocity was achieved by implementation of a proportional-integral-derivative controller. Training was initiated in the subchronic/chronic phase after injury (42 days post-injury). The paradigm consisted of training twice a day for 15\u2009min each, 5 days per week, over a total of 23 training days (\nFig. 1\n). By increasing the speed, training intensity was adjusted on a daily basis according to the motor performance of injured mice. To expose trained sham animals (Sham+T) to the same training load as trained SCI animals (SCI+T), similar treadmill velocities were used and adjustments were also done on a daily basis. Animals of the untrained groups (SCI, Sham) were exposed to the same environment by placing them into the treadmill without turning on the treadmill. The criteria for moderate treadmill training were defined as intensity or velocity in which animals run most of the time in the center of the lane without any signs of increased stress (e.g., increased defecation or respiration rate). Animals were closely observed during the exercise period to adapt the velocity when the criteria for moderate training were not met.\n\nTissue processing\nAnimals were euthanized 74 days post-injury with an overdose of anesthesia cocktail and transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer (PFA). The spinal column was dissected, post-fixed in 4% PFA for 1\u2009h at room temperature, and briefly rinsed with ddH\n2\nO followed by a 5\u2009min washing in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer before the tissue was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer at 4\u00b0C. The lesion site (T11), the L4-L6 spinal cord, as well as dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) were identified using anatomical landmarks, embedded in Tissue-Tek\n\u00ae\nO.C.T compound (Sakura Finetek, Germany) followed by serial sectioning (spinal cord, 25\u2009\u03bcm coronal; DRG, 10\u2009\u03bcm) and mounting in seven or 14 series onto slides (Microscope Slides Superfrost\n\u00ae\nPlus; Thermo Fisher). Animals from all groups were processed, sectioned and mounted at the same time. Slides were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until used for immunolabeling or staining.\n\nEriochrome-cyanine staining\nThe lesion size of injured animals was analyzed by quantifying the spared tissue at the lesion epicenter. Two consecutive series were stained for myelin using eriochrome-cyanine. Slides were dried for 2\u2009h at 37\u00b0C and placed in fresh acetone for 5\u2009min, removed, and air dried for 20\u2009min at room temperature. Next, the sections were stained in eriochrome cyanine solution (0.4\u2009g eriochrome cyanine R, 1\u2009mL concentrated H\n2\nSO\n4\n, 192\u2009mL ddH\n2\nO, and 8\u2009mL of 10% ferric ammonium sulfate solution) for 30\u2009min at room temperature followed by a rinsing step for 5\u2009min in ddH\n2\nO. Sections were differentiated in 5% aqueous ferric ammonium solution for 10\u201320\u2009min until the gray matter started to appear. After the slides were rinsed in ddH\n2\nO for 10\u2009min, the differentiation was completed in a borax-ferricyanide solution for 10\u2009min (2\u2009g disodium tetraborate decahydrate, 2.5\u2009g potassium ferricyanide, and 200\u2009mL ddH\n2\nO). Differentiation was followed by a further rinsing step in ddH\n2\nO for 5\u2009min, the tissue was dehydrated by graded ethanol solutions (two changes each: 70%, 95% and 100%), cleared through three changes of Neo-clear (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 2\u2009min each and cover-slipped (Neo-Mount; Merck). Sections of the lesion epicenter (smallest area of spared white matter) were photographed using a XC30 camera mounted on an Olympus BX53 microscope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). Tissue sparing was quantified by outlining areas with light and dark blue staining and expressed as the percent of cross-sectional area calculated by dividing the white matter area by the total cross-sectional area. Imaging and analysis was performed by an investigator blinded to group identity using ImageJ.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemical labeling was performed on slides with serial sections of the lumbar spinal cord (L4-L6) and L4-L6 DRGs. Slides were dried for 30\u2009min at room temperature, encircled with a liquid blocker and rinsed in 0.1\u2009M Tris-buffered saline (TBS) 3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min each. Sections were blocked and permeabilized by incubating in TBS/0.25% Triton TX-100/5% donkey serum for 1\u2009h at room temperature. All primary antibodies were diluted in TBS/0.25% Triton TX-100/1% donkey serum and the samples were incubated overnight in a humid box at 4\u00b0C. After primary antibody incubation, sections were rinsed 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009in TBS/1% donkey serum at room temperature for 10\u2009min each. Secondary antibodies and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were diluted in TBS/1% donkey serum and the sections were incubated for 2.5\u2009h at room temperature in the dark, rinsed 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009in TBS for 10\u2009min, briefly dried and cover-slipped with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL).\nTo evaluate SCI- and sensorimotor activity-induced changes in primary nociceptive afferents terminating in the dorsal horn, lumbar spinal cord sections were labeled for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; rabbit anti-CGRP, 1:200; Immunostar, Hudson, WI) and isolectin-B4 (IB4; biotinylated Isolectin B4 from\nBandeiraea simplicifolia,\n1:250; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) identifying peptidergic and non-peptidergic C/A\u03b4 fibers, respectively. To identify lamina IIi, rabbit anti-protein kinase C\u03b3 (PKC\u03b3 [C19], 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) was used. Two consecutive series were labeled for CGRP and PKC\u03b3, respectively, or double immunofluorescence labeling using IB4 and PKC\u03b3 was performed. For the analysis of CGRP+ DRG neurons, L4-L6 DRGs were labeled for CGRP and NeuN (guinea pig anti-NeuN, 1:2000; Millipore ABN90, Billerica, MA). The following secondary antibodies were used: donkey anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 594 for CGRP and PKC\u03b3 labeling, respectively (1:300; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated streptavidin for IB4 (1:300; Jackson ImmunoResearch, Suffolk, UK), Rhodamine Red-X donkey anti-guinea pig for NeuN (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch).\nFor each animal, images of the left and right dorsal horn of three labeled sections with an intersection distance ranging from 700\u20131400\u2009\u03bcm were taken at 200\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification with the same resolution, lens aperture, and exposure time using a XC30 camera mounted on an Olympus BX53 microscope with epifluorescence illumination and appropriate filter cubes. Lumbar DRGs (L4-L6) were imaged bilaterally from each animal at 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification using the above-described set-up, and images from three sections per DRGs (140\u2009\u03bcm apart) were analyzed.\n\nQuantification of labeling density in the spinal cord\nNeurons in lamina III-IV usually receive little input from nociceptive C-fibers but rather respond to light mechanical stimuli. Therefore, the termination pattern of peptidergic-and non-peptidergic fiber was analyzed in this region of the dorsal horn as previously described,\n24\nwith the region of interest set using the mouse spinal cord atlas and PKC\u03b3-labeling of lamina IIi. The dorsoventral extent of lamina IIi defined by PKC\u03b3-labeling was defined as distance \u201cx.\u201d The region of interest analysis box was placed in the center of the dorsal horn by taking the midpoint of the medio-lateral border of lamina IIi followed by outlining a squared box with the dimension 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009in the dorso-ventral and 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009in the mediolateral direction adjoining the ventral border of lamina IIi. For the analysis of CGRP-labeling density, the analysis box was outlined in the PKC\u03b3-labeled section and overlaid on the consecutive CGRP-labeled section, whereas IB4-labeling was evaluated in sections double-labeled for PKC\u03b3 and IB4. Quantification of labeling density was performed by an investigator blinded to group identify using ImageJ. Images were processed by setting a labeling threshold minimizing background and accurately reflecting CGRP-and IB4 positive fiber labeling, respectively. Labeling density was expressed as percentage of positive labeling within the analysis box and the values for three sections per animal were averaged. Only SCI-Pain animals were included into the analysis.\nDue to tissue damage following dissection, three animals (SCI+T,\nn\n=\u20093) had to be excluded from histological analysis. Upon examination of CGRP- and IB4-immunolabeled sections, two animals (CGRP: SCI,\nn\n=\u20091; SCI+T,\nn\n=\u20091; IB4: Sham+T,\nn\n=\u20091) showed only poor labeling in the superficial dorsal horn and no labeling in deeper laminae. These animals were excluded from immunohistochemical analysis leaving a total of\nn\n=\u200942 for quantification of CGRP and\nn\n=\u200943 for quantification of IB4-labeling density.\n\nQuantification of DRG neurons\nIn addition to spinal CGRP-labeling, the number and size of CGRP-labeled L4-L6 DRG neurons were quantified by an investigator blinded to treatment conditions using ImageJ. For each animal, L4-L6 DRG (bilaterally) neurons were analyzed in three sections spaced 140\u2009\u03bcm apart. First the total number of NeuN+ neurons displaying a visible DAPI-stained nucleus was counted, followed by the number of neurons labeled for CGRP and NeuN (CGRP+/NeuN+). For size distribution, the diameter of CGRP-/NeuN+ and CGRP+/NeuN+ neurons was measured by drawing a straight line between two lateral borders covering the entire cell (longest distance between the two borders). Size distribution of CGRP+ neurons was evaluated by computing the frequency distribution using a bin size of 10\u2009\u03bcm and expressed as the percentage of CGRP+ neurons within a certain size range (number of CGRP+/NeuN+ cells in a certain size range divided by the total number of CGRP+/NeuN+ cells). Values collected for DRGs of the same animals were averaged and group means compared. DRGs were only collected and quantified from sham animals and SCI animals that developed pain of the third cohort of this study (\nn\n=\u20093/group).\n\nStatistical analysis\nBehavioral results were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to reveal overall group difference and significant changes over time, followed by Fisher's least significant difference (LSD)\npost hoc\ntesting. One-way ANOVA with\npost hoc\nFisher's LSD was used to analyze lesion size and labeling density. The size distribution of CGRP-labeled DRG neurons was analyzed by two-way ANOVA (group\u2009\u00d7\u2009diameter) followed by\npost hoc\nFisher's LSD, and one-way ANOVA with\npost hoc\nFisher's LSD was used to compare the percentage of CGRP-labeled DRG neurons. Due to unequal variance and large differences in group size, Kruskal Wallis and Dunn's test was used to compare injured animals without pain and with pain with sham animals. Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean unless otherwise noted and statistical analysis was done using Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) and an alpha level of 0.05 for significance."

Children eligible for enrollment sustained head trauma significant enough to be considered at least \u201cmild\u201d as defined by the American College of Rehabilitation Medicine, requiring at least one of the following: LOC, loss of memory for events, alteration in mental state at the time of the accident, or focal neurologic deficits.\n40\nEnrolled children were required to have undergone acute neuroimaging (CT or MRI) within 24\u2009h of injury, as ordered for clinical management at the discretion of the treating medical team. Subjects were excluded if they had spinal cord injury graded as American Spinal Injury Association C or worse, severe extracranial injuries, or major pre-injury neurologic or psychiatric diagnoses that were judged by the study staff to have the potential to interfere with follow-up, injury related to birth, or were in child protective agency custody. Written informed consent was obtained from a parent or legal guardian for all children. Children 14 years and older also provided written informed consent, and children ages seven to 13 provided written assent, when not precluded by the severity of the child's injuries.\nSubjects included in this specific pilot investigation met additional inclusion criteria as follow: ages three to 16 years at time of injury; had at least one MRI within the first two weeks of injury (either for clinical indications or a scheduled TRACK-TBI protocol studies, completed at the two-week follow-up time point); and completed outcome assessments at the two-week and/or three-month time points. This age range was chosen because of the uniformity of relevant outcome measures utilized across these ages, as described further below. Children were treated in the ED, inpatient unit, or intensive care unit, depending on clinical determination by the treating team. To avoid skewed data in this relatively small pilot study population and to focus on the large group of children with injuries outside of the critical injury range, we excluded those who required neurosurgical intervention or intracranial pressure monitoring.\n\nBaseline demographics\nDemographic details, medical history, TBI history, and socioeconomic/health economic status data were obtained via child/parent interview after enrollment in accordance with the CDEs for Traumatic Brain Injury Task Force.\n41\nHealth insurance was selected as a proxy to reflect one estimate of socioeconomic status. Positive neurobehavioral history was defined as reported history of previously diagnosed developmental, neurological, or psychological disorders or reported counseling for similar difficulties, but not for counseling exclusively during stressful life transitions without associated diagnosis. Concussion history was not included as a predictor or collapsed into neurobehavioral history because of limited representation of previous head injury in our small sample, and some conflicting evidence regarding the effect of concussion on outcomes after mild TBI.\n42\n,\n43\n\nAcute clinical data\nData regarding acute clinical condition and treatment in the ED and/or during hospitalization were collected in accordance with CDE definitions from the electronic medical record and documented in a secure study database by trained research staff.\n41\nFor this study, GCS scores analyzed included worst unsedated GCS score from the ED, and daily GCS scores thereafter. LOC was defined as of any duration per subject or witness report.\n\nImaging\nClinical neuroimaging (CT or MRI) scans were obtained at each facility based on treating clinician judgment, not standardized by protocol. Clinical scans were read initially by clinical radiologists. Generally, indications for CT scans followed Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network rules, designed to limit radiation risk in children at low risk for clinically important neuroimaging findings.\n44\nSome children underwent acute MRIs, often rapid unsedated MRIs, if deemed clinically necessary, and some children only had MRIs instead of CT scans during the acute evaluation. Clinical MRIs typically included a minimum of T2-weighted imaging, a blood sensitive sequence (gradient echo or susceptibility weighted imaging [SWI]), and often T1 and diffusion weighted imaging, with additional sequences depending on the clinical need and ability of the child to tolerate longer scan times.\nResearch MRI scans were completed at two weeks and six months after injury using two different protocols based on the child's age and ability to cooperate with scans of different durations. The long (\u201cstandard\u201d) protocol was a 53-minute protocol that included Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo Imaging (MPRAGE), Sampling Perfection with Application Optimized Contrasts using different flip angle Evolution (SPACE) T2, SPACE Fluid Attenuation Inversion Recovery (FLAIR), gradient echo imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional Blood Oxygen Level Dependent Effect (BOLD) MRI sequences, all acquired isometrically and performed in the sagittal plane. The brief TRACK-TBI imaging protocol consisted of a 5-min 40-sec scan that included the following sequences: coronal and sagittal Half-Fourier-Acquired Single-shot Turbo Spin Echo (HASTE), axial SWI, diffusion weighted imaging (six directions), and axial Volume Interpolated Breathhold Examination T1 (VIBE T1). The increased length of the long protocol was primarily because of experimental sequences (detailed diffusion tensor imaging and resting state fMRI); however, both scans included basic structural imaging and blood sensitive sequences that provided the ability to detect traumatic lesions.\nImages were deidentified and uploaded to a secure web-based image archive (Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Image Data Archive). Both clinical and research images were coded using the CDE definitions by a neuroradiologist, pediatric neuroradiologist, and/or a neurosurgeon, with disagreements resolved by consensus.\n45\n,\n46\nNeuroimaging findings were then categorized into \u201cintra-axial\u201d lesions (CDE defined brain contusion or hemorrhage, diffuse axonal injury, or traumatic axonal injury) and \u201cextra-axial\u201d lesions (CDE defined skull fracture, epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or undifferentiated extra-axial collections). Lesions coded as \u201cindeterminate\u201d were classified as negative imaging findings. Findings from all clinical imaging obtained within two weeks of injury including the two-week research MRI, were used to determine the presence of intra-axial and extra-axial lesions.\n\nOutcome assessments\nIn the larger TRACK-TBI pediatric study, several questionnaire-based and performance-based outcome measures were completed at the following time points: two weeks, three months, six months, and 12 months post-injury. All follow-ups were completed in person, except for the three-month follow-up, which was completed by telephone. If subjects were unable to follow up in person, the questionnaire portions of the outcome assessment were completed by telephone. Children who were 17 years of age at the time of injury completed an adult outcome assessment battery, and thus were not included in the present study.\nFor this analysis, parent (or other adult caregiver)-reported TBI-related symptoms were measured via the Health and Behavior Inventory (HBI), a 20-item questionnaire that measures severity of TBI-related symptoms with separate subscores for cognitive and somatic domains.\n3\n,\n47\nThe HBI was recommended by the CDEs as a core measure of TBI-related symptoms for children across the age and injury spectrum.\n3\n,\n4\n,\n6\n,\n47\nThe HBI includes both a child report version and a parent report version, but the child report version was only used for children eight years and older because of decreased validity of self-report measures in younger children.\n48\nFor this reason, only the parent version data were used in this specific analysis to include younger children.\n47\nUnlike some symptom checklists that sum the total number of different symptoms that are present at any point in time, the HBI weights the severity of each symptom by asking how frequently it occurs, thus generating a symptom severity score for each domain. To estimate baseline symptoms, at the two-week assessment, parents/caregivers retrospectively rated pre-injury symptoms over the four weeks before injury.\n3\n,\n47\n\nStatistical analysis\nBaseline patient characteristics were described as means with standard deviations, as medians with interquartile ranges, or as percentages. Median comparisons were performed using Wilcoxon rank sum (Mann-Whitney) tests or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank tests. Selected injury and environmental factors were investigated as predictors of each type of symptom outcome (cognitive and somatic) at each time point (two weeks and three months) in univariable models. Then, because of heterogeneity of baseline characteristics, selected predictors were investigated in a series of multi-variable models. In each multi-variable model, age, sex, socioeconomic status, and baseline symptom level were controlled, while the main effects of one of the predictors of interest (intra-axial lesion, extra-axial lesion, extracranial lesions, neurobehavioral history, LOC, injury severity, or race) was investigated.\nTo combat the limitation of small sample size, we utilized robust regression models, which are less sensitive to outliers and/or influential cases that could bias the results (STATA rreg package). Cases with Cook distance >1 because of high leverage or high residuals were dropped, and cases with large absolute residuals were down-weighted iteratively using Huber weights followed by biweights to reduce the possibility of bias from outliers and/or influential cases.\n49\nAgreement between binary outcomes was assessed using unweighted Kappa.\np\nvalues <0.05 two-tailed were considered statistically significant. GraphPad Prim 6.0 software was used for statistical figures (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 14/IC software package (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).\nFor the multi-variable models, power was estimated based on the addition of a single predictor to a linear model with the four selected covariates (age, sex, socioeconomic status, and pre-injury symptoms) using G*Power 3.1.9.2.\n50\nVariance for the four covariates was estimated based on previously reported results of multi-variable analyses predicting cognitive and somatic symptoms in children.\n33\nWith our sample size (\nn\n=\u200945) and \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05, we estimated 15% power to detect a small effect, 70% power to detect medium effect, and 97% power to detect a large effect.\n50\n,\n51"

    "Methods": "Animals\nAdult 10-week-old male Sprague-Dawley (Charles River Laboratories) rats weighing 320\u2013360\u2009g were used in all the studies. The animals were housed with free access to food and water in a 12-h dark-light cycle at 22\u00b0C. All procedures followed the guidelines established in the\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\nand were approved by Rutgers University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee before experiments. Rats were divided into two groups (sham controls and animals exposed to a moderate blast of 180\u2009kPa).\nA total number of 24 rats was used in this study as follows: immunoblotting (three controls and three blast injured); immunofluorescence studies (four controls and four blast-injured); superoxide production studies (five controls and five blast-injured). For immunofluorescence studies, each brain tissue was processed to obtain several sections (>10) from frontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. Each of those sections were used for identification of NOX1 and NOX2 isoforms in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia by double immunofluorescence analysis. Similarly, for superoxide production, several sections from different brain regions of animals (five control and five blast-injured) were used for regional analyses.\n\nBlast injury\nRats were exposed to a single blast wave at the Center of Injury Biomechanics, Materials and Medicine (New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark) in the 9-inch square cross section shock tube as described previously.\n18\n,\n19\nThe primary shockwave generated in this shock tube has been validated against the pressure-time profiles measured experimentally in the live-fire explosion experiments\n10\nand against theoretical pressure-time profiles associated with the detonation of C4 explosive (see Kuriakose and colleagues\n20\nfor details).\nAll rats were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg) at 10:1 ratio administered via intraperitoneal injection. Rats underwent a single exposure to 180\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009kPa peak overpressure (duration: 6.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009msec, impulse: 320\u2009\u00b1\u200920\u2009kPa\u00b7msec) and euthanized 4\u2009h post-TBI. All rats were mounted in the middle of the shock tube (2.8 meters from the breech, and 3 meters from the exit) in a prone position\u2014i.e. were strapped securely to the aluminum plate using a cotton cloth wrapped around the body (see Mishra and associates,\n18\nFig. 1B\n). The cloth provides no protection against the shockwave, but prevents any excessive head motion.\n19\nSham control rats received anesthesia and noise exposure but without blast exposure\u2014i.e., anesthetized animals were placed next to the shock tube, and then a single blast was fired.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic depiction of the shock tube. (\nA\n) Schematic of 9\u2009\u00d7\u20099 inch square, 30 feet long shock tube with section I-Breech with high pressure helium gas separated from section II by different thickness of mylar sheets that generate pure shockwave in section III where the specimens are located. Section IV is past the section and is a design requirement; the pressure-time cycle is identical to live fire tests with actual C-4 (or trinitrotoluene equivalent) explosives at specified standoff distance. (\nB\n) Composite of actual experimental profiles that generate 180\u2009kPa with only about five kPa variation in peak pressure and less than a millisecond in duration. The front of the pressure rise indicates shock-wave conditions. (\nC\n) Schematic of rodent model in prone position facing the shock front. The shock travels in the rostral-caudal direction traversing the pre-frontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, visual cortex, and cerebellum within a period of a millisecond with minimal attenuation of pressure loading. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com.neu\nAs a quality control measure, we have also monitored a high-speed video recording to capture any substantial head and body motion during the blast so as to exclude the impact of tertiary bTBI. After blast injury, animals were monitored closely for any signs of trauma-related distress (e.g., apnea). For immunoblot analysis, rats were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0) whereas for immunofluorescence studies, rats were first perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA); brains were then isolated and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose.\n\nWestern blotting\nBefore evaluating spatial resolution of NOX1 and NOX2 protein changes in different brain regions by immunofluorescence, we first examined their levels in cerebral hemisphere and cerebellum by immunoblot. After perfusion with PBS, brains were excised from the cranial vaults, the whole left hemisphere and cerebellum were separately homogenized in ice-cold conditions using CellLytic-M (Sigma) using sonicator with probe amplitude set to 45%. Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000\u2009\u00d7\ng\nat 4\u00b0C. The protein concentration in the samples was estimated by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL).\nSubsequently, 10\u201320\u2009\u03bcg of protein per lane was loaded into 4\u201315% SDS-PAGE gradient gels (Bio Rad). Proteins separated according to their molecular size were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes using Turbo Protein Transfer instrument (Bio Rad Laboratories) according to manufacturer instructions. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk dissolved in Tris-Buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with NOX 1 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) or NOX2 antibody (Novus Biologicals) or 4HNE (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at a dilution of 1:1000. Bands were visualized using Western Pico Chemiluminescence Substrate (Thermo Scientific) on Chemi Doc Imaging System (Bio Rad Laboratories). For densitometric quantitation of Western blots, images were digitized using a BioRad GS800 calibrated densitometer, and analyzed with BioRad Quantity One software.\n\nImmunofluorescence and microscopy\nTo evaluate the spatial changes of NOX1 and NOX2 proteins in different brain regions, as well as to identify cell-specific changes in discrete brain regions, we performed double-immunofluorescence studies of two isoforms of NOX with NeuN, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Iba1, markers of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, respectively, in frontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. Briefly, 4\u2009h post-injury, both sham and TBI animals were transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). After perfusion, the brains were removed from cranial vaults and incubated in 4% PFA for an additional 48\u2009h and cryoprotected by immersing in 30% sucrose. Brains were then dissected into 2\u2009mm thick sections using rat brain slicer (Kent Scientific Corp.) and embedded in OCT (Optimal Cutting Temperature) media and frozen quickly in isopentane cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. Frozen sections were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until ready for sectioning.\nBrain sections (20\u2009\u03bcm thick) were prepared from the frozen tissue blocks, using Leica CM3050 cryostat, and immunofluorescence was performed. Briefly, tissue sections mounted on glass slides prepared from four individual animals in each group were washed with 10\u2009mM PBS, fixed in ice-cold methanol (100%) solution for 10\u2009min at \u221220\u00b0C. The tissue sections were blocked with 10% donkey serum at room temperature for 1\u2009h in PBS containing 0.03% Triton X-100. Fixed tissues were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with respective primary antibodies to NOX1, NOX2, GFAP, NeuN, and Iba1. The details on the source, clonality, and the dilution of each antibody used are provided in\nTable 1\n.\nTable\n1.\nAntibodies Used in the Current Study\nAntibody\nSource\nCatalog number\nHost-species\nDilution\nNADPH oxidase 1\nSigma-Aldrich Inc.\nSAB420097-200UL\nRabbit (polyclonal)\n1:400\nNADPH oxidase 2\nInvitrogen Inc.\nPA5-34600\nRabbit (Polyclonal)\n1:250\nGlial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)\nThermoFisher Scientific Inc.\nMA5-12023\nMouse (Monoclonal)\n1:400\nNeuN\nAbcam\nAB104224\nMouse (Monoclonal)\n1:400\nIba1\nInvitrogen Inc.\nPA5-18039\nGoat (Polyclonal)\n1:250\nOpen in a separate window\nNADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate.\nDouble immunofluorescence was performed using donkey-antirabbit Alexafluor 594 for NOX1 or NOX2 and donkey-antimouse Alexafluor 488 for GFAP, donkey-antirabbit Alexafluor 488 for NeuN, and donkey-antigoat Alexafluor 488 for Iba1. The specificity of each antibody staining was validated by excluding each primary antibody (negative controls) and visualized for any nonspecific fluorescence. The primary antibody specificity, however, was not validated independently by blocking the binding to tissue with the corresponding antigen. Slides containing different brain regions were digitized (20x magnification) using Leica Aperio Versa 200 fluorescent microscope and slide scanner. Fluorescence intensities in each region were quantitated using AreaQuant software (Leica Biosystems) and expressed as average fluorescence intensity/unit area.\n\nSuperoxide production\nSuperoxide (O\n2.\n-\n) levels in different brain regions were measured using dihydroethidium (DHE) following the method of Kim and coworkers.\n21\nBriefly, control and blast-induced animals (five controls and five animals immediately after blast) were injected with 5\u2009mg/kg DHE (Molecular Probes, MA), dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) intraperitoneally, and 4\u2009h after blast, animals were transcardially perfused first with PBS followed by 4% PFA, brains excised, and 50\u2009\u03bcm thin sections of different brain regions were prepared using Leica VT 1000S vibratome and mounted. DHE immunofluorescence in each region was visualized by digitizing the images using Leica Aperio Versa 200 slide scanner. Fluorescent intensities in each region were quantitated using AreaQuant software (Leica Biosystems) and expressed as average fluorescence intensity/unit area.\n\nImage acquisition and analysis\nSlides with mounted coronal sections from the brain were imaged at 20x magnification using a Leica Aperio Versa 200 digital pathology scanner. Control sections were used as reference for adjusting the exposure times and gray scale balance for optimal image quality; once set, these parameters were fixed and used for image acquisition of the reminder of both control and experimental groups. Three channels were collected for each coronal section. Blue: 405\u2009nm (DAPI), red: 594\u2009nm (NOX1), and green: 488\u2009nm (cell specific marker GFAP [astrocytes], Iba1 [microglia], and NeuN [neurons]). We then manually outlined the regions of interest in different brain structures, and the fluorescence intensities in each brain region were quantitated using FLAreaQuantV1 algorithm (Leica Biosystems) and expressed as average fluorescence intensity/unit stained area.\nFor each channel, we set a minimum intensity threshold value using control sections as reference that will exclude any background fluorescence caused by nonspecific binding of fluorescent secondary antibody, and the same threshold values were used to quantify both control and experimental groups. A maximum intensity threshold was also set to remove any oversaturation from excess fluorescent dye. The algorithm outputs the area of positive staining for each brain region, the average intensity of each channel, and intensity profile of each protein.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). Between-group comparisons were made by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a\npost hoc\ntest (Bonferroni) to determine individual group differences. Differences between means were assessed at the probability level of\np\n\u2264\u20090.05, 0.01, and 0.001. GraphPad Prism 6.0 software was used in all analyses and preparation of plots."

    "Methods": "Transgenic labeling of PC12 cells\nPC12 cells were transgenically labeled with a mitochondria-targeting tGFP, as previously described.\n46\nBriefly, PC-12Adh cells were transfected with a plasmid vector containing tGFP and a mitochondrial targeting sequence for the cytochrome c oxidase complex subunit VIII. Following transfection, cells were kept under constant selection using media containing 3\u2009\u03bcg/mL puromycin in complete media (F-12K Medium (ATCC cat # 30-2004 Manassas, VA) with 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals # S1111OH, Atlanta, GA), 15% horse serum (Gibco # 26050-070), and 1.1% penicillin streptomycin (Corning # 30-002-CI, Tewksbury, MA).\n\nMitochondrial isolation from cell culture\nPurified mitochondria were isolated from transfected tGFP-PC12 cells as previously described.\n46\nBriefly, when cells were 95% confluent they were removed manually from culture plates using a cell scraper. Mitochondria were isolated using multiple centrifugation and resuspension steps to yield Ficoll purified mitochondria. Importantly, after Ficoll purification, a thin nonmitochondrial layer was gently aspirated off the final pellet, ensuring that the sample was purified without contamination.\n\nMitochondrial isolation from soleus muscle\nImmediately after na\u00efve Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (\nn\n=\u200910) were asphyxiated with CO\n2\nand decapitated, their soleus muscle was dissected. Each animal was placed on its stomach, with the hindlimb stretched backwards; 70% EtOH was sprayed on the hindlimb, and scissors were used to blunt dissect the skin away from the underlying calf muscle. The skin was then cut away from the muscle on the lateral sides, followed by cutting the Achilles' tendon. The muscle was pulled up and away from the leg, exposing the underlying soleus muscle. The tendons were cut at both insertion sites, and the soleus muscle was removed and placed in 2\u2009mL of isolation buffer (215\u2009mM mannitol, 75\u2009mM sucrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 20\u2009mM HEPES, and pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH) containing 1\u2009mM EGTA and 0.025% trypsin. The muscle was chopped into smaller pieces using scissors to increase the surface area exposed to the isolation buffer and trypsin. The sample was then mechanically homogenized, with care not to introduce air bubbles. A protease inhibitor was added to halt trypsin activity, followed by centrifugation at 1500\u2009rcf, 4\u00b0C, 5\u2009min. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 13,000\u2009rcf for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C, after which the pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer and purified using Ficoll gradient (7.5%/10%) centrifugation at 32,000\u2009rpm for 30\u2009min, 4\u00b0C. The pellet was removed and resuspended in 0.6\u2009mL isolation buffer without EGTA, and centrifuged at 10,000\u2009rcf for 10\u2009min, 4\u00b0C.The resulting pellet contain purified mitochondria that was resuspended in isolation buffer without EGTA for Pierce BCA (Thermo Fisher, cat #23225) protein assays and microinjection into spinal cords.\n\nSCI and microinjection procedures\nAdult (12 weeks old, 225\u2013250\u2009g) female na\u00efve Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (Harlan) underwent intraperitoneal injections of anesthesia (80\u2009mg/kg ketamine and 10\u2009mg/kg xylazine, Butler Animal Health Supply) followed by Lacri-Lube ophthalmic ointment (Medi-Vet) applied to both eyes before surgery to prevent drying. The surgical site along the dorsal spine was shaved with an electric hair trimmer and cleaned with both 70% ethanol and betadine solutions. Animals then received a T12 laminectomy to expose the L1/L2 spinal level.\n37\nSham animals received a laminectomy only, whereas injured animals received a severe 250 kDyn contusion injury using a force-controlled Infinite Horizon impactor computerized injury device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Lexington KY).\n47\nThose animals that underwent SCI were split into three cohorts receiving either (1) vehicle injection, (2) cell-derived tGFP mitochondria, or (3) leg muscle-derived mitochondria; uninjured animals did not receive injections (see\nTable 1\n).\nTable\n1.\nSeparation of Animal Cohorts by Outcome Measures at Different Time Points\nOutcome measure\nGroup\nDosage of mitochondria (\u03bcg)\nTerminal time point\nn\nAcute bioenergetics, oxygen consumption rate\nSham\nN/A\n24\u2009h\n11\nVehicle\nN/A\n24\u2009h\n11\ntGFP mitochondria\n50\n24\u2009h\n6\n100\n24\u2009h\n7\n150\n24\u2009h\n6\nMuscle mitochondria\n50\n24\u2009h\n5\n100\n24\u2009h\n6\n150\n24\u2009h\n6\nImmunohistochemistry-tGFP spread cell-type colocalization\nVehicle\nN/A\n24\u2009h\n1\n48\u2009h\n1\n7 days\n1\ntGFP mitocondria\n100\n24\u2009h\n4\n48\u2009h\n4\n7 days\n4\nLong-term studies: behavior, tissue sparing, neuronal cell counts\nVehicle\nN/A\n6 weeks\n10\ntGFP mitochondria\n100\n6 weeks\n11\nMuscle mitochondria\n100\n6 weeks\n8\nOpen in a separate window\nIt should be noted that in addition to these rats, 10 na\u00efve rats were used as donors for leg muscle-derived mitochondria, and 7 rats from long-term studies were excluded for various reasons (see\nResults\n, third subsection).\nInjections were made within 30\u2009min after injury into the mediolateral gray matter at four circumferential sites of the injured cord separated by 2mM in the rostral caudal direction (see\nFig. 1\n) using a glass micropipette needle (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL cat no. 4878) pulled and beveled to a 20\u201330\u2009\u03bcm inner diameter pore opening. Each injection consisted of 750\u2009nL of either vehicle (isolation buffer with 5\u2009mM pyruvate, 2.5\u2009mM malate, and 10\u2009mM succinate) or mitochondria suspended in vehicle (for a total of 50, 100 or 150\u2009\u03bcg); hence a total of 3\u2009\u03bcL volume was injected per spinal cord. Muscle incisions were closed using silk sutures 3-0 Vicryl (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, NJ), and skin incisions were closed using wound clips (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL), followed by application of hydrogen peroxide and betadine. Immediately following surgery, animals were single housed in a clean cage on top of a towel on a 37\u00b0C heating pad, and monitored until recovery from anesthesia. Yohimbine (1\u22122\u2009mg/kg subcutaneously [s.c.], Lloyd Laboratories) was used to counteract the effects of xylazine. Buprenorphine HCl (0.02\u22120.05\u2009mg/kg s.c, Butler Animal Health Supply) was administered s.c. immediately after surgery to alleviate pain, and then every 8\u2009h for 3 days following the operation. The antibiotic cefazolin (33.3\u2009mg/kg, s.c, Butler Animal Health Supply) was given twice daily for 5 days postoperatively to minimize incidence of infection.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nQuantification of transplanted tGFP mitochondria distribution.\n(A)\nSchematics depict location of mitochondrial injections into the spinal cord.

Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nThe animals were housed individually until wound clip removal, and cages were lined with absorbent pads without bedding for the duration of buprenorphine use, as pica is often observed in treated rats. After discontinuation of buprenorphine, pine bedding was used. Additional parenteral fluids (10\u2009mL lactated Ringer's solution, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL) were provided as needed for 24\u221272\u2009h post-surgery to compensate for dehydration brought on by anesthesia. Bladder expression was performed two times per day, until adequate spontaneous voiding returned to avoid urinary tract infections. Skin wound clips were removed 10\u221214 days post-injury with the animals under isoflurane anesthesia. Animals survived either (1) 24\u2009h for mitochondrial respiration analyses (\nn\n=\u200958); (2) 24\u2009h, 48\u2009h, or 7 days for histological analyses (\nn\n=\u200915); or (3) 6 weeks for long-term behavioral and histological analyses (\nn\n=\u200936) (see\nTable 1\n).\n\nBehavioral analyses\nThe Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale was used to analyze the hindlimb functional recovery of animals after contusion SCI. Assessments were performed according to published protocol.\n48\nAnimals underwent contusion injury, followed by BBB assessment at 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days post-injury. Testing was performed at the same time in the same room on each testing day to reduce variation. The scores for the right and left leg were averaged for each time point. Mechanical tactile sensitivity was measured with von Frey filaments (Stoelting, Inc, Wood Dale, IL) as previously described\n49\nand modified.\n50\n,\n51\nThe hindpaw was stimulated with an incremental series of eight monofilaments of increasing logarithmic stiffness. A modified up-down method was used to determine the 50% withdrawal threshold. An intermediate force von Frey filament (#4.31, 2.0\ng\nforce) was first applied to the glabrous skin until the filament was slightly bent. In case of a positive response (withdraw of the paw within 2\u2009sec), the next filament of lesser force was applied. In the case of a negative response, the next filament greater force was applied. The thresholds for both hindpaws were averaged and reported.\n\nMitochondrial isolation from spinal cords\nFor bioenergetics assays, animals were CO\n2\nasphyxiated and decapitated 24\u2009h after injury and injections. A 1\u2009cm segment of spinal cord surrounding the injury site and including all of the injection sites was quickly dissected, and total mitochondria were isolated as described previously.\n13\n,\n17\n,\n37\nBriefly, the spinal cord was placed in a homogenization tube with 2\u2009mL isolation buffer containing EGTA ([215\u2009mM mannitol, 75\u2009mM sucrose, 0.1% BSA, 20\u2009mM HEPES, and pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH] containing 1\u2009mM EGTA), and physically homogenized with six quick rotations of the pestle, without introducing air bubbles into the solution. The sample was poured into a 2\u2009mL Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 1400\u2009rcf for 3\u2009min, 4\u00b0C. The supernatants containing mitochondria were then poured into a separate Eppendorf tube, and this tube was filled up to 2\u2009mL with isolation buffer containing EGTA. To increase yield, the pellet from the previous spin was resuspended in 500\u2009\u03bcL isolation buffer containing EGTA and again centrifuged at 1400\u2009rcf for 3\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatants containing mitochondria from this spin was again poured into separate tubes and filled to 2mL with isolation buffer containing EGTA. The supernatant tubes were then centrifuged at 13,000\u2009rcf for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The resulting supernatant was discarded, and 350\u2009\u03bcL isolation buffer containing EGTA was used to resuspend each pellet containing mitochondria. The samples underwent nitrogen bombing at 1200\u2009psi for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C before being placed on top of a Ficoll gradient (7.5%/10%) and centrifuged at 32,000\u2009rpm for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was removed, leaving a purified mitochondrial pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 450\u2009\u03bcL isolation buffer without EGTA and centrifuged 10,000\u2009rcf for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to remove any remaining EGTA from the sample. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer without EGTA to a concentration of \u223c15\u2009\u03bcg/\u03bcL. Pierce BCA protein assay was performed to determine the protein content of the sample.\n\nAssaying respiration of isolated mitochondria\nMitochondria were assayed for oxygen consumption rate (OCR) immediately after isolation using the Seahorse Bioscience XF\ne\nFlux Analyzer at 37\u00b0C, as described previously.\n17\n,\n52\nMitochondrial respiration was assessed using a respiration buffer consisting of: 215\u2009mM mannitol, 75\u2009mM sucrose, 2\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, 2.5\u2009mM inorganic phosphates, 0.1% BSA, and 20\u2009mM HEPES, pH 7.2. After isolation, purified mitochondria were added to the respiration buffer in the cell plate, and the cell plate was centrifuged at 2000\u2009rpm for 4\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to concentrate and adhere mitochondria to the bottom of each well. Then, 5\u2009mM pyruvate/2.5\u2009mM malate/1\u2009mM adenosine diphosphate (ADP), 1\u03bcg/\u03bcL oligomycin, 3\u2009\u03bcM FCCP, and 100\u2009nM rotenone/10\u2009mM succinate were sequentially added to each well. Oxygen levels were measured after each substrate/inhibitor addition to calculate each state of mitochondrial respiration according to published protocols.\n52\nBriefly, state III respiration is a measure of oxidative phosphorylation that takes place in the presence of pyruvate, malate, and ADP. State IV respiration occurs upon oligomycin addition to inhibit the ATP synthase complex, thus uncoupling the electron transport chain from the ATP synthase complex. State V.1 is mitochondrial respiration after addition of FCCP (protonophore), which collapses the inner membrane potential, and State V.2 respiration occurs after inhibition of complex 1 and addition of succinate to provide electrons through complex 2 of the electron transport chain.\n\nSpinal cord processing for histological analyses\nRats survived to their terminal time point after injection (24\u2009h, 48\u2009h, 7 days, or 6 weeks). They were overdosed with 0.2\u2009mL Fatal-Plus containing sodium pentobarbital (Vortech Pharma Ltd., Dearborn, MI) followed by transcardial perfusion with 150\u2009mL of 0.1M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), then with 250\u2009mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. A 3\u2009cm segment of spinal cord centered on the L1/L2 injury site was dissected, and post-fixed up to 4\u2009h with 4% PFA followed by washing overnight in 2M phosphate buffer. The cords were then cryoprotected in 20% sucrose/PBS at 4\u00b0C until the cords sank in the solution, then embedded in gum tragacanth (Sigma) blocks and serially cryosectioned coronally at 20\u2009\u03bcm.\n53\nFor the 24\u2009h, 48\u2009h, and 7 day cohorts, every other section was mounted on a 10 slide series so that adjacent spinal cord sections on any given slide were spaced equally 400\u2009\u03bcM apart. For the 6 week studies, every fifth section was mounted onto a 10 slide series with adjacent sections on a slide separated by 1000\u2009\u03bcm.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and fluorescent imaging\nSlide-mounted spinal cord sections were washed 3 times for 5\u2009min each in 0.1M PBS, followed by incubation in blocking buffer (0.1M PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton-X 100, and 5% normal goat serum) for 1\u2009h. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in a primary antibody diluted to proper concentration in a blocking buffer. The next day, after being washed again, the sections were incubated with secondary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C before another wash, followed by 3\u2009h incubation at room temperature in streptavidin-conjugated fluorochromes diluted to desired concentrations in 0.1M PBS. After final washes, they were cover-slipped with Vectashield (Vector Labs, cat #H-1000) containing 0.5\u2009m Hoechst dye to label nuclei (Thermo Fisher, cat# 62249). Antibodies used for epifluorescent imaging and co-localization studies included rabbit anti-tGFP (0.13\u03bcg/mL, Evrogen # Ab513), mouse anti-RECA1 (5\u03bcg/mL, abcam # ab9774), mouse anti-GFAP (2\u03bcg/mL, abcam # ab10062), mouse anti-CC1 (0.5\u03bcg/mL, Cal Biochem #OP80), mouse anti-NeuN (5\u03bcg/mL, Millipore # MAB377), mouse anti-CD11b/c (OX42, 5\u03bcg/mL, abcam # ab78457), phosphor-PDGF Receptor \u03b2 (5uL/mL Cell Signaling mAb #3166), goat anti-rabbit 488 (4\u03bcg/mL, Invitrogen # A11008), goat anti-mouse Biotin (7.5\u03bcg/mL, Vector # BA-9200), and Streptavidin Texas red (3.3\u03bcg/mL, Vector # SA-5006). Z-stack images were obtained using Nikon Eclipse Ti Confocal microscope and processed with NIS Elements ND2 software (Nikon Instruments).\n\nQuantification of tGFP mitochondria volume and spread\nA set of tissue section mounted slides for each time point was used to calculate the tGFP mitochondria volume and spread over time after injection. Anti-tGFP antibody was used to label injected mitochondria, as described. Each spinal tissue section was then analyzed using the Nikon confocal microscope for the presence of distinct tGFP labeling. When a discrete tGFP injection bolus was present, Nikon NIS Elements ND2 software was used to measure the area of the bolus. Each of the four injection epicenters per spinal cord was identified by finding the largest area of discrete bolus. Every section, both rostral and caudal, of the injection epicenter that contained a discrete tGFP bolus, was measured. After defining the boundaries of the injection bolus, the section thickness and periodicity of the sectioning paradigm were used to calculate the total injection bolus volume of all four injections in each cord. The rostral-caudal lengths throughout the spinal cords where punctate tGFP labeling was evident were also calculated, regardless of apparent discrete injection boluses.\n\nQuantification of brain macrophage response\nFor the 24\u2009h, 48\u2009h, and 7 day animal cohorts, macrophage densities at each injection epicenter were analyzed. Once the injection site was identified, based on tGFP and OX-42 immunolabeling, then a score of 0\u20133 was assigned for each injection epicenter, where 0 indicates normal density in macrophages (as in na\u00efve tissues), a score of 1 indicates activation (change in morphology to an activated state with processes withdrawn), a score of 2 indicates activated brain macrophage densities in the confines of the injection site, and a score of 3 indicates brain macrophage densities that expand beyond the original injection bolus boundaries.\n\nTime course of cell-type co-localization\nCell-type co-localization of tGFP mitochondria was quantified for different cell types in the 24 and 48\u2009h and 7 day cohorts. Separate sets of slides were labeled for either microglia, endothelial cells, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, pericytes, or neurons, and co-labeled with antibodies against tGFP. Eight sections total per spinal cord were assessed using the left side injections of each spinal cord including the injection epicenters, one section (400\u2009\u03bcm) from the injection epicenter toward the injury site, one section (400\u2009\u03bcm) from the injection epicenter away from the injury site, and the first section away from the injection epicenter that no longer contained a visible bolus (see\nFig. 2A\nfor counting schematic). The region of interest (ROI) counted for each section was the left dorsal quadrant of the spinal cord, drawing a vertical line from the central canal to the dorsal surface, and a horizontal line from the central canal to the lateral surface (see\nFig. 2B\nfor depiction of ROI). Slides were visualized under an Olympus BX51 microscope at 100x magnification (10x eye piece) using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/ tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) combination filter to simultaneously visualize the green and red fluorescent wavelengths. Co-localization was defined in two different ways. The first criterion of positive incorporation was when the tGFP labeling was evident within the confines of the labeled cell membrane, indicating that the tGFP mitochondria were within the boundaries of the cell membrane. The second criterion of positive incorporation was when the tGFP labeling was present and overlapped with the cell-specific marker within the cytoplasm and/or on cell surface. If either of these criteria were met, then this was considered a positive instance of co-localization. Sections were examined using the 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) filter to ensure that the nucleus was within the focal plane. Counts were performed within the ROI in a total of eight spinal cord sections of each animal for (1) each time a specific cell type was co-localized with tGFP and (2) total cell counts for the specific cell type. Quantification of co-localization was reported as a percentage of tGFP-positive cells of a specific cell type divided by the total number of that specific cell type within the ROI.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nCounting schematic for cell-type co-localization with tGFP mitochondria.\n(A)\nEight sections were analyzed on the left side of each injected spinal cord encompassing the contusion site, including both injection epicenters (red boxes), sections 400\u2009\u03bcm rostral and 400\u2009\u03bcm caudal to the injection epicenters (blue boxes), and the first section distal to the injection epicenter beyond the bolus where only punctate tGFP mitochondria were present (dashed black boxes). Injection epicenters are denoted by black stars, injection boluses are depicted as solid green ovals, and punctate tGFP stippling is represented by faded light green ovals. Note that the caudal injection sites are closer to the injury because of the anatomical constraints of T12 laminectomy to effectively injure the L1/L2 spinal level.\n(B)\nFor each section analyzed, the region of interest (ROI) for cell counts was defined by drawing a horizontal line from the central canal to the lateral side and a vertical line from the central canal to the dorsal surface (red). Both the total number of labeled specific cell types and number of instances of tGFP co-localization with a specific cell type were counted within the ROI. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\n\nQuantification of tissue sparing\nTissue sections were stained with eriochrome cyanine-cresyl violet (ECCV) to differentiate white matter and gray matter as previously described.\n53\n,\n54\nMounted sections were imaged using a Nikon microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and Scion Imaging analysis software (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD) was used to delineate injured from spared tissue in each section. ROIs were manually drawn around the entire cord, spared gray matter, and injured tissue, which allowed extrapolation of the spared white matter area. Eleven sections equally spaced by 1000\u2009\u03bcm (6 weeks cohort) or by 800\u2009\u03bcm (24 and 48\u2009h cohorts) and centered on the injury epicenter were analyzed to calculate the volume of damaged versus spared tissues using the Cavalieri method.\n54\n,\n55\n\nStereology\nAnalysis was performed to determine the number of neurons in the medial portion of lamina VII and lamina X of the L1/L2 spinal cord in the 6 week injured cohorts. Stereological counts of neurons were performed as we have previously published.\n37\nAn Olympus BX51 microscope was used to image sections with the Bioquant image analysis program (Nova Prime, V6.70.10, Bioquant Image Analysis Corp., Nashville, TN). Briefly, an ROI was drawn over lamina VII and X, containing putative central pattern generator (CPG) interneurons. A counting grid was placed over this region, with each counting frame measuring 125\u2009\u03bcm x 125\u2009\u03bcm. Disectors were set to 50\u2009\u03bcm x 50\u2009\u03bcm, and section thickness was set at 10\u03bcm, with a 2\u2009\u03bcm guard zone on both the top and bottom of the tissue to keep cells across sections from being double counted. Bioquant software randomly placed dissectors within the ROI, with an average of 13 dissectors counted per section. NeuN-positive cells were then counted under 40x magnification (10x eyepiece). The criteria for neuron cell bodies to be counted required that they be contained within the dissector square and the nucleus be in focus within the set 10\u2009\u03bcm counting thickness, as verified by Hoechst staining.\n56\n\nStatistical analyses\nChanges in each OCR state and respiratory control ratio (RCR) for acute bioenergetic studies, complex I functional assays, injected tGFP bolus volume and rostral-caudal length, cell-type incorporation, number of co-localization instances, and co-localization percentages within each time point were analyzed using a one way ANOVA, with Tukey's multiple comparisons post-hoc test. Macrophage density analyses were performed using a Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest for each time point analyzed. Rostral-caudal co-localization studies, von Frey test, BBB scoring, and neuronal stereology counts were analyzed using a repeated measures two way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons when warranted. All analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism 6 (Graphpad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Significance was set to\np\n<\u20090.05."

Here, we incorporated WM anisotropy into the model (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nThe exterior features (\na\n) and intracranial components (\nb\n) of the Worcester Head Injury Model showing the 50 deep white matter (WM) regions of interest (\nc\n) and a subset of WM tractography fibers color-coded by their fractional anisotropy values. CSF, cerebrospinal fluid. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nThe brain WM is composed of distinctly aligned axonal fiber bundles,\n50\nand its anisotropy is modeled typically as a fiber-reinforced, transversely isotropic material.\n24\nSeveral anisotropic models exist that accommodate high-rate, large deformation. They include the Puso-Weiss model\n51\nadopted in the University of Strasbourg head injury model,\n18\nquadratic reinforcing material model\n52\nin a two-dimensional injury model,\n53\nand the Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden (HGO) model.\n54\n,\n55\nThe HGO model is the most commonly used in TBI studies,\n25\u201327\n,\n56\nbecause it allows incorporating DTI-derived fiber orientation (\n) and dispersion parameters (\n) directly into the strain energy function,\nU\n32\n:\nwith\nIn these equations,\nG\n0\nand\nK\nare the initial shear modulus and bulk modulus, respectively;\nand\nk\n2\nare fiber stiffness parameters;\ncharacterizes the deformation of the fiber bundle with a mean direction,\n, via strain pseudo-invariant,\n;\nrepresents deviatoric component of the right Cauchy-Green strain tensor; and finally,\n(range of 0\u20131/3, from fully aligned to fully dispersed) describes the degree of fiber orientation dispersion.\nThe brain shear modulus contains both time-independent hyperelasticity and time-dependent viscoelasticity. Hyperelasticity in an HGO anisotropic model currently is only available in the form of a Neo-Hookean model in Abaqus.\n32\nIt is governed by either the initial or long-term shear modulus,\nG\n0\nor\n, at the user's discretion. It may not be feasible to directly identify\nG\n0\nor\nbased on existing brain experimental data, or to derive from the previous WHIM that employed an isotropic Odgen model because of the added WM fiber reinforcement. In addition, the shear modulus may still need to be adjusted, regardless, to maximize the model validation performance.\n17\nGiven these considerations, here we chose to iteratively optimize\nusing a binary search strategy so that the resulting brain strain was comparable in magnitudes relative to the previous, already validated, WHIM, that adopted an isotropic material model for the brain.\n11\nThis maximized the overall response consistency between the two versions of WHIM.\nSpecifically, a lower and an upper bound of\nwere first determined (200 Pa\n57\nand 1000 Pa,\n58\nrespectively). At every iteration,\nwas adjusted to the average of the lower and upper bounds to simulate a recorded loss of consciousness (LOC) impact in American college football.\n59\nThe resulting element-wise peak maximum principal strains (\n), regardless of time of occurrence, were compared with those from the previous isotropic WHIM using a linear regression. The iteration would stop when the regression slope was within 1.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05; otherwise, the lower or upper bound was adjusted accordingly to the current\nvalue. Three iterations were sufficient to yield a target\nof 895.53\u2009Pa, resulting in a slope of 0.9956 in regression.\nThe viscoelasticity was modeled as a two-term Prony series:\nwhere the dimensionless relaxation modulus,\ng\ni\n, and time constants,\n, were drawn from an\nin vivo\nshearing dynamic test at a frequency range of 5\u2013350\u2009Hz using corona radiata and thalmic nuclei samples.\n60\nOnly the viscoelastic Prony series were adopted here, but not the shear modulus,\nG\n0\nfrom this early experiment because it was overly stiff. Nevertheless, its relatively large dynamic frequency range allowed proper model validations using both the high-rate cadaveric impact\n61\n,\n62\nand ultra-low-rate\nin vivo\nvolunteer data.\n44\nThis was important, because validating a head injury model at both ends of the impact severity spectrum would likely increase the confidence in model simulation for the majority of real-world concussive and subconcussive head impacts.\n45\nThe viscoelasticity may be further \u201coptimized\u201d in the future, by adjusting the time-varying shear moduli most relevant to the two extreme ends of impact severity.\n45\nThe fiber stiffness parameter,\nk\n1\n, was determined from the ratio of\n(of 0.105; experimentally measured at a loading rate of 25\u2009s\n\u2212\n1\n;\n50\n).

Both co-registered DTI voxels\n11\nand whole-brain tractography\n34\n(isotropic resolution of 2\u2009mm\n3\nand 1\u2009mm\n3\n, respectively) could be used to determine the averaged FA value and fiber orientation. First, the enclosed DTI voxels or fiber sampling points were identified by testing whether the voxel centroids or sampling points were within the boundary of the given brain element. They were used to compute a distance-weighted average FA\n30\n:\nwhere\nN\nis the number of enclosed voxels (3\u2009\u00b1\u20092; range 1\u201321) or fiber sampling points (149\u2009\u00b1\u2009191; range 1\u20132223),\nis the FA value of each voxel/sampling point,\nd\ni\nis the Euclidean distance relative to the element centroid, while\nL\ne\nis one half the length of the element diagonal.\n18\nThe resulting\nwas used to determine discretized\nvalues, similarly to a previous study.\n25\nUsing the voxel- and tractography-based approaches, the element-wise distributions of FA and\nvalues in the entire WM are shown (\nFig. 2\n). With the latter approach, because tractography tracts would terminate if the FA value was below a pre-set threshold of 0.2,\n37\n,\n64\nall of the identified WM elements had an average FA above this threshold (\nFig. 2c\n). Thus, no elements had a\nof 1/3 (\nFig. 2d\n).

Virtually no elements had an FA greater than 0.9, and the majority had a\ngreater than 0.2, regardless of the implementation method. For the voxel-based method, elements with averaged FA <0.2 mostly occurred at the gray matter and WM junction. These elements were treated as gray matter using the tractography-based method, because no fiber sampling points existed with FA <0.2.

Unlike a scalar FA value, however, a vector and its negation,\nand\n, respectively, were effectively identical in describing the same fiber direction. It was possible that two fibers of (nearly) an identical orientation had (almost) opposite directional vectors, however. This would result in an incorrect \u201caveraged\u201d vector (e.g., perpendicular relative to the true orientation; or, a null vector for two exactly opposing vectors). To ensure consistency among the fiber directions within a given element, it was necessary to negate\nif its angle relative to a randomly selected and common reference vector was greater than 90 degrees. In extreme cases, almost half of the voxel- or point-wise directional vectors needed to be flipped (\nFig. 3\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nDistribution of fiber directional vectors within a representative brain element, where virtually identical fiber orientations were represented by almost opposite directional vectors.

The previous WHIM with an isotropic Ogden material model was validated using three cadaveric impacts along three different directions (frontal (C383-T1), occipital (C755-T2), and parietal (C393-T4) impacts;\n11\n,\n46\n). The evaluations were limited to corner locations of neutral density targets (NDT) because of data availability in the original publications.\n61\n,\n62\nAs more NDT displacement data have become available in other studies, here we reported WHIM validation performances using an expanded dataset (additional tests included C383-T3, C383-T4, and C291-T1; 6 tests in total) for all of the available NDT locations (N\u2009=\u200956 in total).\n43\nFor each selected cadaveric impact, WHIM was scaled to match the reported head size. The resulting model-predicted brain-skull relative displacement time histories were then compared against those measured in experiments.\nIn addition to high-rate cadaveric impacts, strain data from an\nin vivo\nhead rotation\n44\nwas also used to validate at the opposite extreme of impact severity. Radial-circumferential shear strains were obtained from the simulation to report the above-threshold area fractions. For all simulations, validation performances were assessed using correlation score (CS) for consistency with the previous work\n11\nas well as CORrelation and Analysis (CORA\n65\n). CS and CORA scores were reported for both the previous isotropic WHIM (Ogden) and the current anisotropic version (HGO), using either DTI voxels or tractography for WM anisotropy implementation.\nFurther, we used CORA as a ranking metric\n43\nto compare WHIM validation performances against other recent or well-utilized models, including ABM,\n17\nSIMon,\n21\nTHUMS,\n66\nGHBMC,\n16\nand the KTH model (with two isotropic material models and an additional anisotropic model;\n19\n,\n29\n).\nFinally, validation against impact-induced brain pressure responses was not necessary for a nearly incompressible brain,\n1\nbecause the pressure responses were essentially hydrostatic for blunt impacts with a duration longer than 2\u2009msec.\n67\n,\n68\nThey can be determined uniquely by the magnitude and directionality of linear acceleration, as well as brain size and shape for a given head model.\n49\n,\n69\n\nSubmodels for the deep WM\nWith a co-registered WM atlas, the 50 deep WM ROIs were localized in the T1-weighted MRI (isotropic resolution of 1\u2009mm\n3\n) of the subjected used to develop the WHIM mesh.\n34\nThe corresponding voxels were then converted into hexahedral elements (143.3\u2009k elements and 190.0\u2009k nodes) with a custom routine. WM anisotropy of the resulting submodel was defined similarly based on whole-brain tractography (average number of enclosed sampling points for each element of 87\u2009\u00b1\u200962, range 1\u2013559).\n\nSignificance of WM fiber alignment\nWM anisotropy has only been incorporated into head injury models relatively recently. By parametrically decreasing the dispersion parameter,\n, from 1/3 to 0 to incrementally induce stronger WM fiber reinforcement in the local brainstem region, one study reported a lower\nin this area when simulating a sagittal head rotation (with other brain regions assumed isotropic\n25\n). The opposite was found, however, when simulating a concussive impact that had large coronal and axial rotational components,\n31\nwhere fiber reinforcement yielded higher\nfor the corpus callosum and brainstem. In contrast, lower WM fiber strains (\n) in the two regions were observed, as expected.\nHere, we extended the investigations further to the whole brain. Instead of locally assigning different dispersion parameter values based on neuroimages, we uniformly set the dispersion parameter,\n, either to its lower or its upper bounds (0 and 1/3, respectively) for the entire WM elements. They represented two extreme conditions in which the WM was either fully aligned to induce maximum fiber reinforcement or fully dispersed with minimum reinforcement in effect. The resulting responses would yield the lower and upper bounds, and their differences would indicate the maximum effect because of the degree of WM alignment. It must be recognized, however, that even with\nof 1/3, WM was still stiffer than gray matter because of its nonzero\nk\n1\nin this region, compared with a value of zero in the gray matter.\n27\nIn contrast, the earlier KTH model assumed the gray matter to be identical to an isotropic WM instead (i.e., the same nonzero\nk\n1\nwas used throughout the brain\n31\n).\n\nImpact simulation and data analysis\nWHIM validation was first conducted using impact acceleration profiles corresponding to the selected impacts as input to the rigid skull through the head center of gravity. All simulations were performed using Abaqus/Explicit (Version 2016; Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, France). Only results from the baseline HGO model based on tractography were reported, along with those from the previous Ogden model, for comparison and completeness. Next, a recorded LOC impact in American college football\n59\nwas simulated using the two global models, with either DTI voxels or tractography to implement WM anisotropy. Each simulation required \u223c25\u2009min to complete (impact duration of \u223c70\u2009ms; double precision with 15 CPUs and GPU acceleration; Intel Xeon E5-2698 with 256 GB memory, and 4 NVidia Tesla K80 GPUs with 12 GB memory). An additional \u223c40\u2009min was required for the tractography-based submodel simulation.\nFor each global model, element-wise\nand strain tensors were obtained at every solution time point (temporal resolution of 1\u2009ms). Peak\n, regardless of the time of occurrence, was also determined. Next,\nwas determined either on an element-wise basis (by projecting the strain tensor along the mean element-wise fiber direction) or along WM fiber sampling points within the deep WM.\n37\nThe corresponding peak\nwas obtained similarly by finding the peak value over the course of impact simulation. For each individual deep WM ROI, peak\nand\n(assessed at the 95th-percentile level) and injury susceptibility indices based on either\n(\nor\n(\nwere determined. These susceptibility indices characterized the volume fraction above a given threshold\n34\nand were analogous to cumulative strain damage measure (CSDM) based on maximum principal strain.\n21\nFor illustration,\nand\nwere assessed at a strain threshold of 0.18 and 0.09, respectively, corresponding to the upper and lower bounds of a conservative strain threshold.\n70\nThe ROI-wise injury metrics for the 50 deep WM regions then served as a response group and were derived from each global model simulation (with either DTI voxels or tractography for anisotropy implementation). They were further compared in terms of Pearson correlation coefficient (\nr\n) and normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE; normalized by the response range determined from the tractography-based global model). ROI-wise injury metrics from the submodel were similarly assessed using tractography sampling points and were compared with those from the corresponding tractography-based global model.\nFinally, the significance of WM fiber alignment was parametrically studied. By setting the FA-dependent\nvalues uniformly to either 1/3 or 0 for the entire WM, two extreme cases were obtained with either the minimum or maximum fiber reinforcement. The same LOC impact was used to generate impact-induced strains. Element-wise\nand fiber sampling point-based\nfrom the tractography-based global model were used for this comparison. All data analyses were performed in MATLAB (R2017b; MathWorks, Natick, MA)."

    "Methods": "Experimental design\nThis study was registered with\nClinicalTrials.gov\n, number NCT01906424. Subjects were invited to participate in the study based on the following inclusion and exclusion criteria:\nInclusion criteria: 1) age >18 years; 2) SCI 1 or more years prior; 3) American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) A, B and C; 4) non-progressive traumatic SCI at C7 (vertebral level) or higher; 5) ability to commit to 12 week participation; 6) stable medical condition without cardiopulmonary disease or dysautonomia that would contraindicate participation in upper extremity rehabilitation or testing activities; 7) not dependent on ventilation support; 8) no painful musculoskeletal dysfunction, unhealed fracture, pressure sore, or urinary tract infection that might interfere with upper extremity rehabilitation or testing activities; 9) No clinically significant depression or ongoing drug abuse; 10) adequate social support network to be able to participate in weekly training and assessment sessions for the duration of the 12 week study period; 11) no current anti-spasticity regimen; 12) must not have received Botox injections in the prior 6 months; and 13) limited use upper extremity for functional tasks.\nExclusion criteria: 1) pregnancy, and 2) no functional segmental reflexes below the lesion.\nFrom those that qualified, a select group were asked to complete a pre-screening questionnaire by phone interview; from those who qualified in the interview, 11 were selected to undergo a neurological and electrophysiological evaluation, of which eight subjects (SCI AIS-B,\nn\n=\u20093 and AIS-C,\nn\n=\u20095) qualified for the study. Neurological evaluations by the team physician included testing sensory (soft touch via Q-tip and pin prick) and motor scores. All subjects signed an informed consent form that was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of California, Los Angeles. Six of the eight subjects completed the trial. Subject 452495 discontinued due to a urinary tract infection and subject 259463 discontinued due to educational obligations after four sessions.\nFor each subject, three baseline sessions were conducted over a period of 10 days including:\n1.\nNeurophysiological tests (spinally evoked potentials, 1\u2009Hz with a 1\u2009msec pulse width and monophasic waveform) to determine recruitment profiles of proximal and distal motor pools with increasing stimulation intensity ranging from 10\u2009mA to 200\u2009mA (or if noted to be uncomfortable)\n2.\nHand grip with maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) without stimulation\n3.\nIdentifying appropriate stimulation parameters for each site of stimulation (30\u2009Hz, 1\u2009msec pulse width, biphasic waveform [AIS C] or monophasic waveform [AIS B])\n4.\nEfficacy of one site versus a second site versus combined two-site stimulation in generating a MVC based on stimulation parameters identified in step # 3\nAt the end of the baseline sessions, the formal 4-week intervention program (two sessions/week) using a proprietary multi-channel transcutaneous stimulator to neuromodulate the spinal cord began. Each session consisted of 1-2\u2009h/day, including a series of voluntary hand grip tasks, beginning without tEmc, followed by series of 18 attempts to generate an MVC (for \u223c5 secs) for each hand with tEmc. At the end of the session, MVCs were repeated without tEmc. At the end of the intervention, six subjects who completed the study underwent final neurological, functional, and electrophysiological evaluation. Functional changes associated with quality of life were self-reported by all subjects before every session. Of special note, during and between all sessions, no adverse events were reported. The stimulation intensity used caused no discomfort of concern to the patients, did not negatively affect their breathing patterns, heart rate, or blood pressure, cause any adverse skin reaction at the stimulation site, nor result in any adverse effects on severity of self-reported spasticity.\n\ntEmc stimulation protocol\nThe experiments were carried out with use of a proprietary non-invasive Transcutaneous Electrical Spinal Cord Stimulator (NeuroRecovery Technologies Inc.). During baseline and final evaluation, each subject was evaluated for functional responses to single versus two-site stimulation. In each case, it was noted that applying stimulation simultaneously at two sites was consistently more effective. This finding was consistent with previous studies of lower extremity function showing that multi-site spinal cord stimulation using tEmc was more effective than single site stimulation for inducing involuntary stepping movements.\n7\n,\n8\nWith this determination, we delivered transcutaneous stimulation simultaneously at two sites along the midline between spinous processes C3-C4 and C6-C7 during every interventional session. The intensity of stimulation at each spinal level was adjusted sufficiently to enable maximal grip strength when applied in isolation, without causing discomfort (range, 10\u2013250\u2009mA). Tonic electromyography (EMG) responses from proximal and distal muscles along with MVC forces were observed to optimize the stimulation intensity. Further, the stimulation parameters also were adjusted based on patient feedback. Stimulation was continuously delivered using 2.0\u2009cm diameter hydrogel adhesive electrodes (Axelgaard, ValuTrode\n\u00ae\nCloth) as cathodes and two 5.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910.0\u2009cm\n2\nrectangular electrodes (Axelgaard, ValuTrode\n\u00ae\nCloth) placed symmetrically on the skin over the iliac crests as anodes. tEmc was delivered using biphasic or monophasic rectangular 1.0-msec pulses at a frequency of 30\u2009Hz, with each pulse filled with a carrier frequency of 10\u2009kHz (\nTable 1\n). It should be noted that since this was a proof of concept study, the patients were made aware when the stimulation was turned on to check for any adverse events.\nTable\n1.\nStimulation Parameters Used for the Six Individuals Who Completed the Study\nSub ID\nMode\nFrequency\nPW\nSite\nAmp\n265582\nBiphasic\n30\u2009Hz\n1\u2009msec\nC3-4/C6-7\n110/110\u2009mA\n491863\nBiphasic\n30\u2009Hz\n1\u2009msec\nC3-4/C6-7\n90/100\u2009mA\n058613\nBiphasic\n30\u2009Hz\n1\u2009msec\nC3-4/C6-7\n120/120\u2009mA\n773762\nMonophasic\n30\u2009Hz\n1\u2009msec\nC3-4/C6-7\n90/140\u2009mA\n739144\nMonophasic\n30\u2009Hz\n1\u2009msec\nC3-4/C6-7\n180/210\u2009mA\n511282\nBiphasic\n30\u2009Hz\n1\u2009msec\nC3-4/C6-7\n70/70\u2009mA\nOpen in a separate window\nPW, pulse width.\n\nEMG recording\nMuscle activity was recorded from select proximal (bicep brachia) and distal (flexor digitorium and extensor digitorium) muscles via surface EMG electrodes (LabChart and PowerLab; ADInstruments). Data were recorded and sampled at a rate of 10\u2009kHz and were analyzed using LabChart software. EMG data were filtered using a 60-Hz notch filter and a Butterworth bandpass filter of 10 to 1000\u2009Hz. Peak-to-peak analyses were conducted using the LabChart software to analyze spinally evoked EMG responses. The EMG data were filtered, rectified to analyze area under the curve during MVC tasks to calculate the integrated EMG.\n\nHand grip function\nOver the course of the 1-2\u2009h training session, the subjects performed two tasks: 1) maximum voluntary contraction (isometric) to assess and train for grip strength, and 2) voluntary rhythmic efforts of submaximal contraction (isometric) to evaluate and train for opening and closing one's hand, equivalent to squeezing/grasping, and releasing objects (voluntary movement). Each voluntary rhythmic effort maneuver was performed for 10-30\u2009sec (one every 1 to 2\u2009sec) and was repeated 18 times with each hand (left and right) over a 1-2\u2009h period. The size and shape of the transducer easily accommodated the variety of hand sizes. Due to the isometric nature of the contraction, the transducer allowed subjects to train for gripping, grasping, and squeezing using primarily their forearm muscles. We found that the isometric device made it was more feasible to minimize forces that could be contributed by the subject's shoulder and upper arm muscles, compared with when pulling a spring-loaded grip device.\n3\n,\n9\nIn addition, the subjects were instructed and closely monitored to assure that a neutral wrist position was maintained while performing the maximum voluntary efforts and voluntary rhythmic efforts to avoid any compensatory mechanisms such as tenodesis. The possibility of the transfer of forces emanating from movements of the more proximal arm, shoulder and trunk muscles also were monitored for each effort, followed by examining video recordings. (\nSupplementary Figs.1\nand\n2\n; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to determine overall differences across time. Wilcoxon matched-paired signed rank test was used as a\npost hoc\ntest to identify difference between \u201ctEmc Off\u201d and \u201ctEmc On\u201d on a day-to-day basis. Mann Whitney\nU\ntest was used to determine individual differences between \u201ctEmc On\u201d versus \u201ctEmc Off\u201d at pre-intervention and post-intervention and between \u201ctEmc Off\u201d and \u201ctEmc On\u201d at pre-intervention versus post-intervention. Coefficient of variation (cv) was calculated to determine consistency of responses at baseline. The criterion for statistical difference was set at\np\n<\u20090.05 for all comparisons."

Strength was assessed using the LEMS.\n29\nThe SCI-FAI was used to identify clinically observable gait deficits,\n30\nand the 10MWT\n31\nto quantify maximum overground walking speed.\n32\nWalking tests were performed using the minimum assistive device (AD) possible for safe walking.\n\nEquipment\nLeg kinematics were measured using an optical motion analysis system (Optotrak Certus; Northern Digital, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada), with nominal resolution of 0.1\u2009mm. Two Optotrak cameras were aligned at the ends of an 8\u2009m walkway, and captured the motion of active, infrared light-emitting position markers. Each position sensor was mounted on rigid bodies that were secured over the pelvis, thigh, shank, and heel. Conventional anatomical landmarks were defined relative to the rigid bodies, which included the hallux tip (toe), calcaneus, fifth metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP), lateral knee, medial knee, lateral malleolus, medial malleolus, greater trochanter (GT), ipsilateral anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), contralateral ASIS, ipsilateral posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS), and contralateral PSIS.\n33\nKinematic data were recorded at 100\u2009Hz and post-processed using custom MATLAB scripts (R2015b, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA).\n\nProtocol\nTo quantify the effects of iSCI on kinematic variability during overground walking, we measured end-point and interjoint variability across self-selected cadence conditions. Specifically, participants walked at three cadence conditions: self-selected cadence without auditory cue (SS), 100% of their self-selected cadence with a metronome-enabled auditory cue (SS\nmet\n), and 115% (F\nmet\n) of their self-selected cadence with a metronome-enabled auditory cue. The auditory cue was not intended for task training to reduce kinematic variability, but rather to encourage cadence matching. The order of prescribed cadence conditions (SS, SS\nmet\n, F\nmet\n) were randomized among subjects to minimize order effects. We recorded leg kinematics of the more impaired limb (defined by LEMS) while iSCI participants walked on level ground, and the same limb was recorded for their matched controls.\nPrescribed cadence conditions were distinct between and within subject groups. We confirmed differences between SS\nmet\nand F\nmet\ncadence conditions for persons with iSCI (SS\nmet\n=\u200958.31\u2009\u00b1\u200926.93 steps/min, F\nmet\n=\u200967.00\u2009\u00b1\u200931.08 steps/min,\np\n<\u20090.001) and between SS\nmet\nand F\nmet\ncadence for AB controls (SS\nmet\n=\u2009110.2\u2009\u00b1\u200910.98 steps/min, F\nmet\n=\u2009126.7\u2009\u00b1\u200912.75 steps/min,\np\n<\u20090.001). As expected, persons with iSCI (\nn\n=\u200916) walked at slower SS cadences (55.53\u2009\u00b1\u200925.39 steps/min) compared with controls (110.2\u2009\u00b1\u200910.98 steps/min;\np\n<\u20090.001). In a subset of participants with iSCI (\nn\n=\u20095), we found no difference in the mean actual walking cadence and prescribed metronome-enabled cadence cues for SS\nmet\n(\np\n=\u20090.71) and F\nmet\n(\np\n=\u20090.56) conditions. Cadence conditions also were highly correlated with walking speed in persons with iSCI (\np\n<\u20090.001 for SS, SS\nmet\n, F\nmet\n) and controls (\np\n<\u20090.01 for SS, SS\nmet\n, F\nmet\n).\nEach participant performed up to 24 walking trials consisting of approximately two to five gait cycles per trial. Persons with iSCI often performed fewer trials and needed more frequent rest breaks between trials to avoid fatigue; therefore, participants were encouraged to rest as needed. A total of \u223c15 gait cycles were collected from each cadence condition. Trial walking speed was calculated as the mean fore-aft displacement between start and end of each experimental trial in the overground walkway. To determine maximum walking speed (10MWT) in participants with iSCI, participants were instructed to walk as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nData analyses\nRaw kinematic data were processed using custom code written in Matlab (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA). We computed joint angles from kinematic trajectories of the heel, toe, MTP, GT, lateral malleolus, and lateral knee anatomical position data. Hip, knee, and ankle joint angles were calculated in accordance with International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) recommendation.\n34\nComputing gait cycles\nA gait cycle was defined as the time period from ground contact of a limb (heel-strike [HS]) to subsequent ground contact of that same limb. Kinematic data were divided into gait cycles using a modified velocity-based algorithm with the PSIS marker defined as the motion reference\n35\nthat translates with the participant. Heel, toe, and MTP position data were low-pass filtered using a zero-lag low-pass Butterworth fourth order filter with a 5\u2009Hz cutoff frequency. HS events were approximated using a downward zero-crossing point of the fore-aft heel velocity. Toe-off (TO) corresponded to an upward zero-crossing point of fore-aft toe velocity. Swing phase was defined as the time between TO and HS. Range of motions at hip, knee, and ankle joints were calculated as the difference between maximum and minimum joint angle for each gait cycle, and then averaged for all trials for each cadence condition.\nQuantifying end-point variability\nTo quantify variability of end-point foot trajectory, we computed the normalized tolerance area of fifth MTP joint, the distal-most marker of the foot, during the swing phase of gait.\n19\nThe swing phase of each cadence condition was divided into bins representing 10% increments in the horizontal excursion of each gait cycle normalized to the mean foot trajectory length (\nFig. 1\n),\n36\u201338\n95% tolerance ellipses of the accumulated trajectory points were computed for each of the 10% bins. Normalized tolerance area of MTP was computed as the mean area of all ellipses. Values were reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\n(A)\nSchematic representation of the end-point trajectory during the swing phase of overground walking.

ACC provides a vector-based index of the cycle-to-cycle interjoint coordination consistency between two joints.\n23\n,\n39\nA vector representing the cycle-to-cycle dispersion of hip-knee (HK), knee-ankle (KA), or hip-ankle (HA) relationships also was computed from a group of two-joint cyclograms. ACC values range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect consistency in the angular relationship between two joints across gait cycles, and a lower ACC value indicates higher joint-space variability across gait cycles. Each gait cycle was normalized to ensure same lengths of all cycles.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed in R statistical package, Version 3.3.1.\n40\nPaired\nt\ntests were used to test the effects of cadence condition and auditory cue on end-point and interjoint coordination consistency. Two sample\nt\ntests were used to detect differences between AB and iSCI groups for each dependent variable (e.g., ACC). Similarly, two sample\nt\ntests were used to test differences in mean hip, knee, and ankle joint ranges of motion between groups for each cadence condition. Normality of the residuals were tested with quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots and the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test to ensure that the residuals were normally distributed about the predicted density. Nonparametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests were used when the data were not normally distributed. The effect of walking aids on end-point variability and ACC was assessed using the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test and the Tukey\u2013Kramer post-hoc test. We quantified correlations between end-point variability and ACC measures of HK, KA, and HA using linear regression. We also quantified relationships between clinical measures (10MWT, LEMS, and SCI-FAI) and kinematic variability metrics using linear regression models.

    "Methods": "Injury models\nAll experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and Operation Brain Trauma Therapy (approved protocol numbers 14013150, 17019898, and 17091175). Animals were handled in compliance with\nAnimal Research: Reporting of\nIn Vivo\nExperiments (ARRIVE) guidelines\n(see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). C57/BL6 male mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME), 12\u201315 weeks of age, weighing 25\u201330\u2009g were used.\nTwo models were studied: controlled cortical impact (CCI) alone, versus a combined injury model of CCI plus pressure controlled HS. To assess the effect of glibenclamide on cerebral edema at 24\u2009h, mice were randomly divided into five groups (\nn\n=\u200910 per group,\nFig. S1\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n): CCI in glibenclamide treatment versus vehicle, CCI+HS in glibenclamide treatment versus vehicle, and na\u00efve. Injury by CCI or CCI+HS was induced in concordance with our standard established models that have been described previously and successfully used in our laboratory for prior investigations.\n27\u201329\nThe level of injury in both CCI and CCI+HS was moderate at 5\u2009m/sec and 1\u2009mm depth to the left parietal cortex. The craniotomies were sealed closed with Koldmount hardener immediately after impact. Procedures were performed during daylight hours in the surgical laboratory.\nIn the CCI+HS model, HS was induced per protocol by removing 2.3\u2009mL blood/100\u2009g over 15\u2009min, followed by a controlled mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 25\u201327\u2009mm Hg for 20\u2009min maintained by removal or infusions of citrated autologous blood from the femoral venous catheter in 0.05\u2009mL aliquots. This produced a 35\u2009min period of severe hypotension. Following 35\u2009min of HS, mice entered a \u201cpre-hospital\u201d phase for 90\u2009min in which they were resuscitated with lactated Ringer's (LR) solution for a MAP goal \u226570\u2009mm Hg (initial bolus 20\u2009mL/kg, and additional 10\u2009mL/kg boluses over 5\u2009min as needed to maintain MAP >70\u2009mm Hg). The subsequent \u201chospital\u201d phase involved reinfusion of the remaining shed blood over 15\u2009min, to mimic clinical care in emergency departments or combat hospitals.\nFollowing glibenclamide treatment versus vehicle (see subsection for dosing), mice were decapitated at 24\u2009h. The brains were removed immediately and the hemispheres were bisected for quantification of brain edema by a technician blinded to treatment. The same protocol was followed to assess the effect of glibenclamide on cerebral edema at 72\u2009h in the combined injury model CCI+HS (\nn\n=\u20099 per group).\nFor all experiments, mice were anesthetized per our standard protocol with 4% isoflurane with a gas mixture of 2:1 nitrous oxide to oxygen. Isoflurane was reduced to 1\u20132% after surgical procedures and mice were placed on room air 10\u2009min prior to injury. Isoflurane was maintained at 1% with room air through the 90\u2009min pre-hospital phase and then switched to 100% O\n2\nwith 1% isoflurane through the hospital phase.\n\nGlibenclamide infusion and level determination\nA stock solution of 2.5 \u03bcg/\u03bcL glibenclamide was made in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) from which a loading dose solution (20\u2009\u03bcg/mL) was made in unbuffered normal saline. These solutions were used for all experiments.\nThe effect of glibenclamide was assessed at 24\u2009h (\nn\n=\u200910/group/model) and 72\u2009h (\nn\n=\u20099/group/model) using an intravenous (IV) loading dose of glibenclamide (20\u2009\u03bcg/kg) that was given 10\u2009min post-CCI, or at the start of the pre-hospital phase in CCI+HS, followed by a continuous subcutaneous (SQ) infusion at 0.4\u2009\u03bcg/h (Alzet mini-pump). This treatment regimen was derived as the mouse-equivalent based on rat doses of 10\u2009\u03bcg/kg used in prior studies of glibenclamide post-TBI and a body-surface-area-adjusted species conversion.\n20\n,\n30\n,\n31\nThis protocol was used for all mice and continued for 24\u2009h or 72\u2009h after the insult depending on the group being studied. In addition to studies assessing cerebrovascular and systemic hemodynamics after CCI+HS, we also used this protocol in separate mice to quantify glibenclamide levels in blood. Here, the infusion was continued for 4 days.\nGlibenclamide levels (\nn\n=\u20095/group) were determined by ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-mass spectrometer (MS) MS/MS 15\u2009min post-IV load, 1\u2009h post-loading dose plus SQ pump infusion, and at 4 days post-loading dose plus SQ pump infusion to determine steady state levels of the drug. A separate cohort of uninjured mice were used for this determination, because the volume of plasma required by the UPLC MS/MS method were prohibitive in terms of increasing mortality as well as altering our established model. Repeated withdrawal of blood samples in a model of HS would potentially also alter the fluid resuscitation strategy after HS and further influence edema. Blood samples were obtained using cardiac puncture, to avoid potential confounding/dilution by peripheral line draws. Glibenclamide levels were compared with vehicle (\nn\n=\u20093). The UPLC-MS/MS method\n32\ninvolved liquid-liquid extraction and detection with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Serum (0.2\u2009mL), spiked with glimiperide as internal standard was acidified with hydrochloric acid and extracted with hexanes:methylene chloride (50:50), dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen, and reconstituted in 50\u2009\u03bcL of 50:50 acetonitrile:deionized water. Glibenclamide and glimiperide were eluted from a Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18, 1.7\u2009\u03bcm, 2.1\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009mm reversed-phase column, isocratically with acetonitrile:water (0.1% formic acid) 50:50. Detection and quantitation were achieved in the positive mode with a Thermo Fisher TSQ Quantum Ultra mass spectrometer interfaced via a heated electrospray ionization (HESI) probe with the Waters UPLC Acquity solvent delivery system. Transitions used for analysis were 494.1 \u2192 368.9 for glibenclamide and 491 \u2192 352 for the internal standard. The calibration curves, obtained from extracting known concentrations of glibenclamide from double-stripped serum, ranged from 0.1\u2009ng/mL (lower limit of quantitation) to 16\u2009ng/mL. All back calculations of calibrators, inter-day and intra-day precision and accuracy, and stability were within acceptable limits. Concurrent glucose levels for all animals at baseline and the abovementioned time points (after HS at 35min, PH at 2h, and HOSP at \u223c2.5h) were obtained using a blood gas analyzer (Model ABL-90, Radiometer America, Westlake, OH).\n\nDetermination of brain edema\nPercent brain water (%BW) was quantified for all mice using the established wet-dry weight technique, which represents a gold standard for its assessment.\n33\nBecause perfusion with normal saline alters water levels and provides inaccurate assessment of edema, mice were not perfused with normal saline before brains were harvested for water measurements. Rather, at the completion of the injury described previously, mice were decapitated at each time point (under 5% isoflurane and 50/50 gas mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen) and the brain was bisected into hemispheres that were immediately weighed; these weights were recorded as wet weights. Hemispheres were subsequently dehydrated for 72\u2009h in an oven at 110\u00b0C and re-weighed to record dry weights. %BW was determined by subtracting the dry weight from the wet weight, dividing this number by the wet weight, and multiplying by 100.\n\nStatistical analysis\nGlibenclamide levels, glucose concentrations, and ipsilateral and contralateral %BW were reported as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error. Normality was determined by Q-Q plots (\nFig. S2\n)(see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). Differences between %BW in naive, vehicle-, and glibenclamide-treated animals were assessed using one way ANOVA, and between-group comparisons were made using Student's\nt\ntest. Multiple comparisons during post-hoc analyses were adjusted for using Bonferroni's correction. Physiological parameters were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. Outliers were excluded using Dixon's test. Statistical significance was determined by\np\nvalues <0.05. All statistical tests were conducted using Stata 13.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX)."

    "Methods": "Animals and experimental design\nAdult male Long-Evans (Blue Spruce, HsdBlu:LE; Envigo) outbred rats were used in this study. At the time of blast, rats were approximately 3.5 months of age (420\u2013450\u2009g). Non-blast-exposed, age-matched male Long-Evans rats served as controls. Animals were housed under normal 12:12 light:dark conditions (ambient lighting, approximately 40 lux), with chow and water provided\nad libitum\n, and ambient room temperature (approximately 22\u201325\u00b0C). All animal procedures were approved by the respective Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs) of both the VA Western New York Healthcare System (VAWNYHS) and the Atlanta VA Medical Center, and conformed to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology's (ARVO's)\nStatement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Visual Research\nand\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n(National Research Council of the National Academies, United States, 8th edition).\nBlast injury was performed at the Buffalo VA Medical Center. After one month of recovery, animals were shipped to the Atlanta VA Medical Center for functional assessments, including electroretinography (ERG), optomotor response (OMR), spectral domain\u2013optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and Y-maze testing. Unless otherwise specified, all functional outcomes measures were performed at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months post-blast exposure. One rat was excluded from the 8-month Y-maze test because it was too large to move in the maze. Also, some OCT scans were deemed unusable due to blurring of the images caused by breathing movements; therefore, those data were excluded from the analysis. At the termination of experimental procedures, animals were euthanized either by decapitation or perfusion, depending on the specific application; these procedures were conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Panel on Euthanasia of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA).\n\nAcoustic blast overpressure (ABO) exposure\nABO exposure was performed under closed-globe conditions, using a modified shock tube device (\nFig. 1A,B\n) described in detail elsewhere.\n17\nBriefly, prior to blast exposure, rats were anesthetized (intramuscular [IM] injection) with a mixture of ketamine (75\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (15\u2009mg/kg), and topical anesthetic (proparacaine hydrocholoride, 0.5% ophthalmic solution, Akorn, Inc.; 1\u20132 drops/eye) was instilled into each eye. Rats were then exposed to a single acoustic blast, with a sound pressure level of approximately 190 dB SPL (sound pressure \u223c63 kilopascals [kPa]), using an 80-psi backpressure load of compressed nitrogen in the shock tube. Pressure (80 psi) was measured with a standard pressure gauge (similar to that used on compressed gas cylinder regulators) mounted on the shock tube body. Sound pressure (db SPL) was measured using a pressure sensor (Model 137A23 ICP Pressure Sensor; PCB Piezotroncis) placed at the outlet of the shock tube. A brass foil diaphragm inserted near the mid-section of the shock tube and held in place by O-rings (\nFig. 1B\n) provided resistance to allow buildup of nitrogen gas behind it, which was electronically controlled by a computer (\nFig. 1C\n). When the criterion pressure inside the shock tube was achieved, a computer-controlled, solenoid-driven arrow inside the tube was thrust forward, rupturing the foil (see\nFig. 1G\n) and instantaneously releasing the backpressure, with resulting generation of an acoustic shockwave from the shock tube outlet. During blast exposure, rats were housed in a specially designed animal holding chamber (fabricated from high-density plastic on a 3D printer) bolted to the supporting table such that only the head was exposed (\nFig. 1D\n). The outlet end of the shock tube muzzle was positioned approximately 2.5 in from the head (\nFig. 1E,F\n), and the blast was directed at the right eye (OD) only, perpendicular to the body axis. The head was not physically constrained; however, as shown in\nFigure 1F\n, a large pillow was placed against the contralateral (left) side of the head, to reduce the extent of impact and recoil.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nAcoustic blast overpressure setup.\n(A,B)\nShock tube assembly.\n(C)\nCompressed gas tank and controller unit, outside blast chamber.\n(D-F)\nPlacement of rat in holder and positioning prior to blast.\n(G)\nBrass foil diaphragm before (lower image) and after (upper image) blast.\n(H)\nPressure sensor assembly, end of shock tube, and animal holder.\nFollowing blast exposure, topical antibiotic ointment (gentamycin sulfate, 0.3% ophthalmic ointment; Akorn, Inc.) was administered to each eye to maintain corneal hydration, and animals were returned to their cages in a recovery area; body temperature was maintained by placing the cages on heating pads, and animals were closely monitored for viability and signs of distress at regular intervals thereafter. In initial experiments, animals were allowed to recover naturally over the course of several hours. However, the protocol was subsequently altered (with veterinarian guidance and IACUC approval), such that anesthesia was reversed by injection of Antisedan\n\u00ae\n(1\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally [IP]; Pfizer Animal Health) within 10\u2009min following blast exposure. Blast-exposed animals were given buprenorphine (0.05\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneous [SC] injection) as an analgesic approximately 30\u201340\u2009min after Antisedan\n\u00ae\nadministration and again 24\u2009h post-blast. (Note: Empirically, we have found it extremely important not to administer buprenorphine sooner than 30\u2009min post-Antisedan\n\u00ae\ntreatment, due to respiratory suppression by buprenorphine, which can be lethal.)\nRats were allowed to recover for at least 24\u2009h prior to any further use. In the course of these studies, we encountered unanticipated death of some animals: five rats died shortly after blast exposure or were humanely euthanized following ruptured-globe injury to the contralateral eye (concussive impact with the wall of the animal housing chamber); one blast-exposed rat died over a month after injury of unknown causes but before the start of any assessments; and two blast-exposed and seven control rats died in the course of functional testing due to failure to recover from anesthesia.\n\nElectroretinography (ERG)\nERG was performed to measure retinal function, as previously described.\n18\nIn brief, rats were dark-adapted overnight and then anesthetized with a ketamine (60mg/kg)/xylazine (7.5\u2009mg/kg) mixture (for rats \u22656-months old, rats requiring additional anesthesia were given a ketamine-only booster). Corneas of the animals were anesthetized topically with tetracaine (1%) and pupils dilated with tropicamide (1%). Reference and ground-needle electrodes were placed subcutaneously in each cheek and in the tail, respectively. Retinal responses were measured directly using custom gold-loop electrodes that were placed on the corneal surface of each eye under a layer of methylcellulose. ERG stimuli consisted of five steps of full-field flashes presented under scotopic conditions in a Ganzfeld dome (\u22123.0 to 2.1 log cd sec/m\n2\n) using a commercial system (UTAS Big Shot, LKC Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). Responses were bandpass filtered (0.3\u2013500\u2009Hz) with a 250\u2009msec recording length. Retinal function was allowed to recover between each step with interflash intervals increasing from 2 to 70\u2009sec as light intensity increased. Following the fifth step, rats were light adapted for 10\u2009min (30 cd/m\n2\n) and then presented with a flickering light stimulus (2.0 log cd sec/m\n2\nat 6\u2009Hz). Amplitudes and implicit times were measured for a-waves (baseline to trough), b-waves (trough to peak), flicker b-waves (trough to peak), and oscillatory potentials (OP). OPs were filtered off-line using a 75\u2013500\u2009Hz filter (EM for Win version 8.1.2, LKC Tecnologies). Reported OP amplitudes and implicit times are the averages of OP2 from the brightest flash stimuli. Reported amplitude averages across time are for the brightest flash stimuli.\n\nOptomotor response (OMR)\nVisual function of rats was tested using a virtual optokinetic tracking system (OptoMotry\n\u00ae\n; Cerebral-Mechanics, Lethbridge, AB, Canada) as previously described.\n19\n,\n20\nIn brief, the rat is placed on a platform in the middle of a virtual-reality chamber consisting of four computer flatscreen monitors that display vertical sine wave gratings rotating at a speed of 12 deg/sec. The rat is monitored in real time with a video camera, and the experimenter monitors the presence or absence of reflexive head movements (tracking) in response to rotating gratings moving in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. Spatial frequency (SF) and CS thresholds are calculated automatically by the OptoMotry software using a staircase paradigm. For SF assessment, gratings began with a SF of 0.042 cyc/deg with 100% contrast, and the SF was adjusted while contrast remained constant. For CS assessment, measurements began at 100% contrast and were then decreased accordingly, while SF was kept constant at 0.064 cy/deg, the peak of the CS curve for the rats at baseline. The reported CS was calculated as a reciprocal of the Michelson contrast from the screen's luminance (i.e., [maximum + minimum] / [maximum \u2013 minimum]), as previously described.\n21\n\nSpectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)\nA SD-OCT system (Bioptigen 4300, Lieca Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) was used to evaluate the structural integrity of the retina. Following anesthesia (as per above), corneal anesthesia (tetracaine1%), and pupil dilation (tropicamide 1%), the rat eye was positioned in front of the SD-OCT system. A 3-mm radial scan centered at the optic nerve was then taken for each eye and 1000 a-scans per b-scan were imaged. A total of four b-scans consisting of 24 individual frames per scan were collected; only the superior to inferior and nasal to temporal scans were analyzed.\nB-scan images of all eyes were assessed manually by a trained technician using a customized MATLAB program (Mathworks, Matlab R2017a, Natick, MA). Markers were placed at the boundaries of each layer, and the program computed the thickness (in microns) of each retinal layer: retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), external limiting membrane (ELM), inner segments/outer segments (IS/OS), and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Total retinal thickness (TRT) was computed by finding the difference between the inner point of the RNFL and the outer point of the RPE. B-scan images were taken at four different orientations within the eye: superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal. Additionally, for each quadrant, thickness measurements were taken at two different distances from the optic nerve head (ONH): 0.5\u2009mm and 1.2\u2009mm. Because no statistical differences were found between quadrant or distance away from the ONH, quadrants were averaged and only the 0.5-mm measurements were analyzed.\n\nCognitive function testing (Y-maze)\nBased on methods previously described by Maurice and colleagues,\n22\nthe Y-maze was used to evaluate cognitive function. Each rat was placed in one arm of a Y-maze apparatus (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA) and allowed to freely explore for a total of 8\u2009min. During that time, the sequence and entries into each arm were recorded. An alternation was measured as consecutive entries into three different arms (i.e., ABC) on overlapping triads in which all arms were present. The final spatial alternation score was a percentage calculated by taking the actual number of successful alternations divided by the number of total possible alternations that could have been achieved (total number of entries minus two). Percentage of correct alternations and total number of entries were analyzed.\n\nImmunohistochemisty\nAt the end-point of the experiment (8 months post-blast exposure), rats were euthanatized (decapitation), and eyes (\nn\n=\u20096\u20138 per condition) were enucleated and \u201cfixed\u201d by immersion in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde (prepared from paraformaldehyde; Electron Microsopy Sciences [EMS]) overnight at 4\u00b0C, and then rinsed with chilled PBS 3 times. Fixed eyes were cryoprotected overnight at 4\u00b0C by immersion in 30% (w/v) sucrose in PBS, and then embedded in TissueTek\n\u00ae\nOptimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) Compound (EMS). Cryosections (10-\u03bcm thickness) were collected onto glass Gold Seal\u2122 UltraFrost\u2122 microscope slides (ThermoFisher Scientific), using a Leica\n\u00ae\nModel CM3050S Cryostat (Leica Microsystems), taking sections in a direction parallel to the vertical meridian and cutting through or proximal to the ONH. Tissue cryosections were then subjected to brief immersion in PBS containing 100\u2009mM glycine (to block free aldehyde groups), followed by two brief rinses in PBS. To block non-specific binding of secondary antibodies, sections were treated with non-immune (normal) goat serum (5% [v/v] in PBS, supplemented with 0.025% [v/v] saponin [Sigma-Aldrich], 0.1% [w/v] bovine serum albumin [BSA; Sigma-Aldrich], and 0.5% [w/v] fish skin gelatin [Sigma-Aldrich]). Cryosections were then briefly rinsed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X 100 (Sigma-Aldrich), and exposed (overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humidified chamber) to a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Dako #Z0334; 1:1000, diluted in PBS supplemented with 0.1% [w/v] BSA). Negative controls employed either no primary antibody, or non-immune immunoglobulin G (IgG; 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL) from goat serum; neither showed any positive immunolabeling (data not shown). After one rinse with PBS, tissue sections were incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature with fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (F(ab')\n2\n-goat anti-rabbit IgG [H+L], conjugated with AlexaFluor\n\u00ae\n647 [Invitrogen, #A21246; 1:250, diluted as for primary antibody]). Slides were rinsed with PBS, counterstained by applying IFMDD mounting medium (EMS, #17989-97/-98) containing ImmunoMount\u2122 DAPI (4\u2019,6-diamido-2-phenylindole) and DABCO\u2122 (1,4-diazobicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane), coverslipped, and examined with a Leica TCS SPEII DMI4000 scanning laser confocal fluorescence microscope, using a 635-nm laser with a laser intensity of 20.9% and arbitrary gain set at 830 to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. Images were captured using a 40X oil immersion objective (NA 1.15), and stored as TIFF files on a Microsoft Windows\n\u00ae\n-based computer, then exported to Adobe PhotoShop\n\u00ae\n.\n\nStatistical analysis\nNumerical values for outcomes measures are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). Measures of retinal (ERG) and visual (OMR) function were analyzed using linear mixed models with a single between-subject factor (blast, control) and the two within-subjects factors of time-point (2, 4, 6, and 8 months) and eye (right, left) as fixed effects. These analyses were run with a similar structure to traditional repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA; compound symmetry error structure) but made use of all available data to avoid bias. SD-OCT data had an additional factor of quadrant, which was incorporated as an additional random effect (source of dependence). Post hoc comparisons of specific time and group differences, as well as a linear trend test were performed using linear combinations of the appropriate coefficients in the model. Weights and Y-maze results were analyzed using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by a Holm-Sidak test for individual comparisons."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal experiments and care complied with federal regulations and were approved by the Loma Linda University Animal Health and Safety Committee. Male (\nn\n=\u200938) and female (\nn\n=\u200937) C57BL6J mice (RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664, 6\u20137 months old, 20\u201330\u2009g; Jackson Laboratories) were housed in a temperature-controlled animal facility on a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. Animals were randomly assigned to two groups: Sham or TBI. All Sham animals were euthanized at 1\u2009dpi (\nn\n=\u200914 Sham males,\nn\n=\u200916 Sham females). TBI animals were euthanized at either 1\u2009dpi (\nn\n=\u200912 TBI 1d males,\nn\n=\u200911 TBI 1d females) or 7\u2009dpi (\nn\n=\u200912 TBI 7d males,\nn\n=\u200910 TBI 7d females). Females were visually checked on surgery day to determine if they were in estrous. All animals were included for behavior, MRI analysis, and vessel painting procedures (\u223c12 per group). For immunohistochemistry, 4\u20135 animals per group were used.\nBefore surgery, female mice weighed 23.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23\u2009g and males weighed 29.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.22\u2009g. Before perfusion, female mice weighed 22.45\u2009\u00b1\u20090.22\u2009g, whereas male mice weighed 28.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.24\u2009g. On average, males and females lost the same percentage of body mass after surgery (3.6% for females and 3.8% for males).\n\nControlled cortical impact\nMice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3% induction, 1\u20132% maintenance) and placed in a stereotaxic frame to secure the head. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C with a heating pad during the surgery. A midline incision of the skin was made to expose the skull. A 5-mm craniotomy was carefully performed on the right side between Bregma and lambda to expose the cortex. A moderate CCI was delivered using an electromagnetically driven piston (Leica Microsystems Company, Richmond, IL) with the following parameters: 1.5-mm depth, 3-mm diameter, 2.0\u2009m/sec speed, 200\u2009msec dwell time. The skin was sutured and buprenorphine (0.01\u2009mg/kg, intramuscular) was administered after surgery to minimize pain. Sham animals underwent the entire procedure except for the impact. TBI animals were either sacrificed 1 or 7\u2009dpi. Sham animals were sacrificed at 1\u2009dpi.\n\nOpen field testing\nGeneral exploratory behavior, activity, and anxiety levels were evaluated using open field testing. Tests were carried out within the 12-h light cycle and experimenters were blinded to the treatment groups. Mice were placed in a 30\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009cm opaque open-top box and allowed to explore, unrestricted for 30\u2009min. Movements for each mouse were recorded and tracked by EthoVision software (EthoVsion XT 11.0; Noldus Information Technology, Inc., Leesburg, VA). Total distance traveled, and time in each open field area (center vs. periphery) were assessed as a measure of overall activity and anxiety. Anxiety assessment is based on conflicting innate tendencies by mice to avoid bright lights and open spaces against that of exploring their environment. More exploration of the center area suggests less anxiety-like behavior, whereas more time in the periphery in the darker area suggests more anxiety-like behavior.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging and lesion analysis\nAll animals were imaged at 1\u2009dpi (1 and 7\u2009dpi for the 7-day groups). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3% induction, 1% maintenance) and placed in the coil.\nIn vivo\nT2-weighted images (T2WI; repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE]\u2009=\u20092395.5\u2009msec/10\u2009msec, 20\u2009\u00d7\u20091-mm slices) and susceptibility-weighted images (SWI; TR/TE\u2009=\u2009617.7\u2009msec/7\u2009msec, 40\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5-mm slices) were collected with a 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 matrix on a 11.7T Bruker Avance Instrument (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA).\nLesion volume (hemorrhage and edema) were determined by personnel blinded to the groups. Edema volumes were identified by using the Hierarchical Regional Splitting (HRS) computational method (U.S. patent: 8731261; European patent: 11748009.5-1265), based on T2 relaxation times.\n27\n,\n28\nT2 value ranges for hemorrhage, edema, and normal-appearing brain matter (NABM)-containing pixels were determined by taking the average T2 value of manually segregated NABM, hemorrhage, and edema pixels in 16 random animals (8 males and 8 females) where a T2 value of >57\u2009msec was considered edema. Hemorrhage volumes were determined by using the Cheshire image processing software (version 4.3, Parexel, Waltham, MA). After confirming presence of hemorrhage with T2 relaxation times (range: 35\u201345\u2009msec) and on corresponding SWI scans. The regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on T2 scans. Hemorrhage and edema analysis was performed on brain slices between bregma 3\u2009mm and bregma \u22124\u2009mm.\n\nPerfusion and vessel painting procedure\nThis technique is based on the ability of the fluorescent dye 1,1\u2032-dioctadecyl-3,3,3\u20323\u2032-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) to bind to lipid membranes. The protocol used in our study has been modified from previous studies.\n14\n,\n26\nAt 1 or 7\u2009dpi, immediately after MRI, mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (90\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg). Vessel painting was performed by injecting a solution of DiI (0.3mg/mL in phosphate buffered saline [PBS] containing 4% dextrose, total volume 500\u2009\u03bcL) in the left ventricle, followed by a 10\u2009mL PBS flush and a 20\u2009mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) perfusion, using a peristaltic pump (8.4\u2009mL/min). Brains were extracted and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24\u2009h. Brains were then washed and stored in PBS at 4\u00b0C until imaging. Successfully vessel painted brains were selected by an investigator blinded to sex and group and were selected if they showed uniform pink staining and excellent staining of large and small vessels on the cortical surface. In this study, 60% (45/75) of the brains were successfully stained and analyzed (\nn\n=\u20097 Sham males,\nn\n=\u20098 Sham females,\nn\n=\u20099 TBI 1d males,\nn\n=\u20097 TBI 1d females,\nn\n=\u20098 TBI 7d males,\nn\n=\u20096 TBI 7d females).\n\nImaging and analysis of vessel painted brains\nBrains were imaged using a fluorescence microscope (Keyence BZ-X700; Keyence Corp., Osaka, Japan). Images of the entire brains (axial view) were acquired using the 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification and reconstructed using the XY-stitching and Z-stack features.\nClassical vessel analysis was performed by using the AngioTool software developed by Zudaire and colleagues.\n29\nIt included measures of vessel density and number of junctions. Then, fractal geometry was used to describe the complexity of the cerebral vasculature. The ImageJ plug-in FracLac allowed for the fractal analysis of vascular complexity.\n14\n,\n30\n\nBrain sectioning and immunohistochemistry\nAfter imaging, brains (\nn\n=\u20094\u20135 per group) were embedded and freeze-sectioned at 30\u2009\u03bcm in the coronal plane. All sections were collected in Antigen Preserve Solution (NeuroScience Associates, Knoxville, TN).\nFor immunostaining, tissue sections were first pre-treated with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate for 10\u2009min. They were then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) solution for 1.5\u2009h. Primary antibodies used are as follows: anti-\u03b2-catenin (1:100, Abcam Cat# ab6302 RRID:AB_305407, Cambridge, MA), anti-Von Willebrand Factor (vWF; 1:200, Abcam Cat# ab6994 RRID:AB_305689), anti-Ki67 (1:500, Abcam Cat# ab15580 RRID:AB_443209), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:500, Millipore Cat# MAB3402 RRID:AB_94844, Billerica, MA), anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1; 1:400, Wako Cat# 019-19741 RRID:AB_839504, Richmond, VA), anti-heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1; 1:200, Enzo Life Sciences Cat# ADI-SPA-895 RRID:AB_10618757, Farmingdale, NY), and fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG; 1:200, Sigma-Aldrich Cat# F0257 RRID:AB_259378). DyLight 594-labeled tomato-lectin (T-lectin; 1:200, Vector Laboratories Cat# FL-1171 RRID:AB_2307440, Burlingame, CA) was used to label the blood vessels. Primary antibodies or markers were incubated in antibody solution (0.5% BSA +0.5% Triton X) overnight. Appropriate secondary antibodies (all from Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) were incubated in antibody solution for 1.5\u2009h. Slides were coverslipped with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Cat# H-1200 RRID:AB_2336790) containing DAPI.\nFluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining was performed on three slices 720\u2009\u03bcm apart for each animal (\nn\n=\u20094\u20135 per group) to assess neuronal degeneration.\n31\n\nIHC image analysis\nAll image analysis was performed by a blinded experimenter by using the ImageJ software (ImageJ, RRID:SCR_003070, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD),\nn\n=\u20094\u20135 animals per group. For IgG, HO-1, and GFAP quantification, integrated density measures were performed on the top right quarter of the brain (containing the lesion site), on two brain slices, 720\u2009\u03bcm apart. For IBA1, vWF, and \u03b2-catenin quantification, integrated density was measured for each animal in two images captured in the peri-lesional cortex at 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification. For FJC and Ki67, stained cells were counted in the ipsilateral cortex by a blinded experimenter (on three slices per animal for FJC and 1 slice for Ki67).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll measurements and analysis were performed without knowledge of the groups or the sex. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 software (Graphpad Prism, RRID:SCR_002798, San Diego, CA). For analyses among the same sex group, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Tukey tests were performed. For analyses between sex groups, two-way ANOVA and post hoc Sidak tests were performed. For analysis of the evolution of the lesion and for Ki67-positive cell counts at 7\u2009dpi we used\nt\ntests. Outlier values were removed if they were above or below 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR), which led to removal of data for: open field test (2 males Sham and 1 female TBI 7d); MRI analysis (for 3 females Sham, 3 males Sham, 2 females TBI 1d, 1 male and 1 female TBI 7d); AngioTool analysis (for 1 male Sham, 1 male TBI 1d and 1 male TBI 7d); fractal geometry analysis (for 1 female TBI 1d and 1 male TBI 7d); \u03b2-catenin analysis (for 1 male and 1 female TBI 1d); FJC analysis (for 1 female Sham, 1 male and 1 female TBI 7d); IgG analysis (for 1 female Sham, 1 male TBI 1d, 1 male and 1 female TBI 7d); GFAP analysis (for 1 female Sham and 1 male TBI 1d), HO-1 analysis (1 male and 1 female TBI 7d), vWF analysis (for 1 female Sham, 1 male and 1 female TBI 7d). All error bars are presented as standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance was noted as *\np\n<\u20090.05, **\np\n<\u20090.01, ***\np\n<\u20090.001, or ****\np\n<\u20090.0001."

    "Methods": "Population study\nWe recruited 41subjects (27 with TBI and 14 control subjects) between the ages of 18 and 55. Subjects were consented under an institutional review board\u2013approved protocol and prospectively studied in this ClinicalTrials.gov registered study, \u201cSildenafil for Cerebrovascular Dysfunction in Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury\u201d (NCT01762475). Patients with TBI were eligible if they had suffered a moderate or severe TBI (by Department of Defense criteria\n34\ndefined by at least one of the following criteria: initial Glasgow Coma Score between 3 and 12, post-traumatic amnesia >24\u2009h, or TBI-related abnormality on neuroimaging, i.e., computed tomography [CT] or MRI). TBI participants had been injured 6 months or more before enrollment. Patients were excluded if they had: penetrating TBI, pre-existing disabling neurological or psychiatric disorder, current pregnancy, or an unstable pulmonary or vascular disorder. Controls were sex- and age-matched (\nTable 1\n). Healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled if they had no history of TBI, pre-existing disabling neurological or psychiatric disorders, or current pregnancy.\nTable\n1.\nAge and Sex Matching for Healthy Controls (HC) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Subjects\nAge (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD)\nSex (%male)\nHC (\nn\n=\u200914)\n38.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.8y\n78\nTBI (\nn\n=\u200927)\n37.6\u2009\u00b1\u200911.1y\n71\nt\n(39)\n=\u20090.28;\np\n=\u20090.78\n\u03c7\n2\n(1)\n=\u20090.32;\np\n=\u20090.57\nOpen in a separate window\nSD, standard deviation; y, years.\n\nImaging sequences\nMRI was performed on a Siemens Biograph mMR, a fully integrated 3 Tesla MRI/positron emission tomography scanner. T1 magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE), susceptibility-weighted imaging, T2-gradient echo sequences, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), DTI, FLAIR, pulsed arterial spin labeling (ASL) and MRI/blood-oxygenation-level\u2013dependent (MRI-BOLD) sequences were acquired on each subject.\nFluid-attenuated inversion recovery\nFLAIR images were acquired with the following parameters: repetition time [TR]\u2009=\u20099090\u2009ms, echo time [TE]\u2009=\u2009112\u2009ms, inversion time [TI]\u2009=\u20092450\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u2009120 degrees, and voxel size\u2009=\u20090.9\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009\u00d7\u20093.0\u2009mm\n3\n.\nDiffusion tensor imaging\nDWIs were acquired on the same scanner with parameters TR\u2009=\u20098900s, TE\u2009=\u200992\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200990 degrees, voxel size\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20093.5\u2009mm\n3\n, matrix size\u2009=\u2009128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128, and slices\u2009=\u200940.

The following parameters were established for the acquisition of 111 two-dimensional/echo planar imaging (EPI) volumes: TR/TE\u2009=\u20092700/15\u2009ms, TI1/TI2\u2009=\u2009700/1800\u2009ms.\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging with hypercapnia challenge (cerebral vascular reactivity)\nThe parameters used were: TR/TE\u2009=\u20092000/25\u2009msec, flip angle\u2009=\u200980 degrees, field of view\u2009=\u2009220\u2009\u00d7\u2009220\u2009mm\n2\n, matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, 36 slices, thicknes s\u2009=\u20093.6\u2009mm, no gap between slices, 210 volumes. During the sequence, each participant underwent hypercapnia challenge according to the methods developed previously.\n36\n,\n37\nHypercapnia is induced by breathing alternatively room air and 5% carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n) mixed with 21% O\n2\nand 74% N\n2\n. End-tidal CO\n2\n(EtCO\n2\n) was measured continuously during the experiment using a capnograph (Model 9004; Smiths Medical, Norwell, MA). Arterial oxygenation and pulse were recorded by a fingertip pulse oximeter throughout the experiment.\n\nData processing\nDiffusion tensor imaging\nImages were processed using the CATNAP software\n38\nfor tensor estimation, with the exception that EPI and eddy current distortions were removed using the TOPUP software\n39\nwithin the FMRIB software library (FSL),\n40\nwhich takes advantage of the blip-up blip-down acquisition. This pipeline also takes into account motion correction and adjustments to the gradient table performed based on patient position. Linear tensor estimation was performed followed by computation of FA.\nCerebral blood flow\nImage data analyses were performed with the Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12) and ASL data processing toolbox. The control and label ASL images were realigned and resliced to correct for head motion. Images were smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian kernel with a 4-mm full-width at half-maximum. CBF images were reconstructed using the ASL Data Processing Toolbox: ASLtbx.\nCerebral vascular reactivity\nVoxel-by-voxel CVR maps were calculated based on a linear regression between BOLD signal time courses and the vascular input function. The BOLD response signal is delayed from the EtCO\n2\n, which corresponds to the time needed for the blood to travel between the lungs to the cerebrovascular network. The EtCO\n2\ntime delay is individually corrected to achieve the maximum correlation between the two measures. CVR data were processed using a general linear model, with the EtCO\n2\ntime course utilized as the regressor to generate CVR maps for each subject. The full method is previously described by Lu and colleagues.\n41\nAll subject images (FA, mean diffusivity [MD], CBF, and CVR) were rigidly coregistered with their associated MPRAGE image using SPM12. The neuroradiologist's reports were used to identify which subjects had visible encephalomalacias (\nn\n=\u200915) and which did not (\nn\n=\u200912). The visible encephalomalacias were manually drawn on MPRAGE-registered FLAIR images by a researcher familiar with brain MRI (\nFig. 1\n). Visible MD and FA abnormalities were taken into consideration when delineating the region of encephalomalacia. The manually drawn regions were converted to binary masks using MIPAV. All MRI maps and binary masks were then normalized into a common space (MNI-atlas) using SPM12. Normalization was performed using the MPRAGE images, and then applying the same transformation to all other images. The MD, FA, CBF, and CVR maps were then z-transformed using the pool of healthy controls from the study. The average z-score within the encephalomalacia and in the normal-appearing tissue (defined as all brain tissue outside the encephalomalacia) for each subject was extracted using a custom Matlab script (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). For some images, the mask for the enephalomalacia extended slightly outside the brain attributed to geometric distortions in those images. The voxels in those extended areas were not removed for the purposes of this study, because they encompassed a very small area and therefore minimally contributed to the extracted value for that region.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRepresentative images of encephalomalacia in FLAIR, CVR, MD, FA, and CBF maps.

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants were consecutive admissions who qualified for and were prospectively enrolled in the TBIMS multi-center national database (funded by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research) at nine inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. TBIMS enrollment requires that the individual has sustained a TBI defined by at least one of the following criteria: Glasgow Coma Scale score <13 on emergency department admission, loss of consciousness >30\u2009min, post-traumatic amnesia >24\u2009h, or trauma-related intracranial abnormality on neuroimaging. Additional inclusion criteria include: age 16 years or older at the time of injury, medical care received in a TBIMS-affiliated trauma center within 72\u2009h of injury, transferred directly to an affiliated inpatient TBI rehabilitation program, and informed consent provided by legal proxy or participant. Additionally, participants in the current study had to be either English or Spanish speaking.\n\nProcedures\nThe current study was a multi-center module project conducted under the larger TBIMS project infrastructure (\nwww.tbindsc.org\n). The study was approved by institutional review boards at all participating centers. Study participants provided informed consent either independently or through a proxy during inpatient rehabilitation hospitalization or at the time of 1 or 2 year follow-up. The BTACT was administered over the telephone at one and two years post-injury, with a window of 2 months on either side of the anniversary date, coinciding with the standard TBIMS follow-up interviews. Data for the current study were collected between August 2014 and March 2017.\nThe standard BTACT assessment protocol\n12\nwas followed, including a script for introducing the measure and verbatim instructions for each subtest. Participants were asked to sit in a quiet environment to minimize distractions, and were instructed not to use paper, pencil or a calculator during the evaluation. In the TBIMS, data are collected from the best source (self or proxy); accordingly, if the follow-up interview was completed by proxy, the person with TBI was invited to come to the phone to attempt the BTACT. Performance was scored according to standard BTACT instructions, which specify stop rules based on time limits or incorrect responses. Reasons for noncompletion were also recorded. Data collectors were instructed to provide mild encouragement as suggested in the test manual, and to discontinue a subtest when (in their judgment) continuing the test would inflict unnecessary distress on the participant. The first author trained data collectors from all participating centers on the administration and scoring of BTACT via two teleconferences. Monthly teleconferences and an email list server were used to address questions or ambiguities in administration and scoring throughout the project. Most data collectors in the current study had a bachelor's degree, although there is no degree requirement for administering or scoring the BTACT. After enrollment targets were met, all data collectors were invited to complete an online survey about their experiences with the measure and the feasibility of its administration.\n\nMeasures\nBTACT\nThe BTACT\n12\nis a brief telephone-administered cognitive test battery.\n14\nThe BTACT was developed based on well-established, traditional neuropsychological tests (\nTable 1\n).\n16\n,\n17\nIts subtests (described in order of administration below) were chosen to encompass a wide range of cognitive domains and ability levels.\n12\nTable\n1.\nDescriptions of Subtests Included in the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT)\nDomain\nMeasure\nScore\nEpisodic Verbal Memory\nImmediate Recall of 15-item word list (RAVLT)\nTotal correct in 90\u2009sec\n(Optional: repetitions, intrusions, recall efficiency).\nDelayed Recall of word list\nTotal correct in 60\u2009sec\n(Optional: repetitions, intrusions, forgetting (Immediate-delayed recall)).\nWorking Memory\nDigits Backward (WAIS-III)\nLongest accurately recalled string\nReasoning\nNumber series completion\nNumber correct (five trials of increasing difficulty)\nExecutive\nAnimal Fluency\nNumber correct in 60\u2009sec\n(Optional: repetitions, intrusions)\nRed Green: Alternating condition\nNumber correct in 32 trials\nProcessing Speed\nRed Green Test\nSimple: say STOP for red, GO for green\nNumber correct in 20 trials\nReverse: opposite (Inhibition)\nNumber correct in 20 trials\nAlternating: simple/reverse (Flexibility)\nNumber correct in 32 trials\nBackward Counting Task\nTotal correct, errors, skips in 30\u2009sec\nOpen in a separate window\nRAVLT, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test; WAIS-III, Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition.\nRey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT).\n18\n,\n19\nThe RAVLT paradigm used in the BTACT consists of one 15-item immediate recall trial and a delayed recall trial. The 15-item word list is read to the participant with a 1-sec pause between words. The participants are then given 90\u2009sec to freely recall as many words on the list as possible, in any order. Approximately 15\u2009min later, participants are asked to again freely recall as many words as possible, without any cues from the examiner.\nDigits Backward.\n20\nAdapted from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),\n20\nthis test requires participants to read a series of digits, beginning with a length of two, and are asked to orally reproduce the digits in reverse order. If participants incorrectly respond to a trial, they are given a second trial of the same span length. If both trials at the same span length are failed, the test is discontinued; otherwise, the span length increases up to a maximum of eight digits.\nNumber Series\nParticipants are read a sequence of five numbers and are asked to provide the sixth number in the series. Successful performance on this test requires the ability to recognize the pattern in the five number stimuli and use that pattern to derive the sixth number. Five different series are presented.\nAnimal Fluency\nParticipants are asked to verbally name as many animals as possible in 60\u2009sec.\nRed/Green Switch Test\nDuring the first phase of this three-phase test, participants hear either the word \u201cred\u201d or the word \u201cgreen,\u201d and are asked to respond with either \u201cstop\u201d or \u201cgo,\u201d respectively. During the baseline-reverse phase, they are asked to respond by saying, \u201cgo\u201d to a \u201cred\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d to a \u201cgreen\u201d stimulus. This is followed by a mixed phase, where the task demands alternate unpredictably between the normal and reverse conditions.\nBackward Counting Task\nParticipants are asked to count backwards by 1 starting at 100, as quickly as possible, for 30\u2009sec.\nFIM\nThe FIm\n2\nwas collected by trained research staff at 1- and 2-year follow-up via structured interview with the subject or caregiver. The FIM includes 18 items, each of which is scored on a scale ranging from 1 (total assistance) to 7 (complete independence). The FIM Total Score is calculated by adding the score from each of the 18 items (range: 18\u2013126). FIM Motor (13 items; score range 13\u201391) and FIM Cognitive (five items; score range 5\u201335) subscale scores can be derived from the total score and have been validated for use with persons with TBI.\n21\nGlasgow Outcome Scale\u2013Extended (GOSE)\nThe GOSE\n5\n,\n22\nis a global outcome measure that assesses level of independence in and out of the home, return to work and leisure activities, changes in relationships, and other symptoms following TBI. Scores are assigned based on areas of function characterized by the greatest degree of disability (1\u2009=\u2009death, 2\u2009=\u2009vegetative, 3\u2009=\u2009low severe disability, 4\u2009=\u2009upper severe disability, 5\u2009=\u2009low moderate disability, 6\u2009=\u2009upper moderate disability, 7\u2009=\u2009low good recovery, 8\u2009=\u2009upper good recovery). It is administered via structured interview at 1 and 2 years post-injury as part of the TBIMS follow-up. The GOSE may be completed by the subject or a caregiver.\nBTACT Test Completion Codes\nTo characterize the feasibility of administering the BTACT in our cohort, a Test Completion Code (developed for this project;\nTable 2\n) was assigned to each BTACT subtest. In addition to providing information about logistical and other barriers to subtest completion, the codes allow imputation of the lowest or worst possible scores when data are missing not due to logistical or other reasons but rather due to severity of cognitive impairment preventing subtest completion.\n23\u201325\nTable\n2.\nTest Completion Codes\nCode\nDescription\nExamples\n1\nTest administered in full, results are valid\nObjective performance score is obtained.\nTest Attempted but NOT Completed Due to:\n2\n*\nSeverity of cognitive deficits\nSeverity of cognitive impairment, receptive or expressive language impairment preclude completion of the test.

We calculated a BTACT composite score\n13\n,\n16\nby deriving a z-score for each of five subtests (the Red/Green test is not included in this composite) based on the mean and the standard deviation (SD) of the overall MIDUS II Cognitive Project sample,\n14\nand then averaged and re-standardized (mean\u2009=\u20090, SD\u2009=\u20091) these five z-scores to produce a composite z-score.\n13\n,\n16\nWe calculated standardized scores for each subtest by age decade, education, and gender based on the MIDUS II Cognitive Study sample.\n14\nWe performed descriptive analyses (percentiles, mean, SD, range) to describe the completion rates and administration times among the different BTACT subtests. We used correlations to evaluate the relationships between the BTACT summary scores, FIM Cognition subscale scores (FIM Cog), and GOSE; we used paired t-tests to evaluate changes in BTACT scores between time-points. For these analyses, we used worst-score imputation for BTACT subtests among individuals who were unable to provide performance scores due to severity of cognitive impairment, based on noncompletion codes.\n23\nAll quantitative analyses were performed using IBM SPSS software\n26\nor Stata.\n27\nWe tabulated responses from the BTACT Data Collector Survey and grouped the responses by feasibility question and by BTACT subtest, as appropriate."

    "Methods": "Protocol and registration\nNo existing review protocol structured the present paper. We completed this systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)\n37\ncriteria.\n\nEligibility criteria\nGiven the above, our review relies on peer-reviewed research that fits two defined criteria: CTE and radioimaging of CTE pathology. For the purpose of this systematic review, we will consider CTE to be a degenerative neuropathological condition brought on by exposure to RHT. This follows from the pathological definition of McKee and colleagues.\n7\nThis definition is deliberately broad to allow for examination of literature addressing imaging of tau, \u03b2-amyloid, and neuroinflammation. The terms \u201chead injury\u201d and \u201cconcussion\u201d are loosely defined constructs in the literature and are included in our definition to allow for inclusion of a larger subset of potentially relevant research. Head injury does not necessarily entail concussion, and evidence suggests that CTE antecedents can include subconcussive impacts\n38\n; a 2015 review found that 16% of CTE subjects had no previous concussion history.\n39\nAs such, \u201cconcussion\u201d or \u201cbrain injury\u201d were not required terms for inclusion and for the purposes of this review, RHT is used in favor of these terms. For this review, radioimaging of CTE pathology is considered to be PET imaging aimed at identifying tau pathology, \u03b2-amyloid pathology, or neuroinflammatory pathology. Given our terms, we excluded studies that a) did not include a population with exposure to RHT, and b) did not use radioisotopes shown to bind to tau, beta amyloid, or neuroinflammatory processes.\nWe identified imaging tracers\na priori\nfor inclusion in this review based on established evidence for their efficacy. The recent reviews by Okamura and colleagues\n39\nand Villemagne and Okamura\n24\nserved as a scaffold for selection of tau-selective radioligands for this review, and identification of 18F-FDDNP as a dual tracer of tau and \u03b2-amyloid. Radioisotopes identified by these reviews as being tau selective are as follows: 18F-THK-5105, 18F-THK-5117, 18F-THK-5351, 18F-AV-1451 (18F-T807), 11C-PBB3, and 18F-RO6958948. Studies using these isotopes were therefore interpreted as tau imaging studies. In another review, Rowe and Villemagne\n40\nidentified 18F-florbetapir, 11C-PIB, 18F-florbetaben, and 18F-flutemetamol as selective radioisotopes for the imaging of \u03b2-amyloid. Studies using these isotopes were interpreted as \u03b2-amyloid imaging studies. For interpretation of studies as\nin vivo\ncharacterization of neuroinflammation, the radioisotopes 11C-PBR28\n18\nand 11C-DPA-713\n41\nwere chosen since they have been shown to demonstrate glial activation characteristic of neuroinflammatory processes.\n\nInformation sources and search procedure\nWe searched computerized databases (PubMed, Ovid, and Google Scholar), citations in reviewed articles, and references provided by colleagues. In order to conduct a comprehensive review of the literature, a list of search terms encompassing general phrases and specific radioligands pertinent to our definitions was created. Our searches encompassed all possible permutations of nine CTE terms and 16 radioimaging search terms (\nTable 1\n) encompassing 144 individual search queries. These search queries were collapsed into a single-string Boolean search phrase (\nAppendix 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n) for use in PubMed and Ovid, without the application of filters. Authors known to conduct research in this domain were used as search terms in PubMed, Ovid, and Google Scholar. Additional searches were conducted in Google Scholar using the search terms identified in\nTable 1\n. Only articles published or known to us before May 22, 2017, were included.\nTable\n1.\nSearch Terms\nImaging terms\nCTE terms\nTHK-5105\nCTE\nTHK-5117\nChronic traumatic encephalopathy\nTHK-5351\nHead injury\nAV-1451\nConcussion\nT807\nBoxing\nPBB3\nFootball\nRO6958948\nRugby\nPET\nContact sports\nPositron emission Tomography\nMilitary\nFlorbetapir\nPIB\nFlorbetaben\nflutemetamol\nPBR28\nNeuroinflammation\nOpen in a separate window\nCTE, chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\n\nStudy selection\nFor each search engine queried, article titles were reviewed and irrelevant results were removed (i.e., review articles, animal models, or articles not addressing either of our searched criteria). After the initial database search, authors BL and ML independently reviewed the ensuing data and came to consensus on which articles to include for each step in the selection process. Articles were culled after abstract review if they did not use methods relevant to our research question (e.g., the use of FDG PET only or use of a sample with a single head injury only). We reviewed in full those articles that included people with a history of repetitive head trauma (RHT) and PET imaging using one of our preselected radioisotopes. When papers were read in full, they were assessed in terms of their content and methodological rigor. For articles read in full, authors BL, ML, and SB arrived at consensus regarding the interpretation of these results for discussion in this article.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe number of unique research articles using PET imaging to investigate CTE was not sufficient to conduct a meta-analysis. The present review included any studies that investigated our constructs adequately and met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. No additional statistical analyses were performed. Risks of bias for the studies included are addressed below.\nAs the number of participants in a given study was highly variable, we opted against a strict study-to-study comparison in our synthesis of the retrieved data. In our summary of the literature, the proportion of individuals with identified pathology in a given region will be reported along with the number of individuals with RHT on whom these observations were made. Note that these figures only include those with exposure to RHT. The number of control participants when included in studies are reflected in\nTable 2\n.\nTable\n2.\nGeneral Sample Information\nArticle\nReference method\nn\u2009=\u2009RHT/CN\nAge (CN)\nEducation (CN)\nSmall and colleagues\n48\nCerebellar gray matter\n5 (5)\n59 (60)\n17 (15)\nBarrio and colleagues\n43\nCerebellar gray matter\n14 (28)\n57.2 (64.3)\n16.2 (N.R.)\nJordan and colleagues\n46\nWhole cerebellum\n1\n39\n16\nMitsis and colleagues\n47\nWhole cerebellum\n1\n71\n16\nCoughlin and colleagues\n45\nRegional DVR\n11 (9)\n64.8 (58.3)\n16.7 (16.0)\nCoughlin and colleagues\n44\nRegional DVR\n12 (11)\n31.3 (27.6)\n16.8 (16.9)\nOpen in a separate window\nRHT, repeated head trauma; CN, control; N.R., not reported; DVR, distribution volume ratio."

    "Methods": "Animals and spinal cord injury rat model\nAdult female Fischer rats were housed according to National Institutes of Health guidelines and the Guide for the Care and Use of Animals. Only female rats were selected for this study to decrease potential microbiota variations related to differential recovery, because there are significant differences in locomotor performance and volumes of preserved gray and white matter within the injured cord segment between male and female rats.\n28\nAll animal procedures were approved by the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were handled by a core facility, and all samples collected from animals were blinded before being transferred to laboratory personnel for processing and analysis. Before surgery, animals were weighed and anesthetized with a mixture of 2% isoflurane and 40% oxygen and prepared for surgery as previously described.\n28\nAn adequate level of anesthesia was determined by monitoring the corneal and hindlimb withdrawal reflexes. Backs were next shaved and aseptically prepared with chlorhexidine and lacrilube ophthalmic ointment applied to eyes to prevent drying. Rats were placed on a warming pad to maintained body temperature at 37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C as assessed by a rectal probe.\nRats were next subjected to a moderately severe contusion injury using the MASCIS (Multicenter Animal Spinal Cord Injury Study) weight-drop device (NYU Impactor).\n29\nA laminectomy at thoracic vertebra T9 was produced exposing the dura mater. Stabilization clamps were placed to support the column and the exposed spinal cord (T10) injured by dropping a 10.0-g rod from a height of 25.0\u2009mm. After injury, muscles were sutured and the skin closed with metal clips. Rats were allowed to recover in a warmed cage (approximately 30\u00b0C) with water and food easily accessible for 24\u2009h. Standard rodent diet was given with filtered, sterilized water (water bottles were fitted with long curved sipper tubes) and animals were kept on Alpha Dri\n\u00ae\nbedding (changed three times a week) in pairs. Post-recovery, rats were kept at approximately 24\u00b0C with 12-h on/off light cycles. All rats, both SCI and sham-operated controls, received antibiotic treatment (gentamicin, 5\u2009mg/kg) for the first 7 days after surgery to prevent additional infections. The analgesic, Buprenex (0.03\u2009mg/kg), was also given daily for 2 days. Bladders were manually expressed twice-daily until bladder function returned. Animals had access to flood and water\nad libitum\n. Sham-operated animals that underwent all surgical procedures to expose the spinal cord, but were not injured, served as controls. Pairs were assigned after SCI and control surgery recovery, allowing for co-housing of injured and uninjured animals.\n\nTissue sampling\nThis study consisted of four groups of animals: 1) controls, that is, sham-operated but not injured rats, which were sacrificed 4 weeks post-sham surgery (\nn\n=\u20098); 2) SCI-injured rats, which were sacrificed 4 weeks post-SCI (\nn\n=\u20098); 3) controls, that is, sham-operated but not injured rats, which were sacrificed 8 weeks post-sham surgery (\nn\n=\u20098); and 4) SCI-injured rats sacrificed 8 weeks post-SCI (\nn\n=\u20098). Eight weeks post-injury would be used for the subsequent microbiome sequencing to model a long-term SCI injury,\n30\nwhereas 4 weeks post-injury served as a time point for comparison of cytokine and QSM levels over time. The entire intestine, stomach excluded, was collected at sacrifice. Intestinal content was manually extracted from the whole intestine, by cutting open of the intestines and collecting the internal content, and mixed to homogenize prior to microbiome sequencing. In preparation for QSM and cytokine analysis, tissue from the small intestine was homogenized by douce homogenizer, in an equal amount (weight/volume) of distilled, deionized water, and intestinal content was diluted 1:100 in deionized water.\n\nMicrobiome sequencing\nIntestinal content samples from rats at 8 weeks post-SCI or sham surgery were sequenced by 16S V4 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were considered significant if the false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected\np\nvalue was less than or equal to 0.05 and the absolute value of the log\n2\nfold change was greater than or equal to 1. Microbiome data processing and multi-variate statistical analyses were performed utilizing PhyCA-Stats\n\u2122\nanalysis software. Probe intensities were background subtracted and scaled to Control Mix. Hybridization scores were calculated as log\n2\n(mean probe fluorescence intensity)\u2009\u00d7\u20091000. OTUs were defined by high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, with the majority demonstrating >99% intra-OTU concordance. Before classification analysis, data reduction was done by multiple filtering steps, and taxa-sample intersections were calculated using abundance (AT) and binary matrices (BT). Pair-wise BT and AT dissimilarity scores were computed using Unifrac and weighted Unifrac (Wunifrac) distance metric. Wunifrac metric considers OTU abundance in addition to phylogenetic distance between OTUs. Hierarchical clustering by average-neighbor and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) were used to graphically summarize intersample relationships according to AT and BT dissimilarity scores. Unsupervised classification using the nearest shrunken centroid method was used to identify OTUs with most significant differences in abundance between groups. A randomization/Monte Carlo permutation\u2013based test (Adonis test) was utilized for significance testing of differences between discrete and continuous variables.\n\nProinflammatory cytokines\nConcentrations of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-12, macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were determined in small intestine homogenates from all four animal groups (described in\nBlood and tissue sampling\nsection) by using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nQuorum sensing molecules\nBiosensors based on\nEscherichia coli\n\u2013containing plasmids that include the genes of a transcriptional regulator of the short-chain AHL (pSB406 plasmid) and long-chain AHL (pSB1075) QS communication pathways along with a bioluminescent reporter gene were used in these studies as described previously.\n26\nAdditionally, a biosensor for AI-2 was based upon genetically modified\nVibrio harveyi\n(MM32) as described previously.\n24\nBriefly, overnight cultures of cells were refreshed in LB broth (pSB406 and pSB1075) or AB media (MM32) and grown to OD600 0.45 (pSB406 and pSB1075) or 0.05 (MM32). Dose-response curves to determine response to analyte were generated from the cognitive analyte for each sensor (C6-AHL for pSB406, C12-AHL for pSB1075, and AI-2 for MM32). Analyte (10\u2009\u03bcL) or intestinal content (1% weight per volume in distilled, deionized water) was added to 90\u2009\u03bcL of sensor and incubated for 2\u2009h before determination of bioluminescent intensity.\n\nStatistical analysis\nMicrobiota data were analyzed as described in the above Microbiome Sequencing section. Cytokine and QSM analysis data were expressed as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009the standard deviation of mean and analyzed in GraphPad Prism 7.04. Statistical significance was assessed with Student's\nt\ntest, unless otherwise stated."

    "Methods": "Animals and TBI\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine (Animal Welfare Assurance A3224-01) and were done according to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The ARRIVE guidelines, introduced by a team led by the UK National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement, and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs), were followed when conducting this study. C57/BL6 male mice, 8\u201312 weeks old and weighing 24\u201332\u2009g, were prospectively randomized to experimental groups (sham, 4\u2009h, 24\u2009h) for TBI, and experimental groups (na\u00efve, sham-saline, untreated, enoxaparin, anti-ASC) for adoptive transfer and treatment. For TBI experiment groups, sham animals underwent surgical procedure but were not injured. For adoptive transfer and treatment studies, the sham-saline group underwent surgical procedures and received saline as vehicle treatment. Na\u00efve animals underwent no surgical procedures. A sample size of 5\u20136 was used for each group based on power analysis (using G* power analysis, with an effect size F\u2009=\u20090.85, \u03b1 set at 0.05) and historical data.\n21\n,\n22\nAll mice were housed in the viral antigen free (VAF) animal facility at the Lois Pope Life Center at the University of Miami on 12-h light/dark cycles; food and water were supplied\nad libitum\n.\nMice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (intraperitoneal, i.p.) and TBI was performed using a controlled cortical impact (CCI) model, as previously described\n23\u201325\nInjury was induced using the ECCI-6.3 device (Custom Design & Fabrication, Richmond, VA) at 6\u2009m/sec velocity, 0.8\u2009mm depth, and 150\u2009msec impact duration.\n2\n6\nAnesthetized animals were not physiologically monitored during and after TBI or sham surgery. However, animals were observed post-op; they were kept on a heating pad and body temperature was controlled with a rectal probe, and maintained at 37\u00b0C, in our operation room and then they were transferred to the animal quarters. Animals were sacrificed at 4 and 24\u2009h after TBI. Sham animals were anesthetized and subjected to the same pre-surgical incision as injured animals.\n\nTissue collection\nAll animals were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine, prior to perfusion. Animals then underwent tracheal perfusion. Lungs were infused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) using a tracheal catheter at 20\u2009cm H\n2\nO and then fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C. Fixed lung tissues were paraffin embedded and 5-\u03bcm sections were processed.\n27\nAnimals then underwent decapitation and right cortical tissue was collected for protein isolation and molecular analyses.\n\nPyroptosome isolation assay\nMice lung tissue lysates were filtered through a 5-\u03bcm low-binding polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Milipore). Supernatant was centrifuged at 2700\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 8\u2009min. The pellet was resuspended in 40\u2009\u03bcL of 3[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS) buffer (20\u2009mmol/L HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5\u2009mmol/L MgCl2, 0.5\u2009mmol/L EGTA, 0.1\u2009mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor cocktail, and 0.1% CHAPS). The pyroptosome was pelleted by centrifugation at 2700\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 8\u2009min. The pellet was then resuspended and incubated in 27.8\u2009\u03bcL of CHAPS buffer with 2.2\u2009\u03bcL of disuccinimidyl substrate for 30\u2009min at room temperature to cross-link ASC dimers. Lastly, an equal amount of 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009Laemmli buffer was added and proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies to ASC and Gasdermin-D (GSD).\n\nNuclear and cytoplasmic extraction\nNuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were extracted using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer instructions. Briefly, mice lung tissue samples were cut into 20- to 100-mg pieces and centrifuged at 500\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 5\u2009min. Tissue pieces were the homogenized with the Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent and centrifuged at 16,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 5\u2009min. Then the supernatant (cellular extract) was removed and the pellet was centrifuged with Nuclear Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific) at 16,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 10\u2009min. This supernatant corresponded to the nuclear fraction, which was removed and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nImmunoblotting\nLung and brain tissue samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Two-millimeter sections of right lower lung and right cortical tissue were homogenized in extraction buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St Louis, MO) and resolved in 4\u201320% Tris-TGX Criterion gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)\n19\nusing antibodies to caspase-1 (Novus Biologicals), ASC (Santa Cruz), IL-1\u03b2 (Cell Signaling), IL-18 (Abcam), AIM2 (Santa Cruz), and HMGB1 (Millipore). Quantification was performed using Image Lab and all data were normalized to \u03b2-actin.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nTissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and then rehydrated using ethanol and Tris buffer saline. Immunohistochemical procedures were then carried out for double staining.\n27\nSections were incubated overnight with antibodies against caspase-1 and ASC (Millipore), AIM2 (Santa Cruz), HMGB1 (Millipore), and SPC (Millipore). Immunostained lung sections of sham, 4\u2009h, and 24\u2009h mice were examined with a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Lung sections were analyzed by individuals who were blinded to the groups.\n\nEV isolation\nEV were isolated from serum from TBI-injured mice and sham mice using the Total Exosome Isolation (TEI) solution (Invitrogen). 100\u2009\u03bcL of each sample were centrifuged at 2000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 30\u2009min. The supernatant was then incubated with 20\u2009\u03bcL of TEI for 30\u2009min followed by centrifugation at 10,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 10\u2009min. The pellet was resuspended in 100\u2009\u03bcL of PBS. EV were characterized by the expression of CD81 and by Nanosight Tracking analysis (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com/neu\n).\n\nAdoptive transfer of EV\nSerum-derived EV from TBI and sham mice were injected into na\u00efve mice through the jugular vein at a dose of 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n10\nparticles/g/body weight.\n28\nParticle count was measured by Nanosight Tracking analysis and samples were diluted accordingly. Prior to surgery animals were anesthetized with ketamine and xylene. Serum-derived EV were transferred and lung and brain tissues were collected 24\u2009h after injection for analysis.\n\nEnoxaparin and anti-ASC treatment\nSerum-derived EV from TBI mice were injected into na\u00efve mice through a jugular vein injection. One hour later, enoxaparin (3\u2009mg/kg) and anti-ASC (5mg/kg) were administered to recipient animals. The following groups were used: 1) the na\u00efve group received no treatment, 2) the sham-saline group was used as a negative control and underwent jugular vein injection of only saline, 3) the untreated group received EV from TBI mice without any treatment and was used as a positive control, 4) the ENOX group received EV from TBI mice and enoxaparin, and 5) the anti-ASC group received EV from TBI mice and anti-ASC. To carry out studies in a double-blinded and unbiased manner the treatment bottles were masked with opaque tape. Randomization to the study groups was performed by a research assistant who was not involved in the delivery of treatment and data analyses. In addition, study investigators were unaware of the randomization until study completion. Lung and brain tissues were collected 24\u2009h after injection for analysis.\n\nHistology and lung injury scoring\nLung tissue sections were stained by a standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) method for histology, morphometry and ALI scoring. Lung sections were scored by a pathologist (who was blinded to the groups) using the ALI Scoring System from the American Thoracic Society Workshop Report.\n29\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed using a Student's\nt\ntest for two groups and a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests, (GraphPad Prism version 7.0) for two or more groups. D'Agostino-Pearson test was used to test for normality. Data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM).\nP\nvalues of significance used were *\np\n<\u20090.05."

T1-weighted 3D images were acquired with magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo imaging (MPRAGE) using the following acquisition parameters: GRAPPA mode; acceleration factor phase encoding (PE)\u2009=\u20092; repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)/T1\u2009=\u20091900/3.26/900\u2009msec; field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009250\u2009\u00d7\u2009250\u2009mm\n2\n; an axial plane acquisition with isotropic voxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm, flip angle\u2009=\u2009nine degrees. A 12-channel head coil was used.\nPartway through the study, scanning moved from the UCLA Brain Mapping Center (BMC) to the Staglin IMHRO Center for Cognitive Neuroscience (Staglin). Both scanners were 3T Siemens Trio scanners, and the protocol was maintained. To determine that scanner change did not introduce bias into our data, we scanned six healthy adult volunteers at both the BMC and Staglin centers, 1.5 months apart. We then assessed possible scanner effects based on the T1-weighted image pairs. Extensive details of this process can be found in our previous article.\n8\nMRSI data were obtained using a volumetric spin-echo EPSI sequence (TR/TE\u2009=\u20091710\u2009msec/70\u2009msec, FOV: 280\u2009\u00d7\u2009280\u2009\u00d7\u2009180\u2009mm\n3\n, 100 [read]\u2009\u00d7\u200950 [phase]\u2009\u00d7\u200918 [slice] spatial samples over a 135-mm slab, and acquisition time of 26\u2009min). This method has been validated and used previously in a number of publications.\n23\n,\n29\nIt included frequency-selective water suppression and inversion-recovery nulling of the lipid signal with T1\u2009=\u2009198\u2009msec. This pulse sequence included both a spin-echo excitation for the metabolite signals and a low flip-angle gradient-echo acquisition of a water reference signal, which was acquired in an interleaved fashion.\nThe MPRAGE MRI and MRSI acquisitions were performed at the same angulation, with the slice or slab orientations of all acquisitions parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) plane, or angulated at +15 degrees from the AC-PC, which was found to facilitate improved magnetic field homogeneity over a larger volume of the cerebrum.\nFigure 1\nillustrates the general MRSI quality with data taken from a single spectroscopic imaging slice from a single subject with brain injury.\nFigure 2\nillustrates that the MRSI method produces multiple slices allowing study of almost the entire brain.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nThis figure illustrates the general magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging quality with data taken from a single spectroscopic imaging slice from a single subject with brain injury. Thirty-two such slices are produced in each study. The circles illustrate the nominal in plane voxel size (2.5\u2009mm diameter) after spatial filtering and interpolation. Each row in the figure has the voxel position shifted two nominal voxel widths toward the subject's left (the images follow radiological convention). The leftmost column displays the T1-weighted (MPRAGE) image intensity aligned to the spectroscopic images of water, total choline (Cho), total creatine (Cre), total N-acetylaspartate (NAA). The rightmost column displays the voxel spectrum produced by the region identified by the circles. The voxel spectra illustrate the typical signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution. They also illustrate that in general for lipid signals produce no interference with the NAA signal within about 5\u2009mm from the head surface.

In addition, metabolite levels for the right and left hemisphere cerebellum, hippocampus, as well as the body, genu, and the splenium of the CC were also derived."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (200\u2013350\u2009g) were used in all experiments described. Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, in accordance with the guidelines provided by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nExperimental design and number of animals\nThe experimental time line is shown in\nFigure 1\n. Rats (\nn\n=\u200950) were randomized to receive blast or sham injury. Blast-injured rats were further randomized to receive NPLT or no therapy. All rats were tested for vestibulomotor function on post-injury days (PIDs) 1\u20133 (18 Sham, 15 Blast, 16 Blast+NPLT). A subset of rats (\nn\n=\u200922) were sacrificed on PID 3 (\nn\n=\u20094/group) and PID 7 (4 Sham, 3 Blast, 3 Blast+NPLT) for analysis of expression of genes involved in the regulation of cell survival after brain injury.\n25\nNeurons were laser-captured from the somatosensory cortex and the CA1-3 region of the hippocampus and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect messenger RNA (mRNA). Working memory was tested in the remaining rats (\nn\n=\u200928) on PIDs 6\u201310 (10 Sham, 9 Blast, 9 Blast+NPLT). These rats were euthanized on PID 10 for analysis of microglia activation (CD68 immunofluorescence;\nn\n=\u20093) and neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation in the hippocampus (bromodeoxyuridine [BrdU] immunoreactivity;\nn\n=\u20095). The rationale for looking at different days in the analysis is as follows:\nVestibulomotor function was analyzed on PIDs 1\u20133 because it is known to be affected early after injury and to spontaneously recover.\nWorking memory was tested on PIDs 6\u201310 to allow the rats to fully recover their motor function and be able to swim.\nThe rationale for studying brain injury-induced gene expression changes on PIDs 3 and 7 was to determine the potential therapeutic efficacy of NPLT to target early molecular events that occur in the first few days following BINT.\n25\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental design. Experimental rats were randomized to receive blast or sham injury. Blast-injured rats were further randomized to receive nano-pulsed laser therapy (NPLT) or no therapy. Vestibulomotor function (beam balance and beam walk) was assessed on post-injury days (PIDs) 1\u20133 and working memory function (Morris water maze [MWM]) was assessed on PIDs 6\u201310. On PIDs 3 (\nn\n=\u20094/group) and 7 (\nn\n=\u20093\u20134/group), brains were collected for laser-captured microdissection (LCM) of neurons from the cerebral cortex and hippocampus CA1-3 region and for immunofluoerescence analysis (IF) of active caspase-3 and NeuN expression. The expression of select genes in LCM neurons was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). On PID 8, 9, and 10 the rats were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for the analysis of cell proliferation. On PID 10, after completion of the MWM test, brains were collected for analysis of microglia activation (CD68 immunofluorescence) and cell proliferation in the hippocampus dentate gyrus (BrdU immunoreacticvity). IHC, immunohistochemistry.\n\nBlast injury\nRats were anesthetized with isoflurane and randomized to receive blast or sham injury. The custom-made Vandenberg device was used to produce blast injury, using nail-gun cartridges inserted into a detachable barrel.\n22\nTo prevent accidental activation, the device only fires when an operator simultaneously presses two switches, which requires both hands. A solenoid drives a metal bar to strike the firing pin against the cartridge. In this study we used Ramset/Remington nail-gun cartridges of 0.27 caliber with power level 4, which in our unpublished study induced mild-to-moderate brain injury in the animal model. Under these conditions, the Vandenberg blast device produces a combined blast over/underpressure that is followed by a blunt impact caused by the venting gas jet.\nThe dorsal surface of the head was shaved and the rat was moved onto a 5-cm thick foam pad to minimize tertiary blast injuries. Using high-speed video recordings, we had previously confirmed that the force of the blast presses the rat into the foam pad. To block both debris (e.g., unburned powder) and heat from reaching the animal, a 1.5-mm thick silicone rubber pad was placed on the head. Earplugs were inserted to protect the eardrums. The rat was positioned under the Vandenberg device, with the opening of the barrel 15\u2009mm above the protective pad and directly over the right hemisphere of the brain. Isoflurane was discontinued and paw pinches were tested repeatedly (once per second) until a withdrawal response was detected, at which point the blank cartidge was fired. For sham injury, the rats were positioned under the blast device but the blank cartridge was not fired. Immediately after the firing of the blank cartridge, rats were removed from the blast device, placed in supine position, and monitored until they recovered the righting reflex. The time to recover the righting reflex was recorded. Rats were then replaced on isoflurane anesthesia and randomized to received NPLT or no therapy. A schematic from the rat atlas indicating the location of the blast injury is shown in\nFigure 2\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nLocation of blast injury.\n(A)\nDorsal view of the rat skull showing the approximate location of blast injury.\n(B)\nCoronal view of the rat brain (modified from Paxinos, G., and Watson, C.\nThe Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates\n, 4th ed. Academic Press: San Diego, Fig. 36) showing the location of the blast at \u22124.18\u2009mm of bregma (corresponding to the center of the blast location in the coronal plane).\n(C)\nSagittal view of the rat brain at 1.90\u2009mm lateral, corresponding to the center of the blast in the sagittal plane. (Modified from Paxinos, G., and Watson, C.\nThe Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates\n, 4th ed. Academic Press: San Diego, Fig. 83.)\n\nNano-pulsed laser therapy\nRats were maintained under isoflurane anesthesia for 1\u2009h until time for the NPLT treatment. NPLT was delivered to the intact rat head through a 3-mm diameter specially developed fiber-optic bundle system positioned as close as possible to the blast location on the head and held in place using a stereotaxic holder. To accurately and consistently treat the area affected by the blast, a circle was drawn on the rat shaved head using a marker to indicate the area directly underneath the Vandenberg device piston. The proprietary, medical-grade, fiber-optic-coupled laser system consists of an optical parametric oscillator that generates short (10\u2009nsec) pulses of near-infrared light (808\u2009nm) at energy of up to 15\u2009mJ and pulse repetition rate of 20\u2009Hz. The pulse energy and spot size on the rat head were 5\u2009mJ and 3\u2009mm, respectively. These pulses generate low-level optoacoustic waves that travel deep into the brain. Rats were treated 1\u2009h after blast injury for a duration of 5\u2009min to provide a dose of 300\u2009J/cm\n2\n, which is similar to that used for the LLLT with continuous wave light.\n\nBrdU injections\nExperimental rats were injected intraperitoneally with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma Aldrich) at 75\u2009mg/kg daily on PIDs 8\u201310. On day 10, rats received two injections of BrdU, 2\u2009h apart. Rats were euthanized using isoflurane (4% in anesthetic chamber) followed by decapitation 2\u2009h after the last BrdU injection, and the brains were removed and frozen on dry ice.\n\nCognitive and motor function testing\nTo test the effect of NPLT on blast-induced vestibulomotor and cognitive deficits, rats were subjected to beam walk and beam balance tests on PIDs 1\u20133 and on the working memory paradigm of the Morris water maze (MWM) on PIDs 6\u201310 as previously described by Sell and colleagues.\n26\n\nVestibulomotor function\nBeam balance\nRats underwent one training session 24\u2009h before and one pre-assessment test on the day of the blast injury or sham procedure. The rats were trained to balance for 60\u2009sec on a short wooden beam (50\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009cm) raised 90\u2009cm off the floor. Once the rats were able to remain on the beam, they were evaluated for three consecutive trials per session and rated using a 6-point scale:\n1.\u2002Balances with steady posture (grooms, climbs barrier).\n2.\u2002Balances with unsteady posture (grasps sides of beam and/or has shaky movements).\n3.\u2002Hugs the beam or slips or spins on the beam.\n4.\u2002Attempts to balance, but falls off after 10\u2009sec.\n5.\u2002Drapes over or hangs from the beam, falls off in less than 10\u2009sec.\n6.\u2002Falls off, making no attempt to balance or hang onto the beam.\nBeam walk\nAnimals were trained to traverse a wooden beam (100\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u2009\u00d7\u20094.0\u2009cm) elevated 1\u2009m above the floor. Four steel pegs were spaced at equal distances along the top and a darkened goal box was positioned at the far end of the beam. Once trained, the rats were timed during three consecutive trials, with time to reach the goal box as the primary end-point. On the day of injury rats underwent a pre-injury assessment.\n\nCognitive function\nWorking memory test\nWe used the MWM to assess working memory, as described in detail by Sell and colleagues.\n26\nBriefly, the experimental animals were placed in a tank filled with water to a level that was 2\u2009cm higher than the hidden platform. Rats were assigned four starting points and four platform locations in a balanced order to avoid starting points too close to the platform. For Trial 1, rats were placed in the tank and allowed 120\u2009sec to find the platform. Once on the platform, the rats were allowed 15\u2009sec to rest and then were placed in the tank again from the same starting point to begin Trial 2. They were again allowed 120\u2009sec to find the platform. Rats were rested 4\u2009min in a heated enclosure before starting a second pair of trials, which used different platform and starting locations. Rats received four pairs of trials daily for 5 consecutive days. All rats received the same sequence of starting points and platform locations.\n\nLaser capture microdissection (LCM)\nOn PIDs 3 and 7, rats (4 Sham, 3 BINT, and 3 BINT+NPLT per time-point) were euthanized using isoflurane (4% in anesthetic chamber) followed by decapitation, brain dissection, rapid freezing on dry ice, and storage at \u221280\u00b0C. To prepare for cryo-sectioning, brains were frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) mounting medium, 10-\u03bcm coronal brain sections were cut through the hippocampus, between bregma level \u22123.16\u2009mm and \u22125.16\u2009mm, on a cryostat (Leica Microsystems CM1850), and mounted on superfrost clean glass slides (Superfrost Plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Marietta, OH). To ensure equal representation of sections relative to bregma level, every third section (for a total of 50 sections per brain) was stained with 0.001% Fluoro-Jade C (FJC; Histo-Chem, Inc., Jefferson, AR), a marker for neuronal injury, and counterstained with 1% cresyl violet (a Nissl stain), as previosuly described.\n27\nAll solutions were prepared with RNase-free water, and the cresyl violet and the FJC were sterile filtered immediately before use.\nLCM was performed using a PixCell IIe laser capture microscope with an infrared diode laser (Arcturus Engineering, presently Arcturus/ LifeTechnologies/Thermo-Scientific, Carlsbad, CA). The smallest laser spot size (7.5\u2009\u03bcm) was used with a power setting of 75\u2013100\u2009mW and a pulse duration of 0.35\u20130.75\u2009msec (settings were adjusted, as necessary, for optimum capture of the cells). Uninjured (FJC-negative) neurons from the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus CA1-3 region were captured on a thermoplastic film of separate CapSure Macro LCM caps (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA). Equal sampling was ensured by harvesting FJC-negative cells that were adjacent or in close proximity to FJC-positive cells. In the hippocampus we sampled throughout the CA1-3 region. In the cortex, we sampled throughout the somatosensory cortex. The same number of cells was collected from the selected regions for each experimental animal (600 cells/region/brain). They were placed into a 0.5-mL tube containing 100\u2009\u03bcL of Lysis buffer (Ambion/Thermo-Scientific), vortexed, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until isolation of total RNA.\n\nRNA isolation, reverse transcription, and quantitative real-time PCR\nTotal RNA was isolated using the RNA Aqueous Micro kit (Ambion/Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol before DNase treatment at 37\u00b0C for 20\u2009min to remove any traces of genomic DNA. The concentration and quality of total RNA was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer with the RNA6000 Pico Lab Chip (Agilent Technologies). Afterward, 1\u2009ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems/Thermo-Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Taqman PreAmp Master Mix Kit (Applied Biosystems/Thermo-Scientific) was used to pre-amplify cDNA to increase the quantity of specific cDNA targets:\nBdnf, Stat3, Casp3, Bcl2, Bax, Gapdh\n. The cDNA was pre-amplified for 14 cycles with a thermal profile of 1 cycle at 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009min and 14 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009sec/60\u00b0C for 4\u2009min. Pre-amplification products were diluted 1:20 with 1X TE buffer before proceeding to quantitative PCR. qRT-PCR was performed on an MX3000P instrument (Agilent Technologies) with Taqman chemistry probes (Applied Biosystems/Thermo-Scientific) with the following thermal profile: 50\u00b0C for 2\u2009min (1 cycle), 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009min (1 cycle), 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009sec/60\u00b0C for 1\u2009min (45 cycles). Each PCR reaction was performed in triplicate. Normalization to GAPDH, a housekeeping gene, was performed by calculating the \u0394Ct for each gene of interest (GOI). This calculation involves subtracting the Ct value of the GOI from the Ct value of GAPDH. All data from the PCR were collected and analyzed by the MXPro software (provided by Stratagene with purchase of Mx3000 Multiplex Quantitative PCR System) and \u0394\u0394Ct fold changes were calculated, graphed, and plotted in Excel.\n\nTissue processing and immunofluorescence analysis\nAt 3, 7, or 10 days after BINT or sham injury, rats were euthanized using isoflurane (4% in anesthetic chamber) followed by decapitation, and brains were dissected, rapidly frozen on dry ice, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. To prepare for cryo-sectioning, tissues were frozen in OCT mounting medium and coronal brain sections (collected in groups of 10 serial sections) were cut through the entire hippocampus, between bregma level \u22123.16\u2009mm and \u22125.16\u2009mm, on a cryostat (Leica Microsystems CM1850) and mounted on superfrost clean glass slides (Superfrost Plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific). To ensure equal representation of sections relative to bregma level, every 10th section, for a total of 10 sections per brain, was selected for immunofluorescence analysis.\nAnalysis of microglia activation\nCoronal brain sections (14\u2009\u03bcm) were fixed in ice-cold 10% buffered formalin and incubated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30\u2009min at room temperature. The sections were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 1.5% normal goat serum overnight at 4\u00b0C. They were then incubated with secondary antibodies (594-Alexa-conjugated, Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA; 1:400 dilution in PBS with 1.5% normal goat serum) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. After washing in PBS, the sections were rinsed in tap water and coverslipped with mounting media containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).\nAnalysis of active caspase-3\nThe same rat brains used for LCM on PIDs 3 and 7 were used for immunofluorescence analysis of active caspase-3. Coronal brain sections (10\u2009\u03bcm) were fixed in ice-cold 10% buffered formalin and incubated in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30\u2009min at room temperature. The sections were incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3, 1:200; R&D; and mouse anti-NeuN, 1:100; Millipore) diluted in PBS containing 1.5% normal goat serum overnight at 4\u00b0C. They were then incubated with secondary antibodies (594- and 488-Alexa-conjugated, Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA; 1:400 dilution in PBS with 1.5% normal goat serum) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. After washing in PBS, the sections were rinsed in tap water and coverslipped with mounting media containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).\nAnalysis of cell proliferation\nFor BrdU detection, after fixation in ice-cold 10% formalin for 30\u2009min, the sections were washed in 0.1\u2009M PBS (pH 7.4), incubated in 1N HCl solution for 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C and then washed in 0.1\u2009M borate buffer (pH 8.5). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation in 1.5% hydrogen peroxide in dH\n2\nO for 30\u2009min. The sections were blocked and permeabilized in 5% normal goat serum and 0.3% triton X-100 in PBS for 30\u2009min. This step was followed by incubation with the primary antibody (ms anti-BrdU; 1:100 DAKO) in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C. The following day, after washing in PBS, sections were incubated with secondary antibody (biotinylated goat anti-mouse, ABC Mouse Kit, Vector Laboratories) before incubation with an avidin-biotin complex (ABC Kit, Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Staining was visualized by incubating the sections with DAB substrate for 10\u2009min. After washing for 5\u2009min in tap water, a light counterstain using Hematoxylin QS (Vector Laboratories) was performed. Sections were dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions of increasing concentrations, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped with Permount (Sigma). For double immunofluorescence for BrdU and cell-specific markers (NeuN to label neurons and GFAP to label astrocytes) sections were fixed in ice-cold 10% buffered formalin, incubated in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30\u2009min at room temperature, incubated in 1N HCl solution for 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, and then washed in 0.1\u2009M borate buffer (pH 8.5). The sections were incubated with primary antibodies (ms anti-BrdU; 1:100 DAKO + rabbit anti-NeuN; 1:100 Millipore, or ms anti-BrdU; 1:100 DAKO + rabbit anti-GFAP; 1:1000 DAKO) diluted in PBS containing 1.5% normal goat serum overnight at 4\u00b0C. They were then incubated with secondary antibodies (594- and 488-Alexa-conjugated, Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA; 1:400 dilution in PBS with 1.5% normal goat serum) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. After washing in PBS, the sections were rinsed in tap water and coverslipped with mounting media containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories).\nImages were taken with an Olympus BX51 microsope equipped with a cooled CCD camera.\n\nQuantification of immunohistochemical staining\nTwo independent investigators, who were blinded to the experimental groups, quantified immunopositive cells in every 10th section of a series of coronal brain sections from \u22123.15\u2009mm to \u22125.16\u2009mm of bregma for a total of 10\u201315 sections per brain. For active caspase-3 quantification, double immunofluorescence was used to co-localize active caspase-3 and NeuN in the same sections. Only cells displaying an intact nucleus positive for NeuN that were also positive for active caspase-3 were counted. Active Casapse3\npos\n/NeuN\npos\ncells and CD68\npos\ncells in each section were viewed using ImageJ software and the total number of cells in the region of interest was obtained. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were as follows: For active caspase-3, only cells with a nucleus positive for NeuN were counted; for CD68, only cells with an intact nucleus (identified by DAPI) and positive for CD68 were counted. The mean of the two investigators' counts was calculated to get a total mean count for each brain. Values from each animal (three per group) were averaged to calculate the mean number for the group.\nTo quantify proliferating cells in the hippocampus dentate gyrus, a total of 15 sections per brain at the level of the dentate gyrus from \u22123.16\u2009mm to \u22125.16\u2009mm of bregma were examined by two independent investigators who were blinded to the experimental groups. Specifically, the subgranular zone (SGZ, defined as a two cell-body thick layer between the hilus and granule layer) was outlined and individual BrdU\npos\ncells with stained nuclei were counted in the outlined area. The reported number of BrdU\npos\ncells in the\nresults\nsection represents the average number of cells for all counted sections. The mean of the two investigators' counts was calculated to get a total mean count for each brain. Mean values were then calculated for each group (five per group).\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed with the aid of a proprietary software (GraphPad Prism 7). For beam walk and beam balance tests, differences between groups were determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Fisher's test. For gene expression analysis and quantitative analysis of immunohistochemistry, group differences in the mean values were evaluated by ANOVA and post hoc Tukey's multiple comparisons test. Values are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). Differences were considered significant when\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Participants and procedures\nParticipants were 79 veterans with a history of TBI (\nn\n=\u200969 mild,\nn\n=\u200910 moderate) and 54\u2009MCs without a history of TBI who were predominantly involved in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts (i.e., Operation Enduring Freedom [OEF], Operation Iraqi Freedom [OIF], and Operation New Dawn [OND]). Veterans were recruited from the VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS) through outpatient clinics (e.g., a TBI specialty clinic), recruitment flyers posted within the VASDHS, and word of mouth. Participants were administered several questionnaires, which included completion of self-report measures of psychiatric distress, as well as select modules of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.; i.e., Major Depressive Episode and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder [PTSD]). The present study was reviewed and approved by local institutional review boards, and informed consent was obtained from all participants before research participation.\nAn initial screening interview was conducted to determine participant eligibility. TBI history was assessed using a clinical interview adapted from the VA Semi-Structured Clinical Interview for TBI.\n51\nThe interview was comprised of questions pertaining to the nature of previously sustained TBIs. Specifically, the following information was gathered for each TBI reported: injury-severity characteristics (presence and duration of loss of consciousness [LOC], post-traumatic amnesia [PTA], and alteration of consciousness [AOC]), the context under which the TBI was sustained (military vs. nonmilitary event), the mechanism of injury (blast-related vs. blunt/mechanical force), and when the TBI occurred. This information was used to determine the \u201cworst\u201d or \u201cmost significant\u201d TBI ever experienced by each service member, which was, in turn, used to classify injury severity for the present study. Additionally, the interview was used to determine the total number of lifetime TBIs sustained by each participant (a TBI was counted if it met criteria as defined below).\nTo determine whether veterans met criteria for having sustained a TBI, the VA/DoD (Department of Defense) Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Concussion/Mild TBI\n52\ndefinition was applied; these guidelines indicate that in order for an event to be classified as a TBI, the individual must have experienced at least one of the following: 1) LOC, 2) AOC, 3) PTA, 4) neurological deficits (such as weakness, loss of balance, etc.), and 5) intracranial lesion.\n52\nFor the purpose of this study, information pertaining to neurological deficits and intracranial lesions was not available for all participants; thus, classification of TBI was based on participant self-reported duration of LOC, AOC, and PTA. A\nmild\nTBI was defined as experiencing LOC <30\u2009min, AOC up to 24\u2009h, and/or PTA <24\u2009h; a\nmoderate\nTBI was defined as experiencing LOC >30\u2009min and <24\u2009h, AOC >24\u2009h, and/or PTA >24\u2009h but <7 days.\n52\nThe interviews were conducted face to face by either post-baccalaureate research assistants or graduate students under the supervision of a neuropsychologist. If participants did not report a history of TBI (as defined above), these veterans were classified as MC participants.\nExclusion criteria for the TBI group included the following: 1) history of severe TBI (defined as LOC \u226524\u2009h, AOC >24\u2009h, and/or PTA \u22657 days); 2) having the \u201cworst\u201d or \u201cmost significant\u201d TBI occur before the age of 18; 3) history of a neurological disorder or serious medical illness (e.g., epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke, myocardial infarction, etc.); 4) history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or another psychotic disorder as per\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\u2014Fourth Edition, Text Revision\n(DSM-IV-TR) criteria\n53\n; 5) current (within the past 30 days) substance/alcohol abuse or dependence as per DSM-IV-TR criteria; 6) a positive toxicology screen (measured by the Rapid Response 10-drug Test Panel); and 7) suboptimal effort as determined by the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM)\n54\nor\nthe California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II)\n55\nForced Choice Recognition subset. Exclusion criteria for the MC group included the following: 1) history of TBI (regardless of severity level) and 2) meeting criteria 3\u20137 as defined above for the TBI sample. Inclusion criteria for both the TBI and MC groups required that veterans provide a DNA sample that was successfully analyzed for their APOE genotype.\n\nLaboratory procedures\nParticipants' DNA was collected by buccal sample; specifically, participants swabbed the inside of their cheek to obtain a saliva sample that could be used for APOE genotyping. The APOE genotype for each participant was determined by using two Taqman\n\u00ae\nsingle-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assays for the SNPs, APOE112 (rs429358) and APOE158 (rs7412). Participants were genotyped using a method based on polymerase chain reaction identical to that of Saunders and colleagues.\n56\nAPOE genotyping results for the overall sample were as follows: \u03b52/\u03b52 (\nn\n=\u20090; 0%), \u03b52/\u03b53 (\nn\n=\u200912; 9.0%), \u03b52/\u03b54 (\nn\n=\u20094; 3.0%), \u03b53/\u03b53 (\nn\n=\u200988; 66.2%), \u03b53/\u03b54 (\nn\n=\u200926; 19.5%), and \u03b54/\u03b54 (\nn\n=\u20093; 2.3%). Based on these observed frequencies, participants were divided into two groups\u2014veterans with one or two copies of the \u03b54 allele were classified as \u201c\u03b54 present\u201d (\u03b54\n+\n) and veterans with no copies of the \u03b54 allele were classified as \u201c\u03b54 absent\u201d (\u03b54\n\u2013\n). Veterans were not informed of their APOE genotype.\n\nPrimary outcome measures\nBeck Depression Inventory-II\nThe Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)\n57\nis a 21-item self-report measure assessing depressive symptomatology. Each item on the BDI-II is comprised of four statements related to a particular symptom of depression. Participants are instructed to select the statement in each item that best describes how they have been feeling over the past 2 weeks. The statements correspond to values ranging from 0 to 3, with higher values representing more-severe depressive symptomatology. A total score was calculated by adding together the ratings for the 21 items (possible range, 0\u201363). The psychometric properties of the BDI-II are well established.\n57\n,\n58\nBeck Anxiety Inventory\nThe Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)\n59\nis a 21-item self-report measure assessing generalized anxiety. Each item corresponds to a common symptom of anxiety and participants are asked to rate the extent to which they were bothered by each symptom during the past week using a 4-point rating scale ranging from 0 (\u201cNot at all\u201d) to 3 (\u201cSeverely\u2014I could barely stand it\u201d). Higher scores represent more-severe anxiety. A total score was calculated by aggregating the individual responses from each item (possible range, 0\u201363). Similar to the BDI-II, the BAI has sound psychometric properties.\n59\u201362\nPTSD Checklist \u2013 Military Version\nThe PTSD Checklist \u2013 Military Version (PCL-M)\n63\nis a 17-item self-report measure designed to assess DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Each item on the PCL-M corresponds to a DSM symptom of PTSD, and participants are asked to rate the extent to which they have been bothered by each symptom over the past month using a 1\u20135 scale, with 1 indicating \u201cNot at all\u201d and 5 indicating \u201cExtremely.\u201d Higher scores represent more-severe PTSD symptomatology. A total score was calculated by summing the selected values from each item (possible range, 17\u201385). The psychometric properties of the PCL-M have also been well established.\n64\u201367\nParticipants were also administered a measure of pre-morbid intellectual functioning\u2014the Reading subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test 4,\n68\nas well as measures of effort, including the TOMM\n54\nand the CVLT-II Forced Choice Recognition subtest.\n55\nAs noted above, participants who demonstrated performances below clinical cut-offs on one or both of these tasks were removed from the analyses.\n\nStatistical analyses\nDescriptive statistics were run on the overall sample, and TBI and MC participants were compared to determine whether there were any differences between groups with regard to basic demographic characteristics. Independent-samples\nt\n-tests were used to evaluate continuous data, and chi-square analyses were used to evaluate categorical data. Within the TBI sample, participants were divided into mild and moderate TBI groups and were compared across demographic and injury severity characteristics. TBI participants were also divided into groups based on the presence or absence of an \u03b54 allele (\u03b54\n+\nvs. \u03b54\n\u2013\n), and allele groups were compared across the same demographic and injury severity characteristics. Two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted in order to examine the effect of group (TBI vs. MC) and \u03b54 status (\u03b54\n+\nvs. \u03b54\n\u2013\n) across self-report measures of psychiatric distress. Two-way ANOVAs were also conducted to determine whether results would differ after removal of moderate TBI participants from the analyses. All analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS; version 24; SPSS IBM, New York, NY)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants were all consented and enrolled in the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) funded TBIMS NDB, a collaborative, multi-center clinical research effort in the United States initiated in 1987.\n12\nAll 16 currently enrolling plus one formerly enrolling centers had institutional review board approval. TBIMS eligibility criteria were: 1) sustained TBI with at least one of the following characteristics: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score <13 on emergency admission (not attributed to intubation, sedation, or intoxication), loss of consciousness >30\u2009min (not attributed to sedation or intoxication), post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) >24\u2009h, or trauma-related intracranial abnormality on neuroimaging; 2) 16 years or older; 3) presented to a designated TBIMS acute care hospital within 72\u2009h of injury; and 4) received acute rehabilitation care within the TBIMS.\nExclusion criteria for our analyses included injury dates before January 1997 because outcome predictors differ in the earlier years of the TBIMS,\n13\nand penetrating TBI as previously operationally defined,\n14\nbecause of its rarity and unique outcome patterns.\n14\nIndividuals were excluded from a given analysis year, and future years, if they had not reached that time point post-injury or if they had withdrawn. Those whose GOS score was otherwise unavailable at an outcome time point were removed from that year's analysis. Given the rehabilitation setting for enrollment, focus on functional outcomes, and rarity of these outcomes, individuals were also excluded from a given analysis year if they had died beforehand and were removed from that year's analysis if vegetative. To maximize sample sizes and minimize sampling bias, individuals may have been included in one cross-sectional analysis but not in other year(s).\nFigure 1\ndisplays the participant flow into the final analysis data sets. Exclusions are labeled as \u201cexcluded\u201d versus \u201cremoved\u201d depending on viability of collecting future GOS. The excluded categories were death, withdrew consent, or insufficient time elapsed post-injury (i.e., premature). The removed categories were vegetative state, refused, incarcerated, enrollment site lost funding, lost (unable to contact), missing predictor (test data set only), or incomplete (assessment conducted but missing GOS). Almost all incomplete classifications were from the optional use of the mail-in version of the TBIMS follow-up assessment, which lacks the GOS interview. The final data sets for the 1-, 2-, and 5-year GOS had 10,125, 8821, and 6165 participants, respectively.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nParticipant flow diagram showing samples for the 1-, 2-, and 5-year post-injury models.\na\nSubjects excluded from the test-set only because of missing values for days in PTA, discharged in PTA, occupational group/employment, education level, or productivity.GOS, Glasgow Outcome Scale; LOS, length of stay; PTA, post-traumatic amnesia.\n\nOutcomes\nThe GOS,\n15\na 5-point ordinal scale, is long considered the gold-standard measure of global outcome after TBI.\n5\nIt has broad applicability and clear, concise, and functionally meaningful categories.\n15\n,\n16\nThe GOSE is administered in the TBIMS NDB and was designed to increase responsiveness of the GOS for research applications and bifurcates the three functional GOS categories, severe disability (SD), moderate disability (MD), and good recovery (GR). We collapsed the GOSE into the original GOS to enhance comparisons with past research and provide distinct and more understandable categorizations for clinicians, patients, and families (see\nTable 1\nfor descriptors).\nTable\n1.\nDescription of Glasgow Outcome Scale Levels\nGlasgow Coma Scale level\nBrief description\nDead\nN/A\nVegetative state\nCondition of unawareness with only reflex responses but with periods of spontaneous eye opening\nSevere disability\nDependent for daily support for mental and/or physical disability\nModerate disability\nSome disability but able to look after themselves; independent at home but dependent outside\nGood recovery\nResumption of normal life with the capacity to work even if pre-injury status has not been achieved; may have minor neurological or psychological deficits\nOpen in a separate window\nN/A, not applicable.\n\nPredictors\nTo avoid the potential for an overly cumbersome tool, we parsimoniously selected independent variables that had demonstrated predictive value in past research and were readily accessible to clinicians. Patient demographic variables included age at injury, sex, and education level (less than high school, high school/GED [General Educational Development], or more than high school).\n17\n,\n18\nRace was not included because findings on its additive predictive value beyond other socioeconomic factors have been mixed,\n19\n,\n20\nand because the increasing diversity of racial identification would impede clinical classification of many persons.\nPre-injury health and socioeconomic characteristics included were past TBI from the OSU TBI-ID interview (binary present/absent and number of TBIs),\n21\n,\n22\nproductivity (yes/no with yes identified as competitive employment, full-time student, or running a household), occupational category (professional, skilled, manual, or unemployed),\n23\nand problem alcohol and illicit drug use history (both yes/no). Problem alcohol use was measured on the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System Questionnaire from October 1999 to present,\n24\nand preceding this date was extrapolated from the Quantity-Frequency-Variability Index.\n25\nClinical measures of brain injury severity included were initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) motor score\n26\nand post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) duration,\n13\nmeasured continuously. A binary PTA variable also indicated status at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation (yes/no still in PTA), with total length of stay (LOS) from injury through inpatient rehabilitation serving as the continuous measure of PTA if yes; this permitted maximum inclusiveness and avoided nonvalidated PTA duration imputations. TBI complications included were elevated intracranial pressure (ICP; none, <24\u2009h, >24\u2009h, >24\u2009h, and sustained, not monitored), whether a craniectomy or craniotomy was performed, and computerized tomography (CT) evidence of focal intracranial injury defined as subdural or epidural hematoma, or intraparenchymal hemorrhage classified as contusion (as opposed to petechial hemorrhage consistent with diffuse axonal injury). Finally, acute care hospital LOS was included as an easily retrievable surrogate marker for associated injury or other comorbidities.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor each follow-up period, the data were randomly split with 85% placed into a training set and 15% placed into a test set. We used the training sets to build the predictive models and the test sets to assess the generalizability of each one.\nPredictive models were built using classification tree methodology, which are intuitive predictors based on branching logic that can provide flexible predictive qualities. Within this paradigm, a\nnode\nis defined as a group of homogenous participants and a\nterminal node\nis a group of homogenous participants that do not split into subgroups. The algorithm searches for splits to maximize the difference in the outcome, thus all variables captured in the classification tree are considered related to the outcome. Variables appearing higher in the tree are more strongly related to the outcome than variables appearing distally. Predictions can be made using outcome distributions in each node.\nA tree was created using the Classification Rule with Unbiased Interaction Selection and Estimation (CRUISE) algorithm separately at each follow-up time point.\n27\nThis algorithm allows for splits in two or more directions and accommodates continuous and categorical predictors. Within this algorithm, we used the following options: univariate splits, two-dimensional method, splitting by discriminant analysis, equal priors and equal costs of misclassification, a standard error limit of 0.5 for pruning, and node-wise imputation and fit. To achieve a parsimonious model, nodes containing under 200 observations were not permitted to split.\nTwo approaches were considered for model building: step-wise restriction of primary branching to PTA duration versus entering all predictor candidates simultaneously. We opted for the less-restrained modeling because PTA duration was consistently the primary branching in test runs. We also incorporated \u201cmanual pruning,\u201d the removal of nodes with questionable value along with subsequent nodes, under unanimous consent of a nationally known expert panel.\nAfter the tree was created using the CRUISE algorithm, the percentage of observations in each terminal node were calculated and used to calculate an\nM\nstatistic and\nc\n-index to measure the predictability of each tree.\n28\nThis statistic is calculated by averaging the c-statistics from each of the ordinal comparisons and ranges from 0.5 (random predictability) to 1.0 (perfect prediction). Confidence intervals (CIs) for the\nc\n-index were computed using a nonparametric bootstrap based on 500 bootstrap samples. The predictability of each classification tree was then assessed within the independent test set."

    "Methods": "Cervical contusion SCI\nAll procedures were approved by the Thomas Jefferson University IACUC. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 275\u2013300\u2009g were anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine (100\u2009mg/kg), xylazine (5\u2009mg/kg), and acepromazine (2\u2009mg/kg). The skin and underlying muscle layers between the base of the skull and the top of the shoulder blades were incised and the cervical spinal column was exposed. Spinal cord was exposed by right-side unilateral laminectomy above spinal cord level C4. Unilateral C4 contusion was induced with the Infinite Horizon impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Lexington, KY) using a 1.5-mm tip at an impact force of 395 kdyn.\n32\n,\n33\nThe same surgical procedure, except for the administration of the contusion injury, was performed on laminectomy-only control animals. Following the completion of the injury procedure, the muscle and skin incisions were closed with sterile 4\u20130 silk suture and sterile wound clip, respectively. Animals were injected with lactated Ringers solution and 0.1\u2009mg/kg of buprenorphine (buprenorphine HCl). Daily post-operative monitoring continued until sacrifice.\n\nControlled cortical impact (CCI)\nWhile heavily anesthetized with isoflurane (3% induction and 2\u20132.5% maintenance), male Sprague-Dawley rats received a CCI injury using an electromagnetic impactor device (Leica Biosystems Inc.) at pre-determined parameters described previously by our laboratory.\n34\n,\n35\nBriefly, CCI was induced on the right side at 1\u2009mm to the right of the sagittal suture and 1\u2009mm posterior of bregma (at a depth of 1\u2009mm; impact velocity of 3\u2009m/sec; 100\u2009msec dwell time) using a 5-mm impactor tip. Craniotomy-only controls underwent all procedures (including the same exposure to isoflurane), with the exception of the impact injury.\n\nBromodeoxyuridine injections\nFor both SCI and TBI, rats were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) solution (Fisher Scientific; 100\u2009mg/kg body weight) prepared in sterile saline. Intraperitoneal injections were performed in a pulse-chase manner twice per day, starting 2 days prior to cervical contusion (or laminectomy-only) or cortical impact (or craniotomy-only) and continuing until 3 days post-injury (or laminectomy/craniotomy) for a total of 6 days of injections. The injections were given approximately 12\u2009h apart on a particular day to space out the timing of BrdU pulsing. The animals were then sacrificed at 4 days post-injury, a time-point based in part on our previous data combined with findings for novel stem cell niches in a stroke model.\n23\nFollow-up experiments were performed at 28 days post-injury or laminectomy only in the SCI model.\n\nTissue processing for histology\nAt 4 or 28 days post-surgery, animals were transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were harvested and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C for 24\u201336\u2009h, washed with 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose at 4\u00b0C for 3 days. Tissue was then embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) freezing medium (Tissue-Tek, Sakura, Japan) and flash-frozen. Coronal brain sections were cut at 30\u2009\u03bcm for SCI and 20\u2009\u03bcm for TBI tissues on a cryostat and collected onto glass slides. Slides were then stored at \u221220\u00b0C.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nSlides were thawed on a heating block at 37\u00b0C for 1\u2009h and rehydrated with 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (1x PBS). Following an antigen-retrieval step, slides were incubated in blocking buffer containing 0.1% Triton X100 and 5% normal donkey serum (NDS) in 1x PBS (pH 7.4). Slides were then incubated in primary antibodies for 48\u2009h at 4\u00b0C, washed, and incubated in secondary antibodies for 2\u2009h at room temperature in blocking buffer. Images were acquired with a Zeiss Imager M2 upright fluorescence microscope. High-resolution confocal images were obtained using a FluoView FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA) for SCI tissues or using a Leica TCS SP8w with a Leica Hybrid Detector for TBI tissues. For BrdU immunostaining, sections were incubated in 2N HCl for 20\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. Sections were then washed with 1x PBS, followed by incubation for 10\u2009min at room temperature in 0.1\u2009M borate buffer (pH 8.5). Sections were then washed with PBS and processed for immunohistochemistry as described above.\n\nAntibodies and reagents\nThe following primary antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry: mouse anti-GFAP (Millipore, 1:300), mouse anti-nestin (Millipore, 1:200), rabbit anti-doublecortin (Cell Signaling, 1:390), mouse anti-Sox2 (R&D Systems, 1:1000), rat monoclonal anti-BrdU (Accurate Chemical, 1:200), rabbit anti-Olig2 (Millipore, 1:500), and rabbit anti-Iba-1 (WAKO, 1:600). All secondary antibodies were AlexaFluor-conjugated from Invitrogen and included donkey anti-rabbit 647, donkey anti-mouse 594, and donkey anti-rat 488.\n\nQuantitative analysis\nAll BrdU-positive nuclei in each CVO region (i.e., SFO, ME, AP) were counted using unbiased stereological methods by an observer blinded to experimental conditions,\n36\nusing methods modified from those previously described by our laboratory.\n37\n,\n38\nA blinded observer counted cells with a visible BrdU-labeled nucleus. Eight to 20 sections per CVO or SVZ region for the BrdU-labeled sections were counted; cell counts for the ME were restricted to sections randomly selected from \u22122.56 to \u22122.80\u2009mm posterior to bregma. Three to four sections per animal were counted for double-labeling of BrdU with Sox2, DCX, GFAP, Olig2, and Iba1. Cell counts for all sections were averaged and reported as the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM).\n\nNeurosphere assay\nSVZ from embryonic rat brain (E15.5) was dissected out and dissociated into single cells with Papain (Roche, 1\u2009mg/mL) and DNaseI (Roche, 1\u2009mg/mL). Primary neurosphere cultures were cultured in NEP basal medium with 0.36 units/mL heparin sodium plus 20\u2009ng/mL bFGF and 20\u2009ng/mL EGF (PeproTech), as described previously.\n39\n,\n40\nPlasma was obtained from anti-coagulated cardiac blood samples from TBI, SCI, and control group rats before perfusion on day 4. Plasma was aliquoted and snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen for later use. After the formation of primary neurospheres, spheres were dissociated by Accutase (Sigma) and total cell numbers were counted using a Countess Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen). On 24-well plates, 10,000 cells were seeded per well for the secondary neurosphere assay.\n41\nFor secondary neurosphere assays, cultures were incubated in NEP basal medium with heparin and grown under the following experimental conditions: control groups: low EGF and bFGF (1\u2009ng/mL) plus 0.5% normal plasma; experimental groups: low EGF and bFGF (1\u2009ng/mL) plus 0.5% plasma from TBI or SCI animals. For quantification of the secondary neurospheres, images were taken and total spheres were counted from each well after 7 days when secondary neurospheres formed. After quantification, spheres from each group were dissociated and total cell numbers were obtained immediately following dissociation, and 10,000 cells/well were seeded onto 24-well plates for the tertiary neurosphere assay. Similar to the secondary neurosphere assay, the tertiary neurosphere assay cultures were treated with plasma from experimental (TBI or SCI) or control groups and quantified as described above. The plasma used in our study was collected by two authors (one using the CCI model and one using the SCI model) following the exact same published protocol. All batches of neurospheres, their treatment with plasma and growth factors, as well as all cell counting and data analysis, were performed for all experiments by two independent investigators.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. The statistical significance of the mean was calculated by Student's\nt\ntest to compare injured and control groups by regions of interest at matched end-points. Statistics were computed with GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). A\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered to be significant: *\np\n<\u20090.05, **\np\n<\u20090.01, ***\np\n<\u20090.001."

    "Methods": "Design and participants\nThe study was a prospective cohort study conducted in the Eastern Norway, Oslo University Hospital. The hospital provides healthcare services for approximately one half of the Norwegian population (2.8 million residents). Patients with moderate-to-severe TBIs who were consecutively admitted to Oslo University Hospital were screened between 2005 and 2007 for study eligibility. Details of the original design were described elsewhere.\n13\nBriefly, the study inclusion criteria were 1) age between 16 and 55 years, 2) residents of the east region of Norway, 3) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)\n24\n3\u201312, and 4) admitted with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnoses S06.0\u2013S06.9 within 24\u2009h of injury. Although 160 patients met the inclusion criteria, 27 were excluded because of serious pre-injury comorbidities (e.g., neurological disorders or injuries, severe psychiatric disorders), coexisting conditions (e.g., spinal cord injuries), and substance abuse disorder. This study further excluded 12 subjects who later withdrew or were lost to follow-up; therefore, 121 participants were included in the present study.\n\nProcess\nAll study participants provided a written informed consent at the study entry. For those who were unable to consent initially, the consents were first obtained from a close relative or legal guardian and then from the participant, when possible. If the participants were <18 years of age, their parents' consents were obtained. Baseline data on patient demographics, injury characteristics, and medical history were documented at the study admission. From the original study, 88 study participants had valid measures of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) measurements and the measures were dichotomous at the mean value (i.e., 0\u20133 vs. >3 weeks). All patients had an acute computed tomography (CT) head scan followed by a second control scan between 6 and 12\u2009h post-injury. All CT scans were assessed and categorized by the same neuroradiologist according to the Marshall CT classification,\n25\nand the \u201cworst\u201d scan result was used for classification. Length of in-hospital stays (LOS) in days were recorded as LOS in the intensive care unit (ICU), total LOS in the trauma center, and rehabilitation unites. All patients received neurosurgical and/or ICU care in the acute setting whereas 60% of patients received post-acute brain injury rehabilitation services in order to optimize recovery, increase functional independence in personal and domestic activities of daily life, restore social participation, and minimize the distress of the patient as well as of the caregivers.\n26\nPatients' functional status was followed and assessed at 3 months and 1 and 5 years post-injury at the outpatient department. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee for Medical Research in the East of Norway and the Norwegian Data Inspectorate.\n\nOutcome measurement\nFor this study, the outcome of interest was the patients' functional status up to 5 years post-injury, which was measured through the FIM instrument\n27\nand by the FIM-certified raters. The instrument is a well-established and widely used tool for measuring the degree of a patient's disability and grade of assistance required to carry out activities of daily living (ADL). It includes 18 items, and each item is scored on a 7-point ordinal scale, where 1 indicates complete dependence and 7 indicates complete independence in ADL. The instrument can also be grouped into two subscales: FIM motor tasks (FIM-M) and FIM cognitive tasks (FIM-C). The FIM-M and FIM-C subscales include 13 items and five items, and the sum of each scale will be a value between 13 and 91 (FIM-M) or between 5 and 35 (FIM-C).\n\nStatistical analysis\nTwo sets of analyses were carried out to classify the patient subgroups based on their functional trajectories during the first 5 years post-TBI and to characterize these subgroups. In the first set, GBTM was used through the SAS Proc Traj procedure\n28\n,\n29\nto identify the patient subgroups who shared the same functional profiles (i.e., measures of FIM-M and FIM-C subscales) over time. Subjects with missing outcome data were included in the analysis, but only available data for each subject were used. Models with different trajectory shapes and a varying number of classes were compared to find the model that best fit the data. Polynomial orders, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), logged Bayes factor (2\u0394BIC),, and substantive knowledge were used to determine the shapes and groups of the trajectories over the 5-year period.\nIn the Proc Traj procedure, the maximum polynomial order is a quadratic form, thus the model-building process began with a model consisting of one group with a quadratic degree polynomial and then increasing the group numbers until the number of groups that best fit the data was identified based on the model selection criteria. For the model-building process, BIC was used to assess the improvement in model fit gained by adding more parameters (e.g., more groups or more complexed trajectory shapes), but also penalizing models with more parameters. When two models were compared, the larger BIC value would be chosen. If the fit of two models was the same, the simpler model would be chosen.\n30\nFurther, 2\u0394BIC was used to select a meaningful model improvement in the process. The 2\u0394BIC, or an approximation of the logged Bayes factor, could be interpreted as the degree of evidence favoring the more complex model.\n30\n,\n31\nWhen two models were compared, a difference of 10 in 2\u0394BIC would be considered as a meaningful difference.\n32\nIn the second set of analyses to characterize the trajectory memberships, chi-square test or analysis of variance was used to compare the differences in demographic and injury characteristics measured at baseline and the FIM-M and FIM-C scores at 3 months and 1 and 5 years post-injury. Bonferroni's correction was applied to counteract type 1 errors attributed to multiple comparisons. For this analysis, subjects with missing outcome data were included in the analysis, but no imputation was done and only available data for each subject were used. The analyses for comparing membership trajectories were performed using SAS software (version 9.4; copyright [c] 2002\u20132012 by SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAnimal procedures were approved by the University of Miami's Institution of Animal Care and Use Committee and adhered to the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments guidelines and those established by the National Institute of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (280\u2013350\u2009g) age 3\u20135 months were used for all experiments. Male rats were used because males are at higher risk of TBI than females, with the highest male-to-female ratio occurring in adolescence and young adulthood.\n43\nRats were randomly assigned to each experimental group (sham and PBBI 4\u2009h, 24\u2009h, 48\u2009h, and 72\u2009h after injury). An\nn\n=\u20095 was established for biochemical analyses based on power analysis and previous studies in this model to determine sample size calculation.\n44\u201347\nAll rats were housed in our viral antigen-free animal facility on site at the Lois Pope Life Center on 12-h light/dark cycles. The veterinary staff at the Lois Pope Life Center conducted routine husbandry procedures twice per week and checked on the condition of all animals daily. Animals were monitored after surgery to ensure they did not develop post-operative infections or experience discomfort.\n\nUnilateral PBBI surgery\nRats were anesthetized with 2\u20135% isoflurane delivered in a mixture of 70% nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen. The body temperature was maintained at normothermia (37\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) throughout the entire surgery by a homoeothermic heating pad. The head of the anesthetized rat was secured in the stereotaxic device for insertion of the PBBI probe. The PBBI apparatus consists of a penetrating probe (Kadence Science, Lake Success, NY), a stereotaxic frame (Kopf, Tujunga, CA) equipped with a specially designed probe holder, and a hydraulic pressure-pulse generator (4B080; MITRE, MA). The penetrating probe is made of a 20-gauge stainless steel tube with fixed perforations along one end that are sealed by a piece of airtight elastic tubing. The probe is secured on the probe holder with the unperforated end attached to the pulse generator angled at 50\u00b0 from the vertical axis and 25\u00b0 counter clockwise from the midline. After a midline scalp incision, a burr hole (diameter\u2009=\u20094\u2009mm) was created using a dental drill to expose the right frontal pole at +4.5\u2009mm anterior-posterior, +2\u2009mm medial-lateral to bregma, as previously described.\n42\nThe PBBI probe was then advanced through the cranial window into the right hemisphere to a depth of 12\u2009mm from the surface of the brain. Once the probe was in place, the pulse generator was activated by a computer to release a pressure pulse calibrated to produce a rapid expansion of the water-filled elastic tubing to induce an elliptical-shaped balloon (diameter\u2009=\u20090.633\u2009mm, duration\u2009=\u200940\u2009msec) to a volume equal to 10% of the total brain volume. This rapid inflation/deflation mimics the generation of a ballistic force shock wave, thereby creating a temporary unilateral cavity in the brain. After deflation, the probe was immediately retracted from the brain and the skin incision closed with wound clips. Sham surgeries consisted of the midline scalp incision, the right frontal burr hole, and the skin incision closed with wound clips.\n\nImmunoblotting\nSham animals were sacrificed 24\u2009h post-surgery, while PBBI injured animals were sacrificed 4\u2009h, 24\u2009h, 48\u2009h, and 72\u2009h after injury. Rats were anesthetized with high dose 2\u20135% isoflurane for 5\u2009min and decapitated in a guillotine. Ipsilateral and contralateral (to the injury) cortical tissue was dissected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Cortical tissues were lysed in 1\u2009mL of buffer and the supernatants were resolved by gel electrophoresis. To control for protein loading, tissue homogenates were evaluated by bicinchoninic acid assay and loaded samples were normalized to 25\u2009\u03bcg of protein. Protein was resolved in either 4\u201320% or 10\u201320% Criterion TGX Stain-Free Precast gels (BioRad) and transferred to either 0.2-\u03bcm or 0.45-\u03bcm pore polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes for low molecular weight and high molecular weight proteins, respectively. Membranes were then blotted using antibodies (1:1000) for IL-1\u03b2 (CST), IL-18, caspase-1 (Novus), ASC (Santa Cruz), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP; R&D Systems), NLRP3 (Abcam) and GSDMD (Novus). Membranes were imaged using the ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (BioRad). Total protein was resolved by activating the stain-free gels with ultraviolet light, resulting in the binding of a tri-halo compound to the tryptophan residues of all proteins in the gel. The tri-halo compound then migrates to the membrane during the protein transfer. Prior to applying enhanced chemiluminesence substrate, the membrane is imaged in the ChemiDoc system. Quantification of band density was performed with Image Lab (BioRad) and data were normalized to total protein. Recent studies have shown that total protein, particularly total protein using stain-free technology, is superior to high abundance proteins such as \u03b2-actin and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrongenase as loading control.\n48\u201350\nHigh abundance proteins are easily overloaded, with studies showing that less than 2\u2009\u03bcg of total protein should be loaded when using \u03b2-actin.\n51\nA representative membrane with total protein is shown in\nSupplementary Figure 1\n(see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n).\n\nPartial purification of pyroptosome\nASC oligomers were partially purified from rat cortical lysates as previously described.\n52\nBriefly, Sham and 48\u2009h homogenates (equal to 50\u2009\u03bcg of total protein) were filtered through 5\u2009\u03bcm PVDF centrifugal filter tubes at 200\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 5\u2009min. The flowthrough was then centrifuged at 2700\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 8\u2009min. The supernatant was then discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 40\u2009\u03bcL of 3[(3-chlomidopropyl) dimehtylammonio]-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS) buffer (20\u2009mmol/L HEPES-KOH, pH7.5, 5\u2009mmol/L MgCl2, 0.5\u2009mmol/L EGTA, 0.1\u2009mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylflouride, protease inhibit cocktail, and 0.1% CHAPS). The samples were then spun at 10,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 8\u2009min and the pellet resuspended in 27.8\u2009\u03bcL CHAPS; 2.2\u2009\u03bcL of 2\u2009mM disuccinimidyl suberate (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 10\u2009min at room temperature to cross-link ASC oligomers. An equal volume of 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009Laemli buffer was added, and samples were boiled for 7\u2009min and subjected to gel electrophoresis on 10\u201320% Criterion TGX Stain-Free Precast gels (BioRad) and immunoblot analysis.\n\nHistopathology and immunohistochemistry\nRats were anesthetized with high-dose 2\u20135% isoflurane for 5\u2009min and perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline, followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer. Brains were dissected out and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 12\u2009h.\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E)\nAnimals were sacrificed 1 week post-injury. After post-fixation, brains were then transferred to phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), then paraffin embedded. Serial coronal sections (20\u2009\u03bcm) were cut from 4.0 to \u22127.0\u2009mm from bregma. Sections were mounted on Superfrost plus microscopic slides and H&E stained.\nImmunostaining\nAnimals were sacrificed 48\u2009h and 12 weeks post-injury. After post-fixation, brains were then transferred to a 30% sucrose solution for 24\u2009h and then frozen in M1 embedding matrix or GFM tissue freezing medium using dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C before cryosectioning. Serial coronal sections (40\u2009\u03bcm) were cut from 4.0 to \u22127.0\u2009mm from bregma. A group of 24 serial sections were collected at 960\u2009\u03bcm intervals and stored free-floating in cryopreserve prior to immunostaining. Samples were assessed with the following primary antibodies with the indicated dilutions: neuronal nuclei (NeuN) 1:100; glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) 1:800; ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1) 1:400; IL-1\u03b2 1:250; and ASC 1:1000. Appropriate goat anti-mouse 488, goat anti-chicken 488, goat anti-rabbit 594, and goat anti-guinea pig 647 (Life Technologies; 1:250) secondary antibodies also were used. Sections were incubated with 2-(4-amidnophenyl)-1H-indole-6-carboxmidine (DAPI) prior to mounting and imaging. High-resolution fluorescent images were generated on a confocal microscope and post-processed using Imaris software (version 8.0.1).\n\nStereological counts of microglia subtypes\nUnbiased stereological counts were conducted on serial sections immunostained with Iba-1 and ASC using Stereoinvestigator. A 500\u2009\u00d7\u2009500\u2009\u03bcm counting grid and 75\u2009\u00d7\u200975\u2009\u03bcm counting frame was used to estimate the number of microglia in the sham cortex and contralateral and ipsilateral cortices of each animal (\nn\n=\u20095). Microglia were counted into four morphological subtypes related to activation state as described by Torres-Platas and colleagues.\n53\nEach microglia phenotype count was further divided into cells expressing ASC (double-labeled) or cells not expressing ASC. Therefore, eight total markers were used to quantify ASC expression within the different microglia morphology.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). All measures were expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM), with\np\n\u2264\u20090.05 considered significant in all statistical tests. Immunoblot results were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnet's multiple comparisons. Stereological results were compared using both one-way and two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons."

    "Methods": "Animal groups and experimental design\nTwenty-five female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats at three months of age (225\u2013250\u2009g; Harlan, San Diego, CA) were divided randomly into three groups: (1) age-matched control group (na\u00efve;\nn\n=\u20094), (2) spinal cord contusion (contusion;\nn\n=\u200910), (3) spinal cord transection (transection;\nn\n=\u200911). All rats were purchased nulliparous at \u223cthree months of age at the beginning of the study and were tested over three months (animals were six months old at the study end-point). The importance of using nulliparous female rats to study cancellous bone assessments has been established previously by reports showing that repeated cycles of pregnancy and lactation in proven breeder female rats alters their bone structure and material properties, making them inappropriate for use as age-matched controls in the current study design.\n18\nAll procedures involving animals followed National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Cleveland Clinic. Animals were housed in ventilated humidity- and temperature-controlled (23\u201325\u00b0C) rooms with a 12:12-h light-dark cycle and standard rodent chow and water available\nad libitum\n.\n\nContusion SCI\nRats were acclimated to the animal resource center, behavior assessments, and experimental handlers before starting the study. Rats were anesthetized under 2% isoflurane mixed with oxygen. The musculature was cut from T7\u2013T9, and the dorsal surface of T8 was exposed by laminectomy. The vertebral column was stabilized by clamping the T7 and T9 vertebral bodies with forceps fixed to the base of the Infinite Horizon Impact (IH impactor, Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC). The animals were situated on the platform, and the 2.5-mm stainless steel impactor tip was positioned over the midpoint of T8 and impacted with a 250 kDyne force. Monofilament sutures (4-0) were used to close the skin and musculature. A force/displacement graph was used to monitor impact consistency, and any animal that exhibited an abnormal impact graph or greater than 10% deviation from 250 kDyne was excluded immediately from the study. Manual bladder expression was performed twice daily throughout the three-month experimental period.\n\nTransection SCI\nBefore the surgical procedure, rats were anesthetized using 2% isoflurane mixed with oxygen. Animals were maintained on a heating pad, and rectal temperature was monitored and maintained during the procedure. Bipolar electrocauterization was used to minimize bleeding in some animals. A laminectomy was performed as described above for contusion SCI, followed by complete transverse cuts of the spinal cord at the T8 level. A surgical microscope was used to ensure the complete removal of neural tissue, including fiber bundles. The muscle and skin layers were closed with 4-0 sutures. Bladders were expressed manually twice per day throughout the three-month experimental period.\n\nOpen-field locomotion assessments\nLocomotor function was evaluated using the BBB rating scale\n19\nranging from 0 to 21. Assessments were performed before SCI and weekly thereafter throughout the entire experimental period as described previously. Scoring was undertaken by two independent examiners who were trained initially on the BBB scoring system and were blinded regarding animal groups.\n\nMyofiber cross-sectional area (CSA)\nAt the experimental end-point, each rat was euthanized and perfused (intracardiac) with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Both the soleus muscle and the tibialis anterior muscle were harvested. Samples of the muscle blocks were sectioned in a cryostat into 8-\u03bcm thick cross-sectional pieces and mounted directly onto gelatin-coated slides. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to visualize the myofibers of the muscle. Images of the sections were taken using a Leica DM6000 (DM6000; Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). The CSA of approximately 200 randomly selected myofibers from each muscle per animal were measured using MATLAB R2016a (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA).\n\nBone structural assessments\nBone structure and mineral density metrics were evaluated using micro-CT. Micro-CT data were acquired post-mortem on a region of interest (ROI) from midfemur to the tibia-fibula synostosis in isolated hind-limbs at 20\u2009\u03bcm isotropic voxel resolution (GE Locus, Trifoil, Inc.). Post-acquisition reconstruction (GE Reconstruction Utility software), micro-CT data volumes were calibrated/normalized further using solid water phantoms that were scanned in conjunction with the\nex vivo\nspecimens. The phantoms are representative of spongy, trabecular (800\u2009mg/cm\n3\nhydroxyapatite), and cortical (1250\u2009mg/cm\n3\nhydroxyapaptite) bone mineral content and density. The micro-CT volume grayscale values (correlated to Hounsfield units) were normalized to these standard phantoms so that a standard grayscale threshold level could be applied to all volumes for trabecular bone metrics (HUCalibrate_v1.1 software, Image-IQ Inc., Cleveland OH;\nhttp://image-iq.com/\n).\nTrabecular bone structural and material metrics were determined from a 3.0-mm ROI in the proximal tibia starting approximately 1.8-mm below the growth plate (\nFig. 1\n). All volumes were registered into the same orientation and three-dimensional (3D) space, allowing for the same ROI to be cropped from the full tibia bone between animals. Subsequently, all volumes were cropped to a 3-mm segment and the cortical volume masked along the cropped length as represented in the figure. Outcome values were determined from the 16-bit 3D volumes, specifically within the trabecular compartment, thresholded at a uniform grayscale value of 1800, and post-processed using BoneAnalysis_v5.1 software (Image-IQ Inc., Cleveland OH) for structural and mineral density outcome metrics.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRepresentative micro-computed tomography volume of the proximal tibia that depicts the region-of-interest (ROI) over which bone structural and mineral density metrics were determined. The ROI was 3\u2009mm in length, beginning approximately 1.8\u2009mm below the epiphyseal line of the tibia.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll BBB scores, CSA values of muscles, and bone structure and mineral density metric values were reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM) for each group. Statistical significance was set at\np\n<\u20090.05 and assessed by analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA), followed by Tukey\npost hoc\ntests between groups using the statistical analysis software GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA).\nPearson correlation analyses were also performed to determine the relationship between locomotor function (BBB scores) and CSA values of muscle, as well as between BBB scores and mineral density metric values of bone. All analyses were performed using the statistical analysis software GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experimental protocols were approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accord with the established guidelines from the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the National Institutes of Health. Animals were group housed in the University of Kentucky Medical Center animal vivarium with a 14:10\u2009h light/dark photoperiod and provided food and water\nad libitum\n. Adult male C57BL/6J mice 8\u201310 weeks of age, weighing 25\u201330\u2009g, were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) for experiments.\n\nControlled cortical impact\nMice were anesthetized using 3% isoflurane for preparation of the scalp and placement in the stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) and maintained by 2% isoflurane by nose cone for the duration of the surgery. An incision was made on the midline of the scalp to expose the skull. A 5-mm craniotomy was placed midway between bregma and lambda, lateral to the sagittal suture on the left hemisphere of the skull, leaving the dura intact. CCI injury was performed with a computer-controlled pneumatically driven piston with a 3-mm rounded impactor tip to rapidly (3.5\u2009m/s) and transiently (500\u2009msec) produce a 1-mm depth impact to the exposed dura of the brain (TBI-0310 Impactor; Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Versailles, KY). Sham-injured animals received anesthesia and a craniotomy. Animals were randomly assigned to either sham injury or brain injury and treatment with either vehicle or recombinant human IGF-1 (hIGF-1).\n\nCentral infusion of insulin-like growth factor-1\nMice were randomized for injury and treatment status. While anesthetized, a cannula was placed in the contralateral ventricle (anteroposterior AP \u22120.5\u2009mm bregma, mediolateral ML \u22121.0\u2009mm, dorsoventral DV \u22123.0\u2009mm\n53\n) 15\u2009min after sham injury or CCI. The cannula (brain infusion kit 3; Alzet, Cupertino, CA) was attached to an osmotic minipump (model 1007D, 0.5\u2009\u03bcL/h; Alzet) for continuous intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion for a period of 7 days. Minipumps were primed in sterile USP-grade phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a 37\u00b0C water bath for at least 6\u2009h before surgical implantation, with the exception of the delayed treatment study, in which an approximate 6-h delay in treatment initiation was achieved by implantation of a nonprimed minipump. The base of the cannula was secured to the skull using an instant adhesive (Loctite 454; Alzet) and a set screw (MX-0090-01F-C;\nAmazonSupply.com\n, Seattle, WA) was placed adjacent to the base of the cannula with a small amount of dental acrylic. The minipump was positioned in the subcutaneous space over the scapula, lateral to the spine. Mice exhibited no observable impairment in mobility resulting from minipump implantation. The minipumps were filled with vehicle (pH 7.4, 24\u2009mM of acetic acid diluted in USP-grade PBS) or 0.026, 0.085, 0.26, or 0.85\u2009mg/mL of hIGF-1 (National Hormone and Peptide Program, Torrance, CA) to deliver 0.3, 1, 3, or 10\u2009\u03bcg/day. IGF-1 dosing was extrapolated from previous studies demonstrating efficacy of IGF-1 to attenuate somatosensory impairment and reduce cell loss after cerebral hypoxic-ischemia,\n54\u201357\nreduce cell loss in a model of Huntington's disease,\n58\nand promote hippocampal neurogenesis.\n59\nAfter cannula implantation, a small circular disk of dental acrylic was adhered to the skull over the craniotomy site, the scalp was sutured, and the mouse was placed on a heating pad to maintain normal body temperature. All mice received a subcutaneous injection of 1\u2009mL of sterilized saline to prevent dehydration from the surgical procedure and implantation of the minipump. Once ambulatory, mice were returned to their home cage.\n\nStudy 1 (dose response for human insulin-like growth factor-1)\nMice subjected to CCI injury were randomized to receive infusion of 0.3, 1, 3, or 10\u2009\u03bcg/day of IGF-1 (\nn\n=\u20095/dose) or vehicle (\nn\n=\u20094) beginning 15\u2009min post-injury for a period of 7 days. Histological assessment and quantification of immature neuron density was performed as the primary outcome measure at 7 days post-injury. No animals were excluded. Although histology was the primary outcome for this study, cognitive function was assessed at 3 and 7 days post-injury using the novel object recognition (NOR) task, as described below, in order to provide pilot data to inform later studies.\n\nStudy 2 (acute onset infusion of 10\u2009\u03bcg/day of human insulin-like growth factor-1)\nBased on results from study 1, larger cohorts of mice were generated to more comprehensively evaluate the effects of acute-onset 10-\u03bcg/day hIGF-1 infusion. Sham-injured (\nn\n=\u200910/treatment group) and CCI-injured mice (\nn\n=\u200919/treatment group) received central infusion of 10\u2009\u03bcg/day of hIGF-1 or vehicle for 7 days post-injury at a flow rate of 0.5\u2009\u03bcL/h. Blood from nonfasted mice was collected onto test strips by tail prick by a 25-G needle and glucose levels measured using a handheld glucometer (OneTouch Ultra\n\u00ae\n; LifeScan Canada Ltd., Burnaby, BC, Canada) before anesthesia, at 90\u2009min, 1 and 7 days post-injury. Motor and cognitive deficits were assessed during the week post-injury by a modified neurological severity score (NSS) and the NOR task, respectively, as described below. At 7 days post-injury, mice received an overdose of Fatal-Plus\n\u00ae\n(65\u2009mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital; Vortech Pharmaceuticals, Dearborn, MI), and blood was collected by intracardial puncture for measurement of serum hIGF-1. Mice were randomized into one of two groups to be utilized for 1) quantification of hIGF-1 and Akt activation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot, respectively (\nn\n=\u20095 sham-injured per treatment group and\nn\n=\u20098\u20139 CCI-injured per treatment group) or 2) cresyl violet histological and immature neuron immunohistochemical assessments (\nn\n=\u20094 sham-injured/treatment group and\nn\n=\u20098\u201310 brain-injured/treatment group) described below. Accurate placement of the cannula was determined by the visual verification of the needle track in cresyl violet\u2013stained coronal sections. A small number of animals were excluded based on improper placement of the cannula (\nn\n=\u20091 sham + vehicle;\nn\n=\u20091 sham + IGF-1) or because of obstruction or damage to cannulation tubing (\nn\n=\u20091 sham + IGF-1;\nn\n=\u20092 CCI + IGF-1). An additional cohort of mice received CCI brain injury and either no cannulation, vehicle infusion, or 10\u2009\u03bcg/day of IGF-1 infusion (\nn\n=\u20096/group) over 7 days, at which time they were euthanized for measurement of brain water content as described below.\n\nStudy 3 (delayed onset infusion of human insulin-like growth factor-1)\nMice were subjected to CCI and infused with either 10\u2009\u03bcg/day of IGF-1 (\nn\n=\u20095) or vehicle (\nn\n=\u20093) beginning at approximately 6\u2009h post-injury by implantation of a nonprimed minipump at 15\u2009min post-injury. Histological assessment and quantification of immature neuron density were performed at 7 days post-injury. No animals were excluded.\n\nMotor function assessment using a modified neurological severity score\nA previously described modification of the NSS task\n60\nwas used to assess motor dysfunction at 3\u2009h and 1, 3, 5, and 7 days post-injury. One day pre-injury, mice were acclimated to four Plexiglas beams of varying widths (3, 2, 1, and 0.5\u2009cm) and a 0.5-cm diameter wooden rod. The beams and rod were 60\u2009cm in length and elevated 47\u2009cm above a table top. Three points were given for successful crossing of the beam with normal position and usage of the forelimb and hindlimb within 30\u2009sec. Two points were given for successful crossing of the beam despite either a forelimb or hindlimb hanging below the beam, and 1 point was given for crossing the beam despite inverting below the beam one or more times. The mouse was righted and allowed to continue across the beam if it became inverted on the beam. A score of zero was given if the mouse did not cross in the allotted 30\u2009sec or fell off the beam. For the rod, two points were given for successful crossing of the beam in the allotted 30\u2009sec. A score of 1 was given for crossing despite inverting more than three times. A score of 0 was given if the mouse did not traverse in the allotted time or fell off the rod. A cumulative score for each animal was recorded on each day of testing. Scoring was performed by an evaluator blinded to injury and treatment conditions of the mice.\n\nCognitive performance evaluation using a novel object recognition paradigm\nOne day pre-injury, each mouse was habituated to a dedicated, clear plastic cage (32\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009\u00d7\u200914\u2009cm) with an open top for a period of 1\u2009h. Several hours later, each mouse was returned to its dedicated cage, now containing two identical Lego\n\u00ae\nDuplo\n\u00ae\nfigures placed in opposite corners, and exploration was monitored for 5\u2009min (familiarization trial). At 3 days post-injury, the familiarization trial was repeated using the two original objects, recording the time spent exploring each object over a 5-min period. Mice were then returned to their home cage. After a 4-h delay, the mouse was returned to the test cage where one of the original objects had been replaced with a novel object. The time spent exploring each object was recorded for the 5-min testing period. On day 7 post-injury, mice were tested for 5\u2009min using the same familiar object and a new novel object. A recognition index was calculated as the time spent exploring the novel object as a percentage of total object exploration time. Testing was performed by an evaluator blinded to injury and treatment conditions of the mice.\n\nTissue collection\nIn study 2, blood was collected at the terminal time point to measure hIGF-1 in serum. After overdose with Fatal-Plus, as described above, blood was collected intracardially, transferred to an Eppendorf tube, and allowed to coagulate for 30\u2009min. To extract serum, coagulated blood was centrifuged at 4500\ng\nfor 10\u2009min at room temperature. Serum was transferred to a new tube and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\nFor ELISA and western blotting, mice received an overdose of Fatal-Plus before decapitation. The brain was rapidly removed from the skull and placed onto an ice-cold dissection plate. To concentrate collection of tissue on the injury site, 3\u2009mm of the anterior brain was blocked in the coronal plane and the remaining ipsilateral and contralateral cortical and hippocampal regions were dissected and separately placed in Eppendorf tubes and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\nFor histology and immunohistochemistry, mice received an overdose of Fatal-Plus and were transcardially perfused with heparinized saline to clear blood from the vasculature followed by 10% neutral-pH buffered formalin. Mice were decapitated and their heads placed in formalin for 24\u2009h. The brain was dissected from the head and placed in formalin for an additional 24\u2009h. Brains were then placed in 30% sucrose for 24\u2009h for cryoprotection before freezing in \u221230\u00b0C isopentanes cooled on dry ice. Brains were cut into 40-\u03bcm-thick coronal sections on a freezing sliding microtome (Microm; Dolbey-Jamison, Pottstown, PA) at \u221220\u00b0C (Physitemp Instruments, Inc., Clifton, NJ).\nFor edema measurements, mice received an overdose of Fatal-Plus before decapitation. The brain was rapidly removed from the skull and placed onto an ice-cold dissection plate. The ipsilateral and contralateral cortical and hippocampal regions were dissected as described for ELISA and western blot analysis. To calculate water weight using the wet/dry weight method,\n61\n,\n62\ntissue was immediately weighed, desiccated in an oven at 70\u00b0C for 24\u2009h, and reweighed to acquire the dry weight. The percent water content was calculated as (wet weight \u2013 dry weight) / wet weight\u2009\u00d7\u2009100.\n\nPreparation of tissue for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blotting\nCortical and hippocampal samples were homogenized in cold lysis buffer (1% triton X-100, 20\u2009mM of Tris-HCl, 150\u2009mM of NaCl, 5\u2009mM of EGTA, 10\u2009mM of EDTA, 10% glycerol, and proteinase inhibitor cocktail; Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and centrifuged for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C at a speed of 10,000\ng\n. Supernatants were collected and utilized for analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL).\n\nQuantification of insulin-like growth factor-1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\nBy using recombinant hIGF-1, exogenously infused IGF-1 could be distinguished from endogenous mouse IGF-1 using an ELISA kit for hIGF-1. hIGF-1 was quantified using the highly specific Quantikine\n\u00ae\nhuman IGF-1 ELISA kit (DG100; R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. hIGF-1 was not detected in serum or brain samples of vehicle-treated mice. Serum and brain samples were pretreated to dissociate IGF-1 from the binding proteins. hIGF-1 standards (0.094\u20136.000\u2009ng/mL) and pre-treated samples were pipetted in duplicate into a 96-well plate coated with monoclonal antibody specific to hIGF-1. Absorbance of each well was measured at 450 and 540\u2009nm (background subtraction) wavelengths.\n\nWestern blot\nWestern blot analyses were performed as previously described.\n50\nSupernatant samples from ipsilateral hippocampi were loaded in triplicate (30\u2009\u03bcg) and electrophoresed through a 3\u20138% Tris-HCl gel at 150\u2009V. After transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, membranes were blocked for 1\u2009h in 5% dry milk dissolved in 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and incubated overnight with a primary antibody for phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) ser\n473\n(rabbit monoclonal, 1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Membranes were rinsed and incubated for 1\u2009h with a secondary antibody recognizing rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; 1:5000, IRDye800CW\n\u00ae\n; Rockland Instruments, Inc., Gilbertsville, PA). Membranes were rinsed and imaged with the Li-Cor Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). After pAkt development, membranes were probed for the control protein actin using an anti-\u03b2-actin primary antibody (mouse monoclonal, 1:5000; Calbiochem Inc., San Diego, CA) and secondary antibody conjugated to an infrared dye (1:10,000; Rockland). For quantification, optical density (OD) of each pAkt band was divided by its respective actin OD and normalized to the mean relative OD for vehicle-treated sham-injured mice.\n\nHistological (cresyl violet) staining\nFor each brain, every tenth coronal section was mounted and air-dried on gelatin-coated slides. Slides were hydrated in graded ethanol solutions, stained with 0.5% cresyl violet (Acros Organics, Somerville, NJ), rinsed in water, dehydrated through graded ethanol solutions, cleared in xylenes (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ), and mounted with Permount (Fisher Scientific).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nIn an additional set, every tenth coronal brain section (n\u2009=\u20096\u20137 per animal), centered with respect to the injury epicenter, was immunolabeled using standard free-floating immunohistochemistry protocols for doublecortin (DCX) as previously described.\n22\nSections were washed in TBS and blocked with 5% normal horse serum with 0.1% Triton-X-100 in TBS for 30\u2009min. DCX primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was diluted in blocking solution and placed on the tissues for overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C. Sections were rinsed with TBS and incubated with secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor\n\u00ae\n488; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) diluted in blocking solution for 1\u2009h and rinsed with TBS. Sections were incubated with Hoechst (1:10,000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 1.5\u2009min to label all nuclei and rinsed with TBS. Labeled sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, cover-slipped with Fluoromount (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL), and stored at 4\u00b0C.\n\nImage acquisition\nRepresentative images of cresyl violet\u2013stained sections were acquired at 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification using an AX80 Olympus microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). Representative images of DCX immunoreactivity were acquired at 10\u2009\u00d7 or 20\u2009\u00d7 magnification using a C2+ TiE Nikon confocal microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY).\n\nCellular quantification\nQuantification of DCX-positive cells was performed for each section in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus granular layer for all studies, and the contralateral granular layer in study 1. All positively labeled cells were manually counted live through the microscope eyepieces by assessing DCX immunoreactivity through all focal planes within the dentate gyrus granular layer at 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification on an epifluorescent microscope (Olympus BX51) equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter (41001; Chroma Technology, Bellows Falls, VT). Live quantification at 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification was utilized to enhance resolution of immature neurons. Cellular counts were normalized to the volume of the dentate gyrus granular layer of each section to control for differences in dentate gyrus size across sections. The Hoechst-labeled dentate gyrus granular layer was imaged (AX80; Olympus) and its area measured using ImagePro (MediaCybernetics, Rockville, MD). The thickness of each section was measured, in microns, using an epifluorescent scope (Olympus BX51) equipped with a stereology stage. Granular layer area and thickness measurements were used to calculate granular layer volume. Volumetric density measurements (1000 cells/mm\n3\n) represent the entire granular layer, inclusive of the subgranular, inner, and outer granular layers. A mean cell density was calculated for all quantified sections for each animal. Sections from animals with representative cell densities, based upon analysis of cell counts, were selected for imaging and included in the figure panels. Quantification of all sections was performed by an investigator blinded to the injury and treatment conditions of each animal.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). In study 1, cellular densities were statistically compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Dunnett's multiple comparison test. NOR recognition indices for each group were compared to chance performance (50%) using a one-sample\nt\n-test. In study 2, serum levels of IGF-1 were compared using a Student's\nt\n-test and blood glucose levels were compared by a repeated measures two-way ANOVA. Akt activation, edema measurements for each region, and cellular densities were compared by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc tests. NOR recognition indices for each group were compared to chance performance (50%) using a one-sample\nt\n-test. Relative differences in NOR recognition indices across groups were analyzed at each time point by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons tests. Brain levels of IGF-1 and NSS motor function scores were compared by repeated measures one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc tests. In study 3, cellular densities were compared using an unpaired two-tailed\nt\n-test. Statistical tests were completed using Graphpad Prism software (Graphpad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). A\np\nvalue less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Mice\nThe disposition of all mice entered into the study, including use and reasons for exclusion, are described in\nFigure 1\n. Briefly, adult (2\u20134 months old), male and female Thy1-GFP-M positive (TG+) mice and their Thy1-GFP-M negative littermates (TG-) were acquired from two sources (in-house colony,\nn\n=\u200932 and Jackson Laboratories,\nn\n=\u20094). At baseline and after SCI, in-house and Jackson TG+ mice did not differ in size, injury severity, or behavioral performance (\np\n>\u20090.05), except on the Von Frey Hair (VFH) Test (pre \u2013 in-house: 0.40\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06\u2009g; Jackson: 0.83\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06\u2009g;\np\n<\u20090.05; post \u2013 in-house: 0.62\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\u2009g; Jackson: 2.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.17g;\np\n<\u20090.05). As such, in-house and Jackson-acquired TG+ mice were combined into a single TG+ group. C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice acquired from Jackson Laboratories (\nn\n=\u200910) served as strain controls. This strain is recommended as an \u201capproximate control\u201d because the Thy1-GFP-M mouse line has a mixed but predominately C57BL/6J background. Mice were housed three to five per cage and provided food and water\nad libitum.\nAll experiments were conducted in accordance with The Ohio State University Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nAnimal enrollment and use. Flow diagram illustrates all mice included in the current studies. Animals included in behavioral outcomes testing are noted on the left. Timing and reason for exclusions are noted on the right. TG, transgenic; SCI, spinal cord injury; WT, wild type; TX, transection.\n\nSCI\nTo determine the effect of axonal sparing on recovery in Thy1 derived mice, we randomized animals into contusion (SCI) or transection (TX) groups. To control for the effect of strain on recovery, WT mice received the same contusion injury. Because of minimal recovery reported in C57BL/6 mice with TX,\n15\n,\n74\n,\n75\na WT TX group was not included. There was no difference in weight between groups at the time of surgery (TG+ SCI\u2009=\u200921.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u2009g; TG+ TX\u2009=\u200917.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u2009g; TG- SCI\u2009=\u200918.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9\u2009g; WT SCI\u2009=\u200918.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009g;\np\n>\u20090.05).\nSpinal cord contusion was performed as described previously.\n76\nIn brief, mice were anesthetized with a ketamine (138\u2009mg/kg)-xylazine (20\u2009mg/kg) cocktail and given prophylactic antibiotic agents (gentocin, 1\u2009mg/kg). Using aseptic techniques, removal of the T9 spinous process and lamina exposed the dura. After stabilizing the vertebral column, the Infinite Horizon (IH) device delivered 75 kdyn of force to induce a moderate-severe contusion injury. Force and displacement trends were similar to those established by Ghasemlou and colleagues\n77\n(mean force: 76.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.44 kdyn; mean displacement: 591.2\u2009\u00b1\u200919.76\u2009\u03bcm).\nFor TX groups, the dura was opened at T9, and lidocaine was administered to the exposed spinal cord to suppress reflexes. The spinal cord was completely cut at T9 using irridectomy scissors, and a scalpel was used to cut along the spinal canal to ensure that all axons were cut. The incision was closed in layers, and 2\u2009mL of sterile saline was administered subcutaneously (sq) to prevent dehydration. During recovery, mice received antibiotic agents (1\u2009mg/kg gentocin, sq) and saline daily for five days and manual bladder expression twice per day until tissue harvest.\n74\n\nHistology\nMice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine (207\u2009mg/kg)-xylazine (30\u2009mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.2) at 42 or 49 days after SCI. Spinal cord segments from the epicenter were post-fixed for 1\u2009h in 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed overnight in 0.2M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4), then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose before being embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Thermo Scientific) and frozen on dry ice.\n76\n,\n78\n,\n79\nEpicenter blocks were sectioned transversely in their entirety at 20\u2009\u03bcm on a Microm HM505E cryostat and every 10th section was stained for myelin using eriochrome cyanine. Eriochrome cyanine staining was differentiated using 5% iron alum and borax ferricyanide solutions.\n80\nThe lesion epicenter, identified as the section with the largest central core lesion and least amount of stained myelin, was quantified using stereological point counting (Stereoinvestigator; Microbrightfield). Using the Cavalieri method, a point grid was placed randomly over the epicenter section, and intersections over tissue were identified as spared white matter, spared gray matter, or lesioned tissue. Each intersection represented a point (\np),\nand point counts for each section were converted to area estimates using the following formula: Estimated Area\u2009=\u2009(\n\u03a3\nP\n)*(\na/p)\nwhere\n\u03a3\nP\nis the sum of the points for an individual mouse and\na/p\nis the area of each point. The area of stained white matter at the epicenter was divided by total cross-sectional area to calculate a percentage of tissue sparing. The unstained tissue area was also divided by total cross-sectional area to determine percent lesion area.\n\nMotor assessments\nOpen field locomotion\nLocomotor recovery was assessed in the open field using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS)\n15\nbefore SCI, at one and seven days post-injury (dpi), and weekly thereafter. Two raters, blind to group assignment rated locomotor performance over 4\u2009min considering joint movement, weight support, plantar stepping, coordination, paw position, trunk and tail control. Scores range from no hindlimb movement (0) to normal locomotor function (9).\nGrid Walk\nFine motor control was evaluated in a subset of animals (TG+ SCI\nn\n=\u200910; TG+ TX\nn\n=\u20093; TG- SCI\nn\n=\u20094; WT SCI\nn\n=\u20097) by assessing precise paw placement during locomotion on a 2.54\u2009cm square metal grid apparatus (41\u2009\u00d7\u200928\u2009\u00d7\u200936\u2009mm). Mice were acclimated to the grid pre-operatively and then tested at na\u00efve and 42\u2009dpi. Performance was recorded with a digital camcorder (Handycam HDR SR11; Sony) and analyzed over five volitional passes. Success was determined by a weight-supported hindlimb step from rung to rung. The number of successful hindlimb steps are expressed relative to the number of forelimb steps and reported as percent success.\n\nSensory assessments\nA male rater, blind to experimental groups, performed all sensory measures, which eliminated gender effects of the rater.\n81\nEach sensory assessment was performed at a consistent time of day and did not occur on the same day as another sensory measure.\nMechanical sensitivity\nTactile sensitivity of the hindlimb was assessed in a subset of animals (TG+ SCI\nn\n=\u200910; TG+ TX\nn\n=\u20093; TG- SCI\nn\n=\u20094; WT SCI\nn\n=\u20097) using von Frey Hairs (Semmes Weinstein; Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). Briefly, mice were placed under a small, opaque container on an elevated wire mesh to allow access to the plantar surface of the paws. Animals acclimated to the testing environment for 30\u2009min before testing. Hindpaws were assessed using the up/down method, beginning with the 0.4\u2009g filament applied to the plantar L5 dermatome.\n74\n,\n82\n,\n83\nEach hindpaw received 10 consecutive trials. Additional trials were performed as needed to achieve a 50% withdrawal threshold, which was determined as the lowest force evoking withdrawal in at least half of the trials for that force. Mice with spinal cord transection were unable to achieve plantar placement, therefore were held gently to achieve plantar placement and assessed using the dorsal von Frey method described by Detloff and coworkers.\n84\nThermal sensitivity\nSensitivity to thermal stimuli was assessed according to the Hargreaves Method\n85\n(Plantar Test Apparatus; Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy). Mice (TG+ SCI\nn\n=\u200915; TG+ TX\nn\n=\u20093; TG- SCI\nn\n=\u20094; WT SCI\nn\n=\u20097) acclimated for 30\u2009min before testing in individual clear plastic compartments (11\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200917\u2009cm) with a glass floor. Infrared, radiant heat (25 watts) was applied to the plantar L5 dermatome through the glass until a withdrawal response occurred. A photocell on the heat source determined withdrawal and the duration (in seconds) of heat application (latency to withdraw). To prevent tissue damage, a 20\u2009sec maximum application was set. Mice were tested randomly, and five trials were collected on each hindpaw. The longest and shortest latencies were dropped for each paw, before averaging the remaining latencies to yield a single withdrawal threshold for each mouse.\n\nLiterature review and synthesis\nTo place the behavior of the Thy1 mouse line into context with the SCI field, we performed a synthesis of the available literature examining sensory and motor behavior after SCI in mice. The PubMed literature search used combinations of the following search terms: spinal cord injury, spinal cord injuries (MeSH term), sensation, pain, neuropathic pain, hyperalgesia (MeSH term), and mice (MeSH term). Searches using only MeSH terms failed to yield results. To maximize generalizability, only studies in mice and only those using spinal cord contusion injury were included. All other SCI (TX, hemisection, etc.) and pain models (peripheral nerve injury, chronic constriction injury, etc.) were excluded. To be considered, studies were required to report open field locomotion (BMS or other open field locomotor scale) and either mechanical or thermal sensitivity. Only data reported as mechanical sensitivity in grams (g) or thermal sensitivity in latency (seconds) at each time point were included.\nA total of 15 studies were included in the synthesis contributing a total of 16 SCI groups,\n74\n,\n82\n,\n86\u201398\nbecause one study reported data from multiple injury severities.\n74\nOf these studies, all 15 reported BMS or other open field locomotor scale (Tarlov Scale,\n99\nn\n=\u20091), 12 reported mechanical sensitivity, and 13 reported thermal sensitivity. In studies in which pre-injury locomotor performance was not reported,\n88\n,\n89\n,\n91\n,\n97\n,\n98\nthe lowest reported pre-injury score from included studies was assigned (BMS\u2009=\u20098). Data from baseline and chronic SCI (determined as the latest time point examined in each respective study; range\u2009=\u200914 days to 6 months) for each outcome measure were compiled into group data. Percent change scores were calculated for each outcome measure averaged across studies. Average percent change for the compiled literature group was compared with TG+ SCI, TG- SCI, and WT SCI groups.\n\nRehabilitation paradigm\nTreadmill training was performed in a subset of TG+ mice (TG+ TM;\nn\n=\u20094) from 42 to 49 days post-spinal cord contusion. Previously, this late training period did not improve locomotion in C57BL/6J mice, but sensory changes were not examined.\n76\nTraining consisted of eight consecutive days of quadrupedal stepping on a flat grade, custom-built treadmill (Columbus Instruments). Animals performed two, 10-min bouts of stepping separated by a 20-min rest break to deliver 1000+ steps during each 20-min session.\n100\nTraining speed was set initially at a comfortable pace (initial speed: 7.0\u2009m/min) and increased progressively to the fastest speed that did not degrade stepping performance (max speed: 13.0\u2009m/min). Manual assistance was provided as needed for trunk stability during locomotion.\n\nStatistics\nData were analyzed using either one-way or two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with Tukey\npost hoc\ntesting or a\nt\ntest when appropriate. Relationships were determined using the Pearson correlation. Means and standard error of the mean (SEM) are reported throughout. Significance was set at\np\n<\u20090.05 for all statistical tests."

    "Methods": "Study design: Overview\nPatients are screened for prospective enrollment in the LETBI project based on their participation in ongoing cohort studies led by the investigative team, including the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, the TBI Model Systems (TBIMS), and the TBI-Health study.\nThe ACT study has been continuously funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 1994 and includes volunteers from a random sample of community dwelling non-demented Kaiser Permanente Washington (formerly Group Health) members over age 65 who are followed on a 2-year cycle to identify incident dementia cases.\n9\nTo date, the study has enrolled more than 5400 people, approximately one quarter of whom have signed autopsy consents. ACT data sources include genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data, computerized pharmacy, clinical laboratory, and medical record data. At baseline and each study visit, TBI exposure history is queried using standardized methods, and decades of medical records for ACT participants are available to characterize medical care received for TBI.\nThe TBIMS is funded by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research. This prospective study enrolls individuals with complicated mild-to-severe TBI at the time of inpatient rehabilitation, collecting extensive clinical and functional metrics with which to characterize the index TBI, and follows them at 1, 2, and 5 years post-injury and every 5 years thereafter.\n10\nThe LETBI study recruits participants from two TBIMS centers: The Brain Injury Research Center at Mount Sinai (BIRC-MS), first funded in 1987, and the University of Washington (UW) TBIMS, first funded in 1998.\nThe TBI-Health study in the BIRC-MS was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2012 and enrolls individuals who are at least 1 year post-hospitalization for TBI. The TBI-Health study gathers uniform metrics and medical record data to characterize the index TBI, and participants are followed biannually to gather neuropsychological data, self-report measures of mood and health, and clinician and caregiver ratings of behavior and function.\n\nRecruitment and eligibility criteria\nIndividuals in the aforementioned studies are invited to participate in LETBI if they meet at least one of the following inclusion criteria: 1) history of complicated mild, moderate, or severe TBI defined as a blow to the head resulting in at least one of the following: Glasgow Coma Scale score <13 on emergency department admission, loss of consciousness (LOC) >30\u2009min, post-traumatic amnesia >24\u2009h, or trauma-related intracranial abnormality on neuroimaging, or 2) history of two or more mild TBIs defined as an external blow to the head that results in physiological disruption of brain function or altered mental status; LOC if present is <30\u2009min, post-traumatic amnesia if present is <24\u2009h, and Glasgow Coma Scale score \u226513.\n11\nLETBI enrollment began in 2014 with a goal of recruiting a convenience sample of at least 100 participants. Many survivors of TBI have contraindications to MRI due to implanted hardware and metallic devices, so those who are unable to complete\nin vivo\nMRI are included in the study to ensure that the LETBI cohort is representative of the population of interest. Only individuals who assent/consent to brain donation are enrolled in the LETBI project. Informed consent to participate in the LETBI project is obtained from the participant, or from his/her surrogate if he/she is unable to provide informed consent. Control brain specimens from individuals with no history of TBI or neurological or psychiatric disease and no abnormalities detected on gross pathological analysis are acquired from patients who come to autopsy through partner studies at LETBI sites (UW, Mount Sinai, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital [BWH/MGH]), with informed consent provided by the patient or his/her surrogate. Control brains only undergo the\nex vivo\nprotocols described below.\n\nNeurobehavioral evaluation\nAn overview of study procedures is shown in\nFigure 1\n. All participants undergo a standardized neurobehavioral evaluation, which includes a battery of NIH Common Data Elements (CDEs).\n12\nNeuropsychological tests measure attention, working memory, processing speed, verbal fluency, and visuo-motor sequencing. LETBI investigators assess motor symptoms and functional independence, and patients provide self-reported measures of mood and function. A summary of these assessments is provided in\nTable 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nOverview of study design. The Late Effects of Traumatic Brain Injury (LETBI) study integrates\nin vivo\ndata (left) and\nex vivo\ndata (right) to comprehensively characterize post-traumatic neurodegeneration. LETBI participants undergo extensive cognitive, behavioral, and neurological examinations. In addition, structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are performed and blood samples are drawn for proteomic and genomic analysis to identify\nin vivo\nbiomarkers of post-traumatic neuropathology.

Remaining plasma and serum are isolated and banked for future planned studies. Blood processing and storage protocols are harmonized with those of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\u2013funded Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI study.\n13\n\nIn vivo\nMRI acquisition\nBrain MRI is performed within a week of cognitive and behavioral assessments. Patients at Mount Sinai are scanned using a Siemens Skyra (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) 3 Tesla (3T) MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil for signal reception. Patients at UW are scanned using a Philips Achieva 3T MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil. To facilitate pooling of MRI data from Mount Sinai and UW, we developed a harmonized protocol of high-resolution structural and functional sequences with only minor variances in the imaging parameters across sites (\nSupplementary Table 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). The LETBI\nin vivo\nMRI protocol includes T1 multi-echo Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo (MEMPRAGE) for volumetric analyses,\n14\nsusceptibility weighted imaging for detection of traumatic microhemorrhages,\n15\ndiffusion MRI for tractography-based structural connectivity analysis,\n16\n,\n17\nand resting state functional MRI for functional connectivity analysis.\n18\nSequence selection for LETBI was designed to maximize consistency with the NIH CDEs for TBI Neuroimaging.\n19\n,\n20\n\nIn vivo\nMRI processing and analysis\nIn vivo\nMEMPRAGE and diffusion MRI data undergo a series of Freesurfer-based processing procedures, as previously described.\n14\n,\n21\nMEMPRAGE data are used to generate cortical and subcortical morphometrics, while diffusion data are used to measure anisotropy and diffusivity in white matter tracts. Resting-state fMRI data are processed using independent component analysis\n22\nand seed-based analysis to measure functional network connectivity.\n23\nEach\nin vivo\ndataset is also assessed for pathoanatomic lesions, which are classified using the NIH CDEs for TBI Neuroimaging\n24\nand if applicable, NIH CDEs for Stroke Neuroimaging.\n25\nThese classification systems are similarly applied during the\nex vivo\nMRI lesion analysis, allowing correlation of the\nin vivo\nand\nex vivo\nlesion data. Importantly, a second analysis of the\nin vivo\nMRI data is performed for participants who come to autopsy and undergo\nex vivo\nMRI. The\nex vivo\nMRI data are co-registered to the\nin vivo\nMRI data (see below), providing an opportunity to assess the\nin vivo\nMRI signal properties at the precise spatial coordinates where the\nex vivo\nMRI lesions are identified. Specifically, the\nex vivo\nMRI data are used to identify lesions that escaped detection during the initial review of\nin vivo\nMRI data.\n\nLongitudinal follow-up\nAll participants in the LETBI project agree to brain donation, and participants are encouraged to discuss their wishes with family members and significant others. The study team provides participants and their families with information about brain donation, in addition to detailed instructions to follow in the event of death. The study team contacts participants every 6\u20139 months via telephone and sends holiday and birthday cards to maintain updated contact information.\n\nVerbal autopsy\nParticipants in the LETBI study are asked to provide contact information for at least two informants who know them well and who may be willing to participate in an interview in the event of death of the participant. The purpose of this postmortem interview is to gather information about the participant's cognitive, motor, emotional, and medical health in the year(s) prior to death. This information supplements data gathered through study visits and medical record review, including TBI exposure as ascertained by the Brain Injury Screening Questionnaire.\n26\n\nBrain specimen acquisition and neuropathological protocol\nFor specimens obtained at UW, a prosector obtains the brain specimen and a rapid autopsy, consisting of dissection of one hemisphere for \u223c60 flash frozen specimens, is performed in cases with postmortem interval (PMI) <8\u2009h. The remaining portion of the dissected hemisphere (or one intact hemisphere in non-rapid autopsies) is fixed in 10% formalin prior to undergoing comprehensive sampling and analysis for pathologic changes of AD, Lewy body disease, vascular disease, TBI, hippocampal sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and others according to ACT protocols aligned with the latest diagnostic guidelines.\n27\u201331\nIn selected fixed tissues, Histelide analysis is performed for quantitative, molecularly specific analyses of pathologic peptides including phospho-tau species (see below).\n32\n,\n33\nThe contralateral hemisphere from every case is fixed in 10% formalin and sent to BWH/MGH for gross pathological analysis and further fixation. For specimens obtained at Mount Sinai, whole brains are fixed in 10% formalin and sent to BWH/MGH for\nex vivo\nMRI. To ensure adequate fixation and to prevent specimen flattening (which can prevent specimens from fitting into custom\nex vivo\nMRI coils and can distort the MRI data), we implemented a series of standard procedures for optimal brain fixation and specimen processing, as detailed in the\nSupplementary Material\n.\n\nHistopathological analysis: Histelide\nThe steps involved in Histelide analysis are detailed elsewhere\n32\n,\n33\nand in the\nSupplementary Material Methods\n.\n\nEx vivo\nMRI acquisition\nEx vivo\nMRI is performed on selected autopsy brain specimens that meet the following\na priori\nselection criteria: 1) postmortem fixation interval (time from death to fixation of the specimen) <48\u2009h; 2) availability of comprehensive, prospectively acquired cognitive and behavioral data; and 3) availability of\nin vivo\nMRI data acquired prospectively with the LETBI protocol. Each\nex vivo\nMRI sequence was designed to provide complementary information about post-traumatic dementia pathology and to create opportunities to identify novel MRI biomarkers. Each\nex vivo\nMRI sequence also provides unique tissue contrast and signal characteristics that correspond to those of an\nin vivo\nMRI sequence, as shown in\nSupplementary Table 2\n.\nBrain specimens are first scanned on a 7T Siemens Magnetom MRI scanner using a custom-built head coil. The design, technical specifications, and signal-to-noise-ratio evaluations of the coil are detailed in the\nSupplementary Material Methods\n. For the 7T scan, we utilized a multi-echo FLASH (MEF) sequence\n34\nat 200\u2009\u03bcm spatial resolution. Total scan time on the 7T MRI scanner is 18\u2009h and 31\u2009min. Next, specimens are scanned on a 3T Siemens Tim Trio MRI scanner for 41\u2009h and 45\u2009min using a 32-channel head coil. MEF data are also collected at 3T at 1\u2009mm spatial resolution for generating surface reconstructions. Diffusion data are acquired using a 3D diffusion-weighted steady-state free-precession sequence\n35\nat 750\u2009\u03bcm spatial resolution. Total diffusion scan time is 30\u2009h and 31\u2009min. Parameters for all 7T and 3T\nex vivo\nsequences are detailed in\nSupplementary Table 3\n.\n\nEx vivo MRI processing and analysis\nMEF data acquired on the 7T and 3T MRI scanners undergo a series of processing steps, including creation of parameter maps. Parameter maps include proton density and T1 and T2* decay times. These are estimated directly from the MEF acquisitions using the DESPOT1 algorithm\n34\n,\n36\nto quantify the tissue properties independent of the scanner and sequence types. We use our surface-based registration and segmentation tool FreeSurfer\n37\n,\n38\nto reconstruct models of the gray/white and pial surfaces for morphometric analysis of the 3T MEF data. Upon completion of data processing, each 7T and 3T MEF dataset is assessed for data quality based upon a visual assessment of anatomic landmarks. If the data are deemed to be of sufficient quality, the MEF datasets are then analyzed by LETBI investigators for pathoanatomic lesions in two phases.\nIn the first phase of\nex vivo\nMRI data analysis, the 7T and 3T MEF datasets are assessed for pathoanatomic lesions that can be classified using the NIH CDE Guidelines for TBI and Stroke Neuroimaging.\n19\n,\n25\nIn the second phase, we assess for pathoanatomic lesions that are not currently accounted for by the NIH CDE criteria, which were generated for\nin vivo\nMRI lesion characterization. In this second phase, lesions identified on the 7T and 3T MEF datasets are classified based upon their signal characteristics, neuroanatomic location, and morphology.\nDiffusion data acquired on the 3T MRI scanner are processed for deterministic tract construction using Diffusion Toolkit and analyzed for connectivity using TrackVis (\nwww.trackvis.org\n), as previously described.\n39\nAll major association, projection, and commissural white matter bundles in the cerebral hemispheres are analyzed for structural connectivity using the region of interest (ROI) approach described in Catani and de Schotten's tractography atlas.\n40\nIn addition to the white matter bundles described in this atlas, thalamocortical tracts are identified using a single-ROI approach\n41\nand brainstem arousal pathways are identified using a multi-ROI approach.\n42\n,\n43\nAll tract bundles are inspected for hemispheric asymmetry and/or focal disruptions, compared with a cohort of control brain specimens from patients who died of non-neurological diseases and had no known history of trauma. In addition, any lesion identified during the\nex vivo\nMRI lesion analysis is used as a seed for the generation of fiber tracts. Using this seed-based lesional approach, the pathophysiological impact of each lesion on its associated white matter pathways is defined.\nEx vivo\nMRI acquisition and processing methods are identical for control and TBI specimens.\nIn summary, the\nex vivo\nMRI analyses provide four sets of data that are subsequently correlated with histopathological and\nin vivo\nMRI data: 1) NIH CDE-based lesion analysis of 7T and 3T MEF data; 2) analysis of lesions detected by 7T and 3T MEF data that are not currently accounted for by the NIH CDEs; 3) 3T diffusion tractography analysis of white matter disruption via screening of all major white matter bundles; and 4) 3T diffusion tractography analysis of white matter disruption related to focal lesions.\n\nCo-registration of\nin vivo\nand\nex vivo\nMRI data\nWe used the combined volume- and surface-based registration (CVS) framework\n44\nto spatially register the corresponding\nin vivo\nand\nex vivo\nMRI datasets. CVS is a pair-wise registration method that has been shown to optimize the alignment of both cortical and subcortical areas in brain volumetric MRI. Additional details are provided in the\nSupplementary Material Methods\n.\n\nMRI-guided brain cutting, imaging-pathology procedures, whole\u2013mount immunohistopathology\nFollowing\nex vivo\nMRI of fixed hemibrain and whole brain specimens, ACT brains are shipped from MGH/BWH to the UW Neuropathology and Targeted Molecular Testing Core, and TBIMS/TBI-Health brains are shipped to the Brain Tissue Repository and Neuropathology Core of the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine, at Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, MD.\n45\nSlabs are selected at both institutions (see below) for whole\u2013mount sectioning, neuropathologic assessment using routine morphologic stains, immunohistochemistry, histochemistry for myelin and iron, and image digitalization of the resultant slides. Each specimen is sectioned into three parts: the cerebral hemisphere(s), brainstem, and cerebellum. The hemisphere specimens are sectioned coronally and photographed to obtain an overview of brain structures within hemisphere(s) in both projections: rostral (frontal) and caudal (occipital). Slabs are then selected for whole\u2013mount analysis during a consensus video teleconference in which the neuropathology team and imaging team compare cortical and subcortical anatomic landmarks on the coronal slabs with corresponding landmarks on the\nex vivo\nMRI datasets. Based on this landmark comparison, the precise neuroanatomic coordinates of each lesion identified on\nex vivo\nMRI is used to guide the selection of the corresponding coronal slab.\nCoronal slabs are embedded in oversized paraffin blocks and serially sectioned at 50\u2009\u03bcm thickness. For ACT cases, unselected slabs undergo routine neuropathological analysis to maintain continuity of neuropathological data for the ACT study. For slabs selected for whole\u2013mount analysis, the level of sectioning within each block is guided by identification of lesions on\nex vivo\nMRI acquisition. With an interval of 200 sections (1\u2009cm), we cut 10 serial sections at 10 microns thick to be stained for hematoxylin and eosin (H/E), Luxol-fast Blue (LFB), Perls' stain (iron), hyperphosphorylated-tau (pTau; AT8), phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein (p\u03b1-syn), amyloid precursor protein (APP), 1\u201342 \u03b2-amyloid (4G8), phosphorylated-TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (pTDP-43), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and activated microglia (CD68 and iba-1). When indicated, we obtain \u223c20 levels through the entire hemisphere to survey the full distribution of pathology. The separated brainstem specimen is sectioned in the axial plane to obtain four tissue blocks. Each block is then embedded, serially sectioned and stained as described previously\n42\nor saved for future analyses. The cerebellum is saved for future analysis.\n\nConsensus conferences for validation of neuropathology and imaging biomarkers\nWe use VS NIS-SQL software to allow real-time on-line simultaneous viewing of scanned whole-mount slides at each study site. Conference goals are to correlate neuropathological findings with study records, clinical data,\nin vivo\nMRI and\nex vivo\nMRI. Digitized slides are also viewed and discussed in this forum. This is an opportunity to regularly assemble an expert panel to consider histopathologic and other end-points to achieve meaningful associations and identify effective diagnostic approaches."

    "Methods": "Animals\nExperiments were conducted using protocols in accordance with the Virginia Commonwealth University institutional ethical guidelines concerning the care and use of laboratory animals (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Virginia Commonwealth University), which adhere to regulations including but not limited to those set forth in the\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th Edition\n(National Research Council). Animals were housed in individual cages on a 12\u2009h light-dark cycle with free access to food and water. Forty-four adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 350\u2013450\u2009g were used for this study. Any animal that lost more than 20% of their pre-injury body weight or precipitated gross brain pathology (contusion, subdural hematoma, or gross tissue loss) was excluded from analysis. No animals met exclusion criteria in this study. Animals were euthanized and histologically evaluated at 1.5\u2009h (\nn\n=\u20092), 3\u2009h (\nn\n=\u20092), 6\u2009h (\nn\n=\u20099), 1 day (\nn\n=\u20097), 2 days (\nn\n=\u20091), 1 week (\nn\n=\u20098), 4 weeks (\nn\n=\u20098), or 8 weeks (\nn\n=\u20097) post-injury.\n\nSurgical preparation and injury induction\nAnimals were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in 30% O\n2\nand 70% N\n2\nO then intubated and ventilated with 2% isoflurane in 30% O\n2\nand 70% N\n2\nO throughout the duration of the surgery. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C with a rectal thermometer connected to a feedback-controlled heating pad (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). A midline incision was made between bregma and lambda and a 4.8\u2009mm circular craniotomy was made along the sagittal suture midway between bregma and lambda for injury induction. The procedures used to induce CFPI were consistent with those previously described.\n4\n,\n25\nBriefly, a Leur-Loc syringe hub was affixed to the craniotomy site and dental acrylic (methyl-methacrylate; Hygenic Corp., Akron, OH) was applied around the hub and allowed to harden. Animals were removed from the stereotaxic frame and injured at a magnitude of 2.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.15 atmospheres. The pressure pulse was measured by a transducer affixed to the injury device and displayed on an oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Immediately after the injury, the animal was reconnected to the ventilator and physiologic monitoring device and the hub and dental acrylic were removed\nen bloc.\nGelfoam was placed over the craniotomy/injury site and the scalp was sutured. The animals were then allowed to recover and were returned to clean home cages. Identical surgical procedures were followed for sham-injured animals, without release of the pendulum to induce injury.\n\nTissue processing\nAt appropriate time-points between 1.5\u2009h and 8 weeks post-injury, the animals were injected with 150\u2009mg/kg euthasol, then underwent transcardial perfusion with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde/ 0.2% gluteraldehyde in Millonig's buffer (136\u2009mM sodium phosphate monobasic/109\u2009mM sodium hydroxide) for immunohistochemical or electron microscopic (EM) processing and analysis. After transcardial perfusion, the brains were removed, post-fixed for 24\u2009h, then sectioned coronally in 0.1\u2009mol/L phosphate buffer with a vibratome (Leica, Banockburn, IL) at a thickness of 40\u2009\u03bcm from bregma to \u223c4.0\u2009mm posterior to bregma. Sections were collected serially in 12 well-plates and stored in Millonig's buffer at 4\u00b0C.\n\nFluorescent immunohistochemistry\nTissue slices were triple labeled with Trpm4, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1). Triple-labeled samples were prepared by blocking tissue in 5% normal horse serum (NHS)/1.5% triton-X for 1\u2009h, then incubating with goat anti Trpm4 (1:200) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Tissue was then incubated with donkey anti-goat Alexa 568 (1:700; Cat.# A11057; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The tissue was then re-blocked with 5% NHS, incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with rabbit anti Iba-1 (1:1500; Cat.# 19-19741; Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA) and Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated mouse anti GFAP (1:1000; Cat.#MAB3402X; EMD Millipore Corp., Temecula, CA) then incubated with Alexa Fluor 633 conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:700; Cat.# A21082; Life Technologies). All labeled tissue was mounted using Vectashield hardset mounting medium with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Cat. # H-1500; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).\n\nAssessment of Trpm4 expression and cell surface area via confocal microscopy\nTo evaluate Trpm4 expression, tissue triple-labeled for Trpm4 (Alexa-568 secondary), GFAP (Alexa-488 secondary), and Iba-1 (Alexa 647 secondary) was visualized on a Zeiss LSM 710 system (Carol Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To determine the total percent of Trpm4+ cells that co-labeled with either GFAP or Iba-1, sequentially scanned confocal micrographs were taken using the 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009objective (four micrographs/regions of interest [ROIs] for each section; two sections assessed for each animal [sham,\nn\n=\u20094; 6\u2009h,\nn\n=\u20093; 1 day,\nn\n=\u20092; 1 week,\nn\n=\u20093; 4 weeks,\nn\n=\u20093; and 8 weeks,\nn\n=\u20093]). The total number of Trpm4+ cells colocalized with either GFAP or Iba-1 using the colocalization finder plugin for FIJI software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) were counted by eye.\nTo evaluate the number of Trpm4+ cells, tiled images of the right and left hippocampus from the same sections assessed above (two sections per animal) were generated and the total number of Trpm4+ cells within the hippocampal fissure or gray matter of the hippocampus were counted by two independent investigators using FIJI software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All investigators were blinded to animal group throughout both image acquisition and analysis. The area of the hippocampal fissure and gray matter were calculated using FIJI. Data was expressed as number of Trpm4+ astrocytes/100\u2009\u03bcm\n2\n.\nFor additional assessment of the Trpm4+ population, the same tiled confocal micrographs were used. The background was subtracted and images were thresholded in FIJI to allow individual Trpm4+ cells to be added to the ROI manager for intensity/expression assessment of individual Trpm4+ cells using the original confocal images. Intensity/expression of Trpm4 was assessed using corrected total cell fluorescence on every individual cell within one systematically random section per animal.\n26\nThe integrated density of each Trpm4+ cell within either the hippocampal fissure or gray matter was calculated and corrected for background labeling, using the following formula: background corrected total cell fluorescence\u2009=\u2009individual Trpm4+ cell Integrated density-(area of the Trpm4+ cell\u2009\u00d7\u2009average mean gray value of section background). The surface area and the mean gray value of each individual Trpm4+ cell also were assessed in FIJI.\n\nPreparation of tissue for light microscopy\nIn preparation for light and electron microscopic (EM) analysis, tissue was labeled with goat anti-Trpm4 (1:200; Cat.# sc-27540; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX) using heat-induced epitope retrieval. Briefly, tissue slices were placed in 0.1M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and microwaved at 650 W to a temperature of 45\u00b0C. Tissue slices were then blocked with 5% NHS, followed by incubation with biotinylated rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulin G (1:1000; Cat. #BA-5000; Vector Laboratories) secondary antibody. Sections were then incubated in avidin biotinylated enzyme complex using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) followed by visualization with 0.05% diaminobenzidine/0.01% hydrogen peroxide/ 0.3% imidazole (DAB) in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer. The tissue was then either mounted, dehydrated and cover-slipped for light microscopy, or processed for EM analysis. Light micrographs were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an Olympus DP71 camera (Olympus, Center Valley, PA) and qualitatively assessed for Trpm4 expression (\nn\n=\u20092 animals for each time-point).\n\nEvaluation of cell damage/death\nTo evaluate numbers of damaged/dead cells following injury, two sequential randomly selected, sections per animal (sham,\nn\n=\u20097; 6\u2009h,\nn\n=\u20095; 1 day,\nn\n=\u20095; 1 week,\nn\n=\u20094; 2 weeks,\nn\n=\u20094; 4 weeks,\nn\n=\u20094 animals) were stained with H&E and assessed as described previously.\n27\nBriefly, tissue was mounted on gelatin-coated slides before dehydration and rehydration. Rehydrated tissue was incubated in Gills hematoxylin (Leica Biosystems) followed by bluing agent (Leica Biosystems) and three dips in 0.25% eosin Y/0.005% acetic acid/95% ethanol before sections were cleared through increasing concentrations of ethanol and cover-slipped with Permount (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Sections were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope. Assessments were done for both sides of the hippocampus. The number of damaged neurons, delineated by eosinophilic cytoplasm and condensed nuclei, was counted by an investigator blind to the animal group and expressed as the number of damaged cells/100\u2009um\n2\n.\n\nElectron microscopy and ultrastructural analysis\nTissue to be used for EM analysis was labeled against Trpm4 using DAB, as described in the \u201c\nPreparation of tissue for light microscopy\n\u201d section, osmicated, dehydrated, and embedded in epoxy resin on plastic slides. After resin curing, areas of interest were identified using light microscopy. These areas were removed, mounted on plastic studs, and 70-nm sections were cut and mounted on Formvar-coated slotted grids. The grids were stained in 5% uranyl acetate in 50% methanol and 0.5% lead citrate. Electron micrographs were imaged using a JEOL JEM 1230 transmission electron microscope equipped with Ultrascan 400SP CCD and Orius SC1000 CCD cameras (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA). All electron micrographs were evaluated for ultrastructural pathology consistent with cellular damage, including mitochondrial change, vesicular swelling, pyknosis, or peripheral lucent zones. Electron micrographs of Trpm4+ (\nn\n=\u2009110) and Trpm4- (\nn\n=\u200957) astrocytes also were assessed for soma size with FIJI software using the following formula: soma size\u2009=\u2009total soma area - area of nucleus.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were tested for normality prior to utilizing parametric or non-parametric assessments. Animal number for each group was determined by an\na priori\npower analysis using effect size and variability previously observed in the lab when assessing pathology between either sham and injured groups (\nn\n\u2265\u20092 shams at each time-point) or two different injured populations (\nn\n\u2265\u20094 injured at each time-point) using the CFPI model, an alpha\u2009=\u20090.05, and a power of 80%. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni\npost hoc\ntest were performed for all between group histological analyses. Two-way ANOVA was used to evaluate significant interactions between injury and time. Spearman's rho test was used for correlation assessments. Statistical significance was set to\np\n<\u20090.05. Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nWe enrolled 499 patients with moderate-to-severe TBI in the Magnesium Sulfate Study from 1998 to 2004. Inclusion criteria included Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score upon presentation in the emergency department of 3 to 12 or intracranial surgery (e.g., craniectomy, craniotomy, or elevation of a depressed fracture with dural repair) within 8\u2009h of injury. Subjects were excluded if they were <14 years old, could not receive the study drug within 8\u2009h of injury, had serum creatinine concentrations >177\u2009\u03bcmol/L, were pregnant, were prisoners, or were known to live overseas.\n18\nParticipants were assessed with the FSE at 3 and 6 months after the injury. For this study, we analyzed data of 448 subjects with FSE assessment at 6 months; 405 significant others (SO) also participated in the study. Reasons for loss of subjects included inability to contact (\nn\n=\u200929; 5.8% of original sample), refusal to participate (\nn\n=\u20099; 1.8% of sample) and other (\nn\n=\u200913; 2.6% of sample), representing a follow-up rate of 89.7% overall. Results from the clinical trial found no positive effect of magnesium sulfate on the FSE, but a negative effect was reported on the lower target range group (1.0\u20131.85\u2009mmol/L).\n18\n\nMeasures\nSeverity of brain injury\nThe severity of the TBI was assessed by time from injury to follow simple commands (TFC) and by the GCS motor score. TFC is a measure of coma duration and is defined as the time from injury to the ability to follow simple commands consistently.\n19\nThe GCS motor score was assessed post-resuscitation in the ED and represents depth of coma.\n20\nNeuropsychological measures\nNeuropsychological data included total recall on the Selective Reminding Test\n21\n(a test of episodic memory and learning), and the WAIS III Processing Speed Index,\n22\nwhich were administered at 6-months post-injury. The latter is a measure of information processing speed and is calculated from the Digit Symbol and Symbol Search subtests of the WAIS III.\nFunctional status measures\nThe FSE\n17\nmeasures change in functional status specifically due to traumatic injury, including both the changes associated with TBI and peripheral injuries. This measure takes approximately 10\u2009min to administer and covers seven areas of functioning: personal care, ambulation, mobility, major activity (work or school), homemaking, leisure and recreation, and social integration. The original FSE included three other areas of functioning (cognitive competency, standard of living, and financial independence) that were removed due to poor fit with the rest of the measure. Functional areas are evaluated using the concept of dependency to operationally define outcome at four levels: 0\u2009=\u2009no change from pre-injury; 1\u2009=\u2009difficulty in performing the activity although the person is still independent; 2\u2009=\u2009dependence on others some of the time; and 3\u2009=\u2009nonperformance, inability to perform the activity, or total dependence on others. A total score is generated by summing scores from the seven categories, yielding a range from 0 (return to pre-injury baseline in all areas) to 21 (total dependence on others or can no longer perform any activities across functional areas). Persons who die are assigned a total score of 22.\nParticipants who are not yet back to normal in a functional area also are asked how bothered they are by: 1) the difficulty they are experiencing, and/or 2) degree of dependency they have on others. The bothersome score for each area is rated on a 4-point scale: 0\u2009=\u2009not at all bothered, 1\u2009=\u2009mildly bothered, 2\u2009=\u2009moderately bothered, and 3\u2009=\u2009severely bothered. The total bothersome score is the sum of all ratings. Subjects who are back to normal in a functional area are assigned a bothersome score of 0 when calculating the total bothersome score. The most informed person (patient or proxy) completed the FSE at 3 months post-injury (331 were participants with TBI and 111 were SOs). At 6 months post-injury, the FSE was completed by the patient and the SO separately.\nThe GOSE\n3\nis the extended version of the GOS, a widely used measure of outcome following TBI. The revised version increased the number of outcome categories from five to eight to improve its sensitivity to outcome and to improve its reliability. The patient is classified on an eight-category scale ranging from death to upper good recovery. This measure was administered at 6 months post-injury to the participant with TBI or the person with the most knowledge about the TBI subject if the person was unable to report for themselves.\nThe European Quality of Life Checklist (EuroQol)\n23\nis a measure of current health status in five areas: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The TBI subject rated his or her health status at 6 months post-injury.\nThe Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)\n24\nis a general health measure and is designed for use in clinical practice, research, health policy evaluations, and general population surveys. It includes multi-item scales that assess limitations in physical activities, social activities, usual role activities, bodily pain, general mental health, vitality, and general health perceptions. Two aggregate scores are calculated: the Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component Summary. This measure was administered at 6 months post-injury to the person with TBI.\nMeasures of emotional functioning\nThe Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI)\n25\nis an abbreviated form of the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90), a widely used measure of emotional functioning. It contains 53 items rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 for \u201cnot at all\u201d to 4 for \u201cextremely.\u201d Two overall indices of distress were calculated: the Global Severity Index and the Positive Symptoms Distress Index.\nThe Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D)\n26\nis a measure of depressive symptoms. It consists of 20 items that are rated on a 4-point scale to indicate the frequency of depressive symptoms experienced over the past week.\nThe symptom checklist\n27\n,\n28\nwas administered to the participants with TBI and consists of 12 symptoms that are frequently reported in the literature as sequelae of TBI (e.g., headaches, fatigue, memory difficulty, irritability). Symptoms are rated as present if they are of new onset since the TBI or are worse than they were before the injury; the total number of new or worsened symptoms is calculated.\nPercent back to normal\n29\nis a self-report rating scale used to assess the degree to which the person feels they have returned to normal. The person with TBI chooses a number from 0 (0% back to normal) to 100% returned to the way they were before the injury.\nAn estimate of current happiness also was obtained by asking participants to rate their happiness by choosing a number from 0 (not at all happy) to 100 (extremely happy).\n30\nMeasures of emotional functioning, current happiness, the symptom checklist, and percent back to normal ratings were obtained at 6 months post-injury.\n\nStatistical analysis\nUnless otherwise specified, the data analysis described below used the total FSE score obtained from the participant with TBI. If that was missing, the SO score was used (\nn\n=\u200969) at 6 months post injury. Data were analyzed using non-parametric methods due to the skewness caused by inclusion of the large number of those who died (\nn\n=\u2009105).\nSensitivity\nWe examined the sensitivity of the FSE by assessing its relationship to brain injury severity indices using Spearman's rank correlation, Kruskal-Wallis analysis and the Mann-Whitney test. TFC was classified into four groups (< 24\u2009h, 1 to 6 days, 7 to 28 days and \u226529 days) and GCS motor score formed two groups (\u2264 4 and \u22655). TBI subjects who expired before following commands consistently were placed in the \u226529 day group.\nResponsivity\nResponsivity was evaluated by examining change from 3 to 6 months post-injury on the FSE. Change was examined descriptively with and without the exclusion of expired subjects and formally tested using Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Both indices of absolute change and meaningful change were examined. We defined meaningful change as a difference of \u22654 points between the two time periods. Change scores that fell between \u22123 and 3 were counted as representing no change in the analysis of meaningful change. Change also was presented in relation to brain injury severity indices.\nValidity\nConvergent validity was assessed by comparing the FSE with other measures thought to assess similar constructs using Spearman's rank correlation. These measures were the GOSE, the SF-36, the EuroQol, and the neuropsychological measures. Participants who were too impaired neurologically to be assessed on the neuropsychological measures were assigned a score equal to 1 point worse than the worst observed score. Expired subjects were assigned a score of 2 points worse than the worst observed score. Correlations between the FSE and SF-36 or EuroQol were calculated with patient responses only. Correlations between the FSE and the GOSE and between the FSE and neuropsychological measures were calculated with and without the inclusion of expired subjects.\nTo evaluate discriminant validity, or measures expected to have less of a relationship, Spearman's rank correlation compared the FSE with emotional health, post-traumatic symptoms, and percent back to normal rating. These correlations were calculated with patient responses only.\nPatient and SO concordance\nFor pairs that completed the FSE independently, the level of the scores (bias) was evaluated by a paired\nt\ntest and the association between patients' and SOs' assessment of functioning on the FSE was evaluated via Spearman's rank correlation. Patient and SO median total FSE scores also were examined descriptively in relationship to brain injury severity indices.\nBothersome rating\nThe total bothersome score was compared with the total FSE score and with an index of current happiness, percent back to normal rating, and brain injury severity indices using Spearman's rank correlation. TFC groups also were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis Test and GCS motor groups were examined with Mann-Whitney analysis."
