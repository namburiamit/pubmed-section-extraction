    "Methods": "Animals\nAll procedures were conducted on male Swiss\u2013Webster mice (4\u20136 weeks of age) derived from breeders purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA). Mice in cohort 1 (\nFig. 1A\n) were bred at the Ohio State University (OSU) and cohort 2 (\nFig. 1B\n) was bred at West Virginia University (WVU). Pups were weaned at 21 days of age into a standard mouse cage with\nad libitum\naccess to food and filtered tap water. Animals at OSU were housed in a 14:10 light\u2013dark cycle and animals at WVU were housed in a 12:12 light-dark cycle. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at OSU and WVU.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental timeline. Mice underwent a controlled cortical impact (CCI) or sham/cr (craniectomy only).\n(A)\nMice in cohort 1 were assessed for cognitive recovery and anxiety-like behaviors after 10 days of treadmill training (excluding weekends). Brain tissue was collected for histological assessment following elevated plus maze (EPM) and Barnes maze behavioral analysis.\n(B)\nMice in cohort 2 were injected with 50\u2009mg/kg (i.p.) bromodeoxyuridine / 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) on days 1 and 2 following CCI or sham/cr, and brain tissue was collected for histological assessment following treadmill training.\n(C)\nTreadmill training speed and duration.\n\nTBI\nTBI was induced via a CCI model using an established protocol.\n34\nBriefly, mice were anesthetized via inhaled isoflurane (3% in oxygen) and secured into a stereotaxic frame equipped with a heating pad (Stoelting). Their skulls were exposed and a 4\u2009mm craniectomy was performed over the left parietal bone. A 3\u2009mm plunger was retracted and accelerated into the brain causing a 1.2\u2009mm deformation at a velocity of 5\u2009m/sec with a dwell time of 200\u2009msec. The control group (sham/cr) consisted of mice that received a craniectomy; however, the plunger was then gently lowered to the surface of the brain and immediately retracted. After CCI or sham/cr, the incision was sutured with 6/0 nylon suture and mice were replaced into their home cages. All mice were treated subcutaneously with bupivacaine (1\u2009mg/kg) and meloxicam (5\u2009mg/kg) for analgesia, and monitored daily post-operatively. A total of nine mice were euthanized post-operatively because of insufficient recovery (i.e., they demonstrated lethargy, dehydration, or pain not significantly improved by analgesic treatment) by day 2 after injury.\n\nForced exercise paradigm\nAll mice were acclimated to a three-lane stationary treadmill (Columbus Instruments) at a speed of 6\u2009m/min for 3 consecutive days (10\u2009min/day). Acclimation was performed prior to injury to avoid acute injury-induced variation in ability to perform the novel task.\n23\nBeginning 72\u2009h after CCI or sham/cr, mice were randomly assigned to one of three exercise conditions (sedentary, low intensity, or moderate intensity) for 10 days (excluding the weekend) at 30\u2009min/day. All acclimation and exercise conditions were performed at a 0 degree incline, and no negative stimuli (i.e., electric shock) were used in this exercise paradigm. Low and moderate intensity treadmill exercise conditions were adapted from previously published reports\n29\n,\n35\n(see\nFig. 1C\nfor specific training conditions), mice in sedentary conditions were also placed on the treadmill for 30\u2009min daily but the treadmill was not turned on. Two mice were removed from the study because of an inability to perform the full treadmill paradigm. The following groups were formed for two cohorts (cohort 1 was used for behavioral analysis and histology, cohort 2 was used for bromodeoxyuridine / 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine [BrdU] labeling of newborn neurons): sham/cr sedentary (cohort 1\nn\n=\u20098, cohort 2\nn\n=\u20098), sham/cr low intensity (cohort 1\nn\n=\u20098, cohort 2\nn\n=\u20098), sham/cr moderate intensity (cohort 1\nn\n=\u20097, cohort 2\nn\n=\u20099), CCI sedentary (cohort 1\nn\n=\u20098, cohort 2\nn\n=\u20097), CCI low intensity (cohort 1\nn\n=\u20097, cohort 2\nn\n=\u20097), and CCI moderate intensity (cohort 1\nn\n=\u20097, cohort 2\nn\n=\u20098).\n\nElevated plus maze (EPM)\nAnxiety-like behavior was measured in cohort 1 17 days post-injury (dpi) (\nFig. 1A\n) on an EPM according to an established protocol.\n36\nBriefly, mice were placed in the center of a plus-shaped maze elevated 50\u2009cm off the floor and consisting of two \u201copen\u201d arms and two \u201cclosed\u201d arms. All arms were 50\u2009cm long and 10\u2009cm wide. The closed arms were enclosed with 40\u2009cm high walls. Mice were recorded on the EPM for 5\u2009min by a blinded observer, and videos were analyzed using ANY-maze (Stoelting) for number of entries into each arm and path length. The maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol after each trial. Decreased activity in the open arms is indicative of anxiety-like behavior.\n\nBarnes maze\nSpatial learning and memory performance were measured in cohort 1 18\u201323\u2009dpi (\nFig. 1A\n) by a blinded observer on the Barnes maze as previously reported.\n37\nBriefly, the maze (Stoelting) consists of a 91\u2009cm diameter circular arena with 18 holes around the perimeter, with one hole leading to a dark escape box (target hole). Over a 5-day training period, mice underwent three trials/day during which they were individually placed onto the center of the maze, and video recorded for up to 120\u2009sec/trial. Latency to find the target hole was recorded for each trial daily. On the 6th day, the escape box was removed and mice were placed on the maze for 90\u2009sec for the probe trial. The probe trial assessed time spent in the quadrant that formerly contained the target. Behavioral assessment was performed using ANY-maze (Stoelting). The maze and escape box were cleaned with 70% ethanol after each trial.\n\nBrdU administration\nIn order to label newly generated cells, mice in cohort 2 (\nFig. 1B\n) were injected intraperiotoneally (i.p.) with BrdU (50\u2009mg/kg in saline, Sigma Aldrich).\n38\nAll mice were injected twice daily, 6\u2009h apart, on 1 and 2\u2009dpi. The timing of the injections allowed for labeling of cells that were generated after the injury, but before the start of the exercise protocol, in order to assess the effect of exercise intensity on the survival of newborn cells.\n\nTissue processing and immunohistochemistry\nBrain tissue fixation was performed following an overdose with sodium pentobarbital (200\u2009mg/kg i.p.) and transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. Mice in cohort 1 were euthanized 24\u2009dpi and mice in cohort 2 were euthanized 15\u2009dpi. Forty-micron sections were sliced coronally on a cryostat throughout the forebrain. Free-floating immunohistochemistry was performed for microglia (Iba1, Wako) and proliferating cells (Ki67, Abcam). Tissue was washed with 0.1M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), blocked with 10% normal goat serum (NGS), and incubated overnight with rabbit anti-Ki67 antibody (1:2000) or rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:1000) at room temperature. The following day, tissue was incubated in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 2\u2009h, and the staining was visualized using the diaminobenzidine protocol (Vector Laboratories). Ki67-positive cells were counted in the ipsilateral and contralateral subgranular zone (SGZ). The SGZ of both upper and lower blades of the dentate gyrus were assessed in three dorsal hippocampal sections (approximate coordinates: -1.70\u2009mm to -2.18\u2009mm from Bregma). Ki67-positive cell counts are reported as the average of three counts per hemisphere. For microglial analysis, bilateral images were taken lateral to the cornu ammonis (CA)2/CA3 region of the hippocampus (bordering the site of direct cortical damage approximately between -1.70 and -2.18\u2009mm from Bregma). Iba1-positive microglia were assessed in a 0.043mm\n2\nregion of interest (ROI) superimposed over a 10x image of the peri-lesional cortex, hippocampus CA1, or dentate gyrus in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres using FIJI software.\n39\nThe activation state of Iba-1 positive microglia within the ROI was assessed qualitatively based on morphological characteristics (ramified: small cell body and thin/long processes, or activated: enlarged or amoeboid cell body with shortened/thick processes). Results were averaged within each group, and data are reported as percent ramified or activated.\nDouble immunofluorescence staining for BrdU/doublecortin (DCX) was also performed on free-floating tissue. Tissue was washed with 0.1\u2009M PBS, blocked with 10% normal horse serum, and incubated overnight with goat anti-DCX (Santa Cruz, 1:500) antibody at room temperature. The following day, tissue was incubated in donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (AlexaFluor 594) for 2\u2009h, incubated with 2N HCl at 37\u00b0C for 1\u2009h and 0.05M boric acid for 10\u2009min, blocked with 10% NGS, and incubated overnight with rat anti-BrdU (1:200) at room temperature. On the 3rd day, tissue was incubated in goat anti-rat secondary antibody (AlexaFluor 488). BrdU- and DCX-positive cells were counted bilaterally in the SGZ and granular zone of the dentate gyrus in three dorsal hippocampal sections using the same coordinates as described. Data are reported as the average of three counts per hemisphere, as well as percent BrdU-cells that co-express DCX.\n\nAxon degeneration\nAxon degeneration was assessed using a commercial silver staining kit (FD NeuroTechnologies) according to manufacturer's instructions. Damaged axons were qualitatively assessed using an adapted version of a previously reported method (0\u2009=\u2009few silver stained axons, 3\u2009=\u2009dense axonal degeneration throughout white matter tracts).\n37\n\nCresyl violet staining\nLesion volume was assessed via cresyl violet staining. Cryosections were mounted onto glass slides and hydrated in graded ethanol washes (100%, 95%, 70%). Tissue was then incubated for 3\u2009min in 0.1% cresyl violet and destained in 95% ethanol containing glacial acetic acid. Tissue was then dehydrated, dipped in xylene, and cover-slipped with Permount. Cortical lesion volume was calculated by outlining the cortex on the ipsilateral and contralateral sides of every 10th slice in the forebrain. A total of six sections (400\u2009\u03bcm apart) were assessed within a pre-defined region (Bregma -1.06\u2009mm and -2.92\u2009mm). Percent lesion volume was calculated using the following formula: [(contralateral cortex volume \u2013 ipsilateral cortex volume)/contralateral cortex volume]\u2009\u00d7\u2009100.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS Version 26 (IBM Corp.) Immunohistochemistry, EPM, Barnes maze probe, and lesion volume were assessed via analysis of variance (ANOVA) (injury\u2009\u00d7\u2009activity). Barnes maze learning trials were assessed via repeated measures ANOVA (injury\u2009\u00d7\u2009activity). All significant main effects were followed up by a least significant differences post-hoc analysis. Qualitative axon damage data were analyzed via the non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nAt the beginning of each sports season, Northwestern University female club athletes were approached and asked to fill out an online screening form, which collects demographic information and self-report of MC start dates for the previous three cycles. Subsequently, injured athletes were identified by the university's athletics department and referred to the study team for study enrollment. Athletes provided written informed consent in compliance with guidelines of the university's internal review board. Study visits were divided into 2 days, when study assessments included: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS),\n54\nPost-Concussive Symptom Scale (PCSS),\n55\nand the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II).\n56\nWe further assessed caffeine consumption as well as alcohol and cannabis use for the past 30 days using the timeline followback (TLFB) method.\n57\nBriefly, the TLFB method is an online, calendar-guided questionnaire that collects self-reported substance use for the past 30 days. It has been shown to be highly reliable.\n58\u201360\nFor this study, we further adapted it to the evaluation of menstrual cycle, as has been done by others for neuroimaging studies.\n47\u201349\n,\n61\nThese assessments were collected on Day 1, and blood sampling and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were completed on Day 2. Study visits were scheduled within 3\u201310 days post-injury. Sixteen injured athletes were identified and recruited for this study, but only 15 of them completed the MRI data collection because one subject declined MRI.\nSixteen control subjects were recruited from non-collision sports teams and matched based on age, ethnicity, handedness, and contraceptive use/type. For MC matching purposes,\n62\nall subjects were divided into three groups: (1) non-HC users with regular MCs, (2) non-HC users with irregular MCs and (3) HC users. For non-HC users, days 1\u20137 of MC were estimated as the follicular phase, and days 20 or higher were estimated as the luteal phase. Based on the 3-month TLFB (MC tracking self-report), we scheduled the matched control subjects to be studied during the same MC phase as the mTBI athlete was scanned. For example, if the mTBI athlete was scanned during the follicular phase, the matched control was scheduled during days 1\u20137 of her MC. Users of HC such as oral contraceptives or NuvaRing do not have normal MC, as their hormone levels are suppressed; therefore, their cycles were divided into\nactive\nand\ninactive\nphases, depending on whether they were on the active hormone pills or with NuvaRing inserted, or on placebo pills or with NuvaRing not inserted. Control subjects were scheduled within 2 days of the matched mTBI athlete's pill pack or NuvaRing day. All athletes on contraceptives were on synthetic hormones, as this is the only form of contraceptive that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use within the United States.\n\nMRI acquisition\nImaging data were acquired on a 3.0T whole body Siemens Prisma scanner (Erlangen, Germany), using a 64-channel head/neck receive-only coil. High resolution, T1-weighted anatomical images were collected using three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (3D-MPRAGE) with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)/inversion time (TI)/flip angle (FA)\u2009=\u20092300\u2009ms/2.94\u2009ms/900\u2009ms/9 degrees; 176 sagittal slices; 1\u2009mm isotropic resolution; parallel aquisistion techniques (iPAT) acceleration factor\u2009=\u20092; iPAT reference lines\u2009=\u200938 (total duration\u2009=\u20095\u2009min 37\u2009sec). ASL data were collected using a two-dimensional echo-planar imaging (2D-EPI) acquisition, using pseudo-continuous labeling.\n63\nOther parameters include: TR/TE\u2009=\u20094500\u2009ms/12\u2009ms, label duration (\u03c4)\u2009=\u20091.5\u2009sec, post-labeling delay (PLD)\u2009=\u20091.8\u2009sec, labeling plane offset\u2009=\u200990\u2009mm from center of imaging slices, resolution 3.4\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4\u2009\u00d7\u20096\u2009mm\n3\n, 24 slices with 1.5\u2009mm gap acquired in ascending order, iPAT acceleration factor\u2009=\u20092, 35 pairs of interleaved control, and tag images (total duration\u2009=\u20095\u2009min 29\u2009sec).\n\nCBF mapping\nImaging data were processed using in-house scripts written in Matlab R2016a (Mathworks, Natick, MA) with Statistical Parametric Mapping SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK). All ASL data were motion corrected with the first image of the series as the reference and then co-registered to the high resolution anatomical image. Perfusion weighted images were generated by pairwise subtraction between control and tag images and averaged over the entire time series. Images were converted to quantitative CBF units in mL/100\u2009g/min using the single-blood-compartment model:\n64\nf\n=\n\u03bb\n\u22c5\n\u0394\nM\n\u22c5\ne\nP\nL\nD\n\u2215\nT\n1\nb\n2\n\u03b1\n\u22c5\nM\n0\n\u22c5\nT\n1\nb\n\u22c5\n(\n1\n\u2212\ne\n\u2212\n\u03c4\nT\n1\nb\n)\nwhere\nf\nrepresents CBF in quantitative units, \u0394M is the perfusion weighted signal, \u03bb is the blood/water tissue partition coefficient (assumed to be 0.9\u2009g/mL\n65\n), \u03b1 is the inversion efficiency assumed to be 0.85,\n63\nM\n0\nis the equilibrium magnetization, estimated from the mean of all the control images, and T\n1b\nis blood T1 assumed to be 1664\u2009ms.\n66\nThe quantitative CBF maps were then transformed to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template space and up-sampled to 1.5\u2009mm isotropic resolution based on the transformation matrix calculated from the high-resolution anatomical image using VBM8.\n67\nGiven the poor spatial resolution of the ASL acquisition, partial volume correction (PVC) is necessary to minimize contamination of ASL signal from different tissue types. Tissue probabilities from segmented gray and white matter (WM) maps of the high-resolution anatomical image were used to calculate true gray matter (GM) CBF based on the following equation, where the GM flow was assumed to be 2.5 times that of WM flow, and P\nGM\nand P\nWM\nrefer to GM and WM probabilities respectively.\n68\nf\nc\no\nr\nr\n=\nf\nu\nn\nc\no\nr\nr\nP\nG\nM\n+\n0\n.\n4\n\u2217\nP\nW\nM\nThe equation above results in artifactual hyperperfusion in areas where both P\nGM\nand P\nWM\nare low (such as near the cortical\u2013skull interface); therefore, only voxels with at least 30% GM were corrected.\n68\n,\n69\nVoxels with <30% GM were set to zero. This threshold also limits the final analysis to areas with >30% GM, which is more robust because the single PLD ASL method used here is mainly optimized for healthy GM.\n64\nPVC maps were smoothed with 8\u2009mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) kernel before entering into statistical analysis. All statistical analysis involving CBF maps used each subject's global GM CBF (gCBF), a scalar value calculated from the mean of all GM voxels, for proportional scaling each subject's CBF map to a global value of 50\u2009mL/100\u2009g/min. This step is necessary to minimize the contribution of inter-subject variability in gCBF.\n70\nSubsequent analyses were performed on regional CBF (rCBF), the average CBF across all voxels in the significant clusters detected in the voxelwise statistical analyses, adjusted by the proportional scaling factor based on gCBF.\n\nBlood draw\nFor assessment of progesterone level, 1\u2009mL of blood was collected by trained nurses of the Northwestern Memorial Hospital outpatient Clinical Research Unit and analyzed at the Northwestern Memorial Hospital Clinical Lab. All except four subjects had blood draws between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. The remaining four subjects had blood draws before noon. This was because of scheduling challenges, as the blood draws were performed by different nurses in the Clinical Research Unit, and their availability was limited.\n\nStatistical analysis\nmTBI versus controls (CON)\nGiven the pilot sample size and multiple symptom scores, we sought to increase our statistical power by computing a symptom composite score from symptom scores that were significantly different between groups, namely the total PCSS and PSS. This composite score was computed in two steps. First, for each of these scores, a z-score was computed by subtracting the group mean of the CON from each subject's score and dividing by the standard deviation of the CON. Second, the composite score was calculated as the average of these z-scores. Standard two-sampled\nt\ntests were then used to determine group differences in the individual symptom and composite scores.\nFor analysis of brain imaging data, a stepwise process was used within the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Institute) software suite. We first identified regions in the brain where the mTBI and CON groups differed in CBF using a voxelwise, two-sampled\nt\ntest. Given the exploratory nature of this analysis on a small sample, we used a liberal threshold of voxelwise\np\n=\u20090.05, a cluster of 10 adjacent voxels to identify potential clusters for subsequent processing.\nGeneral framework\nWe deployed a multi-step statistical process with three steps: (1) identifying two-way associations that met\np\nvalue thresholds <0.05 to reduce the number of potential variable combinations tested; (2) assessing if the conjunction\np\nvalue from three-way associations was less than the Bonferroni correction for all tests done before them (including prospective mediation/moderation tests); and (3) mediation testing with mediation effects >50% and Sobel\np\nvalue <0.05. Because of the substantial number of component prerequisite effects in a traditional mediation approach, even when the percent mediated effect is very large, some of the component prerequisite effects are not as large; and it is too easy for one of these to miss even though the study is more than adequately powered for detecting large mediation effects (Step 5 in Mediation section). Two caveats must be noted: (1) this multi-step process was adapted given the small sample size and potential for large indirect effects; and (2) all results must therefore be considered exploratory and requiring replication for both confirmation and more precise effect size estimation.\nTwo-way associations\nAs the main focus of this study was to determine if there were three-way relationships among regional CBF, progesterone levels, and symptom scores, which could then go into mediation testing, we first computed Pearson's correlation coefficients between symptom scores and progesterone levels to determine the appropriate symptom score for imaging-based statistics. Number of days before return to play and days to symptom resolution were regressed against symptom scores and progesterone levels to determine whether these variables should be included as covariates. Because neither of the relationships approached significance (data not shown), results without these two variables are reported subsequently.\nWithin areas with salient group differences in CBF, we then used voxelwise multiple regression to identify regions where there was a significant relationship between symptom score and CBF for the mTBI subjects. Each subject's global CBF level and the number of days from injury to imaging were included as covariates. Clusters with at least 20 adjacent voxels or more and voxelwise\np\n<\u20090.005, having positive or negative relationship with symptom scores, were considered for mediation analysis, which was corrected for multiple comparisons.\nMediation analysis\nClusters where rCBF significantly correlated with both symptom score and progesterone levels (i.e., three-way association) were entered into a directed mediation analysis, where progesterone was designated as the IV, cluster rCBF as the mediator (M), and symptom score as the dependent variable (DV). The following steps, as applied and tested with other imaging studies,\n71\nwere used to test for significance at\np\n<\u20090.05 for each step.\nStep 1 (Path A): M\u2009=\u2009\u03b2\n0\n+ \u03b2\n1A\n(IV) + \u03f5\nStep 2 (Path B): DV\u2009=\u2009\u03b2\n0\n+ \u03b2\n1B\n(M) + \u03f5\nStep 3 (Path C, model 1)): DV\u2009=\u2009\u03b2\n0\n+ \u03b2\n1,1C\n(IV) + \u03f5\nStep 4 (Path C, model 2): DV\u2009=\u2009\u03b2\n0\n+ \u03b2\n1,2C\n(IV) + \u03b2\n2,2C\n(M) + \u03f5\nStep 5: Use Sobel's test to determine if \u03b2\n1,2C\nis significantly lower than \u03b2\n1,1C\n. If p\nSobel\n< 0.05, then the mediation was considered significant.\nMediation analyses were conducted in SPSS Version 26, utilizing the mediation testing from Hayes.\n72\nIn this study, mediation used three-way associations where a set of common variables (progesterone levels, rCBF, and symptom scores) demonstrated negative or positive associations to each other, with each association meeting a significance threshold of\np\n<\u20090.05. All corrections for multiple comparisons were performed on these three-way associations up front in the following manner. A conjunction analysis was computed for\np\na\nx\np\nb\nx\np\nc\n, where\np\nsubscript\nrepresents the\np\nvalue for each pathway (negative or positive relationship between two variables) in the three-way association. For each three-way association submitted to mediation analysis, the conjunction\np\nvalue was compared with a threshold set as the Bonferroni-corrected\np\nvalue (\np\n[Bonf]), based on\np\n< (0.05)\n3\ndivided by the number of contrasts tested. This\np\n(Bonf) was therefore the following: there were three relationships between CBF and progesterone (Path A), four relationships between rCBF and PSS_Z (Path B), and three symptom score-progesterone level relationships (Path C, model 1) tested. This resulted in 3\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009=\u200936 relationships being tested. This value was then multiplied by 2 for testing directed mediation versus control mediation, resulting in 72 tests run. Our\np\n(Bonf) was therefore set as (0.05\u2009\u00d7\u20090.05\u2009\u00d7\u20090.05)/72\u2009=\u20090.000125 /72\u2009=\u20091.74\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n\u22126\n. As noted, directed mediation tested progesterone as the IV and rCBF as the mediator, and control mediation tested rCBF as the IV and progesterone as the mediator. This control analysis was done to ensure that the mediation was no longer significant when the IV and M were switched (i.e., progesterone does not mediate the relationship between rCBF and symptom score)."

    "Methods": "Study design\nIn this retrospective cohort study, data were derived from the Mass General Brigham Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) that captures all inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department (ED) diagnoses. The Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board approved this study.\n\nPatient selection\nPatients aged 18 years or older who had at least one inpatient or outpatient visit for concussion between 2000 and 2015 and subsequently at least one inpatient or outpatient follow-up visit between 2000\u20132019 were included. Controls were identified using RPDR by selecting patients with the same age, sex, and race distribution as the concussion cohort. Controls with a history of TBI were excluded. The index date for concussion patients was concussion diagnosis date. For controls, index date was a random hospital or outpatient clinic encounter in the system. Age was calculated at time of first concussion diagnosis or index date for controls. All concussion patients and controls with any comorbidities of interest before the TBI or index date were excluded. The remaining patients and controls were followed for up to 10 years to assess the risk of comorbidities over time.\n\nExposure\nConcussion was identified by\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision (ICD-9/10)\ncodes according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria.\n12\nThe cause or injury resulting in the TBI was derived from the ICD external cause of injury codes (ICD-E),\n13\nincluding falls, motor vehicle accident (MVA), struck by/against, assault, and other/unspecified.\n\nComorbidities\nComorbidities included: psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, psychosis, bipolar disorder, sleep disorder, suicide ideation/intent/attempt); substance abuse (drug abuse, opioid abuse, alcoholism); neurological disorders (ischemic stroke, Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, epilepsy/post-traumatic seizures); cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, coronary artery disease); and endocrine disorders (thyroid, pituitary, adrenal, diabetes mellitus); erectile dysfunction.\nComorbidity diagnoses were made during subsequent outpatient or inpatient encounters. Comorbidities were identified based on ICD9/10 codes on the first date of diagnosis (\nSupplementary Table 1\n).\n14\nWe assessed the risk and determined the time to development of each comorbidity after concussion and index date as the date when each comorbidity first appeared in the medical record. We also evaluated the impact of age and documented loss of consciousness (LOC; as a surrogate for injury severity or vulnerability\n15\n) on the incidence of medical and mental health comorbidities post-concussion.\nTo ensure concordance between electronic records and physician or specialist diagnosis, a trained abstractor performed manual chart review on a randomly selected 5% of the ICD codes of all comorbidities obtained from electronic medical records (EMR).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAs appropriate, data were summarized by count and proportion, or median and interquartile range (IQR). We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine associations between concussion and diagnosis of mental health or medical conditions in a cohort with uneven follow-up. Patients with concussion and controls were censored at the time of comorbidity diagnosis, death, or last encounter in RPDR, whichever came first. We used Schoenfeld residuals to test the proportional hazards assumption. Interaction terms that included a time variable were added when the model did not initially meet the proportional hazards assumption.\nTo explore encounter bias and to reduce the likelihood that increased medical surveillance accounted for the increased incidence in patients with concussion, we excluded those with only a single encounter in the EMR system. Using this restricted dataset, we evaluated associations between all studied comorbidities in patients with concussion and controls.\n16\nTo examine bias introduced by differences in the number of encounters before the comorbidity diagnosis in controls versus patients with concussion, we also compared the median number of encounters before diagnosis in both the concussion and control groups. We also separately investigated whether patients with concussion evaluated in the inpatient-only or outpatient-only setting for their first concussion encounter carried a higher risk for comorbidities that could produce bias.\nWe examined incident comorbidities in patients with concussion compared with controls after stratifying by age and LOC status. Because of loss of effective matching in these analyses, the age-stratified analyses were adjusted for sex and race, and LOC-stratified analysis was adjusted for age, sex, and race. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to describe the cumulative incidence rates of each comorbidity with log-rank test to compare risk difference between concussion and control groups. Differences in associations between concussion and comorbidities by age were examined by assessing multiplicative interaction terms in Cox models. Statistical analyses were performed using R v.3.6.1.\n17"

    "Methods": "Animals\nWe used adult, male, Sprague-Dawley rats (\nn\n=\u200942; 11-12 weeks old and 375\u2009\u00b1\u200924\u2009g at study enrollment; Colony 208A; ENVIGO Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN), housed in pairs in a controlled environment (12\u2009h light/dark cycles, 20-30% relative humidity, \u223c22\u00b0C) with food and water\nad libitum.\nAll experimental protocols were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, using standards set forth in the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Rats were assigned to one of four groups: 1) spinal intact, exposed to 28 days of normoxia (Intact Nx28;\nn\n=\u200911); 2) chronic cervical hemisection (C2Hx) exposed to 28 days of normoxia (C2Hx Nx28;\nn\n=\u20098); 3) chronic C2Hx exposed to 28 days of daily acute intermittent hypoxia (C2Hx dAIH28,\nn\n=\u20098); or 4) C2Hx exposed to 28 days of CIH (C2Hx IH28-2/2,\nn\n=\u200915).\n\nSurgical procedures\nAnesthesia and spinal cord injury methods have been described previously.\n13\n,\n41\n,\n42\nBriefly, rats were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane (in 100% O\n2\n) and transferred to a heated surgical station. The adequacy of surgical anesthesia was confirmed by the absence of toe pinch and palpebral responses. Meloxicam was administered (2\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneously [s.q.]) to minimize post-surgical pain and inflammation. The incision site was shaved and disinfected with alternating chlorhexidine and ethanol (70%) scrubs. A 1-inch dorsal midline incision was made from the base of the skull to the fifth cervical segment. After C2 laminectomy and durotomy just caudal to the C2 dorsal rootlets, complete transection of the left spinal cord (midline to lateral border) was performed at C2 (\nFig. 1A\n) using a microscalpel, followed by gentle aspiration to ensure a complete lesion. The dura was closed using interrupted 9-0 sutures, overlying muscle with interrupted 4-0 sutures, and the skin closed with stainless steel surgical clips.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nC2 Hemi-section model and intermittent hypoxia protocols.\n(A)\nSchema depicting C2 spinal cord hemi-section injury model. Briefly, the left side of the spinal cord was cut at C2, severing descending projections to ipsilateral phrenic motoneurons, paralyzing the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm.\n(B)\nSchema depicting 28 days of normoxia (Nx28), daily acute intermittent hypoxia (dAIH28), and intermittent hypoxia simulating moderate sleep apnea (IH28-2/2) pre-conditioning protocols. Pre-conditioning was conducted daily for 4 weeks, beginning 8 weeks post-injury (or the equivalent timepoint in intact rats). Nx28 consisted of 8\u2009h of continuous normoxia (21% O\n2\n) per day. dAIH consisted of ten 5-min episodes of 10.5% O\n2\n, with 5-min normoxic intervals. IH28-2/2 consisted of 8\u2009h of 2-min hypoxic episodes (10.5% O\n2\n), with 2-min normoxic intervals.\nAfter surgery, buprenorphine (0.03\u2009mg/kg, s.q.) and sterile lactated Ringer's solution (5\u2009mL s.q.) were administered. Rats recovered on a heated pad while breathing 100% O\n2\nvia nose cone until anesthesia was reversed. Post-surgical supportive care included buprenorphine (0.03\u2009mg/kg, s.q.) for the initial 72\u2009h post-injury, lactated Ringer's solution (5\u2009mL s.q., 2 times/day), and oral DietGel recovery supplement (1-3\u2009mL, 1-2 times/day, Clear H\n2\nO, Westbrook, ME) until volitional drinking and eating had resumed. Manual bladder expression was performed at least twice per day until spontaneous voiding returned (typically <1 week post-injury). Randomly selected, age-matched rats in intact control groups did not undergo surgical procedures but were maintained in the same environmental conditions.\n\nIntermittent hypoxia protocols\nThe basic Nx, dAIH, and CIH protocols have been described in prior reports.\n9\n,\n13\n,\n40\nBriefly, daily exposures were administered during the light phase for 28 consecutive days, beginning 8 weeks post-injury (or analogous time-point in intact rats). During the 28-day exposure, rats were housed in pairs in custom Plexiglas cages, with access to food and water\nad libitum.\nGas delivery was controlled by programmable mass flow controllers attached to a specialized cage top equipped to deliver protocol-specific gas mixtures (O\n2\n, balance N\n2\n;\nFig. 1B\n; Therapeutiq, Kansas City, MO; cage volume\u2009=\u20094.5\u2009L; total gas flow rate\u2009=\u200916\u2009L/min per cage). Normoxic and hypoxic gases were created by mixing room air with medical grade nitrogen. Gases were filtered for microparticles and bacteria using a high purity compressed air-filter (Parker-Hannifin, Cleveland, OH) and humidified to \u223c30-50% relative humidity using a custom-built system comprised of a Nafion Fuel Cell Humidifier (PermaPure, Lakewood, NJ) connected to a circulating water bath. For normoxia protocols, cages were flushed with filtered, humidified air (21% O\n2\n) for 8\u2009h/day; for intermittent hypoxia protocols,10.5% and 21% O\n2\nwere alternated in 5-min episodes with 5-min intervals for a total of 10 episodes (dAIH28), or at 2-min episodes with 2-min intervals for 8\u2009h/day (IH28-2/2), for a total of 120 episodes.\n\nNeurophysiology\nThe basic neurophysiology preparation has been described previously\n40\n,\n42\u201345\n; neurophysiological assessments were performed by a single experimenter blinded to experimental group. Briefly,1 day after the final exposure, rats were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane (in 100% O\n2\n), and transferred to a heated surgical station, where core body temperature was recorded via rectal probe (Kent Scientific) and maintained at \u223c37.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C. A tail vein catheter was placed for intravenous delivery of urethane anesthesia and supplemental fluids. Using a ventral approach, the trachea was cannulated, rats were pump-ventilated (Rodent Ventilator, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) and mid-cervical vagotomy was performed bilaterally. Tracheal pressure was continuously monitored, and rats were maintained on 2.5-3.5% isoflurane (50-60% O\n2\n) with inspired CO\n2\nadded to maintain end-tidal CO\n2\nbetween 45-50\u2009mm Hg (Capnogard; Respironics, Inc., Andover, MA). A femoral arterial catheter was placed for real-time assessment of arterial blood pressure and sampling arterial blood for analysis of arterial blood gases, pH and base excess (ABL90 FLEX, Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). Rats were then slowly converted to urethane anesthesia (2.1\u2009g/kg, intravenously [i.v.], 6\u2009mL/h) and inhaled isoflurane was simultaneously withdrawn. Adequate anesthetic depth was verified by assessing blood pressure responses to toe-pinch. Urethane supplements (e.g., 0.2\u2009mL bolus) were given if blood pressure increased significantly in response to toe pinch. Following urethane conversion, rats received the paralytic drug, pancuronium bromide (2.5\u2009mg/kg, i.v., Hospira, Inc.), to minimize artifact from respiratory efforts out of phase with the ventilator. Continuous infusion (1-3\u2009mL/h) of a 1:4 solution (8.4% sodium bicarbonate + lactated Ringer's, i.v.) was maintained throughout the experiment; the infusion rate adjusted to maintain blood pressure and acid-base balance (SBE: \u00b13 mEq/L).\nDuring a 1-h stabilization period following conversion to urethane, the left and right phrenic nerves were isolated with a dorsal approach, cut distally, and desheathed. The proximal nerve stump was bathed in 0.9% saline and recorded via custom bipolar silver wire suction electrodes. Nerve activity was amplified (gain: 10k), band pass-filtered (100\u2009Hz to 10\u2009kHz; A-M Systems, Carlsberg, WA), and integrated (50\u2009msec time constant; Power 1401, Cambridge Electronic Design Limited, Cambridge, UK). The signal was digitized, recorded continuously and analyzed with Spike2.v8 software (CED). Baseline nerve activity was established at an FIO\n2\n\u223c0.5-0.6 (PaO\n2\n> 180\u2009mm Hg). End-tidal CO\n2\nwas monitored and maintained throughout the experiment using a flow-through capnograph (Respironics, Andover, MA). The apneic threshold of each rat was determined by progressively lowering inspired CO\n2\nuntil phrenic nerve discharge ceased. Inspired CO\n2\nwas then slowly increased until phrenic nerve activity resumed, marking the recruitment threshold. End tidal PCO\n2\nwas set 2-3\u2009mm Hg above the recruitment threshold for the remainder of the experiment. After a stable period of phrenic nerve activity (> 15\u2009min), an arterial blood sample (\u223c70\u2009mL per sample) was drawn to establish baseline blood gases, and an AIH protocol was administered, consisting of three 5-min hypoxic episodes (10.5% O\n2\n; target PaO\n2\n: 40-50\u2009mm Hg) separated by 5-min intervals of normoxia.\n40\n,\n45\nBlood samples were drawn during hypoxic episodes, and at 15, 30, 60, and 90\u2009min post-AIH to document and adjust physiological conditions throughout the recording period. At 90\u2009min post-hypoxia, a chemoreflex stimulation challenge was administered by increasing inspired CO\n2\nto reach an end-tidal PCO\n2\nof 90\u2009mm Hg; typically, this required an FICO\n0\nof \u223c10-11%. On completion of experimental procedures, the proximal stump of the phrenic nerve was bathed in lidocaine to establish a \u201czero\u201d value. Rats were then humanely overdosed with urethane.\n\nStatistical analysis\nElectrophysiological data were collected using Spike2.v8 software (Cambridge Electronic Design, CED, Cambridge, UK). Data were included in analysis only if they met all of the following previously established criteria\n40\n,\n41\n: 1) PaO\n2\nduring baseline and recovery was >180\u2009mm Hg; 2) PaO\n2\nduring hypoxic episodes was 40 to 50\u2009mm Hg; and 3) PaCO\n2\nremained within 1.5\u2009mm Hg of baseline post-AIH. Average phrenic nerve amplitude was evaluated for 1\u2009min prior to each blood sample (baseline; first hypoxic episode; and 15, 30, 60, and 90\u2009min post-AIH; for simplicity, phrenic burst amplitude is reported only during baseline, hypoxic episodes, and 90\u2009min post-AIH. Phrenic burst amplitude during each hypoxic response was determined from Minute 3 of each hypoxic episode (H1, H2, and H3). In addition to average amplitudes expressed as a raw value (volts), integrated nerve burst amplitude was normalized as a percent change from baseline (e.g., pLTF). Group data were averaged and expressed as means \u00b11 standard error of the mean. Groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey honest significant difference\npost hoc\ntests. For comparisons of phrenic output, cardiovascular variables and blood gas values across experimental protocols, groups were compared using a two-way ANOVA with a repeated measures design and Tukey honest significant difference\npost hoc\ntests. Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) and SigmaPlot version 14 (Systat software, San Jose, CA). Differences were considered statistically significant if\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Participants were enrolled as part of an ongoing study assessing the effects of concussion and contact-sport exposure (Project ChronEx) between December 2018 and February 2020. Participants were recruited from the community and screened to determine whether they met study criteria. For screening purposes, athletes reported their current or most recent sport, which included football, rugby, soccer, men's ice hockey, men's lacrosse, softball, baseball, track and field, cross-country, basketball, and volleyball. Inclusion criteria included sport participation within the past 12 months and being 18\u201326 years of age. Exclusion criteria included: 1) self-reported diagnosis of neurodevelopmental (including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), psychiatric, neuroendocrine, severe neurological, or severe autoimmune diseases; 2) previous moderate or severe TBI; 3) excessive alcohol or substance use assessed by the CAGE Questions Adapted to Include Drug Use screener (CAGE-AID; \u22652 items); 4) use of neuroactive medication; 5) concussion within the past 6 months or incomplete recovery from previous concussion; 6) contraindication to study procedures; and 7) injury or illness that precluded participation in study protocol.\n\nIn addition, to ensure a wide range of sport participation history, athletes in non-contact sports (e.g., volleyball) were excluded if they had recent (i.e., college) participation in a contact sport. Efforts were made to conduct study visits outside of the competitive season for athletes currently in sports associated with high levels of TBI or RHI exposure. The Medical College of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board approved all aspects of this study. Participants provided written informed consent.\n\nA total of 108 participants met the study criteria. Study procedures were completed in a single visit. One athlete reported being in-season for rugby, whereas another athlete reported active participation in mixed martial arts that involved routine head contact. These participants were retained for current analyses. One participant did not complete the scanning protocol, and 1 participant had excessive head motion during the scan; these participants were excluded from analyses, leaving a total of 106 participants (Table 1).\n\nClinical assessment battery\nA clinical battery aligned with National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Common Data Elements consisting of both self-report clinical measures and neurocognitive testing was administered to participants. Primary self-report measures included the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 5th Edition symptom checklist to assess general concussion-related symptoms (SCAT; symptom severity score), the Brief Symptom Invetory-18 Global Severity Index to assess general psychological symptoms (BSI-GSI; raw values), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale to assess overall well-being (SWLS). Secondary self-report measures included the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale to measure anhedonia (SHAPS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; global score), and the Global Executive Composite (GEC; raw values) from the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function\u2013Adult Version (BRIEF-A).\nNeurocognitive functioning was assessed using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Cognitive Battery (iPad version). Fluid and Crystallized Cognition Composite Scores (uncorrected standard scores) from the NIH Toolbox were used as primary cognitive measures. The first 10 items of the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMMe10) were used to assess testing effort. Ratio of waist circumference to hip circumference (waist-hip ratio) was obtained following World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and used as a measure of obesity. Socioeconomic status (SES) was estimated using the modified Hollingshead Four Factor Index.\n25\n\nSemistructured interviews for estimating previous concussion\nA newly developed comprehensive semistructured interview was conducted to allow retrospective diagnosis of concussions. Participants were asked to recall any injuries to their head or neck. Detailed information was systematically collected for each injury, including: cause and mechanism of injury; approximate date of injury; age at injury; whether they received medical care (including status of computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging) for the injury and subsequent clinical diagnosis; the presence of polytrauma; and the presence of retrograde amnesia, post-traumatic amnesia, witnessed or suspected loss of consciousness, or altered mental status. Altered mental status was operationalized as feeling \u201cconfused, dazed, stunned, see stars, or feel like you got your bell rung.\u201d Participants also retrospectively completed the SCAT-5 symptom checklist indicating the presence of any symptoms (yes/no) associated with each injury and the total symptom duration to obtain a retrospective assessment of number of symptoms for each injury.\nCollected data allowed for retrospective diagnosis of the total number of concussions using varying diagnostic criteria. For the current study, two different diagnostic criteria for concussion were used, resulting in two separate estimates of total number of previous concussions for each participant. For the first criteria, the presence of symptoms alone were sufficient for concussion diagnosis (i.e., more liberal criteria), consistent with International Conference on Concussion in Sport Group (CISG) and American Medical Society for Sports Medicine guidelines.\n13\n,\n14\nFor this definition (herein referred to as the CISG definition), a previous injury with of any of the following was included in the count of previous concussions: loss of consciousness (\u226430\u2009min); post-traumatic amnesia (\u226424\u2009h); retrograde amnesia, alteration in mental status (i.e., being dazed or confused; \u226424\u2009h); or at least two symptoms from the SCAT-5 symptom checklist. The second criteria were more similar to American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) and WHO criteria (herein referred to as the ACRM definition), such that the presence of symptoms alone was not sufficient for an injury to be counted in the total number of previous concussions.\n26\n,\n27\nFor this definition, injuries were counted in the total number of concussion only if they had any of the following: loss of consciousness (\u2264 30 minutes); post-traumatic amnesia (\u226424\u2009h); retrograde amnesia; or alteration in mental status (i.e., being dazed or confused; \u226424\u2009h).\n\nSemistructured interview for estimating TBI exposure\nA second semistructured interview was conducted to quantify exposure to TBIs through sport participation, with aspects based on the Cumulative Head Impact Index.\n28\nStudy staff systematically collected information regarding current or previous participation in sports associated with exposure to RHIs (i.e., contact or collision sports\n29\n; herein referred to as \u201chigh-exposure\u201d sports). High-exposure sports included football, rugby, wrestling, soccer, men's lacrosse, men's ice hockey, and combat sports with routine TBI. Exposure data were collected for all high-exposure sports that a participant had played throughout their athletic career and were not limited to their current sport alone. For each sport, the following data were recorded: years and seasons of participation at the youth, high school, and collegiate levels; years and seasons of participation as a starter at the youth, high school, and collegiate levels; age at first exposure; positions played at each level; the percentage of time played at each position; date of last in-season activity; reasons for ceasing participation (when relevant); and sport-specific questions relating to soccer headers and body checking. Similar information was collected for all other, non-high-exposure sports that athletes currently participated in. Intramural sports or recreational sports were not included. Multiple methods have been used to operationalize contact sport exposure or RHI, including years of participation in a primary sport or age of first exposure.\n6\n,\n9\nFor the current study, the cumulative number of years of participation across all high-exposure sports was used as the primary\na priori\nvariable to assess exposure.\n\nImaging parameters and processing\nImaging data were collected use a General Electric HealthCare SIGNA Premier 3 Tesla scanner using a brain-dedicated, receive-only, 32-element coil array (Nova Medical, Inc., Wilmington, MA). T\n1\n-weighted anatomical images were collected using a high-resolution, three-dimensional, magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence with the following parameters: field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm, image matrix\u2009=\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240, 188 axial slices, 1-mm slice thickness, voxel size 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm, repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20092279\u20132356\u2009ms, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20092.84\u20132.97\u2009ms, inversion time\u2009=\u2009900\u2009ms, and flip angle\u2009=\u20098 degrees. T\n2\n-weighted anatomical images were collected using a high-resolution, three-dimensional T\n2\nCUBE sequence with the following parameters: FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm, image matrix\u2009=\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240, 188 axial slices, 1-mm slice thickness, voxel size 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm, TR\u2009=\u20093202\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200986.34\u201393.14, and flip angle\u2009=\u200990 degrees.\nCortical reconstruction and tissue segmentation of T\n1\n-weighted images were performed using the FreeSurfer 6.0 image analysis suite, following their standard protocol.\n30\n,\n31\nT\n2\n-weighted images were included in the processing stream to improve estimation of the pial surface. FreeSurfer output for each participant was visually inspected at multiple stages. For subcortical volumes, the left and right hippocampus served as primary regions of interest. Secondary regions of interest included left and right amygdala, caudate, putamen, pallidum, and nucleus accumbens. Cortical thickness was calculated, resampled to an average surface template, and smoothed with a 10-mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were conducted in IBM SPSS software (version 24; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), unless otherwise indicated. General linear models were fit to determine the association of clinical variables with previous concussion and cumulative years of contact sport exposure; sex, age, waist-hip ratio, and SES were included in all models. SES was missing for a single participant; this value was imputed using the expectation-maximization method. Models with varying distributions were compared using model-fit criteria (e.g., deviance and Bayesian information criterion), distribution of residuals, and inspection of outliers. Based on these metrics, linear models using natural log-transformed self-report measures and non-transformed NIH Toolbox metrics were used for final analyses. Repeated-measures general linear models were fit to determine the effects of years of contact-sport exposure and previous concussion on subcortical volume. Sex, age, estimated intracranial volume, waist-hip ratio, and SES were included as\na priori\ncovariates for subcortical volume analysis. Hemisphere was treated as a repeated measure; the main effect of hemisphere and its associated interactions were modeled.\nFor analysis of cortical thickness, vertex-based linear models were performed in FreeSurfer, modeling the effects of years of contact-sport exposure and previous concussion with the\na priori\ncovariates of sex, age, waist-hip ratio, and SES. A cluster-wise multiple comparison correction was performed using a Monte Carlo simulation with a vertex-wise threshold of\np\n<\u20090.001, corrected for contrasts across both hemispheres. All models were repeated for both operational definitions of concussion. An alpha of 0.05 was used for primary measures. For secondary measures (see above), analyses were Bonferroni corrected within each domain (self-report measures,\np\n=\u20090.05/5\u2009=\u20090.01; subcortical volumes,\np\n=\u20090.05/6\u2009=\u20090.008)."

    "Methods": "Participants 8\u201318 years of age with a medically diagnosed mTBI were recruited from the Alberta Children's Hospital Emergency Department. Concussion/mTBI was defined using the American Academy of Neurology criteria,38confirmed by physician at medical assessment.8,39Concussion was considered to be part of the spectrum of mTBI.40Participants were enrolled using a two-step process: first, by telephone at 2\u20134 weeks, and then in person 2 weeks later. Eligible children were invited to participate in this neuroimaging study as part of the Play Game trial (NCT01874847).41We enrolled children if they had PPCS, and a \u226510-point increase in their total symptom score on the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI) post-injury when compared with their pre-injury scores (assessed at enrollment).42Children were ineligible if they had a significant medical or psychiatric history, a previous concussion within the last 3 months, persistent symptoms following a previous concussion, or a more severe TBI previously. Other exclusions included: use of neuroactive drugs, claustrophobia, and inability to complete questionnaires. Spoken and written consent was obtained from parents/guardians and children, respectively. At the time of enrollment, a standardized interview and medical examination were performed. The PlayGame trial was a clinical trial assessing the efficacy of melatonin (compared with placebo) for the treatment of PPCS. Neuroimaging studies were performed before the study drug was started (Session 1) and after the study treatment had ended (at least 48\u201372\u2009h; Session 2). Details of the study process are given inFigure 1. Ethical clearance was granted by the University of Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board (REB13-0372) and the University of Queensland (2017001523).\n\nOutcome measures\nRecovery status\nRecovery was assessed at 8\u201310 weeks post-injury and was determined using standardized clinical interview and examination and the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory, Youth Report (PCSI-Y). This standardized questionnaire of 26 symptoms provides an overall rating of PPCS. Each symptom is rated on a Likert scale between 0 and 6, (with a range of total scores from 0 to 156). The PCSI has four specific domains derived from factor analysis (physical, cognitive, emotional, and sleep) and a high level of internal consistency and reliability, \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.92.\n43\n,\n44\nChildren were considered to have had a good recovery if their symptoms were at or below pre-injury levels and they had returned to normal activities.\n9\n,\n41\n,\n45\nThose whose symptoms were above pre-injury levels were considered to have had a poor recovery during this time period.\n41\n,\n46\nNeuroimaging\nNeuroimaging was performed at 4\u20136 weeks post-injury and repeated 4\u20136 weeks later. A high-resolution anatomical three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted Bravo scan (slice thickness\u2009=\u20090.8\u2009mm, 226 slices) and a 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin-labelled (pCASL) MRI scan (slice thickness\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009mm, labelling duration\u2009=\u20092\u2009sec, 34 slices) was performed on a 3T GE MR750w Discovery scanner with a 32-channel head coil. The 3D ASL scan was automatically processed into quantitative CBF maps using the scanner-integrated pipeline with default settings (partition coefficient of 0.9; blood T1 of 1.6\u2009sec).\nOne compartment model was applied to convert 3D pCASL scans to quantitative CBF maps using a proton density map. Pre-processing of MRI scans was completed in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12).\n47\nEach anatomical scan was manually reoriented to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line. Anatomical scans were then segmented (gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, bone, soft tissue) using default tissue probability maps. A regression algorithm was used to correct for partial volume effects.\n49\nAll CBF maps were co-registered with gray matter tissue maps for each patient to account for patient head motion between scans. CBF was normalized with mean gray matter CBF in order to reduce data noise.\n49\nThe co-registered CBF map and anatomical scan were both normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute space in SPM12. Finally, the CBF map was smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (full-width half maximum [FWHM]\u2009=\u20098\u2009\u00d7\u20098\u2009\u00d7\u20098\u2009mm) to increase signal-to-noise ratio and generate a Gaussian distribution of voxels, and minimize inter-individual variability in data noise contributed by global CBF.\n49\n\nStatistical analysis\nSecond-level analyses were performed using SPM12 and statistical non-parametric mapping (SnPM) toolboxes to evaluate between group differences in relative CBF (rCBF) using cluster level analyses. SnPM utilizes a Monte-Carlo permutations approach to correct for multiple comparisons, and reduce false positive error rates, minimizing parametric assumptions relating to the null distribution hypothesis.\n50\nA two-sample\nt\ntest was first performed to contrast rCBF differences in recovered versus unrecovered groups at Session 1. In order to analyze the effect of time and recovery on rCBF, a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) examined the effect of time (Session) and group (good recovery at Session 2 vs. poor recovery). Although all imaging was performed off treatment, any potential confounding effect of melatonin treatment on CBF change was assessed using a repeated measures ANOVA comparing treatment groups (placebo, melatonin 3\u2009mg, and melatonin 10\u2009mg). All statistical contrasts included age and gender as covariates. For all rCBF analyses, the height (voxel-level) threshold was established at\np\n<\u20090.001\nuncorrected\nusing a conservative search threshold (cluster size >60), and the spatial extent threshold was set using familywise error (FWE) for multiple comparisons (p\nFWE\n=\u20090.05, cluster size >100). Multiple comparisons correction was achieved using 10000 Monte-Carlo permutations using SnPM.\nNormalcy was established using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov Normal Test. Group differences were analyzed using\nt\ntests for parametric data (body mass index, days post-injury) and Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest (age, income, PCSI-Y) for non-parametric data. Chi-squared or Fishers Test was used to compare proportions between groups. Mean absolute CBF was calculated as the averaged CBF of gray matter. A random-effects linear mixed-model analysis was used to model mean global CBF as a function of recovery groups (i.e., good recovery, poor recovery) and time, with participant entered as a random factor. Fixed factors were group, pre-injury total PCSI-Y score, pre-treatment total PCSI-Y score, age at injury, and gender. Post-hoc comparisons were corrected using the Scheffe test. Logistical regression was used to model recovery as a function of mean global CBF at Session 1. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics for Mac, Version 25.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) and Stata Statistical software Release 15."

    "Methods": "Injury database\nThis work focused on simulating head impact conditions associated with either no injury or diffuse TBI and excluded those injuries that are focal in nature (e.g., skull fracture, contusion). Applying this criterion, an injury dataset (\nn\n=\u2009223) consisting of sub-injurious volunteer tests (\nn\n=\u200950), laboratory reconstruction data of professional football impacts (\nn\n=\u200953), non-human primate (NHP) tests (\nn\n=\u200978), and pig TBI experiments (\nn\n=\u200942) was established. The degrees of injury severity in the dataset were classified for this study as \u201cno injury,\u201d \u201cmild TBI (mTBI),\u201d and \u201csevere TBI (sTBI).\u201d A concussion was considered mTBI, while sTBI cases included diffuse axonal injury (DAI) and some intracerebral hemorrhage cases, which are believed to have the same shearing mechanism that underlies DAI.\n31\n,\n32\nThe diagnosis of injury for individual data was adopted from the corresponding data sources, as briefly introduced below:\n1.\nAn existing database of 31 National Football League (NFL) head impact reconstruction cases that included 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) head kinematic data from 58 players was originally published by Pellman and colleagues\n21\nand re-evaluated by Sanchez and colleagues.\n22\nOf this data, 53 head kinematics were considered valid reconstructed head impacts and 20 of these cases were from players diagnosed with concussion and labeled as mTBI.\n2.\nAn existing database of human volunteer tests from the Naval Biodynamics Laboratory (NBDL) that included 6 DOF head kinematics data involving 22 subjects from 335 sled tests (frontal, lateral, and oblique) up to 16 Gs peak sled acceleration was collected.\n33\n,\n34\nOnly 50 cases of the most severe runs were used in the current study, and all cases were non-injurious.\n3.\nAn injury database consisting of multiple NHP datasets performed by different groups from the 1960s to the 1980s was collected. The first dataset came from the University of Pennsylvania using controlled, non-impact rotational accelerations to the head of more than 100 specimens of different NHP species.\n2\n,\n35\nFrom this dataset, 56 acceleration traces (from axial and coronal loading conditions) were collected and corrected,\n36\nand pathology results from these cases revealed that all 56 tests produced sTBI (DAI). The second dataset came from the Japan Automobile Research Institute using three apparatuses and a variety of loading conditions were utilized to deliver a total of 193 head impacts to the frontal, lateral or occipital part of the head of 89 specimens (mostly macaques).\n37\nMost of the subjects were repeatedly impacted several times before autopsy, which resulted in the ambiguities of the injury diagnosis. For that reason, only five macaque tests which did not have injury from single or repeated lateral impact conditions were used for the current study. The last dataset came from the University of Michigan using a pneumatic impacting device to deliver padded and rigid impacts on the heads of two species of macaque.\n38\n,\n39\nFrom this dataset, there were 17 macaque tests from lateral and occipital impact conditions that resulted in injury outcomes that were consistent with diffuse TBI and categorized for this study as having no injury (\nn\n=\u20094), mTBI (\nn\n=\u20098), or sTBI (\nn\n=\u20095).\n4.\nA dataset consisting of 26 four-week-old and 16 two-month-old pig TBI tests conducted using a rapid non-impact head rotation device\n25\nwas collected. All the subjects received a single head rotation in the axial (\nn\n=\u200919) or sagittal plane (\nn\n=\u200923). The tests produced clinical outcomes from no injury (\nn\n=\u200913) to mTBI (\nn\n=\u200929), as identified in post-mortem neuropathological examination.\n16\n,\n18\nThe resultant head peak rotational kinematics sustained by the subjects in the compiled injury database covers a broad range of acceleration and velocity magnitudes for both the human and animal (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nDistribution of peak resultant angular velocities and angular accelerations in the injury database containing no injury, mild TBI (mTBI), and severe TBI (sTBI) data. (Left) human data; (right) Animal data. Color image is available online.\n\nHarmonized species-specific finite element simulations\nFour species of brain FEMs were used in this study (\nFig. 2\n), including human,\n40\npig,\n16\nrhesus macaque,\n29\nand baboon.\n29\nAll FEMs were harmonized in their modeling approach and formulation of the visco-hyperelastic constitutive model used for brain tissue.\n41\nThe parameters used to define the material response for each model were established independently using the best estimates for each species and were not adjusted for the purposes of this study. The human brain material models were developed using human tissue data\n42\nand validated with brain deformation data from\nin situ\nexperimental studies.\n43\u201346\nThe NHP models were modeled using the same material coefficients as the human model given the mechanical similarity between human and NHP brain material properties.\n47\n,\n48\nThe pig brain material properties were developed using pig brain tissue data\n49\nand validated with brain deformations measured in\nex vivo\nhemi-section experiments.\n14\n,\n30\nAll brain models were constructed using the embedded axon technique.\n40\nAll the FE simulations were performed using LS-DYNA (v971 R9.2.0, double precision; LSTC).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nBrain finite element models used in this study. They were modeled with similar anatomical details and the same hyper-viscoelastic constitutive model for brain tissue. Color image is available online.\nThe head impacts were simulated by applying the experimentally measured 6 DOF head kinematics of each species directly to the rigid dura of the corresponding species FEM at an origin located at the head center of gravity, or at the experimental center of rotation, depending on the source of the data. The NHP and pig simulations were performed using FEMs scaled in geometry to match with the individual specimen's brain mass documented in the experiments. Individual-specific information for the size of the brain was not available for the human simulations, and the model represented the anatomy of a 50th percentile male adult.\n\nTissue-level injury metrics\nA range of tissue-level injury metrics widely used in the literature to quantify tissue-level brain responses were considered (\nTable 1\n). For each simulated case, strain, strain-rate (based on the first-order discrete derivative of strain), and the product of strain and strain-rate was calculated for each element of the brain at every instance in time. The strain measurement was different depending on the element type: maximum principal strain (MPS) was used for the solid elements of the whole brain (including cerebellum, cerebrum, corpus callosum, and brain stem), and tensile strain (maximum axonal strain, [MAS]) was used for the embedded axon tract elements. At the end of the simulation, each element was assigned the values of the maximum strain (MPS and MAS), strain-rate (MPSR and MASR), and strain\u2009\u00d7\u2009strain-rate (MPS\u2009\u00d7\u2009SR and MAS\u2009\u00d7\u2009SR) encountered during the simulation. Injury metrics for the whole brain were calculated from these element-wise results, using the 95th percentile values to avoid any potential complications that may occur with localized numerical instabilities.\n50\nFinally, the cumulative strain damage measure (CSDM), which represents the fraction of the brain that exceeds a specified MPS threshold, was calculated for each case using two commonly used thresholds (15% and 25%). All strains reported in this study were using the true strain measurement.\nTable 1.\nTissue-Level Injury Metrics Assessed in This Study\nOpen in a separate window\n*\nThe suffix 95 is used to denote the 95th percentile value was used, or the specified MPS threshold for CSDM.\nThe current state-of-the-art in FEM analysis for TBI risk assessment uses strain-based deformation metrics for injury prediction.\n51\nHowever, an additional analysis was performed using metrics based on the 95th percentiles of maximum von Mises stress and maximum axonal stress generated from the simulated impact cases in this study. All stresses reported in this ancillary analysis were using truss stress measurements, and the results of the analysis are provided in\nSupplementary Figures 1\u20135\n.\n\nStatistical analysis\nCorrelation between injury metrics (\nTable 1\n) and injury outcomes was evaluated using a two-fold process:\nIntraspecies analysis: The evaluation was performed separately in the group of human, NHP, and pig data. This analysis was limited to combinations of species and injury type where there was sufficient data to generate injury risk functions (IRFs). The human and pig data was used to evaluate the ability of the metrics to distinguish between no injury and mTBI, while the NHP data was used to evaluate their ability to discriminate sTBI and not sTBI (includes no injury and mTBI).\nInterspecies analysis: The evaluation was then performed in the compiled database of human, NHP, and pig data, assuming the tissue-level metrics are equivalent across the TBI simulations of different species. Tissue-level injury metrics measured at similar injury severity (mTBI) were compared between different groups of species to verify the assumption.\nStatistical models correlating an injury metric to the risk of injury were developed using parametric survival analysis with a Weibull distribution.\n52\nA survival analysis approach was chosen because the injury metrics generated by the simulations are considered doubly censored, and a Weibull IRF (Equation 1) was selected because it natively achieves a zero-risk response for zero load.\nwhere\nX\ni\nand\nY\ni\nrepresents the injury metric and injury outcome (1 for injury, 0 for no injury) for the i\nth\ncase, and the parameters l\u2009>\u20090 and k\u2009>\u20090, referred to as the scale and shape parameters, are estimated from the X, Y data using Maximum Likelihood Estimation.\nAkaike information criterion (AIC)\n53\nwas used to estimate the quality of each model/metric. A lower AIC value indicates a better fit to the data. The weight of evidence in favor of the good models was evaluated using Akaike weights.\nwhere\nK\nis the number of investigated models/metrics. With the sum of Akaike weights of all models in the candidate set being 1, a model's Akaike weight is analogous to the probability that the given model is the best approximating model.\n54\nWe identified the IRFs that constitute a 95% confidence set by summing the Akaike weights from largest to smallest until the sum is just 0.95.\n55\nAll survival models were assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test\n56\nwith 10 bins determined by decile. A\np\nvalue below alpha\u2009=\u20090.05 indicated that the null hypothesis is rejected, and that the IRF was not a good fit. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the discrimination capacity of the model/metric to separate individuals with different injury outcomes. A model with an AUC above 0.9 was considered to have outstanding discrimination.\n56\nAll the statistical analyses mentioned above were conducted using the R-Studio (version 1.1.456; R Studio, Inc.) and Matlab (version R2019b; Mathworks)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nPatients with TBI had been enrolled in the Cool Kids Trial of hypothermia in severe pediatric TBI as described previously.\n19\nAll patients' healthcare proxies provided consent for the trial and CSF collection. Briefly, pediatric (age <18) patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score \u22648) were randomized to 48\u201372\u2009h of hypothermia (32\u201333\u00b0C) or normothermia (36.5\u201337.5\u00b0C) within 6\u2009h of injury. For this study, all CSF samples from each study patient enrolled at our site with at least one CSF sample were included, for a total of 54 samples. Deidentified control CSF from lumbar punctures in seven non-head injured patients, containing 0 red blood cells and 0 white blood cells, was obtained from the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh clinical laboratory. The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board approved this study.\n\nCSF collection and SUR1 quantification\nThe CSF was collected from external ventricular drains between 12 and 137 hours post-injury (median 40\u2009h) as clinically indicated per TBI standard of care and immediately placed on ice. Samples were centrifuged for 8\u201310\u2009min at 5000\ng\nas soon as possible and stored at -70\u00b0C until analysis without interval freeze-thaw. The SUR1 from undiluted CSF was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, MBS2000195, MyBioSource, San Diego, CA). Assays were performed by technicians blind to demographics and outcomes. Assay lower limit of detection was 0.117\u2009ng/mL, and SUR1 level of any sample below the detection limit was recorded as 0\u2009ng/mL. Because of limited sample volumes, samples were run singly on a single plate.\n\nPatient demographics and clinical outcomes\nPatient age, sex, admission GCS score, mechanism of injury, hourly ICP measurements over the first 178\u2009h after injury, and GOS-E Peds at discharge, 3, 6, and 12 months were obtained from the Cool Kids Trial database by research coordinators blind to SUR1 concentrations. The coprimary outcomes were ICP over seven days and GOS-E Peds over 12 months. The GOS-E Peds, as described in the Cool Kids trial,\n19\nis an 8 point ordinal scale where, opposite the adult scale, lower scores represent better outcomes (1 is no disability, 8 is dead).\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe SUR1 values are reported as both the mean CSF SUR1 level across serial samples tested for each patient and the peak SUR1 level for that patient. We tested for an association between SUR1 level and time from injury by both linear regression and mixed effects models to look for a temporal trend in SUR1 expression. Descriptive summaries of continuous and ordinal variables are presented as median (interquartile range [IQR]); categorical variables are provided as fractions and percentages. Based on normality, the association between age or admission GCS score and mean SUR1 was tested using simple linear regression, while association between sex or therapeutic hypothermia and SUR1 was tested using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.\nThe primary analysis utilized linear mixed effects random coefficient (RC) models to test the association between mean SUR1 and repeated measures of ICP and GOS-E Peds. Likelihood ratios tests demonstrated that models including quadratic outcome-time association were superior to those including only linear outcome-time association, and that models with an unstructured covariance matrix outperformed models without slope-intercept covariance. Therefore, final models included both a time-squared term and an unstructured covariance matrix. Because of limited sample size, the primary analysis included only variables for time and mean SUR1 to minimize model overfitting.\nSecondary exploratory analyses included RC models adjusted for age, sex, and GCS, RC models adjusted for interventional arm, RC models using peak, rather than mean, SUR1, RC models assessing a SUR1 by time interaction, RC models where SUR1 was dichotomized as detectable in any sample or never detectable, and simple linear regression models testing associations between SUR1 and mean ICP or three-month GOS-E Peds.\nAlpha was set at 0.05 given the study's exploratory nature and known association between ICP and outcome. All\np\nvalues are two-sided. Analyses were performed using Stata SE 16.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX)."

    "Methods": "Case presentation\nA 60-year-old man with a past medical history of Graves' disease and remote traumatic splenectomy was admitted to the hospital after a TBI. He was found down, unresponsive, next to his bicycle. An initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 9 (Eyes\u2009=\u20092, Motor\u2009=\u20095, and Verbal\u2009=\u20092) was reported in the field. On admission to the emergency department, he was severely agitated and found to have a right occipital hematoma. He was sedated and intubated. Neurological examination after intubation was again notable for a GCS score of 9, with movement in response to pain in all extremities, as well as intact pupillary, corneal, cough, and gag reflexes. Head computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a right parietal skull fracture, multi-focal bifrontal and temporal contusions with the largest in the left frontal lobe, a 6-mm left-sided subdural hemorrhage, diffuse convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 5-mm left-to-right midline shift with transtentorial herniation.\nLaboratory evaluation was notable for normal complete blood cell count, electrolyte panel, and renal and coagulation parameters. The patient was immediately taken to the operating room and treated with a decompressive left hemicraniectomy and external ventricular drain placement. A repeat head CT was notable for evacuation of the subdural hemorrhage and resolution of the midline shift, as well as blossoming of the contusions, mild worsening of transtentorial herniation, and uncal herniation. He was not on antiplatelet or anticoagulation medications before admission.\nWithin the first 3 days of admission to the ICU, the patient regained the ability to intermittently follow commands, and he was extubated on day 3 post-injury. However, his ICU course was complicated by a persistent fever of unknown etiology, aspiration events requiring re-intubation, focal seizure activity on electroencephalogram, a gastrointestinal bleed requiring transfusion, and progressive neurological worsening, such that he became unresponsive and developed extensor posturing in the upper extremities.\nA 3 Tesla (T) brain MRI performed on day 13 post-injury demonstrated multi-focal hemorrhagic contusions in the bilateral frontal and temporal lobes, as well as right frontal subdural hemorrhage and hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injury in the midbrain (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n). After several weeks without neurological improvement, the family transitioned the patient to comfort care, and he died on day 26 post-injury.\nBefore death, the patient was enrolled in the TRACK-TBI study. Written informed consent for brain donation was provided by the patient's surrogate decision maker. Inclusion criteria for TRACK-TBI have been previously reported and include age 0\u2013100 and presentation at 1 of 18 enrolling Level 1 U.S. trauma centers within 24\u2009h of injury, with external force trauma injury to the head warranting clinical evaluation with a non-contrast head CT evaluation based on current practice guidelines.\n20\nExclusion criteria include pregnancy, ongoing life-threatening disease (such as end-stage malignancy), police custody, serious psychiatric and neurological disorders that would interfere with consent or follow-up outcome assessment, and non-English or Spanish (some sites) speakers. The study was approved by the institutional review board of each enrolling site.\n\nIn vivo\nmagnetic resonance imaging data acquisition and analysis\nIn the\nin vivo\ncomponent of this study, we focused on the susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) data set, which provides the highest sensitivity for detection of microhemorrhages and hemorrhagic contusions.\n21\nWe (B.L.E., P.M.) analyzed the SWI data set for pathoanatomical lesions and classified each lesion using the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Common Data Elements (CDE) guidelines for TBI Neuroimaging.\n22\nWe later applied this same lesion classification system to the\nex vivo\nMRI 7T multi-echo fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence (MEF) data set to facilitate comparison of the\nin vivo\nand\nex vivo\nlesion data.\n\nBrain specimen acquisition and fixation\nThe whole brain was collected with a post-mortem interval of <24\u2009h (\nSupplementary Fig. S2\n) and suspended in 10% formalin to facilitate adequate fixation, as previously described.\n19\nBefore scanning, the brain specimen was transferred from 10% formalin to a Fomblin solution (perfluropolyether; Ausimont USA Inc., Thorofare, NJ) to reduce magnetic susceptibility artifacts and remove background signal.\n23\nThe specimen, immersed in Fomblin, was packed in a vacuum-sealed bag to minimize air bubbles that would cause distortions in MRI data at the brain-air interface. Additional details regarding brain-specimen packing in preparation for\nex vivo\nMRI scanning have been previously described.\n19\nAfter\nex vivo\nimaging, the brain was placed back into 10% formalin until brain cutting was performed.\n\nEx vivo\nmagnetic resonance imaging acquisition\nWe scanned the patient's brain using a 7T MRI scanner and 3T MRI scanner, as previously described.\n19\nBriefly, the 7T Siemens Magnetom MRI scan utilized a custom-built 31-channel receive array coil\n24\nand an MEF sequence\n25\nat 200-\u03bcm spatial resolution with the following echo times: 5.57/11.77/17.97/24.17\u2009msec (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Total scan time on the 7T MRI scanner was 18\u2009h and 31\u2009min. The 3T Siemens Tim Trio MRI scan utilized a 32-channel head coil and a three-dimensional diffusion-weighted steady-state free-precession (DW-SSFP) sequence\n26\nat 750-\u03bcm spatial resolution. The DW-SSFP sequence included 90 diffusion-weighted volumes and 12 non-diffusion-weighted volumes (\nb\n=\u20090\u2009s/mm\n2\n). Of note, in a DW-SSFP sequence, diffusion weighting is not defined by a single global\nb\nvalue, because the diffusion signal cannot be readily dissociated from other imaging properties, such as the T\n1\nrelaxation time, T\n2\nrelaxation time, repetition time, and flip angle.\n27\nTotal diffusion scan time on the 3T MRI scanner was 30\u2009h and 31\u2009min. All sequence parameters for the\nex vivo\n7T MEF and 3T DW-SSFP sequences have been previously reported.\n19\n\nEx vivo\nmagnetic resonance imaging processing and analysis\nThe 7T MEF data were processed to create tissue parameter maps,\n24\nwhich were estimated directly from MEF acquisitions using the driven equilibrium single-pulse observation of T\n1\n(DESPOT1) algorithm.\n25\n,\n28\nEach parameter map provides quantification of tissue properties independent of scanner and sequence types. Parameter maps were combined to generate a synthetic FLASH scan with a flip angle of 20 degrees, determined to have the best overall contrast and better signal-to-noise ratio than each of the contributing scans (\nSupplementary Fig. S3\n).\nThe 3T DW-SSFP data were processed using the Diffusion Toolkit (version 6.4.1;\nhttp://trackvis.org/dtk\n) to reconstruct fiber tracts (i.e., streamlines), as previously described.\n29\nNotable processing parameters in the Diffusion Toolkit included: imaging model\u2009=\u2009HARDI/Q-Ball; angle threshold\u2009=\u200960 degrees; and propagation algorithm\u2009=\u2009FACT.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\u2013guided brain cutting, tissue sampling, and immunohistopathology\nAfter imaging, the brainstem and cerebellum were removed, and the cerebral hemispheres were cut manually with a 300-mm blade by experienced neuropathologists (D.P.P., D.I.) into \u223c1-cm-thick serial coronal slabs and photographed (\nSupplementary Fig. S4\n), similar to a standard hospital autopsy procedure. Lesions and tissues of interest were then determined by a consensus video teleconference between investigators (A.L.N., R.D.-A., G.M., P.M., C.L.M., B.L.E., D.P.P., and D.I.) comparing gross morphology and anatomical landmarks on the coronal slabs with corresponding landmarks in the\nex vivo\nand\nin vivo\nMRI. To study white matter in proximity to, and remote from, focal lesions, we (D.P.P., D.I.) performed tissue sampling for standard paraffin-embedded block preparation of brain parenchyma adjacent to the left inferior frontal lobe contusion, as well as in the contralateral inferior frontal lobe on the right, remote from any gross contusion or pathoanatomical lesions on imaging.\nAll tissue blocks were uniformly processed using an automated tissue processor (ASP 6025; Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany). Standard hematoxylin and eosin stains, as well as immunohistochemical and special stains, were performed on serial 5-\u03bcm-thick sections. Special stains included Luxol fast blue (LFB). Immunohistochemical stains included antibodies against APP, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1), and neurofilament, specifically to heavy-chain neurofilament (NF-H), which shows expression in uninjured axons.\n30\nAll immunostains were performed using a Leica Bond III automated immunostainer with a diaminobenzidine chromogen detection system (DS9800; Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL).\nSpecifications for each antibody are as follows: anti-APP (mouse antihuman monoclonal antibody clone 22c11, dilution 1:10, epitope retrieval time 10\u2009min, MAB348; EMD Millipore, Burlington, MA); anti-GFAP (mouse antihuman monoclonal antibody GA5, with bond heat-induced epitope retrieval, epitope retrieval time 10\u2009min, PA0026; Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany); anti-IBA1 (rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:100, epitope retrieval time 10\u2009min, Wako 016-20001; FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, Osaka, Japan); and anti-NF-H (mouse antihuman monoclonal antibody SMI-34, dilution 1:100, epitope retrieval time 10\u2009min, BioLegend 835503; BioLegend, San Diego, CA). Hemosiderin deposition was evaluated on a section with only counterstain. All stained slides were scanned at 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification into digital images using the Aperio scanner system (Aperio AT2 - High Volume, Digital Whole Slide Scanning scanner; Leica Biosystems Inc., Richmond, IL) for analysis.\n\nRegion of interest selection for historadiological correlation analysis\nTo optimize the spatial alignment of the radiological and histopathological data, we rotated the coronal plane of the dMRI data set using FreeView software (\nhttps://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FreeviewGuide\n) to align it with the coronal slab from the histopathological data set at the level of the inferior left frontal lobe contusion (\nFig. 1\nand\nSupplementary Fig. S5\n). After identifying anatomical coregistration landmarks in the contusional tissue, we determined that the optimal landmarks within the selected coronal slab for coregistration of non-contusional tissue were located in the contralateral frontal lobe, as shown in\nSupplementary Figure S6\n. Visual delineation of contusional and non-contusional anatomical landmarks was performed by a neuropathologist (A.L.N.), critical care neurologist (B.L.E.), and research technician (B.R.D.). Once an optimal rotation was agreed upon, this rotation of the dMRI data set was applied to the tractography data in TrackVis, allowing all tractography analyses to be performed in a spatial coordinate system that closely matched that of the chosen coronal gross pathology slabs.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nCoregistration of pericontusional regions for analysis in\nex vivo\nimaging and histologic sections.

MRI, magnetic resonance imaging.\nNext, we created \u201cvirtual slides\u201d in TrackVis with the same dimensions as the sampled tissue sections (\nFig. 1\nand\nSupplementary Figs. S5\nand\nS6\n). Within each pair of virtual slides and histopathology slides, we created regions of interest (ROIs) for correlative tractography-histopathology analysis. These ROIs were matched through visual inspection, based upon the curvature of the gray-white junction and contusion profile. We placed the ROIs within the white matter, consistent with this study's aim of detecting the histopathological signatures of tract disruptions. Although directional water diffusion may be present within the gray matter of the cerebral cortex,\n31\ntracts typically terminate when they reach normal gray matter, and thus gray matter was not probed in this study.\nWe considered the optimal ROI size and shape for testing correlations between tract disruptions and histopathological markers of axonal white matter injury. We used a data-driven approach in which we analyzed clusters of disrupted tracts in white matter pathways that were not included in the virtual slides: the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum (\nSupplementary Figs. S7\nand\nS8\n). Visual analysis of disrupted tracts within these white matter bundles demonstrated that tract disruptions were typically localized to square-shaped clusters of four voxels in a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 grid (1.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u2009mm) or smaller (\nSupplementary Figs. S7\nand\nS8\n). Quantitative analysis of disrupted tracts within the splenium of the corpus callosum demonstrated that the most common motif for spatial arrangements of voxels with tract disruptions was a square-shaped 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 voxel arrangement. Voxels within this 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 motif totaled 32.9% (144 of 438) of all voxels with tract disruptions. The remaining disrupted tracts were in single voxels (4.8% of all disrupted tracts) or various irregularly shaped clusters (\nSupplementary Fig. S9\n).\nGiven this spatial distribution of tract disruptions, along with our goal of optimizing visual coregistration, we selected a square-shaped, 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 voxel ROI for testing tractography-pathology correlations in the virtual slides. Selection of smaller ROIs would have compromised the accuracy of the coregistration, whereas selection of larger ROIs would have lowered our statistical power to detect an association between tract disruption and histopathological signs of axonal injury, because intact tracts would have been interspersed with disconnected tracts within each ROI. Of note, we arranged groups of four ROIs in a square (8\u2009\u00d7\u20098 voxels) to further optimize visual coregistration between the histopathology and tractography data and minimize the number of anatomical landmarks required to identify each ROI (\nFig. 1\nand\nSupplementary Figs. S5\nand\nS6\n). Optimal sample size for our analysis was determined after performing a multiple regression power calculation using the pwr package in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), based on a conservative estimate of\nR\n2\n=\u20090.2 from a preliminary analysis that included 15 ROIs. The alpha value was set to 0.05 and the power level set to 0.80.\nGiven this calculation, we then assessed 64 ROIs, of which most were placed >2\u2009mm from the left inferior frontal contusion. However, we observed higher levels of tract disruption and prominent pathology in a few ROIs directly adjacent to the contusion. Given that this pathology is of biological significance, we believed that it should be well represented in our model, and thus we added 12 ROIs directly adjacent to the contusion (brown, cream, and light pink boxes in\nSupplementary Fig. S5\n). ROIs were excluded if no tracts were detected. Seventy-six ROIs were evaluated in total, and two were excluded.\n\nTractography analysis\nOnce ROI size and placement were determined within the virtual slides, we processed the\nex vivo\ndiffusion data set for deterministic tract construction using the Diffusion Toolkit, and we performed a tractography analysis: DISCONNECT (\nD\nelineation of\nI\nntact and\nS\nevered\nC\nomponents\nO\nf\nN\neural\nNE\ntwork\nC\nonnec\nT\nions), using the TrackVis software (\nwww.trackvis.org\n).\n18\nThe DISCONNECT technique allows for a virtual dissection of disrupted fiber tracts from intact fiber tracts, with visualization and quantification of tract \u201cend-points\u201d that terminate within an ROI. Given that tracts are not expected to terminate within healthy white matter, the presence of a tract end-point is interpreted as inferential evidence of axonal injury, leading to a loss of directional water diffusion along the injured axon bundle. For this study, TrackVis creator Ruopeng Wang, MS, created new functionality in TrackVis that allows focused visualization of tract end-points within an ROI (i.e., without concurrently visualizing the other end of the tract). We release this new DISCONNECT functionality in an updated version of the TrackVis software program as version 0.6.3 (\nwww.trackvis.org\n).\n\nHistopathology analysis\nTo quantify white matter pathology and allow correlation with tractography, several metrics were extracted from scanned images of the immunohistochemical and special stains. Staining was quantified for APP, NF-H, GFAP, IBA1, and hemosiderin as follows: Aperio ImageScope\n\u00a9\n(Aperio ImageScope, version 2016; Leica Biosystems) was used to extract a tiff image containing four ROIs (each ROI, 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u2009mm\n2\n). All images were then processed and quantified using FIJI/ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).\n32\nEach image was divided into 4 (for final ROIs) and converted into grayscale and then a binary image, using the same pre-determined threshold for every image. Expression or deposition was quantified as the percentage of area staining for NF-H, GFAP, IBA1, and hemosiderin.\nTo quantify APP, we identified swollen axons rather than an increase in expression, given that swollen axons may appear in a background of non-specific staining unrelated to accumulation from impaired transport. To this end, APP swellings were detected in ImageJ using the \u201canalyze particles\u201d function on the binary processed images with a size criterion of >12.6\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nand a circularity between 0.2 and 1. These values correspond to the size of axonal swellings that have been reported in TBI and fall within the range of criteria previously published.\n33\n,\n34\nAdditionally, these values matched the swellings identified with visual inspection. The LFB-stained slide was quantified as the average intensity of staining on a red-green-blue image rather than the percent area after thresholding. In some ROIs, directly adjacent to the contusion edge, a small area without tissue was included within the 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u2009mm area. These \u201cblank\u201d areas were manually cropped from the image before analysis, and percentage of area or intensity of staining were only calculated within the tissue present.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using R Statistical Software (version 3.6.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Univariate monotonic correlation between variables was analyzed using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Multiple linear regression evaluated the relationship between the percentage of disconnected tracts and the standardized quantitative pathological data, including the number of APP\n+\nswellings/\u03bcm\n2\n, percentage of staining for GFAP, IBA1, NF-H, and hemosiderin, and intensity of LFB. Predictor variables were mean-centered and scaled by 1 standard deviation (SD). These quantitative pathological variables were selected as the best indicators of the relative presence of each marker within each ROI. The percentage of disconnected tracts, rather than the number of disconnected tracts, was chosen as the outcome variable given the variability in tract number detected within the ROIs. Multi-collinearity among the predictors was investigated by using Spearman's correlation and the variance inflation factor. Sensitivity analysis was performed on the multiple linear regression model using the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) method, whereby one observation was systematically removed from the model to evaluate the effect on the significance of the contributing variables.\np\nvalues were calculated from two-sided tests in all cases, and\np\nvalues <0.05 were considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Head impact data was collected from athletes enrolled in six teams participating in a youth football organization. The study protocol was approved by the Wake Forest School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB), with participant assent and written parental consent acquired for participation in the study. Three of the teams, including 56 athletes enrolled in the study, participated at the 11U, 12U, and 13U (i.e., athletes 11, 12, and 13 years old, respectively) levels of play during the 2019 football season, and their coaches received weekly reports of their teams' HIE as will be described. The 2019 teams are referred to as the \u201cintervention teams.\u201d The remaining three teams, including 38 athletes enrolled in this study, participated at the Junior Pee Wee, Pee Wee, and Junior Midget levels of play during the 2016 season and coaches did not receive reports of their teams' HIE. The 2016 teams are referred to as the \u201ccontrol teams.\u201d A summary of the athletes enrolled on each team is provided inTable 1.\n\nAthletes who participated in the study received a Riddell Speed helmet instrumented with a Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System MxEncoder, fit within the padding of the helmet. During the season, participants wore the instrumented helmets at each practice and game to collect head impact data. Protocols previously described in the literature were followed for on-field data collection and biomechanics data processing.5,18\u201328Video was recorded for all practices and games for the youth football teams to validate recorded head impact data (i.e., remove false events such as thrown or dropped helmets) and pair head impact data with practice and game activities. To synchronize the video and sensor data, the clock on the sideline laptop computer to which the sensor communicated with was recorded prior to each data collection session. Video-sensor time offsets were calculated and the video was adjusted to the sensor clock accordingly. All head impacts >40gwere visually verified from the time-synchronized video. During the 2019 season, weekly practice and game reports summarizing HIE data were created for each team and shared with the respective head coach via email. The content included in the reports was developed with input from league representatives and the youth football coaches of the enrolled teams. At the beginning of the 2019 season, a face-to-face meeting was conducted between each coach and study staff to orally describe what was included in the reports and to answer any questions. Questions from coaches on the reports were also answered throughout the season.\n\nPractice reports (Fig. S1) for each team included the average number of head impacts per player per practice each week\u2014including the seasonal average to date\u2014and the distribution of practice head impacts by helmet location (i.e., front, side, top, back). The time spent on specific drill categories and the associated number of impacts were also reported for each day of the previous week. Drills were classified into one of the following four categories: conditioning, skill development (i.e., skill), tackling, and scrimmage (Table 2). Although conditioning drills do not involve contact associated with football hits, they are an essential part of a practice structure; therefore, registered head impacts that occurred during conditioning from incidental contact with the ground or with other players were included. Drills in which players engaged in blocking occurred in skill drills (e.g., position skill work) and tackling (e.g., Oklahoma drill) and were assigned to each category accordingly. Categorization of drills was based on drill descriptions from previous youth football literature3and was reviewed by participating coaches. Season averages were also provided for the number of impacts per week for each drill category. The distribution of impact magnitude, quantified by linear acceleration, measured during each practice each week was provided in 10\u201320g, 21\u201340g, and >40gincrements. The increments were selected to represent low, moderate, and high magnitude impacts. Low magnitude impacts encompass the minimum to the approximate median value of linear acceleration reported in youth football studies.4,29Additionally, a value of 40gis a high magnitude threshold reported in the youth football literature;30therefore, this was used as the upper and lower threshold of moderate and high-level impacts, respectively. Drills associated with high magnitude impacts (i.e., linear acceleration measurements >40g) were provided. Similarly, game reports (Fig. S2) for each team included helmet impact location, the average number of impacts per player, and the distribution of linear accelerations. Impacts >40gwere broken down by field position (i.e., open field or line of scrimmage),30player position (i.e., offense or defense), and impact location. Win/loss record to date was also provided in each weekly report. Because of the time-intensive nature of video verification of impacts, head impact data for the weekly coach reports were grouped into practice/game categories according to paper records and start and stop times recorded by research staff present at each session; however, impacts >40gwere visually verified with video on a weekly basis for the reports. Full film review and filtering for the present analysis were conducted upon completion of the season.\n\nTo investigate the effect of coach feedback and awareness of HIE on practice structure over time, team-specific trends in HIE summary statistics were quantified by linear and rotational acceleration, time per drill per session, and impact rate (i.e., number of impacts per player per minute) each week and by three time frames. The three time frames examined were sampled from the total season\u2014ranging from 13 to 15 weeks\u2014and included pre-season (first 3 weeks), mid-season (middle 3 weeks), and late-season (last 3 weeks), relative to the respective teams' season. Each time frame was sampled in 3-week increments to observe general trends in HIE throughout the season. Practice structure was evaluated by examining the time spent on each drill category per session by time frame. For practices, the average number of impacts per player per session were assessed by time frame and median, and 95th percentiles were computed from the distribution of linear and rotational acceleration on a weekly basis and by time frame. To calculate the average number of impacts per player per week, only sessions with at least one impact were considered for the respective player. To calculate the impact rate for each drill category, the total impacts measured within each drill category were normalized by the total number of instrumented players present per session and divided by the time spent per drill per session. Similarly, for games, the average number of impacts per player, median and 95th percentile accelerations, time per session, and impact rate for each game were compared within and between time frames. Time spent on drills and impact rates were compared across time frames using generalized linear models.Pvalues for relationships withp<\u20090.05 are provided; however, the associations do not account for multiple comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed in SAS Version 9.4. Trends in HIE among time frames were qualitatively compared among the intervention (2019) and control (2016) teams."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAdult, female Wistar rats (\u223c225\u2013250\u2009g; Charles River Laboratories) were used for all experiments. Animals were housed two to three per cage on a 12-h light/dark cycle with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water and were acclimated for at least 1 week after arrival, prior to any surgical procedures. All surgical procedures were performed with the animals under general isoflurane anesthesia (induction 5%, maintenance 2%, in 100% oxygen at 0.5\u20132\u2009L/min) using aseptic technique, sterilized instruments, and a thermal heating pad. During all surgeries, animals were treated with ampicillin (Sandoz; 200\u2009mg/kg, s.c.), meloxicam (Putney; 1\u2009mg/kg, s.c.), and 3\u2009mL Ringer's lactate solution (s.c.) and placed on a thermal heating pad to recover. Following SCI, animal bladders were manually expressed two to three times per day for the duration of the study. Animals were randomly divided into either saline (\nn\n=\u200911) or XPro1595 (\nn\n=\u200915) treatment groups. At the terminal time point, animals were euthanized with Euthasol\u2122 (Virbac AH, Inc.) and transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). All housing, surgical, and animal care procedures were in accordance with Drexel University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)/National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines.\n\nSurgical procedures\nAnimals were implanted with radiotelemeter pressure transducers (HD-S10 or HD-S11; Data Sciences International, Inc.) into the descending aorta 1 week prior to a complete spinal transection at thoracic segment 3 (T3Tx) (\nFig. 1\n). As previously described,\n8\n,\n9\n,\n22\nthe telemeter catheter was threaded and secured to the femoral artery, and the transmitter body was placed in a subcutaneous pocket. Animals recovered for at least 1 week post-transplant, and baseline hemodynamic activity was recorded to verify catheter placement and pre-SCI cardiovascular parameters.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nOverview of experimental timeline. Color image is available online.\nFollowing recovery and baseline recordings, all animals underwent a complete T3Tx-SCI, in which thoracic segment 3 was exposed following a T2 laminectomy, and \u223c2\u2009mm of spinal cord was removed via vacuum aspiration. The cavity was visually examined to verify lesion completeness, gel foam was placed in the cavity, and the dura was sutured shut as previously described.\n9\nTwo weeks post-transection, all animals underwent baseline hemodynamic recordings and colorectal distension (CRD) prior to osmotic minipump implantation. Osmotic minipumps (Alzet, no. 2006) were used to intrathecally deliver either XPro1595 or saline continuously for 42 days at a rate of 60\u03bcg per day. As previously described,\n9\nminipumps were filled with either saline or XPro1595 (10\u2009mg/mL; provided by INmune Bio Inc.) and an intrathecal catheter (ReCathCo) was attached to the minipump. Minipumps were prepared and incubated in sterile saline at 37\u00b0C 60\u2009h prior to implantation.\nTo implant the minipumps, all animals underwent T9 laminectomies to expose spinal segment T8. The catheter was threaded in the subdural space to end just caudal to the T3Tx injury site and secured in place, as previously described.\n8\n,\n9\n\nHemodynamic parameter assessment of experimentally induced AD\nRats implanted with radiotelemeters were individually caged and placed on radiotelemeter receivers (RPC-1; Data Sciences International) to record baseline hemodynamic activity (i.e., heart rate [HR] and mean arterial pressure [MAP]) prior to SCI. This baseline activity was also used to ensure that HR and MAP values were within normal range. CRD, a well-established method for experimentally inducing an AD episode, was performed on weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 post-T3Tx.\n9\n,\n12\n,\n22\nTo provide a real-time readout of cardiovascular function during an AD event, HR and MAP measures were recorded every 2\u2009sec in conscious animals using Dataquest A.R.T. or Ponemah v6.5 acquisition software (Data Sciences International). Similar to what has been previously described,\n9\n,\n22\na silicone balloon-tipped catheter was carefully inserted 2\u2009cm into the animals' rectum and secured with tape. Baseline hemodynamic activity was recorded for at least 30\u2009min during acclimation and established via a time-matched moving average of MAP and HR over a 6-min period. When animals consistently exhibited steady baseline activity, the balloon catheter was inflated with 2.0\u2009mL of air over 10\u2009sec and maintained for 1\u2009min, thereby activating spinal viscero-sympathetic reflexes and inducing an AD episode.\n8\n,\n9\nCRD was performed for two or three trials per animal per time point, with at least 20\u2009min between trials.\nFor each animal, the change in MAP and HR from baseline during CRD and time to return to baseline were calculated for each trial and averaged within and between groups. Differences in hemodynamic activity between treatment groups and over time were analyzed for significance via two-way mixed-analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) tests (GraphPad Prism 8, La Jolla, CA). All analyses were performed blinded to treatment group, and a\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Details of the ProTECT III and the ancillary biomarkers of injury and outcome in the ProTECT III (BIO-ProTECT) study have been previously published.15,16In summary, ProTECT III studied blunt TBI subjects with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ranging from 4 to 12 (on a scale of 3\u201315) and who could receive study treatment within 4\u2009h of injury. Patients with hypoxia (oxygen saturation <90%), hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90\u2009mm Hg), spinal cord injury, status epilepticus, bilaterally unreactive pupils, or a GCS of 3 were deemed ineligible. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either i.v. progesterone dissolved in Intralipid or placebo (Intralipid alone) for a total of 96\u2009h. ProTECT III was stopped early for futility in November 2013, after 882 subjects had been randomized.\n\nBIO-ProTECT procedures were included in version 7 of the ProTECT III protocol. Although the ProTECT III trial began subject enrollment in April 2010, the first Bio-ProTECT sample was not collected until August 2011. Serum samples were collected at baseline (within 4\u2009h of injury) and at 24 and 48\u2009h post-injury. They were processed and stored in \u221280\u00b0C freezer within 60\u2009min of phlebotomy and shipped on dry ice to Banyan Biomarkers Inc. (San Diego, CA) for long-term storage and analysis.\n\nSerum samples were analyzed by Banyan Biomarkers' laboratory technicians who were blinded to subjects' clinical and study data. Analysis occurred in batches and in technical duplicates. GFAP, UCHL1, and SBDP150 were measured using Banyan Biomarkers' proprietary assays and according to previously published methods.15\u201319S100B was measured using the Roche Cobas 6000 assay (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) for GFAP, UCH-L1, S100B and SBDP150 were 0.03 and 50, 0.1 and 9.0, 0.015 and 2.0, and 0.02 and 6.4\u2009ng/mL, respectively. Serum progesterone levels were measured in samples obtained at 24 and 48\u2009h. A total of 7.5% of samples were below the LLOQ, and a total of 3.8% of samples were above the ULOQ. The lower limit and the upper limit of testable values were 0.1 and 2000\u2009ng/mL, respectively.\n\nThe primary outcome for the ProTECT III study was functional outcome measured using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) at 6 months (\u00b130 days) post-randomization. The GOS-E ranks functional outcome on a scale of 1\u20138, with 1 indicating death and 8 indicating upper good recovery. A favorable outcome was defined using a stratified dichotomy of the GOS-E scores, such that subjects with a severe initial injury (an index GCS score of 4\u20135 or, if the patient was intubated, an index GCS motor score of 2\u20133) were considered to have a favorable outcome if the 6-month GOS-E score was 3 or higher. Patients with a moderate-to-severe initial injury (an index GCS score of 6\u20138 or, if the patient was intubated, an index GCS motor score of 4\u20135) were considered to have a favorable outcome if the 6-month GOS-E score was 5 or higher, and those with a moderate initial injury (an index GCS score of 9\u201312) were considered to have a favorable outcome if the 6-month GOS-E score was 7 or higher.\n\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables were summarized as means (\u00b1 standard deviations) or medians (with the corresponding interquartile range [IQR]), depending on whether the corresponding distribution appeared normal. Categorical variables were summarized as numbers and percentages. Consistent with previous studies, biomarker values below the assay's LLOQ were all assigned a value half of the LLOQ, whereas biomarker values above the ULOQ were assigned a value 1.5 times the ULOQ.\n20\nProgesterone values beyond the testable limits were excluded. Mixed-effects models were used in order to compare the biomarker profile according to randomized treatment assignment (progesterone vs. placebo). An unstructured covariance matrix was used to allow for the correlation between repeated observations within a given subject. Given that all biomarker values had right-skewed distributions, they were log-transformed before inclusion in the regression models. Models were adjusted for potential confounders: age, severity of injury on head computed tomography (CT) using the Rotterdam head CT score, and GCS. Given the small number of subjects in the Rotterdam head CT score categories 1 and 6, categories 1 and 2 were combined into a single category, as were categories 5 and 6.\nWe also evaluated the association between steady-state progesterone values and biomarker levels at 24 and 48\u2009h in the progesterone arm using Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient. Given that progesterone levels measured at 24 and 48\u2009h were similar, we estimated steady-state progesterone level as the mean progesterone value of the two time points. Using a logistic regression model, we investigated whether baseline biomarker level (modeled as a continuous variable) modifies the association between progesterone and neurological outcome. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), Stata/MP (version 11.2; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX), and RStudio (version 1.1.463; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Two-tailed\np\nvalues <0.05 were considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "CDE development\nInitial efforts in the pre-clinical TBI CDE initiative identified 167 CDEs describing animal characteristics, animal history, assessments and outcome measures, and pre-clinical TBI injury models.\n12\nHere, we further develop and expand upon these CDEs, define new CDEs, provide the CDE Data Dictionary and Form Structures online, and demonstrate the use of these tools in a missing value analysis of two different multi-study datasets (\nFig. 1\n). Working groups of content experts were formed to develop the CDEs and guide a utilization process. Three working groups were formed: 1) General Health and Affective Disturbances; 2) Cognitive and Motor Function; and 3) Large Animals Outcomes. Each group had co-chairs and met bi-monthly for approximately 12 months, with monthly meetings of the chairs and agency facilitators. Some working group members were part of the previous pre-clinical CDE initiative; new members were chosen for this expanded effort to ensure further diversity of expertise. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Department of Defense representatives facilitated the process and also provided perspective from the clinical CDE effort.\n29\n,\n30\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nPre-clinical Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Common Data Element (CDE) Working Group Workflow Process. Working groups were formed to identify the most commonly used procedures in pre-clinical TBI research. The most commonly collected variables were identified as well as those that were commonly used across experimental procedures. These variables were defined into CDEs and then logical groups of CDEs were made into Form Structures (FS). Once FS were created, reviews of the CDEs prompted revisions, such as clarification of permissible values or consistency with similar CDEs. Legacy data were cleaned and mapped to the CDEs and harmonized within FS. The final FS were validated in and uploaded to a data repository. Data can then be shared and analysis can be performed. Further iterative changes to CDEs are made continually during the process. The demonstration of the platform using legacy data is invaluable to the process and permits improvements to be made based on real-world scenarios.\nWorking group members focused on identification of data elements that are relevant to pre-clinical TBI studies by drawing from their own expertise and the literature, specifically concentrating on the frequency of use among different research groups and how often a particular outcome measure or variable appeared in published studies. Where appropriate, pre-clinical CDEs were defined in parallel with companion clinical CDEs, to maximize translatability (e.g., Injury Elapsed Time). At least two working group members collaborated on the initial draft and several rounds of group discussion and edits were conducted. The resulting CDEs were available for two rounds of public review (\nhttps://fitbir.nih.gov/content/preclinical-common-data-elements\n) that led to additional revisions in response to suggestions from the research community.\nThe resulting set of 913 unique CDEs consists of data elements from three general groups: Animal and Study Metadata, Injury Models, and Assessments and Outcomes (\nFig. 2\n). CDEs are described by 18 attributes (variable name, description, datatype, permissible values, etc.). The Animal and Study Metadata CDEs are comprised of a Main Group of eight CDEs that are intended to be included in every form, Animal Characteristics (six CDEs), Animal History (71 CDEs), and All Tests Common (e.g., test equipment information, room environment variables) (84 CDEs;\nTable 1\n). The remaining CDEs are distributed among the Injury Models and the Assessments and Outcomes. For this effort, five injury models were completed (205 CDEs) as well as CDEs for General Health and Neurological Function (six assessments, 93 CDEs), Affective Disturbance: Depression/Anxiety (10 tests, 293 CDEs)/Social Interaction (five tests, 361 CDEs), Cognition and Motor: Learning/Memory (seven tests, 306 CDEs)/Sensory/Motor (eight tests, 199 CDEs), and Large Animal Outcomes (three tests, 115 CDEs;\nFig. 2\n). Note that there are repeated (or reused) CDEs among the various tests due to cross cutting common CDEs; therefore, the number of CDE from these groupings exceeds the count of 913. Collectively, the CDEs make up the pre-clinical CDE data dictionary, which is available through the CDE Repository at the National Library of Medicine within the NINDS collection (NLM:\nhttps://cde.nlm.nih.gov/form/search?selectedOrg=NINDS&classification=Preclinical%20TBI;\nhttps://fitbir.nih.gov\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nPre-clinical Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Common Data Element (CDE) Groups and Form Structure Procedure. The CDEs are described by a set of attributes (left) that described the data element, inform the user about the input format and permissible values, units of measure and similar information necessary to ensure consistent data entry. In addition, there are instructions, guidelines, and references as appropriate. CDEs are organized into several groupings, shown in the center. The Main Group is intended to go on every form and considered essential to every pre-clinical study. The Animal and Study Metadata includes groups on Animal History, Animal Characteristics, and All Tests Common. The Injury Models CDEs are organized by injury model type, but forms may contain other elements, such as Animal History and All Tests Common. Form Structures can then be built from the various groups of CDEs. For example, a FS for a study that uses fluid percussion injury and Morris water maze would be built from the building blocks in the various forms.

Main Group CDEs are given; these CDEs are intended to be included in every Form Structure. Selected CDEs from the Animal Characteristics and Animal History groups are also shown. Note that some CDEs that may fit in a particular CDE grouping (e.g., Animal Characteristics) are considered part of the required Main group (e.g., Animal Species, Animal Sex).\n*\nOther; Other,specify designation requires a corresponding CDE with \u201c\nVariable Name\nOther.\u201d \u01c2For CDEs needing a unit of measure, there is a corresponding CDE for \u201c\nVariable Name\nUnit of Measure.\u201d\nCDEs, Common Data Elements.\nThe Forms (or Form Structures, FS) are analogous to clinical Case Report Forms (CRFs) and are comprised of selected CDEs, with a corresponding data dictionary that defines the CDEs. At the Form level, CDEs are designated as Required, Recommended, or Optional, to indicate the level of need for data harmonization among datasets. There are Categories/Groups in some of the FS to organize related subsets of CDEs (e.g., Software and Scoring, Testing Conditions). FS are created using the building blocks from the Main group of CDEs and relevant CDEs from the Animal and Study Metadata groups, Injury Models, and Assessments and Outcomes (\nFig. 2\n). Many CDEs appear in more than one FS to maintain a common lexicon across FS, and therefore the total number of CDEs among the 46 FS created is 1664 (\nTable 2\n). For example, the Animal Characteristics FS contains CDEs from the Main Group and the Animal Characteristics CDEs, for a total of 13 CDEs. Similarly, each of the Injury Models and Assessments and Outcomes have FS with groups of CDEs specific to that model or test as well as CDEs from the Main Group, Animal Characteristics, Animal History, and All Test Common group (e.g., Light Dark Cycle Type, Trial Number). For the purposes of community dissemination, the 46 FS created are posted in the CDE Repository for download and use in several different export formats (e.g., REDCap, FHIR, JSON) (\nhttps://cde.nlm.nih.gov/form/search?selectedOrg=NINDS&classification=Preclinical%20TBI;\nhttps://fitbir.nih.gov\n). Researchers can export forms as well as create forms from the available CDEs and field codes from the NIH CDE repository (\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=LowLJh29-4M&t=1s\n).\nTable 2.\nForm Structures\nGeneral study and animal metadata\n1\nMain group\nCommon CDEs for all forms\n8\n2\nAnimal characteristics\nInherent animal features\n13\n3\nAnimal history\nExperimental measurements and conditions, pertaining to the animal\n79\nAnimal injury models\n1\nFluid percussion injury model\nFluid impact to dura mater, diffuse\n32\n2\nControlled cortical injury model\nPiston impact to dura mater, focal\n29\n3\nPenetrating ballistic-like brain injury model\nPenetrating injury, focal to path\n21\n4\nAdvanced blast simulator ABS model\nShock tube, mimic blast overpressure\n57\n5\nBlast-induced injury model\nBlast overpressure\n66\nAnimal assessments outcomes: general health\n1\nBody conditioning score\nGeneral impairment, health status\n11\n2\nChange in body weight\nGeneral impairment, health status, Injury severity\n4\n3\nMorbidity/mortality\nInjury severity, health status\n8\nAnimal assessments outcomes: neurological status\n1\nNeurological deficit score\nNeurological function\n21\n2\nNeurological Severity Score (small animals)\nNeurological function\n31\n3\nRighting reflex\nVestibular motor, assessment of consciousness\n18\nAffective disturbance: depression/anxiety\n1\nElevated plus maze\nAnxiety\n35\nElevate zero maze\nAnxiety\n35\n3\nForced swim yest\nDepression\n18\n4\nLearned helplessness\nDepression, helplessness, despair-like, affect\n22\n5\nMarble burying\nNaturalistic, anxiety, repetitive-like behavior, obsessive compulsive behavior\n34\n6\nOpen field test\nAnxiety, depression, motor, activity level\n71\n7\nPredatory odor test\nAnxiety\n13\n8\nSucrose preference test\nDepression, despair-like, affect, anhedonia\n13\n9\nStartle response\nAnxiety/PTSD\n19\n10\nTail suspension\nDepression, helplessness, despair-like, affect\n33\nAffective disturbance: social interaction\n1\nPartition Test\nAggression, impulsivity, dominance, impaired social interaction\n76\n2\nSocial Interaction Resident Intruder Test\nAggression, impulsivity, Dominance, impaired social interaction\n95\n3\nThree-Chamber Test\nAggression, impulsivity, dominance, impaired social interaction\n79\n4\nTube Dominance Test\nAggression, impulsivity, dominance, impaired social interaction\n32\n5\nUrine Open Field Test\nAggression, dominance\n79\nCognition and motor: learning/memory\n1\nAlternating (Attentional) Set Shift\nFrontal lobe function, attentional function\n24\n2\nBarnes maze\nSpatial learning and memory, working memory\n71\n3\nConditional Place Preference\nContextual learning, addiction\n55\n4\nContextual Fear Conditioning\nAssociative learning (cue and context)\n39\n5\nMorris Water Maze\nSpatial learning and memory, working memory\n46\n6\nNovel Object Recognition\nRecognition memory, working memory\n22\n7\nRadial Arm Maze\nSpatial learning and memory, Working memory\n49\nCognition and motor: sensory/motor\n1\nAngle Board/Inclined Plane\nMotor function, balance\n11\n2\nBeam Walk\nGross motor function\n29\n3\nCylinder Test\nMotor skills\n18\n4\nGrip Strength\nSensorimotor\n9\n5\nHole Poke Test\nImplicit learning, procedural learning, spatial learning, perseverance, motor function\n53\n6\nRotor Rod / Rotarod\nMotor coordination, balance, Motor skill learning\n48\n7\nSticky Paper Test\nSensorimotor, proprioception\n22\n8\nString Test\nMotor skills, balance\n9\nLarge animal assessments\n1\nNeurological Severity Scale (large animals)\nNeurological status and function\n26\n2\nHuman Approach Test\nMotivation, social interaction\n71\n3\nNeurocognitive Test\nMemory, cognitive processing\n18\nOpen in a separate window\nThe 46 Form Structures that were developed are shown here.

Note that the total number of elements among all the forms (1664) is more than the number of unique CDEs (913) because of CDEs used across forms.\nCDEs, Common Data Elements, PTST, post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nUse case dataset: Selection and characteristics\nTo demonstrate the utility of the CDEs, we gathered datasets from several laboratories from working group members and colleagues and piloted the workflow process, from data cleaning, harmonization, and submission, to export for analysis. Analysis included two proof-of-concept use case studies: 1) rat studies from multiple labs using different injury models (fluid percussion injury, FPI; controlled cortical impact, CCI; and penetrating ballistic-like brain injury, PBBI) and the same primary outcome measure (Morris water maze, MWM); and 2) a smaller dataset that used the same injury model (FPI) and the same primary outcome measure (RotorRod or Rotarod). The selection criteria for the datasets included: 1) that the study was already published or derived from published studies; 2) data were available in electronic format; 3) rodent injury models covered in the CDEs were used; and 4) either MWM or Rotarod was a primary outcome measure. There were six different labs and seven different datasets, including the following: 1) MWM: five datasets for MWM, all rat studies, three injury models (CCI, FPI, PBBI), total of 358 subjects, 44 total CDEs for each dataset, with 1851 total cases (animals x behavior trials/animal) and 85,146 total values (cases x #CDEs); and 2) Rotarod: three datasets for Rotarod/Rotor Rod, two mice and one rat, both FPI injury model, total of 97 subjects, with 453 total cases (animals\u2009\u00d7\u2009behavior trials/animal) and 21,744 total values (cases\u2009\u00d7\u2009#CDEs) and 48 total CDEs (see\nSupplementary Table S2\nfor summary of lab information). We refer to these datasets as legacy data.\n\nData cleaning and harmonization\nPrior to uploading the data, legacy data underwent cleaning and data harmonization according to CDE definitions. Cleaning included various procedures, such as a simple search and replace (e.g., \u201crat\u201d to \u201crats\u201d), spell check, removing extra spaces, etc. The dates were converted to ISO 8601 format, and the injury elapsed time data were recalculated from hours to minutes to correspond with the CDE definition. In addition, some reasonable extrapolations were done, mostly for behavioral tests dates. For example, since the behavioral tests were all done at a specific number of days post-injury, as defined in the study design, if we knew the date of injury, and if the behavioral test dates were not available, we extrapolated these dates based on the study design information. Files were manually checked for values that appeared incorrect (e.g., out of normal range) and if confirmed wrong or inconclusive, were removed from the submission. Legacy data were entered into the appropriate spreadsheet (i.e., FS, comma-separated value [csv] format), and harmonized to the corresponding CDEs. Harmonization entailed mapping (or matching) the collected data categories to the appropriate CDEs and entering the values into the corresponding column in the spreadsheet. Some data pieces were further separated into basic units to facilitate mapping to the simplest CDE level (e.g., 50\u2009mg/kg intraperitoneally is a dose quantity, a dose unit, and a dose route).\n\nForm generation and data submission\nThe finalized sets of CDEs for MWM and Rotarod were gathered into the logical FS. The FS for MWM contained 44 CDEs, where 20 CDEs were created specifically to capture key parameters of the MWM test and 24 CDEs were taken from the set of variables commonly used across multiple studies (\nSupplementary Table S3\n). The CDEs include, among others, injury group (e.g., injured, sham, na\u00efve), time elapsed since injury, species, sex, injury date, tank diameter, water depth, water and room temperature, platform height, duration of each trial, swim speed, latency, and percent time in target quadrant. Overall, for MWM, there were 6 CDEs associated with \u201cdata collected\u201d (i.e., dependent variables), with the remaining 38 CDEs from independent variables related to animal and experimental descriptors. The number of rows assigned to each subject equaled the number of days the animal underwent water maze assessment, so that the latency to find the platform on each day of testing was entered in a single column for the corresponding CDE. For example, if there were 4 days of MWM acquisition testing followed by a probe trial on Day 5, there were five rows for each subject. Similarly, the set of CDEs in the Rotarod FS includes 48 CDEs, where 15 CDEs were created specifically to capture key parameters of the Rotarod test, and 33 CDEs were taken from the set of variables commonly used across multiple pre-clinical TBI experiments (\nSupplementary Table S4\n). The Rotarod FS contained three CDEs in the \u201cdata collected\u201d category and 45 CDEs associated with animal and experimental independent variables.\nEach animal subject was assigned a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID), provided by Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research (FITBIR) Operations, that was entered into the FS in addition to the subject ID that was given by the investigator. Once the data were mapped into the FS and cleaned, the FS was validated and submitted to the FITBIR demo site (a temporary workspace for the working group and pilot study) using the validation and submission tools on the FITBIR website.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe determined how well CDEs aligned on each uploaded dataset by performing a descriptive missing value analysis (MVA module; SPSS v.25, IBM), which analyzes the extent to which data were complete, and the nature of the \u201cmissingness.\u201d\n21\n,\n31\nEach cell was categorized as \u201ccomplete\u201d if it contained a value within the cell of the uploaded spreadsheet. Data cells were categorized as \u201cmissing values\u201d if they did not contain a value within the cell in the uploaded spreadsheet. This is the foundation of the statistical method known as \u201cmissing values analysis\u201d where the pattern of missingness is characterized, and mitigation strategies can be devised to recover missing data, or fill in (impute), or estimate missing values within a particular confidence interval.\n31\nEach dataset (MWM, Rotarod) represents a number of studies within and across labs. As discussed above, the data were structured so that repeated measures were on separate rows of the dataset. Thus, each animal had multiple rows associated with it. Each of these rows are referred to in this missing values analysis as \u201ccases.\u201d To accurately assess the extent of completion, all identifying/demographic values that would not vary across time (e.g., sex) for each animal were repeated. The level of completion was assessed in three dimensions: the number of variables that had complete data across cases, the number of cases with complete data across all variables, and the total number of values that were completed (variables\u2009\u00d7\u2009cases). Finally, the number of variables in each dataset for which there were no data across all cases was reported."

    "Methods": "Animals\nA total of 62 adult male and four female Wistar rats (weight 200-250\u2009g, Charles River) were used in this study, including two na\u00efve male and two na\u00efve and two SCI female rats for basal micturition reflex recording, nine na\u00efve male rats for histology, six SCI male rats for fast scan cyclic voltammetry, 38 SCI male for micturition reflex assays (containing five males for metabolic cages and 11 males for histological analysis), and seven SCI male rats for voiding efficiency assessments. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and National Institutes of Health guidelines on animal care were strictly followed to minimize the number of animals used and any potential suffering.\n\nSCI\nA complete spinal cord transection was performed at the 10th thoracic (T10) level to interrupt the spinobulbospinal micturition reflex pathway while lower motor neurons for urinary function kept intact.\n8\nAfter animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane, the skin on the back was shaved and disinfected with xenodine. A drop of eye lube was put on the eyes for protection. Under a surgical microscope (M651, Leica), animals were placed on the surgical station with a heating pad on the bottom to maintain body temperature. A skin incision in the midline of the back was made, and then muscles on the spine were detached to expose the dorsal part of T8 vertebrae. Subsequently, dorsal laminectomy was performed with a rongeur to expose T10 spinal cord segment. The cord was completely transected with a No. 11 blade. To ensure the lesion completeness, transection was performed at least twice until two spinal stumps were retracted. Then, a small piece of gelfoam was placed between the two stumps to stop bleeding. Afterwards, the muscles were closed with 4-0 silk suture and the skin was clipped with staples.\nEach animal received subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of 3\u2009mL Lactated Ringer's solution, 0.2\u2009mL cefazolin (10\u2009mg/kg), and 0.2\u2009mL buprenex (0.1\u2009mg/kg, Reckitt Benckiser) after surgery. Animals were then put back in new cages and given purified soft diet (Dietgel 76A) for supplement. The bladder was manually expressed at least 3-4 times per day on the first 2 weeks until spontaneous bladder reflex was established, and then three times daily until sacrifice to expel residual urine.\n\nFast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV)\nThree or 7 weeks after T10 spinal cord transection, rats (\nn\n=\u20093 per time-point) were sacrificed by decapitation after being fully anesthetized with isoflurane.\n19\nThe lumbosacral spinal cord was dissected immediately. A vibrating microtome was used to produce 300-\u03bcm thick horizontal longitudinal slices of the spinal cord samples (L2-S3), which were incubated with oxygenated, ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing NaCl (126\u2009mM), KCl (2.5\u2009mM), NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n(1.2\u2009mM), CaCl\n2\n(2.4\u2009mM), MgCl\n2\n(1.2\u2009mM), NaHCO\n3\n(25\u2009mM), glucose (11\u2009mM), L-ascorbic acid (0.4\u2009mM), pH adjusted to 7.4, for approximately 30-60\u2009min. Then, one section including the lateral parasympathetic region was placed on a perfusion chamber at 32\u00b0C.\nA carbon fiber microelectrode and a bipolar stimulating electrode were placed in the lateral autonomic region of the section, where abundant TH\n+\nneurons are located.\n8\nDA release was elicited every 5\u2009min using five electrical stimulation pulses at 10\u2009Hz (400\u2009\u03bcA, 4\u2009msec, monophasic).\n20\nThe electrode potential was linearly scanned from -0.4 to 1.3\u2009V and back to -0.4\u2009V versus Ag /AgCl. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded every 100\u2009msec. Cyclic voltammograms that were biased by electrical stimulation artifact were removed from the current versus time plots prior to analysis. DA release magnitude was calculated relative to\npost hoc\nelectrode calibrations using 3\u2009\u03bcM DA. The magnitude of electrically-evoked DA release was recorded under calcium and calcium-free conditions to ensure that release was calcium dependent.\n\nBladder cystometrogram and EUS electromyography\nFollowing complete SCI, spontaneous micturition reflex was usually reestablished within 2 weeks in rats due to reestablished spinal segmental circuitry.\n1\n,\n2\nTo measure the involuntary micturition reflex, SCI male rats (\nn\n=\u200938) underwent bladder cystometrogram (CMG) and EUS electromyography (EMG) recordings 3-4 weeks after injury.\nSCI rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and the skin of abdomen and right leg was shaved. After the bladder was manually emptied, rats were placed on the surgical station with supine position. An incision was made in the midline of low abdominal wall to expose the bladder. Next, a purse string suture of 6-0 silk thread was placed around the bladder dome, and a small hole was produced by a 20-G needle in the center of the purse string sutured bladder dome. A polyethylene catheter (PE-60, Clay Adams) with a collar on the tip was then inserted into the bladder dome through the hole and the suture was tightened around the catheter.\n21\nNext, the rostral part of the pubic bone was removed and the EUS was exposed. Two fine-wire electrodes (Astro-Med) were guided by a needle and transcutaneously inserted into both sides of the EUS (external).\n22\nBriefly, one end of the electrode was bent and hooked on the tip of a 30 G needle to wind the wire around the needle. Subsequently, the needle tip was inserted through the perineal zone, 2-3\u2009mm lateral to the vagina, into the EUS, and the needle was withdrawn but the electrode was left in the muscle. As an alternative approach, two additional electrodes were inserted into both sides of the EUS from opened abdomen (internal) and their ends extruded outside. The internal electrodes were used in case of failure from external ones.\n23\nFinally, the incision was closed with 4-0 suture while a small piece of abdominal muscle was left out of the incision for connecting to the ground wire.\nA separate PE-10 catheter was used for i.v. drug administration. An incision perpendicular to the femoral vein was made on the skin of the right thigh to expose the femoral blood vessel bundle. The vein was then separated from the artery and saphenous nerve with fine forceps. Two 7-0 silk thread segments were put underneath the femoral vein at the proximal and distal ends, respectively, and the distal one was ligated to stop blood flow. The catheter was implanted in the femoral vein through a small hole between the two threads poked guided by a 23-G needle with the bent tip, and was anchored by the ligation of two threads. The skin was closed with 4-0 suture and the other end of the catheter was connected to a syringe for drug delivery.\nFor i.t. administration, a midline incision on the back was made to expose the T12 spine. Muscles on the spine were separated and laminectomy was performed at the dorsal vertebrae to expose the lower lumbosacral spinal cord. A small hole was made on the dura mater with a 25 G needle and a small diameter catheter (ITC-32 G, ReCath) was inserted into the intrathecal space caudally about 0.5\u2009cm long reaching to approximate L6/S1 spinal level. The catheter was fixed with tissue adhesive glue (3M) and the incision was closed with 4-0 suture leaving the other end of the catheter outside the skin for drug delivery.\nAfter the surgery, animals were placed in a restraining cage (KN-326, Natsume). The electrodes were connected to an alternating current amplifier (1700, A-M System) at a sample frequency of 1.0\u2009kHz and the ground wire was connected to the abdominal muscles. The bladder catheter was connected to a pressure transducer (Transbridge, WPI) and a microinjection pump (SP2001, WPI) via a three-way stopcock. The amplifier and transducer connected to a recording system of Windaq Data Acquisition (DI-1100, DATAQ Instruments). A container was put right under the animal for collecting the urine. Room temperature saline was infused into the bladder constantly at a rate of 0.3\u2009mL/min.

Bladder CMG parameters included the voiding amplitude (VA) of intravesical bladder pressure, the voiding intervals between two sequential voids (VI), and the number of non-voiding contractions (NVCs) before each voiding contraction (\nFig. 1A\n). The urine volume was measured manually in each voiding contraction. To evaluate EUS tonic activity, the root mean square (RMS) of recorded voltage value of tonic activity was calculated during 5\u2009sec right before the onset of voiding, which represents the filling phase and reflects the capability of continence. The maximum amplitude of tonic activity (MA) in the period of this duration was also measured. Depending on the extent of recovery, EUS bursting during voiding that often indicates the ability of urinary elimination appeared in some SCI rats but not in others. However, those who initially had no bursting might display the activity after drug administration. In both situations, the bursting period during the voiding (\nFig. 1B\n) was measured in the recorded EUS activity. All parameters were measured in 4 continuous voiding cycles and the values were averaged for statistical analysis.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nIllustrations indicate parameters measured during bladder and sphincter reflex recordings. These include\n(A)\nthe voiding amplitude (VA) of intravesical bladder pressure (*indicates a voiding contraction), the voiding interval (VI), non-voiding contractions (NVCs, represents as #) in bladder cystometrogram (CMG), and\n(B)\ntonic or bursting activity in external urethral sphincter (EUS) electromyography (EMG). Tonic EUS activity in the filling phase is evaluated by root mean square (RMS) and the maximum amplitude (MA) of recorded voltage value during 5\u2009sec right before the onset of voiding, while bursting EUS activity, which exhibits as clusters of high-amplitude spikes separated by silent periods, is measured as the duration of bursting period (BP).\nTo elucidate the voiding efficiency, rats (\nn\n=\u20097) underwent pharmacological interventions during single bladder CMG assessment. After each void, the infusion pump was stopped and the residual volume (RV) in the bladder was measured by withdrawing through the intravesical catheter with a syringe. The sum of VV and RV was the bladder capacity (BC), and then the voiding efficiency (VE) was determined by this equation: VE (%)\u2009=\u2009[(VV/BC)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100].\n35\n\nMetabolic cage assays\nTo measure micturition pattern of spontaneous voiding, metabolic cage assays were employed.\n36\n,\n37\nThree weeks after SCI, rats (\nn\n=\u20095) were placed in metabolic cages (Braintree Scientific) after the bladder was manually emptied, with free access to ample food and water. A plastic cup was put under the cage on the transducer for collecting the urine, which was filled with 3\u2009mL of mineral oil to avoid evaporation. After 3\u2009h equilibration, animals received s.c. administration of a total of 300\u2009\u03bcL of saline as a control or the D\n2\n-like receptor (DR\n2\n) agonist quinpirole (0.03\u2009mg/kg). The spontaneous voiding was recorded continuously for 6\u2009h each day with Windaq Data Acquisition software (DI-158). Experiments were performed at the same time frame every day. Saline vehicle or drug administration were alternately repeated three times. Micturition parameters, including the urine volume per void, total volumes, voiding intervals or frequencies, as well as volumes of drinking water, were measured. Data that were collected from 3 days per rat were averaged for statistical analysis.\n\nTissue processing for histological analysis\nNa\u00efve (\nn\n=\u20099) or SCI rats (\nn\n=\u200911) that survived for an additional 3 weeks following injury were euthanized with intraperitoneal injection of 0.3\u2009mL euthasol. Animals underwent transcardial perfusion with saline and then 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The spinal cord was dissected out and post-fixed overnight and later transferred into 30% sucrose in PBS. For coronal sections (\nn\n=\u20095 per group), approximately 3\u2009cm lumbosacral cord spanning from T12-S3 was dissected to remove the dura and nerve roots, then six spinal samples were placed in a plastic mold with the caudal spinal end evenly aligned and embedded in tragacanth dissolved in sucrose solution. For longitudinal sections (\nn\n=\u20094 in na\u00efve,\nn\n=\u20096 in SCI), each lumbosacral spinal segment was embedded separately in one mold. The tissue block was snap frozen in dry ice and stored at -20\u00b0C until sectioning.\nCryosectioning was performed with a cryostat (Microtome). Coronal sections were obtained in 20-\u03bcm thickness and directly mounted on five series of subsided slides. Each slide contained 10 sections and each series contained 10 slides. In this manner, adjacent sections on the same slide were separated by 100\u2009\u03bcm.\n38\nOne series was picked for each immunostaining assay. In contrast, the spinal segment that was sectioned horizontally and longitudinally with 35-\u03bcm thickness was kept free floating. Every six sections were consecutively placed into six wells of a 24-well plate filled with tissue cryosection solution (TCS). Thus, adjacent sections in one well were separated by 210\u2009\u03bcm.\n39\nLikewise, serial sections were randomly selected for each immunostaining.\n\nImmunostaining and quantification\nMounted spinal coronal sections were rinsed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) three times, 10\u2009min each time. The sections were blocked in blocking buffer (TBS containing 5% goat serum and 0.5% triton X-100) for 1\u2009h and were then incubated with primary antibody against TH (rabbit, 1:1000, Millipore) overnight at room temperature. After being rinsed in TBS three times again, sections were incubated in Alexa 594-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:500, Invitrogen) for 6\u2009h, blocked from light. Following rinse, slides were cover-slipped after adding Fluorosave mounting medium containing 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Southern). For longitudinal sections, free-floating spinal cord sections were incubated with primary antibodies against TH (rabbit, 1:1000, Millipore), mouse, 1:500, Millipore), and mature neuronal marker NeuN (mouse, 1:200, Millipore). The sections were incubated in secondary antibodies including Alexa 594 or 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (both 1:500, Invitrogen) for 3\u2009h at room temperature. After cover-slipped, the edge of slides was sealed with nail polish and then kept in -20\u00b0C. Images were obtained using a Leica DM5500B microscope.\nQuantification of lumbosacral TH\n+\ncells was performed in 10 coronal sections of each animal (\nn\n=\u20095 per group). All TH\n+\ncells displaying typical neuronal morphology with cellular processes and a DAPI\n+\nnucleus in the lateral parasympathetic nuclei were counted at 200\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification.

    "Methods": "Despite the promising results from pre-clinical studies, human studies of medical cannabis and TBI have been limited. An exhaustive search of the literature was completed with consultation with an expert medical librarian. Importantly, a formal systematic or scoping review was attempted, but could not be completed because of to the paucity of literature. Articles were included if they met the following criteria: 1) peer-reviewed original research articles (i.e., no case studies or reviews), 2) published or e-published in English, and 3) focused on neuroprotection, treatment, or adverse effects of cannabis in humans with TBI.\n\nThe first search was conducted in PubMed (1946 to May 19, 2020) with the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): TBI terms: \u201cBrain Injuries,\u201d \u201cBrain Injury, Chronic,\u201d \u201cBrain Injuries, Traumatic,\u201d \u201cHead Injuries, Penetrating,\u201d \u201cBrain Injuries, Diffuse,\u201d OR \u201cBrain Concussion.\u201d Cannabis terms: \u201cCannabis,\u201d \u201cMedical Marijuana,\u201d \u201cMarijuana Smoking,\u201d and \u201cCannabinoids.\u201d Forty articles were retrieved. The abstracts were reviewed for each of these articles. One phase II clinical trial on TBI and medical cannabis was found through one of the articles in this search because it was a commentary on the clinical trial. Given the few articles that were found, we sought to broaden our criteria for search by using non-MeSH terms (cannabis AND Brain AND injur* [tw]). Eighty records were retrieved. The Latin American & Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS; 1982 to May 19, 2020) with the same search terms retrieved zero results.

    "Methods": "CT imaging data acquisition and normalization\nAs part of the ProTECTIII randomized multi-center clinical trial, CT imaging data were prospectively acquired from patients with moderate to severe TBI between April 2010 and October 2013 across 49 trauma centers in the United States.\n18\nBaseline head CT imaging was completed in 881 enrolled subjects to assess intracranial pathology after TBI. These images were obtained according to each participating center's standard-of-care head CT protocol, assigned unique identifiers, and stored as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data in a central repository for review.\nSpecific CT data collection techniques, such as gantry tilting, varied according to local site protocols. Additionally, slice thickness of DICOM data ranged from 1.5\u2009mm to 4.5\u2009mm. Maintaining high z-dimension image resolution was not prioritized during acquisition. To standardize these data for three-dimensional (3D) analysis, baseline CT imaging studies were uniformly re-sampled to a slice thickness and spacing of 1.5\u2009mm using Aquarius iNtuition Viewer (TeraRecon Inc., 2012). Axial and coronal symmetry, defined anatomically by the longitudinal cerebral fissure, was also established for each imaging series using Aquarius to correct varying gantry tilt and angle of entry into the CT scanner. In cases with significant midline shift secondary to intracranial pathology, the visualized frontal and occipital anatomical landmarks (e.g., connection points between falx cerebri and skull) were used to anchor data symmetry from the anatomical midline.\n\nSubject selection\nAll 881 baseline scans were reviewed by a central neuroradiologist, and the largest hemorrhagic lesion present on each was identified. Bleeds were grouped into three phenotypic subtypes: solitary intraparenchymal hematoma (IPH), multifocal traumatic contusions (TC), and extra-axial hematoma (subdural hematoma [SDH] and epidural hematoma [EDH]). Solitary IPH were distinguished from TC based on distribution of hemorrhagic foci within the lesion; solitary lesions composed uniformly of blood without interspersed edema were classified as IPH, whereas lesions involving multiple foci of blood in close proximity with or without adjacent edema were classified as contusions. Cases negative for acute intracranial pathology, or in which the largest hemorrhagic lesion did not fall into one of these phenotypic categories (e.g., isolated subarachnoid or intraventricular hemorrhages), were excluded.\n\nVolume measurement\nThe central neuroradiologist managing the ProTECTIII imaging repository, who was, blinded to CAV measurements, derived ABC/2 calculations for each lesion by measuring the longest apparent intra-lesional diameter in the axial plane (A), the longest in-plane orthogonal axis (B), and the z-dimension extent of the hemorrhage (C) (\nFig. 1\n).\n3\n,\n4\nThe \u201cC\u201d dimension was calculated as the number of slices on which the lesion appears multiplied by the sum of slice thickness and inter-slice spacing. When deriving ABC/2 calculations for mixed-density contusions, the central neuroradiologist included both edematous and hemorrhagic components to yield a single volume measurement.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExamples of ABC/2, the current standard method for estimation of intracranial hemorrhage volume, applied to traumatic\n(A)\nsubdural hematoma and\n(B)\nsolitary intraparenchymal hematoma. The orthogonal anterior-posterior and lateral axes, indicated as \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d respectively, are overlaid on a right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage to approximate its maximal in-plane dimensions. Volumetric ABC/2 measure (in cubic centimeters) is then computed by multiplying these two dimensions by the z-dimension extent of the bleed (i.e., slice thickness\u2009\u00d7\u2009number of slices containing hemorrhage), or \u201cC,\u201d and dividing by 2; hence, volume\u2009=\u2009(A\u2009\u00d7\u2009B\u2009\u00d7\u2009C) / 2\n3D Slicer, Version 4 (Brigham & Women's Hospital, 2012) was used for semi-automated volume quantification of each hemorrhagic lesion of interest.\n19\nTrained research associates blinded to ABC/2 measurements manually delineated the boundaries of the lesion on each 1.5\u2009mm CT slice using the \u201cPencil\u201d tool in 3D Slicer's \u201cEditor\u201d module. \u201cModel Maker\u201d was then used to generate a 3D surface representation from the two-dimensional (2D) boundary labels for each slice. All segmentations were reviewed and edited as necessary by a single research associate to ensure methodological standardization.\nBecause of the spatially distributed nature of hemorrhagic foci within TCs, the methodology was refined to model these lesions. In 3D Slicer, Hounsfield Unit (HU) signal intensity thresholds were applied using the \u201cPaintEffect\u201d tool and adjusted manually for each scan to ensure that labels accurately identified the boundaries of the focal hemorrhage and edema. Specific HU ranges are outlined in\nTable 1\n. Segmentations were generated by using either the \u201cPaintEffect\u201d or \u201cPencil\u201d tools to apply the selected thresholds and shade the area of affected tissue. Resultant highlighted regions were inspected visually to ensure that all edematous and hemorrhagic foci were shaded, and that normal tissue was not. If necessary, the threshold values were adjusted, and this process was repeated until the hemorrhagic and edematous components were shaded distinctly and completed on each slice. The CAV process and results are illustrated by\nFigures 2\nand\n\u200b\nand3\n3\nfor the four lesion phenotypes considered.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nExample of hemorrhagic contusion segmentation using computer-assisted volumetry (CAV)\n(A).\nBaseline computed tomography (CT) scan of a subject with a large traumatic right temporal hemorrhagic contusion with surrounding vasogenic edema\n(B).\nTwo-dimensional label resulting from Hounsfield Unit (HU) thresholding and the Paint Tool in the Editor module of 3D Slicer, v4.5\n(C).\nThree-dimensional visualization of hemorrhagic contusion within reconstructed cranium rendered, again using 3D Slicer\n(D).\nThree-dimensional visualization of hemorrhagic contusion surface topography, isolated from surrounding tissue; green represents blood, and purple represents edema.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nExamples of computer-assisted volumetry (CAV) methodology for intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) and extra-axial bleed phenotypes, employing largest bleed analysis for volumetric quantification in 3D Slicer.

The identity lines overlaid on the plots demonstrate perfect agreement between methods. Agreement was assessed via Bland\u2013Altman, which evaluates the difference between methods as a function of the mean derived from each method. If there was no association between the difference and the mean, then the relative bias (RB) was estimated by the mean of the difference between the methods, and significance determined via paired\nt\ntest. If there was an association between the difference and the mean, the difference was regressed on the mean in order to evaluate the change in bias as a function of the size of the measurements, as reported by Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC). If necessary to address the assumption of residual normality, the original volume measurements were transformed prior to interpreting the results of the regression model.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nResults of agreement analysis between ABC/2 and computer-assisted volumetry in solitary intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) (\nn\n=\u200943).

ABC/2 volume is on the x-axis, and CAV is on the y-axis. The solid line depicts perfect agreement between methods.\nThe relationship between volume as measured by ABC/2 versus CAV and 6-month patient outcome was assessed using ordinal linear regression. Predictive value of ABC/2 versus CAV was assessed using AUC analysis. To provide additional comparison of outcome prediction between the volume measurements derived in this study and existing outcome prediction systems, similar AUC analyses were performed for the Marshall and Rotterdam scores derived from baseline CT for each case included in this study. Six-month outcome variables included mortality, Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale - Extended (GOS-E), and Disability Rating Scale (DRS) collected prospectively during ProTECTIII. Six-month disability was defined as GOS-E \u2264 5 or DRS \u22656. Statistical analyses were carried out in Python (v3.6.5) and R (v3.4.2).\n\nInstitutional Review Board (IRB) authorization\nWaiver of consent for retrospective analysis of these prospectively collected data was granted by the local IRB (#783509).

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Indiana University School of Medicine. Wild-type C57BL/6J (Jax #000664; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) mice at 5\u20137 weeks of age (\u223c20\u201325\u2009g) were divided into sham and injury groups. For slice-imaging experiments, GCaMP6f (Jax #024276; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) transgenic mice at 5\u20137 weeks of age were divided into multiple groups for different time points after mTBI.\n\nPreparation of mild traumatic brain injury model\nmTBI was created using a technique described recently.\n16\n,\n17\nBefore injury, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (87.7\u2009mg/mL) and xylazine (12.3\u2009mg/mL) and placed in a stereotaxic frame. A heating pad was placed underneath their abdomen to maintain body temperature. The scalp of a mouse was removed to expose the skull between the bregma and lamda positions. The periosteum of the skull was removed and cleaned thoroughly and dried with air flow for \u223c20\u2009sec. A thin layer of cryanoacrylate glue was applied to cover the exposed skull. After the mouse head was stereotactically fixed, a closed-head mTBI was produced using a control cortical impact (CCI) device with a modified impactor tip by attaching a 3-mm-diameter round silicone tip of 1.5\u2009mm in thickness on it (Benchmark Stereotaxic Impactor; Leica Impactor One; Meyer Instrument, St. Louis, MO). After the baseline point of the device was set by lowering the tip to the skull surface and stage position was set to zero, the impactor was retracted and impact depth was set. The approximate center of the impact site was 1\u2009mm posterior to the bregma and 0.5\u2009mm lateral from the midline on one cortical hemisphere. The skull was hit with the impactor tip at a speed of 4\u2009m/s to a depth of 2\u2009mm. All animals survived the injury without any skull fracture or hemorrhage.\n\nIn vivo\noptogenetic mapping of motor cortex\nOptogenetic mapping of bilateral motor cortex was made using a previously described technique.\n5\nBriefly, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (83.85\u2009mg/mL) and xylazine (8.15\u2009mg/mL) and fixed in a stereotaxic frame. This modified mixture of ketamine and xylazine was used for\nin vivo\nmotor mapping because it allowed us to keep the mice in a shallow anesthetic state, but without completely blocking motor response, as the usual concentrations of ketamine and xylazine do. Mice were maintained in an anesthetic level such that they were motionless, but responsive to tail pinch, throughout the course of experiment. An optogenetic mapping setup was used to control the scanning of a 470-nm laser (5\u2009ms duration) on the skull. Each mapping region consisted of a rectangular grid of 5\u2009\u00d7\u20096 spots with 300-\u03bcm spacing between adjacent spots (1.5-by-1.8\u2009mm). Laser pulses were applied onto each spot at a random order until all spots were covered.\nMapping area of each cortical hemisphere consisted of six mapping grids, with a total dimension of 4500\u2009\u00d7\u20093600\u2009\u03bcm. Evoked electromyogram (EMG) was recorded with an electrode inserted into anterior biceps brachii of the contralateral forelimb. Signals were amplified using a DP-304 Differential Amplifier (Warner Instrument Corp, Hamden, CT), digitized with a DigiData acquisition system (model 1550B; Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA), and recorded in pClamp 9 (Axon Instruments, Molecular Devices). For each animal, each cortical region was mapped repeatedly three times, and spots with two or three responses were counted as active spots. Spots with zero responses or one response was considered as unresponsive.\nEMG responses were detected and analyzed using Detector Analysis software.\n5\nThe amplitude for each stimulated spot was averaged from the amplitudes of two or three repetitions. Numbers of active spots were obtained by counting the spots that produced EMG responses. Average EMG amplitudes with respect to the anterior-to-posterior and medial-to-lateral axes were calculated by averaging all response amplitudes for all active spots along the direction of interest. Motor cortical activity maps were constructed with OriginPro (version 9.1; OriginLab, Northampton, MA).\n\nCortical slice preparation\nGCamp6 mice were anesthetized with 78\u2009mg/kg of ketamine and 22\u2009mg/kg of xylazine (intraperitoneally) and decapitated with scissors. After the scalp was removed, the skull was cut along the midsagittal line, and the two flaps of bone covering both brain hemispheres were removed. The brain was then taken out and immediately placed in an ice-cold 4\u00b0C oxygenated sucrose artificial cerebral spinal fluid (s-ACSF) solution (206\u2009mM of sucrose, 2\u2009mM of KCl, 1\u2009mM of MgCl\n2\n, 2\u2009mM of MgSO\n4\n, 1.25\u2009mM of NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 26\u2009mM of NaHCO\n3\n, 10\u2009mM of\nd\n-glucose, and 1\u2009mM of CaCl\n2\n). After 1\u20132\u2009min, the brain was glued onto a cutting stage such that the cortex faced the approaching blade. A piece of agarose gel was used as a cushion against the ventral part of the brain to prevent movement while cutting. Slices of 350-\u03bcm-thick were cut with a Vibratome (Leica VT1200S; Leica, Nusslock, Germany) whereas the brain was submerged in a 4\u00b0C cutting solution. Slices were then incubated at 32\u00b0C for 1\u2009h in a gridded chamber filled with oxygenated incubating ACSF (124\u2009mM of NaCl, 3\u2009mM of KCl, 2\u2009mM of MgSO\n4\n, 1.25\u2009mM of NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 26\u2009mM of NaHCO\n3\n, 10\u2009mM of\nd\n-glucose, and 1\u2009mM of CaCl\n2\n). Each slice was kept in a grid of the chamber for up to 4\u2009h during an experiment.\n\nCalcium imaging of spontaneous and glutamate uncaging-induced activities of cortical slices\nA custom-built recording chamber was made by attaching a temperature-control heated well (Thermal Well Temperature Controller TC-100; BioScience Tools, San Diego, CA) onto a cover-slip. A liquid inflow tubing and a vacuum outflow tubing were installed to generate ACSF circulation through the chamber. A cortical slice was placed in the chamber and secured with a metal ring. Calcium activities of the slice was imaged with a system consisting of a Leica DM6000 FS upright microscope with a Leica EL-6000 120W mercury fluorescence light source directed through a 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009water submerge objective. Videos were captured with an iXON EMCCD DU-88U camera system (Andor USA, Concord, MA). Cortical layers 2 and 3 and layer 5 of the slices were imaged in one of the following conditions: 1) high-potassium ACSF (124\u2009mM of NaCl, 5\u2009mM of KCl, 2\u2009mM of MgSO\n4\n, 1.25\u2009mM of NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 26\u2009mM of NaHCO\n3\n, 10\u2009mM of\nd\n-glucose, and 1\u2009mM of CaCl\n2\n); 2) regular ACSF with 20\u2009\u03bcM of bicuculline; 3) regular ACSF with 20\u2009\u03bcM of bicuculline/20\u2009\u03bcM of DNQX; or 4) regular ACSF with 20\u2009\u03bcM of bicuculline/50\u2009\u03bcM of AP5.\nTo use glutamate uncaging to evoke neuronal activity in cortical slices, a frequency tripled Nd: YVO\n4\nUV laser (series 3500 pulse laser, \u223c1 W, 100 KHz repetition rate; DPSS Laser, San Jose, CA) was interfaced with a fiber optic submerged in the slice recording chamber and pointed directly at a cortical area on the slice. A solution of 100\u2009\u03bcM of Montreal Neurological Institute\u2013caged glutamate (4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl-caged\nl\n-glutamate; Toris Bioscience, Minneapolis, MN) in ACSF was used in each experiment. Focal photolysis of caged glutamate was accomplished by switching the UV laser to give a 400- to 800-\u03bcs light stimulus.\n\nAnalysis of calcium imaging data\nVideos of calcium imaging were analyzed\npost hoc\nusing ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) with a Time Series Analyzer plugin (Balaji J. UCLA). Only active cells that produced calcium fluorescence flashes at least once during an imaging period were analyzed. For each individual cell, the soma was manually circled, and three separate background regions were chosen by drawing circles of the same diameter in the surrounding area. Selected background areas did not include any dendrites or other neuronal structures. The true calcium fluorescence signal of a cell body or dendrites \u0394F/F was calculated with an equation (\nEquation 1\n) excerpted from Chen and colleagues\n18\nthat was developed by Kerlin and colleagues\n19\n:\n\u0394\nF\nF\n=\nF\nt\nr\nu\ne\n\u2212\nF\nB\nF\nB\na\nn\nd\nF\nt\nr\nu\ne\n=\nF\nc\ne\nl\nl\n\u2212\nr\n\u2217\nF\nB\n(1)\nwhere\nF\nB\nis the baseline fluorescence averaged over three different regions surrounding the cell of interest and\nr\nis the contamination ratio standard constant 0.7. These data were then used to construct calcium transient profiles using OriginPro software (version 9.1; OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Peak amplitudes, frequencies, and durations were obtained with a Peak Analysis toolbox of OriginPro 9.1. In short, responding peaks were picked first by setting a minimum response threshold of 20% with respect to the highest amplitude peak of that spectrum. Selected peaks were then compared with its corresponding video to confirm calcium activities. Peak analysis toolbox then calculated the amplitudes, frequencies, and durations at half maximum height for all events in the spectrum.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFinal plots were developed in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA), and values are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). All statistical analyses were done with JMP Analysis (version 11; SAS Institute Inc. 2013; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and GraphPad Prism (version 6; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses were used for comparing numbers of total active spots of optogenetic mapping data (repeated-measures ANOVA), response amplitudes of motor maps (one-way), and amplitudes, frequencies, and durations of calcium imaging data (one-way) and for comparing calcium amplitudes, frequencies, and durations among control, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX)-, and amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5)-treated groups (two-way). For comparisons that yield statistical significances, Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD)\npost hoc\nanalyses were applied for further comparisons between specific groups. For glutamate uncaging data, a Pearson's chi-square frequency test was used to compare percentages of active cells among groups at different time points after mTBI."

    "Methods": "Study cohort\nThis is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from patients with PBI admitted to a single Illinois Department of Public Health Level I trauma center. Our institution maintained Level I trauma accreditation during the entire duration of the study. The institutional review board approved the study protocol under IRB-19-0220. Inclusion criteria for the study were: 1) presenting diagnosis of PBI and 2) age \u226516 years. Exclusion criteria were: 1) dead on arrival, 2) absence of dural penetration on imaging, and 3) absence of CCTs within 3\u2009h of presentation.\n\nData collection\nFor each patient, data regarding demographics, clinical presentation, GCS score after initial resuscitation, computed tomography scan of the head (HCT) on admission, Injury Severity Score (ISS), laboratory studies, hospital length of stay (LOS), Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended (GOSE) at the time of discharge, and discharge disposition were reviewed. The GCS recorded was based on the initial neurocritical care or neurosurgical evaluation in the trauma bay after initial hemodynamic stabilization; neurological evaluation was performed off sedation and after excluding residual neuromuscular blockade. In the absence of a universally accepted definition for coagulopathy after TBI, we defined coagulopathy according to previous studies' cutoffs, and based on local institutional laboratory ranges, as the presence of any of the following: INR >1.3, platelet count <100,000 /\u03bcL, or PTT >37\u2009sec. The coagulation profile was documented on arrival to the emergency department (within 3\u2009h) and at 24\u2009h for all included patients. Of note, blood samples are sent on arrival and typically before transfusions. On the other hand, transfusions are given as guided by clinical condition at the trauma attending's discretion often before the coagulation labs result is received.\nHCT images were first interpreted by a board-certified neuroradiologist and subsequently reviewed and classified by two neurocritical care fellows (A.L. and F.A.). Cisternal effacement was determined if all basal cisterns were completely effaced.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics are presented as means with standard deviations (SDs) or medians with interquartile ranges (IQR\u2009=\u2009Q3\u2013Q1) for continuous variables and as percentages for categorical variables. Comparisons between coagulopathic and non-coagulopathic groups were made using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests or two-sample\nt\ntests. Categorical variables were compared by chi-square (\u03c7\n2\n) or Fisher's exact test. Multi-variable logistic regression was used to investigate interactions between GCS and coagulopathy. All analyses were performed with the use of R (version 3.6.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and Stata software (version 16.1; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX)."

    "Methods": "Data collection\nThe study was conducted as a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database cohort (2009\u20132018) in which physiological monitoring data had been archived in three different hospitals: Department of Neurosurgery, Charite Hospital, Berlin, Germany; Department of Intensive Care, University Hospital, Tromso, Norway, and Neurocritical Care, Addenbrooke's University Hospital, Cambridge. Monitoring was conducted using ICM+\n\u00ae\nsoftware (Cambridge Enterprise, Ltd, Cambridge, UK,\nwww.icmplus.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk\n).\nAcute brain-injured patients with a clinical need for ICP monitoring and computerized signal were included. The monitoring was part of standard patient care and archived in an anonymized way. All demographic/clinical data were extracted from the hospital records and were anonymized fully, no data on patient identifiers were available, and therefore formal patient or proxy consent and institutional ethics approval were not obtainable. Institutional reviewing was not required because of the retrospective design of the study that consisted of the analysis of data acquired during routine care.\nPatients were monitored with at least invasive intraparenchymal ICP, invasive ABP, and ECG. There were 61 patients with RIH selected initially, and 37 were excluded because of either the absence of the ECG signal, frequent artefacts, or absence of baseline ICP recording before RIH evolved, which was crucial for dynamic analysis of ANS behavior. Therefore, 24 patients with ABI were included in the final analysis. The patients in whom RIH developed had an initial baseline of ICP (mean ICP <20) followed by a rise to more than 40\u2009mm Hg and then either fulfilled criteria of brain death or died after the withdrawal of treatment or cardiac arrest.\n\nData processing\nThe signals were acquired digitally with a sampling frequency of at least 100\u2009Hz. The time-averaged values of ICP and ABP were calculated on a 10-sec calculation window. The PRx was calculated as the moving Pearson correlation between ABP and ICP of a 5\u2009min window, updated every minute.\n28\nThe amplitude (AMP) of the cardiac pulse in ICP and ABP were determined as the fundamental harmonic of the Fourier transform of the pulse of ICP. The right arterial pressure (RAP) was calculated as the moving correlation coefficient between slow changes in ICP pulse AMP and mean ICP (10\u2009sec average data) over a period of 5\u2009min, updating every minute.\n29\nThe artefacts were cleaned manually in the raw data: in the ABP and ICP signal, the non-pulsatile chunks were removed. From the ECG, long, visible arrhythmic events and flat lines were removed manually; single ectopic beats were automatically detected by the software.\nFor each patient, the recording was divided into three different segments: the first was called \u201cbaseline\u201d or period one (P1) in which the ICP mean was lower than 20\u2009mm Hg; the second period (P2) was the period during which the ICP started to rise, more or less continuously, until the elevated value of ICP. The third period (P3) was defined starting from the ICP/AMP \u201cupper breakpoint\u201d onward.\n6\n,\n30\nThe upper breakpoint is a value of ICP and AMP of ICP above which pulse AMP started to decrease with an ongoing increase in the mean ICP. If the upper breakpoint was not found, the second period ended with the end of the recording when dramatic values of ICP were reached and which was followed by patient death.\n\nAutonomic variable calculation\nSecondary parameters reflecting autonomic activity were computed in time and frequency domain through the continuous measurements of HRV. According to the guidelines,\n18\nwe analyzed HRV both in the time and in the frequency domain.\nThe analysis of oscillatory components of the ECG signal enables the assessment of the autonomic system because it is the primary regulator of cardiac chronotropy.\n31\n,\n32\nThe interval between R waves in the ECG is the most commonly used to represent cardiac chronotropy and can be analyzed both in the time domain and/or in the frequency domain.\nIn time domain, we analyzed global indexes of HRV such as standard deviation (SD), the standard deviation of the difference between sequential beats (SDSD), and square root of the mean squared difference between sequential beats (RMSSD). In the frequency domain, we calculated the total power of the HRV spectrum; moreover, we calculated frequency-specific indexes. The high-frequency (HF) component (0.15\u20130.4\u2009Hz) is thought to be modulated by the parasympathetic system, whereas the low-frequency (LF) component (0.04\u20130.15Hz) is modulated by both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic system. The ratio between the two (LF/HF ratio) seems to mirror the sympathetic activity.\n33\n,\n18\nThe HRV in the time domain was analyzed using a 300-sec time series of R-R intervals that were updated every 10\u2009sec. In the frequency domain, the Lomb-Scargle periodogram was used to calculate the spectral power of the R-R interval time series.\n18\nBaroreflex sensitivity, which can be described as the magnitude of response in the heart-beat interval to a change in blood pressure, was measured using the cross-correlation method, which had been shown to have the lowest intra- and inter-individual variability in the EUROBAVAR database.\n34\nThe x-BRS calculation algorithm was implemented into the ICM+ software using a 10-sec window moving along the time axis. To remove the influence of an unknown time delay of the baroreceptor response, a cross-correlation function was used to maximize the correlation coefficient, which meant that the actual total window length used in each calculation was 17\u2009sec. Valid x-BRS was returned only if the correlation coefficient is significant at\np\n<\u20090.01.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe R statistical language was used to perform the statistical analysis (R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.\nwww.R-project.org\n/version 3.3.3). Alpha was set at 0.05 for significance.\nThe non-normal distribution of the data was established by the Shapiro-Wilk test.\n35\nThe Wilcoxon test was used for comparisons after having extracted variables as mean value\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD during the three different periods. The correlation between physiologic parameters was assessed using the Spearman method.\nFor establishing the direction of potential causal interactions in the time series, we used the model developed by Granger\n36\ncapable of causal inference. Understanding not only functional connectivity but also directional connectivity is becoming more and more important and popular, particularly in neuroscience.\n37\nGranger causality is a statistical method for identifying the significance of directional information flow between a given set of time series. According to Granger, a time series X is called to Granger-cause another time series Y if the past value of X contains information that helps to predict future values of Y. The Granger test was applied to stationary time series between ICP and autonomic variables during P1 and P2. The calculation of the directionality index (DI) was then applied."

    "Methods": "OBTT studies (including testing of GLY reported in this article) were executed under a standardized paradigm, including animals, models, outcome metrics, and blinding protocols.48General methodological details for this study are identical to those presented in earlier OBTT publications and are summarized below.48,49Nuances specific to GLY are emphasized and include pharmacokinetic testing, glucose-level determination, and measurement of cerebral edema as secondary outcomes.\n\nAnimals\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (270\u2013320\u2009g) were used for all experiments. Rats were housed individually under a 12-h light/dark cycle. All procedures were approved by each institution's individual institutional animal care and use committee and by the Animal Care and Use Review Office, U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command. Experiments were conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and adhered to the principles stated in the\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n(National Research Council, Washington, D.C.) and other federal statutes and regulations relating to experiments involving animals.\n\nAnimal models\nFluid percussion injury model, University of Miami\nAs previously described, rats were anesthetized with 70% N\n2\nO, 1\u20133% isoflurane, and 30% O\n2\n24\u2009h before injury and surgically prepared for parasagittal FPI.\n48\n,\n49\nA 4.8-mm craniotomy was performed 3.8\u2009mm posterior to bregma and 2.5\u2009mm lateral to midline. A plastic injury tube was placed over the exposed dura and affixed to the skull with adhesive and dental acrylic. The scalp was subsequently sutured closed, and rats were allowed to recover before returning to their cages. After fasting overnight, rats were reanesthetized with the aforementioned gas mixture, tracheally intubated, mechanically ventilated, and had catheters inserted into the tail artery (to monitor arterial blood pressure and blood gases) and the jugular vein (blood sampling for biomarker analysis). They were then subjected to the FPI, which entailed a pressure pulse of moderate (1.8\u20132.2 atm) intensity.\n50\nAfter TBI, rats were returned to their home cages with food and water available\nad libitum\n. Sham rats underwent all procedures except FPI.\nAs in previous OBTT studies, FPI served as the sentinel model to assess effects of therapies on acute physiological parameters, including hemodynamics and blood gases. Arterial blood gas levels were obtained 15\u2009min pre- and post-FPI. Brain temperature was measured indirectly by a thermistor probe placed in the right temporalis muscle. Core temperature was measured by rectal thermistor probe.\nControlled cortical impact model, University of Pittsburgh\nRats were anesthetized (4% isoflurane in 2:1\u2009N\n2\nO/O\n2\n) and tracheally intubated with a 14-gauge angiocatheter. Anesthesia was maintained using 2% isoflurane in 2:1\u2009N\n2\nO/O\n2\n. After intubation, rats were mechanically ventilated and placed on a thermal blanket to regulate body temperature (37\u00b0C) with the head placed in a stereotaxic frame. A parasagittal craniectomy (anteroposterior [AP] center of craniectomy, +4.0\u2009mm; lateral, +2.8\u2009mm from lambda) 8\u2009mm in diameter was performed to expose the brain to allow access for the impactor tip of the CCI device (Pittsburgh Precision Instruments, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). CCI was performed at a depth of 2.6\u2009mm at 4\u2009m/s.\n51\nAfter CCI, the surgical site was closed by silk sutures, and rat recovery was monitored by measuring tail pinch and righting reflexes. Sham rats underwent all procedures except CCI.\nPenetrating ballistic-like brain injury model, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research\nSurgical procedures were performed using isoflurane anesthesia (3\u20135% for induction and 2% for maintenance by nose cone) with aseptic conditions and monitoring of physiological vital signs. PBBI was executed as previously reported.\n52\nAnesthetized rats were placed on a thermal blanket to regulate body temperature (37\u00b0C), and the head was secured in the stereotaxic device to insert the PBBI probe. After a midline scalp incision, a right frontal cranial window (diameter\u2009=\u20094\u2009mm) was created using a dental drill to expose the right frontal pole (+4.5\u2009mm AP, +2\u2009mm mediolateral to bregma). The PBBI probe was advanced through the cranial window into the right hemisphere to a depth of 1.2\u2009cm from the brain surface. Once the probe was in place, the pulse generator was activated by a computer to release a pressure pulse calibrated to produce a rapid expansion of the water-filled elastic tubing that induced an elliptically shaped balloon (diameter\u2009=\u20090.633\u2009mm, duration\u2009=\u200940\u2009ms) to a volume equal to 10% of total brain volume. After deflation, the probe was manually retracted from the brain, and the cranial opening was sealed with sterile bone wax. The skin incision was closed with wound clips. Sham rats underwent all procedures except insertion of the PBBI probe.\n\nDrug administration\nGLY was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog number, G2539; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). A stock solution of 2.5\u2009\u03bcg/\u03bcL of GLY was made weekly in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at room temperature (RT). In all models, a loading dose was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.), followed by a 7-day maintenance infusion using subcutaneous (s.c.) miniosmotic pumps (Alzet 2001; Alzet Corp, Cupertino, CA). Specifically, the loading dose was prepared by adding 4\u2009\u03bcL of stock solution to 1\u2009mL of sterile unbuffered normal saline (NS). In all models, the loading-dose solution (10\u2009\u03bcg/kg) was given i.p. 10\u2009min post-injury. The maintenance dose was a 7-day continuous s.c. infusion at 0.2\u2009\u03bcg/h (using Alzet miniosmotic pumps). Pumps were loaded with 4\u2009\u03bcL of 10-N Fixanal solution, 2.3\u2009mL of sterile NS, and 200\u2009\u03bcL of GLY stock solution.\nVehicle solutions were made with DMSO, NS, and Fixanal exactly as described above; however, GLY stock solution was omitted. Pumps were filled with a measured volume of solution (222\u2013238\u2009\u03bcL), with volume confirmed by the difference in mass before and after loading. Pumps were then primed overnight in sterile NS at 37\u00b0C to allow drug delivery immediately upon placement. Pumps were inserted s.c. immediately after the i.p. bolus. At each study site, drug was prepared and coded by persons other than those who performed the injury and/or outcome assessments.\nTable 1\nsummarizes experimental group sizes for each site and TBI model.\nTable 1.\nSummary of Experimental Group Sizes for Traumatic Brain Injury/Glibenclamide Study\na,b,c\nGroup\nSham\nTBI-vehicle\nTBI treated\nN\nFPI, Miami\n15\n15\n15\n45\nCCI, Pittsburgh\n10\n10\n10\n30\nPBBI, WRAIR\n12\n12\n12\n36\nOpen in a separate window\nN\nindicates sample size.\na\nSeparate sham rats, treated, and vehicle (\nn\n=\u20095 per group) were studied for serial monitoring of plasma levels of glibenclamide and serial assessment of blood glucose.

See text for details.\nFPI, fluid percussion injury; CCI, controlled cortical impact; PBBI, penetrating ballistic-like brain injury; WRAIR, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research; TBI, traumatic brain injury; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nBiomarker blood sample preparation\nDetails of the biomarker methods were previously described in earlier OBTT publications and are briefly summarized here.\n53\nBlood samples (0.7\u2009mL) were collected at 1, 4, and 24\u2009h post-injury and at the 21-day terminal end-point. Samples were collected from the jugular catheter in FPI and PBBI and from the tail artery using a heparinized syringe in CCI. Terminal samples were collected by cardiac puncture for all models. Immediately after collection, blood samples were transferred to 1.2-mL serum clotting tubes, stored at RT for 60\u2009min (to allow clotting), and then placed on ice (to prevent protein degradation) until all samples were ready for centrifugation. Tubes were centrifuged at 5000\ng\n(RT) for 5\u2009min. The supernatant was transferred into sterile 1.2-mL Eppendorf tubes, snap-frozen on dry ice, and stored at \u201380\u00b0C, pending analysis. Each sample was coded for study site, rat number, and sample collection time. Samples were shipped by FedEx priority overnight (on dry ice) to Banyan Biomarkers (Alachua, FL), where they were processed to detect ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase-1 (UCH-L1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).\n49\n,\n54\u201356\n\nOutcome metrics\nPer the standardized paradigm of OBTT, the primary outcome metrics for this study are identical for all OBTT studies and are detailed in the introductory article of the 2016 special issue of the\nJournal of Neurotrauma\n.\n48\nThese are summarized briefly for the FPI, CCI, and PBBI models: 1) Sensorimotor, 2) Cognitive, 3) Neuropathology, and 4) Biomarkers. Given the previously reported benefit of GLY on cerebral edema by means of putative inhibition of the Sur1-Trpm4 channel,\n13\n,\n15\n,\n33\n,\n39\n,\n44\npercent brain water (%BW), as a secondary outcome, was assessed at 24\u2009h in the CCI model.\n\nPrimary end-points\nSensorimotor testing\nFluid percussion injury model\nSpontaneous forelimb use was measured using the forelimb asymmetry task.\n49\n,\n57\nBaseline measures were recorded immediately before FPI and again at 7 days post-injury. The number of times the rat placed either its right (ipsilateral to injury), left (contralateral to injury), or both forelimbs on the cylinder wall during rearing episodes was scored. Data were normalized using the following formula: Index of Asymmetry (IA)\u2009=\u2009(contra)/(ipsi + contra). The grid-walk task assessed fore- and hindlimb sensorimotor integration at 7 days post-injury. Rats were placed on a wire grid (25-mm square openings) for 5\u2009min. The number of foot-faults per limb was recorded and expressed as a percentage of the total number of steps taken using that limb.\nControlled cortical impact model\nGross vestibulomotor function was assessed on a beam-balance task recording the amount of time the rat remained on an elevated, 1.5-cm-wide wooden beam (maximum\u2009=\u200960\u2009sec). Rats were trained, and baseline performance was assessed the day before CCI. Fine vestibulomotor function and coordination were assessed using a modified beam-walking task that used aversive stimuli (i.e., bright light/loud noise) to motivate rats to traverse the beam and reach a darkened goal box.\n58\nLatency to traverse the beam was recorded. Rats were given three trials per day with a 30-sec intertrial interval (ITI) at 1 day before CCI (pre-injury baseline) and daily for 5 days post-CCI. The primary outcome measure for this task was mean latency (three trials) to traverse the beam.\nPenetrating ballistic-like brain injury model\nNeurological deficits were evaluated at 30\u2009min and 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days post-injury using a modified battery of tests.\n59\nNeurological scores were based on a 12-point sliding scale ranging from 0 (normal) to 12 (severely impaired). These were recorded for 1) contralateral forelimb flexion during tail suspension, 2) shoulder adduction (body upward curling behavior) during tail suspension, 3) open-field circling behavior, and 4) impaired resistance to lateral push (maximum score for each component\u2009=\u20093). Motor coordination and balance were evaluated using a fixed-speed rotarod task, with the outcome measure for this task being mean latency (two trials) to fall during each successive speed increment (10, 15, and 20\u2009rpm).\n49\n,\n52\nCognitive testing\nThe Morris water maze (MWM) was used for cognitive testing at each site.\n39\n,\n40\nAll trials were digitally recorded for computer-software\u2013assisted analysis.\nFluid percussion injury model\nSpatial learning performance was assessed from 13 to 16 d post-injury consisting of four trials per day with a 60-sec duration, 10-sec reinforcement, and 4-min ITI. Primary outcome metrics consisted of latency to locate the hidden platform and swim distance. Rats were tested for retention of the hidden platform location in a probe (missing platform) trial at 17 days post-injury.\nWorking memory was evaluated on post-injury days 20 and 21. Rats were given 60\u2009sec to find a submerged (non-cued) platform. If the rat failed to locate the platform within 60\u2009sec, it was placed on the platform for 10\u2009sec. Five sec after trial 1 (Location) for the same rat, a second identical trial (Match) was conducted. Rats were placed under a heat lamp for 4\u2009min between each paired trial. After running the group of rats as above, the platform was moved to the next location of the maze and the procedure was repeated with this location. Five paired trials were given for each rat on each testing day.\nControlled cortical impact model\nSpatial learning performance was assessed from 14 to 18 days post-injury. Rats were given four trials per day with a 60-sec duration, 10-sec reinforcement, and 4-min ITI. Latency to locate the hidden platform was the primary outcome measure. Rats were tested for retention of the hidden platform location in a probe (missing platform) trial at 21 days post-injury. Rats were then tested on a visible platform task for 2 additional days (days 19\u201320) where the platform was raised 2\u2009cm above the water's surface. The visible platform task was used as a control procedure to determine the contributions of non-spatial factors (sensorimotor performance, motivation, and visual acuity) on MWM performance.\nPenetrating ballistic-like brain injury model\nSpatial learning performance was assessed from 13 to 17 days post-TBI. Rats were given four trials per day with a 90-sec duration, 10-sec reinforcement, and 30-min ITI. Primary outcome metrics consisted of latency to locate the hidden platform and thigmotaxic (wall-hugging) behavior. Rats were tested for retention of the hidden platform location in a probe (missing platform) trial at 19 days post-injury.\nHistopathological assessment\nRats were terminally anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 4% (FPI and PBBI) or 10% (CCI) phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde at 21 days post-injury using previously established protocols at each site. Brains were processed for paraffin embedding/slicing (FPI and CCI) or frozen sectioning (PBBI) as previously described.\n48\n,\n49\nSerial 1-mm coronally sliced serial sections were processed with hematoxylin and eosin for quantitative volumetric analysis.\n48\n,\n49\nLesion volume (mm\n3\n) was calculated by measuring the area of the lesion (mm\n2\n) and multiplying the sum of the lesioned areas obtained from each section by the intersection distance. Ipsi- and contralateral hemispheric tissue volume (CCI and PBBI) or cortical tissue volume (FPI) were quantified using the same approach, again using established protocols at each site. Both lesion- and tissue-volume loss were expressed as a percent of the contralateral (non-injured) hemisphere (CCI and PBBI) or as a percent of the contralateral cortex (FPI), in accordance with the established protocol given the small focal lesions in FPI.\nBiomarker Assessment\nBlood levels of UCH-L1 (neuronal cell body damage marker) and GFAP (astroglial cytoskeletal protein) were measured at 4 and 24\u2009h post-injury.\n48\n,\n53\nPrimary outcome metrics consisted of 1) evaluating effects of GLY on blood biomarker levels at 24\u2009h post-injury and 2) effect of GLY on the difference between 4- and 24-h (delta 24\u20134\u2009h) levels. Rat UCH-L1 and GFAP levels were assayed with sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as previously reported.\n48\n,\n53\u201356\nOperation Brain Trauma Therapy Outcome Scoring Matrix\nAs with all OBTT studies, primary outcome metrics were summarized in an overall outcome scoring matrix\u2014the approach to this has been previously detailed.\n48\nThis was constructed to rank the therapeutic efficacy of individual drugs across OBTT studies. Each therapy tested can generate a maximum of 22 points at each center (with cognitive outcome given the highest weight) and a maximum total score of 66 points across all three models (FPI, CCI, and PBBI).\n\nSecondary end-points\nDrug-level and glucose measurements\nTwo additional studies were performed. For these studies, separate rats from those in the OBTT outcome studies were used to ensure that additional blood sampling or other procedures did not affect any scored outcome. These studies were carried out at the Pittsburgh site in the CCI model and/or shams using the same protocols, including GLY and vehicle dosing, as in the primary experiments described earlier. First, GLY levels were determined in plasma (\nn\n=\u20095/group) in serial samples obtained at 1, 2, 4, 20, and 24\u2009h after the bolus in sham rats administered either GLY or vehicle. GLY plasma levels were quantified by an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)/mass spectrometer with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Given the potential for GLY to cause hypoglycemia, concurrent blood glucose levels were also assessed in these rats using a blood gas analyzer (Model ABL-90; Radiometer America, Westlake, OH). Second, in a second small series (\nn\n=\u20092), we explored the GLY level in CSF and plasma after CCI. For these experiments, plasma (from the jugular vein) and CSF (obtained by cisternal puncture) were collected at 24\u2009h after CCI. The UPLC-MS/MS method used to quantify GLY has been previously described\n39\n,\n60\nand involved liquid-liquid extraction and detection with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.\n\nCerebral edema assessment\nWe also conducted separate studies to test the purported effect of GLY on cerebral edema. The CCI model was selected\npost hoc\nfor these experiments given the more pronounced treatment effect that we observed in this model. Percent brain water (%BW) was quantified in three groups\u2014na\u00efve, CCI plus vehicle treatment, and CCI plus GLY treatment (\nn\n=\u20095 per group)\u2014using the gold-standard wet/dry weight technique.\n43\nRats were decapitated at 24\u2009h after injury (<5% isoflurane and 50/50 gas mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen). Brains were bisected into hemispheres, which were immediately weighed and recorded as wet weights. Hemispheres were subsequently dehydrated for 72\u2009h in an oven (110\u00b0C) and reweighed for dry weights, again using an established protocol. %BW was determined by subtracting the dry from the wet weight, dividing this number by the wet weight, and multiplying by 100.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll parameters (functional, histological, and biomarker) were assessed for normality, and data are expressed as mean (standard error of the mean) or median (interquartile range), as appropriate. Physiological data, blood glucose, lesion and tissue volumes, and probe trial were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or mixed-model regression. One-way ANOVA or repeated-measures ANOVA was used to analyze motor tasks, as appropriate, depending on the specifics of the data collection. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was also used to analyze serial data measurements for the hidden platform and working memory tasks.\nPost hoc\nanalysis, when appropriate, used the Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) test or Tukey's test.\nBased on exploratory analysis, biomarker data were not normally distributed. Delta 24\u20134\u2009h biomarker levels were calculated as the difference between 24- and 4-h levels. This measure of dynamic change in brain-injury markers identifies increases (positive delta) and decreases (negative delta) of levels in this 20-h epoch. Comparison of biomarker levels across groups in each TBI model was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test (in the case of two groups) and the Kruskal-Wallis test (if three groups), followed by\npost hoc\ncomparisons while applying Dunn's test with a Benjamini and Hochberg adjustment. All hypothesis testing was two-tailed, and a\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS (SAS version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and R software (\nhttp://www.r-project.org;\nversion 3.5.1) in RStudio (\nhttp://www.rstudio.com;\nversion 1.1.456)."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nParticipants were recruited from the greater Boston area as part of a 5-year study evaluating post-traumatic headache in youth. An overview of recruitment can be found in\nFigure 1\n. Eligible participants were identified through a PowerChart review of all patients presenting to the Boston Children's Hospital Sports Medicine Clinic at Boston and Waltham, MA. or self-referral via community advertisements and flyers hung around college campuses in the Longwood Medical Area and on Partners HealthCare portal. All PTH patients fulfilled the\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision\ncriteria for mTBI, completed a neurological examination (confirmed by neurologist), and reported to have developed a headache within seven days after mTBI. Patients who had their headache symptoms conclude within 2 weeks to 1 month after the injury and no longer experienced post-concussive headaches after the 1-month mark were placed in the resolved group. Patients who were still experiencing post-concussive headaches past the 1-month mark since injury were placed in the persistent group.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nConsort Diagram showing how participants were included and excluded in this investigation.\nA total of 59 age- and gender-matched subjects (PTH-P\nn\n=\u200921, 14 females; PTH-R\nn\n=\u200918, 11 females; and healthy control subjects\nn\n=\u200920, 10 females) all underwent imaging at Boston Children's Hospital in Waltham, MA. All subjects were right-handed and between ages 12-24 at time of participation with no significant history of pre-existing headaches, chronic pain, or psychiatric neurological conditions (including clinical depression or anxiety). Enrolled participants were screened for drugs of abuse (including for barbiturates, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, tetrahydrocannabinol, etc.) and medications that would interfere with study findings (see\nSupplementary Table 1\nfor list of reported medications at time of visit). The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Boston Children's Hospital and conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent and assent were obtained from all subjects prior to enrollment.\n\nPsychological questionnaires and testing\nAt the time of study visit, each participant met with a physician or registered nurse to review eligibility and concussion symptomology. The following questionnaires were completed by both concussion and control cohorts: Depression (Childhood Depression Inventory (CDI]: age <18); Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; age >18), Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS),\n13\nPubertal Developmental Scale (PDS),\n14\nPain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS),\n15\nChildhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index (CASI),\n16\nFear of Pain Questionnaire (FOPQ),\n17\nPediatric Pain Screening Tool (PPST),\n18\nand IMPACT concussion survey. T-scores were extracted and used from the CDI and BDI and integrated into the Depression metric. T-scores for the BDI were obtained using scoring for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System depression sub-scale. Concussion cohort received two addition questionnaires: the Rivermead Concussion Survey\n19\nand the Allodynia Symptom Checklist (ASC-12)\n20\nto assess for post-concussive symptoms and sensitivity to painful stimuli respectively.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging data acquisition\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected on a 3T Siemens Magnetom TrioTim scanner with a 12-channel phased array head coil (Erlangen, Germany). T1 magnetization-Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient-Echo (MPRAGE) anatomical images were collected using a gradient echo-echo planar pulse sequence with 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009mm resolution. MPRAGE scan parameters consisted of the following: repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20092520\u2009msec; echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20091.74 3.54, 5.34, 7.14\u2009msec; field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009220\u2009\u00d7\u2009220; flip angle (FA)\u2009=\u20097\u00b0; and axial slices\u2009=\u2009176. RS-Fc data were collected using a gradient echo-echo planar pulse sequence with 3.0\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093.0\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093.0\u2009mm resolution. Functional MRI (fMRI) scan parameters consisted of the following: TR\u2009=\u20091100\u2009msec; TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009msec; FOV\u2009=\u2009228\u2009\u00d7\u2009228; FA\u2009=\u200970\u00b0; axial slices\u2009=\u200951; volumes\u2009=\u2009320; and acquisition time\u2009=\u20096\u2009min. Patients were instructed to remain still, clear their mind and keep eyes open during the scan sequence.\n\nFunctional connectivity analysis\nA whole\u2013brain region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI connectivity analysis was performed with the CONN-fMRI fc toolbox v18.b in conjunction with SPM 12 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK;\nwww.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm\n). Pre-processing included: functional realignment, slice-time corrected, spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the normalized EPI template image in SPM, and spatially smoothed with a 5-mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel. Motion parameters from realignment were evaluated and a motion artefact threshold (translation >0.9\u2009mm, rotation >1\u00b0) was employed for exclusion.\n21\nAcquisitions with framewise displacement above 0.9\u2009mm or global blood oxygen level\u2013dependent BOLD signal changes above 5 standard deviations are flagged as potential outliers and were excluded from analysis.\nThe mean level of motion between each group after exclusion was found to be similar among all cohorts (healthy controls\u2009(HC)\u2009=\u20090.19\u2009mm; PTH-P\u2009=\u20090.17\u2009mm; PTH-R\u2009=\u20090.16\u2009mm). BOLD data were bandpass filtered (0.008-0.09\u2009Hz) to reduce low-frequency drift and noise effects. Individual correlation maps were generated in the CONN toolbox by extracting the mean resting-state BOLD time course from each seed ROI and calculating correlation coefficients with the BOLD time course of each voxel throughout the whole brain. The resulting coefficients were converted to normally distributed scores using Fisher's transformation to give maps of voxel-wise functional connectivity for each seed ROI for each subject. To be consistent with the default CONN atlas, we report brain regions and their associated network in parentheses where appropriate. All regions of interest were extracted as part of the pre-loaded CONN toolbox and represent regions outlined in the FSL Harvard-Oxford Atlas and AAL atlas for cerebellar regions.\n\nStructural brain data\nCortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation were performed with Freesurfer (version 5.3) image analysis suite.\n22\u201331\nOnce the cortical models were completed, parcellation of the cerebral cortex into regional units were finished.\n28\n,\n32\nThis method produced representations of cortical thickness and sub-cortical volume.\n25\nFor data analyzed in this study, all surfaces were visually checked, and manual interventions were used as needed to correct small defects.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSample size calculation was performed on the fMRI data as it requires the highest power of the applied modalities. Power calculation was performed using Neuropower for power calculations and a sample data set reported on Neurovault (collection: degrees of lateralization in semantic cognition: evidence from intrinsic connectivity; 196 subjects;\nhttps://identifiers.org/neurovault.image:110828\n) using an 0.05 alpha, independent two-sample comparison, with the current minimum sample size of 39 (lowest combined group total of all contrasts) and a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction factor that produced an expected power of 0.96.\nEach group (PTH-R, PTH-P, and Healthy Controls) were compared with each other for six total tests. Behavioral data analysis used a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) evaluating each dependent variable by group (Healthy control, Resolved, Persistent).\nPost hoc\nanalyses were performed using independent sample t-tests. Resting-state functional connectivity analyses were performed between each group with\na priori\ninterests in comparing both PTH groups to the healthy control group. A total of 164 regions of interest were evaluated for a combined total of 13,366 total connections evaluation. Significance for functional connectivity data was set at the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR level of\np\n<\u20090.05 (or 5% of tested functional connections) and behavioral data was evaluated using the Bonferroni corrected threshold of 0.008 (0.06/6) to adjust for the main behavioral comparisons (PDS, FOPQ, PCS, PPST, Rivermead, and Allodynia). To further explore significant group differences, correlation analysis was performed between questionnaire data and connections that showed significant group differences. ANOVAs were done on structural imaging data from brain regions that showed significant group differences in functional connectivity to explore the impact of volumetric differences driving the functional connectivity results."

    "Methods": "ASC culture and conditioned medium preparation\nASC culture and preparation of concentrated conditioned medium were performed as described by us previously.\n17\nBriefly, ASCs (Lonza, Walkersville, MD; Cat# PT-5006, Lot# 0000535975) were cultured in serum-free media (MEM-alpha) were primed with 20\u2009ng/mL tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 (R&D Systems) and 10\u2009ng/mL interferon \u03b3 (R&D Systems) in basal media for 24\u2009h. ASCs were washed to remove cytokines and then cultured in basal media for an additional 24\u2009h, at which point the conditioned media was collected and concentrated \u223c20\u2009\u00d7\u2009using a 3\u2009kDa molecular weight cutoff Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal-concentrator and desalted. Aliquots were stored at -80\u00b0C and used in assays subsequently.\n\nBlast injury and study groups\nAll studies with blast injury were performed as described by us recently. Animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, UTHSC, Memphis, and USAMRMC Animal Care and Use Review Office following the guidelines per the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines. The mTBI mouse model of male adult 12-week-old C57Bl/6 mice and the preparation of ASC-CCM used in the current study is described previously.\n16\nBlast injury mice were divided into two groups based on the intravitreal injection: 1) Blast-Saline (Blast-Sal), which received 1\u2009\u03bcL of physiological saline into both eyes; and 2) Blast-ASC-CCM, which received 1\u2009\u03bcL (\u223c100\u2009ng of protein) of cytokine primed ASC-CCM into both eyes. Sham-blast mice that underwent sham injury\n1\nreceived 1\u2009\u03bcL of saline into both eyes and served as control. All studies described below performed 4 weeks after intravitreal injections.\n\nElectroretinography\nScotopic threshold electroretinogram (ERG) recordings were obtained using the Espion E2 ERG system (Diagnosys LLC, Lowell, MA), as we described previously.\n17\nBriefly, mice that were dark adapted exposed to different flashes of increasing intensity ranging from 0.0025 to 25 cd/m\n2\n. Each flash repeated five times with appropriate intervals between flashes to generate a- and b-wave amplitudes.\n\nGlutamate assay in the retina\nSome mice were euthanized, and their eyes quickly removed. After carefully removing the anterior chamber, the retinal eyecups were scooped out and snap-frozen until analysis. Retinal free glutamate concentration was measured by a glutamate assay kit following the manufacturer's guidelines (ab83389, Abcam). Retinas were homogenized in 100\u2009\u03bcL of assay buffer containing Triton-X 100 and centrifuged at 12,000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was collected and mixed with 100\u2009\u03bcL of the reaction mixture containing glutamate assay buffer, glutamate enzyme, and glutamate developer, incubated at 37\u00b0C for about 30\u2009min. Following this, the absorbance was measured at 450\u2009nm using Biotek microplate reader. The amount of glutamate in each retina was then quantified against glutamate standard curve.\n\nTissue preparation and immunohistochemistry\nSome mice were euthanized, and their eyes quickly removed. The cornea was cut away, the lens and vitreous were removed, and the eyecups fixed for 4\u2009h in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C. Subsequently, the eyecups were cryopreserved in a graded series of sucrose solution and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (Microm-HM 550, Thermo Scientific) at -20\u00b0C. About 12-\u03bcm thickness of the retina along a dorsal to the ventral axis were placed on to L-poly lysine coated slides and stored at -20\u00b0C for further use. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to localize the expression of target proteins. Cryosections were washed three times with 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 0.01% Triton-X. Following this non-specific binding sites were blocked with 5% normal serum in 0.1\u2009M PBS for 1\u2009h and then incubated in primary antibodies (\nTable 1\n) against GS (dilutions: 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL, mouse monoclonal, catalog number: MAB302, Millipore), GLAST (dilutions: 2\u2009\u03bcg/mL, rabbit polyclonal, catalog number: ab416, Abcam), or AQP4 (dilutions: 2\u2009\u03bcg/mL, rabbit polyclonal, catalog number: A5971, Sigma-Aldrich) for 48\u2009h at 4\u00b0C.\nTable 1.\nList of Antibodies\nPrimary Ab\nDilution for WB\nCatalogue Number\nSources\nAnti-GFAP\n1\u2009\u03bcg/mL\nZO334\nDako\nAnti-GS\n1\u2009\u03bcg/mL\nMAB302\nMillipore\nAnti-GLAST1\n1\u2009\u03bcg/mL\nab416\nAbcam\nAnti-AQP4\n1\u2009\u03bcg/mL\nA5971\nSigma-Aldrich\nAnti- \u03b2-tubulin\n1\u2009\u03bcg/mL\nMA5-16308\nThermo Fisher Scientific\nOpen in a separate window\nAb, antibody; WB, Western blotting; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; GS, glutamine synthetase; GLAST, glutamate transporter; AQP4, aquaporin-4.\nAfter three consecutive washes with 0.1\u2009M PBS-Triton-X, sections were incubated in their respective secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 or 546 and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 546, dilution: 2\u03bcg/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Finally, after a brief wash retinal sections were incubated with DAPI for nuclear staining, and examined under a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 710). Tissue sections without exposure to the primary antibody served as negative controls for immunostaining. The average relative fluorescence units (RFU) per 100,000\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nof the retina for GS, GLAST, and AQP4-immunolabeling were analyzed from at least three sections (from NFL to retinal pigment epithelium [RPE]) per eye by an investigator blinded to the groups.\n\nrMC-1 cell culture\nThe rMC-1 (Cat#ENW001, Kerafast) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing L-glutamine and supplemented with 10% of HI-FBS, 100\u2009U/mL penicillin, and 100 ug/mL streptomycin. The cells were incubated in a humidified 5% CO\n2\nincubator at 37\u00b0C. Upon reaching 90%, confluence cells were trypsinized and plated in individual plates for subsequent experiments. For studies involving exposure to glutamate, about 100,000 cells in a well of a 24-well plate were incubated with 0.5\u2009mL basal growth medium and challenged with 100\u2009ng/mL of glutamate for 2\u2009h. For studies involving ASC-CCM, rMC-1 were grown in serum-free media and pre-incubated cells with ASC-CCM (10\u2009\u03bcL/0.5\u2009mL) for 4\u2009h before exposing them to glutamate (100\u2009ng/mL) for 24\u2009h.\n\nWST-1 viability assay of rMC-1 glial cells\nAbout 10,000 cells/well of rMC-1 were cultured in a 96-well plate. After 2\u2009h of attachment, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) and incubated with 2\u2009\u03bcL (\u223c200\u2009ng of protein) of ASC-CCM in serum-free DMEM. After 4\u2009h, cells were exposed to different concentrations of glutamate (50, 100, and 200\u2009ng/mL) or H\n2\nO\n2\n(positive control) for further 24\u2009h in a humidified 5% CO\n2\nincubator at 37\u00b0C. Cell viability was analyzed using WST-1 (TaKaRa; Cat #MK400) dye according to the manufacture guidelines. The colored formazan products were measured at 450\u2009nm and 690\u2009nm using Biotek microplate reader. The cell viability was plotted against glutamate concentration.\n\nSmall interfering RNA transfection to reduce GLAST in rMC-1\nTo knockdown GLAST in rMC-1, cells were seeded at 100000 cells/well of a six-well plate in complete DMEM media. After cell attachment, rMC-1 was transfected with 100\u2009nM of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against GLAST (Thermo Fisher) or negative control siRNA using RNAiMax (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#13778-150) reagent. After 24\u2009h of transfection, rMC-1 was washed with DPBS, exposed to ASC-CCM (20\u2009\u03bcL /mL) for 4\u2009h, and challenged with 100\u2009ng/mL of glutamate for a further 24\u2009h. Finally, cells were harvested for gene expression analysis.\n\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting\nBoth retinal tissue samples from blast injury experiments and rMC-1 cells were processed for RNA and protein for gene and protein expression, respectively. Briefly, after various treatments, RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin\n\u00ae\nRNA Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH, Takara Bio USA), following the manufacturers protocol. About 250\u2009ng of total RNA from each sample was converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) using SuperScript III first-strand synthesis supermix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The resulting cDNA sample served as a template for real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using TaqMan probes (\nTable 2\n) and accompanying Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The expression levels of target gene transcripts were determined using the 2\u2212DDCt method and normalized to 18S rRNA.\nTable 2.\nTaqMan Probes\nGenes\nAssay ID\nReference sequence\nAmplicon length\n18S ribosomal RNA (18s rRNA)\nMm04277571_s1\nMm04277571_s1\n115\nGlutamate aspartate transporter-1(GLAST-1)\nMm00600697_m1\nNM_148938.3\n71\nGlutamine synthetase (GS)\nMm00725701_s1\nNM_008131.4\n110\nAquaporin-4 (AQP4)\nMm00802131_m1\nNM_009700.2\n69\nGlial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)\nMm01253030_m1\nNM_001131020.1\n64\nGlyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)\nRn01462662_g1\nNM_017008.4\n90\nGFAP\nRn01253033_m1\nNM_017009.2\n75\nGLAST-1\nRn00570130_m1\nNM_001289942.1\n88\nGS\nRn01483107_m1\nNM_017073.3\n89\nOpen in a separate window\nWestern blotting for GFAP, GS, GLAST, and AQP4 was performed to analyze the quantitative changes in their expressions among all experimental conditions. The retinal pellet was preserved during RNA isolation for Western Blotting. The pellet was dissolved in protein dissolving buffer (Macherey-Nagel GmbH, Takara Bio USA), supernatant was collected after centrifugation and stored at -800C. Protein concentrations of the samples were estimated by BCA method. About 25\u2009\u03bcg of total protein was loaded in each lane, along with protein markers (molecular weight range: 10-250\u2009kDa, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and resolved on a NuPAGE Bis-Tris pre-cast gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred to a PVDF membrane. After blocking the membrane for an hour in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST, it was probed with appropriate primary antibodies (\nTable 1\n) for 12\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. This was followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and detection using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL). Targeted proteins were probed in separate blots. From independent experiments, mean densitometry data were normalized to control using Image-J software and represented as the ratio of the target protein to ubiquitous endogenous \u03b2-tubulin control.\n\nQuantification of immunocytochemistry\nImmunocytochemistry was performed to study GFAP, GS, GLAST, and AQP4 in rMC-1 cells as described by us recently.\n16\nQuantification of pixel intensities for various proteins was analyzed from at least five images from different locations per well and expressed as an average of the experimental groups.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are represented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM) among the three experimental groups\nin vivo.\nExperiments involving rMC-1 cells\nin vitro\nwere performed in duplicates and repeated three times independently.

    "Methods": "Animals\nSeveral mouse lines were generated for this study. Mice possessing the entire genomic locus of normal human APP (APPtg) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (stock #005301; B6.129)\n52\nas well as the background control strain. These APPtg mice were crossed with NEP knockout (KO; Balb/c) and NEP2 KO (B6.129) mice.\n40\n,\n53\nMouse groups were APPtg with non-transgenic (Non-tg; control); APPtg.NEP\n-/-\nwith APPtg,NEP\n+/+\n(control); andAPPtg.NEP2\n-/-\nwith APPtg.NEP2\n+/+\n(control).\nRationale for the APPtg animal model\nOne area of interest for us was to determine the effect(s) of the presence of human A\u03b2 on acute to sub-acute time points post-TBI. It may be that human A\u03b2 is more pathogenic than mouse A\u03b2, as previously suggested.\n55\nTherefore, to use a better model of human pathology, we used mice producing human A\u03b2. Past studies using transgenic mouse models of AD have shown that the presence of these human genes exacerbate the injury and pathological outcomes.\n31\u201337\nHowever, these models expressed mutant forms of human APP and PS1 (or both) that cause early onset familial AD. These models also do not express these transgenes under their normal transcriptional regulation but instead constitutively express very high levels of the transgene(s). Therefore, these models are highly aberrant and are not ideal for modeling the normal process post-TBI. To address this, our models express the entire genomic locus for normal human APP in a yeast artificial chromosome.\n52\nTherefore, the non-mutated APP gene is not overexpressed and retains the transcriptional control normally associated with the gene. This would allow for appropriate regulation in response to TBI.\nRationale for the endopeptidase knockout models\nOne major pathway for the clearance of A\u03b2 in the brain is through direct proteolysis by endopeptidases.\n42\n,\n47\nNEP has been shown to be a key mediator of A\u03b2 clearance in the brain. The NEP homolog NEP2 also degrades A\u03b2 and evidence suggests it also contributes to A\u03b2 clearance.\n48\n,\n49\n,\n51\nKnockout of either (or both) of these enzymes causes increases in A\u03b2 levels in the brain.\n40\n,\n44\n,\n48\nEvidence shows that murine NEP and NEP2 degrade human A\u03b2.\n48\n,\n56\n,\n57\nClearance pathways for A\u03b2 have relevance to AD and we hypothesized they also may be relevant to TBI. Therefore, we crossed mouse lines deficient in the NEP or NEP2 genes with our APPtg mice to produce \u201chumanized APP mice\u201d lacking one of these enzymes to further elevate A\u03b2 levels. These mice were tested in the same repeat closed-head TBI model as the APPtg and wild-type mice.\nFor genotyping mice, a small tail-tip biopsy (\u223c2\u2009mm) was dissociated in tail lysis buffer (0.2% SDS, 0.28\u2009mg/mL Proteinase K, 55\u00b0C \u223c4\u2009h), precipitated in isopropanol, washed in 70% ethanol, and re-suspended in \u223c50 uL of Tris-EDTA buffer. Approximately 2 uL of extracted genomic DNA was used for analysis. The human APP transgene was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the standard \u0394\u0394Ct method with Eva Green (MidSci).\n51\nPrimers used were oIMR1544 (5\u2032-CACGTGGGCTCCAGCATT-3\u2032) and oIMR3580 (5\u2032- TCACCAGTCATTTCTGCCTTTG-3\u2032) for reference as well as hAPP FW-102 (5\u2032-GGTTGACGCCGCTGTCA-3\u2032) and hAPP RV-102 (TGG-ATT-TTC-GTA-GCC-GTT-CTG) for transgene detection (\nSupplementary Fig. S1A\n). The NEP genotype was assessed by standard end-point PCR with primers Ex-12 (5\u2032-GAAATCATGTCAACTGTG-3\u2032), Neo (5\u2032-ATCAGAAGCTTATCGAT-3\u2032), and Ex-13 (5\u2032-CTTGCGGAAAGCATTTC-3\u2032) at 0.8\u2009\u03bcM each. Two reactions were run for each mouse, one for detection of the wild-type locus (using primers Ex-12 and Ex-13) and the other for detection of the knockout (using primers Ex-12 and Neo). PCR was run using standard Taq Master Mix (NEB) and the following cycle protocol: 3\u2009min at 94\u00b0C, [30\u2009sec at 94\u00b0C \u2013 30\u2009sec at 49.3\u00b0C \u2013 30\u2009sec at 72\u00b0C]\u2009\u00d7\u200930, 10\u2009min at 72\u00b0C (\nSupplementary Fig. S1B\n). The NEP2 genotype was assessed by standard end-point PCR with primers F (5\u2032-TGGAACTGGAGACGCATCTGG-3\u2032), Neo-F (5\u2032-TCCTGTCATCTCACCTGGCTCC-3\u2032), and R (5\u2032-TAGCTCCATCAGGTCCATTCG-3\u2032) at 0.5\u2009\u03bcM each altogether using standard Taq Master Mix (NEB) and the following cycle protocol: 3\u2009min at 94\u00b0C, [30\u2009sec at 94\u00b0C \u2013 30\u2009sec at 55\u00b0C \u2013 2\u2009min at 72\u00b0C ]\u2009\u00d7\u200930, 10\u2009min at 72\u00b0C (\nSupplementary Fig. S1C\n).\nMice either received repeat impacts or repeat sham (see below). Both female and male mice were used in experiments. All mice were treated according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee\u2013approved protocols and in accordance with the\nGuide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\npublished in 1996 by the National Academy of Sciences and consistent with internal Institutional Animal Use and Care committee protocols.\n\nTBI\nWe chose to follow a previous protocol described in Mouzon and colleagues in which mice were subjected to repeat closed-head impacts.\n54\nThis is to better model the clinical situation in which the majority of people suffer multiple concussive events and not a single severe trauma directly to the brain as is done in many open-head CCI experiments. Using a controlled cortical impact device (Leica), we delivered consecutive closed-head impacts to mice at 9 weeks of age every other day for a total of five impacts (\nFig. 1\n). Mice were anesthetized in 2% isoflurane and secured on a foam pad placed on a stereotaxic device (Kopf) mounted with a Leica Impact One device. The head was shaved and covered with thin layer of lidocaine ointment. To help measure the location of the top of the scalp, a contact sensor ground wire was attached to the tail, which completed a weak electrical circuit that produces a tone when the impactor tip touches the scalp. Preliminary experiments on mice with an open scalp were used to determine the orientation of the impactor tip for closed-head injuries to approximate the coordinates previously used.\n54\nThe 5-mm tip was placed with the leading edge of the tip aligned 0.5\u2009mm caudal to the caudal edge of the opening of the eye and centered medal/lateral. The impactor was then set to impact the surface of the head at a depth of 2.2\u2009mm with a velocity of 5\u2009m/sec and a 300\u2009msec dwell time. Immediately post-impact or sham, mice received a low dose of meloxicam (0.4\u2009mg/kg) subcutaneously. Sham mice were placed on the stereotaxic frame under isoflurane, shaved, and skin treated with lidocaine (as above) and kept there under isoflurane for three minutes without impacting.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental design. Each node represents a single day. TBI, a single closed-head traumatic brain injury event. Color image is available online.\n\nRotarod analysis\nOne day before the first impact or sham treatment (\nFig. 1\n), mice received pre-training on the Rotarod test. Mice were placed on a Rota Rod (Rotamex) with settings of acceleration step 0.5\u2009rpm, max speed of 50\u2009rpm, rot delay of 2\u2009sec, and a maximum duration of 180\u2009sec. The time until the mouse fell from the rod was digitally recorded. Six training trials were performed in the morning and six training trials 4\u2009h later in the afternoon. The average time for the last three trials was used for normalized performance values for the post\u2013injury tests. One day and 3 days post\u2013last impact (or sham), the mice were tested with three trials on the Rotarod with the same settings as the pre-training.\n\nOpen field\nTwo days after the second Rotarod analysis (Day 5 post-impacts), mice were placed into a non-transparent (4\u2032\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2032) open field for 30\u2009min to acclimate them to the new environment. Mouse movements were tracked and recorded using TSE Systems Top Scan. A zone 4\u2033 from the edge was defined as the \u201coutside\u201d and the interior zone as \u201cinside\u201d for open field analysis of mouse movements.\n\nMorris water maze\nFour days after the Open Field test (9 days post-impacts), mice were placed into a water-filled 5\u2032 diameter pool made opaque by the addition of non-toxic white paint with a clear 10-cm wide square platform 0.5\u2009cm below the surface of the water. Mice were allowed to swim up to 1\u2009min in order to find the platform. If the platform was not found, the mice were placed on the platform for 30\u2009sec to orient themselves. Four trials were conducted each day for 5 days and the time to platform (latency) recorded. On the 6th day, the platform was removed and the time spent in each quadrant was recorded for 1\u2009min for the probe trial.\n58\nA video tracking system TSE Systems Top Scan was used to record the movements of the mice (\nSupplementary Fig. S15\n).\n\nAmyloid beta enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\nMice were randomly selected at 1, 3, and 14 days post-injury or sham and anesthetized under urethane for transcardial perfusion with cold saline solution. Brains were removed and the hippocampus was dissected out for snap freezing. This tissue was later homogenized in 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009volume/weight 5M guanidine-HCl (50\u2009mM Tris HCl, pH 8) overnight, then diluted 10-fold in 50\u2009mM Tris HCl (pH 8) with protease inhibitors (cOmplete-Mini, Roche) and 0.03% Tween 20, centrifuged at 16,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 30\u2009min and supernatants collected for total A\u03b2 extraction. An A\u03b2\n40\n-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Wako Chemicals, cat#: 294-64701) detecting both mouse and human A\u03b2 as previously reported\n48\n,\n50\n,\n58\nwas used for quantification. Data are presented as pmoles of A\u03b2 per mg of total protein.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistics were analyzed using linear mixed effects models in SPSS 26.0. Specifically, in order to account for non-independence of observations (i.e., repeated measures per subject), random intercept models were fit using restricted maximum likelihood estimation for continuous variables or specifying the repeated measures factor for categorical levels. These parameterizations lead to results comparable to traditional analysis of variance (ANOVA) or t-tests, but allow for modeling heterogeneity of variance and lack of sphericity, if necessary."

    "Methods": "Subjects and study design\nPatients presenting with TBI (GCS 3\u201315) to 1 of 18 participating level I U.S. trauma centers from February 26, 2014 to July 27, 2018 were identified and enrolled prospectively in the TRACK-TBI study, as previously described.\n34\n,\n35\nWritten consent was obtained from subjects or their legal authorized representatives. Eligibility criteria included presentation within 24\u2009h of injury with TBI warranting clinical evaluation with a non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) evaluation based on practice guidelines.\n36\nExclusion criteria were positive pregnancy test or known pregnancy, imminent death or current life-threatening disease, incarceration, or evidence of serious psychiatric and neurological disorders that would interfere with consent or follow-up outcome assessment. The study was approved by the institutional review board of each enrolling site.\nTBI subjects were stratified into three clinical groups differentiated by clinical care path: 1) emergency department and discharged (ER) stratum; 2) admission stratum (ADM): patients admitted to the hospital but not to the intensive care unit (ICU); and 3) ICU stratum (ICU): patients admitted directly from ER or another hospital to the ICU.\nSubjects were eligible for inclusion as orthopedic trauma controls (OTCs) if they presented with isolated trauma to their limbs, pelvis, and/or ribs and had an Abbreviated Injury Score <4 for those body regions. OTC subjects were identified and enrolled using the same process as that for patients with TBI, except for the head CT requirement. Subjects were ineligible from enrollment as an OTC if they had loss of consciousness, disturbance of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia/retrograde amnesia, or other clinical findings suggestive of a TBI.\nFinally, healthy controls (HCs) were recruited either based on a relationship with a TRACK-TBI participant or through public outreach within TRACK-TBI institutions, and the ability to provide informed consent. HCs were ineligible for enrollment if they had a history of TBI, concussion, or any traumatic injury causing polytrauma in the 12 months preceding enrollment. In this analysis, HCs were sex- and age-matched to TBI subjects.\nThe TRACK-TBI Phase 1 Biomarker Cohort (\nn\n=\u20091706) evaluated in this study was a prespecified interim analysis that included the first half of the enrolled TBI subjects and the OTC and HC groups (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nTRACK-TBI phase 1 biomarker cohort CONSORT diagram.

Injury Severity Score (ISS) was collected for all hospitalized (ADM, ICU) subjects. Outcome assessments occurred at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. Three-month assessments were performed by telephone; other assessments were performed in person. For this study, the primary outcome was the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) administered to assess patient-reported global disability attributable only to the TBI. Complete recovery was defined as a GOSE\u2009=\u20098. Incomplete recovery was defined as GOSE <8. Unfavorable outcome was defined as GOSE <5 and favorable outcome as GOSE \u22655.\n\nSample collection and biomarker analysis\nFor subjects who consented to biospecimen collection, blood samples were collected within 24\u2009h of injury (day 1) and at 2 weeks and 6 months. For subjects admitted to the hospital (ADM, ICU), additional blood samples were collected on days 3 and 5, when possible. Patients with available samples on day 1 and 2 weeks, and additionally day 3 and/or day 5, were considered to have \u201cserial samples\u201d and were included in longitudinal analyses. All samples were dated and time-stamped to compare with time of injury. The TBI-CDE Biospecimens and Biomarkers Working Group consensus recommendations for plasma and serum preparation were followed.\n37\nPlasma and serum aliquots were prepared for each subject and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C for future analysis. All samples were deidentified using a unique study ID, specific to site and subject, and batch-shipped in temperature-controlled overnight express freight containers to the TRACK-TBI Biospecimens Repository at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (Pittsburgh, PA).\nBlinded sample analysis of hsCRP was carried out by a single laboratory (University College of Dublin) using the Abbott Architect c8000, MULTIGENT CRP Vario assay using the high-sensitivity method (CRP16). Anti-CRP antibody adsorbed to latex particles agglutinate when an antigen-antibody reaction occurs with CRP, resulting in a change in absorbance proportional to the quantity of CRP in the sample. Serum samples were thawed in batches at room temperature and centrifuged at 10,000 rfc for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C before testing. Assays were performed in duplicate with a lower limit of quantification of 0.1\u2009mg/L and a reportable range of 0.1\u2013160.0\u2009mg/L. Temporal trends of CRP were analyzed and reported. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) concentrations were determined using prototype immunoassays on the i-STAT point-of-care platform (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL), as previously described.\n34\nThe i-STAT GFAP test uses the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method with electrochemical detection of the resulting enzyme signal.\n\nComputing tomography imaging evaluation and analysis\nInitial head CT scans were deidentified and uploaded to a central imaging database at the Laboratory of NeuroImaging (LONI; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) and independently evaluated by a central board-certified neuroradiologist in accordance with TBI-CDE Neuroimaging Working Group consensus recommendations.\n36\nThe study neuroradiologist was blinded to the identity and clinical information associated with each CT scan. The result of each review was uploaded to the TRACK-TBI clinical database under the respective subject's record. CT scans were read as positive (CT\n+\n) if there was any evidence of acute intracranial pathology consistent with TBI (e.g., contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and subdural hematoma).\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging methods and analysis\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained at 7\u201318 days. Image sequences included T1, T2, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and T2*. The MRI protocol was standardized across all sites and General Electric, Siemens, and Phillips MRI platforms (available at\nhttps://tracktbi.ucsf.edu/researchers\n). Baseline phantom scans were performed at all centers to quantify differences between magnets and correct geometrical variances across scanners. Structural MRI abnormalities were quantified according to CDE standards and definitions\n36\nby a central board-certified neuroradiologist blinded to the identity and clinical history of the subject. MRI scans were read as positive (MRI\n+\n) if there was any evidence of acute intracranial pathology consistent with TBI (e.g., contusion, traumatic axonal injury, and diffuse axonal injury).\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive summary statistics were used to characterize the demographics and clinical attributes of the study cohort. hsCRP levels were reported using the median and 25th/75th percentiles and were compared using a Wilcoxon's rank-sum test between TBI subjects and OTC/HC; among TBI subjects with and without intracranial lesions on CT; among TBI CT-negative subjects with and without intracranial lesions on MRI; among TBI subjects by ISS total score categories (\u22649, 10\u201316, 17\u201325, and >25); and among TBI subjects by GOSE outcomes (unfavorable, <5 vs. favorable, \u22655; and complete recovery,\u2009=\u20098 vs. incomplete recovery, <8). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the ability of hsCRP level at each time point to predict GOSE at 6 months post-injury, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated with a 95% confidence interval (CI). AUCs of >0.9 were considered excellent, 0.8\u20130.9 as good, 0.7\u20130.8 as adequate, and <0.7 as poor. All data were analyzed and plotted using statistical software R (version 3.6.1;\nhttp://www.r-project.org\n)."

A 1\u2009cm incision was made at the top of the skull to expose the bone, and a 5\u2009mm left lateral craniotomy was performed using an electrical drill (Kopf\n\u00ae\n, David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA) attached on the stereotaxic arm as previously described.\n41\nA controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury was produced with an electromagnetic impact device (Benchmark\u2122 Stereotaxic Impactor, Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) centered at 3.0\u2009mm anterior from lambda and 2.7\u2009mm left from midline with a depth of 2.5\u2009mm, a velocity of 5.0\u2009m/sec, and a dwell time of 100\u2009ms. After impact, the skin incision was sutured closed and the mice were placed on a warming pad and returned to their home cages when they were fully ambulatory, typically 60\u2013120\u2009min after injury. For some experiments, mice underwent only the craniotomy, but not the CCI, as surgical controls. For some experiments, estradiol or vehicle (ethanol) was injected intravenously 1\u2009h after TBI.\n\nP. aeruginosa\npneumonia model\nInstillation of pneumonia was performed as previously described.\n42\nMice were instilled with pneumonia 24\u2009h after TBI or craniotomy. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (90\u2013200mg/kg, IM) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg, IM), and 25\u2009\u03bcL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 x 10\n7\ncolony-forming units of\nP. aeruginosa\nK-strain, a wild type strain (hereafter referred to as \u201cPAK\u201d) was instilled into both lungs via the trachea. Mice were allowed to recover for 15\u2009min prior to being returned to their cage.\n\nSurvival\nAfter instillation of pneumonia, mice were checked every 6\u2009h after the instillation of PAK until death or survival at 36\u2009h. Survival time was defined as the time from bacterial instillation to death.\n\nBacterial clearance\nLung bacterial clearance was measured as previously described.\n43\nSix hours after instillation of PAK, lungs were collected in a sterile fashion. The lungs were homogenized in sterile containers and the homogenates were serially diluted and plated in triplicate on sheep-blood agar plates.\n\nIsolation of peritoneal macrophages\nPeritoneal macrophages were isolated as previously described.\n44\nBriefly, peritoneal macrophages were collected 3 days after intraperitoneal injection of 4% Brewer thioglycollate and seeded on plates in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640. After 2\u2009h, the plates were washed with serum-free RPMI 1640 to remove non-adherent cells. Macrophages were further cultured in RPMI 1640 (fetal bovine serum [FBS] 5%) and used for experiments the following day.\n\nCell culture\nMH-S and AMJ2-C11 cells were acquired from ATCC\n\u00ae\n(CRL-2019 and CRL-2456, respectively, Manassas, VA, USA). MH-S cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and AMJ2-C11 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO\n2\n.\n\nPhagocytosis\nPhagocytosis assays were performed as previously described.\n45\nBriefly, 1 x 10\n6\ncells were exposed to 10\n7\ncolony forming units (CFU)/mL of PAK for 45\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. Gentamicin (150\u2009\u03bcg/mL) was added and cells were incubated for 1\u2009h at 37\u00b0C. The medium was removed and cells were washed twice with sterile PBS, then lysed by adding 200\u2009\u03bcL of hypotonic buffer (pH 7.2), and incubated on ice for 10\u2009min. Sterile water (800\u2009\u03bcL) was added to the cell suspension, which was serially diluted onto agar plates. The plates were incubated for 24\u2009h at 37\u00b0C and the resulting colonies were counted. Comparisons were made between treatment groups at 1\u2009h to determine the level of phagocytosis. For some experiments, cells were pre-treated with 10\u2009nM estradiol or vehicle.\n\nCytokine measurement\nConfluent macrophages were exposed to 10\n7\nCFU/mL of PAK for the times indicated in the respective figure legends. Supernatants were collected and centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and supernatants were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until they were assayed. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). TNF-\u03b1 was measured in the supernatants according to manufacturer instructions. Lysates from the same wells were collected and measured for protein content to normalize cytokine measurements.

For normally distributed data, a Student\nt\ntest was used to compare two experimental groups. Bonferroni correction, controlling for false positive error rate, was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. For survival results, Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis followed by a log rank (Mantel\u2013Cox) test was used to compare the survival between the two experimental groups of mice at 36\u2009h.

It was designed to increase the number of training samples with enhanced input feature variations, which was necessary to ensure CNN training convergence and to improve performance.\n39\nThe HF data set was not augmented, as it served as an\nindependent\ntesting data set to evaluate CNN performance using training data generated exclusively from other sources (SF and NFL).\nRotational velocity (\nv\nr\no\nt\n) profiles were available for the SF and NFL data sets. The HF data set was given in terms of rotational acceleration (\na\nr\no\nt\n) profiles, which were integrated into\nv\nr\no\nt\nby assuming a zero initial\nv\nr\no\nt\nvalue. The combined data set (\nn\n=\u20093069) was used to optimize the CNN architecture in this study.\nTo further account for \u201cmilder\u201d impacts relevant to sub-concussion, two additional batches of SF and four additional batches of NFL data sets were generated by targeting\nv\nr\no\nt\npeak magnitude to a range of 2.0\u201321.9\u2009rad/sec. The lower bound was sufficient to cover the 25th sub-concussive impact (of 2.4\u2009rad/sec), while the upper bound corresponded to the 50th concussive impact.\n50\nThis led to 2592 (110\u2009\u00d7\u20096\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009+\u200953\u2009\u00d7\u20096\u2009\u00d7\u20094) additional training samples.

The real-world impacts are overlaid. Regions between the two vertical lines are considered \u201cin range.\u201d The identified two cases (stars) are further illustrated in\nFigure 9\n. Color image is available online.\n\nData pre-processing\nUsing\nv\nr\no\nt\nprofiles alone was sufficient to train/predict peak MPS of the whole brain with sufficient accuracy.\n39\nHowever, training MPS distribution was notably more challenging, not only because of the much larger number of response values to predict (\nn\n=\u200955 k brain elements vs. 1 for peak MPS of the whole brain), but also because the earlier peak MPS does not need to specify the location of occurrence, whereas MPS distribution does not have such an advantage. With trial and error, we discovered that combining both\nv\nr\no\nt\nand the corresponding\na\nr\no\nt\nprofiles as CNN input was important to maximize input features and to improve the estimation performance (further discussed subsequently).\nSimilar preprocessing was conducted on\nv\nr\no\nt\nand\na\nr\no\nt\nprofiles in the WHIM global coordinate system.\n39\nThis included transforming the profiles using the \u201cconjugate rotational axis\u201d,\n\u03a9\n180\n0\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n,\n\u2212\n\u03b1\n, for impacts with\n|\n|\n\u03b8\n|\n|\n>\n9\n0\n0\n, where\n\u03b8\nand\n\u03b1\nare the azimuth and elevation angles characterizing the rotational axis,\n\u03a9\n\u03b8\n,\n\u03b1\n, determined when the resultant\nv\nr\no\nt\nreached its peak. Essentially, this was to negate both the\nx\n- and\nz\n-components of the\nv\nr\no\nt\nand\na\nr\no\nt\nprofiles, when\n|\n|\n\u03b8\n|\n|\n>\n9\n0\n0\n,\n37\nto generate mirrored responses about the mid-sagittal plane.\n37\n,\n38\nThe\nv\nr\no\nt\nand\na\nr\no\nt\nprofiles were then synchronously repositioned so that the\nv\nr\no\nt\npeak occurred at a fixed 100\u2009ms. Replicated padding with zero acceleration was added to both sides of the profiles so as to reformat them into a fixed size of 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009201. The two dimensions corresponded to the three anatomical directions and a fixed temporal length of 200\u2009ms at a resolution of 1\u2009ms, respectively.\nData in\nv\nr\no\nt\nand\na\nr\no\nt\nprofiles did not have the same range. According to on-field measurements, generally, they are on the order of 0\u2013100\u2009rad/sec versus 0\u201310,000\u2009rad/sec\n2\nrespectively.\n50\nTo ensure the same data range (of 0\u2013100) to improve performance,\n51\na\nr\no\nt\nvalues were uniformly scaled to 1%. Finally,\nv\nr\no\nt\nand the scaled\na\nr\no\nt\nprofiles (3\u2009\u00d7\u2009201 each) were combined into a 2D image at a size of 6\u2009\u00d7\u2009201 to serve as CNN input (\nFig. 3\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nFlow chart showing preprocessing of a head impact kinematic profile (top) and an empirically optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture (bottom) to predict the distribution of peak maximum principal strain (MPS) of the entire brain. The pre-processed\nv\nr\no\nt\nprofile (after transforming to its \u201cconjugate rotational axis,\u201d and if needed, shifting, and padding\n39\n) is combined with the corresponding pre-processed and scaled\na\nr\no\nt\nprofile (effectively, with a unit of 100\u2009rad/sec\n2\nafter scaling). The resulting two-dimensional [2D] image representation serves as the CNN input. Color image is available online.\n\nCNN architecture\nThe previous CNN architecture\n39\nwas further empirically optimized to estimate element-wise peak MPS (regardless of the time of occurrence), by minimizing a weighted loss function (described subsequently) in a 10-fold cross validation using the entire training data set (\nn\n=\u20093069). Compared with the previous architecture, the updated network consists of three convolutional layers, with 64, 64, and 32 filters, each with sizes of\n3\n\u00d7\n30\n,\n1\n\u00d7\n3\n,\n1\n\u00d7\n3\n, and stride sizes of\n1\n\u00d7\n2\n,\n1\n\u00d7\n2\n,\n1\n\u00d7\n1\n, respectively (\nFig. 3\n). They are followed by a pooling layer of a size of\n1\n\u00d7\n2\nwith a stride size of\n1\n\u00d7\n2\n, a flattening layer (with a dropout rate of 0.2), and three fully connected layers with sizes of 200, 100, and 55 k (the last of which corresponds to the number of brain elements to predict responses). The pooling layer and the first fully connected layer (of a size of 200) adopted a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, while all other layers used a linear activation function. A batch size of 256 was chosen with the number of epochs set to 400. An early stopping criterion was used to avoid overfitting. The CNN architecture was implemented using Keras library (Version 2.2.4) with Tensorflow (Version 1.11.0) backend.\nMPS responses do not have the same variance across the brain among head impacts, as previously shown for the NFL impacts.\n52\nThis implies a graded estimation uncertainty across brain regions. Intuitively, if we penalize more for elements with larger variations across the impacts, it would likely improve estimation accuracy. Therefore, a weighted loss function was designed:\nl\no\ns\ns\n=\n1\np\n\u2211\ni\n=\n1\np\n1\nq\n\u2211\nj\n=\n1\nq\n\u03c3\ni\n\u00d7\nx\ni\nj\n\u2212\ny\ni\nj\n2\n\u00d7\n100\n,\n(1)\nwhere\nx\ni\nj\nand\ny\ni\nj\nare the estimated and directly simulated MPS values for the\ni\nth\nbrain element in the\nj\nth\ntraining sample impact, respectively;\np\nis the number of the brain elements in the anisotropic WHIM V1.0,\nq\nis the number of the training samples (e.g., 90% of the 3069), and\n\u03c3\ni\nis the standard deviation of the\ni\nth\nbrain element among the\nq\ntraining samples. An additional scaling factor of 100 was used to mitigate the loss of data precision resulting from round-off errors during the iterative training process, as values of\nx\ni\nj\n,\ny\ni\nj\n, and\n\u03c3\ni\nwere typically small. This was important as the internal CNN architecture uses 32-bit single-precision floating numbers.\n53\n\nCNN estimation performance\nFor the entire data set (\nn\n=\u20095661), a 10-fold cross-validation would ensure each sample to be tested once. For each testing sample, we assessed the CNN estimation accuracy by comparing the predicted MPS distribution with the directly simulated responses in terms of element-wise linear regression slope,\nk\n, and Pearson correlation coefficient,\nr\n.\n19\nFor impacts that used a \u201cconjugate rotational axis,\u201d the estimated MPS distribution was further mirrored about the mid-sagittal plane prior to assessing estimation accuracy. When element-wise MPS estimation was identical to the directly simulated, both\nk\nand\nr\nwould be 1.0. Therefore, an estimation was considered \u201csufficiently accurate\u201d when\nk\nand\nr\nsatisfied:\n0\n.\n9\n<\nk\n<\n1\n.\n1\nand\nr\n>\n0\n.\n9\n. The percentage of head impacts that had sufficiently accurate estimation was referred to as \u201csuccess rate.\u201d\nThe majority of training impacts had a peak\nv\nr\no\nt\nwithin the targeted range (2\u201340\u2009rad/sec;\nFig. 2a\n). However, they did not have a uniform distribution of peak rotational acceleration,\na\nr\no\nt\n(\nFig. 2b\n), which was not controlled in data augmentation. In addition, we found that a significant number of impacts had a large non-zero initial\nv\nr\no\nt\nvalue augmented from the SF data set because the impacts were given in terms of\nv\nr\no\nt\nprofiles (the ratio to the peak\nv\nr\no\nt\nmagnitude of 18.1\u2009\u00b1\u200922.2% for the given data set, range 0\u2013100%). The initial non-zero\nv\nr\no\nt\nvalues could be further amplified because of random perturbation and scaling during data augmentation. For these impacts, even when their peak\nv\nr\no\nt\nvalues were within the targeted range, a large initial\nv\nr\no\nt\nvalue after augmentation would effectively reduce the change in\nv\nr\no\nt\npeak values and make them \u201coutliers.\u201d\nIn order to assess the CNN estimation accuracy more conservatively with a minimum number of \u201coutliers,\u201d impacts with peak\nv\nr\no\nt\noutside the targeted range (1.5% of the cases), with peak\na\nr\no\nt\nbelow the 10th or above the 90th percentile (20.0% of the cases), or with the ratio between the initial and peak\nv\nr\no\nt\nvalues >10% (11.0% of the cases), were empirically removed. This led to a total of 4298, or 75.9% \u201cin-range\u201d impacts remaining (a given impact may be an \u201coutlier\u201d in multiple categories). A separate 10-fold cross-validation was conducted once again to report the CNN estimation accuracy.\n\nInjury prediction performance\nCNN estimation may degrade accuracy, which necessitates the investigation into its significance and implication on injury prediction. To achieve this goal, we used a subset of training samples by excluding the NFL and the associated augmented impacts (\nn\n=\u20093064 impacts remained; 5661\u201353\u2009\u00d7\u20096\u2009\u00d7\u20098\u201353) to train the CNN again with the same optimized architecture. The data exclusion and retraining ensured an objective performance measure on the\nindependent\nNFL head impacts (i.e., without contaminating the training data by information from the testing data set). The resulting distributions of peak\nv\nr\no\nt\nand\na\nr\no\nt\nvalues for the reduced training data set are in\nFigure 4a and b\n, respectively. Estimation accuracy was similarly assessed in terms of\nk\nand\nr\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nHistograms of peak resultant rotational velocity (\na\n;\nv\nr\no\nt\n) and acceleration (\nb\n;\na\nr\no\nt\n) for a subset of data (\nn\n=\u20093064) used to train and test on an independent National Football League (NFL) data set (\nn\n=\u200953), which is overlaid (number of occurrences multiplied by 10 to improve visualization). Color image is available online.\nMPS distribution effectively represented a \u201cfeature\u201d at every element location of the brain. Therefore, it allowed feature-based machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM)\n54\nand random forest (RF)\n55\nto classify injury versus non-injury.\n47\nBoth CNN-estimated MPS distribution and the directly simulated responses were used for classification or injury prediction. Similarly to a previous study,\n47\ntwo feature selection methods using either F-score\n54\nor RF \u201cgini\u201d importance ranking\n55\nwere separately applied. Injury prediction using peak MPS of the whole brain\nvia\nlogistical regression served as a reference for comparison in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operator's curve (AUC). All injury prediction performances were measured\nvia\nleave-one-out cross-validation.\n35\n,\n36\nParameters associated with SVM and RF were determined empirically to maximize injury prediction accuracy following the previous study.\n47\nWhen using F-score for feature selection, the top 4% were used. When using SVM for classification, a linear kernel was used. For RF, the number of trees and the depth of trees depended on whether it was used for feature selection or classification, as specified in\nTable 1\n.\nTable 1.\nThe Number and the Depth of Trees, (N, D), Used in RF Depended on Whether RF Was Used for Feature Selection (FS) or Classification (CL), as Shown\nSVM (CL)\nRF (CL)\nRF (\u201cgini\u201d importance ranking), FS\n(10, 2): FS\n(100, 2): FS\n(1000, 2): CL\nF-score, FS\nN/A\n(50, 2): CL\nOpen in a separate window\nRF, random forest; SVM, support vector machine.\n\nData analysis\nAll head impacts were simulated using the anisotropic WHIM V1.0, which took \u223c30\u2009min for one impact of \u223c100\u2009ms duration (double precision with 15 central processing units [CPUs] and graphics processing unit [GPU] acceleration; Intel Xeon E5-2698 with 256 GB memory, and 4 NVidia Tesla K80 GPUs with 12 GB memory). Another 30\u2009min was necessary to extract peak MPS distribution across the impact duration. In total, this study required \u223c8 months of nonstop computations to generate the data, which was mitigated by concurrent running of 5\u201310 jobs. Each CNN training took \u223c9\u2009min per fold for the entire data set on an NVIDIA Titan X Pascal GPU with 12 GB memory. Predicting the response distribution for a testing profile was instant (<0.1\u2009sec) on a low-end laptop.\nAll data analyses were conducted using MATLAB (R2019b; MathWorks, Natick, MA). Student's\nt\ntests were used to compare the injury prediction performances. Statistical significance was reached when the\np\nvalue was <0.05."

All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines and were approved by the VA Puget Sound Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. The shock tube (Baker Engineering and Risk Consultants, San Antonio, TX) was designed to generate BOP that mimic open-field high explosive detonations encountered by military service members in combat, and the design and modeling characteristics have been described in detail elsewhere.\n10\n,\n28\n,\n29\nBriefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (induced at 5% and maintained at 2\u20133%), secured on a gurney, and placed in the shock tube oriented perpendicular to the oncoming blast wave (ventral body surface facing the oncoming shock wave).\n31\nSham (control) animals received anesthesia only for a duration matched to blast animals. Repeated blast/sham exposures occurred successively over the course of 3 days (one per day). Following exposure, mice were immediately removed from the shock tube and anesthesia was discontinued (anesthesia duration ranged from 3 to 4\u2009min). Mice were then placed in a warm enclosure for observation during recovery. The BOP peak intensity (psi), initial pulse duration (ms), and impulse (psi\u00b7ms) used were in keeping with mild to moderate blast exposure\n31\n,\n32\n(20.23 psi \u00b10.08 psi; 5.797\u2009ms \u00b10.017\u2009ms; 0.037 psi\u2009\u00d7\u2009ms\u2009\u00d7\u20090.000 psi\u2009\u00d7\u2009ms) (\nFig. 1A\n). Under these experimental conditions, the survival rate was 96%, with blast-exposed mice appearing comparable to sham-exposed mice by inspection 2\u20134\u2009h post-blast exposure as previously reported.\n10\n,\n11\n,\n28\n,\n29\nAnimals were weighed daily prior to sham/blast exposure and at 24 and 72-h post-exposure.

One week prior to sham/blast exposure, animals were first pre-exposed to a Plexiglas T-Maze (66\u2009cm long\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009cm wide\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009cm high) for 5\u2009min. A stainless-steel mesh tea-ball (Amazon) containing a clean quarter Nestletts (PharmaServ, Framingham, MA) was also placed into each home cage to allow for pre-exposure. The following week, sham/blast exposure occurred on 3 consecutive days. On each day of sham/blast exposure, animals received a stainless-steel mesh tea-ball (Amazon) containing one-quarter Nestletts (PharmaServ, Framingham, MA) with 20\u2009\u03bcL of imitation almond extract (Kroger, Cincinnati, OH) in their home cage 5\u2009min prior to sham/blast exposure. The Nestletts and scent were refreshed on each morning of sham/blast exposure and the tea-ball remained in place until 24\u2009h after the final sham/blast exposure. One month following exposure, animals were tested for odorant-conditioning in the T-Maze with a tea-ball containing one-quarter Nestlett with 20\u2009\u03bcL imitation almond odorant cue placed in the left arm of the maze and a tea-ball containing one-quarter Nestlett with 20\u2009\u03bcL saline placed in the opposite arm of the maze. Animals were placed in the long arm of the T-maze and given 5\u2009min to explore the entire maze. Latency to enter and time spent in each of the two distal ends of the short arms was recorded and analyzed using Anymaze (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL).

A balanced three-compartment conditioning apparatus was used as described previously.\n17\nOne week prior to sham/blast exposure, animals were pre-tested by placing individual animals in the small central compartment and allowing exploration of the entire apparatus for 20\u2009min. Time spent in each compartment was recorded and analyzed using Anymaze. Mice were randomly assigned an a.m. and p.m. box (either gray walls or vertical black and white strip walls). The following week, sham/blast exposure occurred on 3 consecutive days. On each day of exposure, in the morning, animals were first placed in their a.m.-pairing chamber containing distinct visual cues for 10\u2009min, and then were immediately given a sham exposure. In the afternoon, animals were placed in their p.m.-pairing chamber containing a different set of distinct visual cues for 10\u2009min and then were immediately given a blast or sham exposure (depending on group assignment). Place conditioning was assessed at 1 and 3 months following repetitive exposure by allowing the mice to roam freely in all three compartments. Time spent in each compartment was recorded and analyzed using Anymaze (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). Place conditioning scores were calculated by subtracting the time spent in the p.m.-paired compartment from the time spent in the a.m.-paired compartment.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nBlast-induced place aversion.\n(a)\nSchematic of blast-induced place aversion paradigm.\n(b)\nSignificant aversion to blast-paired but not sham-paired cues at 1 month and 3 months post-injury.\n(c)\nNo difference in locomotion during place aversion post-test across groups and time points.

    "Methods": "SCI\nAll animal work described here was performed in accordance the guidelines from Office of Animal Welfare from the National Institutes of Health, and all procedures were approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nAnimals were randomly assigned to different treatment groups, and researchers were blinded to their status during the behavioral studies and analyses. Female Long Evans rats (\nn\n=\u200941, 8\u201312 weeks old; Envigo Labs; also see\nTable 1\n) were anesthetized using isoflurane (5% to induce and 2.5% to maintain) and shaved, and the area overlying the T6\u2013T11 vertebrae was cleaned and sterilized. A \u223c2.5\u2009cm longitudinal incision centered over T7\u2013T10 was made before subperiostal dissection of paraspinal muscles. A laminectomy was performed to expose the spinal cord at T8. To produce a contusion type lesion at T8, a third generation Ohio State University spinal cord contusion device with a 2\u2009mm diameter probe tip was used. During the contusion, the probe induced a 0.9\u2009mm displacement of the spinal cord resulting in a moderate injury.\n25\n,\n26\nTissue displacement and peak force data were collected and were used as indicators of injury consistency and severity between animals (see\nTable 1\n). Variations of spinal cord displacement were <20% in our animal cohort.\nTable 1.\nIn Vivo\nStudy Groups and Data for Contusion SCI in Rats\nAnimal group\nn\nMean displacement (mm)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\nMean peak force (N)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\nLaminectomy\n7\n-\n-\nSCI\n12\n0.79\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02\n40.60\u2009\u00b1\u20094.28\nSCI + durotomy alone\n7\n0.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\n41.24\u2009\u00b1\u20093.69\nSCI + durotomy + myelotomy\n15\n0.79\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03\n40.43\u2009\u00b1\u20093.18\nOpen in a separate window\nSCI, spinal cord injury; SD, standard deviation.\n\nISP measurements and decompression\nBefore and after tSCI, ISP measurements were obtained using previously described methods.\n6\nBriefly, ISP was measured using a 1F Millar Mikro-Tip pressure probe (tip diameter\u2009=\u2009330\u2009\u03bcm). For implantation, a small opening was made in the dural membrane using the tip of a 21-gauge needle, and ISP was recorded pre-injury and immediately after injury (\u223c 15\u2009min after impact). The probe was inserted into the spinal cord \u223c4\u2009mm caudal to the injury center. Surgical decompression was performed along the length of the exposed spinal cord, with the ISP probe positioned at the injury center. Durotomy was produced by incising the thecal sack with a #11 blade, and then gently expanding the dural opening using two Dumond #5 forceps. For myelotomy surgeries, a longitudinal pial incision was made along the posterior median sulcus with a #15 blade after the durotomy. The injury core was then gently irrigated with a physiological saline solution. ISP recordings were also made after durotomy alone and after durotomy plus myelotomy surgeries. All pressure measurements were collected using a digitizer and iox2 software from Emka Technologies (Falls Church, VA). The data collected were then transferred to Microsoft Excel to obtain ISP over time. A total of 11 animals were included in the ISP recordings.\nAfter injury and decompression, animals intended for survival studies were returned to the surgical area for closure, with some receiving durotomy or durotomy plus myelotomy prior to closure. To reduce excessive adhesion, a small piece of adipose tissue was positioned on top of the spinal cord. Muscle and skin were sutured in layers to close the wound. In our animal cohort, there were no peri- or post-operative complications related to either durotomy alone or durotomy combined with myelotomy procedures. Animals were treated with lactated Ringer's solution (subcutaneous; 5\u201310\u2009mL), and analgesics (buprenorphine; 0.03\u2009mg/kg) every 12\u2009h for 48\u2009h after surgery. Subcutaneous injections of gentamicin (5\u2009mg/kg) were given once daily for 5 days post- injury. Animals were allowed to recover in warmed cages and manual bladder expression was performed twice daily until normal void response recovered (up to 7\u201310 days post-injury).\n\nWater content analysis\nA total of seven animals were subjected to surgical spinal cord injuries and then randomly assigned to either a 4-h (\nn\n=\u20094) or 72-h (\nn\n=\u20093) survival group. The animals were treated post-operatively, as described, including post-operative analgesia and bladder expression. At the time of euthanasia, rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of 0.8\u2009mL Beuthanasia\u2013D (390\u2009mg/mL pentobarbital sodium, 50\u2009mg/mL phenytoin sodium). Spinal cords were extracted and cut into \u223c5\u2009mm segments centered over the injury center. Cord segments were placed into pre-weighed Eppendorf tubes and weighed on an analytical scale. The cord segments were placed in a 75\u00b0C oven for 72\u2009h and then weighed again to determine water loss. The percent water content was calculated using the following formula:\nP\ne\nr\nc\ne\nn\nt\nw\na\nt\ne\nr\nc\no\nn\nt\ne\nn\nt\n=\nw\ne\nt\nw\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\n\u2212\nd\nr\ny\nw\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\nw\ne\nt\nw\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\n\u2217\n100\n\nUrine volume data collection and analysis\nAfter thoracic SCI, all animals required manual bladder expression. As part of record keeping, every bladder expression was characterized by size; observations ranged from empty to very large. Animals typically regained independent bladder control within 7\u201314 days. Urine from the first bladder expression of the day was collected in a weight boat and measured (grams,\nn\n=\u200945 measurements) on days 3, 7, and 14 post-injury. Using the quantitative values measured during this test, an observed-value number scale was designed. The bladder volume was given a score between 0 and 4; corresponding to empty, very small, small, medium, and large, respectively (calculated, empty <0.04\u2009mL, very small <0.33\u2009mL, small <1.7\u2009mL, medium <3.25\u2009mL, large <4.45\u2009mL). The observed scores from every bladder expression were then averaged over time in order to determine the relative bladder function recovery time for each experimental group.\n\nBehavioral analysis\nIn the weeks prior to surgery, the animals were acclimated to the various pieces of behavioral equipment that they would be tested on after surgery. In the instances of the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor test and the Ladder Walk (LW) test, the animals were administered a pre-injury baseline test.\n\nOpen-field locomotor test \u2013 BBB\nThe BBB locomotor rating scale is a sensitive, observer-scored test of hindlimb locomotor behavior. The test animals were placed into a \u223c100\u2009cm diameter arena with 19\u2009cm walls (a children's play pool) that had a lightly textured, uniform floor. For 4\u2009min, the animal was permitted to explore the arena while two observers recorded locomotor actions on a score sheet live, according to the BBB locomotor rating scale. The test was also video recorded. The observers compared scoring, which was done live, and, if necessary, came to a consensus on the final left and right hindlimb scores. The BBB test was repeated every week for 8 weeks.\n\nLadder Walk test\nThe LW test requires no pre-training. The apparatus consists of two clear plexiglass walls \u223c90\u2009cm long and \u223c15\u2009cm tall that are \u223c10\u2009cm wide, creating a corridor. A series of 1\u2009mm diameter stainless steel rungs were intermittently spaced (gaps range between 1 and 3\u2009cm) to create a ladder-type floor. The entire apparatus was elevated slightly to create a space below for the animal's leg to fall. The home cage was placed at one end of the apparatus. For each trial, the animal was placed at the end opposite to the home cage and allowed to walk the length of the apparatus to return to the home cage. After each successful run, the placement of the rungs was changed to prevent the animals from memorizing a specific rung pattern. The test consisted of 10 trials and was recorded on video. The videos were later reviewed at half speed; the total number of attempted steps and the number of slips or misses (unsuccessful grasps of the rung) were counted for each hindlimb. The percentage of errors was recorded. The animals were tested prior to injury to establish a baseline error percentage, then again at weeks 6, 8, and 10 post-injury.\n\nVon Frey test\nPrior to testing, the rats were habituated to the arena: a four-sided acrylic box with a wire mesh (5.5\u2009\u00d7\u20095.5\u2009mm squares) floor (40\u2009cm high walls) on 20\u2009cm aluminum legs. Because the rats were required to remain still during testing, they were provided with cereal treats to eat while in the arena. After habituation, during the testing, the sensitivity of the plantar surface of the hind paw was measured with Von Frey filaments: nylon hairs of varying diameter that were pressed gently into the plantar paw surface until the point of buckling. The point of buckling for each filament corresponds to a known force. The filaments were applied to the paws through the mesh floor in order of ascending diameter; the mechanical withdrawal threshold of each rat was defined as the minimum diameter filament that elicits a paw withdrawal reaction at least three times out of five trials. The test was performed weekly up to 8 weeks post-injury. A simplified up-down method was used to score the results from the Von Frey test as previously described.\n27\n\nHistological staining and analysis: Cresyl violet and myelin stain\nSections were collected and mounted onto slides (250\u2009\u03bcm apart). Slides were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Macron Chemicals, Center Valley, PA) to ensure tissue adherence. Sections then underwent a series of alcohol incubations for dehydration beginning with 4\u2009min in deionized-water, followed by 5\u2009min periods in 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol followed by a xylene incubation for 10\u2009min and then back through the ethanol series. Sections were then incubated for 10\u2009min in an aqueous myelin dye (Eriochrome Cyanine R; Fluka, St. Louis, MO) and differentiated for 1\u2009min in 1% ammonium hydroxide (Fisher Scientific) after being washed in water. Sections were then briefly rinsed in water and incubated in Cresyl violet stain (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 3\u2009min. Following this step, sections were rinsed with deionized water 10 times and then quickly dehydrated in a stepwise manner for 4\u2009min each in 70% and 95% alcohol. The Cresyl violet was then briefly differentiated in 250\u2009mL of 95% alcohol containing five drops of glacial acetic acid (Fisher Scientific). Once differentiation was sufficient, sections continued through a stepwise dehydration process consisting of 5\u2009min each in 95% and 100% ethanol, followed by final 10\u2009min incubation in xylene. Slides were then cover slipped using Permount.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nRats were perfused and spinal cords were sectioned as described previously. Free floating 25\u2009\u03bcm sections were kept in cryo-protectant solution (30% sucrose, 30% Ethylene glycol, 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer, 1% polyvinyl-pyrrolidone [PVP-40]) at 4\u02daC. On the day of the experiment, free-floating sections, 250\u2009\u03bcm apart, from each spinal cord were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.2). Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating the slices in sodium citrate buffer, at 95\u02daC, pH 6, for 10\u2009min. Slices were then blocked and permeabilized with 1% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1\u2009h. Next, slices were incubated with primary antibody (Neuronal Nuclei, MAB 377, EMD Millipore Corp, USA, 1/200) at 37\u02daC for 1\u2009h. Following washes, the slices were incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG, Life technologies, USA, 1/500) for 1\u2009h at 37\u02daC. After washing with 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009PBS, the slices were incubated 4\u02ca,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Life Technologies, USA, 1/1000) to label all nuclei. Finally, the slices were mounted onto microscope slides with mounting medium (glycerol and p-phenylenediamine in PBS, pH 9.0). The same procedure was used to label cells Mouse Anti-Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP; MAB3402, EMD Millipore Corporation, USA, 1:1500) to detect astrocytes.\nFluorescent images were captured using an Axio Zoom V.16 (Zeiss) fluorescent microscope equipped with an Apotome.2 structured illumination device for optical sectioning. All images were analyzed using ImageJ software. All NeuN positive cells in the ventral horn of the spinal cord were counted using ImageJ software. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica SP8X confocal microscope. All confocal images were acquired with a dry 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009objective.\n\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables are presented as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for all statistical analyses. All significant findings reported were obtained with one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with \u03b1 set at\np\n<\u20090.05 and Fisher least significant difference (LSD) post-hoc test.\n\nResults\n\nSCI causes tissue edema and elevated ISP\nIntact rodent thoracic spinal cords had average water content of 66.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01% (See dotted line in\nFig. 1A\n). SCI gave rise to significant tissue edema most pronounced within a 10\u2009mm segment centered over the lesion center. Four hours after injury, the water content of the lesion center had increased by \u223c12% to an average of 74.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02%. The water content of the lesion center (10\u2009mm segment) was significantly higher than spinal cord tissue in the periphery (71.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7%;\np\n<\u20090.01). Tissue edema at the lesion center remained elevated up to 3 days after injury (78.21\u2009\u00b1\u20091.85%;\np\n<\u20090.05,\nFig. 1A\n). To determine ISP at the injury center, we implanted a micro-sensor into the contused spinal cord. We detected a significantly increased ISP at 4\u2009h following injury (7.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009mmHg) compared with 1.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009mmHg measured in the intact spinal cord (\np\n<\u20090.001). Intraspinal pressure remained elevated up to 3 days after injury (7.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u2009mmHg). ISP was effectively attenuated by both durotomy alone (4.17\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009mmHg;\np\n<\u20090.001) and durotomy + myelotomy (3.14\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009mmHg;\np\n<\u20090.001;\nFig. 1B\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nContusion spinal cord injury (SCI) results in edema and elevated intraspinal pressure (ISP).\n(A)\nIntact rodent thoracic spinal cords have average water content of 66.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01%. (Red dotted line). At 3 days after SCI, a significant increase in water content (78.21\u2009\u00b1\u20091.85%;\np\n<\u20090.05,\nn\n=\u20093) was detected. Water content was measured within 40\u2009mm of spinal cord centered over the injury site. Spinal cords segments (5\u2009mm) were collected and the wet and dry weight of the cord segments were collected to determine water content of the spinal cord.\n(B)\nThree days after injury, the ISP was significantly increased (7.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u2009mmHg) compared with control animals (1.84\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009mmHg;\np\n<\u20090.001). Durotomy alone (4.17\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009mmHg;\np\n<\u20090.001) and durotomy plus myelotomy (3.14\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009mmHg;\np\n<\u20090.001) resulted in significantly decreased ISP compared with SCI alone group.

Color image is available online.\n\nDecompression of the spinal cord promotes tissue sparing\nAnalysis of spared spinal cord tissue following a moderate thoracic SCI was conducted 10 weeks after injury. Spinal cord cross-sections of 7\u2009mm long spinal segments centered over the lesion epicenter were examined using Eriochrome Cyanine R and Cresyl violet staining (\nFig. 2A\n). SCI resulted in significant atrophy of neural tissue at the injury site compared with intact animals (1.58\u2009mm\n2\nvs. 3.45\u2009mm\n2\n). Durotomy alone increased the average area of spared spinal cord tissue at the injury center by 10.8% (1.75\u2009mm\n2\n); however, this did not reach statistical significance. Durotomy plus myelotomy surgery promoted tissue sparing at the injury center by 25.9% (1.99\u2009mm\n2\n) compared with injury-only animals. Durotomy plus myelotomy resulted in significantly increased spinal tissue sparing compared with either durotomy alone or tSCI-only treated animals (\np\n<\u20090.0001;\nFig. 2B\n). Tissue sparing achieved by durotomy plus myelotomy was most pronounced in the lesion center (spanning 1\u2009mm rostral to 1\u2009mm caudal) compared with tSCI-only animals (\np\n<\u20090.05).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nSurgical decompression promotes tissue sparing after spinal cord injury (SCI). (\nA)\nAxial spinal cord cross sections of the lesion epicenter stained with eriochrome cyanine R and Cresyl violet were examined at 250-\u03bcm intervals.\n(B)\nHistological analysis of spared tissue showed that durotomy plus myelotomy resulted in significantly increased neural tissue sparing overall compared with the SCI alone group (\np\n<\u20090.0001), while the effect of durotomy alone did not reach statistical significance (\np\n>\u20090.05). Analysis of spared gray matter revealed that both durotomy alone and durotomy plus myelotomy resulted in significantly increased sparing compared with traumatic SCI (tSCI) only (\np\n<\u20090.01). Analysis of spared white matter tracts showed that durotomy plus myelotomy significantly increased sparing compared with durotomy alone (\np\n<\u20090.01) and control animals (\np\n<\u20090.0001). **\np\n<\u20090.01, ****\np\n<\u20090.0001. Color image is available online.\nWe then analyzed the effect of decompression surgery on the amount of spared white matter tracts. Durotomy alone did not lead to a significant increase of white matter sparing compared with tSCI only (1.39\u2009mm\n2\nvs. 1.27\u2009mm\n2\n, respectively). Durotomy plus myelotomy resulted in an 21.3% increase of spared white matter at the injury center compared with tSCI-only (1.54\u2009mm\n2\nvs. SCI 1.27\u2009mm\n2\n). Enhanced tissue sparing was observed throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the lesion area, with the most pronounced effects in the periphery of the lesion area \u223c1\u2009mm away from the injury center. Durotomy plus myelotomy significantly increased white matter sparing compared with durotomy alone (\np\n<\u20090.01) and control SCI animals (\np\n<\u20090.0001;\nFig. 2B\n).\nAnalysis of gray matter sparing revealed that myelotomy increased gray matter sparing by 25.0% compared with durotomy alone and by 32.1% compared with tSCI-only (0.37\u2009mm\n2\n, 0.35\u2009mm\n2\n, 0.28\u2009mm\n2\n;\np\n<\u20090.01 for both comparisons). Enhanced sparing of gray matter appeared to be most pronounced in areas rostral to the injury center (\nFig. 2B\n). Histological analysis of NeuN immunoreactive motor neurons revealed that thoracic contusion SCI resulted in a significant loss of ventral horn motor neurons at the injury center (1\u2009mm segment) 12 weeks post-injury (\nFig. 3\n). Durotomy alone increased the number of spared motor neurons at the injury center by 100.0%. However, given the high variability, this difference was not statistically significant. Durotomy plus myelotomy surgery led to a statistically significant increase in preservation of motor neurons by 143.4% compared with tSCI-only (\np\n<\u20090.05).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nEffect of surgical decompression on local motor neurons.\n(A)\nRepresentative examples of NeuN stained axial histological slides.\n(B)\nHistological analysis revealed that thoracic contusion spinal cord injury resulted in a significant decrease in ventral horn motor neuron counts at the injury center 8 weeks after injury (\np\n<\u20090.001). Surgical decompression of the spinal cord, either by durotomy alone or durotomy plus myelotomy led to a trend toward an increase in the number of spared ventral horn motor neurons, although this was only significant following durotomy plus myelotomy (\np\n<\u20090.05). ***\np\n<\u20090.001, *\np\n<\u20090.05. Color image is available online.\n\nDecompression results in improved bladder function\nInability of rats to voluntarily void the bladder of urine after injury is a common feature of thoracic contusion models. With moderate SCI such as the one examined in this study, rats typically regain the ability to empty their bladder after 10\u201314 days post-injury. We measured residual urine volumes for all animals after sham, SCI, SCI plus durotomy alone, and SCI plus durotomy plus myelotomy surgeries over the first 2 weeks (\nFig. 4A\n). Analysis of our data demonstrated that durotomy alone promoted faster bladder recovery compared with durotomy plus myelotomy (\np\n<\u20090.05).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nSurgical decompression promotes functional outcome after spinal cord injury (SCI).\n(A)\nDurotomy alone resulted in earlier bladder reflex recovery than durotomy plus myelotomy (\np\n<\u20090.05).\n(B)\nAs expected, all injured animals showed some degree of spontaneous recovery of their hindlimb open-field locomotion. Durotomy plus myelotomy led to significantly better Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) scores overall compared with SCI control treatment (\np\n<\u20090.001). Durotomy plus myelotomy animals showed accelerated locomotor recovery compared with durotomy alone animals. From 5 weeks onwards, durotomy plus myelotomy treated animals performed better than SCI control treated animals (\np\n<\u20090.05). At 8-week follow-up, durotomy animals performed better than SCI control treated animals (\np\n<\u20090.05).\n(C)\nThe Ladder Walk test was administered to examine the sensory-induced hindlimb motor function. Durotomy alone resulted in a significant overall decrease in Ladder Walk error rate compared with control animals (\np\n<\u20090.05).\n(D)\nVon Frey testing was performed to determine decompression-related changes of nociception in our study animals. No significant differences were found. *\np\n<\u20090.05, ***\np\n<\u20090.001, ****\np\n<\u20090.0001. Color image is available online.\n\nDecompression results in improved locomotor recovery\nThoracic contusion SCIs in rodents led to significant functional hindlimb deficits, resulting in uncoordinated gait, difficulty in weight bearing, and, in many cases, complete hindlimb paralysis. Hindlimb locomotor testing using the BBB grading score confirmed significant impairment of hindlimb function in animals following contusion SCI followed by partial recovery over the ensuing 4\u20136 weeks (\nFig. 4B\n). Durotomy plus myelotomy resulted in significantly improved BBB scores compared with tSCI-only controls (\np\n<\u20090.001) from 5 weeks post-injury. Durotomy alone also resulted in higher BBB scores than tSCI-only, albeit at later follow-up (\np\n<\u20090.05).\nThe LW test provides a quantitative measurement of skilled aspects of locomotion, with sensory components.\n28\nBecause rung placements are constantly altered, rodents are unable to learn a specific gait pattern to navigate the apparatus. Therefore, comparisons of LW scores reveal differences in sensing the location of the rung, stepping, and grasping skill, and not simply differences in learning ability. As expected, SCI rats at 6, 8, and 10 weeks post-injury had vastly increased error rates compared with sham animals (\nFig. 4C\n). Surgical decompression by durotomy alone resulted in a significant overall decrease in LW error rate compared with SCI alone (\np\n<\u20090.05), but no statistically significant effect was seen for durotomy plus myelotomy animals.\nThe Von Frey assay is a test of paw sensitivity. Filaments of increasing stiffness are applied to a rodent's hind paw until a filament is found that reliably produces a withdrawal response. In the present study, neither SCI-only nor SCI with decompression (durotomy alone or durotomy plus myelotomy) significantly altered hind paw sensitivity (\nFig. 4D\n)."

    "Methods": "Study population\nThe CENTER-TBI project methods and design are described in detail elsewhere.\n14\nParticipants with TBI were recruited into three strata: (1) patients attending the emergency room, (2) patients admitted to hospital but not intensive care, and (3) patients admitted to intensive care. Follow-up of participants was scheduled per protocol at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months in group (1) and at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months in groups (2) and (3). The protocol time window for the 6-month GOSe was between \u22121 and +2 months from the 6-month time point (5\u20138 months post-injury). Outcome assessments at all time points included the GOSe. The GOSe has the following categories: (1) dead, (2) vegetative state, (3) lower severe disability, (4) upper severe disability, (5) lower moderate disability, (6) upper moderate disability, (7) lower good recovery, and (8) upper good recovery. The GOSe was collected using structured interviews\n15\nand patient/carer questionnaires.\n16\nSince the latter do not identify vegetative patients as a separate category, the vegetative state and lower severe disability were combined in one group.\nThe study population for this empirical methods comparison were all individuals from the CENTER-TBI database (total of 4509) whose GOSe status was recorded at least once within the first 18 months and who were still alive 180 days post-injury (\nn\n=\u20093343). The rationale for conducting the comparison conditional on 6-month survival is simply that the GOSe can only be missing at 6 months if the individuals are still alive, because the GOSe score would be \u201cdead\u201d otherwise. Data for the CENTER-TBI study were collected through the Quesgen electronic-case report form (Quesgen Systems Inc, USA), hosted on the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) platform and extracted via the INCF Neurobot tool (\nhttps://neurobot.incf.org/\n).

This led to a total of 8185 GOSe observations of the study population being available for the analyses. For 1151 (34%) individuals, GOSe observations at 180\u2009\u00b1\u200914 days post- injury were available, and 2394 (72%) individuals had GOSe observations within the per-protocol window of 5\u20138 months post-injury. The distribution of GOSe sampling times and both absolute and relative frequencies of the respective GOSe categories are shown in\nFigure 1\n.

Here, LOCF was defined as the last GOSe observation before the imputation time point of 180 days post-injury. LOCF is not a model-based method and, by definition, only permits the imputation of a GOSe value for subjects for whom at least one value was available within the first 180 days post- injury. We accounted for this lack of complete coverage under LOCF by performing all performance comparisons including LOCF only on the subset of individuals for whom a LOCF-imputed value could be obtained.\n\nModel-based methods\nModel-based imputation approaches offer richer output (probabilistic imputation, multiple imputation) and may reduce the LOCF-inherent bias. We compared the performance of four model-based approaches with that of LOCF.\nThe MICE regression approach (MI) is a standard approach to MI that defines regression models for each missing variable in a matrix.\n17\nBy iterating over each variable that contains missing values, and resampling missing values from the corresponding regression model while holding all other variables fixed, a steady-state can ultimately be reached, and a set of imputed data sets can be generated. Because our goal is single imputation, we reduced the set of imputed values to a prediction by taking the most frequently imputed GOSe value. The frequency distribution of the imputed GOSe values can be used as probabilistic prediction in very much the same way as the probabilistic output of other model-based methods. To incorporate the longitudinal aspect of GOSe, we jointly imputed GOSe at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months jointly. This means that the GOSe at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months act as covariates in the regression model for the 6-month GOSe.\nMM are a widely used approach in longitudinal data analysis and model individual deviations from the population mean trajectory.\n18\nThe MM used for the GOSe imputation incorporates time as a non-linear covariate via a spline to be able to capture the non-linear dynamics of GOSe over time in the population. The MM was fitted using Bayesian methods to allow for the inclusion of patient-specific quadratic random effect (see\nSupplementary Text\nfor details). An alternative non-linear regression model for longitudinal data is GP, which allows flexible modelling of both the individual GOSE trajectories and the population mean in a Bayesian non-parametric way.\n19\nBoth the employed MM and the GP are non-linear regression techniques for longitudinal data. Although these are powerful tools to model longitudinal trajectories, they do not explicitly model the probability of transitions between GOSe states. Because the number of observations per individual is limited in our data set (1\u20134 GOSe observations per individual), an approach explicitly modeling transition probabilities might be more suitable for capturing the dynamics of the GOSe trajectories. To explore this further, a Markov MSM was considered.\n20\n,\n21\nAll models were fitted using either none or all IMPACT predictors except for the MSM model, which only used age because of issues with numerical stability. Computational intensity is hard to compare because it depends on the exact hardware used. All methods except MSM can at least partially be run in parallel. On a Mac Book Pro 2019, the required time to fit each of the models on the entire available CENTER TBI data (with IMPACT covariates) was 13\u2009min (MI), 26\u2009min (MSM), 86\u2009min (MM), and 112\u2009min (GP). Although these differences are substantial, they are within one order of magnitude and would not preclude any of the methods in practice. Further details on the implementations are given in the\nSupplementary Text\n.\nAll models, irrespective of the fact whether they are Bayesian or frequentist, produce probabilistic outputs; that is, a discrete probability distribution over the possible GOSe values at 6 months for each individual. Although we propose only to store these probabilities along with the most likely GOSe value at 6 months, multiple imputations can be obtained post-hoc by resampling from the discrete probability distribution of each individual via inverse transform sampling.\n22\nThe functions required to sample from a discrete probability distribution are available in any statistical software package.\nAll four model-based approaches allow unbiased inference under a \u201cmissing at random\u201d (MAR) mechanism\n23\nHere, MAR means that whether or not a GOSe observation is missing is independent of the true functional outcome status of the individual. GOSe is an interview-based assessment that can also be completed by a proxy. The main operational challenge for consistent collection of longitudinal GOSe for observational studies therefore lies in the organization and scheduling of the interviews. A MAR assumption for CENTER data was therefore deemed plausible, albeit is not testable.\n23\n\nPerformance assessment\nModel performance was assessed via threefold cross-validation on the subset of individuals with a valid GOSe value within 180\u2009\u00b1\u200914 days post-injury (\nn\n=\u20091083). All models were fit on the entire available data after removing the 180\u2009\u00b1\u200914 days post-injury observation from the respective test fold, thus mimicking a missing completely at random missing data mechanism. The distribution of GOSe values in the three test sets was well balanced, (Fig. S1). All confusion matrices are reported as averages over the threefold cross-validation test sets. The column fraction confusion matrices are normalized within each category of observed GOSe value and are thus estimates of confusion, probability conditional on the observed GOSe. Performance was assessed using the absolute-count and the normalized (proportions) confusion matrices as well as bias, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). Bias is calculated by averaging the signed differences between observed and imputed values. A negative value of bias signifies that predicted values are lower overall than observed values, and a positive value means that they are higher. If differences cancel each other out, then bias can be zero even if the the predictions are inaccurate. MAE employs the unsigned differences, and it therefore gives a measure of accuracy irrespective of whether imputed outcomes are higher or lower than observed. In the calculation of RMSE the differences are squared, which penalizes large deviations from the target value more strongly than small ones. For example, the MAE will be 0.5 if 50% of imputed values agree with observed values and 50% differ by one category. The same MAE will arise if 75% agree exactly and 25% disagree by two categories. In the former case the RMSE will be 0.71 and in the latter case it will be 1.0.\nThese metrics have some limitations with ordinal data, and we therefore also considered directional bias (d-bias), which was calculated as the difference between the model-fitted probability of exceeding the observed value and the model-fitted probability of undershooting the observed GOSe as an alternative measure of bias. It is important to note that the scale of the directional bias is not directly comparable with the one of the other three quantities. All measures were calculated in the data set that was conditional on the ground truth (observed 6-months GOSe) as well as averaged over the entire test set.\nLOCF, by design, cannot provide imputed values when there are no observations before 180 days post-injury. A valid comparison of LOCF with the other methods must therefore be based on the set of individuals for whom an LOCF imputation is possible. Overall, 118 out of 1083 test cases (10.9%) could not be imputed with the LOCF approach. In the entire study population, 345 individuals (10.3%) did not have data that would permit an LOCF imputation. The subset used for comparison of the imputation approaches with the LOCF approach was similar to the overall data set (\nTable 1\n)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nA total of 118 adult male Long Evans hooded rats (250\u2013350\u2009g; 10 weeks of age; Charles River Laboratories International, Wilmington, MA) were used. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR)/Naval Medical Research Center and the James J. Peters VA Medical Center. Experiments were conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and per the principles set forth in 2011 in the\nGuide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\nfrom the Institute of Laboratory Animals Resources, National Research Council, National Academy Press.\n\nBOP exposure\nRats were exposed to overpressure injury using a shock tube, which simulates the effects of air blast exposure under experimental conditions. The shock tube has a 0.32-m circular diameter and is a 5.94\u2009m-long steel tube divided into a 0.76-m compression chamber separated from a 5.18-m expansion chamber. The compression and expansion chambers are separated by polyethylene terephthalate Mylar TM sheets (Du Pont, Wilmington, DE) that control the peak pressure generated. The peak pressure at the end of the expansion chamber was determined with piezoresistive gauges designed specifically for pressure-time (impulse) measurements (Model 102M152, PCB, Piezotronics, Depew, NY).\nIndividual rats were anesthetized using an isoflurane gas anesthesia system consisting of a vaporizer, gas lines, and valves and an activated charcoal-scavenging system adapted for use with rodents. Rats were placed into a polycarbonate induction chamber, which was closed and immediately flushed with 5% isoflurane mixture in air for 2\u2009min. Rats were placed into a cone-shaped plastic restraint device and then placed in the shock tube.\nMovement was restricted further during the blast exposure using 1.5\u2009cm diameter flattened rubber tourniquet tubing. Three tourniquets were spaced evenly to secure the head region, the upper torso, and lower torso while the animal was in the plastic restraint cone. The end of each tubing was threaded through a toggle and run outside of the exposure cage where it was tied to firmly affix the animal and prevent movement during the blast overpressure exposure without restricting breathing.\nRats were assigned randomly to sham or blast conditions and were placed in the shock tube lying prone with the plane representing a line from the tail to the nose of the body in line with the longitudinal axis of the shock tube with the head placed more upstream. The total length of time under anesthesia including placement in the shock tube and execution of the blast procedure was typically less than 3\u2009min. Blast-exposed animals received 74.5\u2009kPa (equivalent to 10.8 psi, duration 4.8\u2009msec, impulse 175.8 kPa*msec) exposures administered one exposure per day for three consecutive days. Further details of the physical characteristics of the blast wave are described in Ahlers and associates.\n15\nControl (sham) exposed animals were treated identically including receiving anesthesia and being placed in the blast tube but did not receive a blast exposure.\nWithin 10 days after the last blast or sham exposure, animals were transported in a climate-controlled van from the WRAIR to the James J. Peters VA Medical Center (Bronx, NY,). Animals left in the morning from the WRAIR and arrived in the afternoon of the same day at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center, where all other procedures were performed.\n\nAnimal housing\nAnimals were housed at a constant 70\u201372\no\nF temperature with rooms on a 12:12\u2009h light cycle with lights on at 7 AM. All subjects were housed individually in standard clear plastic cages equipped with Bed-O'Cobs laboratory animal bedding (The Andersons, Maumee, OH) and EnviroDri nesting paper (Sheppard Specialty Papers, Milford, NJ). Access to food and water was\nad libitum.\nSubjects were housed on racks in random order to prevent rack position effects. Cages were coded to allow maintenance of blinding to groups during behavioral testing. All cohorts received the same treatment and handling.\n\nBehavioral testing\nThree cohorts of blast-exposed rats and controls were studied. The same protocols were used in each cohort with only the time of testing after blast exposure varying. The number of animals per cohort and the exact timing of testing of each cohort in relationship to blast exposure is described in\nTable 1\n.\nTable 1.\nTime following Blast Exposure when Behavioral Testing Was Conducted\nTask\nCohort 1\nCohort 2\nCohort 3\nN (tested early)\n20 blast and 18 control\n20 blast and 20 control\n20 blast and 20 control\nN (tested late)\n8 blast and 8 control\n12 blast and 12 control\nNot tested\nElevated zero maze\nEarly\n1 week\n3 weeks\n5 weeks\nLate\n36 weeks\n40 weeks\nNot performed\nLight dark escape\nEarly\n2 weeks\n3 weeks\n4 weeks\nLate\n36 weeks\n40 weeks\nNot performed\nNovel object recognition\nEarly\n2 weeks\n4 weeks\n6 weeks\nLate\nNot performed\n41 weeks\nNot performed\nFear conditioning\nEarly\n5 weeks\n5 weeks\n8 weeks\nLate\n36 weeks\n42 weeks\nNot performed\nOpen in a separate window\nElevated zero maze (EZM)\nThe apparatus consisted of a circular black Plexiglas runway 121.92\u2009cm in diameter and raised 76\u2009cm off the floor (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA). The textured runway itself was 5.08\u2009cm across and divided equally into alternating quadrants of open runway enclosed only by a 1.27\u2009cm lip and closed runway with smooth 15.24\u2009cm walls. All subjects received a 5-min trial beginning in a closed arc of the runway. During each trial, subjects were allowed to move freely around the runway, with all movement tracked automatically by a video camera placed on the ceiling directly above the maze.\nData were analyzed by ANYMAZE (San Diego Instruments, San Diego CA) yielding measures of total movement time and distance for the entire maze, as well as time spent and distance traveled in each of the individual quadrants. From the quadrant data, measures of total open and closed arc times, latency to enter an open arc, total open arm entries, and latency to completely cross an open arc between two closed arcs were calculated. Subject position was determined by centroid location.\nLight/dark emergence (LD)\nA light/dark emergence task was run in Versamax activity cages with opaque black Plexiglas boxes enclosing the left half of the interiors so that only the right sides were illuminated. Animals began in the dark side and were allowed to explore freely for 10\u2009min with access to the left (light) side through an open doorway located in the center of the monitor. Subject side preference and emergence latencies were tracked by centroid location with all movement automatically tracked and quantified. Light-side emergence latency, time to reach the center of the lighted side (light side center latency), and percent total light-side duration were calculated from beam breaks. All equipment was wiped clean between tests.\nNovel object recognition (NOR)\nRats were habituated to the arena (90\u2009cm length\n\u00d7\n60\u2009cm width\n\u00d7\n40\u2009cm height) for 20\u2009min, 24\u2009h before training. On the training day, two identical objects were placed on opposite ends of the empty arena, and the rat was allowed to explore the objects freely for 7\u2009min. After a 1-h delay, during which the rat was held in its home cage, one of the two familiar objects was replaced with a novel one, and the rat was allowed to explore freely the familiar and novel object (NO) for 5\u2009min to assess short-term memory (STM). After a 24-h delay, during which the rat was held in its home cage, one of the two familiar objects was replaced with a novel one different from the ones used during the STM. The rat was allowed to explore freely the familiar and NO for 5\u2009min to assess long-term memory (LTM).\nRaw exploration times for each object were expressed in seconds. Object exploration was defined as sniffing or touching the object with the vibrissae or when the animal's head was oriented toward the object with the nose placed at a distance of less than 2\u2009cm from the object. All sessions were recorded by video camera (Sentech, Carrollton, TX) and analyzed with ANYMAZE software (San Diego Instruments). In addition, offline analysis by an investigator blind to the blast-exposed status of the animals was performed. Objects to be discriminated were of different size, shape, and color and were made of plastic or metal material. The objects consisted of a 330\u2009mL soda can, a metal box, a cup, and a plastic tube. All objects were cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials.\nContextual and cued fear conditioning\nSound-attenuated isolation cubicles (Coulbourn Instruments, Holliston, MA) were utilized. Each cubicle was equipped with a grid floor for delivery of the unconditioned stimulus (US) and overhead cameras. All aspects of the test were controlled and monitored by the Freeze Frame conditioning and video tracking system (Actimetrics, Coulbourn Instruments). During training the chambers were scented with almond extract, lined with white paper towels, had background noise generated by a small fan, and were cleaned before and between trials with 70% ethanol.\nEach subject was placed inside the conditioning chamber for 2\u2009min before the onset of a conditioned stimulus (CS; an 80 dB, 2\u2009kHz tone), which lasted for 20\u2009sec with a coterminating 2-sec footshock (0.7\u2009mA; US). A total of three tone/shock pairings were administered with the first/second and second/third separated by 1\u2009min. Each rat remained in the chamber for an additional 40\u2009sec after the third CS-US pairing before being returned to its home cage.\nFreezing was defined as a lack of movement (except for respiration) in each 10-sec interval. Minutes 0\u20132 during the training session were used to measure baseline freezing. Contextual fear memory testing was performed 24\u2009h after the training session by measuring freezing behavior during a 4-min test in the conditioning chamber under conditions identical to those of the training session with the exception that no footshock or tone (CS or US) was presented.\nAnimals were returned to their home cage for another 24\u2009h at which time cued conditioning was tested. To create a new context with different properties, the chambers were free of background noise (fan turned off), lined with blue paper towels, scented with lemon extract, and cleaned before and during all trials with isopropanol. Each subject was placed in this novel context for 2\u2009min, and baseline freezing was measured, followed by exposure to the CS (20-sec tone) at 120 and 290\u2009sec.\n\nStatistical analysis\nValues are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. Comparisons were performed using repeated-measures ANOVA, or unpaired\nt\n-tests. When repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, sphericity was assessed using the Mauchly test. If the assumption of sphericity was violated (\np\n<\u20090.05, Mauchly test), significance was determined using the Greenhouse-Geisser correction. Statistical tests were performed using the program GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software) or SPSS v26 (IBM)."

    "Methods": "Study design and setting\nThis is a secondary analysis of a prospective observational cohort study conducted in a large tertiary children's hospital ED between March 2011 and January 2012.\n16\n\nParticipants\nParticipant and MRI/DTI data characteristics of this sample have been described previously.\n17\nBriefly, 43 adolescents (11 to 16 years old) were enrolled prospectively from the ED within 6\u2009h of a head or extremity injury. Concussion was defined as a head trauma involving either a blunt force or acceleration/deceleration injury with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)\n18\nscore of 14 to 15 on presentation to the ED with either loss of consciousness <30\u2009min or amnesia, or alteration in mental state at the time of injury. Isolated extremity orthopedic injury was defined by an Abbreviated Injury Severity Score <4 with a radiograph, and no suggestion of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) (i.e., loss of consciousness, amnesia, or altered mental state).\n19\n,\n20\nAdolescents with pre-existing neurological conditions, learning disabilities, behavioral disorders, or previous concussions were excluded. In addition, baseline behavioral, emotional, and social capacity was assessed by the child behavior checklist (CBCL)\n21\nand adolescents with a T-score \u226465 were excluded because of likelihood of pre-existing problems.\nThis study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. Parents of participants gave written informed consent and adolescents provided written assent.\n\nClinical assessments\nThe PCSS data for the index presentation to the ED and a follow-up clinic visit at one week were examined. The PCSS is a 22-item inventory of symptoms associated with concussion and is graded on a seven-point Likert scale with ratings of 0 and 6 corresponding to \u201cnone\u201d and \u201csevere,\u201d respectively, and a maximal range from 0 to 132.\n15\nThe primary outcome was symptomatic recovery, defined as a PCSS score at one week post-injury of \u22648 for girls and \u22646 for boys, because higher scores are reported in females than males.\n22\n\nDTI acquisition and data processing\nNeuroimaging data were obtained on a 3T Phillips scanner within 96\u2009h of injury. Forty-two participants were scanned within 72\u2009h post-injury, and one was scanned 72 to 96\u2009h post-injury. The DTI data were acquired with a single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with parameters: repetition time/echo time (TR/TE)\u2009=\u20099000/84\u2009msec; field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009256\n\u00d7\n256\u2009mm\n2\n; acquisition matrix\u2009=\u2009128\n\u00d7\n128; in-plane resolution\u2009=\u20092\n\u00d7\n2\u2009mm\n2\n; slice thickness\u2009=\u20092\u2009mm; slices\u2009=\u200976; 61 non-colinear diffusion-weighted directions (b\u2009=\u20091000\u2009s/mm\n2\n); one volume of images with no diffusion sensitization; sensitivity encoding factor 2. High resolution three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired with a 3D turbo field echo (TFE) sequence with parameters: TR/TE\u2009=\u20098.1/3.7\u2009msec; FOV\u2009=\u2009256\n\u00d7\n256; acquisition matrix\u2009=\u2009256\n\u00d7\n256; sagittal in-plain resolution\u2009=\u20091\n\u00d7\n1\u2009mm\n2\n; slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm; slices\u2009=\u2009180.\nHead motion and eddy current artifact were corrected by aligning all 61 non-colinear diffusion-weighted images with the b0 image using an affine transformation (linear image registration tool) implemented in the Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library (FSL) Diffusion Toolbox (Oxford, UK;\nwww.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl\n).\nThe high resolution T1-weighted images were down-sampled and registered to the 2\u2009mm-iso T1 brain template in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The inverse transformation was then calculated and used to transform the parcellated regions-of-interest (ROI) from the MNI space back to native space (to b0). In native space, diffusion tensor reconstruction was conducted using Diffusion Toolkit/TrackVis.\n23\n,\n24\nDiffusion tensor calculation was based on a linear least square fitting algorithm.\n24\nFor each of the 48 white matter regions, as determined with the John Hopkins University ICBM-DTI-81 white matter labels atlas,\n25\na voxel count was used to determine the volume of each ROI, and DTI measures including FA, mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were extracted using the\nfslstat\nfunction in the FSL software package. A total of 48 volumetric measures and 192 DTI measures were used as inputs for the machine learning analysis.\n\nMachine learning methodology\nA linguistic machine learning system based on a cascading GFT design was used.\n26\nAs seen in\nTable 1\n, this methodology is an evolution of genetic algorithms\n27\nand fuzzy systems\n28\nthat helps to mitigate scalability concerns of standard genetic fuzzy systems by breaking the problem space into many subdecisions. Variables that are coupled directly are placed in the same part of the controller, while \u201cslightly\u201d coupled variables are, at least, placed in the same branch of the tree structure to offset any decrease in accuracy because of unaccounted for coupling between variables. Although any genetic algorithm can be utilized to train such systems, for the reasons stated above, the EVE learning system (Thales USA), a patent-pending GFT with a fitness function for optimizing or training similar GFTs through recursive application, was used in the present study.\n29\u201331\nTable 1.\nMethodologies Underlying the Final Genetic Fuzzy Tree Structure\nOpen in a separate window\nOpen in a separate window\nBoth concussion and extremity-injury participant data were included to train the machine learning system, but trauma group was left undefined to provide a representative natural sample of inputs for the GFT, because symptoms on the PCSS are not specific to concussion and are common in ED settings.\n32\nIndeed, there was no statistical difference in the proportions of concussion and extremity injury participants with abnormal PCSS total scores at one week post-injury (12 [52.2%] vs. 7 [35.0%]; corrected\np\n>\u20090.05). Moreover, by leaving the trauma groups undefined, no subjectively assessed clinical data were incorporated into the GFT model, consistent with our stated aim to assess objective measures only.\nThe system was trained, then, using one week post-injury total PCSS scores, 48 volumetric MRI inputs, and 192 DTI inputs (48 each for FA and MD, AD, and RD) per participant over 225 training runs. Central inputs included middle cerebellar peduncle, pontine crossing tract, genu of the corpus callosum, body of the corpus callosum, splenium of the corpus callosum and fornix.\nBilateral inputs included right and left hemisphere corticospinal tract, medial lemniscus, inferior cerebellar peduncle, superior cerebellar peduncle, cerebellar peduncle, anterior limb of the internal capsule, posterior limb of the internal capsule, retrolenticular region of the anterior capsule, anterior corona radiata, superior corona radiata, posterior corona radiata, posterior thalamic radiation, sagittal striatum, external capsule, cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, fornix/stria terminalis, superior longitudinal fasciculus, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, uncinated fasciculus, and tapetum.\nEach training run contained a randomly selected \u223c80% of the total sample (\nn\n=\u200935). The model was constrained to five lateral levels or \u201cbranches\u201d at the top layer including one each for MRI volumetrics, FA, MD, AD, and RD DTI data. The middle layers combined inputs from upper branches and were constrained to three inputs from a directly higher level, which resulted in up to 125 linguistic \u201cif-then statements\u201d controlling any given fuzzy inference system (FIS; this was done to limit the computational cost of any FIS in particular, not necessarily with respect to the cost of evaluating that FIS for a given set of inputs, but rather for the cost associated with training a FIS of such immense size).\nIn total, 11,550 fuzzy if-then rules were created. Each FIS classified states (i.e., MRI and DTI values) into a number of membership functions (i.e., very low, low, medium, high, very high). It then created if-then statements (e.g., if cingulate gyrus FA is very high, and hippocampus volume is low, then PCSS reduction is very high), and these logic-based rules were used to control the system. Over training, then, membership functions for each imaging input were continually tuned and optimized and the if-then rule bases derived from them were \u201clearned.\u201d The final FIS was a three-input system utilizing \u201cMean of Maxima\u201d defuzzification methodology and outputted a binary classification of normal or abnormal PSCC scores independent of concussion or extremity-injury status.\nNeuroimaging values were provided to EVE, which was utilized to train the system to identify each participant's binary PCSS based recovery classification (yes or no). For each of\nn\nparticipants, the absolute value of % PCSS reduction was summed with either 1 or 0 if correctly classified as recovered. Recovery prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. It should be noted that although the number of input variables greatly outnumbered the number of observations, fuzzy logic is robust in training for complex problems with small data sets.\n33\n,\n34\n\nPerformance evaluation\nThe experimental runs examined the consistency of results across different participant combinations in training and validation. An 80/20 training/validation schedule was employed in each of 225 experimental runs. Each run included a different randomly selected distribution of the 43 participants with the stipulation that there be 15 and four non-recovered participants in each training and validation set, respectively. Performance was initially evaluated in GFT validation using a one-sample\nt\ntest with the population mean set at 50% accuracy. Good performance was defined by a significantly greater likelihood of correct recovery classification relative to chance.\nIn addition, the 225 experimental runs were used to compare the GFT method to six common linear classification or machine learning methods including: na\u00efve Bayes (NB), discriminant function analysis (DFA), radial basis function support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extra trees classifier (ETC), and nearest neighbor (NN). Performance was evaluated in the training and validation sets using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with follow-up Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) tests, on mean accuracy. In the validation sets, specificity was evaluated qualitatively across methods within a 10-point sensitivity range, and sensitivity was evaluated across methods within a 10-point specificity range.\nGood performance was defined primarily by a significant omnibus test as the result of more accurate performance by GFT relative to one or more of the comparison methods. Finally, accuracy distribution strata over the validation sets were examined to further characterize the data."

Exclusion criteria included unlikely to follow-up (e.g., low interest in participation, non-resident, homeless); significant medical history, debilitating mental or neurological disorders, or polytrauma that would interfere with follow-up; language other than English (or Spanish at sites enrolling Spanish speakers); being a prisoner or in custody; pregnancy; being on a mandated psychiatric hold; and current participation in an intervention trial.\nThe eligible sample for the current study comprised 1152 adult patients who enrolled in TRACK-TBI between February 2014 and May 2016 with GCS score\u2009=\u200913\u201315 at the time of ED arrival. Some analyses also used data from the TRACK-TBI orthopedic trauma comparison (OTC) group. OTC patients were enrolled with comparable inclusion and exclusion criteria, except that they did not show evidence of TBI (e.g., did not report or display alterations of consciousness or amnesia) and were not required to have had a head CT scan. OTC patients were eligible for inclusion in the current analysis if the window for their 12-month assessment had elapsed by May 2019 (\nn\n=\u2009258; the included OTC patients were enrolled in TRACK-TBI from January 2016 through April 2018). Due to attrition or missing data on predictor variables, sample sizes for the models of life satisfaction range from 744 to 894 (see table notes for details).\n\nProcedure\nAll patients or their legal representatives gave written informed consent prior to participation. Baseline assessment was conducted in-person by trained study personnel, as soon as possible after ED evaluation. Information regarding socio-demographic characteristics, pre-injury history, and the presenting injury was collected directly from patients and from medical records. Outcome data were collected in-person at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post-injury; and by telephone at 3 months post-injury. Other follow-up visits were occasionally conducted via phone if in-person assessment was not possible. Study protocols were approved by the institutional review boards at each participating site.\n\nMeasures\nSatisfaction with life was measured using the SWLS.\n15\nThe SWLS is a five-item scale that assesses an individual's global satisfaction with his or her life. Respondents rate their level of agreement with statements (e.g.,\nin most ways my life is close to my ideal\n) using a 7-point Likert-style scale (1\u2009=\nstrongly disagree\nto 7\u2009=\nstrongly agree\n). Ratings of each item are summed, yielding total scores ranging from 5 to 35. In the current study, the total SWLS score was prorated if four of the items were completed.\nSWLS guidelines suggest that scores <20 reflect varying levels of dissatisfaction with life; scores of 20\u201324 reflect general satisfaction with life, but with desire for improvement in some areas (mean scores from general population samples in economically developed nations generally fall in this range); and scores\n>\n25 indicate higher levels of satisfaction.\n27\nThe scale and its cutoffs have been validated in samples representative of the general population of the United States and other countries.\n27\nThe total SWLS score was the outcome for the models of satisfaction with life at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. Additionally, a dichotomous variable was derived (SWLS score <20\u2009=\u20091; SWLS score\n>\n20\u2009=\u20090) to enable estimation of the prevalence of significant dissatisfaction with life within the mTBI and OTC groups.\nThe TRACK-TBI baseline and outcome assessments contained an extensive set of measures that could be considered as predictors of satisfaction with life. We considered a broad range of socio-demographic and injury-related variables, as prior studies had not comprehensively evaluated these baseline characteristics in relation to life satisfaction after mTBI. Prior TBI and other (non-TBI) neurological history were considered, to evaluate whether pre-existing neurological vulnerabilities contributed to prediction of life satisfaction after mTBI. Pre-injury psychiatric history was included, given the aforementioned evidence of associations between mental health symptoms and satisfaction with life. With respect to concurrent symptom measures, we aimed to consider a variety of domains while minimizing overlap among the variables.\nWe prioritized measures of post-TBI symptoms, affective symptoms, insomnia, and pain because these symptoms are commonly reported by patients with mTBI; and prior studies suggest links between these symptom domains and life satisfaction in individuals with mTBI (\nsee Introduction\nsection). Several measures of affective symptoms were available, all of which were highly inter-correlated. Given this, we opted to focus on the broad constructs of negative affect and positive affect. This decision was further based on evidence indicating that positive emotions are more strongly associated with life satisfaction than negative emotions in the general population\n26\n\u2014a possibility that has not previously been evaluated among individuals with TBI. We also considered affective symptoms as assessed by the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ),\n28\ngiven the prominence of this measure in TBI outcome assessment and because, unlike other available measures, it specifically evaluated affective symptoms that the patient attributed to the TBI. Details follow regarding the measures of the independent variables considered in the analyses.\nSocio-demographic characteristics and pre-injury clinical history\nSocio-demographic data collected during the baseline interview included self-reported age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital status, years of education, and employment status. Due to low representation of some groups, marital status was coded as Never Married versus Married (includes domestic partner) versus Previously Married (divorced, separated, or widowed); and employment status was coded as Unemployed versus Employed, Student, or Retired. Race was coded as Black versus White or Other; the White and Other groups were collapsed because their SWLS scores were similar at each follow-up, whereas SWLS scores within the Black group were significantly lower.\nThe baseline TRACK-TBI interview contained three questions about treatment for mental health problems. Patients who reported any history of inpatient treatment, outpatient treatment/counseling, or pharmacotherapy for mental health problems were considered to have a pre-injury psychiatric history. The interview also assessed whether patients had ever had a brain or neurological illnesses before the injury (e.g., epilepsy, tumor, stroke). Patients who responded affirmatively were classified as having a prior neurological disorder. The interview assessed history of prior TBI separately, using a semi-structured assessment\n29\nthat inquired about\ninjuries to your head or neck that you may have had at any time in your life\n. Patients were classified as having prior TBI if they reported\n>\n1 head/neck injury that resulted in alteration/loss of consciousness (LOC) or post-traumatic amnesia (PTA).\nInjury characteristics\nMedical records and information obtained from patients during the baseline interview were used to categorize injury cause; presence versus absence of major extracranial injury (ECI), LOC, or PTA; and neuroimaging results (positive or negative findings referable to trauma on head CT). Following a previous TRACK-TBI study,\n30\nspecific injury causes were coded as accidental (e.g., road traffic accident, incidental fall) versus violent (e.g., assault). Major ECI was coded as \u201cpresent\u201d if the patient had an Injury Severity Score\n31\n(ISS) >2 for any non-head/neck region, and \u201cabsent\u201d if a complete injury record showed ISS for all non-head/neck regions\n<\n2 or if the patient had been discharged from the ED. In all other cases, major ECI was coded \u201cunknown\u201d and treated as missing. LOC and PTA were dichotomized as \u201cyes\u201d versus \u201cno,\u201d with \u201csuspected\u201d treated as yes and \u201cunknown\u201d treated as missing. CT scans were completed within 24\u2009h of injury and read by a board-certified neuroradiologist; for this study CT results were categorized as \u201cpositive\u201d versus \u201cnegative\u201d (i.e., evidence of acute intracranial injury vs. no intracranial injury).\nPost-TBI symptoms\nThe RPQ\n28\nis a 16-item scale that evaluates symptoms that may occur after TBI. The version of the RPQ used during follow-up visits assessed symptoms that had occurred over the past 7 days. The RPQ instructions direct respondents to rate each symptom on a scale from 0 (\nnot experienced at all\n) to 4 (\nsevere problem\n). Prior to deriving summary scores, item ratings of 1 (\nno more of a problem than before\n) are recoded as 0, given that they reflect stability of pre-existing symptoms as opposed to onset or worsening of symptoms after TBI.\n28\nA recent psychometric investigation of the RPQ found strong support for a bifactor model, in which most of the variance in RPQ items was explained by a general factor (supporting a largely unidimensional structure).\n32\nHowever, given our interest in the relationships of specific symptom domains to satisfaction with life, we opted to derive RPQ subscales based on a four-factor correlated factor model that also demonstrated good fit for the item-level RPQ data.\n32\nThe four subscales derived for use in the current analysis were: RPQ-somatic (headaches, dizziness, nausea, noise sensitivity, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and restlessness), RPQ-cognitive (forgetfulness, poor concentration, and taking longer to think), RPQ-visual (blurred vision, light sensitivity, and double vision), and RPQ-emotional (feeling irritable, depressed, and frustrated).\nInsomnia\nThe Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)\n33\nis a seven-item scale that assesses problems related to sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and awakening; dissatisfaction with sleep patterns; interference of sleep problems with daily functioning; and noticeable impairments and level of distress due to sleep dysfunction in the last 2 weeks. The ISI has been validated in samples of individuals with a history of TBI.\n34\nRatings of symptom severity/dissatisfaction range from 0 (\nnot at all\n) to 4 (\nextremely\n). Ratings of all items are summed to create a total ISI score (range 0\u201328), with higher scores indicating worse insomnia. The total ISI score was prorated if six of the seven items were completed.\nPain\nThe impact of pain on participants' daily lives was assessed using the Participant Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Short Form v1.0 Pain Interference 4a scale,\n35\nwhich has been validated in various patient populations.\n36\n,\n37\nThe scale comprises four items that assess the degree to which pain has interfered with day-to-day activities, work around the home, social activities, and household chores over the past 7 days. Interference in each domain is rated on a 5-point scale with options ranging from\nnot at all\nto\nvery much\n. Item ratings are summed and then converted to T-scores (mean [M]\u2009=\u200950, standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u200910) that reflect overall pain interference.\nPain severity was also measured at follow-up visits using the PROMIS Short Form v1.0 Pain Intensity 3a scale.\n38\nPreliminary analyses revealed that Pain Intensity and Pain Interference were highly correlated (\nr\n=\u20090.84); thus, we retained just one of these for inclusion in the models of satisfaction with life. Pain Interference was chosen based on its stronger bivariate association with the outcome.\nPositive and negative affect\nLow positive affect/anhedonia was measured using three items from the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5), a validated 20-item questionnaire that assesses the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition\n(DSM-5) criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder.\n39\n,\n40\nPCL-5 items measure the severity of symptoms during the past month on a scale ranging from 0 (\nnot at all\n) to 4 (\nextremely\n). The items selected for measurement of anhedonia were based on factor analytic evidence showing that the items assessing\nloss of interest in activities that you used to enjoy\n,\nfeeling distant or cut off from other people\n, and\ntrouble experiencing positive feelings\ncomprise a distinct factor.\n41\nRatings of these items were summed to create an Anhedonia score (range 0\u201312), with higher scores indicating more severe anhedonia (i.e., lower levels of positive affect).\nFactor analyses further indicate that the PCL-5 items that assess\nhaving strong negative beliefs about yourself, other people, or the world\n;\nblaming yourself or someone else for the stressful experience or what happened after it\n; and\nhaving strong negative feelings like fear, horror, anger, guilt, or shame\ncomprise a distinct factor.\n41\nRatings of these three items were summed to create a Negative Affect score (range 0\u201312), with higher scores indicating greater negative affect. We selected items from the PCL-5 rather than similar items from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)\n42\nor Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18)\n43\nbecause of the aforementioned factor analytic evidence supporting derivation of distinct PCL-5 subscales representing low positive affect (anhedonia) and negative affect. Widely accepted factor models of the PHQ-9 and BSI-18 do not support use of subscales corresponding to these domains.\n44\n,\n45\n\nStatistical analysis\nPropensity score weights were generated using generalized boosted regression models for each visit to account for missing outcomes at follow-up visits. No imputations were made for missing data on predictor variables. Weights-adjusted multi-variable linear regression was used to evaluate the associations of baseline and concurrent symptom measures with SWLS scores at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. Prior to fitting the regression models, an L1-regularization path algorithm\n46\nwas used to select an optimal subset of measures for prediction of SWLS score at each follow-up visit, based on the lowest Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The independent variables entered into the algorithm were: age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital status, employment status, years of education, pre-injury psychiatric history, pre-injury neurological history, prior TBI, injury cause, major ECI, LOC, PTA, CT results, RPQ-somatic, RPQ-cognitive, RPQ-visual, RPQ-emotional, insomnia, pain interference, anhedonia, and negative affect. Scores on all concurrent symptom predictors were standardized prior to analysis, so that the regression coefficients would be readily interpretable (i.e., would indicate expected change in SWLS score associated with a 1 SD increase in the symptom score). Final regression models were fit using the empirically selected measures as predictors of SWLS score at each follow-up. All analyses were conducted using the statistical software R (version 3.6.1;\nhttp://www.r-project.org\n)."

(The 3-month follow-up, conducted by phone, did not assess cognition.) The BTACT was added to the 6-month follow-up protocol to provide preliminary data on its validity and utility. The BTACT was to be performed \u00b17 days of the 6-month in-person assessment, which was achieved in 98.1% of participants with BTACT data (time from in-person to phone assessment median\u2009=\u20092 days;\nM\n=\u20092.3,\nSD\n=\u20093.2). All seven BTACT subtests were complete in 99.4% of BTACT assessments.\n\nNeuropsychological assessment measures\nBTACT\nThe cognitive tests included in the current study are listed in\nTable 2\n. The BTACT comprises seven subtests, several adapted from widely used paper-and-pencil tests of neuropsychological functioning. Form A of the BTACT was administered. The BTACT subtests measure verbal episodic memory (via one immediate recall trial of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test [RAVLT] Form 1 and one delayed recall trial, score range 0\u201315 for each trial), auditory working memory (i.e., backward trials from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2013Third Edition [WAIS-III] Digit Span test, scored as longest correct span from 2\u20138), semantic verbal fluency (Animal Naming Test), inductive reasoning (Number Series, in which the participant completes the pattern in a series of numbers, range 0\u20135), and processing speed (30 Seconds And Counting Task, or 30-SACT; the number of digits produced by counting backward from 100 in 30\u2009sec). The optional Stop and Go Switch Task (SGST) was administered but not included in analyses because audio recordings needed to score response latencies were not collected.\nTable 2.\nList of Cognitive Assessments\nTheoretical construct(s) assessed\nPhone tests (BTACT)\na\nWord list recall (RAVLT learning trial 1 and delayed recall)\nVerbal episodic memory\nDigits span backward (WAIS-III)\nAuditory working memory\nCategory fluency/Animal Naming Test\nSemantic verbal fluency/semantic memory retrieval\nNumber Series\nInductive reasoning\n30 Seconds and Counting\nProcessing speed\nIn-person paper-and-pencil tests\nRAVLT\nVerbal episodic memory\nTrail Making Test\nPsychomotor processing speed and set-shifting\nWAIS-IV Processing Speed Index\nPsychomotor processing speed\nIn-person computerized tests (NIH Toolbox)\nPicture Vocabulary\nReceptive vocabulary, estimated general verbal intelligence\nPattern Comparison\nProcessing speed\nPicture Sequence Memory\nVisual episodic memory\nList Sorting\nWorking memory\nFlanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test\nAttention, inhibitory control\nDimensional Change Card Sorting Test\nCognitive flexibility\nOpen in a separate window\na\nThe BTACT Stop and Go subtest was administered but was not included in the present analyses because audio recordings were not available to score response times.\nBTACT, Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone; NIH, National Institutes of Health; RAVLT, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test; WAIS, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.\nOther cognitive performance measures\nParticipants completed a series of neuropsychological tests at the in-person visit, including paper-and-pencil tests of verbal episodic memory (RAVLT\n16\n), processing speed (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2013Fourth Edition Processing Speed Index [WAIS-IV PSI]),\n17\nand executive functioning (Trail Making Test [TMT]).\n18\nDifferent RAVLT forms were administered across the 2-week (Form 2),\n19\n6-month in-person (Form 3), and 6-month BTACT (Form 1) assessment. Prior studies have found these alternate forms to be equivalent and serial administration of alternate forms to cause minimal practice effects.\n19\n,\n20\nAdditionally, participants completed modules of the computerized National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Cognition Battery intended to estimate receptive vocabulary/estimated verbal intellectual functioning (Picture Vocabulary Test, TPVT), processing speed (Pattern Comparison), visual episodic memory (Picture Sequence Memory Test [PSMT]), working memory (List Sorting), attention/inhibitory control (Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test [Flanker]), and cognitive flexibility (Dimensional Change Card Sort Test [DCCS]).\n21\nAll subtests except for the TPVT were aggregated into a Fluid Reasoning Composite score by the NIH Toolbox scoring software. Unstandardized scale scores (i.e., standardized against the entire NIH Toolbox normative sample but not demographically corrected; normative sample\nM\n=\u2009100 and\nSD\n=\u200915) were used for all NIH Toolbox indices in this article.\nSymptoms\nSelf-report symptom scales were administered at the in-person visit to estimate the severity of symptoms in the domains of TBI/injury symptoms (Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire [RPQ]; ratings of \u201c1\u201d were not counted in total scores),\n22\nemotional distress (18-item Brief Symptom Inventory [BSI-18]),\n23\ndepression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]),\n24\n,\n25\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 [PCL-5]),\n26\nTBI-related quality of life (6-item Quality of Life after Brain Injury Overall Scale [QOLIBRI-OS]),\n27\nhealth-related quality of life (12-item Short Form Health Survey [SF-12]),\n28\nand general life satisfaction (Satisfaction With Life Scale [SWLS]).\n29\nFunctional outcome\nThe Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) was used to evaluate the impact of the traumatic injury on daily functioning.\n30\nThe GOS-E was assessed via structured interview with patients or proxies.\n31\nRespondents were asked to report new injury-related dependence or difficulties in several domains of life function. For the current study, changes in function were counted irrespective of whether they resulted from TBI or other injury-related factors (e.g., peripheral injuries). Score ranges in this sample were 3\u20138, where 3\u2009=\u2009Lower Severe Disability and 8\u2009=\u2009Upper Good Recovery.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll available BTACT data were used in factor analyses, measurement invariance analyses, and group comparisons. The 1.9% of case patients who completed the BTACT more than \u00b17 days of the in-person neuropsychological assessment were excluded from analyses comparing BTACT with other clinical outcomes.\nFactor structure and group invariance of the BTACT\nWe performed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to cross-validate the fit of the 2-factor structure of the BTACT previously derived by the instrument's authors and validated in a general community sample.\n8\n,\n32\nThis model posits the existence of two correlated factors, an Episodic Memory factor on which both the immediate and delayed recall trial of the RAVLT load, and an EF factor on which all other core subtests load. Because of the conceptual appeal of a global BTACT composite score, as well as precedence in the literature for computing a single composite score,\n7\n,\n13\nwe also considered the possibility of a 1-factor model or a bifactor model (on which all items load on a general factor as well as independent specific factors to account for residual correlations between specified items). Factor models were tested using maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors (MLR). Evidence of good fit was determined\na priori\nto be established from commonly recommended fit statistics: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) <0.06 and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) >0.95.\n33\nWe anticipated that the \u03c7\n2\nGoodness of Fit Test would be significant (i.e., suggestive of inadequate model fit) as an artifact of this index's oversensitivity to minor deviations in fit in large samples.\nMeasurement invariance modeling was carried out to establish the degree to which the BTACT reflects the same constructs between different TBI severity groups and the OTC group. This was tested through a series of CFA models in which we imposed increasingly stringent constraints on the equivalence of model parameters between groups: 1) that the same items load on the same factors, allowing other parameters to vary between groups (configural invariance); 2) that, additionally, factor loadings are equivalent between groups (weak invariance); 3) that, additionally, item intercepts are equivalent between groups (strong invariance); and 4) that, additionally, residual variances are equivalent between groups (strict invariance). Strong or strict invariance is generally considered to be a good outcome because it allows one to interpret differences between groups in factor means to fully reflect differences between groups on the underlying constructs of interest. By convention, we\na priori\ndecided to conclude that the BTACT had a higher level of invariance if imposing the additional constraints of that invariance model did not decrease model fit by more than 0.01 in CFI\n34\nor 0.015 in RMSEA.\n35\nFactor and group invariance modeling was conducted using\nMplus\nversion 8.3.\n36\nThe sample was stratified into four groups: the OTC group and three TBI strata. TBI strata were defined using historical markers of injury severity: admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13\u201315 without acute intracranial abnormalities on computed tomography (CT) scans (mild TBI [mTBI] CT-), GCS 13\u201315 with acute intracranial abnormalities (mTBI CT+), and GCS 3\u201312 (moderate-severe TBI). Differences between groups in latent mean episodic memory and executive function performances were compared in\nMplus\nfor the strict invariance model.\nConvergent and discriminant validity of the BTACT\nTo evaluate to what degree the BTACT measures what it is purported to measure (i.e., CoI) we examined correlations between BTACT subtest and factor scores and other available neuropsychological measures collected at the 6-month follow-up (e.g., self-report, interview, and cognitive performance measures). Pearson correlations (\nr\n) are reported for all measures except for the ordinal GOS-E, for which we computed Spearman correlations (\u03c1). Given the study aims, we were primarily interested in the overall and relative magnitude of associations.\nRelationship between BTACT performance and injury (TBI, orthopedic trauma) and TBI severity\nFinally, we evaluated the sensitivity of the BTACT to TBI severity (i.e., PoU) by comparing performance among TBI severity groups and between each TBI severity group and the OTC group. The sensitivity of the BTACT was compared with other available neurocognitive measures. Group comparisons were carried out using general linear models (GLM) adjusted for age, sex, and education and with patterns of missing outcomes adjusted using propensity weights.\n37\nPropensity weights were derived separately by measure type (GOS-E, self-report, neuropsychological) from boosted logistic regression models predicting completion versus non-completion of outcomes from enrollment site and demographic, history, and injury variables. Weights were proportional to the inverse of the probability of measure completion and normed so the sum equaled the number of cases with the measure actually completed.\nGroup effect sizes were reported as Cohen's\nd\n(with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]). Comparisons that remained significant after multiple comparison correction (within outcome assessment type and time-point using a 5% false discovery rate)\n38\nare bolded in the tables and discussed.\nPropensity probabilities were generated using the \u201ctwang\u201d software package developed for R (version 3.2.2), which was accessed via script files generated by a SAS macro package (version 9.3). Other statistical analyses were conducted in IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (version 19)."

These treatments included EPO (low dose; 5000 IU/kg), EPO (high dose; 10,000 IU/kg), LEV (low dose; 54\u2009mg/kg), LEV (high dose; 170\u2009mg/kg), MIN (30\u2009mg/kg +2\u2009mg/kg each hour for 72\u2009h), NIC (low dose; 50\u2009mg/kg 15\u2009min and 24\u2009h post-surgery), NIC (high dose; 500\u2009mg/kg 15\u2009min and 24\u2009h post-surgery), AMT (low dose; 10\u2009mg/kg 15\u2009min and for 21 days post-surgery), and AMT (high dose; 45\u2009mg/kg 15\u2009min and for 21 days post-surgery). These doses were tested based on the published literature in which similar drugs were evaluated in TBI models. All studies that generated the data used in the current analysis were approved and supervised by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Miami. From a computational perspective, this portion of the OBTT data set is tabular (flat file), complete (no missing values), and pure (minimal noise).\nTable 1\nshows the measurements we determined to be appropriate for use in our ML models.

Biomarker assessments of UCH-L1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) serum levels were conducted at 4\u2009h and 24\u2009h post-FPI.\n26\nThe exploratory cylinder task to assess forelimb use was conducted 7 days after surgery. The Morris water maze task to assess learning and memory was conducted over days 14\u201318 post-FPI and was followed by a probe trial to assess memory retention.\n\nData pre-processing and feature engineering\nThe complete list of features included as well as the processing steps that each metric underwent can be found in\nTable 1\n. Briefly, our curated data set included a total of 92 rat subjects and nine features across three feature groups. For all metrics, we applied z-score normalization to avoid introducing arbitrary weights in the form of scaling. Feature engineering techniques included change over time, averaging performance across trials, and assessing the percentage of time spent successfully completing the assessment. These processing steps were applied where appropriate with the goal of accurately informing the machine of the relevant information provided by each metric without imposing redundancy (\nTable 1\n).\n\nMachine learning\nSupervised learning classifiers from the scikit-learn toolkit in Python were trained and evaluated for their performance on this data set.\n27\nThe techniques chosen included a baseline dummy classifier (DUMB), classification and regression tree (CART), random forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), na\u00efve-bayes (NB), and support vector machines (SVM). The default settings suggested by the toolkit were utilized.\nIn these studies, we defined our input as metrics from all feature groups collected prior to euthanasia (i.e., physiology, biomarkers, motor, and cognition) to define our multi-variate, recovery space. We then aimed to understand if the administration of different therapies resulted in different underlying profiles in this space. Therefore, the output class is defined as administered therapy on the premise that, if the machine can accurately predict which treatment each sample received, identifiable patterns and correlations unique to each treatment must exist in this space. In total, the findings from more than 112 supervised learning classifiers are described in this article.\n\nPairwise comparisons\nThe ML classifiers were trained on 14 separate data sets that represent each of the potential combinations of different pharmacotherapies (\nFig. 1\n). These classifiers were assessed for their ability to learn which treatment each subject received given the defined input metrics.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nAn image visualizing each of the pairwise comparisons that were completed in the following analyses. Note that for each of the comparisons between pharmacotherapies of separate identity, the higher dose was used. The lower-dose data sets were only utilized for the intra-therapy comparisons where two doses were available (EPO, LEV, NIC, and AMT). AMT, amantadine; EPO, erythropoietin; LEV, levetiracetam; MIN, minocycline; NIC, nicotinamide.\nIn each case where the comparison was between drugs of different identity, the higher dose was utilized when applicable. All pairwise comparisons of EPO, LEV, MIN, NIC, and AMT were assessed. Further, instances where two doses were available in the original data set were tested for their ability to be distinguished from each other.\n\nValidation of models\nTo validate our ML classifiers, we used a stratified k-fold cross validation approach, with k set to 10. The data set was sectioned into 10 folds and the model was then trained with 9 of the folds and tested with the remaining 1 fold (i.e., the model was tested on examples it had never seen before). Further, each fold was used as the testing fold in separate runs. This was repeated until each fold had acted as the test fold and the mean performance\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error reported with a 95% confidence interval. To eliminate the chance for model-initialization bias, cross-validation was repeated 20 times and the mean testing accuracy was reported. Estimation statistics were used in place of standard hypothesis testing and the subsequent generation of a\np-\nvalue given that the core assumption of independence is violated in these multivariate analyses. Additionally, the stratified version of k-fold cross validation ensured that the balance of each class was represented equally across all folds, which is important when working with an imbalanced class attribute, so the model could learn patterns of all classes that it attempted to distinguish between.\n27\n\nPrincipal component analysis\nTo reveal the internal structure of the data in a way that best explains the variance throughout and determine the importance of employing multivariate analyses, we utilized the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm from the scikit-learn library in Python. This analysis was applied to determine whether individual features or a combination of metrics were contributing substantively to the variance in our data set.\n\nLeave one feature group out assessment\nTo determine whether the classifier's ability to distinguish between treatments was driven largely by individual feature groups, we repeated each of the first 10 comparisons with the individual feature groups removed and assessed the prediction accuracy of the model.\n\nReporting performance\nClassification accuracy\nThe primary form of performance assessment reported is the classification (prediction) accuracy achieved. This was calculated as the number of correct predictions relative to the total number of attempts and was reported as a percentage.\nConfusion matrices\nIn instances where prediction accuracy was not notably better than the baseline classifier, we further assessed model performance by visualizing its predictions in a confusion matrix, which comprises a table in which each section presents a unique value corresponding to correct positive and negative predictions as well as false-positives and false-negatives for each class identity (\nFig. 2\n). This identifies whether a model is routinely mistaking one class for another.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nThe layout of a confusion matrix as well as the values associated with the precision, recall, and F1-score metrics of model performance.\nPrecision, recall, and F1 scores\nIn the instances where prediction accuracy failed to exceed baseline performance in any of the tested models, we report the precision, recall, and corresponding F1 score achieved by each classifier. The precision was calculated as the number of positive predictions divided by the number of predicted positive class values, thus providing a measure of exactness (a representative sample is visualized in corresponding confusion matrices). The recall, on the other hand, was calculated as the number of true positives divided by the number of false-negatives, thus providing a measure of completeness. These two values were then used to define the balance between the two metrics in the form of an F1 score."

    "Methods": "This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Cincinnati and was performed with a waiver from informed consent.\n\nSetting, enrollment, and data abstraction\nThis time-limited, retrospective, single-center observational nested case-control study included all adult patients with SDH who presented to a Level 1 trauma center in 2018. Patients were identified using the\nInternational Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision\n(ICD-10) codes (S06.5, I62.0).\n15\nUsing a standardized case report form, two board-certified neurologists (D.R. and L.P.) reviewed initial imaging and abstracted data on demographics, laboratory test results, medical history, admission vital signs, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, history and time of injury or last known well (in the rare cases without a witnessed trauma), surgical management, hospital course, discharge destination, and score on the modified Rankin Scale.\nOf all identified patients, 10% were double abstracted to ensure accuracy. From this cohort, we identified patients who met the following inclusion criteria: an acute SDH (defined radiologically\n16\n) visualized on pre-operative imaging, and follow-up head imaging in the early time period, delayed time period, or both time periods. As the purpose of this study was to examine enlargement of conservatively managed ASDHs, the only exclusion criterion was undergoing a neurosurgical procedure prior to the follow-up imaging. Neurosurgical management in response to expansion was not exclusionary. Surgical decision-making was left to the discretion of the treating neurosurgeon, although in general our institution adheres to the 2006 Guidelines for the Surgical Management of Acute Subdural Hematomas proposed by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons,\n3\nwith the caveat that some larger ASDHs are managed conservatively if the patient's neurological exam status is intact.\nThere were two arms to this study, the early follow-up cohort and the delayed follow-up cohort. Eligible patients could be analyzed in one or both cohorts. To be analyzed in the early follow-up cohort, patients were required to have at least one follow-up head image in the first 72\u2009h. To be analyzed in the delayed follow-up cohort, patients were required to have at least one follow-up head image more than 72\u2009h after the time of injury. Similar to the protocol in a recent study in intracerebral hemorrhage,\n17\npatients with early expansion remained eligible for the delayed follow-up cohort. All timing was determined based on injury/last known well time, not hospital presentation time. Seventy-two hours was chosen as the cutoff between early and delayed periods based on histopathological studies that suggest neomembranes begin to form around this time.\n13\nWe capped eligible follow-up imaging at 1 month (31 days) from injury, based on data showing that surgery is rarely needed past this time.\n4\nImaging decisions were made at the discretion of the treating physicians. It is common at our institution to obtain a follow-up head computed tomography (CT) scan 6\u2009h after the initial head CT scan in all patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (tICH), unless there is a decline determined by neurological exam in which case the follow-up scan is obtained earlier. A delayed CT scan is then obtained approximately 2 weeks after presentation, although some patients deemed low risk by the treating physician will not receive a delayed scan. Regarding coagulopathy management, our institutional targets for patients with ASDH include a platelet count >100,000 along with an international normalized ratio <1.4. At the discretion of the treating physician, all patients on antithrombotics had those medications reversed. When the decision was made to reverse, anticoagulants were reversed with the appropriate antidote, which included vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrate, or fresh frozen plasma in the case of vitamin K antagonists. For factor Xa inhibitors, patients received either prothrombin complex concentrate or coagulation factor Xa (recombinant) inactivated-zhzo. When deemed necessary, antiplatelet medications were reversed with platelet transfusions and/or desmopressin acetate. At the time of this study, tranexamic acid was not used for head trauma at our institution.\n\nDefinition of cases and controls\nFor both the early and delayed follow-up cohorts, cases were defined by the presence of SDH expansion on follow-up imaging in the appropriate time period. ASDH expansion was considered an increase in the maximum SDH thickness or volume (using the ABC/2 method for convexity ASDHs)\n18\nof more than 20% from the prior scan.\n19\nIn patients with early expansion, delayed expansion was only documented if the SDH significantly enlarged from the last stable image. Interval subdural hygroma formation distant to the ASDH was not considered expansion. Preference was given to direct visual comparison of SDHs by the study authors, but radiology reports were considered as acceptable for comparison if clear measurements were given and images were unavailable. Controls were defined as patients with no expansion on follow-up head imaging in the appropriate interval. No matching was performed. To determine the interrater reliability of our definition of ASDH expansion, 10% of cases and controls were double reviewed; the resultant Cohen's kappa statistic was 0.81, suggesting excellent interrater reliability of our definition.\n\nVariables\nWe selected variables for analysis from both studies of progressive traumatic hemorrhagic injury\n20\u201322\nand studies of delayed ASDH surgery.\n8\n,\n9\n,\n23\nInitial systolic blood pressure (SBP) was defined as the initial measurement that was documented upon arrival at our institution. Neuroworsening was defined as any worsening in exam temporally matched to the SDH expansion identified on imaging, using the standard definition.\n24\nWe also defined a separate term of \u201csevere symptomatic expansion,\u201d which referred to neuroworsening severe enough to lead to emergent surgery or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. We defined coagulopathy as an international normalized ratio >1.3 or platelet count <100,000 on admission, which was utilized in prior studies of progressive traumatic hemorrhagic injury.\n25\nSDH location was analyzed as a dichotomous variable, either along the convexities or in the parafalcine/tentorial region.\n4\nMidline shift was assessed at the septum pellucidum.\n26\nTrauma was dichotomized into no or minimal trauma (with falls from standing and from elevations up to 3 ft included in this category) versus all other trauma.\n27\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor demographic comparison of the two cohorts, univariable analysis was conducted using chi-squared tests for all categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables (no continuous variables were normally distributed). To look at factors associated with early and delayed expansion, univariable and multi-variable analyses were performed using logistic regression. Only variables with <5% missing values were considered for this analysis; analysis was thus performed by complete case analysis without imputation. Variables with a\np\n-value of <0.1 on univariable analysis were considered for multi-variable regression models, which were built using\np\n-values in a forward stepwise approach with a\np\n-value of 0.05 being considered significant. Age (per 10 years) was included in both models regardless of\np\n-value considering the known age-dependence of ASDHs.\n28\nInitial SBP was analyzed both as a continuous variable and as a dichotomized variable (>160) on univariable analysis, but only the dichotomized version was selected for multi-variable analysis. Considering the possibility for crossover between cases and controls from the early to the delayed phase of the study, we performed a sensitivity analysis wherein we developed a multi-variable model in the delayed cohort after excluding all patients with early expansion. Because SDH volume was only available for convexity SDHs (and thus was missing for a significant number of patients), it could not be used as a variable in the primary model; instead, a subgroup analysis of convexity SDHs was performed that allowed volume to be included."

    "Methods": "Ten female Yucatan minipigs each weighing \u223c9\u201313\u2009kg were independently evaluated and screened for pre-existing disease 3\u20137 days prior to the surgical procedure. Baseline flash fVEP were obtained at this time with a RETeval handheld electrophysiology device (LKC Technologies; Gaithersburg, MD) to ensure objective evidence of visual function. Access to the orbital portion of the optic nerve was achieved by lateral orbitotomy. Once generous exposure of the optic nerve was obtained (mean post-initial anesthesia time\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD): 5\u2009h 21\u2009min \u00b149\u2009min), blood was drawn from the right saphenous vein using standard phlebotomy techniques. A 23 gauge butterfly needle and lavender top tubes were used to collect two mL of whole blood immediately before and then 1\u2009h after traumatic optic nerve injury. Injury was performed by crushing the optic nerve with a neurosurgical aneurysm clip (Aesculap Inc., Center Valley, PA, CAT No. FT820T) and reinforcing it by the addition of a titanium reinforcing clip (Aesculap Inc., Center Valley, PA, CAT No. FT900T), inducing \u223c12\u2009N of crush force at the application site (measured using FlexiForce ELF System [Tekscan; South Boston, MA]). Blood was centrifuged at 2013gfor 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C, and plasma volumes were aliquoted into 1.5\u2009mL tubes and stored at -80\u00b0C. Plasma samples were shipped overnight to Quanterix (Billerica, MA) on dry ice. The Simoa Human Neurology 4-plex A (N4PA) assay was performed by Quanterix personnel under blinded conditions. Samples were run in duplicate at a dilution factor of four. Appropriate plate controls to establish limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) were used.\n\nTo confirm the validity and reproducibility of the crush lesions and that loss of visual function and loss of normal physiological measures had occurred, optic nerve crush was clearly visualized in each animal by the surgeon. Weekly serial fVEPs of the right and left eyes were obtained with the animals under general anesthesia. Axonal transport within the optic nerves using CT-\u03b2 was also assessed. Two days before study end-point, 200\u2009\u03bcg of CT-\u03b2 in 150\u2009\u03bcL of sterile saline was injected into the vitreous cavity of the left (uncrushed), and right (crushed) eyes of each pig. Eyes were fixed by transcardial perfusion fixation with 10% neutral buffered formalin with the animals under general anesthesia. The eyes and optic nerves were harvested, and then the optic nerves and peripapillary retina were prepped for frozen sectioning.\n\nAntibodies in the N4PA assay are known to cross-react with three of the four biomarkers from porcine samples. However, the monoclonal antibody used in the assay to measure the t-tau biomarker in human plasma does not cross-react with porcine t-tau (see Quanterix application note \u201cPorcine Cross Reactivity in Human Simoa Assays\u201d). Therefore, the t-tau biomarker data were not included in the statistical analysis. Samples with biomarker concentrations below the LOQ were assumed to have a concentration equal to the biomarker-specific LOQ (n=\u20094).\n\nStatistical analysis\nDifferences between pre- and post-injury concentrations were examined using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC), and statistical significance was evaluated using an \u03b1 of 0.05."

    "Methods": "Rats\nTen time-pregnant female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (Envigo RMS, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were obtained on embryonic day 14. The rats were maintained in specific pathogen-free temperature-controlled rooms with a 12-h light/dark cycle and\nad libitum\nfood and water. Day of birth was considered as postnatal day zero (P0). On P1, litters were cross-fostered, culled to eight pups (four to six males), and randomly assigned to the MS180 or control (CONT) groups. Pups were weaned at P21 and received a mild controlled cortical impact or sham injury. To avoid sex and litter-dependent effects, only males were evaluated, and each experimental group consisted of pups from at least five different dams (\nn\n=\u20098 per group). All experiments and manipulations, including euthanasia, were performed between 9:00 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. All procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the National Research Committee of the Mexican Social Security System (R-2016-785-054). All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, revised 1996) and the official regulations for use and care of laboratory animals of Mexico (NOM-062-ZOO-1999). Every effort was made to reduce the number of rats used, and to minimize suffering.\n\nMaternal separation\nMS180 was performed as previously described.\n18-20\n,\n42\nBriefly, on P1, MS180 pups were separated from their dam and placed in a box filled with clean sawdust and relocated in a room separate from the colony, with controlled temperature (30\u201332\u00b0C) for 3\u2009h and then returned to the dam. This procedure was repeated every day at the same time (9:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.) until weaning at P21. The CONT group remained undisturbed except for routine cage cleaning, which was very brief. To further avoid potential confounding effects of handling and manipulation, body weight was not evaluated during the pre-weaning period.\n\nControlled cortical impact (CCI) injury\nRats weighing 47\u201365\u2009g were subjected to a CCI or sham injury on P21 as previously described.\n42\nBriefly, anesthesia was induced and maintained with inspired concentrations of 4% and 2% isoflurane, respectively, in 2:1\u2009N\n2\nO:O\n2\n. The rats were secured in a stereotaxic frame, and a midline scalp incision was made under aseptic conditions. The skin and fascia were reflected to expose the skull, and a craniectomy, encompassing bregma and lambda and the sagittal and coronal sutures, was made in the right hemisphere with a dental drill. The bone flap was removed, the impacting rod was extended, and the impact tip (6\u2009mm, flat) was centered and lowered through the craniectomy until it touched the dura mater. Then the rod was retracted, and the impact tip was advanced 2.2\u2009mm farther to produce a mild TBI (2.2\u2009mm tissue deformation at 4\u2009m/sec). Body temperature was monitored with a rectal probe and maintained at 37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C with a heating blanket. Immediately after the CCI, anesthesia was discontinued, and the incision was promptly sutured. Sham-operated rats underwent similar surgical procedures but were not subjected to the impact. Post-injury weight gain was monitored daily from P21 until euthanasia at P42. Every consideration was taken to minimize stress during the weighing procedure.\n\nAcute neurological evaluation\nHindlimb reflexive ability was assessed immediately following the cessation of anesthesia and removal from the stereotaxic apparatus by gently squeezing the rats' paw every 5\u2009sec and recording the time to elicit a withdrawal response. Return of the righting reflex was determined by the time required to turn from the supine to the prone position. These sensitive neurological indices are used to determine the level of injury severity.\n7\n,\n42\n\nAttentional set-shifting test (AST)\nThe AST task\n43\n,\n44\nwas adapted from Birrell and Brown\n43\nand implemented after TBI as described previously.\n45\u201347\nBriefly, 1 week prior to behavioral testing (i.e., day 7 post-surgery), rat food intake was mildly restricted to 12\u2009g per day, consisting of 80% of the rat's normal diet, with water freely available. Rats were first trained to dig reliably in small terracotta pots (internal rim diameter, 7\u2009cm; depth, 6\u2009cm) to obtain the food reward in clean home cages and then further trained and tested on the subsequent 2 days in the testing arena, which were custom-built rectangular Plexiglas boxes (30\u2009\u00d7\u200951\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2009cm) painted gray on the outer side of all surfaces. Each pot was scented with a single odor by adding two drops (10\u2009\u03bcL/drop) of aromatic oil (NOW Foods, Bloomingdale, IL) to the inner rim 5 days prior to use. Odors were reapplied daily (1\u20132\u2009\u03bcL) to maintain consistent intensity. A different pot was used for each combination of digging medium and odor, and only one odor was ever applied to a given pot. The \u201creward\u201d was one quarter of a Honey Nut Cheerio (General Mills Cereals, Minneapolis, MN) buried 2\u2009cm below the surface of the digging medium in the \u201cpositive\u201d pot. To avoid location by smell rather than learning and discrimination, pots were sprinkled with Cheerio dust prior to each stage.\nFor the training phase, rats were trained on a series of simple discriminations (SD) to reach a criterion of six consecutive correct trials. First, they had to learn to discriminate between aromatic odors in sawdust-filled pots (lemon vs. eucalyptus). After reaching criterion for the odor discrimination, rats learned to associate the food reward with a medium cue using new unscented pots (felt vs. paper strips). All rats were trained using the same pairs of stimuli and in the same order. On the following day, rats were then tested on a series of increasingly difficult discrimination stages, each also requiring a criterion of six consecutive correct trials, based on the cue progression previously established.\n45\n,\n46\nThe first stage was an SD involving only one stimulus dimension, with half of the rats starting with odor and half starting with medium (for clarity, subsequent description will consider only the example beginning with an odor discrimination; the stimulus shift performance is also analyzed to ensure there is no perceptual dimension bias affecting AST results on test day). The second stage was a compound discrimination (CD), in which the same contingency rule was required (e.g., odor), and the second, irrelevant stimulus dimension (e.g., medium) was introduced. As in the SD task, only one odor was associated with reward, but two different digging media were paired randomly with the odors. The third stage was a reversal (R1) of the previous discrimination, in which the same odors and media were used. Odor was maintained as the relevant dimension; however, the negative odor from the previous stage became positive and the positive odor from the previous stage became negative (no reward). The fourth stage was an intradimensional (ID) shift in which all new stimuli (odors and media) were introduced. Again, odor remained the relevant dimension and digging medium was still irrelevant. The fifth stage was a reversal of this discrimination (R2), in which the previously negative odor became positive, similar to R1. The sixth task required an extradimensional (ED) cognitive set-shift, in which all new stimuli were again introduced, but the dimension that had been repeatedly reinforced as the informative, relevant dimension (thus forming a \u201ccognitive set\u201d) was now irrelevant, and the previously distracting dimension (i.e., the digging medium) became the relevant dimension. Finally, the seventh stage was another reversal (R3), where the previously negative stimulus became positive, as in the previous reversals. The rats were allowed 10\u2009min to make a choice on each trial. If a choice was not made within this interval, the trial was scored as an error and the rat was returned to the start box. Rats failing to make a choice on 6 consecutive trials, or failing to complete a stage within 50 trials, were eliminated from further testing. The dependent measures were the number of trials required to reach criterion for each stage of the test, the total number of errors per stage, as well as set-loss errors, which occurred when 50% of the rule contingency had been achieved (i.e., three, four, or five correct responses followed by an incorrect choice).\n42\n\nTissue preparation, corticosterone assay, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)\nOn P42, the rats were transported from the main housing room to the local vivarium at 9:00 a.m. and were left undisturbed for 90\u2009min to avoid the confounding effects of transport stress. After the 90\u2009min, the rats were transported to the necropsy room one at a time, given an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal, 80\u2013100\u2009mg/kg; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), and then were decapitated and trunk blood was collected in tubes containing aprotinin and EDTA (pH 8, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) to analyze plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels. The PFC, hippocampus (ipsilateral and contralateral), and hypothalamus were dissected on a chilled ice plate to analyze the expression of cytokines and HPA axis related neuropeptides as previously described.\n43\nBrain tissues were placed in Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA), and stored at -70\u00b0C until RNA extraction was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Plasma was stored at -70\u00b0C until processing for CORT analysis by ELISA (ENZO life sciences, Cat. No: ADI-900-097) and processed according to the manufacturers protocol for small volumes of plasma samples to assure that all samples fell within the essay detection range (0.032\u201320\u2009ng/mL). Briefly, 10\u2009\u03bcL of each sample were pre-treated with a 10\u2009\u03bcL of 1:100 steroid displacement reagent (SDR) solution (immediately before use) for 5\u2009min and further diluted in 380\u2009\u03bcL of assay buffer to a final dilution of 1:40.\n\nReal time (RT)-qPCR\nWe used RT-qPCR to determine cytokine expression (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) in the hippocampus and the PFC, as well as the expression of HPA axis activity-related genes corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in hypothalamic tissue as previously described\n27\n,\n48\n(see Table S1 for primer sequence and insertion number). Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt) was used as the reference housekeeping gene. Total RNA from hippocampal and hypothalamic tissues was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA) following manufacturer instructions. A total of 1\u2009\u03bcg of RNA per sample was subjected to reverse transcription in a 20-\u03bcL reaction solution containing 1\u2009\u03bcL of Oligo dT (Promega, 500\u2009\u03bcg/mL), dNTP mix (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 10mM each; Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA), first strand buffer, and 200\u2009U of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, 200U/1\u03bcL), at 37\u00b0C for 50\u2009min. We used 250\u2009ng of cDNA for RT-qPCR analyses with each reaction containing Master Mix 2X (iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix, BioRad) and forward and reverse primers (10\u2009\u03bcM/\u03bcL each, Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA). RT-qPCR was performed for 40 cycles using the CFX 96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Each sample was run in duplicate. Data were normalized and analyzed using the \u0394\u0394C\nT\nmethod adapted from Bustin.\n49\nAll experiments were performed in accordance with the MIQE Guidelines: Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments.\n50\nIntra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were <10% for all comparisons.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed on data generated by experimenters blinded to conditions using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad software, US). Post mTBI body weight gain and cognitive test day outcomes were analyzed by three-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with ELS, injury, and stage as factors, of which stage was the repeated measure. AST training and ED shift type performance were analyzed by two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with stage as the repeated measure. The acute neurological assessment, CRH, AVP, and CORT levels were analyzed by two-way ANOVAs with ELS and injury as factors. When the ANOVA revealed a significant effect, Tukey's post-hoc tests were utilized to determine specific group differences. Cytokine expression was analyzed with a three-way ANOVA considering ELS, TBI, and injury side as factors. No differences were observed between ipsilateral and contralateral cytokine expression in sham rats, and therefore, the data were pooled and further analyzed with a one-way ANOVA. The results are expressed as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM), and were considered significant when\np \u2264\n0.05.\nFor correlation analysis, entire data sets for each variable (i.e., all rats) were tested with the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test for normal distribution and a Pearson's correlation analysis was estimated using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad software, US). A heat map was obtained for Pearson's correlation coefficients and\np\nvalues. Stepwise multivariate linear regression models were performed to confirm correlations and predict performance in the AST based on individual biomarkers (ipsilateral and contralateral cytokine expression and HPA axis activity) and injury severity with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software."

    "Methods": "Our recentin vivocervical spinal cord contusion experiments on NHPs1have provided a unique opportunity to re-evaluate FE predicted tissue damage measures while exploring subject-specific variations in contusion biomechanics. Pre- and post-injury magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and post-injury histology data from previous studies1,38were used to develop FE models of each NHP test subject. These subject-specific models were then used to simulate our previousin vivocervical unilateral contusion SCI experiments.1The FE models were calibrated and validated against thein vivoexperiments based on their biomechanical outcomes. Finally, chronic lesion histology results from thein vivoexperiments were used to statistically evaluate the correlation between FE predicted tissue level mechanics and tissue damage for individual subjects.\n\nIn addition to the subject-specific models, a generic FE model was developed by averaging the cord and column morphology of four of the subjects. The generic model simulated the same impacts as the subject-specific models to assess the differences in biomechanical outcomes and injury correlations between subject-specific and generic models. Mechanical outcomes investigated in this study were: maximum/minimum principal logarithmic strain (max/min LEP), axonal logarithmic strain (LEAXON), von-Mises stress (MISES), Tresca stress (TRESCA), and strain energy density (ESEDEN).\n\nNHP unilateral contusions\nPreviously, we conducted a series of\nin vivo\nunilateral cervical contusion tests on six NHPs (adult male\nMacaca mulatta\n).\n38\n,\n39\nBriefly, experiments were performed in two groups\u2014an open dura contusion group (\nn\n=\u20092) where the dura mater was perforated surgically after the laminectomy and contusion impact was applied directly to the spinal cord (open dura),\n38\nand an intact dura group (\nn\n=\u20094) where the dura mater was left intact and contusion impacts were applied to the intact dura\n1\n(\nTable 1\n).\nTable 1.\nSummary of Experimental Parameters and Biomechanical Outcomes for the Six Selected Non-Human Primates\nOpen in a separate window\nMRI, magnetic resonance imaging; FE, finite element.\nThe subject numbers are consistent with our previous studies.\n1\n,\n39\nFor all experiments, impacts were applied using a 4\u2009mm diameter Lucite tip rod with different mediolateral impactor alignments for each test. All housing and procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California at Davis.\nOpen dura contusion experiments\nSubjects #14 and #16 were imaged using a 3T MRI scanner approximately one week before the injury to confirm the spinal cord and CSF morphology. The surgical approach included a partial laminectomy at the fifth cervical vertebrae (C5), excising the dorsal dura mater, and visualization of the spinal cord midline. The C4 and C6 spinous processes were fixed using vertebral clamps before the impact. Before the contusion impact, the impactor tip was positioned based on a pre-set mediolateral alignment with respect to the spinal cord midline (\nTable 1\n). A pre-load of 0.3\u2009N was used to establish a consistent starting position for impact. Blunt contusion impacts were delivered to the cord to pre-set peak displacements (\nTable 1\n). The resulting impact biomechanics (impactor displacement and force) were recorded for each subject. The contusion lesions were observed at three weeks post-injury using high-resolution 3T MRI T2-weighted isotropic scans oriented in the sagittal plane with a slice thickness of 270\u2009\u03bcm.\nIntact dura contusion experiment\nSubjects #8 and 9 were scanned approximately one week before the injury with 1.5T and 3T MRI scanners, respectively (subjects #5 and 6 were not scanned pre-injury). Surgical details and biomechanical parameters were as reported previously.\n1\nUnilateral contusion impacts were applied after a partial laminectomy at C5. The C4 and C6 spinous processes were fixed using vertebral clamps before the impact. Before the contusion impact, the impactor tip was positioned to a pre-set mediolateral alignment with respect to the spinal cord midline (\nTable 1\n). The impactor was lowered onto the dorsal dural surface to a preload of 0.5\u2009N.\nThe pre-load entrapped the spinal cord against the vertebral canal, reduced the lateral motion of the spinal cord, and established a consistent starting position for impact. Peak displacements varied slightly for each test subject (-4.0\u2009mm for subject #5 and -4.3\u2009mm for subjects #6, #8, and #9) with pre-set impact velocities (\nTable 1\n).\nSubjects were sacrificed 14\u201317 weeks after injury. Spinal cords were harvested, sectioned in the transverse plane at 40\u2009\u03bcm thickness, and co-stained with eriochrome cyanine for myelin and neural red for cell bodies.\n1\nFor each subject, brightfield images were made from selected histology slices (epicenter, \u00b11.6\u2009mm and \u00b13.2\u2009mm rostral to the epicenter) and lesion borders were outlined.\n1\nFE model generation\nIsotropic sagittal MRI scans of each NHP subject were interpolated in Mimics (Mimics Research v19.0, Materialize N.V., Belgium) resulting in images of pixel size 0.3125\u2009mm (intact dura subjects #5, #6, #8, and #9) and 0.2734\u2009mm (open dura subjects #14 and #16). The three-dimensional (3D) images included the full cervical spine for all subjects (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRepresentative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, three-dimensional (3D) segmented mask and FE models. For the subject shown here, the sagittal T2-weighted 3T MRI scans yielded 512\u2009\u00d7\u20091024 pixel scans with a slice thickness of 270\u2009\u03bcm and field of view of 140\u2009mm. Axial view with gray and white matter masks (\nA\n), sagittal view showing target spinal cord segment (in between the red lines) and the impact position (red arrow) (\nB\n), isometric view of generated 3D mask showing C2 to C7 vertebrae, white and gray matters cut for illustration (\nC\n), a representation of FE model segment and laminectomy site (\nD\n), an isometric view of an open dura model (\nE\n), an isometric view of an intact dura FE model (\nF\n), representative of dorsoventral and transverse diameters of spinal cord and column measured for average generic model generation (\nG\n), and an isometric view of the generic model (\nH\n). CSF, cerebrospinal fluid.\nBased on the post-injury MRI scans, the longitudinal location of the lesion (impact epicenter) was identified for each subject. A three-vertebrae segment was isolated using the identified epicenter as the middle vertebrae to fully include the injury site while minimizing the size of the model and the resulting computational cost.\n20\nFor open dura subjects #14 and #16, the white and gray matters and vertebral column were segmented using customized image thresholding. For intact dura subjects, the spinal cord, dura, and the vertebral column geometries were obtained via segmentation in Mimics.\nSubjects #5, #6 and #8 were imaged with a 1.5T scanner; therefore, the gray matter was not clearly distinguishable and was manually added by extracting the gray matter profile from a rostral histological slide (> 4.8\u2009mm from the epicenter). The same method was used to generate the gray matter in subject #9 for methodological consistency, even though the 3T MRI allowed for segmenting the gray matter in this subject. The spinal column, white and gray matter 3D objects were then exported to Materialise 3-Matic Research (Materialize N.V., Belgium) and meshed with tetrahedral elements (prescribed edge of 0.4\u2009mm) after being manually partitioned. For intact dura models (#5, #6, #8, and #9), the CSF geometry was obtained by performing a Boolean operation between the spinal cord and the dural sac 3D objects in 3-Matic.\nFinally, the completed orphan meshes were imported into ABAQUS (V6.14, Simulia Inc, Johnston, RI) to simulate the unilateral contusion impact. Denticulate ligaments and nerve roots were not included in the models because these components have been found to have marginal effect on the bulk cord displacement.\n40\nFor both open and intact dura experiments, the impactor was modeled as a 4\u2009mm analytically rigid cylinder because the bulk modulus of the impactor was several orders of magnitude higher than the soft tissues of the spinal cord. Similarly, the spinal column was considered analytically rigid, because the stiffness of the vertebrae was substantially greater than spinal cord constituent materials. Three-dimensional rigid elements with quadrilateral (R3D4) and tetrahedral (R3D3) shapes were used to mesh the impactor and the spinal column, respectively. The imported orphan meshes of white and gray matters were assigned continuum C3D4 elements (continuum 3D tetrahedral) with second order accuracy. The pia mater was modeled as a skin surrounding the white matter with a thickness of 0.13\u2009mm.\n41\nThe dura mater was modeled as a shell with a thickness of 0.35\u2009mm.\n42\nFor open dura impacts, the dura mater was excluded from the model. For both pia and dura maters, three-node triangular shell elements (S3R elements) with second order accuracy were used. For the intact dura models, the CSF orphan mesh was imported as a solid and was converted to mass particles for further analysis using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH).\n43\n,\n44\nThe posterior section of the epicenter vertebra (lamina and spinous process) was removed to mimic the\nin vivo\nsurgical laminectomy.\n1\nFinalized models comprised approximately 24,000, 98,000, 5,000, and 7,500 elements for gray matter, white matter, pia mater, and dura mater, respectively; the CSF contained \u223c13,500 particles in the models (\nFig. 1\n). To improve the computational efficiency, element distortion control, second-order accuracy, and enhanced hourglass control were applied to all the elements accordingly. The simulations were run on supercomputing clusters (Intel E5-2683 v4 CPUs, running at 2.1 GHz processors) using ABAQUS/Explicit. The open dura tests were used to validate model assumptions (contact interactions, boundary conditions, and material constitutive models), and were not further analyzed for tissue damage correlations.\n\nMaterial constitutive models and properties\nWhite matter\nThe rostral-caudal alignment of axonal fibers in the spinal cord white matter provides a direction-specific mechanical response.\n27\n,\n45\nFor these simulations, a conditional quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) transversely isotropic model\n16\nwas refined by including our recent NHP white matter compressive characterization results\n28\naugmented with bovine tensile tests\n23\nand derived using inverse FE optimization methods.\n28\nThe resulting conditional QLV model is a time dependent strain energy function,\nU\nWM\n(\nt\n), in the form of a Prony series expansion with\nN\nnumber of terms (\nEquation 1\n):\nU\nW\nM\nt\n=\n\u222b\n0\nt\n1\n\u2212\n\u2211\ni\n=\n1\nN\ng\ni\n1\n\u2212\ne\n\u2212\nt\n\u2212\n\u03c4\n\u2215\n\u03c4\ni\nd\n\u03c8\ne\nd\n\u03c4\nd\n\u03c4\n(1)\nwhere\n\u03c8\nW\nM\nrepresents a conditional hyperelastic strain energy (\nEquation 2\n):\n\u03c8\nW\nM\n=\n\u03c8\nm\na\nt\nr\ni\nx\n\u03bb\nf\ni\nb\ne\nr\ns\n\u2264\n1\n\u03c8\nm\na\nt\nr\ni\nx\n+\n\u03c8\nf\ni\nb\ne\nr\ns\n\u03bb\nf\ni\nb\ne\nr\ns\n>\n1\n(2)\nwhere\n\u03c8\nm\na\nt\nr\ni\nx\nrepresents the isotropic elastic strain energy of the glial matrix,\n\u03c8\nf\ni\nb\ne\nr\ns\nis the contribution of the fibers in the elastic strain energy, and\n\u03bb\nf\ni\nb\ne\nr\ns\nis the stretch in the fiber direction.

For the dura mater, isotropic behavior was assumed and used a first order Ogden model with four-term Prony series\n30\n(\nTable 2\n).\nCSF\nThe mesh-free SPH method has been shown to be effective in simulating the large deformation fluid-structure interactions and complex subject-specific geometries\n51\nfor brain\n52\nand spinal cord\n20\ninjuries. The CSF behavior was modeled as SPH particles by assuming a linear Hugoniot form of the Mie-Gruneisen equation of state\n46\n(\nEquation 6\n).\np\n=\n\u03c1\n0\nc\n0\n2\n\u03b7\n1\n\u2212\ns\n\u03b7\n2\n1\n\u2212\n\u0393\n0\n\u03b7\n2\n+\n\u0393\n0\n\u03c1\n0\nE\nm\n(6)\nwhere\np\nis pressure,\nE\nm\nis the internal energy of the fluid per unit reference volume,\nc\n0\nand\ns\nare material linear Hugoniot constants,\n\u03b7\n=\n1\n\u2212\n\u03c1\n0\n\u03c1\nis the nominal volumetric compressive strain with\n\u03c1\n0\nand\n\u03c1\nas the reference and the current densities of the CSF, respectively, and\n\u0393\n0\nis also a material constant.\nThe above equation of state, with assigned material properties of water, has been used previously to model brain CSF in FE simulations of blast brain injury.\n53\n,\n54\nIn the current study, the CSF density\n55\nand bulk modulus (2.19 GPa)\n56\nwere used to determine\nc\n0\nwhile the properties of water were assigned\n53\nto\ns\nand\n\u0393\n0\n(\nTable 2\n). Modeling CSF as SPH particles substantially decreased the stable time increments (\u223c1E-8 Sec) in the analysis and eliminated the possibility of parallel domain processing because of convergence difficulties. As a result, the required CPU hours for running intact dura simulations on the supercomputer cluster nodes were substantially higher than that of open dura simulations where no CSF was included in the models (about 55 CPU hours for open dura simulations versus more than 220 CPU hours for intact dura impacts).\n\nLoading and boundary conditions\nTo accurately mimic the\nin vivo\nexperimental conditions for both the intact and open dura impacts, the simulations were performed in two stages of pre-loading and impact. At the first stage (pre-loading), a sensor was defined on the FE impactor using the UAMP subroutine in ABAQUS to monitor the reaction force of the impactor. The impactor was lowered to touch the pia (open dura) or dura (intact dura) and then continued to trap the spinal cord against the floor of the vertebral canal. This pre-load step continued until the force readout from the sensor corresponded to the\nin vivo\npre-load (\nTable 1\n). The CSF was not included in the models in the pre-load step because the fluid provides negligible resistance at very slow loading rates.\nAfter the pre-load step, the impactor was held for 0.2\u2009sec to let the viscoelastic materials relax, similar to the experimental protocol. During the pre-load step, symmetrical boundary conditions were applied to the rostral and caudal ends of the spinal cord to restrict the axial movement while allowing unrestricted dorsal/ventral and medial/lateral motion (both open and intact dura simulations). In the intact dura simulations, the rostral and caudal ends of the dura mater were fixed for the pre-loading step to prevent free rotation.\nIn the second stage, the actual\nin vivo\ndisplacement trajectory of the impactor was prescribed to the FE model impactor.\n1\nThe deformed geometries were imported from the pre-load stages. For the intact dura models, CSF particles were added to the model. The models best simulated the\nin vivo\nbehavior when the symmetrical boundary conditions of the pre-load stage were substituted with fixed boundary conditions in the impact stage.\nThe two ends of the dura matter were prescribed axially symmetrical boundary conditions for the impact step. To confine CSF particles from escaping the dural sac during the impact, an axisymmetrical boundary condition was imposed on the first four superior/inferior rows of CSF particles at either open end of the FE model (\nFig. 1\n). Applying this condition to less than four rows of particles did not hold the CSF particles in the dural tube during the impact. The vertebral column was secured by fixing vertebral clamps to the C4 and C6 spinous processes in the\nin vivo\nexperiments\n1\n,\n57\n; therefore, fixed boundary conditions were applied to the spinal canal in the FE models. The impactor was restricted to move only in the direction of impact.\nCoefficients of friction were applied at the interacting surfaces. Similar to rodent contusion SCI simulations,\n15\n,\n20\nthe coefficient of contact friction between the outer section of dura and spinal canal was assumed to be 0.15. The friction between the impactor and the dura mater (intact dura simulations) or pia mater (open dura simulations) was assumed to be slip rate dependent with the coefficient of friction equal to 0.09 and 0.18 at strain rates of 1/sec and 60/sec, respectively.\n58\nA very low friction coefficient was assumed for the contact between the pia-dura (0.01) to simulate CSF lubrication effect. Although the CSF was removed by excising the dura in the open dura tests, there was likely some remaining fluid on the anterior side of the cord, and therefore a low contact friction coefficient (0.01) was assumed for pia-column interaction in the open dura simulations.\n\nFE model calibration and validation\nThe subject-specific FE models were validated by comparing their impactor reaction force with the corresponding\nin vivo\nreaction force (force trajectory and peak value).\n1\n,\n39\nIt is known\na priori\nthat the constituent spinal cord material properties (white and gray matters and pia mater), boundary conditions, and the impactor mediolateral alignment substantially affect the impact force outcome.\n15\n,\n16\n,\n39\nOpen dura impacts were used to study and validate model assumptions without the additional complexity of the CSF. The resolved model assumptions were then applied without further alteration to the intact dura simulations.\nOpen dura subject #16 was used as the pilot model to systematically examine and verify modeling parameters (friction characteristics, boundary conditions, model length and mesh). A C4-C6 length model with fixed boundary conditions at the rostral and caudal free ends of spinal cord was created. Friction between the impactor and pia mater was assumed as slip rate dependent in the pilot simulation, and a constant friction coefficient of 0.01 was prescribed to pia/column contact. Model length, boundary conditions, and friction characteristics were then altered in separate models to observe their effects on the model outcome biomechanics.\nFour new models were generated using the pilot model parameters: (a) a longer section of spinal cord (C3 to C7 instead of C4-C6) to examine the effects of model's length, (b) symmetrical free end boundary conditions instead of fixed, (c) frictionless contacts instead of slip rate dependent, and (d) a 25% finer mesh to evaluate mesh size effects (seed size was changed from 0.4\u2009mm to 0.3\u2009mm).\nIn these simulations, the mediolateral alignment was tuned in increments of 0.1\u2009mm until minimum root mean square error (RMSE) between the FE predicted and experimental impactor force was obtained. Verified model parameters, boundary conditions, and friction coefficients were applied to the other open dura subject (subject #14) to validate their performance. The modeling characteristics were then used for all simulations of intact dura impacts (subjects #5, #6, #8, and #9).\nIdentifying the exact mediolateral positioning of the impactor during surgeries was difficult because the spinal cord was only partially visible through the laminectomy. The problem persisted for open dura experiments, with precise identification of the midline being difficult because of the limited surgical exposure. Therefore, the reported\nin vivo\nexperimental alignments (\nTable 1\n) may not be accurate precisely to the submillimeter level.\nAlthough midline contusion SCI models have reported a marginal effect of off-centered impact on their models,\n15\n,\n20\nunilateral experiments showed that submillimeter mediolateral positioning of the impactor substantially affects\nin vivo\nimpact mechanics.\n1\n,\n39\nThis is mainly due to the spinal cord's lateral shift during unilateral impacts. Therefore, preliminary studies were conducted on open dura models of this study to evaluate the reliability of mediolateral impactor positioning. These preliminary studies showed that tuning the impactor mediolateral position closely simulated the experimental impactor force output. Based on these results, because the actual reported alignments could not be confirmed, it was assumed that the tuned impactor alignment was the actual alignment.\n\nTissue damage correlation analysis\nTransverse slices of one element thick (0.4\u2009mm thick) corresponding to the histology slide positions (epicenter, 1.6 and 3.2\u2009mm rostral and caudal) were outlined in the FE models (\nFig. 2\n). The injury epicenter was identified as the slice centered under the impactor in the FE model and was used as a reference to locate rostral/caudal FE slices and were color-coded based on the lesion area and the spared gray and white matter regions (\nFig. 2A\n).\n1\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\n(\nA\n) Color-coded histology slides of the four intact dura subjects (gray matter, brown; white matter, gray; lesion area, red). Sections show the lesion epicenter, 3.2\u2009mm and 1.6\u2009mm rostral and caudal to the epicenter. (\nB\n) Isometric view of an intact dura finite element (FE) model; one element thick slices corresponding to the selected histology slides are shown. Gray and white matters, dura and pia maters, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and spinal column are visible in the figure. (\nC\n) Overlaying post-impact zero load FE slice onto histology slide. Arbitrary points were selected on the outline of gray and white matters in the two figures (middle) and fed to an image processing custom code to overlay the figures. Four representative points are shown in the middle figure. Injured elements are identified by dark color for both gray and white matters in the slice (right bottom).\nAfter the impact simulation, the post-impact zero load mesh configuration of the selected slices at each level was superimposed onto the corresponding color-coded histology slide using an image processing toolbox and a custom code (MATLAB R2018a, The MathWorks Inc Natick, MA). Ventral artery and dorsal median sulcus served as the main reference landmarks. In the composite images, gray and white matter elements overlaying the injured (lesion/red) and uninjured (spared tissue colored gray for white matter and brown for gray matter) areas were identified accordingly (\nFig. 2\n). Elements that overlaid onto both injured and uninjured tissue areas were identified as injured.\n59\nFollowing previous studies of brain and spinal cord,\n15\n,\n18\n,\n20\n,\n23\n,\n59\nseveral tissue level mechanical metrics were analyzed statistically to assess their correlation with tissue damage and to determine their corresponding threshold values. Because this was the first exploration of NHP contusion injury mechanics, a comprehensive assessment of several mechanical outcomes measures was performed including: min/max LEP, LEAXON, MISES, TRESCA, and ESEDEN.\nFor each subject, these outputs were recorded for all the elements in white and gray matters for the five selected slices during the entire impact simulation. For each element, the corresponding peak value experienced through the entire impact was listed together with the element injury status (\u201c1\u201d if detected as injured and \u201c0\u201d if uninjured). In addition to the mechanical metrics stated above, maximum/minimum principal stress and maximum/minimum pressure were investigated in our preliminary studies; however, because of their poor correlation with tissue damage, they were not included in further analysis.\nAxons in the white matter were assumed to be predominantly aligned in the rostral-caudal direction before the impact. Therefore, a local coordinate system was assigned to each element of the white matter defining the axonal direction. ABAQUS traces the distortions of each element's coordinate system spatially during the impact and reports the axon direction accordingly in time intervals. Because of randomized direction distribution of axons in spinal cord gray matter, the initial alignment of the axons was not identifiable; therefore, LEAXON was not analyzed for gray matter.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor each intact dura experiment, variables were analyzed using Logit analysis in JMP (v13.2.1, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) to assess their potential capability in predicting spinal cord tissue damage. In each subject, multiple random element sets (\u223c30) were selected from white and gray matters separately with an identical number of injured and uninjured elements. For each random set, a logistic model (\nEquation 7\n) was fit to the data of the elements' binary injury status (injured/uninjured) versus their corresponding mechanical metric peak output value experienced through the entire simulation.\n\u03a0\nX\n=\n1\n1\n+\ne\n\u2212\n\u03b1\n+\n\u2211\n\u03b2\ni\nX\n(7)\nwhere\n\u03a0\nis the probability of the tissue being damaged,\nX\nrepresents a vector of the independent metrics (max/min LEP, LEAXON, MISES, TRESCA, and ESEDEN),\n\u03b1\nis the model intercept and\n\u03b2\ni\n's are the model parameters associated with\n\u03b1\nand the independent metrics.\nJMP uses the maximum likelihood estimation method (log-likelihood) to determine the best fit parameters for regression. A specific likelihood ratio chi-square test was performed where the observed\np\nvalue of the test was judged for model goodness-of-fit assessment (significance was assumed at\np\n<\u20090.05). To determine which candidate output metric provided the best correlation with the occurrence of spinal cord tissue damage, the Nagelkerke R-squared statistic\n60\nwas calculated for each fit\n15\n,\n61\n(limits were 0 for poor and 1 for perfect correlation). Moreover, the performance of the binary classifier model at varied thresholds was evaluated by plotting receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for different output metrics and comparing the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The output metric with AUC closest to 1 was considered the best predictor of tissue damage.\n62\nIn addition, breakdown values (thresholds) for 50% probability of injury were determined for each output metric by inverse prediction method using confidence interval of 0.9. Mean and standard deviation of the Nagelkerke R-squares and the AUCs obtained for the random element sets were determined for the metrics in white and gray matters and was compared for each subject.\nFinally, for each mechanical outcome metric, injury threshold values were compared statistically among the four subjects to determine between-subject variations. Threshold values of the element sets within a subject were grouped, and the group means were compared for individual mechanical metrics using one-way analysis of variance with significance level set at \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05. Mechanical metrics with significant differences between subject thresholds should be considered as subject-specific tissue damage thresholds.\n\nGeneric NHP FE model\nTo evaluate the significance of generating subject-specific FE models, a generic averaged model of the four intact dura NHP subjects was generated and the model outcomes and correlations with tissue damage were compared. The generic model morphology was based on the averaged dimensions of the four subjects. The FE output and tissue damage correlations were compared with the subject-specific outcomes.\nPre-injury MRIs were used to measure the dorsoventral and transverse diameters of spinal cord and column corresponding to the injury epicenter (\nFig. 1G\n). Resulting averages were used to generate elliptical cross-sections to represent the spinal cord. The average values for spinal cord dorsoventral and transverse diameters were 5.3\u2009mm and 8.6\u2009mm, respectively, and 8.2\u2009mm and 10.9\u2009mm for the column, respectively. The cross-sections were then extruded for 30\u2009mm (representing the three-vertebrae cranial-caudal length of subject-specific models) with a shell cylinder for the spinal column and a solid cylinder representing the spinal cord (\nFig. 1H\n).\nA gray matter profile was created by averaging the gray matter profiles of the four intact dura subjects. Dura matter was generated by scaling down the column cylinder by 1.5% to avoid element overlap. The CSF geometry was obtained via Boolean operation using the same methods as the subject-specific methods. Impactor dimensions, CSF properties, and mesh attributes were the same as the subject-specific models."

    "Methods": "The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to define the scope of this study by identifying five domains to consider in implementation projects: intervention characteristics, outer setting, inner setting, characteristics of individuals, and process.16The goal of this study was to better understand the latter four characteristics in order to create an optimal intervention. \u201cOuter setting\u201d refers to the structural characteristics in which an intervention takes place; \u201cinner setting\u201d refers to the cultural values of that setting; characteristics of the individuals describes the patients, caregivers, and providers; and process describes the characteristics of the implementation process itself. The CFIR is an appropriate tool to better define barriers and facilitators to implementing a psychosocial intervention.\n\nPatients with severe TBI at the study sites begin the PEGASUS pathway and are treated in four sequential care settings from which the study sample was drawn: the ED, pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), acute care hospitalization at a level 1 pediatric trauma center, and inpatient rehabilitation at a nearby affiliated children's hospital. An institutional review board (IRB) waiver was granted for this study.\n\nThis study utilized semistructured, in-person interviews to explore the experience of providers who interact with caregivers of children with severe TBI. Qualitative methods were utilized because of this study's goals of understanding in-depth provider perspectives for optimal design of psychosocial interventions for their patients with TBI. Interviews are ideal for achieving these goals, as they allow for more nuanced exploration of provider insight that might guide both interventions and future studies. Semistructured interviews ensured that all relevant concerns were systematically addressed, while allowing providers to offer novel solutions. By asking scripted, open-ended questions that allowed for follow-up questions, investigators could optimize the information learned from each interview. CFIR was used as a framework to ensure that barriers and facilitators to interventions could be comprehensively addressed.\n\nThe semistructured interview guide was written in an iterative format. First, a literature review informed the domains to be explored by clarifying family and caregiver insight into desired interventions, prior interventions to improve care of severe pediatric TBI, and psychosocial concerns specific to severe pediatric TBI. Next, the survey authors consulted with content experts both on the authorship team and otherwise affiliated with the care of pediatric patients with severe TBI to ensure that questions were clear and relevant, and that they invited creative responses. Interview domains included: caregiver communication topics, team and caregiver communication process, prognostication, and assessment and intervention with vulnerable families. Ideas and current practices for psychosocial interventions were explored. Example questions included: \u201cWhen and how are psychosocial needs discussed in your setting? Can you describe a recent case?\u201d; \u201cHow do you respond to questions about prognosis before definitive information is known?\u201d; \u201cWhat do you wish families knew sooner?\u201d These questions invited active, relevant participation and often lead to follow-up questions regarding specific interventions.\n\nHealthcare providers were selected using a purposive sampling method based on known involvement in the care of pediatric patients with severe TBI.17Participants were selected to represent a variety of practice settings (e.g. rehabilitation, PICU, ED) and years of experience, as it was important to understand challenges and insights from the perspective of both new and experienced providers. Investigators estimated a sample size of 20\u201325 providers based on previous studies with a similar population. Approximately 30 providers were contacted for an interview via e-mail. Although no providers refused an interview, scheduling was a barrier for some participants. Interviews were conducted to a point of saturation; that is, new subjects were interviewed until it was determined that interview content had become repetitive.\n\nInterviews were primarily conducted face to face, with three conducted via video conference. Twenty-one interviews were iteratively coded. Two interviews were not formally coded. One interview, with a senior, clinically experienced pediatric physiatrist, was used to revise the interview guide as described. A second interview was not recorded because of an equipment malfunction, although notes were carefully recorded. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed iteratively using directed content analysis in Dedoose, a software program that allows for close analysis of interviews by tagging words or sentences with user-generated themes. Each interview was manually reviewed and major themes were identified, with special attention paid to implementation-impacting factors. The first author conducted a primary line-by-line analysis of interviews and the corresponding author coded a subset of interviews, identifying preliminary themes and patterns. After major themes were identified, interviews were revisited and more cohesively coded with Dedoose, allowing for specific quotes and proposed interventions to be identified. This iterative process allowed for continuous refining and analysis of interview content. The research team then reviewed the primary analysis and identified themes and potential interventions (provider-oriented and caregiver-oriented). Potential interventions were identified both explicitly based on direct recommendations from interview subjects and by the research team based on gaps in care identified over the course of interviews.\n\nReflexivity statement\nIn this study, researcher bias was carefully considered. The research team included a medical student with a background in social work, the principal investigator of the original PEGASUS pathway, a pediatric physiatrist who works extensively with the studied patient population, the nurse program manager of the PICU, and a social work researcher focused on psychosocial intervention implementation. Each researcher brought expertise, such as familiarity with the patient population and PEGASUS pathway, and also biases, such as extant opinions about next steps for psychosocial intervention and a strong investment in family-centered approaches to care. All researchers valued family-centered approaches and favored implementing psychosocial intervention at each stage of the pathway; these priorities were carefully considered with respect to collected data. The researchers considered their own biases when interpreting interviews and conducted member checking to maintain trustworthiness of data analysis."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nMale high school and collegiate American football players were recruited within a three-year regional prospective study of SRC in athletes. The criteria for exclusion from the study included contraindications or injuries that would prevent participation in the study protocol, current psychotic disorders or reported narcotic use, and/or a history or suspicion of conditions associated with cognitive impairments (e.g., epilepsy, moderate-to-severe TBI). Adult participants and parents of minors provided written informed consent, while minors completed written assent. The study was approved by the Medical College of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board.\nCertified athletic trainers and/or team physicians trained in sports medicine performed the initial diagnosis of concussion injuries. The definition of concussion was derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HEADS UP educational initiative: \u201cAn injury resulting from a forceful bump, blow, or jolt to the head that results in rapid movement of the head and causes a change in the athlete's behavior, thinking, physical functioning, or the following symptoms: headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness/balance problems, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, sensitivity to light/noise, blurred vision, memory difficulty, and difficulty concentrating.\u201d\nInjured subjects enrolled within the study were imaged with an advanced MRI protocol within 48\u2009h after injury. The SCAT-3 symptom checklist, the Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC), and the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) were also collected at baseline (on initial subject enrollment in study) and at the MRI visit.\nMale control subjects were matched on level (high school vs. college), school, team, age, estimated pre-morbid intelligence, race, handedness, concussion history, and position.\nAdditional exclusion criteria for present analysis included the contingency that QSM raw data were saved successfully during the MRI examination and that the reconstructed QSM passed quality control checks. After these image quality assurance checks, which excluded subjects with significant motion, registration failures, or QSM processing failures, this study included a total of 153 QSM MRI datasets (78 acute injury subjects, and 75 matched control subjects). Complete study cohort demographics are summarized in\nTable 1\n. All methods utilized within the study were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of the Study Cohort\nInjured (\nn\n=\u200978 males)\nControl (\nn\n=\u200975 males)\nz\np\nAge (y)\n17.95 (17.63\u201318.27)\n18.43 (18.05\u201318.81)\n-1.53\n0.13\nHeight (in)\n71.79 (71.18\u201372.40)\n71.19 (70.62\u201371.76)\n1.41\n0.16\nWeight (lb)\n215.99 (205.11\u2013226.86)\n205.59 (196.47\u2013214.70)\n1.09\n0.27\nY.I.S (y)\n8.12 (7.41\u20138.84)\n8.08 (7.45\u20138.71)\n-0.01\n0.99\nP.SRC\n0.64 (0.43\u20130.85)\n0.52 (0.33\u20130.71)\n0.80\n0.42\nOpen in a separate window\nY.I.S, years in sport; P.SRC, number of previous sports-related concussions;\np,\nvalue from Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest; z, approximated z-score from\nU\ntest.\n\nQSM MRI\nMRI was performed on a 3T MRI system (Discovery MR 750, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) using a 32ch Nova Medical (Wilmington, MA) head receive array. The QSM were acquired at 0.75\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20090.96\u2009mm in-plane resolution across 2\u2009mm axial slices. Phase-sensitive MRI acquired at four echo times (10.4,17.4,24.4,31.4) msec and a repetition time of 58.6\u2009msec were used to construct magnetic field perturbation maps. The total acquisition time for each QSM MRI dataset was 4\u2009min.\nThe MRI-based magnetic perturbation scalar maps of the longitudinal component the perturbed magnetic fields were derived from the phase-sensitive MRI data. After background field removal from the perturbation maps,\n24\nsusceptibility inversion was performed using an adapted localized processing formulation\n25\nof the Morphology-Enabled Dipole Inversion (MEDI) algorithm (MEDI Toolbox update version date 11/06/2017).\n26\nRelevant parameters utilized in the MEDI algorithm are lambda\u2009=\u20091250 (regularization) and zero padding of 50% of the field of view. The QSM computations were performed using Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) Dell PowerEdge R730 servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 on Intel Xeon E5-2620v3 CPUs.\n\nStatistical analyses\nIndividual and group analyses were enabled via subject image registrations to a common coordinate space. A 2-mm isotropic Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) neurological template space was utilized.\n27\nRegistrations were performed using software contained within the FSL suite.\n28\nSpecifically, the\nFLIRT\nfunction in FSL was utilized using nine degrees of freedom and trilinear interpolation to develop transformation parameters. Warping of the images to the template space utilized the\napplywarp\nfunction to apply the computed transformations. Manual verification of template registrations was performed by the study team. No registration failures were identified in the template registration pipeline that necessitated further exclusion of any QSM datasets from the analysis cohort.\nBrain regions of sufficient QSM stability within the anatomic template space were identified by computing coefficients of variation (CV) across a control cohort (\nn\n=\u200968 examinations) from an independent study that utilized identical acquisition parameters. A stability mask was then constructed from this CV map at a threshold of CV\n<\n0.8, which is a QSM stability threshold that has been utilized within previous published studies.\n17\nRegional neurological segmentations extracted from the Johns Hopkins University and Harvard MNI space atlases\n29\n,\n30\nwere to define white and subcortical gray matter (SCGM) global compartments. The utilized compartments were refined using a physics-based masking operation that restricted white matter as\n\u03c7 <\n0.03 ppm\n31\nand SCGM as\n\u03c7 >\n0.05\u2009ppm susceptibility thresholds. This additional compartment masking was performed on a mean composite QSM volume computed from the aforementioned independent control cohort. Mean susceptibility values were computed within each gray and white matter region of interest for each subject and yielded a pair of QSM-MRI based biomarker estimates for each subject.\nReported QSM values were referenced to a cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) baseline, which was computed as the mean CSF compartment susceptibility value averaged across the control subject cohort.\nGroup comparisons of the acute injured and control cohorts were independently performed for the two QSM biomarkers and three clinical metrics. Normality tests on each distribution were computed using the Jarque-Bera approach.\n32\nGiven the resulting prevalence of non-normal behavior of distributions within the study data, non-parametric statistical tests were utilized. Statistical differences between groups were performed using Mann-Whitney\nU\ntests. Effect sizes of differences between the groups were also estimated using estimated z-scores from the\nU\ntest results.\nWithin the injured group, correlations were computed between each acute predictive metric (two QSM MRI compartments and three clinical metrics) and self-reported symptom duration. The symptom duration was determined through reviewer questioning at subject visits or follow-ups, whereby subjects were asked to recall the date at which post-injury symptoms (dizziness, headache, balance, confusion, lack of focus, etc.) had resolved fully. To assess the strength of the biomarker correlations as a function of injury severity, correlations were computed for three categories of symptom duration, whereby subjects with shorter durations of symptoms are progressively excluded from analysis. These categories were defined as: (1) all injuries, (2) injuries with symptom duration of at least one week, and (3) injuries with symptom duration of at least two weeks. The Spearman\n\u03c1\nwas used to assess correlations between each metric and reported symptom duration.\nCross correlations of the QSM and clinical measures were computed at an individual level within the injured cohort utilizing the full analysis complement of subject markers: acute QSM (white matter and SCGM) and acute clinical measures (SCAT-3, SAC, BESS; differences from baseline scores). Again, the Spearman\n\u03c1\nwas used to compute correlations.\nSubcompartment QSM-MRI analyses of the white matter and SCGM compartments (based on Johns Hopkins and Harvard MNI atlas segmentations) were performed using individualized z-score analysis. Mean subregional QSM-MRI metrics were computed from each subcompartment (\nj\n) within each individual subject (\ni\n), yielding the indexed parameter,\nI\ni\nj\n. In addition, means and standard deviations of the means were computed within of each subcompartment of the control cohort, yielding respective parameters,\nC\nmean\nj\nand\nC\nstd\nj\n. Subcompartment (\nj\n) z-scores were then computed for each subject (\ni\n), according to:\nz\nS\nc\no\nr\ne\ni\nj\n=\nI\ni\nj\n\u2212\nC\nm\ne\na\nn\nj\nC\ns\nt\nd\nj\n(1)\nFor each subject, the maximum subcompartment absolute z-score was then computed:\nj\ni\nm\na\nx\nZ\n=\nm\na\nx\nj\nz\nS\nc\no\nr\ne\ni\nj\n(2)\nFinally, the incidence rate of maximum subcompartment z-score was computed across the injured subject cohort of size\nn\ninj\n:\nM\na\nx\nR\na\nt\ne\nj\n=\n\u2211\ni\nj\ni\nm\na\nx\nZ\nn\ni\nn\nj\n(3)\nThis process was repeated for each of the aforementioned injury category cohorts.\nPredictive modeling of symptom duration was performed using binomial logistic regression. The predictors utilized in the regression models included the acute QSM MRI metrics and clinical measures (reported as differences from baseline scores). Regression models were computed using the individual (univariate) and combined (multi-variate) predictors of self-reported symptomatic durations. After the aforementioned correlation analysis, models were trained for two binary classifications: symptom duration of at least oe week (Category 2 injuries) and symptom duration of at least two weeks (Category 3 injuries) in length.\nBefore logistic regression modeling, predictor values for each metric were standardized through z-score transformations (mean of zero and a standard deviation of one). In addition, algorithm bias was mitigated by dividing each predictor data into training and testing cohorts using stratified k-fold cross-validation with k\u2009=\u200910, yielding a 10% validation holdout in each fold. Model training was class balanced\n33\nby weighting the dataset by class population ratios. For example, in training a set of 61 null and 13 injured cases, the injured cases were weighted by a factor of 61/37.\nThe results of these logistic models were used to perform receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis\n34\nof the specificity and sensitivity of the various markers to classify symptom duration within subjects. The area under the curve (AUC) of a ROC plot (sensitivity vs. 1-specificity) was used as a measure of performance of the predictive models. For a given model, an AUC of 1.0 indicates a perfect sensitivity and specificity of the classifier, whereas 0.5 indicates a random classification. Mean and 95% confidence intervals were computed for each of the logistic regression models, calculated from each fold of the k-fold cross-validation procedure.\nAll statistical and analysis procedures were performed using the Matlab Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (MathWorks, Natick, MA)."

Briefly, diluted complementary DNAs (cDNAs) were added to Taqman universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and run in triplicate. Target and reference gene PCR amplification was performed in separate tubes with the following Assay on Demand\u2122 primers (Applied Biosystems). Neural qPCR markers included claudin 11 (\nCldn11\n, Mm00500915_m1\n)\n,\nOlig2\n(Mm01210556_m1), and myelin basic protein (\nMbp,\nMm01266402_m1) (oligodendrocytes), neuron-specific enolase (\nNse/Eno2,\nMm00469062_m1) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (\nMap2,\nMm00485230_m1) (neurons), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (\nGfap,\nMm01253033_m1) and glutamine synthetase (\nGlul,\nMm00725701_s1) (astrocytes).\nThe ERSR mRNAs quantified include:\nAtf4\n(Mm00515324_m1, downstream of PERK),\nChop/Ddit3\n(Mm01135937_g1),\nXbp1\n(Mm00457359_m1),\nGadd34\n/\nPpp1r15a\n(Mm00435119_m1), and 78\u2009kDa glucose regulated protein (\nGrp78/Hspa5\n, Mm01333323_g1, an ER luminal chaperone protein that binds to PERK, ATF6, and IRE1 in the absence of unfolded proteins).\nThe qPCR assessments of multiple neural and ERSR mRNAs were compiled from the 13 studies performed acutely at 24, 48, or 72\u2009h post-SCI. Specifically, mRNAs were isolated at 24 (\nAtf6\n-/-\n), 48 (GSK, OL-\nPerk\n-/-\n), and 72 (\nChop\n-/-\n, Salubrinal,\nHri\n-/-\n, Gnb,\nGcn2\n-/-\n, Pkr\n-/-\n, Gadd34\n-/-\n, AQ, and OL-\nXbp1\n-/-\n) hours post-SCI. Initial experiments showed significant upregulation across all of these acute time points.\n19\nBMS\nLocomotor ability was assessed at weekly intervals post-SCI using the BMS locomotor rating scale\n2\nas reported previously.\n19\n,\n22\nMice were assessed in an open-field setting and rated by two trained observers, both blinded to experimental design and treatment. Mean left and right hindlimb scores from six weeks were used. Based on the BMS outcome at week 6, the 13 studies were grouped into three categories reflecting functional outcome. The first included studies with significant \u201cimproved\u201d differences in the BMS scores between the experimental and control groups (five studies), the second encompassed those with non-significant differences between the groups at week 6 (\u201cno change,\u201d six studies), and the third included studies with significant poorer outcomes in which BMS averages of controls were higher than those of the experimental group at week 6 (\u201cworse,\u201d two studies).\n\nCorrelation analyses\nThe means of the week 6 BMS scores, each of the neural and ERSR mRNAs in the experimental group were divided by the mean of the control group (E/C). Correlations between E/C\nAtf4\nand\nChop\nwith their corresponding E/C BMS were calculated in the following manner: For the\nAtf4\nE/C correlation with BMS E/C in the Improved Chop study, (\nn\n=\u20094 control,\nn\n=\u20094 experimental), the average for the four control\u2009=\u20093.30 and the average for the four experimental\u2009=\u20091.26. The Improved\nChop\nstudy E/C of\nAtf4\n=\u20090.383 (3.30/1.26). An\nAtf4\nE/C was calculated for each of the 13 studies. Each of the 13\nAtf4\nE/C values were correlated with their respective E/C BMS value.\nIndividual markers were pooled when averaged into neural, oligodendrocyte, astrocyte, and ERSRs for each of the 13 studies. For example, in the salubrinal study, the neuronal markers were calculated from the mean of the experimental group (\nn\n=\u20094) for\nMap2\ndivided by the mean of the control group (\nn\n=\u20093) mean Map2\u2009=\u2009E/C ratio of\nMap2\n. The same calculation was repeated for the\nNse/Eno2\nmRNAs in the study. The mean of the\nMap2\nand\nNse/Eno2\n=\u2009Neural E/C. These values were calculated for each of the 13 studies. For oligodendrocytes, this mean was calculated from\nCldn11\n,\nOlig2,\nand\nMbp\nE/C mRNA ratios, and for astrocytes\nGlul\nand\nGfap\nfor each of the 13 studies.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAveraged E/C neuron (\nMap2, Nse\n), oligodendrocyte (\nOlig2, Claudin11, Mbp\n), and astrocyte (\nGfap, GS\n) mRNA ratios then were divided by E/C ERSR mRNAs\nAtf4\nand\nChop\nonly to obtain the ratio of neural to ERSR ratios. Ratios were compared among the three BMS outcome study categories using one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey HSD\npost hoc t\ntests for multiple comparisons. Median tests were performed comparing neural markers (E/C) among the outcome groups. The relationship between the neural markers with the ERSR and BMS E/C ratios was performed using parametric or nonparametric (Pearson [r], Spearman rank [r\nS\n], respectively) correlations, depending on sample sizes. An astrocyte outlier (>3 standard deviations from the mean)\n19\nwas removed from correlations, because outliers will inflate coefficients artificially and reduce\np\nvalues."

    "Methods": "Datasets mined from FITBIR\nThe TRACK-TBI Pilot and COBRIT datasets were mined from FITBIR, and have been used in two previous studies assessing prediction of TBI outcomes based on the GOSE. These datasets included many overlapping data elements collected both during neurocritical care immediately after TBI, as well as outcomes collected six months post-TBI. The datasets were processed according to the PRISMA diagram in\nFigure 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nPRISMA diagram of data preparation and analysis. Color image is available online.\nThe TRACK-TBI multicenter observational pilot study was designed to assess the implementation of the TBI Common Data Elements (TBI-CDEs) to support data sharing in TBI research (FITBIR-STUDY0000246). A total of 650 patients who received CT scans in the ED within 24\u2009h of injury were enrolled at three level I trauma centers and one rehabilitation center.\n10\n,\n11\nWe analyzed TRACK-TBI Pilot data between April 2010 and May 2011 in which 599 patients with acute TBI were enrolled. As displayed in\nFigure 1\n, we excluded 27 patients who were under 18 years old and who did not complete outcome assessments at six-months post-injury, resulting in an analysis sample of 297 individuals.\nThe COBRIT is a phase 3 double-blind randomized clinical trial examining efficiency of citicoline compared with placebo for improving outcomes in TBI patients (FITBIR-STUDY0000240).\n12\n,\n13\nThe dataset consists of 1213 patients at eight level I trauma centers in the United States and was used to replicate the multi-variate outcomes identified in the TRACK-TBI Pilot and assess the predictive abilities of the ED clinical variables in a more severe TBI cohort. Only participants who completed the outcome assessments at six months post-TBI were included, resulting in an analysis sample of N\u2009=\u2009645 (\nFig. 1\n).\nWe include syntax used to pre-process the data, perform multiple imputation of missing clinical predictors, generate descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) (\nSupplementary Data 1\n), as well as a data dictionary to accompany the R code (\nSupplementary Data 2\n), code to generate the graphical results (\nSupplementary Data 3\n), and SPSS syntax for regression models (\nSupplementary Data 4\n). We provide more detailed descriptions of the statistical analyses used in the\nTechnical Appendix\n.\n\nTBI outcomes and ED clinical predictors\nThe reference TBI outcome is the GOSE. The other TBI outcomes consist of variables from the following domains: neuropsychological impairment, psychological status, TBI-related symptoms, and perceived health-related quality of life. Variables from the physical function domain, such as functional independence, were not included in the analysis because of an abundance of missing values. From the neuropsychological impairment domain, we used the completion time measurements from parts A and B of the Trail Making Test (TMT)\n14\nand the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition Processing Speed Index (WAIS-IV PSI).\n15\n,\n16\nFrom the psychological status domain, we used the three subcategories of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18),\n17\n,\n18\nwhich includes anxiety, depression, somatization, and global severity scores. Last, we used scores from Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS)\n19\n,\n20\nin the perceived health-related quality of life domain. All outcomes were assessed at six months post-injury.\nThe ED clinical predictors consist of gender, age, employment status, education status, marriage status, previous TBI injury, injury severity, blood alcohol level, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, intravenous saline application, and medical history of type social, neurological, and psychiatric. These predictors parallel those included in previous studies of the GOSE using the same data\n7\n,\n8\n; we aimed to compare their performance predicting the GOSE versus the multi-variate outcomes derived in the present study.\n\nDimension reduction layout\nDimension reduction techniques were used to identify multi-variate TBI outcome domains that could explain shared variance across the measures of neuropsychological, psychological status, TBI symptoms, and health-related quality of life measures. The multi-variate outcome domains were first derived using EFA on the TRACK-TBI Pilot measures, and then were cross-validated using CFA in the COBRIT dataset.\nEFA\nThis analysis using principal components extraction was used to identify underlying dimensions of variance across the TBI outcome domains in the TRACK-TBI Pilot. Principal components extraction uses eigenvalue decomposition of the observed-measure correlation matrix to extract orthogonal sources of variance that account for the interrelations among the observed variables.\n21\nThe components associated with the largest proportions of variance in the data were selected for interpretation as multi-variate outcome factors. The criteria for selecting components included a minimum cutoff of an eigenvalue of 1.0 and observed disjunctions in the scree plot of eigenvalues indicating a plateau in the additional variance explained through the inclusion of additional factors.\nCFA\nThis analysis was used to assess the replicability of the multi-variate outcome dimensions identified in the TRACK-TBI Pilot dataset in the COBRIT sample. The CFA assumes the covariation structure among a set of variables can be described as a linear combination of latent variables or unobserved variables called factors. The CFA estimates the relations between user-specified factors and the observed measures via maximum likelihood procedures. As such, we specified the relations between the factors and observed measures in COBRIT based on the results of the EFA in the TRACK-TBI Pilot.\nThe fit and loadings associated with the CFA model in the COBRIT sample were used to assess the replicability of the most salient multi-variate outcome dimensions identified in the TRACK-TBI Pilot. Because the CFA model does not attempt to explain the entirety of the variance-covariance matrix as with EFA, model residuals and the correspondence between the model-estimated and observed covariance matrices could be examined to detect misfit of the model in the replication dataset. The comparative fit index (CFI), root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), and squared root mean residual (SRMR) were used to determine the extent of misfit of the TRACK-TBI Pilot multi-variate outcome dimensions in the COBRIT sample.\n22\n,\n23\n\nPrediction model layout\nWe compare the performance of proportional odds logistic regression models that regress either the GOSE or the multi-variate outcomes onto the ED predictors. In addition, we identify predictors that emerge as significant across models as well as those that vary among the models with different outcomes. Using this information, we attempt to characterize the performance of the ED predictors in relation to participants' prognosis as described by either the simpler GOSE characterization or by the data-driven, multi-variate outcomes across the TRACK-TBI Pilot and COBRIT samples.\nWe entered an identical set of predictors into the regressions in each sample, but allowed the weighting of predictors (i.e., the regression coefficients) to vary across models given differences in TBI severities and patient characteristics. We therefore ran models regressing the GOSE and multi-variate outcomes onto the same set of predictors in each sample, allowing the predictors to be uniquely weighted according to the samples and outcomes.\n\nProportional odds logistic regression\nThe proportional odds logistic regression was used to assess the relative influence and overall explanatory ability of the clinical predictor variables across samples and outcomes.\n24\nBefore running the proportional odds logistic regressions, the outcomes data were pre-processed to maximize comparability of the models and outcomes across the TRACK-TBI Pilot and COBRIT samples.\nDiscretization was used to transform the continuous distributions of the multi-variable outcome measures into six-category, ordinal scales for comparison with the GOSE severity rankings. To achieve this discretization, each multi-variable outcome was cut at percentiles corresponding to -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2 standard deviations of an underlying Gaussian distribution. This transformation increased the comparability of models predicting the GOSE and multi-variate outcomes such that the estimation procedures were equivalent and the resulting parameter estimates had the same interpretations. For instance, the exponentiated regression coefficients from either the GOSE or the multi-variate outcome models would similarly reflect the increased odds of scoring in a higher category across the category thresholds given a one-unit change in the predictors.\nIn addition to discretizing the outcome variables, the predictor variables were pre-processed according to their variable types. Binary categorical variables (i.e., gender, employment, psychiatric history, drug and alcohol abuse history, TBI history, and whether participants received intravenous saline in the ED) were converted to dummy-codes such that a one-unit change in the variable was indicative of the difference between categories. Two dummy variables were computed for participant education: one variable indicated whether participants attended college and another indicated whether participants did not complete high school, such that high school completion was the reference category.\nIn addition, three dummy variables were computed for participant marital status: one variable indicated whether or not participants were married, the second indicated whether participants were divorced, and the third indicated whether participants had been widowed, such that having never been married served as the reference category. Finally, an additional binary variable was included to account for zero-inflation in the blood alcohol levels predictor (1\u2009=\u2009participant had zero blood alcohol, 0\u2009=\u2009participant did not have zero blood alcohol) to account for unique factors associated with having zero blood-alcohol. Imputation via the \u201cmice\u201d package in R was used to handle missing values on the predictor variables.\n25"

    "Methods": "Participants\nThis study was approved by the Medical College of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board and the U.S. Department of Defense Human Research Protection Office. As part of a prospective study on the acute effects of concussion, high school and collegiate athletes were enrolled between July 2015 and June 2020. Adult participants and parents of minor participants provided written informed consent. Written assent was provided by minor participants.\nAs part of the parent study (described in greater detail elsewhere),\n20\na cohort of football players and various non-contact athletes without a recent concussion (at least 6 months) were enrolled and completed a pre-season visit that included a detailed evaluation and comprehensive structured interview (demographic, health history, academic history). Self-reported years of exposure to contact sport (e.g., football, soccer) throughout the lifespan was recorded and serves as a proxy of RHI. Athletes also reported the number of prior concussions throughout their lifespan after being provided with a standard definition of concussion based on the U.S. Department of Defense definition, which included \u201ca blow to the head followed by a variety of symptoms that may include any of the following: headache, dizziness, loss of balance, blurred vision, seeing stars, feeling in a fog or slowed down, memory problems, poor concentration, nausea or throwing up. Getting knocked out or being unconscious does not always occur with a concussion.\u201d\n21\nIn addition to baseline visits, participants completed multiple in-season neuroimaging visits that corresponded with the schedule of acute injury visits for the parent study (i.e., <48\u2009h, 8 days, 15 days, and 45 days).\nExclusion criteria for this study included the following: history or suspicion of conditions known to influence cognition (e.g., epilepsy, moderate to severe TBI, or other neurological disease); injury during the study period that would preclude participation in the study protocol (e.g., concussion); current psychotic disorder or narcotic use, or any contraindication to study procedures (e.g., unable to undergo MRI); or poor scan quality or processing errors (e.g., due to motion artifacts; see below).\n\nImaging protocol and processing\nImages were acquired on a 3 Tesla General Electric MR750 whole-body magnetic resonance scanner using a 32-channel receive coil array. High resolution T1-weighted images (1\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm) were acquired via a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence with the following parameters: field of view\u2009=\u2009256\u2009mm; acquisition matrix\u2009=\u2009256; 160 slices; slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm; repetition time/echo time/inversion time\u2009=\u20097.592/3.008/900\u2009msec; flip angle\u2009=\u20098\u00b0. Cortical surfaces were reconstructed and tissue segmentation was performed on the T1-weighted images using the following steps implemented in FreeSurfer v5.3: removal of non-brain tissue, automated Talairach transformation, segmentation of the subcortical white matter and deep gray matter structures, intensity normalization, tessellation of the gray/white matter boundary, automated topology correction, and surface deformation following the intensity gradients of the image in order to accurately place the boundaries between gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The longitudinal stream was used to extract reliable volume estimates.\n22\nVisual inspection of each step of the processing stream was conducted. For the purposes of this study, the primary macroscopic structural outcome of interest included total segmented cerebral white matter volume.\n\nQSM processing\nQSM images were acquired at 0.75\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20090.96\u2009mm in-plane resolution across 2-mm axial slices. Phase-sensitive MRI acquired at four echo times (10.4, 17.4, 24.4, and 31.4) msec and a repetition time of 58.6\u2009msec were used to construct magnetic field perturbation maps. The longitudinal component the static magnetic fields, which were utilized for QSM estimation, were derived from the phase-sensitive MRI data. for each reconstructed echo-time image set. Following background field removal from the field maps, susceptibility inversion was performed using an adapted localized processing formulation of the Morphology-Enabled Dipole Inversion (MEDI) algorithm.\n23\nBrain regions of sufficient QSM stability within the anatomic template space were identified by computing coefficients of variation (CV) across a control cohort (\nn\n=\u200968 examinations) from an independent study that utilized identical acquisition parameters.\nA stability mask was then constructed from this CV map at a threshold of CV <0.8, which is a QSM stability threshold that has been utilized in previous published studies.\n18\nIndividual and group analyses were enabled via subject image registrations to 2\u2009mm isotropic MNI neurological template space.\n24\nRegistrations were performed using software contained within the FSL suite. Regions of interest (ROIs) were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) atlas.\n25\n,\n26\nMean QSM was calculated in a primary global white matter ROI derived from the JHU, as well as individual JHU ROIs for secondary,\npost hoc\nanalyses (\nTable 1\n). The utilized compartments were refined using a physics-based masking operation that restricted white matter as \u03c7 < 0.03 susceptibility thresholds.\n27\nReported QSM values are referenced to a CSF baseline, which was computed as the mean CSF compartment susceptibility value averaged across the subject cohort.\nTable 1.\nIndividual ROIs Comprising Global White Matter\nWhite matter ROIs\nContact sport exposure\nL.

An additional non\u2013diffusion-weighted Spin-Echo EPI scan was acquired with the phase encode polarity reversed to correct for distortions due to magnetic susceptibility variations using post-processing software tools. Each diffusion-weighted image set was visually inspected for artifacts and those that cleared were processed using an established preprocessing pipeline.\n33\n,\n34\nFirst, spatial distortions caused by magnetic susceptibility variations were corrected using the TOPUP function of the FSL software (version 6.0.0,\nhttp://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki\n).\n35\nMotion and eddy current related distortions were corrected using the EDDY function of FSL.\n36\nAfter the preprocessing, images were inspected again to ensure that the processing did not introduce artifacts or distortions. DKE software was utilized to estimate kurtosis and diffusion tensors (\nwww.nitrc.org/projects/dke\n)\n28\n,\n29\nand derive maps of kurtosis fractional anisotropy (KFA), mean kurtosis (MK), radial kurtosis (RK), axial kurtosis (AK), fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity (AD), and mean diffusivity (MD). Images were normalized to standard space using whole-brain white matter skeleton was extracted using the FSL toolbox, Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS).\n30\nMean diffusion metrics were obtained from ROIs, as above. Analyses were limited to identical ROI as used in the QSM to maintain consistency with QSM analyses.\n25\n,\n26\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics version 24 (Armonk, NY). Generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) were fit to determine the association of prior concussion and years of contact sport exposure with white matter volume, global white matter diffusion, and global white matter QSM. Age, and body mass index were used as\na priori\ncovariates in the analyses. Intracranial volume was included as an additional covariate for the model analyzing white matter volume as the outcome of interest. Concussion history was binned into three groups based on the distribution of the sample, consisting of groups with 0, 1, or 2+ prior concussions. Participant was modeled as a random effect to account for repeat scanning over time. Successive scans were performed over a 45-day period for each participant and sensitivity analyses revealed no current sport group (contact vs. non-contact) by time interaction (i.e., no within-season changes in metrics due to current sport participation). Significant effects of concussion or contact sport history on global diffusion or QSM white matter ROI were followed up with exploratory,\npost hoc\nGLMMs to assess subcompartments within that global metric (i.e., individual white matter ROIs that comprise the global white matter metric highlighted in\nTable 1\n). Given our\na priori\nhypotheses, statistical significance was evaluated at the 0.05 uncorrected alpha level. For exploratory\npost hoc\nROI analyses, statistical significance was evaluated at the 0.10 level for descriptive purposes."

Low-endotoxin bovine serum albumin (BSA) was from Millipore (Billerica, MA), and ultrapure LPS from\nEscherichia coli\nK12 strain was from Invivogen (San Diego, CA).\n14\nC-sucrose (350 mCi/mmol) was from Amersham (Little Chalfont, UK).\nFor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the following antibodies were used: goat polyclonal antifluorescein antibody (NB600-1273; 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL) from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO) as the capture antibody and biotinylated goat polyclonal antifluorescein antibody (GTX26655; 50\u2009ng/mL) from GeneTex (Irvine, CA) as the detection antibody.\nFor western blotting, the following antibodies were used: rabbit monoclonal antihuman phosphorylated (p)-IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 (I\u03baB kinase \u03b1/\u03b2; Ser176/Ser180 [2697; clone 16A6, diluted 1:100; from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA]); rabbit polyclonal antihuman IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 (orb157675; 1.25\u2009\u03bcg/mL) from Biorbyt (Cambridge, UK); rabbit polyclonal antihuman p-ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2; Thr202/Tyr204; [9101; diluted 1:1000; from Cell Signaling Technology]); rabbit polyclonal antirat ERK1/2 (9102; diluted 1:2000; from Cell Signaling Technology); mouse monoclonal antirat cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68; MCA341R; clone ED1, 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL; from Serotec, Oxford, UK); mouse monoclonal antimouse claudin 5 (CLDN5; 35\u20132500; clone 4C3C2, 0.25\u2009\u03bcg/mL; from ThermoFisherScientific); mouse monoclonal antihuman \u03b2-actin (3700; clone 8H10D10, diluted 1:10,000; from Cell Signaling Technology); and goat polyclonal antirat albumin (55710; 0.4\u2009\u03bcg/mL; from MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). For western blot detection, horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated antirabbit and -mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies (7074 and 7076, respectively; diluted 1:5000; from Cell Signaling Technology) or antigoat IgG antibody (sc-2354; 40\u2009ng/mL; from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used.\n\nLabeling of recombinant human proteoglycan 4\nFull-length (1404 amino acids) rhPRG4 was obtained from Lubris (Framingham, MA). For studies of PRG4 transport across the BBB, rhPRG4 was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), using the FluoReporter FITC Protein Labeling Kit from ThermoFisherScientific. FITC-labeled rhPRG4 (rhPRG4-FITC) was purified using spin columns provided by the manufacturer. rhPRG4-FITC preparations were run on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)/polyacrylamide gels (4\u201312%) under non-reducing conditions, and the gels were analyzed using the Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) Gel Documentation System. This analysis showed that the labeling process did not affect the integrity of rhPRG4 molecules, and no free FITC was found in rhPRG4-FITC preparations used in this study (\nSupplementary Fig. S1A\n).\n\nThe assessment of biological activity of fluorescein isothiocyanate\u2013labeled recombinant human proteoglycan 4\nThe biological activity of rhPRG4-FITC was examined using human brain endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3.\n37\nThese cells were provided by Dr. Pierre-Olivier Couraud (INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France). The hCMEC/D3 cells at passage 29 were grown in CytoOne multi-well plates (USA Scientific, Ocala, FL) in EGM-2 BulletKit medium (Lonza, Alpharetta, GA) containing 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.04% hydrocortisone, 0.4% fibroblast growth factor 2, 0.1% vascular endothelial growth factor A, 0.1% R3 insulin-like growth factor 1, 0.1% ascorbic acid, 0.1% heparin, and 0.1% gentamicin/amphotericin B at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO\n2\n/95% air. Cells were exposed to 100\u2009ng/mL of LPS for 30\u2009min before treatment with rhPRG4 or rhPRG4-FITC (150\u2009\u03bcg/mL) for 23.5\u2009h. Levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the cell-culture media were measured using a SimpleStep Human IL-6 ELISA Kit from Abcam (Cambridge, MA).\n\nThe rat model of traumatic brain injury\nAdult male Long-Evans rats, weighing 250\u2013275\u2009g (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN), were kept at 22\u00b0C with a 12-h light cycle and maintained on standard pellet rat chow and water\nad libitum\n. The surgical and animal care procedures used in this study conformed to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication No. 8023, revised 1978) and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Rhode Island Hospital. Four to 6 rats per group/time point were used for most experiments, with the exception of studies in which the effect of PRG4 on post-traumatic neuronal death was evaluated (\nn\n=\u200912 rats per group) and when the permeability of the BBB to PRG4 in rats sustaining TBI was measured (\nn\n=\u20093 rats per group). The controlled cortical impact model of TBI was used as previously described.\n38\nIn brief, rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal (i.p.) pentobarbital sodium (60\u2009mg/kg), and a 4-mm craniotomy was performed on the right side of the skull to expose the dura with the center of the opening located 3\u2009mm posterior to the bregma and 2.5\u2009mm lateral to the midline. Velocity of impact was 5\u2009m/sec, and the duration of impact was 50\u2009msec. The diameter of the impactor tip was 2.5\u2009mm, and the depth of brain deformation was set at 3\u2009mm. Animals were injected intravenously (i.v.; through the penis vein) with rhPRG4 (1, 2.5, or 5\u2009mg/kg) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl) at 1\u2009h post-TBI.\n\nThe\nin vitro\nmodel of the blood\u2013brain barrier and the transport of proteoglycan 4 across brain endothelial monolayers\nThe\nin vitro\nBBB model was based on primary cultures of rat brain endothelial cells. These cells were isolated from cerebral cortices of male or female 5-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Janvier Labs, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 medium as previously described.\n39\nThe animal procedures used in this study conformed to the EU Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Lyon Neurosciences Research Center.\nTo measure the transfer of PRG4 across endothelial monolayers, brain endothelial cells were plated in quadruplicate on Transwell polycarbonate membranes (pore size, 0.4\u2009\u03bcm; cell growth area, 1.12\u2009cm\n2\n) from Costar (Corning Life Sciences, Hazebrouck, France).\nWe first determined whether PRG4 has an effect on the integrity of endothelial monolayers. To this end, the flux of\n14\nC-sucrose, a paracellular permeability marker, across endothelial monolayers was measured.\n40\nrhPRG4 in DMEM/F12 medium containing 0.1% BSA was added to the blood (luminal) compartment at the concentration of 15, 150, or 1200\u2009\u03bcg/mL, and cells were incubated for 2\u2009h. Control cells (without rhPRG4) were treated in a similar manner. The flux of\n14\nC-sucrose was measured during the last 20\u2009min of the incubation period. Samples from the acceptor and donor compartments were analyzed for the content of\n14\nC-sucrose by liquid scintillation counting, and the permeability coefficient for sucrose (Pe) was calculated as previously described.\n40\nTransfer of PRG4 across endothelial monolayers and its putative saturability were evaluated in the luminal-to-abluminal direction. rhPRG4-FITC was added to the culture media to achieve the concentration of 15 or 150\u2009\u03bcg/mL, or was mixed with unlabeled rhPRG4 in the 1:8 proportion, so that the final concentration of total rhPRG4 amounted to 1200\u2009\u03bcg/mL. Cells were incubated for 2 and 3.5\u2009h, and concentrations of rhPRG4-FITC were measured in the acceptor and donor compartments. Clearance curves across the cell-filter system were generated as previously described.\n40\n\nMeasurement of blood\u2013brain barrier permeability to proteoglycan 4 in injured rats\nFor the BBB permeability studies, rats had their femoral vein and artery cannulated at one side of the body for the tracer/marker injection and collection of serial blood samples, respectively. This was completed shortly before the time point post-TBI (4\u201324\u2009h) at which the permeability measurements were done and required additional anesthesia (i.p. pentobarbital sodium). We first measured the permeability of the BBB to fluorescein-conjugated dextran of 70\u2009kDa, at 4, 6, and 24\u2009h post-TBI. Dextran (70-kDa) was injected i.v. at 2\u2009mg/kg and was allowed to circulate for 30\u2009min. Serial arterial blood samples were collected at 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30\u2009min after injection, and plasma was isolated by centrifugation. At the end of a 30-min circulation period, the marker was washed from the vasculature by transcardial perfusion with 200\u2009mL of ice-cold 0.9% NaCl. This effectively removed the residual marker from brain vasculature, as judged by undetectable levels of 70-kDa dextran in cortical samples collected from uninjured rats that underwent the same procedures. BBB permeability to PRG4 was measured at 4 and 24\u2009h post-TBI. rhPRG4-FITC was injected i.v. at 3\u2009mg/kg and was allowed to circulate for 40\u2009min. Arterial blood samples were collected as described for 70-kDa dextran with additional sample being collected at 40\u2009min after rhPRG4-FITC injection.\nAfter the transcardial perfusion with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl, cortical and hippocampal samples were quickly collected, weighed, homogenized in 10 volumes of 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in 50-mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged to obtain supernatant for further analysis. Plasma data were fit to the biexponential equations using a nonlinear regression analysis (SigmaPlot software; Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA). The BBB permeability surface area product (PS) for PRG4 and 70-kDa dextran was calculated as previously described.\n41\n\nThe assessment of recombinant human proteoglycan 4 stability in injured rats\nTo evaluate the short-term stability of rhPRG4 in the injured cortex and plasma, rhPRG4-FITC was injected i.v. (3\u2009mg/kg) at 4 or 24\u2009h post-TBI, and 40\u2009min later rats were perfused transcardially with 200\u2009mL of ice-cold 0.9% NaCl. Samples of the ipsilateral cortex were collected and processed using isotonic lysis buffer (see below). Blood samples were collected before initiating the transcardial perfusion and plasma was isolated by centrifugation. For comparison, rhPRG4-FITC was also administered to intact animals. To examine the long-term stability of rhPRG4, rats were injected i.v. with rhPRG4-FITC (3\u2009mg/kg) at 4\u2009h post-TBI and were euthanized at 24 or 48\u2009h after injury. Two rats per group/time point were used. Cortical and plasma samples were run on the SDS/polyacrylamide gels (4\u201312%) under non-reducing conditions, and the gels were analyzed using the Bio-Rad Gel Documentation System.\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\nConcentrations of rhPRG4-FITC and fluorescein-conjugated dextran of 70\u2009kDa were measured using fluorescein/FITC sandwich ELISA developed by our group. In brief, 96-well microplates were first coated (overnight) with the capture antifluorescein goat antibody. After blocking with 1% BSA at room temperature (45\u2009min) and incubation (1\u2009h) with appropriately diluted samples, microplates were incubated for 1\u2009h with biotinylated goat antifluorescein detection antibody, followed by a 20-min incubation with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:200; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The color reaction was developed for 2\u2009min using the Substrate Reagent Pack from R&D Systems, and it was stopped with 2\u2009N of H\n2\nSO\n4\n. The microplate reading was performed at 450\u2009nm with a correction for microplate uniformity at 540\u2009nm. The dynamic ranges of these assays (the range of concentrations within the linear part of the log-log plot) were 0.01\u20131.00 and 0.1\u20135.0\u2009ng/mL for rhPRG4-FITC and 70-kDa dextran, respectively. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variability for the rhPRG4-FITC assay were 3.1 and 4.4%, respectively, whereas those for the 70-kDa dextran assay were 2.8 and 3.9%, respectively.\n\nWestern blotting\nAt 6, 24, and 48\u2009h post-TBI, rats were anesthetized (i.p. pentobarbital sodium) and were transcardially perfused with 200\u2009mL of ice-cold 0.9% NaCl. Cortical samples were quickly collected and proteins were extracted using isotonic lysis buffer (150\u2009mM of NaCl, 50\u2009mM of Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 2\u2009mM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100), containing protease inhibitors (1\u2009mM of benzamidine, 100\u2009U/mL of aprotinin, 20\u2009\u03bcg/mL of antipain, 20\u2009\u03bcg/mL of leupeptin, 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL of pepstatin A, and 1\u2009mM of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (10\u2009mM of sodium pyrophosphate, 1\u2009mM of sodium orthovanadate, 1\u2009mM of sodium fluoride, and 1\u2009mM of \u03b2-glycerophosphate). Proteins were resolved with SDS/polyacrylamide gel (4\u201312%) electrophoresis under reducing conditions and were transferred onto 0.2-\u03bcm nitrocellulose membranes (ThermoFisherScientific). After blocking with 5% ECL Advance Blocking Reagent (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) for 1\u2009h at room temperature, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. Membranes were subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated antirabbit, -mouse, or -goat antibody for 2\u2009h at room temperature.\nFor detection, Lumigen TMA-6 (Lumigen, Southfield, MI) or SuperSignal West Dura extended duration (Pierce, Rockford, IL) chemiluminescence substrate and the Bio Imaging System Chemi Genius2 (Syngene, Frederick, MD) were used. In the analysis of optical density of the bands on immunoblots, levels of CD68, CLDN5, and albumin were normalized to the levels of \u03b2-actin, whereas levels of phosphorylated IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 and ERK1 were normalized to the levels of total phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of these proteins. This analysis was performed using ImageJ software (\nhttp://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/\n).\n\nReal-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction\nSimilar to the western blot analysis (see above), at pre-determined time points (6\u2009h and 1, 3, and 7 days) post-TBI, rats were anesthetized and were transcardially perfused with 200\u2009mL of ice-cold 0.9% NaCl. Cortical samples were quickly collected and total RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin RNA II Kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany). First-strand complementary DNAs were synthesized using oligo(dT)\n20\nprimer (50\u2009pmol) and 200\u2009U of SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase. The 20-\u03bcL reverse-transcription reactions also contained 40\u2009U of RNase inhibitor RNaseOut. For each reaction, 1\u2009\u03bcg of total RNA was used and the reactions were carried out for 30\u2009min at 50\u00b0C. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in Mastercycler EP Realplex2 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using TaqMan chemistry.\nThe following primers and TaqMan probes were used for TLR4: 5\u2019-GCCAGGATGATGCCTCTCT-3\u2019 (forward primer), 5\u2019-AGGGATTTTGCTGAGATTCTG-3\u2019 (reverse primer), 5\u2019-CATTGTTCCTTTCCTGCCTGAGACC-3\u2019 (probe); CD44: 5\u2019-TCAAGTGGGAATCAAGACAGTG-3\u2019 (forward primer), 5\u2019-TTCTCCTACTGTTGACAGCAATG-3\u2019 (reverse primer), 5\u2019-CCACAACTTCTGGTCCTGCGAGG-3\u2019 (probe); LGALS3: 5\u2019-AGAACAACAGAAGAGTCATCGTG-3\u2019 (forward primer), 5\u2019-TTGACCGCAACCTTGAAGT-3\u2019 (reverse primer), 5\u2019-CAACACGAAGCAGGACAATAACTGGG-3\u2019 (probe); and PRG4: 5\u2019-GTGCCCATCAAAGCCTCTT-3\u2019 (forward primer), 5\u2019-GCGTAGTAATCATAGCCGTCA-3\u2019 (reverse primer), 5\u2019-TTCCTCCACAATGAAGTCAAAGTGAGC-3\u2019 (probe). Peptidylprolyl isomerase A/cyclophilin A (PPIA) was used for normalization of the data obtained.\n38\nThe 25-\u03bcL PCR reaction mixtures contained 0.2\u2009mM of mixed 2\u2019-deoxynucleoside 5\u2019-triphosphate, 0.2\u2009\u03bcM each primer, 0.1-\u03bcM TaqMan probe, 5\u2009mM of MgCl\n2\n, 1\u2009U of HotStart Taq DNA polymerase, and 1/40 of the reverse-transcription reaction product. For PPIA, 1/1000 of the reverse transcription reaction product was used. The reaction mixtures were heated to 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009min and were then subjected to 45 cycles of denaturation (94\u00b0C, 15\u2009sec) and annealing/extension (60\u00b0C, 60\u2009sec).\n\nEvaluation of neuronal death in the injured brain\nRats received a single i.v. injection of rhPRG4 at 5\u2009mg/kg or vehicle (0.9% NaCl) at 1\u2009h post-TBI, and 10 weeks later were anesthetized (i.p. pentobarbital sodium) and transcardially perfused with 200\u2009mL of ice-cold 0.9% NaCl, followed by 200\u2009mL of 10% formalin in PBS. Brains were sectioned at 100\u2009\u03bcm in the coronal plane using a vibrating microtome. Sections were mounted on glass slides, stained using a standard thionin staining protocol for Nissl substance, and cover-slipped using DPX mounting medium. A Stereo Investigator (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT) system for stereology, paired with an Olympus BX53 microscope (Olympus, Waltham, MA), was used to trace the somatosensory cortices (barrel fields and upper lip region; bregma \u22120.8 to \u22123.7\u2009mm)\n42\nin the ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres across five serial sections for each rat.\nStereo Investigator's optical fractionator workflow was used to perform neuronal cell counts within the traced areas of interest. Neuronal cell counts were performed using a 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009oil lens with fractionator counting frames set at 50\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009\u03bcm and grid size of 1200\u2009\u00d7\u20091200\u2009\u03bcm reflecting the distribution of counting zones within the traced area of interest. This system was utilized to ensure unbiased, systematic random sampling of neurons within the region of interest. The estimated number of neurons within the region of interest was calculated using the Stereo Investigator software, which accounted for mean section thickness, the traced area of interest, and the number of neuronal counts within each counting frame (site).\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor statistical evaluation of data, one- or two-way analysis of variance was used, followed by the Dunnett or Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons. Results are presented as mean values\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.\np\n\u2264\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Animal preparation\nIn vivo\nexperiments were performed in adult male C57BL/6NTac mice (Taconics Bioscience Inc., Ejby, Denmark), between 9\u201318 weeks old and between 25\u201332\u2009g of weight. All animals were housed at the Danish Neuroscience Center (DNC, Aarhus University) in group cages (between 3\u20135 mice/cage) with ad libitum access to water and standard diet and with a 12\u2009h:12\u2009h light-dark cycle at constant temperature and humidity (21\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u20092 and 45%\u2009\u00b1\u20095 relative humidity). All experiments were performed between 10:00\u201315:00. All housing, breeding, and experimental protocols were conducted according to the regulations of the Danish Ministry of Justice and Animal Protection Committees, with the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate permit 2015-15-0201-00509.\nTwo experimental groups were used: WI (\nn\n=\u20095) and Sham-operated mice (\nn\n=\u20095). We performed all surgical procedures and OCT scans under surgical anesthesia with isoflurane (3% in 30% medical air for induction and 1.5\u20131.75% for surgical procedure and scans) and local anesthesia with lidocaine (10\u2009mg/mL\n\u22121\n; Farmaplus) on all surgical incision areas. We placed a bladder catheter using a polyethylene tube, PE-50 (I.D. 0.58\u2009mm, O.D. 0.96\u2009mm; Intramedic Clay Adams, Becton Dickinson, NJ) and collected urines as previously described.\n19\nBlood pressure (BP) was monitored using a blood pressure monitor (WPI Inc., Sarasota, FL) through a polyethylene tube, PE-10 (I.D. 0.28\u2009mm, O.D. 0.61\u2009mm) inserted and secured into the femoral artery. This catheter was also used to extract blood samples for arterial blood gas analysis. The mouse was mechanically ventilated through a tracheostomy using a polyethylene tube (PE-90, I.D. 0.86\u2009mm, O.D. 1.52\u2009mm) connected to a mechanical ventilator SAR-830/P (CWE Inc., Ardmore, PA). We also monitored end-tidal CO\n2\n(EtCO\n2\n) using a micro-capnograph (Microcapstar, CWE Inc., Ardmore, PA). We maintained body temperature at 37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C with a heating pad connected via feedback to a rectal thermometer (HB 101/2, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). To avoid body dehydration during the surgical procedure and before WI, we injected intraperitoneal (IP) 50\u2009\u03bcL of isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) every hour.\nThe ICP was measured using a solid-state transducer (Codman Microsensor, DePuy Synthes, Warsaw, IN) that was inserted through a cranial window of \u223c2\u2009mm drilled on the parietal and temporal bone, centered on the squamosal suture. For easy retraction after the experiment, we covered the probe with a layer of petroleum-based jelly and then secured with biocompatible dental cement for non-permanent applications (Carboxylatzement; Speiko, M\u00fcnster, Germany).\nFor visualization of the cortical microvasculature by OCT, the head of the mouse was fixed to a custom-made head-holder through a metal bar glued to the frontal bone. We placed an open-sealed cranial window of \u223c3\u2009mm on the parietal bone over the somatosensory area S1, contralateral hemisphere to the ICP probe, as previously described.\n20\nBriefly, the bone was drilled and the skull removed. Dura mater was carefully removed using fine forceps to improve visualization of the cortical vasculature. Before closing the window with a 5-mm cover glass, we covered the exposed brain with a layer of a mixture of 1.5% agarose in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (EcoCyte Bioscience, Dortmund, Germany).\nWe collected all the physiological data using a data acquisition device (PowerLab 8/35, ADInstruments) and acquisition software (LabChart, ADInstruments Ltd, Oxford, UK). We estimated CPP as CPP\u2009=\u2009BP - ICP. Arterial blood samples (55\u201370\u2009\u03bcL) were examined with ABL90 FLEX blood analyzer (Radiometer Medical ApS, Copenhagen, DK) to measure plasma pH, pCO\n2\n, pO\n2\n, Na+, K+, Cl-, Ca\n2+\n, HCO\n3\n-, glucose, oxygen saturation (sO\n2\n), hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit. If necessary, we adjusted base-deficit with I.V. administration of a sodium-bicarbonate solution (NaHCO\n3\n; 75mg/mL in physiological solution, 0.9% NaCl). Arterial blood gases and urine production during baseline and after brain herniation. Arterial blood samples of 60\u2009\u03bcL were withdrawn 10\u2009min after induction of WI (baseline) and after signs of herniation (\u223c30\u2009min. after WI). Urine production was measured over a 1-h timespan.\n\nOCT scans\nFor imaging, we used a commercial spectral-domain OCT system (Telesto-II, Thorlabs, Germany). The light source of the system has a central wavelength of 1310\u2009nm, and a bandwidth of 170\u2009nm. The A-line sampling frequency of the system is 76 KHz. The estimated imaging range and resolution in the axial direction were 1.6\u2009mm and 2.9\u2009\u03bcm in biological tissue, respectively. The lateral resolution was estimated as 3.5\u2009\u03bcm using a 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009objective lens (Mitutoyo, Kawasaki, Japan). The cortical microvascular structure was imaged using an OCT angiographic technique.\n17\nThe volumetric angiographic imaging was performed over a 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm\n2\nfield of view (FOV) in the cranial window, with 512\u2009\u00d7\u2009512 scan points. Each OCT-angiogram took \u223c13.5\u2009sec, with 5\u2009sec between the end of the previous volume and the beginning of the next one. We consecutively acquired 120 such volumes (\nFig. 1A\n). We initiated the OCT acquisition of the first angiogram volume simultaneously with the 2\u2009min of water infusion.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\n(A)\nMaximum intensity projection of 100 pixels of the en face image of the brain microvasculature of a single experiment from the optical-coherence tomography (OCT) volumetric scan.

The parameter used in this study to quantify capillary perfusion (fractional perfused volume) is the ratio of the number of capillary voxels to the total number of voxels, which is taken as a measure of the density of perfused capillaries. Color image is available online.\n\nOCT post-processing\nWith OCT-angiography, the contrast originates from scattering of red blood cell (RBC) motion.\n17\nTherefore, the intensity of OCT angiogram index the RBC flow, such that high (or low) intensity represents high (or low) RBC flow, and under the condition of diminished RBC flow in some vessels, the associated signal intensity within those vessels will drop to the level of static tissue.\nWe developed a MATLAB GUI to select the three-dimensional (3D) capillary region (100\u2009\u03bcm) for which we wanted to perform the analysis. Pial and larger vessels were excluded from the analysis by selecting a region 100\u2009\u03bcm in cortical depth. The MATLAB routine segmented the vessels from the background using a 3D enhancement filter\n21\nand thresholding (\nFig. 1B\n).\nAfter the identification of perfused microvessels, we defined fractional perfused volume (FPV) as the ratio of perfused capillary voxels to the total number of voxels. We used FPV as an optical index of the degree of microvascular perfusion. In our quantification setup, a decrease in FPV reflects a decrease in perfused capillary density due to an increase in the number of capillaries without active perfusion (stagnant blood or vessel collapse). We calculated FPV for each volumetric angiogram under the same FOV, and changes in the density of perfused capillaries during WI are shown as the relative change (%) in FPV to volume #1.\n\nWater intoxication\nWe induced WI as previously described.\n19\nBriefly, a solution 0.4\u2009\u03bcg\u00b7kg\n\u22121\nof desmopressin (dDAVP, Sigma-Aldrich) in sterile water was injected through a peritoneal catheter (PE-10) using an infusion pump (GenieTouch Syringe pump, Kent Scientific Corporation, Torrington, CT). The total volume injected per mouse was 20% of the body weight (BW), injected over a 2-min period. Mice were monitored for 40\u2009min after WI initiation. Sham-operated mice underwent identical surgical, monitoring and postmortem analysis protocols without the injection of 20% BW distilled water with 0.4\u2009\u03bcg\u00b7kg\n\u22121\ndDAVP.\n\nPostmortem analysis\nAfter the OCT scans, the brain was dissected to measure water-accumulation by the wet\u2013dry method.\n22\nThe two hemispheres were dissected and individually weighed and dried at 110\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. The water content was estimated using the following equation:\nBrain Water content (%)\u2009=\u2009100* [(Wet weight (g) \u2013 Dry weight (g))] / [(Wet weight (g))].\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe used R (R Core Team, 2012) for statistical analysis. The variability of physiological parameters and FPV during normal ICP were analyzed with an analysis of variance test. Linear regression analyses were run by linear mixed models constructed with relative change in FPV as the predictor, the physiological measurement (ICP, MAP, CPP) as the fixed effects, and subjects as the random effect. We generated locally weighted scatterplot using running average smoothing (LOWESS smoother \u2013 span\u2009=\u20090.07) to describe the relations between the increase in ICP and FPV in each animal. Each value is expressed in the text as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean unless specified elsewhere."

    "Methods": "Viral vector constructs\nThe viral vectors, pAAV-CBA-pmeLUC-WPRE and pAAV-CBA-FLuc-WPRE, were constructed as follows: The XbaI fragment of pmeLUC (kindly provided by Francesco Di Virgilio, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy) and the XbaI-NheI fragment of the pGL3-Basic Vector (Promega, Madison, WI) were excised and cloned into the pAAV-CBA-WPRE expression vector at the NheI site.\n43\nAdeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes 2/9 were produced by plasmid transfection with helper plasmids in HEK293T cells. After 48\u2009h, cells were harvested and lysed in the presence of 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 50\u2009U/mL of Benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) by freeze-thawing, and the virus was isolated using a discontinuous iodixanol gradient. The genomic titer of each virus was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.\n\nIntracerebroventricular injections\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and are in accordance with the NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Post-natal day 0 (P0) C57BL/6 albino mice (strain 493; Charles River, Wilmington, MA) received bilateral intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) AAV injections as previously described.\n44\nBriefly, newborn (P0) albino mice were cryoanesthetized and injected bilaterally with AAV2/9 using a 32-gauge Hamilton needle inserted 1\u2009mm to the right of the midline point equidistant from each eye and 1\u2009mm posterior to a line drawn from the anterior base of the eye. Neonatal mice were returned to parents until weaned.\n\nControlled cortical injury model and live imaging\nTwo months post-AAV injections, mice were anesthetized under isoflurane and received 150\u2009mg/kg of D-Luciferin (Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis, MO) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Animals were then immediately placed in the IVIS Spectrum (PerkinElmer, Hopkinton, MA) and imaged every 30\u2009sec over a 12.5-min period to establish the maximum pre-surgery baseline flux (photons per second). After imaging, mice were fixed in a stereotaxic frame and received either a CCI injury or sham surgery. Briefly, a longitudinal incision was made down the midline of the head to expose the skull. A 4-mm-diameter craniotomy was made on the right hemisphere, 0.5\u2009mm lateral to the sagittal suture and midway between lambda and bregma. The exposed dura was then impacted with the PCI3000 Precision Cortical Impactor (Hatteras Instruments, Cary, NC), using a 3-mm-diameter tip at a velocity of 3\u2009m/s, with a dwell time of 100\u2009msec at a depth of 1\u2009mm. Immediately after impact, animals were removed from the stereotaxic frame, injected with 150\u2009mg/kg of D-Luciferin, and returned to the IVIS for imaging, using the same parameters for the baseline image acquisition. After imaging, the incision was sutured and animals received a subcutaneous injection of 0.05\u2009mg/kg of buprenorphine for analgesia. Sham animals received the craniotomy, but no CCI injury.\n\nApyrase treatment\nAPT102, an optimized human apyrase, was produced from Chinese hamster cells.\n45\nThe elimination-phase half-life is \u223c36\u2009h in mice.\n46\nAnimals were injected with 1\u2009mg/kg of APT102 (APT Therapeutics, Inc., St. Louis, MO) by tail vein injection before the initial isoflurane induction.\n47\nVehicle-treated animals received tris-buffered saline as a control.\n\nTissue processing\nAnimals were euthanized 30 days after surgery. Animals were anesthetized with a cocktail of 120\u2009mg/kg of ketamine and 10\u2009mg/kg of xylazine before transcardial perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). After brain extraction, brains were postfixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C and then paraffin-wax embedded. Paraffin blocks were then sectioned coronally at 5-\u03bcm thickness and mounted on glass slides. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed to analyze anatomical structure changes. Dako Autostainer (Universal Staining Systems, Carpinteria, CA) was used for immunohistochemistry, using the Dako EnVision+ System-HRP (DAB). Sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohols. Antigen retrieval was performed by steaming in distilled water for 30\u2009min, and sections were then immunostained with antibodies against firefly luciferase (L0159; Sigma-Aldrich), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; PU020-UP; BioGenex, San Ramon, CA) and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1; 019-19741; Wako, Richmond, VA). After chromogen development, slides were counterstained with Shandon Gill I Hematoxylin (ThermoFisherScientific, Waltham, MA) to visual nuclei. Slides were then dehydrated though graded alcohols and cleared with xylene before mounting coverslips with Cytoseal (ThermoFisherScientific).\n\nHistological imaging\nAperio AT2 for whole-slide scanning (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) was used to capture bright-field images. Images were analyzed using ImageScope software (Leica Biosystems), using algorithms established to quantify the positive pixel counts of both GFAP and Iba1 staining, respectively, in the corpus callosum and thalamus. One section per animal adjacent to the injury zone was analyzed.\n\nIn vivo\nbioluminescence image analysis\nImages were processed using PerkinElmer's Living Image software.

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants were drawn from a longitudinal prospective TBI study. Inclusionary criteria for TBI included admission to the emergency department or level 1 trauma center at a major urban hospital. The comparison group of typically developing (TD) children was recruited through posting flyers throughout the community. All participants in the study were 8\u201315 years of age at enrollment. Exclusionary criteria for both groups included: previous history of brain injury, severe developmental or learning disability, hospitalization for a psychological disorder, or penetrating brain injury. Of the 147 (56 TD, 91 TBI) participants originally enrolled in the study, 98 (41 TD and 57 TBI) contributed to imaging data at 2 months and 128 (52 TD and 76 TBI) contributed behavioral data at 7 months (see flow chart Fig. S1). TBI severity was classified into uncomplicated mild TBI (mTBI) with no intracranial lesions and complicated-mild, moderate, and severe TBI (cmsTBI) using the admission GCS\n39\nand acute computed tomography (CT) findings. The Injury Severity Score (ISS) assessed bodily injury severity and was calculated by summing the squares of the three most severely injured body regions as rated by the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS).\n40\nIn subjects with mild or moderate TBI, skeletal or body AIS scores were\n<\n2 to minimize confounding influence of severe bodily injury on assessment of GCS scores.\n\nBehavioral measures\nValidated direct test and parent report measures of SR were used to evaluate SR. All measures have adequate split-half or test\u2013retest reliability.\nRegarding cool SR, the Conners\u2019 Continuous Performance Test (CPT-II)\n41\nwas used to assess focused and sustained attention. The CPT-II is a computerized go/no go task. Omission errors, or the number of times a participant fails to respond to a target, were used as a measure of focused attention. Hit reaction time change by block, or the slope of change in reaction time over the six blocks as the task progresses, measured sustained attention. Higher T scores represent greater difficulty.\nParent-report from the Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD and Normal Behavior measure (SWAN) assessed behavioral attention.\n42\nThe Inattentive Behavior subscale is the average of Items 1\u20139 rated on seven-point Likert type scale, with ratings ranging from \u22123 to +3; lower scores indicate greater inattention.\nRegarding hot SR, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) is an established task assessing risk-taking propensity. Participants were told that after the task, the number of points earned would determine the size of their prize reward. In each of 30 trials presented in the same order, participants choose how many times to pump an empty balloon that could explode on an unpredictable schedule at any point from 1 to 128 pumps. Cashing out prior to explosion is a safe option and increases payout; continuing to pump for greater reward is a riskier option. This measure has consistently correlated well with self-report measures of risk-taking.\n43\nThe average number of adjusted pumps for unexploded balloons predicts risk-taking propensity. A greater number of pumps represents a higher level of risk taking.\nThe Behavior Rating in Executive Functioning (BRIEF)\n44\nis a parent report of everyday executive functioning problems. The Emotional Control subscale assessed emotion regulation. Higher T scores (mean\u2009=\u200950, standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u200910) indicate greater difficulty with emotion regulation.\nThe Pubertal Development Scale\n45\nis a validated and reliable self-report measure of pubertal status. Child and parent independent ratings of changes associated with puberty were collected, including growth in height, body hair, and skin, and sex-specific changes. Parent and child ratings were averaged to yield a consensus score from 1 (pre-pubertal) to 4 (post-pubertal).\n\nProcedure\nData on retrospective pre-injury functioning for the TBI groups and baseline functioning for the TD group were gathered at a baseline clinical visit. Participants were scanned \u223c2 months following injury (for the TBI group). Trained research assistants administered the CPT-II and BART at 7 months. Parents completed the BRIEF measure, and SWAN ratings were obtained via clinical interview as part of a structured\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n(DSM) interview at baseline and 7-month visits. Behavioral outcome data were collected from all participants who attended their baseline and 7-month follow-up. All procedures were approved by the participating institutions\u2019 respective institutional review boards (IRBs).\nRegarding image acquisition, the current study used data acquired on a Philips 3T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner with a 32 channel head coil. Participants were scanned at the University of Texas McGovern Medical School. An echo planar imaging sequence (repetition time [TR]\u2009=\u20098700\u2009ms; echo time [TE]\u2009=\u200967\u2009ms; 65 slices total; square field of view [FOV]\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm; slice thickness\u2009=\u20092.5\u2009mm) was used for diffusion weighted data collection. High resolution T1-weighted anatomical scans were collected (TR\u2009=\u20098.1\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u20093.7\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u20096 degrees, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm, and voxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm\n3\n). Toward the end of data collection, the scanning facility upgraded the scanner with a Philips 3T Ingenia, and 45 of our participants with valid DTI data were scanned after the upgrade. We performed fidelity analysis to match diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted scanning protocols; however, some variations may remain. To account for differences in scanner, scanner change was included as a covariate in all DTI analyses.\nFreeSurfer 5.3.0 (\nhttp://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu\n) automated segmentation software was used for image processing parcellation of cortical and subcortical structures.\n46\n,\n47\nAfter standard Freesurfer pre- and post- processing steps, authors reviewed the quality of subcortical parcellation and edited parcellations (particularly subcortical regions) to ensure accurate masks. Using Linear Image Registration Tool (FSL: FLIRT), segmentation maps for each participant were then registered to corresponding diffusion-weighted images, creating the seed regions for DTI analysis. Seed regions for DTI analyses were restricted to each participant's anatomy.\nDorsal pathways included DLPFC to caudate, VLPFC to caudate, and dACC to caudate parcellations. Freesurfer divisions included: DLPFC\u2009=\u2009rostral middle frontal and caudal middle frontal; VLPFC\u2009=\u2009pars triangularis, orbitalis, and opercularis; and dACC\u2009=\u2009caudal anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. Ventral pathways included medial OFC (mOFC) to nucleus accumbens and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) to nucleus accumbens. We generated exclusion masks for DTI analysis corresponding to ventricular regions using the same image-processing pipeline.\nFMRIB Software Library (FSL) 5.0.1 (\nhttp://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl\n) was used for processing of DTI data, which was performed using the standard DTI pipeline. Eddy Correct was utilized to attenuate participant head movement and eddy current distortions. To provide an additional level of quality assurance of scans, each DTI scan was visually inspected for motion by two trained research staff members. There was a consensus on the subjects identified as having DTI data that showed motion artifact. These subjects were reviewed a final time by the research team and then excluded from further analyses. Brain Extraction Tool (BET)\n48\nwas used for skull stripping to remove non-brain tissue, and brain-extracted images were examined and corrected for quality assurance. Brain masks were edited for DTI analysis, DTIFIT was then used in calculation of FA maps, and Bayesian Estimation of Diffusion Parameters Obtained using Sampling Techniques (BedpostX) was used to build probability distributions in preparation for tractography.\nDiffusion tensor tractography (DTT) maps white matter pathways using DTI voxel-based values by reconstructing fibers by inferring directional information from acquired diffusion metrics, allowing for a fully reformed assessment of white matter pathway integrity. The current study used probabilistic methodology to determine fiber orientation and to designate voxels in white matter pathways. This method is particularly suitable in studying children with TBI or other neurological insults, given that pathway structure and relations to the rest of the cortical and subcortical network may not be as expected. Probabilistic tractography algorithm (FSL: probtrackx) uses voxelwise probability distributions to generate a distribution of pathways connecting specified regions, and this was applied for seed to target fiber tracking. This algorithm has been used for recent investigations of pre-frontal to subcortical white matter in children.\n49\nWe initiated one-way direction fiber tracking from each voxel in a seed mask to track all paths connecting to the target mask and discarding paths in contact with exclusion masks. Three dorsal pathways were constructed as the seed to termination points of DLPFC to caudate, VLPFC to caudate, and dACC to caudate. Two ventral pathways were constructed with seed to termination points: mOFC to nucleus accumbens, and rACC to nucleus accumbens. Thus, for each of the five seed-to-target combinations, we calculated the average FA for each hemisphere along the entire pathway. Fiber tracking within a diffusion space generated 5000 streamline samples (step length\u2009=\u20090.5\u2009mm; curvature threshold\u2009=\u20090.2). Because tract volume varies based on the size of seed regions, we normalized tract maps in order to account for voxel count in seed masks by dividing the number of streamline samples present in the voxels of the tract maps by the way-total. The way-total consisted of the total number of generated tracts from each seed mask that reached at least one of the other masks and had not been rejected by mask inclusion/exclusion criteria. Tracts were thresholded to voxels with FA values >0.2 in order to ensure pathways included only white matter.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData screening strategies, assumptions, and goodness-of-fit checks were conducted before behavioral and DTI analyses were run. Multivariate general linear models (GLMs) were conducted to examine the effect of group (TD, mTBI, cmsTBI), age, and sex, and their interactions on the right and left pathway FA with scanner change as a covariate. One multivariate GLM was run with each of the five pathways of interest as the dependent variable (DV) (dorsal pathways to caudate: dorsal ACC, ventrolateral pre-frontal cortex [PFC], dorsolateral PFC; ventral pathways to nucleus accumbens: rostral ACC, medial OFC). Non-significant interaction terms were trimmed. Significant multivariate effects were followed up using Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons. In order to minimize the number of analyses using correlated metrics, initial study design focused on FA as our primary DTI metric. However, considering the use of multiple DTI metrics may expand our understanding of underlying mechanisms;\n50\u201353\ntherefore, we conducted post-hoc GLM on mean, axial, and radial diffusivities for pathways showing significant group differences in FA using Bonferroni corrections. This methodological approach is similar to recent published research on white matter changes in pediatric TBI.\n35\nThe same approach was used with SR measures as the DV (Cool SR: focused and sustained CPT scores, parent inattention ratings; Hot SR: risk taking and parent emotional control ratings). Pre-injury parent ratings of inattention and emotional control were included as a covariate in models evaluating post-injury SWAN and BRIEF ratings, respectively.\nEffect sizes benchmarked against Cohen's criteria were evaluated using partial eta squared (\n\u03b7\np\n2\n) for multivariate and univariate models (small\u2009=\u20090.01, medium\u2009=\u20090.06, and large\u2009=\u20090.14) and Hedges\ng\nfor follow-up pairwise comparisons between groups. Imaging analyses were run for participants with and without behavioral data, and behavioral analyses were run for those with and without imaging data.\nMulticategorical mediation analyses were conducted through PROCESS with 10,000 bootstrap re-samplings and 95% confidence intervals\n54\nto examine whether the effect of group on SR outcomes was mediated through pathway FA. From five right and five left hemisphere pathways, target pathways were selected if FA varied significantly by group or if partial (age) Spearman or Pearson correlations identified significant relations of pathway FA with SR outcomes. Four mediation models were run with group as the independent variable (IV) (with the TD group as the reference group) and scanner change as a covariate; DVs were 7-month CPT omission errors, BART pumps, and BRIEF emotional control with pathway FA at 2 months as the mediators."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThe National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) maintains a database that pools information from approximately 31 Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADCs).\n10\nFor the purpose of this study, data from the Uniform Data Set (UDS) was used. The UDS is a longitudinal database and is publicly accessible. More information on the contents of UDS can be referenced by Beekly and colleagues\n11\nand Besser and colleagues.\n12\nParticipants aged \u226550 and cognitively normal as defined by the NACC-UDS variable were included in this study. Data was extracted from this sample by filtering the NACC-UDS variable. All participants from this sample who presented with a diagnosis of stroke, transient ischemic attack, Parkinson's disease, seizures, drug abuse, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder were excluded from the sample and all calculations. This sample was then filtered for history of TBI, leading to two groups, one with a history of TBI and one without. The final sample was 1774 participants, with 266 with a history of TBI, and 1508 participants without a history of TBI. These participants were examined for NPI-Q scores, along with sleep disturbance variables (Insomnia, Apnea). Data for insomnia and apnea was extracted from past medical history reported in NACC-UDS.\n\nMeasures\nA validated retrospective (1-month) informant-based interview/questionnaire that assesses neuropsychiatric symptoms is called the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The more recent form of this questionnaire has an additional two fields (nighttime behaviors and appetite) to the pre-existing 10 domains and is referred to as the NPI-Q. The NPI-Q measures NPS by using questions regarding each domain (Delusions, Hallucinations, Agitation/Aggression, Dysphoria/Depression, Anxiety, Euphoria/Elation, Apathy/Indifference, Disinhibition, Irritability/Lability, Aberrant Motor Behavior, Nighttime Behavior, Appetite/Eating), and asks the informant to rank each of them in severity ranging from 1-3, where no change is 0. The validity of NPI-Q has been tested to show adequate test\u2013retest reliability and convergent validity similar to NPI ratings, in addition to high correlation of symptom severity scales between NPI-Q and NPI.\n13\nThe NPI-Q was used in this study as a means of evaluating the neuropsychiatric impact of a TBI. The Montreal-Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a cognitive screening test for the detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is a self-reported measure of depression among the elderly population.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThis study consisted of a generalized linear model estimated by generalized estimating equations.\n14\nSpecifically, a binomial logistic regression model was used to examine NPI-Q domains in participants with a history of TBI versus without a history of TBI. Sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) as defined by the height and weight of a person were used as covariates.\nTo determine if variables differ statistically for participants with a history of TBI versus without a history of TBI, a Mann-Whitney U test\n15\nwas used due to the non-parametric nature of the variables (age, BMI, years of education, MoCA, and GDS). A chi-squared test\n16\nwas used to observe significant association between sex and TBI, as these are nominal variables.\nIn the logistic regression model, the binary dependent variable (having a certain NPI-Q domain) was coded as 0 (do not exhibit) or 1 (does exhibit). Exponentiation of the B coefficient (EXP(B)) can be interpreted as a probability percentage change of the outcome event for each unit increase in the predictor.\n17\nAll continuous variables (age, BMI) were checked against other curves, such as logarithm and power, and confirmed for linearity using trend analysis. Multi-collinearity was checked using linear regression for each independent variable in each model against each other. None of the predictors had a tolerance less than 0.7. A Spearman correlation\n18\nalso was run to see associations between variables. All statistical analyses were done using SPSS 26. All information regarding logistic regression procedure can be found on IBM SPSS regression 26 manual and the interpretation of the output can be found on Bors'\nData Analysis for the Social Sciences: Integrating Theory and Practice.\n19"

    "Methods": "Participants\nThis cross-sectional, international multi-cohort study of childhood TBI included children recruited into two large observational studies conducted in Australia\n27\nand North America.\n33\nThe studies adopted a unified approach to data collection and coding procedures and recruited well-characterized cohorts that were comparable in terms of sex, TBI severity, injury mechanism, age at recruitment, age at injury, and time post-injury. All procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008.\nThe combined sample involved a total of 218 children. This included children hospitalized for TBI (\nn\n=\u2009116) or OI (\nn\n=\u200959), as well as a typically developing control group (TDC;\nn\n=\u200943). Children with TBI and OI were recruited from academic hospitals in four cities in North America and one in Australia. These hospitals included the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto (Canada), Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio (United States), Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital and MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio (United States), and the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne (Australia).\nFor the TBI and OI groups, participants included children and adolescents who had been hospitalized for their injuries at least 12 months before study participation. All children were injured after three years of age and were seven to 16 years of age at time of participation. The TBI group was restricted to children with complicated mild to severe TBI. STBI was classified based on a lowest post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less, and moderate TBI was classified based on a GCS score from 9 to 12. Complicated mild TBI was classified based on a GCS score of 13 to 15 in association with trauma-related abnormalities on neuroimaging at the time of hospitalization. Children with GCS scores of 13 to 15 without any trauma-related abnormalities or without neuroimaging were not eligible.\nMembers of the OI group were recruited from the four North American sites and consisted of children who sustained fractures not associated with any loss of consciousness or other risks or indications of brain injury (e.g., skull or facial fractures). The TDC group were recruited through local Australian schools chosen to provide a range of socioeconomic backgrounds and were group matched to TBI and OI children on age and sex. For the current study, children were grouped according to the following classifications: STBI (\nn\n=\u200933), complicated mild-moderate TBI (MTBI;\nn\n=\u200983), OI (\nn\n=\u200959), and TDC (\nn\n=\u200943).\nThe following exclusion criteria applied to all children in the study: (a) history of more than one serious injury necessitating medical treatment; (b) pre-morbid neurological disorder or intellectual disability; (c) non-accidental injury; (d) a history of severe psychiatric disorder necessitating hospitalization before the injury; (e) any sensory or motor impairment that prevented valid administration of study measures; (f) not fluent in English. As outlined above, participants were recruited at children's hospitals at five metropolitan sites in North America and Australia. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Boards at participating institutions. Children and their parents were invited to participate only after parents gave informed consent. The current study used a cross-sectional design with outcome data reported from a single time point when injured children were at least 12 months post-injury.\nTable 1\ndisplays participant demographic and injury information. The groups did not differ in terms of sex or age at study participation. The groups differed significantly in terms of years of maternal education and age at injury; maternal education was higher in the OI and TDC groups compared with the STBI and MTBI groups, and age at injury was lower in the OI group than in the two TBI groups. The groups also showed expected differences in mechanism of injury, with motor vehicle accidents being most common among the children with STBI and sports/recreational injuries being most common among children with OI. Even after mechanism of injury was considered, group differences in maternal education remained statistically significant. Because differences in maternal education did not appear intrinsic to injury groups, we treated maternal education and age as covariates in all analyses involving the primary outcome variables.\nTable 1.\nGroup Demographics and Injury Characteristics\nSTBI\nMTBI\nOI\nTDC\nF/\u03c7\n2\np\n\u03b7\n2\n/V\nn\n33\n83\n59\n43\n-\n-\n-\nChild age at testing\n10.61 (2.24)\n11.13 (2.07)\n10.61 (1.68)\n10.25 (3.04)\n1.68\n0.17\n0.02\nChild age at injury\n8.23 (2.71)\n8.82 (2.37)\n7.85 (1.80)\n-\n3.20\n0.04\n0.04\nChild sex (male),\nn\n(%)\n20 (60.61)\n55 (66.27)\n36 (61.02)\n24 (55.81)\n1.20\n0.75\n0.07\nParent education (years)\n12.81 (2.39)\n13.74 (2.46)\n14.85 (2.26)\n14.58 (2.11)\n7.14\n<0.001\n0.09\nInjury mechanism,\nn\n(%)\n30.20\n<0.001\n0.29\nMVA\n18 (54.55)\n25 (30.12)\n3 (5.08)\n-\nSports/Rec\n5 (15.15)\n21 (25.30)\n27 (45.76)\n-\nFall\n10 (30.30)\n37 (44.58)\n29 (49.15)\n-\nOpen in a separate window\nSTBI, severe traumatic brain injury; MTBI; complicated mild-moderate traumatic brain injury; OI, orthopedic injury.\nTDC, typically developing control; MVA, motor vehicle accident.\n*\nValues in parentheses indicate standard deviation.\n\nMeasures\nToM\nChildren were administered three measures assessing different aspects of ToM. Each measure has been validated previously in children with school-age TBI.\n26\n,\n33\nThe Jack and Jill Task\n34\nwas administered to assess cognitive ToM, reflected in children's understanding of false beliefs. Participants are shown three consecutive frames on a computer screen. Each frame includes a character (Jack and/or Jill), two hats (red and blue), and a ball. In Frame A of each sequence, Jack is preparing to drop a ball into either a blue or red hat while Jill watches. In Frame B, Jack either moves the ball further into the blue hat (unswitched trials) or switches the ball to the red hat (switched trials). Jill is present in half of Frame B trials (witnessed trials) and absent in the other half (unwitnessed trials). In Frame C, participants decide whether Jill's belief about the location of the ball is correct or incorrect. Jill's judgment depends on what she believes about the ball's location, not its actual location: she will choose the original (Frame A) hat if she did not witness the switch.\nThe ToM trials involve an unwitnessed switch of hat color; control trials are those in which the switch was witnessed. Percentage of correct responses for switched, unwitnessed trials was the primary measure of cognitive ToM.\nThe Emotional and Emotive Faces Task (EFFT)\n17\nwas administered to assess affective ToM, or the child's understanding of the difference between emotional expression (how a character actually feels) and emotive communication (the emotion a character expresses socially, which may be different from the felt emotion). Children were presented with short narratives that described a character in situations that were meant to evoke one of five basic emotions: happiness, sadness, disgust, fear, and anger. In each vignette, a discrepancy existed between the emotion felt \u201cinside\u201d and the character's facial expression.\nIn keeping with the interpretative guidelines provided by the test developers,\n33\neach vignette involves (1) affective ToM trials, which ask the child how the character looked on his/her face (\u201clook on face\u201d condition) and (2) otherwise identical control trials, which merely require the child to select the facial emotion display that matches the in-text description of how the protagonist was feeling (\u201cfeel inside\u201d condition).\n\u201cFeel inside\u201d control trials are considered distinct from affective ToM trials because they simply require the child to select the facial emotion display that matches the explicit in-text description of the protagonist's emotional state.\n17\nPercent accuracy for emotive communication trials (i.e., \u201clook on face\u201d) was the primary measure of affective ToM.\nThe Ironic Criticism and Empathic Praise task (ICEPT)\n33\nassesses conative ToM, or the child's understanding of how indirect speech acts are used to influence the mental or emotional state of the listener. Children were presented with six pictured scenarios involving two children, one of whom was engaged in an activity and another who commented on the performance of the activity. The pictures were presented alongside a narrative, and an audiotape of the speaker's utterances with neutral, ironic, or empathic intonation. Children were told the goal of the child engaged in the activity (e.g., to build a tower), the outcome (e.g.. \u201cthe tower was \u2026\u201d), the speaker's character (e.g., \u201cshe liked to cheer people up\u201d), and what the speaker said (e.g., \u201cYou made a great tower\u201d).\nIn line with the interpretative guidelines provided by the test developers,\n33\neach vignette involves (1) conative ToM trials requiring the child to identify the beliefs and intentions underlying referentially opaque communications involving irony and empathy, and (2) otherwise identical control trials that have comparable domain-general cognitive demands but do not require conative ToM processing. Percentage of correct responses for conative ToM trials was employed as the primary measure of outcome.\nSocial adjustment\nParents rated their child's social functioning using the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System\u2013Second Edition (ABAS-II).\n35\nThe ABAS-II is a parent-report questionnaire that provides a detailed evaluation of everyday adaptive function, specifically designed to assess patients with neurological disorders, including TBI, and is normed for young children through adults. To assess social adjustment, we used the Social Skills, Communication, and Self Direction subscales (standardized with mean [M]\u2009=\u200910; standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u20093), which all comprise items that directly assess the child's ability to communicate and behave appropriately in social interactions. Concurrent validity of the ABAS-II is supported by correlations (ranging from 0.70 to 0.84) between the ABAS and other related rating scales, including the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale.\n36\nParents also rated their child's emotional and behavioral adjustment using the Behavior Assessment System for Children\u2013Second Edition (BASC-2). The BASC-2 assesses both adaptive and problem behaviors, which are rated on a four-point scale from \u2018\u2018never\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018almost always.\u2019\u2019 For the present study, the Behavioral Symptom Index (BSI) was used as the measure of social adjustment.\n\nStatistical analyses\nConsistent with the approach of the test developers,\n33\nindividual scores on the ToM subtests were transformed to the same metric (i.e., % correct for ToM tasks), and a composite score was generated for each participant by averaging performance across the tasks. This yielded an overall indicator of ToM for use in subsequent mediation analyses. Calculation of the ToM composite score is in keeping with the approach adopted in previous TBI research\n29\nand is supported by the results of a factor analysis showing that the three measures loaded on a single factor.\n29\nAnalysis of covariance and planned contrasts\nOne-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) and planned contrasts were used to examine whether groups differed on ToM, as well as on measures of social adjustment. Age at assessment and sex were entered as covariates in all models. In keeping with previous research,\n37\n,\n38\nwe expected no statistically significant differences between the TDC and OI groups on either demographic or social/behavioral outcome variables.\nAs predicted, the OI versus TDC planned contrasts revealed that the OI and TDC groups were comparable on all demographic and social/behavioral outcome variables collected. On this basis, the TDC and OI group was combined into a single group (i.e., OI/TDC combined) to increase our statistical power and to reduce the number of planned contrasts in each analysis. In addition, by combining the OI and TDC groups, we were able to mimic the mix of Australian and North American participants that characterize the TBI groups (i.e., when they are considered separately, all of the TD group are from Australia and all of the OI group are from North America). Based on the factors described above, all analyses involving the primary outcome variables included the following set of three planned contrasts: (1) OI versus TDC; (2) MTBI versus OI/TDC combined; (3) STBI versus OI/TDC combined.\nMediation analyses\nIn the statistical literature, mediation is quantified by the effect of\nX\non\nY\nthrough\nM\n, which is called the\nindirect effect\n. In contrast, the effect of\nX\non\nY\nthat is not mediated by\nM\nis referred to as the\ndirect effect\n. In our study, mediation analyses were conducted with the bootstrap method using PROCESS V2.16 for SPSS.\n39\nBootstrap resampling is a powerful method for detecting mediating effects with no assumptions required of the sampling distribution for these effects. Bootstrapping produces upper and lower bound confidence intervals (CI) for the point estimate of a mediating effect, which should exclude 0 to reject the null hypothesis (i.e., no mediating effect).\n39\u201341\nPROCESS was conducted using model 4 and bias-corrected 95% CI produced from 10,000 bootstrap resamples.\nFor each model predicting social adjustment, group was entered as an independent variable, coded as three dichotomous dummy variables (OI vs. TDC; MTBI vs. OI/TDC combined; STBI vs. OI/TDC combined), and ToM was entered simultaneously as a mediator of group effects on social adjustment."

    "Methods": "All procedures were reviewed and approved by institutional review boards at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Naval Medical Research Center, and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Informed consent was provided by all participants, and all procedures were performed during a 4-day evaluation at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. A total of 20 current or previous military or civilian law enforcement breachers were recruited into the study. Breachers must have had at least 4 years of experience in breaching and be actively involved (at least annually) in breacher training or operations.\n\nAlternatively, former breachers could qualify if they have been exposed to at least 400 breaching blasts within a career. A total of 14 controls were recruited and exhibited similar characteristics as the experimental group in terms of age, sex, and operational experience. Controls must have had at least 4 years of military operational or law enforcement experience, be actively involved in military or civilian law enforcement training or operations, and could not have been exposed to more than 40 individual blasts over a career. A history of moderate-to-severe brain injury with loss of consciousness >5\u2009min, diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) disorder, and cardiac, respiratory, or other medical conditions affecting cerebral metabolism were all criteria for exclusion from the study.\n\nImaging\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using a 3 Tesla Siemens mMR Biograph (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head and neck coil. Structural MRI sequences included high-resolution T\n1\n-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) imaging (repetition time [TR]\u2009=\u20091900\u2009msec, echo time [TE]\u2009=\u20092.53\u2009msec, flip angle\u2009=\u20099 degrees, and voxel size\u2009=\u20091\n\u00d7\n1\n\u00d7\n1\u2009mm\n3\n), T\n2\n-weighted sampling perfection with application optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolution (SPACE) imaging (TR\u2009=\u20093200\u2009msec, TE\u2009=\u2009280\u2009msec, and voxel size\u2009=\u20090.5\n\u00d7\n0.5\n\u00d7\n1\u2009mm\n3\n), fluid attenuation inversion recovery SPACE imaging (TR\u2009=\u20096000\u2009msec, TE\u2009=\u2009386\u2009msec, and voxel size\u2009=\u20091\n\u00d7\n1\n\u00d7\n1\u2009mm\n3\n), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI; TR 8900\u2009msec, TE 98\u2009msec, and voxel size\u2009=\u20092.2\n\u00d7\n2.2\n\u00d7\n3\u2009mm\n3\n, 34 diffusion directions, with 55 slices).\nIn addition to structural MRI sequences, resting-state (rs-fMRI) functional MRI (fMRI) blood oxygen level\u2013dependent (BOLD) data were obtained using a gradient-echo echo planar imaging sequence (EPI; TR\u2009=\u20092000\u2009msec, TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009msec, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, spacing between slices 3.66, 3.0\u2009mm slice thickness, and matrix size 64\n\u00d7\n64) in a 10-min acquisition, which resulted in 300 volumes. Brain perfusion was also determined utilizing first-pass gadolinium perfusion imaging (EPI pulse sequence, TR\u2009=\u20092800\u2009msec, TE\u2009=\u200920\u2009msec, flip angle\u2009=\u200940\u00b0, and voxel size\u2009=\u20092.5\n\u00d7\n2.5\n\u00d7\n4\u2009mm\n3\n). Forty sets of 30 images were acquired over a period of \u223c1.5\u2009min after administration of 9.7\u2009mL of gadolinium contrast agent.\n\nDemographics, clinical history, and neuropsychological assessment\nInterviews were conducted with participants to collect demographic information and clinical history. Screening neurological history and examination were performed by a board-certified neurologist (E.M.W.). Psychometric testing was performed to evaluate a series of cognitive domains.\nTesting included: Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM), Beck Depression Inventory\u20132nd edition (BDI-II), Booklet Category Test (BCT), Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI-18), California Verbal Learning Test\u20132nd edition (CVLT-II), Combat Exposure Checklist (CEC), Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) Sorting and Verbal subtests, Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe), Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Test (ImPACT), Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), Medical Symptom Validity Test (MSVT), NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), Revised Self-Monitoring Scale (RSMS), Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT), Rivermead Postconcussive Questionnaire (RPQ), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Trail Making Test (TMT), Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence II (WASI-II), Wechsler Memory Scale III Logical Memory subtests (WMS-III LM I & II), and Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR).\nAdditionally, subjects were administered the Post-Traumatic Checklist\u2013Military version (PCL-M), which demonstrated that neither breachers nor controls exceed the recommended post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) cutoff of 44.\n\nBlood biomarkers\nNon-fasting blood samples were collected using serum separator tubes between around 9:00\nam\nand 12:00\npm\n, before interviews and the battery of tests. Samples were processed within 1\u2009h of blood sample collection, using standard protocols,\n20\nand then stored at \u221280\n\u2218\nC. Samples were stored until all samples had been collected, at which time batch assays were conducted.\nExosome isolation from serum\nExosomes were isolated from 0.8\u2009mL of frozen serum. After thawing the serum, samples were centrifuged at 3000\ng\nfor 15\u2009min at 4\n\u2218\nC to remove debris and the supernatant was transferred into a clean tube. ExoQuick solution (System Biosciences Inc., Mountain View, CA) was added to the samples according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were incubated for 1\u2009h at 4\n\u2218\nC and centrifuged at 1500\ng\nfor 30\u2009min. After the centrifugation, the supernatant was aspirated and the pellet was resuspended in 0.8\u2009mL of Dulbecco's calcium- and magnesium-free salt solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). From each sample, 100\n\u03bc\nL of the resuspended pellet were stored at \u221280\n\u2218\nC and later used to measure total exosome protein content. The remainder of each sample was used to isolate and analyze neuronal exosomes.\nTo enrich for neuronal-derived exosomes, each suspension was incubated for 1\u2009h at 4\n\u2218\nC with mouse/antihuman CD171 (L1CAM) biotinylated antibody (clone 5G3; eBioscience, San Diego, CA) in 50\u2009\u03bcL of 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; 1:3.33 dilution of blocker BSA in a 10% solution in phosphate-buffered saline; ThermoFisherScientific, Inc., Rockford, IL), for a final antibody concentration of 1:100. Next, 30\n\u03bc\nL of Streptavidin\u2013agarose Ultralink resin (ThermoFisherScientific) in 50\n\u03bc\nL of 3% BSA was added to each sample tube and incubated overnight with continuous mixing at 4\n\u2218\nC. Then, samples were transferred to Pierce\nTM\ncentrifuge columns (0.8\u2009mL; ThermoFisherScientific) and centrifuged at 6000\ng\nfor 5\u2009min. The content trapped in the column was then washed three times using 500 uL of 1\n\u00d7\nTris-buffered saline (TBS). For each wash, after adding the TBS, columns were centrifuged again at 6000\ng\nfor 5\u2009min. After the last wash, each column received 100\n\u03bc\nL of Pierce Gentle Ag/Ab Elution Buffer (ThermoFisherScientific) and was centrifuged at 10,000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min. The neuronal-exosome\u2013enriched sample was collected and stored at \u221280\n\u2218\nC.\nProtein quantification\nAfter having been thawed, samples received M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent to lyse exosomes (ThermoFisherScientific), containing three times the suggested concentrations of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (complete\u2122 ULTRA Tablets; MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA). These mixtures were used to measure biomarker concentrations, using a site-specific Simoa HD-1 analyzer (Quanterix, Lexington, MA), an ultrasensitive paramagnetic bead-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Coefficient of variation values were no higher than 30% for all analytes. Samples were randomized over plates, with laboratory scientists blinded to participant groups. For each sample, total and neuronal-enriched exosomal samples were run in the sample plate. All assays were run in duplicate.\n\nData processing\nAll imaging data described in the previous section were further processed using methods described.\n15\n,\n21\nSpecifically, T\n1\n- and T\n2\n-weighted MRI were used to generate cortical thickness maps; diffusion-weighted MRI was used to produce fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD) scalar images; rs-fMRI data were summarized using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), fractional ALFF (fALFF), and network correlation spatial maps; and perfusion maps were generated from first-pass gadolinium perfusion imaging. Each derived scalar image was normalized to the subject's corresponding T\n1\n-weighted image. The mapping from each T\n1\n-weighted image to a cohort-specific template\n22\nwas generated so that all data could be normalized to the same space. Image processing pipelines are described in further detail below.\nCortical thickness\nThe cortical thickness estimation pipeline\n23\nfound in the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) package (\nhttps://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs\n) was used to generate regional cortical thickness maps from the T\n1\n- and T\n2\n-weighted MRIs. The processing of each T\n1\n- and T\n2\n-weighted MR image pair includes brain extraction,\n24\nN4 bias correction,\n25\nand six-tissue (cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter, white matter, deep gray matter, brainstem, and cerebellum) segmentation,\n26\nthe latter of which were used for determining a voxel-wise estimate of cortical thickness using the DiReCT (diffeomorphic registration based cortical thickness) approach.\n27\nDiffusion-weighted imaging\nThe MRtrix suite of tools (\nhttps://github.com/MRtrix3\n) for processing diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was used for DTI reconstruction and generation of scalar images, such as FA. Pre-processing included denoising\n28\nand whole-brain extraction.\n29\nThe pre-processed DWI were then converted to tensor images,\n30\nFA, and RD maps. The average DWI was normalized to the corresponding T\n1\n-weighted MRI using ANTs registration.\n31\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging\nrs-fMRI data were processed using methods reported previously in the literature\n15\nand implemented in ANTsR (\nhttps://github.com/ANTsX/ANTsR\n). Each subject's BOLD time series was motion corrected by rigid normalization to an iteratively computed time-series spatial mean. Transformation parameters were kept for use as nuisance parameters and computation of frame-wise displacement.\n32\nFurther nuisance variable calculation included contributions from non-cortical tissue with the CompCor framework.\n33\nTransformation and CompCor nuisance variables were residualized from the BOLD signal, which was bandpass filtered (0.01\u20130.10\u2009Hz) using wavelet filtering.\n34\nFinally, fALFF\n35\nand network correlation maps\n36\nwere calculated. Canonical network coordinates were provided by the Power coordinate system.\n36\nCerebral blood flow from first pass perfusion imaging\nThe voxel-wise mean of the control images was generated and used for motion correction of all time-point volumes. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) images were generated from the motion-corrected time series using a singular value decomposition deconvolution technique.\n37\nThe arterial input function voxel mask was generated automatically\n38\nand manually inspected to ensure reasonableness of the generated results. Last, in our group-level analysis, we analyze the relative CBF by dividing each individual subject's CBF image by the global mean of CBF in the brain.\nTemplate and template mapping\nThe symmetric group-wise normalization (SyGN) strategy was used for normalizing all imaging data to a common template\n39\nfor statistical analysis. The ANTs-based symmetric normalization (SyN) algorithm\n31\nwas used to determine the correspondence between each subject's T\n1\n-weighted image and the group template.\n23\nOther modalities (e.g., mean BOLD) were aligned to the T\n1\n-weighted image using ANTs linear registration tools.\n40\nTransformation from each modality to the group template is performed by concatenating transforms such that only a single interpolation is performed. These mappings are illustrated in\nFigure 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nIllustration of the template-based processing performed for each subject. Each modality is used to produce one or more derived images (indicated by yellow arrows), which are then transformed to the group template for statistical analysis by each subject's T\n1\n-weighted image. \u201c\n\u2194\n\u201d denotes a linear mapping whereas \u201c\n\u201d denotes a diffeomorphic deformable mapping. DWI, diffusion-weighted imaging; FA, fractional anisotropy; fALFF, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations; rs-fMRI, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging; T1-w, T\n1\n-weighted; T2-w, T\n2\n-weighted. CBF, cerebral blood flow.\n\nStatistical analysis\nExposure to blast overpressure can lead to a cascade of effects that vary across scale and time. Alterations in brain structure and function, quantified through various imaging modalities, can cause metabolic, structural, and functional network-level dysfunction, thereby disrupting cognition\u2014the latter observed through self-report, clinical visits, and/or neuropsychological assessment. Concomitant vascular and inflammatory effects can be assessed through the use of fluid biomarkers. Each signal in the cascade of effects may be small, incomplete, and/or noisy, but potentially mutually overlapping in contributing to our understanding of blast effects.\nSiMLR\n41\nis a statistical technique that derives from earlier work, specifically prior-based eigenanatomy\n17\n,\n42\nand sparse canonical correlation analysis in neuroimaging (SCCAN).\n18\n,\n43\nThese techniques invert the typical analysis paradigm which performs statistical testing before voxel-wise pruning and clustering to correct for multiple comparisons as well as enforce spatial smoothness in the context of image data.\n12\nIn contrast, eigenanatomy-based techniques cluster data and reduce dimensionality as a pre-processing step before hypothesis testing. This order of operations facilitates data inspection for outliers; visualization of correlations across the extent of the brain before tests for specific outcomes or group differences is performed.\nLast, after the completion of data cleaning, one performs statistical testing on these data-derived clusters, similar to standard principal component regression,\n44\nbut for both imaging and tabular data. This is also similar in spirit to other popular frameworks such as region of interest\u2013based analysis\n45\nor tract-based spatial statistics\n46\nwith dimensionality reduction determined by specifying multiple anatomical regions, often on the order of 10\u2013100 regions. However, this anatomical simplification is not purely data derived by some optimality constraint nor do they permit formal multi-modal integration. SiMLR, in contrast, strikes a balance between defining\na priori\nregions and allowing data-driven exploratory studies of signals that are distributed across networks of variables in imaging and/or tabular formats (\nFig. 2\n). Note that all these techniques are available as open source through the ANTs software ecosystem (\nhttps://github.com/ANTsX/ANTsR\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nThe various effects observed in traumatic brain injury overlap, but the signals used for assessing the various components are often noisy, incomplete, and/or small. SiMLR leverages the covariation between imperfect data sources (along with dimensionality reduction techniques) to infer the underlying signal(s) of interest in a focused, statistically powerful way. PCA, principal component analysis; SiMLR, similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction.\nWhereas earlier SCCAN work was limited to examination of two modalities, SiMLR permits an arbitrary number of modalities and customized regularized models as input. Output consists of low-dimensional embeddings for each modality that best predict the other\nN\n\u2212\n1\ninput modalities using corresponding bases derived from matrix decomposition techniques, such as singular value decomposition or independent components analysis. For the\ni\nth modality,\nX\ni\n, this solution consists of a pair of matrices\nU\ni\n,\nV\ni\nwhere the columns of\nU\ni\ndescribe the low-dimensional bases spanning the space of\nX\ni\n, where the number of bases is a user-tuned parameter. The columns of\nV\nare the regularized, sparse representation of each modality component. These solutions are iteratively determined by, first, reconstructing each modality from the basis functions of the other modalities, that is,\nU\nj\n\u2260\ni\n, and, second, updating each modality's basis functions (\nFig. 3\n).\n47\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nIllustration of inferential design using SiMLR. Multiple modalities are projected into a regularized, low-dimensional space for linear regression analysis (similar to PCA regression). In the imaging context, for a specific modality, each of these low-dimensional projections comprise a similarly varying (across subjects) spatial region in the space of the template. DMN, default mode network; FA, fractional anisotropy; fALFF, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations; PCA, principal component analysis; RD, radial diffusivity; SiMLR, similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction.\nFor each imaging modality, this decomposition results in spatially coherent regions grouped by variation similarity across subjects in the space of the template.\nTable 1\nsummarizes the data utilized in SiMLR. Subsequent statistical analysis permits determination of statistically significant regions and visualization of these physical locations within the brain template. SiMLR processing is unsupervised and produces a low-dimensional space that jointly spans the neuroimaging data and other included modalities. Subsequent to the SiMLR-based decomposition, multiple linear regressions were performed in the low-dimensional space for each modality basis. Specifically, we perform regressions of the form:\nTable 1.\nSummary of the Various Data Used in the SiMLR Statistical Framework\nDemographics\n\u2022\u2002Age\n\u2022\u2002Education\n\u2022\u2002Number of breaches (last year)\n\u2022\u2002Number of breaches (career)\nNeuroimaging\n\u2022\u2002Structural\n\u25cb Cortical thickness (by T1-/T2-w MRI)\n\u25cb FA (by DWI)\n\u25cb Radial diffusivity (by DWI)\n\u2022\u2002Functional\n\u25cb fALFF (by rs-fMRI)\n\u25cb default mode network (by rs-fMRI)\n\u25cb \u03b2 (perfusion, by gadolinium-enhanced contrast)\nPsychometric batteries\n\u2022\u2002Wechsler Test of Adult Reading\n\u2022\u2002Wechsler Memory Scale\n\u2022\u2002Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence\n\u2022\u2002Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test\n\u2022\u2002Immediate Post Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing\n\u2022\u2002Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM4)\n\u2022\u2002Booklet Category Test\n\u2022\u2002Delis Kaplan Executive Functioning- Sorting Test\nFluid biomarkers (exosome)\n\u2022\u2002Inflammation\n\u25cb Interleukin-6\n\u25cb Interleukin-10\n\u25cb Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1\n\u2022\u2002Neural injury\n\u25cb Neurofilament light\n\u25cb Tau\n\u25cb A\u03b242\nOpen in a separate window\nAlthough not all data collected were used, a selection encompassing the various aspects of effects observed in traumatic brain injury were selected.\nSiMLR, similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction; T1-w, T\n1\n-weighted; T2-w, T\n2\n-weighted; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; FA, fractional anisotropy; DWI, diffusion-weighted imaging; fALFF, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation; rs-fMRI, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging; A\u03b242, beta-amyloid 42.\nTable 2.\nDemographic Summary of the Experienced Breacher and Control Cohorts\nBreacher (\nN\n=\u200920)\nControl (\nN\n=\u200914)\nAge, years\n39.65 (26\u201354)\n38.85 (27\u201353)\nEthnicity\n\u2022\u2002Caucasian\u2009=\u200917\n\u2022\u2002American Indian\u2009=\u20091\n\u2022\u2002Asian\u2009=\u20091\n\u2022\u2002Other\u2009=\u20091\n\u2022\u2002Caucasian\u2009=\u200912\n\u2022\u2002African American\u2009=\u20091\n\u2022\u2002Asian\u2009=\u20091\nHandedness\nRight\u2009=\u200918; left\u2009=\u20092\nRight\u2009=\u200912; left\u2009=\u20092\nService\n\u2022\u2002Army\u2009=\u200913\n\u2022\u2002Navy\u2009=\u20091\n\u2022\u2002Law enforcement\u2009=\u20096\n\u2022\u2002Army\u2009=\u200910\n\u2022\u2002Law enforcement\u2009=\u20094\nDuration of service\n16.8 (8\u201327)\n13.8 (5\u201324)\nPost-Traumatic Checklist\u2013Military (PCL-M)\n20.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.7 (17\u201330) with 0 subjects >44 (PTSD cutoff)\n25.6\u2009\u00b1\u20097.1 (17\u201340) with 0 subjects >44 (PTSD cutoff)\nConcussion\nYes\u2009=\u200913; no\u2009=\u20097\nYes\u2009=\u20096; no\u2009=\u20098\nTotal blast exposures\n\u2022\u20024628 (100\u201334,800)\n3 (0\u201335)\nBreaches in past year\n\u2022\u2002>400\u2009=\u20093\n\u2022\u2002200\u2013399\u2009=\u20095\n\u2022\u2002100\u2013199\u2009=\u20093\n\u2022\u200240\u201399\u2009=\u20091\n\u2022\u200210\u201339\u2009=\u20092\n\u2022\u20021\u20139\u2009=\u20094\n\u2022\u2002None\u2009=\u200914\nOpen in a separate window\nPTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder.\n<\ni\nt\na\nl\ni\nc\n>\nU\ni\n,\nl\n\u223c\nA\ng\ne\n+\nE\nd\nu\nc\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n+\nB\nr\na\ni\nn\nV\no\nl\nu\nm\ne\n+\nG\nr\no\nu\np\n<\n\u2215\ni\nt\na\nl\ni\nc\n>\nwhere\ni\ndenotes the modality and\nl\ndenotes the\nl\nt\nh\nbasis vector.

    "Methods": "Study design\nThe study utilized data collected from enrolled participants in the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry (RHSCIR) from July 2004 to February 2017. The RHSCIR prospectively enrolls adults admitted with a new acute spine trauma with SCI to any of the participating 18 acute and 13 rehabilitation facilities across Canada. The registry was initiated in 2004 to answer\na priori\nresearch questions and facilitate implementation of best practices. All RHSCIR sites obtained local research ethics board approval before enrolling participants, and data-sharing agreements were in place with each site. A core data set is collected on all RHSCIR participants, and a detailed data set is collected on participants who can be approached during their hospital stay and provide informed consent. For the purposes of this study, only participants who had a final complete registry record were included in the analysis. Details on the RHSCIR data set have been described elsewhere.\n16\n\nAnalysis cohort\nThe study cohort included persons identified as having cauda equina injuries (i.e., lower motor neuron injuries attributable to damage to nerve roots below the conus medullaris level) at admission, with any degree of neurological impairment after spine trauma (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale [AIS] A to D) and single neurological level of injury (NLI) from L1 to S3 at admission to a RHSCIR acute facility, as assessed using the International Standards for the Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI).\n17\n\nStudy variables\nBaseline factors included age, sex, and pre-existing medical comorbidities at the time of injury based on the Charlson Comorbidity Index.\n18\nInjury factors included mechanism of injury and neurological parameters, including injury severity (AIS A, B, C, or D), NLI (L1, L2, or L3\u2013S3), and voluntary anal contraction (VAC; present, absent) obtained from an ISNCSCI examination at acute admission. These groupings of NLI were determined by clinical expertise and number of cases in each cell in the contingency table. Management factors included time from injury to arriving at a RHSCIR acute facility (hours), surgical or non-surgical treatment of the spine trauma, and, where applicable, time from injury to surgery (hours) and surgical approach (anterior, posterior, anterior and posterior). Acute and rehabilitation lengths of stay (LOSs) and rehabilitation onset (time from injury to admission to rehabilitation care) were also reported.\n\nOutcome variables\nOutcome measures of the study were motor score, and recovery in walking ability, and bowel and bladder function. Motor score outcome was defined by both lower-extremity motor score (LEMS) at discharge and improvement in LEMS between acute admission and discharge from care (i.e., from acute if not attending rehabilitation or from rehabilitation for those attending). The LEMS is obtained from the ISNCSCI examination and has a maximum score of 50. Recovery in the walking ability was defined as regaining walking ability at discharge as assessed using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM\u00ae)\n*\nand the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM III\n19\n). Ability to walk was considered for a score of 6 or 7 (modified/complete independence) on the FIM \u201clocomotion\u201d item for those who reported \u201cwalk\u201d or \u201cboth\u201d as the locomotion mode or a SCIM score of 4\u20138 (4, walks with a walking frame or crutches [swing]; 5, walks with crutches or two canes [reciprocal walking]; 6, walks with one cane; 7, needs leg orthosis only; and 8, walks without walking aids) on the SCIM \u201cmobility for moderate distances\u201d item. Using both FIM and SCIM data was to increase the sample size, and these items have been mapped for their equivalency.\n20\nRecovery in bowel and bladder function was defined as improvement in respective bowel and bladder score in the FIM \u201csphincter control\u201d subscore between rehabilitation admission and discharge. A score <7 in the FIM \u201csphincter control\u201d subscore was also used to describe dysfunction or dependence in the management of bowel and bladder. Only FIM was used because the equivalency of the SCIM has yet to be validated with the FIM on sphincter control.\nFor greater clarity, data on LEMS and VAC were collected upon admission to a RHSCIR acute facility and again at discharge from care, which could be from acute if not attending rehabilitation or from rehabilitation if attending, but not both. For FIM data, patients who did not attend rehabilitation had their FIM data collected upon acute discharge only and therefore cannot be used to calculate change in FIM scores; those who attended rehabilitation had both FIM and SCIM data collected at admission and discharge. No SCIM data were collected at acute discharge.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to describe the demographics, number of comorbidities, mechanism of injury, and management strategies in the cohort. Bivariate analysis was performed to compare the outcome variables between patients with different neurological injury (AIS A/B vs. AIS C/D; L1 vs. L2 vs. L3\u2013S3) to determine associations between injury and outcomes of interest. Bivariate analysis was also performed comparing patients who had early rehabilitation onset and those who had late onset using the median rehabilitation onset (24 days) as a cutoff to explore for any potential sampling bias. The groups were compared using either\nt\n-test (analysis of variance for more than two categories) or Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Kruskal-Wallis' test for more than two categories) for normally distributed versus non-normally distributed continuous variables, respectively. To determine correlation between VAC and recovery in bowel and bladder function, two comparisons were performed: Patients who had VAC at acute admission were compared to those with no reported VAC, and patients who had gained VAC by discharge from care were compared to those who still did not have VAC. Comparisons between the two categorical variables were assessed using a chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test if the expected cell counts were five or less). Sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine any discrepancy between patients who had data on change in bowel and bladder score and those who had missing data.\nMulti-variable analysis was performed to determine factors associated with the outcomes of interest (walking ability using logistic regression; LEMS at discharge and bowel and bladder function recovery using linear regression). Factors examined were age at time of injury, sex, neurological injury severity, NLI, time from injury to surgery, rehabilitation onset, and rehabilitation LOS; in addition, LEMS at acute admission was also included for LEMS at discharge and VAC at acute admission for bowel and bladder function recovery. Step-wise variable selection methods (\np\nvalues for a variable to enter and stay in the model set to 0.30 and 0.10, respectively) were applied to all regression models. A final model for each outcome obtained had included the significant predictors from step-wise variable selection, as well as injury severity, NLI, and time from injury to surgery, given that these variables were deemed clinically relevant regardless of their significance.\nPatients who had complete data on the variables considered were included in the multi-variable analysis, except for the model for walking ability where patients who were walking at rehabilitation admission were excluded from the model given that the goal was to determine factors for walking recovery. Goodness-of-fit tests were performed for all models, and the Akaike Information Criterion was used for model selection. Associations with a\np\nvalue <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SAS software (Version 9.4 of the SAS System for Windows, copyright \u00a9 2013; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nA total of 180 rats were used for these experiments. Female Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, Raleigh, NC, USA) weighing 175\u2013200\u2009g on arrival were used for all alcohol-drinking and behavioral studies. Rats weighing 250\u2013300\u2009g on arrival were used for slice electrophysiology experiments. All rats that underwent TBI weighed 250\u2013300\u2009g at time of injury and were approximately 4 months old. Rats were pair-housed in temperature- and humidity-controlled rooms with a 12:12\u2009h reverse light-dark cycle and\nad libitum\naccess to standard rat chow and water. Upon arrival, rats were allowed to acclimate to the colony room for 1 week before experiments began, during which time rats were handled daily. All experiments were conducted in the dark cycle, between 7:00AM and 5:00PM. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center and were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nOperant alcohol self-administration\nFor experiments 1 and 2, rats (\nn\n=\u200950, Expt. 1;\nn\n=\u200935, Expt. 2) were trained to orally self-administer alcohol (10% w/v) or water as previously described except that self-administration sessions occurred only 3 times per week for the last 3 weeks prior to craniotomy.\n41\nAccess was permitted in a two-lever contingency (water vs. alcohol) on a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) schedule, in which one lever press resulted in delivery of 0.1\u2009mL of water or alcohol. Upon stabilization of operant responding in 30-min sessions, rats were counterbalanced into Sham and TBI groups based on baseline alcohol intake (average intake in final four sessions before surgery). In a subset of rats, blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) were measured at baseline to ensure animals were consuming alcohol. Immediately following the penultimate operant drinking session prior to TBI, 500\u2009\u03bcL of tail blood was collected via a small incision and analyzed using an Analox machine according to manufacturer's instructions (Analox Instruments USA, Lunenburg, MA, USA). Rats used for behavioral experiments completed five operant drinking sessions every other day for 10 days post-TBI (days 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 post-TBI). Alcohol-na\u00efve animals (\nn\n=\u200945, Expt. 1;\nn\u2009=\n32, Expt. 2) were handled during the operant self-administration training period.\n\nTraumatic brain injury via lateral fluid percussion\nAll animals received a 5-mm in diameter craniotomy above the left sensorimotor cortex (from bregma: anteroposterior [AP]: \u22122\u2009mm, mediolateral [ML]: \u22123\u2009mm) and were allowed 2 to 3 days to recover before undergoing TBI via lateral fluid percussion (\u223c2 atm; Fluid Percussion Injury (FPI), Model 01-B; Custom Design and Fabrication, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA) or sham procedures as previously described.\n7\nAnimals in the Sham group were anesthetized and received craniotomy but were not subjected to TBI (surgical controls). Immediately following the TBI or sham procedures, animals were disconnected from the FPI device and anesthesia, and apnea duration, respiratory rate, and latency to righting reflex were measured. TBI animals that did not show a physical reaction to the injury, apnea, or latency to righting reflex of at least 4\u2009min were excluded from subsequent experimentation and analyses. A total of eight animals were excluded based on these criteria.\n\nElevated plus maze\nAnimals that were used for behavioral experiments were tested for anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) 9 days after TBI (\nn\u2009=\n56; Expt. 1,\nTable 1\n), 24\u2009h after their previous alcohol-drinking session such that BACs would be zero at the time of testing. Prior to testing, animals were allowed to acclimate to the testing room for at least 30\u2009min. Testing occurred 3\u20136\u2009h into the dark cycle. For testing, rats were individually placed in the center of the EPM facing one of the open arms and allowed 5\u2009min to explore the maze in a dimly lit (\u223c12 lux) room. A video camera mounted on the ceiling directly above the EPM apparatus transmitted video to a computer in the laboratory and recorded each test. Entries into and out of open and closed arms were counted once all four paws crossed the arm threshold. The percentage of total time spent in the open arms, calculated as open arm time (sec)/[open arm time (sec) + closed arm time (sec)]*100, was used as the primary index of anxiety-like behavior, where decreases in percent open arm time reflect increases in anxiety-like behavior. The number of closed arm entries was used as a measure of overall locomotor activity. Animals that fell off the maze (\nn\u2009=\n3; 1 Sham, 2 TBI) were excluded from analysis.\nTable 1.\nExperimental Groups, Conditions, and Outcomes\nGroups\nTreatment\nOutcome measures\nExperiment 1\nAlcohol-na\u00efve Sham\nCraniotomy\nPost-TBI physiological measures, alcohol SA (drinkers), EPM, BLA eCB proteins\nAlcohol-na\u00efve TBI\nCraniotomy, TBI\nAlcohol-drinking Sham\nOperant conditioning, craniotomy\nAlcohol-drinking TBI\nOperant conditioning, craniotomy, TBI\nExperiment 2\nAlcohol-na\u00efve Sham\nCraniotomy\nPost-TBI physiological measures, BLA eCB levels\nAlcohol-na\u00efve TBI\nCraniotomy, TBI\nAlcohol-drinking Sham\nOperant conditioning, craniotomy\nAlcohol-drinking TBI\nOperant conditioning, craniotomy, TBI\nExperiment 3\nAlcohol-na\u00efve Sham\nCraniotomy\nBLA slice electrophysiology\nAlcohol-na\u00efve TBI\nCraniotomy, TBI\nOpen in a separate window\nBLA, basolateral amygdala; eCB, endocannabinoid; EPM, elevated plus maze; SA, self-administration; TBI, traumatic brain injury.\n\nEndocannabinoid measurements\nA separate cohort of animals was used to quantify amygdala eCBs after alcohol drinking and TBI (Expt. 2,\nTable 1\n). After completing alcohol self-administration training or control handling treatment, animals (\nn\u2009=\n60) were sacrificed at 1\u2009h or 11 days post-TBI via decapitation under deep isoflurane anesthesia, and brains were excised, flash-frozen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Bilateral BLA punches were obtained from 0.5-mm frozen coronal brain slices. Weighed BLA samples were placed into borosilicate glass culture tubes containing 2\u2009mL of acetonitrile and 675\u2009pg of [\n2\nH\n8\n]AEA and 8100\u2009pg of [\n2\nH\n8\n]2-AG. Tissue was homogenized with a glass rod and sonicated on ice for 2\u2009h. Samples were incubated overnight at \u221220\u00b0C to precipitate proteins. Samples were centrifuged at 1500\ng\n, and supernatants were removed to a new glass tube and evaporated to dryness under N\n2\ngas. The samples were resuspended in 500\u2009\u03bcL of methanol to recapture any lipids adhering to the glass tube, and dried again. Finally, lipid extracts were suspended in 30\u2009\u03bcL of methanol.\nFollowing preparation, the concentrations of eCBs (AEA and 2-AG) were quantified in 5\u2009\u03bcL of the methanol extract using stable isotope-dilution, electrospray ionization liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry of the daughter ions (LC-ESI-MS-MS). Standard curves were generated for 2-AG (10\u20138500\u2009pg/\u03bcL), AEA (0.2\u2013170\u2009pg/\u03bcL), and internal standards [\n2\nH\n8\n]-AEA (150\u2009pg/\u03bcL) and [\n2\nH\n8\n]-2-AG (1800\u2009pg/\u03bcL). Concentrations of the analytes were determined from standard curves of the area ratios (standard/analyte) versus the concentration ratios (standard/analyte); [\n2\nH\n8\n]-AEA was used as the standard for AEA, whereas [\n2\nH\n8\n]-2-AG was used for 2-AG. During extraction, 2-AG partially isomerizes to 1(3)-arachidonoylglycerol and is therefore detected and analyzed as a double peak.\n42\nThe area ratios for all analytes in all samples fell within their respective standard curves.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nAnimals in behavioral experiments (Expt. 1) were sacrificed by decapitation under deep isoflurane anesthesia 11 days post-TBI (24\u2009h after completing behavioral testing), and brains were removed, flash-frozen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing for western analysis as previously described.\n43\nBilateral BLA punches were obtained from 0.5-mm frozen coronal brain slices and homogenized by sonication in lysis buffer (320\u2009mM sucrose, 5\u2009mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethane sulfonic acid [HEPES], 1\u2009mM egtazic acid [EGTA], 1\u2009mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], and 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate [SDS], with protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 2 and 3 diluted 1:100; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and 15-\u03bcg protein samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4\u201320% gradient acrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) before transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, USA).\nMembranes were blocked then incubated in primary antibody overnight against DAGL\u03b1 (diluted 1:1000 in 2.5% non-fat milk; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), DAGL\u03b2 (diluted 1:1000 in 2.5% non-fat milk; Cell Signaling), MAGL (diluted 1:1000 in 2.5% non-fat milk; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), CB1R (diluted 1:500 in 2.5% non-fat milk; Cayman Chemical), or \u03b2-tubulin (diluted 1:1,000,000 in 2.5% non-fat milk; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA). Membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000; Bio-Rad) for 1\u2009h at room temperature and chemiluminescence was detected (Immobilon Crescendo Western HRP Substrate; Millipore Sigma). Immunoreactivity was quantified using ImageJ, and the ratio of proteins of interest to \u03b2-tubulin for each sample was calculated for normalization and statistical comparison.\n\nSlice electrophysiology\nA third cohort of alcohol-na\u00efve animals (\nn\u2009=\n18) were used for post-TBI electrophysiological measurements in the BLA (Expt. 3; see\nTable 1\n). Brain slice preparation, intrinsic property measurements, and assessment of action potential generation properties were performed as previously described.\n44\nRecordings were obtained from pyramidal neurons of the BLA ipsilateral to the site of injury. Pyramidal neurons were identified based on their cell body size and pyramidal-like somatic morphology.\n45\n,\n46\nSynaptic properties\nTo collect data regarding pre- and post-synaptic alterations resulting from TBI, spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs, sIPSCs) were recorded. When whole cell recording configuration was established, the voltage was clamped at \u221270\u2009mV (for sEPSCs) or \u221250\u2009mV (for sIPSCs) and 5\u2009min of spontaneous post-synaptic current was recorded. Spontaneous post-synaptic events were detected in these recordings by thresholding rapid excursions in current; the average event amplitude and mean frequency over the 5-min recording period were quantified.\nDepolarization-induced suppression of excitation/inhibition\nTo measure eCB signaling post-TBI, DSE and DSI were assessed. The frequency of sEPSCs and sIPSCs were measured before and after a 10-sec depolarizing voltage step. The clamped voltage was stepped from \u221270\u2009mV (for sEPSCs) or \u221250\u2009mV (for sIPSCs) to 0\u2009mV during the depolarization phase. The %DSE and %DSI were calculated by %DSE/I\u2009=\u2009(1 \u2013 post-depolarization sPSC frequency/pre-depolarization sPSC frequency)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). Data were tested for normality using the D'Agostino and Pearson normality test and analyzed with two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA; post-TBI alcohol self-administration), two-tailed\nt\ntests (injury pressure, electrophysiological measures), Mann-Whitney test (resting membrane potential [RMP], sEPSC amplitude; non-Gaussian distributions) or with two-way between subjects ANOVA where factors were injury (Sham vs. TBI) and alcohol history (drinking vs. na\u00efve). Significant interactions (\np\n<\u20090.05) were followed up by post hoc analysis with Tukey's multiple comparisons test. Pearson's correlation analysis was used for variables with Gaussian distributions and Spearman's correlation analysis was used for variables with non-Gaussian distributions. Outliers for dependent variables were identified with the generalized extreme Studentized deviate test and excluded from analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 7 software (Graphpad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA)."

For this study, 10 pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were obtained at E15 (Charles River Laboratories) and maintained on a 12/12\u2009h light/dark cycle with food and water\nad libitum\n. The pups were born in the facility and the day of birth was designated as post-natal day 0 (P0). Dams with litters were left undisturbed until P2, and litter size was culled to 10 pups to ensure standardized nutrition, and culled to an equal number of pups for each sex when possible. Dams produced a range of four to eight males per litter (median six males/litter). At P21, pups were weaned, and only males were used. A total of 47 male rats were used in this study (\nn\n=\u200913 Sham + Control [Ctl],\nn\n=\u200912 Sham + ELS,\nn\n=\u200911 TBI + Ctl,\nn\n=\u200911 TBI + ELS rats).

All rats were socially housed until surgery.\n\nSurgical procedures\nAt P60, male rats were\na priori\nrandomized to receive either parasagittal mild to moderate fluid-percussion injury (\nFPI\n) or sham surgery as described previously.\n44\nAnesthesia was induced with 3% isoflurane, 70% N\n2\nO, and 30% O\n2\n, and animals were maintained with 1\u20132% isoflurane, 70% N\n2\nO, and 30% O\n2\n. A 4.8\u2009mm craniotomy (-3.8\u2009mm bregma, 2.5\u2009mm lateral) was prepared by trephination over the right parietal cortex, and an 18 gauge syringe hub was secured to the craniotomy window with cyanoacrylate and dental cement. At 16\u201318\u2009h after the craniotomy surgery, the animals were re-anesthetized (induction with 3% isoflurane, 70% N\n2\nO, and 30% O\n2\nand maintained with 1\u20132% isoflurane, 70% N\n2\nO, and 30% O\n2\n), intubated, and mechanically ventilated (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). A catheter was placed in the tail artery to monitor mean arterial blood pressure (MABP). Arterial blood samples were obtained to measure blood gases (\np\nO\n2\nand\np\nCO\n2\n) and blood pH. After stabilization of physiological parameters, animals received a mild to moderate parasagittal FPI (1.4\u20131.6 atm) or sham injury. Penicillin/benzathine (20,000 IU/kg, intramuscular) was given once prior to the brain injury surgery, and buprenorphine (0.01\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneously) was given once at the completion of the surgery. Physiological variables of MABP, blood\np\nO\n2\n,\np\nCO\n2\n, pH, and head and body temperature were controlled throughout the surgery (\nTable 1\n). A significant interaction of animal treatment\u2009\u00d7\u2009time was observed for\np\nO\n2\n(\nF\n[3,43]\n=\u20093.91,\np\n=\u20090.015), with a slight decrease observed in all animal treatment groups at the end of surgery. Additionally, a significant main effect of time was observed for\np\nCO\n2\n(\nF\n[1,43]\n=\u200942.39,\np\n<\u20090.001) and pH (\nF\n[1,43]\n=\u200913.92,\np\n<\u20090.001). However, blood\np\nO\n2\n,\np\nCO\n2\n, and pH remained within normal physiological ranges throughout the duration of the surgery for all animal treatment groups.\nA priori\nexclusion criteria were: mortality, >15% loss of body weight, non-resolving infection at a surgical site, inability to feed or drink, motor paralysis, listlessness, self-mutilation, excessive grooming leading to loss of dermal layers, excessive spontaneous vocalization when touched, or poor grooming habits.\n45\nFor the first 2 days following surgery, animals were monitored daily, then weighed and evaluated every 2 weeks until decapitation or perfusion. As expected, there was a main effect of time for body weight (\nF\n[1,42]\n=\u20091984.34,\np\n<\u20090.001), with all animal treatment groups having a significant weight gain at the time of perfusion compared with the start of surgery. There were no significant differences in body weight among non-stressed and ELS animals at the time of surgery (P60) or at the time of perfusion (P120).\nTable 1.\nPhysiological Data\nParameter\nTreatment\nAt surgery\nAt perfusion\nParameter\nTreatment\n15\u2009min prior to FPI\n15\u2009min post-FPI\nWeight\n***\n(gm)\nSham+Ctl\n382.6\u2009\u00b1\u20099.5\n558.0\u2009\u00b1\u200915.5\nMABP (mmHg)\nSham+Ctl\n120.3\u2009\u00b1\u20097.3\n124.9\u2009\u00b1\u20097.4\nSham+ELS\n407.0\u2009\u00b1\u200917.2\n600.7\u2009\u00b1\u200928.6\nSham+ELS\n126.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7\n126.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\nTBI+ Ctl\n399.5\u2009\u00b1\u200923.5\n564.0\u2009\u00b1\u200925.0\nTBI+Ctl\n144.9\u2009\u00b1\u20097.8\n134.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\nTBI+ELS\n385.0\u2009\u00b1\u200916.0\n568.8\u2009\u00b1\u200927.5\nTBI+ELS\n124.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2\n105.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1\nATM\nSham+Ctl\nN/A\nN/A\nBlood\np\nO\n2\n(mmHg)\nSham+Ctl\n143.0\u2009\u00b1\u200911.7\n135.2\u2009\u00b1\u200911.9\n*\nSham+ELS\nN/A\nN/A\nSham+ELS\n162.0\u2009\u00b1\u20099.6\n146.0\u2009\u00b1\u200912.1\n***\nTBI+Ctl\n1.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\nN/A\nTBI+Ctl\n159.5\u2009\u00b1\u200913.5\n132.5\u2009\u00b1\u200917.5\n***\nTBI+ELS\n1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0\nN/A\nTBI+ELS\n164.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0\n146.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\n***\nParameter\nTreatment\n15\u2009min prior to FPI\n15\u2009min post-FPI\nParameter\nTreatment\n15\u2009min prior to FPI\n15\u2009min post-FPI\nBlood\np\nCO\n2\n***\n(mmHg)\nSham+Ctl\n40.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\n39.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\nHead temperature (\u00b0C)\nSham+Ctl\n36.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0\n36.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0\nSham+ELS\n39.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\n38.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\nSham+ELS\n36.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\n36.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0\nTBI+Ctl\n38.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2\n38.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9\nTBI+Ctl\n36.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\n36.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\nTBI+ELS\n38.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9\n37.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\nTBI+ELS\n36.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0\n36.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\nBlood pH\n***\nSham+Ctl\n7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0\n7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0\nBody temperature (\u00b0C)\nSham+Ctl\n36.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0\n36.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\nSham+ELS\n7.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0\n7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0\nSham+ELS\n36.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\n36.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\nTBI+Ctl\n7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0\n7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0\nTBI+Ctl\n36.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0\n36.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\nTBI+ELS\n7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0\n7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0\nTBI+ELS\n36.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\n36.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\nOpen in a separate window\n*\np\n<\u20090.05,\n***\np\n<\u20090.001 versus time at surgery or 15\u2009min prior to fluid-percussion injury (FPI), repeated measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) post-hoc test.

At 24\u2009h after habituation, animals were fear conditioned by pairing a tone (75 dB, 2.8\u2009kHz, 30\u2009sec) with a modest foot shock (1\u2009mA, 1\u2009sec) occurring at 120\u2009sec, and then the animals remained in the apparatus for an additional 60\u2009sec. The total duration of the training trial was 3\u2009min. Contextual fear conditioning was assessed at 24\u2009h as well as at 1 month after training, with a 5\u2009min trial duration. Freezing was quantified by video analysis (Freeze Frame 3.32, Coulbourn Instruments, Holliston, MA).\n\nWater maze\nAt 3 weeks post-surgery, water maze training and testing were performed.\n46\nThe animals were trained over the course of 4 acquisition days to find a hidden platform in a constant location (four trials/day, 4\u2009min inter-trial interval, 1\u2009min maximum trial duration). Retention was assessed with a probe trial (1\u2009min duration) at 24\u2009h after the last acquisition day. Performance was assessed through video tracking and analysis (EthoVision XT 11.5, Noldus Information Technology, Leesburg, VA). Path length to reach the platform and time spent in each quadrant of the pool were quantified.\n\nSpatial working memory\nAt 4 weeks post-surgery, animals were assessed for spatial working memory. This was performed for 2 days using a delayed match-to-sample task in the water maze.\n46\nAnimals were trained to locate a hidden platform in the water maze that remained constant between two paired trials separated by 5\u2009sec (1\u2009min maximum trial duration). Four paired trials were averaged (4\u2009min inter-trial interval). Animals were video tracked and path length differences between the first sample trial and subsequent match trial were measured (EthoVision XT 11.5). Data shown are from day 2 of testing.\n\nHistology\nAt 8 weeks post-surgery, animals were anesthetized (3% isoflurane, 70% N\n2\nO, 30% O\n2\n, 5\u2009min) and transcardially perfused with saline and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The brains were embedded in paraffin and sectioned in a stereological series (10\u2009\u03bcm thick, 150\u2009\u03bcm apart) using a microtome (Leica RM2125 RTS, Buffalo Grove, IL) as previously described.\n47\nSections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) plus Luxol fast blue. Using NeuroLucida software (11.11.2, MicroBrightField) the ipsilateral and contralateral parietal cortex and hippocampus were contoured between bregma levels -3.3 to -6.8\u2009mm. Atrophy was evaluated by quantifying and comparing contralateral and ipsilateral volume differences and normalizing to the contralateral volume.\n\nCorticosterone measurements\nAt 8 weeks post-surgery, a separate set of animals that did not undergo behavioral testing were assessed for basal and stress-induced corticosterone levels in blood serum. Animals received 30\u2009min of restraint stress by immobilization in Plexiglas tubes. Plasma from the tail vein was obtained from animals, and corticosterone was measured using ELISA (Enzo Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). Baseline levels prior to restraint, immediately after 30\u2009min of restraint, and 90\u2009min after recovery from restraint were compared.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData presented are mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM) and significance was designated at\np\n<\u20090.05. Statistical comparisons were made using GraphPad Prism 7.0 and SigmaPlot 14.0. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two-way ANOVA were used to determine significance between the factors animal treatment\u2009\u00d7\u2009trial/day/quadrant/time or animal surgery\u2009\u00d7\u2009stress treatment. Tukey's post-hoc tests were used when significant interactions were present. A Student's\nt\ntest was used to analyze atmospheres of pressure (ATM) levels between TBI+Ctl and TBI+ELS animal groups."

    "Methods": "Subjects and study design\nSubjects with TBI (GCS 3\u201315) were identified and enrolled prospectively in the TRACK-TBI study (TRACK-TBI;\nClinicalTrials.gov:\nNCT02119182) as previously described.\n16\n,\n17\nSubjects presenting to one of 18 participating level I United States trauma centers were enrolled from February 26, 2014 to July 27, 2018. The TRACK-TBI Phase 1 Biomarker Cohort (\nn\n=\u20091497) evaluated in this study was a pre-specified interim analysis that included the first half of the enrolled TBI subjects and controls (see subsequent text and\nFig. 1\n). The study was approved by the institutional review board of each enrolling site. Written informed consent was obtained from subjects or their legal authorized representatives (LAR). Eligibility criteria included presentation within 24\u2009h of injury with head trauma warranting clinical evaluation with a non-contrast head CT evaluation based on the 2008 American College of Emergency Physicians/Centers for Disease Control (ACEP/CDC) guidelines for neuroimaging and decision making in TBI.\n18\nSubjects were eligible for inclusion as orthopedic trauma controls if they presented with isolated trauma to their limbs, pelvis, and/or ribs, and had an Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) <4 for those body regions. Orthopedic trauma controls subjects were identified and enrolled using the same process as that for patients with TBI, except for the head CT requirement. Subjects were ineligible for enrollment as orthopedic trauma controls if they had loss of consciousness (LOC), disturbance of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia (PTA)/retrograde amnesia, or other clinical findings suggestive of a brain injury.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nConsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram of subjects from the prospective Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study included in current analysis.\n\nClinical data collection\nDemographic and clinical data, including GCS, source of trauma, LOC, and TBI diagnostic criteria were obtained at the time of initial evaluation by a treating physician and further confirmed by study staff through structured medical record review and subject or LAR interview when consent was obtained and blood samples collected.\n\nSample collection and biomarker analysis\nBlood samples were collected from subjects who consented to genetic and proteomic analysis within a 24\u2009h window from time of injury. All samples were dated and time stamped to confirm collection within the protocol's window. The TBI-Common Data Elements (CDE) Biospecimens and Biomarkers Working Group Guidelines for plasma preparation were followed (\nwww.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/TBI.aspx\n). For detailed methods see TRACK-TBI Biorepository Manual of Procedures (\nhttps://tracktbi.ucsf.edu/sites/tracktbi.ucsf.edu/files/V4%20TRACK-TBI%20Biospecimens%20SOP%205%20MAY%202016.pdf\n). Samples were centrifuged and aliquots stored at -80\u00b0C for future batch processing. Sample storage occurred within 2\u2009h of blood draw. Samples were batch-shipped as temperature-controlled express freight to the TRACK-TBI Biospecimen Repository at the University of Pittsburgh. All samples were stored in a de-identified manner, with a unique study number specific to site and subject. A central database was maintained by the coordinating center (University of California at San Francisco [UCSF]) with each site entering site-specific data for final statistical reporting.\nSample analyses for GFAP and S100B were conducted in a blinded fashion. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma was thawed in batches at room temperature and centrifuged at 10,000 rcf for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C prior to testing. GFAP concentrations were determined using prototype immunoassays on the i-STAT point-of-care platform (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). The i-STAT GFAP test uses the sandwich ELISA method with electrochemical detection of the resulting enzyme signal, which was optimized for plasma. The test time for each assay is <15\u2009min. All samples were tested neat, without dilution, in duplicate. Samples reading greater than the calibration range were reported as greater than the reportable range and were not diluted.\nThe GFAP assay utilizes a monoclonal antibody for capture and a monoclonal antibody/alkaline phosphatase conjugate for detection of GFAP and GFAP breakdown products (BDPs). The GFAP calibrators range from 0 to 50,000\u2009pg/mL. The limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) protocol EP17-A2\ni\n, are <15\u2009pg/mL and <25\u2009pg/mL, respectively. Within-laboratory precision of 2.8\u201314.2% coefficient of variation (CV) was demonstrated over a concentration range of 15,000\u201340\u2009pg/mL. Evaluation of assay linearity demonstrates <10% deviation from linearity from 50,000 to <25\u2009pg/mL, as defined by CLSI protocol EP6-A.\n19\nIn the analysis, when values were below the LoD, original values were used. Values >50,000\u2009pg/mL were imputed as 50,000\u2009pg/mL in the analysis.\nSample analysis for S100B was conducted by a single laboratory (University College of Dublin), in blinded fashion using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys\n\u00ae\nS100B; Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) on an automated Cobas\n\u00ae\nsystem from Roche. Serum samples were thawed in batches at room temperature and centrifuged at 10,000 rcf for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C prior to testing in duplicate. This assay is the trademarked assay used clinically in Europe for S100B (LoD: <0.005 ug/L; LoQ: not available per package insert; CV: intermediate precision of 20%), which was optimized for serum. The full package insert is available publicly at\nhttps://diagnostics.roche.com/no/en/products/params/elecsys-s100.html\n.\n\nCT scan evaluation\nAs noted, eligible subjects had undergone a non-contrast head CT upon arrival in the ED as a part of their trauma evaluation in the clinical setting, and not specifically for research purposes. In the United States, the vast majority of clinical institutions follow the guidance set forth by the 2008 ACEP/CDC guidelines for neuroimaging and decision making in TBI.\n18\nThese CT scans were de-identified and uploaded to a central imaging database and then were graded based on recommendations of the neuroimaging working group of the TBI-CDE.\n20\n,\n21\nEach reviewer was blinded to the identity and clinical information associated with a given CT scan. Head CT scans were classified as positive or negative based on the presence or absence of traumatic intracranial abnormalities (e.g., subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, contusion).\n\nStatistical analysis\nDemographics, clinical characteristics, and biomarker data were summarized and compared between TBI patients and orthopedic trauma controls, as well as among TBI patients with positive versus negative CT scans. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for comparing continuous variables; Fisher's exact test was used for comparing categorical variables. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine whether GFAP can be used as a diagnostic tool for predicting head CT scan abnormality. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and was compared with the AUC of S100B from the same patient sample via the bootstrap. The K-fold cross-validation method was used to select the optimal GFAP cutoff points for predicting CT abnormality based on the criteria of adjusted negative predictive value (NPV) reaching levels of 0.9, 0.92, 0.95, and 0.98. The prevalence rate for the adjusted NPV was estimated from the sample; 1000 bootstraps were conducted to determine the overall optimal cutoff using the median from each run. Then, the optimal cutoff points were applied to the full data to calculate the corresponding sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and positive predictive value (PPV).\nP\nvalues <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was conducted in R, version 3.5.1 (R Core Team, 2013) by central study statisticians."

    "Methods": "Animal model of traumatic brain injury\nA well-characterized RNR pig TBI model\n30\u201334\nwas used to produce a single rapid sagittal or axial head rotation causing purely inertial TAI. This TBI model produces unconsciousness, sustained cognitive dysfunction, and bilateral diffuse axonal and hemorrhagic injury.\nIn this experimental model of TBI, the animal was anesthetized and, while maintained on isoflurane, the animals' heads were secured to the inertial loading apparatus by a snout clamp. The lower part of the clamp, a metal plate covered with a rubber bite plate, was inserted into the animal's mouth and the head was secured by tightening the padded steel spring bands, which encircle the snout onto the metal plate. Immediately before injury, anesthesia, supplemental oxygen, and mechanical ventilation were withdrawn, and the piglet could breathe spontaneously on room air. Then, the pig head rotated through a 60-degree sagittal arc or 90-degree axial arc in 10\u201340\u2009ms using an inertial loading device. The angular velocity of the pig head rotation was directly measured at 10\u2009kHz, filtered with a fourth-order, low-pass Butterworth filter, and extracted for FE simulations. After injury, the piglet was removed from the bite plate, supplemental oxygen was resumed as needed, isoflurane was discontinued, the piglet was extubated, and stable monitors were discontinued.\nAll protocols for these experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA), where these experiments were previously conducted. For this study, an experimental dataset containing 16 two-month-old and 26 four-week-old pigs with head rotation in the axial or sagittal plane was selected.\n\nNeuropathology analysis\nThese animals were euthanized at 6\u2009h post-injury, and their brains were perfusion-fixed and sectioned in 3-mm coronal slices (14\u201322 slices per brain). All coronal brain sections were then photographed, cut into 6-\u03bcm-thick slices, and stained for beta-amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2APP; at a dilution of 1:5000), which is a gold-standard marker of damaged axons. For each slice, areas (20\u2009\u00d7\u2009field size, 0.586\u2009mm\n2\n) with at least two positive \u03b2APP immunostaining axonal damage profiles were marked as TAI areas and neuropathological maps were generated. An example of TAI maps for one of the animals is given in\nFigure 1\n. The cumulative sum of marked areas of TAI over the whole areas of the examined brain slices (every 3\u2009mm throughout the whole brain) was used to calculate the axonal injury volume (AIV), which indicates the severity of axonal injury. The range of AIV calculated for this dataset is 0.02\u20131.65%, which represents a no/very minor-to-moderate level of axonal injury.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nTraumatic axonal injury (TAI) maps at every 3\u2009mm throughout the whole brain for 1 piglet.

Color image is available online.\n\nAnisotropic axonal tract embedded pig head finite element model\nA 4-week-old pig head FEM consisted of brain, falx, skull, and brain-skull connectors (mimicking the relative motion of brain to skull), previously developed and validated by our group,\n3\n,\n4\nwas recently enhanced by adding anatomical regions, including lateral ventricles, corpus callosum, and white matter, through mapping the coronal slices of the FEM to the corresponding brain coronal CT images.\n12\n,\n13\nIn addition, axonal fiber tract structures were reconstructed by streamlines tractography analysis using a previously acquired DTI scan of an uninjured perfusion-fixed\nex vivo\n4-week-old piglet brain.\n3\nFiber tractography analysis was performed in the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and Camino software packages,\n35\nusing a Euler method with linear interpolation algorithm by the tracking stop criterion of fractional anisotropy (FA) <0.2 and the tract-turning angle threshold of 60 degrees, and the fixed step size of 0.2\u2009mm. FA value was calculated for each seed point through all streamlines. The axonal tractography streamlines were then used as an input, and the axonal fiber bundle structure FEM was developed using a custom MATLAB script (V. R2015; The MathWorks, Inc., Columbia, MD) and embedded into the pig brain FEM with *CONSTRATNED_BEAM_IN_SOLID Keyword in LS-DYNA (v 971 R9.2.0; LSTC, Livermore, CA). The new enhanced pig FEM, shown in\nFigure 2\n, consists of 13,189 brain, 110 lateral ventricle solid elements, and 72,842 one-millimeter one-dimensional axonal fiber beam elements. The average of FA values of streamline seed points along the element was assigned to each axonal fiber element. The axonal fiber elements were categorized into eight groups depending on the FA value of the element as shown with different colors in\nFigure 2\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nThe embedded white matter tracts pig brain finite element model. In the top figure, the model was cut at several points for illustration of the components. The bottom figure shows the axonal fiber tract within the head geometry. FA, fractional anisotropy.

The brain and axonal fibers were modeled using a modified version of the anisotropic Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden hyperviscoelastic material model\n12\n,\n29\nand a one-term Prony viscoelastic material,\n36\nas described in detail in the\nSupplementary Appendix\nand implemented in LS-DYNA using user-defined material models. The coefficients of the material model of the matrix brain tissue were computed based on a published material testing data of pig brain tissue.\n36\nThe material property of axonal fiber bundle was computed using an effective stiffness ratio (\nR\nv\n) based on the fiber to brain volume fraction (\n\u03b3\nV\n) and stiffness ratios (see the details in the\nSupplementary Appendix\nor a previous work\n12\n) experimentally determined for pig brain.\n37\nThe effective stiffness ratio was used to prevent potential volume redundancy and excessive material stiffness that may arise by the embedded FEM approach,\n12\n,\n29\nin which the brain matrix covers the whole brain volume including the volume of embedded fibers.\nTo minimize the possible effect of mass redundancy which may arise by the element embedding method, a very small density (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.00104\u2009g/cm\n3\n), which is 0.001 of the brain density, was used for the embedded axonal fiber elements in this model.\n12\nThe total additional mass of the embedded axonal bundles is only 5*10\n\u20134\nof the original brain mass and thus its effect is negligible. The cross-section of 0.43\u2009mm\n2\nwas used for the axonal fiber elements to obtain the axonal fiber/brain matrix fraction of 0.5 that was experimentally identified by Arbogast and Margulies\n37\nfor pig brain.\nThe material property of the eight groups of the axonal fiber elements, assuming similarity between mechanical anisotropy and diffusion anisotropy, was adjusted using a dimensionless structure parameter (\u03ba ; details in earlier works\n12\n,\n38\n,\n39\nand the\nSupplementary Appendix\n) that accounts for the orientation distribution of the axons in a voxel-scale fiber bundle and can be related with FA values of the fiber bundle elements. It should be noted that in this model the axonal fibers only contribute during tension, but not compression. The detailed material models and coefficients used in this pig FEM for the axonal fiber bundles, brain tissue, skull, lateral ventricle, skull-brain connectors, and falx are given in the\nSupplementary Appendix\nof this article and also can be found in our previous work.\n12\nThe mesh size of 1\u2009mm was used for the axonal fiber elements, which is relevant to the brain elements with mesh size of 1.3\u20132.0\u2009mm. To determine how sensitive the response of the brain model to the fiber element size is, smaller (0.5\u2009mm) and larger (2\u2009mm) mesh sizes were used for fiber elements and the cumulative axonal strain responses of the model with these three mesh sizes were compared (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n), and no difference was observed.\nThe brain tissue deformation responses of this axonal tract embedded brain FEM were then validated against the brain deformations measured in an\nex vivo\nhemisection experiment previously performed in our laboratory in high strain and strain rate similar to the pig TBI experiments (details published previously\n3\n,\n12\n), and the FEM-derived brain deformation cumulative distribution curve was correlated with the curve obtained from the experiment with no significant statistical difference (\np\nvalue, >0.05). Obtaining a realistic overall brain tissue deformation response was the objective of this validation process. It is worth mentioning that a similar validation approach was used for the previous pig brain models\n3\n,\n4\nfrom our group by comparing their overall deformation responses with the deformation captured by the same\nex vivo\npig hemisection experiments. Therefore, although different constitutive material models were used in this study and the previous pig brain models from our group and direct comparison between their coefficients are not possible, the brain material of these models provide similar deformation responses.\nIn addition, in this study, in order to investigate the effect of embedded axonal fiber bundles on the material behavior of the brain model, the deformation responses of the current anisotropic axonal embedded model was compared with an isotropic brain model with the same mesh properties and a brain visco-hyperelastic constitutive material model as the model in this study, but without the embedded axonal beams. The brain tissue material properties of the isotropic model were calibrated by adjusting the material coefficients of the brain tissue used in this study (multiplying G and k\n1\nby a ratio) until statistically similar deformation responses were obtained between the isotropic and axonal embedded anisotropic FE models (see\nSupplementary Fig. S2\nin the Supplementary Material). The ratio of 1.3 was found for this calibration, suggesting that the embedding axonal bundles stiffen the brain response by 30% (ratio\u2009=\u20091.3).\nOverall, the material property used for this pig model was softer than the ones used in the human brain models in the literature, particularly the axonal embedded human brain model recently developed by another group\n29\nin which the same material model and embedding technique were implemented. It should be noted that the experimental studies of pig and human brain tissue using similar material testing approaches also reported that the pig brain tissue was softer than human brain tissue.\n40\n\nSimulation of animal experiments\nNext, we used the model to simulate the 42 selected pig TBI experiments using their measured rotational velocity time histories as input loading conditions to reproduce the experiments. All simulations were performed in LS-DYNA. The details of the brain geometries, required for geometry scaling, were not available for the animals in this dataset, and therefore mass scaling was used. However, in a recent publication by our group,\n12\nwe examined a separate dataset containing 7 four-week-old and 7 two-month-old pigs, in which the brain geometries were available. Then, we measured the anterior-posterior (AP), lateral (L), and superior-inferior (SI) dimensions of the brain and determined that the geometry variations, which were defined as the coefficients of variation (CVs) of the ratios of these dimensions (L/AP and SI/AP), were <6% across subjects within each age group and both combined. The mean, standard deviation, and CV values for these L/AP and SI/AP are given in\nTable 1\nfor each age group and both combined. This analysis suggested that uniform mass scaling can be used for scaling the animals with the age range used in this study.\nTable 1.\nSummary of Brain Geometry Variations Across 4-Week-Old Piglets, 2-Month-Old Piglets, and Both Ages Combined\nPig brain geometry variations\nl\na\nt\ne\nr\na\nl\nL\na\nn\nt\ne\nr\ni\no\nr\n\u2212\np\no\ns\nt\ne\nr\ni\no\nr\nA\nP\nr\na\nt\ni\no\ns\nu\np\ne\nr\ni\no\nr\n\u2212\ni\nn\nf\ne\nr\ni\no\nr\nS\nI\na\nn\nt\ne\nr\ni\no\nr\n\u2212\np\no\ns\nt\ne\nr\ni\no\nr\nA\nP\nr\na\nt\ni\no\nMean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation\nCoefficient of variation (%)\nMean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation\nCoefficient of variation (%)\n4-week-old\n0.6763\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0250\n3.71\n0.6344\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0376\n5.93\n2-month-old\n0.6606\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0172\n2.61\n0.6125\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0326\n5.33\nCombined ages\n0.6685\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0222\n3.32\n0.6234\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0359\n5.76\nOpen in a separate window\nThe anisotropic pig brain FEM was used as the base for the FE simulations and scaled according to the brain mass of each animal using uniform, isometric mass scaling approach (with scale factor\n\u03bb\nx\n=\n\u03bb\ny\n=\n\u03bb\nz\n=\nm\ns\nc\na\nl\ne\nd\n\u2215\nm\nb\na\ns\ne\n1\n3\n).\n41\nFor each brain element in each simulation, first principal strain at each output state (0.1\u2009ms) was extracted and its maximum value during the entire simulation was calculated as the maximum principal strain (MPS). Similarly, for each axonal fiber element in each simulation, the axial logarithmic strain at each output state was calculated and its maximum value over the simulation time was defined as the maximum axonal strain (MAS). The strain rate for each brain/axonal fiber element was calculated at every 0.1-ms time step as the discrete derivative of the 5-point moving-window-average smoothed strain signal (first principal strain for the brain elements and the axial logarithmic strain for the axonal fiber elements) for each element.\nThe maximum values of the strain rate over the entire simulation time were defined as maximum principal strain rate (MPSR) for each brain element and MASR for each axonal fiber element. Similarly, the strain times strain rate (SxSR) was calculated as multiplication of strain by its strain rate at each time step, and its maximum value over the entire simulation time was defined as MPSxSR for each brain element or MASxSR for each axonal fiber element.\n\nFinite element model and neuropathology colocalization\nIn this step, we registered the neuropathology maps, previously generated for each piglet (details in section on\nNeuropathology analysis\n), onto the FEM scaled to the corresponding piglet brain. This step was conducted to find the coordinates of the areas with axonal damage within the 3D geometry of the pig brain FEM. For each animal, the coronal slices of the scaled FEM with a thickness of one brain element (1.0\u20131.8\u2009mm) were generated and overlayed to the equivalent histopathological maps generated at every \u223c3-mm coronal brain tissue slices throughout the whole brain. Criteria, including shape, width, area, and anatomical structures, were considered in order to find the correct location for mapping of histopathological slices onto the FEM slices. A schematic summarizing the workflow of the FEM-neuropathology colocalizaton for 1 animal as an example is shown in\nFigure 3\n. TAI areas as shown in\nFigure 1\nhad different sizes. In order to standardize the size of TAI areas, each area was partitioned to smaller areas with an almost uniform size of 0.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\u2009mm\n2\nas shown in\nFigure 3\n. This area size is close to the value of cross-section area (0.38\u2009mm\n2\n) selected for the axonal fiber elements.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nA schematic workflow for the FEM-neuropathology colocalization process. Color image is available online.\nAfter colocalization of FEM and neuropathology slices and discretization of TAI areas to areas with small, more uniformly area size, the coordinates of the center of each TAI area and its cross-sectional area size were extracted instead of a set of boundary points defining the area of damage. This simplification allowed the use of lower-dimension data structure. For further analysis, we considered each TAI area as a cylinder with 3-mm thickness and the cross-section (0.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\u2009mm\n2\n) that was extracted for that TAI. Then, for each animal, the minimum distance (d) between the location of each brain element centroid and each axonal fiber element centroid of the scaled FEM to any of the TAI cylindrical regions of that animal was calculated. With this definition, for any element whose centroid was within any TAI cylindrical area, d was equal to zero and for any other element d was calculated as the minimum distance between the element centroid to the outer boundary of the closest TAI cylindrical area. All analyses in this step were performed in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc.).\n\nThe optimal tissue injury threshold and distance to the actual injury areas\nWhen deformation-related TAI predictor candidates, including MPS, MPSR, MPSxSR, MAS, MASR, and MASxSR, were computed for all animals through FE simulations of the pig TBI experiments and the minimum distance, d, of all FE elements to TAI areas for all animals were calculated (as described in section on\nFinite element model and neuropathology colocalization\n), these data were combined and deformation parameters were plotted against \u201cd\u201d for all brain and axonal fiber elements as shown in\nFigure 4\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nThe brain and axonal fiber deformation parameters including: (\nA\n) MAS, (\nB\n) MASR, (\nC\n) MASxSR, (\nD\n) MPS, (\nE\n) MPSR, and (\nF\n) MPSxSR versus the minimum distance between the location of each brain and axonal fiber element to the regions of TAI identified by histopathology.

Color image is availble online.\nTo implement the concept of using FEM for predicting damage at element-by-element approximations, we sought to identify a threshold (th\nx\n) such that any element whose predictor parameter value exceeds that injury threshold as an injured element (predicted as injured; PI) and any element whose predictor value is lower than that injury threshold as a non-injured element (predicted as non-injured; PN). Ideally, all PI elements should be perfectly overlapped (d\u2009=\u20090\u2009mm) with TAI areas identified by histopathology analysis, and all PN elements should be far from (d >> 0\u2009mm) any TAI areas. A schematic representation of an ideal condition is shown in\nFigure 5A\n. However, none of the FE-derived predictor candidates fit the ideal characteristics described above. Therefore, instead of looking for a perfect overlap (d\u2009=\u20090), any area within a selected distance (d\ns\n) of any actual TAI can be defined as injured area and any areas with d > d\ns\ncan be defined as non-injured area. Given this definition, the PI elements that are within d\ns\ndistance (d \u2264 d\ns\n) of actual TAI areas can be considered as correctly predicted as injured element (CPI), and the PN elements with d > d\ns\nof actual TAI areas can be determined as correctly predicted as non-injured element (CPN). A schematic representation of CPI and CPN elements for an arbitrary selected th\nx\nand d\ns\nis shown in\nFigure 5B\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 5.\n(\nA\n) Schematic representation of an ideal condition in which all elements whose metric\u2009\u00d7\u2009values exceeding a selected threshold of th\nx\n(dashed red line) are very close to TAIs (d\u2009\u2248\u20090). (\nB\n) Schematic representation of predicted injured element (PI; in the green box), correctly predicted injured element (CPI; in the blue box), predicted non-injured elements (PN; in the black box), and correctly predicted non-injured elements (CPN; in the red box) for an arbitrary selected th\nx\nand arbitrary selected distance to actual TAI (d\ns\n). TAI, traumatic axonal injury. Color image is available online.\nIn order to determine how well the FE-derived predictor candidates can predict TAI spatially, for each of the six TAI predictor candidates (x), we examined a matrix of the threshold values (th\nx\n) and d\ns\nto maximize the average of two optimization criteria: element-based correct prediction rate and TAI detection rate. The overall element-based correct prediction rate was defined as the percentage of the elements that correctly predicted as injured (CPI; x >\u2009=\u2009th\nx\nand d <\u2009=\u2009d\ns\n) or non-injured elements (CPN; x < th\nx\nand d > d\ns\n). The element-based true positive prediction rate and true negative prediction rate were defined as CPI/PI and CPN/PN, respectively. The percentage of actual TAI areas that were within distance of d\ns\nfrom elements predicted as injured (PI; x >\u2009=\u2009th\nx\n) was defined as TAI detection rate. To calculate the TAI detection rate, the regions within d\ns\ndistance of the PI elements for each animal were searched for the actual TAI regions, identified by histopathology analysis. Higher TAI detection rate indicates that more actual TAI regions can be predicted as damaged by the FEM tool using the selected th\nx\nand d\ns\nvalues. Higher overall element-based correct prediction rate represents better prediction capability of the FE-derived predictor candidate spatially at the element level.\nThe optimization criterion defined as the average of overall element-based correct prediction rate and TAI detection rate criteria for the selected matrices of th\nx\nand d\ns\nwere calculated for all the six FE-derived predictor candidates. To obtain more reliable results, this optimization process was coupled with a k-fold CV technique with k\u2009=\u20095.\n42\nAccordingly, for each of the TAI predictor candidates, the data were partitioned into k equal or nearly equal subsamples and at each iteration of k-fold CV, k-1 subsamples were combined and used as a training dataset to determine the optimal injury values (th\nx\n) and d\ns\n, and one subsample was left out as a testing dataset to evaluate the overall element-based correct prediction rate and TAI detection rate performance of the selected th\nx\nand d\ns\non the new dataset. For each TAI predictor candidate at each iteration of the 5-fold CV, \u223c80% of the data were used as training, the th\nx\nand d\ns\nvalues that resulted in the highest average value of the two criteria, if available, were selected as the optimal combination of injury threshold and distance to actual injury, the determined optimal th\nx\nand d\ns\nvalues were then examined on the remaining \u223c20% testing data set, and the overall element-based correct prediction rate and TAI detection rate on the testing dataset were calculated. The averages of the 5-fold CV results were then calculated and are reported in\nTable 1\n."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThese studies were conducted in a facility approved by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). All experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n(8th edition, National Research Council) and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of UTMB. Adult, male, Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles Rivers Laboratories, Inc., Portland, ME, USA), 250\u2013400\u2009g, were group housed (two rats of similar injury status per cage) and had access to food and water\nad libitum\nin a vivarium with these constant conditions: light cycle (0600\u20131800), temperature (21\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C), and humidity (40%\u201350%). Unless noted, all animals were provided with enrichment materials, such as a cardboard tube, in their home cage.\n\nFluid percussion injury\nAll animal surgeries were performed under aseptic conditions by trained investigators in accordance with our IACUC-approved protocol, minimizing pain and distress at all times. Animals were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in an anesthetic chamber, intubated, and mechanically ventilated with 1.5\u20132.0% isoflurane in O\n2\n: room air (70:30) using a volume ventilator (EDCO Scientific, Chapel Hill, NC, USA). Rats were prepared for parasagittal fluid-percussion TBI (FPI) as previously described.\n12\nBriefly, animals were placed in a stereotaxic head frame and the scalp was sagittally incised. A 4.0-mm diameter hole was trephined into the skull 2.0\u2009mm to the right of the sagittal suture and midway between lambda and bregma, and then a modified 20-gauge Luerlok syringe hub (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was placed over the exposed dura, bonded in place with cyanoacrylic adhesive and covered with dental acrylic. Animals with punctured dura were excluded from the study. Prior to FPI induction, the device and connector were filled with sterile degassed water and checked for air bubbles. The device was prepared for the injury by delivering approximately three test pulses (confirmed by a smooth waveform on the oscilloscope) while the Luerlok at the end of the tubing was in the closed position.\nJust prior to FPI induction, isoflurane was temporarily discontinued and rats were connected to the fluid percussion trauma device (Custom Design and Fabrication, Virginia Commonwealth University, VA, USA). They were subjected to FPI (266\u2013320\u2009mV oscilloscope [Tektronix TDS 1002 60\u2009MHz, two-channel digital real time with Trauma Inducer Pressure Transducer Amplifier] readings, 1.81\u20132.17 atm range calculated, consistently held at 15.5-cm pendulum height, and pressure pulse length set at 25\u2009msec) immediately after the return of a withdrawal reflex to paw pinch. The withdrawal reflex is a spinal reflex that returns after the cessation of anesthetics prior to the return of higher-level reflexes (e.g., righting reflex [RR]) while the rat remains unconscious. Because FPI is administered immediately after a withdrawal reflex is detected, rats are unconscious at the time of injury. It is necessary to discontinue the isoflurane immediately prior to injury to reduce the effects of anesthesia on the time required for the rat to right itself from a supine position (RR). The RR is a brainstem reflex that returns prior to thalamocortical function during recovery from unconsciousness due to anesthesia or brain injury.\nAfter FPI or sham injury, rats were disconnected from the fluid percussion device and RR was assessed until a normal RR was observed three times (and the time at third righting was recorded). Rats were then placed on 2% isoflurane while wound sites were infused with bupivicaine and skin was closed with wound clips. The animals received approximately 100\u2009mg/kg acetaminophen suppository before emerging from anesthesia. Isoflurane was discontinued and the rats were extubated and allowed to recover in a warm, humidified incubator. When each rat was fully recovered, it was returned to its home cage with\nad libitum\nfood and water. Each rat (two per cage) was housed with a cagemate of similar injury status (naives were housed with other naives, shams were housed with other sham-injured rats, and FPI-injured rats were housed with other FPI-injured rats) to prevent anxiety.\nAll animals were monitored for signs of infection, severe neurological injury, or discomfort. Signs of discomfort or pain in rodents include persistent dormouse position and unwillingness to move, refusal to eat or drink, vocalizations when handled, posturing, aggressiveness, and polyphagia of bedding. Rats exhibiting these symptoms were humanely euthanized immediately (4% isoflurane in an anesthetic chamber followed by decapitation) to prevent pain and distress. Any rats that received a return of RR time of less than 20\u2009min or animals that experienced neurogenic pulmonary edema immediately after the FPI were excluded from the study. All sham control animals received the same amount of anesthesia and were prepared identically to the injured animals with the exception of the actual FPI injury.\n\nBehavior studies\nImmediately following FPI in rodents, the RR (the reflex for the animal to turn over to its normal upright position when it is placed on its back) is suppressed and its return is known to be a clinical correlate for return to consciousness in patients who have sustained more than a mild TBI.\n15\nThe RR time was recorded when the rat had righted itself three times consecutively after being placed on its back. In this study, the RR times for all of the injured animals fell between 22 and 26\u2009min, indicating greater than mild impairment and in comparison, the RR for the sham-injured controls (receiving identical surgical preparation and anesthesia levels as the FPI-injured rats) was under 10\u2009min in length.\n\nNeuroscore evaluation\nAnimals received neuroscore (NS) evaluations pre- and post-FPI. Behavioral competency of each animal was assessed prior to surgery by testing its baseline reflex performance with the NS evaluation, as described previously.\n14\n,\n15\nAnimals were excluded from study if any deficits were present before surgery.\n\nMorris water maze\nThe MWM is a commonly used test for the assessment of learning and memory for neurotrauma studies in rodents.\n2\nThe testing paradigm and equipment used was similar to that reported in a study by Nichols and associates,\n16\nwith the exception that testing was for 3 days instead of 5 days (post-injury days 11\u201313) and the probe trial (platform was removed from the pool and memory was tested using a 30-sec swim to find time spent in target quadrant as a correlate of memory retention and recall in the absence of the escape platform) was post-injury day 15 (probe data not shown). The MWM tank (2 ft. height and 70 in. diameter) was located in a quiet room with a camera mounted on the ceiling and a computer with an ANYMaze tracking system located on the other side of a curtain where the experimenter was while the rat was swimming. The room had a bookshelf and items mounted on each wall that remained consistently in place throughout the experiments and the water maze was drained and cleaned at the end of each day (in between each swim, feces were removed and water was swirled to prevent scent trails to the platform). During the experiment, the overhead lighting was turned off and a floodlight that remained in the same corner of the room was turned on. In between swim trials, the rat would recover in a warming chamber for 4\u2009min. The water temperature was maintained at 26\u00b0C (\u00b1 1 degree in either direction).\nEach rat was placed in the water facing the tank from one of the four equally spaced entry points along the perimeter of the tank. Once the rat was released, the ANYMaze system tracked the movement of the rat and stopped the trial once the animal reached the hidden platform (clear plexiglass; 4.5 in. diameter) or once the maximum swim trial time was reached. To prevent exhaustion from multiple swims per day, we set the maximum time for each swim at 120\u2009sec. The rats that were unable to find the platform were led to it and placed on it for 30\u2009sec before being carried to the heated recovery chamber. All rats swam four swim trials (one from each entry point) per day for 3 days (platform remained in the same location for every trial). Behavior testing was performed by the same technician for all time-points in the study. The entry points were randomly selected (for instance, the first rat's first swim could result in one of four possible entry-point options [triangle, square, circle, or X], but for that rat's second trial, only one of three entry points were possible, and so forth, such that each rat started from all entry points each day) for each animal's trial and the behavior technician was blinded to injury status and intervention.\n\nStatistical analyses\nThis study combines sham and TBI data from three prior experiments, each with similar experimental design and a common injury model. Experiment A contributed data from 8 animals per group (sham vs. TBI); experiment B contributed data from 13 animals per group; and experiment C contributed data from 25 sham and 40 TBI animals. Altogether the total cohort includes 46 sham and 61 TBI animals, with latency measures for four swims per day over 3 sequential days [days 11\u201313 post-injury].\nUnivariate summaries by group, day, and swim per day include the mean and standard deviation of swim duration, as well as counts and percentages of animals that successfully reached the submerged platform.\nA time-to-event model was used to relate the swim duration (latency) to find the submerged platform (event) to swim day (days 1, 2, 3), swim per day (swims 1, 2, 3, 4), treatment (sham vs.TBI), and interactions among these variables, while adjusting for experiment (experiments A, B, C) and clustering (similar to that in mixed effect models) on animal to control for repeated measures of the same animals over multiple swims.\nA semiparametric Cox proportional hazards model was initially considered as the time-to-event model\n17\n; however, the proportional hazards assumption was violated both in plots of hazard curves over time\n18\nand in formal tests based upon Schoenfeld residuals.\n19\nNon-proportionality was observed between days, between swims within the same day, and between treatment groups.\nConsidering the violations of the proportionality assumption, we opted instead to use an AFT model.\n20\nAFT models were fit using Weibull, exponential, Gaussian, logistic, lognormal, and log-logistic distributions. The model with log-logistic distribution had the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) and was selected as optimal for our analysis. Differences between sham and TBI treatments by swim per day for each day were estimated by Hommel-adjusted contrasts.\n21\nDifferences between days by group and swim were similarly estimated.\nAdditionally, to allow comparison of the time-to-event model with more common methodologies, a mixed effect ANOVA was used to model swim duration (ignoring censoring bias, such that swims exceeding 120\u2009sec were set as 120\u2009sec), and a mixed effect logistic regression modeled incidence of reaching the submerged platform. As with the time-to-event model, each of these models were with relation to swim day, swim per day, treatment, and interactions among these variables, while adjusting for experiment and blocking on animal to control for repeated measures. Likewise, differences between sham and TBI treatments by swim per day for each day were estimated by Hommel-adjusted contrasts.\nStatistical analyses were performed using R statistical software.\n22\nIn all statistical tests, alpha\u2009=\u20090.05. The \u201csurvival\u201d package was used for both Cox and AFT time-to-event modeling.\n17\n,\n23\nHazard functions were estimated using the \u201cmuhaz\u201d package.\n24\nDifferences among factor levels in the models were estimated using the \u201cemmeans\u201d package.\n25\nCatseye plots\n26\nwere produced using the \u201ccatseyes\u201d package\n27\nand are explained in\nFigure 1\n.

Catseye plots (so-named due to their visual similarity to a cat's eye) are used to illustrate the estimated distribution of the model-adjusted mean, which is normally distributed with a standard deviation equal to the standard error (SE). This example illustrates the representation of a mean of 1 with an SE of 0.2, shown as a conventional normal distribution \u201cbell\u201d curve at left with \u00b1SE shaded, and at right as a conventional point with \u00b1SE confidence interval, followed by the corresponding catseye plot with shaded \u00b1SE interval. The outlined area of the catseye encapsulates 99.8% of the normal distribution of the mean (compare it with the normal curve at left, and envision that curve rotated 90 degrees and reflected about its axis), with the intention being to provide a more complete sense of the distribution of the estimate of the mean than would be feasible with just a \u00b1SE or 95% interval."

HRS employs national area probability sampling of U.S. households with supplemental oversampling of black individuals, Hispanic individuals, and Florida state residents (see\nhttp://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu\nfor further details). For the present study, we used data from male respondents to the TBI module survey, which was administered to a random subsample of the 2014 survey respondents (\nn\n=\u20091489 of the 16,642 non-proxy respondents; overall\nn\n=\u2009599 men; see the study by Gardner and colleagues\n14\nfor additional details). Female respondents were not included due to the very small number of female veterans in the sample (\nn\n=\u20097). Of the 599 male respondents to the TBI module, 188 (32%) endorsed having served in the U.S. military during the 2014 HRS survey or in prior waves and were classified as veterans. Information about combat exposure status was not available.\n\nHead/Neck injury exposure\nParticipants in the TBI module responded to questions from a modified version of the Ohio State University TBI Identification Method (OSU-TBI-ID\n15\n). This measure, which has demonstrated excellent reliability and predictive validity, is recommended by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) for assessment of self-report of lifetime exposure to TBI in clinical research.\nIn the present study, \u201cNo injury\u201d was defined as no head or neck injury of any kind. \u201cHead/neck injury\u201d was defined as any lifetime history of traumatic injury to the head or neck. \u201cTBI\u201d was defined as any injury to the head or neck resulting in loss of consciousness (LOC; i.e., \u201cWere you knocked out or did you lose consciousness?\u201d), PTA (i.e., \u201cWere you dazed, or did you have a gap in your memory?\u201d) or both. \u201cNon-TBI head/neck injury\u201d (NTI) was defined as any traumatic injury to the head or neck that did not result in symptoms of LOC or PTA. \u201cMultiple NTI\u201d was defined as having more than one NTI.\n\nDemographics, medical comorbidities, and neurobehavioral conditions\nWe examined age, ethnicity, race, years of education, and self-report of medical comorbidities diagnosed by a physician. We also examined self-reported neurobehavioral symptoms including pain, sleep problems, depression, and subjective memory impairment using validated symptom scales and established cutoff scores, as described previously.\n16\nMissingness was under 1% for all variables.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).\n17\nRaking and weight trimming were used to adjust the sample to have the characteristics of all non-institutionalized men 51 and older in the United States as identified in the 2000 U.S. Census and 2004 Current Population Survey.\n18\nBaseline demographics, medical comorbidities, and neurobehavioral symptoms were compared across head/neck injury, veteran, and civilian groups using weighted chi square and\nt\ntests. We estimated weighted nationally representative prevalence of head/neck injury subtypes among veterans versus civilians. We used weighted chi square analyses to investigate relative risk of head injury severity and frequency among veterans versus civilians."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThe study was approved by the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, as well as by the high school's administration and Women's Varsity soccer coach. After a research assistant explained the study to female high school soccer players and their parental guardians, participants were recruited and informed consent or assent with parental consent was first obtained before commencement of the study. Eighteen female soccer players were enrolled and tested across two high school seasons. Eight players participated in the first season only (Year 1) and four in the second season only (Year 2), and six in both Year 1 and Year 2. All participants had no known neurological conditions (beside five subjects with previous history of concussion; details below) and had normal or corrected to normal vision. Each participant played soccer 8\u2009h per week and on average played video games 0.5\u2009h per week (range: 0.0\u20138.0\u2009h). As illustrated in\nFigure 1\n, all RT data was collected at time-points (T1, T2, T3) before and after practices (Workout A), as well as before games (Workout B). All participants had the same duration of workout during practices (Workout A). Practices did not include head drills. All participants did not have the same duration of workout during games (Workout B). Ten participants played the full game (two participants for both years), three participants played half games (two participants for both years), three participants played half games in Year 1 and full games in Year 2, and two participants typically did not play very much at all in games. Finally, the study included players from various field positions. Seven participants primarily played in a defender position (three participants for both years), seven participants primarily played in a midfielder position (two participants for both years), one participant primarily played in a forward position, one participant primarily played in a midfielder position in Year 1 and a defender position in Year 2, and two participants primarily played as goalie.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nTimeline of testing. Participants were tested at three sessions: at the beginning, middle (Year 1 only), and end of their 2-month season. Half the participants were randomly assigned and tested at the beginning of the week throughout their testing (with no exposure to heading the ball in the prior 24-h period, indicated by [no W] for no workout) and half the participants were tested mid-week throughout their testing (with exposure to heading the ball in the prior 24-h period, indicated by [W] for workout). For each session, players were tested at three time-points (T1, T2, T3)\u2014T1: before a workout, Workout A (W\nA\n); T2: immediately following this workout; and T3: 24\u2009h later, which was immediately before another workout, Workout B (W\nB\n).\nFor Year 1, the mean age of the 14 players was 16.3 years (\u00b1 1.0 standard deviation [SD]; range: 15\u201318) and the mean number of years of soccer playing was 11.1 years (\u00b1 1.2 SD; range: 10\u201313). Twelve of the 14 participants (86%) were right-handed. Four of the 14 subjects (29%, one participant, two instances) had experienced a previous concussion more than 1 year prior to the study.\nFor Year 2, the mean age of the 10 players was 16.3 years (\u00b1 0.8 SD; range 15\u201317) and the mean number of years of soccer played was 11.7 years (\u00b1 0.5 SD; range 11\u201312). Eight of the 10 participants (80%) tested were right-handed. One of the 10 participants (10%) had experienced a previous concussion more than 10 months before the study.\n\nInstrument and measures\nStimuli\nThe experiment was conducted on an iPad 2 with refresh rate of 60\u2009Hz. The frame refresh signal was matched with the onset and offset of stimuli, with a precision of 1.6\u2009msec (U.S. Patent No. 9,717,459. 2017; U.S. Patent No. 9,949,693. 2018). The display had a white center circle for fixation (diameter subtending 2.4\u00b0 visual angle from a 33\u2009cm viewing distance, 1.4\u2009cm) and was surrounded by four boxes (1.4\u00b0, 0.8\u2009cm) 7.0\u00b0 (4.0\u2009cm) from the center circle, which indicated the four possible locations to touch. The participant started each trial by putting their index finger on the fixation circle in the middle of the display and 480\u2009msec later a target (white-filled box, 0.8\u2009cm) would appear in one of the four locations on the display. For the ProPoint task, the participant was instructed to touch the visual target as quickly and accurately as possible. For the AntiPoint task, the participant had to touch the box opposite of the visual target as quickly and accurately as possible (\nFig. 2\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nSchematic of ProPoint and AntiPoint tasks.\n(A)\nProPoint task. Central starting point (circle) and four possible target locations (square outlines) are shown. The target is shown by a filled square and the arrow indicates the direction of a correct response.\n(B)\nAntiPoint task. Same as in (A), but notice that the direction of the arrow is now opposite to the target's location (figure adapted from Zhang and colleagues).\n46\nTouch responses\nThe location of the touch responses was captured by the iPad's capacitive touch screen interface with resolution of 52 pixels per cm and a frame refresh rate of 60\u2009Hz. For each trial in each task, (RT, defined as the elapsed time in msec) between the appearance of the target to the time of touch, was recorded. Events and response times were aligned with refresh and adjusted by subtracting the externally-measured (with photodiode, microphone and storage oscilloscope) average delay of detecting a touch event on the capacitive device.\n13\n,\n22\n,\n24\n,\n25\nIf the distance between the actual target location and the touched coordinates was greater than 3.3\u00b0 (1.9\u2009cm), the trial was counted as an error.\n\nDesign and procedure\nThe study was designed and conducted in a manner to cause no interference or inconvenience to the soccer team and its schedule, thus providing an accurate assessment of real-world soccer players. Participants had their normal soccer workouts (practices or games) on the days of testing.\nFor Year 1, the soccer players were tested at three sessions: at the beginning, middle and end of their 2-month season. Half the participants were randomly assigned and tested at the beginning of the week throughout their testing (with no exposure to heading the ball in the prior 24-h period) and half the participants were tested mid-week throughout their testing (with exposure to heading the ball in the prior 24-h period). For each session, players were tested at three time-points (Test Times), before a workout, Workout A (Test Time\u2009=\u20091), immediately following this workout (Test Time\u2009=\u20092), and 24\u2009h later (Test Time\u2009=\u20093), which is immediately before another workout, Workout B. For Year 2, the 10 players were tested only at two sessions, the beginning and end of their 2-month season. Again, half the participants were randomly assigned and tested at the beginning of the week and half were tested mid-week. The testing followed the same format as Year 1 with three Test Times: before Workout A (Test Time\u2009=\u20091), immediately after Workout A (Test Time\u2009=\u20092), and 24\u2009h later (Test Time\u2009=\u20093), before Workout B. Thus, the subjects only participating in Year 1 were tested for a total of nine times (three Test Times and three Sessions), the subjects only participating in Year 2 for a total of six times (three Test Times and two Sessions), and subjects participating in both Years for a total of 15 times (three Test Times and five Sessions).\nAt each Test Time, between 3:15 and 5:30\np.m.\n, each participant performed the two tasks (ProPoint and AntiPoint tasks, respectively) in separate blocks until 48 correct trials were completed for each task. Half of the participants started with the AntiPoint task, while the other half started with the ProPoint task.\nHeaders\nIn addition, we recorded heading behavior for each player. Following Workout A, players self reported the number of headers they had that day (Workout A headers) and the number of headers the previous day (24\u2009h prior to Workout A). Since half of the participants were tested at the beginning of the week (with no exposure to heading the ball on the day before Workout A), the mean for the self-reported number of headers was 0.9 headers (SD\u2009=\u20091.9; range 0\u201310) the day before Workout A and was 2.3 (SD\u2009=\u20094.1, range 0\u201320) during Workout A for all sessions.\nAlso, at the last testing session of the season, for both Years, players self reported the average number of headers they had per workout during the season (Season Average Heading). The mean for the self-reported Season Average Heading was 3.2 (SD\u2009=\u20092.8; range 2\u201310).\n\nStatistical analysis\nErrors and trimming\nAll trials in the ProPoint and AntiPoint tasks containing an error (finger touched more than 3.3\u00b0 away from the center of the target location) were excluded (1.8%). Conditional means were then calculated by task for each participant, Session, and Test Time. RTs that were greater than 2.75 standard deviations away from this conditional mean were excluded. This trimming procedure removed an additional 2.1% and 1.9% of trials for ProPoint and AntiPoint task, respectively.\nExclusion and missing data\nTwo of 14 Year 1 participants experienced a concussion with no loss of consciousness. One experienced a concussion after Session 1 testing in Year 1 and did not participate in Year 2, thus the tests after Session 1 were excluded. Another participant had a concussion immediately after the final testing session in Year 1, which was more than 10 months before beginning of the Year 2, thus all tests were included. None of the participants experienced a head injury during Year 2.\nDue to illness on the testing days, three participants (one participating in only Year 1, one participating in both Year 1 and 2, and one participating in only Year 2) left the Workout early and were not tested for Test Time 2. Two of these participants also missed Test Time 3. The missed testing times occurred in sessions at the beginning (two participants) or end (one participant) of the season.\nIn addition, due to a large learning effect, the first test performed by each participant was excluded. The RTs of the remaining trimmed trials for each pointing task were used for statistical analyses.\nFirst analysis (immediate and 24-h effects)\nIn the first analysis, separately for each pointing task, we estimated the immediate and 24-h effects of a soccer workout using a mixed effects model where the fixed effects were Test Time (1, 2, 3), the number of headers within the previous hour or so (H-1hr), the number of headers approximately 24\u2009h earlier (H-24hr) and time played in games (Workout B). The random effect was the participant assuming a spatial exponential power structure, SP(EXP)(Session-by-Test Time), correlation structure within each participant and repeated measurements within each testing session of a participant assuming an autocorrelation with order 1, AR(1). In this analysis, we used all data collected in the first year of participation in the study only, so that second season effects were not confounded with short term effects. Thus, the four participants who participated in Year 2 for the first time were considered in their first year and included in the analysis. However, two participants (one from concussion, one from illness) were not included in this analysis (see the \u201cExclusion and missing data\u201d section). Additionally, since the first test time of each participant's first session was excluded due to a learning effect (see the \u201cExclusion and missing data\u201d section) and to avoid the imbalance in test time, the first session of each participant was excluded for these analyses. For significant Test Time effects, we followed with mixed effects model\npost hoc\nplanned comparisons among the Test Times (1 vs. 2, immediate effects; and 2 vs. 3, 24-h effects) to evaluate test time effects.\nSecond analysis (season effects)\nIn the second analysis, again separately for each pointing task, we estimated season effects of soccer playing using a mixed effects model where the fixed effects were Season (beginning vs. end), the number of headers within the previous hour or so (H-1hr), the number of headers approximately 24\u2009h earlier (H-24hr), the Season Average Heading (H-s) and time played in games. The random effect was the participant assuming a spatial exponential power structure, SP(EXP)(Session), correlation structure within each participant and repeated measurements within each testing session of a participant assuming an autocorrelation with order 1, AR(1). For these analyses, we included only Test Time 2 at the beginning and end of the season. Fifteen players had Test Time 2 at both the beginning and end of the season in at least 1 year and were used for statistical analyses.\nAdditional analysis\nWe compared the season average heading between defenders and non-defenders (including midfielders, a forward, and two goalies) and we found no difference between the positions [3.6 headers (SD\u2009=\u20092.7) for defender; 2.8 headers (SD\u2009=\u20092.9) for non-defenders; F(1,22)\u2009=\u20090.56,\np\n=\u20090.46). Thus, we do not think that position is an important factor in this study.\nSee\nTable 1\nfor a summary of unadjusted ProPoint and AntiPoint mean RTs (\u00b1 SD) for the First Analysis across Test Time (A Panel) and the Second Analysis across Season (B Panel), respectively. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS for Windows V9.4 (Cary, NC).

    "Methods": "Animals\nMice expressing human calpastatin (hCAST) under control of the prion promoter (PrP-hCAST) were maintained and genotyped as described previously.\n18\nThirty-five neonatal transgenic (\nTg\n) Prp-hCAST and wild type (WT) mice were used for excitotoxic hippocampal injury. Thirty-two female adult PrP-hCAST and littermate controls of WT mice, weighing 20\u201325\u2009g, were used for spinal contusion injury. Animals were kept under standard housing conditions in the Division of Laboratory Animal Resources sector of the University of Kentucky Medical Center, which is fully accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All experimental procedures were approved and performed in accordance with the Guidelines of the US National Institutes of Health and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Kentucky.\nThe mice were bred on a FVB/N background in our animal facilities. Mice were genotyped using primers phgPrP5' (5' GAAC TGAACCATTTCAACCGAG3') and phgPrP3' (5' AGAGCTACAGG TGGATAACC3').\n18\nThese PrP-hCAST\nTg\nmice showed robust expression of human calpastatin, and no human calpastatin expression was noted in littermate controls (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nHippocampal calpastatin messenger ribonucleic acid mRNA expression in wild type (WT) and human calpastatin (hCAST) transgenic (\nTg\n) mice. The hCAST\nTg\nmice (\u00b1) positive for the hCAST gene (lane 3 and lane 4) were identified by pollymerase chain reaction with primers 5\u2032-GAAC TGAACCATTTCAACCGAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCAGC TGTAGGC GACCCACAGG TGAAG-3\u2032.\n\nOrganotypic hippocampal slice culture\nOrganotypic hippocampal slice cultures were prepared as described previously.\n19\nBriefly, seven-day-old neonatal hCAST\nTg\nor WT mouse pups were euthanized, and brains were removed immediately into ice cold culture medium. The culture medium was composed of MEM (Minimum Essential Medium containing Hanks salts and\nl\n-glutamine, Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD), 25\u2009mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO), 36\u2009mM glucose (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 25% Hanks Balanced salt solution (Gibco), 25% heat inactivated horse serum (Sigma Aldrich Co.), and 50\u2009mM penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco).\nBilateral hippocampi were dissected, cleaned of extra tissue under dissecting microscopy, and then sectioned coronally at 200\u2009\u03bcm using McIlwain Tissue Chopper (Mickle Laboratory Engineering Co. Ltd., Gomshall, UK). Morphologically intact slices were placed into fresh culture medium (1\u2009mL) in a six-well plate that contained pre-warmed porous Teflon membrane inserts (Millicell-CM 0.4\u2009\u03bcm, Millipore, Marlborough, MA) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO\n2\n/95% air. There were 3\u20135 slices plated onto each insert. To allow the slices exposure to the air, the slices were covered with only a film of medium, and extra medium from the top of the membrane insert was aspirated. The slices were cultured for four days to attach to the insert membrane before any experiments were performed. Slices were fed on day 4 with fresh culture medium.\nHippocampal slice cultures were prepared from seven-day-old mouse pups as described previously.\n19\nFive days later, the cultures were treated with a different concentration of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) (5, 10, or 20\u2009\u03bcM, Sigma) and propidium iodide (PI, Sigma, 2.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL) for 24\u2009h.\nNeuronal death was assessed by measurement of PI uptake as described previously.\n19\nPropidium iodide is a fluorescent molecule that binds to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by intercalating between the bases. It is excluded from healthy cells, but after membrane damage gains access to nuclear DNA in injured cells.\n20\nThe PI-labeled cell death signal at 24\u2009h after NMDA insult was imaged and analyzed by SPOT Advanced software for Windows (W. Nushbaum Inc., Mc Henry, IL) using 5X objective on an inverted Leica DMIRB fluorescent microscopy image system (\nn\n=\u20095 slices per animal,\nn\n=\u20094\u20136 animals per group).\nFluorescent intensity of PI images was analyzed with Image J Software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda) for densitometry. For each animal, the calculated fluorescent intensity of PI image for cell death was averaged. Then, the average intensity per slice of all animals in each group was averaged to obtain a mean value per slice. Exposure conditions and times were identical for all images.\nTo determine the mechanism by which the hCAST expression protects neurons against NMDA-induced neuron death, injury, \u03b1II-spectrin breakdown (including the 145\u2009kDa calpain specific breakdown product) was evaluated using Western blotting as described previously.\n51\nAt 24\u2009h after NMDA insult, slices were treated with lysis buffer (62.5\u2009mM Tris, M urea, 10% glycerol, and 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], pH 6.8) and prepared for assessment of spectrin degradation using Western blot analysis.\n\nContusive SCI\nContusion SCI was produced after a T9 laminectomy using an Infinite Horizons (IH) SCI device (Precision Systems & Instrumentation, Lexington, KY) as described previously.\n6\n,\n7\nBriefly, adult female PrP-hCAST\nTg\nor WT mice, weighing 20\u201325\u2009g, were anesthetized with ketamine (80\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneal [\nip\n]) and xylazine (14\u2009mg/kg,\nip\n), and a laminectomy was performed to expose spinal segment T9. The exposed vertebral column was stabilized by clamping the rostral T8 and caudal T10 vertebral bodies with two spinal forceps. The SCI was then applied with the IH device using a 70 kdyn force setting, which resulted in severe contusion injury.\nImpact analyses, including actual force applied to the spinal cord, displacement of spinal cord, and velocity, were recorded. The impact tip was automatically retracted immediately, the wound irrigated with saline, and the muscle and skin openings were closed with sutures. Sham animals received a laminectomy only. After the surgical procedure, all animals were placed on a heating pad set at 37\u00b0C until consciousness and mobility (upper limbs) was regained. Post-operative care included the manual expression of bladders twice daily until recovery of bladder function, injection with 3\u20135\u2009mL sterile saline administered subcutaneously (\nsc\n) immediately after surgery, 33.3\u2009mg/kg cefazolin, administered by intramuscular injection, twice a day for one week.\nAt 24\u2009h post-injury, PrP-hCAST or WT mice were euthanatized by pentobarbital (100\u2009mg/kg,\nip\ninjection) and decapitated. A 5-mm block of spinal cord centered on T9 was removed and snap-frozen on dry ice, then stored at -80\u00b0C. The spinal cord samples were homogenized in a lysis buffer and sonicated. The protein samples were obtained by microcentrifugation at 14,000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. Protein quantities in supernatant were determined using the bicinchoninic assay method.\n21\u201323\n\nWestern blotting\nWestern blotting was performed as described previously.\n21\u201323\nBriefly, protein samples (30\u2009\u03bcg of protein extract each sample with 2X laemmli sample buffer) were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with a polyclonal antibody against \u03b1-spectrin (1:1000, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) or calpastatin (1:1000, specific for human calpastatin, Santa Cruz Biotech, Dallas, TX) and reprobed with a monoclonal antibody against actin (1:1000, Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Blots were then incubated with infrared-labeled antirabbit or antimouse secondary antibodies (1:5000). All blots were visualized on the LI-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system and analyzed using LI-COR Image Studio (Lincoln, NE).\n\nAssessment of locomotor function\nLocomotor function was measured using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) as described previously.\n12\n,\n24\nThe BMS score is a 0 to 9 point scale, with subscore ranges from 0 to 11, which measures locomotor function after thoracic contusive SCI in mice; it is based on assessment of ankle extension, hindlimb joint movements, trunk stability, stepping coordination, paw placement, and tail position.\n24\nTwo investigators trained in BMS evaluation at Ohio State University performed the BMS testing. The two examiners were blinded to the genotype of each animal. The BMS testing was performed before injury, at three and seven days post-injury, then weekly until four weeks post-injury. The BMS scores or subscores were averaged for left and right hindlimbs to obtain a value per mouse.\n12\n,\n24\n\nAssessment of tissue sparing\nAt four weeks post-injury, animals were euthanatized and transcardially perfused with ice-cold saline followed by phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Spinal cord blocks 2\u2009cm in length, centered at the lesion epicenter, were dissected, post-fixed in the same 4% PFA solution overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by submersion in 25% sucrose solution at 4\u00b0C to ensure cryoprotection. The spinal cords were cryosectioned serially at a thickness of 20\u2009\u03bcm. Each section was mounted onto gelatin-coated slides and stored at -20\u00b0C.\nA modified eriochrome cyanine staining protocol for myelin that differentiates both white matter and cell bodies was used to visualize spared spinal tissue. Area measurements in lesion, gray matter, white matter, and total spinal tissue and calculation of lesion volume, total tissue sparing, white matter sparing, and gray matter sparing in transverse sections of the injured cords were performed as described previously.\n6\n,\n7\n,\n22\n,\n25\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using StatView (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM), Group differences were evaluated by\nt\ntest, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), or repeated measures ANOVA, and Bonferroni\npost hoc\ntest.\n26\nNull hypotheses were rejected at the\np\n<\u20090.05 level. Although the Basso Mouse Scale is an ordinal scale, differences between the treatments were compared using parametric statistical methods recommended by Scheff and colleagues.\n27"

Thus, additional exclusion criteria included failure of one or more embedded and/or stand-alone measures suggestive of invalid neuropsychological or self-report data.\n\nMeasures\nTBI history\nA modified version of the Ohio State University TBI Identification screening instrument was employed to identify lifetime potential concussive events (PCEs).\n46\nPCE information was captured by asking participants to identify any time when their head or neck was injured or possibly injured. Mechanism of injury for each PCE was documented as blast related (e.g., improvised explosive device, landmine) or non-blast related (e.g., motor vehicle accident, fall). Each PCE was then interrogated by detailed structured interview, the Virginia Commonwealth University retrospective Concussion Diagnostic Interview (VCU rCDI), which contains an embedded algorithmic preliminary diagnosis based on the DoD/VA common definition of mTBI.\n47\nAs described in more detail elsewhere, further vetting of this algorithm against medical records and rCDI free-text content was performed at the site level, as well as centrally to determine a final diagnosis.\n47\nFor the purpose of this analysis, mTBI history was labeled dichotomously (yes/no) and continuously (i.e., number of mTBIs).\nObstructive sleep apnea risk\nA modified version of the STOP-BANG questionnaire was utilized for this study to avoid redundancy with other measures and minimize participant burden.\n48\nSpecifically, items from the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index\n49\nquestionnaire were used as proxies for the first two STOP items, \u201cSnoring\u201d and \u201cTired,\u201d and an item from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System\n50\nquestionnaire was used as a proxy for the last STOP item \u201cPressure\u201d (\nTable 1\n) to reduce participant burden. For the BANG portion, actual measurements were used for \u201cBody mass index\u201d and \u201cNeck\u201d size instead of self-report. The other items, \u201cage\u201d and \u201cgender,\u201d were captured from the demographics form, using self-identified sex for \u201cgender.\u201d Items are summed with higher scores conveying greater risk.\n48\nHigh risk was classified as STOP-BANG \u22653, consistent with published clinical guidelines.\n48\nConsidering the overrepresentation of males in the current sample, additional analyses also were conducted in which high risk was classified at STOP-BANG \u22654.\nTable 1.\nComparison of STOP-BANG Questions and those Administered as Part of the CENC Project\nQuestion number\nSTOP-BANG question\nCENC question\n1\nDo you SNORE loudly (louder than talking or loud enough to be heard through closed doors)?\nDuring the past month\n, how often have you had trouble sleeping because you cough or snore loudly?\n2\nDo you often feel TIRED, fatigued, or sleepy during daytime?\nDuring the past month\n, how often have you had trouble staying awake while driving, eating meals, or engaging in social activities?\n3\nHas anyone OBSERVED you stop breathing during your sleep?\nHas anyone observed you stop breathing during your sleep?\n4\nDo you have or are you being treated for high blood PRESSURE?\nHave you\nEVER been told\nby a doctor, nurse, or other health professional that you have high blood pressure?\nOpen in a separate window\nCENC, Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium.\nCognitive functioning\nMeasures examining cognitive domains most commonly impacted by OSA and mTBI were chosen for analyses from the larger neuropsychological battery. Brief descriptions of these measures are provided below with more thorough descriptions in\nTable 2\n.\n48\u201360\nMemory was dichotomized into verbal and visual domains. Verbal learning and memory were captured with the California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II).\n61\nVisual learning and memory were captured with the Brief Visual Memory Test-Revised.\n62\nProcessing speed was measured using the Trail Making Test A (TMT A)\n63\nfor simple processing speed and the Coding subtest of the\nWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Fourth Edition\n(WAIS-IV)\n64\nfor complex processing speed. Executive functioning was broken down into set-shifting, working memory, and mental inhibition. The Trail Making Test, part B (TMT B),\n63\nDigit Span Backwards subtest of the WAIS-IV, and Flanker Inhibitory Control Test of the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery\n65\nwere used to measure each ability respectively. Finally, the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI)\n60\n,\n66\ncognitive subscale was used to query self-reported post-concussive cognitive symptoms. Examination of effort includes use of the Medical Symptom Validity Test, Reliable Digit Span Index from the Digit Span Subtest of the WAIS-IV, and the Mild Brain Injury Atypical Symptoms addition to the NSI.\nTable 2.\nList and Description of Measures\nDomain\nMeasure\nDescription\nMemory\nCalifornia Verbal Learning Test\u2014II (CVLT-II)\nThe CVLT-II asks examinees to learn and remember a list of 16 words. It has been used to meaningfully differentiate between severities of TBI\n48\nand to demonstrate different types of memory impairments in TBI.\n49\nCVLT-II Long Delay Free Recall score was used for analyses. Scores range from 0 to 16, and a lower score indicates a deficit in verbal learning or memory.\nBrief Visual Memory Test\u2014Revised (BVMT-R)\nThe BVMT-R exposes examinees to 6 figures across 3 learning trials and later asks them to recall the figures from memory. The BVMT-R has been successfully used to evaluate cognitive deficits in neurological populations including concussions\n50\nand to predict recovery from mild TBI.\n51\n,\n52\nDelayed Recall scores were used for analysis. Scores range from 0 to 12, with lower score indicating poorer recall.\nExecutive functioning\nTrail Making Test B (TMT B)\nTMT B asks examinees to accurately switch between numbers and letters, in order, while visually scanning a page. TMT B has been shown to accurately classify cognitive deficit after mild TBI\n53\nand to predict decision-making capacity in among patients with TBI.\n54\nQuicker completion time (reported in raw seconds) denotes better cognitive inhibition.\nDigit Span Backwards subtest, WAIS-IV\nDigit Span Backwards asks examinees to hold and manipulate a string of numbers in working memory. There is strong support for the clinical utility of these and other WAIS-IV subtests in individuals with mild TBI.\n55\nTotal scores are reported, with higher scores indicating better working memory.\nFlanker test\nThis test measures to identify relevant and inhibit irrelevant information. A modified version of the original test, updated for the NIH toolbox was used with examinees. The NIH Toolbox has been validated for use in TBI.\n56\nThe computed score, ranging for 0\u201310 was used for analyses, with lower scores indicative of worse cognitive inhibition.\nProcessing Speed\nTrail Making Test A (TMT A)\nTMT A asks examinees to quickly scan and connect a series of numbered circles. TMT has been shown to accurately classify cognitive deficit after mild TBI\n53\nand to predict decision-making capacity in among patients with TBI.\n54\nQuicker completion time (reported in raw seconds) denotes faster simple processing speed.\nCoding subtest, WAIS-IV\nThe coding subtest of the WAIS-IV measures complex processing speed. Raw scores are reported, with higher numbers indicating faster processing speed.\nSelf-Report\nNeurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI)\n57\nThe NSI is broken down into 4 subscales, representing commonly reported symptoms following concussion: cognitive, affective, vestibular, and somatic. The cognitive subscale was used for analyses and scores range from 0\u20134. Higher numbers represent more symptoms endorsed.\nEffort\nMedical Symptom Validity Test (MSVT)\nThe MSVT is a short verbal memory test, utilizing a paired associated learning paradigm. Scores were considered unreliable if accuracy was less than 85%.\nWAIS-IV Reliable Digit Span\nReliable Digit Span is a composite of longest digit span forward + longest digit span backward, wherein both trials were accurate. Scores were considered unreliable if combined reliable digit span was less than 7.\nMild Brain Injury Atypical Symptoms (mBIAS)\nThe mBIAS is a subscale of the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory, which consists of atypical or rarely endorsed post-concussive symptoms. Reporting on this measure was considered unreliable if scores were \u22658.\nOpen in a separate window\nTBI, traumatic brain injury; WAIS-IV,\nWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 4th Edition.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics.\n67\nDescriptive statistics (percentages, means, quartiles) for participant, injury, and sleep apnea risk characteristics were used to describe participants retained in the analyses and those excluded. Chi-squared tests, Kruskal-Wallis Tests, and independent sample t-tests were used for comparing those retained and excluded. Multi-variate linear regression was used to evaluate the effect of OSA risk (continuous STOP-BANG score) after adjustment for mTBI status (dichotomous variable) and demographic variables known to affect cognitive performance (i.e., age, gender, race, education) across all cognitive performance and self-reported cognitive problems measures. Univariable linear regression also was calculated to permit examination of unadjusted effects for each predictor. Effects were reported as beta scores with confidence intervals. All statistical tests were two-sided tests of significance with an exploratory alpha level of 0.05."

The inclusion criteria for both groups was a baseline GI assessment and clinical concussion battery performed before participation in intercollegiate athletics. The exclusion criteria included a self-reported current lower-extremity injury, vestibular or neurological pathologies (aside from the current concussion), medication usage which affected balance, or if the participant suffered a substantial lower-extremity injury between the baseline and follow-up test. All participants provided written and oral informed consent as approved by the universities' institutional review board.\nTable 1.\nParticipant Demographics and Anthropometrics\nSex\nAge (years) (range)\nHeight (m) (range)\nMass (kg) (range)\nConcussion history\nLOC\nPTA\nConcussion (\nN\n=\u200927)\n15F/12M\n19.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\n(18\u201322)\n1.73\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13\n(1.50\u20132.01)\n78.8\u2009\u00b1\u200925.8\n(42.1\u2013144.1)\n52% (13/25)\n0.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\n4/25\n16.0%\n9/25\n36.0%\nControl (\nN\n=\u200927)\n15F/12M\n19.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\n(18\u201322)\n1.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\n(1.60\u20131.91)\n84.0\u2009\u00b1\u200923.8\n(53.2\u2013138.6)\n52% (13/25)\n0.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\nN/A\nN/A\nOpen in a separate window\nThere were no significant differences between groups for Age (\np\n=\u20090.223), Height (\np\n=\u20090.559), Weight (\np\n=\u20090.450), or number of previous concussions (\np\n=\u20091.000). The number of participants per sport was matched, and each group had 8 football, 6 women's basketball, 5 cheerleaders, 3 women's soccer, 2 men's soccer, 2 men's basketball, and 1 softball athlete(s). Note: LOC and PTA data were not available for 2 participants.\nLOC, loss of consciousness; PTA, post-traumatic amnesia; N/A, not applicable.\n\nInstrumentation\nThe GI trials were performed on four embedded force plates (Model OR-6; AMTI, Inc, Watertown, MA) mounted level with the laboratory floor along a 10-m walkway. Kinetic data were sampled at 1000\u2009Hz, and COP was calculated using standard biomechanical formulas.\n43\nThe clinical concussion assessment battery consisted of a self-report graded symptom checklist (GSC), the BESS, and the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Test (ImPACT) neurocognitive test. These assessments have been thoroughly described in the literature and, despite inconsistent test psychometrics, are extensively utilized in concussion management.\n8\u201310\n,\n22\n,\n44\n,\n45\n\nProcedures\nAll student-athletes performed the clinically required concussion battery before participation in intercollegiate athletics, and the research team recruited from this pool to also perform the optional gait-related assessments. After a diagnosed concussion, potential participants were recruited again to the gait-related aspect of the study. There were 106 concussions which occurred, of which 27 were included in this study because of exclusion criteria including delayed concussion reporting, declining to participate in the study, substantial injury (e.g., anterior cruciate ligament surgery) between baseline and concussion, not returning to sport (e.g., retiring, graduating before recover), or not completing all clinical milestone test dates. The BESS was administered by research staff members and videotaped to allow for subsequent scoring.\n23\nThe ImPACT neurocognitive test was administered in small groups, supervised by an athletic trainer, and all participants had valid baseline assessments based on the manufacturer's specifications. The GSC was administered by a research team member using an interview format which included 22 common concussion symptoms on a 0\u20136 scale (0\u2013132 possible \u201cscore\u201d). All assessments were performed based on the current SCAT guidelines, except that the full BESS (three stances in two conditions: firm and foam) was performed instead of the modified BESS.\n8\nAll participants performed five trials of GI beginning with a self-selected comfortable stance on two force plates, and their position was marked to maintain consistency across trials. For follow-up assessments, the participant's foot placement markings were retained across clinical milestone dates to ensure consistency and that the first step landed fully on the anteriorly adjacent force plate. In response to a verbal cue, participants stepped onto a third force plate and continued walking unobstructed for \u223c10\u2009m at a self-selected pace. Individuals were allowed to practice the task before data collection, and no participant took more than two practice trials.\nAfter a diagnosed concussion, participants were assessed within 24\u2009h on both the clinical concussion battery and GI. Participants then completed daily assessments of BESS and GSC until they equaled or improved upon their baseline performance as was common clinical practice at the time.\n9\n,\n10\nThe ImPACT test was administered approximately every 3 days, as per manufacturer recommendations, until the baseline performance was achieved on all four composite scores during the same assessment. These assessment time points were determined by the medical management and concussion protocols of the clinical staff independent of the research team and were reflective of earlier concussion management approaches.\n41\n,\n42\nOnce all assessments achieved baseline values and the participant self-reported asymptomatic (score of 0), they initiated a 6-day progressive exercise protocol, consistent with consensus guidelines, culminating with RTP after physician clearance.\n1\n,\n41\n,\n42\nIf a participant experienced symptom provocation during the progressive exercise protocol, the session was terminated and they restarted the following day at the previous step.\nThe concussion recovery protocol served to identify the timeline milestones in this study. Specifically, \u201cAcute\u201d refers to the initial assessment which occurred within 24\u2009h of injury. The \u201cBESS Day\u201d refers to the day at which the participant until achieved baseline or better values on the BESS. The same approach was utilized for \u201cImPACT Day\u201d (all four composite within reliable change index [RCI] of baseline) and \u201cAsymptomatic Day\u201d (self-report score of 0 regardless of baseline symptom value).\n9\n,\n10\nFinally, the day of unrestricted RTP was termed \u201cRTP Day.\u201d The participants performed the GI trials at each of these up to five milestones dates; typically, the same day, but always within 24\u2009h of the milestone being achieved. It is important to note there was no known practice effect or improvement from repeat performance in this task in otherwise healthy young adults, and the control group herein was highly consistent across test sessions.\n32\nGiven that participants could achieve baseline values on multiple assessments on the same day (e.g., both BESS and Symptom Free), not all participants (\nN\n=\u200911) completed five post-concussion test dates.\n\nData analysis\nThis was a prospective, longitudinal study, and the independent variables were group (Concussion vs. Control) the Time; the six assessment time points: 1) Baseline, 2) Acute, 3) BESS Day, 4) ImPACT Day, 5) Asymptomatic Day, and 6) RTP Day. As expected, clinical milestone dates frequently overlapped (e.g., baseline on both BESS and ImPACT on the same day), and the control participants test dates were matched accordingly.\nThe GI COP displacement was divided into three separate regions based on two landmarks in both the anterior/posterior (A/P) and medial/lateral (M/L) directions consistent with previous GI studies.\n32\u201334\nMovement initiation was determined by the first change (2 standard deviations [SDs] from the mean of the first 0.5\u2009sec) in ground reaction force and confirmed by COP displacement\n32\n,\n33\n(\nFig. 1\n). The first region, the APA phase, began with movement initiation and ended at landmark 1, the most posterior and lateral position of the COP toward the initial swing limb. The second region, the transitional phase, represents the transition of the COP from the initial swing limb to the initial stance limb and ends at landmark 2, when the COP begins to move forward under the initial stance limb. The final region represents the locomotor phase, and it is defined by the anterior progression of the COP under the stance limb until toe-off. The primary GI outcome measures were the displacement and velocity of the COP in the A/P and M/L directions during the APA phase.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExemplar center of pressure displacements. A/P, anterior/posterior; APA, anticipatory postural adjustment; COP, center of pressure; M/L, medial/lateral; RTP, return to participation.\nThe initial GI step characteristics of step length and step velocity were also calculated. Initial step length was calculated as the sagittal distance between the initial position of the COP at movement initiation and its position at the foot-off time of the trailing stance foot.\n46\nThe mean initial step velocity was calculated as the first step displacement divided by the time from movement initiation to the initial heel strike on the subsequent force plate.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive characteristics were calculated (mean and SD) for participant characteristics, the time until baseline for each of the five milestone days (Acute, BESS, ImPACT, and Asymptomatic days and RTP), and the GI outcome measures. The data were normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk, >0.05). Because this study aimed to identify changes in the APA phase of GI, only the APA phase COP displacement and velocity were analyzed along with the initial step length and velocity. A 2 (group)\u2009\u00d7\u20096 (milestone) repeated-measures mixed model was performed on each of the six outcome measures (APA A/P displacement and velocity, APA M/L displacement and velocity, initial step length, and velocity) to account for overlapping data points.\n47\nThe repeated covariance type was compound symmetry, which minimized the Akaike's information criterion. Significant interactions were followed up with pair-wise comparison within group compared to baseline (e.g., Acute vs. Baseline, RTP vs. Baseline) to address the primary aim of the study. Pair-wise comparison was also performed between groups at each clinical milestone (e.g., between groups at Acute). Cohen's\nd\ndffect sizes were calculated for all significant pair-wise comparisons categorized as small effect (0.20), medium effect (0.50), and large effect (>0.80). The \u03b1 level was set at 0.05 for COP displacements, velocity; however, because initial step length and velocity are not independent of each other, a Bonferroni correction was applied and the \u03b1 value was corrected to 0.025 for these two variables.\nTo identify the percentage of participants who demonstrated postural control persistent impairments, an RCI was calculated for each of the six dependent variables (APA A/P displacement and velocity, APA M/L displacement and velocity, initial step length, and initial step velocity). The calculated healthy control participants' first two test sessions were used to calculate the 80% and 95% RCI values using standard formulas.\n48"

Blood measures that had been assessed in less than 50% of the patient cohort were excluded. The remaining blood measures included adjusted calcium estimate, alkaline phosphatase, C-reactive protein (CRP), hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin, mean cell volume, mononucleocytes, platelets, potassium, red blood count, red blood distance width, and white blood count (WBC). Routine blood analyses were conducted in the Hematology and Biochemistry department located at the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopedic Hospital. Hematology analyses were performed on either a Beckman Coulter LH-500 (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe) or a Sysmex XN-1000 (Sysmex America, IL). Biochemical analyses used VITROS slides (dry multi-layered chemistry slides) in conjunction with the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, NJ) to measure albumin, ALT, calcium, creatinine, GGT, potassium, magnesium, sodium, total bilirubin, total protein, and urea.\nIn addition to AIS overall grade, AIS motor, sensory touch, and sensory pin prick scores were recorded at admission, discharge (mean 136 days post-injury \u00b172), and approximately 12 months post-injury (mean 424 days post-injury \u00b1147). SCIM-III assessments also were recorded at these same time-points.\n24\nThe SCIM assessment is a disability scale developed to quantify the ability of SCI patients to perform basic activities of independent daily living, including self-care (feeding, bathing, and dressing), respiration and sphincter management, and mobility (\nFig. 1\n).\n25\n,\n26\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nBoxplots of American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) score change from admission. SCIM, Spinal Cord Independence Measure.\nAdditional information that may impact neurological recovery and/or the assessed blood measures were included. The incidence of diabetes (types I and II), smoking, and alcohol drinking status were recorded as binary. The neurological level of the injury was recorded as being cervical, thoracic, lumbar, or sacral. Details were recorded as to whether the injury was traumatic, and whether there were any fractures at the injury site. Age at injury in years, gender, and the time between injury and the first blood tests in days also were included. Medications that patients were prescribed also were collected; however, after filtering to drugs at least 50% of patients were given, the remaining drugs were either painkillers or anti-spasm medication. As the inclusion of these drug data would have added a large number of variables to the model and they correlated strongly with initial injury severity, these data were not included in the modeling process.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData analyses were performed with the statistical programming language R version 3.6.3 (2020-02-29).\n27\u201340\nMissing blood measures were median imputed, then scaled and centered. Less than 21% of the initial and discharge AIS/SCIM scores were missing, whereas 50-60% of the 12-month scores were missing (\nSupplementary Table S1\n). These missing AIS grades or scores were imputed with either last observation carried forwards (LOCF) or next observation carried backwards (NOCB) where relevant. LOCF and NOCB were used as it is unusual for AIS or SCIM scores to have decreased over time in SCI patients. These scores typically only either remain largely unchanged, or improve with time.\n41\nTherefore, the use of this imputation effectively assumes that in cases of missing score data, the patients' score did not change. This assumption can only worsen model performance, as opposed to giving rise to the overly optimistic models that could be generated by more complex multiple imputation techniques. Additionally, we have been advised that most cases where neurological assessment was missing at admission or discharge is due to a transition from Frankel scoring to AIS. In the case of missing 12-month assessments, this is most commonly due to a given patient not attending their appointment or having received follow up from a different hospital (\nSupplementary Table S1\n).\nAs the number of model features was relatively high compared with the number of observations (45 features and 417 observations), linear regression with elastic net penalization was performed in addition to linear regression without any penalization. Elastic net penalization is a hybrid of ridge regression (whereby the penalty term shrinks predictor effect equally and never to 0), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, whereby the penalty term shrinks each predictor differently and allows variables to be removed entirely by shrinking coefficients to 0.\n42\n,\n43\nPut simply, elastic net reduces the impact of less important model features and can effectively eliminate features entirely, thus performing variable selection during the model building process, as opposed to other methods such as backward variable selection, which are conducted before model building and eliminate features based on co-linearity. Elastic net penalization has been previously found to perform well in models with numerous predictors and in the presence of correlated predictors.\n44\nEight independent models were generated, with and without elastic net penalization, to determine if the features could predict four outcome measures AIS motor, AIS sensor touch, AIS sensor prick, and SCIM, at two time-points: discharge and 12 months post-injury. The data were randomly split 80-20%, whereupon 80% was used for training the model and the remaining 20% was used to test the model's performance. To reduce model overfitting, internal validation was performed by 10-fold cross-validation.\n45"

Animals were observed post-op, where they were kept on a heating pad and body temperature was controlled with a rectal probe, where it was maintained at 37\u00b0C, in our operation room and then transferred to the animal quarters.\nMice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (intraperitoneal). A 5-mm crainiotomy was performed over the right parietotemporal cortex. TBI was performed using a controlled cortical impact (CCI) model, as previously described.\n24\u201326\nInjury was induced using the ECCI-6.3 device (Custom Design & Fabrication, Richmond, VA) at 6-m/s velocity, 0.8-mm depth, and 150-ms impact duration.\n27\nAnimals were euthanized at 24\u2009h after TBI. Sham animals were anesthetized and subjected to the same pre-surgical incision as injured animals.\n\nEnoxaparin treatment\nDosing was based on previous studies using enoxaparin in CCI-injured animals.\n19\nUsing a 0.5-mL syringe enoxaparin or vehicle control was administered intravenously by tail-vein injection 30\u2009min post-TBI (\nFig. 1\n). In order to perform tail vein injections, the mouse cage was placed on a heating pad without a top and under a lamp for 15\u2009min to dilate the vein. Mice were restrained in a coned tail vein injection apparatus. The tail was sprayed with 70% ethanol, and 200\u2009\u03bcL was injected into the vein. To obtain blinding, the treatment bottles were masked with opaque tape. A research assistant, who was not responsible for delivery of treatment and data analysis, performed randomization to the study groups. Lung and brain tissues were collected 24\u2009h after injection for analysis.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nCaspase-1 and IL-1\u00df expression in mice brain tissue is reduced after treatment with enoxaparin (ENOX) post-TBI.

Mice were euthanized at 24\u2009h post-TBI. All animals were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine, before perfusion. Animals were then placed on a surgical platform, and their limbs were taped in order to expose the thorax. An incision was made below the ribs to cut the diaphragm and remove the front rib cage. One side of the chest wall was retracted laterally, and the pleura was bluntly dissected to free up the lung. Next, the chest wall was cut vertically along the spinal processes and then repeated for the other half of the chest wall. Using a silk thread, the right lung was tied off at the right bronchiole and then was excised and separated into two sections.\nThe gravity perfusion mechanism was prepared using a 50-mL syringe, stopcock, tubing, and catheter with the syringe bottom being 10 inches above the table (10\u2009mm Hg of pressure). Lungs were then fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C. Fixed lung tissues were paraffin embedded, and 5-\u03bcm sections were processed. The left lung was used for tissue collection and flash-frozen for protein isolation. Animals then underwent decapitation, and ipsilateral cortical tissue was collected for protein isolation and molecular analyses.\n\nImmunoblotting\nLung and brain tissue samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Two-millimeter sections of right lower lung and right cortical tissue were homogenized in lysis buffer (20\u2009mM of Tris [pH 7.5], 150\u2009mM of NaCl, 1mM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5\u2009mM of pyruvic acid, 1\u2009mM of \u03b2-glycerophosphate, and 130\u2009mM KCl), containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and resolved in 4\u201320% Tris-TGX Criterion gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), using antibodies to caspase-1 (catalog no.: NB100-56565, 1:1000; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) and IL-1\u03b2 (catalog no.: 12242S, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA). Chemiluminescent quantification was performed using Image Lab (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and all data were normalized to \u03b2-actin (catalog no.: A5441, 1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich).\n\nLung injury scoring\nLung tissue sections were stained by a standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) method for histology, morphometry, and ALI scoring. Lung sections were scored by a pathologist using the ALI Scoring System from the ATS Workshop Report 28. Slides for evaluation were prepared from inflated (20\u2009cm of H\n2\nO), formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue that had been stained with H&E. Histological sections demonstrated evidence of diffuse lung injury, which was heterogenous in severity. Some areas showed mild injury whereas other areas showed more-severe damage. Therefore, the lung tissue sections were taken in a random fashion from different parts of the lung.\nAt least 20 random high-power fields were independently scored in a blinded fashion and are representative of lung injury. Sections were given a score (from 1 to 5) for the following five parameters defined by the ALI Scoring System from the ATS Workshop Report: 1) number of neutrophils in the alveolar space, 2) number of neutrophils in the interstitial space, 3) hyaline membrane thickening, 4) proteinaceous debris filling in the airspaces, and 5) alveolar septal thickening.\n28\nFinal ALI score was determined by using the following formula: Score\u2009=\u2009[(20\u2009\u00d7\u2009A) + (14\u2009\u00d7\u2009B) + (7\u2009\u00d7\u2009C) + (7\u2009\u00d7\u2009D) + (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009E)]/(number of fields\u2009\u00d7\u2009100).\n28\n\nAssessments of lung inflammation\nImmunostaining with Mac3, a macrophage marker, was performed, and the numbers of Mac3-positive cells in the alveolar airspaces were counted in 10 random images on each lung section for determining macrophage infiltration. To assess neutrophil infiltration, immunostaining with an anti-neutrophil elastase antibody was performed. Infiltrated neutrophils were counted from 10 random images on each lung section. The following primary antibodies were used in immunostaining: anti-Mac-3 (macrophage; catalog no.: 51-2200; 1:2000; ThermoFisherScientific, Waltham, MA) and antineutrophil elastase (catalog no.: MAB91671-100; 1:2000; Novus Biologicals). Slides containing tissue sections were heated for 2\u2009h and were then deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated through the following graded ethanol steps in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Next, slides were placed in a Coplin jar with 50\u2009mL of citric buffer (10-mM sodium citric solution, adjusted pH to 6.0 with 10\u2009mM of citric acid) and pressurized for antigen retrieval. After blocking for 1\u2009h, sections (3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline slides) were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C.\nThe next day, slides were washed in PBS (3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min) and then incubated with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 1\u2009h. Slides were then washed in PBS (3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min) and mounted with Vectorshield. The numbers of Mac3-positive cells in the alveolar airspaces were counted in 10 random images on each lung section for determining macrophage infiltration. Infiltrated neutrophils were counted from 10 random images on each lung section."

    "Methods": "In developing the proposed sliding scoring system for the GOS-E, it is worth noting how the dichotomy has been defined for the BOOST-3 and HOBIT studies. As shown inTable 1, favorable and poor outcome are defined based on the probability of poor outcome using the baseline IMPACT score and the GOS-E score at six months post-injury. To prospectively define these prognosis categories, and corresponding favorable outcome definitions, during the BOOST-3 design phase, data from the completed trial of progesterone in TBI10(ProTECT III) was used. The ProTECT III methods and results have been published previously.\n\nBriefly, subjects with TBI were randomized to receive progesterone or placebo (1:1) and followed for six months to ascertain the GOS-E. The IMPACT Core Model11was applied to the subset of ProTECT control subjects with ICP data, and the resulting predicted probabilities were categorized in deciles. Within each decile, favorable outcome thresholds were chosen to achieve an approximate 50% favorable outcome classification; the resulting categories and thresholds were then revised to achieve a more logical and clinically relevant definition.\n\nAs illustrated in this table, a limitation of the sliding dichotomy is that although it tailors the definition of favorable outcome according to injury severity, all scores meeting the criteria of favorable outcome are considered equal. As an extreme example, for a subject having high probability of poor outcome (>0.56), an outcome at six months of upper severe disability is considered equally favorable as an outcome of upper good recovery. From a clinical and statistical perspective, this represents a loss of information as a GOS-E of 8 is clearly more favorable than 4, and all TBI patients and clinicians would assign higher utility to the near perfect outcome.\n\nA potential solution to this limitation of the sliding dichotomy is to score the GOS-E as the distance from the cutoff for favorable/poor outcome as shown inTable 2. Unlike the sliding dichotomy, the sliding score treats all favorable outcome values differently\u2014that is, a trial participant who recovers to upper good recovery receives one point more than a subject with lower good recovery. At the extreme, for a subject with high probability of poor outcome (>0.56), an outcome of upper good recovery scores four points more than an outcome of upper severe disability.\n\nThis sliding scoring system leads to a better representation of the magnitude of change; it reflects the movement along the scale and also allows those more grossly affected potentially to contribute more to the primary outcome. This scoring system yields a range from \u22125 to +4 and approximates a continuous outcome that reflects differences between GOS-E levels more precisely than the sliding dichotomy. The primary statistical analysis of the sliding score for a two-arm clinical trial would be a two-samplettest. In the HOBIT trial, which involves eight arms, the primary model would remain a Bayesian hierarchical EMAX dose-response model but with a normal distribution model."

    "Methods": "The Football Players Health Study sought to enroll former players who participated in the National Football League (NFL) since 1960, the year the transition to helmets with hard plastic shells was essentially complete. We obtained home or e-mail addresses from the NFL Players Association for 14,906 players, of which 2415 were invalid or inactive. The remaining 12,491 players were mailed or e-mailed a questionnaire. At the time of this analysis, 3913 players had responded. The study was approved by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Review Boards. Participants provided informed consent.\n\nMeasures\nThe short form of the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders, Applied Cognition-General Concerns (Neuro-QOL) was used to assess cognition-related QOL.\n20\nEight items queried past seven-day cognitive difficulties (e.g., \u201cI had to read something several times to understand it\u201d). Response options were: 0: never, 1: rarely (once), 2: sometimes (2\u20133 times), 3: often (once/day), or 4: very often (several times/day). Responses were summed to create a continuous measure. A United States (US) population sample (N\u2009=\u20091109) was used to create standardized T-scores with mean\u2009=\u200950 and standard deviation (SD)\u2009=\u200910.\n20\nBased on published guidelines, we created an indicator of \u201cmoderate or severe symptoms or impairment\u201d using a score \u226440, which corresponds to \u22641 SD below the US population mean.\n21\nThe short form had excellent internal consistency in our data (Cronbach alpha\u2009=\u20090.97). Ten men did not respond to Neuro-QOL questions and were excluded from analyses.\nWe queried 10 football-related concussion symptoms during playing years with, \u201cWhile playing or practicing football, did you experience a blow to the head, neck, or upper body followed by: headaches, nausea, dizziness, loss of consciousness, memory problems, disorientation, confusion, seizure, visual problems, and feeling unsteady on your feet.\u201d Response options for each symptom were: no, once, 2\u20135, 6\u201310, or 11+ times. We coded these as 0, 1, 3.5, 8, and 13 and calculated the mean across all 10 items. We calculated quartiles of the concussion score. Men who did not respond to the concussion symptom questions (N\u2009=\u2009104) were excluded from analyses.\nPotentially modifiable cognitive risk factors\nThe Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-4 assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety. Responses were summed separately for depression and anxiety and dichotomized per scoring recommendations to indicate high depressive symptoms or high anxiety symptoms. In a meta-analysis of four studies, the recommended cutoff had sensitivity\u2009=\u20090.76 and specificity\u2009=\u20090.81.\n22\n,\n23\nPain interference in daily life was measured with the six-item Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pain interference scale (e.g., \u201cIn the past 7 days, how much did pain interfere with your enjoyment of life?\u201d). Physical functioning in daily life was measured with the six-item PROMIS physical functioning scale (e.g., \u201cAre you able to go up and down stairs at a normal pace?\u201d). Moderate or severe impairment related to pain or physical functioning was defined according to published guidelines as \u22651 SD below the US population mean.\n24\nCurrent exercise was queried with the average number of hours spent each week walking, jogging, running, in other aerobic activity (e.g., bicycling), low intensity exercise (e.g., yoga), and weight training. Response options for each type of exercise included zero, <1, 1\u20135, 6\u201310, or >10\u2009h. We combined jogging, running, and other aerobic activity as \u201chigh intensity.\u201d In addition, we calculated metabolic equivalent task hours (METS) per week and divided this measure into quartiles for analysis. Men in the lowest quartile did very little exercise (median\u2009=\u20091.5 mets/week, equivalent to walking 0.5\u2009h/week), while men in the highest quartile did substantial exercise (median\u2009=\u200948 mets/week, equivalent to running 6\u2009h/week).\nCurrent smoking, weight, and height, and medical provider recommendation or prescription of medication for high blood pressure, heart failure, heart rhythm problems, and diabetes were by self-report. We calculated body mass index (BMI) from self-reported weight and height, and created an indicator for class 2 (\u201cmoderate-risk,\u201d BMI 35 to 39.9\u2009kg/m\n2\n) or class 3 (\u201chigh-risk,\u201d BMI \u226540.0\u2009kg/m\n2\n) obesity.\n25\nLifetime medical provider's diagnosis of stroke, heart attack, and sleep apnea was by self-report, as was heart surgery (bypass, angioplasty, or stent placement). Heavy drinking was defined as \u226514 drinks/week. Participants were asked how many hours of sleep they get on an average weekday. Low sleep duration was defined as <5\u2009h/night\n7\n. Race/ethnicity was coded as: Black, White, or other races. Age at questionnaire was in years.\n\nAnalyses\nWe examined the prevalence of cognitive risk factors by football-related concussion symptoms. We calculated the association of each cognitive risk factor with moderate or severe impairment in cognition-related QOL by fitting models with cognition-related QOL as the dependent variable and each risk factor as the independent variable in separate models, adjusted for age at questionnaire and race/ethnicity. As poor cognition-related QOL and cognitive risk factors (e.g., pain) may be associated because they are common sequelae of concussion, we further adjusted for concussion symptoms in each model, including squared and cubed terms, because this was the best-fitting model by quasi-likelihood under the independence model criterion (QIC).\n26\nWe estimated risk ratios with PROC GENMOD (SAS 9.4), using the modified Poisson regression.\n27\nThe prevalence of potentially modifiable or treatable cognitive risk factors among the healthy concussed was compared with the unhealthy concussed (men who experienced the highest quartile of concussion symptoms during their playing career and either did not report or did report current impairment in cognition-related QOL). Similarly, we examined the prevalence of cognitive risk factors among men in the study who experienced the\nfewest\nconcussion symptoms during their playing career (the lowest quartile), separately examining men with and without impairment in cognition-related QOL. In addition we conducted a sensitivity analysis restricted to men age 35 years or younger at the time of the questionnaire, who may have had more accurate recall of their concussion exposure during their playing years than older men in the study."

    "Methods": "The study cohort utilized data from the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry (RHSCIR), which prospectively enrolled adults who were admitted with a new acute tSCI to one of the 18 acute and 12 rehabilitation facilities across Canada. The registry was initiated in 2004 to answera prioriresearch questions and to facilitate implementation of best practices. All RHSCIR sites obtained local research ethics board approval prior to enrolling participants, and data sharing agreements are in place with each site. Details on the RHSCIR data set have been described elsewhere.31\n\nAnalysis cohort\nIndividuals eligible for this study were patients who were admitted to a RHSCIR acute facility with a reported injury date between May 2004 and February 2017, were \u226565 years of age, and had neurological deficit as described by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) (AIS A\u2013D) affecting any neurological level from C1 to L1 identified at admission using the International Standards for the Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI).\n32\n\nStudy variables\nThe main outcome of the study was in-hospital mortality (yes; no) in the acute or rehabilitation facility during the initial in-patient stay. Patient factors considered were age at time of injury (65\u201376; \u226577 for surgical cohort, 65\u201379; \u226580 for non-surgical cohort), sex (female; male), and pre-existing medical comorbidities assessed by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The CCI includes 19 diseases weighted on their seriousness, and is commonly used to predict mortality over 5 years for hospitalized patients.\n33\nInjury factors examined were injury mechanism (falls, sports, transport, other), AOSpine Trauma Classification Systems for subaxial cervical (C3-C7)\n34\nand thoracolumbar (T1-L5)\n35\nspine (Type A, Type B, Type C), Injury Severity Score (ISS) (\u226425; >25 indicative of major trauma to region in addition to the spine),\n36\nneurological severity (AIS A, B, C, D) and neurological level at admission (high cervical, C1-C4; low cervical, C5-T1; thoracolumbar, T2-L1). Neurological data as classified by the ISNCSCI was collected and verified using the validated Rick Hansen Institute ISNCSCI Algorithm (v1.0.3)\n37\nto ensure that severity and level were derived accurately from the raw ISNCSCI data. Care management factors included were triage pattern from injury to RHSCIR acute facility (directly, via another facility), time from injury to arrival at RHSCIR acute facility (\u226412\u2009h, >12\u2009h), had surgery or not, time from injury to start time of surgical decompression where applicable (\u226424\u2009h, >24\u2009h), days in ICU, had received a tracheostomy (yes, no), ventilation (yes, no), and PEG tube (yes, no).\nTime from injury/surgery to death (days), acute length of stay (LOS), and discharge destination from initial in-patient stay (acute or rehabilitation care) were also reported.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to describe the patient, injury, and care management factors of the cohort. Further analysis was performed to compare those who survived with those who did not in both the \u201csurgical\u201d and the \u201cnon-surgical\u201d groups, to explore factors associated with in-hospital mortality. The comparison was made using the\nt\ntest or the Wilcoxon rank sum test for normally distributed or non-normally distributed continuous variables, respectively; if the expected cell counts were five or less, \u03c7\n2\ntest or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables. Data visualization was performed to understand the pattern of age and time to death for in-hospital mortality and to determine any threshold of these two variables to inform the logistical regression modeling. To determine the impact of risk factors on in-hospital mortality, logistical regression model was performed adjusting for potential confounding variables that are deemed clinically relevant and informed by the literature. Variables examined were age at injury, neurological injury severity and level, comorbidities, and ventilation dependence. Status on tracheostomy and PEG were considered clinically relevant but were omitted from the model because they were not significant in the final model and also because they were related to ventilation status, which would cause collinearity in the model. For the surgical group, the model included only patients who died before the threshold (50 days post-surgery), to have a homogenous sample. A similar threshold was not used for the non-surgical group given the smaller sample size. Using the parameter estimates from the final model, expected probabilities of in-hospital mortality were obtained for several scenarios of different patient characteristics. Goodness-of-fit tests were performed for all regression models. Associations with a\np\nvalue <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SAS software, Version 9.4 of the SAS System for Windows. \u00a92013, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA."

    "Methods": "This was a prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of patients with mTBI referred to a level 1 trauma center.\n\nParticipants\nFifteen mTBI patients were studied \u223c1 month after injury and compared with 17 healthy controls. mTBI diagnosis was established using American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine criteria.\n31\nPatients were excluded if they had a history of other neurological disorders, significant systemic medical illness, or current\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, Fourth edition\n(DSM-IV) Axis I diagnosis, based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV.\n32\nHealthy controls were recruited through advertisements and were screened for neurological, medical, or any past or current psychiatric illness. Written informed consent was obtained, and all study procedures were institutional review board (IRB)-approved.\n\nStudy protocol\nWe have previously published our findings regarding bromocriptine\n19\nand guanfacine\n33\nrelative to placebo. Here we compare WM performance and fMRI activation patterns in a subset of participants in our prior study\n19\nwho received both bromocriptine and pergolide. In brief, participants were studied on three occasions roughly 1 week apart as part of a larger study in which each individual received placebo, bromocriptine, and either guanfacine or pergolide in a randomized, counterbalanced order. Order of neuropsychological and fMRI task administration, using alternate forms when available, was also counterbalanced.\nParticipants had a line for intravenous access placed and had blood samples drawn (baseline and 1, 2, 3, and 4\u2009h after medication/placebo ingestion) to determine serial serum prolactin levels. Blood was collected in serum separator tubes and immediately sent to the laboratory. After clotting, samples were centrifuged at 3000\u2009rpm and then immediately frozen and stored at -80\u00b0C until ready for assay. The prolactin assay is based on a solid-phase, two-site chemiluminescent immunometric format performed on the Immulite analyzer (Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA). Dopamine agonists result in decreased release of prolactin, which serves as an indicator of central dopaminergic effect.\nParticipants ingested identical-appearing capsules containing placebo, 1.25\u2009mg bromocriptine, or 0.05\u2009mg pergolide. Participants and staff were blind to medication condition, and drug and placebo presentation order was counterbalanced. MRI scanning was conducted 2.5\u20133\u2009h after drug or placebo ingestion, and neuropsychological testing was conducted after scan completion.\n\nImaging\nAll scans were acquired using the same GE Horizon 1.5T LX scanner. A gradient echo, echo-planar sequence was used to provide whole brain coverage: repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20092500\u2009ms, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u200940\u2009ms, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u200924\u2009cm, number of excitations (NEX)\u2009=\u20091, 29 5\u2009mm thick sagittal slices with no skip, yielding a 64 x 64 matrix with 3.75\u2009mm\n2\nin-plane resolution. Participants were positioned in the scanner using laser alignment beams, and a non-magnetic deformable foam head holder to stabilize head position. Noise level was attenuated with specialized headphones (Resonance Technology, Van Nuys, CA). Stimuli for the n-back task were programmed in Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Albany, CA) and presented visually through an MRI compatible goggle system (Resonance Technology, Van Nuys, CA).\n\nfMRI task\nParticipants performed a visual-verbal n-back task presented in a four-condition, blocked design with variable processing load requirements (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back conditions). Each n-back condition was presented in 27-sec epochs preceded by 3\u2009sec of instruction (e.g., \u201cthe match is D\u201d or \u201cthe match is one back\u201d). Each task condition was presented three times in pseudo-random order (12 epochs total). Participants viewed a string of consonant letters (except L, W, and Y) presented at a rate of one every 3\u2009sec. For each stimulus, participants used a button press device (Photon Control, Burnaby, BC) to signify whether the current letter was a match (i.e., was the same as the designated target or the letter presented 1, 2, or 3 \u201cback\u201d in the sequence, depending on the condition instructions) or was a non-match. The number of correct and incorrect responses was recorded, along with reaction times. During each epoch there was a possibility of two or three matches and the number of matches was counterbalanced within and across conditions. In addition, non-target recurrences were presented as foils (e.g., a 2-back match during the 3-back condition).

    "Methods": "The animals used for this study (n=\u200912) were 6-month-old female YMPs with weights of 20\u201330\u2009kg, purchased from Sinclair BioResources (Auxvasse, Missouri). Females were used because of ease of bladder catherization and care relative to males in anticipation of their use in SCI studies. This study was approved by the University of Louisville (UofL) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted in accordance with theGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th edition.42The UofL animal care program is accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Environmental housing conditions were 72\u00b0F (22.2\u00b0C), 30\u201370% humidity, with 10\u201315 fresh air changes per hour, and a 12:12-h light/dark cycle. Animals were housed socially in floor pens with 5\u201310\u2009cm of Cellu-nest\u2122 bedding (Shepherd Specialty Papers, Watertown, TN) on top of 0.95-cm-thick 1.22\u2009\u00d7\u20091.22\u2009m interlocking Rubber Gym Tiles (Rubber Flooring Inc., Mesa, AZ) and provided with environmental enrichment, including toys and videos. Pigs were fed a standard laboratory mini-pig grower diet (5081; LabDiet, St. Louis, MO) and received filtered tap water.\n\nUpon arrival, pigs were acclimated for 7 days (not including the day of arrival). During this period, the trainer spent 15\u2009min per day in the animal's pen. This period each day allowed pigs to become acclimated to the trainer, which included hand feeding a portion of their ration the last 2 days of acclimation.\n\nTraining\nOnce the animals were released from quarantine, they began positive reinforcement training or clicker training.\n83\u201386\nTraining consisted of three to four 10- to 20-min sessions for a maximum of 1\u2009h per day for 3 weeks. All animals acclimated well to training. Each was trained to complete multiple tasks and achieve the end goal of walking in a straight line on the treadmill (PetRun PR720E modified with a clear 0.32-cm-thick polycarbonate panel in the front that has an 8.89-cm target centered with adjustable heights) while holding their snout against a target (\nTable 1\n). First, using a SunGrow dog clicker (Luffy Pets Collection, Traverse City, MI), the pigs were conditioned to recognize that a click meant they would receive a reward (daily food rations were used as the reward). This pairing conditioned the click as the reinforcement for the desired behaviors. Next, they were trained to recognize a given name so the trainer could get their attention on cue. After that, animals were trained to touch and hold their snouts to a Karen Pryor buoy target (Karen Pryor Clicker Training, Watham, MA) for up to 1\u2009min as well as follow the target while walking.\nTable 1.\nTasks or Behaviors in Sequential Order and the Shaping for Each Task\n\u201cCharging the Clicker\u201d\n1. During first training session, allow the animals to acclimate to the training room until they appear comfortable.\n2. Click the clicker and immediately reward the animal. The goal is for the pig to understand that click means reward.\n3. After clicking and rewarding (C&R) the animal several times, start having the animal look for or move to get the reward instead of immediately presenting the reward after the click.\n4. Next, allow the pig's attention to be focused on something other than the trainer and then click the animal. Once the pig immediately turns and looks for the treat, when clicked the clicker is charged.\nName Cue\n1. Get the pig to look up at you and then C&R. Trainer can accomplish this by using his or her hand to get the animal's attention and then bringing it up toward his or her face.\n2. After the trainer can repeatedly get the animal to look up at him or her, say the pig's designated name que while it's looking up and then C&R.\n3. Once the pig regularly looks up at the trainer when its name is said, allow the pig to wander away or have its attention elsewhere and then give name cue. When the animal responds to the name by looking up or turning around, immediately C&R.\n4. Finally, the trainer needs to allow the animal to walk away or walk away from the animal and say its name. When the animal starts walking back toward the trainer, he or she should C&R. Continue with several repetitions until behavior is instant and consistent.\nTarget Training\n1. Present target, and when pig touches target with snout, C&R.\n2. Once animal touches target, as soon as target is presented add the cue \u201cTouch.\u201d\n3. Name cue can be added as well \u201cName of animal and touch.\u201d\n4. Repeat until animal touches target instantly and consistently on cue.\nHold the Target\n1. Give touch cue and allow the pig to touch the target with its snout for at least 2\u2009sec, then C&R.\n2. Continue giving touch cue while having the animal touch the target with its snout for longer periods of time before C&R.\n3. Once the pig holds the target for 5\u201310\u2009sec, only click and treat when it is standing completely still.\n4. When the pig holds the target while remaining still for 5\u2009sec, add \u201cStay\u201d cue. Say touch and when the pig touches, say \u201cStay.\u201d Only C&R when the animal holds completely still while touching the target.\n5. Repeat touch and stay cue and continually have the animal stay for longer periods of time before C&R (minimum of 15\u2009sec before moving on).\nWalk Cue\n1. Give touch cue with target at your side, then stay cue when animal touches target. Walk away with target at your side, and if the animal follows it, C&R.\n2. Repeat several times having the pig walk further each time before C&R. (Do not C&R if pig is rooting at target.)\n3. Once the pig walks the length of the training room following the target without rooting at it, add \u201cWalk\u201d cue after \u201cStay\u201d cue and before you take off walking.\nTreadmill\n1. Have the animal touch the target and stay lined up so it can walk up onto the treadmill. Give walk cue and lead the pig up on the treadmill. C&R when animal steps onto the treadmill.\n2. After the pig gets on and off of the treadmill without hesitation, have it touch target on the front panel of the treadmill, then C&R.\n3. Train the animal to hold the target on the treadmill the same way you trained it to hold target using the cue \u201cHold\u201d instead of stay.\n4. Acclimate the animal to the treadmill by turning the treadmill on and walking the pig around the treadmill following the target while C&R until it appears comfortable.\n5. Once it is comfortable with treadmill running, have the pig touch and hold the target while the treadmill is off. Turn the treadmill on and give walk cue. If the animal takes a step or two, click and treat while turning the treadmill back off. If the animal does not take a step, repeat the process until it does and then C&R. Do not allow the pig to fall off the treadmill if it is not stepping right away. Shape the pig's behavior to walk straight in the middle of the treadmill while holding the target without rooting at it for at least 10 contiguous steps.\nOpen in a separate window\nThe tasks are trained in the order found to have the most success, and it is important not to move to the next task until the animal has learned the previous one.\nPigs were then acclimated to the sound of the treadmill and the movement of the belt. Once acclimated to the treadmill, the animals were trained to walk while holding their snouts against the target mounted on the front of the treadmill. Rewards were delivered through an opening in the panel, located just above the target. Their behavior was then shaped to step in the center of the treadmill while keeping their body straight for up to 1\u2009min (30\u201360 contiguous steps). Next, a platform was placed across the treadmill and the animals were conditioned to stand with their forelimbs on the platform while performing bipedal stepping with their hindlimbs. Filming took place once the pigs could perform each task consistently. Typically, it took 45\u2009min to an hour per day for 2 weeks for a pig's performance to be consistent.\n\nFilming\nThe day before filming, while pigs were standing and holding their snout on a target, a red Sharpie\n\u00ae\nwas used to mark the skin overlying the tuber coxae (C), greater trochanter (G), tibiotarsal joint (T), and metatarsophalangeal joint (M) of each hindlimb. On the day of filming, 0.95-cm-diameter, spherical, reflective markers were placed over the eight Sharpie\n\u00ae\nmarks placed the day before (\nFig. 1\n). Spherical markers were used because they tracked more consistently in these positions. Additionally, 1.27-cm-diameter reflective markers were placed on each hoof with one edge of the marker touching the coronary band and another edge touching the ventral aspect of the wall of the hoof.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nImages of the pig displaying (\nA\n) bipedal and (\nB\n) quadrupedal treadmill stepping during key stepping landmarks. Proximal and distal angles are labeled to show changes in the angles at these landmarks. Demonstrated by moving right to left: initial contact, yield, mid stance, lift off, and mid swing.\nPigs were filmed as they stepped on the treadmill for trials of up to 1\u2009min. Three GoPro Hero 3+ Silver cameras were used to film the animals, and they were triggered simultaneously with a GoPro remote (GoPro, San Mateo, CA;\nFig. 2\n). Two of the cameras were positioned 73\u2009cm perpendicularly from the lateral edges of the treadmill and focused on the walking area for the hindlimbs. The third camera was placed 89\u2009cm perpendicularly from the back edge of the treadmill centered with the middle of the belt. The video was recorded with a resolution of 720 p at 120 frames per second (120\u2009Hz). Animals were filmed at six speeds performing bipedal and quadrupedal stepping. The six speeds utilized were 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5\u2009km/h (0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 1.0\u2009m/s). Speeds were determined by the available settings on the treadmill and were the lowest six settings. The speeds utilized also encompass the normal walking velocity of a YMP.\n35\nDuring filming, the goal was \u226510 steps on each task at each speed while walking in a straight line with snout on the target. A minimum of three attempts at each speed for each task were captured.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nImage showing (\nA\n) the location of the cameras and lights in respect to the treadmill. (\nB\n) The target and food hole used for training.\nOnce the videos were collected, 10 contiguous step cycles that best represented the animal's typical stepping behavior were selected. Each step cycle (stride) started with the initial contact of the hoof with the treadmill, followed by the stance phase that ended at the hoof lifting from the treadmill, and a swing phase ending the frame before the next initiation of contact. The determined step cycles were then digitized using MaxTRAQ 2D software (Innovision Systems, Marietta, GA). The stance phase was determined by digitizing each hoof marker starting with initial contact on the treadmill through hoof lift off. The swing phase was the time that was not digitized until initiation of the next initial contact. Twelve parallel lines were marked on the treadmill belt (numbered 1\u201312 starting from the right;\nFig. 2\n). Each line was calibrated based upon its distance from the right lateral camera.\nVideo capture with a meter stick marked at 30\u2009cm on each line of the treadmill gave us a pixel per 30-cm conversion for each line. This improves the accuracy of spatial measurements, such as stride and stance distances, given that the step may not always be at a consistent (same) distance from the camera every time. Videos were digitized in MaxTRAQ, and a conversion ratio for pixels to centimeters was calculated for each line. Conversion ratios were checked for accuracy by two perpendicular lines on the treadmill belt that were 30\u2009cm apart. These lines also were digitized in MaxTRAQ and, using the conversion tool in the software, were compared with the predetermined conversion ratio. The 10 step cycles chosen for analyses were viewed using the caudal camera, and an average line of calibration was selected. If the hoof fell between two lines, the average of the selected lines was calculated and that value used for the calibration of that limb. For intralimb analysis, the four spherical markers were digitized using the same 10 step cycles that were digitized using the hoof markers.\n\nStatistical analysis\nEach file was saved as a MaxTRAQ ASCII file and then processed through a custom Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Excel add-in. The ASCII file contained the location in XY coordinates and the frame numbers of all markers through the trial. This add-in calculated multiple parameters (\nTable 2\n), as well as extracting the exact frames of initial contact and lift off. Kinematic outcome measures of quadrupedal forelimb stepping at multiple speeds were analyzed using repeated-measures (RM) analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significant differences among speeds were compared using Bonferroni's post-hoc\nt\n-tests for multiple comparisons. Analyses of bipedal and quadrupedal stepping at each speed were analyzed using RM ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc\nt\n-tests. Comparison of two- or four-limbs differences (2\u2009=\u2009hindlimbs only or 4\u2009=\u2009fore- and hindlimbs) and differences among speeds (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5\u2009km/h) were analyzed using RM ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc\nt\n-tests.

The lower portion shows hindlimb and forelimb coupling measures of coordination (e.g., FRRL [Front Right Rear Left]), homologous (e.g., FRFL [Front Right Front Left]), and homolateral (e.g., FRRR [Front Right Rear Right]) side measures at six speeds in km/h.\nPct, percent; SD, standard deviation.\nIn addition, interlimb coordination was assessed by utilizing gait diagrams of the left forelimb (LF), right forelimb (RF), left hindlimb (LH), and right hindlimb (RH) and determination of homologous (LF, RF, LH, and RH), homolateral (LF, LH, RF, and RH), and diagonal (LF, RH, RF, and LH) coupling patterns.\n87\n,\n88\nCoupling measures were calculated as a percentage of the step cycle using the methods previously described in LeBlond and colleagues and also depicted using polar plots to assess the distribution and variability at different speeds.\n28\n,\n39\n,\n62\nThe mean diagonal coupling interval, a measure of the coordination between the diagonal limbs, also was calculated using the list of the horizontal (x) coordinates of the markers on each hoof as follows: Mean diagonal coupling interval\u2009=\u2009Tn \u2013 T1/number of steps; Tn is the interval between the \u201cnth\u201d right hindlimb and \u201cnth\u201d left forelimb placement, T1 is the interval between the first right hindlimb and first left forelimb hoof placements\n40\nand was plotted as a function of step number (n;\nFig. 3\n). Mean diagonal coupling intervals remain virtually zero in normal animals, but once an animal experiences a disruption in their locomotor capabilities, the time interval grows with each step.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nMultiple stepping patterns over time can be illustrated using sine waves of alternating stance and swing cycles (top). Peaks of the waves represent the moment of maximum forward movement. Lines connecting the peaks of the forelimb with its diagonal hindlimb show the time lapses between the diagonal limbs. Mean lag time is calculated by taking the average of the sum of the subsequent lag times subtracted from the first lag time.\nTraditional intralimb kinematic assessments in other animal species include the knee.\n40\n,\n69\n,\n88\u201390\nHowever, because of the extensive movement of the knee under the skin in many species, including mini pigs, accurate identification of the knee relies on triangulation using the known positions of the hip and ankle, and the known lengths of the femur and tibia. This process can be labor intensive or require expensive software packages. We therefore used a two-dimensional (2D) approach previously used for rats to quantify changes in intralimb kinematics after SCI simply and effectively.\n89\n,\n91\nThis approach uses markers on the anterior rim of the pelvis (I), head of the greater trochanter (H), lateral malleolus of the ankle (A), and metatarsophalangeal joint of the toe (T) to create a three-segment (I-H, H-A, and A-T), two-angle (I-H-A and H-A-T) limb model that easily detects changes in limb movement.\n86\u201388\nThe markers located at C, G, T, and M define three segments (C-G, G-T, and T-M;\nFig. 1\n), a distal angle (G-T-M;\nFigs. 1\nand\n\u200b\nand4A),\n4A\n), and a proximal angle (C-G-T;\nFigs. 1\nand\n\u200b\nand4B\n4B\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nGraphs of (\nA\n) distal angle, (\nB\n) proximal angle, and (\nC\n) proximal-distal angles during treadmill stepping showing the changes in the angles during movement during a period of 10 step cycles. (A) In a graph of the distal angle over time, the stepping landmarks of initial contact, yield, and lift off can be identified. (B) Similar to the distal angle over time, the initial contact and lift off are identifiable in the proximal angle over time. (C) When the angles are plotted against one another, you can see a distinctive shape and change in angle relationship between stance and swing. The red lines are the plots of 10 consecutive step cycles, with the blue line showing a typical single step cycle.\nUsing initial hoof contacts, determined visually from the digital recordings, each trial was divided into individual step cycles. From these step cycles the maximum (peak\u2009=\u2009maximum extension) and minimum (trough\u2009=\u2009maximum flexion) for each of the two hindlimb angles was determined. Range of motion across each joint (angular excursion) was calculated by subtracting the trough values from the peak values. In addition, the phase relationship between the two angles was calculated by using the ratio of the peak to peak times relative to the step cycle duration. The proximal angle describes the range of motion across the hip and knee, whereas the distal angle reflects the motion of the knee and ankle. Using this approach, subtle differences can be detected in the proximal and/or distal angles (\nFig. 4A,B\n), changes in the maximal extension and flexion angles, and excursions of both proximal and distal limb angles, and changes in the shape and structure of the angle-angle plots (\nFig. 4C\n). These figures also give us the opportunity to observe the extension and flexion intervals and how they can change. This method allows us to use an inexpensive camera/software combination to capture the animal in 2D, digitize each video in \u223c10\u2009min, and (through a custom VBA Excel add-in) extract the data quickly, all resulting in a relatively high throughput."

    "Methods": "This prospective study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board and by the sponsor, the Department of Defense. This investigation was part of a larger study conducted in two Level 1 trauma centers and one Level 3 community hospital. All potential mTBI patients in the emergency department were screened, and patients were able to provide informed consent if their Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test was \u226575. All patient had scores \u226575 in this study. Patients with pre-existing substance abuse, alcohol dependence, and psychiatric disorders were excluded. Inclusion criteria were adult patients (age 18-50 years) with mTBI at admission to the emergency room, Glasgow Coma Scale score 13-15, presence of head injury, negative computed tomography imaging of the head, loss of consciousness less than 30\u2009min, and post-traumatic amnesia less than 24\u2009h. A comparison group of orthopedic injury (OI) patients without mTBI also were analyzed in this study. This control group of OI patients included adult patients (age 18-50 years) with extremity or pelvis injuries (Abbreviated Injury Scale <3) and without evidence of head injury. The OI group of patients reported no head trauma concomitant with their orthopedic trauma, did not have external signs of head trauma, and did not lose consciousness or memory after the injury. Demographic and clinical data related to the injury were collected at admission.\n\nInflammatory markers\nVenous whole\u2013blood samples were collected at enrollment (within 24\u2009h of injury) and again at 6 months after injury. Samples were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min at 1500\u2009\u00d7\u2009g, the supernatant was removed to clean tubes, and the samples were further clarified by centrifugation 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, 10,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g. The resulting platelet-depleted plasma fraction was divided into aliquots and stored at -80\u00b0C until assayed. A high-sensitivity multiplex panel (Thermofisher, cat# EPXS090-12199-901) was used to simultaneously assay IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL12p70, IL-17a, interferon (IFN)\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 using a Luminex Magpix. This cytokine panel was chosen based upon previously published data on the relationship of multiple cytokines with different outcome measures after TBI,\n22\u201327\nand our past experience with multiplex assay panels.\nReference standards provided in the kit were run in tandem with the experimental samples to generate standard curves for each target and used to quantify the amount of each target in the patient samples. A mixture of magnetic antibody beads was added to the reaction plate, followed by 25\u2009\u03bcL of plasma and 25\u2009\u03bcL of universal assay buffer. The plate was incubated with shaking for 30\u2009min at room temperature, then overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by an additional 30\u2009min at room temperature. The beads were washed two times with the buffer provided in the kit and a magnetic baseplate was used to retain the beads. The plates were then incubated for 30\u2009min at room temperature with 25\u2009\u03bcL of the biotinylated detection antibody mixture, washed twice, incubated with 50\u2009\u03bcL streptavidin-phycoerythrin, then washed twice. The samples were then incubated at room temperature for 30\u2009min with 25\u2009\u03bcL amplification reagent 1, washed twice, incubated with 25\u2009\u03bcL amplification reagent 2 for 30\u2009min at room temperature, followed by two washes. After the final wash, the samples were resuspended in 120\u2009\u03bcL reading buffer (provided with the kit) by 5\u2009min vigorous shaking at room temperature and analyzed using a Luminex Magpix plate reader.\n\nNeuropsychological outcomes\nNeuropsychological outcomes for mTBI patients were assessed as described previously at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after injury.\n28\n,\n29\nHealth-related quality of life was recorded using the 12 item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), which measures physical and mental health.\n30\nThe neuropsychological tests used for analysis in this study are described below.\nVerbal Selective Reminding Test (VSRT)\nThe VSRT measures verbal episodic memory using 12 unrelated words over six trials as described previously.\n29\nThe participant was asked to recall all 12 words on each trial; after the examiner orally presented the word list on trial 1, the examiner presented only those words that the participant failed to recall on the preceding trial. The variables analyzed in this study included the consistent long-term retrieval (total number of words recalled for each word from the first through sixth trial) and delayed recall (total number of words recalled at 30\u2009min after the sixth trial). We also recorded cued recall (CR) by providing the first two or three letters of each word on the list, as well as recognition memory recall (REC) after cueing, which measured if participants could identify the words on the list amongst four alternative words.\nSymbol-Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)\nThe SDMT\n31\ndetects reduced processing speed for timed substitution tasks when the participant pairs numbers with geometric figures in a fixed time limit. For this study, we analyzed the total number of correct responses for both the written and oral versions.\nRivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPCSQ)\nThe RPCSQ\n32-34\nis a self-reported scale of post-concussion symptoms, including cognitive, emotional and somatic symptoms after mTBI compared with pre-injury; each symptom is rated by the subject on a 5-point scale (0 to 4) wherein a score of 1 denotes a symptom that is unchanged from pre-injury. The total score (0-64) was used for analysis in this study. A higher score indicated greater severity.\nPost-traumatic Stress Checklist-Civilian Form (PCL-C)\nThe PCL-C is a self-reported measure of PTSD symptom severity for civilians.\n35\nParticipants rate the severity of their symptoms on a 5-point scale with higher scores indicating greater severity. The total score (17-85) was used for analysis in this study.\nCenter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)\nThe CES-D is a self-reported measure of depression related symptoms with higher scores associated with greater symptom severity.\n36\nThe total score (0-60) was used as the primary variable in this study, and the baseline score (recorded as symptoms for the week prior to injury) was used as a covariate in the analysis.\nBrief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R)\nThe BVMT-R\n37\nmeasures visuospatial learning and memory by asking participants to recall and draw figures in a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20093 array after a learning trial. The scores summed across three learning trials and delayed recall were used in this study.\nDelis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System Verbal Fluency Test (D-KEFS VFT)\nD-KEFS VFT measures verbal fluency by asking the participant to generate as many words as possible beginning with specific letters according to rules presented beforehand to the participant; the total number of correct words summed over three 1-min trials is the key variable (letter fluency).\n38\nFor category fluency, the participant generates as many words as possible in a particular category for two 1-min trials. For category-switching, the participant generates as many words as possible in two alternating categories. For this study, we analyzed total correct scores for letter fluency, category fluency, and category-switching. D-KEFS VFT measures executive function, switching strategies, initiation of response, and adherence to rules. Expressive language is also implicitly tested by this test.\nDelis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System Color-Word Interference Test (D-KEFS CWIT)\nThe D-KEFS CWIT\n39\nassesses response time for naming the color of font in color words when it is dissonant with the color word (e.g., naming \u201cred\u201d when the color word \u201cblue\u201d is printed in red font) compared with the time to read the words printed in non-dissonant font). By subtracting response times for the conditions with and without interference, this test measures the executive function of inhibition. The raw scores for the inhibition (interference) and inhibition-switching (alternating naming of font color and reading the color word) conditions were analyzed for this study.\n\nReturn to class/work\nAt each follow-up interval, participants were asked if they returned to school or work and this was analyzed as an additional outcome variable.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis, visualizations, and summary tables were implemented with R (3.6.1).\nExploratory analysis\nA total of 53 subjects were analyzed. Median and interquartile range were calculated for all numeric variables. Categorical variables were counted and calculated as a percent of total. Shapiro-Wilk tests and box plots with jittered points were used to assess the normality of each cytokine at the 24-h and 6-month collection points. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to assess significant differences between cytokine levels at 24\u2009h and 6 months. The results from neuropsychological outcomes were assessed for normality using Shapiro-Wilk tests at each time-point (1 week, and 6 months). Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess significant differences in outcome scores between 1 week and 6 months after injury. McNemar's test was used for the binary \u201creturn to class/work\u201d outcome. Univariate models for each potential outcome:predictor pair were generated to identify significant linear associations.\nRegression analysis\nLeast absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to identify potentially associated cytokines and confounders (age, sex, race, socioeconomic index, Glasgow Coma Scale verbal score, and injury severity score) for each outcome. All outcomes were analyzed for cytokines measured at 24\u2009h. Only 6-month outcomes were analyzed for cytokines measured at 6 months.\nFor each outcome with at least one cytokine predictor and one confounder, the relationship between the cytokine and confounder was assessed for interaction. If this interaction was significant, the interaction term was added to the model. Interaction was assessed by comparing predicted outcome values between the original study data and a modified data set that held the interaction term constant.\nMultiple regression models were constructed for each outcome that had at least one potential predictor identified by LASSO. Transformations (e.g., log, square root) of the outcome measure were conducted if they improved the diagnostic fit. If transformations did not improve diagnostic fit, the model was fitted using restricted cubic splines on nonlinear predictors. The restricted cubic spline (RCS) fitted model was then compared with the original model using an analysis of variance chi squared test. All spline fitted models had\np\nvalues >0.05 for the chi-squared test, and were not included in the final summary.\nSignificant associations between the outcome and cytokine predictors were adjusted using Bonferroni's correction, with the number of comparisons calculated by counting the number of models with at least one LASSO-selected cytokine (for tests administered at 24\u2009h,\nn\n=\u200916 and\np\n=\u20090.05/16\u2009=\u20090.003; at 6 months,\nn\n=\u20096 and\np\n=\u20090.05/6\u2009=\u20090.008). These adjusted models were compared with the univariate models that were generated regardless of LASSO selection. If an outcome:cytokine pair exhibited a\np\nvalue below the Bonferroni-adjusted alpha, the result was determined to be significant and reported in the list of significant models."

Specifically, the Einstein Heading Questionnaire queries: (A) How many months did you play soccer during the previous 12 months? (B) How many times per week do you practice? (C) How many times do you head the ball during a typical practice session? (D) How many times per week do you play a competitive game? (E) How many times do you head the ball during a typical competitive game?\nBased on the participants' responses to these questions, the previous 12 months of exposure was computed as follows: (A/12)*(B*C+D*E)*52. Participants were divided into \u201chigh exposure\u201d and \u201clow exposure\u201d groups based on their self-reported exposure over the previous 12 months (\nTable 1\n).\nThe Einstein Heading Questionnaire also queries demographic information, concussion history, and symptoms experienced after soccer heading.\n13\n,\n20\nSpecifically, the Einstein Heading Questionnaire queries, \u201cUsually heading is unremarkable. Sometimes, though, heading is not quite right and may cause dizziness, confusion, or other feelings. Please indicate how often you experience the following symptoms of heading.\u201d Participants rated symptoms on a Likert scale from 0 to 4 (i.e., 0\u2009=\u2009Never, 1\u2009=\u2009Rarely [1\u201325% of the time], 2\u2009=\u2009Sometimes [26\u201350% of the time], 3\u2009=\u2009Often [50\u201375% of the time], 4\u2009=\u2009Very Often [76\u2013100% of the time]).\nTable 1\npresents both the number of symptoms endorsed as well as the symptom frequency (herein defined as number of symptoms * Likert scale reporting of frequency).\n\nSensory reweighting paradigm\nThe sensory reweighting paradigm has been described previously, with the experimental apparatus shown in\nFigure 1\n.\n19\nBriefly, participants stood upright in the Immersive Labs (Bertec Corporation, Columbus, OH) while experiencing four experimental conditions: low amplitude visual scene movement + vibration + galvanicvestibular stimulation (GVS; LVG condition in figures); low amplitude visual scene movement + GVS plus; no vibration (LG condition in figures); high amplitude visual scene movement + vibration + GVS (HVG condition in figures); high amplitude visual scene movement + GVS + no vibration (HG condition in figures).\n19\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSensory reweighting experimental paradigm setup. GVS, galvanic vestibular stimulation.\nThere were five trials of each condition for a total of 20 trials; trial order was randomized for each participant. The length of each trial was 125\u2009sec with 5\u2009sec added at the beginning and end of each trial (total 135\u2009sec) to allow the sensory perturbations to ramp up and ramp down.\n19\nKinematics were recorded in QTM (Qualisys Inc., G\u00f6teborg, Sweden) at 100\u2009Hz. Twelve reflective markers were placed bilaterally on the temple, acromioclavicular joint, greater trochanter, lateral femoral condyle, lateral malleolus, and first metatarsal head.\n\nSensory stimuli\nThe visual stimulus consisted of 500 randomly distributed pyramids translated sinusoidally in the anterior-posterior direction at 0.2\u2009Hz. The visual stimulus was presented at different amplitudes (i.e., 0.2\u2009m and 0.8\u2009m in Unity [Unity Technologies, San Francisco, CA]) to measure the approximate center of mass (COM) anterior-posterior displacement change in gain to vision, an intramodal effect; and change in gain to GVS and vibration, both intermodal effects. The proprioceptive stimulus consisted of bilateral Achilles tendon vibration, which was applied as a square-wave periodic stimulus with equal on and off time durations at 0.28\u2009Hz. The vestibular stimulus consisted of \u00b11\u2009mA sinusoidal binaural-monopolar GVS (neuroConn DC-STIMULATOR PLUS, neuroCare Group, Munich, Germany) at 0.36\u2009Hz.\n\nSignal processing\nThe time series of greater trochanter markers were recorded. The approximate COM was determined by the midpoint of left and right greater trochanter markers. The mean of the COM displacement was subtracted, and the cross spectral density of the output (i.e., COM displacement) and the input (i.e., each sensory stimulus), and the power spectral density of the input were computed using the Welch method with a 50\u2009sec Hanning window and 50% overlap and then averaged across trials.\n19\nFor each sensory modality, the transfer function (frequency response function) at the stimulus frequency was calculated by dividing the cross spectral density of the two signals by the power spectral density of the input. The gain to each modality was computed by taking the absolute value of the frequency response function.\n19\nBecause each stimulus was presented at a different frequency, the gain to each modality corresponds to the separate contribution of each modality to a participant's postural response and reflects the coupling of postural sway to the stimulus motion.\nPhase was computed as the argument of the frequency response function and converted to degrees.\n19\nPhase is a measure of the temporal relationship between postural sway and stimulus motion; postural sway may lead the stimulus (positive values) or lag behind it (negative values). The total power was computed as the integrated area of the power spectrum of the COM displacement after the removal of the postural sway response at the sensory drive frequencies.\n22\n,\n23\nSpecifically, the residual COM displacement was computed by subtracting sinusoids corresponding to the COM Fourier transform at each stimulus frequency.\n22\nFinally, the COM 95% area and velocity were computed as described by Prieto and associates.\n24\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe compared demographic information, concussion history, soccer participation history, and SCAT5 data between groups using independent samples\nt\ntests for continuous variables and chi-square for count variables. To compare sensory reweighting between groups, we used a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The within-group effects included change in visual amplitude (labeled vision in results) and effect from vibration on/off (labeled vibration in results). The between-group effect included group (i.e., high exposure and low exposure, labeled exposure in results).\nThere were nine outcomes analyzed independently, including gain and phase of COM displacement relative to the visual stimulus, to the GVS stimulus, and to the vibration stimulus, COM total power, COM 95% area, and COM velocity. The gain of COM displacement relative to each sensory stimulus, COM total power, COM 95% area, and COM velocity were not distributed normally, so these data were log-transformed before they were compared. For each variable, according to our\na priori\npower analysis, we needed 24 participants to examine two groups across four conditions. Significance was defined\na priori\nat\np\n<\u20090.05. For all comparisons, we report partial \u03b7\n2\nas a measure of effect size, whereby 0.01 is small, 0.09 is medium, and 0.25 is large."

    "Methods": "Animals\nTwenty-four female and 24 male, four-month old C57BL/6 mice were used to generate the data for this study (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Animals were housed in individually ventilated cages with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. Housing is set to maintain a 14\u2009h light/10\u2009hr night cycle at 70\u00b0F and 50% humidity. All experimental procedures were conducted during the light cycle and with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Kentucky.\n\nSurgery\nAnimals were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (100\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg). There were six experimental groups: (1) male with 75 kdyne SCI,\nn\n=\u200910; (2) female with 75 kdyne SCI,\nn\n=\u200910; (3) male sham (laminectomy only),\nn\n=\u20098; (4) female sham, n\u2009=\u20098; (5) male no injury (anesthetic only),\nn\n=\u20096; and (6) female no injury\nn\n=\u20096. The hair overlying the thoracic region of the spinal cord was shaved for all animals.\nFor Groups 1\u20134 (SCI and sham), the skin was incised, and the connective and muscle tissue was dissected to expose the vertebral column from T8\u2013T10. A dorsal laminectomy was performed at T9. Animals were then placed under the Infinite Horizons (IH) injury device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation).\n10\nGroups 1\u20132 received a moderate-severe contusion SCI (75 kdyn displacement). Spinal cord displacement at the time of SCI was the same for both sexes (female 594\u2009\u00b1\u200920\u2009mm; male 580\u2009\u00b1\u200924\u2009mm;\np\n=\u20090.65) ensuring that similar injury severities were achieved in males and females. Groups 3-4 were removed from the injury device without receiving SCI.\nMuscle and skin incisions were then closed using monofilament sutures. Immediately after surgery, all mice were given one subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine-SR (1\u2009mg/kg) and one subcutaneous injection of an antibiotic agent (5\u2009mg/kg, enrofloxacin 2.27%: Norbook Inc, Lenexa, KS, dissolved in 2\u2009mL saline). Animals recovered on paper towels in cages on \u223c37\n0\nC heating pad overnight before returning to home cages. Subcutaneous antibiotic injections (5\u2009mg/kg, enrofloxacin) were given in 1\u2009mL saline for five days. Manual bladder expression was performed on injured mice twice daily until sacrificed. Four SCI animals died because of post-surgical complications: three in Group 1 (male-SCI) and one in Group 2 (female-SCI).\n\nTissue processing\nMice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (0.1\u2009M, pH 7.4: Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n(Fisher, Cat#7558-79-4), NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n(Fisher, 10049-21-5), NaCl (Fisher, 7210-16)), followed by perfusion with cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Alfa Aesar, 30525-89-4) at 42 days post-injury (dpi). One cm of the spinal cord centered on the laminectomy site (groups 1\u20134) or on T9 was dissected from each animal and then post-fixed in 4% PFA for 2\u2009h and subsequently rinsed and stored overnight in phosphate buffer (PB, 0.2\u2009M, pH 7.4) at 4\u00b0C.\nThe following day, tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 3\u20135 days at 4\u00b0C, followed by rapid freezing and blocking in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Sakura Finetek USA, Inc.) on dry ice. Spinal cords from Groups 1\u20134 were distributed randomly (by an experimenter blinded to group assignment) to tissue blocks to ensure every group was represented on each slide. The blocked tissue was stored at \u221280\u00b0C before sectioning. Transverse serial sections (10\u2009\u03bcm) were cut through each block and mounted on Colorfrost Plus Slides (Fisher, 12-550-17), and then stored at \u221280\u00b0C before staining.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and quantification\nSlides were placed on a slide warmer set to 37\u00b0C to facilitate adherence of spinal cord sections. Slides were then rinsed with 0.1-M PBS and incubated in blocking buffer (0.1-M PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (Fisher, BP1605), 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma, X-100), and 5% normal goat serum (Sigma, G9203)) at room temperature for 1\u2009h, followed by incubation in blocking buffer containing primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. Primary antibodies were chicken anti-Neurofilament (NF)(1:1000, Aves, Cat #NFH) and chicken anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:500, Aves, Cat # B00094).\nOn the second day, slides were rinsed in 0.1-M PBS and then incubated with the secondary antibody, biotinylated goat anti-chicken (1:500, Aves, Cat#B1005) at room temperature for 1\u2009h. Slides were rinsed with 0.1-M PBS, then incubated with Elite-ABC (Vector PK-6100) for 1\u2009h at room temperature and then incubated with 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine or SG (Vector SK-4100; SK-4700). Slides were rinsed and then stained with either fast-red (FR) counterstain (Vector Labs, H-3403) or eriochrome (solochrome) cyanine (EC)(Sigma, E2502) for myelin.\nSlides were dehydrated in a series of ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%, VWR, 71002-508, 86125-164, EM-EX0276-4S) and histoclear (VWR, 101412-878), then mounted with coverslips in Permount (Fisher, SP15-500). All antibodies were previously tested with a dilution curve (ranging from 1:100-1:5000), including a nonprimary control, to confirm optimal staining concentrations.\nWe selected tissue sections with lesions (containing 5% or more of unmyelinated/demyelinated areas) for quantification of spared and total spinal cord cross-sectional tissue areas using GFAP/FR staining. All images were captured with a ZEISS Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanner with a 20x objective. Previously, we established that GFAP expression coincides with areas of spared axons at chronic time points after mouse SCI.\n11\nTo quantify spared tissue area, the regions of dense GFAP-positive staining were outlined and measured using the Halo Image Analysis software (Inca Labs, New Mexico). The percentage of spared tissue at the lesion epicenter (i.e., section with least amount of spared tissue) was calculated by dividing the spared tissue area by the total cross-sectional area of the spinal cord.\nThe EC/NF stains were used to estimate the rostral-caudal extent of the lesion\u2014i.e., the lesion length. We estimated the lesion length as the distance between the most rostral and the most caudal tissue sections containing lesion. Two animals, one male SCI (Group 1) and one female SCI (Group 2) were excluded from anatomical analyses because of extensive tissue loss during processing.\n\nBehavioral analyses of locomotor function\nLocomotor recovery was assessed using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42\u2009dpi as reported previously.\n12\n,\n13\nEach hindlimb was scored separately based on hindlimb movement (e.g., ankle placement and stepping), coordination, and trunk stability. For statistical analysis, both limbs were averaged to generate a single score for each animal. A score of zero indicates complete paralysis while a score of nine indicates normal locomotion.\nPlantar stepping ability was derived from the BMS.\n12\nAs described previously,\n12\neach hindlimb was scored as having none, occasional, frequent, or consistent plantar stepping. This depended on whether weight support and plantar placement (along with swing and stance) were maintained while the animal was moving for less the 50% of the time (occasional), greater than 50% of the time but not all the time (frequent), or all of the time (consistent). Each hindlimb was then scored as either none, occasional, frequent, or consistently plantar stepping.\n\nBehavioral analyses of sensory function\nBehavioral indices of neuropathic pain were measured before surgery and repeated at two, four, and six weeks after surgery. Mechanical sensitivity was assessed with the up-down method using von Frey (Vf) monofilaments.\n14\nAnimals were first acclimated to the testing apparatus consisting of a wire mesh floor within an acrylic enclosure. A monofilament was pressed perpendicularly against the plantar surface of the hindlimb until bent, beginning with the 1.4 gf monofilaments and ranging from the 0.4 gf to 6.0g f monofilaments. A 50% withdrawal threshold was calculated for each animal and reported as the average of both hindpaws at each time point.\n15\nHeat sensitivity, also known as the Hargreaves test,\n16\nwas assessed as previously described.\n17\nAnimals were first acclimated to the testing apparatus (Ugo Basile, Germany), consisting of a glass floor within an acrylic enclosure, for 1\u2009h. An infrared laser beam located under the floor and set to an infrared intensity of 25 units was aimed at the plantar skin surface of the hindlimb and activated. The latency to a unilateral hindpaw withdrawal response (e.g., jumping, licking, and flicking) was automatically recorded. A cutoff time of 25\u2009sec was used to avoid tissue injury. A total of five trials per limb were taken for each animal at each time point. Testing was alternated between limbs with an intertest duration of at least 5\u2009min. An average across the five recorded trials and across hindlimbs was computed for each animal at each time point.\n\nStatistical analyses\nAll data acquisition and analyses were performed by investigators blinded to experimental conditions. Statistical analyses were completed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software). Planned comparisons utilizing two-way repeated measures analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni\npost hoc\ntests were used to evaluate locomotor and pain outcomes. Specifically, the effects of Sex\u2009\u00d7\u2009Time (repeated) on BMS scores were analyzed for SCI animals. Individual, planned comparisons between male and female SCI groups, male and female sham groups, and within sex sham versus SCI groups were used to evaluate the effect of Sex and Injury on pain outcome measures; Time was treated as a repeated measure for all comparisons.\nFor sex comparisons of SCI-specific outcomes (SCI displacement, lesion length, and tissue sparing measures) unpaired\nt\ntests were used to compare the male and female groups. To analyze stepping frequency, a chi-square test was performed. The sham (laminectomy alone) and no injury (anesthetic alone) groups were not different in behavior (BMS score 9) or on any pain outcomes (\np\n>\u20090.05, main effect of surgery) and therefore only sham (laminectomy alone) groups were used for statistical analyses. Simple linear regression was used to correlate injury and anatomical outcomes with functional results. Results were considered statistically significant at\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Animals and spinal cord injury\nSibling male Wistar rats, 52\u2009\u00b1\u20094 days old, were used for this study with ethics approvals from the Australian National University Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee. Animals were held in individually ventilated cages with environmental enrichment, standard food, and water\nad libitum.\nThe housing facility was maintained at 20\u00b0C with a 12-h dark/light cycle. Animals were housed for 2 weeks prior to experimentation, and all experiments were carried out during the light cycle. Animals were anesthetized using isoflurane (1.7\u20132.3 v/v %) while being maintained at 37\u00b0C by a heat mat during all surgical procedures. Laminectomy was performed at the T10 vertebra, where the dura mater and arachnoid were removed. A 10-g weight drop from 25\u2009mm above the spinal cord was used to induce a hemi-contusion on the right side of the spinal cord.\n21\n,\n24\nSham-injured animals underwent the same surgical procedures without the impaction. All animals received subcutaneous injections of antibiotics (cephalothin sodium; DBL) after surgery and once every 24\u2009h throughout the recovery period at a dosage of 15\u2009mg/kg/12\u2009h. Animals were returned to their home cage after the effects of anesthesia had subsided.\n\nTreatment\nSCI animals were divided into untreated (SCI;\nn\n=\u200940) and 670\u2009nm treated (SCI+670;\nn\n=\u200933) groups. Sham-injured animals were divided into untreated (sSCI;\nn\n=\u200912) and 670\u2009nm treated sSCI+670;\nn\n=\u200911 groups. Treatments commenced 2\u2009h after the surgery and were repeated every 24\u2009h after behavioral sensitivity testing. For the duration of the treatment, animals were contained in a transparent Perspex box in their own cages. A commercially available LED array (75\u2009mm\n2\n) that provided light at 670\u2009\u00b115\u2009nm with a measured irradiance of 35.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05\u2009mW/cm\n2\n(WARP 75A; Quantum Devices, Inc.) was placed directly above a Perspex box for light-treated animals (SCI+670 and sSCI+670 groups). With this light source, we have previously measured the irradiance at the ventral surface of the spinal cord to be 3.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u2009mW/cm\n2\nin a similar cohort of animals, as well as have described details of the spectral features and irradiance measurements of this light source.\n21\nThe treatments were delivered for 30\u2009min per day (63.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\u2009J/cm\n2\nper session) to the dorsal surface of the animal. Untreated animals (SCI and sSCI groups) were handled in the same way without the LED being turned on (sham treatment).\n\nSensitivity testing\nAll animals were subjected to sensitivity testing on every odd day from 1\u2009dpi as we have previously described.\n21\nAll sessions were carried out by the same assessor, who was blinded to experimental groups. Briefly, a nylon filament (OD: 1.22\u2009mm; mass delivered: 2.86\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\u2009g) was used to deliver non-noxious tactile stimuli to six defined regions: dermatomes innervated by nerves above the level of the injury (dermatomes C6\u2013T3), at the level of the injury (dermatomes T9\u201312), and below the level of the injury (dermatomes L2\u20135) on both ipsilateral and contralateral sides. At each region, 10 consecutive stimuli were applied, and responses were categorized into four different categories: 1) no response; 2) acknowledgement of the stimulus; 3) sign of pain avoidance behavior including moving away from the stimulus; 4) severe pain avoidance behavior including jumping, running, and vocalization. The categories were then assigned a weight individually (0, 1, \u221a2, and 2) and the summation of the 10 responses gave the regional sensitivity score (RSS). The summation of the six RSSs gave the cumulative sensitivity score (CSS). A group of age-matched male Wistar rats were also included in the sensitivity testing as non-injured control animals (CON;\nn\n=\u20097). A hypersensitivity threshold was defined as 2 standard deviations (SDs) above the mean of CON animals. Hypersensitivity incidence was thus calculated as the percentage of animals whose CSS exceeded the hypersensitivity threshold. See the article by Hu and colleagues for more details on sensitivity testing.\n21\n\nTissue collection and processing\nAt the end of designated recovery periods (1, 3, 5, and 7\u2009dpi), animals were euthanized and perfused transcardially with 0.9% (w/v) saline followed by 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. The spinal cord was dissected, and then it was cryoprotected in 30% (w/v) sucrose solution for at least 24\u2009h before cryosectioning. Spinal cord sections 1.5\u2009mm rostral and 1.5\u2009mm caudal to the injury epicenter were placed in Tissue-Tek optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (IA018; Proscitech) and then sectioned horizontally at 20\u2009\u03bcm thickness on a cryostat (CM1850; Leica Microsystems) at \u221220\u00b0C.\n\nTerminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling\nThe same protocol was used as published previously.\n21\nSlides were incubated with 1:10 terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) buffer for 10\u2009min and subsequently in reaction mixture (0.12% v/v TdT [3333574001, Roche Applied Science]; 0.25% v/v 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate [dUTP; 11093070910, Roche Applied Science]; 10.51% v/v TdT buffer) for 1\u2009h at 37\u00b0C. This was followed by 15\u2009min incubation with 1:10 saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer and blocking with 10% v/v normal goat serum in 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10\u2009min. Slides were then incubated with 0.1% v/v streptavidin 488 (S-11223, Invitrogen) at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. This was followed by immunohistochemistry where appropriate.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nStandard immunohistochemistry procedures were followed. Slices around the injury epicenter were dehydrated in 70% ethanol and then rehydrated in distilled water and subsequently in 0.1\u2009M PBS. The antigen retrieval step involved incubation in Reveal-it Solution (AR2002, ImmunoSolution) for 6\u201312\u2009h at 37\u00b0C followed by 0.1\u2009M PBS washes. Slides were blocked in 20% (v/v) normal donkey serum in 0.1\u2009M PBS with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1\u2009h at room temperature before the addition of primary antibodies. Primary antibodies (myelin basic protein [1:1000, Abcam ab40390], NeuN [1:200, Abcam ab104224], NF200 [1:1000, Invitrogen 131200], glial fibrillary acidic proteim [GFAP; 1:1000, Dako Z0334], IL-1\u03b2 [1:200, R&D systems AF501-NA], IBA1 [1:200, Wako 019-19741 and Abcam ab5076], and uNOS [1:150, Invitrogen PA1-039]) were diluted in 0.1M PBS containing 2% (v/v) normal donkey serum and 0.1% (w/v) BSA and then were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Negative controls were also included where the primary antibodies were excluded.\nSlides were washed with 0.1M PBS followed by secondary antibody incubations at room temperature for 1\u20132\u2009h. Secondary antibodies (goat anti mouse Alexa Fluor 488 [1:1000, Invitrogen A-11001], goat anti rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 [1:1000, Invitrogen A-31631], donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 594 [1:500, Abcam ab150132], and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 [1:1000, Invitrogen A-21206]) were diluted in the same way as primary antibodies and followed by 0.1\u2009M PBS washes. Slides were then incubated in 1:1000 (v/v) diluted Hoechst solution (94403; Sigma-Aldrich) and then washed off using 0.1\u2009M PBS.\n\nImage acquisition and quantification\nSlides were scanned and imaged using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope fitted with a camera (DS-Qi1; Nikon). In MBP/NF200/Hoechst staining, the entire cross section of the spinal cord at the injury epicenter was scanned using three lasers (405\u2009nm, 488\u2009nm, and 561\u2009nm) under 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification with a z-plane of at least 10\u2009\u03bcm in depth. In NeuN/TUNEL/Hoechst staining, six representative images were imaged in the dorsal, intermediate, and ventral regions of the spinal cord on both ipsilateral and contralateral sides under 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification using the same lasers and the same z-plane configurations as above. All imaging and laser settings were kept constant for all animals for each staining. Images were then transferred offline for analysis using ImageJ version 1.46r.\n25\nNeuN/Hoechst and NeuN/TUNEL/Hoechst stainings were analyzed using the Cell Counter plugin as described earlier.\n21\nNF200 was expressed as particles (density/mm\n2\n). The regions of interest were defined and quantified prior to cell counting covering a minimum area of 0.1\u2009mm\n2\n. Myelin basic protein (MBP) was analyzed as % area of fluorescence.\nIn GFAP/Hoechst staining, the entire cross section of the spinal cord at the injury level was scanned using two lasers (405\u2009nm and 488\u2009nm) under 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification with a z-plane of at least 10\u2009\u03bcm in depth. In GFAP/IL1\u03b2/Hoechst, IBA1/IL-1\u03b2/Hoechst, and IBA1/uNOS/Hoechst staining, six representative images were taken in the dorsal, lateral, and ventral spinal cord funiculi at the injury level on both ipsilateral and contralateral sides under 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification using three lasers (405\u2009nm, 488\u2009nm, and 561\u2009nm) and the same z-plane configuration as above. All imaging and laser settings were kept constant for all animals for each staining. Images were then analyzed offline using ImageJ version 1.46r.\n25\nGFAP was analyzed as fluorescence per % area, whereas GFAP/IL-1\u03b2/Hoechst, IBA1/IL-1\u03b2/Hoechst, and IBA1/uNOS/Hoechst stainings were analyzed using the Cell Counter plugin as described earlier.\n21\nThe areas of interest were defined and quantified prior to cell counting covering a minimum area of 0.1mm\n2\n. Cell quantification is expressed as the number of cells per unit area (mm\n2\n).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM) unless otherwise stated. Statistical analysis was carried out using R.\n26\nGeneral linear mixed-effects models (GLMER;\nglmer\nfunction in R for binomially distributed data) or linear mixed-effects models implementing Satterthwaite's approximation (LMER;\nlmer\nfunction in R) were used for multiple factor analysis accounting for random effects.\n27\nLMER was followed by Tukey or false discover rate post hoc adjustments for pairwise comparisons implemented by estimated marginal means (\nemmeans\nfuction in R) where appropriate. Log transformations (log[x\u2009+\u20091]) were performed when the data were heteroscedastic and improved model fitting. Model fitting was assessed by inspection of residual plots and calculating Akaike information criterion (\nAIC\nfunction in R).\n28\nFor data that failed to fit LMER models, a cumulative link mixed model was fitted, accommodating one random factor, with the Laplace approximation (CLMM;\nclmm2\nfunction in R).\n29\nThe CLMM required categorizing scores into bins that best represented the data. Histograms of complete data sets (blind to groups) were inspected to determine natural breaks in the data to define each category. CLMM models were assessed with Akaike information criterion as well as inspection by plotting the observed data against the model predicated values, and comparing a linear model made with these data to a line with an intercept of zero and a slope of 1. Post hoc pairwise comparisons were performed using a Wilcoxon rank sum test on raw scores where applicable, with Bonferroni\np\n-value correction.\nBoth models accommodated up to four fixed factors (treatment, side, regions, and time) and one (CLMM: animal identification) or two (LMER: animal identification nested within their respective families) random factors. Models of CSSs were confirmed against models of RSSs, which enables more factors and thereby improved model fitting and statistical power.\nP\n-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Study population\nAll procedures performed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Institutional Research Committee as well as with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The Institutional Review Board approved this study (Medical Faculty, University of Duisburg-Essen, Registration number: 15-6632-BO).\nIn the present single-center prospective study, we screened 220 patients (\u2265 18 years) with symptomatic cSDH, who underwent surgical removal of the hematoma in our neurosurgical department between November 2016 and October 2019. We defined the term\nsymptomatic\nas progressive headache, neurological impairments, seizures, and changes in behavior.\nWe excluded patients with a history of CHF (\nn\n=\u200920), history of myocardial infarction (\nn\n=\u20099) renal insufficiency (\nn\n=\u200926), endocrine disease (\nn\n=\u200911) at admission, presence of an atrial tumor (\nn\n=\u20091), history of brain operation (\nn\n=\u20096), presence of a concomitant acute SDH (\nn\n=\u20093), epidural hematoma (\nn\n=\u20094), ICH (\nn\n=\u20094), acute/subacute stroke (\nn\n=\u20097), presence of an intracranial tumor or cyst (\nn\n=\u20095), and presence of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt system (\nn\n=\u20097). A further 17 patients were excluded from analysis because of missing consent (\nn\n=\u20096) and incomplete pre-operative blood samples (\nn\n=\u200911). In total, 100 patients met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in the current study. A flow diagram is presented in\nFigure 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFlow diagram of study inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\ncSDH treatment protocol\nThe diagnosis of cSDH was made by cranial computed tomography (CCT, Somatom Definition AS, Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) before surgery in all cases. Hematoma evacuation was performed according to local policy with a single or widened burr-hole trepanation and insertion of a subdural drain for 48\u2009h (\nn\n=\u200991). Some patients, however, did not require any drainage (\nn\n=\u20093) or underwent operation through a craniotomy (\nn\n=\u20094) or a decompressive craniectomy (\nn\n=\u20092) without insertion of subdural drainage.\nPeri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis was ensured by a single injection administrated before surgery (usually with cefazolin). Post-operatively, patients remained in the intermediate care unit for 48\u2009h. A control CCT was performed on the second post-operative day, and the subdural drain was removed. Patients were discharged usually on day 6 or day 7 after surgery. Routine blood samples were collected three times per week to control the salt-water balance. Patients with hyponatremia were treated initially intravenously, followed by oral intake.\n\nSerum BNP sample collection and management\nIn total, three BNP values were determined in each patient. The BNP-1 was measured before surgery, BNP-2 was measured in the early post-operative phase (day 1\u20133), and BNP-3 was measured on the day of discharge (day 6\u20137). The BNP serum level was assessed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Siemens, ADVIA Centauer\n\u00ae\n, USA). The measuring range provided by the manufacturer was 2\u2009\u2212\u20095000\u2009pg/mL. Tsubokawa and colleagues\n16\nconsidered a BNP concentration of less than 20\u2009pg/mL as normal. Sviri and associates\n11\ncollected blood samples of 10 healthy volunteers to determine a normal BNP concentration.\n11\nAccording to the 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure, the normal reference value of human BNP for adults is <35\u2009pg/mL.\n7\n\nCollection of patient data\nMedical records were analyzed regarding age, sex, and comorbidities such as cardiac history, antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy (AAT), and dementia. The time of obvious head trauma was not always possible to be determined. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores at admission, respectively, classified the functional and neurological condition of patients. Information on additional neurological impairments such as aphasia, seizure, and unconsciousness with the need for intubation before admission were collected separately.\nParameters related to post-operative complications such as rebleeding (within the first 48\u2009h after surgery), myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, transient ischemic attack, cardiac arrest, recurrence necessitating reoperation (RrR), postoperative ischemic stroke, ICH and death were also documented. RrR were defined as symptomatic subdural hematoma accumulation necessitating reoperation within 60 days after the first surgery.\n\nFollow-up\nPatients were followed up for three to six months after discharge in our outpatient department. The CCT scans were performed individually, dependent on the condition of the patient.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics\n\u00ae\nversion 25 for Windows. In the descriptive analysis, continuous data are expressed with the mean and standard deviation in the case of normal distribution and with the median and the interquartile range (IQR) in the case of non-normal distribution. Categorical data are presented as frequencies and percentages.\nThe Wilcoxon sign-rank test was performed to assess the difference between BNP serum levels at the different stages: pre-operatively, post-operatively, and at discharge. Differences between BNP-1 and categorical variables were assessed using the Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest. In the case of a continuous variable, the Spearman rank correlation was used. Associations between categorical variables were determined using the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. The\np\nvalues <0.05 in two-sided testing were considered significant."

    "Methods": "Participants\nAll procedures were reviewed and approved by the Loma Linda University Health System (LLUHS) Institutional Review Board. Informed written consent was obtained from all subjects' parents or legal guardians if below the age of 11 and from the subject if over 11 years of age. An assent form was signed by subjects between the ages of 7\u201311 years.\nMale and female TBI participants between the ages of 5 and 18 years were enrolled consecutively following hospital admission from 2009\u20132013 if they met the following criteria: 1) absence of previous brain injury, neurologic disorders, drug or alcohol abuse or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contraindications including dental braces and 2) moderate to severe TBI with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores between 3\u201312 or cMild (GCS 13\u201315) if hemorrhage was detected on an initial brain imaging (computed tomography [CT]) examination. Based on the GCS score, TBI patients were dichotomized into severe (GCS <8) or cMild/mod (GCS 9\u201315) TBI groups. Participants with cMild TBI were included in the modTBI group as the presence of cerebral lesions on CT has been shown to be predictive of poor outcome at 12-months.\n28\nControl participants between the ages of 5 and 18 years who met criteria 1 were recruited from LLUHS pediatric clinics.\n\nImage acquisition and processing\nTBI subjects were scanned acutely (range: 6\u201317 days) and at 12 months after injury. Controls were scanned initially and 1 year later using the same protocol. Conventional whole\u2013brain three-dimensional (3D) T1 weighted (T1WI, MPRAGE, repetition time [TR] and echo time [TE]\u2009=\u20091950\u2009msec and 2.26\u2009msec, 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0 pixel size) and 30 direction DTI (TR/TE\u2009=\u20095700/1022\u2009msec, 1.2\u2009\u00d7\u20091.22 resolution, 3\u2009mm slice thickness, 0.9\u2009mm gap, b\u2009=\u20090 and 1000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n) were acquired using a 3T Siemens Tim Trio MR scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 12 channel receive-only head coil.\nDTI data were processed using our previously published battery of computational tools (pre-processing, tract based spatial statistics (TBSS), image co-registration, and brain anatomy parsing) created using an in house pipeline developed in MATLAB (version R2014a, Mathworks, Natick MA) and incorporating image segmentation, registration and brain parsing routines from SPM5 (The Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, England), FSL (FLIRT image registration routine;\nhttps://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FLIRT\n), and the Laboratory of Neuroimaging (LONI) Brain Parser software catalog (University of Southern California, CA;\nwww.pipeline.loni.usc.edu;\nFig. 1\n).\n29\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nOverall scheme of image processing used in this study. The subject's high resolution T1 data were input into an atlas-based brain parcellation algorithm and segmented into tissue classes (white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid) as well as 17 brain anatomic regions in T1/T2 space. The subject's diffusion data was co-aligned with its own T1/T2 data to transfer tissue and anatomy information to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) spaces. Finally, tract-based statistics from DTI were fused for individual brain anatomy and tissue regions to estimate normative developmental trends in a pediatric dataset. Color image is available online.\nBriefly, the proprietary Siemens MRI scanner generated tensor file, which contains b0 and directional tensor matrices (Dxx, Dxy, Dxz, Dyy, Dyz, Dzz) were used to compute DTI tensor images, which were then interpolated to generate continuous 3D volumes matching the resolution of the T1WI (1.2\u2009\u00d7\u20091.2\u2009\u00d7\u20093.0\u2009mm) volume using a 3D cubic interpolation routine. Binary brain masks of the b0 images were used to remove the background noise and remove the skull in the DTI tensor images. Skull stripped tensor images were then used to compute the FA, ADC, AD and RD maps based on standard formulas.\n30\n,\n31\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) masking was performed using ADC images to produce a final binary brain mask, which was applied to the other DTI maps to improve the TBSS analysis. ADC values of >500\u2009\u00d7\u200910-5\u2009mm\n2\n/sec were used to detect CSF and voxels containing CSF outside the brain were eliminated from the binary mask while voxels within the ventricles were allowed to remain. If needed, additional skull stripping was performed during this step using an ADC threshold of <5\u2009\u00d7\u200910-5\u2009mm\n2\n/sec. All reconstructed b0, FA, and diffusivity data sets were reviewed for motion artifacts and no studies were removed from further analysis.\nIn our TBSS method, the physical locations of the skeleton are the central voxels within a white matter tract. However, we replaced the values in the skeleton voxels with several specific statistical measures (mean, median, maximum, and mode) of the voxel values on the line perpendicular to the skeleton for each DTI index. Therefore, all voxel values up to and including the gray matter-white matter junction that are found within the white matter mask are considered statistically as part of the mean, medium, maximum, and mode calculation in the value of the skeleton voxel.\n29\nWhite matter brain tracts were extracted and a FA skeleton was computed using a FA threshold >0.2 based on our previous work, which showed that smaller FA thresholds overestimated while larger FA thresholds underestimated white matter regions.\n29\nRegion-based connected component analysis was used to detect small nonconnected outlier regions <20 voxels in size and removed using area-based iterative filtering to produce a single connected skeleton for each white matter region. A MATLAB routine for medial axis computation (\u201cbwmorph [BinaryMask, \u2018skel\u2019, inf]\u201d) was used to create a skeleton of the white matter mask for each FA map by iteratively removing boundary pixels of the white matter binary mask to produce a single connected skeleton for each white matter region. The white matter binary mask and skeleton derived from the FA maps were superimposed onto the RD, AD, and ADC maps. Skeletons underwent non-linear transformation to MNI152 space using FSL's FLIRT image registration routine (\nhttps://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FLIRT\n). The resultant images were visually inspected for misalignment as result of distortion from the transformation of severely damaged brain tissue. Data from 12 subjects were discarded and removed from further analysis.\nAnatomic regions were delineated from the co-registered T1WI and DTI skeleton data using a pediatric brain parsing pipeline from the LONI Brain Parser software catalog (University of Southern California, CA;\nwww.pipeline.loni.usc.edu;\nFig. 1\n) Following TBSS analysis and brain parsing, the mean values for FA, RD, and AD were extracted for the: frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal white matter. Other regions included the corpus callosum, thalamus (which included the posterior limb of the internal capsule; PLIC/thalamus), basal ganglia (which included the anterior limb of the internal capsule; ALIC/basal ganglia), brainstem, and cerebellum.\n\nNeurological and neurocognitive testing\nNeurologic outcome was assessed by a pediatric neurologist using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale (PCPCS). Serial neurological examinations were performed on all TBI patients at study entry, initial MRI, hospital discharge, 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury, and initially and at 1 year for controls. Clinical information and surrogates of acute neurological injury (duration of loss of consciousness, days in coma, presence of seizures, days on a ventilator, days in hospital) were recorded for each TBI subject during their hospitalization.\nNeurocognitive testing was performed in an outpatient setting and conducted at 12 months post-injury for TBI subjects and at 1 year for controls. The neurocognitive test battery included measures of general intelligence (Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence), attention (Sky Search subtest from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children [Tea-CH; 5\u201315 years]), and memory (General Memory composite from the Children's Memory Scale [5\u201317 years] or Wechsler Memory Scale [17\u201318 years]). All neurocognitive scores are standardized by age based on published norms, with higher scores indicative of better performance. After standardization, memory scores were converted to Z-scores for ease of statistical comparison across differing measures.\n32\n,\n33\nThe Tea-Ch Sky Search is a brief measure of focused attention, wherein the average time to identify targets is obtained (Tea-Ch C), and then calculated when controlling for the influence of motor speed (Tea-Ch G). Lower standardized scores indicate increased time to identify targets with (Tea-Ch G) and without (Tea-Ch C) controlling for motor speed. The intelligence measure yields three indices: Verbal IQ (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ), and a Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ). The VIQ measures verbal abstract reasoning and the PIQ is a measures fluid reasoning and visual-spatial processing while the FSIQ is an overall composite of general intellectual ability based on both VIQ and PIQ.\n\nStatistical analysis\nGroup differences in regional DTI metrics at each imaging time-point were determined with linear (mixed effects) regression using age as a covariate and reported as the t statistic. Longitudinal differences in regional DTI metrics were measured within each group using paired\nt\n-tests at an alpha level of 0.001 to adjust for multiple comparisons.\nGiven the large number of measures resulting from regional DTI analysis, we applied a factor analysis to reduce the DTI metrics into a smaller number of underlying factors that could be used in a linear regression model to predict 12-month neurocognitive scores. Factor analysis was performed using principal component analysis of the 36 regional DTI measures to create eigenvectors.\n34\n,\n35\nOnly eigenvalues greater than 1 were used in subsequent analyses and Varimax rotation with Kaiser normalization was applied to produce several factors that explained the variance. Factor loadings explain the association of each variable with each factor and a factor loading >0.6 indicates a strong association, 0.4-0.6 a moderate association, and <0.4 a weak association. Only strong factor loadings over 0.6 were considered for subsequent analyses. Each subject was assigned a derived score for each of the five rotated factors based on the loadings. Independent sample\nt\n-tests were then used to determine whether any of the five factors could differentiate cMild/mod from severe TBI. Mixed linear regression, using age as a covariate, was used to determine if regional DTI metrics and/or factors from the initial imaging time-point could predict 12-month neurocognitive scores. Findings were considered significant if\np\n<\u20090.001 after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, unless otherwise stated. All statistical analyses were performed in SPSS (version 22; Chicago, IL)."

    "Methods": "Study design\nAll study patients were enrolled in the Brain Trauma Research Center (BTRC) database, a prospective observational, cohort study that enrolls patients from a single level I trauma center of a tertiary care institution. The BTRC is located in the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), with the goal of using blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers to determine biochemical changes and TBI recovery. This study utilized consecutively enrolled patients from May 2000 and April 2014 who met the inclusion criteria and the legal-authorized representative (LAR) were approached for proxy consent. Inclusion criteria for the study were the following: 1) age of 16 and 80 years; 2) severe TBI with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 4-8 with clinically indicated head computerized tomography (CT) scan; 3) placement of an external ventricular drain (EVD) for intracranial monitoring and CSF drainage and sampling per standard care; and 4) signed written consent from health care proxies. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, imminent brain death and initial GCS of 3. Patients with GCS score 3 were enrolled but not included in the present study because of overall poor prognosis. For the purposes of this study, other exclusion criteria were missing genotype data for\nBcl-2 rs17759659\nand less than 24\u2009h of ICP monitoring data available through the medical record. The study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board.\n\nBiospecimen acquisition and\nBcl-2\ngenotyping\nSpecimen acquisition and genetic analysis were performed as previously described.\n12\nIn brief, blood samples were collected via peripheral venipuncture or existing arterial catheters within 24\u2009h of presentation and stored at the biospecimens repository at the UPMC Department of Neurological Surgery. DNA analysis was conducted using white blood cells using a salting out technique. Genotyping of\nBcl-2 rs17759659\nwas performed using ABIPrism 7000 Sequence Detection System with commercially available assays and SDS 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems Inc., Carlsbad, CA). Quality control included independent duplication of 10% of genotypes and independent double calls for each sample. Genotyping was performed by lab technicians blinded to demographic data and clinical outcomes.\n\nDemographic and outcome measures\nDemographic and clinical information (age, gender, admission GCS score, mechanism of injury), as well as hourly ICP measurements, were collected by trained research assistants blinded to\nBcl-2\ngenotypes. Age in years was categorized in accordance with the Medical Subject Headings in the National Library of Medicine.\n22\nAdmission GCS scores were dichotomized into 4-6 and 7-8. Hourly ICP measurements in mm Hg from 1 to 120\u2009h (standard duration per institutional protocol) after monitor placement were obtained from clamped EVD recordings. The pressure transducers of all EVDs were leveled to the anatomical tragus. Per institutional protocol for neurocritical monitoring, hourly ICP measurements at a minimum were documented by the nursing staff after 5\u2009min of equilibration with the ICP transducer, confirming continuity of the drainage system, and visualizing an accurate waveform of the patient. Mean ICP, proportion of ICP recordings >20\u2009mm Hg, and proportion of recordings >25\u2009mm Hg were calculated for each patient.\nRadiographic edema was determined by the presence of at least one of the five following findings on head CT: parenchymal herniation, sulcal effacement, ventricular compression, basilar cistern compression or effacement, and loss of gray\u2013white differentiation. Final radiology reports were reviewed and confirmed by two trained research technicians, and any discrepancies were adjudicated by an independent blinded physician. All participants received medical treatment in accordance with the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines for the management of severe TBI.\n23\nNeurosurgical decompression was performed in instances of intracranial hypertension refractory to tiered medical therapy, clinical decline with corresponding new radiographic findings, or focal mass lesion meeting operative criteria.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics are presented as means, standard deviations (SDs) and standard errors (SEs) for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. Group differences in patient demographics and injury characteristics across\nBcl-2 rs17759659\ngenotypes were assessed by Pearson's chi-squared test (X\n2\n) for categorical variables and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables. Fisher's exact test was used to assess for differences in categorical variables when expected counts \u22645. We conducted multi-variable linear regression analyses testing the association between each of three ICP measures and\nrs17759659\ngenotypes using homozygous wildtype genotype (AA) as the reference group while controlling for gender, age, GCS score, and mechanism of injury. Binary logistic regressions were to assess the relationship between genotype and the development of edema and the need for neurosurgical decompression. The adjusted mean differences (B) and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported for predictors in each linear regression analysis. In binary logistic regression, the odds ratio (OR) and associated 95% CIs are reported. Significance was assessed at\np\n=\u20090.05. All analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS; version 25; IBM Corporation, Chicago, IL)."

    "Methods": "The data used in the present study were part of a research program on pediatric TBI that was conducted at Baylor College of Medicine and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Institutional Review Board approval at these institutions was obtained for the current study.\n\nParticipants\nParticipants included 22 children ages 10\u201318 who had previously been hospitalized within 24\u2009h after sustaining complicated (abnormal day-of-injury CT finding) mild, moderate, or severe TBI in early childhood (mean age at injury\u2009=\u20094.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0 years; range\u2009=\u20091\u20138 years). Injury severity was defined by the lowest post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)\n21\nscore obtained at the time of the injury, where those with GCS scores between 13\u201315, 9\u201312, and 3\u20138 are considered to have suffered from mild, moderate, and severe injuries, respectively. Participants were adolescents at the time of imaging (mean age at evaluation\u2009=\u200913.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3 years). Only patients with closed head injury (i.e., acceleration/deceleration, or impact with a blunt object) were recruited to increase homogeneity in pathophysiology. Patients injured as a result of non-accidental trauma (as indicated by medical chart notes) were excluded due to increased risk for repeated head trauma. Participants meeting these criteria were identified by a review of medical records, and the families were contacted to explain the study and enrollment procedures. Twenty typically developing children (TDC) who were demographically similar to the TBI patients (mean age at evaluation\u2009=\u200913.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3) were recruited by community advertising.\nIn addition to recruiting participants with comparable distributions of age and sex in the TBI and TDC groups, recruitment of the TDC participants was conducted to ensure that a Socioeconomic Composite Index (SCI) based on occupational status of the parent, annual household income, and years of maternal education were comparable to that of the children with TBI. The SCI was derived according to the guidelines provided by Yeates and colleagues,\n22\nwhere\nz\n-scores correspond to socioeconomic status (SES) relative to the average of the entire sample. This socioeconomic background information was provided by the parent via questionnaire. Handedness ratio was determined using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory.\n23\nThe informed consent form was approved by the Institutional Review Boards, and parents or legal guardians of the participants provided informed consent. The participants were fluent in English, had no pre-existing major developmental disorder (e.g., autism or mental deficiency), and had not subsequently been hospitalized for brain injury. Of the recruited participants, 34 participants (17 TBI, 17 TDC) had imaging data that were of sufficient quality to be retained in the present analysis. Reasons for exclusion due to poor scan quality included severe motion artifact/poor image resolution (one case), extensive lesions that interfered with cortical reconstruction (two cases), cortical reconstruction errors that were not able to be corrected by editing (one case) and failure of the LGI processing in FreeSurfer (one case); refer to\nSupplementary Table S1\nfor details regarding cases with lesions.

Adaptive behavior consists of the individual's ability to perform daily self-care activities and interact well with others. Appropriate adaptive behavior is based on expected levels of behavior for the individual's same age peer group. Ratings of adaptive behavior reflect the typical performance rather than the potential maximum ability of the individual. The Vineland-II consists of four behavioral domains: Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, Motor Skills (typically administered for children ages 5 years or younger, or for older children with suspected deficits in this domain), and an optional Maladaptive Behavior domain. An Adaptive Behavior Composite score is generated based on the ratings for the individual's ability to perform tasks in the various behavioral domains and is likely the best indicator of overall functional level. Vineland-II standard scores have a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. A subset of the participants with adequate neuroimaging data (16 TBI, 12 TDC) were rated by one of their parents on the Vineland-II questionnaire at the time of testing.\nThe participants were also administered cognitive measures, including the California Verbal Learning Test\u2014Children's version (CVLT-C; a measure of word-list learning and delayed recall) and select subtests of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS). Specifically, the D-KEFS Color Word Interference Test Inhibition/Switching scaled scores and D-KEFS Verbal Fluency Category Switching were included as measures of cognitive flexibility. Performance on these measures was previously reported for this data set.\n25\n,\n26\nHowever, the current study examines performance on these cognitive measures in relation to brain gyrification, as this was not within the scope of the previous studies. With the exception of one TBI participant who did not have D-KEFS Color Word Interference Test scores, all cognitive test score data was collected from all participants.\n\nMagnetic resonance image acquisition and processing\nPatients were scanned at the Brain Imaging Research Center at the Psychiatric Research Institute of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (7 TBI, 7 TDC) or at Texas Children's Hospital (10 TBI, 10 TDC) on Philips 3T Achieva (Philips, Cleveland, OH) scanners. Both locations used scanners that have similar platforms and the same software release to increase the compatibility of the data across sites. Volumetric T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired using a 32-channel head coil with the following acquisition parameters: 170 contiguous 1-mm thick slices, matrix size\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009mm, repetition time\u2009=\u20096.95\u2009msec, echo time\u2009=\u20093.13\u2009msec, field of view\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009mm. All scans were evaluated by a board-certified neuroradiologist with specific expertise in pediatrics, who also recorded all observed lesions.\nCortical reconstruction, including segmentation and volumetric analysis, was performed using the FreeSurfer structural image analysis tools (v.5.1.0;\nhttp://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu\n), as described previously.\n27\n,\n28\nResults for each subject were visually inspected, and manual editing was performed to optimize accuracy, when necessary. Once the three-dimensional cortical reconstruction was complete, the LGI technique\n15\nwas utilized in order to quantify the gyrification of the cortex over the extent of the whole cortical surface. Smoothing was performed using a 5-mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel prior to statistical analysis. White matter volumes for each participant were also derived from FreeSurfer using well-described standard pipelines for cortical segmentation and parcellation. This is a surface-based, region of interest-based metric that includes all white matter within the cerebrum.\n\nStatistical analysis\nTwo-tailed independent\nt\n-tests were used to examine group differences on demographic variables, such as age at evaluation (years), handedness ratio, and SES, as measured by the SCI for household income, occupational status of the parent, and maternal years of education. Two-tailed independent\nt\n-tests also were used to examine group differences on white matter volume. The data for all 34 participants were included in this analysis. Chi-squared analysis was used to examine group differences in sex, ethnicity, and study site.\nTwo-tailed independent\nt\n-tests were also performed to examine group differences on the Vineland-II Composite Scores. Within the TBI group, Pearson correlations were used to evaluate the relationship between injury severity (i.e., GCS) and standard scores on the parent-rated Vineland-II Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, and Adaptive Behavior Composite scales. Supratentorial brain volume (controlling for intracranial volume) was compared between groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The threshold for statistical significance was set at\np\n<\u20090.05, and Cohen's\nd\nwas utilized as a measure of effect size for between-group comparison, where\nd\n\u2265\u2009|0.20|, |0.50|, and |0.80| was interpreted as small, medium, and large, respectively.\n29\nCortical surface-based statistical maps were created by fitting a general linear model at each surface vertex for the following: 1) LGI differences between groups; 2) surface area; 3) the relation of LGI to the Vineland-II Composite Scores within the entire sample; 4) the relation of LGI to cognitive measures (i.e., CVLT-C Total Learning T-scores, CVLT-C Delayed Recall scaled scores, D-KEFS Color Word Interference Test Inhibition/Switching scaled scores, and D-KEFS Verbal Fluency Category Switching scaled scores) within the entire sample; and 5) the relation between LGI and injury severity (i.e., GCS) within the TBI group. A Monte Carlo simulation\n30\nwas used to perform cluster-wise correction for multiple comparisons (vertex-wise threshold of\np\n<\u20090.05; 10,000 iterations). Cluster-wise probabilities are reported, which represent the likelihood of finding a maximum cluster of the same size or larger during simulation. A negative sign was used when correcting for multiple comparisons for the between-group LGI comparisons, given the observed uncorrected results and prior findings from lesion studies in rodents.\n13\nAbsolute signs were used for all other corrections for multiple comparisons.\nTo assess for other brain abnormalities that may be present in patients with TBI, two-tailed independent\nt\n-tests were used to examine group differences in white matter volume. Additionally, within the entire sample, Pearson correlations were used to evaluate the relationship between white matter volume and standard scores on parent-rated Vineland-II scales that demonstrated a significant relationship with LGI.\nFinally, to assess whether study site or observable lesions affected the LGI results, we conducted the between-group comparison of LGI two additional times as supplementary analyses\u2014with study site included as a covariate, and excluding two additional participants with lesions that may have subtly affected cortical reconstruction (in contrast to the two participants that were originally excluded from the analyses due to significant interference of lesions on cortical reconstruction;\nSupplementary Table S1\n)."

    "Methods": "Recruitment\nThis is a single-arm longitudinal study of the feasibility and acceptability of smartphone-based relaxation therapy for PPTH. Subjects were recruited from the New York University (NYU) Concussion Center call list. People who called for an NYU Concussion Center appointment from June 2017 to May 2018 were screened for eligibility from the Concussion Center Line call record, a spreadsheet which maintained basic information about callers including age, sex, date of injury, and mechanism of injury. A team of research volunteers then contacted those who screened eligible based on age and date of injury to assess whether people were potentially eligible. To meet inclusion criteria, subjects had to meet ICHD-3 criteria for PPTH secondary to mTBI, be 3\u201312 months post-injury, have four or more headache days a month, and be between ages 18 and 85. Patients who had previous behavioral treatment for headache in the past year were excluded. Those eligible and interested in participating in the study were scheduled for an in-person recruitment session lasting from 30 to 60\u2009min, during which informed consent was obtained and a baseline questionnaire was completed. Participants were questioned about their symptoms according to the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool.\n22\nThe PMR intervention was explained, and the RELAXaHEAD app\n23\nwas downloaded onto subjects' smartphones. Research volunteers did a session of PMR with the participant in person.\n\nIntervention\nStudy participants were asked to use the RELAXaHEAD app, which was iteratively developed with input from both headache specialists and persons with migraines. Its development has been detailed.\n23\nIn brief, the app has the same PMR as in the SMILE (Dry Eye after Small Incision Lenticule Extraction) study,\n24\nbut also includes a daily headache diary. We selected PMR, a standardized, evidence-based behavioral treatment used for headache since the 1980s,\n25\n,\n26\nas the behavioral intervention because of its success as a technique that patients can do independently.\n27\n,\n28\nOur RELAXaHEAD app has backend analytics built in to record the amount of time spent playing the PMR. Pain intensity, duration, and medications taken can be recorded using the app. In addition, the RELAXaHEAD app allows the use of reminders and timely follow-up of non-compliant participants with real-time investigator data-monitoring capabilities. The RELAXaHEAD application was developed using a platform called IRODY, and NYU Medical Center Information Technology approved its development.\nParticipants were asked to input their headache information and play the PMR audio files for 20\u2009min per day for 3 months. Duration and frequency were based on the SMILE study.\n24\nThe first 7 participants enrolled received no compensation. After receiving a pilot grant, a compensation of $25 for initial enrollment and $1 for each day of entered data for up to a total of $115 by an online Amazon gift card was provided to subsequent participants. For participants who did not use the app for 3 days, contact attempts were made once a week by phone with reminders to use the app.\n\nAssessments and outcomes\nParticipants were contacted monthly to collect data. Monthly phone-call surveys were performed, acquiring headache severity and symptoms, PMR satisfaction, and obstacles. Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) score assessments were added onto surveys later in the study. Three phone-call attempts were made for each survey, followed by an e-mail. Participants were prompted to complete the PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) Emotional Distress scale for depression and anxiety through the app every month as well.\nOur primary outcome measures were 1) number of days of headache diary use, 2) number of days of PMR use, and 3) amount of time spent playing the PMR. We also sought to conduct further analyses involving headache days, HIT-6 scores, and PROMIS Emotional Distress scale for depression and anxiety.\n\nSamples size and statistical analysis\nParticipants were screened for eligibility and recruited into a single experimental arm. Participants' app usage and PMR compliance were measured through the backend app data corresponding to their username, which showed which dates data were logged, and which dates the PMR recording was played and for how long. Number of PMR days and days data were input into the app were averaged per month, over the first, second, and third months of participants' study period. HIT-6 and PROMIS scores were calculated according to their scoring systems (\nTable 1\n). Descriptive statistics were conducted. Missing surveys were not included in statistical analysis.

    "Methods": "Animals\nStudies were performed using adult male C57Bl/6J mice (10\u201312 weeks old; Taconic Biosciences Inc., Germantown, NY). Mice were housed in shoebox cages (4\u20135 mice in each cage) at least 1 week prior to any procedures in a room (22\u201323\u00b0C) with a 12-h/12-h light\u2013dark cycle. Food and water were provided\nad libitum\n. The mice were handled and weighed daily for 3 days prior to surgery. Procedures were conducted from 10:00\nam\nto 5:00\npm\nin a quiet room. All protocols involving the use of animals complied with the\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\npublished by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (DHEW publication NIH 85- 23-2985), and were approved by the University of Maryland Animal Use Committee.\n\nExperimental design\nC57Bl/6 mice (\nn\n=\u200911\u201312/group) underwent either CCI or sham surgery. Sensorimotor function was assessed using the beamwalk and rotarod tasks and gait analysis was performed using the CatWalk task on 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post-injury (dpi). For each task, mice were habituated to each behavioral room for 30\u2009min prior to testing. The tests were completed in the following order: CatWalk, beamwalk, and rotarod, with an inter-trial interval (ITI) of 1\u2009h and 30\u2009min to allow for recovery. The rationale for preforming tests in this order was to reduce stress on mice and avoid motor practice effects in the CatWalk task (primary outcome). At 28\u2009dpi, mice were anesthetized (100\u2009mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, I.P.) and transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.9% saline (100\u2009mL), followed by 300\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and processed for histological outcome measures.\n\nCCI\nOur custom-designed CCI injury device consists of a microprocessor-controlled pneumatic impactor with a 3.5\u2009mm diameter tip. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane evaporated in a gas mixture containing 70% N\n2\nO and 30% O\n2\nand administered through a nose mask (induction at 4% and maintenance at 2%). Depth of anesthesia was assessed by monitoring respiration rate and pedal withdrawal reflexes. Mice were placed on a heated pad, and core body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C. The head was mounted in a stereotaxic frame, and the surgical site was clipped and cleaned with Nolvasan and ethanol scrubs. A 10\u2009mm midline incision was made over the skull, the skin and fascia were reflected, and a 5\u2009mm craniotomy was made on the central aspect of the left temporoparietal bone, between bregma and lambda. The impounder tip of the injury device was then extended to its full stroke distance (44\u2009mm), positioned to the surface of the exposed dura, and reset to impact the cortical surface. Moderate-level CCI (\nn\n=\u200911) was induced using an impactor velocity of 6\u2009m/sec and a deformation depth of 2\u2009mm as previously described.\n11\u201314\nAfter injury, the incision was closed with interrupted 6-0 silk sutures, anesthesia was terminated, and the animal was placed into a heated cage to maintain normal core temperature for 45\u2009min post-injury. The CCI model replicates several important secondary injury mechanisms after TBI, including apoptosis, edema, and secondary neuroinflammation,\n9\nbut does not produce acute intracranial hypertension. Sham mice (\nn\n=\u200912) underwent the same procedure as TBI mice except for the craniotomy and impact. All mice were monitored daily post-injury.\n\nBeamwalk\nThe beamwalk device consists of a narrow wooden beam 5\u2009mm wide and 120\u2009cm in length, which is suspended 1\u2009m above the ground. The beamwalk test is a valuable predictor of fine-motor coordination differences between CCI and sham-operated mice, and was conducted as previously described.\n12\u201314\nBriefly, the mouse was placed on the beamwalk and the number of foot faults for the right hindlimb was recorded over 50 steps. At the end of the beam there was an enclosed dark box, and mice remained there for \u223c20\u2009sec after beam crossing. This allowed mice to associate transvering the beam with the safety of the box. In order to achieve a baseline level of performance, each mouse underwent 3 days of training prior to injury, with an acceptance level of fewer than 10 foot faults per 50 steps. The test was performed at 0 (immediately before CCI/sham surgery), 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28\u2009dpi.\n\nRotarod\nThe rotarod test was used to assess motor function and balance as previously described.\n23\nThe mouse was placed on a five-lane rotarod device (IITC Life Science, Inc., Woodland Hills, CA), and the latency to fall of the accelerating rotarod was recorded. The rotarod accelerated from 1\u2009rpm to 30\u2009rpm over 90\u2009sec, with each trial again lasting a maximum of 120\u2009sec. Trials ended when mice either fell off the rod or clung to the rod as it made two complete rotations. In order to achieve a basal level of performance, each mouse underwent 3 days of training prior to injury, in which three trials per day cconducted, with a 10\u2009min ITI between trials. The rotarod test was performed on 0 (immediately before CCI/sham surgery), 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28\u2009dpi. Individual scores from three trials were averaged and evaluated relative to their baseline latencies.\n\nGait analysis\nGait was assessed for 3 days prior to CCI/sham surgery, and at 0 (immediately before CCI surgery), 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28\u2009dpi, using the CatWalk Automated Gait Analysis System (Noldus Information Technology Inc., Leesburg, VA), as previously described.\n20\n,\n21\nBriefly, in a dark room, mice were placed on the walkway and allowed to traverse from one end to a goal box at the other end. Direct contact between the paw and the glass surface generates light reflection in the form of illuminated footprints. Footprint images were video-recorded by a camera positioned under the walkway. All mice completed three consecutive runs. Runs with walk velocities >30% variation were excluded from analysis. The images from each trial were converted into digital signature and processed using CatWalk XT 9.1 software with a minimum threshold set at 80 (arbitrary units [a.u.] ranging from 0 to 225). Mean scores from three consecutive trials (per animal/time points) were analyzed for statistical significance. Following footprint identification and labeling, static, temporal, dynamic gait parameters and inter-limb coordination parameters were measured for the right and left hind paws (HP) in each trial. Gait analysis parameters included:\n1.\nStatic gait parameters\nIntensity: Describes the total floor area contacted by the paw during the stance phase and is expressed in square pixels.\nPrint area: Represents the complete print including all frames that makes up a stance.\nPrint width: Describes the width of the print area and is expressed in pixels.\nPrint length: Describes the length of the print area and is expressed in pixels.\n2.\nTemporal gait parameters\nStance: Describes the time duration during which the paw is in contact with the glass plate.\nSwing: Describes the time interval between two consecutive paw placements of the same paw in which the paw is not in contact with the glass plate.\nStep cycle duration: Is the duration between two consecutive surface contacts of the same paw.\nDuty cycle: Is the percentage of the time spent in the stance phase relative to the entire step cycle.\n3.\nDynamic gait parameters\nWalk speed: Represents the distance that the mice walk per second. It is calculated as the sum of the stride length divided by Max Contact\nlast step\n-Max Contact\nfirst step\n.\nStand Index: Measure for the speed at which the paw loses contact with the surface.\n4.\nGait parameters relative to paw placement\nPrint position: This is the distance in cm between the position of the hind paw and the position of the previously placed front paw on the same side of the body (ipsilateral) and in the same step cycle. A positive value of the print position indicates that the hind paw is placed behind the front paw. A negative value of the print position indicates that the hind paw is placed in front of the front paw.\nBase of support (BOS): Describes the distance between the mass-midpoints of two fore and hind prints at the max contact during each step cycle. The results from each step cycle are averaged and expressed in mm in each trial.\n5.\nGait parameters of inter-limb coordination\nRegularity index (RI; %): Is an index for the degree of inter-limb coordination during gait, as measured by the number of normal step sequence patterns (NSSP), multiplied by the number of paws and divided by the number of paw placements; RI\u2009=\u2009100%\u2009\u00d7\u2009(NSSP X 4)/no. of paw placements.\n% Support time: Describes the relative duration of contact with the glass plate of all combinations of number of paws. This combination range from no paw contact (zero), using a single paw, diagonal two paws (right front [RF] and left hind [LH] or left front [LF] and right hind [RH]), lateral two paws (RF and RH or LF and LH), girdle two paws (RF and LF or RH and LH), three paws, or four paws.\n\nLesion volume\nSixty micrometer coronal sections from mice were stained with cresyl violet (FD NeuroTechnologies, Baltimore, MD), dehydrated, and mounted for analysis (\nn\n=\u200910 per group). Lesion volume was quantified based on the Cavalieri method of unbiased stereology using Stereoinvestigator Software (MBF Biosciences, Williston, VT) as previously described.\n13\n,\n14\nBriefly, the lesion volume was quantified by outlining the missing tissue on the injured hemisphere using the Cavalieri estimator with a grid spacing of 0.1\u2009mm. Every eighth section from a total of 96 sections was analyzed beginning from a random start point.\n\nStatistical analysis\nQuantitative data were expressed as mean + standard errors of the mean (SEM). Normality testing was performed and data sets passed normality (D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test), and therefore parametric statistical analysis was performed. Beamwalk, rotarod, and CatWalk were analyzed by one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the interactions of time and groups, followed by\npost-hoc\nadjustments using a Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. Stereological data were analyzed using an unpaired Student\nt\ntest. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Program, Version 3.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). A\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Participants\nIn this longitudinal cohort study,\n32\nwe recruited patients with mTBI prospectively from two emergency departments (EDs); the level 1 trauma center at St. Olavs Hospital and the general-practitioner\u2013run Trondheim municipal clinic. These two EDs evaluate the vast majority of acute mTBI in Trondheim and adjacent regions. Both EDs are part of the public healthcare system in Norway, located at the university hospital campus, and use the same CT service. These two EDs serve \u223c230,000 residents in Trondheim and adjacent regions in addition to \u223c18,000 students (who are officially registered as residents in other parts of the country). The inclusion period was between April 1, 2014 and December 5, 2015.\nParticipants were included if they were between 16 and 60 years of age and had sustained an mTBI according to the World Health Organization criteria.\n33\nPatients had to have a witnessed loss of consciousness (LOC) <30\u2009min, post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) <24\u2009h, or evident lesions on CT, in addition to a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score between 13 and 15. Exclusion criteria were: 1) non-fluency in Norwegian or residence in another country; 2) any\nsevere\nongoing alcohol/drug abuse, psychiatric or somatic disease, or condition that would complicate follow-up; 3) any previous complicated mild, moderate, or severe TBI, stroke, or other acquired brain injuries; 4) severe concurrent multi-trauma, such as spinal cord injury, internal bleeding, or severe fractures; and 5) presentation to the ED >72\u2009h of injury. A main aim of the overarching cohort study was to evaluate neuroimaging findings from CT and MRI.\n32\nPatients with previous\ncomplicated\nmTBI were excluded to reduce the likelihood of including patients with\npre-existing\ngross brain pathology. Apart from this, we aimed to be as inclusive as possible to optimize the clinical representativeness in the sample.\nTrauma controls with orthopedic injuries (e.g., sprains or fractures) were included between April 1, 2015 and December 1, 2017 from the same two clinics as the patients with mTBI. Trauma controls were identified by screening patient lists at the ED at the municipal clinic and lists of referrals to the hospital. They were evaluated for inclusion if they were between 16 and 60 years of age and had sustained an orthopedic injury. They could not have any evidence of head or neck trauma, polytrauma, or injury to their dominant upper extremity. Other exclusion criteria were identical to those applied for the mTBI group.\nCommunity controls, between 16 and 60 years of age, were included from a convenience sample recruited from employees and students at the university hospital as well as from friends and family of the patients with mTBI, or from employees and students at the university hospital. Exclusion criteria were the same as for the patients with mTBI, with the additional criteria that the community controls did not receive any ongoing treatment for psychiatric disorders. Participants in the community control group were matched at group level to the mTBI group in terms of age, sex, and length of education in years, whereas participants in the trauma control group were matched at group level to the mTBI patients in terms of age and sex.\n\nProcedure\nDetailed procedures for recruitment to the study have been described elsewhere.\n32\nPatients with mTBI were assessed at four time points (\nFig. 1\n). Within 72\u2009h of their injury, the patients with mTBI completed a structured interview containing questions related to injury characteristics, demographics, and premorbid health problems. Clinical MRI (3 Tesla) was performed within 72\u2009h of injury. At 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months after injury, patients with mTBI completed a structured interview and questionnaires. Trauma controls underwent the same procedures as patients with mTBI, except MRI. Community controls also underwent the same procedures as patients with mTBI, excluding the first visit (within 72\u2009h of injury).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nTimeline of follow-up. MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; mTBI, mild traumatic brain injury; TBI, traumatic brain injury.\nA subgroup of patients with mTBI did not meet at the hospital, but answered interviews over the telephone and sent completed questionnaires by mail. Participants who met at the hospital for their assessments received a gift certificate (\u223cEUR 54) for each attendance. All participants gave their informed consent. The project was performed according to the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK) in Norway (REK 2013/754).\n\nMeasures\nBrain imaging\nNon-contrast head CT was performed on a Siemens Somatom Sensation 64-row scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) in 299 of the patients as a part of routine clinical assessment. In addition, brain MRI scans were acquired on a 3 Tesla Siemens Skyra System (32-channel head coil; Siemens Healthineers) within 72\u2009h of injury for 198 patients with mTBI. The following sequences were included: three-dimensional T\n1\n, T\n2\n, susceptibility-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. All CT and MRI scans were read by experienced radiologists,\n34\nand patients with mTBI and intracranial traumatic findings on CT and/or MRI were considered to have complicated mTBI.\nStructured interviews\nIn the first interview, completed within 72\u2009h of injury, participants were asked to provide information about cause of injury, LOC, PTA, pre- and post-injury medication use, pain, previous health problems, and previous uncomplicated mTBI. Information about previous uncomplicated mTBI was based on self-report as recommended in other studies.\n35\nThree subsequent interviews were performed at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months after injury to assess post-injury problems and functioning.\nPre-injury psychiatric disorders\nA structured interview during the first study visit was performed to assess previous psychiatric history. Participants were asked to report and describe any previous psychiatric disorders. Participants that reported psychiatric disorders were further asked to describe the onset and duration (if relevant) of the disorder and to what degree the disorder affected their daily life. Based on information from the structured interview, patients were categorized as having a pre-injury psychiatric disorder or not.\nIncreased sleep need\nParticipants were asked to report their average total sleep time during the 2 weeks before inclusion in the study (i.e., before the injury for the patient groups). Second, participants were asked whether they experienced any increased sleep need after injury. Participants who answered\nyes\nto this question were further asked to report the duration (in days) of this increased sleep. Finally, participants were asked to report their average total sleep time in the period they experienced this increased sleep need. Increased total sleep time of >1\u2009h is commonly used as a measure of increased sleep need in TBI research.\n36\u201338\nWe therefore classified patients with mTBI into an increased sleep need group that reported to sleep >1\u2009h longer after injury than their average total sleep time before the injury and a group that did not experience increased sleep need. We applied the same dichotomization for trauma controls.\nPoor sleep quality\nThree items from the Insomnia Severity Index\n39\nwere included to investigate symptoms of insomnia. These items were selected based on being direct measures of insomnia according to the diagnostic manual DSM-5,\n6\nnamely subjective difficulties falling asleep (sleep onset insomnia), difficulties staying asleep (maintenance insomnia), and unwanted early morning awakenings (terminal insomnia). Participants were asked to rate how much of a problem each item had been during the last 2 weeks using a 5-point Likert-type scale, 0 to 4 (0\u2009=\u2009No problem, 1\u2009=\u2009A mild problem, 2\u2009=\u2009A moderate problem, 3\u2009=\u2009A severe problem, and 4\u2009=\u2009A very severe problem). Participants were classified as poor sleepers if they reported at least severe difficulties on one of these three items, which is in line with criterion A of Insomnia Disorder in DSM-5.\n6\nQuestionnaires\nPain map with Numeric Rating Scale\nParticipants were asked whether they experienced any pain beyond that of everyday mundane pain after their injury. They were then asked to rate the pain intensity, using an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) from 0 to 10, and to indicate the location of their pain using a body map.\nExcessive daytime sleepiness: Epworth Sleepiness Scale\nThe Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) consists of eight items measuring self-reported excessive daytime sleepiness.\n40\nThe eight items represent real-life situations where the participants must rate their chance of dozing off using a 4-point scale from 0 to 3. Higher scores indicate higher chance of dozing off. Total score indicates the extent of self-reported sleep propensity. The Norwegian version of the ESS has high validity\n12\nand high reliability.\n41\nAccording to studies comparing the ESS to objectively measured sleepiness,\n42\nwe applied a cutoff of 13 and above.\nFatigue: Fatigue Severity Scale\nThe Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) measures feelings of fatigue, with nine items rated on a 7-point scale from 1 to 7.\n43\nHigher total scores indicate higher levels of fatigue. A total mean score of 4 was originally defined as clinically significant fatigue.\n43\nThe Norwegian version of FSS has been shown to have satisfactory psychometric properties.\n44\nAccording to a validation study in a Norwegian sample, we applied a cutoff of 5 and above.\n44\nPatients with mild TBI and trauma controls completed all the interviews and questionnaires at all time points. Community controls did not answer the questions about increased sleep need, but answered poor sleep quality questions at the 2 weeks after injury time point, excessive daytime sleepiness at the 3 and 12 months after injury time points, and fatigue at the 2 weeks and 12 months after injury time points.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe performed attrition analyses and investigated differences between participants with missing data and participants with complete data on demographic variables, using chi-square tests and independent-sample\nt\n-tests to evaluate the pattern of missing data. Based on these attrition analyses, a missing at random, but not missing\ncompletely\nat random, assumption was most reasonable.\n45\nChi-square tests and independent-sample\nt\n-tests were used to investigate whether the control groups were successfully matched on a group level with the mTBI group on variables of sex, age, and total years of completed education. We also performed chi-square tests, independent-sample\nt\n-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and Kruskal-Wallis tests to evaluate other group differences on key demographic- and injury-related variables.\nWe used mixed logistic regression, a generalized linear mixed model for binary outcomes, to investigate differences in increased sleep need, poor sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, and fatigue over time between patients with mTBI and trauma controls. The models included the fixed factors time, group, and their interaction and a random intercept on logit scale to account for within-subject dependencies. Additional mixed logistic regression models, based on data from time points where community controls had available data, were used to compare patients with mTBI to trauma controls as well as community controls. Data for community controls were available for fatigue at 2 weeks and 12 months after injury and excessive daytime sleepiness at 3 and 12 months after injury. A logistic regression model was used to compare patients with mTBI to trauma controls and community controls on poor sleep quality 2 weeks after injury (the time point at which community controls had available data). For all analyses performed,\np\nvalues <0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nTo investigate the effects of complicated mTBI (intracranial lesions visible on MRI or CT) on SWD and fatigue, we performed mixed logistic regression models to investigate differences in SWD and fatigue between patients with complicated mTBI, uncomplicated mTBI, and trauma controls. Community controls were not included in the models comparing patients with complicated and uncomplicated mTBI because they did not have data on all time points. We controlled for age, sex, and pre-injury psychiatric disorders in all models.\nTo investigate the overlap between increased sleep need, poor sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, and fatigue, we performed a frequency count to investigate the degree of overlap between these four problems at the respective time points.\nThe data handling, attrition analyses, and investigation of whether the groups were successfully matched were performed in SPSS software (version 25; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). The mixed logistic regression analyses as well as logistic regression analysis were performed in STATA software (version 15; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX), and overlap figures were created with the R package, eulerr (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).\n46"

    "Methods": "Study design\nAll samples included in this analysis came from participants enrolled in the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC) Multicenter Prospective Longitudinal Study (PLS), a multi-site observational study of mTBI late effects among post-9/11 era veterans and service members, which is ongoing in the Long Term Impact of Military Brain Injury Consortium (LIMBIC), with approval by all associated institutional review boards (IRBs). In this analysis, we included samples from 153 participants with full clinical data and associated plasma for exosomal miRNA (exomiR) characterization.\n\nParticipants\nLIMBIC-CENC PLS participants were recruited from four Veteran Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) (Richmond, VA; Tampa, FL; Houston, TX; San Antonio, TX) focusing on post-9/11 era service members and veterans who were combat deployed and were diagnosed with a spectrum of mTBI exposures (ranging from no events to multiple combat-related mTBI). Exclusion criteria included the following: (1) history of moderate or severe TBI as defined by either (a) initial Glasgow Coma Scale <13, (b) coma duration >0.5\u2009h, (c) post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) duration >24\u2009h, or (d) traumatic intracranial lesion on head computerized tomography; or (2) history of (a) major neurological disorder (e.g., spinal cord injury), or (b) major psychiatric disorder (e.g., schizophrenia) with \u201cmajor\u201d defined as resulting in a significant decrement in functional status or loss of independent living capacity. For these analyses, the primary independent variable was mTBI history as will be determined and measured. In this analysis, we included samples from 153 subjects with full clinical data and associated plasma for exomiRNA characterization.\n\nDetermination of TBI\nThe LIMBIC-CENC PLS assesses participants for lifetime potential concussive events (PCEs) and assigns an mTBI diagnosis for each event based on Department of Defense (DoD)-Veterans Administration (VA) common definition of mTBI, using the Virginia Commonwealth University Retrospective Concussion Diagnostic Interview (VCU rCDI).\n20\nUsing these TBI determinations, participants were classified into various TBI groupings for the following analysis groups: (1) repetitive (\u2265 3) mTBIs, (2) 1\u20132 mTBIs, and (3) controls (no TBI history).\n\nPotential concussive event identification and TBI diagnoses\nThis study's structured interview process entailed screening for all PCEs during military deployments and across the entire lifetime, including childhood, using a modification of the Ohio State University TBI Identification (OSU TBI-ID) instrument.\n21\nEach PCE identified was evaluated to determine whether or not it was a true clinical mTBI via a detailed structured interview, the Virginia Commonwealth University retrospective Concussion Diagnostic Interview (VCU rCDI). Each VCU rCDI renders a preliminary TBI diagnosis of either mTBI with LOC/PTA, mTBI without LOC/PTA, or not mTBI, through an embedded algorithm using the structured interview data and based on the DoD/VA common definition of mTBI. Every preliminary TBI diagnosis is reviewed and vetted against the unstructured free text portion of the interview, and against any available medical documents recorded in proximity to the event (i.e., first responder, emergency department, or in-theatre documentation). Using this process, the site principal investigator confirms or overrides every preliminary mTBI diagnosis to yield the final diagnosis. The event is also assessed for TBI severity to ensure eligibility (any severity greater than mild was excluded from this study). If any doubt remains as to TBI diagnosis, the event is adjudicated by a central diagnosis committee consisting of national experts in TBI.\n\nAssessment of post-concussive symptoms\nThe Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) was used to assess the post-concussive symptom severity. The NSI consists of a 22-item assessment with a three\u2013four factor structure (somatic/sensory, affective, and cognitive); higher total scores indicate more severe symptoms.\n22\n,\n23\n\nPlasma sample processing and exomiR isolation\nWhole blood samples were collected and centrifuged at 3000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min (4\u00b0C) within 2\u2009h of being drawn. Plasma was aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C until analyzed. Plasma samples were thawed on ice and centrifuged at 3000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min to pellet and remove circulating cells or debris. ExomiRs were extracted from 400\u2009mL of plasma supernatant by using Qiagen ExoRNeasy Serum Plasma Kits (Qiagen, MD, USA) as per manufacturer's instructions and eluted in 20\u2009\u03bcL water. The RNA extract was then cleaned and concentrated using the RNA Clean and Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research Corp., CA, USA) and finally eluted in 10\u2009\u03bcL of water. The concentration, purity, and integrity of the exomiR product was determined with Bioanalyzer (Agilent, CA, USA) and Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA).\n\nExomiR profiling analysis\nAnalysis was performed on all samples by using nCounter\n\u00ae\nHuman v3 miRNA Expression Panels (NanoString Technologies, WA, USA), which contains 798 miRNA probes. This is currently the maximum number of probes developed and available for evaluation in humans. Probes for housekeeping genes such as beta-actin (ACTB), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ribosomal protein L19 (RPL19), and ribosomal protein lateral stalk subunit P0 (RPLP0), as well as for endogenous exomiRs for\nArabidopsis thaliana\nmiR159a (ath-miR159a),\nCaenorhabditis elegans\n(cel)-miR-248 and miR254, and\nOryza sativa\n(osa)-miR 414 and 442 are incorporated in the code sets and were used for analysis along with positive and negative controls. All hybridizations took place over 18\u2009h, and all counts were obtained at MAX mode, creating 555 images per sample for analysis. Analysis of raw miRNA data was performed using the nSolver analysis software version 4.0 (NanoString technologies). Code count normalization was performed with the geometric median for the 50 highest expressed genes. Genes with a fold change >1.2 and an adjusted\np\nvalue <0.05 after correction for multiple comparisons were considered differentially expressed. Heatmap and hierarchical cluster analyses were used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs among the TBI groups compared with controls without a history of lifetime TBI.\n\nNetwork analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)\nDifferentially expressed exomiRNA were investigated by IPA (Ingenuity Systems Inc., CA, USA). Briefly, miRNA outcomes from nCounter analysis and the miRNA target genes defined in miRWalk (\nhttp://mirwalk.umm.uni-heidelberg.de\n) were uploaded into Qiagen's IPA system for core pathway analysis. IPA was performed to identify established human disorders and gene functions and networks that best correlate with differentially expressed exomiR outcomes as well as to categorize target genes with respect to established diseases and specific cellular functions.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics for all demographic and clinical variables were calculated using SPSS Statistics (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA;\nTable 1\n). Comparisons were made among the three groups using \u03c7\n2\ntests for categorical and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables.\nP\nvalues <0.05 were considered significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction.\nTable 1.\nDemographics and Clinical Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nControls\nCases\nSignificance\np\nvalue\nnoTBI (\nn\n=\u200935)\n1-2TBI (\nn\n=\u200973)\nrTBI (n\u2009=\u200945)\nAge, mean (SD), y\n41.60 (11.27)\n38.90 (10.40)\n41.16 (10.22)\nF\n2,150\n=\u20091.043\n0.355\nMale,\nn\n(%)\n31 (88.6)\n66 (90.4)\n36 (80.0)\nx\n2\n=\u20092.763\n0.251\nEducation,\nn\n(%)\nx\n2\n=\u20095.850\n0.440\nSome high school\n1 (2.9)\n0\n0\nHigh school graduate or GED\n5 (14.3)\n9 (12.3)\n5 (11.1)\nSome college or technical school\n14 (40.0)\n29 (39.7)\n24 (53.3)\nCollege graduate or higher\n15 (42.9)\n35 (47.9)\n16 (35.6)\nTotal Number of TBIs, mean (SD)\n0.00\n1.48 (0.50)\n4.13 (1.55)\nF\n2,150\n=\u2009220.98\n0.000\nNumber of general TBIs, mean (SD)\n0.00\n1.00 (0.71)\n2.98 (1.42)\nF\n2,150\n=\u2009115.29\n0.000\nYears since last TBI, mean (SD)\n0.00\n11.18 (9.32)\n7.78 (4.51)\nF\n1,116\n=\u20095.23\n0.024\nNSI, mean (SD)\nNSI total\n16.17 (15.67)\n28.01 (16.70)\n33.96 (14.31)\nF\n2,149\n=\u200912.74\n0.000\n*\nSomatic\n3.43 (4.29)\n7.14 (5.10)\n9.31 (4.78)\nF\n2,149\n=\u200914.73\n0.000\n*\nAffective\n6.91 (6.09)\n10.70 (6.18)\n11.76 (5.05)\nF\n2,150\n=\u20097.38\n0.001\n*\nCognitive\n3.51 (3.65)\n5.45 (3.7)\n6.93 (3.48)\nF\n2,150\n=\u20098.68\n0.000\n*\nVestibular\n1.11 (1.94)\n2.49 (2.52)\n3.38 (2.17)\nF\n2,150\n=\u20099.61\n0.000\n*\nOpen in a separate window\nNumber of general TBIs refers to the number of TBIs caused by non-blast blunt injury.

The experimental facilities are certified by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.\n\nExperimental overview\nWe utilized a thin, highly flexible fiberoptic probe employing DCS to test the ability of the device to measure spinal cord blood flow at the site of gradually increasing spinal distraction. Distraction was halted when the blood flow reached 50% of baseline. Additionally, in a subset of animals, we monitored blood flow cranial or both cranial and caudal to the site of distraction to test the ability of the device to detect regional changes in blood flow; that is, axially resolving the location of ischemia along the spine. Finally, in another subset of animals, we successfully utilized MEP monitoring during spinal cord distraction. Animals recovered overnight. On the morning after surgery, animals underwent a neurobehavioral assessment and were euthanized. Immediately thereafter, spinal cords were harvested for histopathological analysis.\n\nSheep model and sample size justification\nExperiments were performed in a Dorset sheep model. The sheep spine is similar in size and physiological properties to that of humans.\n31\nThe sheep model has been used extensively for research using similar devices, such as cerebrospinal catheters, spinal stimulators, epidural catheters, and both endovascular and open vascular aortic interventions.\n32\u201335\nTen healthy male and female Dorset sheep 2\u20133 years old weighing \u223c65\u2009kg were used for the study. Our\na priori\nsample size calculation suggested that eight sheep would be necessary to identify a difference in blood flow at the site of distraction of 50% (power of 0.8; significance 0.05), assuming a 25% standard deviation.\nA priori\nsamples sizes were not calculated based on secondary neurobehavioral or neurohistopathological outcomes. Animals were housed in individual, adjacent stalls permitting interaction as well as monitoring of individual water and food consumption, per local veterinary policy. Surgeries began at 0800 local time.\n\nSurgical procedures\nAnimals were pre-treated with glycopyrrolate (0.02\u2009mg/kg, intramuscular) in their pens before transport to the surgical suite. Anesthesia was induced with ketamine (10\u201320\u2009mg/kg intramuscular). After this step, an intravenous catheter was placed to permit use of intravenous agents and to deepen the anesthetic for intubation. Femoral artery and central jugular intravenous cannula were placed after anesthetic induction to continuously measure the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and provide intravenous infusions of anesthesia. Animals were maintained on isoflurane 2.0\u20133.5% during surgical exposure, supplemented with fentanyl (5\u201310\u2009\u03bcg/kg/h) and rocuronium (0.3\u20131.25\u2009mg/kg).\nAfter the spine was exposed, isoflurane was discontinued, and rocuronium was reversed with neostigmine (0.7\u2009mg/kg). During spine distraction, an appropriate plane of anesthesia was maintained with a propofol infusion (100\u201330,000\u2009\u03bcg/kg/min intravenously) supplemented with fentanyl (5\u201310\u2009\u03bcg/kg intravenously) and ketamine as-needed boluses (1\u20135\u2009mg/kg intravenously) in response to any movement.\nPrior to surgery, animals were positioned prone on a radiolucent midline chest support device on a fluoroscopy table, then covered and warmed with a Bair Hugger (3M, Maplewood, MN, USA) forced-air heating blanket with a portal for surgical access. Temperature was monitored via a rectal thermistor. After fluoroscopic identification of the appropriate spine level, a midline incision was made down to the spinous processes. Electrocautery was used for subperiosteal dissection to the tips of the transverse processes. Pedicle start points were identified using anatomic landmarks and confirmed using fluoroscopy. A burr was used to make a pilot hole, and a pedicle awl was used to create a tract down the pedicle into the vertebral body. A ball-tipped probe was used to palpate the tract and confirm that the position was acceptable. The tract was tapped and an appropriately sized stainless-steel poly-axial pedicle screw (K2M, Leesburg, VA, USA) was placed. Screws were placed bilaterally in sequential vertebrae between the T9 and L1 levels. A 5.5-mm stainless steel rod was placed in the head of the pedicle screw. Proximal endcaps were fully tightened and distal endcaps were loosely applied, permitting motion along the rod during the distraction maneuver.\nAfter placement of instrumentation, a laminotomy was created at least three levels caudal to the instrumented level; this separation distance minimizes artifacts associated with the laminotomy. DCS fiberoptic probes were placed through this laminotomy into the epidural space and advanced under fluoroscopic imaging at the level of distraction (sheep 1, 2), additionally at two levels cranial to the distraction site (Sheep 3\u201310), and one or two levels caudal to the site of distraction (Sheep 4, 9, and 10). Specifics of probe placement for each sheep are described subsequently.\nDCS flow was continuously monitored (described subsequently) throughout distraction, which was performed in intervals of 2\u2009mm by placing ratcheting distractors bilaterally between the pedicle screws. After each distraction step, screw endcaps were tightened to maintain distraction, and the animal was monitored for 2\u2009min. When measured, bilateral MEPs were acquired at the end of each 2-min interval. A vernier caliper was used to confirm the length of distraction by measuring the distance between the pedicle screws bilaterally. Distraction was terminated when either a 50% fall in blood flow was measured with DCS (that is, \u0394BF\u2009=\u2009\u221250%) or when the maximum range of the ratchetting distractor was reached. After completion of the monitoring protocol, the distraction was released to allow the spine to relax. The hardware was removed and the wound was closed; monitoring continued throughout this period. Post-operative pain was managed with buprenorphine 0.05\u20130.01\u2009mg/kg every 8\u2009h, and a fentanyl patch (2\u20133\u2009\u03bcg/kg/h) was sutured subdermally at the conclusion of surgery. This was supplemented with carprofen 2\u20134\u2009mg/kg subcutaneously, and morphine sulfate 0.1\u20130.2\u2009mg/kg every 6\u2009h as needed.\n\nMonitoring\nMEP monitoring was conducted using a Nihon Koden Neuropack MEB-9400 S1 (Nihon Kohden America, Irvine, CA, USA). Disposable subdermal needle electrodes were placed according to the International 10\u201320 system. The motor stimulus electrodes were placed a few centimeters behind the Cz plane at C3\u2032 to C4\u2032. The motor recording electrodes were placed in semi-membranous tissues or the gastrocnemius muscles in the lower extremities and in the flexor carpi ulnaris for the upper limbs. The paradigm of motor cortex transcranial stimulation used a train of five pulses with a duration of 0.05\u2009ms, an inter-stimulus interval of 2\u2009ms, and a voltage adjusted between 100 and 500\u2009V to produce a compound muscle action potential \u226550\u2009\u03bcV.\nThe optical probes used in this study consisted of a flexible sheath 0.9\u2009mm in diameter enclosing a pair of single-mode detector fibers and a source fiber (Fiberoptic Systems Inc, Simi CA) (\nFig. 1\n). The tip of each fiber was polished at a 45 degree angle to direct the light perpendicular to the axis of the probe. The detector fiber tips were positioned 2\u2009cm axially from the source fiber tip and provided redundancy at each probe location. Up to three of these probes were inserted through a single laminotomy.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic and photograph of the distal tip of the fiberoptic probe. Tissue is interrogated to a depth of roughly 1/3\u2009\u00b1\u20091/3 of the source-detector separation; therefore, the current configuration of the probe allows for measurement of blood flow throughout most of the spinal cord (cross-section \u223c1\u2009cm).\nDCS was monitored continuously throughout distraction and recovery. BFI values were derived from DCS data fit to a semi-infinite photon diffusion model using a field-programmable gate-array analysis device at 0.5\u20132\u2009Hz, depending on the integration time necessary to achieve an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio.\n36\nThe BFI was normalized to the pre-intervention baseline (after installation of surgical hardware), producing a change in the relative BFI (\u0394BF\u2009=\u2009[BFI/BFI\n0\n-1]\u2009\u00d7\u2009100) that was displayed in real time. After reaching \u0394BF\u2009=\u2009-50% or the maximum range of the ratchetting distractor, DCS was monitored continuously for 10\u2009min; if performed, MEP were measured every 2\u2009min. In post-processing, the difference in the nadir of blood flow at injured and uninjured locations was assessed with Wilcoxon's rank sum test.\n\nAssessment of neurological deficits\nWe assessed the functional deficit created by spinal distraction using a modified Tarlov scale 24\u2009h post-operatively.\n37\n,\n38\nFocusing on the hindlimb, this scale ranges from 0 (no voluntary movement) to 6 (normal movement):\nTarlov 0: No voluntary movement\nTarlov 1: Barely perceptible movement\nTarlov 2: Brisk movement, but no weight sport or coordination\nTarlov 3: Alternate stepping and movement\nTarlov 4: Weight support\nTarlov 5: Ambulation with mild deficit\nTarlov 6: Normal movement.\n\nHistology\nImmediately after the functional assessment, animals were euthanized, and the spinal cord was harvested for histopathological analysis. Sections of spinal cord (2\u2009cm) were excised at the site of distraction and at the caudal- and cranial-to-injury DCS monitoring sites. These sections were fixed in 10% formalin before being embedded in paraffin. Subsequently, six cross-sections, 5-\u03bcm thick, were recovered from each spinal cord section. To assess an acute axonal injury in the spinal cord, we used beta amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2-APP) immunohistochemistry. \u03b2-APP is a membrane protein synthesized in the cell body of neurons and transported to the synapses by fast anterograde axoplasm transport.\n39\nAcute axon injury impedes axonal transport, leading to local accumulation of \u03b2-APP and axonal spheroid formation at the proximal stump at the site of the injury.\n40\n\u03b2-APP immunostaining enables the detection of axonal injury within hours of the injury,\n41\nalthough \u03b2-APP expression alone does not differentiate axonal injury from mechanic force, hypoxia, or other causes.\n42\nFor \u03b2-APP detection, immunohistochemistry of \u03b2-APP (Millipore, Catalog MAB348, Clone: 22C11; Dilution 1:20000) was performed on 5-\u03bcm-thick paraffin sections in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) approved laboratory on a Leica Bond-III automated immunostainer using Fast Red chromogens from Bond Polymer Refine Detection kits (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA, DS9390) as red secondary stains to detect signals. Adjacent sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin were examined for comparison with the immunohistochemistry slides.\nThe \u03b2-APP immunohistochemistry slides were interpreted by a board-certified neuropathologist (C.C.), who was blinded to the site of distraction, changes in blood flow, and the animals' postoperative Tarlov scales. The extent of axonal injury was quantified under a light microscope as a \u03b2-APP score. The \u03b2-APP score was determined by manually counting the number of \u03b2-APP-positive axonal spheroids with diameter >10\u03bcm in a 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009high-powered field (HPF), in the region of the highest spheroid density (\nFig. 2\n). Spinal cord injury was considered none (0 spheroids/HPF), mild (1\u20139 spheroids/HPF), moderate (10\u201350 spheroids/HPF), and severe (> 50 spheroids/HPF, or the presence of cavitary lesion, hemorrhage, or confluent \u03b2-APP staining). For each animal, three to five sections of spinal cord at, above, or below the level of the site of injury were examined in a blind fashion. The resulting \u03b2-APP score was compared with the score for other experimental metrics.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nQuantitative scoring of spinal cord injury by beta amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2-APP) immunohistochemical staining.\n(A\u2013D)\n: low magnification (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009) image of complete spinal cord cross-section.

Additionally, we compared changes in blood flow at the distraction site to changes in blood flow in cranial and caudal sites. We also compared reductions in blood flow at the site of distraction to the occurrence of axonal injury by comparing \u03b2-APP scores from histological samples at, cranial to, and caudal to the distraction point. Finally, we compared time courses of changes in spinal cord blood flow at the site of injury with changes in MEP amplitudes."

    "Methods": "Experimental design\nAll experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals established by the Canadian Council on Animal Care and were approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee (approval certificate number: A18-0183). Twenty-eight adult (250\u2013300\u2009g) male Wistar rats were assigned into either a na\u00efve control (CON,\nn\n=\u200914) or T3-complete spinal cord transection group (SCI,\nn\n=\u200914). Fourteen weeks post-injury, all rats were assessed for short-term memory using a novel object recognition test (NORT,\nFig. 1\n). Following the NORT, the groups were subdivided equally (\nn\n=\u20097 each). Each subgroup was assigned for either\nin vitro\nphysiological assessments using pressure myography or for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by immunohistochemistry.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental timeline. The rats were divided into two experimental groups (\nn\n=\u200914 each): CON (uninjured) and SCI (complete transection at T3 spinal segment). At 14 weeks post-SCI (and age-matched controls), all rats underwent NORT. Following NORT, the groups were subdivided equally and assigned to: 1)\nin vitro\nphysiological assessments using pressure myography, and 2) MRI followed by immunohistochemistry. MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; NORT, novel object recognition test; SCI, spinal cord injury. Color image is available online.\n\nT3 Transection surgery and animal care\nSurgery and animal care were conducted as described previously.\n9\nRats were pre-treated with enrofloxacin (Baytril; 10\u2009mg/kg, s.c., Associated Veterinary Purchasing [AVP], Langley, British Columbia, Canada) for 3 days. The animals were fasted the night before surgery. On the day of surgery, anesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane (AErrane; AVP) in 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 1\u2009L/min and maintained at 2\u20133% during the surgery. Enrofloxacin (10\u2009mg/kg, s.c.), buprenorphine (Temgesic; 0.02\u2009mg/kg, s.c., University of McGill Animal Resources Centre), and lactated Ringer's solution (5\u2009mL, s.c.) were administered pre-operatively.\nA dorsal midline incision was made through the skin and superficial muscle layer, as well as a blunt dissection of deep muscles overlying T1-4 vertebrae. Deep muscles around T2-3 vertebrae were carefully dissected to expose the intervertebral gap. The dura at the gap was then opened, and the spinal cord was transected with microscissors. Complete transection was confirmed by two surgeons via visual separation of the rostral and caudal spinal cord stumps under the microscope. Absorption sponges and Gelfoam (Pharmacia & Upjohn Company, Pfizer, New York, USA) were used to achieve hemostasis. The muscle and skin of the surgical site were closed with 4\u20130 Vicryl and 4\u20130 Prolene sutures, respectively. Animals received warmed lactated Ringer's solution (5\u2009mL, s.c.) and were allowed to recover from anesthesia in a temperature-controlled environment (Animal Intensive Care Unit, HotSpot for Birds, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Enrofloxacin (10\u2009mg/kg, s.c., once per day) and buprenorphine (0.02\u2009mg/kg, s.c., twice per day) were administered for 3 days post-surgery.\nAnimals with SCI were housed in specialized cages, with rubber matting to facilitate movement, low-reaching water bottles, and food scattered on the cage bottom to encourage foraging. Animals were supported with an enriched diet, including meal replacement shake (Ensure, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA), fruit, spinach, HydroGel (Clear H\n2\nO, Westbrook, ME, USA), peanuts, and kibble (LabDiet, Rodent Diet 5001; PMI International, St. Louis, MO, USA). The bladder was manually emptied three times daily until spontaneous bladder function returned (\u223c10 days after injury). Health status was monitored and recorded daily for the first 2 weeks after surgery and on alternative days thereafter. All experiments and analyses were performed with the investigators completely blinded of the group assignments.\n\nNORT\nShort-term memory was evaluated using the NORT, a widely implemented test to assess retention memory and interest in exploring novel objects.\n10\nOne day prior to the testing session, animals were individually placed in an empty container for 1\u2009h to encourage habituation. One hour before the test, animals were exposed to two identical objects for 10\u2009min in the same container, and then one object was replaced with a novel object.\n11\u201314\nDuring the test, animals were allowed to explore the open field freely for 5\u2009min while being videotaped. Discrimination index (D-index) was calculated by dividing the difference between the exploration time devoted to novel (TN) and Object 1 (T1) divided by the total exploration time (DI\u2009=\u2009[TN \u2013 T1]/[TN + T1]*100).\n11\n\nCBF\nCBF maps were acquired using arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI as previously described.\n15\nBriefly, water molecules from inflowing blood were magnetically excited by a spin inversion. The overall magnetization of a downstream area of the brain was modified upon the arrival of these labeled molecules. The resultant signal describes the amount of arterial blood delivered to the imaging slice within the transit time of the experiment. On the day of imaging, rats were sedated with isoflurane and maintained on a ventilator (Harvard Apparatus Inspira ASV, USA) to maintain expired CO\n2\nat 35\u2009mm Hg. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C. Assessments were performed on a 7 Tesla MRI scanner (Bruker Biospec 70/30 USR, Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) using a quadrature volume transmit coil and 4-channel phased-array receivers.\nMultiple inversion recovery echo-planar imaging (EPI) scans were acquired to obtain calibration data (tissue T1, inversion efficiency, and proton density) for the ASL scan (recovery time\u2009=\u200910\u2009sec, echo time\u2009=\u200911.47\u2009msec, 22 inversion times between 30 and 8000\u2009msec spaced geometrically, field of view\u2009=\u200940\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, slice thickness\u2009=\u20092\u2009mm, 9 slices, single shot). Flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery EPI with a pre-saturation preparation\n16\nwas used to acquire the ASL data at five inversion times to allow correction for variable transit times using same geometry as the calibration scans. CBF maps were calculated by fitting the full perfusion model, including non-zero arterial transit time and bolus outflow.\n17\n\nPressure myography\nMCA function was assessed using pressure myography (Living Systems, St. Albans, VT, USA) as described previously.\n9\n,\n18\n,\n19\nA 5\u2009\u00d7\u20093-mm section of brain tissue containing the MCA was removed and placed in Ca\n2+\nfree physiological salt solution (PSS) at 4\u00b0C, with 1% bovine serum albumin. A branch-free M2 segment of MCA was dissected. The M2 segment of MCA is the branch-free segment of the MCA and is a widely accepted segment for the study of pressure-diameter relationships because the other branched segments cannot hold the perfusion pressure.\n20\u201322\nThe vessels were mounted on two glass micropipettes in the pressure myograph, and the diameter was measured using a digital CCD camera. MCAs were equilibrated at 80\u2009mm Hg for 45\u2009min in PSS containing (in millimoles) 141.9 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.12 KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.7 MgSO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO, 2.8 CaCl\n2\n, 10 HEPES, 5 dextrose, and 0.5 EDTA (pH\u2009=\u20097.4) solution. The baseline of the inner diameter of the MCA was measured, and only vessels that developed >20% spontaneous myogenic tone were used for the experiment. Passive distensibility was assessed in Ca\n2+-\nfree PSS containing 0.002\u2009M EGTA as intraluminal pressure was increased from 20 to 180\u2009mm Hg in 20\u2009mm Hg increments.\nEndothelial function was assessed by measuring the response to administration of carbachol in the bath as previously described.\n23\n,\n24\nThe MCA was first bathed in PSS and pressurized at 80\u2009mm Hg to generate a stable degree of spontaneous myogenic tone. The vasodilator response to increasing concentrations of carbachol (10\n\u221210\nto 10\n\u22125\nM) was then determined.\n25\nThe vessel was pre-incubated with a transient receptor potential cation channel 4 (TRPV 4) antagonist, HC067047 (10\n\u22126\nM), for 15\u2009min and the responses to carbachol (10\n\u221210\nto 10\n\u22125\nM) were recorded to investigate the mechanism involved.\n26\nFinally, the vessels were bathed in Ca\n2+\n-free PSS, and a passive pressure diameter curve was recorded. Myogenic tone was calculated using the following formula: % tone\u2009=\u2009(1\u2212[active lumen diameter/passive lumen diameter])\u2009\u00d7\u2009100.\n\nPerfusion and tissue collection\nAnimals were euthanized with isoflurane followed by intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate. The cerebral vasculature was fixed by transcardial perfusion with 100\u2013150\u2009mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; at 80\u201390\u2009mm Hg) and 400\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde at 120\u2013140\u2009mm Hg. The brain was harvested and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24\u2009h at 4\u00b0C and then transferred to 20% sucrose for 3 days. A 2- to 3-mm long segment of MCA was gently dissected from each hemisphere and used for histological analyses.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nThe M2 segments of MCA with a length of approximately 5\u2009mm and nearly uniform cylindrical shape were isolated from the animals, and were embedded in Cryomatrix\n\u00ae\n. We systematically randomly sampled a series of sections for stereology as previously described.\n21\nUsing a cryostat, 10-\u03bcm frozen transverse sections were cut and were placed on Superfrost Plus slides. The sections were then randomly selected, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until processed for immunohistochemistry.\nBriefly, MCA sections were washed in PBS and 0.1\u2009M PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST). They were blocked for 1\u2009h in 10% normal donkey serum in PBST. Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies to: collagen 1 (COL 1, 1:500, Abcam, ab34710), collagen 3 (COL 3, 1:300, Abcam, ab6310), TRPV 4 (1:300, generous gift from Dr. Stefan Heller's lab at Stanford), cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31, 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL, R&D systems, AF3628), or smooth muscle actin (SMA, 1:400, Abcam, ab5694) overnight at room temperature. On the second day, the sections were washed in PBST and incubated with species-specific secondary antibodies: Alexa\u2122-fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse (1:1000, Molecular Probes\n\u00a9\n, USA), Alexa\u2122-fluor 488 donkey anti-goat (1:1000, Molecular Probes\n\u00a9\n), or Cy3 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1\u2009h. Finally, the sections were washed with PBST, coverslipped with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc.), and images were captured using a confocal microscope with identical acquisition parameters.\n\nQuantification\nThe intensity of immunoreactivity of MCAs was assessed using Fiji Software (\nhttp://fiji.sc/Downloads#Fiji\n). Staining intensities were averaged from four sections per animal. For the analyses of COL 1, COL 3, and SMA, the region of interest (ROI) were confined between the adventitial border of the artery and the lumenal interface. TRPV 4 and CD31 were quantified in the endothelial layer (\nFig. 2\n). Further, a negative control consisting of staining with secondary antibody alone was performed for each antibody.\n9\n,\n27\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nCarbachol-induced relaxation is diminished in MCA after chronic SCI, which is closely associated with the loss of TRPV 4 and CD31 staining in the endothelium.\n(A,B)\nDose-response curve of MCA in control (CON,\nn\n=\u20096) and rats with SCI (SCI,\nn\n=\u20096) to carbachol.\n(C)\nMaximal dilation of MCAs to carbachol.\n(D)\nlogEC\n50\nto carbachol.\n(E)\nMCA distensibility curve under Ca\n2+\nfree solution.\n(F)\nRepresentative images of transverse sections of the MCA immunostained for CD31 and TRPV 4 illustrating the co-localization of the fluorescent signals in the endothelium (arrows).\n(G)\nComparison of the immunofluorescence staining of CD31 and TRPV 4 in the endothelial layer of MCAs in control and SCI rats.

Color image is available online.\n\nMorphometric assessment of the MCA\nThe arterial wall thickness and lumen diameter were measured using the transverse sections of the MCA immunostained with SMA (four sections per rat). Within each section, four sites were selected, representing a quadrant of the vessel, and a line was drawn across the media of the vascular wall perpendicular to the tangent line, and the length of this line was measured. The average of the four measurements was used to denote wall thickness for each section. Lumen diameter was measured by taking the average of the widest and the narrowest part of the lumen.\n\nTyrosine hydroxylase (TH) staining of the MCA whole mounts\nA small segment (3\u20134\u2009\u03bcm) from the middle third of the MCA was stained for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, 1:1000, anti-rabbit, Millipore, AB152) to compare the degree of sympathetic innervation. The density of TH-positive (TH\n+\n) nerve fibers was measured using Fiji Software (using ImageJ,\nhttp://fiji.sc/Downloads#Fiji\n). A grid was generated over the entire image (44 um\n2\n/grid sector). A 5\u2009\u00d7\u20095 ROI was randomly selected, and the intersections between the grid and the stained fibers were counted. The number of crossings of fibers with the grid was used to determine the density of TH\n+\nfibers that innervate the middle third of the MCA as previously described.\n28\n\nStatistical analysis\nMean values\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error are presented. The significance of differences between mean values in the control and spinal cord transected groups was determined using a Student's\nt\ntest or a non-parametric alternative when the data were not normally distributed. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the concentration-response curves for carbachol, which were further analyzed by non-linear regression (Hill equation) to calculate EC50 and Emax values. All the statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). A\np\n-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Participants and data source\nThe TBIMS NDB funded by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) served as the data source for this study. The TBIMS NDB includes longitudinal data on individuals with TBI receiving inpatient rehabilitation at 20 TBIMS centers dating from 1987 to the current year.\n17\nThe TBIMS NDB defines TBI as \u201cdamage to brain tissue caused by an external mechanical force as evidenced by medically documented loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) due to brain trauma or by objective neurological findings that can be reasonably attributed to TBI on physical examination or mental status examination.\u201d\n18\n,\n19\nAdditional eligibility criteria include (1) a diagnosis of moderate to severe TBI as determined by one of the following: PTA >24\u2009h, trauma-related intracranial neuroimaging abnormalities, loss of consciousness >30\u2009min, a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score in the emergency department of <13 (unless caused by intubation, sedation, or intoxication); (2) being \u226516 years of age at the time of injury; (3) being admitted to a model system center's acute care hospital within 72\u2009h of injury; (4) both acute hospital care and comprehensive rehabilitation received in a designated brain injury program within a model system center; and 5) providing informed consent to participate or having a proxy consent.\n18\n,\n19\nHuman subject research approval is in place from each center's respective institutional review boards. Standard operating procedures dictate the methods for enrollment, follow-up, data collection, and data management.\n17\n,\n19\nMedical and administrative records, standardized patient assessments, and patient/family interview provide the source for demographic, pre-morbid injury, and treatment-related data. Follow-up data collection occurs by telephone or in person using structured interviews. Data collectors undergo formalized training and intermittent inter-reliability testing. Test\u2013retest reliability of the TBIMS NDB follow-up interview is good to excellent.\n20\n\nProcedures\nPatients were recruited during their inpatient rehabilitation hospitalization for TBI. Data were collected from a combination of medical record documentation and questionnaires during the inpatient rehabilitation stay, with follow-up telephone interviews conducted at 1, 2, and 5 years post-injury, and every subsequent 5-year interval. For this study, data from the last successful follow-up before death were utilized. Deaths were identified during routine telephone follow-up and, adhering to the TBIMS protocol for loss to follow-up, obituary and Social Security searches were conducted. When a participant was identified as having died, an official death certificate was requested from the state or the family.\n\nCause of death coding\nFrom 1989 to present, using the causes of death listed on the actual death certificates, codes are assigned according to the National Data and Statistical Center (NDSC) procedures using ICD-9 codes. UP cases were identified by the primary cause of death reported on the death certificate within the ICD-9 code range of E850\u2013E869 (UP by drugs, medicinal substances, biologicals; and other solid and liquid substances, gases, and vapors) as defined in\nTable 1\n.\nTable 1.\nICD-9 Coding for Unintentional Poisoning (\nn\n=\u200978)\nICD-9 code\nNumber of deaths\nUnintentional poisoning specific causes of death by ICD-9 codes\n850.0\n14\nOpiates and related narcotics \u2013 Heroin\n850.1\n6\nOpiates and related narcotics \u2013 Methadone\n850.2\n14\nOpiates and related narcotics \u2013 Other (codeine, meperidine, morphine)\n850.4\n1\nAromatic analgesics\n850.6\n1\nUnspecified analgesics and antipyretics\n850.8\n1\nOther specified analgesics and antipyretics\n852.8\n1\nOther specified sedatives and hypnotics\n854.2\n4\nPsychostimulants\n854.3\n3\nCentral nervous system stimulants\n855.2\n2\nLocal anesthetics\n858.2\n1\nAgents affecting blood constituents\n858.6\n1\nAgents acting on muscles and respiratory system\n858.8\n2\nOther specified drugs\n858.9\n19\nUnspecified drugs\n860.0\n2\nAlcohol\n860.1\n1\nOther/unspecified ethyl alcohol and its products\n860.9\n3\nUnspecified alcohol\n869.1\n1\nSulfur dioxide\n869.8\n1\nOther specified gases and vapors\nOpen in a separate window\nICD, International Classification of Diseases.\n\nMeasures\nPredictor variables selected for analysis were categorized into four domains: (1) socio-demographics, (2) injury severity, (3) alcohol and illicit drug use, and (4) function, community participation, mood, and life satisfaction. These variables were assessed at time of injury, inpatient rehabilitation discharge, and/or last available post-injury follow-up.

Drinking categories were derived from the number of drinks per week using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System User Guide.\n21\nDrinking categories were defined as \u201cAbstaining,\u201d \u201cLight\u201d (\u2264 3 drinks per week), \u201cMedium\u201d (3\u20137 drinks per week, women; 3\u201314 drinks per week, men), \u201cHeavy\u201d (>7 drinks per week, women; >14 drinks per week, men), or \u201cbinge drinking\u201d (4 or more drinks for women or 5 or more drinks for men on one occasion). Risk assessments were based on the United States Department of Health and Human Services Dietary Guidelines.\n22\nAlcohol/drug problem was defined as any illicit drug use (past year) or heavy alcohol consumption or binge drinking (past month).\n19\nFunction, community participation, mood, and life satisfaction\nFunctional measures were contained within the Functional Independence Measure\u2122 (FIM) and Disability Rating Scale (DRS), at rehabilitation discharge and last follow-up, as well as the Supervision Rating Scale (SRS) at last follow-up. The FIM measures functional independence\n23\nusing 18 items scored from 1 (needing total assistance) to 7 (complete independence), with higher scores indicating greater functional independence. FIM has two subscales: the 13-item Motor subscale (scores range from 13 to 91) and the 5-item Cognitive Scale (scores range from 5 to 35). The eight-item DRS assesses cognitive ability to manage activities of daily living, need for assistance or supervision, and employability.\n24\nDRS scores range from 0 (no disability) to 29 (extreme vegetative state). The SRS is a 13-point ordinal scale that describes the level of supervision received by the individual with TBI.\n25\nSRS ratings were trichotomized to 1\u20132 (independent), 3\u20137 (needing overnight or part-time supervision), and 8\u201313 (needing full-time direct or indirect supervision).\nCommunity participation was represented by transportation access, the Glasgow Outcome Scale \u2013 Extended (GOS-E), and the Participation Assessment with Recombined Tools (PART-O) scores from the last follow-up. The GOS-E was used as a seven-point scale with the ability to live, work, travel, and socialize independently measured on a scale of 2 (vegetative state) through 8 (upper-good recovery).\n26\u201329\nThe Participation Assessment with Recombined Tools-Objective (PART) is a 17-item measure of participation with three domains: Productivity, Being Out and About, and Social Relations, each ranging from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicative of greater community participation.\n30\nLife satisfaction, depression, and anxiety at last follow-up were assessed through self-report using the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7). The SWLS\n31\nis a five-item global measure of life satisfaction\n31\nrated on a seven-point Likert scale; total scores range between 5 and 35, with higher scores indicative of greater life satisfaction. The PHQ-9\n32\nuses a three-point Likert scale to rate the frequency of specified problems of depression during the past 2 weeks. Total scores range between 0 and 27, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms.\n32\n,\n33\nThe GAD-7\n34\nmeasures the frequency of seven symptoms from the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\n4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. Total scores range between 0 and 21, with higher scores indicating more anxiety symptoms.\n\nStatistical analyses\nAll analyses were conducted using SAS v.9.4\n35\n; results were considered significant if\np\n<\u20090.05, unless otherwise stated. Select participant characteristics were summarized by group using frequency counts and percentages for nominal characteristics. Because most continuous characteristics exhibited a fair degree of skewness, medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were chosen to describe the center and spread of these variables, respectively. The characteristics were compared between UP and OC groups using non-parametric \u03c7\n2\ntests (categorical characteristics) and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (continuous characteristics).\nOur preliminary analyses revealed a substantial difference in age at injury between UP and OC death groups (median age 33.5 vs. 62.0 years, respectively); therefore, all subsequent analyses controlled for this variable. Specifically, we estimated the age-adjusted relationship between each predictor variable and outcome (UP vs. OC death) using multivariable logistical regression methods by fitting separate models for each predictor variable solely adjusted for age at injury (as a continuous variable). These relationships were quantified with age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of UP versus OC death from these models along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) expressing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. For categorical predictors with more than two levels, we conducted post-hoc analyses to estimate the pairwise ORs among the varying levels of the predictor, in order to further clarify the relationship between these predictors and UP versus OC death. As is standard practice, we did not interpret pairwise post-hoc tests as significant unless the global test for the predictor variable was significant (\np\n<\u20090.05). Finally, we utilized Bonferroni corrections to adjust these pairwise post-hoc tests for multiple comparisons."

    "Methods": "Study population\nThis study was approved by the institutional review board of the home institution, and written informed consent was obtained from the participants or their legally authorized representatives. Subjects were included based on age between 18 and 64 years and a history of non-penetrating TBI of at least moderate severity, as defined by at least one of the following: 1) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <13 in the emergency department (not attributed to sedation, paralysis, or intoxication); 2) documented loss of consciousness for \u226512\u2009h; or (3) duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) \u226524\u2009h. Participants were excluded for: 1) history of previous TBI, central nervous system disease, seizure disorder, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder; 2) history of abuse of alcohol or stimulants likely to have resulted in neurological sequelae; 3) pregnancy; 4) inability to complete MRI scanning because of ferromagnetic implants, claustrophobia, or restlessness; 5) non-fluency in English; and 6) level of disability too great to allow for completion of testing and scanning 3 months post-TBI.\nTo maximize the likelihood of traumatic axonal injury in the absence of large focal brain lesions, participants were also excluded if the total estimated volume of focal intraparenchymal lesions was >5\u2009cm\n3\nfor subcortical lesions and 50\u2009cm\n3\nfor cortical lesions. In total, 42 TBI subjects met the inclusion criteria for this study. In addition, 35 healthy volunteers matched to TBI subjects for age, sex, and years of education were recruited. Exclusion criteria for controls were the same as above, with an additional exclusion for any history of TBI resulting in loss or alteration of consciousness.\n\nClinical and neuropsychological measures\nClinical measures were abstracted from the medical record or measured prospectively during hospitalization. Duration of PTA was used as an index of TBI severity, defined as the number of days between the TBI and the date of the first of two scores \u226525 on the Orientation Log\n34\nadministered \u226472\u2009h apart. For patients who were discharged from rehabilitation care while still in PTA, their PTA duration was estimated conservatively at [days between TBI and rehabilitation discharge]\u2009+\u20091. Neuropsychological tests of processing speed, executive function, and verbal learning, domains frequently impaired in TBI, were performed in all control subjects, all TBI subjects 3 months after injury, as well as in a subset of TBI subjects at 6 and 12 months after injury. Cognitive performance was assessed across three domains, including mental processing speed as indexed by the Processing Speed Index (PSI) from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV, verbal learning (VL) as indexed by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and executive functioning (EF) as indexed by a composite measure consisting of an average across T-scores of the following tests: Trails-Making-Test B, color-word-interference test, backward digit span, and letter-number sequencing.\n35\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging acquisition and post-processing\nBrain MRI examinations were performed on a 3 Tesla MRI scanner (Siemens Trio; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), which included a high-resolution T\n1\nmagnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence acquired at 1-mm isotropic resolution using an echo time (TE) of 3.08\u2009ms, repetition time (TR) of 1620\u2009ms, inversion time of 950\u2009ms, flip angle of 15 degrees, and matrix of 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009192. ASL imaging was performed using a pseudo-continuous labeling technique 9\u2009cm below the center of the imaging volume with labeling duration and post-labeling delay of 1.5\u2009sec. Images were acquired using a two-dimensional echo planar sequence with the following parameters: TR 4\u2009sec, TE 18\u2009ms, field of view 220\u2009mm, matrix 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964, and voxel size 3.4\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4\u2009\u00d7\u20097.2\u2009mm\n3\n. Eighteen slices with a distance factor of 20% were acquired from inferior to superior direction in a sequential order. Forty-five label-control pairs were acquired for signal averaging.\nStructural images from a subset of 40 study participants (20 controls and 20 TBI, with same sex balance 6 female and 14 male) were used to create a population-specific anatomical template using the longitudinal processing pipeline of the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs).\n36\nSubsequently, all subjects' structural scans underwent brain extraction, six-tissue segmentation, and non-linear transformation to the group template using the ANTs structural processing pipeline.\n37\nMacrostructural encephalomalacic lesions segmented from the structural images by a trained observer were used in masking the cost function of the registration procedure, which improves accuracy in coregistration of brains with focal lesions.\n38\nVoxel-wise maps of the Jacobian determinant (log-transformed) were additionally calculated from the diffeomorphic registration fields. The Jacobian determinant value reflects the degree of local tissue expansion or contraction required to match the template, frequently used to assess brain atrophy.\n39\nAnatomical labeling of each subject's structural image and the template brain was performed using the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville labeling protocol.\n40\nASL data were processed using SPM12, the ASL toolbox,\n41\nand custom MATLAB scripts (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). The raw echo planar imaging label-control time series was first motion corrected and then a CBF time series was obtained using pair-wise control-label subtraction, dividing by the corresponding control image and application of the recommended model\n42\nfor CBF estimation. Subsequently, a denoised mean CBF map was obtained using a two-step data-cleaning strategy: 1) a structural correlation based outlier rejection method, which explicitly detects and discards outlier volumes iteratively, followed by 2) a voxel-wise Bayesian estimation approach.\n43\n,\n44\nFinal CBF maps were visually reviewed by a neuroradiologist and an experienced ASL data processing scientist to ensure image quality.\nAll CBF maps were then transformed to structural space using a functional space to structural space affine transformation computed by ANTs, as well as to group template space by applying a single transform to the initial CBF map consisting of a composition of the functional to structural affine transformation and the non-linear transform computed in the structural processing step. Standard and structural space CBF data were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 6\u2009mm full width at half maximum, and standard space CBF maps were downsampled to 2-mm isotropic resolution to reduce the number of comparisons in subsequent whole-brain, voxel-wise testing.\n\nStatistical analysis\nCBF and Jacobian determinant maps were compared between the TBI and control groups in a whole-brain, voxel-wise fashion using a non-parametric permutation testing tool\n45\nwith the threshold-free cluster enhancement method of multiple comparison correction.\n46\nAdditionally, to directly account for atrophy in the CBF comparison, the group-wise testing procedure was repeated using the Jacobian determinate maps as a voxel-wise covariate. CBF reductions among the TBI group were qualitatively compared with the distribution of focal encephalomalacic lesions, displayed as an overlap map of manually segmented lesions in the template space.\nSubsequent analysis within the TBI group was performed using a regions-of-interest (ROI) approach. Mean CBF and Jacobian determinant values were extracted from a \u201cmeta-ROI\u201d comprised of all anatomical regions which contained voxels of significantly reduced CBF in the TBI group relative to the control group. The mean Jacobian determinant was also extracted from an ROI comprised of the lateral and third ventricles as a marker of diffuse atrophy. These measures were then compared with injury severity and cognitive measures among the TBI group in a cross-sectional fashion using linear correlation analysis while controlling for age and level of education. Further, the relationship of imaging measures at the initial 3-month time point was compared to cognitive recovery over the ensuing 9 months by computing the correlation between 3-month CBF and the slope change of the cognitive measures over time while controlling for the effects of age, education level, and the initial test score."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nSprague\u2013Dawley rats weighing from 300 to 420\u2009g, ordered from Envigo (Houston, TX, USA) were used. Prior to surgery, rats were acclimated to handling and the behavioral apparatus (described subsequently). Rats were pair-housed in a 12\u2009h light\u2013dark cycle setting and allowed food and water\nad libitum\n. All experiments were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) standards for care and use of laboratory animals and guidelines set forth by Texas A&M University with full approval from its Animal Care and Use Committee. Every effort was made to minimize the use and suffering of laboratory animals in the study.\n\nSurgery\nAll animals received a contusion injury at T12 vertebrae. A 5% isoflurane/oxygen mixture was used to anesthetize animals for surgery. This anesthetic was reduced to 2\u20133% during surgery. A 3\u2009cm longitudinal incision was made through the skin along the vertebral column. After removing tissue to expose the spinous processes around the surgical site, a laminectomy was performed at T11\u2013T12, exposing the spinal cord. Securing the rat to a MASCIS device\n28\nwith clamps at opposite ends of the injury site, a 10\u2009g weight was dropped onto the exposed spinal cord from a height of 12.5\u2009mm. For experiments involving the application of rostral lidocaine, an 18.5\u2009cm catheter was threaded 4\u2009cm rostral to the injury site, placing the tip at T2. The surgical site was closed using Michel clips. Animals were injected intraperitoneally with 3\u2009mL of saline and 100,000 units/kg of penicillin to compensate for fluid loss and to prevent infection, respectively, before being taken to recovery housing overnight.\n\nNociceptive stimulation\nOne day after injury, animals were secured in an opaque Plexiglas tube. Nociceptive fibers were engaged using intermittent electrical stimulation (1.5\u2009mA, 100\u2009ms). This type of stimulation engages pain (C, A\u2202) fibers without inducing tissue damage. In addition, both the onset and offset can be controlled, which allowed us to compare the effectiveness of lidocaine applied before versus after the period of nociceptive stimulation. A constant current AC shock source (660\u2009V AC) was used to generate electrical stimulation, which was applied to the tail through a modified fuse clip coated with electrode paste (Harvard Apparatus). Pulses of electrical stimulation (100\u2009ms) were applied on a variable schedule (0.2\u20133.8\u2009sec interstimulus interval). In Experiment 1, stimulation was applied for 30\u2009min, as described in Grau and coworkers.\n8\nBecause subsequent studies revealed that a briefer period (6\u2009min) of nociceptive stimulation can induce hemorrhage and impair recovery,\n8\n,\n29\u201331\nthis shock regimen was used in Experiments 2\u20134. Animals in the no-shock group were treated the same except that shock was omitted.\n\nSensory testing\nMechanical reactivity was assessed using von Frey filaments, which were applied to the mid-plantar surface of each hindpaw in a serial progression until a flexion response was elicited, as descried in a previous study.\n19\nFilament thickness/force data was transformed using the formula provided by the manufacturer, intensity\u2009=\u2009log10 (10,000\ng\n).\n32\nThis allowed for a linear scale that more readily accommodates parametric analyses.\nReactivity to a noxious thermal stimulus was evaluated using a tail flick analgesia meter (IITC #33, IITC Life Science, Inc., Woodland Hills, CA, USA), as described by Hook and coworkers (2009). Briefly, the animal's tail was placed in a groove formed under a halogen lamp. Tail-flick latency was assessed three times at 2\u2009min intervals prior to and after drug treatment. If a response did not occur within 8\u2009sec, the thermal stimulus was terminated to prevent tissue damage.\n\nDrug treatment\nLidocaine was administered at a concentration of 10%. Thirty microliters was applied rostral to injury through the catheter at a rate of 5\u2009\u03bcL per min prior to nociceptive stimulation. Treatment effectiveness was verified by monitoring vocalization to nociceptive stimulation. In the absence of lidocaine treatment, all rats exhibited a brain-dependent response (audible vocalizations) to shock. In every case, lidocaine applied prior to shock treatment blocked this behavioral response. In Experiment 1, the infusion was continued at a slow rate (0.5\u2009\u03bcL/min) for the 30\u2009min of electrical stimulation. For experiments using a briefer (6\u2009min) period of stimulation, pilot data revealed that the initial 30\u2009\u03bcL infusion remained effective and, for this reason, no additional lidocaine was given. Lidocaine was applied at the site of injury using a 25.4 mm, 25 gauge needle that was inserted caudal to the L5 vertebrae. Next, 30\u2009\u03bcL of lidocaine solution (10%) was slowly infused into the space between L5 and L6.\nIn a prior study, we examined fluid spread after our microinjection procedures by applying a comparable volume of India ink and measuring the extent of staining.\n33\nWe found that the spread was limited to \u223c1\u2009cm along the rostral-caudal axis. The rostral infusion procedure used here yielded a similar pattern of staining, with negligible diffusion along the catheter path. Likewise, when India ink was applied by means of a lumbar puncture, staining was confined to the area of injury. The two treatment procedures also had distinct effects on reactivity to sensory stimulation applied to the tail or hindpaws. Lidocaine applied through a lumbar puncture reduced reactivity to von Frey stimuli applied to the hindpaws (133.2 [% change from baseline]) whereas rostral lidocaine had no effect (109.9%) (\nF\n=\u20094.889,\np\n=\u20090.0580). Likewise, epidural lidocaine inhibited tail withdrawal from radiant heat (123.9% [% change from baseline]) whereas rostral lidocaine (79.8 %) had no effect (\nF\n=\u20099.996,\np\n<\u20090.05).\n\nAssessment of recovery\nLocomotor performance was recorded while animals freely moved about an open field. A locomotor behavior score was obtained using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale\n18\nduring a 4-min observation period by two investigators. Investigators were tested for inter-rater reliabilty (all\nr\ns\u2009>\u20090.94) and blinded to experimental treatment. BBB scores were converted as described previously.\n34\nThis conversion improves the metric properties of the behavioral scale and helps assure that the data are amendable to parametric analyses.\n34\nLocomotor behavior was assessed once per day for the 1st week, every other day from the 2nd week, and every 3rd day from the 3rd week. At the end of the recovery period, coordination was assessed using the Beamwalk\n35\nand the Ladder beam tests.\n36\n\nTissue collection\nRats were euthanized using a lethal dose of pentobarbital (100\u2009mg/kg). One cm portion of the rat's spinal cord surrounding the injury site was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein was extracted using the QIAzol lysis reagent protocol. Tissue was processed as per the manufacturer's instructions. A Bradford assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA) was performed to evaluate the concentrations of protein in each sample. Given these concentrations, proteins were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer.\n\nSpectrophotometry\nFollowing protein extraction, a 1.5\u2009\u03bcL portion of protein from each subject's sample was examined through spectrophotometric analysis (Nanodrop, Thermo Scientific). This examined absorbance of light at wavelengths between 200 and 800\u2009nm. Absorbance of light at 420\u2009nm was used as a measure of hemoglobin content for each sample.\n37\n\nImmunoblotting\nFollowing dilution of samples, gel electrophoresis was conducted using sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE) on samples loaded into 12% pre-cast tris-HCL gels (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Before samples diluted in standard Laemmli buffer solution were loaded, they were heated in 96\u00b0C water for 10\u2009min and centrifuged for a quick spin cycle (3\u20135\u2009sec). After heating, proteins were inserted into Criterion cells. Ten \u03bcL of each sample were loaded into each of the gel wells of for each sample. In addition, 5\u2009\u03bcL of biotinylated ladder (BioRad) was added to the well. Electrophoresis was conducted at 180\u2009V for 1\u2009h.\nProteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF) (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as instructed by the manufacturer. Following assembly of the gel-cassette complex and its insertion into the transfer tank, the transfer unit was turned on and proteins were transferred for 1\u2009h at 100\u2009V.\nAfter transfer was conducted, blots were blocked for 1\u2009h in 5% blotting grade milk (BioRad, Hercules, CA) diluted in 1% Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBST). Once the blocking phase was complete, blots were incubated overnight in primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight on an orbital shaker. The antibodies used were for hemoglobin \u03b1 chain proteins (1:1000; Abcam [Cambridge, MA] ab92492, RRID: AB10561594), Il1\u00df (1:1000; Novus Biologicals [Centennial, CO] NB600-633, RRID: AB10001060), Il18 (1:1000; Invitrogen [Carlsbad, CA] PA5-79482, RRID: AB2746598), and Caspace 3 (1:2000; Novus Biologicals [Centinnial, CO] NB100-56113, RRID: AB837848).\nThe next day, membranes were washed three times using TBST for 10\u2009min each at room temperature. Then, membranes were treated with their respective horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO) ab258649, RRID: AB228341). Following secondary antibody treatment, membranes were washed again three times using TBST for 10\u2009min each at room temperature followed by a rinse with TBS.\nMembranes were then developed using an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) substrate kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 1\u2009min. Following development, membranes were imaged using Fluorchem HD2 (ProteinSimple, Santa Clara, CA).\n\nExperimental designs\nTo assess whether rostral lidocaine blocks the effect of nociceptive stimulation on long-term recovery, rats received lower thoracic contusion injury. The next day, baseline locomotor performance was evaluated using the BBB scale. Animals were then randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups (vehicle shocked, vehicle unshocked, lidocaine shocked, lidocaine unshocked). Animals received 10% lidocaine or vehicle through the intrathecal catheter at a rate of 5\u2009\u03bcL/min. They were then moved to an opaque Plexiglas tube and restrained with their tails fixed with an electrode. Animals in shocked groups received 30\u2009min of intermittent, uncontrollable electrical stimulation (shocked). Animals in the unshocked groups were treated the same except that shock was withheld. During this period, animals had a maintenance dose of their respective infusion (vehicle or lidocaine) at a rate of 0.5\u2009\u03bcL/min. Following nociceptive stimulation, or an equivalent period of restraint, locomotor performance and weight were monitored over the next 21 days. At the end of the recovery period, additional testing was conducted using the Beamwalk and Ladder beam tests. The complete experiment involved a 2 (lidocaine or vehicle)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (shock or no shock) design with 10 animals per condition (\nFig. 1A\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRostral lidocaine attenuates the adverse effect that nociceptive stimulation (shock) has on long-term recovery.

Error bars represent standard error of the mean (\nn\n=\u200910).\nThe impact of rostral lidocaine on acute hemorrhage was assessed 1 day after animals received a contusion injury. After locomotor performance was assessed, animals received 30\u2009\u03bcL of 10% lidocaine or vehicle infused intrathecally. They were then placed in the restraining tubes and given 6\u2009min of electrical stimulation (shocked) or nothing (unshocked). Animals were euthanized 3\u2009h later, and 1\u2009cm of spinal cord tissue enveloping the site of contusion injury was collected. Tissue was processed for protein analysis as described. Spectral analysis was performed targeting a wavelength of light associated with hemoglobin (420\u2009nm) and Western blotting was performed targeting \u03b1-hemoglobin. In addition, we assessed the expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u00df and IL-18. The experiment involved a 2 (shocked or unshocked)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (lidocaine or vehicle) factorial with 10 animals per condition (\nFig. 2A\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nRostral lidocaine attenuates nociception-induced hemorrhage and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Error bars represent standard error of the mean (\nn\n=\u200910).\nA similar procedure was used to assess the effect of lidocaine administered after nociceptive stimulation. A day after a contusion injury, half the animals received 30\u2009\u03bcL of 10% lidocaine, or the vehicle, infused through the implanted catheter at a rate of 5\u2009\u03bcL/min. All animals were then placed in the restraining tubes and given nociceptive stimulation for 6\u2009min. Immediately after, animals that had not received an infusion were given 30\u2009\u03bcL of 10% lidocaine, or the vehicle, infused at a rate of 5\u2009\u03bcL/min. Three hours after nociceptive stimulation, animals were euthanized, and 1\u2009cm of spinal cord tissue enveloping the site of contusion injury was collected. Tissue was processed for hemoglobin content as described. The experiment involved a 2 (lidocaine or vehicle)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (before or after) factorial design with 8 animals per condition (\nFig. 3A\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nRostral lidocaine prior to, but not after, nociceptive stimulation attenuates hemorrhage.

One day after a contusion injury, half the animals received 30\u2009\u03bcL of 10% lidocaine, or the vehicle, given by means of a lumbar puncture. All animals were then placed in the restraining tubes and nociceptive stimulation was applied for 6\u2009min. Immediately after, animals that had not received an infusion were given 30\u2009\u03bcL of 10% lidocaine, or the vehicle, by means of a lumbar puncture.

    "Methods": "This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for the University of Pittsburgh. The present report is a prospective observational cohort study that includesn=\u2009157 adults with severe TBI, with injury dates from May 2004 to March 2011, with available E2 and TNF\u03b1 data as summarized inFigure 1. Eligible participants were between 16 and 70 years old, had an initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less, and had intracranial pathology present on a computed tomography (CT) scan. Patients with TBI were excluded if they had a history of cancer or untreated thyroid disease.\n\nNext-of-kin were approached for consent as patients were unable to self-consent. Patients with severe TBI received care consistent with the TBI Guidelines for the Management of Severe Head Injury,8which included placement of an extraventricular device for intracranial pressure monitoring, central venous and arterial catheter placement, and neurosurgical intervention for the decompression of mass lesions.\n\nSerum sample processing\nEligible and consented participants underwent blood sample collection daily for the first five days after injury. Blood sample collections were performed at 7:00\nam\non most mornings, unless there was a direct conflict with clinical care. In instances where it was not possible to collect a morning blood sample, a sample was gathered at 7:00\npm\n. For some participants, it was not possible to obtain a blood sample each day. After serum collection, samples were centrifuged, aliquoted, and stored at -80\u00b0C until assay completion.\nSerum samples were assayed for E2 using radioimmunoassay with Coat-A-Count\n\u00ae\nIn-vitro Diagnostic Test Kit (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. Los Angeles, CA). The E2 was measured using a\n125\nI radioimmunoassay using 100\u2009\u03bcL sample aliquots. Serum sample measurements for TNF\u03b1 were completed using a Luminex\nTM\nbead array assay (Millipore, Billerica, MA; catalog number HSCYTO-60SK). The minimum detectable limit for TNF\u03b1 was 0.05\u2009pg/mL. The TNF\u03b1 levels were scaled utilizing concentration standards and quality controls before the analysis because of observed variability across plates. The interassay and intraassay coefficients of variation were <10% for both the hormone and inflammatory assays.\n\nE2 and TNF\u03b1 classification: acute response\nBoth E2 and TNF\u03b1 were grouped into two epochs: time 1 (T1) and time 2 (T2); T1 consisted of data averaged over the first 72\u2009h after injury, and T2 consisted of data averaged over the second 72\u2009h after injury. Because individuals had missing values at various time points in the first week because of clinical care requirements, it was not possible to conduct analyses using daily levels.\n\nAromatase genetics: rs2470152\nDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from participants' whole-blood samples before transfusion. Blood samples were centrifuged to retrieve the buffy coat. DNA was extracted using a salting out procedure.\n42\nThe single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2470152 was genotyped as part of a larger genomic analysis of the aromatase gene (CYP19A1) that included four functional SNPs and 18 tagging SNPs. A primary article examining the effects of aromatase genetics, and the impact of rs2470152 genotype on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) E2 levels and TBI outcomes was published previously.\n43\n\nClinical and demographic variables\nClinical and demographic variables collected in this study included: age, sex, race, best 24-h GCS score, Injury Severity Score (ISS), non-head ISS, mechanism of injury, and injury type based on review of available CT scans obtained during acute care. The GCS is a functional measure of TBI injury severity, made up of three components: motor responsiveness, verbal performance, and eye opening.\n44\nScores range from 3 to 15, with lower scores corresponding to more severe injuries; however, for the present study, only individuals with an initial GCS score between 3 and 8 were included. The best GCS score in the first 24\u2009h was utilized for analysis purposes, because initial GCS values can often be confounded by paralytics and sedatives at initial hospital presentation with severe TBI.\nThe ISS is an anatomical trauma scoring scale that is a function of the three most severely injured body systems from the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS).\n45\nAlso, a non-head ISS was recalculated after removing the head-neck body region. Presence of abdominal, extremity, and thoracic (or chest) injuries was derived from AIS region scores \u22651 for the respective regions. Maximum head and neck AIS was included as the highest severity AIS score for a participant's coded head-neck injuries. Presence of splenic injury was derived using\nInternational Classification of Diseases\ninjury codes version 9 (ICD-9) code \u201c865.\u201d The CT injury types included subdural hematoma (SDH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), epidural hematoma (EDH), diffuse axonal injury (DAI), contusion, or other.\n\nPrimary outcome: death\nThe primary outcome for this study was time until death. When applicable, these data were extracted from the Social Security Death Index. Death dates were subtracted from the date of the incident TBI to calculate a time until death in days. The data were right censored at 6 months post-injury.\n\nSecondary outcome: non-neurological organ dysfunction\nCardiovascular (CV), hematological, renal, hepatic, and respiratory dysfunction, common NNOD components, were assessed as a secondary outcome and as possible mediators between the relationships of E2 and TNF\u03b1 with 6-month death, respectively. Dysfunction in each system was categorized beginning at least 72\u2009h post-injury, after T1. Common definitions using a modified version of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)\n46\nwere evaluated using laboratory and physiological monitoring values that were available readily in clinical charts for individuals with available data for two or more days. The NNOD system definitions adopted for this analysis and associated literature sources are provided in\nTable 1\n.\nTable 1.\nDefinitions of Non-Neurologic Organ Dysfunction\nOrgan system\nDysfunction criteria\nRenal\nCreatinine levels\n>\n1.2\u2009mg/dL\nHematologic\nPlatelets\n<\n150 10\n3\n/mm\n3\nRespiratory\nRatio of PaO\n2\n/FiO\n2\n<400\nHepatic\nTotal bilirubin levels \u22651.2\u2009mg/dL\nCardiovascular\nMean arterial pressure <70\u2009mm Hg\nOR\nAdministration of vasopressors/inotropes, evidenced by physician note or pharmacy order independent of surgery and not in conjunction with anesthetic\nOpen in a separate window\nTo qualify as meeting threshold for \u201cdysfunction\u201d for any system, biomarker thresholds must have been met for at least two consecutive days of clinically available data (beginning on day 3 through day 15).\nDefinitions of dysfunction are modified from existing Sequential Organ Failure Assessment criteria.\n46\n\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic and clinical patient characteristics at the time of TBI were examined by E2 and TNF\u03b1 level at T1 and at T2, divided at the median, and by six-month mortality status. Categorical variables were compared using a chi-square test, and continuous variables were compared using a two-sample\nt\ntest or a Mann Whitney\nU\ntest, where appropriate. Biomarkers were treated continuously for the primary analysis but were divided at the median level only for purposes of presenting grouped data. The distributions of E2 and TNF\u03b1 were assessed, and log transformations were applied where appropriate.\nThe primary objective of this study was to identify evidence of a positive temporal feedback relationship between TNF\u03b1 and E2. A cross-lagged panel model was used to assess reciprocal relationships between E2 and TNF\u03b1 at T1 and T2 in the first week after TBI, described using the two equations below:\nE\n2\n2\n=\n\u03b2\n1\n\u2217\nE\n2\n1\n+\n\u03b2\n2\n\u2217\nT\nN\nF\n\u03b1\n1\n+\n\u03b2\nn\nC\nn\nT\nN\nF\n\u03b1\n2\n=\n\u03b2\n3\n\u2217\nT\nN\nF\n\u03b1\n1\n+\n\u03b2\n4\n\u2217\nE\n2\n1\n+\n\u03b2\nn\nC\nn\nIn these models, the subscripts 1 and 2 represent two time intervals, and C represents a matrix of relevant confounders. The corresponding beta coefficients (i.e., \u03b2\n1\nto \u03b2\n4\n) represent the different paths in the cross-lag panel, as shown conceptually in\nFigure 2\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nA conceptual representation of the cross-lag panel design. \u03b21 and \u03b23 represent autoregressive effects, or the association of a single variable over time. \u03b22 and \u03b24 represent cross-lag effects, or the association of one variable at an earlier time with the other variable at the second time point, after adjustment for autoregressive paths. E2, estradiol; TNF\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor alpha.\nIn this panel, \u03b2\n1\nand \u03b2\n3\nrepresent the effect of a variable on itself at a later time epoch, known as autoregressive effects. The autoregressive effects represent the stability of individual differences in a variable over time.\n47\nThe coefficients \u03b2\n2\nand \u03b2\n4\nrepresent the cross-lag effects, or the relationship between a single variable at one time epoch on another variable at a later time.\n47\nCrucially, cross-lag effects are estimated adjusting for the previous level of each variable itself. For example, the estimated association of TNF\u03b1 at T1 on E2 at T2 is independent of the effect of E2 at T1 on E2 at T2. The residual covariance of E2 and TNF\u03b1 at the same cross-sectional time point was also estimated; this represents the correlation between the errors; that is, the differences between the observed values and the predicted values from the fitted cross-lag model.\nWe aimed to determine the association between E2 and TNF\u03b1 on mortality risk in the first six months post-TBI. Time until death was right censored at six months post-TBI. Separate Cox proportional hazards regression models were created for T1 biomarkers and for T2 biomarkers. Variables associated at a\np\n<\u20090.20 threshold with E2 or TNF or with six-month death were considered potential confounders and were included as covariates in the cross-lag panel and Cox regression models.\nThe covariates included in the cross-lag model were: age, GCS, contusion, DAI, SDH, and rs2470152 genotype. For the Cox regression models, a series of four hierarchical models were created: model 1 (unadjusted), model 2 (adjusted for age only), model 3 (adjusted for age, GCS, non-head ISS CT abnormalities: contusion, SDH, and DAI), and model 4 (adjusted for age, GCS, CT abnormalities: contusion, SDH, and DAI, and rs2470152 genotype). The Harrell Concordance Statistic, a measure for model fit for Cox regression,\n48\nwas reported for all models.\nTo assess whether dysfunction across each of the five NNOD domains (CV, hematological, renal, hepatic, and pulmonary dysfunction) mediates biomarker-death associations, we conducted a series of mediation analyses following processes outlined by Baron and Kenny\n49\nand by Mackinnon and Dwyer.\n22\n,\n50\n,\n51\nWe also tested the total count of NNOD domains with dysfunction as a mediator. These mediation models tested and estimated the age and sex adjusted associations between T1 and T2 E2 and TNF\u03b1 and six-month death with (direct effect) and without (total effect) adjustment for each NNOD domain, and total count of NNOD domains.\nWe used multi-variable logistic regression for all binary outcome paths (each NNOD domain and six-month death), and a negative binomial model for total count of NNOD domain. We calculated the total mediation percentage for regression paths using the Y-standardization, a method proposed by Rijinhard and colleagues.\n52\nWe reported the mediation percentage in instances where the total effect was significant and greater than the direct effect. If the confidence interval of the direct effect overlapped 1, then the mediator was considered a full mediator; otherwise, the relationship was considered a partial mediator. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 15\n53\nand SAS 9.4.\n54"

    "Methods": "Animals\nThe animal protocol was approved by the Bay Pines VA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) and performed in accordance with all institutional, agency, and governmental animal welfare regulations. The ethics committee of the Sackler Faculty of Medicine also approved the experimental protocol, in compliance with the guidelines for animal experimentation of the National Institutes of Health.\nMale C57BL6/J mice at 5 weeks of age were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and Male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice of ~5 weeks of age were obtained from Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. (now Envigo, Jerusalem, Israel). They were housed three to four per cage in a 22\u00b0C \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C temperature-controlled environment with a 12 h light/dark cycle. Food and water were available\nad libitum\n. All mice were allowed to acclimate to the facility for 1 week prior to experimentation.\n\nClosed head injury\nmTBI was induced using a concussive closed head injury weight drop model, described previously.\n12\nThe apparatus consisted of a guide tube which was 80 cm in length with a 13 mm internal diameter. Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane, and placed on a sponge, allowing rotation of the head upon impact, to inflict a diffuse concussive injury.\n21\nThe sponge was located directly below the apparatus, and the mouse was placed such that the end of the guide tube spanned the right hemisphere caudal to the eye and rostral to the ear. A 30 g (first four injuries) or 50 g (final injury) cylindrical weight was dropped 80 cm through the length of the guide tube, impacting the right side of the head, in injured mice. Sham mice were anesthetized and placed on the sponge for an equivalent length of time, but no weight was dropped. This procedure, which has been demonstrated to cause a mild injury,\n22\nwas repeated five times with each injury occurring 1 week apart (\nFig. 1\n). Following injury or sham, mice were monitored in a separate chamber while recovering from anesthesia before being returned to regular housing. The weight used for injury began at 30 g, to accommodate the small size of the C57BL6/J mice at 6 weeks of age (~ 20 g on average). At the time of the final injury, we utilized a 50 g weight to deliver a slightly stronger injury, mimicking the variability present in humans with repeated TBIs.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental timeline. Mice were exposed to a closed head injury once per week for 5 weeks, beginning at ~6 weeks of age. The closed head injury involved dropping a weight through an 80 cm tube where it then impacted the right temporal region of the skull. The first four injuries utilized a 30 g weight, with the fifth and final injury using a 50 g weight. Approximately 30 min after each injury, mice were treated with a combination of tert-Butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) (33.4 mg/kg) and pioglitazone (3 mg/kg) or vehicle. In one group, brains were harvested for RNA analysis 1 day post-injury. In a second group, mice underwent behavioral testing 8 weeks post-injury.\n\nCombination treatment\nApproximately 30 min after each of the five injuries (or sham), mice were treated via intraperitoneal injection with a combination treatment containing 33.4 mg/kg tBHQ and 3 mg/kg pioglitazone or a 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in saline vehicle.\n20\nInjection solutions were made fresh on the day of injection. tBHQ and pioglitazone were initially dissolved in sterile DMSO separately at 200 mg/mL and 20 mg/mL concentrations, respectively. The solutions were then mixed and further diluted in sterile saline to the desired concentration (5 mg/mL tBHQ, 0.449 mg/mL pioglitazone). Additional DMSO was added to achieve a 5% total concentration. Total injection volume ranged from 134\n\u03bc\nL to 234\n\u03bc\nL, according to mouse body weight. As mice grew, injection volume increased to maintain the treatment at the same dosage per kilogram.\n\nNovel object recognition (NOR)\nNOR was performed on ICR mice 8 weeks following the final closed head injury. Three 5 min sessions, separated by 24 h, were performed in a 60 cm \u00d7 60 cm square arena. On the 1st day, each individual mouse was allowed to explore the empty arena. On the 2nd day, two identical objects were placed in the arena and each mouse was allowed to explore the objects. On the 3rd day, one of the objects was replaced with a novel object, and the time spent near each object was recorded. The arena was thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol between mice, and the order of mice undergoing behavioral testing alternated between experimental groups. A preference index was calculated as the time the animal spent near the novel object minus the time spent near the familiar object, divided by the sum of the time near the novel and familiar objects. These methods have been described previously.\n25\n\u2013\n29\n\nElevated plus maze\nAnxiety level was assessed using the elevated plus maze for ICR mice 8 weeks following the final closed head injury. The apparatus consisted of two open arms and two closed arms which were enclosed on all sides with the roof open (30 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 5 cm). The arms were arranged such that matching arms were opposite each other in a \u201c+\u201d shape. The maze was elevated above the floor level by 60 cm.\n30\nDuring testing, mice were placed in the center of the apparatus facing one of the open arms. The mouse was then allowed to explore the maze for 5 min, and time spent in each arm was recorded. Between animals, the apparatus was cleaned with a 70% ethanol solution. These methods have been described previously.\n31\n\nRNA extraction\nOne day following the final closed head injury, C57BL6/J mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and brains were harvested. C57BL6/J mice were chosen for the genetic analysis as they are an inbred strain that would produce less variation in gene expression between experimental animals. The hippocampus was dissected out and snap-frozen using liquid nitrogen. The tissue was pulverized and underwent TRIzol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) separation to extract RNA. Pulverized tissue was resuspended in 1 mL TRIzol and homogenized using a polytron homogenizer (PRO Scientific, Oxford, CT). The homogenized tissue was incubated at 23\u00b0C for 5 min and then stored on ice. Next, 200\n\u03bc\nL CHCl\n3\nwas added, vortexed, and incubated at room temperature for 2\u20133 min. The tubes were then spun in a refrigerated centrifuge set to 4\u00b0C for 10 min at 12,000 relative centrifugal force (RCF) to separate phases. The top layer was removed, and an equal volume of 70% ethanol was added. The Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to further purify the RNA. The samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.\n\nGene expression analysis\nFollowing RNA extraction, samples containing RNA from the ipsilateral hippocampus were confirmed as intact with an Agilent Bioanalyzer and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip MOE430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) at the Moffitt Cancer Center Molecular Genomics Core Facility (Tampa, FL). Although earlier unpublished results suggest that there may be some partial effects in the contralateral hippocampus, this analysis focuses only on the ipsilateral hippocampus in injured versus sham and combination-treated versus vehicle-treated mice. We then analyzed the array data with the aid of GeneSpring software version 14.9.1 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Each group contained samples from six different brains for a total of 24 different mice examined.\n\nStatistical analysis\nMean values are depicted \u00b1 standard deviation with\np\n< 0.05 indicating significance. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for analysis of the behavioral data. The Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\nTest was used with median expression values to determine significant fold changes in RNA expression."

    "Methods": "Ethics, participants, and recruitment\nThe Trondheim Mild TBI study is a large-scale prospective cohort study with follow-up for 12 months in patients with mTBI and matched controls, all between 16 and 59 years of age (Norwegian National Ethics Approval: REK 2013/754). The upper age limit was chosen due to the higher frequency of comorbidities in the elderly. All participants, and guardians of participants between the age of 16 and 18 years, provided informed consent. The cohort and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up have been described in detail previously.\n12\n,\n13\nAll data were handled in accordance with the STROBE checklist (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n).\nPatients were included in the study between April 1, 2014 and December 5, 2015. Patients were prospectively recruited by continuous screening of computed tomography (CT) referrals and patient lists from two emergency departments (EDs): St. Olavs Hospital (Trondheim University Hospital), a regional Level 1 trauma center in Trondheim, Norway, and Trondheim Municipal Emergency Clinic, a general practitioner-run, outpatient clinic. Patients were included when having sustained a TBI categorized as mild according to the WHO criteria: 1) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 13\u201315 at presentation in the ED; 2) witnessed loss of consciousness (LOC) <30\u2009min, confusion, or post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) <24\u2009h, or traumatic lesion on neuroimaging, and did not meet any exclusion criteria. (\nSupplementary Table S1\n).\n14\n,\n15\nClinical information was obtained from patient interviews and medical records. LOC was rated as present only if observed. Duration of PTA was recorded as the time after injury for which the patient had no continuous memory (< 1\u2009h, or 1\u201324\u2009h). GCS score was assessed in the ED or inferred from the record. Presence of injuries to parts of the body other than the head was recorded, and dichotomized into \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d based on self-report and records. Such injuries were cranial fractures; fractures of extremities, clavicles, and ribs; wounds; and sprains, dislocations, and other soft-tissue injuries. Bruises and wounds that did not need suturing were not included. Major trauma was an exclusion criterion in the study.\nCommunity controls, matched on age, sex, and years of education were recruited among staff, friends, and families of staff and patients. The same exclusion criteria as for the TBI patients were used (\nSupplementary Table S1\n).\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging protocol\nMRI scans were acquired using a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Skyra MRI scanner, software version E11C, with a 32-channel head coil. The same MRI protocol was used for all participants; three-dimensional (3D) volumes were obtained with T1-weighted (magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo [MPRAGE]), T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). An axial (2D) diffusion-weighted scan and a diffusion tensor/kurtosis scan were also acquired. The clinical scans were read by an experienced neuroradiologist according to predefined criteria as described in a previous publication.\n13\n\nBlood samples\nBlood was acquired from patients with mTBI in the admission phase, defined as within 72\u2009h post-injury; 2 weeks (\u00b1 3 days); 3 months (\u00b1 2 weeks); and 12 months (\u00b1 1 month) after the injury. For the community controls, blood was collected at inclusion corresponding to the admission phase for the patients, and after 3 and 12 months. Plasma samples used in the current study were obtained from whole blood collected in 5-mL tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), directly placed on ice, and centrifuged within 30\u2009min at 2000 x\ng\nfor 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Aliquoted plasma samples were immediately stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nCytokine analysis\nThe EDTA plasma samples were analyzed using a commercial fluorescence magnetic bead-based immunoassay, with high-sensitivity detection range and precision (Bio-Plex Human Cytokine 27-Plex, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). The following cytokines were analyzed: IL-1\u03b2, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8; CXCL8), IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, eotaxin-1 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 11; CCL11), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-basic), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), IFN-\u03b3-inducing protein 10 (IP-10; CXCL10), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1; CCL2), macrophage inflammatory protein-1-alpha (MIP-1\u03b1; CCL3), macrophage inflammatory protein-1-beta (MIP-1\u03b2; CCL4), platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), RANTES (CCL5), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).\nThe analyses were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, plasma samples were diluted 1:4 in Sample Diluent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). A lower detection limit for the cytokines in the low picogram/milliliter range (<20\u2009pg/mL for all cytokines) was determined automatically by the software based on the standard curve for each cytokine. Based on many years of experience with the multi-plex assay and a low inter-assay coefficient of variation (<11 for all cytokines), the samples were run in single. All samples from this study were analyzed using the same batch of the Bio-Plex assay and on each plate randomly chosen sample sets from patients and healthy controls were analyzed.\nUnder physiological conditions most of the cytokines in plasma are either not detected or detected in very low amounts.\n16\nThus, only cytokines that were present in methodologically and clinically meaningful amounts, according to our previous experience,\n16\nin more than 75% of all samples during the observation period, were selected for further study (\nn\n=\u200912,\nsee Results\nsection). The remaining 15 were regarded as negative and therefore not included in further analyses.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFrequencies and percentages of demographic and clinical variables for the total number of participants with data available at a minimum of one time-point were calculated.\nDescriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range, and range) of non-log transformed cytokine values were calculated.\nCytokine data are presented as box plots. Mixed model analyses were performed to compare the time course of cytokine levels from the admission phase to 12 months after injury for the mTBI group versus the community control group. As there are no available control data at the 2-week time-point, this time-point was removed from the mixed model analyses, although the 2-week patient data are retained in the box plots. Certain cytokine concentrations were log-transformed due to large ranges and non-normal distribution of the data (marked on plot legends and table legends). The mixed model analyses were conducted with time, group, and time-by-group interaction as fixed effects and a subject-specific random intercept to account for within-subject correlations. Mixed model analyses were performed for all cytokines with and without controlling for heterogeneous variances. All model fits were shown to be improved with heterogeneous variances controlled for (\nSupplementary Table S2\n), thus all data presented are derived from these models. Post hoc contrast analyses between patient and control groups were performed for all cytokines that showed a main effect of group. For those showing a time-by-group interaction effect, further post hoc contrast analyses were used to assess within-group changes for the mTBI group between successive time-points.\nBest-subset regression analyses were performed to determine the combination of demographic (sex and age) and clinical (GCS score, PTA duration, LOC, traumatic MRI findings) variables that best predict admission-phase cytokine levels. The best model was determined based on the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The cytokine values were first standardized at each time-point, and then the best-subset regression analyses were performed using the standardized biomarkers as outcome variables. Regression coefficients based on non-standardized biomarker values were also reported. In the patients with mTBI, we also calculated the empirical group means and standard deviations of cytokine levels for each categorical predictor used in the best-subset regression analysis.\nAll tests were two-sided with significance determined at\np\n<\u20090.05. Post hoc contrast analyses of the mixed models were Bonferroni corrected (significance level of group differences at each time-point: 0.05/3\u2009=\u20090.017; significance level of within-group changes for the mTBI group between time-points: 0.05/3\u2009=\u20090.017).\nAll statistical tests were calculated using R version 3.2.2.\n17\nDescriptive statistics were calculated using R's base package functions. Mixed model analyses were performed using the nlme package.\n18\nBest-subset multiple regressions were performed using the bestglm package.\n19"

    "Methods": "Animal care\nAll animals were acquired, cared for, and used in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and followed protocols approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use (IACUC) at University of Wyoming. Rats were placed in animal rooms with a temperature range of 22\u201324\u00b0C, stable humidity, a 12-h day-night cycle, and free access to rodent laboratory food and water. Animals were housed in individual cages for the duration of the study.\n\nSpinal cord injury\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned randomly into one of five groups: non-injured control (3 animals), sham or SCI 3 DPI (6 animals per group), or sham or SCI 14 DPI (14 animals per group). SCI surgical procedures were performed as previously described.\n32\nBriefly, rats were anesthetized by 2% isoflurane inhalation, and the T10 vertebral area was shaved and sterilized using iodine and isopropyl alcohol. Skin was incised, muscles around the T10 vertebra were cleared, and a partial laminectomy was performed at T10. The spine was suspended via clamps near the exposed spinal cord, to ensure the exposed spinal cord was parallel to the horizontal plane of the surgery table. SCI was induced using an NYU Impactor, by dropping a 10-g, 1.1-mm diameter rod onto the exposed spinal cord from a 25-mm height. Musculature and skin were sutured using 6-0 sutures. After surgery, animals received buprenorphine (NDC 42023-179-05, Par Pharmaceutical, Chestnut Ridge, NY, USA, 0.05\u2009mg/kg) twice daily for 3 days, and baytril (cat. no. 101-5977, Bayer Healthcare, LLC, 5\u2009mg/kg) once daily for 7 days. Bladders were expressed twice daily until recovery of bladder function was observed.\n\nBehavioral assessment\nThe Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) scale was used for functional evaluation of recovery as previously described.\n32\nBriefly, each rat was placed in a circular plastic enclosure and observed by two independent investigators. Each rat was scored during a 4-min session and the observers' scores were averaged to obtain the animal's score at every time-point.\n\nTissue harvesting and glycomic analysis\nAt end-points, animals (3 animals per group) were anesthetized with inhalation of 2% isoflurane with pure oxygen. Animals were perfused with saline and T10 spinal cord tissue was harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.\nSpinal cord samples were treated as described previously.\n33\nBriefly, each spinal cord sample was subjected to sonication in the presence of 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate hydrate (detergent CHAPS), reduction in 4\u2009M guanidine-HCl (Pierce), carboxymethylation, and trypsin digestion. The digested glycoproteins were then purified by hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) plus C\n18\n-Sep-Pak (cat. no. 186000132, Waters Corp., Hertfordshire, UK). Products from N-linked glycosylation were released by peptide\nN\n-glycosidase F (E.C. 3.5.1.52, Roche Applied Science) digestion, whereas products from O-linked glycosylation were released by reductive elimination. Released products from N- and O-linked glycosylation were permethylated using the sodium hydroxide procedure and purified by classic C\n18\n-Sep-Pak (cat. no. WAT051910, Waters Corp.).\nMass spectrometry (MS) and tandem MS (MS/MS) data were acquired using a 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight) mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). Permethylated samples were dissolved in 10\u2009\u03bcL of methanol and 1\u2009\u03bcL of dissolved sample was pre-mixed with 1\u2009\u03bcL of matrix (10\u2009mg/mL 3,4-diaminobenzophenone in 75% [v/v] aqueous acetonitrile), spotted onto a target plate, and dried under vacuum. For the MS/MS studies, the collision energy was set to 1\u2009kV, and argon was used as collision gas. The 4700-calibration standard kit, calmix (Applied Biosystems), was used as the external calibrant for the MS mode, and [Glu1] fibrinopeptide B human (Sigma) was used as an external calibrant for the MS/MS mode.\nThe MS and MS/MS data were processed using Data Explorer 4.9 software (Applied Biosystems). The processed spectra were subjected to manual assignment and annotation with the aid of a glycobioinformatics tool, GlycoWorkBench.\n34\nThe proposed assignments were based on\n12\nC isotopic composition together with knowledge of the biosynthetic pathways. The proposed structures were then confirmed by data obtained from MS/MS experiments.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nSCI experiments matching with those performed for glycosylation structure analysis were duplicated on additional animals for immunohistochemistry (IHC). At end-point, 3 DPI animals and 14 DPI animals were euthanized via perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137\u2009mM NaCl, 2.7\u2009mM KCl, 10\u2009mM Na2HPO4, and 1.8\u2009mM KH2PO4; PH 7.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1, cat. no. 14200075, Life Technologies). Samples were placed in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (cat. no. 625501-01, Sakura Finetek USA, Inc.) and 20-\u03bcm sections were sliced using a cryostat (CM3050 S, Leica Biosystems).\nCT1 hybridoma cells were generously provided by Dr. Ramiro Alberio of the University of Nottingham. Hybridoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12; cat. no. 11330032, Gibco Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; cat. no. 16140071, Gibco) and 5\u2009\u03bcg/mL of Baytril for 2\u20133 days in 5% CO\n2\nat 37\u00b0C. Cells were centrifuged at 300\ng\n(gravitational force) for 5\u2009min, then supernatant was used to isolate antibody via affinity chromatography using HiTrap IgM Purification HP column (cat. no. 17511001, GE Healthcare Life Sciences).\nFixed sections of spinal cord tissue were washed with PBS 3 times for 5\u2009min each, and blocked using blocking buffer (10% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 1% normal goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1\u2009h. Sections then were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in dilution buffer (1% BSA, 0.1% normal goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) at 4\u00b0C overnight, washed 3 times for 5\u2009min each, and incubated with secondary antibodies in dilution buffer for 2\u2009h. Sections next were washed 3 times for 5\u2009min each, then stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; diluted 1:1000 in PBS, 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL, cat. no. 62248, ThermoFisher Scientific) for 7\u2009min. After this washing and staining, slides were covered with mounting media and cover-slipped (cat. no. F6182, Sigma).\nTo stain Sda structure, CT1 antibody (2\u2009\u03bcg/mL, mouse immunoglobulin M [IgM]) was used, followed by FITC conjugated anti-mouse IgM antibody (1:400, 5\u2009\u03bcg/mL, cat. no. AP128F, Millipore).\nTo stain microglial cells, anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) antibody (1:500, 1.12\u2009\u03bcg/mL, rabbit IgG, cat. no. NBP2-19019, Novus Biologicals) was used, followed by TRITC conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:400, 13.25\u2009\u03bcg/mL, cat. no. T6778, Sigma Aldrich) or Alexa Flour\n\u00ae\n405 conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:400, 5\u2009\u03bcg/mL, cat. no. ab175655, abcam).\nTo stain astrocytes, anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody (1:500, 2\u2009\u03bcg/mL, chicken IgY, cat. no. AB5541, Millipore) was used, followed by Alexa Flour\n\u00ae\n555 conjugated goat anti-chicken IgY antibody (1:400, 5\u2009\u03bcg/mL, cat. no. A21437, ThermoFisher Scientific).\nTo stain CD8 T cells, anti-CD8 antibody (1:100, 2\u2009\u03bcg/mL, mouse IgG, cat. no. sc-1177, Santa Cruz) was used, followed by Alexa Flour\n\u00ae\n555 conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:400, 5\u2009\u03bcg/mL, cat. no. A21127, ThermoFisher Scientific).\nSections were imaged on a confocal microscope (Zeiss) and Image J software (NIH) was used to measure CT1 fluorescent intensities. Six sections were averaged to represent each animal, with 6 animals per group in CT1 fluorescent intensities. Bright field images were taken using transmitted light detector (TPMT) under confocal microscope (Zeiss).\n\nWestern blot\nSpinal cord samples from sham and SCI animals at 14 DPI (5 animals per group) were harvested and tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were homogenized and total proteins were extracted as previously described.\n35\nProtein concentrations were measured via absorbance at 280-nm wavelength and using a standard curve to extrapolate the concentration using Nanodrop (Thermofisher), then relative concentration of protein in each sample was readjusted using band intensities of \u03b2-actin with Image J software.\nThe samples (13\u2009\u03bcg/lane) were separated using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (cat. no. 1620112, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) as previously described.\n36\nThe membrane was probed with CT1 antibody (2 ug/mL), anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (1:5000, 0.42\u2009\u03bcg/mL, cat. no. A1978, Sigma, mouse IgG). Secondary antibodies were peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgM secondary antibody (1:10,000, 0.08 ug/mL, cat. no. 31440, ThermoFisher) and peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:3000, 0.33 ug/mL, cat. no. 61-6520, ThermoFisher). Blots were developed with chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (cat. no. CPSOC, Sigma) and visualized on an iBright FL1000 Imager (cat. no. A32748, Invitrgen). Western blot band intensities were measured using Image J software (NIH). An average of 5 animals were represented for each group. Relative expression of Sda structure was measured by CT1 band intensities divided by \u03b2-actin band intensities.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for statistical significance.\nP\n\u2264\u20090.05 was considered as significant difference.

    "Methods": "Prognostic research studies can be separated into two main categories: studies with a focus on the prognostic role of specific patient- or disease-related characteristics in relation to outcome (\u201cprognostic factor research\u201d), and studies with a focus on the combined effect of various prognostic factors in predicting the outcome (\u201cprediction model research\u201d) (Table 1).5,11,15In prognostic factor studies, we may start with assessing whether the factor is independently associated with the outcome of interest. \u201cIndependently\u201d here refers to the association of the prognostic factor with the outcome separate from other prognostic indicators, and typically requires some form of statistical adjustment in the analysis. We may also analyze whether the risk of the outcome uniformly increases or decreases, or has a more complex relationship when considering a continuous predictor. Moreover, we may be interested in a quantification of the incremental predictive value.\n\nIn prognostic factor research, it is typical to first study univariable relations of the prognostic factor in a cross-table or regression model, followed by regression analyses adjusting for other variables related to the outcome. The effect measure commonly is relative, for example, an odds ratio (OR) in a logistical regression model, when considering a binary outcome, or hazard ratio (HR) in a Cox regression model, when considering a survival outcome. Apvalue may support claims of statistical significance, which can also be inferred if the 95% confidence interval does not include the value 1. Graphical assessments are helpful to study the shape of an association, while the incremental value can be noted from the improvement in performance measures such as the concordance (c) statistic (equivalent to the area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve for binary outcomes), or Nagelkerke'sR2.\n\nWhereas prognostic factor research may give rise to speculation on causal effect and mechanism of action, prediction models commonly address a more pragmatic research question: How well can we predict the outcome based on a combination of prognostic factors? In prediction model research, it is typical to analyze combinations of prognostic factors in multivariable models, followed by analyses of predictive performance, including measures for discrimination (e.g., c statistic) and calibration (e.g., graphics and calibration statistics).6The assessment of performance needs validation in independent data. We can distinguish between internal and external validation. With internal validation procedures, such as bootstrap resampling and cross-validation, we aim to correct the performance estimates. In external validation studies, we study the generalizability of the model in different but related settings; for example, by assessing the performance of a proposed model in another cohort.16,17\n\nMethodological guidance for prognostic research is dispersed throughout the literature. We take two previously proposed reporting guidelines as a basis: REporting recommendations for tumour MARKer prognostic studies (REMARK), which was originally intended for reporting of marker research in oncology, and Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD), which was proposed for reporting of prediction model development and validation.9,18\n\nGuidance for prognostic factor research\nThe original REMARK guideline consists of 20 items that need to be reported in studies that focus on one or more prognostic factors (\nSupplementary Table S2\n). More specifically, the guideline was developed for prognostic model studies in oncology that include tumor markers. The REMARK guideline is applicable to prognostic factor research in fields other than oncology, and is especially relevant when tissue biomarkers are included as candidate predictors. The guideline was endorsed by multiple journals.\n10\n,\n18\n,\n19\nAn \u201cExploration and Elaboration\u201d document provides more detail on the choice of the items, their relevance, and examples of good practice.\n20\nWe focus on the items that are most relevant to prognostic factors in TBI research and provide examples for illustration (\nTable 2\n).\nTable 2.\nSpecific Elements for Prognostic Factor Research in TBI, Building on the REMARK Guideline\n1\n0\nTopic\nDescription\nSelection of patients\nInclusion and exclusion criteria may vary among studies in relevant aspects, such as age, severity, setting, region, and treatment policies. Inclusion of patients is ideally consecutive.\nPrognostic factors considered\nTypical prognostic factors may include clinical indicators (vital signs, intracranial pressure, cerebroperfusion pressure); radiological imaging (CT scan, MRI); electrophysiological tests (EEG, SSPEP); and tissue biomarkers (in blood, cerebrospinal fluid). Timing of assessment after trauma, method of acquisition (technology), as well as methods of handling and storage are important to report and address in statistical analyses.\nStudy design\nAll candidate variables need to be reported if examined or considered for inclusion in statistical models. Outcome measures must be chosen in relation to the severity of the TBI and may vary from mild to more severe TBI. Rationale for sample size should be provided.\nStatistical analysis methods\nA core set of predictors needs to be considered for adjustment of prognostic factor associations, depending on the severity of disease and availability of data. Core predictors for moderate and severe TBI include age, motor score (or full GCS), and pupillary reactivity. For mild TBI, the core set is less well defined and may depend on the outcome considered. Missing values in the variables in the core set may be imputed to gain efficiency.\nThe relation of the marker to the core set variables needs to be studied; for example, with correlation analyses and graphical inspections.\nMarker values are commonly continuous in nature. The shape of the association with the outcome needs to be examined with sufficiently flexible functions, such as splines, with graphical inspection.\nDescriptive results\nConsider the flow of patients through each stage of the analysis, with the number of events, and reasons for dropout.\nDescribe characteristics in sufficient detail, including demographics, standard prognostic variables, and the prognostic factors considered, including the numbers of missing values.\nStatistical results\nUnivariate and adjusted analyses show the relationship between the marker and outcome, with the estimated association (for example, odds ratio plus confidence interval). Adjustment should be for the core set of variables, irrespective of statistical significance. Incremental predictive value can be indicated by measures for discrimination, such as the increase in c statistic, and overall fit, such as explained variability (\nR\n2\n).\nInterpretation\nResults should be interpreted in the context of the pre-specified hypotheses and other relevant studies. Ideally, replication is done in similar studies. Limitations of the study, and implications for future research, need to be considered.\nOpen in a separate window\nTBI, traumatic brain injury; REMARK, REporting recommendations for tumour\nMARKer\nprognostic\nstudies;\nCT, computed tomography; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; EEG, electroencephalography; SSEP, somatosensory evoked potential; GCS, Glasgow Coma Score.\nPatient selection\nWhen designing prognostic studies, the study population must represent the targeted population for which these models will be used. However, the selection of patients may vary substantially among studies. Inclusion and exclusion criteria may differ among studies in relevant aspects, such as age (pediatric, adult, geriatric), severity (e.g., based on the Glasgow Coma Scale score [GCS]), setting (emergency department, ward, intensive care unit), region (low/middle/high income country), and treatment policies. For example, the CRASH study included 7526 patients from low- and middle-income countries, and 2482 from high-income countries, where mortality at 14 days was 21% versus 16% (\np\n<\u20090.001).\n7\nThe IMPACT study included 11 cohorts (three RCTs, eight observational studies),\n8\nand substantial differences were found in outcome among 265 centers in this study.\n21\nIn the InTBIR consortium, inclusion criteria also varied substantially among studies, considering the different objectives and targeted populations of TBI patients (See Box 1).\nBox 1.\u2002International Initiative for Traumatic Brain Injury Research (InTBIR) Consortium\nInTBIR is a collaborative effort of the European Commission (EC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the United States Department of Defense (DoD), the Ontario Brain Institute (OBI), and OneMind, which aims to coordinate and leverage international clinical research activities on TBI research. InTBIR's goal is to improve healthcare and lessen the global burden of TBI through the discovery of causal relationships between treatments and clinically meaningful outcomes. InTBIR therefore focuses on collecting, standardizing, and sharing clinical TBI data for comparative effectiveness research.\nA Selection of InTBIR Studies and their Characteristics\nStudy\nGeographical region(s)\nCenters\nInclusion criteria\nCREACTIVE\nEurope, Israel\n72\nModerate to severe TBI\nCENTER-TBI\nEurope, Israel\n59\nClinical diagnosis of TBI; <24\u2009h after injury; clinical indication for CT scan\nADAPT\nAustralia, Europe, India, New Zealand, South Africa, United States\n49\n<18 years of age; severe TBI; require ICP monitoring\nTRACK-TBI\nUnited States\n20\nClinical diagnosis of TBI; clinical indication for CT scan\nTBI-Prognosis\nCanada\n17\nSevere TBI; admitted to the intensive care unit\nGNRG\nLatin America\n14\n\u226513 years of age; Severe TBI; non-penetrating TBI; absence of ICP monitoring\nTBIcare\nUnited States\n2\n\u226518 years of age; mild to severe TBI; clinically significant pain over the last 6 months\nOpen in a separate window\nInformation obtained from\nhttps://intbir.nih.gov/projects\nPrognostic factors\nPrognostic factors may range from clinical indicators (e.g., disease severity, vital signs, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure) to radiological imaging (e.g., computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), electrophysiological tests (electroencephalogram [EEG], somatosensory evoked potential [SSEP]), and tissue biomarkers (in blood, or cerebrospinal fluid) (\nSupplementary Table S4\n). The timing of measurements may vary from the acute phase to several weeks after trauma.\nBiomarkers have received increased attention in the last decade. Specifics of the data acquisition need to be considered carefully, and this may be challenging when conducting multi-center studies. Timing and method of acquisition, as well as methods of preservation and storage, are important. Apart from these aspects being reported, they may also need to be addressed in statistical analyses; for example, by adjusting for the time between data acquisition and trauma. If control samples are used, their characteristics also need to be described carefully, including their selection.\nThe assay methods used should be provided, preferably with a detailed protocol, including specific reagents or kits used, quality control procedures, reproducibility assessments, quantitation methods, and scoring and reporting protocols. Further, it is important to perform assays blinded to the study end-point, for an unbiased assessment.\nAs an example, biomarkers were sampled at admission up to 24 months post-injury in the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study. Samples of whole blood, serum, and plasma for genetic, biomarker, and hemostasis analyses were stored in a specific biobank (Pecs, Hungary). A detailed description of the data acquisition, including the timing, method, preservation, and storage has been described elsewhere.\n22\nStudy design\nCohort studies are the preferred design for prognostic research. Ideally, we measure a prognostic factor in a prospective cohort of consecutive patients and evaluate the relationship with the outcome while minimizing potential confounding. Confounding may occur if these prognostic factors (from clinical data or test results) are evaluated according to clinical indications. In TBI research, we might consider a number of different outcomes, depending on the research question and population under study (see Box 2). For efficiency, case-control or nested case-control designs can also be used for prognostic factor studies, especially if measurements are relatively expensive. For reporting, all clinical end-points, and all candidate variables, need to be mentioned if examined or considered for inclusion in any form of statistical analysis. Such a transparent report is essential for proper interpretation of a specific prognostic factor\u2013outcome relationship from a large set of potential relationships as examined in the study. For subjective outcomes measure, blinding of the assessor is important. This means that the assessor should be unaware of the values of the results of the prognostic factors studied.\nBox 2.\u2002Selection of Outcomes to Be Considered in Prognosis Research in Traumatic Brain Injury\nOutcome\nInstrument\nMortality\n-\nFunctional status\nGOS-E\nGeneric HRQoL\nEQ5-D, SF36, SF12\nTBI-specific HRQoL\nQoLIBRI, QoLIBRI-OS\nPost-concussion symptoms\nRivermead post-concussion questionnaire\nPost-traumatic stress disorder\nPCL-5\nDepression\nHADS, PHQ-9\nAnxiety\nHADS, GAD-7\nNeuropsychological testing\nGOAT, RAVLT, TMT, CANTAB, 10\u2009m walk and timed up and go\nReturn to work\n-\nOpen in a separate window\nAdapted from Maas et al., 2014.\n22\nGOS-E, Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended; HRQoL, health-related quality of life; EQ-5D: EuroQol 5 Dimensions Questionnaire; SF12, Short-Form 12; SF36, Short-Form 36; QOLIBRI, Quality of Life after Brain Injury; QOLIBRI-OS, QOLIBRI-Overall Scale; PCL-5, PTSD Check List; HADS, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; PHQ-9, Patient Health Questionnaire; GAD-7, General Anxiety Disorder 7; GOAT, Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test; RAVLT, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test; TMT, Trail Making Test; CANTAB, Cantab neuropsychological assessment tests.\nSample size\nA methodological and ethical rationale for the sample size should be provided (see Box 3). A formal approach may consider a pre-specified effect size for the prognostic factor, combined with the anticipated distribution of the factor and the end-point. A pragmatic rationale can also be provided.\nBox 3.\u2002Example of a Rationale For Sample Size\nSample size calculation for the CENTER-TBI study\nThe sample size estimate (\nn\n=\u20095400) for the CENTER-TBI study was motivated by:\nPractical logistical considerations; higher numbers would imply too large a burden on local, national, and international infrastructure.\nPower calculations for the different strata, targeting comparative effectiveness analyses, assuming a between-center and between-country heterogeneity as identified in previous research (expressed by variance parameter from a random effects model, tau of 0.43).\nPostulated odds ratios for intervention effects of \u223c5% improvement in outcome, to be evaluated in comparative effectiveness research.\nOverall, a sample size of 5400 subjects would provide statistical power to detect odds ratios of 1.2 associated with differences in process characteristics of specific interventions with a power of 80%.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSome key predictors need to be considered for adjustment of prognostic factor associations (\u201cadjustment model\u201d), with the aim of disentangling the \u201cindependent\u201d association of the prognostic factor. The choice of the set will depend on the severity of TBI and the availability of data. Core predictors for moderate and severe TBI may include age, motor score (or full GCS), and pupillary reactivity (based on literature, and the CRASH and IMPACT core models) (Table\nS1\n). Other important prognostic factors may include CT characteristics, secondary insults, and biomarker measurements.\n23\nFor mild TBI, a core set is less well defined and may depend on the outcome considered, such as post-concussive symptoms, neurocognitive functioning, and health-related quality of life. In defining confounders, we should follow epidemiological principles, and not adjust for intermediate factors, which are positioned in between the prognostic factor and the outcome.\nThe analysis with the adjustment model should ideally be described in detail, not only with respect to the selection of potentially confounding factors, but also on their coding, and the approach to missing values (see Box 4). Further, the relationship of the prognostic factors to the variables in the adjustment model need to be studied, including correlation analyses and graphical inspections. A final issue is how we deal with continuous variables (see Box 5).\nBox 4.\u2002Missing Values\nFor missing values, multiple imputation has evolved as a standard statistical tool. For many research questions, it is suboptimal to simply drop records with a missing value (complete case analysis). It may be reasonable to drop a variable with high numbers of missing observations.\nMultiple imputation\nMultiple imputation may often be reasonable for missing values in the variables in the adjustment model, to maximize the available sample size for the adjusted analysis. The assumption is that missingness may be related to other variables, but not to unmeasured confounders. To make this \u201cmissing at random\u201d assumption plausible, it is advised to let the imputation model have a rich set of variables: prognostic factors, context factors (e.g. place [site] and time [year] of inclusion), and the outcome.\nMultiple imputation may also be used for the prognostic factor under study. Such imputation may be more controversial, because we may not want to project findings from the prognostic factor: outcome relation in the complete data on the incomplete data. On the other hand, imputation is efficient, especially if the prognostic factor is correlated to other factors. Repeating the imputations multiple times should appropriately capture uncertainty in the process.\nEven more controversial is the imputation of missing outcome data. Statistically, this approach is especially useful if correlates of outcome are available, such that the correlation structure can be exploited. For example, missing 6 month Glasglow Outcome Score (GOS) might be imputed for a patient if 3 and 12 month GOS are available in the data. Again, uncertainty should be captured appropriately by repeating the imputation procedure several times (Richter et al., 2019).\n56\nEach imputed data set is analyzed as a complete set, with combination of results according to Rubin's rules (Van Buuren, 2018).\n57\nBox 5.\u2002Continuous Variables\nA common approach is to dichotomize prognostic factors as normal/abnormal, or normal/elevated. Such dichotomization implies a loss of information if the original variable was continuous (Royston et al., 2006). This loss can be quantified by comparing model fit with a continuous version of the prognostic factor and a dichotomized version, expressed, for example, as explained variability (\nR\n2\nstatistics). There are many arguments why dichotomization should be avoided in medical research (Royston, 2006).\n58\nInstead, the shape of the association of a continuous predictor with the outcome needs to be examined carefully. A linear association may be considered as a starting point. Log transformations are common to consider for biomarkers. Various other types of non-linear functions can be used, which provide greater flexibility, such as square terms, splines, or fractional polynomials. Graphical inspection is also useful to visualize relations that are difficult to grasp from formulas. Differences in fit can be examined, for example, by\nR\n2\nstatistics.\nContinuous variables in the IMPACT study\nLinear relations with outcome were good approximations after assessment of non-linearity using restricted cubic splines for the continuous predictors age and glucose. A positive linear relation was observed for age and glucose, with higher values being associated with poorer prognosis (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nNonlinearity assessment of continuous variables age (left) and glucose (right) in parts of the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in Traumatic Brain Injury (IMPACT) study."

    "Methods": "Patient population\nAll patients from the multi-center CENTER-TBI high resolution ICU monitoring cohort with parenchymal ICP and PbtO\n2\nmonitoring, with a 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale \u2013 Extended (GOSE) score, were included in this analysis. Patients with external ventricular drain (EVD) based ICP data were excluded given the interrupted nature of their recordings (i.e., reliable ICP can be recorded only when the drainage is closed). These patients were prospectively recruited between January 2015 and December 2017 from 21 centers in the European Union (EU). All patients were admitted to ICU for their TBI during the course of the study, with high frequency digital signals recorded from their ICU monitors during the course of their ICU stay. All patients predominantly had moderate to severe TBI (moderate\u2009=\u2009Glasgow Coma Score [GCS] 9\u201312, and severe\u2009=\u2009GCS \u22648). A minority of patients (\nn\n=\u20099) were categorized at the time of admission as having less severe TBI, but experienced subsequent early deterioration leading to ICU admission for care and monitoring. All patients in this cohort had invasive ICP monitoring conducted in accordance with the BTF guidelines.\n8\n\nEthics\nData used in these analyses were collected as part of the CENTER-TBI study, which had individual national or local regulatory approval; the UK Ethics approval is provided as an exemplar (IRAS No: 150943; REC 14/SC/1370). The CENTER-TBI study (EC grant 602150) has been conducted in accordance with all relevant laws of the EU if directly applicable or of direct effect, and all relevant laws of the country where the recruiting sites were located, including but not limited to, the relevant privacy and data protection laws and regulations (the \u201cPrivacy Law\u201d), the relevant laws and regulations on the use of human materials, and all relevant guidance relating to clinical studies from time to time in force including, but not limited to, the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95) (\u201cICH GCP\u201d) and the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki entitled \u201cEthical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.\u201d Informed consent by the patients and/or the legal representative/next of kin was obtained, accordingly to the local legislations, for all patients recruited in the core data set of CENTER-TBI and documented in the electronic case report form (e-CRF).\n\nData collection\nAs part of recruitment to the multi-center high resolution ICU cohort of CENTER-TBI, all patients had demographic, injury, and imaging data prospectively recorded. Similarly, all patients had high frequency digital signals from ICU monitoring recorded throughout their ICU stay, with the goal of initiating recording within 24\u2009h of ICU admission. All digital ICU signals were further processed (\nsee Signal Acquisition\nand\nSignal Processing\nsections). For the purpose of this study, basic admission demographics and centrally reported computed tomography (CT) variables for the first available CT of each patient were extracted.\n24\nThey included: age, admission best GCS motor score and pupillary reactivity (bilaterally reactive, unilateral reactive, bilateral unreactive), Marshall CT Classification,\n25\nRotterdam CT score,\n26\nand presence or absence of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH), extradural hematoma (EDH), pre-hospital hypotension, and pre-hospital hypoxia. CENTER-TBI data version 2.1 was accessed for the purpose of this study, via Opal database software.\n27\n\nSignal acquisition\nArterial blood pressure (ABP) was obtained through arterial lines connected to pressure transducers. ICP was acquired from an intra-parenchymal strain gauge probe (Codman ICP MicroSensor; Codman & Shurtleff Inc., Raynham, MA), parenchymal fiberoptic pressure sensor (Camino ICP Monitor, Integra Life Sciences, Plainsboro, NJ, USA;\nhttps://www.integralife.com/\n). PbtO\n2\nmonitoring occurred via invasive parenchymal monitoring (Licox probe; Integra, Licox Brain Oxygen Monitoring System, Plainboro, NJ), typically placed in the frontal lobe. All signals were recorded using digital data transfer or digitized via an A/D converter (DT9803; Data Translation, Marlboro, MA), where appropriate; sampled at frequency of 100 Hertz (Hz) or higher, using the ICM+ software (Cambridge Enterprise Ltd, Cambridge, UK,\nhttp://icmplus.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk\n) or Moberg CNS Monitor (Moberg Research Inc, Ambler, PA, USA,\nhttps://www.moberg.com\n) or a combination of both. Signal artefacts were removed using both manual and automated methods prior to further processing or analysis.\n\nSignal processing\nPost-acquisition processing of the above-described signals was conducted using ICM+ (Cambridge Enterprise Ltd, Cambridge, UK,\nhttp://icmplus.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk\n). CPP was determined as MAP \u2013 ICP. Ten second moving averages (updated every 10\u2009sec to avoid data overlap) were calculated for all recorded signals: ICP, ABP (which produced MAP), CPP, and PbtO\n2\n. PRx was calculated as the moving correlation coefficient between 30 consecutive 10\u2009sec mean windows of ICP and MAP, updated every minute.\nData were time averaged and down sampled to minute-by-minute resolution for the entire duration of recording for each patient. Grand mean values of all physiological variables were calculated per patient. In addition, the following post-processing of this physiological data occurred in R (R Core Team [2018]. R:\nA Language and Environment for Statistical Computing.\nR Foundation for Statistical Computing: Vienna, Austria.\nhttps://www.R-project.org/\n).\n1.\n% time spent with ICP >20\u2009mm Hg\n8\n- Was determined across the entire recording period.\n2.\n% time spent with PbtO\n2\n< 20\u2009mm Hg\n9\n,\n28\n\u2013 Was determined across the entire recording period.\n3.\n% time spent with PRx above threshold: For each patient the % of time spent above the following clinically defined thresholds were calculated across the entire recording period: 0, +0.25, +0.35.\n5\n,\n11\nAll of these thresholds for PRx have been defined in previous published literature as statistically significant for association with 6-month global outcome in adult TBI patients.\n4.\n% time with normal/abnormal PRx and normal/abnormal PbtO\n2\nvalues - For each patient, across the entire recording period, we determined\na.\u2002% time with PRx above threshold and PbtO\n2\n< 20\u2009mm Hg\nb.\u2002% time with PRx above threshold and PbtO\n2\n> 20\u2009mm Hg\nc.\u2002% time with PRx below threshold and PbtO\n2\n< 20\u2009mm Hg\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis was conducted using R and XLSTAT (Addinsoft, New York, NY;\nhttps://www.xlstat.com/en/\n) add-on package to Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office 15, Version 16.0.7369.1323). Normality of continuous variables was assessed via the Shapiro\u2013Wilks test, in which all variables displayed non-parametric characteristics, and are hence displayed as median (range) or median (interquartile range [IQR]) in the summary of characteristics in Table S1. Various box and contour plots were produced to describe the mean and % time physiological variables for the entire cohort.\nMean % time physiological metrics were compared between dichotomized 6-month GOSE, using Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntesting. GOSE was dichotomized into: Alive/Dead, and Favorable/Unfavorable (with \u22644 denoting unfavorable outcome). For all testing described, \u03b1 was set at 0.05 for significance. No correction for multiple comparisons was made.\nUnivariate logistical regression (ULR) was conducted, comparing each % time physiological variable to both dichotomized GOSE defined outcomes. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and\np\nvalues for the univariate models are reported. All AUCs and 95% CIs for ULR were determined using bootstrapping techniques with 2000 iterations, with only the statistically significant results reported in Table S2. Comparison of ULR model AUCs was conducted using Delong's test.\nFor those physiological variables reaching significance in ULR analysis, multi-variable logistical regression (MLR) models were created, adjusting for baseline admission characteristics and % time with ICP >20\u2009mm Hg, assessing the relationship with dichotomized 6-month GOSE-defined outcomes. These models adjusted for the following baseline admission characteristics (in addition to % time with ICP >20\u2009mm Hg): age, admission GCS motor score, pupillary response, and Marshall CT grade."
